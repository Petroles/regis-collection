ABSTRACT 

The aim of this study was to generate a new therapeutic restorative methodology through a 

flowable composite with bioactive calcium phosphates and incorporation of sodium tri-

metaphosphate in self-etching primer will serve as a biomimetic analogs to self-

phosphoprotein biomineralization production of collagen within the matrix the bonded 

interface. The hypothesis is that the revolutionary biomineralisation will recover the 

biomechanical properties, remineralise and increase the longevity of the bonded interfaces. 

In the chapter 1 was designed to qualitatively compare the presence of phosphate and 

carbonated apatite between demineralized dentin samples and experimental composite 

(VSG1- 0% phosphate, VSG2- 10% phosphate, VSG3- 20% phosphate e VSG4- 30% 

phosphate) storage in distilled water and PBS solution in 24h, 7 days, 1 e 3 months. The 

samples were analyzed by (ATR/FTIR) and (ESEM/EDX). Data were subjected to variance 

analysis with three factors and Tukey (? = 0.05). The results showed that in 24 hours the 

higher peak related the bands of carbonated apatite (CO3
2-

 - v2), phosphate (PO4
3-

 - v1,v3) 

and brushite (DCPD- vO-H) was found to the experimental material VSG2 (distilled water) 

and VSG3 (PBS). After 7 days, these same peaks suffered a drop therefore having an 

increased peak to control group VSG1 (distilled water), VSG2 (PBS) and VSG4 (PBS) 

groups. At 1 month , the material VSG2 (PBS) showed an increase in their peak, on the 

other hand VSG4 group (PBS solution) was maintained as compared to results 7 days and 

after 3 months, was an increase in the peaks to VSG3 materials (distilled water) and control 

group (VSG1) in PBS solution. The EDX analysis showed no statistical difference between 

the groups over time. In the chapter 2, the objective was to evaluate the influence of 

calcium phosphate as a filler in experimental composite and their correlation with the 

degree of conversion, microhardness, flexural resistance and elastic modulus. The 

experimental material VSG4 showed higher hardness values after 6 months and higher 

degree of conversion at 3 months and 6 months. Further flexural strength values were found 

for the experimental material VSG2 well as the commercial material Wave HV (SDI). 

Higher elasticity modulus was obtained for the experimental material VSG4, similar values 

to the commercial Filtek Supreme (Z350XT- 3M/ESPE). Thus, it can be concluded that the 

use of calcium phosphate did not affect the mechanical properties after storage in PBS

solution. In the chapter 3, the aim was evaluated by confocal microscopy and optcial 

microscopy the micropermeability by fluorescein dye penetration and the  nanoleakage by 

ammoniacal silver nitrate as well as the adhesive strength over 24h and 6 months in buffer 

solution (PBS) by microtensile test. Data on microtensile test were subjected to variance 

analysis with two factors and Tukey (? = 0.05). The results showed that the bond strength 

was not statistically different between the experimental groups. The calcium phosphate 

inclusion as filler particles and the use of tri-sodium metaphosphate aided in the 

remineralization process mainly to the experimental material VSG3 and VSG4 which 

showed better micropermeability and  nanoleakage reducing dentin permeability after 6 

months.

RESUMO 

O objetivo do estudo foi gerar uma nova metodologia restauradora, através de um 

compósito fluído fotopolimerizável com fosfatos de cálcio e incorporação de tri-

metafosfato de sódio em primer autocondicionante para auto-produção de fosfoproteína 

biomineralizadora da matriz de colágeno na interface de união. A hipótese desse trabalho 

foi de que a inovadora metodologia irá recuperar as propriedades mecânicas, remineralizará 

e aumentará a longevidade da interface de união. No Capítulo 1 foi realizado análise 

qualitativa em relação à presença de fosfato e apatita carbonata nas amostras de dentina 

desmineralizada e após contato com os compósitos experimentais (VSG1- 0% fosfato, 

VSG2- 10% fosfato, VSG3- 20% fosfato e VSG4- 30% fosfato) armazenados em água 

destilada e solução de PBS no período de 24h, 7 dias, 1 e 3 meses. As amostras foram 

analisadas por espectroscopia (ATR / FTIR) e análise microscópica (ESEM / EDX). Os 

dados foram submetidos à análise de variância de três fatores e teste de Tukey (?=0.05). 

Em 24h os maiores picos referentes às bandas de apatita carbonatada (CO3
2-

 - v2) fosfato 

(PO4
3-

 - v1,v3) e bruxita (DCPD- vO-H) foram para os grupos VSG2 (água destilada) e 

VSG3 (PBS). Em 7 dias esses picos diminuiram e ocorreu aumento dos picos para os 

grupos VSG1 (água destilada), VSG2 (PBS) e VSG4 (PBS). Após 1 mês, o material VSG2 

(PBS) apresentou aumento do pico, por outro lado o grupo VSG4 (PBS) manteve-se similar 

ao do período de 7 dias. Aos 3 meses, nota-se aumento para o material VSG3 (água 

destilada) e grupo controle (VSG1) em PBS. A análise em EDX não mostrou diferença 

estatística entre os grupos no decorrer do tempo.  No Capítulo 2, o objetivo foi avaliar a 

influência de fosfato de cálcio como partículas de carga em relação ao grau de conversão, 

dureza, resistência flexural e módulo elástico. O material experimental VSG4 mostrou 

maiores valores de dureza após 6 meses e maior grau de conversão  nos períodos de 3 

meses e 6 meses. Maiores valores de resistência à flexão foram encontrados para o material 

experimental  VSG2 bem como para o material comercial Wave HV (SDI). Maior módulo 

de elasticidade foi obtido para o material VSG4, valores estes similares aos obtidos para o 

material comercial Filtek Z350XT (3M/ESPE). Assim, pode-se concluir que a utilização de 

fosfatos de cálcio não afetou as propriedades mecânicas após envelhecimento em solução 

de PBS. No Capítulo 3, o objetivo foi avaliar por microscopia de confocal e microscopia 

óptica a micropermeabilidade por penetração de corante fluoresceína e nanoinfiltração por 



  x  
 

nitrato de prata amoniacal na camada híbrida assim como a resistência adesiva nos períodos 

de 24 h e 6 meses em solução de PBS. Os dados referentes ao teste de união foram 

submetidos à análise de variância de dois fatores e teste de Tukey (?=0.05). Os resultados 

mostraram que em relação à resistência adesiva não houve diferença estatística entre os 

grupos e período de armazenamento. A inclusão de fosfato de cálcio e o uso de tri-

metafosfato de sódio auxiliaram no processo de remineralização para o material 

experimental VSG3 e VSG4 os quais mostraram melhores resultados, reduzindo a 

permeabilidade dentinária após 6 meses.

INTRODUÇÃO  

A degradação da união resina-dentina tem sido demonstrada em vários estudos in 

vitro (1-4) e in vivo (1, 3, 5). Embora o exato mecanismo de deterioração da interface 

adesiva ainda não seja totalmente conhecido, sabe-se que seus componentes estão sujeitos 

aos efeitos deletérios da presença de água circulante na interface (degradação hidrolítica) e 

da ação de enzimas proteolíticas (6). 

A degradação enzimática pode ser mediada por um grupo de enzimas que 

representam uma família de endopeptidases capazes de degradar componentes da matriz 

extracelular denominadas de metaloproteinases da matriz dentinária (MMPs). Essas 

hidrolases atuam nas fibrilas de colágeno expostas na base da camada híbrida devido a 

discrepância entre a profundidade de desmineralização ácida da dentina e a infiltração 

monomérica durante os procedimentos adesivos (7-9), ou ainda devido à lixiviação de 

componentes poliméricos resinosos em longo prazo, que ocorre como resultado da 

degradação hidrolítica (10). 

Fibrilas de colágeno permanecem expostas após a união resina-dentina devido à 

incompleta infiltração da dentina desmineralizada pelos monômeros resinosos (11). Isso 

ocorre como resultado conjunto de uma série de fatores tais como a redução gradual dos 

espaços interfibrilares no sentido da dentina mineralizada, o alto peso molecular e menor 

hidrofilia de alguns monômeros resinosos presentes nos adesivos dentinários (12, 13) e o 

gradiente de umidade da dentina (14) o que permite a ocorrência da separação de fases (13).  

Uma maior exposição desse colágeno na base da camada híbrida tem sido 

demonstrada nas interfaces produzidas sobre dentina afetada por cárie (15). Isso ocorre 

devido à menor mineralização e maior porosidade da dentina intertubular no substrato 

afetado por cárie, o que favorece a difusão do agente ácido e, consequentemente, uma 

desmineralização mais profunda (15). 

A fim de restaurar esse equilíbrio e reverter a desmineralização, é necessário um 

reforço de remineralização. A remineralização pode ser conseguida por meio do 

crescimento epitaxial de cristais minerais residuais (matriz orgânica) das lesões 

desmineralizadas (16, 17). 

Devido à perda mineral e diminuição da integridade de união das interfaces, a 

procura por métodos terapêuticos inovadores para reparação da dentina cariada é crescente 



  2  
 

(18, 19). Tem sido confirmado (20) (21)  que a liberação de íons a partir de materiais 

restauradores 

pode induzir a precipitação de minerais para dentro da interface de dentina, favorecendo a 

reparação tecidual.  

Idealmente, a recuperação da biofuncionalidade mecânica da dentina 

desmineralizada só é possível devido à remineralização do colágeno a nível intra-fibrilar; se 

esta condição não for preenchida o processo deve ser considerado incompleto (20, 22).  

A dentina desmineralizada sofre degradação (principalmente pelo colágeno do tipo 

I) pela liberação de ácidos pela ativação das enzimas endógenas colagenolíticas (MMPs: 

metalloproteinases da matriz dentínária) e estas não são completamente inibidas ou 

fossilizadas (18). 

Um artigo publicado recentemente (23) demonstrou que materiais a base de resina 

contendo vidros bioativos podem aumentar a durabilidade de união na interface adesiva 

através do efeito de proteção terapêutica associados com a remineralização da interface.  

Uma boa parte das pesquisas atuais em biomateriais para uso em Odontologia 

objetiva a diversificação e a modificação dos materiais dentários existentes. Um aspecto 

fundamental é a estabilidade destes materiais em longo prazo e a alternativa é minimizar a 

degradação (24, 25). 

Dentre os materiais bioativos estão os fosfatos de cálcio que têm despertado grande 

interesse e motivo de diversas pesquisas na área (26) (24, 25). As combinações de CaP 

podem estar organizados em várias fases distintas, tais como: fosfato de cálcio dibásico 

anidro (CaHPO4- DCP); fosfato de cálcio dibásico diidratado (CaHPO4. H2O- DCPD); 

fosfato de cálcio tribásico ou fosfato tricálcico [Ca3(PO4)2- TCP]; fosfato de cálcio amorfo 

[Ca3(PO4)2?H2O- ACP]; fosfato octacálcio [Ca8H2(PO4)6H2O- OCP]; fosfato tetracálcico 

[Ca4O(PO4)2- TeCP]; fosfato monocálcio mono-hidrato [Ca(H2PO4)2.H20- MCPM]; HA 

[Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2- (hidroxiapatita)] e fluorapatita ou apatita FA [Ca5(PO4)3F].  

Alguns CaP como ?TCP são considerados absorvíveis, isto é, dissolvem sob 

condições fisiológicas e a vantagem disto é que eles podem ser usados como biomateriais 

para serem assimilados pelo organismo (27, 28). 

O objetivo deste trabalho foi gerar uma metodologia restauradora baseada em bio-

remineralização, por meio de um material restaurador fotopolimerizável (compósito 



  3  
 

resinoso fluído) com fosfatos de cálcio bioativos e incorporação de metafosfatos (tri-

metafosfato de sódio e ácido poliacrílico) em primer autocondicionante para auto-produção 

de fosfoproteína biomineralizadora da matriz de colágeno dentro da interface de união. 

A hipótese do estudo foi de que a nova metodologia iria recuperar as propriedades 

biomecânicas e remineralizaria a dentina justaposta à interface de união. A aplicação 

clínica dessa metodologia seria alcançada por meio da criação de sistemas restauradores 

simplificados (compósitos fluídos) que podem unir-se e criar uma interface de união com 

os tecidos dentários desmineralizados.  

Para isso, este trabalho está apresentado no formato alternativo de tese, de acordo 

com as normas estabelecidas pela deliberação 002/06 da Comissão Central de Pós-

Graduação da Universidade Estadual de Campinas. Assim está disposto em 3 capítulos, em

CAPÍTULO 1  

Dentin remineralization induced by biomimetic analogs and calcium phosphates  

The study was designed to qualitatively compare the presence of phosphate and carbonated 

apatite peaks between demineralized dentin and experimental flowable composite samples 

(VSG1-0% phosphate, VSG2-10% phosphate, VSG3- 20% phosphate and VSG4-30% 

phosphate)  thereby checking the remineralization ability and analysis calcium phosphate 

deposits to the interface dentin-composite. Four experimental flowable composite 

containing bioactive phosphate were formulated. Furthermore, specific primer were also 

developed by using sodium tri-metaphosphate. The remineralization ability was evaluated 

using (ATR/FTIR). Dentin slices were prepared and demineralized in EDTA 17%. Disks of 

set materials were prepared and was maintained in close contact with a demineralized 

dentin slice soaked in PBS solution and distillate water during 24h, 7 days, 1 and 3 months. 

For the analysis of the calcium phosphate deposits to the interface dentin-composite was 

used a (ESEM/EDX). In this case, the resin-bonded specimens were sectioned obtaining 

beams and analyzed after 24h and 6 months. Data were subjected to variance analysis with 

three factors and Tukey’s test (? = 0.05). In 24 hours the higher peak was found at the 

phosphate and apatite carbonated to the experimental material VSG2 (distilled water) and 

VSG3 (PBS). After 7 days, these same peaks suffered a drop therefore having an increased 

peak to control group VSG1 (distilled water), VSG2 (PBS) and VSG4 (PBS). At 1 month , 

the material VSG2 (PBS) showed an increase in their peak, on the other hand VSG4 (PBS 

solution) was maintained as compared to results 7 days and after 3 months, was an increase 

in the peaks to VSG3 materials (distilled water) and control group (VSG1) in PBS solution. 

The EDX analysis not showed statistical difference between the groups over time (p ?0.05). 

According to the data presented by ATR/FTIR the phosphate concentration not influence in 

the presence or absence of bands related to phosphate and carbonate apatite peaks. EDX 

analysis of the interface resin-dentin not showed statisticaly difference between the groups 

over time.

1. Introduction 

 

Several studies have been aimed at reincorporating mineral into demineralized dentin 

(1-4) by inclusion of CaP powder as a filler phase in bioactive polymer composites (5-10). 

In these preventive or restorative dental materials, CaP is encapsulated in a polymer binder, 

and is capable of slowly releasing, in aqueous environments, substantial amounts of 

calcium and phosphate ions in a sustained manner through the transition to apatitic phases 

(6, 7) where the polymer resin serves to slow down the transition, as well as providing the 

mechanical integrity of the composite material. These composites have been shown to 

promote the recovery of mineral deficient tooth structure in vitro (11). The bioactivity of 

these materials originates from the propensity of CaP, once exposed to oral fluids with 

fluctuating pH, which include those with acidic low pH, to release calcium and phosphate 

ions in a sustained manner while spontaneously converting to thermodynamically stable 

apatitic structures, such as HA (11).  

Most of these studies focused on conventional remineralization that is based on the 

reincorporation of mineral (apatite) in dental tissues (dentin or enamel) by the use of 

calcium and phosphate ion-containing solution in presence of various concentrations of 

fluoride (12, 13). Such a remineralization does not rely on spontaneous nucleation of 

mineral on the organic matrix but rather on epitaxial growth of residual apatite seed 

crystallites in the partially demineralized dentin (14-17). Thus, only those parts of a 

collagen matrix where remnant seed crystallites are present and abundant can be effectively 

remineralized, such as the basal part of a carious lesion (29).  In this regard, the use of 

conventional remineralization strategies that do not utilize biomimetic analogs is 

reasonably successful.  

The guide tissue remineralization (GTR) represents a novel strategy in collagen 

biomineralization. This strategy utilizes nanotechnology and biomimetic principles to 

achieve intrafibrillar and extrafibrillar remineralization of a collagen matrix in the abscence 

of apatite seed crystalittes (18-20). In this strategy, two polyanionic analogs (polyacrylic 



  7  
 

acid or polyaspartic acid) are involved to mimic the sequestration and templating functions 

of matrix proteins in biomineralization. Dentin is a mineralized collagenous tissue formed 

by matrix-mediated mechanisms. Inorganic polyphosphates play an important role in 

guiding the nucleation and growth of apatite within the gap zones of collagen fibrils during 

biomineralization (21). 

The current study was designed to qualitatively compare the presence of phosphate and 

carbonated apatite peaks between demineralized dentin and experimental flowable 

composite samples (VSG1-0% phosphate, VSG2-10% phosphate, VSG3- 20% phosphate 

and VSG4-30% phosphate) thereby checking the remineralization ability using Attenuated 

Total Reflection by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR/FTIR) and Scanning 

Electron Microscopy-Energy-Dispersive X-ray analysis (ESEM/EDX) was used to analyse 

the chemical changes to the interface dentin-composite.  

The hypothesis that the calcium-phosphate would not induce a remineralization and the 

ESEM-EDX analysis of the interface resin-dentin not revealed the presence of calcium and 

phosphate elements. 

 

2. Materials and methods 

2.1 Composite formulations  

 

Four experimental composite flow (named VSG1, VSG2, VSG3, VSG4) were 

tested in this study. The resin matrix for all formulations can be showed in Table 1. Each 

experimental composite was loaded with MCPM [Sharlau, Spain], ?TCP [Fluka, Germany] 

and Calcium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) (Tab.2). Each group had received a specific 

phosphate concentration to which was added Ba-Al-silicate glass (FGM, Joinvile, SC, 

Brazil) (Tab. 3). The materials were prepared by mixing powder (phosphate and silicate 

glass) with the resin matrix to form a homogeneous paste. 

2.2 Dentin Remineralization tests (DRT): ATR/FTIR vibrational of the 

bioactivity 

 

The DRT was performed according to a protocol previously described Gandolfi et 

al., (2011) (22),  human dentin slices  (5±0.2 mm and 0.8 ±0.1mm thick)  from  40 molar 



  8  
 

teeth  (n=10 per group) were prepared and demineralized in EDTA 17% for 2 hours at room 

temperature (Fig 1). 

Disks of set materials (8 mm diameter and 1.6 mm thick) were prepared using a 

teflon molds. Each material disk (n=10 per group) was maintained in close contact with a 

demineralized dentin slice using an orthodontic elastic and 5 slices of each group soaked in 

15 mL PBS solution in the refrigerator, and  5 slices of each group soaked in 15 mL 

distillate water at 37°C, during 24h, 7 days, 1 and 3 months (Fig. 1). 

The PBS solution (pH of 7.4) it is a saline solution containing sodium chloride and 

sodium phosphate. Acid-base buffers are intended to maintain a substantially constant pH 

value, when added to different means.  The salt concentration present in PBS is the same 

the human body (isotonic). 

After this time, the dentin slice was removed from the material disk, rinsed with 

deionized water (samples soaked in PBS solution) and them analyzed in dry conditions 

(excess of water totally removed by 30 min. in the oven) by ATR-FTIR Spectrometer 

(Nicolet 5700 FTIR spectrometer), equipped with a Smart Orbit diamond attenuated total 

reflectante (ATR) accessory and a DTGS detector (Fig.1).  

 The spectral resolution was 4 cm
-1

 and 64 number of scans for each spectrum in the 

region of 650-4000 cm
-1

. The ATR area had a 2 mm diameter and the IR irradiation 

penetration was approximately 3-5 µm. In order to place the specimens in contact with the 

ATR crystal, a pressure was applied (5psi) during the measurement. Each specimen was 

analysed in three different positions (the sample medium, up and down) before the contact 

with the material disks (demineralized sample) and after contact the material disks. 

The spectrum acquired at the end of the analyses represented the average of all the 

three single scans. Spectra of water was obtained and subtracted from each of the original 

spectra, which were then processed by smoothing, baseline corrected, and normalized to the 

amide I peak (23). The mineral matrix radio (the radio of integrated areas of the phosphate 

v1, v3 contour to the amide I peak, carbonated apatite- v2, and v-OH, DCPD peaks) was 

measured qualitatively in all spectra. The crystal of DCPD peaks appear at 3527, 3468, 

3273 and 3171 cm
?1

 bands were due to ?O–H vibration modes of the water in brushite. 

 In addition, ATR-FTIR spectra from the commercial high purity (&gt;97%) 

hydroxyapatite (Sigma-Aldrich) powder were also obtained to characterize their chemical 



  9  
 

structures. The untreated dentin slice and after demineralization were analyzed for 

comparison in relation to peaks position as comparison with the experimental material 

without phosphate (VSG1- control group). 

 

2.3 Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-

ray analysis (ESEM-EDX) 

 

24 molar teeth (n=6) was used to ESEM-EDX. The coronal dentin specimens (n=3 per 

group) were prepared by sectioning the roots 1mm beneath the cement-enamel junction 

(CEJ), using a hard tissue microtome (Isomet 11/180; Buehler, Coventry, UK) equipped 

with a diamond embedded blade (XL-12205; Benetec, London, UK). The smear layer-

covered middle coronal dentin was exposed by a polishing treatment using a 600-grit SiC 

paper for 1 min. under continuous water irrigation. The specimens were divided into four 

experimental groups, according to Table 3 and the etching procedures were performed by 

self-etching primer (Table 4).  

The self-etching primer was applied vigorously for 30s on prepared surfaces dentin with 

microbrush and solvent evaporated with a gentle steam air for 10 seconds. The 

experimental flowable composites were used to build-up (3 layers – 1mm each). Each 

composite layer was light-cured for 20s, using a quartz-tungsten-halogen lamp (Optilux-

501; Kerr) and the last coat was light-cured for 40s. 

After 24h and 6 months PBS solution storage, the resin-bonded specimens from each 

group were sectioned using a hard tissue microtome (Buehler, UK) in both x and y 

directions across the bonding interface obtaining beams with cross-sectional areas of 0.9 

mm
2
. Three representative beams were prepared for scanning electron microscopy (ESEM-

EDX) to analyse the chemical changes to the interface dentin-composite. The beams were 

mounted on aluminum stubs, coated with carbon (Balzers SCD 050 sputter coater, B.U.A. 

Co., Fürstentum, Germany) and examined by Environmental Scanning Electron 

Microscopy (ESEM, JSM-5600LV-JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), operated an accelerating voltage 

of 20-25kV. Each specimen was analysed in five different positions (in the material and 

four position in the interface) showing the relation the Ca/P in each position.

3.2 Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-

ray analysis (ESEM-EDX) 

The ESEM-EDX analysis of the dentin untreated surface (Fig. 5b) and completely 

demineralized dentin (Fig. 5a) showed traces of calcium phosphate and the presence of the 

carbon and oxygen peak. The EDX depth profile on demineralized dentin sections proved 

that the treatment used (EDTA 17%, 2h) removed the mineral phase of dentin to 80µm 

depth. Actually, Ca and P peaks were observed in lower peaks, suggesting that the water 

and collagen were left in place.

The ESEM-EDX analysis for the four experimental flowable composites (VSG1 

control group, VSG2, VSG3 and VSG4), soaked in PBS solution during 24h and 6 months, 

in relation the CA/P (mean and SDs) are shown in Table 5. Results were analysed with 

two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (p?0.05). 

 Interactions between Ca/P were no significant (p ?0.05). Material and PBS solution 

storage time (24h and 6 months) no influenced the CA/P results (p?0.01).  

The ESEM-EDX analysis for experimental flowable composite (VSG1, VSG2, 

VSG3 and VSG4) soaked in PBS solution during 24h (Fig 6a,7a, 8a, 9a) and after 6 months 

(Fig. 6b, 7b, 8b, 9b) showed the presence of calcium phosphate deposits (Ca/P- 2.17 [24h], 

1.27- [6m]),  (Ca/P- 2.25 [24h], 1.98- [6m]), (Ca/P- 2.10 [24h], 2.72- [6m]), (Ca/P- 2.26 

[24h], 1.66- [6m]) on the dentin interface surface. 

4. Discussion 

The hypothesis that calcium-phosphate (MCPM and ?-TCP) in the experimental 

flowable composite in contact with demineralized dentin surfaces not induce a 

remineralization (e.g. phosphate, carbonated apatite peaks and DCPD peaks) was rejected. 

The experimental flowable composites induced an apatite formation as showed by presence

bands appeared over time independent of the storage and the phosphate concentration for

compared with the demineralized dentin sample which showed collagen bands by the 

presence of amide bands from 1725 cm

 bands were due to ?O–H 

vibration modes of the water in brushite (25).  

The FTIR spectra of the carbonate apatite are dominated by a complex band at about 

1000-1100 cm

 for the asymmetric stretch vibration of the phosphate group. The 

characteristic bands for carbonate occur in the spectra regions 1400-1600 cm
-1

 (v3; 

asymmetric stretch vibration) and 873-880 cm
-1

 (v2; out-of-plane bend vibration) (44). 

Earlier study on natural and synthetic HA (26) found that type A carbonate was 



  12  
 

characterised by a doublet band at about 1545 and 1450 cm
-1

 (v3) and a single band at about 

878 cm-1 (v2), whereas type B carbonate has these bands at about 1455, 1410 and 871 cm
-1

, 

respectively.  

When compared the samples soaked in distilled water and PBS solution during 24h, 

was observed an increase in phosphate and carbonate apatite peak for (VSG2-distilled 

water) and (VSG3- PBS solution). After 7 days, the same group showed a decrease in these 

peaks. However, the (VSG1- distilled water), (VSG2- PBS solution) and (VSG4- PBS 

solution) had an increase in these peaks. At 1 month of storage, only the groups (VSG2- 

PBS solution) and (VSG4- PBS solution) had an increase in their peaks and after 3 months 

(VSG3-distilled water), (VSG4- PBS solution) and (VSG1-PBS solution) showed an 

increased peak. In 3 months, there was an increase in these peaks for the material VSG3 

stored in distillate water and decreased during the same period prescribed when stored in 

PBS solution. The crystal of DCPD peaks (?O–H vibration modes) was observed in all 

groups during the proposed time, both soaked in distilled water as PBS solution. 

The CaP used as filler in restorative dental materials  is encapsulated in a polymer 

binder, and is capable of slowly releasing, in aqueous environments, substantial amounts of 

calcium and phosphate ions in a sustained manner through the transition to apatitic phases 

(7, 19) where the polymer resin serves to slow down the transition, as well as providing the 

mechanical integrity of the composite material. These composites have been shown to 

promote the recovery of mineral deficient tooth structure in vitro (11). The bioactivity of 

these materials originates from the propensity of CaP, once exposed to oral fluids with 

fluctuating pH, which include those with acidic low pH, to release calcium and phosphate 

ions in a sustained manner while spontaneously converting to thermodynamically stable 

apatitic structures (11). The MCPM and ?TCP powder (CaP) which in contact with the 

water (oral fluids) react and form dicalcium phosphate dihydrate crystals [DCPD- brushite]. 

It is well known that precipitated Ca-P phases in aqueous solutions mainly include 

dicalcium phosphate [CaHPO4.2H2O, DCPD], octacalcium phosphate 

[Ca8(HPO4)2(PO4)4. 5H2O, OCP] and hydroxyapatite [Ca10(OH)2(PO4)6, HA]. 

Experimental studies of Ca-P formation in simulated physiological environments have 

not clearly indicated the conditions to forming specific Ca-P phases. Some investigations 

have been demonstrated their stability at low pH (&lt;4.2) (8, 9, 46, 47) or possible when 



  13  
 

immersed in a calcium-ion saturated solution and through pH increase (46). According 

Xiong et al., (2005) the free energy changes of Ca-P precipitation and the Ca-P nucleations 

rates in aqueous solutions (i.e, simulated body fluid) are presented for a range of pH values. 

However, there is no thermodynamic driving force for the DCPD precipitation over the 

entire pH range. The PBS solution is composed by sodium chloride and sodium phosphate 

thus, the environment gets supersaturated with ions which induces the precipitation stage 

and the apatite nucleation.  This  explains  the  presence of   apatite carbonated bands (v2) 

and  phosphate bands (v1, v3)  in the experimental group (VSG1- 0% phosphate) at 7 days 

and 3 months, once that this group not have phosphate in their composition. 

Various methods have been used for evaluating the effectiveness of the remineralization 

procedure in dental tissues. Recent studies have assessed the reincorporation of mineral into 

demineralized dentin using indirect qualitative analysis, such as, polarized light microscopy 

(27) and semiquantitative analysis such as transverse microradiography (28). Transmission 

Electron Microscopy (TEM) (20) and spectroscopic analyses, such as Raman and Fourier 

transform infrared spectroscopy was also assessed (13, 29).  In polarized light microscopy 

analyses, the quantitative relationship between changes in mineral content and 

birefringence has not been established. In the present study, IR spectroscopy in the 

ATR/FTIR technique has been used for non-destructively  analysis to verify the efficiency 

of the demineralization procedure as well as the extent of the remineralization process. The 

same technique has been used to characterize the composition changes on the surface of the 

cement disks aged in PBS solution (22). 

One way of classify the calcium phosphate is through molar ratio 

calcium/phosphorus atoms (Ca/P ratio). According to the ESEM-EDX analysis for 

experimental flowable composites (VSG1, VSG2, VSG3 and VSG4) soaked in PBS 

solution during 24h and 6 months, the presence of calcium phosphate deposits on the dentin 

interface not showed statisticaly difference between the groups.   

The ESEM-EDX characterization capabilities are due in large part to the basic 

principle that each element has a unique atomic structure X-ray emission spectrum, 

allowing unique set of peaks on its (30). The apatite crystals of the carbonated apatite is 

similar to the mineral hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, but inclusions carbonate, sodium 

fluoride, magnesium, potassium, iron and other ion are impure form of biological apatite. 



  14  
 

These minerals correspond the 80%-90% of apatite carbonated (26, 31, 32). So, the 

carbonated hydroxyapatite form could be chemically represented by the formula: (Ca, Mg, 

Na, x) 10 (PO4, HPO4 (CO3)6 (OH, CI) 2 where X is the inclusion of other ions (26, 31, 32). 

Thus, if is compared the Ca amount by this molecule in both forms is noted that the HA has 

60 Ca-atoms compared with 10 Ca-atoms in apatite carbonated. Thus, if it relates the 

presence of Ca/P in the interface (remineralized area) according to data obtained, it 

suggests that the number of these elements were the same, without difference between 

groups and times (once that was used different phosphates concentrations), which could 

lead to one difference in remineralization procedure, favouring different action of these 

elements in the nucleation process. 

Although there was no statistical difference, studies report Aoki, 1991 (33) that the 

DCPD (dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate) molar ratio is 1.0, and hydroxyapatite (HA) is 

1.67. According to the data obtained in our studies, the experimental group VSG4 after 6 

months storage in PBS solution showed molar ratio Ca/P of 1.66, suggesting the formation 

of hydroxyapatite. 

In this methodology, two biomimetic analogs were used (polyacrylic acid and 

sodium trimetaphosphate). During calcium phosphate biomineralization, calcium and 

phosphate ions are sequesteredy by biomimetic analogs of non-collagenous proteins 

involved in hard tissue mineralization into nanoparticles that exist in nanoscopical units 

known as prenucleation clusters(34, 35). These prenucleation clusters (~1nm in diameter) 

eventually aggregate into larger (10-50nm in diameter) liquid-like CaP nanoparticles. The 

latter, on penetration into the intrafibrillar water compartments of a collagen fibril, utilize 

the latter as a mineralization template, and undergo self-assembly and crystallographic 

alignment to form a metastable crystalline phase via mesoscale assembly. These 

mesocrystals probably fused to form iso-oriented crystal intermediates, and finally to single 

apatite crystallites within the 40nm wide gap zone between the collagen molecules (36, 37). 

This ordered arrangement of apatite crystallites results in the manifestation of a banded 

appearance in unstained, mineralized fibrillar collagen (38). Thus, there is not only a 

remineralization mechanism but biomimetic analogs that would guide the 

bioremineralization, once that collagenous remineralization will occur by an assignment 



  15  
 

newly formed crystals, not containing a direct link with the fibrillar collagen (Dey et al., 

2010). 

 

5. Conclusion 

 

- The presence of calcium phosphate (MCPM and ?-TCP) in the experimental 

flowable composites in contact with the demineralized dentin induced the formation 

of hydroxyapatite crystals. 

- EDX analysis of the interface resin-dentin revealed the presence of calcium and 

phosphate elements but not showed statistically difference between the groups.

Mechanical properties of a new flowable resin composite relying on biomimetic 

analogs and calcium phosphates for dentin remineralization 

The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of bioactive calcium phosphate as 

a filler particles with the mechanical properties after aging. Four experimental ion-releasing 

resin-base materials and specific primer using sodium tri-metaphosphate were formulated 

and submitted to Knoop Hardness Analysis (KHN). Two commercially available flowable 

composites (Filtek Supreme XT and Wave HV), one glass ionomer cement (Riva self-cure 

HV) and the experimental materials were submitted to Degree of Conversion (DC), 

Flexural modulus (FM) and Elastic modulus (EM). When was analysed the hardness 

values, the control group (VSG1) had the highest hardness values (p?0.05) in 24h on 

interface region. During six months all materials had a decrease in values (p?0.05). The DC 

values during 40s, showed highest values (p?0.05) to the material Riva, Filtek Supreme, 

VSG4 and lower values to the material Wave. In 24h, remaining the statistically lower 

values between VSG1, VSG2, VSG4 and Filtek Supreme and highest values (p?0.05) to 

the composite Filtek Supreme, VSG2 and VSG4. At 1h the materials Riva, Filtek Supreme 

and VSG1 showed the highest values (p?0.05). The material Wave showed statistically 

lower values (p?0.05) between the others materials. The same occurred in 1 month, 

remaining the statistically lower values between the Wave, Riva, Filtek Supreme, VSG2, 

VSG3 and VSG4. The composite Filtek Supreme and VSG3 showed the highest values 

(p?0.05) in comparing to the other groups. During 3 months and 6 months the material 

Wave showed the statistically lower values  between the Filtek Supreme and VSG4, that 

obtained the highest values (p?0.05). According to the flexural strength the composite 

Filtek Supreme and Wave had the highest values in 24h. Regarding the VSG2, VSG3 and 

VSG4 showed statistically lower values comparing with the control group VSG1 followed 

by the Riva. At 3 months Riva showed a smaller result statistically different from the other 

materials.During six months, the control group VSG1 had the highest value without differ 

statistically from the VSG2 and Wave (p?0.05). The composite Filtek Supreme and Wave 

had the highest values to elastic modulus during 24h. The experimental composite VSG3 

and Riva showed statistically lower values. At 3 months, there was no statistically 



  34  
 

difference between all groups tested. Regarding the VSG1, VSG2 and Filtek Supreme 

showed statistically highest values in 6 months in comparing to the others groups. The 

cohesive strength (MPa) values for the Wave and experimental composite (VSG1) had the 

highest values in 24h. The experimental composite (VSG4) and Riva showed lower values 

(p?0.05) in 24h between to the others materials tested. After six months, the composite 

Filtek Supreme and Riva showed the lower values (p?0.05). Highest values (p?0.05) was 

obtained to Wave and VSG2. It is concluded that the use of calcium phosphate (MCPM and 

BTCP) as fillers affected the properties in some tests after aging.

1. Introduction 

 

 The longevity of posterior composite restorations remains a matter of concern among 

dentist. Surveys revealed that composite restorations placed in premolars and molars need to be 

replaced after 5–6 years (1-3). The need for more durable restorations is one of the driving 

forces for the development of new materials and, though not always suitable for predicting 

clinical outcomes, laboratory evaluations are often used to estimate their potential by 

comparison with already established commercial products (4). 

Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a new class of composites that can combat 

recurrent caries while sustaining the load-bearing capability (5-8). Recently developed calcium 

phosphate filled polymeric dental composites based on photocurable dental resins are capable of 

releasing significant amounts of calcium and phosphate ions in a sustained manner in aqueous 

milieu (5, 9-13) (14). These bioactive composites are potentially effective anti-

demineralizing/remineralizing agents for the preservation and repair of teeth with foreseeable 

applications as dental restorative composites, adhesives, cements, protective liners and bases, 

pit and fissure sealants and orthodontic bracket cements.  

To improve their mechanical properties while maintaining sustained release of Ca and 

PO4 ions, the researches have so far focused on: (a) synthesizing fillers with structurally 



  35  
 

incorporated silica and/ or zirconia and (b) developing surface-modified hybrid fillers amenable 

to treatment by silane coupling agents (9, 14). 

The improvement of the mechanical properties of bioactive composite materials has 

been a subject of extensive research for several years (15, 16). In the development of dental 

composites, Bowen, (1956, 1963) (17, 18) was the first who proved that the filler load plays an 

important role in increasing the modulus and strength of dental composite resins (17, 18). Later 

studies confirmed that the volume fraction of the filler is positively correlated to the diametral 

tensile strength and hardness of commercial composite materials (19, 20). Besides, strong 

covalent bond between the inorganic fillers and the organic matrix is considered to be essential 

for obtaining good mechanical properties (21).  

It has been reported that stable filler/matrix bonds improve the distribution and 

stress transmission from the flexible resin matrix to the stiffer and stronger inorganic filler 

particles (21). In contrast, ineffective silane coupling can result in an accelerated in vivo 

degradation of dental composites (22). Unlike conventional composite materials, CaP fillers 

cannot be effectively silanized as this interferes with the calcium and phosphate ion release, 

which impairs the remineralizing properties while not providing a progress in mechanical 

properties (14, 23-26). This is confirmed by an attempt to silanize similar calcium and 

phosphate releasing material, which increased the composites strength, but decreased the ion 

release (24-26).  

Some studies have shown that the composite resins with calcium phosphate fillers 

are only useful for sealants (14, 27). One study used apatite particles combined with nanometer-

scale silica whiskers as mixed filler in an attempt to overcome this loss of strength (14). These 

authors found that the whiskered composite had substantially improved mechanical properties 

when compared to the reinforced fillers in the composite resins without whiskers (14, 27).  

In order to use these materials in clinical practice as a restorative material, it is 

necessary to enhance the mechanical properties so that the material could withstand the 

masticatory tension. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of bioactive 

calcium phosphate (MCPM and ?TCP) as filler in experimental flowable composite and their 

correlation with the mechanical properties after aging. The hypothesis was that calcium 

phosphate used as a filler in experimental flowable composites interfere on the mechanical 

properties.

2. Materials and methods 

2.1 Composite and self-etching primer formulations  

 

Experimental flowable composite were tested in this study. The resin blend can be 

showed in Table 1. Each experimental composite was loaded with MCPM (Monocalcium 

phosphate monohydrate [Sharlau, Spain], ?TCP (?-Tricalcium phosphate [Fluka, Germany] 

and Calcium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) (Tab.2) (VSG1- 0wt% VSG2-10wt%, 20wt% and 

VSG3- VSG4-30wt%). After this, was added to this mixture Ba-Al-silicate glass (FGM, 

Joinvile, SC, Brazil) at a concentration of (VSG1- 50wt%, 40wt% VSG2-, VSG3- 30wt% 

and VSG4-20wt%) (Tab. 3); a resin blend was added in the end by 50wt% (Tab.1). The 

experimental self-etching primer were obtained by adding: GDMA-P (20wt%)- hydrophilic 

monomers functional acids, HEMA (10wt%), TEGDMA (10wt%), UDMA (15wt%), 

Distilled water (15wt%), Ethanol (20wt%), (0.5wt%)- Sodium trimetaphosphate and 

(0.5wt%)-  Polyacrilic acid. 

 

2.2 Sample preparation 

 Sixteen third human molars were used in this study (n=2) under a protocol (ref. 150/2012) 

approved by an institutional. The teeth were stored in deionised water for 24h and 6 months. 

Coronal dentine specimens were prepared by sectioning the roots 1mm beneath the cement-

enamel junction (CEJ). The smear layer-covered middle coronal dentine was exposed by 

polishing treatment using a 600-grit SiC paper for 1 minute under continuous water irrigation. 

The specimens were divided into experimental groups according to Table 3. The bonded-dentin 

specimens were submitted to a simulated pulpal pressure method (SPP) as previously described 

(Feitosa et al., 2012) (28, 29). The resin-bonded teeth were covered with two coats of nail 

varnish at resin-enamel border to avoid water seepage through this margin; hence, the passage 

of water was possible only through dentinal tubules. The specimens were glued and positioned 

sideways on the lid of a cylindrical receptacle. The pulp chamber of each specimen and the 

receptacle were filled with PBS solution, sealed and turned upside down. The samples had a 

20cm water column over them. The water pressure was maintained for 24h and 6 months.

2.3 Dentine pre-treatment and bonding procedures 

 

The self-etching primer was applied vigorously for 30s on prepared dentin surface with 

microbrush and solvent evaporated with compressed air for 10 seconds. The experimental 

composites were light cured for 20s (3 layers- 1mm) using a quartz-tungsten-halogen lamp 

(Optilux-501; Kerr). The last coat was light-cured for 40s with 850 mW / cm² light intensity. 

 

2.4 Knoop Hardness Analysis (KHN) 

 

The resin-bonded specimens (N=16, n=2) were  longitudinally sectioned in 2mm-thick 

slabs (5 slices per teeth).The thick slabs were inserted into a polyvinylsiloxane mould and 

embedded in self-cure acrylic resin. The specimens were removed from the moulds and 

polished using #500, #1200, #2400 and #4000 grit SiC abrasive papers on an automated 

polisher (MetaServ 3000, Buehler) under water-cooling (30 s per abrasive papers). The 

specimens were stored in PBS solution at 37°C for 24h and 6 months. The specimens were 

dried and submitted to Knoop hardness measurements in a hardness tester (Duramin-5, Struers 

A/S, DK-2750 Ballerup, Denmark) using a 25gf load and 15s dwell time to produce 

indentations with a size suitable accurate measurements for minimising surface damage. The 

Knoop micro-hardness values (KHN: Kg/mm
2
) were recorded as the average of the three 

indentations executed in straight lines starting from the resin composite along four different 

positions (Fig. 1) of the dentine surface (interface, below interface, distance interface and hard 

tissue). The three measurements along each line were taken every 30µm up to 110µm in depth. 

For each depth, three readings were taken and averaged to obtain a mean value (Kg.mm
-1

). For 

each slab was considered as a sample unit. Data were subjected to variance analysis with three 

factors followed by Tukey’s test (p?0.05). 

2.5 Degree of Conversion (DC) 

 

Two commercially available flowable composites, one self-cure glass ionomer (GIC) 

along with four experimental materials (flowable composite) were selected for this test: Filtek
TM

 

Supreme Flow (3M/ESPE), Wave HV (SDI), Riva self-cure HV (SDI), VSG1,VSG2, VSG3 



  38  
 

and VSG4. The composition of these materials is listed in Table 1, 2, 3 and 4. For each material 

cylindrical specimens (6mm diameter x 1 mm thickness) were built (N=126, n=3) using a 

Teflon mould. The composites were inserted and a Mylar strip was placed on top of the uncured 

material. A glass slide was positioned on top of the Mylar strip. The halogen curing unit (850 

mW/cm
2
, Optilux-501, Demetron Kerr, Orange, USA) was clamped directly over the window 

filled with restorative material, and the tip of the curing unit was perpendicular to the surface of 

the composites. The groups VSG1, VSG2, VSG3, VSG4, Wave HV and Filtek
TM

 Supreme flow 

were light-cured for 40s according by manufacturer. For the manipulation of the commercial 

material  Riva self-cure HV (GIC) the capsule was activated by pushing the plunger, placed the 

capsule in amalgamator Ultramat (4000-4800rpm)  for 10 seconds,removed the cap and placed 

it in Riva Applicator. The time working at 23°C was about 90 seconds (1'30 '') from the start of 

mixing.A small piece of the resin composite was placed between two polyethylene layers and 

pressed to form a very thin film, and the absorbance peaks of the uncured samples were 

obtained. 

The degree of conversion (DC) of the experimental and commercial materials was 

analyzed using the Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer 

(Nicolet 5700, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK). The spectra were assessed before 

and subsequent to light-activation (40s; 1h, 24h, 1, 3 and 6 months). The specimens were stored 

in PBS solution at 37°C before testing. All spectra were obtained in a range of 1800-1500 cm
-1

, 

with 64 scans at 4 cm
-1

 resolution in transmission mode and 2.8 mm/s mirror speed. The 

residual unreacted carbon-carbon double bond content (% C=C) was determined from the ratio 

of absorbance intensities of aliphatic C=C (peak at 1637 cm
-1

) against an internal standard 

(aromatic carbon-carbon bond peak at 1608 cm
-1

) before and 40s after starting the light-

activation. The radio between the peak heights of the aliphatic (1638cm
-1

) and aromatic 

(1608cm
-1

) carbon double bond absorptions for the cured and uncured material was used to 

calculate the DC according to the formula: DC= (1- polymerized/unpolymerized) x 100 

Prior to the spectroscopy analysis, the specimens were rinsed with distilled water for 30s 

and then air dried and polished. Degree of conversion was determined by subtracting the C=C% 

from 100 %. Data were subjected to variance analysis with two factors followed by Tukey’s test 

(p?0.05).

2.6 Flexural modulus (FM) and Elastic modulus (EM) 

 

The materials evaluated in this test were the same used to Degree of Conversion test. 

Specimens were manufactured according to ISO 4049 using a Teflon mould (2 mm x 2 mm x 25 

mm, N=70, n=10). Photoactivation was carried out with a halogen light-curing unit (850 

mW/cm
2
, Optilux-501, Demetron Kerr, Orange, USA) on five overlapping spots of Ø8mm (20s 

each) on both the upper and lower surfaces. Specimen edges were manually finished with #800, 

#1000-grif SiC paper. The specimens were stored in PBS solution at 37°C for 24h and 6 months. 

The specimens were submitted to three-point bending testing in a universal testing machine 

(Instron 5565; Instron, Canton, MA, USA), with a 6-mm span between the supports at a 

crosshead speed of 0.5mm min
-1

. The load at fracture and the specimen dimensions (determined 

individually using a digital calliper) were used to calculated the FM, according the formula: FM= 

3 x L x D/ 2 x w x h
2
 where: L is the load at fracture (N), D is the distance between the supports, 

w is the width, and h is the height of the specimen all in mm. The flexural modulus was 

monitored by the software in a computer attached to the testing machine, which showed a tension 

x deformation graph that allowed obtaining the elastic modulus.  

 

3. Results

soaked in PBS solution, remaining lower values when compared with other times. The same not 

happened to 1h time showing decrease in values after 1m storage (p?0.05). There was no 

statistical difference between the storage times to experimental groups (VSG2, VSG3 and VSG4) 

and commercial material (Wave).

3.3 Flexural modulus (FM) and Elastic modulus (EM) 

The means and SDs of flexural modulus (MPa) and elastic modulus (GPa) for each 

tested material are shown in Tables 8 and 9. According to the flexural strength data (Tab.7) the 

composite (Filtek Supreme flow) and the flowable resin composite (Wave) had the highest 

values in 24h, not statistically difference between them. Regarding the experimental flowable 

composite (VSG2, VSG3 and VSG4) showed statistically lower values comparing with the 

control group (VSG1), followed by the Riva material (self-cure glass ionomer cement). At 3 

months, the composite (Riva) showed a smaller result statistically different from the other 

materials. There was no statistical difference between both groups except for experimental 

flowable composite (VSG4) that showed statistically lower results. During six months the 

control group (VSG1) had the highest value without differ statistically from the experimental 

flowabe composite (VSG2) and flowable composite (Wave) (p?0.05) which did not differ 

from the composite (Filtek Z350XT). The experimental flowable composites (VSG3 and 

VSG4) did not differ statistically as well as the composite Filtek Supreme flow. The Riva 

material shows a smaller result statistically different between both groups. 

According to the elastic modulus data (Tab.8) the composite (Filtek Supreme flow) and 

the flowable resin composite (Wave) had the highest values in 24h, statistically difference 

between them. Regarding the experimental flowable composite (VSG3) and Riva showed 

statistically lower values. At 3 months, there was no statistically difference between all groups 

tested. Regarding the experimental flowable composite (VSG1 and VSG2) and the composite

different between both groups. When was analysed the elastic modulus values in the same 

group during all time storage, the experimental flowable composite (VSG1) not showed 

statistically difference between 24h and 6 months to lower values  during 3 months. The 

experimental material (VSG2) showed statistically difference between 3 and 6 months

their values during 6 months. Highest values (p?0.05) was obtained to flowable resin 

composite (Wave) during 6 months, the same composite showed statistically different between 

24h months. The resin composite (Filtek Supreme flow) showed statistically different between 

the all storage period. 

 

4. Discussion 

The hypothesis that calcium phosphate used as a filler in experimental flowable 

composites interfere on the mechanical properties was confirmed. The highest hardness value 

obtained in the region of interface for the control group (VSG1), once that this material had not 

phosphate in their composition, can be justified by the higher amount of fillers in their 

composition (50%wt of barium glass) which gives a lower light penetration and consequently 

lower monomers conversion. In relation the decrease values after 6 months when analysed the  

composite region can be attributed to polymer hydrolisis and the swelling tension induced by 

water (36). The swelling and the hydrolysis degradation process is also inflluenced by type, 

shape and surface treatment of the filler used within the composition of experimental flowable 

composite (37, 38). Indeed, durign water-induced swelling, the resin matrix decreases the 

cohesive forces within the polymer chains, generating tensile tensions on the bonding interface 

between silane coupling agent and fillers (39). This latter phenomenon may induce filler de-

bonding and contribute to the reduction of the KHN of resin composites after prolonged water 

immersion (36-38, 40). Generally, optimum silane coverage of filler particles increases the 

resistance of the material to hydrolytic degradation (42).  However, in prolonged exposure to an 

aqueous environment such as 4 weeks according Marovic et al., 2014 (43), hydrolytic 

degradation of composite materials can be associated with the hydrolysis of the silane layer of 

the silica particles (22). In this study, the specimens were storage in PBS solution during 6 

months, time enough that this could have been a hydrolytic degradation of the silane layer of 

experimental materials. The size of the particles in nano range also means that there is a larger 

filler surface area covered with silane, which is susceptible to degradation and an extra pathway 

is opened up for water diffusion, especially if they are agglomerated (43).  

The degree of conversion is the percentage of carbonic double bonds (C = C) converted 

to single bonds (C-C) during curing to form a polymeric resin. As the higher DC, better the 



  43  
 

mechanical and wear resistance. It seems that reducing filler content together with increasing 

filler size plays a crucial role in achieving higher translucency of bulk-fill resin composites. The 

amount of light transmitted through a composite material depends on the amount of scattered 

and absorbed light. Light scattering is increased in materials with a large filler-matrix interface 

area, due to differences in the refractive index between filler particles and resin matrix (47). 

Thus, the higher values of DC presented to the VSG4 material (Tab. 6) during the first 40 

seconds, 24h, 3 and 6 months, refer to the lower amount of fillers in their composition (20%wt 

of barium glass) which gives a greater light penetration and consequently greater monomers 

conversion. The same result was obtained with the experimental material VSG3 (which has 

30% filler particle) during the first month. Similar to the values found to Filtek Supreme 

flow.According to the literature, despite the inorganic particles of composite resin are more 

related to wear resistance properties and radiopacity characteristics of the material, many 

authors make a correlation between the degree of conversion and the size and heterogeneity 

particles. According to Ruyter &amp;amp; Osayed (1982) (56), the light scattering that occurs within the 

composite caused by charged particles is inversely proportional to the particle diameter and 

directly proportional to their refraction index. Another author Asmussen, 1982 (57, 58), 

confirmed these findings where small diameter particles loading lead to lower depth of cure, 

increased number of double bonds and therefore lower degree of conversion. It was used on this 

study the same type of filler particle, differing only on the concentration. 

The flexural strength is related to the force at which the beam fails and the sample 

geometry and the flexural modulus is an indication of the stiffness of the beam and is 

determined by measuring the deformation of the beam as the force is initially applied (19). 

Modulus of elasticity has a crucial role in the deformability of a material under masticatory 

stresses. A material with a low modulus is desired for restorations in cervical areas (59). 

However, when placed in posterior regions, it will deform more readily under occlusal forces 

(19). According to ISO 4049 test methods (2009) has set 80 MPa as the minimum flexural 

strength for resin-based restorative materials involving outer occlusal surfaces. Moreau et al., 

2012 (60) reported in their studies that the flexural strength for a traditional composite after 14 

days of immersion is 30-40 MPa. When used CaP fillers this flexural strength had higher 

flexural strengths of 70-110 MPa after 90 days of immersion, and 50-70 MPa after 2 years of 



  44  
 

immersion. All of the flowable materials tested in this study as the commercial materials 

exceeded this value (Tab.7). 

A recente study investigating experimental composite materials with various loads 

of silanized nanoparticles found a positive correlation between the filler mass fraction and the 

FM (63). The exception was the material with 50wt% of silica, which had statistically lower FM 

than the material with 40wt% of filler. This effect is explained by the tendency of silica to 

agglomaration. The agglomerated particles were identified as strength controlling flaws which 

initiated crack and consequently lead to the fracture (63). On the other hand, if not 

agglomerated, large surface to volume ratio of silanized sílica particles improves interface 

bonding and thus the resistance to fracture. In this study it was observed that the experimental 

materials with a lower percentage by weight of filler particle (barium aluminum silicate glass 

silanized) had the lowest values of bending in the period of 24h, 3 and 6 month. Disagreeing 

with the results (63) when referring to the material with 50 wt% silica, which obtained low 

values, which did not occur in this assessment regarding the control group (0% phosphate and 

50% load) and VSG2 (10% phosphate and 40% load) which showed higher flexural strength 

after 6 months.  

Despite achieve of minimum ISO flexural strength requirements, it is still recommended 

that flowable materials be restricted to minimal or adjunctive clinical situations. The properties 

of resin composites depend primarily on the material composition. A correlation exists between 

filler content and mechanical properties, particularly for elastic modulus (64):  the higher the 

filler content, the higher the modulus and the greater the resistance to deformation. Conversely, 

the lower the filler content, the greater the polymerization shrinkage and the lower the ability to 

resist to deformation. The best compromise for most restorations appears to be a fine hybrid 

resin composite with a flexural modulus of approximately 10 GPa (65). The experimental 

flowable composites showed stiffness values ranging from 0.8 to 1.7 GPa. This suggests that 

some groups are not sufficiently rigid to withstand significant occlusal forces when used in 

bulk, once that the best value estimated for most hybrid composites is a flexural modulus of 

approximately 10 GPa (65). Thus, the experimental materials VSG1 and VSG2 appear to be the 

most suitable materials for withstand significant occlusal forces when used in bulk, with values 

near to Filtek Supreme flow. The groups VSG1 and VSG2 has in its composition higher filler 

content, namely 50% and 40% compared to the other groups.

5. Conclusion 

 

It is concluded that the use of calcium phosphate as fillers affect the mechanical 

properties in some tests after aging, by contrast, there was an increase in some mechanical 

properties tests. The experimental material VSG4 showed high values in the interface after 6 

months of storage in PBS solution, suggesting a bioremineralization. High flexural strength 

values were found for the experimental material VSG2 well as the commercial material Wave. 

Higher elasticity modulus was obtained for the experimental material VSG4, similar values to 

the commercial Filtek Supreme flow.

CAPÍTULO 3 

Bond strength resin-dentin, micropermeability and nanoleakage of a new resin 

composite using biomimetic analogs 

The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of bioactive calcium phosphate in 

experimental flowable composite and their correlation with the bond strength and 

furthermore evaluated the micropermeability and nanoleakage in hybrid layer. Four 

experimental materials containing bioactive phosphate (MCPM, ?TCP) and calcium 

hydroxide were formulated (VSG1-0% phosphate, VSG2-10% phosphate, VSG3- 20% 

phosphate and VSG4-30% phosphate). Furthermore, specific primer/conditioner was also 

developed by using sodium tri-metaphosphate and polyacrylic acid which was served as a 

biomimetic analogs. The dentin specimens were randomly divided into four groups 

according to the composition (n=5) and submitted to microtensile bond strength, 

nanoleakage evaluation and confocal-micropermeability (CLSM). According the 

microtensile results, interactions between factors were no significant (p?0.05). The failure 

mode analysis presented adhesive and cohesive failure in resin for the all groups in 24h and 6 

months. The silver uptake within the resin-dentin interface showed a lower deposition 

restricted on the basis the hybrid layer to the VSG2 and VSG4 group after 6 months. CLSM 

(reflection/fluorescence) of the resin-dentin interface showed moderate micropermeability 

between dentin and hybrid layer specially localized at the bottom of the rhodamine and 

nanoleakage signs at the hybrid layer in 24h to the (VSG1), (VSG2 and VSG3) group. After 

prolonged 6 months, the CLMS image showed lower micropermeability between dentin and 

hybrid layer and nanoleakage signs at the hybrid layer. A lower micropermeability was 

observed to group VSG4 in 24h and 6 month. Data were subjected to variance analysis with 

two factors and Tukey’s test (? = 0.05). The inclusion of calcium phosphate -based micro-

fillers within the composition of resin flowable composite and the use of metaphosphates in 

specific self-etching primer might promote a therapeutic mineral deposition within the resin-

dentin interface. The experimental material VSG3 and VSG4 were the most promising to 

promote remineralization in dentin interface / resin.

1. Introduction  

Resin-dentin bonds are less durable than resin-enamel bonds (1), because dentin 

bonding relies on organic components.  Bond durability is critical for the longevity of 

restoratives, because degradation can weaken adhesion and lead to gaps between teeth and 

restoratives (2). One of the reasons that leading to loss of the union is the incomplete 

permeation of resin monomers within of the hybrid layer by fluid movement within the dentinal 

tubule anastomosis complex during resin infiltration (3). Thus, the exposed collagen fibrils 

resulting from incomplete resin infiltration cannot be protected against denaturation challenges 

and are susceptible to creep or cyclic fatigue rupture after prolonged function (4, 5). These 

denuded collagen matrices are also filled with water, which serves as a functional medium for 

the hydrolysis of resin matrices by esterases and collagen by endogenous and exogenous 

collagenolytic enzymes. Even when water-rich, resin-sparse collagen fibrils can be prevented 

from degradation, the mechanical properties of these denuded collagen fibrils are far inferior to 

those of resin-infiltrated collagen or mineralized collagen(6). These issues are the critical 

barriers to future progress in dentin bonding. 

Biomimetic mineralization is a proof-of-concept strategy that utilizes nanotechnology 

principles to mimic what occurs in biomineralization (7). This strategy replaces water from 

resin-sparse regions of the hybrid layer with apatite crystallites that are small enough to occupy 

the extrafibrillar and intrafibrillar compartments of the collagen matrix, and has been adopted 

for remineralization of resin-dentin interface (8). By restoring the enzyme exclusion and 

fossilization properties of mineralized dentin, this proof-of-concept strategy is capable of 

preserving the longevity of resin-dentin bonds (9-11). 

Partial demineralization of mineralized collagen matrix by acids derived from bacteria or 

dentin bonding procedures creates the seed crystallites necessary for this top-down 

remineralization approach. The orientation of those remineralized crystalline lattices is pre-

determined by the lattice of the original seed crystallites. However, remineralization does not 

occur in locations where seed crystallites are absent, as demonstrated with the use of a glass-



  59  
 

ionomer cement (9-11). This limitation severely restricts the apatite-sparse hybrid layers created 

by etch-and-rinse and moderately aggressive self-etch adhesives to be remineralized with a 

conventional top-down approach. During biomineralization, there are no apatite seed crystallites 

present in an organic scaffold. Consequently, biomineralization has to proceed via an alternative 

pathway that involves homogeneous nucleation. One of the mechanisms of homogeneous 

nucleation involves sequestration of the amorphous mineral phase by polyanionic extracellular 

matrix protein molecules. Additional acidic matrix phosphoproteins are utilized as templates to 

induce mineral nucleation and growth within the organic scaffold (12). 

Thus, two biomimetic analogs (sequestration and templating) must be utilized in concert 

to reproduce the dimension and hierarchy of the apatite crystallites that are found in natural 

mineralized dentin. Both hybrid layers created by etch-and-rinse adhesives (13) and self-etch 

adhesives (14) have been shown to be remineralizable with a biomimetic mineralization 

approach.For etch-and-rinse adhesives, apatite crystallites can be detected in both extrafibrillar 

and intrafibrillar spaces, since denuded collagen matrices are present within those hybrid layers. 

It is amazing how strikingly similar the remineralized part of the hybrid layer is when compared 

with hybrid layers that have undergone degradation after aging. For self-etch adhesives, apatite 

deposition is almost exclusively identified from the intrafibrillar spaces, indicating that the 

extrafibrillar spaces are better infiltrated by adhesive resins. In addition, water-filled spaces 

within the adhesive layers of some adhesives are also filled by apatite nanocrystals (9-11, 14).  

Unlike the conventional top-down remineralization approach that proceeds rapidly via 

epitaxial growth over existing seed crystallites, biomimetic remineralization is a slower process, 

since it involves at least two kinetically driven pathways and usually takes 3-4 months to 

complete. Thus, it is important to prevent the collagen matrix from degrading while it is being 

remineralized. In a proof-of-concept biomimetic remineralization strategy, polyvinylphosphonic 

acid has been shown to possess MMP-inhibiting properties that prevent collagen degradation 

during remineralization (15, 16). 

It has been stated that  CaP likely plays a special role as a precursor to bioapatite and as 

a transient phase in biomineralization (26). In solutions, CaP is readily converted to stable 

crystalline phases such as apatitic products. A variety of proteins and ions have been proposed 

to be involved in the biomineralization of CaP to HA (10, 11, 28-30). Of all the biologically 

important calcium phosphates is the most researched because their stoichiometry and high 



  60  
 

release of calcium and phosphate ions in aqueous media exhibiting the most rapid conversion to 

HA. Recently was developed polymeric dental composites (31-35) that utilized these CaP 

properties to remineralize bovine enamel lesions in vitro (32). However, as currently 

formulated, these bioactive CaP composites have relatively low mechanical strength and 

adhesiveness to teeth. To improve their mechanical properties while maintaining sustained 

release of Ca and PO4 ions, the researches have so far focused on: (a) synthesizing CaP fillers 

with structurally incorporated silica and/or zirconia, (b) developing surface-modified hybrid 

CaP fillers amenable to treatment by silane coupling agents (33, 35, 36), and (c) exploring the 

effects of polymer matrix composition on the mechanical and physico-chemical properties of 

CaP composites (31-35).  

The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of bioactive calcium phosphate 

(MCPM and ?TCP) as a filler in experimental flowable composite on dentin bond strength and 

furthermore evaluated the micropermeability and nanoleakage in hybrid layer, once that was 

used sodium tri-metaphosphate in specific self-primer. The first and second hypothesis was that 

the presence of calcium-phosphate modified the adhesive properties, and the presence of 

metaphosphates in specific primer failed to induce remineralization in the hybrid layer subjected 

to degradation after aging, indicating that the water-filled spaces inside the adhesive layers were 

not filled by apatite nanocrystals, generated by the use of sodium tri-metaphosphate.

The resin matrix for all formulations can be showed in Table 1. Each composite was 

loaded with MCPM (Monocalcium phosphate monohydrate [Sharlau, Spain], ?TCP (?-

Tricalcium phosphate [Fluka, Germany] and Calcium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) (Tab.2). Each 

group had received a different concentration related to phosphates and calcium hydroxide 

powder (0wt%, 10wt%, 20wt% and 30wt%). After this, was added Ba-Al-silicate glass (FGM, 

Joinvile, SC, Brazil) powder at a concentration of (50wt%, 40wt% 30wt% and 20wt%) for each 

experimental group (Tab. 3). Then a resin matrix was added in the end by 50wt%. The 

experimental self-etching primer were obtained can be showed in Table 4.

Forty caries-free third human molars extracted for surgical reasons under a protocol 

approved by an institutional review board (ref. 150/2012) were used in this study (n=5) (20 

teeth-24h and 20 teeth-6m). The teeth were stored in deionised water (pH 7.1) at 4°C, for 24h 

and 6 months. Coronal dentin specimens were prepared by sectioning the roots 1mm beneath 

the cement-enamel junction (CEJ) using a hard tissue microtome (Isomet 11/180; Buehler, 

Coventry, UK) equipped with a diamond blade (XL-12205; Benetec, London, UK). The smear 

layer-covered middle coronal dentin was exposed by removing the occlusal enamel with a 

parallel cut and by a polishing treatment using a 600-grit SiC paper for 1 min under continuous 

water irrigation.  

The bonded-dentin specimens were submitted to a simulated pulpal pressure method (SPP). 

The simulation of the hydrostatic pulpal pressure was accomplished as previously described por 

Feitosa et al., 2012 (17-19). This method is shown in Fig. 1. 

2.4 Dentin pre-treatment and bonding procedures 

 

  The self-etching primer was applied vigorously for 30s on prepared surfaces dentin with 

microbrush and solvent evaporated with compressed air for 10 seconds. The experimental 

flowable composites (according to each experimental group) were used to build-up (3 layers – 

1mm each). Each composite layer was light-cured for a period of 20s using a quartz-tungsten-

halogen lamp (Optilux-501; Kerr) and the last coat was light-cured for 40s with light intensity 

of 850 mW / cm². 

 

2.5  Microtensile bond strength test (µTBS) 

 

Resin-bonded teeth were sectioned in small resin-dentin beams (1mm
2
) suitable for the 

microtensile bond strength. After 24h and 6 months in PBS solution storage, the resin-bonded 



  62  
 

specimens from each group were sectioned using a hard tissue microtome (Buehler, UK) in both 

x and y directions across the bonding interface obtaining beams with cross-sectional areas of 

1mm
2
. The beams obtained peripherally including enamel were excluded from the µTBS test.  

The beams tested after 24h and 6 months immersion in PBS solution (37°C). After this time, 

the beams were glued to a jig with a cyanoacrylate gel (Super bonder gel; Loctite Henkel, 

Rocky Hill, CT, USA) and were subjected to tensile load in a SMAC LAL300 linear actuator 

testing machine (SMAC Ltd., West Sussex, UK) with a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The 

force required to break the adhesive bond was recorded in MPa. The µTBS data were subjected 

to variance analysis with two factors and Tukey’s test (? = 0.05%).  

 

2.5.1 Failure mode analysis and scanning electron microscopy ultra-morphology 

Subsequent to the ?TBS tests each failed beam was evaluated by stereomicroscopy (Kyowa 

Optical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with a 60 × 0.75 objective, for assessment of the mode and 

locus of tensile failure. The mode of failure of the fractured specimens was determined and 

classified as follows: Type A: Adhesive failure at the interface among resin composite, adhesive 

resin and hybrid layer; Type B: Mixed failure. Both adhesive and cohesive failures observed in 

the same fractured stick; Type C: Cohesive failure in resin; Type D: Cohesive failure in dentin 

Five representative samples exhibiting the most frequently observed failure pattern (i.e. 

mixed or cohesive) and the ?TBS close to the mean, were prepared for scanning electron 

microscopy (SEM) ultra-morphology analysis. The parts of the fractured samples were paired 

and mounted on aluminum stubs, coated with gold (Balzers SCD 050 sputter coater, B.U.A. 

Co., Fürstentum, Germany) and examined by SEM, JSM-5600LV (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), 

operated at 15 kV, with 20 mm as work distance. 

2.6  Nanoleakage evaluation 

 

 Three central beams (n=12) were selected from the teeth of each group and processed for 

nanoleakage assessment as previously described by Tay et al., 2002 (17). In brief, the beams 

were immersed in 50wt% ammoniacal silver nitrate [Ag(NH3)
2
]NO3 (aq) solution in total 

darkness for 24h. Subsequently, the specimens were rinsed in H2O to remove the excess silver 

nitrate and then immersed in a photo-developing solution for 8h under UV-light (60 cm from 



  63  
 

the specimens) to reduce silver ions into metallic silver grains along the resin-dentin interface. 

The silver-impregnated beams will be included in epoxy resin and wet-polished using #600, 

#1200, #2000 SiC papers and diamond pastes (Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL, USA) 6, 3, 1 and 0.25 

µm. The specimens were ultrasonically cleaned for 20min after each abrasive/polishing step. 

Finally, they were air-dried, dehydrated overnight, coated with carbon and observed using a 

SEM (JSM-5600LV; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) in backscattered electron mode. 

 

2.7 Confocal micropermeability evaluation (CLSM) 

Four specimens for each group (two specimens- 24h and two specimens-6 months) were 

prepared as previously described and prepared for confocal micropermeability evaluation (18). 

The resin bonded dentin specimens to evaluate the features of micropermeability along the 

interface were prepared with 1g of resin blend without metaphosphate and fillers was mixed 

with Rhodamine-B (0.1wt%) (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO, USA).  The resin blend labeled 

with Rhodamine-B was applied in the first coat and light-cured for 20s. The experimental 

flowable composites were used to perform the build-up (3 layers – 1mm each).  Briefly, the 

evaluation of micropermeability of resin–dentin interfaces was performed using a 0.1wt% dye 

water/ethanol (50v%/50v%) solution (FITC- fluorescein isothiocyanate; Sigma-Aldrich). This 

fluorescent dye was used to trace the water-filled spaces and the sealing ability from the pulp 

chamber through the tubules to the resin–dentin interface for 3 h at 37°C able to covalently bind 

collagen. 

The specimens were subsequently cut into 1 mm slabs, slightly polished with wet 1200 

SiC-grit paper and ultra-sonicated for 5 min. Three slabs from each specimen were selected for 

confocal microscopy (6 slabs/group). Three images were obtained from each slice resulting in 

nine images per specimen and 18 images per group. These images were intended to be 

representative of the most common features regarding the micropermeability observed along the 

interfaces. 

The microscopy examination was performed using a laser confocal scanning microscope 

(CLSM: Leica SP2 CLSM, Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with a 63x/1.4 NA oil immersion 

lens using 514 nm argon/helium ion laser illumination both in reflection and fluorescence mode. 

The fluorescein was excited at 488-nm, while Rhodamine was used at 568-nm krypton laser. 

A\Reflected and fluorescence signals were detected with a photomultiplier tube to a depth of 



  64  
 

20 ?m and then converted to single-projection images for better visualization and qualitative 

analysis (18). 

3. Results 

3.1 Microtensile bond strength test (µTBS) 

Interactions between factors were no significant (p?0.05). Material (experimental 

composite with different concentrations of phosphate) and storage time (24h and 6 months) no 

influenced the µTBS results. Mean (±S.D.) µTBS of the resin-bonded dentin tested in this study 

are shown in Tab. 5.  

3.2 Failure mode and SEM ultra-morphological analysis  

The failure mode analysis is presented in Tab. 6 and Fig. 2 and showed adhesive failure 

(Type A) and cohesive failure in resin (Type C). The control group (VSG1) in 24h showed 

failure mode adhesive (80.39%) and cohesive failure in resin (17.65%). However, after 6 

months the failured mode showed 63.38% to 32.39% adhesive and cohesive failure in resin, 

besides 2.82% mixed failure (Type B). High percentage of adhesive failure mode (95.83%) 

occurred in 24h to the experimental group (VSG2-10% phosphate) and 4.17% cohesive failure 

in resin. At 6 months, the failure mode showed adhesive (46.25%) and cohesive failure in 

resin (53.75%). For the experimental group (VSG3- 20% phosphate) was observed (69.84%) 

failure mode adhesive and cohesive failure in resin (30.16%) during 24h. After 6 months, the 

samples showed (62.07% to 37.93%) failure mode adhesive and cohesive failure in resin. The 

experimental group (VSG4-30% phosphate), in 24h, showed (47.06% to 50.98%) failure mode 

adhesive and cohesive failure in resin. After 6 months, the SEM analysis detected (48.21% to 

51.79%) failure mode adhesive and cohesive failures in resin. 

 Evaluating only the cohesive failure in resin, the experimental group VSG2 at 6 months 

had 53.75% failures mode compared to 4.17% in 24 hours. The group VSG3 remained their 

values near each other in relation to the storage period (30.16% and 37.93% in 24 hours and 

after 6 months). The same situation occurred to the experimental group VSG4 with values 

from 50.98% and 51.79% in 24h and 6 months. Relating these failures with the control group 

(VSG1) in the period of 6 months (32.39%), it is seen that the values from the other groups 

approached and /or increased for this type C failure mode (Cohesive failure in resin). 



  65  
 

The photomicrographs showing the fractures types that occurred at the interfaces of the 

experimental groups studied are illustrated in Fig. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. 

 

3.3 Nanoleakage evaluation  

 The nanoleakage patterns observed during the SEM analysis are illustrated in Fig. 9, 

10, 11 and 12. The silver uptake within the resin-dentin interfaces stored in PBS solution 

for 24h and 6 months showed for experimental group (VSG1) the presence of silver metalic 

grains on the basis the hybrid layer but not in the rest of the hybrid layer, indicating non-

uniform nanoleakage. During the 6 months were observed moderate amount silver metalic 

grains in parts of the hybrid layer (Fig. 9). A large silver deposit within the layer composite 

close to the adhesive layer was observed in the material (VSG2). At 6 months the amount 

of silver metallic grains was visually lower compared to deposition in the sample of 24 h 

and restricted on the basis the hybrid layer (Fig. 10). The highest silver uptake was 

observed for the material (VSG3 and VSG4) with intense silver deposits filling hybrid and 

adhesive layer. During the 6 months were observed a lower amount silver metallic grains 

on the basis of the hybrid layer and on top of the adhesive layer (Fig. 11 and 12). 

 

3.3 Confocal micropermeability evaluation (CLSM) 

CLSM single projections (reflection/fluorescence) after 24h and 6 months of the 

resin-dentin interfaces created using the self-etching primer with sodium trimetaphosphate 

and polyacrylic acid in PBS storage are illustrated in Fig. 13-16. 

 

4. Discussion 

The results of this study showed no statistical difference to the microtensile test (p 

?0.05), between 24 hours and 6 months (Tab.5). In this case the first hypothesis that the 

presence of calcium-phosphate would change the adhesive properties was confirmed. These 

results were supported by the analysis of the failure mode (SEM) which showed that the storage 

induced adhesive failures (Fig. 2).  



  66  
 

This phenomenom may have occurred due to the inability of such materials to 

completely replace loosely bound and bulk-free water from the apatite-depleted dentin collagen 

matrix during bonding procedures (19, 20). The wetness of dentin surfaces, the presence of 

pulpal pressure, and the thickness of dentin are extremely important variables during bonding 

procedures, especially when testing bond strength of adhesive materials in vitro within the 

intention of simulating in vivo conditions (21-26).  

The application of simulated pulpal pressure obviously increases convective fluid 

movement and reveals through-and-through water-channels through some, but not all, 

polymerized resins, that connect underlying dentin with the outer adhesive surface (23-25, 27). 

These water-filled channels are potential sites of hydrolytic degradation that may adversely 

affect the longevity of restorations bonded. The presence of simulated physiological pulpal 

pressure through hybrid and adhesive layers may provide more polymer hydrolysis and 

plasticisation jeopardising the long-term durability of resin-dentin-interfaces (28-32). 

Some authors contend that a relative degree of nanoleakage correlates with dentin 

remineralization (19). The etiology of tubular occlusion by apatite crystallites, has been 

described as "dissolution and re-precipitation" mechanism where the deposited crystals on 

hybrid layer occlude the dentinal tubules (21). Comparing the control group (0% phosphate- 

VSG1) after 6 months with the other experimental materials (10%-VSG2, 20%-VSG3 and 30% 

phosphate-VSG4) it was visually observed a lower amount metallic silver deposited on the 

hybrid layer to these materials, suggesting that the dentinal tubules were partially occluded by 

apatite crystals. As the calcium phosphate concentrations were different for each experimental 

group, those groups with higher concentration of such elements showed lower deposition of 

silver grains in the hybrid layer (Fig. 11, 12).  

The micropermeability of resin-bonded dentin can be seen using confocal laser scanning 

microscopy (CLSM), a technique that involving the filtration of a fluorescente dye from the 

pulp chamber into the resin-dentin interface into the pulp chamber of extracted resin-bonded 

teeth (18, 20) without the need to immerse specimens in fluorophores or silver nitrate solution. 

This analysis reveals the microporosity and pathways for water permeability in the hybrid layer 

before and after remineralization (18, 21, 22).  

CLMS images of the resin-dentin interface showed a thick hybrid layer completely 

infiltrated by fluorescein due to imperfect resin infiltration within the demineralised collagen 



  67  
 

matrix and some resin-tags penetration several microns into the dentinal tubules to the 

VSG1,VSG2 and VSG3 group during 24h (Fig. 13- A1, 14-B1, 15-C1) result of increased resin-

infiltrated demineralized dentin collagen and degradation of the interface after PSB storage. 

After 6 months, the interfaces showed a lower micropermeability (Fig. 13-B2, 14-C2 and 15-

D2).This sight of degradation might have, additionally, resulted from the slightly acidic 

environment promoted by the permanent release of H+ from the acidic monomers (GDMAP 

and polyacrylic acid), and by the precipitation reaction of the brushite (phosphate and calcium), 

which caused a long-standing, MMP-mediated degradation of collagen (23).  

 It has been reported that supersaturated calcium (Ca) phosphate (P) solutions have little 

effectiveness, per se, to induce dentin remineralization. A possible explanation for this feature 

may be due to mineral precipitation (Ca, P) within the organic matrix by the metaphosphates 

(sodium trimetaphosphate and polyacrilic acid) reducing the micropermeability as occured in 

the experimental materials VSG2, VSG3 and VGS4, whereas for VSG3 and VSG4 groups this 

decrease was more pronounced. The new semi-permeable physical barrier created at the bottom 

of the hybrid layer hindered the penetration of the green dye throughout the hybrid layer, and 

remained located not beyond this area. Short resin tags were, additionally, observed indicating 

the formation of some partical seal and an increase in calcification in dentin tubules (24).  

Mineral crystallites remaining within the collagen after partial demineralisation might 

have acted as seed sites for apatite growth (25). The polyacrylic acid and the acidic monomer 

(GDMAP) represents the most aggressive conditioning of dentin that was considered in the 

present research, that dissolved a big part of both the extrafibrillar and the intrafibrillar mineral, 

in extension and depth, increasing the difficulty of resin infiltration throughout this 

demineralisation front, showing high ratios of micropermeability as a consequence of the poor 

resin-infiltrated demineralised dentin collagen, comprising the stability of this interface, over 

time  (26).  

It is well known that the increase in environment pH and the presence of free OH
-
 may 

facilitate apatite nucleation and reduce the solubility of intermediate Ca/P species formed during 

the aging period (27). The most appropriate pH to support the formation of stoichiometric 

hydroxyapatite (HA) in vitro (27) and in vivo  (28) falls in range between 8 and 9. At higher pH 

it is common to obtain a Ca-deficient HA (lower solubility then stoichiometric hydroxyapatite) 



  68  
 

characterized by higher concentration of PO4
3-

 and lower Ca
2+

 ions  (29-31). Thus, the second 

hypothesis was confirmed. 

5. Conclusion 

According the limitations of this study the conclusions were: 

- the calcium phosphate addition as a filler particles not affected the bond strength, 

- the use of metaphosphate in self-etching primers promoted mineral deposition on  

resin-dentin interface.

Fig. 1- Schematic drawing depicting the "SPP" means simulated pulpal pressure. The resin-

bonded teeth were covered with two coats of nail varnish at resin-enamel border to avoid 

water seepage through this margin; hence, the passage of water was possible only through 

dentinal tubules. The specimens were glued and positioned sideways on the lid of a 

cylindrical receptacle. The pulp chamber of each specimen and the receptacle were filled 

with PBS solution, sealed and turned upside down. The samples had a 20cm water column 

over them. The simulated water pressure was maintained for 6 months.

CONSIDERAÇÕES GERAIS 

 

Um dos primeiros cristais que se formam mediante os métodos de remineralização é 

o di-cálcio fosfato dihidrato (DCPD), que pode ser formado a partir de um meio ácido (pH 

4,2), moléculas de orto-fosfato de cálcio disponíveis e água. Este cristal DCPD (ou bruxita) 

é um dos mais solúveis cristais de apatita, porém ele pode fornecer um modelo de pré-

nucleação para a formação dos cristais de hidroxiapatita. A bruxita pode ser formada por 

meio da mistura equimolar de beta-tri-cálcio fosfato (?-TCP) e mono-cálcio fosfato mono-

hidratado (MCFM) (29). A partir de uma nucleação e estabilização dos cristais de bruxita, 

os cristais de DCPD podem se transformar em cristais com estrutura mais organizada 

(menos solúveis) e mais parecidas àquela da hidroxiapatita (Ca10(PO4)6OH2). Assim a 

presença de pó de fosfato de cálcio bioativo (MCPM e ?-TCP) adaptados como partículas 

de carga nos compósitos fluídos experimentais em contato com as superfícies de dentina 

desmineralizada induziu à formação de cristais de hidroxiapatita a partir da presença de 

bandas de fosfato v1, v3 (PO4
3
) e apatita  carbonatada (v2) (CO3

2
) como visto no Capítulo 1. 

Além disso, foi detectado a presença de cristais de bruxita pela presença de bandas (vOH). 

Estas bandas foram detectadas  ao longo do tempo independente da porcentagem de fosfato 

de cálcio e presença de água destilada e/ou solução tamponada (PBS). A presença de picos 

referentes às bandas de fosfatos (v1, v3)  e apatita carbonatada  (v2) no grupo controle  

VSG1-  0% fosfato durante os primeiros  7 dias e 3 meses de imersão é justificada por 

armazenar as amostras em solução salina tamponada com cloreto de sódio, fosfato de sódio, 

cloreto de potássio e fosfato de potássio, assim, o ambiente fica sobressaturado com íons de 

cálcio e fornece um meio propício para a nucleação da apatita. 

Uma vez detectado a presença de apatita carbonatada e bruxita nas amostras 

desmineralizadas, foi realizado uma análise em EDX  (Capítulo 1) a partir de novas 

amostras de dentina. Nesse caso, a superfície coronária foi tratada com um primer 

autocondicionante o qual continha em sua composição ácido poliacrílico e trimetafosfato de 

sódio. O objetivo foi verificar a presença de depósitos de fosfato de cálcio na interface 

remineralizada  a  profundidade de aprox. 80?m. A relação Ca/P não mostrou diferença 

estatística entre os grupos. Os cristais de apatita carbonatada (Ca)10 (PO4,HPO4 (CO3)6 

(OH,Cl)2 são semelhantes à hidroxiapatita mineral (Ca10 (PO4)6(OH)2 (30). Assim, quando 



  92  
 

se compara a quantidade de Ca por molécula em ambas as fórmulas nota-se que a molécula 

de  HA (hidroxiapatita) tem 60 átomos de Ca em comparação com 10 átomos do cristal de 

apatita carbonatada. Desse modo, a relação Ca / P na área remineralizada de acordo com a 

dados obtidos sugerem que o número desses elementos foram os mesmos, não havendo 

diferença entre os grupos, o que poderia levar a uma diferença no processo de 

remineralização,uma vez que foi utilizado diferentes concentrações de fosfatos favorecendo 

maior ou menor ação desses elementos no processo de nucleação.  

A remineralização do colágeno ocorre por aposição dos cristais recentemente 

formados, havendo assim a necessidade de incorporar um agente terapêutico que ajude e 

sirva de guia para que os cristais alcancem os substratos mais profundos da rede colagênica 

desmineralizada.  Esses agentes são os análogos biomiméticos que simulam a ação das 

fosfoproteínas dentárias que guiam os fosfatos de cálcio durante a formação dentária. 

Existem dois tipos de análogos: aqueles que guiam os íons de fosfatos de cálcio para a 

cristalização a partir da pré-nucleação (ácido poliacrílico) e aqueles que ligam as proteínas  

do colágeno com o material em cristalização (ácido polivinil fosfônico e o trimetafosfato de 

sódio). Assim, tem-se não somente um mecanismo de remineralização, como também 

análogos que guiam a bioremineralização. A partir disso foi utilizado um primer contendo 

ácido poliacrílico e trimetafosfato de sódio em sua composição. 

O fosfato monocálcico mono-hidratado (MCPM) (Ca(H2)PO4)2H20) e fosfato 

tricálcico Ca3(PO4)2 são sais de cálcio que, na presença do monômero acídico (GDMAP) é 

hidrolisado pela aceleração destes monómeros (isto é, a molécula de água presente na 

composição química do MCPM é “quebrada” liberando radicais hidroxila). Portanto, a água 

disponível para a reação provém da dentina e da solução salina tamponada (PBS). Assim, 

esta água irá reagir com ambos os sais de fosfato de cálcio formando DCPD (bruxita). 

Quando utilizado ácido poliacrílico e análogos biomimética (isto é, trimetafosfato de sódio) 

em primers autocondicionantes, o ácido tem a capacidade de inibir a nucleação da apatita 

antes da entrada nos compartimentos de colágeno interfibrilar intrafibrilar. O trimetafosfato 

de sódio sofre quelação com os íons de cálcio. Assim, a adição de hidróxido de cálcio, 

juntamente com os fosfatos de cálcio (MCPM) e (BTCP) têm a ação de supersaturar o meio 

com cálcio. Assim, o trimetafosfato de sódio irá se unir com o cálcio saturado e o ácido 

poliacrílico inibe a nucleação da apatita de cálcio antes dos mesmos entrarem  nos 



  93  
 

compartimentos de colágeno, ou seja, a  apatita se liga ao cálcio gerando cristais de apatita 

carbonatada. 

Algumas pesquisas têm revelado que a incorporação de fosfatos bioativos em 

compósitos odontológicos (31-36) apresentam baixa resistência mecânica (32, 36) e 

adesividade aos dentes. Um meio para melhorar  estas propriedades e manter a liberação de 

íons de Ca e PO4 é a sinterização das partículas de carga com sílica e/ou zircônia e  

desenvolvimento de partículas de carga passíveis de  tratamento por agentes silano (33, 34, 

37). Assim utilizou-se na referida pesquisa vidro de bário alumínio silanizado como 

partícula de carga juntamente com os fosfatos bioativos. Foi realizado o teste de 

microtração (Capítulo 3) para verificar a resistência de união na interface resina-dentina 

após envelhecimento estratégico (sob pressão pulpar e solução de armazenamento em PBS) 

e o mesmo não mostrou diferença estatística entre os grupos avaliados. 

A micropermeabilidade foi avaliada através de microscopia confocal (Capítulo 3), 

uma vez que a mesma  tem a capacidade de avaliar se existe ou não permeabilidade mais 

elevada ou baixa (por penetração do corante fluoresceína) e a absorção de água através de 

toda a espessura da camada adesiva e da presença ou não de algumas micro-fissuras que 

podem ser responsáveis pela redução da força de união. O material experimental VSG3 e 

VSG4 foram os mais promissores para promover a remineralização na interface 

dentina/resina, reduzindo a permeabilidade dentinária sem afetar a resistência de união 

(Capítulo 3). 

Uma vez ocorrido falha durante o acoplamento do silano com as partículas de carga 

em compósitos convencionais estes podem causar uma aceleração na degradação do 

compósito (38, 39), por outro lado ao utilizar os fosfatos bioativos como partículas de 

carga, a falha com o silano está relacionada com a interferência durante a liberação de íons 

de cálcio e fosfato, o que prejudica as propriedades remineralizantes (40-44).  

Alguns autores afirmam que relativo grau de nanoinfiltração correlaciona-se com a 

remineralização da dentina (45, 46). Isto é, a nanoinfiltração diminui à medida que aumenta 

a remineralização. Assim, comparando o grupo controle (0% de fosfato), após 6 meses 

(Capítulo 3) com os outros materiais experimentais (10%, 20% e 30% de fosfato) foi 

visualmente observada menor quantidade de prata metálica depositada sobre a camada 

híbrida a esses materiais, o que sugere que os túbulos dentinários foram fechados por 



  94  
 

cristais de apatita. À medida que as concentrações de fosfato de cálcio eram diferentes para 

cada grupo experimental, os grupos com maior concentração de tais elementos mostrou 

menor deposição de grãos de prata na camada híbrida. 

Para utilizar estes materiais na prática clínica como material restaurador fluído é 

necessário que suas propriedades mecânicas suportem os esforços da mastigação. De 

acordo com os resultados, o material VSG4 mostrou valores elevados de dureza na região 

de interface dentina/resina após 6 meses (Capítulo 2) sugerindo bioremineralização. Ao 

analisar os valores de dureza na região de compósito, foi observado queda nesses valores 

após 6 meses de imersão em PBS; esta queda pode ser atribuída à hidrólise dos polímeros 

pela imersão em água, uma vez que diminui as forças de coesão dentro das cadeias de 

polímero, gerando tensões de tração sobre a interface de união entre o silano e a partícula 

de carga (47-50). Este último pode induzir à redução nos valores de dureza após imersão 

prolongada em água (48-51). 

 Elevado grau de conversão também foi observado para o mesmo material 

experimental no período de 3 e 6 meses (Capítulo 2) como aumento no seu módulo de 

elasticidade (Capítulo 2), valores estes semelhantes ao encontrado para o material 

comercial Filtek Supreme. Os maiores valores de DC apresentados ao material VSG4 

(Capítulo 2), durante os primeiros 40 segundos, 24 horas, 3 e 6 meses, acredita-se ser 

decorrente da menor quantidade de cargas em sua composição (20% em peso de vidro de 

bário), a qual favorece à maior penetração da luz e, conseqüentemente, maior conversão 

dos monômeros. O mesmo resultado foi obtido com o material experimental VSG3 (que 

tem 30% de partículas de carga) durante o primeiro mês. Parece que a redução do teor de 

carga, juntamente com o aumento do tamanho de partículas de carga desempenha papel 

crucial no grau de conversão, uma vez que haverá maior translucidez da massa do 

compósito. A quantidade de luz transmitida através de um material compósito depende da 

quantidade de luz dispersa e absorvida. A dispersão de luz é aumentada em materiais com 

grande área de interface matriz-carga, devido a diferenças no índice de refração entre as 

partículas de carga e matriz de resina (52).  

O material VSG2 bem como o material comercial Wave obtiveram os maiores 

valores de resistência à flexão (Capítulo 2).  Com isso, a hipótese de que os fosfatos de

cálcio utilizados como carga em compósitos fluídos não interferiria com as propriedades 

mecânicas pode ser rejeitada.

CONCLUSÃO  

 

- A presença do fosfato de cálcio (MCPM e ?-TCP) nos compósitos fluídos 

experimentais em contato com as superfícies de dentina desmineralizada induziu à 

formação de cristais de hidroxiapatita, por meio da presença de picos de fosfatos e 

apatita carbonatada;   

- a análise da interface resina-dentina revelou a presença de seus respectivos 

elementos constituintes (cálcio e fósforo), em relação aos elementos encontrados em 

uma amostra de dentina desmineralizada, porém não foram diferentes 

estatisticamente; 

- a inclusão de fosfato de cálcio como partículas de carga e a utilização de 

metafosfatos em primers auto condicionantes promoveu a deposição mineral na 

interface resina-dentina, reduzindo a permeabilidade dentinária, sem afetar a 

resistência adesiva; 

- além disso, promoveu aumento nos valores de dureza, grau de conversão, 

resistência flexural e módulo de elasticidade para alguns dos materiais 

experimentais.
