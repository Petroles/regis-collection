ABSTRACT 
 
Magnetotelluric method allows the determination of electrical resistivity distribution in the 

subsurface in order to differentiate structures underneath. With appropriate data inversion 

procedures it is possible to obtain resistivity values from a few tens of meters to hundreds of 

kilometers. As with all geophysical prospecting methods, the MT method is subject to 

ambiguities because of the resistivity dispersion phenomenon. This phenomenon might 

deform the MT response curves and can lead to erroneous interpretation. 

A general conclusion is that the dispersion effects can influence the MT response either in 

recognizable or in subtle forms. In both cases, disregarding the distortion effects may lead to 

misleading conclusions as to the physical properties of the surveyed structures. 

This work deals with different aspects of the magnetotelluric method. First of all the 

resistivity dispersion is treated theoretically performing, for the first time, simulations over a 

3-D Earth model (1-D case is reported from a previous work of Esposito and Patella, 2009 

and 2-D case is reconstructed basing the simulation on a previous work of Mauriello et al., 

1996) with a case study in a geothermal area as example (Snake River Plain, Idaho, USA). It 

is shown an MT application in the Pecém costal area (Ceará, Brazil), disregarding the 

resistivity dispersion, in order to show the efficiency of the method in solving subsurface 

resistivity contrasts and finally theoretical simulations showing the application of the MT 

method for Oil and Gas in the emerged portion of Potiguar Basin (Rio Grande do Norte, 

Brazil) are performed, in order to consider the MT as a support in areas where the seismic, 

mainly used for these purposes, can be logistically hard to apply or needs a comparison with 

other geophysical prospecting methods.

RESUMO 
!
O Método magnetotelúrico permite a determinação da distribuição de resistividade elétrica na 

subsuperfície, a fim de diferenciar as estruturas presentes. Com os procedimentos de inversão 

de dados é possível obter valores de resistividade de algumas dezenas de metros até centenas 

de quilómetros. Como acontece com todos os métodos de prospecção geofísica, o método MT 

está sujeito a ambiguidades por causa do fenômeno da dispersão da resistividade. Este 

fenómeno pode deformar as curvas de resposta MT e pode conduzir a uma interpretação 

errónea. 

Uma conclusão geral é que os efeitos de dispersão pode influenciar a resposta MT em forma 

reconhecível ou sutil. Em ambos os casos, sem considerar os efeitos de distorção a 

interpretação pode levar a conclusões enganosas sobre as propriedades físicas das estruturas 

pesquisadas. 

Este trabalho trata com diferentes aspectos do Método Magnetotelúrico. Em primeiro lugar a 

dispersão da resistividade é estudada teoricamente realizando, pela primeira vez, simulações 

de um modelo 3-D da Terra (caso 1-D é apresentado a partir de um trabalho anterior de 

Esposito e Patella, 2009 e o caso 2-D é reconstruído baseando a simulação sobre um trabalho 

de Mauriello et al., 1996), com um estudo de caso em uma área geotérmica (Snake River 

Plain, Idaho, USA). 

Mostra-se uma aplicação do MT na área do Pecém (Ceará, Brasil), desconsiderando a 

dispersão da resistividade, a fim de mostrar a eficiência do método para resolver contrastes de 

resitividade na subsuperfície e, finalmente, são realizadas as simulações teóricas que mostram 

a aplicação do método MT para pesquisa de Oléo e Gás na porção emersa da Bacia Potiguar 

(Rio Grande do Norte, Brasil), a fim de considerar a MT como um apoio em áreas onde a 

sísmica, usada principalmente para esses fins, pode ser logisticamente difícil de aplicar ou 

precisa de uma comparação com outros métodos de prospecção geofísica.

1 INTRODUCTION 
 

Geophysical prospection is a big set of earth imaging techniques that uses physical 

parameters to study the underground matter. The main goal of prospection is to detect the 

geometry of the buried structures and objects and in particular to reveal areas of economic 

interest, like mineral deposits, oil and gas reservoirs, underground water or geothermal fluids.  

There are different geophysical prospection methods and, because of the different field 

sources, each one is sensible to a particular physical property like the density in the 

gravimetric and seismic methods (in the latter case through the seismic waves velocity), 

electrical resistivity (or its inverse, the conductivity) in the electric and electromagnetic 

methods and the magnetic susceptibility in the magnetic method. 

The field sources allow the classification of the methods in two categories: those that 

use the natural field of the Earth (gravimetric, magnetic, electric and electromagnetic 

methods) and the ones that need an artificial source (seismic, inductive electric and 

electromagnetic methods). The natural or artificial fields that propagate in the subsurface are 

measured at the surface and the local field perturbations are supposed to be caused by the 

presence of structures buried at different depths.  

All prospecting methods are subjected to interpretation ambiguities due to the fact 

that different geological configurations can reproduce the same effects at the surface. The 

situation can be quite complex if the buried structures are bi-dimensional or anisotropic like 

several rocks, which store oil, gas and underground water (Jones, A., J., 2006)  

In the Magnetotelluric Method (MT) a source of ambiguity called resistivity 

dispersion exists. The resistivity dispersion phenomenon due to the induced polarization is a 

well-known phenomenology (Martinez, J. and Armenta, J., 2007; Prosvirnin, S. L. and S. 

Zouhdi, S., 2006; Sjöberg, D., 2006) and it can influence MT responses creating distortions in 

the curves that may easily lead to an erroneous interpretation (Esposito, R. and Patella, D., 

2009, Patella, D., 1979). 

Hydrocarbon and geothermal research are application fields, where MT is an ideal 

approach to detect dispersion-affected zones. These zones are fractured portions of rock, 

which have undergone diffuse alterations due to chemical interaction with uprising light 

hydrocarbons and hot fluids. They are considered reliable markers of the presence of 

exploitable reservoirs underneath (Sternberg and Oehler, 1990; Wright at al., 1985).

The thesis is divided in three chapters. The first one provides the theoretical bases of 

the resistivity dispersion in the magnetotelluric method. In particular there are reported the 

MT responses over a 1-D and a 2-D polarizable structures. In the second chapter we 

performed, thought the use of a modeling software, a set of 3-D theoretical simulations 

showing the effects of the dispersion on the MT response curves resulting form a 3-D 

structure underneath.  

Finally in the third chapter we show the results of two MT applications, one field experiment 

and one theoretical study, in two different areas of the Northeast Brazilian coast. 

 

1.1 Objectives   
!
1.1.1 General 
!
The main objective of this work is to show the application of the Magnetotelluric method in 

different areas and the analysis of resistivity dispersion over 3-D polarizable structures.  

 

1.1.2 Specific 
!
Specific objectives are: 

 

a) To perform numerical simulations of the MT response in presence of 3-D polarizable     

structures. 

b) To perform a case study of the geothermal area of Snake River Plain, Idaho. 

c) To process, invert and interpret data in the Ceará costal area of Pecém. 

d) To perform numerical simulations of the MT response in the emerged portion of the 

Potiguar Basin for Oil and Gas exploration. 

 

 

1.2 Justification 
!

The magnetotelluric method is increasingly used both in applied geophysics and in 

basic research. It is less well known than seismology as Earth investigation technique, 

nevertheless the MT has a great potential that is yet to be fully realized. During the past 



!

!

20!

decades the MT method passed through a phase of fast development especially from a 

computational point of view (with two and three-dimensional modeling and inversion), 

allowing a considerable improvement in the study of the Earth through this methodology. MT 

can be an important interpretation tool, integrated with other geophysical prospection 

methods, to the study of sedimentary basins for example, both terrestrial and oceanic. In the 

case of active volcanic areas, the MT method is very efficient because it is able to reach great 

depths in comparison to other electromagnetic methods and to distinguish deep geothermal 

reservoirs. MT method allows the location of the low resistivity anomalies under volcanic 

sediments.  

As we have mentioned before, a limit to the MT method can be the resistivity 

dispersion phenomenon, i. e. the resistivity is dependent from the incident wave frequency.   

Electrical resistivity is the behavior of a material to oppose to the passage of electric current. 

It is a parameter that can differentiate rocks (Palacky, G.V., 1987) and that depends on their 

physical state, the presence of fluids in rock pores, soil permeability and its temperature 

(Keller and Frischknecht, 1966; Olhoeft, G. R., 1980). 

Resistivity values vary in a very large interval, 10-7 - 107 ?m, differentiating rocks and 

their physical states. For example, the resistivities of saturated rocks are directly proportional 

to that of the fluid in the pores and inversely proportional to the porosity. Of course the 

electrical resistivity alone is not enough for a precise identification of the materials or rocks 

but to minimize the ambiguity on the resistivity values is undoubtedly an important and valid 

goal. 

The motivation behind this work is primarily the study (in addition to the one-

dimensional and two-dimensional cases already studied) of the dispersion of the resistivity 

due to 3-D polarizable structures in the subsurface and secondly the application, disregarding 

the dispersion effect, of the method (both theoretically and experimentally) in areas not yet 

observed by the MT. The importance of the 3-D Earth model affected by the resistivity 

dispersion is supported by a case study in which we observe clearly how the dispersive 3-D 

model fits very well the experimental data. This can be a starting point for the use of 3-D 

models including the resistivity dispersion where it is supposed to verify.  

We have chosen three types of geological structures in this work: the Snake River Plain, 

(Idaho, USA), the Pecém region (Fortaleza, Ceará State) and the Potiguar Basin (Rio Grande 

do Norte). 

There are different reasons behind the choice of these areas. The first is a geothermal 

area in which we have performed a 3-D theoretical simulation including the dispersion of the 



!

!

21!

resistivity to better fit the experimental data of Stanley (1982), the second is aimed at the 

knowledge and study of geological structure of a very poor known zone and the third is 

motivated by the application of the MT method in areas, such as a sedimentary basin with 

hydrocarbon reservoirs, usually investigated by the seismic method, in order to show that the 

MT method can be a valuable support, less expensive than seismic and logistically easier to 

apply .

2 DISPERSIVE MAGNETOTELLURICS 
!
2.1 Theoretical background of the Magnetotelluric Method (MT) 
!

The MT method is an exploration technique that uses the natural electromagnetic field 

to estimate electrical resistivity values of the subsurface. 

MT theory was introduced for the first time in 1950 by Tikhonov and in a more detailed way 

by Cagniard few years later, in 1953. It is based on the concept that electromagnetic waves 

generated in the far distance from the Earth's surface reach the crust of our planet where they 

vertically penetrate underground and provide information on the electrical properties of found 

materials. 

When the waves travelling underground encounter materials with different 

resistivities, they are partially reflected at the interfaces and they return to the surface 

containing information about the crossed layers. Natural electromagnetic fields used by the 

MT method are generated mainly by two phenomena and cover a frequency range between 

10-4 - 104 Hz. The first phenomenon is the interaction between the solar plasma and Earth's 

magnetosphere (MT low frequency field, Fig. 5), and the second is the presence of storms 

between the two tropics (MT high frequency field, Fig. 6). (Parker, 1958; Campbell, 1987). 

Interactions between the solar wind and the Earth’s magnetosphere generate 

fluctuations in the electromagnetic field lower than 1Hz. The solar wind emits streams of 

ions, protons and electrons from the Sun, and on the encounter with terrestrial magnetic field 

(at the magnetopause) these protons and electrons, deflected in opposite directions, create an 

electric field. This is a throbbing phenomenon, not static, which means that the deformation 

of the magnetic field is variable in time, with frequency between 1 Hz and 10-4 Hz. The 

increase is solar wind pressure pushes the magnetopause closer to the Earth giving rise to 

magnetic storms (Fig. 1) (Chapman and Ferraro, 1931). 

Electromagnetic fields with frequency higher than 1Hz have their origins in 

meteorological activity like lightening discharges. These, known as “sferics” (impulsive 

signals emitted by lightening), propagate around the world within the waveguide bounded by 

the ionosphere and Earth’s surface (Dobbs, 1985, Electromagnetic Waves). 

It is a source of uniform electromagnetic energy due to the constant presence of 

lightening on the Earth's surface. Zones where we have most of this type of activity are 



!

located in the equatorial regions, where storms have an average rate of 100 days per year (Fig. 

2).  

It is a perturbation that propagates over a long distance, and as in the previous case, is not 

static, but produces a variable magnetic field this time with frequency between 1 Hz and 104 

Hz.

time (UT).

Interactions between the solar wind (Parker, 1958) and the

Earth’s magnetosphere and ionosphere generate electromagnetic

fluctuations with frequencies lower than 1 Hz (i.e., periods longer

than 1 s). Briefly, the solar wind is a continual stream of plasma,

radiating mainly protons and electrons from the Sun. On encoun-

tering the terrestrial magnetic field (at the magnetopause), these

protons and electrons are deflected in opposite directions, thereby

establishing an electric field (Figure 1.2). Variations in density,

velocity and magnetic field intensity of the solar wind produce

rapidly varying distortions of the Earth’s magnetosphere. For

example, increases in solar-wind pressure cause rapid compression

of the magnetosphere, and therefore compaction of magnetic field

lines, affecting an increase in the horizontal geomagnetic field.

Oscillations of the magnetosphere generate small, almost sinusoidal

variations of the geomagnetic field, called geomagnetic pulsations.

magnetosphere and ionosphere complexly modify these fluctuating

The ionosphere acts as an intermediary between the two phenomena, distributing 

evenly the dynamic effects so that natural electromagnetic source field utilized, relatively far 

away from the Earth’s surface, may be treated as uniform, plane-polarized electromagnetic 

waves (Tikhonov 1950, Cagniard, 1953) normally incident on the Earth surface. Wait (1954) 

and Price (1962) showed that limitations of the normally incident wave assumption arise 

when the lateral extension of the source is not significantly larger than the penetration depth 

of electromagnetic fields into the Earth, requiring a correction in Cagniard’s (1953) 

formulation. 

Another peculiarity of the Tikhonov-Cagniard model is that it ignores the sphericity of 

the earth. This question has been addressed by many researchers (Srivastava, 1966; 

Sochel’nikov, 1979; Kaufman and Keller, 1981; Berdichevsky and Zdanov, 1984) and the 

most elegant solution has been advanced by P. Weidelt (1972) establishing the relationship 

between spherical and plane models. The conditions are satisfied for depths that not exceed a 

few hundreds of kilometers.  Therefore, for the purpose of MT, it is sufficient to consider a 

flat Earth model with electromagnetic fields described in Cartesian coordinates. 

The plane wave field is a mixture of monochromatic waves that travel vertically in the ground 

and generate telluric currents (from which the name magnetotelluric).

2.1.2 Sorgenti a bassa frequenza  

Uno dei vantaggi della MT è la possibilità di esplorare grandi profondità: le frequenze più 

interessanti sono, quindi, quelle che variano nell’intervallo 1-10-4Hz. 

In questo range di frequenze le variazioni del campo elettromagnetico terrestre di origine 

esterna, sono legate all’interazione del vento solare con il campo magnetico terrestre 

permanente e con la ionosfera. 

Nelle vicinanze della terra, ad una distanza pari a 3-4 volte il raggio terrestre, le linee di forza 

del campo magnetico terrestre sono abbastanza simmetriche, mentre a distanze maggiori, il 

campo comincia a deformarsi: le linee di forza si infittiscono nella parte rivolta al sole, mentre 

si diradano nella parte opposta. Questo accade a causa dell’interazione tra il campo magnetico 

e il vento solare, ossia il flusso di particelle cariche che viene espulso senza interruzione dal 

sole a velocità comprese tra 300 e 800 km/s. Queste particelle, principalmente protoni ed

The external energy reaches the Earth’s surface where is partially reflected and the 

remaining part penetrates into the Earth inducing electric currents, known as telluric currents, 

which generate a secondary magnetic field.  

Magnetotelluric is based on the simultaneous measurements of total electromagnetic 

field, time variation of both magnetic field B(t) and induced electric field E(t), through which 

it is possible to obtain information on the electrical properties (electrical resistivity) since they 

correlated to the impedance Z, which is the ratio of the electrical (E) and magnetic (B) 

components. 

According to the property of electromagnetic waves in the conductors, the penetration of 

electromagnetic wave depends on the oscillation frequency through the following 

mathematical relationship: 

 

 

                                                          p ? 500 ?(?/f)                                 (1.1) 
 

 
where p, called skin depth is expressed in meters, ? is the resistivity expressed in ?m and f is 

the frequency in Hz.  

Frequency values between 10-4 Hz and 1 Hz (Magnetotellurics) investigate deeper 

structures, and values between 1 Hz and 104 Hz (Audio-Magnetotellurics) “shallower” 

structures instead. Skin depth depends also on resistivity values of the layers lying over the 

target. 

The frequency interval between 0.5 and 5 Hz is known as dead band because in this 

range of frequency the natural electromagnetic signal is not good enough to allow a good 

quality data acquisition and a good resolution of objects buried up to a few kilometers of 

depth. 

Goldstein and Strangway in 1975 introduced a new methodology of artificial source 

(CSAMT - controlled source audio-magnetotellurics) to better study underground shallow 

layers (up to 2-3 km). This is a high-resolution technique and it was found very efficient in 

imaging Earth’s crust between 20m and 2000m. 

The source of CSAMT method, typically in a frequency interval of 0.1 – 8 kHz, 

consists of en electric dipole positioned into the ground that generates an electromagnetic 

field simulating the natural field. The electric dipole simulating the source, usually 2-3 km 

long is positioned at a great distance (minimum 3 times the skin depth) from the 

measurements area.  The distance between the source and the measurements area is necessary 



!

!

26!

to guarantee that the field is not influenced by near-field effects. In the proximity of the 

source the electromagnetic waves are curved and the Cagniard resistivity doesn’t provide 

realistic resistivity values. When far-field conditions are satisfied electric and magnetic fields 

behave like plane waves, similar to natural MT and AMT, and for this reason we can use the 

same equations used in the MT method. 

 Data acquired allow us to calculate values of impedance Z, which is related to 

magnetic field and electric field for every frequency value.

In the case of 1-D Earth (a stack of isotropic layers), where conductivity varies only 

with depth, the diagonal tensor elements Zxx and Zyy are zero, whilst the off-diagonal 

elements are equal in magnitude but have opposite signs:

there are two parameters per frequency, which are the real and imaginary parts of the 

complex impedance. 

For a 2-D Earth, in which conductivity varies along one horizontal direction as well as 

with depth, Zxx e Zyy are equal in magnitude, but have opposite sign, whilst Zxy e Zyx differ. If 

we in consider x or y direction aligned along the direction of geoelectric strike of the 2-D 

structures, the tensor becomes

2.2 Magnetotelluric dispersion 
!

Resistivity dispersion phenomenon can manifest itself when the soil is electrically 

polarizable. In the frequency range of the MT method (10-4-104 Hz) a very important 

phenomenon can occur which gives additional information in underground investigation: the 

Induced Polarization phenomenon (10-2-102 Hz). 

Induced Polarization (IP) is the basis for a geophysical prospecting method as well 

and it occurs, under particular conditions, when electrical current flows into the subsoil. 

It is a transient and very complex phenomenon, correlated to electrochemical processes in 

rocks and consists of the creation of electrical dipoles oriented with the electrical source field. 

Main factors that determine IP are: 

 

• Mineral composition 

• Rocks pattern 

• Water percentage 

• Chemical composition of water  

 

Experimentally, Induced Polarization can be recognized by positioning on Earth’s 

surface a quadrupole ABMN, where A and B are the current electrodes while M and N are the 

voltage electrodes. A direct current is sent into the subsoil and in presence of polarization the 

potential difference measured after the interruption of the current returns to zero slower than a 

normal trend (Fig. 4).!!
The charges take some time to redistribute when an external DC electric field is 

applied (charging). Equivalently they take the same time to revert to a balanced distribuition 

once the electric field is removed (discharging).

The subsoil behaves as a distribution of capacitors that are charged and uncharged. 

The system will return to the state of equilibrium in an amount of time, which is function of 

the soil polarizability.

and B are the current electrodes, M and N potential electrodes, (b) curves in time domain, (c) curves in frequency

The types of polarization are called: 

 

• Membrane polarization 

• Electrode polarization 

 

There are two types of membrane polarization, the first one occurs when pore space 

narrows to within several boundary layer thicknesses (which is the thickness of ions adsorbed

to a surface). Charges cannot flow easily, so they accumulate when an electric field is applied 

resulting in a net charge dipole, which adds to any other voltages measured at the surface. 

A second form of membrane polarization is similar to the first: this occurs when in the 

rock is present a discreet and widespread distribution of clay particles. Upon application of an 

electric potential, positive charge carriers pass easily, while negative carriers accumulate. 

There is an “ion-selective membrane.” A surplus of both cations and anions occurs at one end 

of the membrane, while a deficiency occurs at the other end.

Electrode polarization occurs when pore space is blocked by metallic particles, as 

oxides or sulphides. When an electric current is applied, which is in part electrolytic and 

electronic, ions accumulate at the interface obstructing current flow (Snyder et al., 1977), the 

result is two electrical double layers which add to voltages measured at the surface. 

We can observe a transient potential both at the connection and at the shutdown of the 

circuit, the two transient phases are equivalent, but usually the discharging transient is studied 

because is free from the "light" of the current. The phenomenon is studied in the frequency 

domain applying Fourier transform of the transient in the time domain or sending alternating 

current at different frequencies.

To study Induced Polarization is necessary to introduce physical models that can fully 

represent the phenomenon. One of the models used to study IP is called Debye model and it is 

expressed in the following equation

in the frequency domain (?), where ?n&gt;0 is the amplitude of the n-th decay component, V0 is 

the stationary value before the discharge, ?n is the decay constant of the n-th exponential, ?n= 
?n?n, ?0 is the resistivity in correspondence of V0. 

The Debye model is based on the assumption that underground N different ionic 

species are present, in equation (2.1), we observe the superposition of exponential decays and 

(2.2), the overlap of the individual dispersion curves. 

The definition of the Debye model thus involves the determination of 2n parameters 

totally. Another physical model for the representation of the induced polarization 

phenomenon is the Cole-Cole model

where m is a measure of material polarization,  0 ??c ? 1 is the frequency dependence factor, 

? the time constant in seconds, which determines the length of time required for the decay, 

and ?(1+nc) is the gamma function. 



!

!

33!

The Cole-Cole model is an empirical model with just three parameters to be 

determined, m, ? and c, and it can be proven that it is a continuous distribution of individual 

Debye models. In the recent literature we find several studies concerning the reformulation of 

the Debye and the Cole-Cole models (Weigand and Kemna, 2016; Gurin at al., 2015). 

Nordsiek and Weller, for example, in 2008 proposed an alternative fitting approach for the 

induced-polarization spectra using the decomposition of observed IP spectra into a variety of 

Debye spectra. It proves to be more flexible and stable, even for complicated phase spectra 

that cannot be fitted by single Cole-Cole type models.  

Ustra et al. 2016 developed an alternative formulation for Debye decomposition 

through laboratory tests with sand and oil mixtures undergoing microbial degradation of 

hydrocarbons. They determined a relaxation time distribution (RTD) and two frequency-

independent parameters that modulate the complex conductivity spectra. The distribution of 

relaxation times quantifies the contribution of each distinct relaxation process. Each 

contribution can then be associated with specific polarization processes and the RTD reveals 

evidence of a length scale at which a new polarization process takes place as a result of the 

biodegradation process. 

The spatial and temporal behavior of an electric field generated into polarizable rocks 

due to external sources is significantly different from the one expected if we consider valid 

Ohm's law in its basic formulation. IP phenomenon is a clear sign that the electricity 

conduction in the rocks is very complex and cannot be synthesized by the classical 

relationship: 

 

                                                                 ! = !!                                                                  (2.5) 
 

where the conductivity ? is assumed to be independent from time t in TD and from frequency 

? no FD. Polarization effects are observed when into the rocks there are alterations in the 

crystal structure due to the circulation of hydrothermal fluids, hydrocarbon migration and 

tectonic metamorphism. 

Among the various electromagnetic prospecting methods, which in principle can 

report the occurrence of polarization phenomena, it is included the MT method. One of the 

ways in which polarization manifests itself in the rocks consists in the resistivity variation by 

varying the frequency of an alternating current flow passing there through (resistivity 

dispersion). For this reason one polarizable material opposes different resistivities at different 

monochromatic components of MT field. 



!

!

34!

The MT method requires an accurate analysis of the experimental data in the 

frequency range between 10-4 and 104 Hz and this is precisely the range in which the 

dispersion phenomenon manifests if exists. It reveals itself with an anomalous behavior in the 

experimental data that is not justified by the classical MT theory. 

An example is shown in Figure 6, from Manzella et al. (2004), where we can observe 

an anomaly in MT curves. This anomaly cannot be justified as a response to any particular 

geometry of the buried structure, but as a response to an abnormal physical behavior of the 

resistivity of the rocks.

2.3 Electrodynamic model of Induced Polarization 

!
The polarizability of the soil is connected to the presence of saline solutions inside the 

rocks, of metal particles or hydrocarbons. 

Among the models proposed to explain the phenomenon of IP we consider a model 

introduced by Patella in 2003, called electrodynamic model, which allows us to get an 

expression of the conductivity, then of the resistivity as a solution of a second order 

differential equation that describes the movement of charged particles immersed in an 

external electric field. 

We start from the motion equation of a charged particle q immersed in an electric field 

E (t):

where m2 is the mass of the particle, m1 the friction-like coefficient accounting for dissipative

Equation (2.12) describes a circuit-like cell with a resistance-capacitance-inductance 

series combination. Physically this circuit represents the presence of moving charges (R) 

bound charges (C) and heavy charges (L) i.e. with considerable inertia. 

It is possible to classify circuit behavior in the three following modes: 

 

1) if there are only charges "light" and not "bound", i.e. only subject to viscous friction 

forces, dominant over inertia and Coulomb force, the behavior is purely Ohmic, that 

speaking in terms of circuit corresponds to a resistance R; 

 

2) if there are charges "light" and "bound", i.e. only subject to Coulomb force, 

dominant over inertia and viscous friction force, the behavior is capacitive and 

corresponds to a capacitance C; 

 



!

!

37!

3) if, finally, charges are "heavy" and not "bound", i.e. subject only to inertial forces, 

dominant on purely viscous friction and Coulomb force, the behavior is inductive, that 

corresponds to the circuit element of inductance L. 

 

From a geological point of view, it can be assumed that “heavy” charges in solution 

are due to hydrocarbon pollution or heavy metal ions (industrial residues as lead, zinc and 

mercury poured into the soil or into groundwater). 

If we imagine a purely resistive circuit, i.e., ?m2&amp;lt;&amp;lt;m1 and m0&amp;lt;&amp;lt;?m1, equation 

(2.12) reduces to

which represents the Ohmic conductivity. 

When ?m1&amp;lt;&amp;lt;m0  and  m0&amp;lt;&amp;lt;?2m2 equation (2.12) becomes

In this case, the elastic term is dominant and the circuit is purely capacitive. If            

m1&amp;lt;&amp;lt;?m2 and m0&amp;lt;&amp;lt;?2m2 eq. (2.12) is reduced to

combinations of ionic species in the fluid, it is easy to realize that various types of forces may

prevail in different ways, giving rise to a more complex circuit behavior with series or parallel 

combinations of the elements just described. 

 

2.4 Dispersion models 
!

From a work of Patella of 2008 we consider five different dispersion laws. From 

equation (2.6) that describes the particles motion immersed in an external electric field, we 

arrive to the following expression for the conductivity

and hence the resistivity 

 

                                            

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! =
!! + !"!! ? !!!!

!"#!! .!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.17) 

 

The resistivity and the conductivity are called respectively impedivity and admittivity 

in the frequency domain (Patella 1987). 

From this expression that describes the overall behavior of a RLC series circuit we 

obtain the following dispersion models: 

 

1. the positive non-resonant model, in which real and imaginary part of the 

admittivity are positive; 

2. the negative non-resonant model, in which real part of admittivity is positive 

and imaginary part is negative; 

3. the resonant model, in which both real and imaginary part of the admittivity 

present a resonant peak; 

4.  the resonant positive model, in which the resonance is superimposed on the 

positive dispersion effect; 

5. the resonant positive model, in which the resonance is superimposed on the 

positive dispersion effect; 



!

!

39!

6. the resonant positive model, in which the resonance is superimposed on the 

positive dispersion effect; 

7. and the resonant negative model, in which the resonance is superimposed on 

the negative dispersion effect. 

 

In the case of non-resonant model one of the ion species consists of charges subject to 

frictional force (R) and the other species is characterized by "light" charges subject to both 

frictional forces and Coulomb force (RC). In other words one branch (R) represents the path 

which the unbound light ions run through, with instantaneous constant speed, under the action 

of the external exciting field. The other branch (RC) represents the path the bound light ions 

can move through, under the action of the same external field and against the decelerating 

recall forces. 

In the non-resonant negative model one of the two species is formed by charges 

subject to frictional force (R) as in the previous case, and the other has "heavy" charges 

subject to the forces of inertia and friction (RL). In this case the second branch (RL) simulates 

the accelerated path the unbound heavy ions can travel through, subject to the external field.  

In the resonant model one of the two species, as in the two previous cases, consists of 

"light" and "bound" charges (R) and the second one composed by "heavy" charges subject to 

all three kinds of forces: inertia, friction and Coulomb force (RCL). 

In membrane polarization bound charges are represented by clay particles that with 

their negative charge distribution in the rock pores delay the flow of the positive ions 

(cations) in the solution because of Coulomb force. In electrode polarization instead the metal 

particles obstructing the pores block the ions in the fluid solution.

2.4.2 Non-resonant negative model 
 

In the literature, the phenomenon of negative IP has not been considered a physical 

effect, an intrinsic property of earth materials. Instead, it is viewed as a geometrical effect due 

to the mutual arrangement between the measuring device and the polarized medium (Sumner 

1967; Bertin and Loeb, 1976; Nabighian and Elliot, 1976; Wait, 1982), or as an effect due to 

inductive coupling between the transmitter and the receiver circuit (Bertin and Loeb, 1976), 

or additionally as an effect due to current leakage of the transmitter circuit in proximity of the 

receiver circuit (Cantwell and Madden, 1976). 

But it is known that the negative dispersion is an intrinsic property of electrons in 

metals at wavelengths smaller than 10-2 cm (Stratton, 1941), therefore to consider a negative 

IP model may actually provide information about the properties of the subsoil. 

Let's consider once again the system with two different ionic species, in this case the 

two species are mobile and just one of them has heavy ions. These ions have not negligible 

inertia, thus generating the equivalent RL effect. As mentioned before from a geological point 

of view the presence of heavy charges is connected to the presence of hydrocarbons or heavy 

metal ions.  

Then the conductivity expression in this case is

We can notice that the real part is always positive, as in the non-resonant positive 

model, but the asymptotes are reversed, the asymptote at low frequencies is at higher level 

than the one at high frequencies. The imaginary part is negative and, as in the previous case, it 

tends to zero for ? ? 0, ?, having a minimum in correspondence of the inflection point of 

real part. 

In this case the expression of Cole-Cole resistivity is (Esposito and Patella, 2009)

2.4.3 Resonant positive and negative models

The case of resonance occurs when one of the two ionic species has considerable 

inertia. We assume that the microcircuit, formed by two branches in parallel, in one branch 

behaves as a single resistance (R), and in the other branch as a combination of RLC in series.

The real part of conductivity is always positive, but in this case the low-frequency 

asymptote is at the same level of high frequency asymptote and the curve shows a maximum 

in correspondence of the resonance frequency ? = (?2/?2)1/2. The imaginary part, as in the 

previous cases, goes to zero for ? ? 0, ?, and has a positive peak followed by a negative 

peak in correspondence of the resonance frequency. From the graph, it can be deduced that 

the effect of resonance can be considered as a combination of a positive and a negative effect. 

To conclude, we show the resonance superimposed on either a positive or a negative 

dispersion effect. Supposing the presence of three different ionic species (i = 1,2,3) and a 

behavior as a circuit having three branches in parallel, the first branch (i = 1) is constituted by 

a single resistance (R), the second branch (i = 2) as RC in series (positive model) or RL 

(negative model), the third branch (i = 3) as a RLC in series.

The dispersion models shown are representative of different geological environments. 

Positive non-resonant dispersion effects in MT were experimentally recognized in volcanic 

and geothermal areas (Di Maio et al., 1997; Di Maio et al., 2000; Giammetti et al., 1996; 

Mauriello et al., 2000; Mauriello at el., 2004; Patella et al., 1991).  

Negative non-resonant dispersion introduces the possibility of explaining negative 

chargeability values, known in metals at high frequency, also as an intrinsic physical effect in 

some earth materials; for example in near-surface applications, negative IP effects might be 

interpreted as indicators of the presence of heavy ionic contaminants in sediments (Patella, 

2008). 

Resonant effects are connected to the presence of heavy particles into the subsurface 

therefore they can verify of in presence of hydrocarbon or metals into the soil or groundwater.

2.5 MT dispersive response for a 1-D and a 2-D earth model 
!

In the following paragraph we report the work of Esposito, R. and Patella, D., 2009 in 

which are shown in detail the five dispersion models, previously described, in the case of a 1-

D layered earth with the second layer affected by resistivity dispersion, which is characterized 

by the Cole-Cole dispersive functions.  

The response curves are calculated through the expression, shown in the equation 

(2.38), of apparent impedivity in MT for a n-layered dispersive earth (following the theory of 

Patella 1993).

where k1 and k2 are the wavenumbers of the first and the second layer, given by k1= 

?(i?µ0/?1) and k2= ?(i?µ0/?2), respectively, being µ0 the magnetic permeability of the 

vacuum, equal to 4??10-7 H/m in SI units.  

The impedivity ?2 (?) of the second layer is given, separately, by the expressions in 

Eqs. (2.29) and (2.33), and the inverse of the expressions in Eqs. (2.35), (2.36) and (2.37). 

 

2.5.1 1-D earth model 
  

Four combinations of three layers were considered A, Q, H, K, all with the 

intermediate layer dispersive, or polarizable. 

The resistivity and thickness values of the layers are illustrated in Figure 12.

Simulations were performed using the software MATLAB 7.12.0 and in this work we 

report the most significant results, i. e. where the most significant variations in MT curves are 

observed (with growing chargeability m respectively, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, for positive and negative, 

0.1, 0.01, 0.001, non-resonant models and different ?, 1Hz, 10Hz, 100Hz, in the three 

resonant models). The values of the parameters m indicate the degree of polarizability of the 

soil while ? values are directly connected to the interaction of ionic species in solution. It is 

not so easy to associate a certain parameter value to a specific geological environment, 

certainly the presence of saline solutions, hot fluids or sulfides (Pelton, 1978) increase the soil 

chargeability, so high value of m for the positive non-resonant case and low value of m for the 

negative non-resonant case are meaningful of these types of alterations. Figures 13, 14, 15, 16 

and 17 show the influence of polarization in the MT responses. 

In all sets of curves there are always plotted for comparison the responses of MT non-

dispersive models.

in Eq. (8) and Eq. (9) are given in Table 3.
The influence of the resonant positive dispersion on transient EM

methods has been studied by [1, 37], who adopted the CC model given
in Eq. (1), by arguing that for small chargeability values its validity
can be extended to values of c #]1, 2[ and that within this interval the
resonance e!ects can be modeled.

3. THE MT RESPONSE IN PRESENCE OF DISPERSION

We show the results from a simulation of the MT responses, when the
di!erent dispersion models, separately, are assumed to characterize
the electrical properties of a region of the explored half-space. A 1D
three-layered earth, with its four A, Q, H, K type sections [14], is
considered, with only the intermediate layer assumed to be dispersive.
A fixed sequence of DC resistivities and thickness is attributed as in
Fig. 1.

the dispersive MT simulations.

The most significant deformation is shown in Fig. 14 between the curves with the 

lowest value of m and the one with the biggest value of m. 

It is noteworthy that sequence of type H was shown to be the most frequent model in 

oil and geothermal explorations (Pellerin, 1996; Zhdanov, 1994). In fact, strong scattering 

phenomena can occur in a permeable rock, underlying a cover layer, because of the diffuse 

presence of mineral particles and clay particles formed by the aggressive action of fluids that 

are rising from an underlying reservoir. 

If there is no certainty that data acquisition were made in a polarizable soil, the 

interpretation of curves can be easily incorrect. 

To demonstrate the equivalence problem that can occur we show an example of two 

MT response curves of two types of earth, one with two layers without dispersion of 

resistivity and the other with three layers, with the second layer being dispersive, specifically 

affected by a negative non-resonant type of dispersion. The solid curve is the response curve 

is the reference three-layer non-dispersive earth (Fig. 18).  

From the Fig. 18 it is clear that the responses of the two layers earth without 

dispersion and the ones of the three layers earth with negative non-resonant dispersion appear 

identical. For this reason MT measurements alone cannot distinguish in which of the two 

cases we are, making necessary the combination of MT with a direct-current prospecting 

method. An electric sounding is free from dispersion, as it operates in a nearly steady state 

regime, by constructing synthetic MT non-dispersive diagrams from a preliminary DES 

(Dipole Electric Survey) interpretation, it is possible to evidence dispersion effects from the 

comparison between the true MT diagrams and the synthetic ones (Patella, 1987). 

In the resonant case instead, both positive and negative, we can clearly notice the 

presence of a more or less marked resonance peak in MT curves characteristic, which can 

make more recognizable the presence of dispersion.

2.5.2  2-D earth model 
!

The magnetotelluric response over 2-D media with resistivity frequency dispersion has 

already been studied from Mauriello et al., 1996 that investigated the surface MT responses of 

three real geological situations representing a sedimentary basin, a geothermal system and a 

magma chamber, assumed to be dispersive. 

For further information we decided to perform two 2-D inversions of a synthetic data 

set derived from a 2-D Earth model, considered both non dispersive and dispersive. We 

studied a simple case of a conductive body immersed in a more resistive environment that can 

be appropriate to represent the characteristics of a magma chamber. The conductive body with 

resistivity of 10 ?m has dimensions of 2x2km (lateral and vertical extensions), it is located at 

a depth of 1km in a host material of 200 ?m of resistivity and it is centered with respect to a 7 

km long profile with 15 MT stations which spaced 500m one from each other (Fig. 19). 

In this simulation we performed a 2-D inversion with synthetic data originated from 

the forward 2-D model responses considering the body affected by resistivity dispersion. The 

MT responses of the forward 2-D model and the 2-D inversion have been performed with the 

software WinGLinK 2.01.01. 

Simulations are made considering the buried body both non-dispersive and dispersive 

to observe the difference in MT responses.

stations are indicated by the black triangles.

The first step consisted in running a forward 2-D model to obtain the theoretical MT 

non-dispersive curves for the 2-D earth model showed in Figure 19, then using the positive 

Cole-Cole dispersion model reported in the Eq. (2.39) we calculated the resistivity value that 

the body exhibits, at a defined frequency (for instance 10Hz), with the parameters      c = 0.75, 

m = 0.9 and ? = 100s (chosen according to the 1-D simulations), and we run again the forward 

2D model to obtain the correspondent MT curves. 

 

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! = !! 1 ? !
!"# !

1 + (!"#)! .!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(2.39) 

 

We have repeated this procedure for sixteen different values of frequency from a value of 

0.001 Hz until a few hundreds of Hertz. 

As an example, in Fig. 20, we show the MT responses at three different stations of the 

profile, the first one located in the proximity of the border of the body, the second one 

centered with respect to the lateral extension of the conductive body and the third one 

positioned 2km far away from body border.   

Once we have replaced the resistivity of the body with the Cole-Cole resistivity we 

run the forward 2-D model procedure for each of the sixteen values. From the apparent 

resistivities and phases resulting from the direct modeling procedure, we constructed the MT 

curves having a resistivity has a function of the frequency. 

The MT curves so constructed have been used as the input for the 2-D inversion; in 

order to understand which Earth model solution we reach. The results of the 2-D inversion are 

shown in Fig. 21 and Fig. 22, for the non-dispersive case and the dispersive case respectively, 

considering an error of 10% on the resistivity values and phases for both TE and TM mode. 

As we can see clearly from the two figures the input MT curves lead to a two slightly 

different Earth models, in the dispersive case the body appears bigger in the lateral dimension 

and more conductive.

3 THE MAGNETOTELLURIC RESPONSE OVER A 3-D POLARIZABLE 
STRUCTURE 
!

In this chapter we show the MT responses in the case of a 3-D dispersive structure. 

The MT curves at the surface are obtained from the 3-D forward modeling code, named 

MTD3FWD, developed by Randy Mackie and implemented into the 3D modeling program 

WINGLINK 2.01.01. The forward modeling code computes magnetic and electric fields at 

the surface of a 3-D electrical resistivity model crossed by electromagnetic plane waves, the 

fields computed are converted to magnetotelluric impedances and consequently to resistivity 

and phase curves at the stations contained in the mesh area. 
!

3.1 3-D simulation of dispersive effects in MT 

 
!

In Fig. 23 we present the 3D model assumed for the simulations. A horizontal 

dispersive prism with resistivity ?0=10 ?m is buried in a non-dispersive half-space with 

resistivity of 200 ?m. The 3D body has horizontal length of 6 km along the y-axis and square

The simulations have been done along three 8 km long profiles parallel to the x-axis. 

Profile 1 crosses the prism's mid-length, profile 2 is 2250 m apart from profile 1, and profile 3 

is 1500m apart from profile 2 (Fig. 23). 17 MT station points, spaced 500 m from each other, 

have been assumed along the profiles. The frequencies 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 Hz have

been taken to plot modulus and phase of the MT apparent impedivity functions of the TE and 

TM modes, in order to show how IP alters the MT profiles at decreasing frequency, i.e. at 

increasing penetration depth. 

As in the 2-D Earth model simulations we used the positive Cole-Cole dispersion 

model reported in the Eq. (2.39) with the parameters c = 0.75, m = 0.9 and ? = 100s, and we 

calculated the resistivity value that the body exhibits, at a defined frequency, specifically at 

10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 Hz. For each of the resistivity value assigned to the body we run the 

forward 3-D model to obtain the MT curves plotting modulus and phase of the MT apparent 

impedivity functions of the TE and TM modes, in order to show how IP alters the MT profiles 

at decreasing frequency, i.e. at increasing penetration depth. 

For the sake of conciseness, only one example of simulation is presented, which refers 

to the following Cole-Cole parameter set for the dispersive prism: m=0.9, ?=10 s and c=0.75 

(Fig.24 through Fig.38). In all figures, the blue line refers to the reference non-dispersive case 

and the red lines to the dispersive assumption.

Along the profile 1, centered over the prism (Fig.28 to Fig.32), the departure of the red 

lines from the reference blue lines, for both modulus and phase of the TE and TM modes, is 

very evident. The IP effect manifests with a more pronounced minimum of both the TE and 

TM apparent impedivity modulus, centered above the median axis of the 3D dispersive body. 

T The departure from the reference non-dispersive profiles starts to grow from 10 Hz, 

reaches its maximum at 1 Hz, then slowly decreases as frequency decreases, until it almost 

disappears at 0.001 Hz. A specular character is observed in the phase curves, where the 

dispersion-related red lines show a magnified maximum with respect to the non-dispersive 

reference blue lines. For all frequencies the more vigorous effect is observed in the TE mode.

Along the profile 2, the behavior of the curves appears similar to that along the profile 

1. However, two differences can readily be envisaged. The first one is that the departure of 

the dispersive red curves from the non-dispersive blue curves is less pronounced than in the 

previous case. The second difference regards mainly the TE mode and does not depend on 

dispersion. It consists in a symmetrical slope reversal in the central portion of the anomaly, 

with appearance of peaks in correspondence of the median longitudinal axis of the prism. This 

effect is likely due to the influence of the nearer vertical square face of the prism.

Figure 38: Modulus (top diagrams, in ?m) and phase (bottom diagrams, in deg.) of the two orthogonal TM and TE 
modes of the MT apparent impedivity response against distance (in m) along the profile 3 calculated at the frequency 
of 0.001 Hz. The blue curves refer to the reference not dispersive response, while the red curves to the dispersive case. 
 

!
!

 

At last, along the profile 3, the effect of dispersion as seen along the profiles 1 and 2, 

i.e. the increasing amplitude of the minima and maxima along the dispersive red curves, 

almost completely disappears. The different width of the anomaly centered above the prism 

becomes, instead, the dominant character, especially for the curves of the modulus. The red 

central anomalies at 1 Hz are less wide than the corresponding blue anomalies, then, from 0.1 

Hz down to 0.001 Hz, the red anomalies gradually become wider than the blue ones. 

Of course, the amount of distortion of the MT response over a polarizable body 

depends on the values assigned to the Cole-Cole parameters, m, ? and c. Values of m in the 

range 0.4 to 0.9, of ? in the range 10?3 s to 104 s, and of c in the range 0.1 to 0.8 are reported in 

literature from laboratory and field experiments made with full spectral or multifrequency IP 

methods (e.g., Keller and Frischknecht, 1966; Sumner, 1976; Pelton et al., 1978). Mauriello et 

al. (1996) gave a detailed overview on this topic, and inferred from 2D simulations that high 

values of m (not less than 0.75) and ? (not less than 100 s) are ideal for dispersion effects to be 

recognizable in MT measurements.  They also showed that the TE is always the most 

distorted MT mode. Esposito and Patella (2009) showed that c has practically no remarkable 

distortion effect in MT on 1D structures. The low influence of c was also inferred by 

Mauriello et al. (1996) in 2D cases. The above effects have also been tested within the present 

study devoted to 3D structures. The results from a great number of simulations above the 

model in Fig. 23, carried out following the same approach as in Mauriello et al. (1996) by

changing m and ? with fixed c, fully confirm all of the above conclusions. A further 

consideration is that visible distortion effects can be obtained even when the m and ? vary in 

opposite directions. The sense is that the choice of an exceedingly low value of one of them 

must be compensated by a quite high value of the other one. This is just the case we have 

discussed a few lines above, where the value ?=10 s, well below the lower limit of the ?-range 

previously recalled, is compensated by the value m=0.9, at the top limit of the m-range. 

3.1.1 Field example 
!

We now show a field example already studied by Mauriello and Patella (1999) in the 

frame of the probability tomography imaging. The area is the eastern Snake River Plain 

(SRP), Idaho, where a MT profile was performed by Stanley (1982), near the Idaho National 

Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (Fig. 39). Fig. 40 shows the TM and TE apparent 

resistivity pseudosections across the SRP MT profile obtained from a computerization of the 

field data set of Stanley.

The SRP is an arcuate depression bounded on both sides by the Basin and Range 

structures, and for much of its extent it is underlain by basalt and interbedded continental 

Quaternary and Tertiary sediments (Mabey, 1982). Mauriello and Patella (1999) applied the 

2D probability tomography imaging to the SRP TM and TE pseudosections in Fig.40 and 

evinced within the SRP depression a laterally bounded conductive slab with lateral extension 

of about 17 km and a mean depth to its top of about 2 km.

In their work, dispersion effects were also admitted and using the 2D dispersive MT forward 

modeling by Mauriello et al. (1996), the 2D structure depicted in Fig. 41.a was then proposed. 
Figure 41.a: The NW-SE section of the interpreted Snake River Plain structural model across the MT profile by 
Stanley (1982), The 3D conductive slab (15 km wide in the direction normal to the section) is assumed to be affected 
by resistivity frequency dispersion.

75!

Comparing the synthetic TM and TE pseudosections from the 2D model in Fig. 41.a 

with the original ones in Fig.40, Mauriello and Patella (1999) found a good matching of the 

two TM pseudosections, while the TE ones were judged not properly conforming to each 

other. They attributed this discrepancy to the circumstance that the TE mode is much more 

affected than the TM mode whenever a 2D geometry is assumed to approximate a limited 

strike length slab (Wannamaker et al., 1984,1997; Livelybrooks et al., 1996). 

Because of the advanced nowadays 3-D forward modeling we decide to propose a 3-D 

refinement (Fig 41.b) of the 2-D section in Fig. 41.a, using the same resistivity sequence and 

Cole-Cole parameters and assigning after trial-and-error a final strike length of 15 km to the 

horizontal slab (y direction), shorter than the width of the infinite length slab in the original 2-

D model.

Fig. 42 shows the TM and TE synthetic apparent resistivity pseudosections, derived 

from the new 3D model. Finally, Fig.43 shows the misfit between the field and synthetic 

pseudosections, which has been plotted by assigning at each point of the pseudosections the 

modulus of the discrepancy index ri, given by (Troiano et al., 2014) 

                                                           ri=|(di ?mi)/? i|,                        (2.40) 

where di are the observed data, mi are model responses and ?i are the data errors with 

i=1,2,?,M, M being the total number of measured data. 

The normalized root mean square (rms) misfit has been calculated using the formula (Gabàs 

and Marcuello, 2003) 

                                                         rms=?(?? ri
2/M).                   (2.41) 

Average rms values have been obtained equal to 2.6 for the TM section and 3.1 for the 

TE section.

 Following a previously suggested interpretation paradigm (Mauriello et al., 1996, 

2004), m and ? seem to play an important role mostly in the evaluation of IP effects in 

volcano-geothermal areas. In fact, m can be associated to the degree of alteration and mineral 

particle deposition due to rock-fluid interaction. Within certain limits, the higher is the 

volume percent of alteration products occluding rock fissures and pores, the higher is m. For 

the examined SRP field case, high m values, up to 0.95, have been required to model the MT 

profile, fully consistent with values found in other volcanic and geothermal environments 

(Patella et al., 1991; Coppola et al., 1993; Giammetti et al., 1996; Di Maio et al., 2000; 

Mauriello et al., 2000, 2004).  

 The parameter ?, instead, seems governed by the local temperature, versus which it has 

a rather complex direct proportionality, like in the empirical diagram shown in Fig.44, which 

was derived from the analysis of other partially or totally controlled volcano-geothermal 

conditions (Mauriello et al., 2004). Therefore, the values of ? reported in Fig. 41.a should 

indicate temperatures between 70°C and 125°C in the central part of the slab and between 

50°C and 90°C in the side parts, in the depth range 1.5-2,5 km below the SRP depression. 

These indirect temperature estimates are in full agreement with data from the INEL-1 test 

hole (Mann, 1986).

4 MT METHOD AND RESULTS 
!

Now we disregard the dispersion of the resistivity to dedicate our attention to the 

application, both practical and theoretical, of the magnetotelluric method in two different 

geological environments, the Pecém region (Ceará) and the Potiguar Basin (Rio Grande do 

Norte). The ideal approach to evaluate the possible dispersion of the resistivity in the Pecém 

region is to perform a geoelectrical measurement campaign in order to obtain calculated MT 

curve that we can compare with the measured ones. In the case of Potiguar Basin we know 

that we are dealing with the presence of hydrocarbon reservoir so we can suspect that the 

dispersion of the resistivity may affect the MT data. In this case we have decided to study the 

resistivity dispersion in a future work, when an MT field campaign will be performed in the 

area, preferably a CSAMT campaign (Controlled Source Audio-Magnetotellurics) so as to 

have a better resolution in the first kilometer, and we can compare the measured data with the 

synthetic dispersive ones.  

For now we have concentrated our attention to the use of the classical MT method in 

these two environments. 

!

4.1 Data acquisition 
!

To perform MT and CSAMT data acquisition we arrange over the surface electric and 

magnetic sensors (Fig. 45). Magnetic sensors are positioned in the three orthogonal direction 

x, y, z (NS, WE, depth) are formed by a solenoid that rotate around a high magnetic 

permeability core material which easily retails magnetic field lines. The assembly is inserted 

into a tube whose extremities are electrical contacts that detect potential differences due to the 

passage of current in the solenoid. The electrical sensors consist of a pair of electrodes placed 

into the ground in order to measure the potential difference caused by the passage of electric 

current.    

Unlike magnetic sensors, electrical sensors are positioned only in the two directions x, 

y; the vertical component of the electric field is not measured, being zero the electric 

component at the interface surface – air (Fig.46).

HF Configuration

A wave form editor allows the design of 

any signal forms.

Near field measurements

The transmitter controller box TXB uses 

the same GPS and same electronics as 

the receiver ADU-07e. 

Both signals RX and TX can be used in 

the time domain. 

With time domain data, other methods 

than MT can be used for resistivity - 

depth sounding. The signal can be convoluted against the predicted wave form a geophysical model.

Fig. 5: Signals are recorded at the receiver side (RX) as well as at the transmitter site (TX). 

For complex geological structures or small 3D targets multiple transmitter receiver combinations 

can be used.

Receiver and transmitter can be operated fully automatized by job lists. The user defines a set of 

transmission frequencies and a set of transmission times; the transmission times are equal to the 

receiving times. In case the job list on the receiver can be re-started by mobile phone. This 

guarantees maximum productivity.

4.2 Data processing 
 

From the data acquisition to the interpretation, intermediate steps are required: 

processing and inversion, as shown in the diagram below. 

 

 
 

The processing is a data analysis technique whose goal is to extract from the signal, in 

this case time series (time variations of electrical and magnetic field), functions that are able 

to represent the response of the medium under examination and that can be used to interpret 

the conductive structure. In the MT method, these functions are the values of impedance 

tensor. 

The purpose is to determine with greater precision possible, the surface impedance 

tensor that connects, for each frequency values ?, the horizontal electric field components 

Ex and Ey at the Hx and Hy components of the magnetic field. Fig. 47 shows a limited 

portion of the time series registration of the electric and magnetic field. The signals acquired 

can have extension of minutes or even days, months, depending on the frequency 

component, and consequently the depth, we are interested in. 
 

Figure 47: MT time series. 

!
!

The first step is to pass from time domain to frequency domain applying a Fourier 

Transform to several time windows. 

Data!acquisition Processing Inversion Interpretation 



!

!

82!

Impedance tensor Z does not change very quickly with frequency. For this reason the 

same Z can be associated to an entire frequency band. Generally in order to characterize the 

tendency of an impedance curve, from 6 to 10 frequency points are used per logarithmic 

decade. 

Therefore a fixed number of frequencies are chosen and finally the impedance is 

estimated by least squares technique or robust techniques. Once impedance tensor is 

obtained apparent resistivity and phase values are calculated (Fig. 48). 

 
Figure 48: Apparent resistivity and phase curves. Red and blue curves represents TE and TM modes respectively. 

 

!
 

4.3 Inversion 
 

Geophysical inversion is a mathematical process whose objective is to deduce a cause 

from its effect. In the case of magnetotelluric method, as in many other geophysical 

methods, the purpose of inversion is to reconstruct the subsurface resistivity distribution 

from data measured at the surface. 

The first step is the creation of a direct model, in other words, basing on preliminary 

information of the surface and the subsurface it is calculated the synthetic response of the 

Earth starting from an input model. 

The second step is the comparison of synthetic response data with the measured data 

on the surface, i.e. minimize the difference between measured and synthetic data refining the 

Earth model.

4.4 MT study in Pecém region – Ceará 

 

We present a case study in an area in the Northeast of Brazil, precisely in the west 

coast of the State of Ceará. Pecém is approximately 80 km from the city of Fortaleza. 

Data acquisition was performed with the Geophysical Laboratory of UFC using 

Metronix ADU-06 instrumentation and along a profile parallel to the coastal line were 

performed 5 points of measurements. 

In the figure 49 we can see the position of the MT station and synthetized geology of 

the Pecém region.

The study area is a transition zone between a Pre-Cambrian (Gneiss-migmatitic 

Complex) unit and Tertiarius-Quaternary units formed by sedimentary deposits of the Group 

"Barreiras" (eluvial-coluvial coverage) and the Quaternary units (aeolian, marine and fluvial 

deposits. As it can be seen in Figure 49 the geology of the region is composed by recent 

sedimentary lithologies, lithologies of the Group "Barreiras" and rocks of Ceará Complex; in 

the East portion several granitic rocks are present in the form of granite massifs of high 

morphological features. Several structural trends are oriented in directions North and North-

NorthEast. It is important to note that the lithologies associated with the Ceará Complex - 

Independência Unit are markedly limited and oriented North - NorthEast, inserted in the 

Caninde Unit.

4.4.1 Processing, inversion and interpretation of MT data 
!

 

Data were processed and inverted 2D using the software Winglink 2.01.01. In figure 50 

it is shown the calculated apparent resistivity model. This is the result of the inversion 

smoothed through the Rodi and Mackie algorithm (Rodi and Mackie, 2001) that calculates the 

minimum distribution of resistivity that fits the data at each station. The direct model is 

calculated using finite difference equations analogous to Maxwell's equations.

We can recognize four geoelectrical zones: 

 

• One conductive zone C1 located between the MT stations 3 and 4 extending 

vertically to the base of investigation. This area can be associated, 

geologically, to the Shear Zone Paramonti described in literature (Amaral &amp;amp; 

Santos, 2008). Such interpretation is supported by rock types present in the 

shear zone composed by aluminous metasediments and schists. 

 

• Two zones with resistivities R2 higher than 250 ?m enclosing the conductive 

area C1. This geoelectric zone is associated with the Central Ceará Complex 

represented by Canindé Unit composed by paragneiss, migmatites and 

matabasic rocks. 

 

• The resistive zone R1 with value of resistivity up to 8000?m order is located 

in the eastern section. This geoelectric zone is most likely a major crustal block 

of highly resistive nature that can be associated to the granitic massif of the 

Serra do Juá with a significant geographic and spatial distribution. It is 

noteworthy that the geological mapping by CPRM does not present this 

feature. Parallel to Paramonti shear zone and at a depth of around 6000 meters 

another resistive block can be distinguished, and associated with the Serra do 

Juá mentioned earlier.  

!
 

We tried to make a comparison with the geological data presented by Amaral &amp;amp; 

Santos (2008) that consider supracrustal units as River Curu Unit (CCP2) which would 

correspond to Caninde Unit of CPRM (2003) and the internal rocks as the shear zone 

Paramonti (Paramonti Sequence Amaral &amp;amp; Santos, 2008 - CCP3; Independência Unit of 

CPRM, 2003). The latter composed by aluminium metassediments, mylonite and granulites 

rocks possibly presents the conductive characteristic denoted from the result of the inversion. 

The unit with biotite gneisses locally migmatized and with granodiorites (Ccp4) of 

Amaral &amp;amp; Santos (2008) presents the same resistivity contrasts. 

Finally, it is shown in Figure 52 a new geological context obtained from the MT 

profile and from the interpretations raised from data inversion and considering a number of 

new geological field observations.

The resistive zone, that in the calculated model (Fig. 50) we called R1, is easily 

associated with the granitic massif emerging in the CPRM map near the station MT1. The 

granite rock is characterized by high resistivity values; therefore we can consider the structure 

underneath as a continuation of itself. The conductive area is correlated to the Paramonti 

subduction zone, which exhibits low resistivity values due to the presence of fluids typical of 

the fault zones.

4.5 Potiguar Basin 

 

Potiguar Basin (Bacia) has an extension of approximately 119.300 km2 and is 

localized between the states of Rio Grande do Norte and Ceará, in the northeast of Brazil. The 

emerged portion has an extension of 33.200 km2 and the remaining part of 86.100 km2 is the 

submerged portion. Figure 53 shows the structural geology of the Potiguar Basin.

areas of petroleum field; is possible to see several graben and horts, platforms and faults. Red lines represents the 
faults in the area.

The Potiguar Basin is inserted in the northern portion of the Borborema Province, it 

belongs to the Precambrian geological segment, formed during Pan-African/Brasiliano 

(Neoproterozoic) Orogeny and is characterized by a complex arrangement of tectono-

stratigraphic domains, bounded by zones regional shear and intense granitic magmatism 

(Almeida et al, 1977; Fetter et al., 2003). 

The Potiguar Basin is related to a series of intra-continental basins that compose the 

Rift System in Northeast Brazil (Matos, 1987). There are several models in literature that 

attempt to explain the process of formation of the Potiguar basin. 

For example Françolin &amp;amp; Szatmari (1987) suggest that the origin of the Potiguar Basin 

is related to the evolution of the Atlantic Equatorial Margin started at the end of the Jurassic.

The clockwise rotation between Africa and South America generated stresses in the 

Borborema Province with a resultant East-West compression and Northeast relaxation.  

In Figure 54 we can see the stratigraphy of Potiguar Basin with the principal 

petroliferous systems (Pessoa Neto et al., 2007).

4.5.1 Modelling and simulations in Potiguar Basin  
!
 

We present theoretical MT simulations in order to calculate the MT response in 

presence of hydrocarbon reservoirs. The synthetic responses are performed over a 3-D model 

of the Potiguar Basin, which structure has been obtained from the studies of Bertani et al.,!
1990.  

Simulations, as in the previous cases, are performed using the software WINGLING 

2.01.01. In Figure 55 is shown a geological cross-section of the basin and in Table 1 the 

corresponding resistivity values.

We reconstructed the cross-section showed in Figure 55 in a 3D mesh (Figure 56) 

positioning three areas of hydrocarbon reservoirs, H1, H2 and H3. 

H1 and H2 are very shallow, positioned at a depth of respectively 200 and 300 meters, 

the first area H1 has dimensions 2x2x0.4km, the second area is composed by two blocks, the 

smaller one of dimensions 1.5x2x0.15km and the bigger 2x2x0.45km, reservoir H3 is the

3.5x2x0.8km. 
 

Figure 56: Model of Serra do Mel. 

 

 
 

Since the profile has a big extension MT stations are differently spaced whether they 

are over a reservoir or far from it. In the proximity of the reservoir MT station are 100 meters 

spaced one from each other, then the distance between stations increases up to 4 kilometers. 

We focused our simulation on the areas H2 and H3 showed in the Fig. 57 and 58.

In order to show the effect of reservoirs, pseudosections are performed with and 

without the presence of hydrocarbon and then compared.  

We decided to use two resistivity values for the hydrocarbon reservoirs to study the 

influence on the MT responses. The first value assumed is 750?m, about one order of 

magnitude more resistive than the surrounding host, considering that Oil, and particularly gas, 

increase the resistivity of the sediments (Bjorlykke, K., 2010, Petroleum Geoscience). The

other value taken into account is 5000?m, which is an extreme case meaning that the 

reservoir is fully saturated in hydrocarbon and it does not contain water.  

In Figure 59 we show the TE and TM pseudosections without the presence of the 

reservoir, whilst Figure 60 and Figure 61 show pseudosections in presence of reservoirs. As 

we can see the reservoirs are detected from the MT responses, both cases, resistivity 750?m 

(1°case) and 5000?m (which means a reservoir completely dehydrated, 2° case) show a 

perturbation in the pseudosections that can be quantified with the misfit shown in Figures 62 

and 63.

is positioned, emulating clearly its shape. This makes the interpretation of the results quite 

simple and clear. 

Also for the reservoir H3 two values of the resistivity have been considered, 750?m and 

5000?m, but the results are not so encouraging. Looking at the Figs. 64, 65 and 66 we observe 

that reservoir H3, deeper than H2, is barely visible in the pseudosections (Fig. 65 and 66) and this 

is confirmed by the misfit, in Fig. 67, which values fall within the margin of error of 5%.  

From the simulations we can assume that this is as a case limit for MT detection of 

reservoir in area of Serra do Mel. Through these simulations we have seen that the deeper 

reservoir is a threshold for this geological environment, beyond which the MT method does not 

provide useful information. This is a quite surprising result considering that both the resistivity 

value of the reservoir (5000?m) and its thickness in proportion to the depth are features that 

should highlight the presence of the reservoir. The result obtained should be verified with an MT 

sounding in the area to confirm that it is necessary the use of another geophysical prospecting 

method.

This theoretical study has been performed in order to understand the efficiency of the 

MT method in a geological environment with the specific features of the Potiguar Basin. As 

we have seen the detection of hydrocarbon reservoirs, as well as different types of buried 

structures depends on various factors; resistivity contrast, size of the reservoirs and their 

depths.  

The same structure can be studied considering the dispersion of the resistivity; this is 

an environment in which we can expect the occurrence of the phenomenon and it could be 

very interesting to observe and analyze its effect on the responses.

5 CONCLUSIONS 
!
The use of the MT method, to reconstruct images of the subsurface using electrical 

resistivity contrasts, is constantly in evolution and it is more and more accurate both 

theoretically and experimentally. Nevertheless this methodology is not widely applied and 

frequently its great potential is neglected. 

Although the resistivity dispersion in MT is a well-known phenomenon it is often 

overlooked or ignored in the analysis of MT data. 

For these reasons in this work we have treated both the dispersion of the resistivity in 

MT, and the classical MT method in the Pecém region, never applied before, and in the 

Potiguar Basin where generally the seismic method is used. 

Starting from the MT responses in the cases of 1-D and 2-D polarizable structures we 

have seen, primarily, how a very simple 2-D dispersive structure has an effect on the 

responses curves to the point that the inversion procedure lead to a solution that differs from 

the case without dispersion. We next, using a 3-D modeling software, performed and showed 

the effects on the MT responses of a 3-D polarizable structure and how, applying it to a real 

case, the resistive tridimensional model has a good fit with the experimental data. The type of 

the 3-D structure modeled in this work can be very useful to model geothermal and 

hydrocarbon reservoirs, which likely account for the presence of relevant dispersion effects, 

due to the high degree of alteration produced by the circulation of aggressive fluids. The 

dispersion effects have been evaluated along three parallel profiles, normal to the longitudinal 

axis of the 3-D prism. Amplitude variations of the anomaly above the dispersive body have 

been recognized, depending on the position of the profile from the center to the edges of the 

prism. 

The 3-D MT curves affected by the dispersion as well as the consideration of the 

effect in the Snake River Plain field case show that the inclusion, in the forward 3-D 

modeling, of the resistivity dispersion is a good contribution to a better comprehension of the 

structures in the subsurface. These results invite the MT users to deal with care the areas that 

may manifest the dispersion of the resistivity so as to minimize, as much as possible, the 

interpretation ambiguities. 

From the application of the classical MT method we have seen that it is very effective 

for increasing the geological, tectonic and structural knowledge of the complex environment

of the Pecém region. We have observed its efficiency in resolving very strong resistivity 

contrasts between crustal blocks.  

It is recommended to increase the spatial resolution of MT acquisitions in order to 

better discriminate the targets detected here. A geophysical acquisition with the transient 

electromagnetic method (TDEM) or with the controlled source audio-magnetotellurics 

(CSAMT) at the same location of the MT stations should be made in order to improve the 

resolution of the data in shallower depths, and to aid in filtering. 

The second application of MT, on the structural model of the Potiguar Basin, showed 

through theoretical simulations that within certain limits the presence of hydrocarbon 

reservoir is detected by MT measurements.  

From the pseudosections we have seen that shallow reservoirs are well revealed and 

localized, both if we consider the resistivity value one order of magnitude bigger than the 

surrounding and if the reservoirs are supposed to have a very high resistivity value. 

The case with the deeper reservoir instead does not provide so satisfying results; the 

pseudosections barely show the presence of hydrocarbon, then we can assume this as a case 

limit for the Potiguar Basin geological structure. It could be useful, for this reason, to perform 

in the future an MT data acquisition in the Basin to observe the experimental MT responses in 

this region.
