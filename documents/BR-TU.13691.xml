Resumo  

O café é considerado o segundo produto mais importante no mercado internacional a seguir 

ao petróleo, representando uma importante fonte de receitas e divisas para mais de 60 países 

cafeicultores, muitos dos quais classificados como países em desenvolvimento. A sua importância a 

nível económico e social é inquestionável, visto que centenas de milhões de pessoas dependem, 

directa ou indirectamente, da sua indústria (cultura, processamento, comercialização, entre outros) 

para sobreviver. Actualmente, o mercado do café é considerado rentável e encontra-se em 

crescimento. Porém, pequenas perdas na produção e qualidade deste produto, como aquelas 

causadas por agentes patogénicos, têm consequências socio-económicas nefastas para a maioria dos 

países cafeicultores. Em casos extremos, as populações destes países são mesmo privadas dos 

cuidados básicos (tais como alimentos, medicamentos) e vivem em condições de vida bastante 

precárias. Deste modo, é vital implementar estratégias que visem o aumento da 

produtividade/qualidade do café no mercado internacional e, ao mesmo tempo, protejam a sua 

cultura de doenças epidémicas. Actualmente, várias destas doenças atacam o cafeeiro, sendo de 

destacar a ferrugem alaranjada, causada por Hemileia vastatrix Berkley and Broome, e a antracnose 

dos frutos verdes, causada por Colletotrichum kahawae Waller and Bridge pela sua importância 

económica. A ferrugem alaranjada afecta países cafeicultores por todo o mundo, gerando perdas de 

30% se nenhuma medida de controlo for aplicada. Por outro lado, a antracnose dos frutos verdes 

encontra-se confinada ao continente Africano mas pode gerar perdas de produção mais severas, de 

até 80%. Neste trabalho, será apenas abordada a problemática da ferrugem alaranjada.  

H. vastatrix é um fungo biotrófico que depende das células vivas do hospedeiro para 

completar o seu ciclo de vida. A biotrofia caracteriza-se por um elevado grau de especialização por 

parte do agente patogénico, uma limitada actividade secretora, a formação de um interface rico em 

hidratos de carbono e proteínas entre as membranas celulares do fungo e da planta, a supressão das 

defesas da planta e a indução de genes do hospedeiro específicos para o estabelecimento da 

biotrofia, bem como a diferenciação de haustórios. Os haustórios são hifas especializadas, 

responsáveis não só pela nutrição do fungo, mas também pela emissão/recepção de sinais entre a 

planta e o agente patogénico. A necessidade de compreender toda esta dinâmica levou à realização 

de vários estudos moleculares e bioquímicos em diferentes organismos biotróficos tais como 

Cronartium quercuum, Melampsora lini, M. larici-populina, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, Uromyces 

fabae, U. vignae, e Puccinia spp. Contudo, até à data nenhum estudo semelhante foi realizado em 

H. vastatrix.  

  O principal objectivo deste trabalho foi a identificação e análise da expressão de diversos 



v 
 

genes potencialmente envolvidos no estabelecimento e manutenção da complexa interacção H. 

vastatrix – C. arabica. Para atingir este objectivo, foi ainda efectuada uma validação prévia de 

genes de referência que possam ser utilizados na normalização dos dados de expressão génica, os 

quais poderão constituir uma base para estudos análogos em H. vastatrix. 

 Actualmente várias técnicas podem ser utilizadas na quantificação da expressão génica. O 

PCR quantitativo em Tempo Real é a técnica de excelência nesta área, devido à sua simplicidade, 

sensibilidade e eficiência. No entanto, para que os valores de expressão sejam fidedignos e se 

possam realizar inferências dos resultados com segurança, é essencial uma correcta normalização 

dos genes de estudo. Antes de aplicar esta técnica, é preciso atender ao facto que H. vastatrix é um 

organismo biológico complexo, com certas particularidades, tais como a impossibilidade de crescer 

em cultura artificial (in vitro), o que pode dificultar muito uma correcta validação dos genes de 

referência. Por isso, foi necessário aplicar um passo adicional de normalização que permitisse 

estimar a quantidade do fungo presente nas folhas, durante o processo de infecção. O perfil de 

expressão de oito genes, descritos na literatura como genes de referência, foi analisado e a sua 

estabilidade determinada, com recurso a programas informáticos de vanguarda (GeNorm e 

NormFinder), em três conjuntos de dados distintos: in vitro (uredosporos germinados e apressórios); 

in planta (estruturas de infecção pós penetração); in vitro+ in planta (conjunto de todas as 

amostras). Apesar dos dois programas terem apresentado os mesmos resultados para cada conjunto 

de dados (in vitro, in planta, in vitro+ in planta), a combinação de genes mais estáveis diferia entre 

cada um deles. Assim, Cyt b, 40S_Rib e Hv00099 foram os genes mais estáveis para as amostras in 

vitro, enquanto 40S_Rib, GADPH e Cyt III foram os mais estáveis para as amostras in planta. Para 

o conjunto das amostras (in vitro+in planta) os genes mais estáveis foram 40S_Rib, GADPH e 

Hv00099. Apesar destas diferenças, quando a expressão da proteína G? foi analisada utilizando os 

factores de normalização específicos ou o factor de normalização global (o mesmo para todas as 

amostras), foi obtido um perfil génico semelhante com apenas algumas diferenças pontuais. 

Concluiu-se assim que ambas as estratégias permitiram obter uma normalização adequada, 

estabelecendo-se assim um conjunto de genes de referência para os estudos subsequentes de 

expressão génica, que constituem o objectivo principal deste trabalho. 

 O perfil génico de onze genes potencialmente envolvidos no estabelecimento e manutenção 

da biotrofia foi obtido e a sua função inferida com base em estudos funcionais realizados noutras 

ferrugens. De acordo com a literatura, estes genes estavam envolvidos nos seguintes processos: i) 

modificação da parede celular do fungo para que esta não possa ser reconhecido pela planta (quitina 

desacetilases-CH1 e CH2); ii) vias de sinalização (proteina G? e proteínas cinase mitogenicamente 

activadas-MAPK); iii) transporte de aminoácidos (AAT1_2 e AAT3); iv) transporte e metabolismo 



vi 
 

de açúcares (manitol desidrogenase-MADp1, transportador de hexose-HXT1p e invertase-INV); v) 

interacção com a planta (proteína de ferrugem transferida-RTP1p).  

 A grande maioria destes genes revelou um perfil de expressão muito semelhante ao 

previamente descrito para outros fungos patogénicos, como por exemplo U. fabae, embora 

diferenças inesperadas tenham sido observadas para a quitina desacetilase, cujo aumento de 

expressão nas fases finais de infecção nunca tinha sido observado. MAPK também apresenta um 

perfil de expressão diferente do observado em outras ferrugens, uma vez que apenas é activada após 

a invasão do hospedeiro e não durante a formação dos apressorios, como foi previamente descrito. 

Este resultado sugere que este gene possa estar especificamente envolvido no processo de 

estabelecimento e manutenção da biotrofia, no entanto estudos funcionais são necessários para uma 

melhor compreensão do verdadeiro papel desta enzima. Por outro lado, os genes envolvidos na 

nutrição do fungo, tanto no transporte de aminoácidos como no transporte e metabolismo de 

açúcares, têm um perfil de expressão semelhante ao de U. fabae, o que claramente sugere uma 

elevada conservação nos genes responsáveis pela nutrição do fungo, durante o processo de 

biotrofia. Finalmente, como esperado, a RTP1 só foi detectada nas folhas infectadas, o que 

claramente sugere que também em H. vastatrix esta enzima pode estar envolvida na manutenção da 

biotrofia.  

Os resultados apresentados neste trabalho permitiram pela primeira vez a quantificação 

relativa da biomassa de fungo presente nas folhas infectadas durante o processo de infecção. Visto 

que tal estratégia nunca foi aplicada, foi aberto um novo caminho para estudos de expressão não só 

em H. vastatrix, mas também para outros agentes patogénicos de plantas com as mesmas limitações 

e dificuldades. Adicionalmente, desvendamos pela primeira vez alguns aspectos do processo 

molecular envolvido na complexa interacção C. arabica - H. vastatrix. Este conhecimento poderá 

contribuir para o desenvolvimento de estratégias de controlo de doenças bastante mais eficazes do 

que as aplicadas actualmente.

Abstract 

Hemileia vastatrix, the causal agent of coffee leaf rust, is a biotrophic fungus with a worldwide 

distribution, causing serious social and economic problems in coffee growing countries. Expression 

studies may have a key role in unraveling the transcriptomics of this pathogen as well as its complex 

gene-for-gene-based interaction with the host. However, a proper normalization is required to obtain 

reliable results. In this way the expression stability of eight reference genes (GADPH, EF-1, ?-Tubulin, 

Cyt III, Cyt b, Hv00099, Ubi, 40S_Rib) was analyzed and two strategies were defined as fit for 

normalization. The first part of this work allowed the correct validation of reference genes to H. 

vastatrix. In the second part of this work, the gene expression profile of eleven H. vastatrix genes were 

analyzed (CH1, CH2, G?-protein, MAP Kinase, AAT1_2, AAT3, INV, HXT1p, MAD1p, Asp_AT and 

RTP1p) for being putatively involved in the establishment and maintenance of the biotrophy. The 

expression profile of chitin deacetylases (CH1 and CH2) and G?-protein revealed that these enzymes 

are involved in the establishment of the biotrophy during the early stages of infection. However, up 

regulation of CH1 in late infection stages in H. vastatrix is unparalleled in other rusts. The MAP kinase 

gene was only activated after host invasion and not during appressoria formation, unlike its 

homologues in other fungi, suggesting that this gene could be specifically involved in the establishment 

of the biotrophy. Amino acid transporters (AAT1_2 and AAT3), Invertase (INV), Hexose transporter 

(HXT1p) and Manitol desidrogenase (MAD1p) present similar expression profiles to Uromyces fabae, 

suggesting a fairly conserved process among rust fungi. Finally, the RTP1p seems to be highly 

expressed in planta, but not in the in vitro phases, suggesting a similar function to U. fabae. Overall, 

our results have provided valuable insights at the molecular level to the current understanding of the 

biotrophic interaction between H. vastatrix – C. arabica.

Introduction 

Coffee was one of the first tropical crops to become a truly global commodity. By the early eighteenth 

century, coffee industry spanned the globe, linking consumers in Europe (which subsequently increased 

in North America) with producers in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. This agricultural commodity has 

an estimated retail value of 70 billion dollars and its industry is perceived as prosperous. But, although 

the coffee business is booming in consuming developed countries, recurrent price decreases cause 

immense hardship to countries where coffee production is a key economic activity, as well as to the 

farmers who produce it. As a consequence, during such periods of lower prices, life quality decreases 

considerably in developing countries that rely to a greater or lesser extent on its foreign exchange 

earnings for financing essential imports and services.  

An additional problem for coffee producing countries is the occurrence of major epidemic diseases 

such as Coffee Leaf Rust (or orange rust), caused by Hemileia vastatrix Berkeley and Broome, since it 

limits the coffee production and increase the plight of farmworkers. Therefore, disease management has 

revealed as one of the most important steps in the coffee production system. Over the last decades there 

has been a marked shift away from the reliance on pesticides for disease control, towards a more 

integrated approach using various methods, including the use of resistant varieties. However, an 

understanding of the biology of these pathogens is essential and increasingly regarded as one of the 

foundations for the selection of sources of long-lasting resistance.  

Focused on the genetic basis of H. vastatrix and its complex gene for gene interaction with the host, the 

present work intends to identify some of the genes involved in the infection process of H. vastatrix as 

well as to characterize their expression profiles, leading to a more informed deployment of resistant 

varieties.  

Before presenting this work, a brief general introduction was made on the most relevant aspects of the 

host, the pathogen, H. vastatrix, and the plant-pathogen interaction. Genes were selected in the 

literature for their relevant role in the life and pathogenesis (or as reference genes) of other rust fungi, 

and homologues were searched in H. vastatrix using degenerated PCR primers derived from the 

comparison of such gene sequences. This preliminary task is reported in the supplemental material of 

both articles (genes used as reference genes are reported in the first article, while those involved in life 

and pathogenicity are reported in the second article). In the first article, an accurate normalization for 



2 

Real Time Quantitative PCR is presented and the best reference genes selected. The second article uses 

the previously validated reference genes to study the expression profile of genes involved in the 

establishment and maintenance of a H. vastatrix – C. arabica compatible interactions.  

1. The Host Coffea  

 1.1 Economic importance  

Coffee is the most important agricultural commodity, second only to oil in world trade1,2, and became 

crucial for the economy of more than 60 developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America 

(Figure1)3,4,5. Currently, its cultivation, processing, trading, transportation and marketing provides 

employment for hundreds of millions people worldwide4,5. In Ethiopia, for example, more than 700,000 

families are involved in coffee production and more than 25 million people depend on the coffee 

industry, directly or indirectly, to survive4. Thus, even small losses in yield and quality of coffee 

production have high socio-economic consequences for the coffee growing countries, which often rely 

on coffee revenues to sustainability. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

According to the International Coffee Organization (ICO), coffee production in 2008/2009 was over 

128.1 million bags (1 bag = 60 kg) with a retail value of 70 billion USD 4, being Brazil, Vietnam and 

Indonesia, responsible for almost 60% of this value 4. From the total production, 75% comes from C. 

Figure 1. Coffee growing countries.

arabica (mainly from Latin America and East Africa) and the remaining from C. canephora and 

marginally from C. liberica (mainly from Africa and Asia). Regardless of cultivated species, Africa is 

responsible for 11% of the total world production, Asia and Oceania for the 26 % and Latin America 

for 63 %4.  

Finally, it is important to note that coffee production represents one of the few solutions to fight 

poverty in developing countries and thus, the maintenance of acceptable production levels is primal for 

the life quality of millions of people. 

 1.2. Taxonomy  

The first botanical description of the coffee plant was made in 1713 by Antoine-Laurent Jussieu who 

classified it as Jasminum arabicanum. Later, this classification was reviewed in 1731 by Linnaeus, 

which included it in the Coffea genus of the Rubiaceae family6. Cronquist, in 19887 made the more 

recently taxonomic classification of the Coffea genus7. 

Kingdom: Plantae 

 Division: Magnoliophyta 

  Class: Magnoliopsida 

   Order: Rubiales 

    Family: Rubiaceae 

     Genus: Coffea 

 

At the intrageneric level, Chevalier (1947), based on the geographical distribution and fruit 

characteristics, established four sectors for the genus Coffea: Paracoffea, Argocoffea, Mascarocoffea 

and Eucoffea8. However, with the implementation of new tools (molecular, biochemical and 

cytogenetic) a great progress has been made on the Taxonomic level9 . Currently, the genus Coffea 

encompasses two subgenera: Coffea subgen Coffea and Coffea subgen Baracoffea and 103 described 

species10,11. However, only two species are economically important: C. arabica, also known as Arabica 

Coffee and C. canephora also known as Robusta Coffee11.  

 



4 

 1.3. General characteristics 

Coffea spp. grows in the tropical and sub-tropical countries (25º North-25º South), requiring very 

specific environmental conditions for its production. Rainfall, sunlight, wind and soils are all important 

to produce a quality coffee, but the specific requirements vary according to the species grown1,12 C. 

arabica is native to Ethiopian tropical forests and is adapted to the following conditions: Altitudes of 

1600-2800m, little seasonal temperature fluctuations (20-28ºC), and a well distributed rainfall (1600-

2000mm) with a dry season lasting 3-4 months12. This specie is responsible for the production of the 

best quality coffee, with lower caffeine content4.  

C. canephora is native to the lowland forests of the Congo river basin, which extends up to lake 

Victoria in Uganda, and therefore is adapted to the following conditions: Altitudes of up to 1200m, very 

little seasonal temperature fluctuations (24º-26ºC), and rainfall higher than 2000 mm distributed over a 

9-10 month period12. This species is responsible for the production of a coffee with higher caffeine 

content, widely used in the production of soluble coffee4. 

 1.4. Origin and dissemination  

The history of coffee cultivation is incompletely documented with regards to the domestication of 

coffee plants in Africa and their dispersal throughout the world by man 2. This event was characterized 

by successive reductions of diversity within the two subpopulations of wild coffee introduced from 

Ethiopia to Yemen (575 AD)2,13,14. Further reductions in diversity were produced at the beginning of the 

18th century. Firstly, the Dutch East Indian Company stated to establish the coffee planting industry in 

Indonesia. Later, in 1710 a single plant from Java was introduced to the Amsterdam botanical gardens 

and some of the young seedlings obtained from this tree were taken to Suriname, onwards to French 

Guiana and from thence to Brazil. Subsequently, the coffee crop rapidly dispersed throughout most of 

the suitable locations in Latin America, not only from sources within the continent but also from 

Reunion island. In the African continent, despite being the place of origin of Arabica coffee, most of 

the current commercial plantations have resulted from re-introductions mainly from South America and 

Reunion2,13,14 Therefore, the history of domestication of coffee crops is recent and is characterized by 

several bottleneck events, which strongly narrowed down the genetic diversity of plants in cultivation 

throughout the world, with obvious consequences on the emergence and spread of diseases.

2. The pathogen Hemileia vastatrix 

 2.1. Economic Relevance  

Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR), caused by H. vastatrix, is the most important disease of C. arabica, the most 

economically relevant coffee species15,16,17,18. This disease may cause up to 30% yield losses in coffee 

crops, if no control measures are applied18,19, which leads to economic losses of US$ 1-2 billion per 

year5,20. Considering that most of the coffee producing countries are still in development, these losses 

can be particularly burdensome and create severe economical distress. In this way, Coffee Leaf Rust 

has been classified as one of the seven most important diseases and pests of tropical crops20.  

One of the most dramatic examples of its devastating potential occurred the nineteenth century in Sri 

Lanka, where coffee plantations were ravaged, and in less than 28 years all coffee exports had stopped. 

The losses were so devastating that the annual coffee production of Sri Lanka decreased from 42 

million to 3 million kg. As a result, in 1890 almost every coffee plantation was abandoned21,22. 

Currently, tea instead of coffee is produced in Sri Lanka and, the cup of tea, rather than coffee, has 

become a familiar part of the British culture.  

 2.2. Taxonomy 

H. vastatrix was first described by Berkeley and Broome from C. arabica leaves in Sri Lanka. H. 

vastatrix has been classified in the Index Fungorum (www.indexfungorum.org) as:   

Kingdom: Fungi  

 Phylum: Basidiomycota 

  Class: Pucciniomycetes 

   Order: Pucciniales 

    Family: Incertae sedis 

     Genus: Hemileia 

      Species: Hemileia vastatrix

 2.3. Origin  

Despite being native of Ethiopia, H. vastatrix was first recorded in 1861 by a British explorer in the 

Lake Vitoria (East Africa) 5,19,20,21. However, only in 1869 (Sri Lanka) it caused the first great epidemic. 

Since then, it has spread to most of the coffee growing countries worldwide in three waves. Between 

1870 and 1920, it spread through the coffee zones of the Indian Ocean Basin and the Pacific. In the 

1950 and 1960, it broke out in the burgeoning coffee farms of Africa Atlantic countries. Finally, it 

crossed the Atlantic Ocean during 1970 and 1980, and spread throughout the coffee zones of South 

America 5 20,21. 

 2.4. Genetic variability 

The first race differentiation of H. vastatrix was carried out by Mayne (1932) in India, who 

differentiated the local rust samples into four physiologic races19 23. No other studies were made on the 

physiological specialization of H. vastatrix until D’Oliveira initiated a world survey of coffee rust races 

in 1952 in Portugal19. The work carried out at the Coffee Rusts Research Center (CIFC) enabled the 

characterization of about 45 rust races, which have been inferred based on Flor's gene-to-gene concept. 

Currently, 9 virulence genes (v1-v9) of H. vastatrix were inferred based on nine genes (SH1-SH9)19,23.  

 2.5. Life cycle 

In nature, H. vastatrix produces only the uredinal, telial and basidial stages19,20 The dycariotic 

uredospores (asexual stage) germinate and infect the coffee leaves, being responsible for the 

disease19,20,24. The teliospores are seldom in the coffee leaves and, like uredospores, could to be present 

in the pustules (spores release). This structure differentiates into basidiospores (sexual phase) after a 

meiosis, but seems to be unable to infect the coffee leaves. The basidiospores of H. vastatrix germinate 

on the surface of coffee leaves, but afterwards they are not able to invade the host. In this way, the 

function of teliospores and basidiospores in the life cycle of H. vastatrix remains unclear20,24.  

Due to the inability of teliospores and basidiospors to invade the host, H. vastatrix is generally 

considered heteroecious (requires two host to complete its life cycle). However, the alternate host as 

well as the aecial and pycnial stages of the pathogen remains unknown 20,24.

 2.6. Dispersion 

The dissemination process of H. vastatrix uredospores is deeply dependent on the wind and rain and 

involves the following processes: removal from the host, transport through the air, and deposition on a 

new host25 26. Events such as winds and storms are responsible for the dissemination of spores at great 

distances, while the rain, mainly the rain splash, is responsible for the spores dispersion at short 

distances 21 20. The spread of spores by the rain splash has additional advantages, such as spore 

protection from dissection and loss of viability in dry weather. Insects, birds, human and others 

animals, may also come in contact with the infected leaves and become a disease vector. Special 

attention must be paid for men, since it is one of the most important vectors on the dissemination of the 

disease throughout coffee crops worldwide 20,21,26. Currently, the dissemination from one continent to 

another has been attributed to wind currents and transport of contaminated coffee seeds and other plant 

material 20,21,25,26. 

 2.7. Infection process 

The infection process of H. vastatrix begins with the host-surface recognition in which, the uredospores 

recognize the chemical and physical properties of the plant surface and germinate, differentiating an 

appressoria over the stomata (Figure 2B)19. During germination, an optimal temperature of 24 ºC (20-

30ºC) and the presence of water are crucial, otherwise, the entire process is aborted 20.  

After the appressoria formation, the fungus penetrates the host through the stomata forming a 

penetration hypha that grows into the substomatal chamber (Figure 2C) 15,19,20. This hypha produces 

two thick lateral branches; each hypha with its branches resembles an anchor (Figure 2D). Each lateral 

branch of the anchor differentiate into an haustorial mother cell (HMC) that gives rise to an 

haustorium, which primarily infects the stomatal subsidiary cells (Figure 2E)15,19,27. The fungus 

continues it growth with formation of more intercellular hypha, including HMCs, and a large number 

of haustoria in the cells of the spongy and palisade parenchyma and even of the upper epidermis 

(Figure 2F)15,19,27. From 21 days after infection, a dense mycellium is observed below the penetration 

area and a uredosporic sorus protrudes like a “bouquet” through the stoma (Figure 2G)19. After all this 

process, the spores spread to new coffee leaves and the process restart once favorable conditions are 

met.

2.8. Symptoms  

In susceptible plants, the first symptom are small chlorotic spots on the lower surface of the infected 

leaves, followed by sorus release and premature fall of the leaves (Figure3.A and 3.B)5,21. This 

premature shedding weakens coffee trees and affects, year by year, the production of wood needed to 

bear the future crop. Usually, CLR does not kill the tree, but progressively weakens it, resulting in 

severe die-back, since this process deprives the coffee plant from the vital nutrient obtained through the 

leaves via photosynthesis. The subsequent infection of new leaves after the fall of the older leaves are

very common and sometimes cause a severe reduction on the yield of coffee berries5,21.  

 

 

  

2.9. Control  

Chemical control, mainly using cupric fungicides, is the most widely used method to control CLR28. 

However, it has revealed some disadvantages when implemented, namely the economic costs directly 

associated with fungicide purchase and application19,23,29. Moreover, in the rainy seasons, the chemicals 

are washed by the rain, losing their ability to suppress the host invasion 30 31 and forcing the farmers to 

apply more fungicides. Thus, during low yield years, chemical control has to be carried out 2-3 times 

per year, while during the high yield years this application increase to 4-6 times for year28. However, 

most of smallholders, who produce the majority of the Arabica coffee, are usually unable to carry these 

spray programs completely, decreasing the success of this control measure28.  

As compared to the chemical control, the cultivation of resistant varieties is a more sustainable disease 

control strategy. Breeding programs have been developed on research centers worldwide, mostly 

supported by resistant plant material selected and characterized at CIFC. This strategy has great 

advantages such as lower costs for farmers, environmental sustainability, and theoretically a long-term 

solution to coffee leaf rust19,23. Currently, several cultivars with high yield, good organoleptic 

characteristics, and a notable resistance to H. vastatrix have been developed. The Híbrido de Timor 

(HDT, a natural hybrid between C. arabica and C. canephora) was the progenitor of varieties such as 

Catimor (Caturra x HDT), Sarchimor (Villa Sarchi x HDT) and Cavimor (Catuai x HDT) are successful

leaves; B) Pustules of uredosporic sori on the lower side of the leaves.

examples of these breeding programs22. 

However, the coffee plant resistance may be overcame by the evolving pathogen, and thus 

developmental studies with the aiming of better understand the pathogenicity of this harmful fungus 

and its interaction with the host are crucial, in order to improve the breeding programs and leading to a 

more sustainable agriculture.  

3. Plant-pathogen interactions 

Plants in nature are generally resistant to most pathogens.29. Plants have the ability to recognize 

potential invading pathogens and have developed various elaborate defense mechanisms to ward off 

pathogen attack. At the same time, pathogens have developed strategies to compromise plant resistance 

mechanisms, in what must have been an evolutionary game of “ping-pong”19,29. Some of these 

mechanisms are constitutively expressed and provide physical and chemical barriers while others are 

induced only after pathogen attack19. The idea that successful pathogens suppress host defenses, and in 

some instance redirect cellular processes to create an environment that is favorable for their 

proliferation is accepted and very common in biotrophic fungi like H. vastatrix29. However, for some 

pathogens, the ability to suppress host defenses depends on the pathotype, which can be explained by 

gene-for-gene theory. 

 3.1.Gene-for-gene theory 

Half a century ago, Harold Flor's historical landmark publication revealed that the interaction between 

flax and flax rust (Melampsora lini) is governed by single resistance (R) genes in the plant and 

complementary avirulence (avr) genes in the pathogen32,33,34,35,36,37. Based on this strictly genetic model 

of gene-for-gene resistance, many scientists envisaged R proteins as receptors that specifically bind to a 

matching avr ligand, enabling recognition of the pathogen and subsequent elicitation of an array of 

plant defense responses that eventually lead to resistance32. In this case, the host and the pathogen 

establish a incompatible interaction. By contrast, pathogen can evolve in order to avoid plant 

recognition, leading to a late activation of plant defense mechanisms 33,37,38,39. In this case, pathogen 

colonizes the host tissues, establishing an compatible interaction with the host.  

Currently, several avirulence genes were already identified and characterized in other pathosystems 

such as Tomato – Cladosporium fulvum, Arabidopsis-Peronospora parasitica and Arabidopsis-



11 

Pseudomonas syringae, Flax- Melampsora lini38,67. For other pathogens such as H. vastatrix, despite 

strong evidence of the presence of avirulence genes (classical genetics), their identification and 

characterization at molecular level has not been possible.  

 3.2. Biotrophic lifestyle  

Rust fungi, such as H. vastatrix, establish a biotropic interaction with the host 40 41. In this kind of 

parasitism, pathogen feeds from living host cells, and the host as a whole suffers only minor damage 

over a longer period of time. Further, the pathogen is dependent on the living host plant to complete its 

life cycle42. The advantage of this kind of parasitism is the unlimited access, through altered plant 

translocation patterns, to the plant nutrients43. However, current evidence suggests that biotrophy 

requires an impressive degree of cellular interaction between plant and parasite, perhaps explaining 

why so few fungal pathogens exploit this type of parasitism43. Several studies conducted in order to 

better understand this type of parasitism establish the following properties as hallmarks of biotrophy: 1) 

Obligate biotrophs are not culturable in vitro (although research in some rust fungi has enabled in vitro 

cultivation in some extent); 2) They form highly differentiated infection structures (; 3) They have 

limited secretory activity; 4) They establish a narrow contact zone separating fungal and plant plasma 

membranes; 5) They engage in a long-term suppression of host defense responses; 6) They form 

haustoria (specialized hyphae that penetrates host cells) 19,40,41,42.  

The haustoria, due to its role in the establishment and maintenance of the biotrophy, have been studied 

for plant pathologists, since their first description by Zanardini about 150 years ago41,44. Already in 

naming these structures [fr. L. haurine (haurio, hausi, haustum): to drink, to draw] de Bary (1863) 

propose one of the possible functions for the haustoria - the uptake of nutrients from the host. However, 

knowledge about this key element of the obligate biotrophic lifestyle is still fairly scarce 40,41,44. The 

main reasons for this are the preserving lack of functional transformation system for haustoria forming 

fungi and the fact that these organs are not formed in culture44. Molecular biology, however, opened a 

new dimension to investigate the role(s) of haustoria41. In 1997, Hahn &amp;amp; Mendgen45 developed 

techniques for isolating haustoria from host leaves, allowing the identification of genes preferentially 

expressed in the haustoria of Uromyces fabae (first haustorium-specific cDNA libray) 45. Currently, 

haustoria have been documented as primary in the fungal survival, since they are responsible for 

nutrient uptake and information exchange between the host and pathogen40,41,42,44. Additionally, it must 

not be recognized as foreign by the host, in order to avoid defense mechanisms, and should be capable 



12 

to modify the host metabolism to ensure total access to its nutrients41. Finally, it is important to note 

that haustoria are not truly intracellular: they breach the cell wall only and a newly formed host plasma 

membrane (the extrahaustorial membrane) surrounds them, resulting in a close association of fungal 

and plant membranes, separated only by a thin fungal wall and an extrahaustorial matrix.  The 

extrahaustorial matrix is the site for translocation of nutrients and exchange of information, providing 

the optimal conditions for the maintenance of the biotrophy40,41,44,46.  

 3.3 Genes putatively involved in the establishment and maintenance of the biotrophy 

As previously stated, biotrophy requires an impressive degree of cellular interaction between plant and 

parasite. In this way, rusts need to suppress host defense reactions, assimilate nutrients from the plant 

and reprogram the host's metabolic flow, in order to survive41. Several studies in rust fungi, mainly in 

Uromyces fabae, began to unravel some genes involved in these processes. However, a long road still 

needs to be traveled in order to understand all the strategies developed by the rust to survive.  

  3.3.1 Suppression of host defense 

Rust fungi, developed several mechanisms in order to avoid plant recognition and tolerate various 

stress factors induced by the plant during the early stages of the infection process. Currently, several 

genes such as PIG 11 (Metallothionein), PIG 16 (cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases (P-450s)), chitin 

deacetylase, G-Protein and MAP Kinase, were described as deeply involved in these processes. 

Metallothionein (PIG11), protects plant pathogen cells against toxic concentrations of heavy metals as 

well as free oxygen radicals produced by the plant during the hypersensitive response47,48. P-450s 

catalyze a variety of oxygenation reactions on a large spectrum of substrates. While some of them are 

involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, such as hormones and toxins, the majority of P-

450s are involved in detoxification of the pathogen when exposed to toxic plant metabolites45. Chitin 

deacethylases, seems to be responsible for the conversion of chitin (cell wall component of pathogen 

able to be recognized by the plant) to chitosan. This strategy during the intracellular growth may 

protect hyphae of plant pathogenic fungi from being lyzed by extracellular plant chitinases, since the 

chitosan is a poor substrate for plant chitinases49,50,51. The fungal G protein, mainly G? – protein, not 

only plays a pivotal role in the regulation of several signaling pathways crucial to fungal survival, but is 

also involved in fungal development and pathogenicity52,53,54,55. The MAP kinase pathway is one of the 

most important signaling cascades regulated by G? - protein and has been associated, by several 



13 

studies, with fungal pathogenicity53,54. The critical importance of these enzymes was proved in studies 

with Cryptococcus neoformans, Magnaporthe grisea, Cochliobolus heterostrophus and Fusarium 

oxysporum, in which a single a mutation in G? – protein or MAPK led to an incorrect appressoria 

formation and a decrease/total loss of fungal pathogenicity56,57,58. 

  3.3.2 Nutrient uptake 

As previously described, biotrophic fungi are entirely dependent on plant living cells to their growth 

and reproduction. In this way, nutrient uptake (sugar uptake and amino acid transport) is one of the 

most vital process for these organisms and involves several genes such as Amino acid transport (AAT1; 

AAT2; AAT3), Hexose transporter (HXTP1), Invertase (INV), Manitol desidrogenase (MAD1p), Beta-

glucosidases (BGL) and Glucokinase (GLK)41.  

Since 1997, three putative secondary transporters of amino acids were identified and characterized in 

Uromyces fabae. AAT1p, was recently characterized as a broad specificity amino acid secondary active 

transporter with a main specificity for L-histidine and L-lysine. This amino acid transporter was 

expressed at all developmental phases of Uromyces fabae, preferentially in the haustoria59. AAT3p, 

exhibits a substrate preference for L-leucine and the sulphur containing amino acids L-methionine and 

L-cysteine60. As AAT1 the expression of AAT3 does not seem to be restricted to haustoria60. Finally, a 

specific subtract has not been identified for AAT2, but it is only expressed in haustoria61. Taken 

together it seems that amino acid uptake in U. fabae is not limited to hasutoria, but preferentially 

occurs in this structure41.  

The sugar uptake is a complex process that aims to nourish the fungus by the plant. In this way, 

biotrophic fungi must be able to convert sucrose, the most abundant carbohydrate source produced by 

the plant, in their own nutrient source. Studies in U. fabae began to unravel some of these processes as 

well as the enzymes and sugars involved41. Since biotrophic fungi is unable to directly use sucrose as a 

nutrient source, the primary function of INV is the cleavage of sucrose into D-glucose and D-frutose62. 

An additional source, at least for the D-glucose, could be a Beta- glucosidases, since this enzyme has 

the capacity to use cellobiose, a breakdown product of cellulose, as a substrate, and consequently, could 

use degradation products of the plant cell wall available for its nutrition63. Subsequently, this 

monosaccharides (D-glucose and D-frutose) will be transfer into the haustoria by the HXT1p53. Once 

inside the haustoria, the monosaccharides will be converted into a nutrient source that can be used by 



14 

the pathogen. GLK1 and MAD1p have a crucial role in this process, since the first one converts D-

glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, the direct source of energy, and the second one converts the D-frutose 

to manitol, the fungal storage compound41,64,65. Moreover, MAD1p and INV, seem to have an additional 

role in the fungal survival and maintenance of biotrophy. In this way, MAD1p is also responsible for 

the nutrient mobilization in germinating uredospores, allowing for fungal nutrition before the 

establishment of the biotrophy (haustoria formation) and INV is responsible for the additional sucrose 

supply at the infected leaves during all the developmental phases of the pathogen62,64 and it was also 

suggested that fungal invertases present in the apoplast are able to limit export of carbohydrates from 

the infected tissue via the phloem, conditioning the plant tissue for a conversion from source to sink62. 

 3.3.3 Reprogramming the host’s metabolic flow 

Several studies, in Melampsora lini and Uromyces fabae, showed evidences that avirulence proteins 

from the rust fungi are recognized inside the plant cell. These proteins are also likely to be synthesized 

and secreted specifically by the fungal haustorium and must be transported from the extracellular 

matrix across the host plasma membrane. The first gene detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of host 

cells was detected in U. fabae66. RTP1 interferes with plant gene expression, but the molecular basis of 

this interference remains unclear41. To understand the exact biochemical function of RTP1p in plant 

cells, complementary structural and molecular insights from the identified functional core of RTP1p are 

essential. It is therefore crucial to determine the 3D structure of RTP1p functional domain41. Regardless 

the validation of these specific functions the role of RTP1p in the maintenance of the biotrophy is 

unquestionable.

Abstract 

Hemileia vastatrix, the causal agent of coffee leaf rust, is a biotrophic fungus with a worldwide 
distribution, causing serious social and economic problems in coffee growing countries. Expression 
studies may have a key role unraveling the transcriptomics of this pathogen as well as its complex 
gene-for-gene-based interaction with the host. Real time Quantitative PCR is the golden standard for 
gene expression analysis, although an accurate normalization is essential for adequate conclusions. 
Reference genes are often used for this purpose, but the stability of their expression levels requires 
validation under experimental conditions. Further, biotrophic fungi undergo important biomass 
variations along its infection process in planta, which raises the need for an adequate method to 
normalize the proportion of fungal cDNA in the total plant+fungus cDNA pool. In this work, the 
expression profiles of eight reference genes (GADPH, EF-1, ?-Tubulin, Cyt III, Cyt b, Hv00099, Ubi, 
40S_Rib) were analyzed across 28 samples, obtained in vitro (germinated uredospores and appressoria) 
and in planta (post-penetration fungal growth phases), to determine the most stable reference genes. 
Gene stability was assessed using the statistical algorithms incorporated in GeNorm and NormFinder 
software. Cyt b, 40S_Rib and Hv00099 were the most stable gene for in vitro dataset, while 40S_Rib, 
GADPH and Cyt III were the most stable in planta. For the combined datasets (in vitro+in planta), 
40S_Rib, GADPH and Hv00099 were selected as the most stable. Subsequent tests on the G? - protein 
expression showed that the reference genes selected for the combined dataset do not differ significantly 
from those selected specifically for the in vitro and in planta datasets. Our study provides tools for 
correct validation of reference genes in obligate biotrophic plant pathogens, as well as the basis for RT-
qPCR studies in H. vastatrix.

1. Introduction  
 Gene expression analysis plays an important role in enhancing our understanding of the 
signaling and metabolic pathways which underlie cellular and developmental processes (Hu et al., 
2009). Although several methods have been used to quantify gene expression, including Northern 
blotting, RNase protection assay, in situ hybridization and cDNA microarray technology, real-time 
quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is considered the gold standard for quantifying gene expression, thanks to 
its sensitivity, specificity, dynamic range and high throughput capacity (Bustin et al., 2005; Fang et al., 
2006; Freeman et al, 1999; Udvardi et al., 2008; Walker et al., 2009). This technique can detect very 
low quantities of a target transcript even if only a few copies are present in the sample (Wong and 
Medrano, 2005). However an accurate normalization is required to obtain a reliable quantification of 
the transcript (Derveaux et al., 2010; Huggett et al. 2005; Thellin et al., 1999). 

Until now, several procedures have been proposed to normalize RT-qPCR data such as sample 
size, RNA total quantification, genomic DNA and artificial molecules (Cruz et al., 2009; Huggett et al. 
2005; Teste et al., 2009). However, none of them is appropriate for this technique, since they do not 
take into account sample variations, such as differences in the quantity and quality of RNA, and 
efficiencies of reverse transcription or PCR (Cruz et al., 2009; Huggett et al. 2005; Teste et al., 2009; 
Walker et al., 2009). On the other hand, internal control genes (references genes) are the most 
commonly used to normalize RT-qPCR data, though the success of this procedure relies on the 
appropriate choice of control genes (Dheda et al., 2005; Olsvik et al., 2005; Thellin et al., 1999). 
Typically, reference genes need to exhibit two major properties: firstly they should be essential for the 
maintenance of cellular function and viability, and therefore should be constitutively expressed in all 
tissues; secondly, their transcription should not be affected by the conditions understudy (Derveaux et 
al., 2010; Dheda et al., 2005; Paolacci et al., 2009; Stürzenbaum et al., 2001; Thellin et al., 1999; Wong 
and Medrano, 2005). However, some evidences show that all genes seem to be regulated under some 
conditions and there are always some variations in transcript levels, so that none of the commonly 
exploited genes can be viewed as a universal reference gene (Dheda et al., 2005; Stürzenbaum et al., 
2001; Thellin et al., 1999). In many cases, the use of, a single reference gene is inadequate, and can 
produce wrong biological conclusions (Dheda et al., 2005; Hu et al., 2009; Stürzenbaum et al., 2001; 
Teste et al., 2009). Additionally, gene expression studies as well as reference gene validations are 
mainly limited to human or classical laboratory organisms and non-model species often suffer from 
lack of background information available (Axtner and Sommer, 2009). For all these reasons, it is 
essential a careful evaluation of one or even more suitable reference genes prior to the determination of 
the gene profiles, especially in non-model species. In this way, several programs like geNorm 
(Vandesompele et al., 2002) and NormFinder (Andersen et al., 2004) are often used. These methods are 
based on different statistical algorithms aimed at choosing the most stable reference genes, in order to 
correctly normalize the RT-qPCR results (Andersen et al., 2004; Pfaffl et al., 2004; Vandesompele et 
al., 2002). However, choosing the most suitable statistical method can be confusing, since each 
program has the potential to deliver different results. Thus, a combined analysis may be the best 
strategy to follow.  

Actin, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH), Ribosomal genes (28S; 18S), 
Elongation factor (ef1) and ?-tubulin are frequently used as reference genes for RT-qPCR without a 
proper validation, which may jeopardize the reliably of data (Bohle et al., 2007; Fang et al., 2006; Kim 
et al., 2003; Nicot et al., 2005). 

In fungi (and Oomycetes), the determination of the most stable genes for expression studies was 
only carried out for a limited number of species such as Aspergillus niger (Bohle et al., 2007), 



18 

Metarhizium anisopliae (Fang et al., 2006), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Teste et al., 2009) and 
Phytophthora parasitica (Yan and Liou, 2006). As expected, different reference genes were selected for 
each species: Actin, Secretion associated GTP-binding protein (sarA) and Cytochrome c oxidase 
(Cox5) were selected as the most stable genes in Aspergillus niger; in Metarhizium anisopliae, 
Elongation factor (EF-1), GADPH and Tryptophan biosynthesis enzyme (tryp) were the most stable; 
the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Ubc), ? – tubulin (Tub-b) and 40S ribosomal protein (WS21) were 
the most stable in Phytophthora parasitica; in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the most stable genes were 
the Mannosyltransferase activity (ALG9), RNA Pol II transcription factor activity (TAF10), RNA Pol 
III transcription factor activity (TFC1) and Ubiquitin-protein ligase activity (UBC6). However, to our 
knowledge, no such studies are published concerning rust fungi.  

 Rust fungi represent a large group of plant pathogens causing diseases on a variety of plants, 
including several important crops such as cereals, legumes and coffee (Kemen et al., 2005). Hemileia 
vastatrix is responsible for coffee leaf rust, a disease that can lead to yield losses of 30% if no control 
measures are applied (Azinheira et al., 2010; Mendgen, 2000; Nunes et al., 2009; Silva et al. 2006; 
Talhinhas et al., 2010). This pathogen establishes a biotrophic interaction with its host and is 
completely dependent of plant living cells to grow and reproduce (Mendgen, 2000; Silva et al. 2006; 
Voegele and Mendgen, 2003). Unlike other rust fungi, H. vastatrix is amenable for in vitro assays only 
in the early stages of its differentiation (corresponding to uredospore germination and appressoria 
formation), while further differentiation must be obtained in planta for experimental purposes 
(Azinheira et al., 2001). In coffee leaves, appressoria formed over stomata differentiate an infection 
hypha which invades the substomatic cavity, from which the fungus grows colonizing the leaf tissues 
inter- and intra-cellularly, feeding from living coffee cells by specialized structures named haustoria. 
The infection cycle is completed with the formation of sporogenic hyphae and the release of 
uredospores, which occurs from 21 days after the infection (Silva et al., 2006). Therefore, the 
proportion of H. vastatrix biomass in planta increases along the infection process. This particularity 
can be a problem when the aim of the study is the proper validation of reference genes. In this way, an 
additional normalization step is necessary in order to successfully validate H. vastatrix reference genes 
for in planta studies. It should be noted that, even though quantification of fungal pathogens is 
frequently carried out by qPCR (Atallah et al., 2007; Mideros et al., 2009), including rust fungi 
(Acevedo et al., 2010; Jackson et al., 2006), the employment of this strategy for the validation of RT-
qPCR fungal reference genes “in host” is still a novelty, as it has been reported very recently 
(Hacquard, Duplessis et al., accepted for publication in Physiological and Molecular Plant Pathology). 

The main focus of this work was selecting potential H. vastatrix reference genes suitable for the 
normalization of RT-qPCR data in the subsequent expression studies. For this, a methodology for 
normalization of H. vastatrix nucleic acid content in planta was established, and eight genes from 
different functional classes were selected for RT-qPCR primer design and validation as references to be 
used in H. vastatrix gene expression studies both in vitro and in planta.

2. Material and Methods 
 

2.1. Fungal and plant material  
 

In vitro growth: Fresh uredospores of the H. vastatrix isolate CIFC 1065 (race II) were spread in sterile 
distilled water in petri dishes to germinate (GU - germinated uredospores sample) or inoculated on 
artificial oil-collodion membranes (Heath and Heath, 1976), to differentiate appressoria (A) (Azinheira 
et al., 2001) and incubated during 24h under darkness at 24ºC.  

In planta growth: Both Caturra and Matari varieties of C. arabica were inoculated with fresh 
uredospores of H. vastatrix isolate CIFC 1065, establishing compatible interactions. The inoculation 
was performed by spreading the uredospores (1 mg/pair of leaves) over the lower surface of young 
coffee leaves. After an incubation period of 24 h in a dark moist chamber, the plants were moved to 
greenhouse conditions. The leaves were collected at seven time-points after inoculation (18h, 24h, 48h, 
72h, 7D, 14D and 21D) in order to obtain in vitro+in planta of H. vastatrix. 

Controls: Control material were ungerminated H. vastatrix uredospores (U), uninoculated young coffee 
leaves, and freeze-dried Lecanicillium sp. (formerly Verticillium sp.; an hyperparasite isolated from H. 
vastatrix uredospores) mycelia obtained upon culture in liquid medium (Potato Dextrose Broth, Difco, 
USA). 

Fungal and plant material were immediately frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C 
until RNA extraction. At each collection time, germination of spores, appressorium formation and 
fungal growth in host tissues were visualized by light microscope and evaluated as previously 
described (Silva et al., 1999). 

 

2.2. Reference genes  
 

Candidate reference genes represent three different functional classes (metabolism related, structure 
related and secretion related), reducing the chance that they may be co-regulated. They were selected 
from the literature, along with a new candidate gene (a predicted H. vastatrix secreted protein), selected 
based on the stability of 454 pyrosequencing analysis between three datasets of H. vastatrix (Talhinhas 
et al., 2010). The genes are: Elongation Factor (EF1-a) (Fang et al., 2006); ?-Tubulin (Tub) (Yan and 
Liou, 2006); Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GADPH) (Fang et al., 2006); Ubiquitin 
(Ubi); Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit III (CytIII) (Bohle et al., 2007); Cytochrome b (Cyt) (Grasso et 
al., 2006); 40 S Ribosomal Protein (40S_R) (Yan and Liou, 2006) and a predicted H. vastatrix Secreted 
Protein (Hv00099). Sequences for these genes in H. vastatrix were obtained either from the 
employment of degenerated PCR primers designed from homologous genes (including cloning using 
the CloneJET PCR cloning kit (MBI Fermentas, Lithuania) in other rusts or from the H. vastatrix 454 
datasets (Table 1).

2.3. RT-qPCR primer design and efficiency test 
 

The primer design and choice of target sequence are essential steps to ensure a specific and efficient 
amplification of the desired products. Primers were designed using PerlPrimer v1.1.17 (Marshall, 2004) 
with melting temperatures of 60°C, lengths of 18-24 bp and GC content of 50–60%. Exon/intron 
boundaries were determined by aligning each cDNA sequence with its corresponding genomic 
sequence. Whenever possible (Table 1), primer were designed in the junction of two different exons, 
thus preventing amplification of a potential DNA contamination. However, this strategy was not 
possible to follow for four genes, where it would generate poor primer quality. Nevertheless, the 
presence of DNA in RNA samples was tested, as described under ‘Total RNA isolation and cDNA 
synthesis.  
Additionally, precautions have to be taken when working with a biotrophic fungus. Since this implies 
that fungal cDNA will be mixed with plant cDNA for the in planta samples, primers have to be specific 
for the fungus and cannot amplify the plant cDNA. Besides this, H. vastatrix can be hyperparasited by 
ascomycete fungi from the genus Lecanicillium, which should neither be amplified.  
To avoid these problems, a blast tool-based strategy was followed (in silico strategy). First, sequences 
of the candidate genes obtained from H. vastatrix transcriptome and Sanger sequencing (using 
degenerated primers), were used to search for homologous sequences in three data bases (NCBI 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/); HarvEST Coffee database (http://harvest.ucr.edu/) and Verticillium 
group database 
(http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/verticillium_dahliae/MultiHome.html)) with BlastN 
and BlastX tools. The homologous sequences obtained with the highest score were used as a template 
for the alignment of primers developed, in order to assess their similarity. Only primers with more than 
five bp differences were accepted. 

The primer efficiency was experimentally tested with the LinRegPCR program developed by Ramakers 
et al. (2003) which uses a linear regression analysis of fluorescence data from the exponential phase of 
PCR amplification to determine amplification efficiency (E). LinRegPCR software utilizes an iterative 
algorithm (considering the number of data points, regression coefficient and slope of the regression 
line) for the selection of the exponential phase in each PCR amplification. We analyzed our 
fluorescence data (details of RT-qPCR experiments bellow) using this software and obtained E values 
for each reaction. Additionally, a combined analysis using an average E value (arithmetical mean of E 
values of all samples) was applied and that value was used in subsequent analyses (Cikos et al., 2007; 
Rutledge and Stewart, 2008).  

 

2.4. Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis 
 

Total RNA was extracted from frozen samples using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany), 
with addition of an in-solution DNase I digestion. Only RNA samples with 260 nm/280 nm wavelength 
ratio between 1.9 and 2.1 and 260 nm/230 nm wavelength ratio greater than 2.0 before and after DNase 
I digestion were used for cDNA synthesis. The quality of RNA samples was also assessed by 
electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels. RNA quantity was determined by means of UV-VIS-



22 

spectrophotometry (Lambda EZ201, Perkin-Elmer, USA). A control PCR was run on extracted RNA 
samples to check the absence of genomic DNA with the cytochrome b primers (Table 1). First-strand 
cDNAs were synthesized from 1 µg of total RNA in 20 µl final volume, using Omniscript RT kit 
(Qiagen) and oligo(dT)18 primer (MBI Fermentas) following the manufacturer’s instructions. For each 
sample, a final volume of 500 µl of cDNA was obtained and stored at -20ºC. 

 
2.5. Real-time Quantitative PCR 
 

The RT-qPCRs were performed using an iQ5 real-time thermalcycler (BioRad, USA), based on 
EvaGreen® Supermix (BioRad). Each 15 µl reaction comprised 6 µl template, 7.5 µl EvaGreen 
Supermix, 0.4 µl of each primer (10 µM) and 0.7 µl of sterile distilled water. The reactions were 
subjected to an initial denaturation step at 95°C during 10 min followed by 45 cycles at 95°C for 15s, 
60°C for 20s and 75ºC 15s. A melting curve analysis was performed at the end of the PCR run over the 
range 60-95°C, increasing the temperature in a stepwise fashion by 0.5°C every 10s. Baseline and 
quantification cycle (Cq) were automatically determined using the iQ5 Optical System Software. Three 
negative controls (1-no template; 2- cDNA of plant; 3- cDNA of Lecanicillium sp.) were run to validate 
the in silico strategy and ensure that only cDNA of H. vastatrix was amplified. Each PCR reaction was 
performed in duplicate and the specificity of the amplicons was checked by melting curve analysis and 
by 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.  

 

2.6. Assessment of expression stability 
 

2.6.1. Normalization of H. vastatrix genomic DNA 
 

For normalizing the expression levels of H. vastatrix reference genes in the in planta samples 
accordingly to fungal biomass, genomic DNA was extracted from the same leaves used for the RNA 
assays, using the DNeasy Plant mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s recommendations 
(namely including a RNase treatment). Genomic DNA concentrations were estimated using the 
Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific, USA), and samples diluted to 10ng/ul. Real-time quantitative PCR 
was performed on these samples at the same conditions previously described, using primers for 
Hv00099. The Cq results were used to normalize the Cq of reference genes using the following 
formula:  

 

Cq normalized = Cq cDNA reference genes -Cq DNA  Hv00099 (1) 

 
2.6.2. Determination of reference gene expression stability 
 

Cq values were obtained (as mentioned under ‘Real-time Quantitative PCR’) for each reference gene 
for all in vitro and in planta samples following the experimental design mentioned in ‘Fungal and plant 
material’ and transformed into relative quantities as compared to ungerminated uredospores using the 



23 

?Cq formula, (where ?Cq = Cq sample – Cq U and E is the efficiency of the primer pair) (Pfaffl, 
2001): 

 Q = E^?Cq  (2) 

 
The stabilities among the samples of the candidate reference genes were evaluated using Q values in 
programs geNorm (Vandesompele et al., 2002), version 3.4 (Visual Basic application tool for Microsoft 
Excel retrieved from http://medgen.ugent.be/~jvdesomp/genorm/) and NormFinder (Andersen et al., 
2004) (a Microsoft Excel-based tool retrieved from www.mdl.dk/publicationsnormfinder) according to 
the author's recommendations.  

 

2.6.2.1. NormFinder 
 
NormFinder assesses the expression stability of a gene by evaluating its expression variation within 
tissues or treatments ("groups" in NormFinder terminology) compared to variation among 
tissues/treatments. The program algorithm implies the estimation of intra- and inter-group variation and 
combines both results in a stability value for each investigated gene. The candidate gene with the 
lowest stability value is the most stable gene within the groups studied. The best combination of two 
genes is also indicated. To select the best reference genes four datasets were run in this program. The 
first one, composed by the in vitro assays has two groups with four samples each. The second 
composed by H. vastatrix-C. arabica (Caturra) assays has two groups each one with six samples. The 
third composed by H. vastatrix-C. arabica (Matari) assays has two groups each one with six samples. 
Finally, the last one composed for the in vitro+ in planta phases, have three groups one with eight 
samples (in vitro assay) and the remaining (in planta assays) with twelve samples each (Andersen et 
al., 2004).  
 

2.6.2.2. GeNorm 
 

GeNorm bases on the simple assumption that expression of two ideal reference genes will always have 
the same ratio among samples regardless of the experimental conditions before the real-time PCR. The 
average expression stability value M for each gene is calculated using the expression data. M is the 
average pairwise variation of a gene compared with each of the other potential reference genes in one 
sample. The average M of all genes together is then calculated by stepwise exclusion of the least stable 
gene until the two most stable genes of the set remain that cannot be ranked any further. GeNorm also 
allows estimating the optimal number of reference genes which should be used for normalization. It 
calculates the normalization factor (NF) based on the geometric mean of the expression of more than 
one reference gene. The more reference genes included in this NF the less possible outliers account. On 
the other hand using too many genes might include unstable reference genes making it less accurate. 
GeNorm calculates the Nfn for the two most stable reference genes based on the geometric mean of the 
expression data and then the Nfn+1 with the next most stable gene. To determine how many genes 
should be used for accurate normalization the pair-wise variation Vn/n+1 was determined out of two 
sequential normalization factors (NFn) and Nfn+1) (Vandesompele et al., 2002).

3. Results and Discussion  
 

3.1. How to successfully validate the reference genes to H. vastatrix 
 

An accurate normalization requires the use of several reference genes whose expression changes 
must be negligible under the investigated conditions. In this study we analyzed the gene expression 
profile of eight candidate genes, described as good reference genes (Bhole et al., 2007; Fang et al., 
2006; Teste et al., 2009; Yan and Liou, 2006). RT-qPCR primers generated amplicons spanning 100-
280 bp (Table 1) with GC content between 45–60% and no secondary structures. PCR efficiency 
ranged from 1.92 to 2.033 and no amplification was obtained for any of the negative controls (no 
template, plant or Lecanicillium sp. cDNA), as shown in Table 1. As ubiquitin was not expressed in all 
samples, it was excluded from our analysis (data not shown). Taken together these results led to the 
validation of our “in silico” primer design strategy and ensured that the Cq value only reflects the 
transcript abundance of H. vastatrix candidate genes. 
For some genes, the Cq values of candidate genes span from 35 to 15 cycles along the infection process 
(Fig. 1). This dramatic variation in Cq values reflects the variations in the amount of fungal RNA 
present in planta at each moment. This is clearly illustrated by similar variations in H. vastatrix DNA 
content in these samples (Fig. 1). Although in some points there are occasional changes often described 
in the reference genes, since their expression is seldom constant throughout the conditions under study 
(Andersen et al., 2004; Pfaffl et al., 2004; Vandesompele et al., 2002). Therefore, it becomes essential 
to use statistical tools like GeNorm and NormFinder to validate the best set of reference genes. 
However, these tools were developed to assess the stability of reference genes when the amount of 
RNA is similar under the conditions of the investigation (Andersen et al., 2004; Vandesompele et al., 
2002). So, in order to implement these programs to the H. vastatrix model, the Cq value obtained at 
each point normalized with DNA was used as an indirect input, instead of the original Cq value (1). It 
should be noted that, this additional step of normalization is only crucial to choose the most stable 
reference genes being unnecessary in the subsequent expression studies in H. vastatrix.

3.2. Selection of the best candidate reference genes for RT-qPCR analyses  
The stability of seven candidate genes was evaluated using GeNorm and NormFinder algorithms using 
several datasets: 1- in vitro phases; 2- in planta phases using C. arabica (Caturra) as a host; 3- in planta 
phases using C. arabica (Matari) as a host; 4- in vitro+in planta. As shown in Fig 2 the results of both 
programs were consistent, with only slight differences in the ranking order, except in the in vitro 
phases. For this dataset, GeNorm identified the ?-Tubulin and Cyt as the most stable combination of 
reference genes, while Normfinder identified Cyt and 40S_Rib as the best two reference genes (Fig 
2.A). The differences in rankings of gene stability using the two algorithms could be due to the fact that 
they use very different methods to assess gene stability (Hu et al., 2009; Walker et al., 2009). GeNorm 
selects genes based on the pairwise variation between genes. The two most stably expressed genes are 
therefore, those that share an expression profile (Vandesompele et al., 2002). In contrast, Normfinder 
uses a model based algorithm that takes into account overall stability as well as the stability of any 
groups that may be present in the sample set (Andersen et al., 2004). However, these differences in 
selection of reference genes may not be significant, since all the candidate genes have a M value below 
the default limit of 1.5, which is the top suitability threshold suggested by GeNorm (Vandesompele et 
al., 2002). In the in planta assays, despite slight differences in the ranking order, both programs select

26 

the same three genes (GADPH, Cyt III and 40S-Ribosomal) as the best reference genes to be used (Fig 
2.B and 2.C). In the fourth dataset, when analyzing in vitro+in planta as a whole, the ranking order of 
reference genes is the same for both programs (Fig 2.D). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

  

The best pair matches with the best three reference genes chosen for the in planta dataset (GADPH and 
40 S_Rib), but the third most stable is different (Cyt III is replaced by the Hv00099). As in the in vitro 
dataset, both genes (Cyt III and Hv00099) have an M value lower than 1.5, suggesting that they may be 
used to normalize the conditions under study, even though Cyt III is more stable in the in planta dataset 
than Hv00099. Thus, we conclude that in most cases the GADPH and 40S_Rib are the most stable 
reference genes while ?-tubulin and EF-1 are the least stable for all datasets.  

 

3.3. Number of reference genes  
 

As Vandesompele et al. (2002) stated regarding the cost-benefit relationship of the normalization 
procedure, there is a trade-off between practical considerations, such as time/costs, and accuracy. 
Obviously an accurate normalization factor should not include rather unstable genes like EF-1 and ?-
Tubulin. On the other hand, if all genes are relatively stable, analyzing more genes than necessary can 
be a waste of resources. In this way, it is essential to find the optimal number of reference genes, taking 
into account a minimal of three genes with subsequent additions of reference genes until NF(n) and 
NF(n+1) have similar values. GeNorm has the ability to make this analysis automatically by calculating 

Fig. 2. Gene expression stability values of the eight potential reference genes. The stability values on the right axis were 
calculated with NormFinder (Andersen et al., 2004) (gray line) and the average expression stability values M (black line) on 
the left axis were calculated with geNorm (Vandesompele et al., 2002) after stepwise exclusion of the least stable gene.

the Pairwise variation values (V(n/n+1)) between each combination of sequential normalization factors 
(NF). Vandesompele and co-workers, recommended a cut-off value at 0.15, below which the inclusion 
of an additional control gene does not result in a significant improvement of the normalization. Yet this 
is not an absolute value and can change according to the data (Vandesompele et al., 2002). As shown in 
Fig 3, the pairwise variation values, for the four datasets, are well above of the recommended cut-off 
value. However this value was established based on a spearman correlation between NF (n) and NF 
(n+1) in which low variation values, correspond to high correlation coefficients (Vandesompele et al., 
2002). Based on the same premise we perform a Spearmen correlation tests and obtained the following 
results: in vitro (V3/4 =0.175391; r = 0.987578; p=0.000); in planta using C. arabica (Caturra) as a 
host (V3/4= 0.316262, r = 0.972028, p=0.000); in planta  using C. arabica (Matari) as a host (V3/4= 
0.20654; r= 0.972028; p=0.000); in vitro+ in planta as a whole (V3/4= 0.308546; r= 0.975652 
p=0.000).  

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These results show that the addition of a fourth reference gene for Normalization Factor does not 
provide relevant information, so we can use only three genes to efficiently normalize the genes of 
interest. However, as stated before the three most stable genes change between the in planta and in 
vitro samples, perhaps due to different condition to which pathogen is exposed. Table 2 summarizes the 
bests set of reference genes selected to each dataset analyzed.  

 

3.4. The choice of the reference genes affects the normalization of a gene of interest 
 

To understand how the choice of the reference genes affects the normalization of a gene of interest, the 
expression of the G?- protein gene was analyzed during the infection process of H. vastatrix. The G?- 
protein plays an important role in the establishment of a biotrophic interaction, since it is involved in 
different signaling pathways (Bölker, 1998; Deising et al., 2000; Lev et al., 1999). Previous studies 
confirmed that this enzyme is involved in appressoria formation and when mutated, some fungi lose 
their pathogenicity (Bölker, 1998; Deising et al., 2000; Lev et al., 1999). For this reason, it becomes 
crucial to study the gene expression profile of this gene during all developmental stages of H. vastatrix. 

Fig. 3. Optimal number of reference genes required for effective normalization. The pairwise variation 
(V(n)/V(n+1)) was analyzed between the normalization factors NF(n) and NF(n+1) by geNorm program to 
determine the optimal number of reference genes required for RT-qPCR data normalization.

Fig 4 presents the relative G?-protein expression levels when normalized with different methods: i) 
Normalization Factor validated for the in planta samples; ii) Normalization Factor validated for the in 
vitro samples; iii) Normalization Factor validated for the in vitro+in planta assays (global 
normalization factor); iv) Worst Normalization factor (EF-1, ?-tubulin); v) a single reference gene as it 
is often used in expression studies (GADPH).

 Ratios of expression values were almost identical using the three best Normalization factors (compare 
blue, purple and pink bars). However, there are some inconsistent values among the 28 samples, 
depending on which normalization factor was employed. For example, at 24 h for most assays, there is 
a difference in 5 fold change between the best normalization factor to the in planta and best 
normalization factor to the in vitro. A similar variation is observed in germinated uredospores. Despite 
these slight differences in the absolute values, the gene expression profile is similar. So, we conclude 
that the use of a stage-specific normalization factor (i.e., specific for in vitro or in planta samples) or a 
global normalization factor (same for all samples) are the best strategies to follow. Nevertheless, 
specific normalization factor provide a more reliable expression profiles with higher costs, while the 
global normalization factor provides a similar results with lower costs. By contrast, when we compare 
any one of the best normalization factors with the worst, there are several differences in gene 
expression profile (compare the black bar with the blue or violet or pink). In fact, at some times after 
the inoculation, the use of this normalization factor led to a wrong biological interpretation. For 
instance, the G?-protein expression is highest at early stages but with the worst normalization factor 
this enzyme was not at all expressed.

 Finally, the expression profile of G?- protein when normalized with GADPH had a similar profile to 
the best normalization factor (compare green with the blue, pink or violet bar), but with absolute values 
significantly higher than those obtained by a proper normalization factor, corroborating the previous 
studies showing that a single reference gene is not enough to normalize the gene of interest.  

 

4. Conclusions 
 

This study provides the first reported assessment of reference genes for use in expression studies of H. 
vastatrix. Normalization is a critical factor in reporting RT-qPCR expression data, providing a 
necessary control for error associated with sample preparation. Normalization using reference genes 
provides a means of controlling this error, provided the gene(s) used are stably expressed across all 
samples under investigation. The study described here tested 8 candidate reference genes across 28 H. 
vastatrix samples representing all developmental phases of this pathogen. We determine different 
Normalization factor for the in planta and in vitro samples that are statistically similar but differ in

some points of gene expression profile of the interest gene. We further developed a method for 
normalization of in planta H. vastatrix samples to account for variations in fungal biomass along the 
infection process. On the other hand, we proved that some reference genes commonly used such as Ef-
1 and ?-Tubulin may give a wrong expression profile and would lead us to make wrong biological 
conclusions. Therefore, it becomes clear the importance of validating reference genes before studying 
the gene of interest. Additionally, we conclude, even in biotrophic organisms, that the correct 
Normalization Factor is enough to determine the correct expression profile of the interest gene(s) and 
no additional normalization steps are required. To summarize, this work provides a set of pertinent 
reference genes that should be used for validation of expression data from RT- qPCR analysis or even 
microarrays experiments in H. vastatrix.

Abstract 
Coffee Leaf Rust, caused by Hemileia vastatrix, is the most important disease of Arabica coffee (Coffea 
arabica), prompting studies aimed at understanding the genetic basis of this pathogen as well as its 
complex interaction with the host. In this work, eleven H. vastatrix genes (CH1, CH2, G?-protein, 
MAP Kinase, AAT1_2, AAT3, INV, HXT1p, MAD1p, Asp_AT and RTP1p) putatively involved in the 
establishment and maintenance of the biotrophy, were identified and their gene expression profile 
characterized. The expression profile of chitin deacetylases (CH1 and CH2) and G?-protein revealed 
that these enzymes are involved in host-pathogen recognition and the establishment of the biotrophy 
during the early stages of infection. However, up regulation of CH1 in late infection stages in H. 
vastatrix is unparalleled in other rusts. The MAP kinase gene was only activated after host invasion and 
not during appressoria formation, unlike its homologues in other fungi, suggesting that this gene could 
be specifically involved in the establishment of the biotrophy. Amino acid transporters (AAT1_2 and 
AAT3), Invertase (INV), Hexose transporter (HXT1p) and Manitol desidrogenase (MAD1p) present 
similar expression profiles to Uromyces fabae, suggesting a fairly conserved process among rust fungi. 
A strong up regulation of a homolog of the U. fabae rust transferred protein 1 (RTP1p) was found in H. 
vastatrix in planta structures, suggesting that it may also be involved in the establishment and 
maintenance of biotrophy. Overall, our results have provided valuable insights at the molecular level to 
the current understanding of the biotrophic interaction between H. vastatrix – C. arabica.

1. Introduction 
Coffee Leaf Rust, caused by Hemileia vastatrix Berk. &amp;amp; Br., is the most important disease of Arabica 
coffee (Coffea arabica), which represents 75% of the world coffee production (ICO, 2009). Currently, 
H. vastatrix occurs frequently with high severity in almost all regions worldwide where coffee is 
grown, leading to serious social and economic problems (Várzea and Marques, 2005). Therefore, 
studies with the purpose of better understand H. vastatrix and its complex interaction with the host 
became crucial and have been conducted in Coffee Rusts Research Center (CIFC/IICT) for more than 
50 years (Várzea and Marques, 2005). However, despite the development of resistant coffee varieties to 
rust, little is known at the molecular level about H. vastatrix  (Silva et al., 2006; Várzea and Marques, 



 

2005). 

H. vastatrix is a biotrophic fungus, living in close contact with its host, and depends on living tissues 
for growth and reproduction. Its growth begins with the host surface recognition, in which the 
uredospores recognize chemical and physical properties of the plant surface and germinate, 
differentiating appressoria over the stomata (Silva et al., 2006). The appressorium forms a penetration 
hypha that grows into the substomatal chamber. At the advancing tip of the penetration hypha two thick 
lateral branches are formed (anchor), and differentiate into a haustorial mother cell that gives rise to a 
haustorium in the stomata subsidiary cells. Further on, the infection process involves heavy tissue 
colonization and haustoria formation in mesophyl cells, culminating in spore releasing in bouquet-
shaped uredinia, formed through the stomata (Rodrigues Jr. et al., 1975; Coutinho et al., 1993; Martins 
and Moraes, 1996; Silva et al., 1999). At the early stages of this process the plant can recognize the 
fungal cell wall components and activate the defense mechanisms. To avoid this recognition, the fungus 
developed several strategies, such as modifying the cell wall surfaces for a compound that cannot be 
recognized by the plant, allowing host invasion and fungal survival (Gueddari et al., 2002). 

Haustoria have been documented as a key in the establishment and maintenance of biotrophy, since 
they are responsible for the nutrient uptake and information exchange between the host and the 
pathogen. For this, they must not be recognized as foreign by the host, in order to avoid defense 
mechanisms, and should be capable of modifying the host metabolism to ensure total access to 
nutrients (Hahn and Mendgen, 2001; Mendgen et al., 2000; Voegele and Mendgen, 2003; Voegele and 
Mendgen, 2010). These functions were proved in 1997 (Hahn et al., 1997), when the first haustorium-
specific cDNA library was developed for Uromyces fabae, allowing the identification of gene 
preferentially expressed in haustoria (PIGs). Since then, a number of genes preferentially or exclusively 
expressed in haustoria have been identified and their encoded products characterized (for revision see  
Ellis et al. 2007; Voegele and Mendgen, 2010). For example, in U. fabae, genes involved in the 
synthesis of vitamins (THI1, THI2 and THI3), sugar uptake (HXT1p, INV, BGL1p, GLK1, MAD1 and 
ARD1p), aminoacid transport (AAT1p, AAT2p and AAT3p) and establishment and maintenance of 
biotrophic lifestyle (RTP1p) were already identified (Voegele and Mendgen, 2010). However, despite 
all efforts, there is still a long road towards a better understanding of the full role of haustoria, even in 
rusts studied in detail as U. fabae. On the other hand it is also crucial to understand the mechanisms 
developed by the rust at the early stages of the infection process, in order to avoid plant recognition and 
defenses. The Chitin Deacetylases, G?- protein and MAP Kinase and others proteins, had been related 
to this process in several pathogenic fungi (Bolker, 1998; Deising et al., 2000; Gueddari et al., 2002; 
Lev et al., 1999). Despite all the progress made to better understand the establishment and maintenance 
of the biotrophic lifestyle, additional studies will be required mainly in H. vastatrix where the 
molecular processes is still poorly investigated. 

Therefore, the aiming of this study was the identification and expression analysis of genes described as 
putatively involved in the establishment and maintenance of the biotrophy along the differentiation and 
infection process of H. vastatrix, using the Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) method, described 
as a golden standard for gene expression analysis (Bustin et al., 2009; Derveaux et al., 2010; Kubista et 
al., 2006; Wong and Medrano, 2005). 

 
2. Material and Methods  
 
2.1. Fungal and plant material 
 



 

In vitro growth: germinated uredospores (GU) and appressoria (Ap) were obtained from fresh 
uredospores of H. vastatrix isolate CIFC 1065 (Race II). For the GU sample, the uredospores were 
spread in petri dishes containing distilled water and incubated for 18h at 24ºC in darkness. For the Ap 
sample, the uredospores were inoculated in artificial oil-collodion membranes (Azinheira et al., 2001), 
sprayed with water and incubated for 24h with 100% humidity at 24ºC. In vivo growth: The Caturra 
and Matari varieties of C. arabica were inoculated with fresh uredospores of H. vastatrix isolate CIFC 
1065 by spreading spores (1 mg per pair of leaves) with a camel hair brush over the lower surface of 
young coffee leaves. Distilled water was then sprayed on to the inoculated surface and the plants were 
kept for 24 h in a dark moist chamber (D’Oliveira, 1954). The plants were then maintained under 
greenhouse conditions. The leaves were collected at different times after inoculation (18h, 24h, 48h, 
72h, 7D, 14D and 21D) in order to represent the progression of infection and host tissue colonization. 
Fungal and plant material were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80ºC.  
 
2.2. Light microscope observations of fresh tissues 
 
For each collection time, the germination of spores, appressorium formation or fungal growth in host 
tissues was evaluated by light microscopy. At 18h the leaf pieces were painted with transparent nail 
polish on the lower surface, which was allowed to dry and subsequently removed, stained and mounted 
in cotton blue lactophenol (Silva et al., 2002). Scoring of the germinated uredospores and appressoria 
formed was performed on a minimum of six microscope fields of 100 uredospores each per experiment. 
For the remaining time-points, cross sections of infected leaf fragments made with a freezing 
microtome (CM1850, Leica) were stained and mounted in cotton blue lactophenol (Silva et al., 1999) 
to evaluate fungal post-penetration stages. Data was recorded from 60 infection sites per experiment. 
These data were presented as the combined values of two experiments because no significant 
differences were found between them. Arcsine-transformed percentages and Student and Fisher Least-
Significance-Differences tests were used for the statistical analysis. 
 
2.3. Strategies applied to the identification of genes of interest 
   
Genes of interest were selected from the literature, mainly form U. fabae, according to their role in the 
biotrophic interaction. In this study we analyzed the expression profile of eleven genes putatively 
involved in the pathogenicity of H. vastatrix to C. arabica, which may be responsible for: i) 
establishment of the biotrophic lifestyle (Chitin deacetylase 1 and 2); ii) signaling pathway (G?- 
protein and MAP Kinase); iii) synthesis of protein (Asp_AT); iv) sugar uptake (HXT1p, MAD1p and 
INV); v) aminoacid transport (AAT1, AAT2 and AAT3); vi) establishment and maintenance of 
biotrophic interaction (RTP1p). As previously stated, none of these genes were characterized in H. 
vastatrix, so the first step was to identify and isolate them. To achieve this, we used two different 
approaches: design of degenerate primers based on homologous genes from other rust fungi followed 
by cloning and Sanger sequencing (data not sohwn); or specific primer designed based on sequences 
from 454 transcriptome pyrosequencing recently obtained for H. vastatrix (Talhinhas et al., 2010). 
 
 
2.4. RT-qPCR primer design and efficiency 
 
Primers were designed using PerlPrimer v1.1.17 (http://perlprimer.sourceforge.net) (Marshall, 2004) 
with melting temperatures of 60°C, primer lengths 18-24 bp and 50–60% GC content (Table 1). The 
generated amplicons spanned 75-360 bp with GC content between 45–60%. Exon/intron boundaries 
were determined by aligning each cDNA sequence with its corresponding genomic sequence. 
Whenever possible, primers were designed in exon-exon junctions, to avoid amplification of potential 



 

DNA contaminations. As H. vastatrix is unable to grow in the absence of the host, RNA extracted from 
the infected leaves is a mix of plant and fungal RNA. This implies that primers have to be specific for 
the fungus and cannot amplify the plant. Additionally, H. vastatrix samples can be infected by 
Lecanicillium spp., an hyperparasite fungus, which also must not be amplified. To avoid these 
problems, an in silico method previously developed (Vieira et al., 2010) was applied and the most 
promising primers were used. 
The primer efficiency (Table 1) was tested with the LinRegPCR program (Ramakers et al., 2003) which 
uses a linear regression analysis of fluorescence data from the exponential phase of PCR amplification 
to determine amplification efficiency (E). We analyzed our fluorescence data for each primer (RT-
qPCR details bellow) and obtained E values for each reaction. The arithmetical mean of E values 
obtained was calculated and the Emean value used in the subsequent analysis (Cikos et al., 2007; 
Ramakers et al., 2003; Rutledge et al., 2008).  
 
2.5. Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis 
 
Total RNA was extracted from frozen samples using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany), 
with addition of an in-solution DNase I digestion. Only RNA samples with 260 nm/280 nm wavelength 
ratio between 1.9 and 2.1 and 260 nm/230 nm wavelength ratio greater than 2.0 before and after DNase 
I digestion were used for cDNA synthesis. The quality of RNA samples was also assessed by 
electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels. RNA quantity was determined by means of UV-VIS-
spectrophotometry (Lambda EZ201, Perkin-Elmer, USA). A control PCR was run on extracted RNA 
samples to check the absence of genomic DNA with the cytochrome b primers (Table 1). First-strand 
cDNAs were synthesized from 1 µg of total RNA in 20 µl final volume, using Omniscript RT kit 
(Qiagen) and oligo(dT)18 primer (MBI Fermentas, Lithuania) following the manufacturer’s 
instructions. For each sample, a final volume of 500 µl of cDNA was obtained and stored at -20ºC.

2.6. RT-qPCR 
 
The RT-qPCR was performed using an iQ5 real-time thermalcycler (BioRad, USA), using EvaGreen 
Supermix (BioRad). Each 15 µl reaction comprised 6 µl template, 7.5 µl EvaGreen Supermix, 0.4 µl of 
each primer (10 µM) and 0.7 µl of sterile distilled water. The reactions were subjected to an initial 
denaturation step at 95°C during 10 min followed by 45 cycles at 95°C for 15s, 60°C for 20s and 75ºC 
15s. A melting curve analysis was performed at the end of the PCR run over the range 60-95°C, 
increasing the temperature in a stepwise fashion by 0.5°C every 10s. Baseline and quantification cycle 
(Cq) were automatically determined using the iQ5 Optical System Software. Three negative controls 
(1-no template; 2- cDNA of plant; 3- cDNA of Lecanicillium spp.) were run to validate the in silico 
method and ensure that only cDNA of H. vastatrix was amplified. Each PCR reaction was performed in 
duplicate and the specificity of the amplicons was checked by melting curve analysis and by 3% 
agarose gel electrophoresis. 
 
2.7. Relative quantification  
 
The Relative quantification of genes of interest was calculated using the following formula (Pfaffl, 
2001):  
 
Fold change = E target

 ?Ct target (Control – Target)/ E NF 
?Ct NF (control- target)  

 
Where E is the average efficiency of the analyzed primer pair, NF is the Normalization factor 
previously described (Vieira et al., 2010) and the control stage represents the resting uredospores. As 
suggested by Vieira et al. (2010), the use of speicifc normalization factors for the in vitro and in planta 
samples, or a global normalization factor (for both in vitro and in planta samples) seem to be the best 
strategies to follow in the H. vastatrix model. In this study, different normalization factors, were used 
for the in vitro and in planta assays, in order to assure the use of the best reference genes from each 
dataset. Thus, for the in vitro samples we use NF in vitro assays (putative Specific Secreted Protein 
(Hv00099); Cytochrome b (Cytb) and 40 S Ribossomal Protein (40S_R) and for the in vivo samples we 
used NF in vitro assays (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GADPH); Cytochrome c 
Oxidase Subunit III (CytIII); 40 S Ribossomal Protein (40S_R)). The mean and standard deviation of 
biological replicates was calculated using the mathematical methods previously described (Willems et 
al., 2008).   
 
3. Results and Discussion  
 
3.1 Fungal development during the infection process 
 
The percentage of germinated uredospores and appressoria was evaluated 18h after the inoculation and 
no significant differences were observed between the two coffee varieties. In Caturra and Matari assays 
respectively, 90% and 86% of the inoculated uredospores had germinated and, from these, 45% and 
50% had successfully differentiated into appressoria. 
For each collection time (24h, 48h, 72h, 7D, 14D, 21D) the fungal growth inside host tissues was 
evaluated by light microscopy (Fig. 1). In both coffee varieties, the majority of appressoria gave rise to 
penetrations, reaching sequencially the stages of penetration hypha, anchor and haustorial mother cell 
(HMC) with haustoria. From 72h after the inoculation, the infection sites in which the fungus reached 
the stage of HMC with haustoria were observed in higher frequency and that value significantly 



 

increased until 14D. At this time, the fungus densely colonized the host mesophyl cells, beyond which 
the entanglement of the intercellular hyphae originated by different infection sites did not allow the 
quantification of fungal growth stages. 
These results suggest that regardless of the analyzed hosts, H. vastatrix seems to have a similar 
development within leaves, allowing, the comparison of the expression profiles obtained for the 
selected genes between the two hosts. 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.3. Quality control of RT-qPCR assays 
 
In this study we analyzed the gene expression profile of eleven candidate genes, previously described 
as putatively involved in the establishment and maintenance of biotrophy. The specificity of the primers

was confirmed using the melting curve analysis and gel electrophoresis (Table 1). When the amount of 
the target gene was above the sensitivity threshold of RT-qPCR, all of the selected primer sets showed 
specificity H. vastatrix. However, in some samples, the target gene was not present in suitable amounts 
to perform our analysis. This could be due to a combination of low expression levels and a low 
proportion of H. vastatrix RNA in the early stages of infection in planta (Vieira et al., 2010). 
 
3.4. Gene expression profiles: establishment of the biotrophy 
 
In order to establish a biotrophic interaction, rusts need to suppress or evade host defense reactions, 
allowing its survival. As previously stated, the growth of H. vastatrix begins with the host surface 
recognition, in which the fungus has to recognize chemical and physical properties of the plant surface 
to begin the host invasion (Silva et al., 2006). On the other hand, the plant can recognize the fungal cell 
wall components and activate its defense mechanisms, preventing fungal growth (Gueddari et al., 
2002). To avert plant recognition, the biotrophic fungus has developed several strategies, some of wich 
will be addressed in this work, being Chitin deacetylases, G? – Protein, and MAP kinase crucial for this 
process. The expression profiles of two Chitin deacetylases (CH1 and CH2; Fig. 2A) showed a peak of 
activation by 24h, reducing thereafter to undetectable levels at 7D in CH2 or between 48h and 7D in 
CH1, returning to high expression levels at 14 and 21D. These results highlight that the conversion of 
chitin to chitosan, as well as the increase of chitin deacetylase activity, only begins after the host 
invasion, coinciding with the pathogen penetration of the plant tissue by 24h (Deising and Siegrist, 
1995; Hahn and Mendgen, 2001; Kafetzopoulos et al., 1993; Mendgen et al., 1996).These strategies of 
avoiding plant recognition and hypha lyses by extracellular plant chitinases enable fungal survival 
(Deising and Siegrist, 1995; Gueddari et al., 2002; Hahn and Mendgen, 2001; Mendgen et al., 1996). 
Moreover, previous studies in U. fabae show an increase in enzyme activity during the penetration 
phases (Deising and Siegrist, 1995; Mendgen et al., 1996) which supports the first peak observed in our 
results. The expression increase in the advanced stages of leaf infection could be related with the onset 
of the production of sporogenic hyphae and new uredospores. However, functional studies will be 
required to better understand this event. 
  



 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

G?–protein showed two peaks of activation, the first during the uredospore germination and the second 
in the early stages of the infection process (Fig. 2B). During the former stage a similar activation peak 
has been observed in Colletotrichum trifolii, although, in this case, after the host invasion the amount 
of transcript decreased to residual levels (Truesdell et al., 2000). In other pathogenic fungi, using 
different mutants of G?–protein, deletions on this enzyme resulted in loss of virulence and growth 
defects, such as incorrect appressoria formation (Bolker, 1998; Deising et al., 2000; Li et al., 2007; Yu, 
2006). Given the obtained expression profile, our results support the pivotal role of this enzyme in the 
regulation of several signaling pathways crucial for a correct appressoria formation and for the 
unfolding of the subsequent infection process. However, the expression increment during the early 
stages of penetration/haustoria formation process suggests that G?-protein may also be involved in the 
establishment of the biotrophy.  

MAP kinase showed a higher gene expression in the early stages of the in planta colonization (Fig. 2B) 
decreasing in late stages. In most of the studied fungi, this enzyme is part of a complex signaling 
pathway regulated by G? protein and has been associated with the appressoria formation and hypha 
differentiation (Bolker, 1998; Deising et al., 2000; Di Pietro et al., 2001; Lev et al., 1999; Li et al., 
2007). However, according to our results, the MAP Kinase under study does not seem to be involved in 
fungal germination or appressoria formation, but its expression increases during the formation of the 
first haustoria, suggesting the overlay with the establishment of the biotrophy in the early stages of 
post-penetration phases. Probably this enzyme is only activated after the host penetration, however 
functional studies are required.  

Taken together, these results suggest that these enzymes are involved in the early stages of fungal 
growth and host-surface recognition system. In this way, the expression profile obtained for the Chitin

deacetylases, G? – protein and MAPK suggest the crucial role of these enzymes in the success of the 
infection either to overcome the host defence reactions or in the establishment of the biotrophic 
lifestyle in H. vastatrix. 
 
3.5. Gene expression profiles: nutrient uptake 
 
As previously stated, the maintenance of a biotrophic interaction is deeply associated with the role of 
haustoria, not only in the nutrient uptake but also in the suppression of host defense responses and/or 
reprogramming the host’s metabolic flow (Voegele and Mendgen, 2010). Several genes, previously 
described in a haustorial cDNA library of U. fabae, play a key role in the nutrient uptake, both in sugar 
metabolism and in amino acid transport (Hahn and Mendgen, 2001; O’Connell and Panstruga, 2006; 
Panstruga, 2003; Voegele, 2006; Voegele and Mendgen, 2003). Currently, three putative amino acid 
transporters (AAT1p, AAT2p and AAT3p) are identified in U fabae with different amioacid specificities 
and expression locations (Hahn et al., 1997; Struck et al., 2002; Struck et al., 2004). However, in a 
cDNA library of H. vastatrix (Talhinhas et al., 2010), only two genes showed homology to those amino 
acids transporters. The first (AAT1_2) is homologous to U. fabae AAT1p and AAT2p and the second 
(AAT3) to AAT3p. Besides the in vitro structures, both amino acid transporters (AAT1_2 and AAT3) 
were only detected in heavily colonized leaf tissues (14D and 21D). The AAT1_2 expression profile 
was similar to U. fabae, while the AAT2p and AAT1p genes are exclusively/preferentially expressed in 
the parasitic phase (haustoria) (Hahn et al., 1997; Struck et al., 2002). However, in U. fabae AAT3p is 
expressed during all growth phases, instead of only on heavily colonized tissues (Struck et al., 2004). It 
seems that the capacity for amino acid uptake in both rusts is fully induced only during biotrophic 
growth, although for H. vastatrix it occurs from 14D on while, for U. fabae occurs during the infection 
process, mainly in the haustoria. Interestingly, in Trichoderma reesei, a gene encoding a putative amino 
acid transporter was found to be induced by mycelial wall fragments of the host fungus Rhizoctonia 
solani (Vasseur et al., 1995). Similar to the both rust, a signal from the host organism might induce 
morphological and physiological events related to parasitic functions. However, the high Cq values 
registered for AAT3 at 14 and 21D suggest that, if similar or lower levels of expression were occurring 
in earlier infection stages, then the lower proportion of fungal RNA in the total RNA extracted in such 
stages would be bellow the sensitivity threshold of RT-qPCR.  
  



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The sugar uptake is also closely associated with the fungal nutrition and seems to be limited to the 
haustoria (Voegele and Mendgen, 2010). Several studies in U. fabae started to provide a more complete 
view of the enzymes and sugars involved in this process (Voegele and Mendgen, 2010). In this study, 
we analyzed the gene expression profile of genes homologous to U. fabae described as pivotal to this 
process: invertase (INV), hexose transporter (HXT1p) and malate dehydrogenase (MAD1p). All these 
enzymes seem to be related with the use of sucrose (most abundant carbohydrate sources produced by 
the plant) as a nutrient source for the pathogen (Hahn and Mendgen, 2001; Mendgen et al., 2000; 
O’Connell and Panstruga, 2006; Panstruga, 2003; Voegele, 2006; Voegele et al., 2001; Voegele and 
Mendgen, 2003; Voegele and Mendgen, 2010). INV was activated during all the growth phases of H. 
vastatrix (Fig. 3B), preferentially at the heavily colonized tissues (14 and 21D). Our expression results 
gave a similar profile to U. fabae, therefore a similar function can be inferred (Voegele et al., 2006). 
This enzyme is responsible not only for the cleavage of sucrose into D-glucose and D-frutose (sugars, 
subsequently transferred into the haustoria), but also for an additional sugar supply to intercellular 

Fig.3. Expression profile (fold change) of genes involved in the aminoacid transport (A), sugar uptake 
(B) and protein synthesis (C) at each collection time compared to resting uredospores.  

 



 

hypha since the fungal invertases present in the apoplast could limit the export of carbohydrates from 
the infected tissue via the phloem, conditioning the plant tissue for a conversion from source to sink 
(Voegele et al., 2006). In this way, the pathogen constantly ensures its nutrient source. HXT1p, 
putatively responsible for the sugar transport (D-glucose and D-frutose) into the haustoria, was only 
detectable in late infection phases (14 and 21D) with relevant activation levels. A similar profile was 
observed in U. fabae, where this gene seems to be almost exclusively expressed in haustoria. The high 
expression levels are also in accordance with the previous studies since this gene represents 1.2% of 
haustorial RNA of U. fabae and is among the highest frequencies found in the haustorium-specific 
cDNA library (Doehlemann et al., 2005; Reifenberger et al., 1997; Voegele et al., 2001). MAD1p was 
detected in all stages, with a steady increase of expression as the infection progresses, reaching the 
highest values at the heavily colonized leaf tissue phases (14 and 21D). This enzyme, converts D-
frutose to manitol (storage compound, normally used by the fungus not only as a nutrient source but 
also as a mean to avoid the oxidative stress resulted from the defense reactions) (Clancy and Coffey, 
1980; Jennings et al., 1998; Voegele et al., 2005). Additionally, it is responsible for the nutrient 
mobilization in germinating uredospores, allowing fungal nutrition before the haustoria formation 
(Voegele et al., 2005). Taken together, these results suggest that the role of these enzymes in nutrient 
uptake has been a fairly conserved process in the biotrophic fungi considered (U. fabae and H. 
vastatrix). Intriguingly, this is in spite of a relatively low homology of these proteins between each of 
these pathogenic species (data not shown). 

The expression profile of Aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) was analyzed due to its relevance in the 
most basic processes of H. vastatrix. For many species, AspAT belongs to the aminotransferase 
subgroup and is involved in the transfer of amino groups (Botton and Dell, 1993; Nakai et al., 1999). In 
H. vastatrix, this enzyme was more expressed in ungerminated and germinated uredospores as 
compared to appressoria and to the in planta phases (Fig 3C), suggesting that this enzyme is not 
necessary for the establishment and the maintenance of the biotrophy. Therefore, future functional 
studies are required to better understand the role of this enzyme in this complex system. 
 
3.5. Gene expression profiles: maintenance of the biotrophy 
 
Rust fungi can suppress host recognition by transferring proteins from haustoria into plant cells. 
RTP1p, from U. fabae, was the first gene detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of host cells (Kemen et 
al., 2005). In H. vastatrix cDNA library, four genes homologous to U. fabae were identified, however 
we have only selected for expression studies the one with highest homology score. As can be seen in 
Fig. 4A, the RTP1p seems to be highly expressed in planta (48h-21D after the inoculation) but not in 
the in vitro phases, which is expected since this gene was detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of host 
cells. RTP1 interferes with plant gene expression, but the molecular basis of this interference remains 
unclear. To understand the exact biochemical function of RTP1p in plant cells, complementary 
structural and molecular insights from the identified functional core of RTP1p are essential. It is 
therefore crucial to determine the 3D structure of RTP1p functional domain. Regardless the validation 
of these specific functions the role of RTP1p in the maintenance of the biotrophy is unquestionable. 
  



 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The expression patterns of genes putatively involved in the establishment and maintenance of the 
biotrophic interaction enhance our comprehension on the genetic basis of H. vastatrix and may pave the 
way for better understanding the complex interaction between H. vastatrix – C. arabica. This will 
contribute for a more informed deployment of resistant varieties in coffee crops, and thus leading to a 
more sustainable agriculture in the countries where the coffee is the major source of resources.

Final considerations  

The present work intended to give the first steps in unraveling the molecular processes triggered in H. 

vastatrix during the host invasion. For this purpose, fungal genes putatively involved in the 

establishment and maintenance of the complex biotrophic interaction between C. arabica – H. vastatrix 

were identified and their gene expression profile characterized. No such studies had been previously 

conducted in H. vastatrix and expression studies by RT-qPCR are also innovative in rust research. 

Moreover, it was developed a method to normalize the proportion of fungal cDNA in the total 

plant+fungus cDNA pool, since it is impossible to dissociate H. vastatrix from the host during the 

biotrophic phase enabling the validation of reference genes for subsequent RT-qPCR studies. The 

employment of this strategy for the validation of RT-qPCR fungal reference genes “in host” stills seems 

to be a novelty. 

Detailed in vitro and in planta studies enabled the selection of specific normalization factors for each of 

these experimental conditions, although a global normalization factor (merging in planta and in vitro 

assays) was as informative. as the specific factors when analyzing the expression profile of the G?-

protein.  Genes involved in signaling, establishment of biotrophy, transport and metabolism were 

identified in H. vastatrix showing homology to genes previously identified in other rust fungi. Further, 

expression revealed that H. vastatrix shares similar patterns of expression with U. fabae for most of 

these genes, although intriguing differences were recorded for a chitin deacetylase, whose up regulation 

in late infection stages in H. vastatrix is unparalleled in other rusts. Also, the MAP kinase gene studied 

seems to be only activated after the host invasion and not during appressoria formation, unlike its 

homologues in other fungi, suggesting that this gene could be specifically involved in the establishment 

of the biotrophy. On the contrary, the genes involved in nutrient uptake studied here revealed fairly 

conserved profiles between U. fabae and H. vastatrix), in spite of a relatively low homology of these 

proteins. A strong up regulation of a homolog of the U. fabae rust transferred protein 1 was found in H. 

vastatrix in planta structures, suggesting that it may also be involved in the establishment and 

maintenance of biotrophy. 

Results obtained in this work suggest that future studies would benefit from the use of techniques 

aiming to enrich samples in fungal material, such as the Laser Capture Microdissection, which may

enable more accurate quantification of low copy transcripts particularly in samples representing the 

early stages of in planta colonization. The results obtained further suggest the usefulness of expanding 

of the RT-qPCR approach to address the expression profiles of other genes, based on the literature 

concerning other rust fungi and in the recent H. vastatrix EST libraries obtained by 454 pyrosequencing 

representing germinated uredospores, appressoria and advanced stages of coffee leaf tissue 

colonization. On the other hand, more detailed studies for selected genes can provide important insights 

into the coffee-rust interaction, namely functional studies using heterologous gene expression and 

histopathological studies focused on immunolocalization of secreted proteins.
