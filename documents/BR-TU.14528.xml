Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a light source on nanohardness, elastic modulus, water sorption and solubility 
of a composite resin. Four curing units were used, three of which had an LED and another had a halogen source. The resin composite 
Z250 (3M ESPE) was used for all tests. For water sorption and solubility, five resin disks were made (15 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick), 
and these were polymerized for 20 seconds at nine different points (1 in the center and 8 around). For nanohardness and elastic modulus 
evaluation, 20 cylinders (5 for each group) were made with a bipartite steel matrix (6.0 mm diameter and 4.0 mm thick). The results of this 
study showed that the group polymerized with the Radii light-curing unit presented less water sorption than other curing units (p &amp;lt;0.05). 
No statistical difference between units was found in nanohardness in 1mm-thick specimens. However, decreased nanohardness was shown 
at higher resin composite depth (p &amp;lt;0.05). A Pearson correlation showed a strong positive relationship between nanohardness and elastic 
modulus for all groups and depths. The light source affects the water sorption, nanohardness and elastic modulus of composite resins.

Keywords: Composite resin, polymerization, light-curing unit, nanohardness, elastic modulus.

Efeito da Fonte de Luz na Nanodureza, Módulo de Elasticidade e Sorção de uma Resina Composta

Resumo: Este estudo visa a avaliar o efeito da fonte de luz na nanodureza, módulo de elasticidade, sorção de água e solubilidade de uma 
resina composta. Quatro unidades fotoativadoras foram utilizadas, três LED e uma halógnena. A resina composta foi utilizada para todos 
os testes. Para sorção de água e solubilidade, cinco discos de resina foram produzidos (15 mm em diâmetro e 1 mm em espessura), e 
foram polimerizados por 20 segundos em nove pontos diferentes (1 no centro e 8 ao redor). Para a avaliação de nanodureza e módulo de 
elasticidade, 20 cilindros (5 para cada grupo) foram confeccionados com uma matriz de aço bipartida (6,0 mm de diâmetro e 4,0 mm de 
espessura). Os resultados do estudo mostraram que o grupo polimerizado com a unidade fotoativadora Radii apresentou menor sorção de 
água que as outras unidades (p &amp;lt;0,05). Nenhuma diferença estatística foi encontrada entre as unidades para nanodureza nos espécimes 
de 1mm de espessura. Entretanto, com um aumento da profundidade uma diminuição da nanodureza foi demonstrada (p &amp;lt;0,05). Uma 
correlação positiva e forte foi demonstrada entre o modulo de elasticidade e a nanodureza para todos os grupos e profundidades. A fonte 
de luz influencia na sorção de água, nanodureza e módulo de elasticidade de resinas compostas.

Introduction

Visible light-cured composite resins are widely used in 
restorative dentistry[1], and quartz-tungsten-halogen (QTH) lamp 
light-curing units have become the most popular method of curing 
dental composites in the clinical setting[2]; however, the light 
intensity of QTH lamps decreases over time due to bulb and filter 
aging[2] and because the heat produced by halogen lamps degrades 
the filter and other components. Currently, high intensity light-
emitting diodes (LED) units are available. These are less energy-
consuming than halogen lamps and need no external cooling[1, 3, 4], 
providing important advantages over the QTH lamps.

Photo-curing dental composites are basically composed of 
organic matrix, inorganic filler, coupling agents and photo initiators. 
The most common initiator, camphorquinone (CQ), is activated by 
light in the wavelength range of 450-470 nm, which corresponds 
to visible blue light. Photoactivation of the resin composite has 
been done with halogen lamps since the 1980s. However, in recent 
years, alternatives to halogen lamp have appeared, including blue 
light-emitting diodes (LEDs)[3]. The peak of absorption of CQ, at 
468 nm, is the same wavelength as the emission of LED units. Light-
emitting diodes are semiconductors that liberate photons when 
electricity passes by them. Hence, LED sources generate less heat 
than conventional sources, because more energy is transformed into 
luminous energy than in light generation by incandescence. Each 
LED has a working lifetime of over 10,000 hours, while halogen 
bulbs have a limited effective lifetime of about 40-100 hours[4].

The degree of conversion of monomer to polymer in the resin 
composite has an important effect on the clinical effectiveness of 
restoration, because proprieties like biocompatibility, dimensional 
stability and wear resistance increase and water sorption and 
solubility decrease when the degree of conversion is enhanced[5]. 
Restoration materials can be dissolved in the oral environment, 
leaching soluble component, discoloring and degrading the 
composite resin bulk[5], and consequently limiting its durability. 
Superficial microhardness tests are an indirect method of 
determining the degree of conversion[6]. Already, nanohardness 
tests allow the evaluation of other proprieties like elastic modulus[7]. 
This propriety is important for evaluating the tension of union tooth/
restoration[8], because a high elastic modulus decreases the flow 
capacity of material, causing interfacial stress[9]. The aim of this 
study is to evaluate a composite polymerized by LED to examine its 
water sorption, solubility, nanohardness and elastic modulus values.

Experimental

a Fischerscope System HV 100. A Berkivich (small three-sided 
pyramid) indenter was pressed into specimens with 250 mN of load 
for 20 seconds, followed by 20 seconds of unloading. Nanohardness 
(MPa) and elastic modulus (GPa) values were obtained using the 
same device and indentation with intervals of 1 mm of depth from 
the top. For each millimeter in depth, 4 indentations were made 
1 mm apart from each one and the values for each depth were 
obtained by taking the arithmetic mean of the 4 indentations of every 
line, representing 1, 2 and 3 mm of depth.

Data were subjected to a two-way ANOVA and Tukey test 
for multiple comparisons at the 0.05 level of significance for 
nanohardness and elastic modulus, as well as a one-way ANOVA 
and Student-Newman-Keuls test for water sorption and solubility. 
A Pearson correlation analysis of the relationship between 
nanohardness and elastic modulus values was performed with a 
significance level of 0.05.

Results

Water sorption and solubility

Water sorption and solubility means and standard deviations 
are shown in Table 2. All specimens are in agreement with ISO 
4049:2000; however, the specimens cured by Radii unit showed 
statistically lower water sorption values (p &amp;lt;0.05) than the 
specimens cured with the others curing units.

Nanohardness

Nanohardness means and standard deviations are shown in 
Figure 1. The depths are compared for each device and among the 
different devices. Groups XL 2500 and L. E. Demetron I showed 
superior nanohardness values for 1 mm of depth than for 2 and 
3 mm, in spite of 3 mm depths not showing statistically significant 
differences. The Elipar Free Light 2 and Radii groups showed no 
statistically significant differences between the depths of 1 and 
2 mm or 2 and 3 mm; however, values of 1 mm were statistically 
superior to those at 3 mm.

Comparing the depth of polymerization among the different 
light curing units, no statistically significant difference was observed 
among the nanohardness values at of 1 mm depth. Nonetheless, the 
Radii and L. E. Demetron I groups obtained statistically higher 
values than did the XL 2500 group at 2 mm. At 3 mm, no significant 
difference was found among the LEDs, even though the Radii group 
showed different values than the XL 2500 group.

Elastic modulus

Elastic modulus means and standard deviations are shown in 
Figure 2. The values were compared among the depths and light-
curing units.

Groups XL 2500, Elipar Free Light 2 and L. E. Demetron 
I presented statistically higher values for 1 mm of depth than for 
2 mm and both, higher than 3 mm. No statistical difference was 
shown in the Radii group between 1 and 2 mm of depth, but both of 
these values were higher than those for 3 mm.

unit was measured with a radiometric device (Demetron for QTH 
and Demetron L.E.D. for LED, Kerr Corp.). The micro hybrid resin 
composite Z250 (3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA), color A3, was used.

Water sorption and solubility

Water sorption and solubility tests were performed in 
compliance with ISO 4049:2000. Five resin disks were made in a 
steel matrix (15 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick). The matrix was 
put directly onto a glass slide and then filled in a single increment. 
An acetate strip was placed on top of the matrix and then covered 
by a glass slide to drain the material. The glass slide was removed 
and the composite was polymerized for 20 seconds at nine different 
points (1 in the center and 8 around). The photopolymerization was 
repeated on the opposite face and then the disks were immediately 
placed in a stove at 37 ± 1 °C. Fifteen minutes after the beginning 
of the polymerization, the disks were removed from the matrix and 
finishing and polishing procedures were performed with sandpaper 
nº 320 and a felt disc.

After polishing, specimens were placed in a desiccator 
containing silica gel at 37 °C for five hours. Twenty-four hours 
later, the specimens were transferred to another desiccator at 22 °C 
for more 2 hours and then repeatedly weighed at 24 hours intervals 
in an analytical balance (Sartorius BP 2100, Goettingen, Germany) 
until a constant mass (m

1
) was obtained (i.e., until the mass loss of 

each specimen was not more than 0.1 mg in any 24 hours period). 
The diameter and thickness of each disk was measured with a 
digital caliper to calculate the volume (V) in mm3. Thereafter, the 
specimens were stored in distilled water at 37 °C for 7 days. Disks 
were weighed daily after being slightly dry until a constant weight 
was obtained (m

2
). The procedures to obtain m

 were repeated to 

obtain m

Nanohardness and elastic modulus

Twenty cylinders (five for each group) were made with a bipartite 
steel matrix (6.0 mm in diameter and 4.0 mm thick). The matrix was 
put directly onto a glass slide and then filled in a single increment. An 
acetate strip was placed on top of the matrix and then covered by a 
glass slide to drain the material. The glass slide was removed and the 
composite was photoactivated for 20 seconds. After polymerization, 
specimens were stored in a dark receptacle for 24 hours at room 
temperature. All the cylinders from the same group were fixed in 
a base of acrylic resin and sectioned under irrigation. The hemi-
cylinders were finished and polished in an automatic polishing 
machine (Struers Abramin, Ballerup, Denmark) with sandpaper nº 
400, 600, 800, 1200 for 2 minutes each; after that specimens were 
polished by a alumina impregnated felt.anohardness and elastic 
modulus tests were performed 24 hours after polymerization, using

Juchem, C. O. et al. - Effect of light sources on nanohardness, elastic modulus and water sorption of a composite resin

Discussion

There are many aspects involved in the polymerization process, 
such as material composition, type and concentration of the photo 
initiator, wavelength and intensity of the light source, and irradiance 
time. Many of the contemporary composite and adhesive systems used 
in dentistry that contain dimethacrylate resins are cured by irradiation 
with visible light. The composition of these photopolymerizable 
materials is generally a mixture of poly-functional methacrylate 
monomers[10]. The tertiary amine/camphorquinone (CQ) complex is 
the most widely used photosensitizer for visible-light-cured dental 
composite resins[1]. The absorption spectra of CQ, ranging from 
450 nm to a maximum of about 490 nm[10], fit perfectly with the 
peak of light emitted by a blue LED. On the other hand, QTH lamps 
emit a large spectrum of radiation (370-515 nm), requiring filters 
to select blue light radiation. Among photoactivator units, the LED 
is an alternative to conventional curing units because it presents 
an enhanced working lifetime, eliminates the need for filters, and 
generates less heat and noise[1].

A high degree of polymerization of the resin composite may lead 
to superior physical and mechanical properties[11]. Microhardness 
values are strongly related to the degree of conversion of the resin 
composite, as previous studies have shown[12]. A high degree 
of polymerization increases the cross-link density of formed 
polymers[2,13]

,
 leading to a composite restoration with enhanced 

mechanical and physical properties less prone to degradation.
High water sorption values and solubility of the post-polymerized 

resin composite can be associated with inadequate polymerization, 
which reduces the material properties and biocompatibility[14]. 
Unreacted components within the resin composite can react with 
solvents in the oral environment (i.e., saliva, water, soft drinks). 
These solvent molecules force polymer chain expansion, decreasing 
the internal forces and leading to polymer degradation[15]. In our 
tests, resin disks cured by the Radii light source showed less water 
sorption than those treated with other curing units (P &amp;lt;0.05), 
indicating an increase in stability of the composite resin restorations. 
Furthermore, increased water sorption of a composite restoration 
could be harmful to the color stability of the restoration, leading to 
early aesthetic failure. The solubility of dental composites reflects 
the amount of unreacted monomers and other low-weight molecules 
such as filler particle compounds and photoinitiators that have been 
leached into the water[14]. The elution of unreacted components 
could result in diffusion through dentinal tubules, causing cytotoxic 
effects on pulp cells[16]. Moreover, restorative procedures with more 
sorptive materials could lead to decreased treatment longevity.

 One of the most frequently used indirect methods for verifying 
the degree of conversion of resin composite polymerization is 
the hardness test[17]. The nano-indentation technique has several 
advantages for hardness determination over conventional micro-
hardness methods and offers a broader range of applications, since 
information on hardness as well as on the elastic modulus of a 
material can be obtained[18]. Analysis of the nanohardness results 
from our trials shows that with a 1 mm depth indentation specimens 
presented no statistical differences among the photo-curing units. 
However, at deeper indentations at resin composite, increased 
nanohardness values were shown (p &amp;lt;0.05) (Figure 1). The use of 
clinical increments with more than 2 or 2.5 mm should be avoided 
to achieve a less degradable polymer.

Elastic modulus has an important role during stress generation 
caused by polymerization shrinkage. Stress generation is a 
parameter for the clinical performance of restorations[19]. Since 
stress is the product of elastic modulus and strain, a high volumetric 
shrinkage combined with a high elastic modulus generates a higher 
stress of polymerization[19], increasing marginal failures[20], color

Juchem, C. O. et al. - Effect of light sources on nanohardness, elastic modulus and water sorption of a composite resin

changes[21,22] and cuspal deflection[23]. Therefore, a restorative 
material should present an elastic modulus similar to dentin 
(19 GPa)[18] and a low shrinkage of polymerization. A high volume 
of organic matrix or inadequate polymerization could promote a 
low elastic modulus, although compromising other properties of 
the material. In this study, a Pearson correlation showed a positive 
relationship between nanohardness and eleastic modulus These 
results show that the source with less light intensity (600 mW.cm–2) 
led to lower elastic modulus values at 2 and 3 mm of depth. This 
can be explained because higher light intensities produce enhanced 
physical and mechanical properties for dental composite resins[24] 
and this difference appears at increased depths.

The luminous intensities were different for each light-curing 
unit tested in this study. The halogen lamp was used as a control 
group for polymerization. Analyzing the results for elastic modulus 
values, it is notable that there was a significant difference between 
the halogen unit (i.e., XL2500 with 600 mW.cm–2) and the other 
curing units at depths of 2 and 3 mm. The increased distance 
between the resin composite and the light source coupled with light 
attenuation caused by reflection, scattering and absorption of light 
reduces the energy absorbed by the resin composite[25]. The degree 
of conversion of composite resins increased with higher levels of 
irradiant energy. Initial free radical generation of dimethacrylate 
monomers is directly related to the irradiance absorbed by the 
composite. The rate of polymerization of resin composites is 
proportional to the square root of absorbed light intensity and 
photo-initiator concentration, as shown elsewhere[26]

,
 and a high rate 

of polymerization could lead to high nanohardness and low water 
sorption and solubility. However, a high rate of polimerization could 
also lead to a high elastic modulus, which could increase restoration 
marginal gap, given that high polymerization shrinkage is related to 
high light intensity[27].

Conclusion

Light source influences the water sorption, nanohardness values 
and elastic modulus of the resin composite restoration.
