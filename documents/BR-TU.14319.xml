Abstract: This study reveals the food composition of pelagic fishes living in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. As 
such more common pelagic species are considered to be top predators, the study proposes to know what constitutes 
their main food. Fish are not commonly found within their stomach contents, but instead, cephalopods are their 
most common food. As can be observed, Teuthida cephalopods compose their principal diet. The stomach contents 
of specimens of Xiphias gladius, Thunnus albacares, T. obesus, T. alalunga, Isurus oxyrinchus and Alopias 
superciliosus caught during July 2007 to June 2009 by using tuna longliners were studied. Teuthida cephalopods 
constitute the main food item for the three tuna species, while X. gladius feeds mainly on Ommastrephidae 
cephalopods. Though the differences among the kinds of cephalopods exist, they constitute the principal resource 
these fish use to live at least in the southern Atlantic Ocean.
Keywords: top predators, diet composition, longline fishery, stomach content analysis.

Resumo: Este estudo descreve a composição da dieta de peixes pelágicos que vivem no Oceano Atlântico 
Sudoeste. Como tais espécies pelágicas são consideradas predadoras de topo, o estudo propõe conhecer o que 
constitui sua principal fonte de alimento. Peixes não são comumente encontrados em seus conteúdos estomacais, 
em vez disso, os cefalópodes são os alimentos mais comuns. Como pode ser observado, cefalópodes Teuthida 
compreendem sua dieta principal. O conteúdo estomacal de espécimes de Xiphias gladius, Thunnus albacares, 
T. obesus, T. alalunga, Isurus oxyrinchus e Alopias superciliosus, capturados durante julho de 2007 a junho de 
2009 prela frota atuneira, foram estudados. Cefalópodes Teuthida constituem o principal item alimentar das três 
espécies de atum, enquanto X. gladius alimenta-se principalmente de cefalópodes Ommastrephidae. Embora as 
diferenças entre os tipos de cafalópodes existam, eles constituem o principal recurso que estes peixes usam para 
viver, pelo menos no Oceano Atlântico Sudoeste.
Palavras-chave: predadores de topo, composição alimentar, pesca de espinhel, análise de conteúdo estomacal.

add more recent information in order to provide condition to perform 
ecological studies related to this pelagic environment.

Materials and Methods

Specimens of X. gladius, T. albacares, T. obesus, T. alalunga, 
I. oxyrynchus and A. superciliosus were collected every month from 
July 2007 to June 2009 by the Santos (SP) tuna longliners. These boats 
range their operations along the southeastern and southern Brazilian 
coast, in an area comprised between 17-35° S and 27-52° W., off the 
continental shelf (Figure 1). According to Arfelli &amp;amp; Amorim (2000), 
such boats work by using the surface longline with light attraction 
to the swordfish (Xiphias gladius), in fisheries, which may last 15 
to 20 days.

1. Data collection

During the process of evisceration, which was performed 
immediately after fish were caught, the stomachs were individually 
deposited in devices with a 10% formalin solution. They were stored 
in a larger recipient containing formalin. The stomach contents were 
washed and seined. After this process, they were stored in individual 
labeled recipients, remaining in a 70% ethanol solution. All the items 
within the stomach contents were identified as to the lowest possible 
identification level, using taxonomic criteria based on Figueiredo &amp;amp; 
Menezes (1980, 2000), Menezes &amp;amp; Figueiredo (1980, 1985), Clarke 
(1986), Nesis (1987), and Figueiredo et al. (2002).

2. Diet analyses

The Prey Relative Importance Index expressed by percentages 
(%IRI) (Equation 1) (Pinkas et al. 1971, Cortés 1997) was utilized to 
reveal the feeding pattern exhibited by the studied specimens. This 
Index is calculated using the percentage number (%N), percentage 
in weight (%W) and by the Occurrence frequency percentage (%O) 
representing the identified items within each predator stomach 
contents (Hyslop 1980). The mass percentages were based on the 
humid masses of prey items found in the stomachs, instead of the 
reconstituted mass method.

Percentage of the Relative Importance Index:

((( ) ) ( ))( )%IRI %N %W %O / %N %W %O 100= + × ? + × ×  (1)

Results

For the 333 analyzed stomachs, 2328 items were registered; 
totalizing 43223 grams of alimentary material (see Table 1). The 
stomach contents revealed the occurrence of 56 prey taxa, including 
23 families of fishes, 3 orders of cephalopods, crustaceans and other 4 
groups, which are shown in detail at Table 1. The highest and lowest 
richness of alimentary taxa were respectively registered to T. alalunga 
(32 taxa) and A. superciliosus (7 taxa).

According to the calculation of the %IRI, the main alimentary 
item for T. albacares, T. obesus and T. alalunga was constituted 
by Teuthida cephalopods. In terms of numerical percentages, the 
most important prey for T. albacares were represented by Teuthida 
mollusks, followed in order by crustaceans and teleosts. A similar 
pattern was shown for T. alalunga to which mollusks are the most 
important food, but fish represent the second one in importance. 
T. obesus, in turn, feeds mainly on fish, followed by cephalopods and 
crustaceans (Table 1). The most important food item to X. gladius 
was also composed by cephalopods, from which the Ommastrephidae 
represented 63.7% of the IRI. Fish were more diversified, but the 
identified species did not reach more than 1% of the IRI. Crustaceans, 

Introduction

One common problem to be faced when studying top sea 
predators is the fact that they are caught in small numbers by scientific 
expeditions. So, one should be aware that statistic significant data 
are hardly available. On the other hand, by comparing distinct 
species living in almost similar open seas, it may be seen as a 
possible approach to distinguish their diet composition when they 
are compared to other available data in the literature. So, the solely 
fact that studies based on results of smaller data numbers can also 
be useful to add them to other available ones and, so, reinforce what 
has been discovered until that moment. There seems to exist no other 
ways to study such kinds of fish, mainly in the southern hemisphere 
where such studies are more incipient. Such studies may permit an 
evaluation about the role each species may play among the other ones, 
competitors or not in a determined system (Schoener 1974) and may 
also help the understanding of their biology and population dynamics 
(Zavala-Camin 1982).

By what is known about the fish species caught in the 
southwestern Atlantic Ocean, the swordfish Xiphias gladius (Linnaeus 
1758), is a cosmopolitan one, whose epi and mesopelagic habit has 
been frequently registered for fish occurring between 45°N and 45°S 
latitudes. So, its distribution comprises tropical and temperate seas, 
which means toleration to a wide temperatures range (Palko et al. 
1981, Nakamura 1985). As it is known to be an opportunistic 
predator, the swordfish uses to show a broad alimentary spectrum, 
feeding on cephalopods, fish and crustaceans (Clarke et al. 1995, 
Figueiredo &amp;amp; Menezes 2000). Its diet composition has been studied 
in the Mediterranean Sea (Bello 1991); Pacific Ocean (Ibañez et al. 
2004, Castillo et al. 2007, Letelier et al. 2009); at the Indic Ocean 
(Potier et al. 2007) and the Atlantic Ocean (Stillwell &amp;amp; Kohler 
1985 Simões &amp;amp; Andrade 2000, Satoh et al. 2004, Chancollon et al. 
2006). For Brazilian waters, besides the studies of Zavala-Camin 
(1981), Mello (1992) and Vaske-Júnior (2000), few other studies 
are registered.

The tuna species, which belong to the Scombridae family, are 
constituted by fish attaining large sizes. There are five species off 
the Brazilian coast. The most common ones are: Thunnus albacares 
(Bonnaterre, 1788) Thunnus obesus (Lowe, 1939) and Thunnus 
alalunga (Bonnaterre, 1788). These three tuna species are considered 
to act as opportunistic predators, whose feeding may be determined 
by local prey availability. Their diet is characteristically diversified, 
mainly composed by fish, cephalopod mollusks and crustaceans. 
Some studies revealed the food composition of the three species in 
Southern Atlantic since 1981 to 2004 (Zavala-Camin 1981, 1982, 
1987, Vaske-Júnior &amp;amp; Castello 1998, Vaske-Júnior 2000, Vaske-
Júnior et al. 2003; Sabatié et al. 2003, Satoh et al. 2004). No more 
studies were registered since then.

The two studied shark species, Isurus oxyrinchus (Rafinesque, 
1810) and Alopias superciliosus (Lowe, 1840) are known to be 
epipelagic and active, which means, they wander during all the time 
and may dive to 500 m (Cervigón 1992, Compagno 2001). Though 
the economic importance played by these shark species, studies 
concerning their feeding habits are rare, as happens to their ecologic 
trophic importance in Brazilian waters, with the exception of the 
Zavala-Camin (1981) and Vaske-Júnior &amp;amp; Rincón-Filho (1998) 
studies.

As the last, so to say, more complete studies referring to diet 
compositions of such species in that region are twenty years old, 
this study purpose is to describe the diet composition of X. gladius, 
T. albacares, T. obesus, T. alalunga, I. oxyrynchus and A. superciliosus 
caught at the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. This should contribute to

however, were represented by decapods and performed 1.3% of the 
IRI.

The food composition of I. oxyrinchus was also dominated by 
cephalopod mollusks and the Teuthida order, mainly composed by 
Ommastrephidae, represented 30.4% of the IRI. The group formed 
by fish species was also more diversified, being dominated by non 
identified teleosts, followed by Scombridae. Alopias superciliosus 
consumed mainly Teuthida cephalopods (49.6% of the IRI), and 
secondarily non identified fish and then Trichiuridae (26.9% and 
21.3%, respectively). Crustaceans were also present within the 
stomach contents, but a clear difference was observed for this 
item’s importance to the feeding composition of these sharks (3.4% 
and 0.6%, respectively). Unusual items were also found within the 
stomach contents. Plastic bags, small box rests and even nylon treads 
were noticed.

Discussion

The relatively broad trophic spectrum presented by X. gladius, 
T. albacares, T. obesus and mainly T. alalunga may corroborate 

the generalist feeding habit such fishes present. Potier et al. (2007) 
emphasize tuna and similar fish predation to be described as an 
opportunistic process, as such fishes live in environments containing 
a relatively low organism’s concentration, as are usually known the 
pelagic ocean regions. Besides the relative homogeneity of such 
environments, pelagic species may present relative ecological defined 
niches, which may minimize competition for resources. This may 
be caused by distinct vertical and seasonal distributions the fishes 
present (Zavala-Camin 1982).

The presence of Teuthida cephalopods within the gastric contents 
of T. albacares, T. obesus and T. alalunga has been a commonly 
known fact in such nature studies. Dragovich (1971), Perrin et al. 
(1973), Pelczarski (1988) and Potier et al. (2007) state that the 
squids Ommastrephidae represent the most important cephalopods 
present in the diet composition of T. albacares. Other groups, such 
as Octopoda are also related as food to this tuna fish, though in a 
relatively small amount. (Dragovich op. cit., Pelczarski op. cit.). 
In a similar way, Ommastrephidae squids are recognized to be 
the most common cephalopod food item for T. obesus (mainly the 
genera Illex and Ommastrephes) (Zavala-Camin 1981, Vaske-Júnior, 

Figure 1. Santos longliners fishing area (adapted from Amorim et al. 1998).

Letelier et al. 2009). Meanwhile, studies made for the Mediterranean 
Sea (Relini et al. 1995), at the northeast Atlantic (Chancollon et al. 
2006) and at the Indic Ocean (Marsac &amp;amp; Potier 2001, Potier et al. 
2007) show a precisely converse pattern, thus classifying the 
swordfish as a primarily ictiophagic predator. The X. gladius diet may 
vary consistently at distinct habitats and seasons, as a consequence of 
the variations of the distinct prey population dynamics (Letelier et al. 
2009).

Pelagic mollusks of the Ommastrephidae family are commonly 
found as food items of X. gladius. Authors like Zavala-Camin (1981), 
Stillwell &amp;amp; Kohler (1985), Simões &amp;amp; Andrade (2000) and Vaske-
Júnior (2000) have registered Illex argentinus and Ommastrephes 
bartramii as the most commonly identified Ommastrephidae species. 
In contrast, the stomach contents of X. gladius caught at the Pacific 
Ocean were mainly composed by the species Dosidicus gigas 
and Todarodes filipovae (Ibañez et al. 2004, Castillo et al. 2007, 
Letelier et al. 2009). Other cephalopods as those who belong to the 
Loliginidae family commonly represent a low importance as food 
to X. gladius, as only in one stomach from 168 analyzed by Stillwell 
&amp;amp; Kohler (1985) contained such kind of squid. Simões &amp;amp; Andrade 
(2000) and Potier et al. (2007) also observed a low occurrence for 
Octopoda individuals as items for the stomach contents of this fish, 
a result which agrees to these study results.

In a similar way, crustaceans are reported to constitute a less 
important item to the fish diet related to these species, and may 
also be considered as an accidental item (Letelier et al. 2009). 
Notwithstanding this idea, decapod crustaceans have also been 
reported by Zavala-Camin (1981) and Chancollon et al. (2006).

Teleost fishes have been represented as the most diverse group, 
and were recognized as being formed by 12 taxa. Species of the 
family Myctophidae, as well as individuals of the genera Synagrops, 
Brama, Cubiceps and Gempylus may corroborate what has been 
registered by Zavala-Camin (1981), Stillwell &amp;amp; Kohler (1985), 
Vaske-Júnior (2000), Chancollon et al. (2006), Potier et al. (2007) 
and Letelier et al. (2009). As the elevated variety of prey species 
indicates, previous studies concerning the food composition of X. 
gladius suggest this species to be an opportunistic and generalist 
feeder. Such presumptions may, however, be taken cautiously. As 
Cortés (1997) states, a predator may be recognized as a specialist by 
choosing its prey by size and even behavior, instead of by species 
representations, mainly as this should be the fact to influence the 
feeding rate.

The organisms identified as the food items of X. gladius may 
corroborate the assumption about the daily vertical displacement 
pattern presented by the individuals of this species, which has 
been described by Carey &amp;amp; Robison (1981) and Takahashi et al. 
(2003). Such a fact could be evaluated in this way by the reason 
that both mesopelagic and epipelagic (Myctophidae in general and 
Ommastrephidae) were commonly found within the fish stomachs, as 
happened to Brama sp., Auxis sp. and Euthynnus alleteratus (Nesis 
1987, Figueiredo et al. 2002). The occurrence of species, which 
usually occupy both strata (epi and mesopelagic), such as Thunnus 
alalunga and Gempylus serpens, reinforce the idea to this kind 
of movement considered to happen to this fish. Another observed 
characteristic for this feeding strategy may be linked to the act of 
chasing for cephalopods or fish, which use to form shoals. This fact 
is thoroughly discussed by the studies of Simões &amp;amp; Andrade (2000), 
Ibañez et al. (2004) and Chancollon et al. (2006), who try to relate 
the fact to a lesser effort in relation to the capture success.

The importance of Teuthida cephalopods to the feeding of 
I. oxyrinchus and A. superciliosus has also been related in the 
literature. Following the data furnished by Vaske-Júnior &amp;amp; Rincón-
Filho (1998), Polo-Silva (2007) and Preti et al. (2008), the squids Illex 

2000). Apparently, the relatively smaller size of the individuals of 
T. alalunga may impose limits to the ingestion of large squids, thus 
justifying the presence of smaller cephalopods, as may be the case 
of some octopods.

The registration of specimens, which belong to Bramidae, 
Monacanthidae and Trichiuridae may reinforce the idea that 
T. albacares frequently feeds near to the water column surface 
(Dragovich &amp;amp; Potthoff 1972, Bard et al. 2002). But, on the other 
hand, some mesopelagic families, such as Chiasmodontidae and 
Gempylidae are also represented as food components for such species 
(Figueiredo &amp;amp; Menezes 2000, Figueiredo et al. 2002). This may mean 
that T. albacares usually dives for incursions to search for food at 
deeper waters. Graham et al. (2007), looking for information about 
ontogenetic changes for feeding, reflecting in a broader amplitude 
of the food components for the species, describes a diet significant 
change of T. albacares, when the individuals` furcal lengths reach 45 
centimeters or more. In addition, following these authors, when the 
individuals surpass this length, they use to acquire and endothermic 
capacity, which permits them to get prey living in colder and deeper 
waters.

The primarily teutophagic food composition shown by T. obesus 
may help to corroborate the results obtained by Zavala-Camin (1981), 
in which cephalopod mollusks comprise approximately 83% of 
the diet composition. So, the definition of a guild based on theutid 
cephalopods may be considered to be a reference to these diverse 
pelagic fishes. But, notwithstanding this, the data disagree from 
those obtained by Vaske-Júnior (2000) and Liming et al. (2005), 
who observe that teleost fishes are predominant to the feeding of 
the species. As the T. obesus diet may be least affected by latitudes 
or distances from the coast, when compared to other tuna species 
(Dagorn et al. 2000, Bertrand et al. 2002), one may infer that such 
divergences for food composition may be mainly due to local prey 
availabilities.

In a similar way, T. alalunga presented a feeding spectrum based 
on cephalopod mollusks, followed by fish and crustaceans. It was 
not possible, however, to establish a pattern to analyze the results 
by basing them on available literature, as there are not coherent data 
related to the food preference of this tuna species. Zavala-Camin 
(1981) in an analysis by examining 741 stomachs, registered a 
predominance for mollusks (59.9%), followed by fish and crustaceans. 
Sabatié et al. (2003) state that crustaceans comprised the most 
important contribution (43%), and then it was followed by fish and 
cephalopods. Satoh et al. (2004), in contrast, suggests a predominantly 
piscivorous diet of T. alalunga, as this item was found to comprise 
more than 65% of the components of the stomach contents for the 
individuals of this species. A fact to be registered may consider 
the existence of an opportunistic behavior of the individuals of the 
species, which may feed on fish or squid shoals.

A substantial contribution of items formed by crustaceans 
to the diets of T. albacares and T. alalunga may be related to a 
morphological design, which consists in a shorter distance between 
their gillrakers, a fact that, as observed by Magnuson &amp;amp; Heitz (1971) 
may permit an ingestion of smaller prey. According to a diagnosis 
made by Zavala-Camin (1978), by comparing the species mentioned 
above, T. obesus presents the lowest number of gillrakers, when 
compared to the other species (varying from to 25 and 30), a fact 
which may explain the low occurrence of crustaceans in the feeding 
habit of the species.

The diet of X. gladius was predominantly composed by 
cephalopod mollusks and secondarily by fish. These results are 
similar to those related to this species at the South Atlantic Ocean 
(Zavala-Camin 1981), at the northwest Atlantic (Stillwell &amp;amp; Kohler 
1985) and to the Pacific Ocean (Ibañez et al. 2004, Castillo et al. 2007,

Biota Neotrop., vol. 13, no. 1

argentinus (Ommastrephidae), Dosidicus gigas (Ommastrephidae), 
Histioteuthis sp. (Histioteuthidae), Loligo sp.(Loliginidae) and 
Gonatus sp. (Gonatidae) are the species most commonly eaten by 
these sharks.

Specimens of Scombridae and Lepidocybium flavobrunneum 
(Gempylidae) appear to be important items (mainly in weight 
measurements) to the diet of I. oxyrinchus. Lepidocybium 
flavobrunneum is a fish species whose individuals may grow to large 
sizes, as are some specimens caught by fishery equipments. According 
to Vaske-Júnior &amp;amp; Rincón-Filho (1998) some specimens, when caught 
by the fishery activities are frequently marked by bite marks caused 
by sharks. This may happen during the process of fishing and to the 
opportunistic behavior of these sharks. The absence of elasmobranchs 
in the diet of I. oxyrinchus helps to corroborate results obtained by 
Maia et al. (2006). As Pikitch et al. (2005) state, this absence may 
be credited to the low densities such sharks and other ones present in 
the oceanic environment, when compared to more complex habitats. 
Other large predators, such as X. gladius, should also be considered as 
potential prey for I. oxyrinchus (Stillwell &amp;amp; Kohler 1982, Maia et al. 
2006), but this fact was not observed in this study.

According to Polo-Silva (2007) and Preti et al. (2008), Alopias 
superciliosus is also a fish feeder and the specimens representing 
the Paralepididae, Merluccidae and Sciaenidae are known to be the 
most representative to this shark`s diet. This information however 
is in disagreement to these present studies. It may be detached that 
such disagreements relating the literature and the present study can 
be due to the reason that many teleost fishes were found in a profound 
digestion state, which may be a common situation when the study 
reveals facts happening within the stomach contents of sharks.

The low incidence of crustaceans for the food composition 
of I. oxyrinchus may reveal a probable incidental ingestion of 
such organisms. Following Maia et al. (2006), a regular ingestion 
of crustaceans may be more related to young individuals of this 
elasmobranch. As seen by the IRI 0.6%, this item may be even less 
important to individuals of A. superciliosus, in a way to corroborate 
data obtained by Preti et al. (2008), who found such prey in only one 
stomach. As a common observation of objects originated by human 
activities and even so, found within the stomach contents of sharks, 
this one may also be an accidental fact such as this one shown by the 
crustaceans (Hazin et al. 1994, Vaske-Júnior &amp;amp; Rincón-Filho 1998).

The ecological feeding details of top predators, such as these 
studied species, are important components for modeling trophic 
relationships and their implications to the pelagic stratum dynamics of 
the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. So, it may be seen as a necessary step 
for more studies involving great predators who live in this region, in 
order to get information to build more multi-specific models, which 
are important to conservation and better use purposes.
