The Dusky grouper, (SLQHSKHOXV? PDUJLQDWXV
(Lowe, 1834) (Serranidae, Epinephelinae),
inhabits rocky bottoms, from shallow waters to
depths of more than 200 meters and lives in caves
of stone blocks (Tortonese, 1986). It is a well-
known teleost fish widely distributed along the
southern coast of Brazil and also throughout the
Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic from the
British Isles to South Africa, Azores, Madeira,
Canaries and Cape Verde (Barreiros, 1995). It is a
proterogynous hermaphrodite. In Europe, it occurs

when individuals are 14-17 years old and about
80-90 cm long (total length)  (Bruslé and Bruslé,
1975, 1976; Bou-Ain, 1984; Chauvet, 1991;
Garcia, 1996; Barreiros, 1998). Besides its
ecological importance, it has an important
economic role for artisanal fisheries along Santa
Catarina’s coast (Medeiros et al. 1997), and is also
an emblematic species for spearfishing and scuba
diving. The aims of this work were to examine the
reproductive biology of the Dusky Grouper and
describe the stages of gonad maturation, maturity
size in females, and provide information on
seasonality of spawning.

Specimens were collected from March 1998
through May 2000, monthly in the Arvoredo
Biological Marine Reserve (Fig. 1), and also along
the coastal islets (Xavier, Campeche and Moleques
do Norte) of Santa Catarina Island. Samples were
collected by spearfishing methods, which are
known to make species selection easier (Derbal
and Kara, 1996; Barreiros and Santos, 1998).

Some specimens were obtained from fish markets
from the long line fleet that operates along
Laguna’s coast, south of Santa Catarina State.
Groupers in tidal pools were collected using
aquarium nets and acetone diluted Chinaldin®, a
potent anaesthetic (Gibson, 1967; 1999), to
correlate their occurrence with the spawning
season.
Specimens were subjected to sex determination,
measured for length to the nearest milimeter (Total

length – TL and Standard length - SL), and
weighed with a precision of 0.01g. After removing
gonads, they were preserved in 10% formaldehyde
for a week, and then transferred to 70% alcohol.
Sections were taken from the proximal, medial and
distal parts of one gonadal lobe, embedded in
paraplastic, sectioned transversely at 5-7 µ m, and
stained with “Harris” hematoxylin and eosin. Each
tissue sample was examined microscopically to
determine reproductive state. Gonad’s
classification was adapted based on the gonad
development criteria of Vazzoler (1996), Lourinho
(1998) and Silveira (1999). Maturity of individual
ovaries was based on the most advanced type of
oocyte present, regardless of their abundance.
Males were classified based on the male
gametogenic stages present in the testis and the
development of the sperm duct. Length at which
50% of the females in the population reached
sexual maturity was estimated by determining the
inflection point of a logistic function fit to the
female maturity and length data.
Gonadosomatic indexes (GSI) were calculated as
GSI=(GW/(TW-GW))x100, where GW= gonad
weight (g) and TW=total fish weight (g).
Hepatosomatic indexes (HIS) were calculated as
HIS=(LW/TW)x100, where LW= liver weight (g)
and TW= total fish weight (g).

A total of 139 specimens was collected. Samples
of gonads from 109 fishes ranging from 197 to
1002 mm (TL) were collected (Fig. 2). Males
varied from 800 to 1002 mm (mean=960 mm,
SD=75.4, n=5) and were significantly longer than
females, which ranged from 175 to 795 mm
(mean=423.5 mm, SD=130.0, n=104) (p&lt;0.01).
Lengths were divided in classes of 50 mm
(considering the higher limit), and a maximum of
23 fishes for the 400 mm class was observed.
Juveniles from tidal pools varied from 22 to 146
mm (mean=39 mm, SD=35.2, n=107).
The length/weight relationship obtained for the
grouped data of sexed groupers and juveniles from
tidal pool was TW=9x10-6xTL3.1149 (r2=0.9985
n=246) (Fig. 3). Although the value of the
exponent “b” (3.1149) of the relation above was
similar to the ones found by Kara and Derbal
(1995) and Chauvet (1981,1988), a value of
b=2.598 (probably influenced by the small sample
size, n=22) was obtained by Bouchereau et al?
(1999) for the groupers in the Natural Marine
Reserve of Lavezzi Islands.

First maturation curve presented a characteristic
shape typical of species that reached higher sizes,
higher longevity and slower growth rate, as was
the case of (??PDUJLQDWXV. Its maturation process
occured along a vast amplitude of lengths (350 to
600 mm). The estimated length at which 50% of
the females in the population reached sexual
maturity was 470 mm (Fig. 4), which corresponded
to a grouper weighing approximately 2 kg (Fig. 3).
The value of L50=470 mm was within the
amplitude found for Tunisian groupers by Chauvet

(1988), where the population studied reached
sexual maturity between 450 and 550 mm total
length, with an average age of 5 years.
Size of sexual inversion was not calculated due to
an insufficient sample size. Tunisian and Azorean
groupers had an inversion size between 800 and 900
mm (Chauvet, 1988; Barreiros, 1998). In our
samples the highest female total length was 795 mm
total length and the smallest male was 800 mm.

Microscopic gonad stages are presented in Table 1.
Some oocytes stages are presented in Fig. 5 and 6.
Close attention should be given to male
classification, not only because its finer
classification was difficult and subjective, but also
because of our low sample size.
For a better resolution of the indexes results, data
were grouped in four seasons (Table 2). The
number of sexed groupers, mean TL and standard
deviation were respectively: in summer (n=53,
mean TL=423.6, SD=127.9), autumn (n=43, mean
TL=451.5, SD=149.5), winter (n=4, mean
TL=740.5, SD=262.9) and spring: (n=9, mean
TL=617.7, SD=259.2). Median gonadosomatic
index (GSI) showed the values in summer,
decreasing in autumn and getting higher along
winter and spring highest. The hepatosomatic index
(HSI) plotted showed an inverse pattern of these
values in comparison to GSI indexes (Fig. 7).
This behavior suggested that (?? PDUJLQDWXV
matured in spring and spawned in early summer,
with a peak in December. It showed an evident
liver recovery (high HSI level) in autumn. Data on
juvenile grouper in intertidal areas were found to
occur in tidepools from December up to March
(Bertoncini et al?? 1999), with TL’s ranging from
20 to 30 mm, peaking in February and March.
Azevedo et al. (1995) suggested that these
intertidal pools have an important role as nursery
areas for (?? PDUJLQDWXV. Heemstra AND Randall
(1993) reported that (SLQHSKHOXV?VHSWHPIDVFLDWXV,
a?species reaching sizes similar to (??PDUJLQDWXV,
reached 30.8 mm in 60 days after spawning in
laboratory conditions. These data reinforced the
results showed by the indexes presented above.
Hermaphrodite fishes present age and sexual
inversion rates, which are characteristic of a
specific geographic region. Chauvet (1988)
studying (?? PDUJLQDWXV growth in the Tunisian
coast stands out the necessity in developing quali-
quantitative studies gathering grouper stocks from
different geographic origins. The presence of big
females in a population suggested that not all the
females inverted to males. Such big females were
not observed in our samples in Santa Catarina, but
Barreiros [unpublished results] reported that in
2000, big (??PDUJLQDWXV females were caught in
the Azores, weighing over 18 kg (approximately
950 mm).
The reproductive characteristics of other three
hermaphrodite grouper species studied by
Coleman et al? (1996), and Sluka AND Sullivan,
(1988) showed that these characteristics may

affect stocks sustainability. Nowadays it is known
that some protogynous stocks may be far more
vulnerable to fishing than are comparable
gonochoristic stocks (Schaaf and Huntsman, 1994;
Musick et al., 2001; Coleman et al., 2001).
Many reef fishes are known to aggregate in large
numbers at specific times and places to reproduce.
Grouper stocks, as in other serranids, were
typically the first reef fish stocks to collapse in
response to increasing fishing pressure (Johannes,
1998). In the case of groupers, spawning
aggregations have been completely obliterated by
overfishing at a number of locations in the Atlantic
and the Pacific oceans (Johannes et al?? 1999). (?
PDUJLQDWXV aggregation sites are known at a few
places, such as the Medes Islands Marine Reserve,
Spain (Zabala  et al., 1997a, 1997b), off
Lampedusa Island, Mediterranean Sea (Marino et
al., 2001), and the National Park of Port-Cros,
France (Chauvet AND Francour, 1991).
In Brazil, these aggregation sites are supposed to
exist based on information obtained from
fishermen, in their reports of large catches, up to
400 kg [pers. com.] in a few days of diving in the
same area. Little information is known about such
important sites in Santa Catarina. Diving centers,
operating in the Arvoredo Biological Marine
Reserve along the year reported a higher
abundance of (??PDUJLQDWXV in a single summer
week at a diving point north of Deserta Island.
Efforts should focus to discover the aggregation
sites at Santa Catarina’s coast, once mature,
juveniles and post-larvae of (?? PDUJLQDWXV are
found in the studied area. In the Mediterranean
area, specific fishery statistics for this species are
not available (Marino et al., 2001), and (?
PDUJLQDWXV is believed to be overexploited in most
Mediterranean areas (Bruslé and Bruslé, 1976;
Chauvet, 1991; Zabala et al.,1997b). To avoid
future stock depletion of this important resource in
Santa Catarina’s waters, the detection of
aggregation sites is vital for the development of a
management plan considering spawning
aggregations (which should be taken into
consideration when delineating marine protected
areas) and also groupers minimum capture-size.
Alternatively, establishing fishing closures during
the brief annual spawning aggregation periods
might be an effective approach to protect this
valuable resource.
