To meet the challenge of sustainability 
scientists must transfer their knowledge 
outside the scientific community. This is not 
only desirable but also a social responsibility 
of scientists (UNESCO, 2000).

Abstract 
Achieving coastal sustainability requires a comprehensive knowledge of the coastal 

environment. In this context, scientific knowledge plays a major role in understanding 
coastal processes at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, as well as in the 
integration of different types of knowledge. However, scientific knowledge as not been 
used in full for the development of science-based coastal policies and management 
strategies, and ineffective scientific knowledge transfer arises as a major obstacle in 
knowledge integration. Several reasons for ineffective knowledge transfer have been 
suggested in the literature, most of which related with communication gaps.  

The main objective of the present work is to find means to improve the transfer of 
coastal scientific knowledge fostering its incorporation into coastal management. This 
study was based upon a conceptual approach supported in a comprehensive literature 
review and grounded in theoretical developments. Results benefits from the author’s 
experience gathered from different projects developed under the framework of the 
present study. 

The first step to achieve the main objective of this work was to identify who are the 
key coastal actors and understanding the way they interact: this is of paramount 
importance in a knowledge-transferring framework as they are the audience that 
scientists aim to reach. Beside scientists, two other key coastal actors are policy-makers 
and managers, and society. Policy-makers and managers are responsible for the regulation 
of the coastal zone uses by establishing and implementing the policy framework for the 
coast. Society arises also as a key coastal actor as people benefit from the services 
provided by the coastal environment. Although society is frequently regarded as a passive 
intervenient, the fact is that the role of society in the definition of coastal strategies is 
increasing. Key coastal actors, their roles and links are schematized in The Coastal 
Knowledge Triangle.  

The second step was to identify the challenges faced by scientists in fostering 
scientific knowledge. Two major challenges were identified: the need to foster 
engagement among coastal actors, and the need to properly frame the message to be 
delivered. Engagement is grounded on empathy and goes beyond simple awareness of 
the problem. Four key enablers for successfully building engagement were identified: 
willingness, trust, competence and commitment. Framing the message helps turning 
scientific data into meaningful information for the target audience, and implies choosing 
the more adequate language (i.e., the manner in which scientific knowledge is traduced) 
and channels of communication (i.e., the manner in which the message is sent) according 
to the audience’s specificities. Interpersonal communication, video and websites are 
examples of widely used channels in science communication. The most adequate 
languages to traduce scientific knowledge are discourse (i.e., conceptual generalization of 
conversation), images (including photographs and graphical representations) and 
indicators.  



Abstract 

 - 14 -  

This study suggests that indicators the most efficient way to transmit inherently 
complex information in a simplified and applicable form, a conclusion in line with several 
international organizations. Considering their relevance, a common framework for the 
establishment of coastal geoindicators for sandy coast environments was developed in 
the scope of the present work.  

The third step was to identify mechanisms that scientists can adopt to connect with 
their audience. Each mechanism accounts for the audience specificities and conveys the 
message in a different way leading to different types and quantity of feedback. If 
adequately used, mechanisms improve the transfer of scientific knowledge by fostering 
engagement, minimizing framing effort and optimizing audiences’ feedback. The most 
widely known (and adopted) mechanism to transfer scientific knowledge is outreach (as 
formal education is not encompassed in the scope of this work). However, scientists’ 
must be aware that other mechanisms are available: crowdsourcing, managers-oriented 
tools and co-production. These mechanisms although in earlier stages of development 
are promising alternatives and should be considered as major opportunities to foster 
knowledge transfer. In the scope of the present work, a conceptual model was developed 
to help scientists in selecting the most adequate mechanism to convey the coastal 
message. In this selection, scientists must weigh the level of engagement of the audience 
and account for the feedback raised by each mechanism: outreach leads to coastal 
awareness; crowdsourcing to data generation; management-oriented tools generate 
information, and co-production boosts knowledge. The application of each mechanism 
and related feedback is thoroughly discussed in this work grounded in real-world 
applications. The adequate use of these mechanisms will lead to a knowledge-based 
society and will increase the participation of key coastal actors in decision-making. 
Therefore, scientists should actively pursue the goal of transferring their knowledge 
outside of the scientific community, by adopting the proper mechanisms to connect with 
their audience, developing their framing skills and acknowledging the benefits of 
engaging with others. Not only this is a social responsibility of scientists but, ultimately, it 
will also benefit the value of research endeavors towards [coastal] sustainability.

Resumo 
A sustentabilidade da zona costeira só é possível através da integração do 

conhecimento (lato sensu) na definição de estratégias de planeamento e gestão. Neste 
contexto, o conhecimento científico apresenta uma importância fundamental na 
compreensão dos processos que condicionam a evolução costeira, mas também na 
integração de outras fontes de conhecimento (não científico) associados à zona costeira. 
No entanto, presentemente, a integração do conhecimento científico na gestão da zona 
costeira é geralmente efetuada de forma não-sistemática e, na maioria dos casos, em 
contextos reativos. Esta situação deve-se essencialmente a constrangimentos associados à 
transferência do conhecimento científico entre as comunidades científicas e não 
científicas, relacionados com limitações na comunicação entre as partes.      

O principal objectivo deste trabalho é definir estratégias que potenciem a transferência 
do conhecimento científico, entre as comunidades científica e não científica, 
promovendo a sua integração no planeamento e gestão da zona costeira. Este trabalho é 
baseado numa abordagem conceptual suportada em vasta pesquisa bibliográfica e no 
desenvolvimento de um conjunto de projetos que foram desenvolvidos e implementados 
no âmbito deste estudo. 

A primeira fase deste trabalho consistiu na identificação dos principais atores da zona 
costeira. Para além dos cientistas, responsáveis pela geração do conhecimento científico, 
foram identificados os decisores políticos e gestores, e a sociedade em geral: os decisores 
políticos e gestores enquanto responsáveis pela regulação da zona costeira através do 
estabelecimento e implementação dos instrumentos legais de ordenamento da orla 
costeira; a sociedade uma vez que beneficia, direta e indiretamente, dos serviços 
fornecidos pela zona costeira e pelo ao seu papel cada vez mais interventivo e de maior 
relevância na tomada de decisão. De forma a conceptualizar as relações entre os 
principais atores da zona costeira foi desenvolvido o “Triângulo do Conhecimento 
Costeiro” (The Coastal Knowledge Triangle). 

A segunda fase constituiu na identificação dos desafios que os cientistas encontram na 
transferência do conhecimento científico. Neste contexto foram identificadas duas ações 
que podem atuar como catalisadores da transferência do conhecimento: promover o 
engajamento (engagement) entre os principais atores e enquadrar (framing) a “mensagem” 
num formato que considere as especificidades da audiência. O engajamento implica o 
envolvimento dos cientistas não só na identificação do problema mas também na sua 
resolução e beneficia da existência de (maior) empatia entre as diferentes partes 
envolvidas. O enquadramento da mensagem implica a tradução e disponibilização do 
conhecimento científico em dados e informação relevante para os outros atores 
(receptores da mensagem) através da utilização de uma linguagem (forma como a 
informação é traduzida) e de canais de comunicação adequados. No âmbito do presente 
trabalho, foram identificadas com linguagens mais adequadas para a transferência do 
conhecimento científico, o discurso, as imagens (incluindo fotografias e gráficos) e os 
indicadores.  



Resumo 

 - 16 -  

Os indicadores foram considerados como a linguagem mais adequada para transmitir 
informação inerentemente complexa de uma forma simples e aplicável. Esta constatação 
está de acordo com as orientações de  várias organizações internacionais de reconhecido 
mérito. Neste sentido, no âmbito do presente trabalho foi desenvolvido um quadro de 
referência para o estabelecimento e reporte de geoindicadores orientados para a descrição 
do estado e evolução de litorais arenosos. 

 Por último foram identificados diferentes mecanismos para os cientistas se 
relacionarem com a audiência e que têm como objetivo potenciar a transferência do 
conhecimento. Cada um dos mecanismos pressupõe o estabelecimento de diferentes 
tipos de ligação com a audiência gerando, por sua vez, diferentes tipos de resposta. 
Adicionalmente, se devidamente utilizados, estes mecanismos não só promovem a 
transferência do conhecimento mas também promovem o engajamento, minimizam os 
esforços no enquadramento da mensagem e otimizam a resposta da audiência. O mais 
conhecido, e utilizado, mecanismo de transferência do conhecimento científico é a 
divulgação científica (outreach). No entanto, existem outras formas para transferir 
conhecimento científico: a aquisição coletiva de dados (crowdsourcing), ferramentas de 
apoio à gestão e co-produção. Estes mecanismos, apesar de se encontrarem numa fase 
mais inicial de desenvolvimento e aplicação, constituem alternativas de elevado potencial 
na transferência do conhecimento. Neste estudo, todos estes mecanismos são 
apresentados e discutidos com base em projetos concretos desenvolvidos no âmbito 
deste trabalho. 

Para orientar os cientistas na seleção do mecanismo mais adequado para transferirem 
a sua mensagem foi desenvolvido um modelo conceptual. Nesta seleção, os cientistas 
devem considerar o nível de engajamento entre os atores e o tipo de resposta que os 
cientistas desejam gerar na audiência: enquanto a divulgação científica promove a literacia 
e a sensibilização, a aquisição coletiva de dados promove a geração de dados, as 
ferramentas orientadas para o apoio à gestão promovem a geração de informação e a co-
produção a geração de (novo) conhecimento. Verificou-se que a adoção dos diferentes os 
mecanismos tem um vasto potencial na promoção uma sociedade baseada no 
conhecimento e potencia a participação dos diferentes atores costeiros no processo de 
decisão. Neste sentido, os cientistas devem promover ativamente a transferência do 
conhecimento científico para além das fronteiras da comunidade científica. É ainda 
fundamental que os cientistas desenvolvam as suas competências no enquadramento da 
mensagem e reconheçam os benefícios de interagir com os outros atores. Esta atitude é 
uma responsabilidade social dos cientistas que, em última instância, irá valorizar os seus 
esforços na geração do conhecimento científico e contribuir para a sustentabilidade da 
zona costeira.

1. Introduction 

1.1 Motivation 

Moving towards sustainable development implies the incorporation of scientific 
knowledge in the management framework. The importance of scientific knowledge is 
acknowledged by major international organizations and highlighted in strategic 
documents such as the Agenda 21 (UN, 1992), and the Declaration on Science and the 
Use of Scientific Knowledge (UNESCO, 2000). Here, scientific knowledge integration is 
considered as being indispensable aiming at sustainability and, beyond desirable, it is 
stated as a social responsibility of scientists.  

The integration of scientific knowledge has been growing in importance in coastal 
management as the coast is one of the most dynamic and vulnerable Earth’s 
environments highly susceptible to human demands and to global climate change (e.g., 
Hinkel et al., 2015; IPCC, 2014; UNESCO, 2007; Agardy et al., 2005).  However, only a 
small part of scientific endeavor has been effectively used in the development of coastal 
management strategies (e.g., Nursey-Bray et al., 2014; van Koningsveld et al., 2005). In the 
past, the inability to recognize coastal change has led to serious errors in terms of 
management practice (e.g., Douglass, 2002). These errors are particularly obvious in 
highly populated coasts, were unwisely occupation collides with the inherent dynamics of 
the coast (e.g., MacFadden, 2007; Hsu et al., 1999). Nowadays, the rate of population 
growth and urbanization in coastal areas is still increasing and this trend is expected to 
continue into the near future (e.g., UNESCO, 2007; Brown et al., 2008). Neumann et al. 
(2015) estimate that the number of people living in low-lying coastal areas will grow 
between 2000 and 2060 from 625 million in 2000 up to 1.4 billion people in 2060. This 
increase will most likely put additional pressure on the coast and might thus endanger 
sustainability (Sekovski et al., 2012). Adding to this scenario, the expected climate change-
related effects may increase the intensity and frequency of risk-prone events throughout 
the 21st century and beyond (Hinkel et al., 2015; IPCC, 2014). Attaining coastal 
sustainability has been a difficult goal in the past and, given that, at present, this goal 
should consider cumulative impacts of climate change an even bigger challenge lays 
ahead. Nevertheless, while the importance of scientific knowledge integration is widely 
recognized, significant gaps still remain in the effective incorporation of science outputs 
in the management agenda.

1.2 Gaps in scientific knowledge transfer  
[This subchapter is based on: Carapuço, M.M., Taborda, R., Andrade, C., de Jonge, V.N. 2016a. Coping with coastal 
change: from scientific knowledge to implementation (Submitted)] 

Several reasons for ineffective scientific knowledge transfer have been suggested in 
the literature. According to Anderson (1992) the problem mainly depends on scientists 
often allowing for much more interest, time, and effort to the production of new 
knowledge than to the dissemination of their research results. For van Koningsveld et al. 
(2005), scientific knowledge transfer has been hindered due to the complexity of the data 
available. This translates in the inherent difficulty in applying straightforwardly the 
research findings into the coastal management process. According to de Jonge (2007) 
many scientists fail to translate their data-rich research output into information that is 
understandable, useful and appealing to managers. Stone (2002) pointed out the lack of 
dialogue as the cause for the inadequate or insufficient use made of research findings. 
Carapuço et al. (2014a) identified as the major gap the inefficiency of the channels used 
for scientific data dissemination, which are not adequate to reach coastal managers. Jones 
et al. (2008) and Diedrich et al. (2010) noted that research is often conducted disregarding 
the needs of decision-makers, and this limits the responsiveness of research to current 
policy concerns. However, these authors also pointed lack of political will, limited 
researcher credibility in the eyes of policy-makers, and decisions being taken based on 
political premises rather than science, as reasons hindering the effectiveness of scientific 
knowledge transfer. In fact, several authors claim that the reasons for gaps in scientific 
knowledge transfer exclusively fall under the responsibility of policy-makers and 
managers. The resistance to adopt new knowledge, the motivation to seek and use 
information, and their often-limited competencies and skills in “translating” scientific 
knowledge are some of the main handicaps reported in the literature (Becheikh et al., 
2010; Kirst, 2010; de Jonge, 2007; Hemsley-Brown and Oplatka, 2005). For Nielson 
(2001) the problem lies “somewhere in the middle” and the non-use of research has been 
largely explained as an outcome of the cultural gap between scientists and non- scientists 
in relation to their values, jargon, time-frames, reward systems and professional 
affiliations to such an extent that they live in separate worlds.  

The central issue is that, regardless on which side relies the responsibility of barriers in 
scientific knowledge transfer, communication gaps arise as the major obstacle to 
scientific knowledge transfer. Furthermore, it should be noted that scientific literature 
devaluates the role of society in scientific knowledge transfer (Bonne et al., 2014). Thus, 
the amplitude of communication gaps in knowledge transfer is probably wider than 
expectable. The consequence is that this communication gap must be approached from 
both the scientists’ and non-scientists’ “sides”. Scientists should acknowledge that their 
role does not end when scientific knowledge is developed and that they also have a role 
in its successful delivery to non-scientists. In this sense, scientists should take the first 
step in the direction towards knowledge transfer and should actively pursue this 
objective.

1.3 Objective of the work 

The objective of the present work is to find means to improve the transfer of coastal 
scientific knowledge. This work aims to be a contribution in strengthening the links 
among scientists and other key coastal actors, a vital step towards sustainability.  

This objective lead to the following research questions: 

• Who are the key coastal actors and what are their roles? 
• What are the challenges faced by scientists in knowledge transfer?  
• What strategies can help scientists to connect with their audience and improve 

knowledge transfer? 

This study was based upon a conceptual approach supported by a comprehensive 
literature review and critical thinking. Notwithstanding its theoretical approach this work 
was developed under the premise that to be useful to scientists a tangible result should be 
put forward. To achieve this objective, a conceptual model presenting guidelines for 
scientists to improve the transfer of scientific knowledge was developed. This model 
benefited from the author’s experience gathered from different projects developed under 
the scope of the present study supported by real-world case studies undertaken and 
tested in the scope of this thesis. 

1.4 Outline of the thesis 

The thesis is divided into seven chapters, with a structure consistent with the research 
questions formulated above. 

Chapter 1 presents the motivation and defines the objective of the work.  

Chapter 2 focuses on key coastal actors, their roles and links.  

Chapter 3 addresses the challenges that arise in scientific knowledge transfer. In this 
chapter, the identification of the existing gaps in coastal knowledge transfer is supported 
by results from a worldwide survey targeting coastal scientists, policy-makers and 
managers. Based upon these results, conditions for fostering scientific knowledge 
transfer are put forward. 

Chapter 4 focuses on coastal indicators as one of the most adequate languages to 
improve the transfer of coastal scientific knowledge. A common framework for the 
establishment of coastal geoindicators for sandy coast environments developed in the 
scope of this work is presented. 

Chapter 5 presents mechanisms that can be adopted to help scientists to connect with 
their audience. Each mechanism conveys the coastal message in a different way and 
accounts for the audience specificities. Real-world applications of the different 
mechanisms are presented and thoroughly discussed. 



Introduction 

 - 21 -  

Chapter 6 presents a conceptual model to guide scientists in the selection of the most 
effective mechanism to convey their science-based message. This selection will depend 
both on audience’s engagement and aspired feedback. 

Chapter 7 presents the conclusions of the work and provides an outlook for moving 
forward in scientific knowledge transfer.  

This thesis includes approaches and results that have been published in encyclopedias, 
books and peer-reviewed scientific journals. In order to assure fluency to the thesis small 
changes were introduced, when appropriate, to the original contents of those 
contributions. Specific reference to those publications is made in each chapter or 
subchapter.

2. Coastal actors, their roles and links 
[This subchapter is based on: Carapuço, M.M., Taborda, R., Andrade, C., de Jonge, V.N. 2016a. Coping with coastal 
change: from scientific knowledge to implementation (Submitted)] 

The identification of the coastal actors, taken as those who have a role in the coastal 
agenda, and understanding the way they interact is of paramount importance in the 
development of a scientific knowledge-transfer framework and a critical factor in the 
successful coastal management (Brown et al., 2002). Moreover, coastal actors (other than 
those directly involved in coastal research) make the audiences that scientists aim to 
reach and knowing the audience is vital to ensure that communication is successful. In 
addition, and as put forward by Stocker and Wood (2014), “…coastal actors do not 
function alone but in existing networks and in legal, policy, political, social, technological, 
economic and cultural contexts. Coastal actors share links and can collaborate with each 
other to share power and available resources, such as knowledge”. Therefore, 
understanding the links between scientists and the other coastal actors is also 
fundamental in moving forward knowledge transfer and implementation.   

2.1 Coastal actors and their roles 

Scientists are those who pursuit knowledge and the understanding of the natural and 
social world entailing unbiased observations and systematic experimentation, following a 
systematic methodology based on evidence (EEB, 2016; TSC, 2016).  

Scientists generate knowledge based on the scientific method and aim to transfer it to 
other coastal actors. As scientific knowledge allows for the understanding of the natural 
world, it gives scientists a unique perspective on the coastal system. The ability to 
consider the processes driving coastal dynamics at different spatial and time scales makes 
scientists capable of supporting the functioning of that system under different forcing 
scenarios and evaluate different short- to long-term coastal management strategies. 
Moreover, scientific knowledge is not only relevant per se but also necessary in the 
integration of “all types of knowledge” (Nursey-Bray et al., 2014), which also includes 
bureaucratic and local knowledge (e.g., Edelenbos and van Buuren, 2011; Rinaudo and 
Garin, 2005; Hunt and Shackley, 1999). Benefits in the mobilization of bureaucratic and 
local knowledge are highlighted by Rinaudo and Garin (2005), and include “improving 
the quality of the identification of the issues at stake, the formulation of a generally 
complex and unstructured problem, and the identification of a large panel of alternative 
solutions”.  

 

 



Coastal actors, their roles and links 

 - 25 -  

Policy-makers and managers are responsible for the regulation of the coastal zone 
uses by establishing and implementing the policy framework for the coast. These actors 
detain bureaucratic knowledge, which is heavily intertwined with administrative and 
governmental practices (Edelenbos and van Buuren, 2011). When scientists aim to 
implement their findings policy-makers and managers are usually their primary audience.  

Society arises also as a key coastal actor as they benefit from the services provided by 
the coastal environment. Society is a very heterogeneous actor encompassing several 
clusters of people sharing similar goals and activities (e.g., surfers, fishermen, tourists). 
While a common understanding within these [sub]groups can ease knowledge transfer, 
scientists need to be aware that different clusters may have different coastal interests or 
expectations for the coast. This can favor the emergence of conflicts and constitute a 
barrier to science communication.  

Society is linked with the generation of local knowledge grounded in the experience 
gathered from physical proximity. Local knowledge is strongly associated with the day-to-
day activities of coastal users and derives from the practices in which people (inhabitants, 
entrepreneurs, etc.) are involved (Eshuis and Stuiver, 2005). Although society has been 
and still is frequently regarded as a passive intervenient, the fact is that the role of society 
in the definition of coastal strategies is increasing. In fact, to ensure broad support for 
the implementation of management strategies, society must adhere to the proposed ideas 
and solutions.  

In summary three major groups - scientists (coastal researchers), policy-makers and 
managers (coastal regulators), and society (coastal users) - arise as key players in the 
coastal agenda and each group has a specific role to play in that agenda. 

Table 1 presents the profile typology of the key actors. The information presented is 
based upon the results of the Socientize project (Socientize Team, 2013).

2.2 The “Coastal Knowledge Triangle” 

The Coastal Knowledge Triangle (Figure 1) aims to summarize and illustrate the key 
coastal actors, their roles and links. This model is based upon the works of Röckmann et 
al. (2015) and Hunt and Shackley (1999). Röckmann et al. (2015) present The Interaction 
Triangle as a tool for understanding stakeholder interactions in marine ecosystem-based 
management. Hunt and Shackley (1999) present The Climate Knowledge Triangle with 
possible forms of associating different types of knowledge in the scope of climate 
change.  

 

 

Figure 1. The Coastal Knowledge Triangle: coastal actors, their roles and links. Scientists use 
research methods to develop scientific knowledge and aim to transfer it. Policy-makers and 
managers, who detain bureaucratic knowledge, regulate the use of the coastal zone and convey 
their needs of information to scientists. Society benefits from the services provided by the coastal 
environment (e.g. fisheries, surfing, beach activities) and acquire local knowledge in relation to 
day-to-day activities; it influences policy-makers and managers by lobbying, and convey their 
needs of information to both policy-makers and managers, and scientists. 

The Coastal Knowledge Triangle (Figure 1) shows that the understanding of links among 
the different key coastal actors is a fundamental step in fostering knowledge transfer. The 
existence of weak bounds, or even disconnection, among coastal actors can seriously 
prejudice knowledge transfer. It must be stressed, however, that the links among them 
depend not only on their willingness but also on societal organization. This can be put in 
evidence through the consideration of some basic forms of governance and their 
implications in knowledge integration, where politicians, a subset of policy-makers group, 
detain a critical role in implementation. 

In participatory governance schemes where decision-making disregards scientific 
knowledge, management strategies emerge from the interaction between regulators and 
society (users). This scheme ensures that immediate societal expectations are integrated 



Coastal actors, their roles and links

within the spirit of regulations and management decisions. However, disregarding 
scientific knowledge, results in a disproportionally large influence of lobbying in the 
decision-making process that can threaten sustainability. In fact, the demands of society 
frequently do not encompass an adequate perception of coastal risk, especially at 
medium- to long-term time scales. For example, the uninformed occupation of a 
seafront, which may not be perceived as problematic in the short-term, may disregard or 
even lead to severe coastal erosion and flooding on a longer time scale, and compromise 
future management options. However, a governance system exclusively driven by 
scientific and bureaucratic knowledge, generally fails to consider the different points of 
view and needs of society. Such a technocratic system has well-known limitations in the 
ability to manage conflicts inherent to the different interests of coastal users (for 
example, as in the case of nuclear power plants located on the coast). Finally, under 
centralized governance schemes, policy-makers and managers (regulators) are decoupled 
from every other actor. In the case of centralized schemes, not only there is no 
independent control of management decisions, but there are also no countervailing 
mechanisms to assure coastal sustainability and the incorporation of society’s 
expectations. These considerations highlight the importance of the political environment, 
in its broadest sense, in providing the adequate settings to foster scientific knowledge 
transfer. In this context, the influence of politicians goes beyond policy-making and 
knowledge implementation, as they can also have a fundamental role in strengthening the 
links among key coastal actors.  

Chapter 2 |Key messages: 

v? The identification of the coastal actors and understanding the way they interact is of 
paramount importance in the development of a scientific knowledge-transferring 
framework: they are the audience that scientists aim to reach and knowing the audience is 
vital to make communication successful. 

v? Three key actors arise in the coastal agenda: scientists, policy-makers and managers, and 
society. Each actor has a specific role in the framework for the coast namely in 
contributing with specific types of knowledge to the overall objective of sustainability.  

v? Key coastal actors, their roles and links are summarized and illustrated by the Coastal 
Knowledge Triangle.  

v? The Coastal Knowledge Triangle stresses that the understanding of links among the different 
key coastal actors is a fundamental step in fostering knowledge transfer and that the 
existence of weak bounds, or even disconnection, among coastal actors can seriously 
prejudice knowledge transfer. 

v? The political environment influences the establishment and the strength of the links 
among key coastal actors. Nevertheless, scientists should always seek an active role in 
fostering knowledge transfer, even in an adequate political environment favoring the 
incorporation of scientific knowledge in decision-making.

3. Fostering scientific knowledge transfer  
Improving the integration of scientific knowledge in the development of coastal 

strategies implies that scientists must have an active role in fostering knowledge transfer. 
However, in doing this, scientists face several barriers hindering knowledge transfer, as 
described in sub-chapter 1.2 Gaps in scientific knowledge transfer. To overcome these barriers 
it is first necessary to acknowledge that the process of [science] communication involves 
a sender [scientist] delivering a message to a receiver (or receivers) [the other coastal 
actors] (Figure 2). Scientists must translate their message using a language that other 
coastal actors can understand and select the most adequate communication channel (or 
channels). This process is called framing (Figure 2). If scientists successfully frame their 
message, they will get feedback from their audience. Feedback indicates if and to what 
extent the message has been successfully transferred and is considered the essence of 
two-way communication (Hattie and Timperley, 2007). Engagement can be perceived as 
a “distance” between the sender and the receiver. If the sender and receiver are closer, 
the effort needed to convey the message (framing) is lower. For example, if the receiver 
understands scientific language, the framing effort in is smaller.

Figure 2. The science communication process: scientists aim to deliver the coastal message to the 
other actors and to be successful they need to frame their message. If scientists are able to 
connect with their audience and convey their message, receivers will give feedback. Engagement 
conceptualizes the distance that scientists need to overcome in delivering the message: shorter 
distances imply smaller framing efforts.   

 



Fostering scientific knowledge transfer

Fostering engagement and framing the coastal message arise as two conditions that 
scientists can act upon to overcame barriers in knowledge transfer. Scientists also have to 
find means to connect with the receivers choosing which of the following four 
mechanisms would provide the most effective linkage: outreach, crowdsourcing, 
managers-oriented tools and co-production (these mechanisms are further discussed later 
in Chapter 5. Mechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation).  

In any case, and despite the level of scientists’ motivation to communicate science, 
they should initiate the communication process by knowing their audiences and, ideally, 
by listen to them. Scientists have been responsible for almost all of the investigation 
addressing gaps in scientific knowledge transfer. Thus, most of the gaps identify in the 
literature have been inferred from their own experience (see sub-chapter 1.2). Actually, 
the literature lacks contribution on this subject accounting for the view of other coastal 
actors. Devaluating the opinion of the other coastal actors narrows the chance of 
identifying barriers to the communication process and this may reduce the effectiveness 
of strategies to narrow these barriers resting solely with scientists. To overcome this 
issue, and transform the “business as usual” one-way communication scheme into a 
broader two-way avenue, a worldwide web survey targeting coastal experts, including 
both scientists and policy-makers and managers, has been designed and conducted under 
the scope of this thesis. Results are presented and discussed below and were used to put 
forward conditions to improve knowledge transfer complementing previous studies.   

3.1 The need to listen 
[This subchapter is based on: Carapuço, M.M., Taborda, R., Andrade, C., Freitas, M.C. 2014a. Improving coastal 
knowledge transfer between researchers and managers: a two-way route. In: Cessa, M. (Ed), Beaches: Erosion, 
Management Practices and Environmental Implications. ISBN 978-1-63117-239-7.] 

Knowledge transfer involves sharing data and information (CEC, 2007). In such a 
procedure, it is assumed that those who generate knowledge are familiar with the types 
and formats of the information to be share and with whom. However, scientists and 
policy-makers and managers frequently have different, and occasionally divergent, 
understandings of the meaning of “relevant information”: scientists every so often focus 
on the state of the art, and policy-makers and managers usually expect translated data and 
information able to directly support management decisions.  

A worldwide survey was conducted between September and November 2013 using 
the SurveyMonkey® platform in order to assess the opinions of coastal scientists and 
policy-makers and managers about gaps in the transfer of coastal scientific knowledge. A 
total of 174 enquiries were gathered. Coastal scientists provided 107 answers (n=107) and 
coastal policy-makers and managers (involving in local to national authorities, non- and 
governmental organizations, tourism, fisheries and port authorities, provided 67 answers 
(n=67).

Results are available at a University of Lisbon website 
(http://disepla.fc.ul.pt/ktransfer/index.htm) excluding personal data to ensure 
participants’ anonymity. Data management and processing was done using IBM® SPSS® 
Statistics and ESRI® ArcGIS applications. Figure 3 shows the geographical distribution of 
the population targeted.  

Both the majority of scientists, and policy-makers and managers have been 
conducting their work in Portugal (57 and 82% respectively) followed by United States of 
America (12 and 16% respectively).  

 

 

Figure 3. Geographic distribution of the scientists (n=107), and policy-makers and managers 
sample (n=67). 

 

Results of the survey indicate that the majority of scientists (more than 80%) aim at 
incorporating their scientific findings in coastal zone management.  It was also possible 
to conclude that the incorporation of scientific knowledge in coastal management is 
becoming “business as usual”, as almost 40% of the policy-makers and managers stated 
that they always use scientific knowledge in their work (Carapuço et al., 2014a). These 
results are a positive sign in the scope of scientific knowledge transfer, allowing deducing 
a favorable environment to foster knowledge transfer and showing willingness of 
scientists and policy-makers and mangers to move forward knowledge transfer and 
integration. 

Different means of science dissemination are depicted in Figure 4 and Figure 5. Figure 4 
shows the effort/time spent by scientists in each science dissemination instrument 
revealing that research papers and technical reports are the means preferred by scientists, 
while non-technical outputs received less attention and merited less effort. Figure 5 shows 
that technical reports and papers are the means more often used by policy-makers and 
managers to access to scientific and technical contents.

The analyses of Figure 4 and Figure 5 reveals similarity between the dissemination 
means preferably chosen by scientists an the policy-makers and managers means to 
access scientific contents. The general agreement noted above suggests the absence of 
communication problems between both groups. However, and as illustrated in Figure 6 
and Figure 7, scientists and policy-makers and managers recognize the existence of 
relevant obstacles in knowledge transfer.

Analysis of Figure 6 and Figure 7 indicates that the major obstacle hindering scientific 
knowledge transfer identified by both parties is the channel preferred by scientists when 
it comes to dissemination of data, information and knowledge. Research papers are the 
preferred means of dissemination by scientists and this inherently implies using technical 
vocabulary (and frequently specific jargon), which may not be adequate to reach policy-
makers and managers. Moreover, research papers follow a reasoning outline that may 
transform a fine scientific paper into a tedious document from the point of view of the 
“non-initiated” reader.   

This suggests that policy-makers and managers are indeed constrained in their ability 
to use the information made available in scientific papers and technical reports. This 
empathizes the need of scientists to find the time and resources to disseminate their 
knowledge in non-scientists terms or, in alternative, the incorporation of knowledge 
brokers or resorting to boundary organizations as facilitators (as discussed further in sub-
chapter 3.3 Framing the message). This is depicted by the two bars on the right side of 
figures Figure 4 and Figure 5. 

Results also reveal that both scientists and policy-makers and managers identified a 
wide range of causes for gaps in scientific knowledge transfer besides the adequacy of 
channels used in data dissemination (Figure 6 and Figure 7, respectively). This may be due 
to differences in the respondents’ profile (e.g., different skills, responsibilities, 
experiences, competencies). However, the overall perception of scientists and non-
scientists concerning this matter reflects an unexpected general agreement, expressed by 
the similarity between the bars diagram depicted in Figure 6 and Figure 7.  

As a side thought this result raises relevant issues concerning the policies of scientific 
data dissemination and evaluation systems of scientists and scientific institutions that may 
be contributing to “getting apart” scientists and science from policy-makers and 
managers and society. In too many cases, rakings and measure of performance of 
scientists and institutions are to a large extent based upon indexes and activities of 
outreach have been somewhat underestimated.  

In conclusion, results from this survey corroborate the major outcome of the 
literature review presented in sub-chapter 1.2 Gaps in scientific knowledge transfer: 
communication gaps are the major obstacle in scientific knowledge transfer (regardless 
the scope being restricted to coastal issues or other aspects of scientific knowledge). The 
critical issue contributing to communication gaps is the channel of communication. Both 
scientists and non-scientists converge in identifying a large suite of reasons justifying the 
existence of communication gaps, besides the channels of communication, and both 
communities rank them in a similar way. This similarity constitutes a major opportunity 
in bridging together both key coastal actors.

3.2 Fostering engagement  

[This subchapter is based on: Carapuço, M.M., Taborda, R., Andrade, C., de Jonge, V.N. 2016a. Coping with coastal 
change: from scientific knowledge to implementation (Submitted)] 

The science communication process conceptualized in Figure 2 evidences that 

overcoming communication gaps is more likely to happen with effective engagement of 

coastal actors. Engagement is grounded on empathy and goes beyond simple awareness of 

the problem: it includes caring, motivation, willingness to act, and action itself (Lorenzoni et 

al., 2007).  

Engagement is not a simple task: it is an ongoing process, not confined within the 

timeframe of a particular project and there is no simple best way to engage with an audience 

(or audiences) (Cormick, 2012). “Get-together” opportunities, ranging from small informal 

meetings and workshops to conferences and seminars, are one way to foster engagement and 

maintain the linkages among the actors beyond project timeframes, enabling conditions to 

reach compromise and clearing ways for future co-operation. Willingness, trust, competence 

and commitment can be regarded as key enablers for successfully building engagement (e.g., 

Röckmann et al., 2015; Schmidt et al., 2014) (Figure 8). Achieving these conditions implies 

that scientists should be prepared to promote open and honest dialogues about their 

findings, including the benefits but also the limits, perils, and pitfalls (Lsehner, 2003). This 

practice is grounded in the principles of the precautionary principle (Carapuço, 2015a) and of 

the “best available knowledge”, meaning the latest state of knowledge or “state of the art”. 

According to the latter scientists acknowledge the existence of changes and limitations in 

scientific knowledge and understanding. Moreover, scientists should also be prepared to 

move forward and be expose to the public opinion something much more familiar to 

managers.

Engagement is a major and serious challenge but it will enhance understanding of the 

scientific approach to coastal issues, raising awareness of the value of scientific output and 

help in decision-making. Engagement fosters the acceptance and longevity of science-based 

policies, targeting coastal sustainability (Hines, 2010). Early engagement has the additional 

benefits of avoiding polarized positions, and helps to broaden consideration of issues.  

3.3 Framing the message 

[This subchapter is based on: Carapuço, M.M., Taborda, R., Andrade, C., de Jonge, V.N. 2016a. Coping with coastal 
change: from scientific knowledge to implementation (Submitted)] 

Framing also arises as another fundamental condition to overcome gaps in 
communication (Figure 2). Framing helps turning scientific data into meaningful 
information for the target audience. It involves encoding scientific findings into a simple 
and clear language, anticipating and eliminating likely causes of confusion and 
misunderstanding, so that the audience can decode the message and understands the idea 
being conveyed. In the scope of the present study, language is defined as the manner in 
which scientific knowledge is traduced (coded) attending to the audience’s specifies. It 
encompasses the discourse, images (including photographs and graphical representations) 
and indicators (further discussed in Chapter 4. Coastal indicators: a common language). 
Framing goes, however, beyond translating scientific data into a “common” language 
between scientists and their audiences. Framing also implies choosing the proper 
channels of communication, i.e., the manner in which the message is, or will be, sent. 
Communication channels include, among others, interpersonal communication, books, 
audio, video, websites and mobile applications (Estrada and Davis, 2015; Andrews et al., 
2005). Channels of communication can be used individually or combined in order to 
support narratives and storytelling and easily capture the audience’s attention, to achieved 
increased comprehension and to make the message more appealing (Dahlstrom, 2014).  

Figure 9 depicts the importance of framing to successfully deliver the coastal message 
and highlights that scientists may now be facing a new paradigm: framing the message is 
no longer centered in the subject, but is shifting to be centered in (different types of) 
audiences.  
 



Fostering scientific knowledge transfer

Figure 9. Scientists have to properly frame the coastal message to get it across and reach their 
audience. Once the content of the message is identified, scientists have to find the proper 
language and channels of communication to make it understandable and appealing. This figure 
illustrates the different reactions from the audience when the scientist refers to wave energy in 
formal terms and when he properly frames his message attending to the audience’ specificities.  

 

Any coastal actor driven by the identification of a relevant coastal issue can trigger the 
communication process: “Can we build here? Are their good waves for surfing in this 
area? Can I safely fish tomorrow?”. Scientists themselves may identify important issues 
that can compromise coastal sustainability (e.g., increasing storminess, destruction of 
habitats, increasing erosion). Although scientific knowledge plays an important role in 
answering these questions, “science itself” is not sufficient to ensure that the answer is 
successfully conveyed and understood. Scientists should preferably frame the message 
themselves taking into account the needs of information and expectations of their 
audience (Doumont, 2010). As an alternative to making scientists accountable for the 
design of the whole communication process, knowledge brokers or boundary 
organizations can be integrated to assist and facilitate the task of framing the message 
(e.g., Cvitanovic et al., 2015; Dilling and Lemos, 2011; Vogel et al., 2007). Knowledge 
brokers, also referred in the literature as linkage agents or professional facilitators (e.g., de

Jonge and Giebels, 2015; Carapuço et al., 2014a; Becheikh et al., 2010; Pielke, 2007; 
Huberman, 1990), are persons acting as intermediaries between scientists and non-
scientists and are fluent in both worlds (Dilling and Lemos, 2011). They have been 
successful in the U.S. Pacific Island region in “creating usable science” under the scope 
of climate knowledge (Dilling and Lemos, 2011). A boundary organization serves the 
function of working between the worlds of research and of the use or application of 
science. However, given their size and capacity, they may have more resources to tailor 
information and produce value-added products than individual brokers (Cash, 2001). 
Under adverse circumstances both knowledge brokers and boundary organizations can 
be further helpful in achieving consensus (for example, in overcoming difficulties in 
coordination and cooperation between different parties involved in a coastal issue) or for 
accomplishing a project within narrow time boundaries. 

Framing the coastal message requires effort and this implies that scientists are engaged 
in the communication process. Framing is an unavoidable reality within the task of 
scientific knowledge dissemination. It helps to capture audiences’ attention, makes the 
message understandable and assists scientists in communicating the relevance of their 
findings (Bubela et al., 2009). Framing helps scientists to communicate why an issue may 
be a problem, who or what might be responsible for it, and what should or could be 
done.

framing arise as conditions of vital importance. 

v? Engagement is grounded on empathy and, beyond simple awareness of the problem, 
implies action in itself enabled by coastal actors’ willingness, trust, competence and 
commitment. 

v? Framing helps turning scientific data into meaningful information for the target audience 
and involves translating scientific findings into languages understandable by the audience, 
as well as choosing the proper communication channels.

4. Coastal indicators: a common language 
Science communication poses additional challenges in finding a language adequate to 

foster mutual understanding between sender and receiver. Whatever the language 
selected it must be comprehensible to the target audience and, simultaneously, ensure 
rigorous reporting.  

Several international organizations forwarded guidelines on this matter and have 
stated that indicators constitute the most efficient way to transmit inherently complex 
information in a simplified and applicable form, allowing for the establishment of 
reference situations and quantitative assessment of evolution trends (e.g., EU, 2014; 
NOAA, 2010; UNESCO, 2006, 2003). In this sense, indicators arise as the universal 
language in coastal science communication facilitating the dialog among coastal actors 
(e.g., NOAA, 2010). However, concerning the coastal zone, the development of 
indicators is still in an emergent stage. The aim of the present chapter is to present an 
innovate contribution to the development of a common framework on coastal 
geoindicators.  

4.1 Motivation 

The coastal zone is a complex environment that encompasses several 
geomorphological features with specific dynamics. Beaches, in particular, are one of the 
most mutable environments where morphologic variations can occur at a wide range of 
temporal and spatial scales. Often, human interference with such a complex and dynamic 
system leads to negative impacts. To cope with coastal use-related conflicts, the 
integration of scientific knowledge is of vital importance. To achieve this objective, 
several coastal monitoring programs aiming to deliver scientific data to the management 
process have been developed worldwide, with specific data acquisition procedures and 
reporting methods, according to their aims and scopes  (e.g., Lynch et al., 2014; Psuty et 
al., 2012; 2010; MESSINA, 2005; Bradbury et al., 2002). Though valid for the specific 
environments and objectives they were designed for, information derived from these 
programs may not be suitable for use and comparison with other coastal areas. To 
improve data sharing and comparability, it is important to promote procedures that 
enlarge the scope of applications of the acquired data with minimum additional effort, 
and provide data and information in a standardized form. Indicators have been put 
forward as the most efficient form to do so (e.g., Carapuço, 2015b; NOAA, 2010).  



Coastal indicators: a common language 

 - 43 -  

However, the coastal zone lacks a widely accepted and normalized framework of basic 
definitions, common designations and measurement criteria to assist in choosing a set of 
coherent and consistent indicators to described the coastal state.  

4.2 Scope 

The environments and morphological domains herein considered are schematized in 
Figure 10. Their physical boundaries were defined aiming to make them useful for 
different areas of expertise (e.g., coastal engineering, management, research), and are 
defined as follow:  

Beach: accumulation of wave reworked unconsolidated sediment (usually sand and/or 
gravel) extending from the closure depth to inland up to a physiographic change such as 
a dune field or sea cliff or to the point where the permanent vegetation is established 
(Komar, 1983).  

Coastal dunes: hills or ridges of sand deposited by the wind and/or wave action, or can be 
artificially deposited, and are often covered with beachgrass (NOAA, 1994).  

Coastal barriers: a narrow low-lying strip of land consisting of beach and dunes extending 
parallel to the trend of the coast and separated from the mainland by a fresh, brackish or 
salt water body or marsh (NOAA, 1994).

coastal geoindicators: CP - coastline position; SBCREST - shoreline based on the berm crest; 
SHWSL - shoreline based on the high water swash line; SMHW - shoreline based on the mean 
high water line. 

4.3 Definition and background  

Historically, the term indicator has been used as a statement with the ability to 
measure or describe variables; a parameter that indicates some characteristic or metric. 
One of the commonly used definition of indicator is from UNESCO (2006): “indicator is 
a quantitative/qualitative statement or measured/observed parameter that can be used to 
describe an existing situation and measure changes and trends over time”.  

 



Coastal indicators: a common language 

 - 44 -  

According to Cobb and Rixford (1998), indicators have been used “since the dawn of 
history, and the first reference of human’s self-conscious use of indicators dates back to the 1830s referring 
to the judgment of social conditions using statistical indicators to improve public health and social 
conditions”. Cohn, in 1899, refers to the use of indicators associated to the disciplines of 
chemistry and pharmacy. In the 20th century, indicators emerged in other areas: in the 
1920s, economic indicators, such as the gross domestic product (GDP), the rate of 
inflation, or public sector borrowing and debt, were considered essential tools to measure 
the state of economies (Keating, 2001). More recently, in the 1970s, specific indicators 
were developed and used in the description of the state of environment (SoE). In what 
concerns to indicators related to the description of coastal features, the earliest reference 
is even more recent (Berger, 1996). A significant number of essays, reports and projects 
focused on indicators in the scope of coastal zone management have since been 
produced (e.g., SUSTAIN, 2012; Ciavola et al., 2011; Marchand, 2010; NOAA, 2010; 
EPA, 2008; Davidson et al., 2007; Martí et al., 2007; van Koningsveld et al., 2007; UNEP, 
2006; UNESCO 2006, 2003; OECD, 2003; UAB-GIM, 2002; SECRU, 2001). Table 2 
presents a chronological summary of the use of indicators to describe the SoE focusing 
on the ones that describe the geomorphological state of the coastal environment. 

Analysis of Table 2 leads to the conclusion that during the first years, SoE reporting 
focused on gathering and reporting as much knowledge and information as possible. 
These early reports constituted valuable reference works. However, they were extensive, 
too complex and almost impenetrable to anyone searching for a quick synopsis of key 
issues and trends (Keating, 2001). The demand for critical environmental snapshots was 
later achieved through the use of indicators, and SoE reporting evolved from 
encyclopedic tomes to indicator-based reports, often grouped under specific issues (e.g., 
air and water quality). Concerning the state of the coast, geoindicators emerged in 1996 
as high-resolution measures of short-term (&lt;100 years) surface or near-surface changes 
in earth processes and phenomena that are significant for environmental monitoring and 
assessment (Berger, 1996). 

Since 2000, coastal indicators started to be developed and used as a tool to support 
coastal management, aiming to promote the interaction between coastal researchers and 
managers in application-oriented knowledge-based development. Projects EUROSION 
(UAB-GIM, 2002); CoastView (CoastView Team, 2002; Davidson et al., 2007; van 
Koningsveld et al., 2007; Jiménez et al., 2007), DEDUCE (Martí, et al., 2007), 
CONSCIENCE (Marchand, 2010; Jiménez, 2010), MICORE (Ciavola, 2011; Ciavola et 
al., 2011), SUSTAIN (SUSTAIN, 2012) and PEGASO (Santoro et al., 2014) are examples 
of efforts to enhance the integration of the results of scientific research in the process of 
coastal decision-making through the use of coastal indicators. However, the indicators 
emerge from these studies were project- or site-specific and their performance limited to 
few specific management settings, with little or no transferability potential to other 
realities.

SoE reports: focused on describing environmental conditions and trends in 
environmental issues (e.g., air quality, marine resources), aimed primarily at raising

The Bruntland Report (1987) and, subsequently, both the G7 Economic Summit in

need for indicators to gauge progress towards sustainable development.

The construction and use of sustainable development indicators has proceeded 
apace; the dominant trend in SoE reporting shifts away from comprehensive reports 
towards more focused indicator-based reports to serve the needs of, or to influence, 
specific users, especially decision-makers.

1992 

The International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) identified a gap in SoE 
reporting: the absence of measures describing abiotic, surface and nearsurface 
geological processes. In response to this need, the IUGS established a working 
group to develop, what was designated as geoindicators.

Despite the relevance of coastal indicators, indicator-based reports addressing

national and international levels, do not consider coastal indicators to describe the 
state of the coastal zone.  

The adoption of coastal indicators is limited to a few management settings and 
particular projects.

4.4 Identified gaps 

The appraisal of coastal indicators-related literature reveals that a myriad of indicators 
have been used to report the state of the coastal environment. In this review, numerous 
inconsistencies in the reporting process were found, including the use of different 
indicators’ designations to report the same geomorphological feature, the use of different 
indicators’ categories for the same purpose and paradoxes in wording. Moreover, even 
the meaning of the word “indicator” is not consensual. These discrepancies make an all-
inclusive analysis on this topic an almost unfeasible task, especially when adopting a top-
down approach.  



Coastal indicators: a common language 

 - 46 -  

For example, attempting to compile a review on coastal indicators, using the key word 
“indicator” will exclude a significant number of contributions that have adopted other 
designations, such as “criteria” (e.g., CZMA, 1972), “index” (e.g., Bukata, 2005), 
“parameter” (e.g., Baptista et al., 2011), “proxy” (e.g. Farris and List, 2007), “standard” 
(e.g., CZMA, 1972), “variable” (e.g., Thieler and Hammar-Klose, 2000) and “vital sign” 
(e.g., NPS, 2005; Stevens et al., 2005), are excluded. This exclusion includes, for example, 
works related to well-established and extremely valuable coastal monitoring programs 
that rely upon indicator-based approaches (e.g., NPS, 2005). 

Concerning the categories of indicators, five designations were identified in literature: 
geoindicators (Carapuc?o et al., 2013a; Bush and Young, 2009; Berger, 1997, 1996), coastal 
state indicators (Marchand, 2010; Sutherland, 2010; van Rijn, 2010; van Koningsveld, 
2003), science coastal state indicators (Giardino et al., 2014; van Koningsveld et al., 2005; 
van Koningsveld, 2003), issue-based coastal state indicators (van Koningsveld et al., 2005; 
van Koningsveld, 2003), and geomorphological indicators (Bernatchez et al., 2011). 

Additionally, different indicators were found to refer to the same target-features. For 
example, the width of the beach is referenced to using three different designations: beach 
width (Marchand, 2010; Sutherland, 2010; van Rijn, 2010; Bush and Young, 2009; van 
Koningsveld et al., 2005; van Koningsveld, 2003; Bush et al., 1999), backshore width 
(Marchand, 2010; Sutherland, 2010) and berm width (van Rijn, 2010).  

Furthermore, whereas some indicators are supported by very detailed measurement 
criteria, in other cases the criteria have been poorly defined. Without this information, 
the usefulness of indicators is prejudiced and transferability other realities very limited.  

This lack of specificity and consistency described above reflects the need for a 
normalized scheme and calls for a standard approach describing the state of the coastal 
environment reporting through the use of indicators targeting universality, simplicity and 
unambiguity. 

4.5 Development of a common framework 

The development of a common framework constitutes a first step towards the 
establishment of a set of coastal geoindicators aiming and using a consensus-based 
approach. This effort is grounded in previous works, and relies upon a compromise that 
aims to normalize indicator concepts and designations. “Geoindicator” is herein 
proposed as the most suitable term to encompass the category of indicators pertaining to 
surface or near-surface changes in earth processes and phenomena, as discussed above 
(see 4.3 Definition and background). This designation is simultaneously the oldest and still 
in-use term having been original proposed by the IUGS (Berger, 1996).

4.5.1 Indicator properties 

Indicators should share a set of fundamental characteristics in order to provide a 
simplified form to communicate complex data and information among stakeholders. In 
order to assure relevance of the indicators, they must embed the following proprieties, 
and be:  

Specific: indicators should yield a clear representation of the system characteristic they are 
intended to reflect. 

Measurable: indicators should be quantifiable. 

Achievable: indicators should rely upon implementation and collection methods that are 
feasible with available resources and intellectual capital. 

Relevant: there must be a direct link between the indicator and the underlying key issue or 
target-question to be answered. 

Time-bound: indicators should be responsive to changes in time and provide timely 
information. 

These characteristics have been put together under the acronym SMART (Specific, 
Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). SMART indicators play an important 
role in result-based management strategies (MDF, 2005). Several organizations and 
authors acknowledge these properties as the most relevant in indicators' selection in 
order to assure that they are comparable (e.g., NOAA, 2010; Sutherland, 2010; van Rijn, 
2010; UNESCO, 2006; OECD, 2003; CoastView Team, 2002).  

4.5.2 The challenge 

The process of simplification in reporting the state of the coastal environment using 
indicators poses a real challenge because of the local and often site-specific nature of the 
coastal features and management issues addressed. For this reason, the adoption of a 
common measurement criterion, applicable worldwide and to different geomorphological 
settings, can be controversial (e.g., NRC,1990) for further discussion on this topic). This 
drawback is shared by all indicators and is particularly well documented in the case of the 
shoreline position (e.g., Galgano and Douglas, 2008; Boak and Turner, 2005; Byrnes et al., 
2003; Kraus and Rosati, 1997). In fact, this is one of the major reasons that have 
hindered the adoption of a common and widely accepted criterion that could be used at 
every location of world’s coast. However, and despite these difficulties, other scientific 
areas have shown that the process of simplification in reporting is not only a possible 
task but also a vital one. For example, the GDP reports financial information from 
different countries with very different realities, and despite the difficulties associated with 
its estimation and associated uncertainty (Xianchun, 2002), it has come to be a well-
established and accepted indicator, useful to convey in a simple form a complex 
economic setting, not only to economic professionals but also to non-experts. A similar 
approach was followed in this work, relying upon a compromise attitude among the 
different schools of thought, targeting a consensus-based approach.  



Coastal indicators: a common language 

 - 48 -  

4.5.3 A common framework 

A common framework on coastal geoindicators focusing on sandy coastal 
environments is presented in Table 3. The baseline information for this work includes a 
thorough analysis of the scientific papers and reports addressing coastal indicators and 
metrics therein incorporated. From the literature analyzed, a total of forty-three 
indicators were found. However, in reality, they target only sixteen different coastal 
features (Table 3) as several indicators with different names target the same issue 
(identified in Table 3 as “Other common designations”).   

The majority of the key issues addressed by indicators, as found in the literature, are 
related to “risk assessment” and “coastal protection” (Table 3), a situation that highlights 
the relevance of coastal indicators in providing useful information for coastal 
management, in particular, and to society in more general terms.  

The proposed framework does not introduce additional designations, but derives 
from the application of the existing ones. In the cases where the same indicator has been 
referred by more than one designation, the one that has a clear cross-discipline meaning 
prevailed.  

The proposed measurement criteria target a consensus-based approach, adopting the 
most widely recognized standards and aiming to be globally assessable. For the majority 
of the indicators, it was possible to identify a single and rather consensual criterion. In 
the case of the physical interface of land and water (sensu lato), related to coastline and 
shoreline concepts, it was not possible or suitable to achieve a consensus. In the present 
study, the coastline and shoreline are considered to be related to different morphological 
elements: the coastline position refers to the landward limit of the backshore (taken as 
the toe position of the dune, cliff or structure confining the beach) (Figure 10) whereas 
shoreline refers to the physical interface of land and water (Dolan et al., 1991). The first 
concept is more conservative in spatial location and useful for different purposes than 
the latter. Additionally, in selecting an indicator concerning the shoreline position, it 
should also be considered that data may derive from very different sources (e.g., field 
surveys, LiDAR, historical maps, air photos, satellite and video imagery), and can be 
either feature-based (e.g., Psuty et al., 2010) or datum-based (e.g., Hess, 2003). To 
overcome this obstacle without losing valuable information and, at the same time, to 
eliminate confusion, it is suggested that the shoreline indicator designation should 
include the variable used.  

 

 

 

 



Coastal indicators: a common language 

 - 49 -  

Therefore, it is proposed the adoption of the following proxies and notations for the 
shoreline indicator, according to the method of collection used (Figure 10): 

SBCREST: to be used when the shoreline is morphology-based. It is suggested the 
adoption of the active berm crest (BCREST) because it is a feature commonly used as a 
shoreline proxy (Kraus and Rosati, 1997) that can be extracted from topographic data. 

SHWL: to be used when the shoreline is imagery-based. It is suggested the adoption of 
the high water swash line (HWSL), because high water line is the most commonly-used 
shoreline indicator (Boak and Turner, 2005). 

SMHW: to be used when the shoreline is elevation-based. It is suggested the adoption of 
the mean high water (MWH) level because it matches a standard tidal datum (Hess, 
2003). 

The measurements expressed in Table 3 are relative to cross-shore profiles and the 
units are: length - L -, time - T - and qualitative - Q.

Coastal indicators: a common language 

 - 51 -  

4.6 Conclusions 

The adoption of a framework of indicators as a tool to describe the state and trends of 

evolution of the coastal zone has been applied inconsistently. The major cause of the delay in 

the generalized adoption of a widely accepted framework is the existence of a myriad of 

indicators that are frequently poorly defined. Inconsistences were found related with the 

indicators’ designations, categories and measurement criteria. These shortcomings call for a 

standardized approach in coastal indicators’ measurement and reporting, targeting simplicity 

and unambiguity. To address this issue, a common framework for the establishment of 

coastal geoindicators for sandy coast environments is proposed. Sixteen indicators are 

identified as relevant for beach, coastal dune and coastal barrier environments. This effort 

aims to contribute to the widespread adoption of coastal indicators as common language in 

the dialogue between coastal actors.  

Chapter 4 |Key messages: 

v? Indicators provide a simplified form to communicate complex data and information, and 
arise as the most adequate common language in the dialog among costal actors. 

v? The existence of a myriad of indicators, frequently poorly defined, was identified as a 
major cause that has their generalized adoption.  

v? A standardized approach in coastal indicators’ measurement and reporting, targeting 
simplicity and unambiguity was lacking. 

v? A first contribution to the development of a common framework on coastal geoindicators 
is presented and sixteen indicators are identified as most relevant for communicating the

5. Mechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: 
from concept to implementation 

Scientists can adopt different mechanisms to connect with their audience. Each 
mechanism provides a different route for scientists to link with the audience, leading to 
different types of feedback. If adequately used, mechanisms to improve the transfer of 
scientific knowledge can foster engagement, minimize the framing effort and optimize 
audiences’ feedback.  

The most widely known and adopted mechanism to transfer scientific knowledge is 
outreach (as formal education is beyond the scope of this work). However, scientists 
must be aware that other means are also available: crowdsourcing, managers-oriented 
tools and co-production. These latter three mechanisms, although in earlier stages of 
development, are promising alternatives and should be considered as major opportunities 
to foster knowledge transfer. In this chapter the concept associated of each of the four 
mechanisms and examples of their application to real-world developed under the scope 
of this thesis are presented.  

5.1 Outreach 

Outreach in coastal science aims to raise coastal literacy and awareness. These are 
important political and societal issues characterizing a knowledge-based society engaged 
with science. Two outreach projects were developed in the scope of the present work: 
“The Beaches of Cascais: past and present” and “The Nazaré Wave: a trigger for 
learning”. These projects focus on the two key-elements of beach dynamics, sand and 
waves. The implementation of both projects returned valuable insights on the audience 
responsiveness and also on to what extend lay audiences can effectively be motivated, 
influenced and engaged in coastal issues. 

5.1.1 The concept 

Outreach is a "meaningful and mutually beneficial collaboration with partners in 
education, business, public and social service. It represents that aspect of teaching that 
enables learning beyond the campus walls, that aspect of research that makes what we 
discover useful beyond the academic community, and that aspect of service that directly 
benefits the public" (Ray, 1999). Outreach aims at fostering public awareness and 
understanding of science, thus developing comprehension of both the meaning and 
knowledge implications (Burns et al., 2003).

 - 55 -  

In outreach, the message to be conveyed can be framed resorting to a wide range of 
channels of communication, including tutoring, giving formal presentations and also 
supporting teachers, developing resources and so forth (Andrews et al., 2005).  

5.1.2 “The Beaches of Cascais: past and present” project 

[This subchapter is based on: Carapuço, M.M., Taborda, R., Silveira, T.M., Andrade, C. 2016c. Upstream Public 
Engagement On Coastal Issues: Audience Response To A Science-Based Exhibition. In preparation] 

“The Beaches of Cascais: past and present” project was an outreach initiative 
developed with the goal of upstream public engagement on coastal issues. It was the 
outcome of a collaborative initiative involving the Faculty of Sciences of University of 
Lisbon, the Municipal Council of Cascais and the Portuguese Environmental Agency. 

5 . 1 . 2 . 1  M o t i v a t i o n   

Public understanding of coastal dynamics and coastal change is fundamental in 
supporting the implementation of sustainable coastal strategies. However, in addition to 
the challenges previously discussed in subchapters 3.2 Fostering engagement and 3.3 Framing 
the message, when scientists address the dynamics of beach systems a further challenge 
arises: preconceived ideas. For many people beaches are places of memories built during 
childhood and emotional memories play an important role in the public response in later 
stages of life (Zadra and Clore, 2011). Perception of size of both objects and distances 
varies substantially from childhood to, and over, later stages of life and both perceptions 
may also differ from the true dimension of the entities brought to our conscience. The 
true dimension of the beach of our infancy is very often different from what we 
perceived it to be. Objects that we found gigantic in early stages of our existence were in 
fact considerably smaller (Banakou et al., 2013). This illusion is due to the size of the 
physical world being perceived in relation to the size of the perceiver’s body (Banakou et 
al., 2013; Linkenauger et al., 2010). For example, as a person grows and gets taller, fewer 
steps and less effort are required to cover a certain distance (van der Hoort et al., 2011). 
The sense of our own body affects how we visually experience the world and plays an 
important role in perceiving our surroundings and their dimensions. Traditionally, our 
infancy memories recall us of larger and wider beaches. This leads to a sense of feeling 
and believing that beaches are getting smaller as we grow taller and older.  

To this size-illusion effect adds the human tendency to generalize and overvalue 
negative things (Baumeister et al., 2001) and the notion that “it was better in the good old 
days”. Media can also magnify this negative bias, as it often emphasizes bad news (e.g., 
coastal erosion vs. coastal accretion). Research and its outputs are also generally focused 
on erosional behavior as it dominates the evolutional trend of coastlines worldwide in the 
recent past and because retreating coastlines are more prone to risk (e.g., Pilkey, 2008). 



Mechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation 

 - 56 -  

Society perception of coastal evolution is built upon all the aforementioned biases. So 
it is natural that there is a generalized assumption that all beaches are eroding – even if 
they are not. In fact, coastline evolution depends on many factors, including the 
geomorphological setting, sediment budget and human intervention so, contrary to what 
is often deeply rooted in public [mis]perception, many coastal stretches are stable or 
under accretion. The project “The Beaches of Cascais: past and present” arose with the 
aim of shifting the public perspective on the generalized assumption that all beaches are 
eroding.

An outdoor science-based exhibition, developed in the scope of this work, was the 
platform designed to trigger public’s attention and foster society engagement with coastal 
issues (Figure 11). The exhibition focused on the evolution of the beaches of Cascais 
municipality (Portugal) that have been mostly stable in the last decades and, in some 
cases, increased in area. Photographs taken from the early to mid-20th century and recent 
ones were adopted as the language to convey a coastal message of “beach invariance”, 
aiming to shift the public perspective on the generalized assumption that all beaches are 
eroding.

Cascais is a cosmopolitan area with a high touristic demand located in the west coast 
of Portugal (Figure 12). Since the mid-19th century the beaches along the Cascais 
coastline, the so-called Portuguese Sunshine Coast, have been very popular amongst 
those who live in Cascais and Lisbon areas, and tourists all over the world. Today, most 
of Cascais’ eighteen beaches still preserve much of their original charm, and remain one 
of the icons of this municipality.

Figure 12. Location of Cascais’ beaches (Cascais, Portugal). 

Beaches of Cascais correspond mainly to small pocket sand beaches. On the landward 
side, these beaches are usually limited by low cliffs or manmade structures aiming to 
protect sea front property or infrastructures (e.g., roads) and used for recreation purposes 
(e.g., seaside promenade). Cascais coastline can be divided in two littoral segments with 
different orientation and contrasting wave exposure: a western segment, more exposed to 
the prevailing northwest waves generated in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, where the 
beaches of Abano, Guincho, Água Doce and Cresmina are included; and a southern 
segment, sheltered from the prevailing wave regime and thus experiencing a milder wave 
regime, encompassing the beaches from Santa Marta to Carcavelos (Figure 12).  

Analysis of aerial photographs, maps and historical postcards, dated from the early 
20th century to the present allowed deducing the past evolution of Cascais’ beaches. It 
was possible to identify changes in position of the shoreline in the vast majority of 
beaches, related with seasonal to interannual variations in oceanographic forcing, but 
excluding a perceptible long-term trend. Beach areas updrift of groins are exception to 
this, and Moitas, Tamariz and Avencas beaches have experienced localized accretion 
following the constructing of groins. Accretion lasted until the saturation of their 
retention potential (Carapuço et al., 2012). The long-term stability of the beaches of 
Cascais makes them an ideal study site to evaluate the influence of outreach initiatives 
aiming to raise public understanding on coastal issues. In this case, the shift in peoples’ 
opinion from the generalized assumption that all beaches are eroding to an 
understanding of long-term beach stability, regardless seasonal to interdecadal reversible 
changes, can be a valuable indicator of successful receptivity and assimilation of 
information by the public.

As a word of caution, it must be noted that the behavior of the Cascais beaches 
throughout the last 100 years should not be straightforwardly used to forecast their 
evolution into the near future. There is an increasing consensus that an accelerating sea-
level rise (SLR) scenario due to climate warming will have significant impacts on the 
coastal zone (Church et al., 2013). For example, the work of Taborda and Ribeiro (2015) 
suggest that, in relation to acceleration of SLR, a reduction in the exposed area of all 
Cascais beaches is expected. 

T h e  e x h i b i t i o n  

The exhibition “The Beaches of Cascais: past and present” focused on the changes of 
the beaches along the Cascais coastline (Figure 13). The concept of the exhibition was 
thought to maximize public engagement. This objective was accomplished by adopting 
the following strategies in framing the message:  

Location: the exhibition took place outdoor, in an attractive and pleasant seaside 
promenade where hundreds of people walk every day. This setting allowed reaching a 
wider audience and contacting in "their own ground”.  

Storytelling: the narrative of the evolution of the beaches of Cascais was supported mainly 
upon the comparison of present-day photographs with ones from the early to mid-20th 
century. Supporting the narrative format on photographs allows audiences with different 
backgrounds to “find the answer on their own”. Not imposing a solution makes easier 
for people to accept it and to retain their own findings.  

Design: large panels with appealing design, supported by large-format printed 
photographs triggered the public attention.  

The exhibition was set up along the seaside promenade that starts at Cascais village 
(Figure 12) and consisted of thirty large prints (2x1m) (Figure 13).  Twenty-eight prints 
showed the same beach as captured by old and recent photographs, with the pictures 
displayed side-by-side. One print displayed a map with the name and location of the 
beaches, and another one contained a brief description of beach dynamics.

Figure 13. Images illustrating the exhibition “The Beaches of Cascais: past and present”. 

 

Old photographs were entirely retrieved from the Cascais' Historical Municipal 
Archive because of authorship issues. Two photographs from each beach were selected, 
based on the oldest age and the largest beach coverage, ensuring the needed print quality 
except for Guincho, Azarujinha, Bafureira and Carcavelos, because there was only one 
photograph available fulfilling the aforementioned requisites. There were no available old 
photographic records for the Água Doce and Moitas beaches.  

The present-day photographs were taken by a professional photographer working for 
the Municipal Council of Cascais (on the 21st and 22nd of May 2015), guided by the 
author of this work, aiming to reproduce, as closely as possible, the image captured by 
the old records. The photographs were acquired from the same point of view of the old 
pictures, except where the original location was no longer accessible either because of 
cliff retreat or coastal development. The stage of the tide was also taken into 
consideration, and the timing of images acquisition selected so that the uncovered beach 
area in old and new pictures was broadly the same.

Photographs displayed in the panels were complemented with small bilingual texts 
(Portuguese and English) describing the geomorphological and geographical setting of 
each beach, as well as noticeable architectural and social features. Texts avoided 
references to evolutionary trends allowing for the audience to infer their own conclusions 
about the system behavior.  

The panels were installed on the 4th of June 2015, and the opening of the exhibition 
took place the next day. The exhibition remained available to residents and those visiting 
Cascais coast and beaches until the end of September 2015.

The impact of the exhibition on the public understanding about the evolution of 
Cascais’ beaches was assessed by a two-phase survey: a first phase took place just before 
the exhibition and the second phase after people watching the panels. The survey was 
conducted anonymously and was based upon short and simple questionnaires available in 
Portuguese and English. A total of 682 answers were obtained (n=341 previous to the 
exhibition, and n=341 after the exhibition). Questionnaires and responses are available 
for download at http://beachphotomonitoring.campus.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/exhibition.html.

The first phase of the survey took place between May 12th and June 3rd 2015 (Table 4). 
A five-question questionnaire was made available online at the website of Municipal 
Council of Cascais, and was also publicized through the websites of the Faculty of 
Sciences of the University of Lisbon, the Portuguese Environmental Agency, and 
internet social media.

 - 61 -  

The first two questions were related with the participants’ characteristics: their age and 
if they were living or visiting Cascais. Two questions followed aiming to assess the 
public’s familiarity with the coast of Cascais: participants were requested to indicate their 
favorite beach and how many beaches exist in the Cascais municipality. The last question 
was a closed-format and multiple-choice question about the perception on the evolution 
of the beaches of Cascais: beaches are increasing, stable or decreasing.  

The second phase of the survey took place during the exhibition, between June 22nd 
and August 13th 2015 (Table 4). This phase consisted of face-to-face interviews carried 
out at the exhibition site, targeting people that were observing the panels. A team of 
volunteers, Marézinhas, clearly identified as working for the Municipal Council of Cascais, 
conducted these interviews. 

The main objectives of the second phase of the survey were to collect a sample size 
equal to the first phase and to increase the level of detail provided in the previous phase 
the multiple-choice question about the perception on the state of the beaches. The 
change on the questions about beach evolution was based upon the fact that the 
participants were in situ, and watching photographs off the beaches concern. This made 
the three response options made available in the first phase somewhat limitative. Thus, 
five options of response for the same question were made available in the second phase 
(see Table 4). Two other items were added in the second questioners. Participants were 
asked if the use of old and present-day photographs was an adequate framing option to 
illustrate beach evolution, and why. Participants were also requested to express their 
opinion concerning other type of information on the Cascais beaches that they would 
like to access. Both these two latter questions created the opportunity for participants to 
express their opinion and share ideas.  

The results of the survey were all compiled in electronic format and organized for 
data analysis. Data management and processing was done using IBM® SPSS® Statistics 
and ESRI® ArcGIS applications. Pearson’s chi-square test was used to test the 
independency of the variables.  

B e f o r e  t h e  e x h i b i t i o n :  a p p r a i s i n g  a s s u m p t i o n s   

Regarding the first phase of the survey 68% of 341 participants lived in Cascais and 
32% were visitors. The majority (49.6%) were 31 to 50 years old and those were followed 
by those with more than 50 years of age (25.5%); 23.5% of the participants were between 
18 and 30 years old, and only 1.5% were under 18. Guincho was voted the favorite beach 
of Cascais, followed by Carcavelos (Figure 14). These beaches are the widest of Cascais, 
and are very popular for surf and other water-related sports. Less favorite beaches, Água 
Doce and Santa Marta, correspond to very small beaches, only reachable during low tide.

About 36% of the respondents answered that the number of beaches in Cascais 
ranges from 15 to 20, followed by 35% that responded 10 to 15 beaches. As the Cascais 
coastline encompasses 18 beaches, these results showed that the majority of the audience 
had a fair good perception about the number of beaches.

Concerning beach evolution, the majority of the audience (57.8%) believed that the 
beaches in this municipality were decreasing (meaning that beaches have been losing 
sand); 38.7% answered that Cascais’ beaches were stable, and only a small percentage 
(3.5%) answered that beaches were increasing (Figure 15).

In the second phase of the survey 60.4% of the 341 participants were people living in 
Cascais and 39.6% visitors. Almost half of the participants were over 50 years old 
(49.3%), and 21.4% were between 31 to 50 years old. About 15.2% of the responders 
were under 18 years, and 14.1% were between 18 and 30 years.  

After watching “The Beaches of Cascais: past and present” exhibition, the opinion of 
the audience concerning the evolution of the beaches of Cascais was as follows: 36.1% 
answered that the beaches were increasing (all increasing - 15%; and majority increasing - 
21.1%); 34.9% responded that beaches were stable; and 29% that beaches were 
decreasing (all decreasing - 5.3% and majority decreasing - 23.8%). This opinion is shared 
by those living and visiting Cascais and amongst respondents with different ages. 

Figure 16 shows the comparison of the results on the public perception on beach 
evolution before and after the exhibition.

Figure 16. People’s opinion concerning the evolution of the beaches of Cascais before and after 
the exhibition. 

There was a noticeable change in public opinion regarding perception of trends in 
beach change: before the exhibition most people believed that beaches were decreasing 
(57.8%), while after watching the exhibition most people considered that beaches are 
stable or increasing (34.9% and 36.1%, respectively). Pearson’s chi-square test was 
performed to compare the data acquired before and after the exhibition (Figure 16) and 
the result was found to be highly significative (test statistics 124.4; p &amp;lt;0.001). The shift 
in public opinion indicates the successful transfer of science-based information to the 
public and highlights that the goal of the exhibition was attained.  

The use of old and present-day photographs to illustrate beach evolution was 
considered adequate by a large majority (93.3%) of the participants, while only 2.6% 
considered this media inadequate. “Allowing observing beach evolution”, “Beautiful and useful”, 
and “It presents additional information related with other issues (historical, architectural)” illustrate 
comments related to this question. These results indicate that photographs performed 
well as a good language supporting the narrative.  

Concerning the last item of the questionnaire the majority of the responders 
commented that the information portrayed by the exhibition was adequate. Nevertheless 
some people made comments outside of the scope of the exhibition mentioning that they 
would like to have easier access to information on quality issues (water and sand quality 
parameters) and to the history of the beaches of Cascais (heritage, architecture).

Communicating beach dynamics to the public is a difficult task. Challenges arise, not 
only related with the need to capture the public’s attention to science, but also in dealing 
with people’s assumptions. “The Beaches of Cascais: past and present” exhibition was 
designed to upstream public engagement on coastal issues. The exhibition concept 
considered location, storytelling and design as key framing strategies in overcoming the 
challenges faced by communicating science to the public. A survey conducted before the 
exhibition reveals that the majority of the public believed that the beaches of Cascais 
were under erosion. However, after watching the exhibition, the public’s perspective on 
the evolution of Cascais beaches shifted towards stability and accretion trends, a 
perspective in line with their real long-term trend. Results show that the “The Beaches of 
Cascais: past and present” exhibition was a highly valuable science outreach initiative as it 
contributed to raise public understanding about the coastal system.  

5.1.3  “The Nazaré Wave: a trigger for learning” project 

 “The Nazaré Wave: a trigger for learning” project was developed with the goals of 
raising ocean literacy and capture the attention of young students (in particular) and 
society (in general) to the importance of scientific knowledge integration in ocean and 
coastal management. This project was developed in the framework of the present thesis 
by the Faculty of Sciences of University of Lisbon and was funded by the European 
Economic Area Financial Mechanism in the framework of the Programme PT02 – 
Integrated Marine and Coastal Water Management (#PT02_2ºRPS_0008).  

5 . 1 . 3 . 1  M o t i v a t i o n   

Ocean and coastal management face relevant sustainability challenges. It is consensual 
that a wiser governance of both environments can only be achieved by the involvement 
of all key actors. In this scope scientists, as knowledge generators, have a vital role in 
transferring their knowledge and in raising awareness and understanding beyond the 
scientific community. The project “The Nazaré Wave: a trigger for learning” was 
designed with the purpose of transferring scientific knowledge about the physics of 
waves using the Nazaré Wave as the trigger, a gigantic wave that takes place at Norte 
beach (central western Portuguese coast, Portugal, ) (Carapuço et al., 2016d). Moreover, 
waves are not only important by themselves but also represent a dominant source of 
energy in the nearshore zone. Wave energy is ultimately the driving force behind coastal 
morphological change (Masselink and Huges, 2003).

5 . 1 . 3 . 2  P r o j e c t  d e v e l o p m e n t  

The project “The Nazaré Wave: a trigger for learning” was framed under Responsible 
Research and Innovation approach (EC, 2013) where different actors work throughout 
during the whole process in order to better align both the process and outcomes with 
their needs and expectations.  

The project was based upon the following framing strategies:  

Triggers in communication: the Nazaré Wave was used as the communication trigger. This 
option was based upon the fact that this particular wave has recently became quite 
fashionable, appealing to the spirit of adventure of youngsters and thus revels to easily 
capture the attention of the target-audience: high-school students. 

Storytelling: short scientific animations where blend in “The Nazaré Wave” movie 
voice-over by high-school students. Students’ discourse and the movie were combined 
and used as the communication channels to support the narrative. This choice was based 
upon the fact films are seen as one of the media that easily captures the audience’s 
attention (e.g., Ismaili, 2015; Xhemaili, 2013) (Figure 18). 

Making audience a part of the process: a group of forty-six high-school students were 
challenged to actively contribute to the project, including performance takes in the “The 
Nazaré Wave” movie (Figure 19).

T h e  N a z a r é  W a v e  

The Nazaré Wave corresponds to an occasional, though predictable, sea state that is 
related with the occurrence of a gigantic wave at Norte beach, in the vicinity of and up to 
hundreds of meters of the Nazaré headland. Here, the submarine morphology is complex 
and dominated by the presence of the Nazaré submarine canyon that deeply incises the 
continental shelf. When incident waves correspond to long period Northwest and West 
swells, the particular geomorphological setting of the continental shelf strongly modifies 
the nearshore wave pattern (IH, 2016; Silva, 2014). This modification leads to an 
abnormal and localized increase of wave height in relation to the cumulative effects of 
shoaling, convergence and interference culminating in gigantic breakers when the deep-
water wave height is already large. 

As Nazaré Wave became a very popular subject in the media and social networks it 
has drawn the interest of society and in particular, of young students. The reason for 
such popularity is that the Nazaré Wave is considered to be the highest wave ever surfed 
according to Guinness World Records. Here, it is mentioned that on the 1st November 
2011, Garrett McNamara surfed a circa 24 m-high wave. Offshore conditions on that day 
were 5.3 m wave height, 13.8 s wave peak period and wave direction of 307° (Silva, 
2014). This ride has been filmed and for a certain time became viral in communication 
network.

As recognized by the teachers that participate in this project, from Escola Secundária de 
Gama Barros, and in literature movies can easily catch the learners’ interest and it can 
positively affect their motivation to learn. Taking the impact of films in capturing 
audiences, short scientific animations illustrating the physical processes affecting the 
Nazaré Wave (generation, propagation, refraction, shoaling, convergence, interference 
and breaking) and the influence of the Nazaré submarine canyon in modulating the local 
wave patterns (Silva, 2014) were merged into the “The Nazaré Wave” movie to get the 
science content of the message across.   

The participation of the audience in the project was materialized by the inputs of 
forty-six students of the 10th grade and three Science teachers of Escola Secundária de Gama 
Barros (Cacém, Portugal). Besides performing in “The Nazaré Wave” movie, students and 
schoolteachers helped scientists to build the concept of the project and commented 
several drafts of the scripts (written by scientists) assuring that the language was 
comprehensible and that the essential principles and fundamental concepts of waves 
reached the audience. They also and actively participated in the dissemination of the 
project, namely by participating in scientific meetings given interviews to regional 
newspapers and by more informally using social networks. 

T h e  m o v i e  

The principal output of project “The Nazaré Wave: a trigger for learning” is a 5-
minute movie entitled “The Nazaré Wave” available at the YouTube platform since 15th 
February 2016 (Figure 20).

As social media are being increasingly used in science outreach and engagement of 
scientists with the general public (McClain and Neeley, 2014) and considered a success 
factor in ensuring successful dissemination of projects’ outputs (Stiver et al., 2015) a 
website and a facebook page for the “The Nazaré Wave: a trigger for learning” project 
were created. The latter was a fundamental mechanism in the dissemination of “The 
Nazaré Wave” movie: it reached over 6.000 views in the first month of its release and in 
a three months time window, had been watched in more than 95 countries and was 
promoted or recommended in more than 30 communications platform (national and 
international; science and non-science related) (Figure 21).

Facebook revealed also to be an excellent mean to receive feedback from the 
audiences and in fostering engagement. The project has been receiving very good 
feedback from a varied suite of societal [sub]groups. Some examples of comments 
posted on-line are presented below. Moreover, Facebook also allows for students and 
professors to share posts thus boosting their active role in the project.

In science communication it is often necessary to capture the public’s attention to 
scientific contents. Results of the “The Nazaré Wave: a trigger for learning” project show 
that the triggers in communication can ease this task. The Nazaré Wave was an excellent 
trigger to capture students’ attention to science and highlighted the importance of 
scientific knowledge transfer between scientists and society (in a broad sense). 
Additionally to the theme itself, it was found that short scientific animation videos on 
basic wave dynamics performed very well as the communication channel re-enforcing the 
advantages of using movies to enhance student’s motivation and understanding. “The 
Nazaré Wave: a trigger for learning” revealed to be a highly successful outreach initiative 
and similar strategies adopted can be used in the development of other science 
communication projects.

5.2 Crowdsourcing  

Crowdsourcing has the objective of involving of a high number of people in the 
generation of large sets of data. Although still in its early stages of development, this 
mechanism presents a high potential on society engagement. Moreover, crowdsourcing 
can influence on the success of a wide range of projects (Stiver et al., 2015). In the 
framework of the present study the “Cascais Beach Photo Monitoring” project was 
designed and have been conducted since May 2015.  

5.2.1 The concept 

Crowdsourcing can be descried as an open call for voluntary assistance from a large 
group of individuals (Kalil and Wilkinson, 2015). Crowdsourcing benefits society by 
encouraging society to participate in the scientific process by collecting data and helping 
in advance scientific knowledge (Kalil and Wilkinson, 2015). Some initiatives under the 
Citizen Science framework have already been developed namely in the context of public 
participatory monitoring (e.g., Tulloch et al., 2013; Stojanovic and Ballingerv, 2009), and 
volunteered geographical information by the development of mapping tools and web 
applications (Leidig and Teeuw, 2015). Citizen Science is a broad term, covering a part of 
open science in which citizens can participate in the scientific research process in 
different possible ways: as observers, as funders, in identifying images or analyzing data, 
or providing data themselves (SCU, 2013).  

Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science are powerful approaches for engaging the public 
in the scientific process and in addressing societal needs. Multiple benefits of these 
approaches include increased knowledge, positive impact on the participants in terms of 
enhancing their [coastal] awareness, empowerment and improved communication 
between the actors involved, and better adherence to [coastal] regulations (Holdren, 
2015; Wagner, 2004).  

5.2.2 “Cascais Beach Photo Monitoring” project  

Beach photo monitoring consists on the systematic acquisition of photographs 
targeting the beach area. The Coastal Photo Monitoring project is an example of a 
crowdsourcing initiative, conducted in Australia by volunteers, since 2006, aiming at 
providing a visual record of changes of priority sites within the Southern Perth 
Metropolitan coastal zone (Perth Region NMR, 2016). Results available at the website of 
the CPM project depict morphological changes occurred in the study areas and are 
readily noticeable and perceived by people with different backgrounds (both scientists 
and non- scientists).

The CPM project and the “The Beaches of Cascais: past and present” exhibition (sub-
chapter 5.1.2) highlight the importance of using images (photographs) as the language to 
communicate beach dynamics. Based upon these initiatives, the Cascais Beach Photo 
Monitoring (CBPM) project was developed and has been conducted from May 2015 
onwards. This project aims to be a proof of concept approach designed to demonstrate 
the feasibility of systematic acquisition of photographs to support the development of a 
crowdsourcing tool targeting beach monitoring. The CBPM project was developed upon 
the mutual agreement between the Faculty of Sciences of University of Lisbon and the 
Municipal Council of Cascais, that it was interesting to establishing guidelines towards 
the development of a crowdsourcing tool helping supporting a beach photo monitoring 
programs while, at the same time, upstream public engagement on coastal issues. 

5 . 2 . 2 . 1  M o t i v a t i o n   

One key element in coastal zone management is correct understanding of coastal zone 
evolution. However, the evaluation of morphological changes of a coast, namely beaches, 
is a non-trivial task due to the complex and intrinsically non-steady nature of the coastal 
processes (Taborda and Silva, 2012). Beach monitoring, the continuous or periodic 
process of collecting and analyzing data to measure the dynamic of the beach (UNESCO, 
2006), should be see as an integral and continuing element of the coastal management 
agenda, because it provides to managers regular feedback on implementation and 
progress towards the attainment of environmental objectives. However, some 
monitoring programs fail due to lack of capacity to assure the continuity of data 
acquisition. In this context, crowdsourcing arises as a major opportunity in enhancing 
and accelerating scientific research through co-generation of data. For instance, 
volunteers can collect data over large areas and long periods of time, and sometimes 
increase the frequency of observations, in ways that coastal management agencies or 
research institutions may not be able to do, given geographic and resource constraints 
(Holdren, 2015). In addition, this author highlights that community-based monitoring led 
to improved links amongst the actors involved, a vital step towards sustainability. 

Different fields of knowledge are at present developing crowdsourcing platforms to 
support research and foster engagement among participants. In the program did you feel 
it? volunteers report experiences felt during earthquakes using a web platform of the U.S. 
Geological Survey, providing “a collection of citizen science data”. The National Oceanic 
And Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s mPING mobile application, allows for 
volunteers to submit weather-related observations, appealing that “We need your weather 
reports for our research!”.

In the scope of beach photomonitoring, the Photomon application, developed by the 
Northern Agricultural Catchments Council, was designed to support systematic 
acquisition and storage of photographs in order to improve the quality of data collected 
by environmental [beach] photo monitoring programs. Recently, in March 2016, the code 
of this application became publically available, and this allowed for its adoption in the 
scope of other beach monitoring programs.  

The above emphasizes the potential of beach photomonitoring initiatives supported 
by crowdsourcing and in upstream public engagement.  

5 . 2 . 2 . 2  P r o j e c t  d e v e l o p m e n t   

The development of the CBPM project encompasses four main tasks: 

Task #1: which implies a 1-year systematic acquisition of photographs targeting the 
beaches of Cascais (Portugal) (Figure 12) to test and validated photographs as a good 
mean to assess short- to medium-term morphological changes of the beach of Cascais.  

Task #2: the development of approaches to extract costal geoindicators from 
photographs.  

Task #3: the development of a smartphone application to support crowdsourcing 
beach photomonitoring.  

Task #4: the development of web-based platforms to archive and to allow access to 
acquired photographs and other outputs of the CBPM project.  

In the scope of the present thesis, efforts were performed targeting the 
implementation of Task #1 that has been conducted from May 2015 to July 2016 so far. 
Systematic acquisition of photographs targeting the eighteen beaches of Cascais (Figure 
12) was performed on a monthly basis. Two additional surveys were performed on 20th 
and 30th October 2015 to assess post-storm morphological changes. The methods and 
procedures adopted during the surveys were based on the works of Carapuço et al., 
2014b, DaSilva, 2012 and Silveira et al., 2012 and are the following:   

Photo monitoring points: a monitoring point was selected for the acquisition of each 
photograph. The establishment of the viewpoint network took into consideration 
accessibility and the field of view - a good perspective of the target area and, if possible, 
of the entire beach. In every field campaign, the objective was to acquire photographs 
from the same points and with the same field of view. Beside a standard photograph of 
each beach, a panoramic photograph (with elongated field of view) was also acquired.  

Equipment: a Nikon® D90 digital single-lens reflex camera equipped with a Nikon® 
18-200 mm vibration-reduction lens features 12.1-megapixel was used. The camera was 
set with automatic focus, and a focal length of 18 mm. For the acquisition of panoramic 
photographs, 8-megapixixel digital camera of an iPhone 5s was used.

Periodicity and stage of the tide: field surveys were taken at low tide on a monthly basis 
from May 2016 to July 2016 (as an example, Abano beach photographs are presented in 
Figure 22). In addition, after the 17th October 2015 storm that hit the Cascais coast, two 
additional surveys were carried out on October 20th and 30th (as an example, São Pedro 
beach photographs illustrating pre- and post-storm conditions are presented in Figure 
23). 

Archiving: after each campaign, photographs were named using a previously agreed 
code (P1: Abano to P18: Carcavelos), the name of the beach, and the date of the 
photograph (e.g., P1_abano_2015mai21.jpg). Photographs were also tagged with the 
name of the beach allowing constructing flexible and easy metadata that made the 
pictures easily searchable. 

Data availability: photographs are available in Flickr, an image and video hosting web 
platform. In addition, results from monthly surveys are also available in a University of 
Lisbon website: Beach Monitoring.

Results obtained so far in the scope of the CBPM project allow putting forward that 
images (photographs) are a valuable resource in beach monitoring as they can be 
considered a adequate “language” to communicate beach changes in a simple manner 
(Figure 24). Examples herein presented (Figure 22 and Figure 23) for the beaches of 
Cascais, revels that photographs illustrated both seasonal variations that took place at 
Abano as well as storm erosion and post-storm recovery that took place at São Pedro do 
Estoril. Moreover, the information portrayed by the image conveys additionally 
information useful to understand and evaluate major morphodynamic drivers, such as 
incident wave characteristics.  

Results achieved also highlight the potential of the CBPM project to support the 
widespread use of simple photogrammetric techniques can upgrade the acquired 
information from qualitative to quantitative allowing to extract costal indicators (Task 
#2) following the work of Carapuço et al., 2014.  

In addition, as beach monitoring will largely benefit from the involvement of 
volunteers in the enlargement of data sets which can be of vital importance in cases 
where coastal agencies are not be able to assure the longevity of coastal monitoring 
programs, crowdsourcing can be considered as a valuable resource in beach monitoring. 
Furthermore, crowdsourcing can, not only upstream public engagement on coastal 
issues, but also benefit from society’s local knowledge enhancing the value of the outputs 
coastal monitoring programs and further enriching the value of crowdsourcing as a 
mechanism to improve knowledge transfer (Figure 24) (stressing the importance of Task 
#3). 

Moreover, in moving forward the development and adoption of crowdsourcing tools 
(beach- or non-beach related), it should be underlined the need for easy access to the 
data collected and related-outputs. If society is willing to participate in crowdsourcing the 
data, information and knowledge generated should be open, and easy to, access. The 
development of web-based platforms (Task #4) arises as the simplest and low-cost 
solution to assure that these conditions are meet.

5.2.3 Conclusions  

Crowdsourcing covers a part of open science in which society can participate in the 
scientific research of the coastal zone by providing data. Further benefits of this 
approach include strengthening and reinforcing the links amongst all actors involved (see 
The Coastal Knowledge Triangle (Figure 1)): society benefits from having an active role in the 
coastal management framework, leading to empowerment; scientists, policy-makers and 
managers benefit from the [co]generation of data, increasing the longevity of monitoring 
programs enhancing management and scientific research.  

In the scope of beach monitoring, crowdsourcing is still in its early stages of 
development. However, existing initiatives as the Coastal Photo Monitoring (Perth 
Region NMR, 2013) and Photomon (NACC, 2014) are positive signs of change towards 
a wider adopting of beach monitoring supported in crowdsourcing tools. Both examples 
are photographs-related reinforcing the importance of images in a simple identification 
of beaches changes. Results of the CBPM project highlighted this same conclusion. 
Moreover, images are also considered a “universal language” being also very useful in 
communicating beach dynamics and evolution to different audiences. Altogether, these 
results suggest that scientists should support the development of image-related 
approaches to foster the use of crowdsourcing tools. It is expected that in the near future 
these tools can constitute a valuable complement to official (and traditional) coastal 
monitoring programs as they can provide high resolution (both in time and space) data at 
a very low cost-benefit ratio. 

Chapter 5.2 |Key messages 

v? Crowdsourcing can be a valuable mechanism the in scientific knowledge transfer as it 
encourage the participation of society in the scientific process.   

v? Crowdsourcing can strengthen and reinforce the links amongst the actors’ involved, 
which can encompass all key coastal actors identified in The Coastal Knowledge Triangle 
(Figure 1). 

v? Crowdsourcing can have a major positive impact in supporting beach photo monitoring 
programs while, at the same time, upstream public engagement on coastal issues. 
Moreover, crowdsourcing can not only increasing the frequency of observations, but also 
contributing to reducing costs associated with coastal monitoring. 

v? Preliminary results from “Cascais Beach Photo Monitoring” emphasize that photographs 
are a valuable resource in beach monitoring as they easily provide a reliable qualitative 
identification of beach changes.

5.3 Management-oriented tools 

The coastal management community has specific needs of information that is required 
to address specific management issues (e.g., Goldsmith et al., 2015; Carapuço et al., 2013b; 
van Koningsveld et al., 2005). This principle drives the development of management-
oriented tools as a mechanism to improve scientific knowledge transfer. More than 
providing access to coastal data, management-oriented tools aim to turn data into helpful 
and readily usable information. In this chapter “Wave Transformation Matrices” are 
presented as a management-oriented tool for computing site-specific nearshore wave 
characteristics. 

5.3.1 The concept 

Management-oriented tools are designed to support the generation of specific 
information directly useful to policy-makers and managers. The largest compilation of 
coastal management-oriented tools is “The Digital Coast” (NOAA, 2016) a web platform 
“developed to meet the unique needs of the coastal management community”. This 
platform provides access to a significant number of science-based GIS (Geographic 
Information System) tools capable of generating spatial information targeting different 
coastal issues. Available tools include web applications to compute the rate of shoreline 
change, and to create maps of potential ecological, social, and economic impacts from 
rising seas and changing climate. Despite any coastal actor can use these tools their 
purpose is to directly support coastal management. 

5.3.2 “Wave Transformation Matrices” 

The use of wave numerical models constitutes an eminently cost-effective, efficient, 
and rational approach to generating the desired estimates of wave parameters for a 
specific end (Panchang et al., 1999). However, the process of transforming several 
thousands of individual wave recordings from deep-water to the nearshore can be a 
weighty and time-consuming procedure. Wave transformation matrices (WTM) 
constitute a more efficient method to achieve similar objectives, as they are able to 
produce forecast products for the oceanographic parameters and make them timely 
available.  

5 . 3 . 2 . 1  D e f i n i t i o n  a n d  g o a l   

Delivering accurate nearshore wave data and information to coastal managers is of 
paramount importance in coastal zone management, namely to support the development 
and routine operation of beach activities, water sports and warning systems for coastal 
storms.  



Mechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation 

 - 80 -  

However, in most cases, wave data and information is only accessible as 1) deep-water 
wave data sets requiring further processing to account for wave transformation during 
propagation and breaking, 2) refraction and diffraction diagrams picturing transformation 
of a limited number of previously selected wave conditions, and 3) extensive lists of 
numbers on diverse wave attributes computed from increasingly complex numerical 
models. These “formats” are very difficult (if not impossible) to use by managers in their 
daily activities. Moreover, often, the physical processes and uncertainty involved in 
processing wave data from the offshore to the coast are frequently hindered. This may 
lead to a decrease of trust in scientific results, which can be triggered, for example, by 
cases where forecasts depart from observations (Carapuço et al., 2014d).  

A WTM is a look-up table prepared to quickly deliver elementary nearshore wave 
parameters (Deltares, 2016). It consists of graphical solutions for computing site-specific 
nearshore wave characteristics, yielding results at an accuracy level compatible with most 
of the needs related with management of the coastal area and risks. Here, the 
performance of different modeling strategies considering standard bi-dimensional (2D) 
WTM, and three-dimensional (3D) WTM, is presented. The approach developed in this 
work was applied to the characterization of nearshore wave regime for a sector of the 
western Portuguese coast. 

5 . 3 . 2 . 2  P h y s i c a l  b a c k g r o u n d  

As waves propagate from deep to shallow waters, they experience changes in height 
and direction of travel due to the uneven bathymetry and coastal sheltering (as illustrated 
in the movie “The Nazaré Wave”, sub-chapter 5.1.3.2). The primary processes affecting 
wave propagation are shoaling, refraction and diffraction (CERC, 2002). Wave shoaling 
is the change in wave height when they enter shallower water. Wave refraction is the 
bending of the wave crest due primarily to depth changes and can result in convergence 
or divergence of the wave energy. Diffraction of waves is a phenomenon in which energy 
is transferred laterally along the wave crest. As waves move into shoaling water they 
eventually become unstable and break. Wave breaking is the prominent method of wave 
energy dissipation but waves also lose energy due to bottom friction when they propagate 
over intermediate and shallow waters (FEMA, 2005). Refraction, shoaling and diffraction 
are phenomena that have been approached and studied as linear problems and are 
resolved in the same manner by numerical models (Fassardi, 2004).

T h e  s t a n d a r d  a p p r o a c h  t o  W T M   

In standard approach to WTM the nearshore wave height (H) at a specific depth is 
assumed to be linearly proportional to the deep-water wave height (H0) (Fassardi, 2004). 
This is an important consideration because it assumes that the wave transformation 
process is independent from H0 and thus allows to estimate H considering only the deep-
water wave period (T0) and deep-water wave direction (Dir0). Using this approach, a wave 
height transformation coefficient (WTCH) can be defined by the ratio between H and H0 
(Fassardi, 2004):  

WTCH = H/H0  (equation 1) 

This coefficient can be estimated by the product of the shoaling (Ks) and refraction 
(Kr) coefficients, which depend only on T0 and Dir0: 

WTCH = f (T0, Dir0) = Ks × Kr (equation 2) 

Nearshore wave direction (Dir) can be estimated by a similar processes as it also 
depends on T0 and Dir0:  

Dir = f (T0, Dir0) (equation 3) 

As in linear wave theory the wave period (T) remains unchanged during propagation, 
the nearshore wave period equal the deep-water wave period (T0): 

T = T0 (equation 4) 

From the above it is possible to conclude that all relevant nearshore wave parameters 
can be estimated using only two independent variables: T0 and Dir0. This approach 
supports the use of 2D WTM (a 2D matrix for wave height - WTMH and a 2D matrix for 
direction - WTMDir) to transfer deep-water wave conditions to the nearshore (Figure 25).

The standard approach to WTM (described above) is valid for both monochromatic 
and polychromatic waves. In the case of polychromatic waves, the sea state is described 
using standard wave parameters (e.g., significant wave height (Hs), peak period (Tp) and 
mean wave direction (Dir)). In this case, the WTMH and WTMDir must be estimated using 
a spectral wave model. In addition, when waves are polychromatic significant changes in 
wave period may occur such as when propagating in sheltered coastal sections or areas of 
convergence/divergence. In these cases, the use of equation 4 can lead to significant errors 
and a wave transformation matrix for period (WTMT) should be considered. 

 

a) 2D WTMT 

Figure 26. Bi-dimensional wave transformation matrix for period: 2D WTMT. 

Furthermore, in the standard approach H is considered linear dependent of H0. In 
shallow water, this assumption can lead to relative large errors in cases where breaking 
and bottom friction are important. Under these circumstances, H0 should be considered 
explicitly in the transformation matrix. Three-dimensional WTM (3D WTM) are herein 
presented to address this issue, as they explicitly consider wave height as a third 
independent variable (Figure 27 a) to c)).

Figure 28. Methodological approach for wave propagation using the wave-by-wave (left panel) 
and the WTM (right panel) approaches.  

 

The WTM approach involves a two-step procedure: 1) building the WTM, and 2) 
wave transformation from deep-waters to nearshore through the use of this matrix 
(Figure 28). The first phase of building the WTM implies creating a matrix covering the 
range of most likely, or relevant, periods and directions (Figure 28, 1B) (departing from 
the deep-water wave time series (Figure 28, 1A)). In the case of a 3D WTM, the matrix 
also covers the range of most likely values of deep-water wave height. Then, all possible 
pairs of T0 and Dir0 (for 2D WTM) are computed to create a synthetic deep-water time 
series with wave parameters (Figure 28, 1C). In the case of 3D WTM, triples 
combinations also considered H0. A wave propagation model then runs for each 
condition defined in the synthetic wave time series (Figure 28, 1D and Figure 29), creating 
a synthetic nearshore wave time series (Figure 28, 1E) and allowing assembling the 
nearshore WTM (Figure 28, 1F) for height (WTMH), direction (WTMDir), and period 
(WTMT).

the target location. The figure depicts an example for Dir0=330º and T0=12s. 

The second phase implies wave transformation from deep-waters (Figure 28, 2A) to 
nearshore (Figure 28, 2C) by using the WTM (Figure 28, 2B). Wave transformation 
values are bilinearly interpolated from the WTM nodes. An example of a WTMH and its 
use is presented in Figure 30.  

 

Figure 30. Example of using a WTMH for two offshore wave conditions. The figure depicts an 
exercise that coastal managers, with no specific technical skills, can perform to convert two 
scenarios of wave conditions from deep-waters to nearshore.  

From the above, it is clear that WTM approach is intrinsically more complex than the 
conventional wave-by-wave approach. However, the computational effort required to 
compute calculation of a WTM is almost independent of the size of the deep-water time 
series, whereas in the wave-by-wave approach computational effort is proportional to 
length of the time series (Figure 31). In addition, despite building the WTM requires a 
certain amount of time, which depends on the resolution of the WTM, this is a one-time 
action, and correspond to an effort done by scientists. Therefore, for coastal managers 
WTM can be considered as a ready-to-use solution.

In this study, the assembly of WTM was based on the SWAN (acronym for 
Simulation WAves Nearshore, Booji et al., 1999) wave propagation model (Booji et al., 
1999), version 40.85, developed by the Delft University of Technology. This phase-
averaging (or spectral) wave model was designed to obtain realistic estimates of wave 
parameters in coastal areas and, as it is very flexible, it can be used in a wide range of 
coastal applications at a wide range of spatial scales.  SWAN performs effectively and 
that is why it was denoted as the “…community wave model” (Rusu, 2011). Several 
application of the SWAN model along the western coast of Portugal are described in the 
literature, namely, in thesis, scientific papers and technical reports (e.g., Reis et al., 2013; 
Rusu, 2011; Rusu et al., 2011; Neves et al., 2010; Silva, 2009; Capitão et al., 2009).  

The SWAN model was forced along its open boundaries using wave time series 
parameters obtanied a 57-year hindcast (1953 to 2009) obtain by Dodet et al. (2010). Data 
are available at http://disepla.fc.ul.pt/Micore/WaveDownload.html. The model run in 
stationary mode, assuming that the JONSWAP spectrum adequately represented the 
spectrum of ocean waves in all simulations. It was also assumed that the energy 
dissipation due to bottom friction is adequately represented by the formulation proposed 
by Madsen et al. (1998, in SWAN Team, 2011) (friction coefficient equal to 0.05) and 
ignoring the nonlinear wave-wave interactions (triads and quadruplets). A constant tide 
level equal to mean sea level was considered. The breaking coefficient followed SWAN 
default value of 0.78. The model ran in MATLAB® environment through the SwanAuto 
toolbox developed by the Coastal Processes team of the Geology Department of the 
Faculty of Sciences of Lisbon University.

Validation implies determining whether the simulation model is an accurate 
representation of the real system (Kleijnen, 1998) and comparison with a real system is 
considered the most reliable and preferred way to validate a simulation model (Etessami 
and Gilmore, 1998). Nevertheless, in the present work, the performance of WTM in 
simulating wave propagation was validated by two methods: absolute performance by the 
comparison of the simulated data with 1) field data (real system), and 2) relative 
performance by the simulated data acquired through a wave-to-wave modeling strategy.  

F i e l d  d a t a  

Validation of wave parameters yielded by WTM was based on the comparison of HS, 
Tp and Dir computed by the SWAN model, and data acquired by equipment’s installed 
offshore in two different locations (Figure 32). 

• An acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) deployed at 28 m depth offshore 
Almagreira beach by the IH (data from 29 October 2009 to 11 October 2011) 
available at Ribeiro (2013) (Point VAL1: location: X = -101002; Y = -29128 ETRS89 
PT-TM06);  

• The directional wave buoy moored at the depth of 30 m at the edge of the Tagus 
ebb delta maintained by the Lisbon Port Authority (data between 31 July 2005 and 31 
December 2008) (Point VAL2: location: X = -109094; Y = -115320 ETRS89 PT-
TM06). 

Boundary conditions imposed to the model consisted of two wave time series of 
integral parameters for the same location in the open sea (lat: 39.31ºN, long: 9.38ºW, 
2000 m depth) obtained from two different sources: 

• An oceanographic buoy installed by the IH under the MONItoring the Nazaré 
CANyon (MONICAN) project; and, 

• Hindcast data provided by the National Data Buoy Center of the National Oceanic 
And Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that were interpolated to that location. 
This procedure aim to test if the influence of different boundary conditions exceeds 
the differences obtained using different wave transformation strategies (WTM vs. 
wave-by-wave).   

In the simulations, wave periods ranging from 5 to 21s and directions from 180º to 
360º, and different combinations of time- and direction-steps were tested (Table 5). For 
3D WTM wave heights ranged from 1 to 13m, every 4m. Simulations settings and 
corresponding validation designations are presented in Table 9. Statistical error 
parameters (bias, root mean square error (RMSE), scatter index (SI) and Pearson 
correlation coefficient (R)) for the different 24 validation settings were computed.

Results displayed in Table 7 and in Table 8 show that no significant differences when 
contrasting resolutions for 2D WTM and 3D WTM were found. In fact, the major 
difference found was in relation to the time to build the matrices, which ranged from 4 to 
449 minutes. Nevertheless, it was found that very low resolutions WTM are, in general, 
related with the worst performances. As an example, RMSE for HS ranges from 0.28m 
(V2, V6 and V10) to 0.52m (V23), for Tp ranges from 1.60s (V13) to 2.06s (V4, V8 and 
V12), and for Dir ranges from 7.11º (V21) to 21.67º (V12).

According to the results obtained, the factor that seems to most affect the quality of 
the outputs is the source of the offshore wave data, with better performances with 
MONICAN (measured) data than NOAA (hindcast) data as depicted in Figure 33.

In order to test the performance of WTMT, simulations of V1 to V4 were reiterate 
considering the period unchanged (T = T0). Results presented in Table 9 show smaller 
RMSE when T ? T0. In this sequence, it is recommended the adoption of WTMT  in areas 
where the wave period is more likely to change.

From the results obtained, it is possible to conclude that:  

• WTM are excellent tools to simulate effects of wave propagation, and in predicting 
changes in wave parameters; 

• 2D WTM have a very good performance in the characterization of nearshore wave 
regime providing good results in a simpler and faster manner (Table 7); 

• 3D WTMH should be used in target-areas where wave breaking or where bottom 
friction leads to significant energy dissipation seaward of the simulation point (Table 
8);  

• 2D WTMT is recommended in sheltered or strong refraction areas where the wave 
period is more likely to change (Table 9); 

• The nature of offshore wave data (hindcast vs. measured) is more relevant than the 
resolution adopted in the WTM, in determining the quality of the results (Figure 33).

Validation of wave parameters yielded by WTM was based on the comparison of Hs, 
Tp and Dir computed by the SWAN model, and the results of a wave-to-wave simulation 
exercise by Silveira et al. (2013). In this assessment bias, RMSE, SI and R for validations 
V3, V4, V15 and V16 (corresponding to the best 2D WTM and 3D WTM performance 
for hindcast forcing using NOAA data) were computed. The results of the comparison 
between the WTM approach and wave-by-wave modeling strategy are presented in Table 
10.

Results show that the performance of the WTM is excellent for the propagation of 
waves when comparing with the wave-by-wave strategy. Dir, HS and Tp present similar 
(sometimes lower) RMSE in the 2D WTM strategy in comparison with the wave-to-wave 
strategy. Best results for Tp were obtained using 3D WTM strategy. Therefore, 
considering both 2D and 3D WTM vs. the wave-by-wave, WTM present better results in 
wave propagation. However, 2D WTM have to be used carefully in areas with significant 
bottom friction or wave breaking in line with the conclusions above mentioned for 
validation with field data (5.3.2.4 Validation).  

Figure 34 depicts a plot of nearshore Hs for a nearshore simulation point computed 
using wave-by-wave vs. 2D and 3D WMT strategies. These results put in evidence that 
for HS0&gt;5m the 2D WTMH overestimated HS because 2D WMT fail to adequately 
reproduce wave breaking effects over wave height. Thus, under this circumstance, the 
use of 3D WTMH should be considered.

Validation procedures indicate that WTM is an excellent strategy for wave 
propagation, allowing accurate prediction of nearshore wave parameters and regime. In 
this subchapter, characterization of the nearshore wave regime is performed for a specific 
coastal sector using the 2D WTM approach. This option relied upon the fact that 2D 
WTM’s performed very well in the characterization of the wave regime for modal 
conditions and requires smaller computational times.

The study area is located in the western Portuguese coast (Figure 32) and encompasses 
the coastal ribbon between Pedras Negras beach and cape Espichel. This sector is 
exposed to an offshore wave regime generated far in the North Atlantic, and dominated 
by swell, and overlapped by waves generated by local winds (sea). North of Tagus river, 
the coast is predominantly rocky, and characterized by small embayed beaches, with 
different exposure to the incident waves. South of Tagus, the study area corresponds to a 
continuous sand strip that develops between the cliffs of cape Espichel and Tagus 
estuary, in the north.    

Eleven target-areas were selected for the characterization of the nearshore wave 
regime (Figure 32; see also Annex “Wave Transformation Matrices”, Table A2), which are 
representative of coastal sections with different exposure to the incident waves, 
contrasting morphological setting and different sedimentary content. 31 target-points at 
10 m depth were considered with the exception of target-point TM2 defined at 5 m 
depth (see Annex “Wave Transformation Matrices”, Table A2).

In the numerical simulations wave spectrum was segmented in 22 classes of frequency 
(5 to 20 s) and 36 directional classes (180º to 360º and 0º to 20º).  

The computational domain was divided into grids, one regional and 13 nested, to 
improve accuracy and enhance computational effort and time (Figure 32). Grid 
characteristics used in the wave propagation model are presented in Annex “Wave 
Transformation Matrices” (Table A1).  

Further information about the SWAN propagation model and the bathymetric data 
used are described in sub-chapter 5.3.2.3 Methodological approach.

contrast, beaches located in sheltered environments present the lowest values of HsMean, 
as in the case of Tamariz.

Results obtained for 2D WTMH in all simulations points are presented in Annex 
“Wave Transformation Matrices (Figure A1 to A13)”. Nevertheless, a number of 2D WTMH 
are herein presented aiming at illustrate paradigmatic situations: 

• Paredes de Vitória beach: the second northernmost beach of the study site with the 
highest HsMean of all the simulated points (Figure 36). This can be explained 
because Paredes de Vitória is highly exposed to offshore waves. In addition, the 
linear development of the beach and coast explains the similarity of all WTM for 
all simulations points.  

• Nazaré beach: an embayed beach at the head of the Nazaré submarine canyon 
(Figure 37). The WTM yield different nearshore patterns along the same beach area 
and is evident that the northernmost simulate point (PNZ1) corresponds to the 
most sheltered beach ribbon. This result is in agreement with those obtained by 
Silveira et al. (2016). 

• Tamariz beach: lowest Hsmean of all the simulated points (Figure 38). WTM reveal 
lower HsMean due to coastal sheltering.

Results for this case study allow concluding that not only WTM are reliable in the 
characterization of the nearshore wave regime but also in varied nearshore and coastal 
settings. They are also are very helpful in providing visualization of the changes 
experimented by waves when propagating in progressively shallow water towards a 
specific coastal location.  

5 . 3 . 2 . 6  S e t t i n g  a n  a g e n d a  f o r  f u t u r e  r e s e a r c h   

The availability of reliable data concerning the nearshore wave regime is fundamental 
in coastal zone planning and management. Numerical models of waves propagation are 
able to produce hindcast and forecast products describing waves parameters. They can 
make available in a useful time scales the oceanographic data necessary to support 
decision-making process.  

In this context, WTM revealed to be an excellent approach to deliver nearshore wave 
data. Results obtained allow concluding that 1) 2D WTM have a very good performance 
in the characterization of nearshore wave regime providing good results in a simpler and 
faster manner, 2) 3D WTMH should be used in target-areas where wave breaking or 
where bottom friction leads to significant energy dissipation seaward of the simulation 
point and 3) 2D WTMT should be used under circumstances where the wave period is 
likely to change, such as sheltered coastal stretches or areas with strong refraction. The 
findings herein presented also allowed to conclude that the WTM 1) imply significantly 
smaller computational and interpretation effort and time, in comparison with a 
conventional wave-by-wave modeling strategy, and 2) are very helpful in the visualization 
of the physical processes related with waves propagation.  

In this sense, WTM offer a high potential as a management-tool as their adoption 
allows for coastal managers (and other users) to simulate wave conditions for specific 
target-area in a simple and intuitive manner. An offshore wave forecast with an adequate 
WTM allows predicting wave conditions or interpret the wave regime at a certain beach, 
by any WTM-user, as no specific technical skills are required. Moreover, WTM allow 
users to acknowledge the wave transformation processes and inform on uncertainty 
involved in processing wave data from the deep-waters to nearshore.  

Future works should consider optimizing the potential of WTM by investing in the 
development of friendlier user-interfaces. As WTM approach implies smaller 
computational time (in comparison with a conventional wave-by-wave modeling strategy) 
it makes WTM approach suitable for the development of website and smartphone 
applications. These developments can set the agenda for future research (Figure 39).

5.3.3 Conclusions 

Management-oriented tools aim to turn science-based data into helpful information 
directly useful to policy-makers and managers. They constitute a major opportunity to 
foster scientific knowledge integration in decision-making, acting as catalyzers in the 
science-management interface. In fact, some of these tools can even be useful to other 
coastal actors. In agreement with this, the tool presented in this sub-chapter, WTM, 
besides being useful for coastal managers, are also suitable to address the needs of 
information of sub-groups of society with varied interests in the coastal zone (e.g., 
surfers, fishermen). Management-oriented tools may also have a role in allowing users to 
be informed on physical processes acting upon the coast and acknowledge uncertainty. 
The latter issue is of major importance in foster engagement among coastal actors as it is 
grounded in the principle of the “best available knowledge”, where scientists assume the 
existence of changes and limitations in scientific knowledge and understanding. 

Chapter 5.3 |Key messages 

v? Management-oriented tools are designed to support the generation of specific 
information directly useful to policy-makers and managers: more than providing access to 
coastal data, management-oriented aim to turn data into helpful information. 

v? WTM are management-oriented tools that allow computing reliable and timely 
information concerning the nearshore wave regime or particular state of the sea. This 
information is of vital importance in coastal zone management.  

v? WTM allow users to acknowledge physical processes upstreaming their understanding on 
the coastal system and of uncertainty. The latter issue, combined with the principle of the 
“best available knowledge”, is of major importance in building engagement among coastal 
actors.  

v? Future work such consider to optimize the potential of WTM by the development of 
friendlier user-interfaces: website or smartphone applications can set the agenda for 
future research.

5.4 Co-production 

Co-production emerged in social sciences in the 1970’s. The idea was first articulated 
by Elinor Ostrom (2009 Nobel prize winner for economics) (Boyle and Michael, 2009) 
who, in 1996 (Ostrom, 1996), defined co-production as a “…process through which 
inputs from individuals who are not in the same organization are transformed into goods 
and services”. The concept has been evolving and, in 2011, Armitage et al. have 
(re)defined co-production “as the collaborative process among [coastal] actors bringing a 
plurality of knowledge types together to address a specific problem, aiming at building an 
integrated solution for that problem”.  

In the scope of the present study, co-production is represented by the “CIS - Coastal 
Information System for the municipality of Cascais” project, co-designed in close 
collaboration with technicians from this municipality aiming the establishment of a 
coastal monitoring program targeting Cascais’ beaches.  

5.4.1 The concept 

Co-production is often described as a process where people “contribute to” and 
“collaborate in” the generation of the outputs. Despite the lack of agreement of a 
“universal” definition (Boyle and Harris, 2009) five core elements of co-production can 
be identified according to Heaton et al. (2016): (1) all participants are regarded as active 
parties and not merely passive subjects or recipients of outputs; (2) there is greater 
equality in the relations between co-production participants, with outputs becoming 
more user-driven, and users’ knowledge and experience being valued on an equal basis; 
(3) working together allows for achieving more (and better) outcomes than working 
apart; (4) continued participation of parties involved transforms the ways in which 
outputs are designed and delivered; this helps in  developing the capacity for users’ to 
identify and present their needs of information; and (5) participation in co-production 
should be encouraged and facilitated by networks and organizations that support their 
involvement - nevertheless, it is recognized that it is people, not systems, who create 
change (Heaton et al., 2016). 

From the above, it is possible to conclude that co-production contains intrinsic 
benefits for those involved, creating the possibility for coastal actors to share their 
knowledge and motivations and to shape consensual or best-compromise solutions 
around their needs. LARCI (2010) stated that co-production fosters mutual trust and 
communication, generates reciprocal and mutual benefits, and alters attitudes.  In recent 
years, co-production has also been linked to describe the growing engagement of policy-
makers and managers in driven research motivated to solve societal problems (Martin, 
2010; Nutley, 2010).

5.4.2 “Coastal Information System for the municipality of Cascais” project 

The “Coastal Information System for the municipality of Cascais” project (designated 
by CIS project from this point forward) emerged with the objective of designing a 
roadmap towards the implementation of a coastal monitoring program targeting the 
beaches of Cascais. This program addresses specific needs of the managers of this 
municipality, based upon de implementation of an indicator-based coastal monitoring 
program.  

The trigger for this collaboration was the positive experience and high levels of 
engagement achieved under the framework of the outreach initiative “The Beaches of 
Cascais: past and present” (see chapter 5.1.2. The Beaches of Cascais: past and present).   

5 . 4 . 2 . 1  M o t i v a t i o n  

The coastal zone of Cascais is characterized by beaches, cliffs and sand dunes that 
play an important role as environmental, economical and social values of this 
municipality. Beaches, in particular, are a major asset of Cascais and a key driver of local 
economy. Acknowledging their importance, the municipality of Cascais aims to establish 
a monitoring program to raise the present-day level of understanding of beaches change 
and evolution at seasonal to long-term time scales. Beside the data and science involved 
the program also aims to support the definition of measures aiming at beach 
conservation. Actually, projects of beach changes under scenarios of climate change and 
sea level rise indicate that a significant reduction in the beach area of all Cascais beaches 
is expectable if no conservation actions are taken (Taborda and Ribeiro, 2015). 
Furthermore, it is an ambition of those who participate in the design of the CIS project 
to foster communication of results of the monitoring program in a systematic manner. 
The goal is to make the CIS project a linkage initiative amongst the different coastal 
actors contributing to raise their engagement in coastal issues.  

5 . 4 . 2 . 2  A p p r o a c h  

To support the development of a monitoring program targeting Cascais coastline, the 
“Frame of Reference” approach was adopted aiming to structure the interaction of 
scientists, and policy-makers and coastal managers in application-oriented knowledge 
development according to van Koningsveld (2003). Within this approach, the starting 
point for knowledge development is to get the big picture of the information and 
knowledge needed by policy-makers and coastal managers. In addition, a key element is 
the definition of “fit-for-purpose” indicators.  

 

 



Mechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation 

 - 103 -  

According to van Koningsveld (2003) the “Frame of Reference” is potentially useful 
in any situation where miscommunication arises in interaction between interdependent 
coastal actors, with different states of knowledge, working on different parts of the same 
overall problem.  

“Frame of Reference” is represented in Figure 40 and involves the six key-steps: 

• Strategic objective: that expresses the long-term management vision and policy;  

• Operational objective(s): that describes how the strategic objective will be achieved in a 
four stage process:  

• Quantitative state concept: a means of quantifying the problem in hand. The 
application of indicators is relevant at this stage of the process; 

• Benchmarking process: a means of assessing whether or not action is required. At this 
stage indicators are compared to threshold values; 

• Intervention procedure: defines in detail what action is required if the benchmark 
values are exceeded; 

• Evaluation procedure: assesses the impact of the action taken. If the action has not 
been successful it may be necessary to revise the strategic/operational objectives 
and hence the feedback loops indicated in Figure 40. 

 

 

Figure 40. The “Frame of Reference” postulated by van Koningsveld (2003). 

The “Frame of Reference” has been previously applied under the scope of a 
Portuguese project Consultoria para a Criação e Implementação de um Sistema de Monitorização do 
Litoral abrangido pela área de jurisdição da ARH do Tejo (Carapuço et al., 2013c) as well as in 
several European projects, namely, CoastView (Davidson et al., 2007; van Koningsveld et 
al., 2007), Conscience (Marchand, 2010) and Morphological Impacts and COastal Risks 
induced by Extreme storm events (Micore) (Ciavola et al., 2011). 



Mechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation 

 - 104 -  

In the framework of the CIS project, the strategic objective for Cascais municipality was 
identified as sustainability (in a broad sense), from which coastal sustainability and 
sustainable tourism arise as main concerns. The priority operational objective is the definition 
of beaches width accounting for variations at short- (tide level), medium- (seasonality) 
and long-term (sea-level rise) time scales. This objective was triggered by the need to 
establish management strategies attending to two particular situations: 1) minimizing 
conflict, during bathing season, between beach users and concessionaires due to 
competing interests in the use of the (available) beach area; 2) assessing the impact of sea 
level rise and the predicted reduction in beach area (Taborda and Ribeiro, 2015; PECAC, 
2010). The coastal geoindicator selected as most relevant support quantitative state concept 
was identified as beach width, which implicitly implies the determination of other two 
geoindicators: coastline and shoreline positions (see Table 3 in Chapter 4. Coastal indicators: 
a common language).  

As suggested in the literature (van Rijin, 2010; van Koningsveld, 2003), and within the 
spirit of co-production, selection of the indicator “beach width” reflects the input from 
both coastal managers and scientists. The importance of their involvement is that the 
former are able to assess what information will be of most value to the management, 
while the latter can determine what and when might be possible to measure based on 
existing or potential data and technology and how the scientific understanding of the data 
set may contribute to fulfill management or conservation needs. Indicators assume the 
role of the “common” language (see Chapter 4. Coastal indicators: a common language) 
between the different parties as they are comprehensible to all parties involved while, 
simultaneously, assure rigorous reporting (Figure 41). 

 

Figure 41. “CIS – Coastal Information System”: project’s audience and language, channel of 
communication and mechanism adopted to get the message across and reach the audience. 

CIS project will also allow identifying the best methodologies to monitor the changes 
in the width of the beaches of Cascais. Results from the project “Cascais Beach Photo 
Monitoring” (see 5.2.2. “Cascais Beach Photo Monitoring” project) will be a contribution in 
this direction by investigating the value of systematic acquisition of photographs to 
characterize the changes in the area of the beaches of Cascais. Implementation of CIS 
project will further allow the establishment of the following steps of the “Frame of 
Reference” contributing to the establishment of threshold values to support the 
definition of coastal interventions, and the assessment of the impact of those 
interventions.

At present time, Cascais municipality conducts small-scale and localized sand shifting 
operations amongst beaches aiming at solving problems related with the variations of 
beach width during beach session. However, these operations are performed on an ad hoc 
basis and do not benefit from scientific understanding of the sedimentary budget.  

5 . 4 . 2 . 3  R o a d m a p  o f  t h e  C I S  p r o j e c t  

The roadmap presented in Figure 42 aims to provide a chronological overview of the 
four key-activities of the CIS project: 

Design of the monitoring program: includes the establishment of key-areas (i.e., beaches of 
Cascais) and key-issues (i.e., variations in beaches width) according to the needs of 
information of managers from Cascais municipality. Still to be solved the most efficient 
techniques for data acquisition (e.g., photo and video monitoring, cross-shore profile and 
topographic surveys) and data processing with may not be the same in all beaches. This 
step considers the evaluation of the resources available in Cascais municipality namely in 
terms of human resources, equipment and existing data sets, namely those available at 
Geo Cascais platform as well as the development of crowdsourcing initiatives. The goal 
is to optimize resources and increases [chances of] the longevity of the monitoring 
program.  Crowdsourcing have the additional benefit of upstream society engagement in 
coastal issues.  

Implementation of the monitoring program and skill development: includes putting into 
operation the routines for data acquisition, processing and making data and information 
available to all key coastal actors as well as training of technicians of the municipality of 
Cascais 

Communication plan: includes the presentation of the project and its results to different 
audiences, by the development of outreach activities and “get-together” initiatives 
(workshops, conferences seminars). In addition to crowdsourcing, the implementation of 
the communication plan will further promote society engagement in coastal issues. 

 

Figure 42. Roadmap towards the implementation of the CIS project. 

Like other stages of the CIS project, this roadmap was co-produced with managers, 
technics and staff from Cascais Municipality.  This option can make the difference in 
shifting the balance of responsibilities and resources, transforming the dynamics between 
participants and shortening the leap to the implementation of the CIS project.

5.4.3 Conclusions  

Co-production is a collaborative process among [coastal] actors that take place in 
“middle ground”. Co-production bridges a plurality of knowledge types together to 
address a specific problem and makes the solution for that problem to be more efficient, 
more effective and more responsive to the needs of coastal actors. The CSI project was 
designed using a co-production approach involving scientists and managers and 
technicians from Cascais municipality with the objective of establishing a roadmap 
towards the implementation of a coastal monitoring program targeting the beaches of 
this municipality. Despite the design of the project having been more time-consuming 
that under typical circumstances (i.e., when projects are designed [almost] exclusively by 
scientists), the output is much more likely to address the managers’ needs of information, 
to optimizing resources and to involve the non-scientists communities. This can 
increases the changes of implementation and success of the CIS project. It is worth to 
mention that the positive experience of the outreach initiative “The Beaches of Cascais: 
past and present” (see chapter 5.1.2. The Beaches of Cascais: past and present) enabled the 
conditions that facilitated the adoption of a co-production strategy for the CIS project. 
This highlights the importance of outreach in building higher levels of engagement 
among coastal actors, namely in enabling conditions for co-production.

6. A conceptual model for successful 
knowledge transfer 

[This subchapter is based on: Carapuço, M.M., Taborda, R., Andrade, C., de Jonge, V.N. 2016a. Coping with coastal 
change: from scientific knowledge to implementation (Submitted)] 

It is widely acknowledged that to promote the integration of science in the decision-
making process “a one size fits all” approach will not work (Bonne et al., 2014). In this 
work, four mechanisms for transferring scientific knowledge were identified: outreach, 
crowdsourcing, management-oriented tools and co-production. The selection of the 
more adequate mechanism will depend both on audience’s engagement and aspired 
feedback. The conceptual model depicted in Figure 43 aims to guide scientists in this 
selection.  

 

 
 

Figure 43. A conceptual model to guide scientists (on the left) in the selection of the best 
mechanism to transfer scientific knowledge to other key coastal actors (on the right). Four 
mechanisms for transferring scientific knowledge can be adopted: co-production, management-
oriented tools, crowdsourcing and outreach. Each mechanism requires a different effort in 
framing by scientists, and its adoption is constrained by the level of engagement of the audience. 
This conceptual model highlights that in order to adopt higher-level mechanisms (e.g., co-
production) it is necessary to assure high levels of engagement; when these conditions are not 
met is necessary to previously implement lower-level mechanisms, fostering engagement. 

 



A conceptual model for success knowledge transfer 

 - 109 -  

Communication is only effective if both scientific and non-scientific actors are willing 
to converge and take the necessary steps to meet at some point of the communication 
process, which is conceptualized by the “meeting line” depicted in Figure 43 by the solid 
oblique line. This bridging effort can be approached from both sides in a proportion that 
will depend on the mechanism adopted (depicted in Figure 43 by the horizontal lines: 
effort in framing by scientists, and level of engagement by non-scientists). When the 
communication process is successful it not only increases receivers’ scientific 
understanding on the coastal system but also fosters engagement and generates feedback. 
The quality and amount of feedback depends on the adopted mechanism with a 
complexity that increases from awareness (in response to outreach) to knowledge (in 
response to co-production). This conceptual model shows that, in order to adopt higher-
level mechanisms (such as co-production for scientific knowledge transfer), it is 
necessary to assure high levels of engagement. If these conditions are not meet it is 
necessary to previously implement actions requiring lower level mechanisms (such as 
outreach), to foster engagement. 

 

• When the objective of scientists is to raise awareness of an audience that is scarcely 
engaged into coastal science, outreach arises as the most adequate mechanism for 
scientific knowledge transfer (bottom of Figure 43). As the audience may not be tuned 
to scientific language and contents, outreach is the mechanism involving the highest 
framing effort by scientists. The feedback of a well-succeeded outreach initiative is 
raising awareness on coastal issues, thus contributing to trigger involvement of the 
audience. In addition, this helps to change receivers’ attitude from passive to active, 
increasing their level of engagement. When society is engaged with science, it is no 
longer a mere spectator of coastal policies and development and is more capable and 
willing to influence the policy-makers and managers towards coastal sustainability, and 
also willing to offer useful contributions to coastal science and management.  

• In crowdsourcing the audience plays an active role, thus the adoption of this 
mechanism requires some level of engagement. This mechanism has the advantage of 
contributing to the development of a participatory society, which is an important step 
towards coastal sustainability. Furthermore, the data generated by the use of this 
mechanism also create a positive feedback to the knowledge generation process. 

• In management-oriented tools, it is expected that coastal actors become more 
autonomous in generating information according to their specific needs. This 
mechanism needs lower framing effort because coastal actors involved are, in general, 
more engaged and aware of the challenges of coastal sustainability. Information 
generated by using management-oriented tools also increases in relevance (as it refers to 
contextualized data) helping scientists to further understand the coastal system.  

 



A conceptual model for success knowledge transfer 

 - 110 -  

• Co-production can be regarded as highest-level mechanism in scientific knowledge 
transfer as the audience is closer to scientific language and issues, thus involving the 
lowest framing effort by scientists (top of the Figure 43). The adoption of this 
mechanism benefits from the knowledge (i.e., combined information leading to 
understanding) generated (also) by the audience. This mechanism stimulates the 
integration of different types of knowledge, thus promoting optimal conditions for 
implementation. 

The conceptual model for scientific knowledge transfer aims to contribute towards a 
society where all key coastal actors are active asset-holders. The mechanisms portrayed in 
this model can be linked with their typical audiences and expected feedbacks: the lower-
level mechanisms usually target society, and the higher-level mechanisms target policy-
makers and managers. Notwithstanding, they can be used to reach all types of audiences 
with a success that mainly depends on the initial levels of engagement of the different

Chapter 7 

7. Conclusions and outlook 
Achieving coastal sustainability depends on the effective integration of scientific 

knowledge in the decision-making process. To do so, scientists need to be able to 
transfer their knowledge outside of the scientific community. However, communication 
gaps arise as a major obstacle to scientific knowledge integration. Communication 
barriers include differences in language adopted by different groups of coastal actors (e.g., 
scientific vs. non-scientific language) and the channels of communication selected by the 
scientific community (e.g., scientific articles) that do not account for specificities of non-
scientific audiences. In overcoming these drawbacks, scientists need to acknowledge that 
their role does not end when scientific knowledge is developed. Scientists have also an 
indispensable role in its successful delivery to non-scientists. 

In the development of a scientific knowledge-transferring framework, the 
identification of the coastal actors is of paramount importance. Coastal actors (other 
rather scientists themselves) make the audiences that scientists aim to reach and 
understanding and respecting their specificities is vital to make communication 
successful. Besides scientists, two other key coastal actors were identified and considered 
in this work: policy-makers and managers, and society. It was also found that 
understanding the ways coastal actors interact is a major issue in fostering knowledge 
transfer, as the existence of weak bounds, or even disconnection, among coastal actors 
can seriously prejudice knowledge transfer among them. This was put in evidence in the 
Coastal Knowledge Triangle, a model that conceptualize coastal actors, their roles and links.  

Once the audience is clearly identified, knowledge transfer depends on coastal actors’ 
engagement and adequate framing of the message to be delivered by scientists. 
Engagement is grounded on empathy and, beyond simple awareness of the problem it 
implies action in itself, enabled by coastal actors’ willingness, trust, competence and 
commitment. Framing helps turning scientific data into meaningful information for the 
target audience. Framing involves translating scientific findings into an understandable 
language by different audiences as well as choosing the proper channels of 
communication to convey the message.  

Indicators arise as the most efficient “common language” to communicate science. 
Moreover, proven to be useful to describe the state and trends of evolution of the coastal 
zone. However, a standardized concept and approach on coastal indicators’ 
quantification and reporting was lacking. Therefore, in the scope of the present study, a 
common framework for the establishment of coastal geoindicators for sandy coast 
environments was developed. Sixteen indicators were identified as relevant for beach, 
coastal dune and coastal barrier environments. 



Conclusions and outlook 

 - 113 -  

Nevertheless, to effectively communicate science it is necessary to find means to 
relate with the audience in order to get the message across. In this work four mechanisms 
for knowledge transfer were identified based upon real world applications. In addition, a 
conceptual model was developed to guide scientists in the selection of the most adequate 
mechanism. Outreach is the most widely known and adopted mechanism to transfer 
scientific knowledge. However, other means are available: crowdsourcing, managers-
oriented tools and co-production. With the exception of outreach these mechanisms are 
still in early stages of development and experimentation – but they all are promising 
alternatives and should be considered as major opportunities to foster knowledge 
transfer. Each mechanism accounts for the audience specificities and conveys the 
message in a different way leading to different types of feedback from the audience: 
outreach leads to coastal awareness; crowdsourcing to data generation; management-
oriented tools generate information, and co-production generates knowledge. Moreover, 
and if adequately used, these mechanisms can foster engagement, minimize framing 
effort and optimize audiences’ feedback.  

In the scope of the present study the concepts of each mechanism are presented and 
discussed as well as the results obtained by real-world applications are put-forward. Two 
outreach initiatives were developed aiming at increasing literacy and awareness: “The 
Beaches of Cascais: past and present” and “The Nazaré Wave: a trigger for learning”. 
Both case studies were highly successful outreach initiatives: “The Beaches of Cascais: 
past and present” exhibition was successful in raising public understanding about the 
coastal system, and promoting a shift in people’ beliefs about beach evolution trends. 
The project “The Nazaré Wave: a trigger for learning” was designed with the purpose of 
transferring scientific knowledge about the physics of waves using the Nazaré Wave as 
the trigger.  The principal outcome of this project - the “The Nazaré Wave” movie - had 
over 6.000 views in the first month of its release and, three months later had been viewed 
in more than 95 countries. Results’ allowed concluding that outreach is a major 
opportunity in fostering engagement and in developing a knowledge-based society.  

In relation with crowdsourcing, in which society can participate in scientific research 
by providing more data, the “Cascais Beach Photo Monitoring” project was design and 
the first task of the project, which implies a 1-year systematic acquisition of photographs 
targeting the beaches of Cascais, was implemented. This project aims to be a proof of 
concept approach designed to demonstrate feasibility of systematic acquisition of 
photographs to support further developments of crowdsourcing tools targeting beach 
monitoring. It was found that photographs are a valuable resource in beach monitoring 
as they easily provide a reliable qualitative identification of beach changes while, at the 
same time, can have a major positive impact in upstreaming public engagement on 
coastal issues. Moreover, results suggest that crowdsourcing can not only increase the 
frequency of observations, in ways that coastal management agencies may not be able to 
do, but also contribute to reducing costs associated with coastal monitoring programs.   



Conclusions and outlook 

 - 114 -  

Within management-oriented tools, it was developed the “Wave Transformation 
Matrices”, a graphical solution that allows for estimating site-specific nearshore wave 
characteristics. Besides being demonstrated to be useful for coastal managers, WTM can 
also be suitable to address the needs of information of sub-groups of society (e.g., 
surfers, fishermen). In addition, WTM allows users to be informing on physical processes 
and acknowledge uncertainty and issue is of major importance in building trust among 
coastal actors, grounded in the principle of the “best available knowledge”.  

The “Coastal Information System for the municipality of Cascais” (CIS) project, 
aiming at establishing of a coastal monitoring program targeting Cascais’ beaches, was 
co-design in close collaboration with technicians from this municipality. CIS project 
constitutes a successful example of co-production having benefits in address the needs of 
those who participated and in maximizing resources, thus increasing the changes of 
projects’ implementation and longevity. Worth mention that the conditions for the 
development of the CIS project was base upon previous (positive) experience from the 
outreach initiative “The Beaches of Cascais: past and present”. This highlights the 
importance of outreach in fostering engagement and in enabling conditions for moving 
forward closer collaboration.  

Results from the above-mentioned projects allowed for the development and 
establishment of a conceptual model aiming at supporting scientists in the selection of 
the most adequate mechanisms for successful knowledge transfer. In this selection 
scientists must weigh the expected level of engagement of the audience, and expected 
feedback in both quantity and quality aspects. Using the adequate mechanism will help in 
overcoming the existent communication gaps and increase the participation of all key 
coastal actors in the decision-making process.  

Scientists must also develop their framing skills and acknowledging the benefits of 
engaging with others. In addition, scientists need to (and sometimes, learn to) listen to 
their audience to find and understand their needs of information. Such an attitude will 
allow scientists and science to effectively inform decision-making as often society’s (in a 
broad scope) needs of information differs from that which science routinely provides. 
This effort is time-consuming and challenges scientists to step outside their comfort zone 
and to take the necessary steps to reach non-scientists in their own ground. Whenever 
scientists are able and willing to make these additional efforts and to communicate more 
effectively with non-scientist audiences, the end-products extend beyond informed 
decision-making: it is now becoming widely acknowledged that when this interaction is 
effective science thrives. Furthermore, science is increasingly interdisciplinary and the 
ability to communicate more effectively across disciplines (e.g., natural and social 
sciences) fosters scientists and institutions’ collaboration, which certainly leads to better 
approaches and solutions towards sustainability.  

 



Conclusions and outlook 

 - 115 -  

The results obtained in the scope of this work and the conclusions herein presented 
allow putting forward a number of tangible considerations aiming at promoting and 
developing a culture of science communication in universities and research &amp;amp; 
development (R&amp;amp;D) institutions. This will narrow the communication gaps between 
scientists (and science) and other coastal actors and will improve the effectiveness of 
coastal scientific knowledge transfer: 

• The establishment of science communication offices at universities and R&amp;amp;D 
institutions as an interface between institutions that generate scientific knowledge and 
the outside world.  

• To assure science communication projects and initiatives into institutional planning 
and resources allocation enabling conditions for the design and implementation of 
outreach initiatives. 

• To assure training in science communication for faculty, staff and students. Their 
involvement in science communication activities should be recognized, valued and 
rewarded. 

As transferring scientific knowledge implies the existence of target-audiences, it is also 
important that governmental, regional and municipal institutions sharing responsibilities 
in science policies and in the management of the coastal zone develop their own 
resources to maximize the process of knowledge transfer.  

This study relies on the premise that a knowledge-based society is needed to meet the 
objective of coastal sustainability. Therefore, scientists should actively pursue the goal of 
transferring science outside of the scientific community and fully embrace their role in 
this process. The implementation of the above-mentioned measures will contribute to 
improve the transfer of coastal scientific knowledge, from concept to implementation. 
Altogether, scientists and institutional efforts will shorten the leap from knowledge to 
implementation fostering the use of scientific knowledge as the rationale for costal 
sustainability.
