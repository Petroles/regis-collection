Abstract 

 
Reconstructing past sea surface temperature conditions is valuable to observe and 
evaluate the climate of the past. In the SW Atlantic, so far, few studies have 
exanimated the applicability of paleotemperature equations, which may reflect in 
fewer reliable SST estimates. This study aimed to evaluate two marine proxies for 
SST reconstructions: the alkenones unsaturation index (UK’37) and the ratio Mg/Ca in 
different planktonic foraminifera species and size fractions (G. ruber pink; G. ruber 
white senso stricto and senso lato; between 250 - 300 µm and 300 - 355 µm; G. 
truncatulinoides (d) crusted and non-crusted forms, between 380 – 620 µm; and G. 
inflata 300 – 425 µm). The samples were collected in the shelf break of South 
Brazilian Bight (SBB, 22 °S to 27 °S). The proxies were converted into SSTs and 
then compared to modern SSTs from the World Ocean Atlas and satellite images. 
The first chapter describes the UK’37 signals and the applicability of three different 
paleotemperature equations, and the second chapter describes the Mg/Ca a proxy 
for past SSTs and water mass conditions after applying the most used 
paleotemperature equations for the ratio Mg/Ca. The UK’37 seems to record mostly 
autumn conditions at 0m, and the most recent Bayspline equation results into more 
similar temperature averages when compared to modern annual SSTs (p-value of 
0.81, n = 47, ?SST of -0.03°C ± 0.27), while the most used linear equations result into 
SSTs similar to autumn conditions. In subtropical regions with low-temperature 
variations (~4°C), the function UK’37 versus SSTs works in an exponential relation, 
and they are related to seasonal temperatures. For the Mg/Ca in planktonic 
foraminifera species, the Mg/Ca-inferred temperatures agree well with modern ocean 
temperatures. Our data suggest that in different size fractions the tested species 
respond differently to the most used species-specific and general species 
paleotemperature equations. All the upper water column species agree well with 
temperatures at 0-meter depth. The G. ruber (p) responds well to the SS equation, 
where the smallest and the largest size results into annual and autumn estimates, 
respectively (p-value of 0.81 and 0.71, n = 23); the smallest size of G. ruber (w) s.s. 
provides summer estimates applying the GE equation (p-value of 0.21, n = 7), while 
the largest size provides annual estimates (p-value of 0.86, n = 13). The G. ruber (w) 
s.l. has significant averages when compared the largest size with autumn and 
summer conditions (p-value of 0.21 for both, n = 16); the deep-dwelling species G. 
inflata and the G. truncatulinoides (d) crusted form reflect the uplift of the SACW, 
calcifying at 10 and 20 m depth (p-value of 0.89, n = 10 and p-value of 0.06, n = 14, 
respectively), while the G. truncatulinoides (d) non-crusted form records annual 
temperature in deep water layers conditions (p-value of 0.06, n = 16). This is the first 
study to report Mg/Ca ratios in surface-dwelling and deep-dwelling planktonic 
foraminifera tests obtained in core-top samples at the SBB. This validation will inform 
the reconstruction of past environmental conditions of SW Atlantic, especially in the 
SBB.

Resumo 
 
As reconstruções das condições da temperatura superficial do mar são importantes 
para avaliar o clima do passado da Terra. No Atlântico SE, no entanto, poucos 
estudos avaliaram a aplicabilidade das equações de conversão dos indicadores 
geoquímicos para temperatura, o que pode resultar em estimativas de 
paleotemperatura de menor acurácia. Este estudo avaliou dois indicadores marinhos 
de paleotemperatura: o índice de insaturação de alquenonas (UK’37), e a razão 
Mg/Ca em testas de foraminíferos planctônicos de diferentes espécies e frações de 
tamanho (G. ruber pink; G. ruber white senso stricto e senso lato; entre 250 - 300 
µm e 300 - 355 µm; G. truncatulinoides (d) encrustadas e não-encrustadas, entre 
380 – 620 µm; e G. inflata 300 – 425 µm). As amostras são provenientes da 
plataforma externa e quebra da plataforma do Embaiamento de São Paulo (22°S a 
27°S). Os indicadores foram transformados em TSM e então comparados com as 
temperaturas obtidas por meio do World Ocean Atlas e de imagens de satélite. O 
primeiro capítulo apresenta os dados de UK’37 e a aplicabilidade de três equações 
de paleotemperatura. O segundo capítulo apresenta dados da razão Mg/Ca como 
indicador de TSM e condições de massa d’água após a aplicação das equações de 
conversão. O UK’37 apresenta influência do outono em 0 m de profundidade em seus 
registros, e a mais recente equação Bayspline resulta em médias de TSM mais 
similares com as condições atuais, principalmente quando comparado com a média 
anual de TSM (p-valor de 0.81, n = 47, ?SST de -0.03°C ± 0.27), já as equações 
lineares mais conhecidas resultam em TSM mais parecidas com condições de 
outono. No geral, em regiões com pouca variação de TSM (~1.5 °C), o UK’37 
responde em uma relação exponencial com a temperatura. A razão Mg/Ca em testas 
de foraminíferos planctônicos, quando convertidas em TSM, resultam em médias 
similares com as condições atuais de temperatura. Os nossos dados sugerem que 
as equações específicas para cada espécie (SS) e as equações gerais (GE) 
resultam em diferentes médias de TSM para cada espécie/fração de tamanho. 
Todas as espécies de superfície respondem bem com as temperaturas em 0 metros 
de profundidade. A G. ruber (p) responde bem à equação SS, onde a menor e a 
maior fração de tamanho resulta em médias similares às TSM anuais e de outono, 
respectivamente (p-valor de 0.81 e 0.71, n = 23); a menor fração de tamanho da 
espécie G. ruber (w) s.s. resulta em médias similares às TSM de verão com a 
equação GE (p-valor de 0.21, n = 7), enquanto a maior fração de tamanho resulta 
em TSM anual (p-valor de 0.86, n = 13). A maior fração de tamanho da espécie G. 
ruber (w) s.l. resulta em médias significativas quando comparadas com TSM de 
outono e de verão (p-valor de 0.21 para ambas, n = 16). Os registros geoquímicos 
das espécies de subsuperfície, como a G. inflata e a G. truncatulinoides (d) 
encrustada registram a subida da ACAS para a superfície na área de estudo, 
calcificando em 10 e 20 metros de profundidade, respectivamente (p-valor de 0.89, 
n = 10 e de 0.06, n = 14, respectivamente), enquanto a G. truncatulinoides (d) não-
encrustada aparenta registrar as condições anuais de temperatura em 
profundidades mais próximas da ACAS, com médias um pouco mais elevadas que 
as duas espécies de subsuperfície (p-valor de 0.06, n = 16). Este é o primeiro estudo 
que relata as razões Mg/Ca em diferentes espécies de foraminíferos planctônicos 
no SBB. Esta validação auxiliará a aprimorar futuras estimações de TSM com este 
indicador.

General Introduction 
 
  

 The reconstruction of past Sea Surface Temperature (SST) conditions is 

a powerful tool to evaluate past climatic variations (ELDERFIELD AND 

GANSONS, 2000; ROSENTHAL AND LOHMANN, 2002; EVANS et al., 2016). 

SST can be reconstructed using physico-chemical composition of marine 

sediments (WEFER et al., 1999; KUCERA, 2007), and these records can be 

observed through the geochemical proxies, such as the alkenones unsaturation 

index (UK’37) (e.g. PRAHL AND WAKEHAM, 1987; MUELLER et al., 1998; Conte 

et al., 2006; amongst others), and with the major elements presented in 

foraminifera tests (e.g. ratio Mg/Ca; NÜRNBGERG et al., 1996; ANAND et al., 

2003; amongst others). Each of these proxies varies as the sea temperature 

changes and, after the sediment deposition, they are usually found well preserved 

within the sediment fractions.  

 To convert the geochemical proxy data to quantitative temperature 

estimative, both for foraminifera tests and UK’37, a conversion equation is applied. 

These equations have different coefficients, which may change according to 

different locations (PRAHL et al., 1988; MUELLER et al., 1998; CONTE et al., 

2006; TIERNEY AND TINGLEY, 2018), species and/or size fractions (ANAND et 

al., 2003; CONTE et al., 2006; RICHEY et al., 2012; RIVEIROS et al., 2016; 

THIRUMALAI et al., 2016). 

Within the paleotemperature context, the number of paleoceanographic 

studies in the SW Atlantic has increased during the past decades (e.g. LEDUC 

et al., 2010; PIVEL et al., 2013; CHIESSI et al., 2014; SANTOS et al., 2014; 

CORDEIRO et al., 2014; LESSA et al., 2016; SANTOS et al., 2017; LOURENÇO 

et al., 2017; DAUNER et al., 2019), and, so far, one study has tested the 

applicability of UK’37-based paleotemperature equations (COCCEPIORI et al., 

2018). Despite the growth in interest of paleotemperature in the region, the SW 

Atlantic still lacks validation studies for the SST proxies that are commonly used 

for this purpose. 

The aim of this thesis was to validate the different paleotemperature 

calibrations for these proxies in the SW Atlantic Ocean. This is enable more SST

accurate estimates and, consequently, more robust paleoceanographic 

reconstructions. To do so, this master’s thesis was divided into two chapters to 

assess two different marine paleotemperature proxies. In the first chapter the 

alkenones unsaturation index proxy is presented and discussed, and in the 

second chapter, the Mg/Ca ratio of different species of planktonic foraminifera 

tests was analyzed.

CHAPTER 1 
 

Testing global calibrations for reconstruction of sea surface temperatures 

using UK’37 as a proxy: Which is the best model for the SW Atlantic Ocean?  

 

1.1. Introduction 
 

 The alkenones are a group of long chain (C37-C39) di-, tri- and tetra-

unsaturated methyl and ethyl ketones. They are synthesized by coccolithophores 

of the class Prymnesiophyceae, mainly the Haptophyte algae Emiliania huxleyi 

and Gephyrocapsa oceanica (VOLKMAN et al., 1980; DE LEEUW et al., 1980). 

These species inhabit the upper mixed layer in open waters (about 20 – 30-meter 

depth; WINTER et al., 1994), and in the South Atlantic, they are associated to 

waters with a high content of nutrients and low temperatures (BOECKEL et al., 

2006). 

 The unsaturation level of the alkenones (UK’37) shows a temperature 

response, such that the lower the sea water temperature, the higher the 

unsaturation level of this index (BRASSELL et al., 1986a; PRAHL AND 

WAKEHAM, 1987; PRAHL et al., 1988; SIKES et al., 1997). The index itself was 

first calculated after Brassell et al. (1986b) and readjusted by Prahl and Wakeham 

(1987) (Equation 1), where: 

 

 

U37
K? =  

[C37:2]

[C37:2+C37:3]
      (Equation 1) 

 

 Prahl and Wakeham (1987) observed the linear correlation between UK’37 

and temperature in laboratory culture using the E. huxleyi. From there, Prahl et 

al. (1988) used samples from sediment traps collected along the Pacific Ocean 

and developed the most widely used global calibration of UK’37 as a 

paleotemperature proxy, which is defined as UK’37 = 0.034T + 0.043 (Equation 1). 

This equation has been globally applied for palaeoceanographic studies 

regarding reconstruction of SST based on UK’37 (SIKES et al., 1991; ROSELL-

MELÉ et al., 1995; MUELLER et al., 1998; amongst others).

Conte et al. (2006) gathered core-top samples throughout different ocean 

basins, as well as previous published UK’37 data around the globe, to develop a 

global alkenones equation. In contrast to the linear relationship of Prahl et al. 

(1988), they found that on a global scale, the UK’37 shows a polynomial correlation 

with the SST (T = -0.957 + 54.293(UK’37) – 52.894(UK’37)2 + 28.231(UK’37)3 – 

Equation 2). Then, they proposed a third level polynomial equation to reconstruct 

past SST. 

Other equations for the UK’37 have also been performed in different 

regions/basins to observed possible variations among them (e.g., SIKES et al., 

1991; ROSELL-MELÉ et al., 1995; PELEJERO AND CALVO, 2003; MULLER et 

al., 1998). These authors found, mostly, a linear correlation between their UK’37 

values and the SST. 

For the South Atlantic Ocean, Muller et al. (1998) developed an equation 

for the SE portion of this basin using core-top samples. These authors found a 

similar linear equation to the Prahl et al. (1988) equation (UK’37 = 0.033T + 0.069 

– Equation 3), suggesting that both equations can be properly applied in their 

study basins, as well as in other regions. 

Ceccopieri et al. (2018) were the first authors to test different alkenone 

equations (i.e., PRAHL et al., 1988; MULLER et al. 1998 and TIERNEY AND 

TINGLEY, 2018) in the SW Atlantic aiming to observe which calibration results in 

most reliable SSTs reconstructions for the region. They found that in the Campos 

Basin (20.5 ?S to 24 ?S), the UK’37 correlates best to modern mean annual SSTs 

when the Mueller et al. (1998) equation is applied. They also observed a strong 

correlation of UK´37 SST estimates with winter SSTs which, according to these 

authors, might be a consequence of the upwelling of the South Atlantic Central 

Water (SAWC), which carries cold water and high nutrients content to the surface. 

This phenome is very significant and frequent in the area, especially in the Cabo 

Frio (22 °S) region. 

The South Brazilian Bight (SBB - 23?S - 28?S), is a region that lacks 

paleotemperature studies even though it plays an important role in the global 

ocean circulation system (PETERSON AND STRAMMA, 1991), transporting 

salty and warm waters southwards. Yet, in the SBB, the UK’37-SST reconstructions 

have assumed that Prahl et al. (1988) is the one that provides most reliable 

estimates (i.e. BENTHIEN AND MÜLLER, 2000; LOURENÇO et al., 2018). The 



 

 

 
 

16 

reliability of the inferred results from this equation, however, has not been tested 

so far. 

As previously mentioned, in the SW Atlantic, there is only one study 

regarding the applicability of the equations for SST reconstructions based on UK’37 

(i.e. CECCOPIERI et al., 2018), and it covers an area north of the SBB, which 

shows different oceanographic conditions. Considering that the SW Atlantic has 

not been much explored in the paleoceanographic field, analyzing what is the 

influence of the temperature on the marine sediments of this basins improve the 

understanding of past ocean conditions in the area.  

Therefore, this study tested the applicability of four SST-UK’37 based 

equations in the SBB in order to identify which one provides SSTs that are more 

similar to observed SSTs. In this first chapter, the main goal will be to perform a 

regional calibration of the UK’37 index to compare with previously published 

calibrations. This validation is important to the understanding paleotemperature 

estimates in the SW Atlantic in the context of data gathered from other regions. 

 

1.2. Objectives  
 

The main goal of this chapter was to validate what SST-UK’37 based 

calibrations are more suitable for the SBB. The validation will help to improve 

future paleotemperature data that will be analyzed in the study area and, 

therefore, to understand the palaeoceanographic and paleoclimate evolution of 

the SW Atlantic. 

To reach the main goal of this chapter the following targets were 

established: 

i. Generate data from the geochemical proxies in marine sediments 

(UK’37), from samples collected along the South Brazilian Bight; 

ii. Compare the UK’37 data to observed modern SST and verify what is 

or is there is a correlation between them; 

iii. Compare the SST generated by the UK’37 in this study to previously 

published data from the literature; 

iv. Verify/Validate if the available paleotemperature coefficients are 

adequate for the study area.

1.3. Study Area 
 

 The SBB is located on the SE Atlantic Ocean, extending from Cabo Frio 

to Cabo de Santa Marta (23?S - 28?S, Figure 1). The area presents an arc-shape 

orientation, and its continental shelf is very wide, ranging from 71 to 231 km wide 

(ZEMBRUSKI, 1979). The SBB does not receive large a fluvial discharge due to 

the uplift of the Serra do Mar mountain formation, that deviates the largest rivers 

towards the continent, (MAHIQUES et al., 2002; 2004). Therefore, the 

sedimentary processes in the area are dominated by the local ocean circulation 

(MAHIQUES et al., 2004).

where the samples were retrieved. The yellow, green and the orange triangles represent the 
Contornitos (CTN - FAPESP n° 2016/03381-3), Pockmarks (PM - FAPESP n° 2016/22194-0), 
and GEOSEDEx (GEO) projects respectively. The squares represent the data that were available 
on the literature and were used in this study.

 The Sao Sebastião Island is marked as a division point of the sea floor 

composition, where southwards of the island, the sea floor is composed of mud, 

and northwards, calcium carbonate (MAHIQUES et al., 2004). In the outer 

continental shelf, the presence of coarse sediments is higher, and their presence 

is related to the sediment depositions during the events of regression of the sea 

level (MAHIQUES et al., 2011). 

 The SBB is dominated by the Brazil Current (BC), which flows southwards 

over the shelf break and continental slope (CAMPOS et al., 1995; 2000; 

STRAMMA AND ENGLAND, 1999, Figure 2). The BC transports two water 

masses: the Tropical Water (TW; Temperature &gt; 20?C; Salinity &gt; 36), which is a 

superficial water mass and it is known for presenting warm, salty and oligotrophic 

waters; and the SACW (Temperature &gt; 6?C &amp;lt;20?C, Salinity &gt; 34.6 and &amp;lt;36), 

with colder, less saline and nutrient-enriched waters, which flows at the 

pycnocline levels (MIRANDA, 1985; SILVEIRA et al., 2000). 

 

 

Figure 2 – On Figure 2A represents the vertical structure of the BC over the SBB (Adapted from 
Maatsura, 1986). The meanders caused by the BC can be observed through satellite images on 
Figures 2B, 2C and 2D (Adapted from Calado et al., 2008). 

 



 

 

 
 

19 

 The BC forms meanders and eddies on, especially north of the SBB, due 

to the abrupt changes in the coastline orientation (CAMPOS et al., 2000, Figure 

2). The presence of the clockwise meanders leads to the rise of cold waters (e.g., 

SACW) into the upper water column, generating an upwelling structure 

(CAMPOS et al., 1996; 2000; LIMA, 1997; SILVEIRA et al., 2008), making the 

mixed layer and the nutricline shallower (JIN et al., 2016; MCGILLICUDDY, 

2016). This upwelling structure can be very significant in some parts of the shelf 

break in the austral summer, as reported by Brandini et al. (1990), where they 

observed that in some parts of the shelf break the primary productivity was higher 

than in coastal zones. The seasonal enhanced of the upwelling is caused mainly 

by the increase of the strength of the northeasterly (NE) winds (MATSUURA, 

1986, CASTELÃO et al., 2004), which, besides bringing the SAWC to the surface, 

also favors the Coastal Water (CW) to move offshore. 

 The uplift of cold waters changes the spatial variation of SST, salinity, 

nutrients and suspended material, causing changes on the light availability in the 

photic zones (BRANDINI et al., 1990a; BRANDINI, 2014), resulting in the 

variation in chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration, biomass and phytoplankton 

dynamics throughout the SBB (ODEBRECHT AND CASTELLO, 2001; GAETA 

AND BRANDINI, 2006; BRAGA et al., 2008; BRANDINI et al., 2014). 

 

1.4. Material and Methods  

1.4.1. Alkenones analyses and Nannoplankton Identification 

 

The material analyzed in this thesis comes from 25 core-tops (5 core-tops 

in 0 – 0.5 cm, and 20 core-tops in 0 - 1 cm, Figure 1, Table 1, Appendix) retrieved 

with multiple-corers (MUC) and box-corers, from the inner and outer shelf, as well 

as upper slope off the SE Brazilian margin (24°S to 27°S) during three 

oceanographic cruises, conducted on board the R/V Alpha Crucis, from the 

Oceanographic Institute of the University of São Paulo, as part of three other 

projects. 

 Previously published core-top UK’37 data from the study area (BENTHIEN 

AND MÜLLER, 2000; LOURENÇO et al., 2017, Table 1, Appendix) were also 

added into the data set to improve the statistical analysis and precision of the 

results. 



 

 

 
 

20 

 The samples were extracted and purified at the Laboratory of Marine 

Organic Chemistry (LABQOM) at the Oceanographic Institute of the University of 

São Paulo (IOUSP), as part of other researches. 

 The analytical procedure to alkenones determination was adapted from 

Lourenço (2007). About 10 g of freeze-dried sediments of each sample were 

used. After the samples being macerated and weighed, 80 mL of a mixture of 

dichloromethane (DCM) and n-hexane were added into the samples for them to 

be submitted to the Soxhlet for 8 h. In all samples, it was added 50 ?L of a solution 

of standard 1-hexadecane and 1-eicosene (50 ng ?L-1) to them be used as a 

surrogate. At the end of the extraction process, the samples had their volume 

reduced (concentrated) to, approximately, 0.5 mL in a rotary evaporator in 45 ?C.  

 The purification of the total organic extract (fraction) was performed by 

adsorption column, where the sample was submitted onto 1 g of alumina and 2 g 

of silica, both deactivated at 5% with water and extracted 5 times with n-hexane 

and sodium sulfate. The concentrated organic fraction was eluted in the column 

with 6 mL of n-hexane, as well as 10 mL of DCM/n-hexane. These solutions 

provide aliphatic hydrocarbons and alkenones. The eluate had its volume 

reduced to, approximately, 0.5 mL in the rotary vapor and then transferred to 

amber glass ampoules, where 50 ?L of a solution containing 50 g ?L-1 of the 

internal chromatographic standard (1-tetradecene) was added. After extraction of 

a batch of samples, it was performed an analytical blank (sodium sulfate). 

 The alkenones were identified and quantified through the injection of 1 ?L 

of the final extraction through a gas chromatograph with automatic injector 

coupled to a flame ionization detector (GC-FID; Agilent GC System 6890 Series). 

A chromatographic column of 50 m of length x 0.32 mm of intern diameter x 0.17 

?m of film thickness, where the stationary phase was composed by 5% difenil 

and 95% dimetilpolisioloxane. The carrier gas was H2 (purity &gt; 99.999%), with a 

constant pressure of 7.24 psi. The injector temperature was constantly 

maintained at 280 °C and the injections were conducted in the splitless mode, 

with the detector kept at 325 °C. 

 The quantification of the compounds was performed through the software 

HP Chemstation (G2070 BA). The criteria applied to accept the analytical curve 

of the compound was the Pearson linear correlation equal or superior to 99.5% 

(R2 = 0.995). The identification was made of the ratio of mass and area of the 



 

 

 
 

21 

surrogate standards with the internal chromatographic standard. For the 

alkenones, the C37:3, C37:2, C38:3Et, C38:3Me, C38:2Et, C38:2Me compounds were 

identified and quantified. It was calculated the total concentration of the 

alkenones (i.e. C37:3 + C37:2), and the UK’37 were calculated after Prahl et al. 

(1988), as described in Equation 1. A correlation analyses was then used to verify 

if the total alkenones concentration responded to the chl-a concentrations (see 

the next topic). 

 The nannofossil identification was performed by the South Atlantic 

Paleoceanography Laboratory (LaPAS) team, also at IOUSP. At LaPAS, the 

identification and counting of the coccolithophores (i.e., E. huxleyi and G. 

oceanica) from the samples of this thesis was performed under a light polarizing 

microscope (1000 x). To do this, slides were prepared, according to the Koch and 

Young (2007) method. The cells were counted according to the visual sight 

method (QUADROS, 2007), where at least 300 specimens on each slide were 

counted and identified. The taxonomic classification to identify the 

nanoplanktonic species was performed after Young et al. (2003) and Antunes 

(2007), using as support material the Nannotax3 website (YOUNG et al., 2014). 

 Even though all samples were retrieved above the lysocline, located at 

4300 m depth in the South Atlantic (DITTERT et al., 1999), the E. huxleyi-

C.leptoporus dissolution index, in here including the Boeckel and Baumann 

(2004) modification (CEX’; Equation 4), was applied to observe if the samples 

were submitted to high dissolution. In this study, the large Gephyrocapsa sp. (&amp;lt;

3 µm) was considered instead of G. ericsonii, as Saavedra-Pellitero et al. (2010) 

have executed.

1.4.2. Acquisition Sea Surface Temperatures, Chlorophyll-a, and Statistical 

Analysis 

 

 

 The annual (SSTAN) and austral seasonal (summer – SSTSU, autumn – 

SSTAU, winter – SSTWI, and spring – SSTSP) SSTs, and the chl-a concentrations 

were obtained from the Aqua (EOS PM) satellite with the Moderate Resolution 

Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. All the images were acquired in the 

NASA’s website “Ocean Color” at https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi/l3. 

 For this thesis, third level daytime images were used, with a 4 km 

resolution. The images were treated using the SeaDAS software (version 7.5.1, 

available on https://seadas.gsfc.nasa.gov/). It was possible to SSTs ranging from 

2002 to 2017. The SSTs and chl-a concentrations from the satellites represent 

the austral seasonal and annual sea surface conditions. Data from the 

temperature of the water column was obtained with the World Ocean Atlas 2013 

(WOA13) (LOCARNINI et al., 2013) up to 25 m, because deeper than that, the 

data became not available. 

 After obtaining the satellite and water column sea temperatures for each 

sample location, it was tested the normality of the data with the Shapiro-Wilk test, 

and it was observed if the dataset had outliers. Afterward, a correlation analysis 

(Pearson’s correlation) was performed between the UK’37 and the sea 

temperature with the Past software (version 3.18), to observe the correlation 

between them in order to observe what season/water depth may be being 

recorded in the UK’37 signals. 

The UK’37 signals were then converted into SST after four 

paleotemperature equations (PRAHL et al., 1988; MULLER et al., 1998; CONTE 

et al., 2006; TIERNEY AND TINGLEY, 2018). These equations were selected 

because: i) Prahl et al. (1988) is the widely used paleo-proxy paleotemperature 

equation for UK’37; ii) Muller et al. (1998) performed their analyses in the SE 

Atlantic Ocean; iii) Conte et al. (2006) performed a global calibration, including a 

few samples from SBB and; iv) Tierney and Tingley (2018) created a new global 

equation using Bayesian B-spline regression model (BAYSPLINE) for regions 

where temperatures can get above 24°C. 

The ANOVA test was performed to detect what paleotemperature 

equations based on UK’37 show the lowest difference of averages within

themselves, as well as between the satellites and the WOA13 sea temperatures 

(seasonal and annual sea temperatures).  

A p-value &amp;lt;0.05 (at 95% of significance) is the value where the null 

hypothesis (H0) were rejected and, where, in all cases:  

 

H0: the averages of the calculated SSTs from the equations are equal to 

the obtained sea temperatures (satellites and WOA13); 

H1: the averages of the calculated SSTs from the equations are different 

from the obtained sea temperatures (satellites and WOA13). 

 

Afterward, the difference between the UK’37-inferred SSTs and the satellite 

gathered SSTs (SST anomalies - ?SST) were estimated from the difference 

between the average of the UK’37 equations against the sea temperatures 

gathered from MODIS. The ?SST shows what equation shows lower discrepancies 

between the calculated SST against the satellite SST. 

 

 

 

1.5. Results 
 

The extracted values of the UK’37 from all samples, as well as the seasonal 

and annual SST gathered from the Aqua MODIS Mission, are shown in Table 2 

(Appendix) and in Figure 3. 

The UK’37 showed an average of 0.863 (± 0.02, N = 45), where the highest 

index showed the value of 0.962, and the lowest 0.804. The UK’37 data in this 

study do not present outliers and present normal distribution (Table 2, Appendix). 

The total concentration of the alkenones had values between 0.03 ng/g to 0.92 

ng/g (average of 0.23 ng/g; ± 0.19, N = 42; Table 3, Appendix).

The summary of the results from the satellite SSTs is listed in Table 4 

(Appendix) and Figure 4. In general, SSTSU showed the warmest temperatures, 

and SSTWI showed the coolest temperatures. The SSTAN and SSTAU showed 

temperatures within the 24 °C, and the SSTSP averages in the 23 °C. The water 

column temperatures are listed in Table 5 (Appendix).

Figure 4 – Distribution of the seasonal and annual SSTs (in °C) from the samples retrieved 
along with the SBB. 

 

The annual and seasonal SSTs obtained from the satellite images did not 

present any outliers and, except for SSTSU, the temperatures do not present a 

normal distribution even after transforming them into log scale. The temperatures 

gathered from the WOA13, on the other hand, presented outliers and did not 

present a normal distribution. Therefore, a non-parametric analysis of non-

transformed data for the statistical analysis was performed in this study. 



 

 

 
 

26 

For the satellite image temperatures, all seasonal SSTs, except for SSTSU, 

presented a strong correlation with the UK’37 (R &gt; 0.5, N = 45) (Table 6, Appendix). 

The UK’37 presented highest correlation with the SSTAU (R = 0.61, p &amp;lt;0.05, N = 

45). For the sea temperatures obtained with the WOA13, in general, the depth of 

10 m showed the highest correlations with the UK’37, (Table 7, Appendix) where 

the highest was observed with the autumn temperatures at 10 m deep (R = 0.43, 

p-value &amp;lt;0.05, N = 42). 

The inferred SSTs-UK’37 based in published equations are listed in Table 

8. Overall, all equations result in temperatures that are similar to modern SSTs. 

The average of Prahl et al. (1988) equation is 24.85 °C (± 0.86, N = 45). The 

Mueller et al. (1998) equation shows an average of 24.91 °C (± 0.94, N = 45). 

The polynomial equation developed by Conte et al. (2006) results in an average 

of 26.64 °C (± 0.74, N = 45), and the Bayesian equation created by Tierney and 

Tingley (2018) shows an average of 24.40 °C (± 1.08, N = 45). 

The results of the ?SST calculated after the Prahl et al. (1988), Muller et al. 

(1998), Conte et al. (2006) and Tierney and Tingley (2018) are shown in Tables 

Table 9, Table 10, Table 11, Table 12, respectively (Appendix). In general, the 

lowest ?SST within the published equations and the satellite SSTs was between 

SSTAN and the Tierney and Tingley (2018) equation (-0.03 °C ± 0.27). In Figure 

5, it is possible to observe how the data from this study (purple line) fits in a 

scatterplot when compared to the previously published global calibrations.

SSTAU, where Prahl et al. (1988), Muller et al. (1998), Conte et al., (2006), and Tierney and Tingley 
(2018) are represented as orange, blue, green and yellow, respectively. The gray area highlights 
the range of temperature from the gathered in the samples of this study (purple line). 

 

 

On Table 13 (Appendix) it is possible to observe the results of the p-values 

of the Kruskal-Wallis test, where it the averages of the UK’37-inferred SSTs 

obtained with the published equations are compared to the annual and seasonal 

SSTs gathered from the satellite images. Our data suggest that there is no 

significant difference between the Prahl et al. (1988) and Mueller et al. (1998) 

SSTs estimates with the SSTAU (p-value of 0.48 and 0.61, respectively). 

The Tierney and Tingley (2018) equation presented the most similar 

averages with modern temperatures within all equations, with strong signifancy 

with the SSTAN (p-value of 0.87). On the other hand, the Conte et al. (2006) is the 

equation that gives less representative results, showing its highest (but low) p-

value with SSTSU (p-value of 0.007). When compared with the water column 

temperatures gathered with the WOA13 (0 to 25 m), none of the equations result 

in significant similar averages. 

The chl-a concentrations had the lowest values in the austral summer 

(0.16 mg dm-3 ± 0.09, N = 45), while the highest concentrations were found in the 



 

 

 
 

28 

winter (0.27 mg dm-3 ± 0.16, N = 45, Table 14, Appendix). All chl-a concentrations 

showed significant negative correlation with the UK’37 values (R &amp;lt;- 0.5). The most 

negative correlation was observed with the winter season (R – 0.55, p &amp;lt;0.001, N 

= 45) (Table 15, Appendix). 

Between the two known species considered to synthesize alkenones, the 

coccolithophore G. oceanica was the most abundant species (Table 16, 

Appendix), composing about 19.56% of the total sample (± 5.98, N = 21), while 

E. huxleyi species correspond to approximately 17.14% of the total assemblage 

(± 8.66, N = 21). 

The CEX’ (Table 17, Appendix), showed values higher than 0.80, and an 

average of 0.96 ± 0.03, where the lowest index was 0.89 and highest was 1.0, 

suggesting that the samples have not been under dissolution processes. 

 

1.6. Discussion 

1.6.1. UK’37 records and its synthesizers in the SBB 

 

 

The UK’37 signals from the samples of this study suggest that, except for 

the SSTSU, all seasons show a strong correlation with the UK’37 signals at 0 m, 

especially the SSTAU, which seems to play a major role in these records. 

Previous proxy validation studies in different basins have also reported the 

imprint of UK’37 during autumn. For instance, Rosell-Melé et al. (1995) noted that 

in the Northeastern Atlantic (2°S – 75°N) the alkenones temperature signals 

reflect SSTAU rather than SSTAN at 0 m depth. They obtained their SST data from 

the WOA82, and, even though they found the highest correlation at surface, they 

suggested that their surface temperature should be considered not only to the 0 

m depth, but to the mixed layer, since their samples come from a large latitudinal 

gradient. 

Ternois et al. (1996) observed that the production of UK’37 in the 

Northwestern Mediterranean Sea takes in the upper water column during autumn 

from their sediment trap samples, when the production of coccolithophores is 

higher. They suggest that the seasonality and the depth of the alkenones 

production must be considered when reconstructing SSTs based on UK’37, as well 

as the interannual viability of the coccolithophores production. Also, Prahl et al. 



 

 

 
 

29 

(1993) reported that the UK’37 signals collected from their sediment traps in the 

Mediterranean Sea are cold-biased records, influenced mainly by episodic 

upwelling events near the coast, which induces to the high productivity of the 

alkenones producers. 

The G. oceanica and the E. huxleyi prefer to inhabit nutrient-rich waters 

(BOECKEL et al., 2006), and in the study area they bloom mainly during summer 

(BRANDINI et al., 2004). The weakest correlation of UK’37 with SST occurs during 

summer, which can be a result of habitat competition within the phytoplankton 

community. As in the study area, during summer, blooms of diatoms and 

microflagellates have been previously reported (BRANDINI et al., 1989; 

BRANDINI, 1990; CASTRO et al., 2006, BRANDINI et al., 2014).  

The data from this study suggests that the coccolithophores also bloom 

during summer, once the total alkenones concentration shows its highest 

correlation with that season. However, the total assemblage of nannoplankton 

from this study shows that, overall, the E. huxleyi and G. oceanica are not the 

most abundant species in the region, suggesting that there is a seasonal bloom 

variation between diatoms and coccolithophores throughout the year. 

 It is possible to hypothesize that the coccolithophores that synthesize the 

alkenones have habitat advantage during cooler seasons, as the water has lower 

temperatures, as well as lower nutrient content, while other nannoplankton are 

more abundant over them during warm seasons. The same patter has been 

suggested by Dauner et al. (2019). It is possible to suggest that as they dominate 

the environment during cooler seasons, they also record the temperature 

conditions of the upper water column, especially the 10 m depth. 

 

 

1.6.2. Which UK’37-paleotemperature model is the most suitable for the 

SBB? 
 

 Most of the temperatures inferred from the UK’37 based equations applied 

in this study show similar results within them. In general, Mueller et al. (1998) and 

Prahl et al. (1988) averages are similar to each other, and they both agree well 

with modern SSTAU. Northwards from the SBB, Ceccopieri et al. (2018) used 

core-top samples retrieved in the Campos Basin to observe the similarities within 



 

 

 
 

30 

the temperatures gathered from the WOA13 to the data from UK’37. These authors 

detected that the UK’37 values reflect colder temperatures, and that the Mueller et 

al. (1998) equation is also the most suitable for paleotemperature reconstruction 

in the area, reflecting SSTAN. 

 In this study, the equation that agrees the most with modern temperatures 

is the Bayesian equation developed by Tierney and Tingley (2018), as it provides 

strong similar averages when compared to SSTAN. Since the Bayspline equation, 

developed by Tierney and Tingley (2018), were proposed to decrease the effector 

and slope attenuation of the data. Our results show that this model is more 

reliable statistical paleotemperature SST-UK’37 estimates. 

 

1.7. Final Considerations 
 
 This study suggests that the signatures of UK’37 in the SW Atlantic, 

especially between 22°S to 27°S, can be used as paleoceanographic proxies for 

reconstructing past sea temperature conditions. The UK’37 index responds more 

to seasonal SSTs than to annual SSTs. Apparently, in the SBB, the UK’37 records 

cooler temperatures, especially from the autumn season, which agrees well to 

surface and upper water column sea temperatures. 

 In the SBB, the inferred SST-UK’37 equation that results in more similar 

temperatures to modern SSTs is the Bayspline equation developed by Tierney 

and Tingley (2018), providing annual SSTs. For seasonal SSTs, especially SSTAU 

estimates, it is suggested to apply the Mueller et al. (1998) equation.  

 This study suggests that in regions with low-temperature ranges (~4 °C), 

the function UK’37 versus SSTs works in an exponential relation, and they are 

related to seasonal temperatures. In order to verify this hypothesis, more 

paleotemperature studies with the application of UK’37 in subtropical regions 

should be performed.

CHAPTER 2  

 

Regional calibration of marine proxies in the SW Atlantic: A planktonic 

foraminifera proxy-based calibration 

 

2.1. Introduction 
 

The understanding of how climate has varied throughout Earth’s history is 

a major key to evaluate and comprehend natural climate variations (WEFER et 

al., 1999), and to predict future environmental changes (BRADLEY, 2000). The 

oceans play an important role in climate due to the exchange of heat with the 

atmosphere (ROSENTHAL, 2007), what makes the reconstruction of past sea 

surface temperatures (SST) one of the main variables to observe past 

temperature changes.  

A method that has been widely used to reconstruct past ocean 

hydrographic parameters is the ratio Mg/Ca in planktonic foraminifera tests 

(NÜRNBERG et al., 1996; LEA et al., 1999; ELDERFIELD AND GANSSEN, 

2000; ANAND et al., 2003; CLÉROUX et al., 2007; amongst others). Planktonic 

foraminifera tests sink to the ocean floor where their tests are commonly found 

well-preserved within the marine sediment (KUCERA, 2007). Past ocean 

temperature and water column structure reconstructions commonly use 

individually or together surface-dwelling species (e.g., Globigerinoides ruber),  

intermediate dwellers species (e.g., Globorotalia inflata), and deep-dwelling 

species (e.g., Globorotalia truncatulinoides) (ELDERFIELD AND GANSSEN, 

2000; WELDEAB et al., 2006; FARMER et al., 2011; CHIESSI et al., 2014, 

REYNOLDS et al., 2018, amongst others). 

 The Mg/Ca ratio in planktonic foraminifera tests is one among many 

proxies in paleoceanographic studies for SST reconstructions. The incorporation 

of magnesium ions (Mg+2) in the foraminifera calcite is temperature dependent 

where, during test calcification, as sea temperature increases, the foraminifera 

calcite Mg/Ca ratio increases exponentially (NÜRNBERG et al., 1996; LEA et al., 

1999; ELDERFIELD AND GANSSEN, 2000; BARKER et al., 2003; DEKENS et 

al., 2002; ANAND et al., 2003;  EGGINS et al., 2003; amongst others). 

 The Mg/Ca ratio obtained from analysis of the foraminifera tests can be 

converted into temperature using an empirical relationship between Mg/Ca and 



 

 

 
 

32 

temperature (e.g., ANAND et al., 2003, GRAY et al., 2018). Other variables such 

as test size, vital effects, salinity, and pH may also influence foraminiferal Mg/Ca 

(e.g., ANAND et al., 2003; RICHEY et al., 2012; RIVEIROS et al., 2016). As a 

result, testing the Mg/Ca-SST calibrations in different regions and oceanographic 

settings is highly recommended before interpreting palaeoceanographic results 

(ANAND et al., 2003; RICHEY et al., 2012). 

The number of paleoceanographic studies in the SW Atlantic has 

increased recently (e.g., LEDUC et al., 2010; PIVEL et al., 2013; CHIESSI et al., 

2014; SANTOS et al., 2014; LESSA et al., 2016; SANTOS et al., 2017). Despite 

the increase in interest and the continuous use of Mg/Ca-based SST estimates, 

the SW Atlantic still lacks calibration studies for the most commonly used 

planktonic foraminifera species (i.e., G. ruber, G. inflata, and G. truncatulinoides). 

Two previous studies performed in the SW Atlantic are related to 

calibration of planktonic foraminifera proxies: G. ruber (white) ?18O calibration by 

Franco-Fragas et al. (2011), and the G. inflata SST based Mg/Ca ratio calibration 

by Groeneveld and Chiessi (2011). Currently, most of the SW Atlantic 

palaeoceanographic studies involving G. ruber (pink and white morphotypes) 

SST based Mg/Ca estimates apply the conversion equation suggested by Anand 

et al. (2003), which was calculated for specimens collected in the North Atlantic.  

 Overall, good interpretations of prior SSTs conditions rely on the validation 

and accuracy of the analyzing data (LEE et al., 2008), and the lack of regional 

inferred Mg/Ca-SST validation may reflect in less robust SST assessments. 

Hence, testing the paleotemperature equations is essential to improve past 

temperature estimates, providing more reliable results. 

 Against this background, this study conducted an elemental analysis in 

four planktonic foraminifera species retrieved from 26 core-top samples along the 

South Brazilian Bight (SBB – 24°S to 27°S), SW Atlantic. The ratio Mg/Ca will be 

used to test the most applied paleotemperature equation for Mg/Ca-SST 

estimates (e.g. ANAND et al., 2003). This is the first comparison based on Mg/Ca 

performed on various size fractions of different planktonic foraminifera species 

and variants (e.g. white s.s. and s.l.) in the SW Atlantic. 

 



 

 

 
 

33 

2.2. Objectives 
 

The main goal of this chapter was to test the Mg/Ca-paleotemperature 

based equations of different planktonic foraminifera species in different size 

fractions from marine surface sediments retrieved from the SBB. From these 

analyses, this is study is aimed to: 

i. Generate data from the paleotemperature proxies (e.g. Mg/Ca) in 

tests of four species of planktonic foraminifera, and in different size 

fractions, from core-top sediment samples collected along the SBB; 

ii. Compare the Mg/Ca among the selected species/size fractions  

iii. Transform the Mg/Ca into temperature and compare to modern 

SST to observe what is or is there is a correlation between them; 

iv. Identify what season the sea temperature has most significant 

impact on the ratio Mg/Ca records in upper water planktonic 

foraminifera shells; 

v. Compare the SST generated by the Mg/Ca in this study to 

previously published data from the literature; 

vi. Verify/Validate if the available paleotemperature coefficients are 

adequate for the study area. 

 

This validation will inform the reconstruction of past environmental 

conditions of SW Atlantic, especially in the Southern Brazilian margin. 

 

2.3. Study Area 
 

 

The samples from this study come from the outer shelf and shelf break of 

SBB, ranging the latitudes of 24°S to 28°S (Figure 6). Presenting a wide 

continental shelf, extending from 71 to 231 km wide, the area has an arc-shape 

morphology, and it does not receive significant fluvial discharge (ZEMBRUSKI 

1979, MAHIQUES et al., 2004).

Figure 6 - Map of the study area and sample locations, as the triangles represent the locations 
where the samples were retrieved. The yellow, green and the orange triangles represent the 
Contornitos (CTN - FAPESP n° 2016/03381-3), Pockmarks (PM - FAPESP n° 2016/22194-0), 
and GEOSEDEx (GEO) projects respectively. 

 

 On the continental shelf, the sediment composition is composed of very 

fine sands (MAHIQUES et al., 2004). In offshore areas, the meanders and eddies 

formed by the Brazil Current (BC) play a major role in the sediment transport 

(SILVEIRA et al., 2000; MAHIQUES et al., 2007), and the sediments are mostly 

composed of clay and calcium carbonate (MAHIQUES et al., 2004), as well as 

coarse sediments, which are related to the sediment depositions during the 

events of regression of the sea level (MAHIQUES et al., 2011). 

 The BC is the main current systems that flows on the SBB. This current 

flows towards south, and its path goes over the shelf break and continental slope 

(CAMPOS et al., 1995; 2000; STRAMMA AND ENGLAND, 1999). The BC 

transports two water masses: the Tropical Water (TW; Temperature &gt; 20?C; 

Salinity &gt; 36),  a superficial water mass and it can be recognize for carrying warm, 

salty and oligotrophic waters; and the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW, 

Temperature &gt; 6?C &amp;lt;20?C, Salinity &gt; 34.6 and &amp;lt;36), carrying colder, less saline 

and nutrient-enriched waters, flowing at the pycnocline levels (MIRANDA, 1985; 

SILVEIRA et al., 2000). 



 

 

 
 

35 

 The meanders and eddies that the BC develops is caused because of the 

abrupt changes in the coastline orientation along the SBB (CAMPOS et al., 2000). 

These systems flow offshore and their presence lead to the rise of the SACW to 

the photic zone, and resulting in the fertilization of the upper water column 

(CAMPOS et al., 1996; 2000; LIMA, 1997; SILVEIRA et al., 2008). 

 The rise of the SACW changes the spatial variation of sea temperature, 

salinity, nutrients in the upper water column (BRANDINI et al., 1990a; BRANDINI, 

2014), modifies the chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration, biomass and 

phytoplankton dynamics throughout the SBB (ODEBRECHT AND CASTELLO, 

2001; GAETA AND BRANDINI, 2006; BRAGA et al., 2008; BRANDINI et al., 

2014). 

2.4. Material and Methods 

2.4.1. Sample procedures 

 

 Samples from 25 core-tops (5 core-tops in 0 – 0.5 cm, and 20 core-tops in 

0 – 1 cm) retrieved with multiple-corer (MUC) and box-corer, from the shelf, outer 

shelf and upper slope of the SE Brazilian margin (from water depths of 121 m to 

1557 m; latitudes of 24°S to 27°S) during three oceanographic cruises conducted 

on board the R/V Alpha Crucis, from the Oceanographic Institute of the University 

of São Paulo (IOUSP), as described in chapter 1 (Figure 6). 

The samples were washed with a 63 µm mesh and oven dried (T &amp;lt;40°C). 

After they were dried, the samples were sieved into different size fractions in 

order to obtain the planktonic foraminifera tests that were selected for this study: 

G. ruber (morphotypes pink and white s.s. and s.l. in the size fractions of 250 – 

300 µm and 300 – 355 µm; G. inflata, within the size fraction of 300 – 425 µm, 

and the G. truncatulinoides right coiling (i.e., dextral), in the size fraction of 380 – 

620 µm). 

The G. ruber white s.s. and s.l. morphotypes were visually separated 

under a binocular microscope according to the characteristic cited by Wang 

(2000) (Figure 7 and Figure 8, respectively). This separation was performed 

because both white morphotypes present different habitat preferences in some 

regions, where the s.l. is a cold-biased species, and shows larger depths 

variation, while the s.s. tends to inhabit the upper depths (WANG, 2000; 

STEINKE et al., 2005).

38 

The G. truncatulinoides (d) were separated into crusted (C) and non-

crusted (NC) forms for the Mg/Ca analyses. For this, the tests were observed 

under a binocular microscope (Figure 13 and Figure 14, respectively,  Appendix). 

This separation was determined because, in other regions, the C and NC test 

forms have been determined as indicative of calcification at different water depths 

(e.g., SPEAR et al., 2011; SALMON et al., 2016; REYNOLDS et al., 2018), and 

because visual discrimination of both forms can be subjective. More information 

regarding the discrimination of both forms is described on appendix.  

 

 

2.4.2. Planktonic foraminifera test geochemical analyses 

 

The major elements presented in the foraminifera tests (e.g. Mg and Ca) 

were determinated at the U.S. Geological Survey, Coastal and Marine Science 

Center (St. Petersburg, FL, USA), under the supervision of Dr. Julie Richey. For 

these analyses, ~60 tests of all four foraminifera species  were gently crushed 

and cleaned according to the cleaning procedures by Barker et al. (2003), which 

consists in the removal of multiple clay minerals, and organic matter that may be 

attached into/onto the foraminifera tests by an oxidative step, as well as the 

removal of adsorbed metals by an acid leaching step. After the cleaning 

procedures, the tests were then analyzed on a Perkin Elmer Optima 7300 dual 

view inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). 

Mg/Ca was corrected by using the internal gravimetric standard (IGS) method 

after Schrag (1999). 

To check for removal of clays during the cleaning procedure, samples 

were monitored for peaks of Fe, Mn, and Al. Although the abundance of these 

elements in foraminiferal calcite is typically below the detection limits on the ICP-

OES, they may be detected in measurable concentrations if contaminants are 

present. From these elements, it is possible to identify early diagenesis (e.g., Fe 

and Mn), as well as contamination of clay minerals (e.g., Al). The samples that 

presented high peaks of one or more of these elements, combined with low or 

high Ca concentration (i.e., &amp;lt;5 ug g-1 and &gt; 30 ug g-1) were excluded from the 

statistical analysis (see RICHEY et al., 2012). Sample replicates were performed 

to measure natural variations among sample aliquots and to analyze precision. 



 

 

 
 

39 

 

2.4.3. Data analyses and interpretation 

 

 Modern SST observations were obtained through satellite images (NASA 

Ocean Color database). Data of sea temperature and salinity of the water column 

(0 m, 10 m, 15 m, 20 m and 25 m) was obtained with the World Ocean Atlas 2013 

databse (WOA13). 

 The statistical analysis of the Mg/Ca data were performed on the Past3 

software (version 3.8). For all species, it was tested the normality (Shapiro-Wilk) 

to the identification of outliers through boxplot charts. 

 To verify if the Mg/Ca-derived SST agrees with observed modern SSTs, 

the species-specific (SS) equation and the general species (GE) equation 

developed by Anand et al. (2003) were applied for Mg/Ca ratio for all four 

foraminifera species. Afterwards, an ANOVA test was performed to determine if 

the paleotemperature equations result in sea temperature averages similar to 

modern SSTs gathered by satellitle images and the WOA13 temperatures. A p-

value of 0.5 (at 95% of confidence) was stablished to accept or reject the null 

hypothesis (H0), where, in all cases: 

 

 H0: The averages of the Mg/Ca-SSTs are equal to the temperatures 

obtained by the satellite and WOA13; 

 H1: The averages the Mg/Ca-SSTs are different to the temperatures 

obtained by the satellite and WOA13. 

 

 When the p-values from the ANOVA test were lower (greater) than 0.5, the 

H0 was rejected (accepted).

2.5. Results 

2.5.1. Satellite SSTs and Water Column Temperatures 

 
 The Table 18 (Appendix) contains the compiled SSTs both from the Aqua 

MODIS satellite and the WOA13 for all locations of this study. In summary, the 

highest temperatures occur in summer, followed by the autumn temperatures. 

For the satellite images, the SSTAN averages 24.5 °C (± 0.29), SSTAU shows an 

average of 25.16 °C (± 0.36), SSTWI presents an average of 22.1 °C (± 0.49), 

SSTSP averages 23.22 °C (± 0.36), and SSTSU averages 26.4 °C (± 0.18) (Figure 

9). 

 

 

Figure 9 – Averages of the observed modern SST (in °C) gathered from the Aqua MODIS satellite. 

 

 The water column temperatures gathered from the WOA13 show lower 

temperatures than the satellite ones (Table 19, Figure 10). In summary, 

temperatures at 0 m depth shows higher temperatures than at 25 m depth, where 

the highest temperature at the surface was during summer (26 °C ± 0.12), and 

the lowest temperature during winter (21.4 °C ± 0.54), and, at 25 m depth, the 

highest temperature observed was in winter (16.4 °C ± 0.25), and the lowest was 

during summer (15.6 °C ± 0.28).

2.5.2. Elemental Analysis of Planktonic Foraminifera Tests and Statistical 

Analyses 

 

 The raw Mg/Ca data can be found in Table 20 (Appendix). A summary of 

the results of the ratio for all species of this research can be found in Table 21 

(Appendix), as well as in Figure 11. 

 The Mg/Ca ratio in the G. inflata species (300 – 425 µm) averaged 1.78 

mmol/mol (± 0.16, n = 10), where the highest value was 2.12 mmol/mol, and the 

lowest value was 1.53 mmol/mol. 

 For G. ruber (p) within the size fraction of 250 – 300 µm, the Mg/Ca ratio 

averaged 3.71 mmol/mol (± 0.32, n = 21), with a maximum of 4.42 mmol/mol, and 

minimum of 3.23 mmol/mol. The tests of the 300 - 355 µm size fraction of G. ruber 

(p) showed an average of 3.95 mmol/mol (± 0.24, n = 23), with a maximum of 

4.58 mmol/mol, and a minimum 3.38 mmol/mol. 

 The G. ruber (w) s.s. species within the 250 – 300 µm size fraction 

presented an average of 4.04 mmol/mol (± 0.26, n = 7), ranging from 3.74– 4.49 

mmol/mol. For the 300 – 355 µm size fraction, the average was 4.12 mmol/mol 

(± 0.24, n = 13), and ranged from 3.85–4.76 mmol/mol. 

 For the G ruber (w) s.l. species in the size fraction of 250 – 300 µm, the 

average of Mg/Ca ratio was 3.89 mmol/mol (± 0.29, n = 24), ranging from 3.37 

mmol/mol to 4.54 mmol/mol. In the size fraction of 300 – 355 µm, the G. ruber 

(w) s.l. show an average of 3.99 mmol/mol (± 0.34, n = 16), where the highest 

ratio was 4.54 mmol/mol, and the lowest ratio was 3.23 mmol/mol. 

 The non-crusted type of G. truncatulinoides between the size fraction of 

380 – 620 µm presented an average of 1.92 mmol/mol (± 0.18, n = 16), ranging 

from 1.68 mmol/mol to 2.36 mmol/mol. The crusted type of G. truncatulinoides 

(same size fraction) showed an average of 1.94 mmol/mol (± 0.17, n = 14), where 

the Mg/Ca ranged from 1.63 mmol/mol to 1.63 mmol/mol. 

 



 

 

 
 

43 

 

Figure 11 – Boxplot of Mg/Ca ratio from the species that were analyzed in this research project. 
The species that inhabit the upper water column show higher Mg/Ca ratio, while species that 
inhabit lower regions of the water column show lower Mg/Ca ratio. The outliers are represented 
as circles. 

 

 The Shapiro-Wilk test suggested that only the G. ruber (w) s.s. species in 

the size fraction of 300 – 355 µm does not present normality, even after 

transforming it into log scale. Therefore, it was chosen to keep the non-

transformed data, applying a non-parametric analyses for the interpretations (p-

value of the Kruskal-Wallis test). 

 The t-test suggested that the only species that have significantly different 

statistical means is the G. ruber (p), (p-value of 0.006), where the size fraction of 

300 – 355 µm shows about 0.24 mmol/mol higher than the size fraction of 250 – 

300 µm species.   

 Meanwhile, the other upper water column species do not show difference 

within their means. The G. ruber (w) s.s. showed a p-value of 0.51 between the 

size fractions of 250 – 300 µm and 300 – 355 µm, where the first size fraction has 

slightly higher Mg/Ca ratio (0.07 mmol/mol). The mean values between the two 



 

 

 
 

44 

size fraction of G. ruber (w) s.l. morphotype also are not significantly different as 

the p-value of the t-test suggests (p-value of 0.30). The size fraction of 300 – 355 

µm is slightly higher, showing a 0.10 mmol/mol higher than the 250 – 300 µm size 

fraction. 

 The crusted and non-crusted tests of G. truncatulinoides (d) species do 

not show the difference in their means as well (p-value of 0.79). Between these 

two forms, the crusted form has slightly higher Mg/Ca concentration, showing a 

difference of 0.017 mmol/mol between them. 

 Between the upper water column species (i.e., all the G. ruber species 

within all size fractions), the Kruskal-Wallis test suggested that there is a 

significant difference between the averages (p &amp;lt;0.05). On Table 22 it is possible 

to see the means that are significantly different between the species that inhabit 

the upper water column fractions. 

 For the deep-dwelling species, the Kruskal-Wallis test suggested that all 

the means do not show significant difference within them (p-value of 0.95). In fact, 

the test showed that the G. inflata species shows significantly similar Mg/Ca 

means to the crusted form of G. truncatulinoides (d) (p-value of 0.98). The p-

values between these species can be seen in Table 23. 

 

 

2.5.3. Species-specific (SS) and general species (GE) equations to convert 

Mg/Ca ratios into SSTs  

 

 In Table 24 (Appendix) and Figure 12 displays all the ratio Mg/Ca 

converted into SSTs for each of the core-top samples from this study. Overall, 

the SS equations shows higher temperatures than the GE equations. Also, for 

the G. ruber species, the Mg/Ca-derived temperature is higher in the larger test 

size. 

 For the G. ruber (p) within the size fraction of 250 – 300 µm, when the SS 

equation is applied, the resulting SST is 24.4°C (± 1.5, n = 21). Meanwhile the 

GE equation results in 25.3°C (± 1.0, n = 21). The difference between the species-

specific to the general species equation is 0.9 °C.  

 The SS equation for tests within 300 - 355 µm of the G. ruber (p) showed 

an average of 25.21 °C (± 0.91, n = 23), and the GE equations resulted in 26.02 



 

 

 
 

45 

°C (± 0.68, n = 23). The SS and the general species equations for this size fraction 

has a difference of 0.81 °C of temperature between them. When comparing with 

the 250 – 300 size fraction, the SS equations show a difference of 0.84 °C, while 

the GE equations show a difference of 0.72 °C between these two size fractions. 

 The G. ruber (w) s.s. species within the size fraction of 250 - 300 µm 

presented an average of 24.26 °C (± 0.59, n = 7) with the SS equation results. 

The GE equation shows an average of 26.26 °C (± 0.67, n = 7). The difference 

of temperature between the SS and the GE for the white s.s. in this size fraction 

is 2 °C. 

 For the G. ruber (w) s.s. within size fraction of 300 – 355 µm, when applied 

the SS equation, it is obtained 25.27 °C (± 0.66, n = 13). The GE results in 26.47 

°C (± 0.63). In this size fraction, the difference of temperature between the SS 

and the GE is 1.19 °C. When comparing with the previous size fraction, the 

difference between the SS equations is 1.01 °C, and the GE is 0.21 °C. 

 The calculated average using the SS equation for the G. ruber (w) s.l. 

species, 250 – 300 µm size fraction, is 23.86 °C (± 0.74). This species showed a 

difference of 1.95 °C when the SS and the GE equations are compared. 

 In the 300 – 355 µm size fraction, the G. ruber (w) s.l., the SS equation 

results in 24.89 °C (± 1.02, n = 16), while the GE equation shows an average of 

26.11 °C (± 0.97, n =16). This size fraction showed a difference of 1.21 °C 

between the two equations applied. Between size fractions, the SS equations 

have 1.03 °C of difference between them, and 0.29 °C for the GE equations. 

 The temperature obtained with the SS equation for the G. inflata species 

(300 – 425 µm) averaged 21.42 °C (± 1.56, n = 10). The highest temperature with 

this equation was 23.34 °C, and the lowest was 18.49 °C. While, the GE equation 

results in an average of 18.11 °C (± 1.01, n = 10), where the highest temperature 

was 19.35 °C, and the lowest was 16.23 °C. 

 The non-crusted type of G. truncatulinoides, 380 – 620 µm size fraction, 

with the SS equation resulted in 18.64 °C (± 1.03, n = 16). The GE equation 

resulted in 18.01 °C (± 1.03, n = 16). The difference of temperature between the 

SS and the GE equations estimates for the G. truncatulinoides NC is 0.63 °C. 

 The average calculated after the SS equation for the crusted type of G. 

truncatulinoides (380 – 620 µm) is 18.74 °C (± 0.97), and the GE equation 

resulted in 18.11 °C (± 0.97, p =14). The difference of temperature between the 



 

 

 
 

46 

equations for the G. truncatulinoides C is also 0.63 °C. These species showed 

the lowest difference between the equations for both crusted and non-crusted 

types, where the SS equations and the GE equations have a difference of 0.11 

°C between them.

2.5.4. Comparing Mg/Ca based-SSTs to modern ocean temperatures 

 

 The differences between the calculated SSTs after the SS and the GE 

equations of all species analyzed in this study are represented in Figure 12. 

 The calculated SSTs with the SS equation of the G. ruber (p), 250 – 300 

µm size fraction, showed significant similarity with SSTAN (p-value of 0.81), while 



 

 

 
 

47 

the GE equation showed significant similarity with SSTAU (p-value of 0.51). The 

SS equation for G. ruber (p), 300 – 355 µm size fraction, tests showed an average 

significantly similar to SSTAU (25.21 °C, ± 0.91, n = 23, p-value of 0.71), while the 

GE equation results do not show any significant averages with annual or seasonal 

SST. Yet, its average is 26.02 °C (± 0.68, n = 23, p-value &amp;lt;0.05), which is close 

to SSTSU. 

 The G. ruber (w) s.s., 250 – 300 µm size fraction, SS equation presented 

an average significantly similar to the SSTAN (p-value of 0.20), while the GE 

equation results have similar averages to SSTSU (p-value of 0.21). Both equations 

of the G. ruber (w) s.s., 300 – 355 µm size fraction, show significant similarities 

averages with SSTAN and SSTSU, respectively (p-value of 0.86 and p-value of 

0.55). On the other hand, the calculated average using both equations of the G. 

ruber (w) s.l., 250 – 300 µm size fraction, shows no siginficant similar averages 

to any modern SST. However, both calculated temperatures are still in the 

modern range of SST (23.86 °C and 25.81 °C, respectively), which are close to 

SSTWI and SSTAU temperatures, respectively. For the G. ruber (w) s.l., 300 – 

355 µm size fraction, the SS equation and the GE equation show significant 

results with SSTAU and SSTSU, respectively (p-value of 0.21 for both). 

 The temperature obtained with the SS equation for the G. inflata species 

(300 – 425 µm) show a strong simlarity with annual SSTs at 10 m depth (p-value 

of 0.89). The GE equation, however, shows no similarity with any temperature. 

 The non-crusted type of G. truncatulinoides, 380 – 620 µm size fraction, 

for both equations, shows no significant similar temperature averages. The 

crusted form shows a weak similarity of temperatures with the SS equation at 20 

m on SSTSU (p-value of 0.06).

2.6. Discussion 

2.6.1. Shallow-dwelling planktonic foraminifera from the SBB core-top 

samples and their Mg/Ca based-SST estimates   

 

Comparing the core-top Mg/Ca-SSTs with observed temperatures is 

important to determine how accurately the Mg/Ca proxy reflects local SST 

(HERTZBERG et al., 2013), and to identify where in the water column the 

foraminifera calcifies. Overall, the Mg/Ca-inferred SSTs averages obtained in this 

study showed consistent results when compared to modern SSTs. The results of 

this study shows that there are differences on the ratio Mg/Ca between the 

surface and subsurface species.  

The data suggest that the SS and the GE equation by Anand et al. (2003) 

result in different Mg/Ca-SSTs, such that the SS equation results in colder 

temperatures than the GE equation. Therefore, the discussion will be based on 

the results that showed the strongest similarities between the Mg/Ca-derived 

temperatures and the observational temperatures (e.g. highest p-values). 

Overall, for the G. ruber species, the larger size fraction had significantly 

higher Mg/Ca. Between the two size fractions of the pink form, there is a 

significantly difference between both averages (0.24 mmol/mol, p &amp;lt;0.05; Table 

25). On the other hand, even though in other regions the G. ruber (w) seems to 

have different incorporation of Mg+2 in their tests, the data from this study 

suggests that there is no significant difference on the Mg+2 and Ca+2 uptake by 

G. ruber (w) morphotypes and their size fractions (p &gt; 0.05; Table 25). 

Past studies have reported the increase in Mg/Ca with increasing test size 

for the pink form (RICHEY et al., 2012; FRIEDRICH et al., 2013), as well as the 

lack of difference in the Mg/Ca content in their white forms without discriminating 

then into s.s. and s.l. forms (RICHEY et al., 2012). In general, these studies 

hypothesize that foraminifera grow larger in warmer waters. Furthermore, the pink 

forms seem to calcify in shallower/warmer conditions than the white forms, which 

was also observe previously (e.g. RICHEY et al., 2012). More recently, Richey et 

al. (2019) stated that the larger tests of G. ruber are more abundant in warmer 

months, and smaller sizes, specially the white form, in colder months. The 

different test sizes seem to have different seasonal preferences, which may be 

the reason of the difference between test size and the uptake of Mg/Ca. 



 

 

 
 

49 

Sousa et al. (2014) reported that in their plankton tow off the Brazilian SE 

continental margin, during summer, the G. ruber pink was the most abundant 

species among the surface-dwelling species, inhabiting the first 20 meters of the 

water column. The G. ruber white species was also present and abundant in the 

first 20-meter depth, but, in some stations, they found them within 40- to 60-meter 

depth, and between 80- to 100-m depth. According to these authors, the depth of 

the mixed layer affects the presence and abundance of both species in the area. 

Converting the Mg/Ca into SSTs, the data from this study suggests that 

the smallest size of the pink form yields SSTAN estimates, while the s.s. form is 

more likely to reflect SSTSU temperatures. The s.l. form, however, did not show 

any strong similarity with any observational SST, but their results are closely to 

SSTWI temperatures. Within the bigger size fractions, all both pink and s.s. form 

reflect SSTAU. The s.l., is high related to both SSTAU and SSTSU estimates. forms, 

reflect SSTSU. 

In this study, the pink form within the biggest size seems to calcifies in 0.7 

± 0.4 °C warmer temperatures than the smallest size. This data that is presented 

here is consistent when compared to previous studies, where it was observed a 

significant difference in Mg/Ca-temperatures between the size fractions of the 

pink form only (RICHEY et al., 2012; FRIEDRICH et al., 2013), where the authors 

related the increase on temperature estimates with the increase of size to depth 

where the calcification of the tests takes place, which is influenced or by summer-

weighted seasonal distribution or shallower depth habitat. 

In general, the G. ruber is believed to be a summer-biased species, and 

the white forms an annual-biased species (KEMLE-VON-MUCKE AND 

HEMLEBEN, 1999; SCHIEBEL AND HEMLEBEN, 2017), where the s.l. type 

tends to record colder temperatures than the s.s. form (WANG, 2000; STEINKE 

et al., 2005). The results from both WOA13 and the satellite images show the the 

SST in autumn has warm temperatures, and it is not warmer than summer time 

only. The largest sizes show strong similarities in temperature averages with the 

SSTAU and SSTSU, which agree with previous statements. The white forms also 

present the increase on Mg/Ca according to shell size, but with no statistically 

difference between them. Yet, the s.l. within the smallest size is the one who 

derives the lowest temperatures within all shallow species. 



 

 

 
 

50 

Therefore, it is possible to suggest that, in the SBB, the smallest size of 

the pink forms inhabit the upper water column throughout the year, showing no 

seasonal preference; the s.s. form seems to calcifies in shallower waters, and it 

is a summer-biased species; the s.l. form is a cold-biased species, and it seems 

to relate more to winter time. The biggest sizes also seem to inhabit shallower 

waters, and all of them are warm-biased species, especially during autumn. 

 

 

2.6.2. The Mg/Ca based-temperatures derived from deep-dwelling 

planktonic foraminifera species in the SBB: What are the G. inflata and the 

G. truncatulinoides (d) forms recording in their Mg/Ca content? 

 

The G. inflata and the G. truncatulinoides (d) are deep-dwelling species 

(up to 400 m depth; GROENEVELD AND CHIESSI; FRANCO-FRAGAS, 2011), 

inhabiting greater depths in the water column than the G. ruber species (up tp 50 

m; SOUSA et al., 2014). Also, the forms crusted and non-crusted of the G. 

truncatulinoides can be used to trace different water depth habits with the crusted 

forms tending to record colder temperatures than the non-crusted form (e.g. 

SPEAR et al., 2011; SALMON et al., 2016; REYNOLDS et al., 2018). 

The data of this study shows that the G. inflata species have high 

temperature similarities with annual temperatures at 10 m depth (~20 °C) (Table 

26). This is very differently from presented by Groeneveld and Chiessi (2011) 

have found on their core-top samples collected in the South Atlantic (ranging from 

8 °S to 49 °S). These authors reported that the G. inflata ranges from 8 to 16 °C, 

and it calcifies ~ 387 m depth, recording permanent thermocline conditions. In 

the North Atlantic, Cléroux et al. (2007) reported that the G. inflata for their core-

top samples seem to respond to the base of the thermocline (&amp;lt;100 m depth), 

and that these species migrate to deeper waters when temperatures at high 

depths are above 16 °C. 

The data from this study shows great similarities with temperatures in 

much shallower depths than Groeneveld and Chiessi (2011), but much more 

similar to what Cléroux et al. (2007) have found. An explanation for the difference 

between the data from this study to Groeneveld and Chiessi (2011) results is that 

the samples retrieved in this study come from shallower depths than them. 



 

 

 
 

51 

Groeneveld and Chiessi (2011) retrieved their samples in open water (&gt; 3000 m), 

and they have a large latitudinal gradient and, therefore, larger temperature 

gradients as well. 

The samples from this study come mainly from the continental slope, which 

is much shallower. This area is highly influenced by meander and eddies caused 

by the Brazil Current, which uplifts the SAWC, the colder and nutrient-rich waters 

to shallower depths (SILVEIRA et al., 2000; CAMPOS, 2000; SILVEIRA et al., 

2008). Therefore, in the SBB on continental slope areas, the G. inflata seems to 

record annual temperature conditions at 10 m depth, as well as the influence of 

the vertical migration of the SAWC to the surface. The data reported in this study 

agrees with what Cléroux et al. (2007) have reported to the North Atlantic. 

The G. truncatulinoides (d) forms do not show any statistically differences 

on Mg/Ca in their tests. There is no difference as well when comparing the ratio 

from the G. inflata species to both C and NC forms of the G. truncatulinoides (d). 

Even though only the C form shows a weak similarity with summer temperatures 

at 20 m depth, the NC form does not show averages too different from the crusted 

form. 

Cléroux et al. (2008) found that the G. truncatulinoides and the G. inflata 

have similar calcifying depth preference. The data from this study shows that the 

difference of temperatures between both species is ~2 °C. In addition, both forms 

seem to fit in the SACW thermal structure (SILVEIRA, 2000). 

The NC form is closely related to annual temperatures at 20 m depth, while 

the C form is weakly related to the summer temperatures at 20 m. The difference 

between both forms have been discussed in previous studies (SPEAR et al., 

2011; SALMON et al., 2016; REYNOLDS et al., 2018). In this study, the Mg/Ca 

and temperatures are not statistically different from both forms. However, the NC 

seems to calcify in different conditions than the C form. The Figure 15 shows how 

related all the foraminifera analyzed in this study are to one another. Clearly the 

NC form fits into the surface species component (from here called warm-biased 

component), while the C and the G. inflata fit the second component (cold-biased 

component). 

The same trend has been reported by other studies in different areas. 

Spear et al. (2011) analyzed the geochemical signs of G. truncatulinoides in the 

northern Gulf of Mexico, and they found that the C forms calcify in deeper and 



 

 

 
 

52 

cooler waters, whereas the NC forms record winter mixed layer conditions. 

Salmon et al. (2016) noticed that in the Sargasso Sea, the C forms in their 

samples calcifies in much deeper depths throughout winter, and that the NC in 

calcifies surface waters, even at 0 m depth. Reynolds et al. (2018) used tests 

from sediment traps, and they also observed the different geochemical signals 

between both forms. 

All these authors related their results to the ontogeny and life cycle of the 

G. truncatulinoides forms, where, as the test becomes more matures, it migrates 

to deeper waters and evolves a secondary crust (encrustation) around the test 

with a different chemistry composition.  

In this study, the Mg/Ca ratios and temperatures are not statistically 

different from both forms. However, the G. truncatulinoides (d) NC form seems to 

calcify in different conditions than the G. truncatulinoides (d) C form. The G. 

truncatulinoides (d) NC form clearly fits into the surface species component (from 

here called warm-biased component), while the G. truncatulinoides (d) C and the 

G. inflata fit the second component (cold-biased component). Additionally, the G. 

inflata and both forms of the G. truncatulinoides (d) seem to reflect the SACW 

intrusion into the photic zone. The G. inflata and the G. truncatulinoides (d) C 

form seem to prefer to inhabit the thermal layer of the SACW, since their signals 

fits exactly in these temperatures (~16 °C), and the G. truncatulinoides (d) NC, 

seems to inhabit the upper base of the SACW (~18 °C), once it fits in-between 

surface and subsurface-dwelling species.  

In summary, the G. inflata and the G. truncatulinoides (d) tests in this study 

can be used to trace the vertical variation of the SACW in the SBB, especially the 

G. truncatulinoides (d) C form. The G. truncatulinoides (d) NC form seems to 

inhabit depths quite shallower than the C form.

2.7. Final Considerations 
 

 The Mg/Ca based-temperatures derived from all the planktonic 

foraminifera species (G. ruber (p), G. ruber (w) s.s., G. ruber (s) s.l., G. 

truncatulinoides (d) and G. inflata) analyzed in this study agree well with modern 

ocean temperatures. Our data suggests that in in different size fractions the 

tested species respond differently to the most used species-specific and general 

species paleotemperature equations. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy 

of future SST reconstructions, it is suggested to analyze what equation fits better 

in the area of the interest. 

 In the SBB, the most suitable equation for the G. ruber (p) species, in both 

the 250 - 300 µm and 300 - 355 µm size fractions, is the species-specific 

equation. Using this equation, the G. ruber (p) tests in the smallest size fraction 

reflect mean SSTAN conditions, while in largest size fraction tests reflect SSTAU. 

The Mg/Ca based-SST estimates derived from the 250 - 300 µm size fraction G. 

ruber (w) s.s. tests show significant results with modern SSTSU at 0 m, when the 

GE equation is applied, while for the 300 - 355 µm size fraction, the SS equation 

reflects SSTAU at 0 m. For the G. ruber (w) s.l. only the largest size fraction (300 

- 355 µm) tests present similarity with modern ocean SST, and both equations 

reflect SSTAU and SSTSU conditions at 0 m; the smallest size fraction in this G. 

ruber (w) morphotype can be used to trace cold-seasons, especially SSTWI at 0 

m. 

 The deep-dwelling species studies seem to reflect the uplift of the SACW 

into the surface waters in the SBB. The G. inflata apparently calcifies at 10 m 

water depth, and it can be used to trace the upwelling of the SACW, while the G. 

truncatulinoides (d) C form records the downwelling of the SACW during autumn 

(~20 m water depth), and the G. truncatulinoides (d) NC form records mean 

annual temperature in deeper water conditions. 

 This is the first study to report Mg/Ca ratios in surface-dwelling (G. ruber) 

and deep-dwelling (G. inflata and G. truncatulinoides (d)) planktonic foraminifera 

tests obtained in core-top samples in the SBB. This validation of the planktonic 

foraminifera Mg/Ca ratio conversion to temperature SS and GE equations for the 

surface-dwelling (G. ruber), and deep-dwelling (G. inflata and G. truncatulinoides 

(d) species in the SBB, will help to improve the accuracy of future temperature 



 

 

 
 

54 

reconstructions in the area. Also, to evaluate the suggestions made by this study, 

it is recommended to perform sediment trap analyses along the SBB.

3. Appendix 

3.1. The discrimination of the G. truncatulinoides (d) Crusted and Non-

crusted forms 

 

G. truncatulinoides (d) were discriminated into crusted (C) and non-

crusted (NC) forms for the Mg/Ca analyzes. For this, the tests were observed 

under a binocular microscope. This separation was determined because, in other 

regions, the C and NC test forms have been determined to calcify at different 

water depths (e.g., SPEAR et al., 2011; SALMON et al., 2016; REYNOLDS et al., 

2018), and because visual discrimination of both forms can be subjective.  

Once the C and NC tests were separated, every single NC test was 

measured across the diameter of the umbilical side, from the tip of the final 

chamber to the opposite side, as described by Reynolds et al. (2018) (Figure 13). 

After taking notes of the NC test lengths, they were individually weighed on a 

microbalance. This test was performed to observe if the C and NC G. 

truncatulinoides (d) tests have a distinct exponential length-weight relationship, 

as observed by Reynolds et al. (2018) in the Gulf of Mexico, where the NC tests 

are mostly lighter than the C tests. It is important to highlight that only a few C 

tests were measured and weighed after the first test with the NC tests. 

Electron images of a few tests of the discriminated C and NC forms were 

taken at the Electron Microscopy Laboratory at the University of South Florida, 

St. Petersburg (USFSP), in St. Petersburg, FL (USA) (Figure 14).

3.1.2 Distinction of Crusted from Non-crusted forms of G. truncatulinoides 

(d) 

 

 A general look of the data of the results of this methodology can be seen 

in Figure 15. 

 The NC tests of G. truncatulinoides (d) species in the 300 – 355 µm size 

fraction showed a mean length of 474 µm (± 37.32, n = 359), ranging from 380 

µm to 560 µm. The mean weight of the tests within this size fraction was 36.93 

µg (± 9.52, n = 359), as the lightest test weighed 12.5 µg and the heaviest test 

weighed 61.6 µg.  

 The NC tests of the size fraction between 355 – 425 µm presented a mean 

of 540 µm in their length (± 40.66, n = 202), where the test with the largest length 

measured 620 µm and the smallest test measured 400 µm. The weight of this 

size fraction showed a mean of 52.82 µg (± 10.88, n = 202), where the lightest 

test weighed 22.7 µg, and the heaviest test weighed 78.2 µg. 

 In the size fraction of 380 – 620 µm, the length average was 498.32 µm (± 

46.67, n = 561), as the smallest length was 380 µm and the biggest was 620 µm. 

The weight in this size fraction means 42.65 µg (± 12.60, n = 561), as the lightest 

test weighted 12.5 µg and the heaviest weighted 78.2 µg. 

 For the C forms, the length ranged from 420 µm to 580 µm (± 48.26, n = 

24), and the weight ranged from 23 µg to 68.2 µg (± 12.22, n = 24).

Figure 15 – Scatter plot of the length-weight relationship between the crusted (C) and non-crusted 
(NC) tests of G. truncatulinoides (d) of this research and from Reynolds et al. (2018). Besides 
presenting a low correlation between length and weight, the tests of this research project are 
located between the division of the C and NC tests observed by Reynolds et al. (2018). 
Consequently, the length-weight relationship cannot be applied to separate the C from NC tests 
in this research. 

 

 

The NC tests of G. truncatulinoides (d) do not present a significant 

difference between the both sieved size fractions (p &gt; 0.5). For this reason, the 

tests were placed as a single size fraction (300 – 425 µm), corresponding to the 

smallest test length to the largest length (380 – 620 µm) measured. Once it was 

decided to assemble the tests of G. truncatulinoides (d) in one size fraction (300 

– 425 µm), a batch of crusted tests form (C) (n = 24) was also measured and 

weighed to observe the length-weight relationship between the tests. 

 

 

3.1.3. The lack of difference of length-weight between the crusted and 

non-crusted forms of G. truncatulinoides (d) 

 

 The NC and the C tests of this research settle in the middle range of the 

NC and C tests found by Reynolds et al. (2018) (Figure 15). The length-weight 

correlation of C and NC tests found in this research are considerably low, where 

the R2 of NC length-weight was 0.49, and the R2 of C length-weight was 0.39.

Reynolds et al. (2018) found a high length-weight correlation between their G. 

truncatulinoides (d) C and NC tests (R2 = 0.73 and R2 = 0.68, respectively), which 

makes possible to differentiate the C and NC mathematically, avoiding visual 

errors.  

 This high correlation observed in this study may be linked to the fact that 

Reynolds et al. (2018) picked the most extreme examples of C and NC tests that 

were collected with a sediment trap and preserved in formalin. Thus, their tests 

have not sunk into the bottom of the ocean, and, consequently, they did not 

undergo any type of post-depositional process. 

 Apparently, in the SBB, the C and NC tests may have more aggregated 

material (such as crust and clay minerals) in their structures, as they sank into 

the bottom, which makes difficult to separate the C from NC tests as Reynolds et 

al. (2018) had performed. Differently than Reynolds et al. (2018), the samples of 

this research come from core-tops retrieved with a multiple-corer. These 

aggregate material can be a result of the long exposure of the sediments with the 

sediment-water interface, since the sedimentation rates in the SBB are lower than 

2 to 68 cm. kyr-1 (MAHIQUES et al., 2011). As a consequence, we conclude that 

these metrics derived from sediment-trap samples may not be applicable in 

marine sediments.  

 The G. truncatulinoides (d) tests for this research were, then, visually 

separated as C and NC under a binocular microscope taking as a reference to 

distinct them the color, brightness, opacity and the presence or absence of crust 

around the tests. 

 Therefore, it is suggested that in the SBB, for paleoceanographic studies 

using post-depositional material, to segregate the C and NC forms of the G. 

truncatulinoides species should be performed under a visual separation instead 

of the mathematical way, since the tests do not agree well with the length-weight 

relationship.
