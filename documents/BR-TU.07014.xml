Abstract 
 

The first part of this work aimed at characterizing bentonites 

of different features and origins (Brazil, Argentina, Italy and 

United States) that were submitted to functionalization with 

Ag, TiO2, Pd and Au nanoparticles. Either commercial (TiO2) 

or synthesized (Ag, Pd and Au) nanoparticles (NP) were used 

and characterized by DLS and XRD. Subsequently, the 

dispersed NP were impregnated on bentonite by two 

alternative methods, imbibition or dipping. The efficiency of 

impregnation of bentonite by metallic nanoparticles was tested 

by ICP-OES, which was over 90% in all cases. Particularly, 

Ag nanoparticles showed an impregnation efficiency above 

99%, as confirmed by SEM-FEG. To improve impregnation, a 

thermal pretreatment for the bentonites was necessary at 700 

°C. Both impregnation methods resulted in a suitable 

distribution and stability of Ag nanoparticles. The second part 

of this work aimed to obtain porous ceramic filters for water 

filtration with kaolinite and/or alumina, by pressing using rice 

husk like a sacrifice agent, and by freeze-casting with water. 

The powders were characterized by average particle size and 

distribution, zeta potential, XRD, XRF, density by 

picnometry, specific surface area (BET), and SEM. 

Parameters like viscosity, solidification rate, compression 

strength, porosity and permeability were analyzed. In the 

pressing method, samples with only kaolinite presented low 

porosity and low densification, while samples with only 

alumina have a high densification and very low porosity. The 

higher porosities occurred in samples with 35 to 60 wt% water 

and 20 to 30 wt%  rice husk (&lt;70 mesh). All the samples with 

kaolinite and alumina presented a good strength after contact 

with water, with flow rate less than 0.01 l/h. In the freeze-

casting method, firstly two alumina powders (coarse and fine) 

were tested with mean particle sizes of 2.5 and 0.5 µm, 

respectively. As the particle size decreases, the solidification 

rate also decreases, so the solidification rate is higher for 

coarse alumina. At around 50 wt% solids, the porosity of 

coarse alumina is slightly higher than that of fine alumina, 



 

14 

 

around 73 and 68%, respectively. Permeability parameters k1 

and k2 show that the pellets achieved the desired values for 

the application of ceramic filters for drinking water. 

Furthermore, coarse alumina was chosen and samples with 

alumina and kaolinite were produced and analyzed. Their 

filtration efficiency was evaluated using Colilert and Quanti-

Tray/2000. Samples with coarse alumina and kaolinite 

reached best results of compression strength with the higher 

values of k1 and k2, with pores with sizes distributed 

homogeneously between 1.04 and 2.73 µm. The filtrated 

water presented a total number of coliforms and E. coli 

reaching less than a half of the minimum value allowed for 

animal consumption and less than one eighth of the value 

allowed for recreation, with a turbidity around 0.56 NTU. The 

final filter pellets were impregnated with silver nanoparticles 

and the efficiency of impregnation and bactericidal effects 

were tested. Silver nanoparticles were characterized by 

average particle size, zeta potential and TEM. After 

impregnation, the leached water was analyzed by GFAAS that 

shows an efficiency of more than 99% in silver impregnation. 

From SEM/EDS, it was possible to observe that the pellets 

have a homogeneous distribution of silver nanoparticles. A 

halo of inhibition detected by the disc diffusion test shows a 

strong bactericidal effect of the filters.

Resumo 
 

A primeira parte deste trabalho teve como objetivo 

caracterizar bentonitas de diferentes propriedades e origens 

(Brasil, Argentina, Itália e Estados Unidos), que foram 

submetidas à funcionalização com nanopartículas de Ag, 

TiO2, Pd e Au. Nanopartículas comerciais (TiO2) e 

sintetizadas (Ag, Pd e Au) (NP) foram utilizadas e 

caracterizadas por DLS e DRX. Posteriormente, as NP 

dispersas foram impregnadas em bentonitas por dois métodos 

alternativos, imbibição ou imersão. A eficiência da 

impregnação das bentonitas por nanopartículas metálicas foi 

testada por ICP-OES, cujo resultado foi de mais de 90% em 

todos os casos. Particularmente, as nanopartículas de Ag 

mostraram uma eficiência de impregnação superior a 99%, 

conforme confirmado por MEV-FEG. Para melhorar a 

impregnação, foi necessário um pré-tratamento térmico para 

as bentonitas a 700 °C. Ambos os métodos de impregnação 

resultaram em uma distribuição e estabilidade adequadas das 

nanopartículas de Ag. A segunda parte deste trabalho teve 

como objetivo obter filtros cerâmicos porosos para filtração de 

água, utilizando caulinita e/ou alumina, através de prensagen, 

com o uso de casca de arroz como agente de sacrifício e 

freeze-casting, utilizando água. Os pós foram caracterizados 

por distribuição e tamanho médio de partículas, potencial zeta, 

DRX, FRX, densidade por picnometria, área de superfície 

específica (BET) e MEV. Foram analisados parâmetros como 

viscosidade, taxa de solidificação, resistência à compressão, 

porosidade e permeabilidade. No método de prensagem, 

amostras com apenas caulinita apresentaram baixa porosidade 

e baixa densificação, enquanto as amostras com apenas 

alumina possuem alta densidade e muito baixa porosidade. As 

porosidades mais altas ocorreram em amostras com 35 a 60% 

em peso de água e 20 a 30% em peso de casca de arroz (&lt;70 

mesh). Todas as amostras com caulinita e alumina 

apresentaram boa resistência mecânica após contato com 

água, com taxa de fluxo inferior a 0,01 l/h. No método de 

freeze-casting, primeiramente, dois pós de alumina, com 



 

16 

 

tamanhos médios de partículas de 2,5 e 0,5 ?m, 

respectivamente, foram testados. À medida que o tamanho de 

partícula diminui, a taxa de solidificação também diminui, de 

modo que a taxa de solidificação é maior para alumina de 2,5 

?m. Em cerca de 50% em peso de sólidos, a porosidade dessa 

alumina é ligeiramente superior à da alumina mais fina, 

aproximadamente 73 e 68%, respectivamente. Os parâmetros 

de permeabilidade k1 e k2 mostram que as pastilhas atingiram 

os valores desejados para a aplicação de filtros de cerâmica 

para água potável. Além disso, a alumina com 2,5 ?m foi 

escolhida, e amostras com alumina e caulinita foram 

produzidas e analisadas. Sua eficiência de filtração foi 

avaliada usando Colilert e Quanti-Tray/2000. As amostras 

com alumina e caulinita atingiram os melhores resultados de 

resistência à compressão com valores maiores de k1 e k2, com 

poros de tamanhos entre 1,04 e 2,73 ?m, distribuídos de forma 

homogênea. A água filtrada apresentou um número total de 

coliformes e E. coli que atingiu menos da metade do valor 

mínimo permitido para consumo animal e menos de um oitavo 

do valor permitido para recreação, com uma turbidez de cerca 

de 0,56 NTU. As pastilhas de filtro finais foram impregnadas 

com nanopartículas de prata e a eficiência de impregnação e 

efeitos bactericidas foram testados. As nanopartículas de prata 

foram caracterizadas pelo tamanho médio de partícula, 

potencial zeta e MET. Após a impregnação, a água lixiviada 

foi analisada por GFAAS que mostra uma eficiência superior 

a 99% na impregnação de prata. A partir de MEV/EDS, foi 

possível observar que as pastilhas têm uma distribuição 

homogênea de nanopartículas de prata. Um halo de inibição 

detectado pelo teste de difusão de disco mostra um forte efeito 

bactericida dos filtros.

1 Introduction 

 

The treatment of water is always a subject of interest 

due to the immense importance in human health. According to 

the World Health Organization (WHO), 80% of the diseases 

existent are caused by the intake of contaminated water. The 

risk of microbiological contamination of water for human 

consumption is the subject of many studies. The origin of 

contamination is related to water collection, transfer and/or 

storage (Clasen and Bastable, 2003; Lv et al., 2009; Simonis 

and Basson, 2011; WHO, 2006). 

One of the most efficient technologies, for water 

purification, is the use of ceramic filters. In this work, two raw 

materials, alumina and/or kaolinite, and two shaping 

techniques, respectively, pressing (with or without porogenic 

agents) or freeze casting were considered for manufacturing 

ceramic filters. Pressing was chosen due to simplicity, low 

cost, velocity and low energy, and freeze casting was selected 

because it is a versatile fabrication technique of porous 

structures, and generally offers a wider range of pore 

characteristics. 

Freezing casting has aroused great interest in the 

industry, due to its peculiar properties that it generates. In this 

technique, many factors influence the microstructure and 

properties of porous ceramics, like porosity and mechanical 

strength, such as composition and initial solids loading, 

cooling rate, sintering temperature, and additive content 

(Deville, 2008; Hu et al., 2010; Liu and Button, 2013). The 

particle size of the powders has an important effect on the 

final sample properties, but it has attracted little attention. 

Thus, in this work, two alumina powders, with particle size 

2.5 and 0.5 µm respectively, were tested to observe the 

influence of the particle size on freeze-cast porous bodies. 



 

28 

 

To increase the efficiency in the water filtration, an 

innovative approach for impregnation of porous ceramic 

pellets was tested with silver nanoparticles in order to 

optimize reactive surface area and to enhance bactericidal 

effects. Silver is often used as an antibacterial agent, in order 

to provide a sanitary environment for wound healing. The 

multiplicity of silver’s bactericidal mechanisms gives it a wide 

range of effective applications in the inhibition of bacterial 

growth. (Alexander, 2009; Nam et al., 2015; Bal et al., 2015; 

Dong et al., 2016; Mckevica et al., 2016; Amadio et al., 2017).

3 Literature review 

 

3.1 Water treatment  

 

The access to clean and safe water is of paramount 

importance for human health. It is estimated that in the 21st 

century more than one billion people will not have access to 

safe drinking water. Much of this population is concentrated 

in underdeveloped countries, especially in rural areas. Small 

communities have the most difficulty in receiving water in 

sufficient quantity and quality, the lack of maintenance and 

expansion of reservoirs coupled with the lack of supply and 

non-compliance with standards that define the water quality 

standard are some of the reasons why the population is 

exposed to diseases transmitted through the water (Mwabi et 

al., 2011). 

It is estimated that 4% of all deaths worldwide results 

from diarrhea caused by pathogenic bacteria present in waters 

considered unfit for human consumption. In South Africa, for 

example, diarrhea is responsible for 11% of the deaths of 

children under 5 years of age, in developing countries this 

number is even more significant increasing to 21%. According 

to the World Health Organization (WHO), 80% of the 

diseases existents are caused by the intake of contaminated 

water, the recommendation is that the water for human 

consumption contains a quantity of total coliforms 

corresponding to 0 in a 100 ml sample. The risk of 

microbiological contamination of water for human 

consumption is the subject of many studies. There is constant 

contamination during water collection, transfer and storage 

(Clasen and Bastable, 2003; Lv et al., 2009; Simonis and 

Basson, 2011; WHO, 2006).  



 

32 

 

There are many technologies for home water treatment 

and some of them are the subject of research in laboratories to 

evaluate the effectiveness in reducing pathogens and diseases 

such as diarrhea. One of the most efficient technologies is the 

manufacture of ceramic filters, which act efficiently as a 

barrier against pathogenic organisms. Disk filters produced by 

the organization Potters for Peace achieved expressive results 

as the reduction of 97.8% of Escherichia coli (Brown and 

Sobsey, 2010). 

Studies with 37 different water treatments indicate that 

ceramic water filters are among the five most effective 

treatments for turbidity reduction and a 99% reduction of 

bacteria in the laboratory, but this value becomes lower in 

field conditions. In developing countries household-scale 

ceramic filters are being used as a better treatment option for 

both unpurified and insufficiently disinfected water in 

households (Lantagne, 2001; Clasen and Boisson, 2006; 

Simonis and Basson, 2011). 

In a report of the WHO Commission on Health and 

Environment (undated), three mechanisms of transmittal for 

waterborne diseases are described (Lantagne, 2001): 

 

? Waterborne diseases 

These arise from the contamination of water by 

human or animal feces or urine infected by pathogenic viruses 

or bacteria, which are directly transmitted when the water is 

drunk or used in the preparation of food. 

? Water-washed diseases 

Scarcity and inaccessibility of water make washing 

and personal cleanliness difficult and infrequent. Where this is 

so some diarrheal diseases and contagious skin and eye 

infections are prevalent. All waterborne diseases can also be 



 

33 

 

water-washed diseases.  Water-washed diseases diminish 

whenever an adequate supply of water is available and used. 

? Water-based diseases 

Water provides the habitat for intermediate host 

organisms in which some parasites pass part of their life cycle. 

In addition, the WHO detailed the public health impact 

worldwide of waterborne diseases (Table 1). A number of 

diseases have not yet had morbidity, mortality, and population 

at risk statistics developed, however, the statistics that have 

been enumerated show that a significant fraction of the world 

population is both at risk for, and contracts, waterborne 

diseases (Lantagne, 2001). 

 

Table 1. Worldwide public health impact of waterborne 

disease (WHO, undated; Lantagne, 2001). 

 
 



 

34 

 

Thus, a number of different organisms of varying size 

and pathology contribute to waterborne disease throughout the 

world. Two mechanisms in the Potters for Peace (PFP) filter 

contribute to reduction of these organisms (Lantagne, 2001): 

? The first mechanism is filtration. The PFP filter will 
trap any particle or organism that is larger than the 

pore size of the filter. The pore size in the filter ranges 

are from 0.6 to 3.0 µm, PFP aims to have a pore size 

of 1 ?m to remove E. coli without the need for a 

disinfectant. This would trap a significant portion of 

bacteria, and all protozoa and helminthes. However, 

viruses are smaller than 1 ?m, and thus would not be 

trapped. The variation in pore size is due to the 

location of sawdust during burning. If the pore size is 

maintained at a maximum of three microns, it is 

expected that the PFP filter will remove a significant 

percentage of these protozoa (Lantagne, 2001). 

? The second mechanism is inactivation, in which 
colloidal silver is used in the PFP filter against 

organisms contributing to waterborne disease 

(Lantagne, 2001). 

 

3.2 Ceramic filters 

In recent years, ceramic filters have been widely used 

for microbiological treatment of water due to its low cost. 

Porous ceramics are manufactured from refractory oxides 

such as alumina, titania, zirconia. Briefly, the advantages of 

porous ceramics over other filtration techniques and materials 

are their chemical, thermal and pH stability, allied to the 

previous features there is also the longevity and strength to 

pressure, temperature and corrosion, bringing an excellent 

cost benefit (Lv et al, 2009; Bielefeldt et al, 2009). 

Ceramic water filters (CWFs) are manufactured, for 

example, by mixing clay with a pore forming agent such as 

sawdust or rice husk and a liquid, usually water. The filters 



 

35 

 

are molded in mechanical hydraulic presses or through the 

potter's wheel, then they pass into the sintering process, where 

the pore forming agent is eliminated as gas, leaving in the 

structure small interconnected pores (Yakub and Soboyejo, 

2012). 

Two primary mechanisms, physical removal and 

inactivation, are considered important in the microorganism 

disinfection by CWFs. First, in physical removal mechanism, 

filtration by size exclusion removes larger microorganisms 

such as protozoans and some bacteria and may be attributed to 

the initial filter pore sizes, as well as the solids filter cake that 

accumulates inside the filter. Surface association and the 

subsequent filter cake may also remove smaller bacteria and 

viruses (Bielefeldt et al, 2009). 

In the physical removal filtering mechanism, 

properties such as geometry and pore surface are of 

fundamental importance for the efficiency in the removal of 

microorganisms to levels indicated by the WHO. Porosity is 

the most used property to describe the pores of a material, 

being defined as a fraction of the total volume occupied by 

pores. (Yakub and Soboyejo, 2012; WHO, 2014; Youmoue et 

al., 2017). 

Additionally, in inactivation mechanism, ionic and 

nanoscale silver has been shown to inactivate pathogens, 

including bacteria and to a lesser extent viruses. The silver 

may inactivate pathogens that pass through the filter pores, 

may limit bacterial growth in the filter itself (bacteriostatic), 

or exert other effects of benefit to disinfection. Several studies 

have quantified the CWF removal of bacteria, such as fecal 

coliform or Escherichia coli, which serve as indicators of 

pathogenic microorganism disinfection. Laboratory studies 

have reported high pathogen disinfection efficiency for the 

new filters, with fresh silver coating (Brady et al., 2003; Cho 

et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2008; Zeng et al., 2007; Bielefeldt et 

al, 2009). 



 

36 

 

The ceramic matrix composition is fundamental in the 

resulting porosity of the material, since filters constructed 

with particle sizes ranging from 0.02 to 4 ?m can result in 34 

to 46% porosity. Pore size and geometry have great influence 

on porosity, interconnected pores with a size of 3 to 4 ?m tend 

to maximize hydraulic conductivity (Simonis and Basson et 

al., 2012; Youmoue et al., 2017). 

According to Yakub et al., the porosity of the filters 

increases with the increase in the percentage of organic 

material in the composition. In contrast, the mechanical 

strength to compression and bending decreases with 

increasing porosity; with the porosity increasing from 36 to 

46%, the compression strength decreases respectively from 

approximately 9 to 5 MPa. This decrease in compression 

strength value is due to the increase in sawdust content of 25-

50% in volume (Yakub and Soboyejo, 2012). 

Figure 1 illustrates low cost options that are being 

practiced in developing countries, namely the pot and disk 

filter elements respectively used by Potters for Peace and 

Filtron systems (Simonis and Basson, 2011).

Basson, 2011). 

 



 

37 

 

Porous ceramics are widely used in various versatile 

applications, such as liquid gas filters, catalysis supports, gas 

distributors, insulators, preforms for metal-impregnated 

ceramic metal composites, and implantable bone scaffolds 

(Scheffler and Colombo, 2005; Studart et al., 2006). 

Porous ceramics are advantageous in such application 

areas due to their high melting point, tailored electronic 

properties, and high corrosion and wear strength, which 

combine favorably with the features gained by the 

introduction of voids into the solid material (Kingery et al., 

1975; Princen and Kiss, 1989; Colombo and Hellmann, 2002; 

Guzman, 2003). 

These features include low thermal conductivity, 

controlled permeability, high surface area, low density, high 

specific strength, and low dielectric constant. These properties 

can be tailored for each specific application by controlling the 

composition and microstructure of the porous ceramic. 

Changes in open and closed porosity, pores size distribution, 

and pores morphology can greatly affect materials properties. 

These microstructural features are highly influenced by the 

processing route used to produce the porous material (Binks, 

2002; Colombo, 2006; Murray, 2007; Horozov, 2008; 

Neirinck et al., 2009). 

3.2.1 Methods to obtain porous ceramics 

Several processing routes using replica, sacrificial 

template, or direct foaming methods are nowadays available 

for the production of macroporous ceramics. The techniques 

differ greatly in terms of processing features and final 

microstructures/properties achieved (Studart et al., 2006). 

Figure 2 shows the scheme of possible processing routes used 

for the production of macroporous ceramics. 

 



 

38 

 

 

Figure 2. Processing routes used for the production of 

macroporous ceramics (Studart et al., 2006). 

3.2.1.1 Replica 

 

The replica method is based on the impregnation of a 

cellular structure with a ceramic suspension or precursor 

solution in order to produce a macroporous ceramic exhibiting 

the same morphology as the original porous material (Figure 

2a). This is followed by the removal of excess slurry, 

pyrolysis of the polymeric substrate, and sintering to solidify 

the foam. Many synthetic and natural cellular structures can 

be used as templates to fabricate macroporous ceramics 

through the replica technique (Binks, 2002; Studart et al., 

2006). 

Binders and plasticizers are also added to the initial 

suspension to provide ceramic coatings sufficiently strong to 

prevent the struts from cracking during pyrolysis. This process 

is explored fully elsewhere. The resulting ceramic is formed 



 

39 

 

after removal of the polymeric template (Binks, 2002; 

Colombo, 2006, Studart et al., 2006).  

The disadvantages of this technique are in the 

formation of the struts of the reticulated structure during 

pyrolysis of the polymeric template, which significantly 

weakens the mechanical strength of the resulting porous 

ceramic (Subramaniam, et al., 2006). 

The polymer replica technique is an easy and well-

established method to prepare open cellular structures with 

pore sizes ranging from 200 µm to 3 mm at porosity levels 

between 40 and 95%. A replica approach that uses wood 

structures as positive templates was developed in recent years. 

Highly oriented open pores ranging from 10 to 300 µm can be 

produced with this method at porosities between 25 and 95% 

(Studart et al., 2006). 

3.2.1.2. Sacrifical template 

 

The sacrificial template method is flexible and can 

employ various chemical compositions. Various oxides have 

been used to fabricate porous ceramics using starch particles 

as sacrificial templates. The sacrificial template technique 

usually consists of the preparation of a biphasic composite 

comprising a continuous matrix of ceramic particles or 

ceramic precursors and a dispersed sacrificial phase that is 

initially homogeneously distributed throughout the matrix and 

is ultimately extracted to generate pores within the 

microstructure (Figure 2b). This method leads to porous 

materials displaying a negative replica of the original 

sacrificial template, as opposed to the positive morphology 

obtained from the replica technique described by Studart et al. 

(2006). 

One of the main advantages of the sacrificial template 

method in comparison with the other fabrication routes is the 

possibility to deliberately tailor the porosity, pore size 



 

40 

 

distribution, and pore morphology of the final ceramic 

component through the appropriate choice of the sacrificial 

material. Figure 3 shows that the range of porosity and pore 

sizes that can be achieved with this technique is very broad 

(20–90% and 1–700 µm, respectively), as they only depend 

on the volume fraction and size of the sacrificial template 

used (Studart et al., 2006). 

The method of the sacrificial materials extraction from 

the consolidated composite depends primarily on the type of 

pore former employed. Predominantly open pores of various 

different morphologies can be produced with this method. 

The most crucial step in this technique is the removal of the 

sacrificial phase by pyrolysis, evaporation, or sublimation. 

These processes might involve the release of an excessive 

amount of gases and have to be carried out at sufficiently 

slow rates in order to avoid cracking of the cellular structure. 

The slow removal of the sacrificial phase may considerably 

increase the processing time in the case of large components. 

The mechanical strength of cellular structures produced with 

this method is often substantially higher than that achieved 

with the positive replica techniques (Aranberri et al., 2009; 

Studart et al., 2006). 

3.2.1.3. Direct foaming 

 

Porous ceramics properties are also highly influenced 

by their chemical compositions and microstructures, with 

porosity, pore morphology, and size distribution being 

tailored by different compositions, different physical 

structures of the starting materials, and the use of different 

amphiphiles (Aranberri  et al., 2009; Pokhrel et al., 2011; 

Sarkar et al., 2015). 

In direct foaming methods, porous materials are 

produced by incorporating air into a suspension or liquid 

media, which is subsequently set in order to keep the structure 

of air bubbles created (Figure 2c). In most cases, the 



 

41 

 

consolidated foams are after wards sintered at high 

temperatures to obtain high-strength porous ceramics. The 

total porosity of directly foamed ceramics is proportional to 

the amount of gas incorporated into the suspension or liquid 

medium during the foaming process. The pore size, on the 

other hand, is determined by the stability of the wet foam 

before setting takes place (Studart et al., 2006). 

Direct foaming methods offer an easy, cheap, and fast 

way to prepare macroporous ceramics with open or closed 

porosities from 40 to 97%. The pores produced with this 

approach result from the direct incorporation of air bubbles 

into a ceramic suspension, eliminating the need for extensive 

pyrolysis steps before sintering. The stabilization and setting 

of the wet foams is the decisive step in direct foaming 

methods. Foams stabilized with surfactants lead to porous 

ceramics exhibiting average pore sizes from 35 µm to 1.2 mm 

(Studart et al., 2006). 

The high stability of the wet foams allows their direct 

drying in ambient air at room temperature. However, in order 

to avoid cracking, the wet foams must be slightly 

strengthened to overcome the capillary stresses and to avoid 

differential shrinkage within the drying foam (Pokhrel et al., 

2011).

the replica, sacrificial templating, and direct foaming 

processing routes (Studart et al., 2006). 

3.2.1.4 Freeze -casting 

 

Interest in the effect of freezing on solutions and 

suspensions dates back at least to the beginning of the 20th 

century, when first qualitative observations were reported by, 

for example, Bobertag et al. (1908) and Lottermoser (1908). 

Lottermoser was probably among the first who described the 

formation of materials with honeycomb structures upon 

freezing. Bobertag et al. noted structural changes in the first 

frozen, then remelted material, which are due to the expanding 

ice crystals exerting forces on the matter, which, upon 

freezing, is expelled from the liquid carrier and trapped 

between the crystals. About 50 years later, Maxwell et al. 

(1954) described freeze casting as we understand it today. 

They reported the successful preparation of intricately shaped 

objects such as turbocharger blades from an extremely thick 

ceramic slip by casting, freezing and liquid sublimation before 

sintering (Wegst et al., 2010). 

The growing interest for the development of ceramic 

parts with hierarchical porosity exhibiting high mechanical 



 

43 

 

properties led the scientific community to focus on alternative 

shaping techniques to substitute the conventional foaming 

technique and the use of pore former precursors. Indeed, they 

are quite simple to implement but the organization of the 

resulting porosity remains random in most of the cases 

(Sepulveda, 1997; Studart et al., 2006). Even if new 

mathematical models for their presentation of the tortuosity 

have been recently given, it remains very difficult to model 

such random microstructures.  

Among the emerging techniques, freeze casting is an 

attractive shaping method for the fabrication of highly porous 

and hierarchically organized ceramic structures. It consists of 

freezing generally by the bottom a ceramic slurry followed by 

the sublimation of the solvent by freeze drying at both low 

pressure and temperature (Zhang et al., 2015; Gaudillere and 

Serra, 2016). 

Porous ceramics have a wide number of applications 

as catalyst carrier, ceramic filter, sensor, porous electrode, 

biomaterials, thermal barrier, among others. Freeze casting 

has many advantages, including small processing shrinkage, 

controllable and wide porosity range, and relatively high 

strength. Fukasawa et al. (2001; 2002) applied freeze casting 

to fabricate porous alumina and silicon nitride ceramics with 

unidirectionally aligned pore channels. Their work revealed 

the potentiality for fabricating porous ceramics, and a great 

deal of efforts has been subsequently put into practice 

(Deville, 2008; Hu et al., 2010). 

Freeze-casting has first been developed as a near net 

shape forming technique, yielding dense ceramics parts with 

fine replicate of the mold details. Any ice crystal being 

converted into porosity later on in the process, introducing 

large size defects were largely unwelcome in ceramic 

applications. A great deal of efforts has been put in controlling 

or avoiding the formation of ice crystals. Only later on was it 

realized that the formation and growth of ice crystals could be 



 

44 

 

a substantial benefit if properly controlled, yielding porous 

ceramics with a very specific porosity (Lu et al., 1998; Sofie 

and Dogan, 2001; Deville, 2008). 

Thus, freeze casting has received broad attention as a 

simple and versatile fabrication technique of porous 

structures, and generally offers a wider range of pore 

characteristics compared to other conventional fabrication 

methods such as foam or wood replication, direct foaming, 

and gel casting. Water and camphene are the most common 

solvents in freeze casting process (Deville et al., 2007; 

Fukushima et al., 2008; Yoon et al., 2008; Li and Li, 2012). 

The freeze casting of ceramic parts has the potential of 

being a simpler approach to produce complex-shaped ceramic 

parts. Freeze casting involves the preparation of a ceramic slip 

that is poured into a mold, then frozen and subjected to 

sublimative drying of the solvent under vacuum. Given the 

inherent strength of frozen solvents, this method allows them 

to temporarily act as a binder to hold the part together after 

demolding. This, therefore, minimizes the additive 

concentration for enhanced solid purity and faster binder 

burnout cycles. Removal of the solvent by sublimation also 

eliminates drying stresses and shrinkage that may lead to 

cracks and warping during the normal drying of a solvent-

saturated body (Sofie and Dogan, 2001). 

The freezing of the ceramic slurry induces the 

growing of vertical solvent crystals along the freezing 

direction and the associated ceramic particles are entrapped 

between these crystals (Figure 4). Finally, the as-obtained 

green body after solvent removal by freeze-drying is sintered 

for consolidation and the final freeze-cast sample exhibits 

hierarchically and vertically aligned porosity, which is the 

replica of the original solvent crystals (Gaudillere and Serra, 

2016).

freezing step and the associated distribution of ceramic 

particles between the ice crystals (Gaudillere and Serra, 2016). 

The control of pore structure is performed through 

composition and solid loading of slurry, as well as sintering 

conditions, which influence the microstructure and properties 

of porous ceramics fabricated by freeze casting (Hu et al., 

2010). 

Figure 5 shows the schematic representation of a 

freeze casting system and pore structure formation during 

freeze casting (Hu et al., 2010).

Figure 5. Schematic illustration of freeze casting system and 

pore structure formation during freeze casting (Hu et al., 

2010). 

According to Deville, the process can be divided into 

four steps (Figure 8), and the corresponding experimental 

conditions will strongly depend on the chosen solvent.  

a) Preparation of the slurry 

 

The ceramic powder must be correctly dispersed in 

the liquid medium (the solvent), so that dispersant and 

plasticizer are often used. The temperature of the slurry must 

fall in the range where the solvent is liquid, room temperature 

in the case of water, but different temperatures (60 °C and 8 

°C) are necessary for respectively camphene-based and tert-

butyl alcohol slurries. Moderate solid loading is used (10–40 

vol%), depending of the desired amount of total porosity. The 

stability of the suspension must be carefully controlled to 

avoid any segregation taking place in the second stage, 

yielding gradients of density and porosity in the final 

materials. This can be particularly problematic for low solid 



 

47 

 

loadings. Finally, the presence of a binder is necessary, to 

provide green strength after sublimation. Though the solvent 

is playing the role of the structuring agent, binder and pore 

forming agent, it is nevertheless removed during the 

sublimation stage, so that green bodies collapse in absence of 

an organic binder (Deville, 2008). 

Ceramic slurries for freeze casting are typically 

composed of micro or nanometric particles suspended in water 

to which dispersants (e.g. polyacrylates) and binders (e.g. 

polyvinyl alcohol) are commonly added. Dispersants, which 

can be anionic, cationic or neutral and which depend on the 

liquid carrier and particles suspended in it, reduce particle 

aggregation and flocculation. Both are undesirable because 

they lead to heterogeneities in the final product and they 

change the slurry’s physical properties such as its 

sedimentation behavior and viscosity (Fu et al., 2008; Wegst 

et al., 2010). 

For a given particle size, the viscosity depends on the 

type of interaction between particles and liquid carrier, 

whether by van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds or polar 

interactions. For a given type of interaction, the viscosity 

depends on the particle size. In the case of van der Waals 

forces, for example, the forces grow with molecular weight 

and particle size; the higher the molecular weight or the larger 

the agglomerate, the higher the forces and the higher the 

viscosity. For a given particle size, an increase in solid-

volume fraction has the same effect, because the particles are 

more closely packed, resulting in more and stronger particle–

particle interactions increasing the strength to flow. The 

viscosity of the slurry is a particularly important processing 

parameter in freeze-casting. It determines, for a given particle 

size, both the velocity of sedimentation and the critical 

freezing-front velocity at which particle trapping occurs 

during solidification. Viscosity is thus a structural parameter 

that determines the material’s structural and mechanical 

properties (Wegst et al., 2010). 



 

48 

 

b) Controlled Solidification of the Slurry 

 

This is the critical stage where the structure is formed 

and the characteristics of the future porosity are determined. 

During this stage, continuous crystals of solvent are formed, 

under certain conditions, and grow into the slurry. Ceramic 

particles in suspension in the slurry are rejected by the moving 

solidification front, concentrated and entrapped in-between 

the crystals. To induce this natural segregation phenomenon, 

the slurry is poured in a mold, which undergoes isotropic or 

anisotropic cooling to induce homogeneous or directional 

solidification. The solidification conditions are dictated by the 

initial choice of the solvent. Low temperatures (&amp;lt;0 °C) are 

required when using water, while room temperature are 

sufficient when using camphene, its solidification point being 

around 44–48 °C (Deville, 2008). 

c) Sublimation of the Solvent  

Once complete solidification of the sample is 

achieved, the sample is kept at conditions of low temperature 

and reduced pressure, conditions dictated by the physical 

properties of the solvent. Under these sublimation conditions, 

the solidified solvent is converted into the gas state. Porosity 

is created where the solvent crystals were, so that a green 

porous structure is obtained; the porosity is a direct replica of 

the solidified solvent structure. When using water, a 

conventional freeze-dryer can be used. In the case of 

camphene, the vapor pressure of 1.3 kPa (just below the 

melting temperature) is high enough to allow sublimation at 

room temperature, so that no specific equipment is required 

(Deville, 2008). 

Figure 6 shows three first steps of freeze-casting 

process in a graphic with pressure (atm) versus temperature 

(°C), where in point A, there is a ceramic slurry (liquid state), 

in point B, the temperature decreases until having  ice crystals 

and ceramic particles (solid state), staying in -70 °C (ultra-

freezer temperature) and pressure 1 atm, after that, the solid 



 

49 

 

sample were taken to the freeze-dryer to do the lyophilization, 

point C, with -50 °C and 0.39 atm until the water, before ice 

crystals, go out of the structure (gas state), the final structure 

has the pores and the ceramic particles, point D.

state); C) Low temperature and pressure until the water, 

before ice crystals, go out of the structure (gas state); D) final 

structure with pores and the ceramic particles (Source: 

Author). 

d) Sintering or Densification of the Green Body 

Once the solvent has been totally removed, the 

obtained green body can be sintered with conventional 

sintering technique. The low strength of the green body 

prevents any use of pressure assisted sintering (Deville, 2008). 

The porosity of the sintered materials is a replica of 

the original solvent crystals. A variety of pores morphology 

can be obtained, depending on the choice of the solvent, 



 

50 

 

slurries formulation and the solidification conditions (Figure 

7). Since the solidification is often directional, the porous 

channels run from the bottom to the top of the samples. 

Homogeneous freezing (i.e., cooling at constant rate starting 

from room temperature) results in a more homogeneous ice 

nucleation leading to a lamellar porous architecture (Figure 

7B), with long-range order, both in the parallel and 

perpendicular directions of the ice front. After sintering, the 

ceramics walls can be completely dense with no residual 

porosity, depending on the sintering conditions. In the 

particular case of water being used as a solvent, the 

microstructure is lamellar, with lamellar channels between the 

ceramics walls (Araki and Halloran, 2004; Araki and 

Halloran, 2005; Deville et al., 2007; Yoon et al, 2007; Deville, 

2008).

camphor/naphthalene as a solvent (b) porous alumina using 

water as a solvent (c) porous silicon carbide using 

polycarbosilane as a precursor and camphene as a solvent and 

(d) porous alumina using camphene as a solvent (Deville, 

2008). 



 

51 

 

e)  Orientation of Macroporosity 

The pore channels can be oriented, depending on the 

solidification conditions. In most of the cases, the mold in 

which the slurry is initially poured is left with its bottom in 

part in contact with a cold surface. The solvent crystals are 

therefore solicited to grow vertically, along the direction of 

the imposed thermal gradient. However, different thermal 

gradients can be imposed, to induce a different anisotropy in 

the structure. many factors affecting the porosity and 

mechanical properties of the final porous ceramic, such as 

initial solids loading, cooling rate, sintering temperature, and 

additive content (Deville, 2008; Liu and Button, 2013). 

3.2.2 Raw materials for porous ceramics 

 

3.2.2.1 Clay minerals 

 

Bentonite is a plastic and colloidal clay consisting 

essentially of montmorillonite and other minerals of the 

smectite group, with other components such as kaolinite, ilite, 

feldspars, amphiboles, cristobalite and quartz. The total non-

clay content of the bentonite is hardly less than 10%. Such 

components present varying colors, such as: white, gray, 

yellow, brown, green and blue (Grim, 1968). 

Smectite is the term given to a group of minerals 

consisting of: montmorillonite, beidelite, nontronite, hectorite 

and saponite. Each mineral forms a similar structure, though 

chemically different. Nontronite, for example, is an iron-rich 

smectite and hectorite is rich in lithium. The most common 

mineral in the economical deposits of the smectite group is 

montmorillonite, which is the predominant mineral in the 

composition of bentonites. In industry, montmorillonites are 

generally classified as sodium (Na) or calcium (Ca), 

depending on the predominant exchangeable ion (Hassan and 

Abdel-Khalek, 1998; Paiva et al., 2008). 



 

52 

 

 The smectites are hydrated aluminosilicates of 

aluminum, iron and magnesium, in proportions 2:1 (two 

tetrahedron silica-oxygen layers, and the octahedral layer of 

metal-oxygen between them) (Holtzer et al., 2011). 

 The general chemical formula of montmorillonite is 

Mx(Al4-xMgx)Si8O20- (OH)4, where M
+1 is a monovalent 

cation. It has particles of sizes that can vary from 0.1 to 2 ?m, 

and format of plates or blades (Silva; Ferreira, 2008). Figure 8 

shows the structure of two lamellae of montmorillonite. 

 

Figure 8. Structure of two lamellae of montmorillonite 

(Arshak et al., 2004). 

The term bentonite, according to the literature, was 

first applied to a type of plastic and colloidal clay from a rock 

discovered at Fort Benton, Wyoming, USA. Although 

originally the term bentonite referred to the discovered clay 



 

53 

 

rock, at the moment it designates clay constituted, mainly, of 

the clay mineral montmorillonite. This term is also used to 

denote a product with high smectite content (Luz; Lins, 2008). 

As a geological and petrographic term, bentonite is a 

rock formed from volcanic ash altered and largely composed 

of montmorillonite of the smectite type. It has great ability to 

absorb water and swell (Bulut et al., 2009). 

Bentonites belong to an important type of clays 

widely used in many sectors of industry, such as drilling of oil 

wells and water collection, various foundries, pelletizing of 

iron ore, chemical and pharmaceutical industries (Amorim et 

al., 2006).  

Bentonites are mostly calcic or sodic, and sodic 

expand many times their volumes when in contact with water, 

forming thixotropic gels. Some cations cause an expansion so 

intense that the layers of crystals can be separated up to their 

unit cell. Sodium causes the most notable expansion. The 

calcic and sodic varieties, based on exchangeable cation, are 

the most abundant bentonites. If the cation is Na+, the 

swelling may progress from 12.5 Å, when the clay is exposed 

to air, to a maximum of 40.0 Å, when the clay is fully 

dispersed in a liquid medium (Lummus and Azar, 1986).  

The sodic natural bentonites, such as those found in 

Argentina, can withstand temperatures up to 620 °C. The 

activated bentonites withstand about 450 °C. (Mariotto, 2005; 

Amadio et al., 2017).  

3.2.2.2 Kaolinite 

 

Kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4) is one of the most abundant 

natural minerals in soils and sediments, normally associate to 

clays, and particularly to kaolin. I; it is a dioctahedral 1:1 

phyllosilicate formed by superposition of silicon tetrahedral 

sheets and aluminum octahedral sheets. Adjacent layers are 



 

54 

 

linked by van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds. This 

interlayer induces restricted access to the interlamellar 

aluminol groups (Al-OH) that may be used for grafting 

reactions.  

Kaolinite is a clay with a theoretical chemical 

composition, expressed as a mass percentage of oxides, of 

39.50% of Al2O3, 46.54% of SiO2 and 13.96% of H2O, it may 

have variations in its composition (Gu and Evans, 2008; 

Magriotis et al., 2010; Cheng, et al., 2012; Caglar, 2012).  

Figure 9 shows a schematic of the kaolinite structure. 

 

Figure 9. Schematic view of the structure of kaolinite (Cheng 

et al., 2012). 

Kaolinite is a material with a wide variety of 

applications in the paper industry, where it serves as the filler 

material and in the ceramic coating tile industry where it is 

used as a pigment for coatings. It is used as an extender in 



 

55 

 

aqueous based paints and inks, a functional additive in 

polymers and is a major component in traditional ceramic 

bodies. Its great use is also largely due to the chemical 

inertness over a large pH range, easy dispersion, coating 

capacity when used as pigment and reinforcement when used 

as a filler. Moreover, it presents high adhesion compatibility, 

and low thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity 

(Cheng et al., 2012). Table 2 shows some values of physical 

and chemical properties of kaolin found in the literature. 

 

Table 2. Selected physical and chemical properties of kaolin 

(Pereira and Silva, 2001; Horpibulsuk et al., 2011). 

  

The most reactive functional groups in kaolinite are 

hydroxyl groups, which are capable of taking part in many 

chemical reactions as well as ion exchange processes. It is the 

most abundant mineral of the kaolinite group (including 

dickite, nacrite, and halloysite). Depending on the application, 

kaolinite is often modified from its natural state by physical or 

chemical treatment to enhance the properties of the material 

(Cheng et al., 2012).

3.2.2.3 Alumina 

 

Alumina is the inorganic product most used in the 

industry to obtain aluminum and ceramic products, it is 

obtained through the Bayer process, which is based on the 

physical processing of bauxite, with the presence of additives 

such as caustic soda at high temperatures and pressures, 

followed by clarification, precipitation, calcination, grinding 

and sizing. The structural formula of alumina is Al2O3 and it 

has only one stable natural crystallographic, the form ?- Al2O3 

called corundum (Reed, 1995; Riedel and Chen, 2010). 

Figure 10 shows the crystallographic structure of 

alumina, with O2- ions forming a compact hexagonal crystal 

structure and Al3+ cations filling the octahedral interstices 

(Riedel and Chen, 2010). 

 

Figure 10. Corundum crystalline structure (Riedel and Chen, 

2010). 

Alumina ceramics are relatively low cost, and the 

ceramic components may be manufactured with high output  



 

57 

 

using different methods, e.g. by slip casting, pressing, or 

injection molding, without the use of expensive equipment 

such as kilns with special controlled atmosphere. These 

ceramics have a high level of mechanical properties; for 

example, some materials can be successfully used in abrasion 

and erosion environments; armor systems based on some 

kinds of alumina ceramics can defeat high-velocity projectiles 

with steel, lead and even tungsten carbide cores. 

(Medvedovski, 2006). Table 3 shows some physical, 

mechanical and thermal properties of alumina after sintering.

Alumina is an excellent thermal and electrical 

insulator. In its crystalline form, called corundum, it has 

enough hardness to be used as an abrasive and as a component 

of cutting tools (Handbook, 2002). 

Alumina is among the materials most resistant to high 

temperatures as well as it presents a high wear and corrosion 

strength and low coefficient of thermal expansion (Wood and 

Harris, 2008). 

3.2.2.4 Silica from rice husk 

 

Rice husk is one of the industrial byproducts of rice, a 

major food source around the world. It is one of the 

agricultural “waste” materials available in plenty in rice 

producing countries, which is amenable for value addition. It 

is reported that for every ton of rice produced, ?0.23 tons of 
rice husk is formed. 

If rice husk can be used profitably through value 

addition, benefits will contribute to economic and social 

development particularly in developing countries. Value 

addition of any material including “wastes” is based on the 

clear understanding of its structure and properties.  

Rice husk is an abundantly available waste material in 

all rice producing countries. In certain regions, it is sometimes 

used as a fuel for parboiling paddy in the rice mills. Rice husk 

consists of organic materials (e.g. cellulose, hemicellulose 

and lignin) (~75 wt%), amorphous silica (~15 wt%) and 

water (~10 wt%).  (Chandrasekhar et al., 2003; Wu et al., 

2009). 

On thermal treatment, SiO2 converts to cristobalite, 

which is a crystalline form of silica. However, under 

controlled burning conditions, amorphous silica with high 



 

59 

 

reactivity, ultra-fine size and large surface area is produced. 

This so-called microsilica can be a raw material for advanced 

materials like SiC, Si3N4, elemental Si and Mg2Si. Due to the 

high pozzolanic activity, this rice husk silica also finds 

application in high strength concrete as a substitute for silica 

fume. Possibility of using this silica as filler in polymers has 

been also studied. Rice husk powders can be used as well as 

an additive to produce porous structures (Chandrasekhar et al., 

2003; Wu et al., 2009). 

The chemical composition of rice husk is found to 

vary from sample to sample. The differences in the type of 

paddy, crop year, climatic and geographical conditions, in 

addition to the sample preparation and method of analysis, 

could be the reason for this variation (Chandrasekhar et al., 

2003, Jain et al., 1997). A typical chemical composition of 

rice husk (organic components) is shown in Table 4.

3.2.2.5 Silver nanoparticles 

Silver is a soft, malleable metal, which is stable in 

water and oxygen but attacked by sulfur compounds in air to 

form a black sulfide layer (CRC, 1997). The atomic number of 

silver is 47, its atomic weight is 107.868, and it exists in its 

common valence states of Ag+, Ag2+, and the mineral form of 

argentite, Ag2S. Typical ambient concentrations of silver are 

presented in Table 5. Silver is present throughout the 

environment in small concentration (milligram to nanogram), 

but is not essential for animal or plant life (Lantagne, 2001). 

 

Table 5. Typical Ambient Concentrations of Silver (adapted 

from CRC, 1997; Lantagne, 2001).

 

The daily dietary intake by humans is estimated at 

0.0014 to 0.08 mg. When the maximum CRC intake per day 

(0.08 mg) is calculated over a 70-year lifetime, a total of 2.0 

grams of silver are ingested per person per lifetime (0.08 

mg/day x 365 days/year x 70 years = 2.0 grams/lifetime). 

Toxic intake for humans is 60 milligrams, while a lethal 

intake is 1.3 to 6.2 grams (CRC, 1997; Lantagne, 2001). 

Nanosized inorganic particles, of either simple or 

composite nature, display unique properties and represent an 

increasingly important material in the development of novel 

nanodevices, which can be used in numerous physical, 



 

61 

 

biological, biomedical, and pharmaceutical applications. A 

number of recent achievements offer the possibility of 

generating new types of nanostructured materials with 

designed surface and structural properties (Sondi and Salopek-

Sondi, 2004). 

Nanomaterials are systems that at least one dimension 

is 1–100 nm in length with particular physical and chemical 

properties and can be used in numerous applications. 

Particularly silver, in the form of nanoparticles has efficient 

antimicrobial properties (Singh and Nalwa, 2011; Dash et al., 

2012; Leon-Silva et al., 2016; Díaz-Soler et al., 2017). 

Such powders can exhibit properties that differ 

substantially from those of bulk materials, as a result of small 

particle dimension, high surface area, quantum confinement 

and other effects. Most of the unique properties of 

nanoparticles require not only the particles to be of nano-

sized, but also the particles be dispersed without 

agglomeration. Discoveries in the past decade have clearly 

demonstrated that the electromagnetic, optical and catalytic 

properties of silver nanoparticles are strongly influenced by 

shape, size and size distribution, which are often varied by 

varying the synthetic methods, reducing agents and stabilizers 

(Abou El-Nour et al., 2010). 

Silver is often used as an antibacterial agent, in order 

to provide a sanitary environment for the wound healing 

process. It is considered historically as one of the most 

frequently used antibacterial substances before the invention 

of antibiotics. The multiplicity of silver’s bactericidal 

mechanisms gives it a wide range of effective applications in 

the inhibition of bacterial growth. The introduction of 

nanoparticles has allowed the scientific community to enhance 

the antibacterial properties of silver. The increased surface 

area of the nanoparticles in turn induces an increased rate of 

interaction between the test subjects and the ionic silver 



 

62 

 

(Alexander, 2009; Nam et al., 2015; Bal et al., 2015; Dong et 

al., 2016; Mckevica et al., 2016; Amadio et al., 2017). 

Strength of bacteria to bactericides and antibiotics has 

increased in recent years due to the development of resistant 

strains. Some antimicrobial agents are extremely irritant and 

toxic and there is much interest in finding ways to formulate 

new types of safe and cost-effective biocidal materials. 

Previous studies have shown that antimicrobial formulations 

in the form of nanoparticles could be used as effective 

bactericidal materials (Sondi and Salopek-Sondi, 2004). 

Stoimenov and co-workers demonstrated that highly 

reactive metal oxide nanoparticles exhibit excellent biocidal 

action against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 

Thus, the preparation, characterization, surface modification, 

and functionalization of nanosized inorganic particles opens 

the possibility of formulation of a new generation of 

bactericidal materials. It is well known that silver ions and 

silver-based compounds are highly toxic to microorganisms 

showing strong biocidal effects on as many as 16 species of 

bacteria including E. coli (Stoimenov et al., 2002; Sondi and 

Salopek-Sondi, 2004). According to WHO (World Health 

Organization) (WHO, 2014): 

? The retention rate of silver in humans and animals is 
under 10% percent. The retained silver is mainly 

stored in the liver and skin. The half-life of silver in 

the liver is 50 days. 

? Silver is occasionally found naturally in ground and 
surface water at 5 ?g/L. 

? Average human intake of silver is 7.1 ?g/day. 

? The acute lethal dose of silver nitrate is a minimum of 
10 g. 

? Argyria is the only known human health effect of 
silver, and is a condition in which silver is deposed on 

skin and hair. 



 

63 

 

The U.S. EPA has also investigated silver to 

determine appropriate drinking water standards and it 

recommends a maximum intake of 5 ?g/kg/day. In the average 

70-kilogram adult, this is equivalent to 350 ?g/day. This 

recommendation was established to prevent argyria, a 

medically benign but permanent bluish-gray discoloration of 

the skin. Argyria results from the deposition of silver in the 

dermis and also from silver-induced production of melanin. 

Argyria is more pronounced in areas exposed to sunlight due 

to photoactivated reduction of the metal, and although the 

deposition of silver is permanent, it is not associated with any 

adverse health effects. In addition, no evidence of cancer in 

humans has been reported despite frequent therapeutic use of 

the compound over the years. Silver was used for centuries to 

treat syphilis, and as an astringent in topical preparations. 

(U.S. EPA, 1999). 

Argyria has been described in syphilitic patients in 

poor health who were therapeutically dosed with a total of 

about 1 g of silver in the form of silver arsphenamine together 

with other toxic metals. There have been no reports of argyria 

or other toxic effects resulting from the exposure of healthy 

persons to silver. On the basis of present epidemiological and 

pharmacokinetic knowledge, a total lifetime oral intake of 

about 10 g of silver can be considered as the human NOAEL 

(no observed adverse exposure limit). As the contribution of 

drinking water to this NOAEL will normally be negligible, the 

establishment of a health based guideline value is not deemed 

necessary. On the other hand, special situations may exist 

where silver salts are used to maintain the bacteriological 

quality of drinking water. Higher levels of silver, up to 0.1 

mg/L (a concentration that gives a total dose over 70 years of 

half the human NOAEL of 10 g), could then be tolerated 

without risk to health  (WHO, 2014).  

Generally, specific control of shape, size, and size 

distribution is often achieved by varying the synthesis 



 

64 

 

methods, reducing agents and stabilizers (Yeo et al., 2003; He 

et al., 2004; Abou El-Nour et al., 2010). 

Metal nanoparticles can be prepared by two routes, the 

first one is a physical approach that utilizes several methods 

such as evaporation/condensation and laser ablation. The 

second one is a chemical approach in which the metal ions in 

solution is reduced in conditions favoring the subsequent 

formation of small metal clusters or aggregates (Khomutov 

and Gubin, 2002; Oliveira et al., 2005; Abou El-Nour et al., 

2010). 

Characterization of nanoparticles is important to 

understand and control nanoparticles synthesis and 

applications. It is performed using a variety of different 

techniques such as transmission and scanning electron 

microscopy (TEM, SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), 

dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray photoelectron 

spectroscopy (XPS), powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD), 

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and UV–Vis 

spectroscopy (Khomutov and Gubin, 2002; Yeo et al., 2003; 

He et al., 2004; Abou El-Nour et al., 2010).

4 Motivation, novelty and structure of the thesis 

4.1 Motivation and novelty 

 

Table 6 shows selected works performed in the last 20 

years on fabrication and characterization of porous ceramic 

filters for water purification, with some respective 

performance parameters.  

In the majority of the works mentioned, pressing was 

used as shaping technique. Freeze casting is generally used for 

other applications. The closest approach regarding our focus 

in this work, with the similar parameters, was that of Li and Li 

(2012). Nevertheless, they used TBA (tert-butyl alcohol) as a 

solvent instead of water, which increases the cost and toxicity 

of the process. This work presents as novelty the idea of 

fabricating water filter by freeze-casting using alumina and 

kaolinite aqueous slurries.

4.2 Thesis structure 

 

This thesis was structured in five main chapters: 

? Bentonites functionalized by impregnation with TiO2, Ag, 

Pd and Au nanoparticles 

This part of the work was carried out at ISTEC/CNR, 

Italy. It aimed to characterize bentonites with different 

features and origins (Brazil, Argentina, Italy and United 

States) that were impregnated with Ag, TiO2, Pd and Au 

nanoparticles. Either commercial (TiO2) or synthesized (Ag, 

Pd and Au) nanoparticles (NP) were used and characterized 

by DLS and XRD. Subsequently, the dispersed NP were 

impregnated on bentonite by two alternative methods, 

imbibition or dipping. The efficiency of impregnation of 

bentonite by metallic nanoparticles was finally tested by ICP-

OES.  

? Fabrication of pressed porous ceramic filters for water 

purification with kaolinite and/or alumina  

In this chapter, the work aimed to obtain porous ceramic 

filter with kaolinite and/or alumina, by pressing, using rice 

husk as a sacrificial agent, for water filtration. Rice husk was 

characterized by TG, DSC and SEM. Many compositions 

were tested with kaolinite and/or alumina, with or without rice 

husk, and with and without water. The mechanical strength 

was measured by compression tests, and pre-tests of 

permeability of the final pellets were performed.  

? Influence of alumina particle size on the performance of 

freeze-cast filters 

This chapter aimed to verify the influence of the particle 

size on freeze cast filters. Two alumina powders (coarse and 

fine) of the same kind and from the same manufacturer were 



 

68 

 

used, corresponding to particle sizes of 2.5 and 0.5 µm 

respectively. It was intended to analyze what is the more 

suitable for freeze-casting for the application of ceramic filter 

for drinking water (pellets). The powders of alumina were 

characterized by average particle size and distribution, zeta 

potential, XRF, density by picnometry, specific surface area 

(BET), and SEM. Parameters like rheology, solidification 

rates, compression resistance, porosity and permeability were 

analyzed.  

? Fabrication of freeze-cast porous alumina/kaolinite 

filters for water purification 

This chapter aimed to obtain ceramic filter pellets with 

alumina and kaolinite, by freeze-casting method, for water 

filtration applications. The powders were characterized by 

analyses of average particle size, zeta potential, TG, DSC, 

XRD, XRF, density by picnometry, and specific surface area 

(BJH). The mechanical strength was measured under 

compression, and permeability evaluation was based on 

Forchheimer’s equation; final pellets were analyzed by SEM, 

and their filtration efficiency was assessed using Colilert and 

Quanti-Tray/2000.  

? Freeze-cast porous ceramic filters impregnated with 

silver nanoparticles 

In this chapter pellets of porous ceramic filters of 

alumina and kaolinite were impregnated with silver 

nanoparticles to test the bactericidal efficiency. Silver 

nanoparticles were characterized by average particle size, zeta 

potential, SEM/EDS and TEM. The AgNPs were impregnated 

by dipping (method developed in the first part of this work). 

After impregnation, leached water was analyzed by graphite 

furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) to measure 

efficiency in silver impregnation.

5 Bentonites functionalized by impregnation with 
TiO2, Ag, Pd and Au nanoparticles1 

5.1 Introduction 

 

Bentonite is a clay composed by montmorillonite 

and/or other terms of the smectite group, and minor non-clay 

minerals. Montmorillonites are swellable dioctahedral 2:1 

layersilicates, which consist of stacks of several so-called 2:1 

layers. This clay mineral has a permanent negative charge that 

arises from isomorphous substitution of Al3+ for Si4+ at the 

tetrahedral sheet and Mg2+ for Al3+ at the octahedral sheet. 

This negative charge is naturally compensated by 

exchangeable cations (i.e. Na+, Ca2+) located in the interlayer 

space (Bergaya et al., 2006). Montmorillonite has a high 

cation exchange capacity (CEC), marked swelling and high 

specific surface area leading to a strong adsorption/desorption 

capacity of ionic or polar compounds (Ikhtiyarova et al., 2012; 

Parolo et al., 2014). 

When individual lamellae of montmorillonite are 

exposed to water, the water molecules are adsorbed on silica 

sheets, which are then separated from each other. This 

interlayer swelling is controlled by the cation associated with 

the clay structure. The thickness of the water interlayer varies 

with the nature of the cation adsorbed and the amount of water 

available (Brindley, 1955; Bergaya et al., 2006).   

Sodic bentonites expand many times their volumes 

when in contact with water. If the cation is Na+, the swelling 

may progress from 12.5 Å, when the clay is exposed to air, to 

a maximum of 40.0 Å, when the clay is fully dispersed in a 

liquid medium (Lummus and Azar, 1986). The sodic natural

bentonites, such as those found in Argentina, can withstand 

temperatures up to 620 °C. The activated bentonites withstand 

about 450 °C. 

The features of a bentonite directly depend on its 

composition, impurities and origin (Paiva et al., 2008; Holtzer 

et al., 2011). The bentonites that do not have the desired 

properties for an application can be modified in some ways to 

reach the requirements and market demands, for example, by 

impregnation of nanoparticles. According to current 

definitions, nanomaterials are considered natural, fabricated or 

incidentally formed materials having 50% or more particles 

with one or more external dimensions in the range of 1-100 

nm (European Commission, 2011). Their outstanding 

properties have been described in many books, comprehensive 

reviews and research papers (e.g., Rao et al., 2007). 

Clay minerals may be regarded as natural 

nanostructured materials, since their crystallites are usually 

characterized by one dimension in the nanorange. Clay 

minerals present external surfaces including edges and 

internal surfaces of interlayer spaces. A clay particle is an 

assembly of layered crystallites and a clay aggregate is an 

assembly of clay particles. Therefore, we may distinguish 

between interlayer, interparticle, and interaggregate pores of 

different sizes and shapes (Bergaya et al., 2006; Praus et al., 

2013; Abreu et al., 2015). 

Bentonites with more than 70% montmorillonite have 

attracted considerable interest because they are easily 

available in bulk quantities, economically attractive and 

environmentally friendly. They have excellent swelling and 

adsorption properties, being used as a support to disperse and 

stabilize nanoparticles in various applications (Ayari et al., 

2005; Hashemian, 2010; Zamparas et al., 2012; Motshekga et 

al., 2015). 

Nanoparticles of metals and metal oxides, such as Ag, 

Au, Pd and TiO2 have physical and chemical properties that 



 

71 

 

depend on their size and shape. The size reduction to 

nanometric dimensions causes the material to acquire a 

behavior between “bulk” and molecular. One of the features 

related to the decrease in particle size is the increasing of 

surface area, which greatly enhances their applications that 

depends on surface sites.  

The objective of this part of the work is to develop a 

novel route, which may be transferred to the industry, aiming 

the functionalization of bentonites through the impregnation 

of nanoparticles. This implies a dual target: primarily, to 

enable bentonites to acquire properties that are not preexistent 

(improving their performance in current uses and disclosing 

new applications) and, additionally, to exploit the use of 

bentonite as encapsulating matrices for the handling and 

transportation of nanoparticles. In the latter case, new  

promising prospective uses are open for the development of 

cost-effective, molecular designed solutions that decrease the 

potential risk associated to NP exposure (Ortelli and Costa, 

2016; Costa et al., 2016) thanks to the encapsulating effects of 

environmental friendly bentonite. In line with the performance 

requirements of a sustainable and safer design approach, the 

mesoporosity of bentonite hosting structure should also 

guarantee the preservation of NP reactivity. 

5.2 Materials and methods 

5.2.1 Raw materials and synthesis methods 

Bentonites from Brazil (QB; T-Cota), Argentina (BL; 

T-Cota), Italy (P1 and P4; Laviosa) and United States (WY; 

Laviosa) were characterized by surface area (BET, 

Quantachrome, NOVA 2200e, USA) swelling (Foster 

method), chemical composition (XRF, Epsilon 3, 

PANalytical), particle size distribution by sedimentation 

(SediGraph 5100, Micromeritics), CEC (cation exchange 

capacity) by the methylene blue method. Thermal analyses 

(TG and DSC) were performed simultaneously (Netzsch, 



 

72 

 

STA449 Jupiter, Germany) within the 25-1000 °C range under 

air atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 °C min?1. 

TiO2 nanosols (nanoparticle dispersions) were 

commercially available (Cericol, Colorobbia), with a solid 

loading of 1 wt%); Ag, Au and Pd nanoparticles were 

synthesized in the laboratory. The following analytic grade 

reagents (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were used: AgNO3, HAuCl4, 

NaOH, and PdCl2, as well as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw 

29000, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and D(+) glucose (Merck, 

Germany). Metallic nanoparticles were prepared by using a 

microwave assisted eco-friendly method (Blosi et al., 2014). 

Ag colloids were obtained through the reduction of AgNO3 in 

the presence of PVP. First, 3.13 g of PVP were dissolved in 90 

ml of distilled water, then 0.28 g of NaOH and 0.90 g of D(+) 

glucose were added to the solution. When all the reagents 

were dissolved, the solution was heated at 70 ºC, 10 ml of an 

aqueous AgNO3 solution (0.5 M) was injected, and the 

reaction was allowed to proceed for 3 min. By adding AgNO3, 

the solution immediately turned brown with intense yellow 

shades. Highly stable suspensions with a solid loading of 0.5 

wt% were initially achieved and, by using optimized 

conditions, the solid loading was further increased to 4 wt% 

(Blosi et al., 2010; Blosi et al., 2014). 

Au nanoparticles were synthesized by mixing PVP 

(0.35 g) and glucose (from 0.20 to 0.40 g) in a round bottom 

flask containing water (80 ml). The solution was microwave-

heated at ambient pressure to a temperature ranging from 70 

to 90 °C (heating rate of 30 °C/min). At this temperature, 

aqueous NaOH (0.88 M) and HAuCl4 (10 ml, 0.11 M) 

solutions were added to the flask and stirred for 2.5 min. After 

the reaction, a red, stable suspension of gold nanoparticles 

with a solid loading of 0.2 wt% was obtained (Blosi et al., 

2010; Blosi et al., 2014). 

Pd nanoparticles were synthesized through reduction 

of PdCl2. The experiments were performed following the same 



 

73 

 

procedure used for gold colloids. In the Pd case, only the 

NaOH/metal molar ratio was adjusted during the synthesis 

optimization procedure (Blosi et al., 2010; Blosi et al., 2014). 

5.2.2 Processing and characterization 

The nanoparticles used in this study (Ag, TiO2, Au 

and Pd) were characterized by XRD (Bruker, D8 Advance 

with LynxEye detector, Germany) with a 2? range from 0 to 

80°, 0.02 step size, 16 s (equivalent) time-per-step, and DLS 

(Malvern, MPT-2, UK), working at a fixed angle of 173°. 

XRD was performed on the nanoparticles in an aqueous 

suspension to overcome problems due to the high 

hygroscopicity of the dried particles. Some drops of the 

suspension were deposited on a borosilicate sample holder and 

submitted to XRD analysis. Although this procedure is not 

conventional, it has been mentioned in the literature (Cruciani 

et al., 2011; Taglieri et al., 2013).  

QB and BL bentonites were impregnated with Ag, 

TiO2, Au and Pd nanosols. In the direct method or imbibition, 

the nanoparticles suspensions were dropped on a certain 

amount of powder. The imbibition was performed with spatula 

and mortar until the initial coloration of bentonite was not 

more observed. The procedure was repeated varying the 

nanoparticle percentage in relation to the bentonite mass: 1 

and 2 wt% Ag, 1 to 3 wt% TiO2 and 0.1 wt% Au and Pd. 

The impregnation efficiency was characterized in 

samples of bentonites impregnated with nanoparticles (2 wt% 

Ag, 3 wt% TiO2 and 0.1 wt% Au and Pd), after washing with 

water. The clay was dispersed in distilled water (10 wt% 

clay/water), the slurry underwent a magnetic stirring and was 

then centrifuged with 5000 rpm during 10 min. The 

supernatant (15 mL) was transferred to a plastic test tube 

coupled to a filter of 10 kDa to detect remaining 

nanoparticles. This tube was centrifuged again in the same 

conditions described before. The resulting solution above the 

filter possibly containing the nanoparticles was then collected 



 

74 

 

and analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical 

Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES, Varian, Liberty 200, 

Australia) and by X-ray Powder  Diffraction (XRD, Bruker, 

D8 Advance, Germany). 

Another impregnation method used was dipping. 

Aqueous slurries of 10 wt% Ag, TiO2, Pd or Au nanoparticles 

were prepared. Samples of bentonites BL and QB were chosen 

to continue the tests. The samples were stored in a grid/filter 

with holes of 149 µm, and dipped into the respective slurries. 

Then, the bags were removed from the slurries and samples 

were taken for drying in oven at 100 °C during 1 h.  

A heat treatment was performed for the bentonites QB 

and BL to identify the influence of temperature on the 

nanoparticles impregnation process. The bentonites were 

treated at temperatures from 100 to 700 °C. Table 1 shows the 

bentonites QB and BL and their method of impregnation with 

their Ag NP solution used and their treatments in their 

respective order of process.  

SEM-FEG was employed to characterize Ag 

nanoparticles distribution within the bentonite BL matrix. In 

this case, samples were prepared according to either one of the 

following sequences: 

? imbibition, thermal treatment at 100 °C – BL 1 

? imbibition, thermal treatment at 700 °C – BL 3 

? thermal treatment at 700 °C, imbibition – BL 7 

? thermal treatment at 700 °C, dipping – BL 8

5.3 Results and discussion 

 

Table 2 shows characteristic physical properties and 

chemical composition of the bentonites employed in this 

work: QB, BL, P1, P4 and WY. 

The bentonite WY remained dispersed without 

settling down, even after 4 days of rest. Only for bentonite 



 

76 

 

QB, it was possible to measure the particle size by 

sedimentation. The other bentonites showed the formation of a 

dense and viscous layer, both in water and in alcohol, 

corresponding to flocculation and phase separation. 

Comparing the chemical composition of bentonites to 

the cation exchange capacity (CEC) and swelling, it can be 

seen that the sodic bentonites are those which have the highest 

CEC and swelling values. Therefore, they attract the greatest 

attention from the industry.

The thermogravimetric behavior of bentonites is 

similar in all samples (Figure 1A). There is a significant initial 

loss of mass, around 100 °C, related to water adsorbed on the 



 

77 

 

external surface of the material and located in the interlayers 

of the crystalline structure. The mass lost between 500 and 

650 °C corresponds to dehydroxylation. From 700 °C on, the 

curves present practically no longer any significant loss of 

mass. WY and P1 bentonites had the lowest and the highest 

mass losses, respectively. These transformations are shown in 

DSC curves (Figure 1B). In addition, it is possible to observe 

a significant exothermic peak between 800 and 900 °C, 

characteristic of crystallization of a new phase. At 910 °C, an 

event represents the decomposition of dolomite impurity. 

Above 900 °C major structural changes resulting in the 

development of cristobalite and mullite in montmorillonite 

can occur (Galindo et al., 2013; Caglar et al., 2009; Bergaya et 

al., 2006; Occelli and Tindwa, 1983; Neaman et al., 2003).

Figure 2 shows the particle size distribution measured 

by DLS of TiO2, Au, Pd and Ag nanoparticles. Nano-TiO2 

(Figure 2A) presents a bimodal distribution possibly due to 

agglomeration, with peaks respectively at ~6 and ~70 nm. For 

3 different measurements, the distribution is constant. Figure 

2B shows minor peaks in the micrometric range (5 ?m) that 

occur due to agglomeration of nano-Au. The highest peak 

occurs between 100 and 200 nm, with primary nanoparticles 

in the range of 20 to 30 nm. Figure 2C shows that Pd 

nanoparticles have a variation of peaks for each analysis, 

which demonstrates a possible instability of the suspension. 

The occurrence of several peaks may occur due to an 

agglomeration of nano-Pd. A major peak is located at about 

200 nm, with the smallest fraction at 10 to 30 nm. Figure 2D 

shows the distribution of Ag nanoparticles with constant, well-

defined peaks. In this case, no detectable agglomeration 

occurred. A single peak can be observed at approximately 90 

nm.

of nanoparticles: (a) TiO2, (b) Au, (c) Pd and (d) Ag.

The nanoparticles were characterized by XRD directly 

in their aqueous suspension (Figure 3). The broad band at 

~28° in Figures 3A, 3B and 3C, typical of borosilicate glass, 

can be observed because of the low concentration of 

nanoparticles and to the glassy nature of the sample holder. In 

Figure 3D, the hump at 28° is hardly visible due to the much 

higher concentration of TiO2 (15.5 wt%), which presents a 

higher degree of crystallinity as well. Figure 3A shows the 

diffractogram of nano-Ag (1 wt% in water) with indication of 

the peaks of silver. A similar feature occurs for nano-Au 

(Figure 3B) even if its concentration in the aqueous 

suspension is as low as 0.011 wt%. Figure 3C shows the 

diffractogram of nano-Pd, which does not present well-

defined peaks. This can be attributed to the low concentration 

(0.011 wt% in water) and small size (under 20 nm) of primary 

Pd nanoparticles in the suspension. Figure 3D shows the 

diffractogram of nano-TiO2 (15.5 wt% in water). Two 

crystalline phases were detected, being anatase predominant 

over brookite.

A leached solution resulting from washing the 

impregnated bentonite samples QB (QB 7 and QB 8) and BL 

(BL 7 and BL 8) with water was analyzed by ICP-OES (Table 

3). Both imbibition and dipping processes showed satisfactory 

results for the impregnation efficiency. All values of residual 

nanoparticles in the bentonites are above 90%. In the case of 

Ag, above 99% of nanoparticles were retained by the 

bentonite after washing with water. TiO2 could not be 

measured by ICP-OES due to low accuracy of the detection 

method for this sample. According to Motshekga et al. (2015), 

the nanoparticles in the bentonites were proven to be stable, 

with leaching values under the accepted WHO standards (0.1 

mg/l) (WHO, 2011).

Based on these results, bentonite BL and Ag

correspond to the bentonites impregnated with nanoparticles 

by either imbibition or dipping, and submitted to a heat 

treatment at either 100 or 700°C. The lighter spots in the 

micrographs indicate that the Ag nanoparticles are not 

agglomerated and are homogenously distributed in the clay 

matrix.

5.4 Conclusions 

 

Bentonite-nanoparticles composites have been 

successfully obtained by simple impregnation procedures, 

easily transferable to industry, which can be performed either 

by imbibition or by dipping.  

Best results were achieved submitting bentonites to a 

preliminary heat treatment at 700 °C. The impregnation 

efficiency after washing with water is over 99% in the case of 

nano-Ag, and over 90% for Au, Pd and TiO2 nanoparticles. 

Such a different behavior could be related to the colloidal 

stability of nanosuspensions used during impregnation. 

Nano-Ag was characterized by a higher stability and 

particle dispersion in suspension, while Au, Pd and TiO2 

nanoparticles suffered from some agglomeration and their 

suspensions exhibited an unstable behavior.

6 Fabrication of pressed porous ceramic filters for 
water purification with kaolinite and/or alumina2 

 

6.1 Introduction 

 

 The access to clean and safe water is of paramount 

importance for human health. It is estimated that in the 21st 

century more than one billion people do not have access to 

safe drinking water. Much of this population is concentrated 

in underdeveloped countries, especially in rural areas. Small 

communities have the most difficulty in receiving water in 

sufficient quantity and quality, population is exposed to 

diseases transmitted through the water (Mwabi et al., 2011). 

 Porous ceramic filters are among the most effective 

treatments for water purification. Ceramic filters have been 

widely used for microbiological treatment of water due to its 

low cost. Porous ceramics may be manufactured from oxides 

such as alumina, titania, or zirconia. The advantages of porous 

ceramics over other filtration techniques and materials are 

their chemical, thermal and pH stability. Allied to the previous 

features, there is also the longevity and strength to pressure, 

temperature and corrosion, bringing an excellent cost/benefit 

relationship (Lv et al, 2009; Bielefeldt et al, 2009; Simonis 

and Basson, 2011). 

Several processing routes such as replica, sacrificial 

template, or direct foaming methods are available for the 

production of macroporous ceramics. The techniques differ 

greatly in terms of processing features and final 

microstructures/properties achieved (Studart et al., 2006).  

The sacrificial template technique usually consists of 

the preparation of a biphasic composite comprising a 

continuous matrix of ceramic particles or ceramic precursors

and a dispersed sacrificial phase that is homogeneously 

distributed throughout the matrix and ultimately extracted to 

generate pores within the microstructure. This method leads to 

porous materials displaying a negative replica of the original 

sacrificial template, as opposed to the positive morphology 

obtained from the replica technique (Studart et al., 2006). 

The extraction of the sacrificial material from the 

consolidated composite depends primarily on the type of pore 

former employed. Predominantly open pores of various 

different morphologies can be produced with this method. The 

mechanical strength of cellular structures produced is often 

substantially higher than that achieved with the positive 

replica techniques (Aranberri et al., 2009; Studart et al., 2006). 

Rice husk is an abundantly available waste material 

in all rice producing countries. It consists of organic 

materials (e.g. cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) 

(~75 wt%), amorphous silica (~15 wt%) and water 

(~10 wt%). In certain regions, rice husk is sometimes used as 

a fuel for parboiling paddy in the rice mills. The partially 

burnt rice husk in turn contributes to more environmental 

pollution. There have been efforts not only to overcome this 

but also to find value addition to these wastes using them as 

secondary source of materials. In respect of environmental 

friendly and cost-effectiveness, the rice husk powders have 

been used as an additive to produce porous structure 

(Chandrasekhar et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2009). 

In this work, water filters were obtained by a simple 

uniaxial pressing from alumina and/or kaolinite powders with 

and without rice husks, as pore forming agents. 

6.2 Materials and methods 

6.2.1 Raw materials and processing 

 



 

85 

 

The powders used as raw materials for the porous 

filters were kaolinite, (Colorminas) and alumina (CT 3000, 

Almatis). Rice husk was provided by Arroz Fumacense 

(Morro da Fumaça, SC, Brazil) was used as a porogenic agent 

and characterized by moisture content, TG/DSC (STA 449 F3, 

Jupiter) and SEM (TM3030, Hitachi). 

For the moisture tests, the samples were prepared 

according to NBR 6923 (1981), and set in a furnace at 105 °C 

during 6 h, with measures after 3, 4, 5 and 6 h. Moreover, 

NBR 8112 (1986) and ASTM E871 (2014) were applied 

(ABNT 1981; ABNT 1986; ASTM, 2014). 

Rice husks were milled in a jar mill (CB2-T, BP), 

during 20 min. Fractions of rice husks of different sizes were 

taken. After every milling around 15 g powder (&lt;70 mesh, 

210 µm), 12 g (between 35 and 70 mesh), and 11 g (&gt;35 

mesh, 420 µm) was obtained. 

The samples were pressed at 10, 20, 30, or 50 MPa, 

during 1 to 5 min to produce pellets with 20.0 ± 0.5 mm 

diameter and 6.5 ± 1 mm length. A heat treatment was done to 

remove the porogenic agent (rice husks) and the organic 

dispersant (Darvan CN, Vanderbilt), at 1 ºC/min up to 500 ºC 

with a soaking time of 1 h at 500 ºC, in a resistive furnace (J-

200, Jung). Then, samples with only kaolinite were sintered at 

900, 1000 and 1100 ºC, and samples of alumina, with or 

without kaolinite, were sintered at 1500, 1550 and 1600 ºC, 

with a heating rate of 5 °C/min, and dwell time of 1 and 2 h, 

respectively, for kaolinite and alumina, at the maximum 

temperature, in another resistive furnace (EDG-1600). 

6.2.2 Formulation and characterization  

Different compositions were tested, as shown in Table

The samples with compositions of Table 1 were 

pressed at 10, 20, 30, or 50 MPa, during 1 to 5 min. For the 

porosity desired, a pressure as low as possible is better, but the 

samples needed a minimal mechanical strength to keep the 

shape. Considering it, the best results were obtained applying 

10 MPa, during 3 min. 

Samples of alumina with or without kaolinite, were 

moved to another furnace and sintered at 1550 ºC (minimum 

temperature with complete sintering of alumina), with a 

heating rate of 5 °C/min, and dwell time of 2 h at the 

maximum temperature. 

For the determination of apparent density, water 

absorption) and apparent porosity of the final filter, ASTM 

C20-00 (2015) was applied. The compression strength was 

measured by a universal mechanical testing machine (DL 

20000, Emic), with a load cell of 20 N and a loading velocity 

of 0.5 mm/min, according to ASTM C133 (1997). Pre-tests of 

permeability of the final pellets were carried in a lab build 

apparatus, using a glass funnel on the top of a graded burette. 

Each pellet was placed in the glass funnel and sealed with 

silicone to prevent the water leaking. The flow rate was 

measured by the amount of water passing through the filter in 

ml/h. 

6.3 Results and discussion 

The moisture of rice husk samples was determined 

after 3, 4, 5 and 6 h at 105ºC (Figure 1A). The main loss of 

water occurred in the first 3 h, around 10 wt%. From 3 to 6 h, 

there was no significant weight loss. Figure 1B shows the 

corresponding total solids loss.

Figure 6. 1. Drying of rice husk: (a) residual moisture, (b) 

total solids loss.  

Figure 2 shows the results of thermogravimetric 

analysis confirming an initial mass loss of 10% around 100 

ºC, corresponding to the sample moisture, and a sharp loss of 

mass between 250 and 400 ºC, where rice husk decomposition 

occurs. 

 

Figure 6. 2. Thermogravimetric analysis of rice husk: (a) 

TGA, (b) DTG. 

Figure 2B shows the derivative of the mass loss 

curve, where a small peak of the water loss of the sample is 

observed at ~100ºC and then a very sharp peak showing the 

critical temperature where the rice husk decomposition takes 

place can be seen at ~370 °C. Next to this peak, a shoulder 

starting at 300 °C may correspond to the constitutional water 

loss of the sample.  



 

89 

 

A DSC analysis of the rice husk, Figure 3, shows a 

small endothermic peak due the water loss, and a gradual 

exothermic feature due to the combustion of the rice husk.

Figures 4A and 4B show micrographs of the rice husk 

respectively before and after milling (&lt;70 mesh, 210 µm)), 

with 3 different magnifications. 

The micrographs show that the powder with less than 

210 µm has a more homogenous distribution; thus, this was 

chosen for compaction of most of pellets compositions 

thereafter.

Samples with only kaolinite have low porosity but 

their densification was incomplete, the samples did not reach 

enough mechanical strength for their handling without 

rupture. Samples with only alumina have a higher 

densification, in consequence, lower porosity; the higher 

porosities occurred in samples with lower percentage of solids 

(35 to 60 wt%). Alumina and kaolinite mixtures with total 



 

92 

 

solids of 50 and 60 wt% had similar porosity and higher 

values than samples with only alumina or kaolinite. 

The mechanical tests showed that all the samples had 

an average compression strength of 90 ± 5 MPa, 

corresponding to high densification and low permeability to 

be used as a filter. During the tests of water flow rate, with 

samples with only alumina or kaolinite, some defects could be 

observed in the pellets, as shown in Figure 5.  

 

Figure 6. 5. Different defects that appeared in the pellets 

during the tests of permeability (flow rate). A) Walls falling 

apart; B) Flow through the funnel; C) Division into layers; D) 

Center went down ; E) Cracks. 

 All samples with both kaolinite and alumina (KA1, 

KA2, KA3, KA4, KA5, KA6, KA7, KA8, KA9 and KA10) 

presented a suitable strength after contact with water. The 

pellets remained constant, but the water flow rate did not 

reach values high enough for water filtering, with less than 

0.01 l/h. According to Lantagne (2001), Bielefeldt et al. 



 

93 

 

(2009) and Salvinelli et al. (2016), a flow rate recommend to 

water filters is 1-3 l/h.  

6.4 Conclusions 

 

Filter samples made only with kaolinite presented low 

porosity and their densification was incomplete after sintering 

at 1100 ºC. They did not reached enough mechanical strength 

for their handling without degradation.  

Alumina samples were denser, i. e., less porous, 

which were not suitable for water filtration purposes. All the 

samples with kaolinite and alumina presented a good strength 

after contact with water, but the flow rate of less than 0.01 l/h 

is not indicated for water filtering. 

Thus, uniaxial pressed water filters of kaolinite and/or 

alumina with or without rice husks are not suitable for the 

intended application, at least in the conditions tested here.

7 Influence of alumina particle size on the 
performance of freeze-cast filters3 

 

7.1 Introduction 

 

Freeze casting has received broad attention as a 

simple and versatile fabrication technique of porous 

structures, which generally offers a wider range of pore 

characteristics. It involves the preparation of a ceramic slip 

that is poured into a mold, which is then frozen and subjected 

to sublimation drying of the solvent under vacuum (Sofie and 

Dogan, 2001; Deville et al., 2007; Fukushima et al., 2008; 

Yoon et al., 2008; Li and Li, 2012). 

Given the inherent strength of frozen solvents, this 

method allows the frozen solvent to temporarily act as a 

binder to hold the part together for demolding. Removal of the 

solvent by sublimation also eliminates drying stresses and 

shrinkage that may lead to cracks and warping during the 

normal drying of a solvent-saturated body (Sofie and Dogan, 

2001). 

Many factors influence the microstructure and 

properties of porous ceramics fabricated by freeze casting, 

such as composition and initial solids loading, cooling rate, 

sintering temperature, and additive content (Deville, 2008; Hu 

et al., 2010; Liu and Button, 2013). 

Nevertheless, the effect of particle size of the ceramic 

powder constituent in freeze casting has attracted little 

attention. The particle size has a major effect on the final 

mechanical properties, since it is expected that smaller 

particles improve the densification and lead to lower porosity 

(Araki and Halloran, 2005; Koh et al., 2006; Yoon et al, 2007; 

Liu and Button, 2013).

Fukasawa et al. applied freeze casting to fabricate 

porous alumina ceramics with unidirectionally aligned pore 

channels, which is a desirable feature for water filters 

(Fukasawa et al., 2001; Fukasawa et al., 2002; Deville, 2008). 

We employed two alumina with different particle 

sizes to investigate the influence of the particle size on freeze 

casting processing and products as a filters for potable water. 

7.2 Materials and methods 

7.2.1 Raw materials and characterization 

 

The powders used as raw materials for the filter were 

alumina (CT 3000, Almatis), with mean particle size of 0.5 

and 2.5 µm, named respectively as F for fine, and C for coarse 

powder. They were characterized by measuring particle size 

distribution and zeta potential (Zetasizer, Nanosizer, Malvern; 

Stabino, Nanoflex, Particle Metrix), dispersion stability 

(Lumisizer, L.U.M.); as well as by TG/DSC (STA 449 F3 

Jupiter, Netzsch); XRD (Desktop MiniFlex II, Rigaku); XRF 

(WDXRF Axios Max, Panalytical); picnometric density ( 

Ultrapicnometer 1200 P/N, Quantachrome); specific surface 

area (BJH, Nova 1200e, Quantachrome); and SEM (TM3030, 

Hitachi). 

7.2.2 Formulation, processing and characterization of 
filters 

The forming of the samples was by freeze casting, 

where the velocity and the angle that the slurry was cast was 

maintained as constant as possible. The pores were controlled 

by changing the concentration of solids in the slurry. The 

compositions of the slurries are shown in Table 1, where C 

stands for coarse alumina (2.5 µm) and F for fine alumina (0.5 

µm). All the samples have 1.5% organic dispersant (Darvan, 

C-N, Vanderbilt) and the balance is distilled water. 



 

96 

 

After freeze-casting, samples were kept in an ultra-

freezer at -70 °C, during 24 h, and then transferred to a freeze-

dryer (Liotop L102, Liobras) with pressure &amp;lt;0.39 atm (300 

µmHg) and temperature -50 °C, during 48 h. The freeze-dried 

samples were then sintered in an furnace (EDG-1600, EDG) at 

1550 °C, with a heating rate of 5 °C/min, and dwell time of 2 

h at the maximum temperature. The sintered filters were 20 ± 

0.5 mm in diameter and 12 ± 1 mm thick.

Rheology measurements were performed with a 

viscometer (ViscotesterTM 550, Haake), with SV2P geometry 

of concentric cylinders with toothed surface. Each analysis 

was performed within 3 min at a shear rate of 0 to 600 s-1, at 

room temperature. The viscosity values were adjusted 

according to the Herschel-Bulkley model (Equation 1) 

(Moreno, 2005). 

? = ?0 + ??
???    (1) 

where ? is the shear stress; ?0, the yield stress; K, the 
consistency; ?, the shear rate; and n, the flow index.  



 

97 

 

The average solidification rate of each sample could 

be obtained by measuring the height of the samples and 

controlling the time for complete solidification of the material. 

The final pellets had 20 ± 0.5 mm diameter and 12 ± 1 mm 

thickness. They were analyzed by SEM (TM3030, Hitachi). 

For the tests of apparent specific gravity (relative 

density), water absorption and apparent porosity of the final 

filter, ASTM C20-00 standard was used. The mechanical 

strength was measured through compression tests in a 

universal machine (DL 20000, Emic) with a load cell of 20 N 

and a loading velocity of 0.5 mm/min, according to ASTM 

C133-97. 

Permeability evaluation of the filters in air was based 

on Forchheimer’s model (Equation 2 and auxiliary equations), 

an empirical relationship to express the parabolic dependence 

of pressure drop (?P (Pa)) through the medium with the 

resulting face velocity (vs (m/s)):

7.3 Results and discussion 

7.3.1 Raw materials characterization 

 

Table 3 shows characteristic physical properties and 

chemical composition of alumina C and alumina F. Their 

particle size distributions, measured with Zetasizer, is shown 

in Figures 1 and 2, in which there are four measures (40, 50, 

60 and 70 wt% of alumina in the initial suspension 

(respectively A, B, C and D). In all cases, there are more than 



 

99 

 

one peak, mainly in alumina C, showing agglomeration of the 

particles in the micrometric range. 

Table 7. 3. Physical properties and chemical composition of 

alumina C and alumina F. 

 

The density values are close to those reported by the 

manufacturers and found in the literature for alumina, 

approximately 3.91 g/cm³ (Figiel et al., 2011). Specific 

surfaces areas are close to the reported in the literature, in the 

range 2 to 6 m2/g (El Hafiane et al., 2012). The chemical 

composition shows the high purity of the alumina powders.

The SEM micrographs of the alumina powders are in 

Figure 3 at different magnifications. It is possible to observe 

that the particle size of the coarse alumina C powder is ~2.5 

?m with some larger particles ~6 ?m, and the particle size of 

the fine alumina is ~0.5 ?m with some larger particles ~4 ?m. 

Those values are in good agreement with the analysis of 

particle size distribution by DLS. In Figures 3C and 3D, a 

larger agglomeration of the powder is observed due to its 

higher reactivity corresponding to smaller particle size and 

consequently larger surface area.

7.3.2 Rheological behavior of alumina suspensions 

Figures 4 shows the curve of zeta potential versus pH 

of alumina C (4A) and alumina F (4B) suspensions. In case of 

alumina C, the zeta potential is around -77 mV (in acid pH) 

and -68 mV (in basic pH). The isoelectric point of the 



 

102 

 

suspensions can be observed in pH around 2.5, so that it is 

better to work with pH range 6-10, as far from pH 2.5 as 

possible, because the suspensions are more stable in these 

ranges. In alumina F, the zeta potential is around -38 mV (in 

acid pH) and -45 mV (in basic pH). The isoelectric point of 

the suspensions can be observed in pH around 3.5, it means 

that it is better to work with the same pH range that alumina C 

suspension. The initial suspensions were very stable, with pH 

8.5 approximately.

In the rheological analysis, the flow data of the 

suspensions was fitted according to the Herschel-Bulkley 

(HB) model. The HB parameters, volumetric fraction of 

alumina, correlation coefficient (r) and viscosity at 300 s-1 

(?300) of samples with 40, 50, 60 and 70 wt% alumina C and 

F are shown in Table 4.

The yield stress is around zero for lower solid loads, 

and the n index is less than the unit, indicating a pseudoplastic 

behavior as usually found for alumina suspensions in water, 

although the correlation coefficient r is not that high. For both 

coarse and fine alumina suspensions, the viscosity is higher 

when the amount of solids is increasing, as expected. Slurries 

with 50 wt% solids, the percentage chosen for the next steps, 

considering average deviation, have about the same viscosity 

for both alumina C and F suspensions. 

The rheograms of alumina C (Figure 5) and F (Figure 

6), showing viscosity (Pa?s) versus shear rate (s-1) and shear 

stress (Pa) versus shear rate (s-1) for 40, 50, 60 and 70 wt% 

attest that the behavior is similar in all the compositions, and 

the values are almost the same, with exception of samples 

with 70 wt% solids.

7.3.3 Porosity and permeability of filters 

The solidification rate is one of the parameters that 

most interferes in the pore size, Figure 7 shows the average 

solidification rate found, during the freeze casting process, for 

alumina samples containing 50 wt% and 50 wt% coarse and 

fine powder, respectively. The variation in sample height is 

due to the difficulty of accurately controlling the volume of 

suspension cast into the mold. 

 

Figure 7. 7. Average solidification rate found for alumina 

samples containing 50 wt% coarse (C) and fine (F) fine 

powder, respectively. 

 The difference in the solidification rate is due to the 

difference in particle size between alumina C (2.5 ?m) and F 

(0.5 ?m). As the particle size decreases, the solidification rate 

also decreases. At a high freezing rate, ice nucleation is 

kinetically more favorable than crystal growth, small pore 

formation is more likely. Moreover, the dispersing state of the 

suspension is more likely to be maintained at a high freezing 

rate since there is less time for particles to rearrange. Lower 

freezing rate offers more densely packed particles and lower 

porosity (Li et al., 2012).Since alumina C has a higher 

solidification rate, the stability of their slurries is higher.

samples.

 Figure 9 shows the SEM micrographs in samples 

with 50 wt% solids, of the external surface of alumina C50 

(Figure 9A) and alumina F50 (Figure 9B), and of the fractured 

inner surface C50 (Figure 9C) and F50 (Figure 9D).

Figure 7. 9. SEM micrographs of the external surface of 

sintered alumina samples A) C50 and B) F50, and of the 

fractured inner surface of samples C) C50 and D) F50. 

A difference in the distribution and shape of the pores 

and their connectivity can be observed. The pore size in the 

sintered samples, both at the external surface and the fractured 

inner surface, varies remarkably. Roughly, pores are ~3 ?m 

for sample C50 and ~7 ?m for sample F50. For the intended 

application, it is desirable to have pores with 3 ?m or less. 

Through the fractured inner surface micrograph, it is possible 

to observe the high alignment of pores due to the freeze 

casting. In the sample C50, a more homogeneous structure 

with better densification is observed, while in the sample F50, 

a less homogeneous structure with the formation of layers can 

be seen.

Table 5 and Figure 10 show the apparent porosity 

versus total solids (wt%) of alumina C and F samples. 

Alumina F shows a decreasing curve behavior: the higher the 

amount of solids, the lower the porosity; while alumina C 

does not show any decreasing trend. At around 50 wt%, which 

is approximately the percentage chosen for the pellets of this 

work based on experimental results, the porosity of alumina C 

is slightly higher than that of alumina F, around 73 and 68%, 

respectively.

corresponding to a very low porosity (in samples with higher 

solids percentages); alumina C maintained a lower range of 

compressive strength, and porosity remained higher in all 

solids percentages. For the filters, a balance of good 

mechanical strength and high porosity must be found.

The Darcyan and non-Darcyan permeability 

parameters do not show a direct relationship with the apparent 

porosity in samples with coarse or fine alumina; the second 

ones present an increasing linear behavior in samples with 

apparent porosity between around 35 and 70%, though. The 

data obtained in this work were inserted in a data map with 

data available in the literature (Figure 13) (Vakifahmetoglu et 

al., 2017). 

 

Figure 7. 13. Location of permeability data of obtained in this 

work in a comprehensive data map available in the literature 

(Vakifahmetoglu et al., 2017). 

The values of k1 and k2, obtained in this work were in 

the range of granular filters (ceramic filters able to water 

purification) and fibrous aerosol filters (ceramic filters useful 

to allow savings in thermal energy with simultaneous removal 

of particulate material and chemical contaminants from flue 

gases) (Innocentini et al., 2009). In this way, desired 

permeability values were obtained here for the application as 

drinking water filters. 

7.4 Conclusions 

 

As the particle size decreases, the solidification rate 

also decreases, so the solidification rate is lower for fine 

alumina, and lower freezing rate offers more densely packed 



 

112 

 

particles and lower porosity. Since alumina C has a higher 

solidification rate, the stability of their slurries is higher, since 

there is less time for particles to rearrange.  

The average pore size is ~3 ?m for sample C50 (more 

suitable for the intended application) and up to 7 ?m for 

sample F50. In the sample C50, a more homogeneous 

structure with better densification is observed, at around 50 

wt% solids. The porosity of coarse alumina is slightly higher 

than that of fine alumina, between 73 and 68% respectively. 

The compressive strength of fine alumina reached 

higher values, but with a very low porosity (particularly in 

samples with higher solids loading). Coarse alumina presented 

a lower mechanical strength, and the porosity remained higher 

in all solids concentrations. 

Considering permeability parameters k1 and k2 

obtained in this work, the ceramic filters achieved the desired 

permeability values for the application of filters for drinking 

water, regardless of the alumina particle size. 

According to the experimental data, coarse alumina is 

more suitable for this application, so it was chosen to be used 

in the next steps of this work.

8 Fabrication of freeze-cast porous 
alumina/kaolinite filters for water purification4 

8.1 Introduction 

Porous ceramics is a field of intense research for their 

wide applications as catalyst carriers, ceramic filters, sensors, 

porous electrodes, biomaterials, and thermal barriers. Various 

fabrication methods of porous ceramics have been employed, 

including different pore-foaming techniques, infiltration of 

ceramic sol into template structures, gel-casting, slip-casting, 

starch consolidation, microwave processing, electrophoretic 

deposition, and freeze casting (Deville, 2008; Hu et al., 2010). 

A comparative study of thirty-seven different water 

treatments indicate that porous ceramic water filters are 

among the five most effective treatments for turbidity 

reduction and a 99% reduction of bacteria (Lantagne, 2001; 

Clasen and Boisson, 2006; Simonis and Basson, 2011). 

Among many emerging techniques, freeze casting is 

an attractive shaping method for the fabrication of highly 

porous and hierarchically organized ceramic structures. 

(Zhang et al., 2015; Gaudillere and Serra, 2016). 

Freeze casting has received broad attention as a 

simple and versatile fabrication technique of porous 

structures, which generally offers a wider range of pore 

characteristics compared to other conventional fabrication 

methods such as foam or wood replication, direct foaming, gel 

casting and others. Water and camphene are common solvents 

in freeze-casting process (Deville et al., 2007; Fukushima et 

al., 2008; Yoon et al., 2008; Li and Li, 2012). 

The technique consists of freezing a ceramic slurry, 

followed by sublimation of the solvent by freeze drying at 

both low pressure and temperature, and subsequent sintering,

leading to a porous structure with unidirectional channels, 

where pores are a replica of the solvent crystals (Deville, 

2008; Gaudillere and Serra, 2016). 

The control of pore structure is very important 

because of its relation to properties. Many factors, including 

the composition and solid loading of slurry as well as sintering 

conditions, influence the microstructure and properties of 

porous ceramics fabricated by the freeze casting (Hu et al., 

2010). 

In this work, filters composed of alumina and 

kaolinite were obtained by freeze casting for water filtration. 

8.2 Materials and methods 

8.2.1 Raw materials and characterization 

 

The powders used as raw material for the porous 

filters were kaolinite (Colorminas) and alumina (UC, CT 

3000, Almatis). They were characterized by measuring 

particle size distribution (Nanosizer, Malvern; Lumisizer, 

LUM); zeta potential (Stabino, Particle Metrix); TG/DSC 

(STA 449 F3 Jupiter, Netzsch); XRD (MiniFlex II, Rigaku); 

XRF (WDXRF Axios Max, Panalytical); picnometric density 

(Ultrapicnometer 1200 P/N, Quantachrome); and specific 

surface area (BJH, Nova 1200e, Quantachrome). 

8.2.2 Formulation, shaping and sintering 

The compositions of the slurries are shown in Table 1. 

To all the samples 1.5 wt% organic dispersant (Darvan, C-N, 

Vanderbilt) was added, and the balance is distilled water.  

 

 

 

 



 

115 

 

Table 8. 1. Compositions of the alumina/kaolinite slurries. 

 

The shaping of filters was performed by freeze 

casting, and the porosity was adjusted by changing the 

concentration of solids in the slurry. Before freeze casting, the 

slurries were mixed in a ball mill during 12 h. Filter samples 

of 20 ± 1 mm diameter, 12 ± 2 mm thickness were produced. 

Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of the so-called 

“cold finger” equipment used in the freeze-casting technique.

Figure 8. 1. A schematic of the freeze-casting apparatus used 

in this work. 

The velocity and the angle that the slurry was cast was 

maintained as constant as possible. After freeze-casting, 

samples were kept in an ultra-freezer at -70 °C, during 24 h, 

and then transferred to a freeze-dryer (Liotop L102, Liobras) 

with pressure &amp;lt;0.39 atm (300 µmHg) and temperature -50 °C, 

during 48 h.  

The freeze-dried samples were then sintered in an 

furnace (EDG-1600, EDG) at 1550 °C, with a heating rate of 

5 °C/min, and dwell time of 2 h at the maximum temperature. 

The sintered filters were 20 ± 0.5 mm in diameter and 12 ± 1 

mm thick. 

8.2.3 Characterization of sintered filters 

For the tests of water absorption, apparent specific 

gravity (relative density) and apparent porosity of the final 

filter, ASTM C20-00 standard was used. The mechanical 

strength was measured through compression strength, in the 

instrument DL 20000, Emic, with a load cell of 20 N and a 

loading velocity of 0.5 mm/min. ASTM C133-97 standard 

was used. The sintered samples were analyzed by SEM 

(TM3030, Hitachi). 



 

117 

 

Permeability evaluation was based on Forchheimer’s 

equation, an empirical relationship well accepted in the 

literature to express the parabolic dependence of pressure drop 

through the medium with the resulting superficial or face 

velocity. The Darcyan and non-Darcyan permeability 

parameters (Innocentini et al., 1999; Moreira et al., 2004; 

Innocentini et al., 2010; Vakifahmetoglu et al., 2017) were 

estimated. 

Filter efficiency was analysed as well (Colilert and 

Quanti-Tray/2000, Idexx). To conduct filter efficiency and 

turbidity tests, some very dirty and contaminated water 

samples were collected in bottles decontaminated by an 

autoclave (Vertical, Phoenix). This water samples was 

analyzed before and after passing through the filter.  

Colilert tests simultaneously detect total coliforms and 

E. coli in water, based on Idexx’s patented Defined Substrate 

Technology (DST). When total coliforms metabolize 

Colilert’s nutrient-indicator, ONPG, the sample turns yellow. 

When E. coli metabolize Colilert’s nutrient-indicator, MUG, 

the sample also fluoresces. 

Firstly, the content of one pack of Colilert was added 

to a 100 mL water sample in a sterile bottle and shaken until 

being dissolved. Then, the sample/reagent mixture was set 

into a tray, sealed in an sealer (Quanti-Tray Sealer, 2X, 

Idexx), and placed in 35°C ± 0.5°C incubator for 24 h. 

After that, results have been read counting the number 

of positive wells (yellow wells = total coliforms, 

yellow/fluorescent wells = E. coli) and refer to the MPN table 

provided with the trays to obtain a most probable number. The 

fluorescence was read with a 6-watt, 365-nm UV light within 

~13 cm of the sample in a dark environment.  

If the appearance result less yellow than the reference, 

it is negative for total coliforms and E. coli; when it is yellow 

comparably to or more intense than the reference, it is positive

for total coliforms; and when it is yellow and fluorescence just 

like or more than the reference, it is positive for E. coli. Figure 

2 shows as an example one tray negative for total coliforms 

and E. coli, and other positive for total coliforms, respectively.

coliforms and E. coli, and (b) tray positive for total coliforms. 

Turbidity is the cloudiness in water caused by 

particles in suspension, which makes chemical disinfection of 

the water less effective. It is commonly measured in 

nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) (WHO, 2008; WHO, 

2017b). The turbidity of the dirty (contaminated) and clean 

(after filter) water were measured (Turbidimeter, 2100N, 

Hach) with distilled and tap water to compare the results. 

8.3 Results and discussion 

8.3.1 Characterization of powders and suspensions 

 

Table 2 and Figure 3 show characteristic physical 

properties and chemical composition of the kaolinite and 

alumina. Some agglomeration of the particles in the 

micrometric range can be seen, mainly with alumina that 

presents more than one peak.

The density values are close to those reported by the 

manufacturers, which are respectively 3.91 g/cm³ for alumina 

and 2.65 g/cm³ for kaolinite (Figiel et al., 2011; Horpibulsuk 

et al., 2011). 

The chemical composition shows the high purity of 

the alumina powder and kaolinite powders, which presented 

very close weight percent values when compared to the 

theoretical ones: 46.55% SiO2; 39.50% Al2O3 and 13.96% 

H2O (Moreira et al., 2004; Barg et al., 2011).

Figure 8. 3. Particle size distribution of powders: (a) alumina

Figures 4 shows the curve of zeta potential versus pH 

of kaolinite and alumina suspensions. In case of kaolinite, the 

zeta potential is around -72 mV (in acid pH) and -53 mV (in 

basic pH). The isoelectric point of the suspensions can be 

observed in pH around 2; it means that it is advisable to work 

with pH range 6-10, as far from pH 2 as possible, because the 

suspensions are more stable in these ranges. For alumina, the 

zeta potential is around -77 mV (in acid pH) and -68 mV (in 

basic pH). The isoelectric point of the suspensions can be 

observed in pH around 2.5. Thus, the same pH range that 

kaolinite suspension is adequate for alumina as well. The 

suspensions at natural pH, around 8.5, were very stable.

Figure 8. 4. Zeta potential versus pH of suspensions: (a) 

alumina and (b) kaolinite. 

The thermogravimetric behavior of alumina and 

kaolinite is presented in Figure 5A. Kaolinite has a mass loss 

around 500 °C due to the loss of constitutional water 

(Albuquerque et al., 2007; Araújo et al., 2012). These 

transformations are shown in DSC curves (Figure 5B), 

corresponding to endothermic curves that are related to the 

evaporation of water.

The diffractograms of alumina and kaolinite, 

identified with Crystallography Open Database (COD) are 

shown in Figure 6. For alumina samples, all the peaks refer to 

the presence of crystalline phase of the rhombohedral type (?-

alumina or corundum, code 96-900-8095), and absence of 

amorphous phase. The diffractogram of kaolinite as well as 

that of alumina refers only to the presence of crystalline phase 

of monoclinic type (96-154-4873) and absence of amorphous 

phases.

 There is a decrease in the value of both apparent 

porosity and water absorption, as the solids content increases. 

This is because these phenomena are interconnected. It is 

possible to observe that there is no tendency to increase or 

decrease the density of the samples as the solids content 

increase, this was not expected because the relative density is 

the ratio of bulk density of the sample to the theoretical 

density of the material, and the bulk density is the ratio of the 

sample mass to its total external volume. The theoretical 

density is usually fixed, but increasing the amount of solids 

(with higher density), would increase the mass of the sample, 

consequently increase the relative density, but it must be 

considered that the samples have different compositions of 

solids, which directly affect the values of theoretical and 

relative densities.  



 

124 

 

Figure 7 shows the relationship of porosity and 

compressive strength of samples with only alumina and 

alumina/kaolinite mixtures. In this case, the mechanical 

strength is not directly proportional with the apparent 

porosity. For example, samples with the lowest and higher 

values of compression strength present both around 60% 

apparent porosity. This occurs because of different samples 

compositions.  

For the filters, a very high mechanical strength is not 

necessary, but a high porosity is essential. Considering this, 

the samples with 40 wt% solids (A15K25) and 50 wt% solids 

(A50 and A30K20) have suitable values of compression 

strength and apparent porosity.   

 

Figure 8. 7. Porosity versus compressive strength of alumina 

and alumina/kaolinite samples. 

Figure 8 shows the relationship of the percentage of 

the components (alumina and kaolinite) and the compressive 

strength. 



 

125 

 

 

Figure 8. 8. Effect of the composition (alumina and kaolinite) 

on the compressive strength. 

Samples with around 70 wt% of total solids have high 

values of compression strength, due to a larger alumina 

densification that occurs during sintering, but they are not 

suitable for this application because their permeability/flow 

rate is very less than the necessary for ceramic filters. Samples 

with alumina and kaolinite with similar percentage (around 50 

wt% of total solids) presented the best results of compression 

strength.  

8.3.3 Porosity and permeability of filters 

Considering this and other experimental data, samples 

with suitable values of apparent porosity and compression 

strength were chosen for the tests of permeability, A15K25 

and A30K20. Table 4 shows values of k1 (m2) and k2 (m), 

Darcyan and non-Darcyan permeability parameters 

respectively, of samples A15K25 and A30K20, comparing 

them with previously results of coarse and fine alumina (C 

and F) with the same percentage of total solids (40 and 50 

wt%).

Figure 8. 9. Permeability parameters, k1 (m

apparent porosity respectively, of samples with alumina 

(coarse, fine) and kaolinite, with 40 and 50 wt% solids. 

The Darcyan and non-Darcyan permeability 

parameters respectively do not present a direct relationship 

with the apparent porosity. Samples A50 and A15K24, for 

example, have a similar value of apparent porosity (around 

73%) and they have the lowest and the highest values, 

respectively, in both parameters (k1 and k2).  

Samples with the higher values of k1 and k2 were 

samples with alumina and kaolinite mixtures (A15K24 and 

A30K20), and their values of apparent porosity are suitable 

for the application aimed in this work. They have been 

inserted in a data map with data available in the literature 

(Figure 10) (Vakifahmetoglu et al., 2017). 



 

128 

 

 

Figure 8. 10. Location of permeability data of samples 

of alumina/kaolinite mixtures obtained in this work in a data 

map (Vakifahmetoglu et al., 2017). 

The values of k1 and k2, obtained in this work, were 

between values in data of granular filters (ceramic filters able 

to water purification) and fibrous aerosol filters (ceramic 

filters useful to allow savings in thermal energy with 

simultaneous removal of particulate material and chemical 

contaminants from flue gases) (Innocentini et al., 2009). Thus, 

the samples achieved the desired permeability values for 

drinking water filtration. 

Considering all the experimental data, sample 

A30K20, with 50 wt% solids (alumina 30 wt% and kaolinite 

20 wt%) was chosen to be used in the next steps of this work.  

Figure 11 shows SEM micrographs of sample 

A30K20 at the external surface (and at the fractured inner 

surface, with different magnifications.

Figure 8. 11. SEM micrographs of sample A30K20: A) 

external surface; B) fractured inner surface and C) the 

fractured inner surface with measurement of the pores 

indicated. 

In the micrograph of the external surface, it is possible 

to observe a strong characteristic of the freeze-casting process, 

the pores are aligned and directed, with homogeneous 

distribution. In the fractured inner surface, there is a 

homogeneous distribution of pores too, and the average size of 

pores measured in this micrograph is 1.55 µm. Comparing 

these pore sizes with the literature, they are suitable for water 

filtration (Lantagne, 2001; Yakub et al., 2012; Youmoue et al., 

2017). 

According to the application map of porosity versus 

pore or channel size (Figure 12), the sample A30K20, 

considering porosity and pore size, is within the range of 

“purification and filtration” (Vakifahmetoglu et al., 2017).

According to the CONAMA Resolution 396/2008, 

Table 6 shows the list of parameters with the highest 

probability of occurrence in groundwater, their respective 

Maximum Allowed Values (MAV) for each of the uses 

considered as preponderant and the Practicable Quantification 

Limits (PQL), considered as acceptable for the application of 

this Resolution.

Considering this, the water passed through the filter 

pellets was not suitable for the human consumption, but it is 

acceptable for the animal consumption and for recreation. The 

most probable numbers of total coliforms and E. coli had a 

large decrease after the filtration, reaching less than a half of 

the value allowed for animal consumption and less than an 

eighth of the value allowed for recreation. 

Turbidity can be caused by silt, sand and mud; 

bacteria and other germs; chemical precipitates (WHO, 2008). 

Achieving low turbidities in drinking-water is a proven 

indicator of pathogen removal and hence of drinking-water 

safety. Incidents of elevated turbidity have been associated 

with several outbreaks of disease (WHO, 2017a; Mann et al., 

2007). 

Mihelcic et al. (2009) stated that turbidity has a 

negative impact on many water treatment processes in 



 

132 

 

different ways, including clogging filters and therefore 

reducing their effectiveness. They also concluded that 

turbidity is easily measurable in the field with the use of a 

turbidity tube, and that the pretreatment turbidity limit for 

ceramic filters is between 15 NTU and 20 NTU. (Mihelcic 

et al. 2009; Salvinelli et al., 2016). 

The dirty/contaminated sample for the test of filter 

efficiency and turbidity was collected from a stream at UFSC. 

Its turbidity was 17.41 ± 2.42 NTU, in the range of the 

pretreatment turbidity limit for ceramic filters. Figure 13 

shows the turbidity of the water before (dirty/contaminated) 

(13A) and then of passing through the filter pellet (clean) 

(13B). 

 

Figure 8. 13. Turbidity of the water, A) before 

(dirty/contaminated) and B) then of passing through the filter 

pellet (clean). 

Table 7 shows the results of turbidity of the dirty 

(contaminated), clean (after filter) water, tap water and 

distilled water.  



 

133 

 

Table 8. 7. Turbidity of the dirty (contaminated), clean (after 

filter) water, tap water and distilled water. 

Sample Turbidity (NTU) 

Distilled Water 0.34 ± 0.23 

Tap Water 1.97 ± 0.81 

Dirty/ Contaminated 17.41 ± 2.42 

Clean/ After filter 0.56 ± 0.31 

 

Effective disinfection requires the water to have a low 

turbidity. Ideally, median turbidity should be below 1 

nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) (WHO, 1997). However, 

5 NTU is the minimum turbidity measurable with simple 

equipment (turbidity tube), so this level may be used in 

practice. If turbidity exceeds 5 NTU, then the water should be 

treated to remove suspended matter before disinfection 

(WHO, 2017b). Most of papers/guidelines affirms that 

drinking water should have a turbidity of 5 NTU or less 

(Brazilian Health Ministry, 2004; CONAMA, 2008; WHO, 

2008; WHO, 2017b). 

Considering this, our sample, after pass through the 

filter, has a turbidity of 0.56 ± 0.31 NTU, below the value 

allowed, below even the turbidity of tap water and close to the 

turbidity of distilled water. Attesting the efficiency of our 

filter considering the turbidity parameter. 

 

8.4 Conclusions 

 

Samples with only alumina C have high values of 

compression strength, but low values of permeability/flow 

rate. Samples with alumina C and kaolinite with around 



 

134 

 

50wt% of total solids have best results of compression 

strength with acceptable value of permeability/flow rate. 

The higher values of k1 and k2 were of samples with 

alumina and kaolinite, with suitable values of apparent 

porosity and a homogeneous distribution of pores, with 

average pore size of 1.55 µm, with pores between 1.04 and 

2.73 µm. 

The most probable numbers of total coliforms and E. 

coli had a large decrease after the filtration, reaching less than 

a half of the minimum value allowed for animal consumption 

and less than an eighth of the value allowed for recreation. 

The dirty/contaminated water, after pass through the 

filter, had a turbidity of 0.56 ± 0.31 NTU, below the value 

allowed, attesting the efficiency of our filter considering the 

turbidity parameter.

9 Freeze-cast porous ceramic filters impregnated 
with silver nanoparticles5 

9.1 Introduction 

 

Nanomaterials are systems in which at least one 

dimension is 1–100 nm in length. They present particular 

physical and chemical properties and can be used in numerous 

applications. Particularly silver, in the form of nanoparticles, 

has shown highly efficient antimicrobial properties (Singh and 

Nalwa, 2011; Dash et al., 2012; Leon-Silva et al., 2016; Díaz-

Soler et al., 2017). 

Silver is often used as an antibacterial agent to 

provide a sanitary environment for the wound healing process. 

It is considered as one of the most frequently used 

antibacterial substances before the invention of antibiotics. 

The multiplicity of silver’s bactericidal mechanisms gives it a 

wide range of effective applications in the inhibition of 

bacterial growth. The introduction of silver nanoparticles 

(AgNP) has allowed the scientific community to enhance 

antibacterial properties. Moreover, the increased surface area 

of nanoparticles induces an increased rate of interaction 

between the test subjects and ionic silver (Alexander, 2009; 

Nam et al., 2015; Bal et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2016; 

Mckevica et al., 2016; Amadio et al., 2017). 

Spectrophotometric analysis is one of the most widely 

used analytical techniques available. The largest use of UV-

Vis absorption spectroscopy lies in its application to 

quantitative analysis. The reasons for this stem from the ease 

with which most spectrophotometric measurements can be 

made, their sensitivity and precision, and the relatively low 

cost of instrument purchase and operation (Frank, 1997; 

Fereja, et. al, 2015).

136 

 

To quantify AgNP in suspension, a technique with a 

very low limit of detection is necessary, such as graphite 

furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). Graphite 

furnace is generally considered an ultratrace and microtrace 

analytical technique with limits of detection in the low 

picogram range, precision of a few percent (relative standard 

deviation) and a dynamic range of about three orders of 

magnitude. In addition to its high sensitivity, it is unique in its 

ability to handle microsamples including aqueous solutions, 

viscous liquids, slurries and even solids. GFAAS is an atomic 

spectroscopic technique in which a small sample is placed 

inside a graphite tube that is then resistively heated to 

accomplish sample desolvation (for liquid samples), ashing or 

charring (to decompose the sample and volatilize some of the 

matrix) and finally atomization (Holcombe, 2006). 

Stoimenov and co-workers (2002) demonstrated that 

highly reactive metal oxide nanoparticles exhibit excellent 

biocidal action against Gram-positive and Gram-negative 

bacteria (Stoimenov et al. 2002; Sondi 2004). One way to test 

the bactericidal properties in the filter pellets is the Disc 

Diffusion Test (also known as Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing). 

This is a test of the antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria. It uses 

antibiotic-impregnated pellets to test the extent to which 

bacteria are affected by those antibiotics. In this test, pellets 

containing antibiotic are placed on an agar plate where 

bacteria, Gram-positive or Gram-negative, have been placed, 

and the plate is left to incubate. In these tests, if an antibiotic 

stops the bacteria from growing or kills the bacteria, there will 

be an area around the pellet where the bacteria have not grown 

enough to be visible, it is called a zone or halo of inhibition 

(Mohanty 2010; Shahzada et al. 2014). 

Neomycin, the antibiotic used, is an aminoglycoside 

antibiotic produced during fermentation of Streptomyces 

fradiae with a high antimicrobial efficacy, and broad 

antibacterial spectrum. It inhibits the growth of Gram-negative 



 

137 

 

and Gram-positive bacteria (Adams et al. 1996; Chang-Chien 

et al. 2017). 

Gram-positive bacteria are bacteria that give a positive 

result in the Gram stain test. Gram stain differentiates bacteria 

by the chemical and physical properties of their cell walls by 

detecting peptidoglycan, which is present in the cell wall of 

Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria retain the 

crystal violet dye, and thus are stained violet, while the Gram-

negative bacteria do not; after washing, a counterstain is 

added (commonly safranin or fuchsine) that will stain these 

Gram-negative bacteria a pink color (Holt 1994). 

Enterococcus faecalis is formerly classified as part of 

the group D Streptococcus system – is a Gram-positive, 

commensal bacterium inhabiting the gastrointestinal tracts of 

humans and other mammals. It is usually outnumbered by 

strictly anaerobic bacteria (Russell et al. 2001; Ryan et al. 

2004). 

Escherichia coli, E. coli, is a Gram-negative, 

anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus 

Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of 

warm-blooded organisms (endotherms) (Singleton 1999; 

Olivier et al. 2010). 

In this work, an innovative approach for impregnation 

of porous ceramic filters, which can be used for water or 

wastewater treatment is proposed. Filter elements are 

produced by freeze casting, in which AgNP are impregnated 

in order to optimize reactive surface area and to enhance 

bactericidal effects. 

9.2 Materials and methods 

9.2.1 Raw materials and fabrication of filters 

Porous ceramic filters samples (20 mm diameter, 15 

mm thickness) of alumina (CT 3000, Almatis) and kaolinite 



 

138 

 

(Colorminas) were produced from mixtures of 30 wt% 

alumina, 20 wt%, kaolinite, 1.5 wt% Darvan C-N (Vanderbilt) 

and 38.5 wt% distilled. The slurry was homogenized, freeze-

cast, dried and sintered, as described in the flow chart in 

Figure 1, to produce porous filter elements.  

Silver nanoparticles were analyzed by Transmission 

Electron Microscope (TEM, JEM 1011, JEOL), with 

maximum acceleration voltage, 100 kV and magnification 

range, 800? to 600,000?. Particle size distribution was 

measured by direct light scattering (Zetasizer, Nanosizer – ZS, 

Malvern).

including impregnation of silver nanoparticles (AgNP). 



 

140 

 

9.2.2 Filter impregnation with silver nanoparticles and 
characterization 

 

The samples were impregnated with an aqueous 

solution of silver nanoparticles (TNS, 1000 µg/L, pH 4) by 

dip coating in a sealed borosilicate glass beaker, during 24 h. 

After that, a thermal treatment was performed in a resistive 

furnace (J 200, Jung) at a heating rate of 5 °C/min and dwell 

time of 2 h at 200 °C, to fix the silver nanoparticles on the 

sample surface (Amadio et al., 2017).  

The impregnated samples were coated with a thin 

layer of gold and characterized in a scanning electron 

microscope and energy dispersive x- ray spectroscopy 

(SEM/EDS, TM3030, Hitachi). EDS was used to provide 

rapid semi-quantitative analysis of elemental composition and 

to form map profiles, showing the AgNP distribution at the 

sample top and fracture surfaces. 

To test the efficiency of impregnation, leaching tests 

were performed using: 

? Mechanical stirring (overhead stirrer mixer) at 2000 rpm 
during 1 h (MS 1); 2 h (MS 2); 3 h, resting of 24 h and 

more 3 h (MS 3-24).  

? Centrifugation at 3600 rpm during 15 min (CE 15) and 30 
min (CE 30). 

? Ultrasonic bath during 5 min (UL 5) and 15 min (UL 15). 
 

To quantify silver in the leached water UV/VIS (UV-

1800, Shimadzu), at wavelength of 405 nm (Zamiri, et. al, 

2012; Vasireddy, et. al, 2012; Guzmán, et. al, 2009), and 

graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (PinA Acle 

900T, Perkin Elmer) with limit of detection of 0.35 ng/L and 

limit of quantitation of 1.16 ng/L were employed. 



 

141 

 

The efficiency of impregnation was estimated as a 

correlation of the amount of nanosilver fixed in the sample 

and to that leached in water, as shown in Table 1. 

Table 9. 1. Concentration of silver nanoparticles and the 

corresponding absorbance.

To obtain the linearity, the absorbance was plotted 

versus the concentration (g/mL) to obtain the Beer-Lambert 

calibration curve (Figure 2). The equation for the calibration 

curve was Y = 0.0778X - 0.2473, where Y is the absorbance 

and X is the concentration in g/L. The value of correlation 

coefficient (R2) was 0.9979. The result reveals that there is a 

strong linear relationship between the concentration of the test 

sample and the absorbance values over the concentration 

range 5 to 14 g/L (Figure 3). The second curve has the 

linearity and accuracy necessary but the range of analyte is not 

suitable, how is possible to observe in Figure 4, A is the color 



 

142 

 

of the sample with the analyte of the leached water and B is 

the color of solution which concentrations were in linearity 

curve. The solution A, and all the others leached waters were 

analyzed but their absorbance were less than 0.0045, so it is 

not in the range of the curve of linearity. Then it is possible 

affirm that the quantity of silver nanoparticle is below 

detection limit, so the quantity of AgNP are very small.

(g/mL) to obtain the Beer-Lambert calibration curve.

To analyze the bactericidal effects of AgNP in the 

filter pellets, the Disc Diffusion Test (Kirby-Bauer antibiotic 

testing) was used according to a standard approved by the 

NCCLS (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory 

Standards) (NCCLS, 2000). Two bacteria with distinct 

characteristics were chosen : Escherichia coli (Gram-

negative) and Enterococcus faecalis (Gram-positive). 

Pellets containing antibiotic (Neomycin) were placed 

on an agar plate with each bacteria type. The plate is left to 

incubate during 24 h at 35 °C. It was necessary to test if the 

antibiotic stops the bacteria from growing or kills them. The 

results show a halo of inhibition if silver has bactericidal

9.3 Results and Discussion 

9.3.1 Characterization of silver nanoparticles 

The particle size distribution of AgNP was determined 

by DLS (Figure 5). The average size is around 46 nm in the 

three measures, where some agglomeration of the particles in 

the micrometric range can be seen. 

 

Figure 9. 5. Size distribution of AgNP analyzed by DLS. 

            Figure 6 shows the curve of zeta potential versus 

pH of silver nanoparticle concentrated (AgNP-C) and 

diluted (AgNP-D) suspensions. In the diluted suspension, 

the pH is higher (around 8), it has a broader range of zeta 

potential than the concentrated suspension, which has a 

pH 4 and a zeta potential of -29.6 mV. The isoelectric 

point of the suspensions can be observed at pH around 

8.5. Thus, it is advisable to work with basic or acid 

suspensions, as far from pH 8.5 as possible, because the 

suspensions are more stable in these regions.

Nanosilver particles were analyzed by TEM, as shown 

in the micrographs in Figure 7.

magnifications and electron diffraction pattern.

Different spots or textures are seen due to the 

difference in crystallographic orientation or interference. 

Using an image processing software (ImageJ, version k 1.45), 

some particle considered in the same crystallographic 

orientation were measured, and the diameter size of these 

particles was between 10 nm and 16 nm, being the average 

around 13 nm. Figure 7D shows the distance between the 

transmitted point and the diffraction point, which determines 

the diffraction pattern.  

9.3.2 Characterization of AgNP-impregnated filters 

 

The final appearance of the AGNP-impregnated filter 

elements is shown in Figure 8.

nano-Ag. 

The impregnated samples were further characterized 

by a scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive x- 

ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). Figure 9 shows the 

micrographs of the outer and fractured surfaces of the 

samples. Figure 9A shows the external surface of the 

impregnated sample, and Figure 9B, the fractured sample. It is 

difficult to observe the nanoparticles in the structure due to 

their small size; in Figure 9C, fractured inner surface, it is 

possible to notice some agglomeration.

(fractured) surfaces of impregnated samples: A) outer, B) 

inner and C) inner in detail. 

To attest if this agglomeration is silver, EDS was used 

to provide rapid semiquantitative analysis of elemental 

composition. Figure 10 shows the micrograph with the spot 

from where EDS was performed. Firstly, a square area was 

chosen where a homogeneous distribution was present (Figure 

11A); then, a dot corresponding to an area of agglomerated 

nanoparticles was also analyzed (Figure 11 B), Table 2 shows 

the results of elemental analysis.

EDS was used also to do build up a profile map to see 

the distribution of silver nanoparticles on the surface and in 

the samples bulk. The texture of the porous ceramic filter 

surfaces impregnated with silver nanoparticles is shown in 

Figures 12 and 13, outer and inner bulk (fractured) surfaces, 

respectively. It is observed that the silver nanoparticles have a 

homogeneous distribution along both outer and fractured 

surfaces of the sample and the amount of nanosilver is 

apparently higher in the inner part (bulk) of the fractured 

sample.

GFAAS was applied to quantify silver nanoparticles 

with a lower limit of detection, as seen in Table 3.

GFAAS was applied to quantify silver nanoparticles 

with a lower limit of detection, as seen in Table 3. The results 

confirm that there is a very small amount of silver in the 

leached water. The initial suspension concentration was 1000 

µg/L; so that it is estimated that more than 99% of silver 

nanoparticles was fixed in the filter pellets. 

According to CONAMA (Resolution 396/2008), the 

Maximum Allowed Values (MAV) for metallic silver is 100 

and 50 µg/L for human consumption and recreation, 

respectively. 

Higher levels of silver, up to 0.1 mg/L (a 

concentration that gives a total dose over 70 years of 10 g), 

could then be tolerated without risk to health (WHO, 2014). 

Considering those values, the quantity of silver in the leached 

water is well below the values allowed and it is without any 

risk to health. 

The Disc Diffusion Test (Kirby-Bauer antibiotic 

testing) was performed to detect if the silver nanoparticles 

present inhibitory and bactericidal effects. Table 4 shows the 

results of this test.

In this test, the antibiotic and the nanosilver 

impregnated samples stopped the bacteria from growing or 

even killed the bacteria, because there was an area around the 

pellets where the bacteria have not grown enough to be 

visible, i.e., the halo of inhibition was present. In the pellets 

without nanosilver, the halo of inhibition was absent. 

Accordingly, the filter pellets impregnated with AgNP showed 

strong inhibitory and bactericidal effects. 

9.4 Conclusions 

Silver nanoparticles impregnation was very efficient, 

considering that around 99% of the initial silver was fixed in 

the filter elements through an easy method of impregnation, 

such as dipping. Graphite furnace atomic absorption 

spectrometry was a suitable technique to quantify the silver in 

the leached water. 

The silver nanoparticles were homogeneously 

distributed along the entire structure, both at the outer and at 

the inner bulk fracture surface. SEM/EDS detected the 

presence of nanosilver throughout the samples. 

The filter elements showed a strong bactericidal 

effect, according to the Disc Diffusion Test, which indicated 

the presence of a halo of inhibition in the pellets impregnated 

with silver nanoparticles and absence of this halo in the pellets 

without silver.

10 General conclusions 

 

Composites of bentonite/nanoparticles were 

successfully obtained by simple impregnation procedures, 

which can be performed either by imbibition or by dipping, 

with efficiency after washing with water over 99% in the case 

of nano-Ag, and over 90% for Au, Pd and TiO2 nanoparticles. 

Alternatively, porous pressed filters with only kaolinite 

have low porosity and low compression strength; samples 

with only alumina have a high densification and very low 

porosity (including samples with rice husks). Samples with 

kaolinite and alumina have a good strength after contact with 

water, but the permeability and flow rate did not reach enough 

values for a water filtration, with less than 0.01 l/h. Thus, 

pressed alumina or kaolinite filters were not suitable for the 

intended application. 

As an innovative approach, freeze-cast alumina with 

varying particle sizes were tested as water filters. Coarse 

alumina presented a higher solidification rate than fine 

alumina. The pore size for sample A50, around 3 ?m, was 

more suitable for water purification. 

The compression strength of fine alumina reached 

higher values, but with very low porosity. Conversely, coarse 

alumina presented a lower range of compressive strength, and 

the porosity remained higher in all the solids loads. 

Considering permeability parameters k1 and k2 obtained 

in this work, the porous alumina samples achieved the desired 

permeability values for water filtration, regardless the particle 

size. According to the experimental data, coarse alumina is 

more suitable for this application than fine alumina. 

Samples with coarse alumina and kaolinite with around 

50 wt% total solids presented the highest results of 

compression strength, an acceptable value of 



 

156 

 

permeability/flow rate, higher values of k1 and k2, and suitable 

values of apparent porosity with a homogeneous distribution 

of pores. According to the experimental data, samples with 

coarse alumina and kaolinite are more suitable for this 

application. 

The number of total coliforms and E. coli had a large 

decrease after filtration, reaching less than a half of the 

minimum value allowed for animal consumption and less than 

one eighth of the value allowed for recreation. 

The contaminated water, after passing through the filter, 

had a turbidity of 0.56 ± 0.31 NTU, below the value allowed, 

attesting the efficiency of filter considering the turbidity 

parameter. 

Silver nanoparticles impregnation was very efficient, 

with around 99% of the initial silver fixed in the filter 

elements, and with nanosilver homogeneously distributed 

along the entire structure. The silver impregnated filters 

showed a strong bactericidal effect.
