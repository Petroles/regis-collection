Resumo 
 

A engenharia de tecidos é uma área multidisciplinar da engenharia biomédica 

que articula conceitos da química, física, engenharia e medicina com o objetivo de 

recuperar ou substituir uma função perdida de determinado órgão ou tecido. Um dos 

principais desafios desta área da biotecnologia é a criação de matrizes tridimensionais 

biocompatíveis e biodegradáveis que sejam capazes de garantir um suporte físico e 

bioquímico adequado à regeneração celular. Assim, as características mecânicas, 

químicas e biológicas destas matrizes devem ser adaptadas ao ambiente celular que se 

pretende reproduzir, dando origem quer à resposta celular específica das células 

cultivadas na matriz, quer à otimização da resposta fisiológica do próprio organismo.   

Com efeito, dependendo da função a que se destina, as matrizes usadas em 

engenharia de tecidos variam tanto no biomaterial que lhes dá origem como na 

técnica de fabricação utilizada. As vantagens dos polímeros face aos outros materiais 

tais como biocompatibilidade, biodegradação, alta porosidade e boas propriedades 

mecânicas, tornam-nos no tipo de material mais utilizado na construção de matrizes 

tridimensionais. É o caso do copolímero PolyActive, já aprovado pela Food and Drug 

Administration (FDA) e utilizado em múltiplas aplicações em engenharia de tecidos, 

com especial destaque para a regeneração óssea. A versatilidade deste polímero está 

estreitamente relacionada com o rácio dos segmentos químicos que o constituem, um 

segmento hidrofílico de Politereftalato de etileno (PEOT) e outro hidrofóbico de 

Poli(tereftalato de butileno) (PBT), que ao ser modificado permite o controlo das 

propriedades mecânicas e químicas do material. Por outro lado, a eletrofiação é uma 

técnica de fabricação que tem crescido em termos de popularidade pois permite o 

fabrico de matrizes fibrosas capazes de simular detalhadamente a topografia das fibras 

de colagénio que compõem a matriz extracelular natural.      

Tendo tudo isto em conta, neste estudo foram construídas matrizes 

tridimensionais de PolyActive por eletrofiação capazes de modular e guiar a resposta 

celular a partir de recursos topográficos e bioquímicos. A topografia das matrizes foi 

controlada com a introdução de elétrodos capazes de influenciar o campo elétrico e, 

assim, alinhar as fibras de PolyActive durante o processo de eletrofiação, que ocorreu 

num ambiente controlado para garantir a reprodução das propriedades das fibras. Já a 

incorporação de biomoléculas na superfície das fibras foi conseguida a partir da 

investigação de duas estratégias distintas.   

Numa das abordagens, matrizes fibrosas de dois tipos de PolyActive 

(1000PEOT70PBT30 e 300PEOT55PBT45) foram expostas a irradiação ultravioleta (UV) 

com o objetivo de introduzir grupos químicos na superfície das fibras capazes de 

aumentar a adesão de biomoléculas. As diferenças entre superfícies tratadas e não 



 
 

tratadas com UV foram analisadas com recurso às técnicas de espetroscopia de 

infravermelho médio com transformada de Fourier acoplada ao acessório de reflexão 

total atenuada (ATR-FTIR) e de fotoeletrões excitados por raios X (XPS). Os resultados 

mostram que os grupos funcionais resultantes da interação da superfície das fibras 

com o UV dependem do rácio PEOT/PBT e do conteúdo de Polietilenoglicol (PEG) 

presente no copolímero. Assim, as fibras de 1000PEOT70PBT30 (PA 1000) 

apresentaram um grande número de grupos carboxilo e hidroxilo na sua superfície 

devido à degradação do segmento de PEOT e da sua grande cadeia polimérica de PEG 

após 40 minutos de exposição à radiação UV. Por sua vez, a matriz fibrosa de 

300PEOT55PBT45 (PA 300), quando sujeita ao mesmo período de irradiação UV, 

originou p-benzoquinonas na superfície das suas fibras devido ao alto teor cristalino da 

sua estrutura. Em ambos os casos, o tratamento UV aumentou as áreas de adesão das 

proteínas oriundas do meio de cultura celular e por conseguinte a adesão celular 

tornou-se também mais eficiente. Porém, a resposta celular é dependente não só das 

características das matrizes, mas também da linha celular utilizada. Por exemplo, as 

células Schwann de rato mostraram não só preferência pelas áreas ativadas pelo UV, 

mas também se mostraram sensíveis a pequenas alterações do alinhamento das fibras 

resultantes das diferenças entre os dois copolímeros. Foi também utilizada uma 

máscara de níquel para controlar espacialmente a introdução de novos grupos 

químicos nas superfícies das matrizes fibrosas de PA 300 e PA 1000.  

A segunda estratégia apresentada consistiu na eletrofiação de fibras de PA 300 

com grupos químicos incorporados para uma funcionalização posterior. Basicamente, 

uma solução polimérica composta por PA 300 e PEG com determinados grupos 

funcionais numa proporção 4:1 foi sujeita ao processo de eletrofiação, originando 

fibras de PA 300 com os grupos funcionais do PEG na sua superfície. Esta abordagem 

inovadora e inédita possibilitou a seleção dos grupos funcionais localizados na 

superfície das matrizes fibrosas e consequentemente o controlo do tipo de 

biomoléculas que vão aderir às fibras. Neste estudo foram utilizados dois tipos de PEG 

funcionalizado: PEG com terminais alcinos ((bis)PEG-Alkyne), que possibilitam a 

cicloadição azida-alcino com biomoléculas que tenham a função azida; e PEG  com 

grupos terminais de N-hidroxisuccinimida ((bis)PEG-SVA), que facilitam a ligação com 

proteínas. As superfícies das matrizes de PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA e de PA 300 + 

(bis)PEG-Alkyne foram analisadas recorrendo às técnicas de ATR-FTIR e XPS. No 

primeiro caso, os resultados provaram a existência de N-hidroxisuccinimida na 

superfície das fibras, que depois foi confirmada com recurso a microscopia de 

fluorescência; relativamente às matrizes de PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne, apesar das 

técnicas de espectrometria não produzirem resultados conclusivos, foi possível 

confirmar a presença de alcinos na superfície das fibras a partir das imagens de 

microscopia de fluorescência.  



 
 

O sucesso da segunda abordagem permite abrir as portas ao aparecimento de 

novas metodologias de design e fabricação de matrizes biofuncionais, já que torna 

possível a simulação e controlo do ambiente bioquímico que influencia as respostas 

celulares de uma forma simples e eficiente.   

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 
 

Abstract 
 

 The principal objective of a new generation of tissue engineering scaffolds is to 

reproduce the spatial and biochemical microenvironmental characteristics of the 

natural extracellular matrix (ECM) with the purpose of modulating the cell response 

and consequently enhance tissue repair. There is an enormous variety of scaffolding 

approaches that highly depend on the biomaterial selection, on the fabrication 

technique used and on the specific function of the scaffold.       

 In this study, bioactive electrospun scaffolds made of PolyActive (Poly(ethylene 

oxide terephthalate) / Poly(buylene terephthalate)  (PEOT/PBT)) copolymer, capable of 

combining a spatially organized structure with bioactive factors, was developed. The 

design and fabrication strategies used to create the scaffolds allow the tailoring of the 

scaffold’s function by manipulating the introduction of specific chemical groups on its 

surface for further selective immobilization of complex biomolecules, resulting in the 

desired cell response.  

 In one approach, the surface of both 300PEOT55PBT45 (PA 300) and 

1000PEOT70PBT30 (PA 1000) electrospun fibres were modified via UV exposure, 

resulting in the introduction of specific functional groups able to improve the protein 

adsorption process and consequently increase the available areas for cell attachment. 

A spatial definition of protein adsorption was accomplished by exposing the fibres via 

patterned mask.  

 An alternative strategy consisted of electrospinning PA 300 fibres with 

incorporated chemical groups for later functionalization. Alkyne and NHS-esters 

functional groups were successfully incorporated on the surface of the electrospun 

fibres via the introduction of specific PEG linkers ((bis)PEG-alkyne and (bis)PEG-SVA) in 

the electrospinning blend solution. This innovative methodology can be adopted for 

multiple tissue engineering applications since specific chemical groups can be 

introduced onto the surface of electrospun fibres, leading to a meticulous selection of 

the biochemical elements that will be adsorbed and consequently to a detailed control 

of the cell behaviour.

1. Introduction 

Tissue engineering is an interdisciplinary area that applies the principles of 

clinical medicine, mechanical engineering and materials science to increase and 

optimize the body’s natural response after tissue or organ damage. This field relies 

extensively in the use of 3D scaffolds able to provide suitable microenvironments that 

should mimic the natural extracellular matrix, providing both topographical and 

chemical cues to enhance cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation towards new 

tissue formation.     

Currently, there are two major tissue engineering approaches. The most 

popular strategy follows the idea that the new tissue should come from an implant 

with pre-cultured cells. In this approach, the seeded cells are usually isolated from the 

host target tissue and they should proliferate in an appropriate 3D dimensional 

scaffold, before implantation. The other strategy explains that, immediately after 

injury, an acellular scaffold should be implanted into the defect area. This particular 

scaffold should be functionalized with specific biomolecules able to recruit progenitor 

cells towards the injured area, and then promote their proliferation and differentiation 

with the purpose of regenerating the wounded tissue. Both strategies can also be 

combined since a functionalized scaffold can be useful in an ex-vivo situation by 

inducing cell seeding, proliferation and differentiation in order to encourage tissue 

formation after implementation in vivo. In this approach it is expected that the scaffold 

could continue to release signalling molecules with the purpose of enhancing the 

regeneration of the defect area, even after implementation [1]. 

In the light of these strategies, to achieve success in tissue engineering, it is 

necessary to combine and balance the role of cells, scaffolds and biomolecules. To 

accomplish that, it is crucial that the scaffold not only provides the physical support, 

but also the chemical agents that will modulate the injury microenvironment. 

Generally, the scaffold for tissue engineering should present good levels of 

biocompatibility and biodegradability as well as an architecture and mechanical 

properties adapted to its specific purpose.  So, there are three main topics that should 

be considered during the scaffold design: choice of the material, manufacturing 

technology and the final function of the scaffold.  

1.1. Materials 

The choice of a suitable material is a crucial step in the development of 

scaffolds for tissue engineering applications since the selected material will be 

responsible for facilitating the generation of a useful size and volume of tissue, allow 



18 
 

an efficient delivery of molecular and mechanical signals to the cells and it should also 

support the cells and optimize their function within the scaffold. In fact, as the goal of 

the scaffold is to mimic the advantageous characteristics of the natural extracellular 

matrix (ECM), the scaffolding material should present physical, chemical and biological 

properties that enhance biocompatibility and biodegradability in order to avoid 

unwanted host tissue reaction of the immune system and the damage of the tissues 

via toxic products, respectively [2,3,4].    

Some of the most common categories of biomaterials used in the fabrication of 

scaffolds for tissue engineering are ceramics, natural polymers and synthetic polymers.  

Ceramic scaffolds are mostly used in bone regeneration applications, such as 

grafting in bone replacement and coating metal implants, because of their mechanical 

stiffness, low elasticity and hard brittle surface. The most frequent biomedical ceramic 

is hydroxyapatite (HA) because of its structural and chemical similarity to the mineral 

phase of the native bone that assures biocompatibility as well as osteoblast 

differentiation and proliferation. However, ceramics also proved to be difficult to 

shape for implementation and tricky to adapt to other clinical applications due their 

brittleness and porous network structure [5,6,7]. 

In contrast to the ceramic scaffolds, polymers offer design flexibility since the 

composition, structure and arrangement of their constituent macromolecules can be 

adapted to different functions. Generally, polymers present appropriate properties for 

tissue engineering applications like biocompatibility, high surface-to-volume ratio, high 

porosity, biodegradation and good mechanical features [8]. There are two main types 

of polymers used as biomaterials: natural polymers and synthetic polymers.  

The natural polymers have a very elevated potential for achieving clinical 

success because they normally exhibit high levels of biocompatibility, biodegradability 

and low immunogenicity, which consequently enhance the cells performance in the 

biological systems. They can be classified as proteins (e.g. collagen and gelatin), 

polysaccharides (e.g. alginate and chitosan) or polynucleotides (DNA, RNA) [8,9]. 

Natural biomaterials, especially collagen based biomaterials, have been successfully 

used to support growth of axons and also to deliver multiple cell types into the 

nervous system after injury. Indeed, the importance of collagen in nerve regeneration 

applications can be exemplified by the three conduits made of collagen type I for 

peripheral nerve system regeneration already approved by the FDA (Food and Drug 

Administration): NeuraGen®, Neuroflex
TM

 and NeuroMarix
TM

 [10]. Besides nerve tissue 

engineering, natural polymers are currently used in several areas of tissue engineering 

such as bone tissue engineering [11] and they are also utilized as DNA carriers for gene 

delivery applications [12]. 



19 
 

Relative to the natural polymers, synthetic polymers offer some advantages 

which includes great design flexibility, reproducibility under controlled conditions and 

the control of both physical and chemical material properties like porosity, 

biodegradability and biocompatibility. In addition to this, they are cheaper and 

represent a more consistent source of raw materials than natural polymers; however 

there is a higher risk of rejection due the reduced biocompatibility comparing with 

natural polymers. Typically, the synthetic polymers used in tissue engineering 

applications are either hydrophobic biodegradable polyesters, such as polyglycolide 

(PGA), polylactide (PLA), poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL), or hydrophilic biodegradable 

polymers like Polyethylene oxide (PEO). Synthetic polymers can be easily combined in 

order to generate new biomaterials with desirable properties; in this way it is possible 

to create a material able to conjugate the mechanical properties of the hydrophobic 

polyesters with the cell affinity of the hydrophilic polymers. For example, poly-dl-lactic-

co-glycolic acid (PLGA) is a very versatile and well studied synthetic copolymer that has 

shown very good performances in mimicking the microenvironment that supports the 

cells. Some applications include bone [13] and nerve tissue engineering [14]. In fact, 

some copolymers like Degrapol® and PolyActive® have already found clinical use and 

are both already FDA approved.   

1.1.1. PolyActive 

The wide range of mechanical properties like elasticity, toughness and strength 

in combination with easy processability and high levels of biocompatibility offered by 

the copolymers of poly(ethylene oxide terephthalate)-poly(buylene terephthalate) 

(PEOT/PBT), make this class of copoly(ether ester)s one top candidate for tissue 

engineering applications [15,16].  

Like other segmented block copolymers, the properties of PEOT/PBT, are 

determined by the characteristics of the constituting segments: the hydrophilic 

poly(ethylene oxide terephthalate) segment adds the soft elastomeric, hydrogel-like 

behaviour into the copolymer while the hydrophobic poly(buylene terephthalate) 

introduces rigidity (Figure 1)[16,17].  

 

 

 

 

 

Deschamps et al. [16,18] have described the preparation of PEOT/PBT as a two 

step polycondensation of polyethylene glycol (PEG), 1,4-butanediol and dimethyl 

Figure 1. Chemical structure of PEOT/PBT copolymers. Adapted from [15].

terephthalate (DMT) in the presence of titanium tetrabutoxide as catalyst and Irganox 

1330 as antioxidant. Firstly there is a transesterification of PEG, DMT and 1,4-

butanediol under a nitrogen atmosphere at 180?C, then after two hours, the pressure 

slowly decreases (from 1000 to 0.1mbar) and the temperature is, at the same time, 

increased to 240?C in order to enable polycondensation. The composition of the block 

copolymers is designated as aPEOTbPBTc, where a is the starting PEG molecular 

weight, b the weight percentage of PEOT and c the percentage of the PBT hard 

segments. The soft segments weight contribution (b) is related not only with the 

contribution of PEO (polyethylene-oxide) and the terephthalate ester units (T) present 

in the soft segments, but also with the starting PEG molecular weight (Table 1).  

 The variations in the soft and hard segments ratio and in the PEG’s molecular 

weight used during the PEOT/PBT copolymers synthesis have different effects on the 

phase separation of the system and consequently in the tailoring of characteristics 

such as wettability [19,20], swelling [20], biodegradation rate [16,18], protein 

adsorption [19] and mechanical properties [16,20]. As the different macromolecules of 

block copolymers are covalently linked, the macrophase separation is unable to occur; 

however, microphase separation can still happen [16]. Therefore, the phase separation 

will be more distinct if there is an increase in PEOT length and in the PBT sequence 

with further crystallization of these blocks or in the polymers that contain high 

molecular weight PEG [16].  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 The swelling capacity and other polymer features like the flexible and plastic 

behaviour are highly influenced by controlling the polymer mesh size, that is, the 

effective length of the soft segment between the physical crosslinks. Thus a larger PEO 

content will result in a larger network mesh size and consequently in an improvement 

in the swelling ability and viscoelastic parameters. In contrast, decrease of the elastic 

moduli of the polymer will be noted [17,20].  

 The PEOT/PBT copolymers have been also extensively investigated in terms of 

in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility [18,21] and there are two major types of 

Table 1. PEO content (wt%) of PEOT/PBT copolymers produced with PEG of different molecular weights at diverse 
soft to hard segment ratios. Adapted from [16].   



21 
 

degradation process that can occur: hydrolysis of the ester bonds and oxidation of the 

ether bonds [16]. Because of the PEOT/PBT molecular structure, the degradation 

mechanisms rates varies from very low for low PEG molecular weight and high PBT 

content to high for larger contents of PEOT and longer PEO segments [21]. 

 During the hydrolytic degradation of the PEOT/PBT block copolymers in an 

aqueous media (Figure 2), the hydrophilic domain is more accessible to water uptake; 

this is because the ester bond present in the PEOT segment (ester A) is more liable to 

be attacked by water due the great hydrophobicity of the PBT segments [22]. Firstly, 

the hydrolysis will cause chain scissions of the PEOT segments and consequently 

provoke an entanglement of the remaining chain molecules, which will then reorganize 

themselves from a disordered state to an ordered state [22]. The continuous water 

absorption and the presence of carboxyl acids, that are resulted from the reaction, will 

initiate new chain scission events and eventually the ester bond in the crystalline 

region (ester B) will be also attacked by water; ultimately, the whole molecule is 

broken into pieces [16,22].             

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Unlike hydrolysis, the PEOT/PBT oxidation mechanism can easily occur in the 

presence of air and, similarly to other polymers containing PEO, it originates scission of 

the polymer chain via free radical reactions [16]. These radicals are usually produced 

by photonic activation of chromophores, which can be present either as internal (in-

chain) impurities such as hydroperoxides or carbonyls, or external impurities like 

Figure 2. Hydrolysis mechanism of PEOT/PBT in water: 1) The ester bond in the PEOT segment is attacked by water; 
2) The H from H2O joins to the oxygen atom in the OR’ part of the original ester and the OH part of the H2O joins to 
R; 3) The products of the reaction are a carboxyl acid and an alcohol. 



22 
 

polymerization catalyst residues or pollutants from the atmosphere [23,24]. Another 

possible sources of chromophores include unsaturated groups like C=O or C=C [25,26]. 

When the formation of the chromophoric radical occurs in the PEO segment, it 

will lead to the formation of a macroradical in the polymer backbone by hydrogen 

abstraction of the carbon atoms in the ?-position to the oxygen. The macroradical will 

then react with atmospheric O2 and produce an alkylperoxy radical (POO
.
).  After that, 

a new abstraction of a labile hydrogen from the same neighbouring macromolecule 

can lead to the formation of a hydroperoxide (POOH) that will be decomposed by 

thermal and photo degradation to generate an alkoxy radical (PO
.
) and a hydroxyl 

radical (HO
.
) (equation 1)[23,27]. An alternative pathway that describes the formation 

of the alkoxy radical is the recombinations of the alkylperoxy radicals following the 

Russell type mechanism [23,27,28]. This bimolecular recombination is described by the 

equation 2, where the peroxy radicals recombine and produce unstable tetraoxides (P-

OOOO-P). At the end of the reaction mechanism, the P-OOOO-P decomposes to give 

two alkoxy radicals in a cage and an oxygen molecule (Figure 3) [23,27].

 Figure 3. Oxidation of PEO: formation of alkoxy radicals via photo (h?) and thermal (?) conditions. 



23 
 

 The reaction presented in equation 2 is more common during photo-oxidation 

of PEO; on the other hand equation 1 usually happens when the PEO thermo-oxidation 

occurs. After the formation of the alkoxy radical, the oxidation process may proceed by 

three different pathways, depending on the environment conditions:         ?-scission, 

reaction with a hydroxyl radical and hydrogen abstraction reaction of alkoxy radical 

(Figure 4) [23,29].  

 The ?-scission of the radical leads to the formation of formate end groups that 

can be produced directly from the scission or from a supplementary pathway, where 

the oxidation of the macroradicals generated from the scission will lead to the 

formation of primary hydroporoxides. These primary hydroporoxides because of the 

thermal and photo-degradation will also produce formates [23].  

 Other alternative route leads to the formation of ester functions because of the 

reaction of alkoxy radicals with hydroxyl radicals under thermo-oxidative conditions. 

Alternatively, the alkoxy radical can be involved in a hydrogen abstraction reaction 

which will form a thermal unstable hemiacetal that will be decomposed to alcohols 

and carboxylic acids [23,29].  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Morlat et al. [23] have studied the PEO oxidation mechanism and concluded 

that the photo-oxidative conditions favour the ?-scission of the alkoxy radicals and 

consequently the generation of formats in a ratio of 5:1 against chain esters. On the 

Figure 4. Oxidation of PEO: formation of the final products via three different pathways. 



24 
 

other hand, under thermo-oxidative conditions the production ratio of formates and 

esters are similar [23,30].  

 Besides the PEO oxidation mechanism, the PEOT segment can offer an 

alternative oxidation mechanism via the terephthalate ester units (Figure 5). The key 

event in this degradation process is also the scission of the polymer main chain that 

generates carboxyl end groups, volatile products such as CO and CO2 and it can also 

produce mono or dihydroxy terephthalates [31].  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Relative to the PBT segment, the oxidation process is a complex mechanism in 

which both photolytic and photo-oxidative reactions interfere [32,33]. The activation 

of the chromophore groups can lead to three direct photo-scission processes 

(equations 3, 4 and 5) that will generate primary radicals [32]. These radicals are able 

to provoke the oxidation of the carbon atom located in the ?-position to the oxygen 

ester by abstraction of labile hydrogen atoms, leading to the formation of 

hydroperoxides. During photo-oxidation, there is also possible that some 

hydroperoxides are formed on the aromatic rings (Figure 6) [32,33].  

 

 equation 3 

 equation 4 

Figure 5. Photo-oxidative reactions of PEOT.    



25 
 

 

 

 equation 5 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 In both cases presented in Figure 6, the homolysis of the hydroperoxides O-O 

bond generates alkoxy and hydroxyl radicals [33,34]. The alkoxy radicals located on the 

aromatic ring are able to participate in a hydrogen abstraction reaction involving the 

polymer chain that will lead to the formation of mono and di-hydroxy-substituted 

compounds [33,35]. These compounds can also be produced if the hydroxyl radicals, 

originated from the O-O homolysis at the ester’s ?-carbon, react with the aromatic 

rings of the PBT segment (Figure 7) [33]. The characteristic yellowing of the samples 

containing PBT can be related to the formation of these compounds and with their 

further degradation [36].

ester. Adapted from [35].  



26 
 

 The alkoxy radicals produced by the degradation of the unstable 

hydroperoxides in the carbon ?-position will follow a similar chain of reactions showed 

in the Figure 5 [32].  

In summary, the PEOT/PBT copolymers are excellent candidates as scaffolds in 

the engineering of both hard and soft tissues because of the easy adaptable properties 

described above and the good results in the in vivo and in vitro biocompatibility tests, 

which have allowed the FDA approval for clinical applications as cement stopper and 

bone filler in orthopaedic surgery (PolyActive®) [15,18,20].     

1.2. Fabrication Techniques 

There are several techniques to shape polymers into advantageous, complex 

and reproducible scaffolds that exhibit useful properties for specific tissue engineering 

applications. The selection of one fabrication technique deeply depends on the desired 

purpose of the scaffold and the bulk and surface properties of the material. 

Fibrous scaffolds are very popular since they can successfully mimic the 

architecture of the native extracellular matrix at the nanoscale level. In fact, the 

diameter of the nanofibres that form the scaffold apparatus ranges from 1 to 1000 nm, 

matching the size scale of extracellular matrix fibres such as collagen (50 to 500 nm). In 

addition to this, the combination of the high surface area to volume ratio with the 

microporous structure of the nanofibres enhances cell adhesion, proliferation, 

migration and differentiation [8,37,38]. There are three production methods that are 

commonly used to produce fibrous scaffolds: phase separation, self assembly and 

electrospinning.  

Phase separation is a method used to build scaffolds by thermally inducing the 

separation of a homogeneous polymer solution into a multiphase system, which 

comprises a polymer-poor phase (low polymer concentration) and a polymer-rich 

phase (high polymer concentration). Generally, phase separation begins with a 

polymer dissolution that is followed by a liquid-liquid phase separation process. Then, 

the upper critical temperatures originate both polymer-poor phase and polymer-rich 

phase via polymer gelation. At the end, the polymer-rich phase solidifies to form a 

matrix and the polymer-poor phase originates pores due the solvent removal. The 

fibre diameter can be modulated by selecting appropriate gelling temperature (high 

temperatures lead to microfibres and lower temperatures originate nanofibers); on 

the other hand, the polymer concentration influences the mechanical properties 

(tensile modulus and tensile strength) of the fibres. Although the phase separation 

technique do not require specialized equipment and assures the desired shape for the 

scaffold, it can only be performed by a limited number of polymers (e.g. PLGA and 

chitosan) and it offers little control over the pre size distribution [37,38,39].    



27 
 

 The self assembly process can be defined as an autonomous organization of 

components such as biomolecules into complex structures due to noncovalent bonds 

or weak covalent interactions such as electrostatic, van der Walls and hydrophobic 

interactions. So, in order to build fibrous scaffolds it is necessary that small units like 

proteins assemble into nanofibres with high aspect ratio, which can mimic the in vivo 

microenvironment of the cells. In fact, this approach can be applied in vivo in order to 

create a nanofibre system able to connect neighbouring cells and consequently 

organize a three dimensional network capable of mechanically support them. For 

example, a peptide amphiphile (PA)-based-self-assembling system allows the 

generation of thermally stable protein-like nanofibres with the purpose of mimicking 

the extracellular matrix; one possible application of this system uses the changes of 

the microenvironment pH to induce self assembly processes for bone tissue 

engineering. However, self assembly is not a very common approach for tissue 

engineering purposes as it is limited to few polymers and it has low economic viability 

[37,38,39].       

Electrospinning is the most popular fabrication technique to create fibrous 

since it simpler and more cost effective, compared with both self assembly and phase 

separation. Because of that, the electrospinning principles will be discussed in detail in 

the following section. 

1.2.1. Electrospinning 

Electrospinning is a fairly time- and cost-efficient technique that is used to 

produce ultrafine micro or nanofibres with considerable surface areas and porosity, 

flexibility in surface functionalities and advanced mechanical performance (stiffness 

and tensile strength).   

The equipment needed for the electrospinning process includes a syringe 

pump, a high voltage source and a collector. The procedure is relatively simple and it 

basically involves the formation of polymer fibres due to electrostatic repulsion of a 

polymer solution (Figure 8). At the beginning of the process, the polymer solution is 

held to the needle tip of the syringe (spinneret) via surface tension. Then, the 

introduction of an electric field originates mutual charge repulsion within the polymer 

solution that is directly opposite to the surface tension. Upon reaching a critical 

voltage, the electrostatic force generates localized charges that counterbalance with 

the surface tension of the polymer solution at the spinneret tip, leading to droplet 

elongation and stretching until a conical shape known as the Taylor cone is formed, 

and a continuous jet is ejected. Initially, the polymer jet travels directly towards the 

grounded collecting plate; however, it will deviate from the most direct path, resulting 

in a spiralling and further stretching, when the charge density (that increases with the 

increasing distance from the spinneret) overcomes the surface tension. Finally, the 



28 
 

polymer jet thins in air because of the elongation and the evaporation of the solvent, 

leading to the formation of electrospun fibres on the target [37,38,40].  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Electrospinning can be performed using a wide range of polymers. In fact, 

several synthetic polymers like poly(lactic acid) (PLLA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid, 

poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) and Polyethylene glycol (PEG) have been successfully used 

to electrospin nanofibres for several tissue engineering applications. For instance, Shin 

et al. [41] have construct a nanofibre-based PLGA scaffold with the potential of 

enhanced articular cartilage reconstruction. In another example, hBM-MSCs were able 

to produce cartilagineous extracellular matrix after being successfully cultured in PCL 

electrospun nanofibres for cartilage tissue engineering purposes [42].      

Natural polymers such as collagen or chitosan can also be electrospun; however 

they are usually blended with synthetic polymers or salts in order to increase the 

solution viscosity and consistency [38,40]. For example, Jeong et al. [43] have 

electrospun composite alginate/ chitosan by adding PEO to the polymer solution. The 

authors used the ability of this synthetic polymer to increase the polymer chain 

entanglements and decrease the conductivity of the charged polysaccharide solutions 

in order to aid the electrospinning process.  

Figure 8. Schematic of the electrospinning process. Adapted from [40]. 

 



29 
 

The sizes of the electrospun fibres are typically between 200 nm and 5 mm, 

depending on the conditions. In fact, fibre morphology can be easily controlled by 

adapting the parameters of the electrospinning process. These parameters can be 

classified in system parameters, process parameters and ambient parameters [37,40].  

The system parameters are mainly associated with the solution properties such 

as viscosity/polymer concentration, conductivity, surface tension and polymer 

molecular weight. Generally, increasing the viscosity of the solution by increasing 

polymer concentration leads to the formation of uniform fibres (without beads and 

junctions) with larger diameter. Variations in the conductivity by adding salt normally 

result in small diameter fibres with fewer beads present. A decrease on beading can 

also be accomplished with higher molecular weight polymers. The effects described 

above can be very difficult to isolate due the inter-connected relationship between all 

the polymer solution parameters. For example, it is very common that the conductivity 

variations affect the viscosity of the polymer solution [37,44,45].           

On the other hand, the process parameters are related with the controlled 

variables such as flow rate, electric field strength, distance between the spinneret and 

the collector, needle tip design and collector composition and geometry. The effects 

on the fibre morphology after an increase on the applied voltage are increased 

beading and decreased diameter. On the other hand, increasing distance from the 

collector can result in decreased fibre diameter and decreased fibre wetness due the 

longer evaporation time of the solvent from the nanofibres. Contrary, when the flow 

rate increases, there are an increment in fibre wetness and bead formation [37,44,45].      

The ambient parameters like humidity and temperature are also important for 

tailoring the nanofibres. As the increasing of the temperature leads to a decrease of 

the polymer viscosity, the electrospun fibres usually present a smaller diameter. The 

humidity can affect the morphology of the fibre by the appearance of pores. Although 

there are studies that corroborate these results, these parameters are poorly 

understood because their effects depend on the type of polymer, polymer-solvent 

combination, molecular weight and polymer hydrophilicity [44,45].  

Overall, electrospinning has been distinguished as an efficient and versatile 

technique for the fabrication of polymer micro or nanofibres. In fact, the electrospun 

scaffolds can be tailored in order to mimic the native extracellular matrix and 

consequently support the attachment and proliferation of a large variety of cell types. 

Regardless, it can be a big challenge to engineer scaffolds with complex structures 

using only the electrospinning approach.      

 

 



30 
 

1.3. Scaffold function 

The term “bioactive scaffold” is currently applied in the tissue engineering field 

to describe a scaffold capable of not only supporting the cells physically and 

mechanically, but also enhancing cell adhesion, migration and proliferation as well as 

phenotype choice via biochemical agents. The goal of these scaffolds is to recreate the 

functions of the extracellular matrix in a temporally and spatially organized structure 

[1].  

In this way, the function of an optimal scaffold would be providing cell guidance 

and all aspects of cell response in a similar way as the ECM. Generally, the functions of 

the ECM include providing structural support and mechanical properties for cells to 

reside, bioactive cues to enable cells to respond to various signals of their 

environment, a flexible physical environment to allow a quick and efficient remodelling 

in case of tissue dynamic process like wound healing and it also act as reservoir of 

biomolecules and mediates their release. Currently, the scaffolds are able to closely 

mimic all this features due the physical and chemical characteristics of the materials 

used and also the microfabrication techniques selected. As explained above, 

electrospinning can efficiently produce nanofibres with similar dimensions as the 

collagen fibres from the natural extracellular matrix [46,47].  

In terms of bioactivity, scaffolds can be adapted to interact with the cellular 

components and consequently facilitate and regulate their actions in a dynamic way. In 

order to accomplish that, the chemistry of the surface should not be only dependent 

on the properties of the bulk material, but also on the incorporation of biological cues 

like cell-adhesive ligands (e.g. fibronectin) to promote cell attachment [46]. For 

example, the surface properties of the poly-acrylonitrile methyl acrylate (PAN-MA) 

electrospun scaffold were improved by fibronectin adsorption, which proved to 

influence both the Schwann cells migration and the neurite outgrowth from dorsal 

root ganglion culture [48]. The scaffolds could also be used as reservoirs or delivery 

structures for biomolecules such as growth factors. Both hydrogels and electrospun 

fibres are very popular examples of this type of approach [1,46]. In fact, Holland et al. 

[49] have managed to create a oligo(poly(ethylene glycol)fumarate / gelatin 

(OPF/gelatin) hydrogel able to simultaneously deliver insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-

1) and transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF- ?1) in a controlled manner to cartilage 

tissue engineering applications. Similarly, Wang et al. [50] have accomplished to 

release recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP-2) from an 

electrospun scaffold for bone tissue engineering applications. Besides the biological 

cues, it is also important that the scaffold provides physical cues like topography to 

modulate cell morphology and alignment [46]. In tissue engineering approaches, the 

incorporation of biological and mechanical cues on the surface of the scaffold usually 

occurs after application of some specific surface modification technique.     



31 
 

2. State of the Art 

The combination of natural and synthetic polymers can optimize the physical 

and biological properties of the electrospun scaffolds, as well as mimic the morphology 

of the extra cellular matrix. However, in order to reach advanced biological and 

therapeutic applications, the surface of the fibres should be able to immobilize some 

active agents such as proteins and therapeutic genes without compromising the bulk 

properties.  

For tissue engineering purposes, the role of the immobilized biomolecules on 

the nanofibres surface should be comparable to the function of the biochemical cues 

present in vivo during tissue regeneration, which is enhancing the specific phenotype 

and organization of the cells. According to this, several techniques of surface 

modification such as plasma and radiation treatment are being used on the surface of 

the electrospun scaffolds to directly enhance cell attachment and proliferation via 

protein and peptides adsorption. A complementary approach can be followed in the 

event of the adsorbed biomolecules are further released into the cell environment in a 

controllable and localized way to promote cell differentiation and proliferation.  

In addition to the tissue regeneration proposes, the nanofibre meshes could be 

also used in drug delivery applications since the highly interconnected open nano-

porous structure provides an extremely high surface area to volume ratio that results 

in a considerable drug loading amount per unit mass.  

The electrospinning modality can also influence the properties of the surface by 

inducing diversification on the performance of the scaffolds. Indeed, the 

electrospinning technique can be adapted in order to control the composition of the 

core-shell structure of the fibres or to modulate the surface patterning by topographic 

cues.     

In this way, it is important to understand which techniques are commonly used 

on surface functionalization and what advantages each one brings into tissue 

enginnering applications (section 2.1). The biomolecule delivery approach will be 

presented in section 2.2 and the applications that come from different electrospinning 

modalities will be explained in section 2.3.   

2.1. Surface Modification of electrospun fibres 

The main goal of the surface modification techniques is introduce functional 

groups on the surface of the electrospun fibres able to immobilize secondary bioactive 

molecules, guaranteeing at same time good biocompatibility levels and the 

preservation of the fibres morphology and their bulk properties [51,52].   



32 
 

Gas plasma treatment is a common, suitable and versatile technique that is 

mainly employed to generate functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl and amino 

groups on the polymer surface. Normally, it results in an increase of the surface 

wettability without changing the bulk properties of the material or causing 

degradation; moreover, it can be used in complex shaped surfaces and it is a solvent 

free technology [51,53].  

Plasma is a high energy state of matter, in which an oxygen or nitrogen 

containing gas or an inert gas is partially ionized [51,53]. There are two major 

categories of plasma: the thermal plasmas that cannot be used for biomedical 

polymers functionalization due to the high temperatures of the gas; and the non 

thermal plasmas that can be utilized in tissue engineering applications since the 

combination of low gas temperature and high electron temperature is able to originate 

chemical and physical changes on the surface without causing any thermal damage 

[53]. 

For tissue engineering applications the appropriate selection of the gas 

(oxygen, air or ammonia) used in the plasma treatment is a critical topic because it 

decides the functional groups that will be introduced on the target surface and 

consequently the specific biomolecules that can be covalently immobilized (e.g. 

collagen, gelatin, laminin and fibronectin) [54,55]. Poly(L-lactic acid)-co-poly(?-

caprolactone) electrospun fibres treated with air plasma were able to immobilize 

collagen on their surface and consequently improve the attachment, spreading and 

viability of the coronary artery endothelial cells [56]; in a similar example, Argon 

plasma treatment was used by Duan et al. [57] in order to build a collagen coated 

poly(?-caprolactone) electrospun scaffolds capable of enhancing the attachment, 

spreading and proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts. In other cases, electrospun 

PLLA nanofibres pre-treated with plasma were used to adsorb laminin [58] and 

cationized gelatin [59] for neural and cartilage tissue engineering applications, 

respectively. 

The wet chemical processes like hydrolysis and aminolysis are also suitable 

approaches to create new functionalities on the surface of biomedical polymers. The 

procedure involves the reaction between the scaffold and liquid reagents under basic 

or acidic conditions to generate functional groups by random chemical scission of the 

ester linkages on the backbone chain located on the surface. Indeed, the degraded and 

water insoluble polymer fragments, that result from the wet chemical process, are 

able to generate carboxylic, hydroxyl and amino groups [51,53,54]. Although this 

process is relatively simple since it does not require specialized equipment, the results 

are often non specific and non reproducible [53]. So, the duration of the hydrolysis and 

the concentration of the hydrolysing agents are essential to optimally produce 



33 
 

functional groups without altering significantly the bulk properties of the scaffold 

[51,54].   

The applications of the wet chemical process concerning electrospun fibres are 

mostly related with bone tissue engineering applications. One example was developed 

by Jim et al. [60] who were able to create a suitable environment for the proliferation 

and function of osteoblasts using an electrospun poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL) fibrous 

scaffold treated by a controlled hydrolysis in a NaOH medium.   

The use of radiation is another method used in tissue engineering applications 

to modify biomedical polymer surfaces. The most common category of irradiation 

technique uses ultraviolet light (UV); however there are other types of radiation able 

to introduce chemical groups on scaffolds’ surfaces such as gamma radiation, ozone 

treatment and ozone combined with UV irradiation. The goal of the radiation approach 

is to generate reactive areas that can become functional groups or can be used to 

initiate grafting of monomers or graft polymerization. In fact, radiation is a simple and 

clean surface modification method since it does not require chemical additives or 

catalysts, though the dependence on the energy source can lead to nonspecific and 

non permanent degradation of the polymer backbone  [51,53].  

The surface modification via UV irradiation is commonly used in tissue 

engineering applications due its direct effect on protein adsorption and consequently 

on the cell adhesion process [61]. For example, Welle et al. [62] were able to modify 

the surface of electrospun Poly(propyl carbonate) (PPC) fibres via deep UV irradiation 

in order to increase the adsorption of proteins that stimulate cell adhesion. The study 

showed positive results with both L929 fibroblasts and primary rat hepatocytes cell 

lines. The UV irradiation can be also used to photo-reduce the Ag
+
 ions within cellulose 

acetate (CA) nanofibres to build antimicrobial separation filters [63]. Basically, the CA 

nanofibres electrospun from a combined CA / AgNO3 solution were irradiated with UV 

light with the purpose of producing Ag nanoparticles on their surface.   

The relevance of the graft polymerization induced by UV irradiation in the 

construction of advanced and specific electrospun scaffolds was discussed by Chua et 

al. in several reports. In one example, the polyethersulfone (PES) electrospun 

nanofibre scaffold was firstly carboxylated by UV-initiate poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc) 

grafting and then functionalized with amino groups to facilitate the adhesion and 

expression of umbilical cord blood hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) [64]. 

In another approach followed by the same author [65], a nanofibre scaffold 

functionalized with galactose was used to study the attachment, the phenotype and 

the functional maintenance of rat hepatocytes. This strategy is summarized in the 

Figure 9: initially the Poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc) was grafted onto the surface of the 

electrospun poly(e-caprolactone-co-ethyl ethylene phosphate) (PCLEEP) scaffold via 

UV irradiation; then, the surface carboxyl (COOH) groups were covalently conjugated 



34 
 

with 1-O-(60-aminohexyl)-D-galactopyranoside (AHG) via N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide 

(sulfo-NHS) / 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) complex in order 

to allow cells attachment through galactose -  asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) 

interactions.    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Besides the UV irradiation treatment, there are other valid options like gamma 

irradiation that can be used on surface modification procedures. For instance, it can be 

used to graft Acrylic acid (AAc) on Poly(L-lactic co-poly-?-caprolactone) (PLCL) for 

further immobilization of gelatin; this strategy was applied in a study of the adhesion, 

spreading and proliferation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) by Shin et al. 

[66]. Using a similar electrospun scaffold, but utilizing photo-grafting Arg-Gly-Asp 

(RGD) containing peptide instead of gelatin, it was possible study the adhesion and 

proliferation of the MC3T3-E1 pre-osteblastic cells [67]. 

2.2. Electrospun fibres for the delivery of 

bioactive molecules 

The surface of the electrospun scaffolds can be chemically functionalized with 

the purpose of achieving sustained delivery of bioactive molecules. This means that 

instead of having proteins immobilized on the surface to enhance cell adhesion, the 

scaffolds should ensure the bioactivity of the incorporated biomolecules and fit their 

release profile within the adequate time frame [1]. The signalling molecules used 

depend on the function of the scaffold: cell division can be stimulated by mitogens; the

35 
 

migration, proliferation and differentiation can be accomplished by the release of 

proteins such as growth factors and the control generation of tissue form can be due 

to the morphogens action [68].          

Although growth factor delivery scaffolds are usually fabricated using hydrogels 

due their defined three-dimensional polymer networks that allows easy incorporation 

of proteins, their limitations like poor mechanical properties, cell death in the depths 

of the scaffold and the impossibility of having a controlled release over a long time 

period [69,70] have turned electropun fibres into a viable alternative for protein 

delivery approaches. Indeed, the electrospun scaffolds can easily act as a drug carrier 

since their structural characteristics allow good dissolution rate, relative ease of drug 

incorporation and limited time for dug crystallization [71]. 

Besides the protein release issue, electrospun scaffolds could also be adapted 

for gene delivery. The differences between the scaffolds are related with the 

particularities of both delivery systems:  contrary to the growth factors, which act 

extracellularly by binding to cell surface receptors, target genes must enter into the 

host genome of endogenous cells, transforming them into bio-activated actors able to 

produce therapeutic proteins. So, the target genes are usually packed within vectors 

(viral and non-viral) before incorporation into the scaffold in order to protect the 

genes from degradation [1].      

Physical surface adsorption is a simple approach to load biomolecules into 

electrospun scaffolds. Basically, the fibres are dipped into an aqueous phase (solution 

or emulsion) containing biomolecules, which consequently attach to the scaffold via 

electrostatic forces. For example, BMP-2 was released by a poly(D,L-lactide-co-

glycolide)/hydroxyl-lapatite (PLGA/HAp) electrospun scaffold to enhance bone 

regeneration after being successfully adsorbed by the fibres [72]. The PLGA/Hap 

electrospun scaffold also proved to be very promising as a DNA delivery device since it 

was also tested for encapsulation of BMP-2 plasmid DNA/chitosan nanoparticles. The 

DNA/chitosan nanoparticles released from the PLGA/Hap fibres proven to have a 

remarkable intracellular effect in the human marrow stem cells (hMSCs) by improving 

their attachment, viability and transfection efficiency of DNA [73].  

In another method named blend electrospinning, biomolecules are mixed 

within the polymer solution in order to electrospin a hybrid scaffold. As this strategy 

localizes the biomolecules (e.g. proteins) within the fibres of the scaffolds, it allows 

more sustained release profiles compared to physical adsorption [1,51]. The common 

protein release from blend electrospun scaffolds is divided in two periods: during the 

first 24 hours a burst release occurs due a certain fraction of proteins that are located 

on the surface of the scaffold; after this period, a sustained release close to a linear 

mode is observed because of either the protein diffusion process or the polymer 

degradation process combined with protein diffusion. So, different polymers with 



36 
 

specific properties will originate unique release behaviours [1]. Besides the release 

profile, the preservation of the biological activity of the biomolecules is a very 

important prerequisite in designing electrospun scaffolds with the purpose of delivery 

[51]. For example, basic fibroblast growth factors were introduced into PLGA fibres and 

their release favoured bone marrow stem cell attachment, proliferation and 

differentiation [70]. Blend electrospinning was also used to build a PEO/ Bovine serum 

albumin (BSA) scaffold [74] and a PLLA / laminin electrospun scaffold capable of 

enhance PC12 cell viability and neurite outgrowth [58].     

2.3. Fabrication of electrospun fibres with the 

defined structure 

The function of the electrospun scaffolds can be modulated through the use of 

several innovative electrospinning techniques that permit the fabrication of multi-

layered electrospun fibres and the control of topographic cues.    

The core-shell structure is a very useful nanofibre scaffold shape because this 

structure is capable of containing bioactive agents such as proteins, drugs and 

enzymes within the core and consequently control their release kinetics. The 

electrospinning modality used to fabricate this kind of scaffold is called coaxial 

electrospinning, in which both polymer solution and biological solution are coaxial and 

simultaneously electrospun without direct mixing by using two aligned syringes (Figure 

10). As explained in the section 1.2.1, during coaxial electrospinning, it is necessary to 

apply appropriate parameters in order to fabricate a suitable electrospun scaffold. 

Therefore, several factors like feeding rate of the inner and outer fluids, interfacial 

tension and viscoelasticity of the two solutions can influence the process output by 

affecting the entrapment of components in the core part and the dimensions of both 

inner and outer diameters [1,51].    

 Coaxial electrospinning was recently used for both tissue engineering and drug 

delivery applications since the release profile includes an initial burst released followed 

by a sustained release period, which is analogous to the one from blend electrospun 

scaffolds presented in the previous section. However, the initial burst release from the 

coaxial electrospun fibres is inferior in volume and consequently more prolonged 

because of the core characteristics that work as a reservoir system with a 

biodegradable polymer barrier able to control the biomolecules diffusion rate [1,51]. 

For example, Sahoo et al. [70] have showed that PLGA coaxial nanofibres are capable 

of sustaining the release of bFGF from its core for two weeks, a much longer period 

than the release profile of basic fibroblast growth factors incorporated in a PLGA / 

bFGF blend scaffold. The release kinetics of proteins from coaxial electrospun scaffolds 

was thoroughly studied by Zhang et al. [75] that have encapsulated fluorescent-labeled 



37 
 

BSA protein along with PEG in PCL nanofibres with variable dimensions. The report 

indicated that the release rate is fibre size dependent, which means that smaller-sized 

fibres have a faster release then the larger ones. These results were able to provide 

basis for further design and optimization of protein delivery from coaxial electrospun 

fibres for several tissue engineering applications. For instance, the coaxial electrospun 

methodology was successfully applied in the building of a composite poly(lactic acid-

caprolactone) / nerve growth factor (P(LLA-CL)/NGF)  nerve conduit able to promote 

sciatic nerve regeneration in rats [76].  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Besides the chemical rearrangement of the electrospun fibres, the physical 

organization and orientation of the fibres also play important roles during the design 

of the scaffold. This is because the scaffolds should replicate the natural structure of 

the extracellular matrix, which contains components that are arranged into extremely 

organized structures to control cell responses [51]. 

 For tissue regeneration applications, the alignment of the fibres can be a critical 

feature since the cells cultured on such scaffolds are able to recognize the geometry 

and then align themselves along the fibres [51]. There are two major methods that can 

be used to accomplish aligned electrospun fibres: high speed rotating drum collector 

and stationary gap collector.  

The use of the rotating drum collector is a simple and mechanical method of 

aligning the fibres along the circumference of the cylindrical drum. Basically, the 

collector (grounded or negatively charged) rotates at a high surface speed (over 1500 

rpm) to make the electrospun fibres align along the rotating axis. Although it generates

38 
 

fibres with good alignment, this technique does not offer control over the fibre 

placement or a high degree of alignment since the deposited fibres accumulate 

residual charge that will consequently interfere with the incoming ones [77,78,79].   

On the other hand, by using the gap method, the alignment of the electrospun 

fibres is achieved through the manipulation of the electric field. The manipulation is 

provoked by two parallel conductive electrodes spaced apart that direct the 

electrospinning jet across the gap as the electric field lines are attracted towards the 

electrodes. In addition to this, the presence of charges on the deposited fibres will 

originate mutual repulsion and consequently enhance the parallel and even 

distribution of the fibres. The main disadvantage of the gap method is the limitation in 

fibre placement, since the alignment only occurs between the two electrodes; in fact, 

if the distance that separates the electrodes is too big, the fibres will be deposited on 

the top of the electrodes and not across the gap [77,78,79].               

According to literature, the alignment of the electrospun fibres is particular 

relevant to the regeneration of skeletal muscle, ligaments, nerve and blood vessels. 

For example, Aviss et al.[80] have created a PLGA aligned electrospun scaffold able to 

provide contact guidance for C2C12 myoblast adhesion, elongation and differentiation. 

In a similar way, a PLLA aligned electrospun scaffold was able to provide better 

guidance and growth for both neurite and ganglia than random PLLA fibres [81]. A 

study developed by Xu et al. [82] has described a favourable interaction between an 

aligned poly(l-lactid-co-e-caprolactone) [P(LLA-CL)] with human coronary artery 

smooth muscle cells (SMCs). The results showed that the SMCs cultured on the aligned 

scaffolds had better adhesion and proliferation rate than the ones cultured on plane 

polymer films; in addition to this, the fibres alignment has influenced the cell migration 

and the orientation of the cytoskeleton proteins inside the cells, which were parallel to 

the direction of the nanofibre.   

Fibre diameter is other topographic feature of the electrospun fibres that can 

highly influence certain behaviors of cells such as adhesion, spreading, migration, 

proliferation and differentiation [51,83]. The investigation developed by Chen et al. 

[84] showed that the diameter of the PCL fibres affects the adhesion and proliferation 

of the NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line. Indeed, the cell adhesion and growth kinetics 

decreased as a function of increasing diameter when the average fibre diameter was in 

the nano range; on the other hand, when the fibre diameter was in the micro range, 

cell adhesion and kinetics showed no variation. These cell behaviors can be either due 

to the larger surface area-to-volume ratio in the scaffolds with a smaller fibre 

diameter, which leads consequently to a more efficient growth factors adsorption; or it 

can be because the cells need less force to migrate within and over the fibres with 

smaller diameter than the fibres which present a larger diameter.

3. Aim 

PolyActive is a well known FDA approved copolymer with adaptable surface 

energy and mechanical properties. Thus, it is commonly used as a biomaterial to create 

complex scaffolds for several tissue engineering applications and the upgrade of its 

abilities to mimic the natural extracellular matrix can be accomplished via the 

electrospinning process.  

In this way, the overall motivation of this project was to develop bioactive 

fibrous scaffolds able to provide selective guidance for cells via topographic and 

biochemical cues. The topographic cues were accomplished by using the gap method 

in a controlled environment, allowing the alignment and a controlled deposition of the 

fibres. For biochemical cues, two distinct surface modification techniques were 

investigated with the purpose of ensure the immobilization of specific biomolecules.  

In one approach, the influence of the UV irradiation in the appearance of new 

functional groups on the surface of both PA 300 and PA 1000 was studied. The purpose 

of this strategy was to induce the modification of the fibre surface chemistry with a 

spatially defined UV exposure, and consequently adjust the degree of biomolecule 

adsorption. 

In the second strategy, two different blend solution of PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA 

and PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne were electrospun with the intention of incorporate 

chemical groups on the surface of the fibres, respectively NHS-esters and alkynes, for 

further functionalization. The concept behind this innovative approach is that 

depending on the selected PEG linker, it will be possible to induce adsorption of 

different biomolecules without the need of a previous surface treatment (e.g. plasma 

or UV). In fact the success of this strategy can open the door for more simple and 

original methodologies to develop functionalized electrospun scaffolds.

4. Materials and methods 

The polymer used in this study was PolyActive (PA) copolymer (PolyVation BV, 

The Netherlands) with a composition of 300PEOT55PBT45 (PA 300) and 

1000PEOT70PBT30 (PA 1000), where 300 and 1000 are the molecular weight in g mol
-1 

of the starting poly(ethylene glycol) blocks used in the copolymerization, 55 and 70 are 

the weight ratios of the PEOT segment and the 45 and 30 are the weight ratios of the 

PBT block.     

4.1. Electrospinning 
4.1.1. PA 300 

For electrospinning, a 20% (w/v) solution of PA 300 was prepared in a mixture 

of chloroform (CHCl3) and 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) with an 80/20 % 

v/v. All these solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Before use, the solution 

was left to stir for a minimum period of 12 hours at room temperature. Then, a syringe 

containing the described solution was pumped at a controlled flow rate (1ml/hour) 

using a syringe pump (KDS 100, KD Scientific). Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing 

was used to connect the syringe tip (diameter = 0.8 mm) and the electrospinning 

nozzle to which a high voltage was applied (Gamma High Voltage Research Inc., FL, 

USA). The electrospun fibres were aligned on a glass coverslip (diameter = 14 mm) due 

the presence of two parallel electrodes that were able to modulate the electric field. 

The electrodes were aligned to the centre of the coverslip and spaced 1 cm from it.     

The PA 300 scaffolds were electrospun with a working distance (distance from 

the collector to the spinneret) of 20 cm and a voltage of 20 kV during 1 minute. The 

temperature during the spinning was 25?C and the humidity varied between 30% and 

35%.  

4.1.2. PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA 

The PA 300 and the (bis)PEG-SVA (SVA-PEG-SVA, MW 5 000, Laysan Bio Inc.) 

polymers were mixed together with a proportion of 4:1 in a 15% (w/v) solution. The 

solvents used were chloroform (CHCl3) and 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) 

with an 80/20 % v/v.  

The PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA scaffolds were electrospun with a working distance 

of 25 cm and a voltage of 25 kV during 1 minute. The temperature during the spinning 

was 25?C and the humidity varied between 30% and 35%. The electrospinning set up 

was similar to the one described in the previous section (4.1.1.).    

 



41 
 

4.1.3. PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne 

The PA 300 and the (bis)PEG-Alkyne (Alkyne-PEG-Alkyne, MW 5 000, Laysan Bio 

Inc.) polymers were mixed together with a proportion of 4:1 in a 15% (w/v) solution. 

The solvents used were chloroform (CHCl3) and 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol 

(HFIP) with an 80/20 % v/v.  

The PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne scaffolds were electrospun with a working 

distance of 25 cm and a voltage of 25 kV during 1 minute. The temperature during the 

spinning was 25?C and the humidity varied between 30% and 35%. The electrospinning 

set up was similar to the one described in the section 4.1.1.   

4.1.4. PA 1000 

The PA 1000 solution (15% (w/v)) was prepared in a mixture of chloroform 

(CHCl3) and 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) with an 80/20 % v/v. The 

solution was electrospun in the same set up described before (section 4.1.1.), with a 

working distance of 25 cm and a voltage of 25 kV during 1 minute. The temperature 

during the spinning was 25?C and the humidity varied between 30% and 35%.   

4.2. UV treatment 

PA 300 and PA 1000 electrospun scaffolds were treated with UV irradiation 

using an UV Crosslinker (UltraLum, model CEX-800) with a wavelength of 254 nm and 

energy of 1200 mJ. The samples were positioned at a 20 cm from the UV source and 

the treatment was performed for 5, 10, 20, 40, 90 or 180 minutes.   

An auxiliary pattern on the fibrous scaffold surface was produced by a nickel 

mask with outer dimensions of 2.5 cm X 2.5 cm. The mask was placed on the surface of 

the scaffold before UV exposure in order to selectively activate specific areas. Indeed, 

the irradiation only interacts with the surface through 140 rectangles (1.9 cm of high 

and 21.05 ?m of width) spaced by 103.76 ?m.        

4.3. Analysis techniques 
4.3.1. NMR 

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a technique based on the 

magnetic nuclear spin of isotopes (e.g. 
1
H and 

13
C) and it is commonly used to identify 

and analyze organic compounds. Basically, the sample is placed in a magnetic field and 

subjected to a radiofrequency radiation, which, depending on the frequency used, can 

be absorbed by the nuclei of the sample. This energy absorption promotes a transition 

between nuclear energy levels (spin flip) and it is highly influenced by the local 

electronic environment surrounding the nucleus, which can shield the nucleus from 



42 
 

the externally applied magnetic field (nuclear shielding) and therefore modify the 

difference between the energy levels. These differences in the electron distribution 

can be due the differences in bond lengths and angles, bonding different atoms or 

bond types, and they are relative to a standard reference: tetramethylsilane. The 

association between the resonance frequency of a nucleus and the standard signal is 

called chemical shift and it is measured in parts per million (ppm). The chemical shifts 

allow you to indentify different chemical environments that can be determined by 

Fourier transforming the NMR signal. The resultant spectrum shows the different 

chemical environments (x-axis is given in ppm) associated with a peak, which area is 

directly proportional to the number of nuclei in that chemical environment 

[85,86,87,88].       

The 
1
H NMR  spectra (Bruker Avance 400 MHz) of the PA 1000 and PA 300 

electrospun scaffolds (chapter 5) as well as the (bis)PEG-SVA and (bis)PEG-Alkyne 

(chapter 6)  were recorded using solutions of the indicated polymers in d-chloroform 

purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The analysis of the spectra was based on the chemical 

shifts tables from the Handbook of Basic Tables for Chemical Analysis [89].    

4.3.2. ATR-FTIR 

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a spectroscopy technique 

based on the interaction between the infrared radiation (IR) with a material, in which 

its molecular vibrations are analyzed. These vibrations are provoked by restricted 

radiation absorption since each molecule only absorbs the radiation at frequencies 

that match its unique fundamental modes of vibration. The peaks of the FTIR spectra 

are associated to the frequencies which radiation is absorbed and consequently to the 

specific chemical bonds and chemical functional groups present on the material [90]. 

Besides the identification of the functional groups, it is also possible to do a 

quantitatively analysis of the sample since the area of one IR peak is an indicator of the 

specific molecules concentration [91].     

As the main goal of the project is to functionalize the surfaces of electrospun 

scaffolds, a modality of FTIR was selected which is commonly used in surface or near-

surface composition characterization: Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform 

Infrared (ATR-FTIR). For analysis, the ATR-FTIR process involves a close contact 

between an internal reflection element (e.g. zinc selenide or germanium crystals) with 

the sample. As this crystal has a high refractive index, the IR beam is reflected 

internally and consequently creates an evanescence wave that penetrates in the 

immediate environment above the crystal. As a result of that, the sample absorbs 

some energy from the evanescent wave that becomes a signal that later gets 

converted by Fourier transform to a defined spectrum [90,92]. The main advantage of 

this technique is that it does not require sample preparation, so the PA 1000 and PA 



43 
 

300 (chapter 5) as well as the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA and PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne 

fibrous scaffolds (chapter 6) were analyzed immediately after the electrospinning 

process. The spectra were recorded (Bruker ALPHA FT-IR Spectrometer) at a resolution 

of 4 cm
-1

 and average of 64 scans.      

The qualitative analysis of the ATR-FTIR spectra (chapters 5 and 6) was made by 

using the tables from the Handbook of Basic Tables for Chemical Analysis [89]. 

Relatively to the quantitative analysis, the areas underneath the peaks were calculated 

using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft. Microsoft Excel. Redmond, Washington: Microsoft, 

2007. Computer Software.) by the trapezoidal rule [93]. In the chapter 5, the chemical 

changes due the UV irradiation were calculated relatively to the peak areas from the 

untreated scaffolds.   

4.3.3. XPS 

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is a highly surface specific technique 

able to provide qualitative and quantitative information on the atomic composition of 

a solid’s outer surface down to a depth of typically between 0.5 and 10 nm. It is a 

technique based on a photo-electronic effect: the sample is exposed to X-ray with the 

purpose of exciting the core-level electrons from the specific type of atoms/ions 

present on the surface. The energy of the emitted photoelectrons, which is specific for 

each element, is then analyzed by the electron spectrometer and the data displayed as 

a spectra of intensity versus electron energy. Besides elemental composition, the 

photoelectron peaks can also provide useful information about the quantification of 

the surface composition by calculating their areas [90,92].   

XPS was performed by Gerard Kip to determine the chemical composition of 

the scaffolds (Chapters 5 and 6) and also to calculate any change in the chemical 

composition due either UV irradiation (chapter 5) or addition of functionalized PEG 

linkers (chapter 6). The process was carried out on a Quantera SXM (scanning XPS 

microprobe, Ie 2.6 mA, power 24.8 W, working pressure ?2e-8 Torr, Physical 

Electronics). The measurements were carried out on electrospun scaffolds either after 

UV treatment (chapter 5) or after the electrospinning process (chapter 6), on four 

points per sample with monochromatic Al-K? radiation at 1486.6 eV. The main peak of 

C1s peak was set at 284.8 eV and Multipak v.9.0.0 was used for data reduction. 

4.4. Protein adsorption tests 

Albumin-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate from bovine (FITC-BSA, Sigma 

Aldrich) was used as model protein to evaluate the adsorption on UV treated and 

untreated surfaces of both PA 1000 and PA 300 electrospun scaffolds (chapter 5). FITC-

BSA was also used to test the adsorption properties of the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA 

scaffold (section 6.1.). The scaffolds were incubated in a FITC-BSA / phosphate 



44 
 

buffered saline (PBS) (10 ?g / 1 ml) solution at room temperature during 2 hours. After 

the incubation period, the samples were washed with PBS to remove any non-

adherent proteins. The further analysis was carried out via fluorescent microscope 

observations in a Fluorescence/Histology microscope (NIKON ECLIPSE E600).  

Some scaffolds were tested with the complex 1-Ethyl-3-(3-

dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide / N-Hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). Scaffolds were 

immersed in a NHS/EDC (200mM/100mM) PBS solution for 1h at room temperature 

before the incubation in a FITC-BSA / PBS solution. The EDC and the NHS were 

purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.  

4.5. Click Chemistry tests 

The click chemistry reaction between the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne electrospun 

scaffold and a model Azide (Azide MegaStokes dye 673, Sigma-Aldrich) was 

investigated in order to simulate the ability of the scaffold’s surface to adsorb azide 

modified biomolecules. The scaffolds were incubated in an Azide / phosphate buffered 

saline (PBS) (10 ?g / 1 ml) solution at room temperature during 2 hours. After the 

incubation period, the samples were washed with PBS to remove any non-adherent 

azide biomolecules. The further analysis was carried out via fluorescent microscope 

observations in a Microscope Fluorescence Nikon.  

4.6. Cell culture 

The in vitro experiments were performed with rat Schwann cells. Before the cell 

culture experiments, the electropun scaffolds (PA 300 and PA 1000 untreated and 

treated with UV) were placed on a non-treated well plate (NUNC) and soaked in 70% 

ethanol for 30 minutes in order to sterilize them. Then, the scaffolds were rinsed with 

PBS and incubated at 37 ?C in a humid atmosphere with 5% CO2 for 4h in a cell culture 

medium (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Meidium (DMEM) + 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) 

+ 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (pen-strep)) to allow protein adhesion from the medium. 

To ensure that the electrospun scaffolds would stay in place, rubber O-rings (Eriks BV, 

The Netherlands) were used to secure them.  

15 000 cells (in 200 ?l culture medium) were seeded on to each scaffold after 

removing the medium used for incubation. It was added more culture medium to a 

volume of 2 ml per well and the scaffolds were incubated for 12h. After the incubation 

period, the scaffolds were rinsed with PBS and fixed in 10% formalin for 20 min, upon 

removal of the medium. After that, the membranes of the cells were permeabilized in 

a 0.5% triton-X solution for 10 min between PBS washing steps. Then, to reduce the 

nonspecific background staining, the fixed cells were incubated in a PBS solution 

containing 1% of BSA for 25 minutes. Finally, the actin filaments of the cells were 



45 
 

stained with phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich) and their nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma-

Aldrich) for further fluorescent microscope observations in a fluorescence microscope 

(NIKON ECLIPSE E600).

5. Functionalization of PolyActive 

electrospun fibres by UV exposure 

The structural and functional properties of the surfaces of both PA 1000 and  

PA 300 electrospun scaffolds were modified via UV irradiation in order to improve 

protein adsorption and consequently to enhance cell adhesion.  

The chemical changes induced by UV irradiation proved to be dependent on the 

PEOT/PBT wt % and on the molecular weight of PEG. Indeed, after 40 minutes of UV 

exposure, the PA 1000 electrospun fibres showed a high content of carboxyl and 

hydroxyl groups on their surface. On the other hand, the higher weight percentage of 

PBT on the PA 300 fibres provoked the generation of benzoquinones on their surface 

after 40 minutes of UV treatment. The chemical characterization of the electrospun 

scaffolds was made via NMR and the analysis of the untreated and treated surfaces 

was performed by ATR-FTIR and XPS techniques.   

 The FITC-BSA was used as model protein to evaluate the protein adsorption on 

untreated and surface treated scaffolds, which showed a considerable enhance in 

protein immobilization comparing with the UV non-treated surfaces. In terms of cell 

response, the Rat Schwann Cells successfully attached to both untreated and treated 

surfaces of PA 1000 and PA 300 scaffolds. However, the larger number of cells 

attached on the UV treated surfaces indicated the presence of a superior quantity of 

functional groups able to immobilize adhesion proteins from the culture medium. It 

was also noticed that the specific chemical composition of PA 300 and PA 1000 

induced morphological differences in the cells. A spatially defined surface 

functionalization was also accomplished in both scaffolds by the use of a UV mask that 

allowed a preferential protein adsorption on the activated areas. As a consequence of 

the spatial definition of protein adsorption, the cell attachment occurred mostly on the 

sites of the electrospun scaffolds that were exposed to UV irradiation.        

5.1. Scaffolds characterization 

The ATR-FTIR spectrum of PA 1000 samples displayed approximately the same 

characteristic bands as PA 300 (Figure 11); these results are not surprising since the 

only differences between the two polymers are the percentages of the PEOT and PBT 

segments as well as the initial PEG molecular weight.

 The FTIR spectrum of PA 1000 fibres shows a more intense absorbance in the C-

H stretch region (2840 – 3000 cm
-1

) than the PA 300. This is due the higher PEO 

content and the longer chains present in the PA 1000. On the other hand, the PA 300 

confirms the tendency to be more crystalline then PA 1000 because of the higher 

absorbance in the aromatic C-H out of plane bending region (715 – 735 cm
-1

).  

 In both cases there are bands at 1102 cm
-1

, 1270 cm
-1

 and 1714 cm
-1

, that are 

related with the C-O-C stretch of the ether and with the C-O and C=O stretches of the 

ester, respectively.  

 The comparison between the 
1
H-NMR spectra of the two polymers showed a 

similar chemical composition, only with slightly differences because of the dissimilarity 

in the PEOT/PBT contents. In fact, the higher hydrophilicity of the PA 1000 fibres 

compared to the PA 300 is illustrated in the Figure 12 as well as the differences in the 

PBT content. These two features are showed by the peaks at 1.56 ppm (higher in the 

PA 1000 spectrum) and 8.15 ppm (higher in the PA 300 spectrum), which are related to 

the water content in the sample (impurity) and with the hydrogen linked to the 

aromatic ring respectively.      

The other peaks present in both spectra are associated with the CH2 located on 

the PEO backbone chain (3.70 ppm), the connection between the ethylene oxide 

residues connected to the terephthalate unit (3.90 ppm) and with the CH2 positioned 

in the butanediol component of the PBT (2.00 and 4.45 ppm). The 
1
H-NMR results 

reported here corroborate the results accomplished by Deschamps et al. [18].      

One of the reasons why the peaks 2, 3, 4 and 5 are smaller in the PA 1000 

spectrum could be because of the hydrolysis process induced by the high water 

content in this scaffold. The water molecules presented in the PA 1000 fibres could 

have been absorbed from the atmosphere during the electrospinning process due the 

hydrophilicity properties of this polymer.        

Figure 11. ATR-FTIR spectra of PA 1000 (blue) and PA 300 (red).

The effect of the UV treatment on the surface of the PA 1000 and PA 300 fibres 

is resumed in the figures 10 and 11, that describe the time evolution of the surfaces 

chemistry composition during UV exposure. The changes are result of the degradation 

processes (both hydrolysis and oxidation) that provoke the rearrangement of the 

molecular structure and the formation of a new region between 3100 and 3700 cm
-1

. 

This new region is related to the O-H stretch and it indicates the formation of the new 

products that are originated during the several stages of the oxidation process (Figure 

13).   

The UV irradiation of the PA 1000 fibres leads to important modifications in the 

FTIR spectrum. In fact, during the first 10 minutes of exposure there is an increase in 

the absorbance bands of the C=O, C-O and C-O-C stretches and at the 715 – 735 cm
-1

 

region, which is due to the aromatic C-H out of plane bends. At the same time, a 

decrease in the C-H stretch peak and the O-H stretch region is noted. This data can be 

associated to the consumption of OH and H of the polymer chain for the production of 

both esters and formates (see Figure 4). The increasing in the 715 – 735 cm
-1

 region is 

not related to the aromatic part, but instead to the C-H rocking of the oxidation 

products.   

After this initial irradiation period, the increase of temperature in the system 

leads to the formation of the alcohols and the degradation of the PBT starts. Indeed, as 

the photo-oxidation starts in the amorphous phase because of the easy oxygen 

diffusion [23], it is plausible that the formation of mono and di-hydroxy-substituted 

compounds starts later then the formate and ester production. The decrease in the 

other absorbance bands is because of scission chain events originated by both 

oxidation and hydrolysis (H2O is also formed during the formates production); The 

Figure 13 also shows the rise of a shoulder at 1185 cm
-1

 (C-C-O stretch), which is 

related to the continuous production of formates [23].

49 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A similar analysis can be made for the PA 300 scaffold, and as expected the high 

PBT content in the fibres has a critical influence in the polymer degradation. Like it was 

illustrated in the PA 1000, the formation of esters and formates occurs in the first 10 

minutes of UV irradiation with an increase in the C-O-C, C-O and C=O stretches and in 

the C-H rocking absorbance region. The Figure 14 also shows the decrease in the C-H 

stretch of the backbone chain related to the hydrogen abstraction reactions involved 

in the PEO segment photo-oxidation. Subsequent to this initial period, comes the 

decrease of these absorbance bands because of chain scission events. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 The degradation of the PBT segment is mainly related with the changes in the 

O-H peak during UV exposure and with the decrease in the 715 – 735 cm
-1

 region

(degradation of the aromatic ring). Contrary to the other absorbance bands, the 

behavior of the O-H region in the PA 300 scaffold isn’t similar to the PA 1000 fibres: 

through the first 5 minutes there is a slight decrease in the O-H peak related to the 

production of formates and esters, followed by a boost until 20 minutes of exposure 

time. At this point there is a further decrease until the 40 minutes of UV exposure, 

when the O-H peak starts to increase again. Finally, during the next 50 minutes of UV 

irradiation the O-H absorbance region reaches is maximum intensity and then 

decreases until the end of the treatment.         

The behavior of the O-H absorbance region in the PA 300 is mainly because of 

the high amount of mono and di-hydroxy-substituted compounds, formed during the 

PBT segment degradation, which are also susceptible to interact with the UV light and 

consequently originate a new chain of reactions. One possibility pathway is based on 

the photo-degradation of phenol under UV irradiation (Figure 15) [94,95]. As 

schematized in Figure 15, a hydroquinone can originate a P-benzonquinone by a 

reversible redox reaction, which is plausible because of the yellowing of the scaffold 

during UV exposure. Further irradiation leads to ring cleavage and formation of low 

mass compounds such as carboxylic acids (acetic acids, etc) and finally CO2 [95,96].           

 

 

 

 

   

The differences between the two scaffolds can be further analyzed by 

comparing the areas underneath each absorbance peak. In this way, it will be possible 

evaluate the relative changes that occur on the PA 1000 and PA 300 surfaces 

composition during UV exposure. 

As described above, the peak area between 715 cm
-1

 and 735 cm
-1

 is related  

not only with the C-H out of plane bending region, but also with the C-H rocking of the 

main chain. The higher crystallinity of the PA 300 is the reason why the peak area is 

bigger in this polymer compared with PA 1000. However, as the long PEO chain of the 

PA 1000 is able to produce more formates and esters than the small PEO segment in 

the PA 300, PA 1000 will show a superior gain in the peak area during the first 10 

minutes of UV irradiation. The following peak area decreasing is related with scission 

chain events and aromatic ring degradation. The results are summarized in Table 2 and 

Figure 16.

 The PA 1000 and PA 300 C-O-C stretches show similar peak areas before UV 

irradiation because of the high PEO content in one case and the repetition of the PBT 

chains in other. In a similar way as the C-H aromatic, the formation of formates and 

esters in the first 10 minutes occurs in both polymers, resulting in an increasing of the 

peak area. Again, the area increasing is more noticeable in the PA 1000 and the 

decreasing in both scaffolds is due to the effect of oxidation and hydrolysis (Table 3 

and Figure 17).

 The analysis of the Tables 4 and 5 and the Figures 18 and 19 confirm a higher 

concentration of C=O and C-O stretches in the PA 300 scaffold because of its PBT 

content. However, during the UV irradiation, the formation of esters and formates 

occurs and the gain in the peak area of these elements becomes superior in the PA 

1000. The reason for that is the molecular structure of the PEO’s oxidation products, 

which are formed in larger amounts in PA 1000 than in PA 300. Again, the peak areas 

decrease after the initial 10 minutes of UV irradiation.

54 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 The analysis of the C-H stretch related with the backbone chain of the polymers 

(Table 6 and Figure 20) shows a higher peak area in the PA 1000 before starting the UV 

treatment. This is because the large PEO chains that characterizes the molecular 

structure of these fibres. As the hydrogens presented in the main chains of both PA 

1000 and PA 300 are deeply involved in the hydrogen abstraction reactions during UV 

degradation, the peak area in this region starts decreasing from the beginning of the 

process.        

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Contrary to the other regions of interest, the temporal evolution under UV 

irradiation of the O-H stretch is not similar for PA 1000 and PA 300. In fact, the relative 

gains and losses of this peak area in the PA 1000 are mainly related with the formation 

of alcohols and carboxylic acids. As it was explained above, the photo degradation of 

the PEO segments is the most dominant degradation process in PA 1000. In this way, 

the consumption of OH during the first minutes of UV irradiation leads to the 

formation of PEO oxidation products; these products (Figure 4) originate the following 

Figure 19. FTIR spectra of the C-O zone after various UV exposure times. A) PA 1000 ; B) PA 300. 

Table 6. Relative Changes in the C-H peak area for PA1000 (blue) and PA 300 (red) during UV exposure.

boost in the peak area (Table 7 and Figure 21). Although the PBT degradation also 

occurs in the PA 1000, it has little influence in the ATR-FTIR spectra because of its 

modest amount in comparison with the PEO present in the PEOT segment.               

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 On the other hand, the relative changes in the O-H peak area of the PA 300 are 

related with the photo-oxidation of PBT and with the low PEO content on this polymer. 

The formation of PEO oxidation products has a diminutive impact in the OH peak area 

evolution; nevertheless it is possible that this process contributes for the small loss in 

the absorbance region during the first 5 minutes of UV irradiation. Besides that, the 

first increasing of the peak area can be due to the formation of the mono and di-

hydroxy-substituted compounds in the aromatic ring. Following the scheme in the 

Figure 7 it is possible that the formation of intermediate compounds like 

benzoquinones leads to the decreasing between the 20 and 40 minutes of UV 

exposure; the further degradation of the PA 300 scaffold can originate both 

substituted phenols and low mass products such as carboxylic acids, leading to a new 

peak area increasing during the next 50 minutes. Then, the absorbance band decreases 

again because of the collapse of the aromatic ring and the degradation of the low mass 

compounds. These results are summarized in Table 7 and Figure 21.         

 The analysis of the Table 7 also shows that the low molecular weight polymer 

(PA 300) presents a higher concentration of hydroxyl groups (OH) before UV exposure. 

This property is related to the chain folding of the PEO segment and it is correlated by 

Bigger et al. [97].

 The spectra presented in Figure 22 and 23 resume the relative changes in the 

peak areas during UV irradiation and for both PA 1000 and PA 300. As explained above, 

the different time evolutions of both polymers under UV exposure are related to their 

molecular structure and consequently with the competition between the production of 

lower molecular weight species and polymer chain/aromatic ring scission events that 

occur on their surface.  In fact, the relative changes in the peak areas illustrate 

modifications on surface properties such as wettability and presence of functional 

groups that can largely influence the accessible surface area for protein binding.   

Based on this, it is possible to say that the surfaces of both PA 1000 and PA 300 

are able to offer a considerable number of scenarios to investigate protein adsorption 

and cell attachment, depending on the UV exposure time. Two scenarios were chosen 

for both polymers: untreated and 40 minutes of UV exposure. In the case of PA 1000, 

the UV irradiation will introduce reactive hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface, 

improving the adhesion of proteins because of the hydrogen bond forming capability 

of these chemical groups [98,99]; on the other hand, the benzoquinones present on 

Table 7. Relative Changes in the O-H peak area for PA1000 (blue) and PA 300 (red) during UV exposure.

the surface of PA 300 after 40 minutes of UV exposure will act as crosslinkers for 

proteins (equations 6, 7 and 8) [100,101,102].

 The changes on the surface of each scenario were also monitored by XPS. The 

elemental compositions of PA 1000 and PA 300 before and after UV irradiation are 

presented in the Tables 8 and 9 respectively. It can be noted that the carbon and 

oxygen are the dominant species on both PA 1000 and PA 300 surfaces, however it is 

also observed some impurities like nitrogen on both PA 300 and PA 1000 and 

additional elements like potassium and silicon on the PA 1000 surface. These 

impurities are due to sample storage and handling during processing and UV 

treatment.      

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 The results in Table 8 show an increase in the oxygen/carbon ratio after UV 

irradiation provoked by the increase of hydroxyl and carboxyl functionalities and the 

chain scission events described before. In contrast, the Table 9 shows a decrease in the 

ratio O/C due the high OH content on the surface of untreated PA 300 and the 

Table 8. PA 1000 elemental composition before and after 40 minutes of UV irradiation.  

Table 9. PA 300 elemental composition before and after 40 minutes of UV irradiation. 



59 
 

presence of the native oxide layer before UV treatment, the further formation of 

benzoquinones after 40 minutes of UV irradiation can also influence the lower amount 

of oxygen. The increasing of carbon after UV exposure on the PA 300 surface can be 

due the high probability of recombination caused by the strong attachment of chains 

in crystalline regions [103].     

 The C1s region analyses are presented in the Tables 10 and 11 for PA1000 and 

PA 300, respectively.   

 For both polymers, the C1s analysis of the untreated scaffolds showed four 

different peaks (Figures 24 and 25). The peak at 284.8 eV is attributed to C-H aromatic 

bonds and to the aliphatic carbon (C-C-C) bonds; the second and third peaks (286.2 eV 

and 287.3 eV) are associated with the C-C-O and C-C=O from the ether and ester 

groups, correspondingly. A four peak is located at 288.9 eV and it is related with the O-

C=O bond, also from the ester group. These results are comparable with the results of 

Riekerink et al. [104] and Nandakumar et al. [98]. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 The changes in the C1s peaks after 40 minutes of UV irradiation (Figure 24 B 

and 25 B) are deeply related with the competition between scission chain events and 

formation of new products.  

On the PA 1000 surface, the fracture of the polymer backbone chain is 

associated to the decreasing at 284.8 eV and the formation of esters, formates and 

carboxylic acids is the origin of the boost in the 288.9 eV after UV exposure. The 

apparent no effect of the UV treatment at 286.2 eV and 287.3 eV can be related to the 

formation of alcohols and other PEO photo-oxidation products (esters, formates and 

carboxylic acids) that balance respectively with the degradation of the originals ethers 

and esters.  

Table 10. Fractions of various functional groups from PA 1000 C1s peaks. 

Table 11. Fractions of various functional groups from PA 300 C1s peaks. 



60 
 

A different behavior is observed on the PA 300 surface, where the PEO 

degradation is balanced with the high amount of aromatic structures and the ability of 

chains recombination, resulting in the preservation of the peak area at 284.8 eV. 

According to Solomon et al [105], the Cs1 peaks of C=O of benzoquinones and C-OH of 

phenols are located at 286.2 eV and 287.3 eV respectively. This means that the 

production of benzoquinones can be related with the no apparent effect of UV 

irradiation at 286.2 eV, despite the ether degradation; the same reasoning can be 

applied at 287.3 eV, where the UV irradiation seems to have no effect on the peak 

area. In this case the formation of the mono and di-hydroxy-substituted compounds 

during PBT photo-oxidation opposes to the degradation of the original esters. The 

boost in the last peak (288.9 eV) can be related to the oxidation products originated 

from the PEOT degradation and to the formation of carboxylic acids from 

benzoquinone degradation.

5.2 Protein adsorption tests 

The protein adsorption on the PA 1000 and PA 300 surfaces is directly 

dependent to the chemical and structural surface changes reported in the previous 

section. In fact, the molecular rearrangements on the surfaces due the UV irradiation 

can lead to substantial modifications in the amount, type and conformation of the 

adsorbed proteins.  

Papenburg et al. [106] have suggested that the swelling ability and the two 

phase separation of untreated PEOT/PBT copolymers are significant in the protein 

adsorption process. The swelling ability opens the possibility for additional protein 

adsorption within the polymer sheet; on the other hand, the singular characteristics of 

each phase can lead to the adsorption of different kinds of proteins that express 

affinity to either of the phases. So, these and other properties of the material such as 

wettability, roughness, topography and the functional groups located on the surface 

are able to influence the protein adsorption and consequently the cell attachment via 

these proteins. 

The ability of untreated and UV treated PA 1000 and PA 300 scaffolds adsorb 

the proteins of the serum-enriched medium was tested using FITC-BSA as a model 

protein. Besides the four initial scenarios (PA 1000; PA 1000 + UV; PA 300 and PA 300 + 

UV), it is possible create a fifth scenario for the protein adsorption test by adding the 1-

ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride / N-Hydroxysuccinimide 

(EDC/NHS) complex to a UV treated scaffold.  

In fact, the carboxylic acids present on the surface of both polymers after UV 

irradiation can be converted to active intermediates (o-acylisourea) by EDC; these 

reactive complexes react relatively slowly with amines, so they can be hydrolyzed in 

aqueous solutions before the coupling occurs. Because of that, NHS can be added to 

react with the active intermediate and form a stable amine-reactive NHS ester that will 

be nucleophilically attacked by the protein to form an amide bond, leading to covalent 

linkage to the polymer’s surface (Figure 26) [107,108]. 

Theoretically the carboxylic acids should be mainly produced during PA 1000 

degradation because of its large amount of PEO, however, the ATR-FTIR and XPS have 

showed that there is also a substantial amount of carboxylic acids on the surface of PA 

300 after 40 minutes of UV irradiation.  In this way, both possibilities (PA 1000 + UV 

and PA 300 + UV) were explored with the adding of the NHS/EDC complex. Relative to 

the untreated samples of PA 300 (Figure 27) and PA 1000 (Figure 28), there is no 

detectable fluorescence before or after incubation in a FITC-BSA / PBS solution. This 

information excludes respectively auto-fluorescence and protein absorption 

interference in the fluorescence microscope images.      



62 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 On the other hand, after 40 minutes of UV irradiation, the fibres of both 

electrospun scaffolds show fluorescence in the blue channel. This fact can be related 

with the degradation of superficial chromophores and with the photo / thermo 

oxidation of the PBT segment. The effect of the UV exposure on the surface of PA 1000 

and PA 300 can also be proved by the detection of fluorescence proteins after 

incubation in a FITC-BSA / PBS solution.    

 According to the Figures 29 and 30, the addition of the EDC/NHS complex 

seems to produce no visible difference in the protein adsorption process. This means 

that the modifications that occur on the surface of the PA 1000 and PA 300 fibres 

during UV irradiation are sufficient to expand the availability of the surface areas to 

protein adsorption. It is also true that the process of functionalization became simpler 

without the introduction of this complex.      

 In order to have a better control on the spatial distribution of the functional 

groups on the surface of the fibres, we used a mask (linear patterning) between the 

surface and the UV light source before the FITC-BSA / PBS incubation period. As 

expected, the results show activate areas (green) regularly separated by non active 

areas. The results are illustrated in the Figure 31.

5.3. Cell response 

Adhesion is a cell type dependant process that involves a complex network of 

sequential events including attachment, spreading and growth, followed by other 

process like cell differentiation, migration and production of extra-cellular matrix 

(ECM) molecules [109,110]. This chain of physical interactions, chemical binding and 

biological signaling processes is highly influenced by the polymeric surface properties. 

 In fact, Arima et al. [111] have separated the cell-polymeric substrate 

interactions into four phases: adsorption of proteins from the medium to the surface, 

approach of cells to the surface, cell attachment and cell spreading.  As explained 

before, the functional groups present on the surface of both PA 1000 and PA 300 

determine the amount and the rate of the protein adsorption from the culture 

medium.  

 Initially, the cells approach the surface due to electrostatic, van der Waals and 

steric forces and also because of the gravity since the cells are denser than the culture 

medium.  The more specific interactions that include the interaction between the 

transbembrane linking protein integrin and the proteins located on the polymer 

surface will then control the cell attachment. Adding to the proteins primarily

/ Mask) + BSA (bottom).

adsorbed from the culture medium, the cells themselves can start to secrete binding 

proteins such as fibronectin and collagen that will be also adsorb by the surface of the 

polymers, contributing to the cell adhesion process [110,111]. The fibronectin 

produced by the cells has a very important role in supporting the cell spreading 

[111,112]. 

 The influence of the changes provoked by UV irradiation on the surfaces of 

both PA 1000 and PA 300 in the cell attachment process was tested with Rat Swann 

Cells, which are glial cells of the peripheral nervous system usually used for nerve 

tissue regeneration applications [113,114]. In culture, this cell line can show either a 

flat morphology or a spindle-shaped morphology with an oval nucleus and long 

process [115]. In fact, the results (Figures 32 - 37) show these two types of morphology 

in untreated and UV treated scaffolds; however it seems that the flattened pattern is 

more dominant in the PA 1000 samples.  

 The UV irradiated samples show a larger number of cells than the untreated 

scaffolds. This can be related to the increasing in the number of functional groups 

available after UV exposure, which consequently leads to an increase in the protein 

adsorption from the culture medium. This fact is also proved when the PA 1000 and PA 

300 are patterned by the UV mask because the attachment of the Rat Schwann Cells 

occurs mostly on the UV activated areas.

67 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 The examination of the areas 1 and 2 corresponding to PA 1000 untreated and 

UV treated respectively shows no obvious differences in the cells morphology. In both 

cases, the cells show a predominant flat shape with several extensions. A similar 

analysis can be made by observing the areas 3 (untreated PA 300) and 4 (UV treated 

PA 300), since it is also possible to see no considerable change of cell morphology in 

both conditions: bipolar and tri-polar extensions with spindle shaped morphology.  

 Similarly to other studies [113,116], the aligned fibres of the electrospun 

scaffolds work as guidance cues for the Rat Schwann cells grow. In fact, it is possible 

that the aligned nanofibres influence the organization of the Rat Schwann Cells into 

columns called bands of Büngner during the proliferation stage [116]. Although it is 

unlikely to Rat Schwann Cells proliferation takes place during the culture period used 

in this experiment (12h), it is possible to see cell columns in both PA 1000 (Figure 28 B) 

and PA 300 (Figure 31, zone 4) after UV irradiation.

 The more circular shape of the Rat Schwann Cells cultured on the PA 1000 

scaffolds could be an outcome of a weaker fibre alignment [81] that difficult the cell 

elongation parallel to the fibres. On the other hand, the PA 300 fibres strong alignment 

is reflected in the narrow morphology presented by the Rat Schwann Cells [81].

6. Electrospinning PA fibres with 

functional groups 

Although the mechanical and chemical properties of the PA 300 already show 

good levels of biocompatibility and biodegradability, they do not allow a selective 

adsorption process able to permit the immobilization of specific biomolecules on the 

surface. In order to accomplish that, blend solutions of PA 300 and functionalized PEG 

linkers were electrospun in order to place chemical groups on the surface of the fibres 

for further functionalization without the need of surface modification techniques like 

Plasma treatment or UV irradiation. The success of this concept can instigate new 

scaffold design methodologies for tissue engineering applications at same time that is 

able to originate innovative strategies for control cell behaviour (attachment, 

proliferation and differentiation) and migration. 

6.1. PolyActive + (bis)PEG-SVA electrospun 

fibres 

A blend solution of PA 300 and (bis)PEG-SVA was successfully electrospun with 

the purpose of placing NHS-esters on the surface of the fibres to promote protein 

adhesion. The presence of the functional groups on the surface of the PA 300 + 

(bis)PEG-SVA scaffold  was confirmed via ATR-FTIR and XPS spectroscopy and the 

scaffold ability to immobilize proteins was investigated by using FTIC-BSA as a model 

protein. The chemical composition of the (bis)PEG-SVA was also investigated via NMR 

analysis.  

6.1.1. (bis)PEG-SVA/Amine reaction 

The Succinimidyl valerate poly(ethylene glicol) succinimidyl valerate (SVA-PEG-

SVA or (bis)PEG-SVA) is an amino (-NH2)  homobifunctional reactive PEG derivate that 

can be used for the PEGylation of substances with  available amino groups such as 

proteins (Figure 38). 

 

 

 

 

Figure 38. Molecular structure of (bis)PEG-SVA. 



70 
 

 Indeed, due the presence of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters on SVA-PEG-

SVA molecular structure allows a nucleopholic attack and consequently the formation 

of stable amide linkage with NHS loss (Figure 39). This reaction competes with the 

hydrolysis of the NHS esters and because of that it should occur near physiological 

conditions (pH between 7 and 8.5) [107,117].  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The selectivity of PEG-NHS polymers towards primary amine terminals is 

commonly used in drug delivery applications because the attachment of PEG to 

therapeutic proteins leads to an increase in drug efficiency by reducing 

immunogenicity and enzymatic digestion, at same time that also induces an increasing 

in solubility and in the serum half life. In fact, several PEGylated protein conjugates 

were already FDA approved and are commercially available [118,119]. In addition to 

this, the PEG-NHS / PEG SVA polymers can be also employed in the incorporation of 

adhesion peptides or proteins on the scaffolds surfaces in order to modulate cell-

surface interaction. Some tissue engineering applications include surface gradients 

[120], generation of protein adherent and non adherent areas [121,122], construction 

of hydrogel scaffolds [123] and nanoparticles surface customization [124]. Another 

example was reported by Delong et al. [125] that build a system able to immobilize 

basic fibroblast growth factor to hydrogel scaffolds via acryloyl-PEG-NHS in order to 

study protein gradient effects on vascular smooth muscle cell behavior and direct their 

migration. 

The chemical composition of the (bis)PEG-SVA described above was confirmed 

by the 
1
H-NMR spectrum of (bis)PEG-SVA (Figure 40). The peak related to the C-H bond 

of the PEG backbone chain (3.70 ppm) is clearly the most intense because of its huge 

proportion in the molecular structure relatively to the NHS ester. The tiny peaks at 

2.90 ppm, 2.70 ppm and 1.8 ppm are associated with the CH2 in the ? position, with 

the CH2 present on the NHS and with the C-H bond in the ? position, respectively.   

Figure 39. Reaction of (bis)PEG-SVA with amines on proteins.

6.1.2. Scaffold characterization 

The ATR-FTIR spectra of the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA (Figure 41) shows a 

dominance of the PEOT/PBT components over the functional PEG. This situation is not 

completely unexpected since the proportion of this components is 4 times higher than 

the (bis)PEG-SVA component.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There is a intense absorbance peak in the C-H stretch region associated with 

the Backbone chain of PEO (2840 – 3000 cm
-1

), it is also possible to see the ether C-O-C 

stretch band at 1102 cm-
1
 and the ester C-O and C=O absorbance peaks at 1270 cm

-1

2- CH2 (? position); 3 – CH2 (NHS); 4 – CH2 (? position). The solvent peak for CDCl3 
is located at 7.25 ppm.

and 1714 cm
-1

, respectively. The aromatic C-H out of plane region is located between 

715 – 735 cm
-1

 and the O-H region (3100 and 3700 cm
-1

) is nearly negligible.  

Indeed, the spectrum of PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA is almost similar to the 

spectrum of PA 300 showed before (section 5.1.): both spectra present the same 

absorbance bands, with their only difference being the peak areas (Figures 42 – 44 and 

Table 12). In fact, the addition of (bis)PEG-SVA before the electrospinning process 

cause the increasing of the polymer backbone chain and consequently a boost in the C-

O-C, C-O and C-H (main chain) regions. The PEG content is also responsible for the high 

water absorption during the electrspinning and consequently for the increasing of the 

O-H region. As expected, there is no significant change in the aromatic C-H region.   

Theoretically, the NHS terminals should present three characteristic bands at 

17019 cm
-1

, 1745 cm
-1

 and 1818 cm
-1

 related respectively with the symmetric and 

asymmetric C=O stretches of NHS and with the carbonyl stretch of the NHS ester 

[126,127]. Although since none of these peaks are identified individually, it is possible 

that the increasing of the C=O peak area is due the presence of NHS-esters on the 

surface of the fibres.

 The elemental composition of the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA surface by XPS 

confirmed the ATR-FTIR analysis (Table 13). So, the carbon and oxygen are the 

dominate species on the scaffold’s surface and there is a vestigial trace of nitrogen. 

These results make sense because it was not expectable to see a huge percentage of 

nitrogen on the surface due the proportion between PA 300 and (bis)PEG-SVA used; 

however the presence of the (bis)PEG-SVA is reflected in the higher amount of carbon 

and nitrogen on the surface comparing with PA 300 (Table 9).

74 
 

 The C1s analysis of the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA fibres (Table 14 and Figure 45) 

show the same four peaks as both PA 1000 and PA 300: the first peak is located at 

284.8 eV (C-H aromatic and aliphatic carbon C-C-C bonds), the second peak at 286.2 eV 

(C-C-O ether bond), the third peak at 287.3 eV (C-C=O ester bond) and finally, the last 

peak located at 288.9 eV (O-C=O ester bond). The comparison with PA 300 (Table 9 
and Figure 24 A) reveals a huge increment in the peak area associated with the C-C-O 

ether bond, which is explained by the higher amount of PEG in the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-

SVA scaffold; and in addition to this, it is also possible associate this peak with the C-N 

bond [122].      

 Furthermore, it was also made an N1s analysis to both PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA 

and PA 300 in order to compare their functional groups and identify the NHS-ester 

terminals on the surface of the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA fibres. The results (Table 15) 

show a common peak at 399.2 eV, which can be associated to nitrogen contamination. 

On the other hand it is possible to observe a second peak at 401.5 eV that only exist in 

the PA 300 + PEG-SVA scaffold, indicating the presence of the NHS-esters [128] on the 

surface of the fibres.

6.1.3. Protein adsorption 

As explained previously (section 5.2), the protein adsorption success is highly 

dependent on the surface characteristics, so the changes promoted by the adding of 

(bis)PEG-SVA to PA 300 should increase substantially the ability of the electrospun 

fibres adsorb the proteins.  

In addition to the ATR-FTIR and XPS results that already have showed the 

presence of NHS-esters on the surface of the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA fibres, the scaffold 

was also tested using FITC-BSA as a model protein to simulate the adsorption of the 

serum-enriched medium before cell seeding.  

The results presented in Figure 46 confirm that only the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA 

after incubation in a FITC-BSA / PBS solution was able to show detectable fluorescence. 

This means that the functional groups are indeed present on the surface of scaffold, 

contributing to protein adsorption. Similarly to the PA 300 fluorescence microscope 

images showed in section 5.2, the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA didn’t show any auto-

fluorescence.

6.2. PolyActive + (bis)PEG-Alkyne electrospun 

fibres 

A blend solution of PA 300 and (bis)PEG-Alkyne was successfully electrospun 

with the purpose of placing terminal alkynes on the surface of the fibres to promote 

click chemistry reactions with azide functionalized biomolecules. Although the 

presence of alkynes was not totally confirmed via ATR-FTIR and XPS spectroscopy, the 

PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne scaffold was able to successfully immobilize an azide dye and 

consequently prove the existence of alkyne functional groups on the surface of the 

fibres. The chemical composition of the (bis)PEG-Alkyne was investigated via NMR 

analysis. 

6.2.1. (bis)PEG-Alkyne/Azide reaction 

The reaction between an azide and an alkyne terminals of the (bis)PEG-Alkyne 

is one example of the click chemistry cycloaddition reactions, that are included in a 

larger group of chemical processes denominated Click Chemistry. The concept behind 

Click Chemistry is mainly related with the creation of substances by exploring simple 

reactions that are efficient at link two components under simple reaction conditions 

and fast reaction times [129,130].   

The most popular cycloaddition reaction is referred as the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar 

cycloaddition reaction, which can occur through either of two alternative pathways 

described in Figure 47 in order to produce 1,2,3-triazoles. The more classical approach 

is purely thermal and produce both 1,4- and 1,5-regioisomers in a ratio 1:1, however 

because of the elevated temperatures and long reaction time required it is not very 

practical. So, Sharpless et al. [131]  have described a variant of the original process to 

accelerate the cycloaddition reaction by using Cu(I) as catalyst. In fact, the addition of 

Cu(I) dramatically accelerates the kinetics of the reaction and allows it to be almost 

solvent insensitive and occur under ambient pressures and room temperature. As it is 

possible to see in the Figure 47, the Cu(I) catalyzed variation of the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar 

cycloaddition of azides and alkynes improves the regioselectivity to generate only the 

1,4-regioisomer [107,129,130,132].  

 The simplicity of the click chemistry reactions has led to its application in tissue 

engineering strategies and materials science, mainly with the conjugation of polymers 

with biological entities such as peptides, proteins, viruses and cells [129]. In this way, 

the molecular structure of the (bis)PEG-Alkyne (Figure 48) transform this polymer into 

a suitable candidate for many applications of the azide-alkyne click approach, such as 

synthesis of hydrogels [133] and polymer surface functionalization [134,135].  

 



77 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 The chemical composition of the (bis)PEG-Alkyne was evaluated by a H-NMR 

analysis (Figure 49). The more intense peak is located at 3.70 ppm and it is related with 

the dominant presence of the PEG backbone chain (CH2) at the molecular structure. 

The peaks at 1.90 ppm and 2.4 ppm are related respectively with the alkyne proton 

and with CH2 adjacent to the triple bond carbon. Finally, the peak located at 4.2 ppm is 

probably related with the methylene protons of 4-pentynoic acid that is used during 

the Alkyne-PEG-Alkyne synthesis [136].

peak for CDCl3 is located at 7.25 ppm. 



78 
 

6.2.2. Scaffold characterization 

The PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA ATR-FTIR spectrum (Figure 50) presents the same 

peaks as the PA 300 by itself (section 5.1.): the region between 2840 cm
-1

 and 3000  

cm
-1

 is dominated by the C-H stretch from the Backbone chain of PEO, the ether C-O-C 

stretch band is located at 1102 cm
-1

, the ester stretches C-O and C=O are situated 

respectively at 1270 cm
-1

 and 1714 cm
-1

, the area between 715 cm
-1

  and 735 cm
-1

 is 

related with the aromatic C-H out of plane region and the O-H region (3100 and 3700 

cm
-1

) is not significant. Indeed, the spectrum show a clearly dominance of the 

PEOT/PBT components that together with the PEG chain from the (bis)PEG-SVA 

suppress the characteristic bands of the Alkyne terminals. Theoretically these 

characteristic bands should be the C?C-H bend (610 - 700 cm
-1

), the C?C stretch (2100-

2260 cm
-1

) and the C?C-H stretch (3270-3330 cm
-1

). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 The comparison between the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne and the PA 300 scaffold 

has showed, as expected, some changes on the peak areas but not in the absorbance 

bands locations. It is possible to see from the Figures 51-53 and from the analysis of 
the Table 16, that the influence of the PEG during the scaffold fabrication is reflected 

in the increasing of the polymer backbone and therefore in the associated areas (C-O-

C, C-O and C-H (main chain) regions). Similarly to what was explained for the PA 300 + 

(bis)PEG-SVA scaffold, the addition of PEG-Alkyne before the electrospinning process 

brings consequences for the hydrophilic properties of the fibres, that are then able to 

absorb more water than the PA 300 by itself. Then as consequence of the increase in 

the water absorption levels in the PA 300 + PEG-Alkyne scaffold, there is an increase in 

the O-H region comparing with the PA 300 scaffold.

80 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 The elemental composition of the surface of the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne 

scaffold via XPS (Table 17) showed that carbon and oxygen are the two dominant 

components; it is also noticeable a vestigial amount of nitrogen impurities.  

 

 

 

Similarly to the ATR-FTIR results, the XPS analysis has not established clearly the 

existence of Alkyne functional groups on the surface of the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne. 

Indeed, the C1s peaks (Figure 54) are located in the same places as the peaks from the 

other scaffolds analyzed previously (PA 1000, PA 300 and PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA): the 

peak centered at 284.8 eV is related with both C-H aromatic and aliphatic C-C-C bonds, 

the peak located at 286.2 eV is associated with the C-C-O ether bond and the last two 

peaks are related with the C-C=O (287.3 eV) and O-C=O (288.9 eV) from the ester 

group. The comparison between the PA 300 (section 5.1.) and the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-

Alkyne (Table 18) shows, as expected, that there is a substantial increment in the C-C-

O peak area in the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne scaffold probably due the addition of the 

PEG segments before electrospinning. The high PEG content on the scaffold is also the 

motive for a small O/C ratio (0.59) showed in the element composition table.

6.2.3. Click Chemistry tests 

Since the ATR-FTIR and XPS results were not conclusive about the presence of 

alkyne functional groups on the surface of the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA fibres, a new 

approach was followed by using a fluorescent azide in order to induce the azide-alkyne 

cycloaddition reaction and then locate the functional groups. Although the usual click 

chemistry approaches involved a Cu(I) catalyst, the protocol followed (section 4.5) did 

not include any catalyst. This was because, contrary to the (bis)PEG-Alkyne by itself, 

the alkynes on the surface of the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne electrospun scaffold are 

influenced by neighboring electron-withdrawing functional groups such as the ester 

and the carbonyl groups from the PA 300, leading to the formation of the cycloaddition 

products at room temperature and in a aqueous medium [137]. In addition to this, the 

high local alkyne concentration present on the surface of the scaffold due the 

proportion of PA 300:(bis)PEG-Alkyne (4:1) can also induce the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar 

cycloaddition reaction without the need of a catalyst [138]. Indeed, the properties of 

the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne by inducing the alkyne-azide click chemistry reaction 

without Cu(I),  can avoid the toxic nature of the cooper catalysis [134,139].

Table 18. Fractions of various functional groups from PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne C1s peaks. 

 



82 
 

As expected, the detectable fluorescence only occurs at the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-

Alkyne fibres after azide incubation, indicating the existence of alkyne functional 

groups on its surface (Figure 55).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The adsorption process is also confirmed with the analysis of the negative 

controls, that showed no fluorescence properties under far-red light: the PA 300 

scaffold after azide incubation (Figure 56) and the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne scaffold 

before azide incubation (Figure 57). The first condition allows to exclude the relevance 

of the azide absorption process in the detectable fluorescence; on the other hand, as 

the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne scaffold before azide incubation didn’t show 

fluorescence, the auto-fluorescence process is also excluded.

7. Discussion 

The selection of PolyActive as biomaterial was made not only because of its 

physical and mechanical properties such as elasticity and toughness, but also because 

it is a well studied polymer with good levels of biocompatibility and biodegradability. 

Furthermore, this copolymer was already successfully electrospun and adapted for 

several tissue engineering applications due its versatility.  

As explained in previous chapters, by shifting the weight ratios of the PEOT and 

PBT segments and the molecular weight of the PEG, a wide range of polymers with 

distinct mechanical, biological and physicochemical properties can be obtained. 

Papadaki et al. [19] have studied the effects of different PEGT/PBT weight percentages 

and two different molecular weights (300 Da and 1000 Da) of PEG in the behavior of 

two different cell lines: skeletal muscle cells and chondrocytes. The results have 

showed that the cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation depend not only on 

the copolymer composition, but also on the cell type used. In fact, the skeletal muscle 

cells exhibited maximum attachment, proliferation and differentiation on the 

300PEGT55PBT45 substrate comparing with their response on the other scaffolds. On 

the other hand, chondrocytes exhibited a more pronounced cell response (attachment 

and proliferation) on the 1000PEGT70PBT30 substrate. The differences between the 

two scaffolds are more pronounced on the skeletal muscle cells behavior since their 

attachment is similar for 300PEGT55PBT45 and 1000PEGT55PBT45, but the 

proliferation is more accentuated on the 300PEGT55PBT45. This allows to conclude 

that for this particular cell line, the PEGT weight percentage is crucial for cell 

attachment purposes and the PEG molecular weight is important for proliferation. 

Generally, the scaffolds with higher percentage of PEOT (or PEGT) or higher PEG 

molecular weight present a more hydrophilic surface, which leads to a considerable 

higher water uptake and consequently to an elevated absorption of biomolecules and 

changes on the surface due swelling. The absorption process by annulling the 

adsorption of medium proteins and adhesion molecules on the surface of the scaffolds 

can reduce the attachment of cells that require a high level of adhesion biomolecules. 

In addition to this, longer PEG chains originate instability on the surface, leading to an 

inhibition of cell lines that exhibit high tensile stress.  

The most popular PEOT/PBT copolymers combinations are 300PEOT55PBT45 

and 1000PEOT70PBT30, and according to the literature, the PA 300 (55/45) induce 

superior cell responses and the PA 1000 (70/30) present better in vivo degradation. 

Although these scaffolds are commonly used in bone and skin tissue regeneration 

applications, modifications on their surfaces can help to optimize the advantages and 

reduce their weakness in order to produce more adaptable and suitable scaffolds for 

tissue engineering processes.

In the chapter 5 it was described that the introduction of oxygen containing 

functional groups to the PA 1000 surface via UV irradiation can influence protein 

adsorption and cell attachment. According to the ATR-FTIR analysis, there is a 

continuously increasing O-H peak area after the first 10 minutes of UV exposure, while 

there is a decrease in the ester, ether and aromatic associated peaks. This means that 

the functional groups are probably hydroxyl and carboxyl generated due the photo-

oxidation of the PEO segment. The introduction of these oxygen groups are 

corroborated by the XPS results, which presents an increase on the O/C ratio after 40 

minutes of UV irradiation.  

Contrary to PA 1000, the modifications on the PA 300 electrospun fibres 

through UV exposure are mostly influenced by the degradation of the PBT segment, 

which results in the appearance of mono and di-hydroxy-substituted compounds on 

the aromatic rings. The instability of these compounds is visible in the evolution of the 

O-H ATR-FTIR peak area during 180 minutes of UV treatment: simultaneously to a 

decrease in the ATR-FTIR peak areas associated with the backbone main chain, the O-H 

region showed an oscillatory behavior during the first 90 minutes of UV exposure. This 

can be explained by the instability of the mono and di-hydroxy-substituted 

compounds, which can easily originate P-benzonquinones via a reversible redox 

reaction. After this period, a collapse of the aromatic ring is noticeable due to the 

decreasing O-H peak. The formation of P-benzonquinones is supported by the visible 

yellowing of the scaffolds and via XPS analysis by the decreasing on the O/C ratio after 

40 minutes of UV exposure.     

The scaffolds were treated by UV irradiation during 40 minutes with purpose of 

evaluating the influence that the oxygen containing functional groups on the PA 1000 

surface and the presence of P-benzonquinones on the PA 300 surface have on the 

protein adsorption and cell attachment processes.  

For both scaffolds, the fluorescent microscope observations were made by 

using the FITC-BSA protein as model protein. The comparison between untreated and 

treated samples showed that the detectable fluorescence only came from the UV 

treaded scaffolds after FITC-BSA incubation, excluding the auto-fluorescence and the 

protein absorption phenomena influence on these observations. It was also tried an 

optimization of these results by adding the EDC/NHS complex in both scaffolds before 

FITC-BSA incubation; and, although the presence of carboxylic acids on the surface of 

both PA 1000 and PA 300 was observed after 40 minutes under UV irradiation, there 

was no detectable changes in the detectable fluorescent in the two cases. Because of 

that and to simplify the surface functionalization process, the EDC/NHS complex was 

eliminated from the methodology followed for the evaluation of the cell response. 

However, in the future, the influence of the EDC/NHS complex should be tested with a 

protein quantification process like the ninhydrin test. The protein adsorption tests also 



86 
 

included the modification of the fibre surface with a spatially defined UV exposure by 

using a mask for spatial patterning. The results show successfully and spatially 

controlled alterations in the degree of FITC-BSA adsorption on both UV treated 

scaffolds. 

The results presented by the protein adsorption tests were confirmed by the 

interaction between the Rat Schwann Cells and the untreated and treated electrospun 

scaffolds. Although they had successfully attached on untreated and treated surfaces 

of both PA 1000 and PA 300 scaffolds, there was a clear preference for the activated 

areas on the surfaces treated with the UV mask, which means that there are more 

functional groups available after UV irradiation, and consequently more adsorbed 

adhesion proteins in these locations. This can be also validated by the higher number 

of cells on the UV treated scaffolds, comparing with the untreated samples. 

The changes on the morphology of the cells were not noticeable between 

untreated and treated surfaces. However the PEG molecular weight and the 

percentage of the copolymers PEOT/PBT seem to affect Rat Schwann cells 

morphology. Indeed, when cultured on the PA 1000 samples, the cells showed a 

flattened pattern. On the other end, on the surface of the PA 300, the cells presented a 

spindle shaped morphology. Similar differences were reported by Chew et al. [140], 

that have studied the effects of aligned and random PCL fibrous scaffolds in the 

morphology of the Rat Schwann cells. The results showed that the cells were able to 

elongate unidirectionally along the fibre axes on aligned electrospun, but when 

cultured on a random fibrous scaffold, the cells adopted a random orientation and a 

spread-out morphology. Based on these results, there is a possibility that the 

variations in the cell morphology may occur due to slight differences in the alignment 

of the electrospun fibres in both PA 1000 and PA 300. One hypothesis is that, although 

the same electrospinning set up was used for both copolymers, the PA 1000 

electrospinning jet was able to discharge its electric charge more efficiently to the 

water vapor molecules in the atmosphere, comparing with the PA 300 jet that is more 

hydrophobic. As a considerable portion of the charge from the PA 1000 jet is 

discharged during electrospinning, the generated fibres will be less charged and, 

consequently, the influence of the electrodes that are responsible for their alignment 

will be less significant. In addition to this, the long PEG chains and the high PEO 

content of the PA 1000 can easily be affected by the aqueous environment during the 

cell culture protocol, leading to an increasing instability on the polymer backbone 

chain that can originate deviations from the original fibre alignment. Finally, in order to 

complete the analysis described in the section 5.3, a Real-time PCR analysis can be 

done in the future with the purpose of study the maturation of the Rat Schwann cells 

on the PA 300 and PA 1000 untreated and treated scaffolds [140]; another possibility is 

using other cell line, such as skeletal muscle cells, that need more adhesion proteins on 

the surface to attach, than the rat Schwann cells [19]. In this way it would be easier to 



87 
 

observe differences in the attachment process between untreated and UV treated 

PolyActive samples.  

The modification of the PA 300 and PA 1000 surfaces by UV irradiation proved 

to be able to improve protein adsorption and it has also showed promising results in 

enhancing cell attachment. So, it is reasonable to consider UV treatment as a valid 

alternative to other PolyActive functionalization techniques such as plasma activation. 

Claase et al. [141] have exhaustively explored strategies to functionalize the surface of 

PA 1000 scaffolds: firstly, they used acidic and alkaline treatments to modify the 

surface, however the acidic treatment did not enhance cell attachment and growth 

and the alkaline treatment has resulted in severe surface degradation. In another 

approach, hydroxyapatite (HA) was incorporated on the PA 1000 scaffolds to augment 

the proteins adsorption and consequently increase the bone marrow stromal cell 

adhesion and growth. This methodology only showed positive results on particular 

areas of the scaffold because the cells were able to attach to the added HA but not to 

the copolymer. The same authors have explored the effects of the CO2 gas plasma 

treatment on the surface of the PA 1000 films, and likewise what was described in 

chapter 5, it resulted in the generation of oxygen containing functional groups on the 

surface of the scaffold and in a subsequent increment of protein adsorption from the 

medium, leading to an effective attachment of the bone marrow stromal cells. In 

another approach, Nandakumar et al. [98] have successfully modify the surface of     

PA 300 electrospun scaffolds via oxygen plasma in order to optimize the human 

mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) adhesion and proliferation. It was demonstrated 

that the treated scaffolds showed higher oxygen content on their surface, comparing 

to the untreated ones, which is associated with the presence of functional groups like 

hydroxyl and carboxyl. These functional groups were able to enhance the medium 

protein adsorption process, leading to an improved attachment and proliferation of 

the hMSC.       

The strategies described above can be optimized by incorporating 

functionalized PEG linkers on the surface with the purpose of having a preferential 

immobilization of functional biomolecules or nanostructures. In this way, a single 

scaffold is able to possess binding areas with specific affinities in order to selectively 

immobilize biomolecules on particular regions of the surface and consequently build a 

complex and organized cell guide system.      

An innovative and original technique to modify the PA 300 (55/45) surface is 

suggested in the chapter 6. The strategy adopted in this chapter has the purpose of 

modifying the surface of the PA 300 electrospun scaffold by adding functionalized PEG 

in the polymer solution before the electrospinning process. The goal is endow the 

copolymer surface with specific functional groups without previous surface treatments 

or incubation periods. The Figure 58 compare the approach suggested on chapter 6 



88 
 

(strategy A) with the common procedure for incorporate functionalized PEG linkers on 

the surface of electrospun scaffolds (strategy B). Basically, the strategy A describes 

that the functionalized PEG should be mixed together with the polymer in a blending 

solution before the electrospinning process. At the end, the fibres should have 

incorporated the functional groups on their surface for further biomolecule 

immobilization. The success of this strategy will open the window for new surface 

modification methodologies since it is a much efficient and practical approach than the 

strategy B, which describes a complex approach: in the first phase of the process, the 

polymer of interest is electrospun; then, depending on the intrinsic characteristics of 

the fibrous scaffold, the resultant fibres can be treated by a specific surface 

modification technique, leading to the formation of functional groups able to crosslink 

with one terminal of the functionalized PEG during an incubation period. The other 

terminal of the functionalized PEG will then immobilize specific biomolecules. The 

strategy B was described in the section 5.2, when the complex NHS/EDC was 

incorporated on the surface of both PA 1000 and PA 300 electrospun fibres.        

 

 

 

  

 

   

 

 

 

 

      

 

 

 

The incorporation of the functionalized PEG linkers can lead to an increase in 

the chain instability of the target polymer because augmenting its length also increases 

the hydrophilic properties of the polymer. Therefore, to avoid a fast degradation by 

Figure 58. Incorporation of functionalized PEG linkers on the surface of electrospun scaffolds by two 
different strategies. 



89 
 

hydrolysis and to ensure a proper polymer length, the copolymer PA 300 was selected 

to test the viability of the strategy A. The (bis)PEG-SVA and (bis)PEG-Alkyne were 

chosen as functionalized PEG linkers because they allow to explore two different kinds 

of immobilization processes: by the NHS-ester – protein interaction (section 6.1.1.) and 

via the “click chemistry” approach (section 6.2.1.).   

The PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA ATR-FTIR spectrum allowed to confirm a higher 

polymer backbone length, comparing with PA 300 by itself, but it was not conclusive 

about the presence of NHS on the surface of the fibres. However, this result is 

acceptable since the proportion of PA 300 per (bis)PEG-SVA is 4:1, and therefore it is 

plausible that the peaks originated from the NHS stretches, which are usually located 

at 1719 cm
-1

, 1745 cm
-1

 and 1818 cm
-1

, are barely noticeable. On the other hand, the 

XPS analysis was able to prove the presence of the NHS-ester on the surface of the 

fibres by the appearance of one peak at 401.5 eV, which can be associated with this 

functional group. The FITC-BSA was used as model protein to test the ability of the 

PA300 + (bis)PEG-SVA in immobilize proteins. The results have definitely confirmed the 

presence of the functional groups on the surface of the fibres since the only detectable 

fluorescence signal was originated from the PA300 + (bis)PEG-SVA scaffold after FITC-

BSA incubation. 

The ATR-FTIR and XPS analysis of the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne scaffolds were 

only able to demonstrate the increase of the polymer chain due the adding of the 

(bis)PEG-Alkyne (section 6.2.2.), in fact none of the spectra have showed new peaks. 

However, the presence of the alkyne terminals on the surface of the fibres was 

confirmed by the click chemistry test (section 6.2.3.). Indeed, the fluorescent azides 

were immobilized only by the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne electrospun scaffolds.    

Although the presented results allow to conclude that the PEG linker functional 

groups were successfully incorporated on the surface of the scaffolds, it would be 

interesting, in the future, to test the cell response (adhesion, proliferation and 

differentiation) on similar scaffolds and also analyze the PA 300 + (bis)PEG-SVA and PA 

300 + (bis)PEG-Alkyne electrospun scaffolds via TOF-SIMS, which is the most sensitive 

surface analysis technique.     

In summary, the strategy followed in chapter 6 proved to be a simple and 

efficient approach to functionalize electrospun scaffolds. In fact, comparing to other 

surface modification techniques such as the one presented on chapter 5, this original 

approach avoids a large variety of disadvantages like degradation due photo-exposure 

or hydrolysis, as well as other problems related with energetic beams like wave 

diffraction, scattering and backscattering. One possible application for this surface 

modification technique is the fabrication of electrospun scaffolds with two different 

types of fibres, resulting in two incorporated chemical groups for later 

functionalization.  This approach involves an adaptation of the traditional 



90 
 

electrospinning set up since it demands that two spinnerets electrospin the different 

bending solutions (Polymer A + functionalized PEG linker A and Polymer B + 

functionalized PEG linker B) at same time. Then, the right conformation of the 

electrodes will generate a scaffold divided by two different types of fibres with distinct 

functional groups. As each kind of fibre has affinity with one specific type of 

biomolecule, it will be possible to functionalize the electrospun scaffold with high 

spatial definition. This type of scaffold could be very helpful for tissue engineering 

applications that involve the segregation of a mixed cell population since different cell 

lines have affinity with different type of biomolecules (Figure 59).

8. Conclusion 

The design and fabrication of biofunctional tissue engineering scaffolds involve 

a wide range of challenges from the selection of the bulk material to the tailoring of 

the mechanical, physical and biological functionalities. So, towards developing the next 

generation of tissue regenerative interfaces, electrospun scaffolds of PEOT/PBT 

copolymers were successfully produced in order to provide topographical and 

biochemical cues for cell guidance. Indeed, the scaffolds were designed and fabricated 

to mimic the natural extracellular cell matrix by including aligned fibres and chemical 

functional groups on their surface for later biomolecules immobilization.   

The alignment and deposition of the electrospun fibres were managed by using 

the gap method under a controlled environment and the biochemical cues were 

introduced on the surface after the application of two distinct surface modification 

techniques: UV irradiation and incorporation of functionalized PEG linkers.  

In the study presented in the Chapter 5 it was shown that UV irradiation can be 

used to modify the surface properties of both PA 300 and PA 1000 electrospun 

scaffolds by introducing new functional groups onto the scaffolds surfaces in order to 

improve the protein adsorption from the culture medium and consequently increase 

the available areas for cell adhesion. These areas could be spatially controlled by using 

a UV mask able to modify the degree of protein adsorption on electrospun fibres and 

consequently provide different cell responses (cell attachment, proliferation, 

differentiation, migration) on the same scaffold, depending on the copolymer 

composition and on the cell type used. In addition to this, the UV treatment offers the 

opportunity to create complex surface compositions for both soft- and hard-tissue 

applications because it can enhance the immobilization of proteins independently of 

the variations in the PEOT/PBT weight percentage and in the PEG molecular weight 

present on the copolymer composition.   

The innovative approach investigated in the Chapter 6 described the 

incorporation of the functional groups originated from specific PEG linkers on the 

surface of PA 300 electrospun scaffolds before the elctrospinning process. To my 

knowledge, it was the first time that (bis)PEG-SVA and (bis)PEG-Alkyne were 

electrospun together with a copolymer, leading to the fabrication of functional fibres 

with NHS-esters and Alkynes on their surface, respectively. These incorporated 

functional groups are able to allow a selective immobilization of biomolecules onto the 

surface of the electrospun fibres, avoiding unspecific adsorption and giving to the 

scaffold a high degree of specificity. In reality, this original concept can be adopted for 

multiple tissue engineering applications since it present a simple and efficient 

methodology to develop biofunctional electrospun scaffolds able to reproduce 

complex cell microenvironments.
