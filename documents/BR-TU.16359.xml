ABSTRACT: Diagenetic reactions, characterized by the dissolu-
tion and precipitation of minerals at low temperatures, control the 
quality of sedimentary rocks as hydrocarbon reservoirs. Geochemical 
modeling, a tool used to understand diagenetic processes, is perfor-
med through computer codes based on thermodynamic and kinetic 
parameters. In a comparative study, we reproduced the diagenetic 
reactions observed in Snorre Field reservoir sandstones, Norwegian 
North Sea. These reactions had been previously modeled in the litera-
ture using DISSOL-THERMAL code. In this study, we modeled the 
diagenetic reactions in the reservoirs using Geochemist’s Workbench 
(GWB) and TOUGHREACT software, based on a convective-dif-
fusive-reactive model and on the thermodynamic and kinetic para-
meters compiled for each reaction. TOUGHREACT and DISSOL-
THERMAL modeling showed dissolution of quartz, K-feldspar and 
plagioclase in a similar temperature range from 25 to 80°C. In con-
trast, GWB modeling showed dissolution of albite, plagioclase and 
illite, as well as precipitation of quartz, K-feldspar and kaolinite in 
the same temperature range. The modeling generated by the different 
software for temperatures of 100, 120 and 140°C showed similarly 
the dissolution of quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase and kaolinite, but 
differed in the precipitation of albite and illite. At temperatures of 
150 and 160°C, GWB and TOUGHREACT produced different 
results from the DISSOL-THERMAL, except for the dissolution 
of quartz, plagioclase and kaolinite. The comparative study allows 
choosing the numerical modeling software whose results are closer to 
the diagenetic reactions observed in the petrographic analysis of the 
modeled reservoirs.

RESUMO: Reações diagenéticas, caracterizadas pela dissolução e pre-
cipitação de minerais a baixas temperaturas, controlam a qualidade 
de rochas sedimentares como reservatórios de hidrocarbonetos. A mod-
elagem geoquímica, ferramenta utilizada para compreender os proces-
sos diagenéticos, é feita através de códigos computacionais com base em 
parâmetros termodinâmicos e cinéticos. Em um estudo comparativo, 
foram reproduzidas as reações diagenéticas observadas nos arenitos-res-
ervatório do Campo de Snorre, Mar do Norte Norueguês. Essas reações 
já haviam sido previamente modeladas na literatura com uso do código 
DISSOL-THERMAL. Neste estudo, modelamos reações diagenéticas 
de reservatórios usando os códigos Geochemist’s Workbench (GWB) e 
TOUGHREACT, com base em um modelo de convecção-difusão-reação 
e nos parâmetros termodinâmicos e cinéticos compilados para cada 
reação. A modelagem com TOUGHREACT e DISSOL-THERMAL 
mostrou dissolução de quartzo, feldspato potássico e plagioclásio em uma 
faixa de temperatura similar de 25 a 80°C. Em contraste, a modelagem 
com GWB mostrou dissolução de albita, plagioclásio e illita, bem como 
precipitação de quartzo, feldspato potássico e caulinita na mesma faixa 
de temperatura. As modelagens geradas pelos diferentes códigos para as 
temperaturas de 100, 120 e 140°C mostraram semelhanças na dissolução 
de quartzo, feldspato potássico, plagioclásio e caulinita, mas diferiram 
na precipitação de albita e illita. Em temperaturas de 150 e 160°C, os 
resultados do GWB e TOUGHREACT produziram valores diferentes do 
DISSOL-THERMAL, exceto para a dissolução de quartzo, plagioclásio 
e caulinita. O estudo comparativo permite escolher o software de mod-
elagem numérica cujos resultados estão mais próximos das reações dia-
genéticas observadas na análise petrográfica dos reservatórios modelados.

INTRODUCTION 

Petroleum systems are dynamic physical-chemical envi-
ronments of generation, migration and storage of oil. Initially, 
oil is generated in a rock rich in organic matter that suf-
fers a maturation process in specific depth and temperature 
(source rock). The oil then migrates to a porous lithology 
that will store it (the reservoir rock), where it is trapped by 
another rock that has low permeability (the seal) (Magoon 
&amp;amp; Dow 1994; Gluyas &amp;amp; Swarbrick 2004). 

Unlike the seal rocks, reservoir rocks are characterized by 
high porosity and permeability. The reservoirs are normally 
carbonate rocks (Roehl &amp;amp; Choquette 1985) or siliciclastic 
rocks (Barwis et al. 1990), formed as the result of several 
transformations that occur in the deposited sediments, via 
modification of the original texture, composition and, conse-
quently, in the porosity. Such processes are called diagenesis. 

The most common diagenetic processes that affect the 
porosity and permeability of reservoirs are compaction 
and precipitation of various types of carbonates, silicates and 
other minerals (Tucker 2001). If precipitated as cements 
in significant amounts in the space between the primary 
depositional constituents, these diagenetic minerals com-
promise the porosity of the rocks, making them unfeasible 
as a reservoir. Nevertheless, there is also the possibility of 
subsequent dissolution of diagenetic cements, generating 
secondary porosity, as occurs in many reservoirs (Bjorlykke 
1984; Schmidt &amp;amp; McDonald 1979; Surdam et al. 1984). 

The diagenetic processes allow a variety of minerals to 
occur as cement in sedimentary rocks. The most common 
cements are:
1. quartz in the form of secondary overgrowths around 

detrital grains and intergranular microcrystals;
2. K-feldspar as secondary overgrowths or discrete crystals 

filling pores;
3. carbonates, like calcite and dolomite, siderite and more 

rarely ankerite, rhodochrosite and magnesite;
4. clay minerals, like kaolinite, illite, chlorite,  smectite and 

interstratified mixed-layers (especially  illite-smectite).

Clay minerals are volumetrically less significant, but 
extremely important, since they commonly occur as rims 
or coatings around grains, exerting enormous influence on 
the permeability of rocks, damaging the quality of reservoirs 
(Houseknecht &amp;amp; Pittman 1992). 

Chemical phenomena are the most common during diagen-
esis, comprising reactions that result in precipitation of authi-
genic minerals or secondary dissolution. From the geochemical 
point of view, these reactions occur because the constituents 
of the sediments are always trying to reach equilibrium, and, 
therefore, tend to interact with the interstitial fluids through 

diagenetic processes (Burley et al. 1985). The diagenetic pro-
cesses are controlled not only by temperature (T), pressure (P) 
and the original mineral assemblage, but also by the activi-
ties of the ions dissolved in the formation waters, including 
organic solutes, Eh and pH conditions. 

Galloway (1984) establishes three main hydrological 
regimes for fluids within sedimentary basins, related to their 
movement and occurrence:
1. meteoric regime, affecting the shallower portions of basins, 

characterized by infiltration of surface to groundwaters;
2. compactional regime, linked to expulsion of pore waters 

due to burial;
3. thermobaric or abyssal regime, associated to the deeper 

parts of the basins, where the interstitial fluids are affec-
ted by clay minerals dehydration and oil generation. 

Geochemical modeling is a tool used to understand the 
diagenetic processes. It is performed through computer codes 
based on thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. However, 
since there are several mutually-influencing parameters, each 
code must be used carefully in order to better simulate the 
natural conditions. In this study, we reproduced the diage-
netic reactions observed in the Snorre Field sandstones reser-
voir, Norwegian North Sea using Geochemist’s Workbench 
(GWB) and TOUGHREACT software, based on a convec-
tive-diffusive-reactive model, and the thermodynamic and 
kinetic parameters compiled for each reaction. The Snorre 
Field was chosen considering the availability of petrographic 
and stratigraphic data to build a conceptual model of the 
diagenetic reactions (Baccar &amp;amp; Fritz 1993; Morad et al. 
1990). Nevertheless, such study has potential application 
to the modeling of Brazilian reservoirs with similar compo-
sition, depositional and burial evolution.

Baccar and Fritz (1993) modeled the diagenetic reac-
tions in Snorre Field reservoir sandstones using DISSOL-
THERMAL code. We reproduced the same study using 
GWB and THOUGHREACT codes, so that we could 
evaluate similarities and divergences in the results of each 
system according to a wide temperature range. 

GEOCHEMICAL 
MODELING APPROACH

Although the fundamental concepts of chemical model-
ing have evolved much before, geochemical modeling begins 
in the 1960s, with the pioneering efforts of researchers such 
as Garrels and Mackenzie (1967), Helgeson (1967a, 1967b), 
and Helgeson and James (1968). The first simulations were 
originally applied to the understanding of the basic issues 
involving chemical reactions in aquatic environments related

Geochemical Modeling of Diagenetic Reactions



to pollution of surface waters and assessment of diagenetic 
processes (involving natural formation and alteration of rocks). 

A geochemical model is really only useful as a tool for pre-
diction if there is the possibility to validate the results. In reality, 
this is the goal that most often is unattainable, due to the com-
plexity of natural systems, insufficient field data and uncertainties 
related to changes in the system over time (Nordstrom 1994). 

In the following sections, the main characteristics of 
TOUGHREACT and GWB, software used in this study, are 
described. We also give some characteristics of the DISSOL-
THERMAL code used by Baccar and Fritz (1993).

TOUGHREACT

TOUGHREACT was developed to simulate fluid flow 
non-isothermal multi-component and geochemical transport, 
in order to investigate problems involving simple and complex 
geological environments (Xu &amp;amp; Pruess 1998). TOUGHREACT 
can also use “batch models”, simulating the reactions in a closed 
system. A number of thermo-physical and chemical processes, 
which occur in the subsurface, are considered under the aspect 
of hydrological and geochemical conditions of pressure, tem-
perature, water saturation and ionic strength. The code uses 
non-isothermal equations (Pruess 1987; Pruess et al. 1999). 
The numerical solution to the water-rock interaction is based 
on finite difference (Narasimhan &amp;amp; Witherspoon 1976). 
These equations are solved by the Newton-Raphson interac-
tion (Pruess 1991). The activity coefficient is calculated using 
the Debye-Huckel equation (Helgeson et al. 1981). 

Kinetic rates (mineral dissolution/precipitation) can be 
expressed as function of non-basis species as well. Usually 
the species appearing in rate laws happen to be basis spe-
cies. In this model, we use a rate expression given by Lasaga 
et al. (1994):

rn = An . kn . (1 - )
Q
K  (1)

where positive values of rn indicate dissolution, and negative 
values indicate precipitation; kn is the rate constant (moles 
per mineral surface area unit and time unit), which is tem-
perature dependent; An is the specific reactive surface area 
per kg; and Q/K is the kinetic mineral saturation ratio. The 
temperature dependence of the reaction rate constant can be 
expressed reasonably well via an Arrhenius equation (Lasaga 
1984; Steefel and Lasaga 1994). Because many rate constants 
are reported at 25°C, it is convenient to approximate rate 
constant dependency as a function of temperature, thus: 

kn = k25 . e
( )-Ea

R

T

? 1

 (2)

where e is Euler’s number; Ea is the activation energy; k25 is 
the reaction rate at 25°C; R is gas constant; and T is abso-
lute temperature.

The kinetic rate constant kn in equations 1 and 2 only 
considers the most well-studied mechanisms in pure H2O 
(at neutral pH). Dissolution and precipitation of minerals 
are often catalyzed by H+ (acid mechanism) and OH- (base 
mechanism). For many minerals, the kinetic rate constant k 
includes each of these three mechanisms (Lasaga et al. 1994; 
Palandri &amp;amp; Kharaka 2004).

Geochemist’s Workbench 
The GWB system was developed by the Department of 

Geology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 
1978. It is currently marketed by “Aqueous Solutions LLC” 
(http://www.gwb.com/). The software allows fast assessment 
of the problems most commonly encountered in geochem-
ical modeling: balance reactions speciation in aqueous solu-
tion, water-rock interaction models, and fluid mixture in 
conditions of “batch model” (Bethke 2008). 

GWB can integrate thermodynamic and kinetic param-
eters with species processing of geochemical reactions in 
redox environments (Drever 1997). The batch modeling is 
a process by which a series of irreversible reactions (no equi-
librium) progress to a state of thermodynamic equilibrium 
(Helgeson et al. 1969). These reactions lead to chemical evo-
lution of a system to reach the equilibrium state. To solve 
the equilibrium of an initial system, GWB determines which 
reactions are more likely to happen. 

GWB solves simultaneously a set of non-linear algebraic 
equations, composed by the equation of mass action and the 
equilibrium constant, corresponding to aqueous species, gas 
or minerals that are contained in a database. While GWB 
solves the equation of mass action, it is solving all the mass 
balance of the system. The GWB solves the equations using 
Newton-Raphson method. 

The GWB allows the user to build the rate law for the 
reactions kinetics. Settings are available for kinetic dissolu-
tion/precipitation reactions, redox reactions and microbial 
metabolism. The pattern that GWB uses for the equation 
of the rate law for the dissolution and precipitation of min-
erals takes the following form:

rn = As . k + . (1 - )
Q
K

 (3)

where rk is reaction rate; AS is mineral surface area; k+ is rate 
constant; Q is activity product; and K is equilibrium con-
stant. The ratio Q/K is known as mineral saturation index. 

In many cases, changes in the temperature will affect the 
rates of reactions in progress. In GWB, the activation energy

ture-dependent rate, based on the formulation of Arrhenius:

RT

?

?

?
?  (4) 

where A is pre-exponential factor; Ea is activation energy; 
R is gas constant; and T is absolute temperature.

Diagenesis is defined as the sum of physical and chemical 
changes during progressive burial and heating, reflected in 
compaction owing to known physical processes and to reac-
tions where minerals are dissolved or precipitated. A wide 
variety of diagenetic reactions occur in sandstones, and 
some have significant effects on porosity and permeability. 

Mathematical correlations between 
TOUGHREACT and Geochemist’s 
Workbench, and kinetic parameters 

The mathematical correlations of TOUGHREACT 
resemble in part those of GWB, but there is an import-
ant difference between them. Solving equation 2, we have: 

kn = k25 . e

The kinetic parameters used in the simulations are shown 
in Tab. 1. Each software has different numerical methods 
to solve the diagenetic reactions observed in the geologi-
cal environment. Thus, the kinetic parameters adopted by 
each simulator are submitted to some adjustment factors.

After the kinetic parameters are inserted in each software 
interface, simulators calculate the “global rate constant”, 
whose values are in Tab. 2.

If we look at two different reference books on the equilib-
rium constant value of a chemical reaction, there is a big chance 
that the values found are different (sometimes by a factor of 10 
or more). This discrepancy is because the constant value may 
have been determined in different conditions and perhaps using 
different techniques. A common source of variation in published 
values of K is the ionic composition of the solution (Harris 2012).

T h e  d i a g e n e t i c  r e a c t i o n s  u s e d  b y  G W B  a n d 
TOUGHREACT are shown in Tab. 3. For GWB, the equa-
tions are written with a view to all possible chemical equi-
libria, as a function of hydrogen ion. The GWB uses hydro-
gen ions (H+) to assist in the dissociation of minerals, thus 
enabling the adjustment of the stoichiometric coefficients.

DISSOL-THERMAL

The DISSOL-THERMAL simulator (Fritz 1975, 1981) is 
a geochemical code able to predict whether the mineral con-
stituents are dissolved or precipitated, as well as the composi-
tion of the solution after the water-rock interaction. Through 
the attributed concentration of dissolved species, tempera-
ture, pH, and redox potential, DISSOL-THERMAL code 
provides the diagenetic reactions and calculates the satura-
tion index of minerals present in the geological environment. 

DISSOL-THERMAL is divided into two geochemi-
cal codes:
1. DISSOL — calculates a model for simulating  water-rock 

interactions at a given temperature between 0° and 
300°C; and

2. THERMAL — calculates a model for simulating the effect 
of temperature variation on water-rock equilibrium.

These two codes both operate by combining an initial 
solution saturation test, followed by path calculation (dis-
solution or temperature variation). 

In this study, we used the DISSOL-THERMAL modeling 
results from Baccar and Fritz (1993) and compared to our 
modeling using GWB and TOUGHREACT simulations.

Spur, which is a platform high on the western side of the 
Viking Graben (Jurassic-Cretaceous). The main reservoir 
horizons are fluvial sandstones from the upper member of 
the Upper Triassic Lunde Formation and the Upper Triassic 
to Lower Jurassic Statfjord Formation (Hollander 1987). 

The Lunde Formation, which is the subject of this paper, is 
the uppermost formation of the Triassic Hegre Group (Vollset 
&amp;amp; Dore 1984). It was deposited during the thermal subsid-
ence phase following a Late Permian to Earliest Triassic rifting 
episode (Badley et al. 1988; Nystuen et al. 1989). The Triassic 
to Middle Jurassic sequence on the Snorre Field was uplifted, 
tilted and partly eroded during the Kimmeridgian rifting epi-
sode in Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous times. The uplift was 
followed by subsidence and burial during crustal cooling from 
Early Cretaceous to Recent (Morad et al. 1990).

The sandstones are dominantly fine- to medium-grained 
and arkosic, having as main framework constituents quartz, 
K-feldspar, plagioclase, muscovite, biotite and clay minerals, 
and as accessory constituents garnet, zircon, rutile, tourma-
line, staurolite, sillimanite, kyanite and apatite.

Subordinate constituents include extrabasinal quartz-feld-
spar-mica rock fragments that probably represent granitic 
rocks and/or schists or gneisses. They also include mud and 
carbonate intraclasts. Micas and detrital clay minerals sel-
dom make up more than 2% of the total mineral content 
in the sandstones. Clay minerals of detrital origin include 
smectite, mixed-layer clay minerals, chlorite and subordi-
nate amounts of kaolinite and illite.

Diagenetic clay minerals include pore-filling kaolinite 
and pore-lining smectite, mixed-layer chlorite-smectite, and

chlorite. Diagenetic kaolinite also replaces detrital micas and 
feldspars. Other cements include carbonates, which play a 
significant role in porosity reduction in some of the sand-
stones. The most dominant are calcite and ferroan-calcite. 
Dolomite and ankerite, however, are also present in many 
of the samples, especially above the oil-water contact, and 
within 100 m of the Kimmeridgian unconformity (Fig. 2).

Calcite occurs mainly as nodular to patchy pore-filling or 
replacive poikilotopic cement. Replacement of calcite by fer-
roan-dolomite was observed by Morad et al. (1990). Ferroan-
dolomite and ankerite are commonly associated with detrital 
biotite. Siderite is a subordinate cement in these sandstones, but 
does occur in the flood plain sediments, predominantly as nod-
ules. Authigenic quartz overgrowths (&lt; 1%) are rarely observed. 

Authigenic bipyramidal crystals of anatase (&amp;lt;1%) are recorded 
in most of the studied samples. Other minor authigenic cements 
include albite overgrowths, pyrite and barite (Morad et al. 1990).

The diagenetic evolution of the upper member of the Lunde 
Formation has been controlled by water-rock reactions acting 
during deposition, burial through the cooling phase succeeding 
the Permo-Triassic rifting episode, Kimmeridgian rifting and 
uplift, and post- Kimmeridgian burial. Over this time inter-
val, four major diagenetic regimes (cf. Schmidt &amp;amp; McDonald 
1979) are recognized:
1. Eodiagenesis in the late Triassic;
2. Mesodiagenesis in the late early Jurassic to late Jurassic;
3. Telodiagenesis in the latest Jurassic through early 

Cretaceous; and

Geochemical Modeling of Diagenetic Reactions



4. Mesodiagenesis in the mid-Cretaceous to recent. 

Geochemical modeling 
of diagenetic events

Baccar and Fritz (1993) studies were focused on the 
mesodiagenesis, in which there were several interactions

between the rocks and modified waters in different tempera-
tures. Our studies are referred to the same conditions. The 
scenario that will be modeled in this study is the interaction 
of Lunde Formation with a modified seawater in different 
conditions of temperature, which correspond to mesodia-
genesis conditions (Morad et al. 1990).

The primary rock is a sandstone with an average sim-
plified composition of 70% quartz, 20% feldspars and 
10% clays. The complete mineral composition of this rock 
is detailed in Tab. 4 and the quantity of each mineral is 
represented by volume fraction dissolved per kg of H2O. 
Seawater composition was compiled from Nordstrom 
et  al. (1979), and the major element composition is 
shown in Tab. 5. Diagenetic events are modeled in the 
following temperatures:

 ? Event 1: 25, 40, 60 and 80°C;
 ? Event 2: 100, 120 and 140°C;
 ? Event 3: 150 and 160°C.

RESULTS

Diagenetic processes, as predicted by modeling the water-
rock interaction between 25 and 160°C using TOUGHREAT 
and GWB, in comparison to DISSOL-THERMAL, are 
summarized in Fig. 3. The modeling with TOUGHREACT 
and DISSOL-THERMAL showed dissolution of quartz, 
K-feldspar, plagioclase, kaolinite and illite between 25 and 
160°C. When GWB was used, quartz, K-feldspar, albite, 
illite and kaolinite were precipitated. 

At temperatures of 100, 120 and 140°C, the 3 differ-
ent modeling systems indicate the dissolution of quartz, 
K-feldspar, plagioclase and kaolinite, converging regarding 
their results.

At temperatures of 150 and 160°C, GWB and 
TOUGHREACT produce different results from those of 
DISSOL-THERMAL with dissolution of K-feldspar.

Above 100°C, we observed similar behavior in GWB and 
TOUGHREACT modeling due to the high kinetics and 
thermodynamics involved in diagenetic reactions, favoring 
the polynomial equations used by simulators.

DISCUSSION

As showed in the results, the use of different codes produces 
different results during modeling. The convergence of results 
is more evident between TOUGHREACT and DISSOL-
THERMAL than between DISSOL-THERMAL and GWB 
software. Generally at low temperatures, the simulation results 
show some discrepancies, because each software uses different 
numerical methods to solve a different set of reactions.

The choice of the software for geochemical modeling 
should consider the differences of each code, in a way to 
reproduce the reactions of the geological environment of 
interest with greater approximation of reality.

At low temperatures (T &amp;lt;80°C), it is not possible to 
observe similarity among the results of the different codes 
due to the low kinetic energy involved in the diagenetic 
reactions. Each simulator has its own algorithms based on 
 mathematical codes that are dependent on kinetic and thermo-
dynamic parameters of each mineral, contained in database. 

In the physical-chemical approach to higher tempera-
ture reactions, the kinetic energy increases to the point 
to generate similar results, regardless of the model. In the 
present study, it is shown that at elevated temperatures 
(100 to 140°C) there is an increase in kinetic energy, 
incrementing the intensity of the diagenetic reactions.

Geochemical Modeling of Diagenetic Reactions



Consequently, the GWB, TOUGHREACT and DISSOL-
THERMAL systems generate similar results. However, 
GWB and THOUGHREACT have different approaches 
while working with high temperatures when compared 

to the DISSOL-THERMAL. This can be observed by the 
behavior of illite and K-feldspar.

In general, above 100°C, GWB and TOUGHREACT repro-
duce similar behavior. The numerical method of both systems uses

polynomial equations of 8th grade to resolve the  physical-chemical 
interactions in geological environments. These equations are 
dependent on kinetic and thermodynamic data of minerals that 
form parageneses in sandstone reservoirs. For temperatures above 
140°C, these kinetic and thermodynamic data acquire an anom-
alous behavior for some minerals, indicated by the constant value 
of 500. If the software finds the 500 value, the previous value is 
used. This is just a reference approach to indicate that that value 
has not been calculated.

TOUGHREACT uses equations of state (EOS) to cal-
culate the mass balance. The EOS perform two import-
ant functions:
1. to calculate the volume fraction of each mineral at the 

time of water-rock interaction;
2. to use the dissolution/precipitation of minerals identi-

fying the change of each mineral phase.

From the variation in the minerals volume, it is possi-
ble to calculate the porosity and permeability. 

The software that is most similar to DISSOL-THERMAL 
in the condition of this study is TOUGHREACT. This sim-
ilarity is due to the mathematical treatment as discretization 
technique (method to solve the differential equations) and the 
finite difference method, providing flexibility in the descrip-
tion of the geometry of the reservoir. These numerical approx-
imations increase the resolution of water-rock interaction.

Basically, this comparative study revealed two diagenetic 
stages, taking into account the temperature. The first stage 
corresponds to the temperature range of 25 – 100°C, and the 
second stage, to the temperature range of 120 – 160°C. In the 
lower temperature stage (25 – 100°C), TOUGHREACT 
and DISSOL-THERMAL simulators reproduce the diage-
netic reactions among minerals albite, anorthite and quartz. 
However, GWB and DISSOL-THERMAL software assume 
a similarity of geochemical reactions among a larger number 
of minerals such as illite, kaolinite, K-feldspar and anorthite. 
In the higher temperature stage (120 – 160°C), we find a 
similar behavior in the 3 systems, due to the convergence of 
their numerical methods, as it is evident in Fig. 3.

Users must be careful when choosing a geochemical 
modeling software because, depending on the tempera-
ture range, different systems can produce very discrepant 
behaviors. Although GWB and DISSOL-THERMAL sim-
ulators reproduced the largest number of similar diagenetic 
reactions, users must be cautious in interpreting their data.

CONCLUSIONS

The present study of geochemical modeling com-
paring the application of GWB, TOUGHREACT and 

DISSOL-THERMAL codes for the simulation of diagenetic 
reactions observed in the Snorre Field reservoir sandstones, 
Norwegian North Sea, resulted in the following conclusions: 
1. Diagenetic modeling at low temperatures (25 to 80°C) with 

different simulators reproduce quite different behaviors. In 
this temperature range, which involves low energy, the reac-
tion kinetics and the thermodynamic parameters are treated 
according to the particularities of each code. The numerical 
methods used by GWB and TOUGHREACT software 
are able to achieve only limited convergence of results, 
with low precision expected for diagenetic reactions at 
low-temperature geological environments. 

2. For the range of temperature from 100 to 140°C, in which 
there is higher kinetic energy involved and consequently the 
diagenetic reactions take place with higher intensity, the simu-
lations with all the three systems generate similar results, 
because they use the same mass balance and the same tem-
perature variation for the precipitation/dissolution of mine-
rals. The mathematical interpolations used by simulators 
in this temperature range are more stable and numerically 
accurate, giving rise to a greater convergence of results. 

3. For higher temperatures, from 150 to 160°C, GWB and 
TOUGHREACT reproduced the same behavior of disso-
lution/precipitation of minerals. However, when compared 
to DISSOL-THERMAL code, those results are discrepant. 
In this temperature range, water-rock interaction has a very 
high kinetic energy, causing fast reactions within the geolo-
gical environments, making the prediction of the reaction 
less possible. In this way, each simulator seeks its own best 
set of numerical solutions to achieve the equilibrium.

Users must be cautious when choosing geochemical 
modeling software, as an important factor for choosing a 
simulator is to know the temperature range that will be used. 
With the temperature information, the user should make 
a preliminary study with the available codes to verify the 
convergence of results to the observed diagenetic reactions.
