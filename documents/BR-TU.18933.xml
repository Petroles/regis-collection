Abstract 

Listeria monocytogenes, a foodborne pathogenic bacterium, remains a serious public health 

concern due to its frequent occurrence in food products coupled with a high mortality rate, 

specially among immunocompromised hosts. Bacterial pathogenicity depends greatly on the 

ability to secrete virulence factors to or beyond the bacterial cell surface. Thus, the study of 

secreted proteins is of crucial importance to further develop defensive strategies.  

The Tat pathway, one of the secretion systems present in L. monocytogenes, was until now 

only investigated in silico. Therefore, a better understanding of the Tat pathway was needed. 

In L. monocytogenes, strain EGDe, two proteins constitute the Tat pathway and are encoded 

in the genes tatC (lmo0361) and tatA (lmo0362).  

In the present study, a L. monocytogenes mutant strain lacking the genes coding for the Tat 

pathway was successfully constructed (EGDe ?tatAC). The mutant showed the ability to 

grow at the same growth rate as the parent strain, proving that the Tat pathway is not 

essential for L. monocytogenes survival. Moreover this study showed that both genes are 

transcribed in a bicistronic and growth-phase dependent manner. 

The deletion mutant for the Tat pathway showed no differences in the in vitro virulence 

potential, but significant differences (p &amp;lt;0.05) were found when in vivo virulence potential 

was assessed, being the tat mutant more virulent than the wild-type strain.  

Regulation of tatAC was also investigated, and a deletion mutant for lmo0364, a gene coding 

for a transcription regulator, localized close to the tat genes, was constructed. Our results 

show that Lmo0364 is not related to the other genes in the locus, as it is not involved in the 

transcription regulation of any of the genes analyzed. 

This is, to our knowledge, the first experimental study on the Tat pathway of L. 

monocytogenes. Here we show that this pathway is not essential for the bacterium and that it 

might be impairing its virulence ability.

Resumo 

Listeria monocytogenes é actualmente considerada uma bactéria patogénica de risco para a 

Indústria Alimentar, afectando essencialmente grávidas, crianças, idosos e indivíduos 

imunocomprometidos. Este risco torna-se cada vez mais importante, à medida que 

aumentam os casos de doentes imunocomprometidos, quer por infecções por VIH ou por 

tratamentos como quimioterapia e radioterapia, entre outros. 

L. monocytogenes é uma bactéria gram-positiva em forma de bastonete com dimensões de 

0,4 µm por 1 a 1,5 µm. Esta bactéria caracteriza-se pelo seu baixo teor em G+C, por ser 

anaeróbia facultativa, catalase positiva e oxidase negativa. A sua principal característica é a 

sua versatilidade no que diz respeito às condições de crescimento, nomeadamente, 

temperatura (1 a 45 ?C), pH (4,4 a 9,6), cloreto de sódio (10 a 20% (m/v)), sais biliares (10 a 

40% (m/v)), actividade da água (aw) (?0,92) e a tolerância a alguns metais, geralmente 

tóxicos para outras bactérias, como o lítio, o tálio e o telúrio. 

Listeriose é o nome dado à doença provocada por L. monocytogenes e encontra-se 

associada uma elevada taxa de mortalidade (20 a 30%). Na Europa, o número de casos 

confirmados aumentou 19% em 2009, comparativamente com 2008. L. monocytogenes é 

um parasita intracelular facultativo. Após ingestão de alimentos contaminados, a bactéria 

tem a capacidade de atravessar o epitélio intestinal e disseminar-se através dos vasos 

linfáticos ou sanguíneos, para tecidos mais profundos. O fígado e o baço são órgãos-alvo 

primários para a sucessiva multiplicação bacteriana, com a possível formação de abcessos. 

Uma das principais características fisiopatológicas de L. monocytogenes é a capacidade de 

atravessar barreiras epiteliais, como a barreira hemato-encefálica e a barreira placentária, 

levando a meningo-encefalite ou infecção do feto, podendo eventualmente causar aborto e 

morte ou meningite neonatal. 

A patogenicidade bacteriana encontra-se bastante dependente da capacidade das bactérias 

segregarem factores de virulência, que são expostos à superfície da célula, segregados 

para o ambiente extracelular ou, até mesmo, injectados directamente nas células 

hospedeiras. Enquanto que em bactérias gram-negativas, para que haja secreção de 

proteínas para o exterior da célula têm de ser transpostas duas membranas biológicas, em 

bactérias gram-positivas, os mecanismos de transposição da membrana citoplasmática 

permitem a segregação eficaz de proteínas para o exterior da célula. 

Em bactérias gram-positivas, são, actualmente, reconhecidos sete sistemas de secreção: 

Sec (Secretion), Tat (Twin-arginine translocation), FPE (Fimbrilin – Protein Exporter), 

transportadores ABC (ATP-binding cassette), FEA (Flagella Export Apparatus), Holinas e 

Sistema Wss. 



v 
 

Relativamente a L. monocytogenes, embora a secreção de proteínas seja de extrema 

importância, quer no processo de colonização de ambientes bióticos e abióticos, quer na 

sua virulência, ainda muito pouco é conhecido. Assim, a partir dos genomas sequenciados e 

com recurso à bioinformática, foram indentificados, em L. monocytogenes, todos os 

sistemas descritos para gram-positivos. 

O sistema Tat é responsável pela secreção de proteínas na sua conformação final, tendo as 

proteínas secretadas por este sistema um motivo N-terminal [(S/T)TRRXFLK] de consenso. 

Este sistema de secreção foi primeiramente identificado em bactérias gram-negativas, 

sendo essencial para a sua funcionalidade três proteínas membranares: TatA, TatB e TatC. 

A maioria das bactérias gram-positivas possui um sistema Tat “minimalista” pois apenas as 

proteínas TatA e TatC estão presentes, sendo TatA bifuncional, colmatando a inexistência 

de TatB. 

Este sistema de secreção está presente em vários microrganismos patogénicos, para os 

quais foi demonstrada a sua importância para os estilos de vida, saprófito ou patogénico. A 

secreção de proteínas por este sistema demonstrou ser importante para a mobilidade em 

Escherichia coli O157:H7, para a infecção e para a aquisição de ferro em Pseudomonas 

aeruginosa, para o crescimento, divisão e formação de biofilme em Legionella pneumophila 

e para a capacidade infecciosa in vivo de Staphylococcus aureus. 

Em L. monocytogenes apenas uma cópia dos genes tatA e tatC foi identificada, sendo que a 

proteína considerada como secretada por este sistema se encontra codificada num operão 

muito próximo deste locus. 

O trabalho que aqui se apresenta teve como objectivo o estudo do sistema Tat em L. 

monocytogenes. 

Para avaliar o papel deste sistema de secreção, construiu-se um mutante de delecção da 

estirpe EGDe nos genes codificantes para o sistema Tat. O mutante foi construído usando 

um sistema de dois passos: um primeiro passo de integração e segundo passo de 

desintegração do plasmídeo no genoma, através de regiões homólogas às regiões anterior e 

posterior aos genes. Tanto quanto se sabe, trata-se do primeiro mutante de delecção 

descrito para o sistema Tat em L. monocytogenes. O sistema Tat não se mostrou essencial 

ao crescimento de L. monocytogenes em meio completo e em meio mínimo, apresentando o 

mutante e a estirpe selvagem taxas específicas de crescimento semelhantes. 

Foram efectuados estudos transcriptionais relativos ao locus do sistema, nomeadamente 

análises Northern blot e estudos da actividade promotora, fazendo uso do gene codificante 

para a ?-galactosidase, como gene repórter. A transcrição dos genes tatA e tatC revelou-se 

dependente da fase de crescimento, sendo a transcrição mais evidente na fase exponencial, 



vi 
 

comparativamente com a fase estacionária. Demonstrou-se ainda que a transcrição dos 

genes codificantes para o sistema Tat é bicistrónica, apresentando o operão correspondente 

uma forte actividade promotora.  

A existência de um regulador de transcrição (Lmo0364) codificado no locus estudado, levou 

à hipótese de este se encontrar relacionado com a regulação da transcrição do sistema Tat. 

Esta hipótese foi investigada através da construção de um mutante de delecção neste 

regulador de transcrição. No entanto, não foram registadas alterações, quer na transcrição, 

quer na actividade promotora dos genes estudados. 

Estudos prévios realizados in silico, por outros autores, identificaram apenas uma proteína 

secretada através deste sistema. Esta proteína está codificada no operão lmo0365-67, 

sendo a última do operão (lmo0367). De forma a identificar esta e/ou outras proteínas 

secretadas por este sistema, procedeu-se a uma análise das proteínas secretadas por SDS-

PAGE, não tendo sido no entanto possível detectar alterações entre o secretoma do 

mutante e o secretoma da estirpe selvagem, possivelmente devido às limitações desta 

metodologia (limites de resolução e detecção). 

Os potenciais de virulência dos dois mutantes (EGDe ?tatAC e EGDe ?lmo0364) foram 

também avaliados in vitro, através da infecção de células epiteliais humanas, e in vivo, 

através da contagem de bactérias no baço, após três dias de inoculação subcutânea em 

ratinhos. Apesar de não terem sido identificadas diferenças no potencial virulento in vitro, 

foram verificadas diferenças significativas (p &amp;lt;0,05) in vivo, sendo que o mutante tatAC 

demonstrou um potencial virulento mais elevado do que a estirpe selvagem, demonstrando 

que a presença deste sistema de secreção nesta estirpe poderá dificultar o processo de 

infecção. 

Ao contrário do que se verificou noutros microrganismos patogénicos, o sistema Tat não é 

necessário à sobrevivência de L. monocytogenes e muito menos à sua capacidade 

infecciosa. Tanto quanto se sabe, este trabalho constitui o primeiro trabalho experimental 

realizado em L. monocytogenes, com o objectivo de estudar o sistema de secreção Tat.

1. Introduction  

1.1. Listeria monocytogenes 

1.1.1. Historical facts  

In 1924, after an outbreak in laboratory animals in Cambridge, Murray, Webb and Swann 

have isolated a gram-positive bacterium which they named Bacterium monocytogenes (1), 

due to the monocytosis disease observed in the infected animals. This was considered the 

official discovery of Listeria, which after the name of Bacterium monocytogenes had other 

names as Erysipelothrix, Listerella and finally, Listeria (2), in honor of Lord Lister (3). 

Despite its official discovery date in 1924, there is evidence that this organism had probably 

been observed in histological sections many years before its official discovery and it had 

been cultivated and described by Hülphers in 1911 (4). 

Although the clinical descriptions of infection by L. monocytogenes in animals and humans 

date from the twenties of the last century, only in 1952, in Germany, listeriosis was 

recognized as an important cause of neonatal meningitis and septicemia (5). In 1981, L. 

monocytogenes was for the first time associated with the Food Industry and considered as a 

foodborne pathogen, following an outbreak of listeriosis in Nova Scotia, Canada, with 41 

cases and 18 deaths reported, mostly children and pregnant women, epidemiologically linked 

by the consumption of coleslaw contaminated with sheep feces containing L. monocytogenes 

(6). 

 

1.1.2. Characteristics  

The presence of L. monocytogenes in food products is currently considered a risk in the 

Food Industry. This pathogenic microorganism affects primarily pregnant women, children, 

the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. This risk becomes more important as the 

cases of immunocompromised patients, either by HIV infection or by treatments such as 

chemotherapy and radiotherapy, among others increases. 

Taxonomically, L. monocytogenes belongs to the Bacteria domain, phylum Firmicutes, class 

Bacilli, order Bacillales, family Listeriaceae and gender Listeria. Eight species have been 

described for the genus Listeria: L. monocytogenes, L. ivanovii, L. seeligeri, L. innocua, L. 

welshimeri, L. grayi, L. marthii (7) and L. rocourtiae (8). L. monocytogenes infects ruminants 

and it has been considered the only one pathogenic for humans (9) (10), L. ivanovii was 

thought to infect only ruminants but recently a case of infection by this species in a man was

reported, suggesting that the rarity of human listeriosis due to this species can be explained 

not only by the host tropism factors but also by the rare occurrence of this species in the 

environment, compared with L. monocytogenes (11).  

Thirteen serovars (1/2a, 1/2b, 1/2c, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4a, 4ab, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e and 7), from three 

different lineages (lineages I, II and III) have been described for L. monocytogenes (12). 

L. monocytogenes is a gram-positive rod-shaped bacterium with dimensions of 0.4 µm for 1 

to 1.5 µm. This bacterium has a low G+C content, is a facultative anaerobe, catalase positive 

and oxidase negative. It has peritrich flagella, which presence is very limited when grown at 

37 ?C (13). L. monocytogenes can grow in a range of temperatures from 1 to 45 ?C (14) (15), 

although its optimal growth temperature ranges from 30 to 37 ?C. The growth versatility of 

this bacterium is also observed with respect to pH, as it has the ability to grow at pH values 

between 4.4 and 9.6 (14), although the optimal pH for its growth is neutral or slightly alkaline. 

L. monocytogenes is quite tolerant to sodium chloride (10 to 20% (w/v)) (16) (13) (17), bile 

salts (10 to 40% (w/v)), and to some metals, which are usually toxic for other bacteria, such 

as lithium, thallium and tellurium. It has also the ability to grow in low water activity (aw) 

values, equal or greater than 0.92 (18), but its optimal growth occurs at 0.97. 

 

1.1.3. Infectious cycle 

L. monocytogenes is responsible for listeriosis, a disease with a high mortality rate (20% to 

30%). In the EU, the number of confirmed cases increased 19% in 2009 compared to 2008 

(19). L. monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular bacterium. After ingestion of 

contaminated food it is able to cross the intestinal epithelium and disseminate via the lymph 

and blood-streams to deeper tissues. The liver and the spleen are primary target organs for 

further bacterial multiplication, resulting in possible abscess formation (20). One of the main 

characteristics of L. monocytogenes physiopathology is its capacity of crossing major 

epithelial barriers, the blood-brain barrier and the placental barrier, leading to meningo-

encephalitis or fetus infection, ultimately it can eventually cause abortion, stillbirth or neonatal 

meningitis. 

Briefly, after being ingested this bacterium has the ability of entering the intestine epithelial 

cells and escape from the phagosome, becoming free in the cell cytoplasm. By actin 

polymerization it propels through the cell cytoplasm and into the adjacent cell’s outer 

membrane which encapsulates this protuberance and acquires the bacteria that will become 

once again free in the cell cytoplasm (Figure 1).

characteristic actin tails. e - Actin polymerization allows bacteria to pass into a neighbouring cell by

1.2. Bacterial Secretion Systems 

Bacterial protein secretion is extremely important because secreted proteins are the main 

tool used by bacteria to interact with their environment. Bacterial pathogenicity depends 

greatly on the ability of bacteria to secrete virulence factors which are displayed on the 

bacterial cell surface, secreted into the extracellular milieu or even injected directly into the 

host cell (22). Many nonpathogenic organisms also secrete proteins that are important for its 

growth, for example degradative enzymes such as cellulases, secreted by saprophytic 

bacteria. 

Protein secretion systems have been extensively investigated in a wide range of gram-

negative bacterial species and six secretion systems were identified (numbered from I to V, 

plus the chaperone pathway), although they are not all systematically present in a single 

bacterium and its presence and activity varies from one bacterium to another (23). In 

contrast, information about secretion systems in gram-positive bacteria is still essentially 

restricted to Bacillus subtilis, although other studies concerning gram-positive bacteria such 

as L. monocytogenes (24) (25) and Staphylococcus aureus (26) (27) are starting to be 

reported. 

In gram-positive bacteria seven protein secretion systems are currently recognized: the Sec 

(Secretion) pathway; the Tat (Twin-arginine translocation) pathway; the FPE (Fimbrilin-

Protein Exporter); some ABC (ATP-binding cassette) protein exporters; the FEA (Flagellum 

Export Apparatus); the holins (hole-forming) and the Wss (WXG100 secretion system) (25). 

As occurs in gram-negative bacteria, not all of the secretion pathways are systematically 

present in a single organism, and their respective contribution in protein transportation varies 

from one organism to another.  

All the secretion pathways described for gram-positive bacteria were identified in Listeria 

monocytogenes as schematically shown in Figure 2.

The Sec pathway is the major secretion system in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, not only 

because of the number of proteins considered as exported by this pathway, but also because 

of their importance. Although the presence of the Sec pathway in L. monocytogenes has not 

been experimentally proved, its existence was inferred due to the high number of proteins 

carrying the putative translocation signal peptide and the presence of these proteins in the 

extracellular milieu or in the cell surface (28) (29). This system consists of a heterotrimeric 

SecYEG complex, which is the central component as it forms a channel in the cytoplasmic 

membrane. A cytosolic ATPase SecA is also essential for protein transport. It acts through 

cycles of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding and hydrolysis, thereby facilitating the 

binding of proteins to the system, leading to stepwise export of the proteins (24). In L. 

monocytogenes a SecA paralogue named SecA2 was identified (30) and unlike SecA this is 

not essential for cell viability but it is involved in the secretion of proteins that contribute to 

virulence (31), such as p60 hydrolase (30), NamA (N-acetilmuramidase A) (32) and FbpA 

(Fribonectin-binding protein A) (33). 



Introduction

The proteins secreted by the Tat pathway have a N-terminal signal peptide and an essential 

twin arginine motif, (S/T)TRRXFLK, which straddles the N-domain and the hydrophobic H-

domain (34). Unlike the Sec system, the Tat pathway is considered to secrete proteins in 

their final conformation (35) and somehow rejects the ones that are unfolded. In L. 

monocytogenes EGDe (serovar 1/2a) only one copy of the genes coding for tatA and tatC 

was identified while in the sequenced L. monocytogenes 4b serovars no genes coding for the 

Tat pathway were identified.  

The Fimbrilin-Protein Exporter (FPE) system is responsible for the secretion and 

agglomeration of proteins similar to pilin, and its components are encoded in comG locus. 

Although the existence of this system has never been experimentally demonstrated in L. 

monocytogenes, it is referred because of its similarity with the genetic locus comG of Bacillus 

subtilis. 

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein exporters are transmembrane proteins that utilize the 

energy of ATP hydrolysis to carry out various biological processes, including translocation of 

substrates across membranes. Only recently this type of system was considered as 

responsible for the secretion of four bacteriocins in L. monocytogenes (25).    

In gram-negative bacteria, the Flagellum Export Apparatus (FEA) is related with the type III 

secretion system, together with the Hrp (Hypersensitive response and pathogenicity) pilus 

export apparatus and the injectisome export apparatus (24). From the nine FEA components 

identified in gram-negative bacteria, seven were identified in Listeria, FlhA, FlhB, FliP, FliQ, 

FliR, FliI and FliH. 

Holins are small membrane proteins that allow the transport across the cytoplasmic 

membrane of proteins lacking N-terminal signal sequences. These proteins, which derived 

from phages, are involved in the secretion and activation of proteins with murein hydrolyzing 

activity in early stages of cell lysis, which is very important for apoptosis. Holins are homo-

oligomeric complexes that form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane, allowing an energy 

independent translocation of proteins (24). 

 The Wss system is formed by a protein with 100 amino acids, which has a coil-coil domain 

and a conserved WXG motif, called WXG100 and a membrane-bound ATPase, homologous 

to B. subtilis YukAB. In Listeria only one copy of the gene coding for the protein YukAB was 

identified, which is also present in the non-pathogenic species L. innocua (36).

1.3. The Tat Pathway 

The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway is responsible for the secretion of proteins in 

their folded conformation and, as referred before, targeted proteins to be secreted via Tat 

pathway have a N-terminal consensus motif [(S/T)TRRXFLK] (34). The energy required for 

protein translocation is exclusively acquired from the transmembrane proton electrochemical 

gradient (?p) (37).  

This secretion system was first characterized in plant chloroplasts and in 1998 a homologous 

bacterial Tat pathway was identified in Escherichia coli, encoded by the tat genes (tatA, tatB, 

tatC and tatE) (38).  

In gram-negative bacteria, where this pathway was first identified in prokaryotes, the Tat 

translocation requires three integral membrane proteins belonging to TatA, TatB and TatC 

families, and all of them have been demonstrated to be essential for protein translocation  

(Figure 3A) (34). 

 

Most gram-positive bacteria and 

Archaea possess a simpler and 

minimalist Tat pathway as only tatA 

and tatC genes are present, lacking the 

gene for TatB component, which 

function is performed by a bifunctional 

TatA component (Figure 3B) (39). 

Although the TatB is missing in gram-

positive bacteria, it has been proved its 

functionality in B.subtilis. This operon 

(tatAdCd, named d due to the 

existence of more than one copy of 

these genes in B. subtilis genome) was 

expressed in an E. coli tat null mutant 

and its ability to export several Tat 

substrates was proved (39). 

 

Despite the differences between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, homologues of 

E. coli tat genes have been identified  in the genomes of many bacterial pathogens, including 

E. coli O:157, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae,

pathways (A) in gram-negative and (B) gram-
positive bacteria.

Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, L. monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, 

Legionella pneumophila, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Pasteurella 

multocida, Yersinia pestis, Xanthomonas campestris, X. axonopodis, Xyllela fastidiosa, S. 

aureus and Ralstonia solanacearum (38). For some of these pathogens the importance of 

the Tat pathway was assessed and studied in detail. Those studies proved the involvement 

of the Tat pathway in different lifestyles of bacteria, from saprophytic to pathogenic. 

Translocation of proteins by this system showed to be important for E. coli O157:H7 motility, 

for infection and iron acquisition in P. aeruginosa and for cell growth, division and biofilm 

formation in L. pneumophila (38). In S. aureus, a bacterium taxonomically closer to L. 

monocytogenes, there are evidences of the Tat pathway function in transporting an iron-

dependent peroxidase (FepB) and its need to successful in vivo infection was shown (26).   

 

In L. monocytogenes EGDe, the two proteins which constitute the Tat pathway are encoded 

in the genes lmo0361 and lmo0362. The gene located four genes away of the tat genes 

corresponds to the gene coding for an iron-dependent Dyp-peoxidase (lmo0367), with 40 % 

similarity to FepB of S. aureus considered secreted by the Tat pathway. This indicates that 

probably Lmo0367 is also secreted by the Tat system. This protein is part of an operon 

formed by genes lmo0365, lmo0366 and lmo0367 (40), all of them related with iron. Between 

the two locus mentioned there is a gene coding for a peptidase and a transcriptional 

regulator, lmo0363 and lmo0364, respectively. A schematic representation of the locus 

coding for the Tat Pathway and the protein putatively secreted by this system is shown in 

Figure 4.

2.2. Growth conditions 

Escherichia coli strains were grown at 37 ?C with shaking in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (1 % 

tryptone, 0.5 % yeast extract, 0.5 % NaCl, pH 7.2) or on LA plates (LB supplemented with 

1.5 % (w/v) agar). When required, ampicillin (Amp), erythromycin (Erm) or kanamycin (Kan) 

was added to a final concentration of 100 µg/mL, 150 µg/mL and 50 µg/mL, respectively. 

L. monocytogenes strains were grown at 37 ?C with shaking in brain heart infusion (BHI) 

broth or on BHI plates (BHI supplemented with 1.5% (w/v) agar) and on minimal medium 

Modified Welshimer Broth (MWB) (46) or on Tryptone Soya Yeast Extract Agar (TSA-YE, 

1.5% (w/v) agar). When required, erythromycin (Erm) or kanamycin (Kan) was added to a 

final concentration of 5 µg/mL and 50 µg/mL, respectively. 

 

2.3. Genomic DNA extraction 

Overnight cultures of L. monocytogenes strains were centrifuged at 3500 g for 5 min. The 

pellets were resuspended in 100 µL 1xPBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4, 

1.47 mM KH2PO4, adjusted to a final pH of 7.4) and 5 µL of lysozyme (10 mg/mL) was

added, following 15 min incubation at 37 ?C, with shaking. The DNA was extracted and 

purified using FastDNA kit and protocol from Bio101 (Bio101, USA). 

The DNA quality and concentration was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis (1% 

agarose). 

 

2.4. Construction of mutants 

2.4.1. Construction of double deletion mutant strain (L. monocytogenes EGDe 

?lmo0361 ?lmo0362) 

In order to generate the lmo0361 lmo0362 double deletion mutant, an approximately 1000 

basepair (bp) large region upstream of lmo0362 and downstream of lmo0361 was generated 

from L. monocytogenes EGDe genomic DNA. To generate these regions, a standard 

polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using DNA polymerase high-fidelity 

(Fermentas, Canada), primers Tat_A together with Tat_B, and primers Tat_C together with 

Tat_D, as listed in Appendix 1 (for schematic representation see Figure 5). The first fragment 

(AB) was digested with restriction enzymes SalI and MluI and cloned in the temperature 

sensitive plasmid pMAD (Appendix 2), resulting the pMAD-TatAB plasmid. The second 

fragment (CD) was digested with restriction enzymes MluI and BglII and cloned in the pMAD-

TatAB plasmid, resulting the pMAD-TatAD plasmid which had two approximately 1000 bp 

region, each homologous to the up and down-stream of the genes of interest. 

The pMAD-TatAD plasmid was electroporated into L. monocytogenes EGDe, according to 

Park et al. (47). To induce chromosomal integration of the pMAD-TatAD, the cells were 

grown at a non permissive temperature (42 ?C) on BHI plates containing erythromycin (5 

µg/mL). Colonies containing the integrated plasmid were grown for eleven days at a 

permissive temperature (30 ?C) without antibiotics, allowing the plasmid excision from the 

chromosome and its loss from the cell, thus allowing excising the genes lmo0361 and 

lmo0362 from the chromosome (schematic representation of gene deletion in Appendix 3). 

Finally, the presence of lmo0361 and lmo0362 regions was investigated through 

amplification from the resulting mutants using the internal primers for both genes, TatA_fw 

with TatA_rv and TatC_fw with TatC_rv, respectively (for schematic representation see 

Figure 5).

2.4.2. Construction of deletion mutant strain (L. monocytogenes EGDe ?lmo0364) 

In order to generate the lmo0364 (transcription regulator) deletion mutant, an approximately 

400 bp large region upstream and downstream of lmo0364 was generated from L. 

monocytogenes EGDe genomic DNA. To generate these regions, a standard polymerase 

chain reaction (PCR) was done using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes, Finland), primers P1-

lmo0364 and P2-lmo0364, and primers P3-lmo0364 together with P4-lmo0364, as listed in 

Appendix 1. The resulting products were used to produce an approximately 800 bp fragment 

by splicing by overlap extension (SOE-ing) (48). After digestion of this fragment with EcoRI 

and BamHI it was cloned in the temperature sensitive plasmid pAULA (Appendix 2) resulting 

the pAULA–?lmo0364, which construction was confirmed by sequencing with primers pAUL-

1 and pAUL-2 (Appendix 1).  

The pAULA–?lmo0364 plasmid was electroporated into L. monocytogenes EGDe (47). To 

induce chromosomal integration of the pAULA–?lmo0364, the cells were grown at a non 

permissive temperature (42 ?C) on BHI plates containing erythromycin (5 µg/mL). Colonies 

containing the integrated plasmid were grown for eight days at a permissive temperature (30 

?C) without antibiotics, allowing the plasmid excision from the chromosome and its loss from 

the cell, thus allowing the excision of gene lmo0364 from the chromosome (schematic 

representation of gene deletion in Appendix 3). Finally, to confirm that the gene was deleted 

from the chromosome, the lmo0364 region was amplified in wild-type and mutant strain DNA 

following sequencing using primers PC1_lmo0364 and PC2_lmo0364 (Appendix 1). 

 

2.5. Preparation of total RNA 

Overnight cultures of L. monocytogenes strains were diluted to an A600 = 0.02 in BHI 

(corresponding to time 0) and grown at 37 ?C. At various time points (3, 4.5, 6 and 8 hours) 

20 mL samples of the growing cultures were shortly cooled in liquid nitrogen (N2) and the 

cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 g for 3 min at 4 ?C, snap frozen in liquid 



Materials and Methods

nitrogen and stored at -80 ?C. The cells were resuspended in 900 µL TRI reagent 

(MRCGENE, USA) and lysed using a FastPrep instrument. RNA was subsequently extracted 

using chloroform and precipitated with ethanol and sodium acetate, overnight at -80 ?C. The 

samples were centrifuged at 20000 g for 30 min at 4 ?C, washed with 70% ethanol (-20 ?C) 

and resuspended in 50 µL Milli-Q water.  

The RNA quality and quantification was assessed on a NanoDrop 2000. The integrity and the 

predicted concentration of the RNA was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis (1% 

agarose). 

 

2.6. Northern blot analysis 

For Northern blotting, loading buffer (95% formamide and 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% BPB and 

0.05% xylene cyanol) was added to 10 µg of total RNA and samples were boiled at 95 ?C for 

3 min (to denaturate the RNA) and immediately cooled on ice. The total RNA was separated 

on a 4% polyacrylamide-7M urea gel and transferred to a Zeta probe nylon membrane (Bio-

Rad, USA) by semi-dry electroblotting at 400 mA for 2 hours. 

For detection of RNA, the membranes were pre-incubated for 30 min at 42 ?C in PerfectHyb 

hybridization buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and hybridized with a specific 
32

P-labelled DNA 

probe, prepared using poly nucleotide kinase (PNK) (Fermentas, Canada) and ?-[
32

P]-ATP 

(PerkinElmer, USA). The membranes were then washed with a 2X saline-sodium citrate 

(SSC), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution for 5 min and a 0.5X SSC, 0.1% SDS 

solution for 20 min, both at 42 ?C, and finally visualized by phosphor imaging using a 

Typhoon scanner.    

 

2.7. Transcriptional fusions 

The promoter regions of lmo0361, lmo0362, lmo0363, lmo0364 and lmo0365-lmo0367, 

respectively (see Figure 4 in the Introdution, section 1.3.) were amplified from L. 

monocytogenes EGDe chromosomal DNA under standard PCR conditions using Phusion 

polymerase (Finnzymes, Finland) with primers listed in Appendix 2. The resulting products of 

approximately 200 bp were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned in the low copy-

number plasmid pTCV-lac (Appendix 2). The construction was confirmed by sequencing with 

primers vLac1 and vLac2 (Appendix 1). 

The constructed plamids, pTCV-lmo0361, pTCV-lmo0362, pTCV-lmo0363, pTCV-lmo0364 

and pTCV-lmo0365 were each one electroporated into L. monocytogenes EGDe, ?lmo0361

2.8. Beta-galactosidase assay 

Strains for testing ?-galactosidase activity were diluted from an overnight culture to an 

A600=0.02 in BHI. At different growth times (3, 4, 5, 7 and 24 hours) 1 mL of each sample 

were collected by centrifugation at 14000 g for 4 min, thoroughly aspirated, frozen and stored 

at -80 ?C until use. For the assay, the pelleted cells were thawn on ice and resuspended in 1 

mL Z-buffer (60 mM Na2HPO4, 40 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, pH 7.0). Cells 

were permeabilized by adding 0.5 % toluene and 4.5 % ethanol, vortexing after each 

addition. From the permeabilized cell suspension, 100 µL was mixed with 400 µL of Ortho-

nitrophenyl-?-galactosidase (ONPG) solution (1 mg/mL ONPG, 0.075 % SDS dissolved in Z-

buffer) and incubated at 37 ?C until the samples present a yellow colour (A420 ? 0.6 - 0.9). 

When this colour was reached, the reaction was stopped by addition of 500 µL of 1 M 

Na2CO3.  

The ?-galactosidase activity was determined as described by Miller (49), using the equation: 

                                             
              

        
 ,  

where t is the time of reaction in minutes, v is the volume of culture used in the assay (mL), 

A420 and A550 is the absorbance of the ? –galactosidase sample at 420 nm and 550 nm, 

respectively, and A600 is the absorbance of the cell culture when harvested. 

Strains carrying an empty vector were also subjected to ?-galactosidase measurements and 

this background activity was subtracted of the obtained data. 

 

2.9. Secreted protein analysis 

2.9.1. Bacterial cultures 

L. monocytogenes strains were cultured overnight at 37 ?C on TSA-YE. A single isolated 

colonie was suspended in 25 mL of minimal medium MWB (46) and incubated overnight at 

37 ?C with shaking. Overnight cultures were adjusted to an A600 = 0.05 using fresh MWB and 

grown at the same conditions used before (37 ?C with shaking) for about 20 hours. The cells 

were harvested at exponential phase (A600 ? 0.8) by centrifugation (3 000 g, 10 min, 4 ?C). 

The obtained supernatants were filtered with 0.22 µm Millipore Express Membranes and 

phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mM (29).

2.9.2. Protein precipitation 

The proteins present in the supernatants were precipitated with 0.2 mg/mL sodium 

deoxycholate (DOC) for 30 min at 4 ?C, followed by addition of 6 % (w/v) trichloroacetic acid 

(TCA) and overnight incubation at 4 ?C. The precipitate was centrifuged (17 900 g, 15 min, 4 

?C), washed with ice-cold acetone and resuspended in Milli-Q water. 

 

2.9.3. Protein quantification  

Protein concentration was determined by a modified Lowry method (50) using the bovine 

serum albumin (BSA) as standard. 

 

2.9.4. SDS-PAGE 

Samples containing 50 µg of total protein were dissolved in sample buffer: 80 mM Tris-HCl, 

pH 6.8, containing 2 % (w/v) SDS, 0.1 mM ?-mercaptoethanol, 15 % glycerol and 0.01 % 

(w/v) m-cresol purple. Samples were then heated at 100 ?C for 4 min and submitted to SDS-

PAGE 15 % (w/v) in gels with 8 cm x 7.3 cm x 0.75 mm, on a Mini-PROTEAN 3 Cell (Bio-

Rad, USA). 

Separated proteins were visualized by colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 staining (51). 

Apparent masses were calculated based on the molecular masses of standard LPM (14 to 

66 kDa) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). 

 

2.10. In vitro test of virulence 

2.10.1. Cell line and culture conditions 

The human adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29 (ECACC n.º 850611109) was used between 

passages 62 and 64. Cells were routinely grown in 75 cm
2
 flasks in high glucose Dulbecco’s 

modified Eagle’s medium (D-MEM) (Gibco/Invitrogen, UK), supplemented with sodium 

bicarbonate (3.7 g/L), fetal calf serum (10% (v/v)) and L-glutamine (2mM) (complete 

medium). Penicillin (100 IU/mL) and streptomycin (100 µg/mL) were always added to the 

culture medium except for the medium used 24 hours prior to the virulence assays. Cells 

were maintained in a humidified atmosphere using an incubator at 37 ?C under 5% (v/v) CO2 

in air.

 cells were deposited per well 

in a 96-well tissue culture plate. To obtain confluent monolayers, the plates were incubated 

for 3 days with antibiotics followed by incubation for 24 h without antibiotics.

plating of the appropriate dilutions onto TSA-YE and incubation at 37 ?C for 24 h, before 

counting colonies.  

After 2 h incubation with the bacterial cells, the suspensions were removed and cell 

monolayers were incubated for 1.5 h with complete D-MEM medium containing 100 µg 

gentamicin mL

, and lacking penicillin and streptomycin. The wells were then covered with 

complete D-MEM medium supplemented with 10 µg gentamicin mL

 and 2.5 % (m/v) 

agarose. Once the agar media was solidified, complete medium was added to the top of the 

agar media to prevent cell starvation. Culture plates were incubated for 24 to 48 h at 37 ?C 

under 5 % (v/v) CO2 in air. Formed plaques were counted 24 h after bacteria deposition on 

the HT-29 cell monolayer, and confirmed after 48 h of incubation. Enumeration of the 

plaques was done using an inverted microscope (52) (53).  

 

2.11. In vivo test of virulence 

To test the in vivo pathogenicity by subcutaneous injection (50 µL) of the wild-type and the 

mutants, seven-week-old immunocompetent Swiss female mice were used (54). They were 

maintained on sterilized wood shavings with free access to water and sterilized food. For 

each isolate, groups of five mice were inoculated subcutaneously into the left hind footpad. 

Bacterial strains were grown on BHI plates for 17 hours at 37 ?C. The culture was 

standardized turbidimetrically and diluted appropriately in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 

pH 7.3) to obtain 4 log CFU (colony forming unit) in 50 µL for subcutaneous infection. The 

inocula used were verified by determining viable counts on TSA (Trypic Soy Agar) plates.  

Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation three days after subcutaneous injection and 

spleens were aseptically removed. Homogenate samples were appropriately diluted in PBS 

and plated onto TSA plates. Viable numbers of bacteria were assessed after incubation at 37

2.12. Expression of results and data analysis  

For SDS-PAGE gels, the images were analyzed and band quantification was done using the 

densitometric curves obtained in the Gel Compare II version 5.1 (Applied Maths, Belgium).  

For the ?-galatosidase assay, the promoter activities were expressed as the mean of ?-

galactosidase units, from experiments done in duplicate, from three independent trials. The 

standard deviation was also assessed and it is shown in the graphic representations of 

promoter activities. 

For the in vitro test, the pathogenic potential of the isolates was expressed as the mean log 

of the number of plaques formed (for 10

 Listeria per well) (log PFA), in duplicate, from at 

least two independent trials. ANOVA of the log PFA values from the plaque-forming isolates 

was carried out using least significant differences (LSD) post hoc multiple comparison tests 

by running the program Statistica, version 6 (Statsoft). 

For the mouse virulence assay, the virulence potential of the isolates was expressed as the 

mean log of the number of colony forming units (log CFU) per spleen, multiplied by the ratio 

of number of positive cultures in the spleen to inoculated mice in the subcutaneous infection 

test. The significant differences between strains were assessed using the log CFU mean and 

the standard deviations by applying a t-test.  

Those values whose probability of occurrence was greater than 95 % (p &amp;lt;0.05) were 

considered as significant values.

3.1. Deletion mutant for the Tat pathway 

To investigate the importance of the Tat pathway in L. monocytogenes, a deletion mutant for 

the genes coding for this system was constructed as described before in section 2.3.1. The 

confirmation of the deletion of the genes was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 

using internal primers for the genes lmo0361 (tatA) and lmo0362 (tatC) as well as the 

primers Tat_A and Tat_D, used in the production of the homologous fragment for gene 

replacement (for primers sequence see Appendix 1). As a PCR control, internal primers for 

the L. monocytogenes iap gene were used.  

The mutant strain showed a ~2000 bp band, the same size as the constructed plasmid 

(Figure 6), which represents ~1000 bp upstream lmo0362 and ~1000 bp downstream 

lmo0361. The wild-type strain EGDe presented a ~3000 bp band. The difference between 

the mutant and the wild-type was explained by the deletion of tatA and tatC (911 bp) (Figure 

6). The amplification done using the internal primers for the genes lmo0361 (tatC) and 

lmo0362 (tatA) resulted in no bands for the mutant and a band of ~200 bp for the wild-type 

strain, as expected.

In order to investigate if the deletion of tatAC genes was impairing for mutant growth, the 

mutant strain and the wild-type were grown in BHI at 37 ?C (Figure 7) and growth rates (µmax) 

were calculated. The wild-type showed a µmax = 1.26 h

3.2. Transcriptional analysis 

3.2.1. Northern blot 

The transcription of the genes lmo0361 (tatC) and lmo0362 (tatA) was analyzed during the 

exponential and stationary phase. The total RNA was analyzed by Northern blot, by using 

probes for genes lmo0361, lmo0362, lmo0363 and a control probe for 16S rRNA gene 

(Appendix 1). The genes lmo0361 and lmo0362 presented the same pattern of expression 

(Figure 8). The same RNA was observed with both probes indicating that genes lmo0361 

and lmo0362 are transcribed in a bicistronic manner. The transcription of tatAC genes was 

growth-phase dependent, since it seemed to be less expressed in the stationary phase, in 

comparison to the exponential phase, as shown in Figure 8. As expected, no transcripts were 

detected in the deletion mutant. 

Proteins exported by the Tat pathway have a conserved N-terminus motif which is cleaved 

when the protein is secreted. The gene lmo0363 upstream the genes coding for the Tat 

pathway codes for a peptidase and it is located just 96 bp from lmo0362 (see Figure 4 in 

section 1.3.). To investigate if gene lmo0363 is transcribed together with genes lmo0362 and

lmo0361 a Northern blot analysis for this gene was also performed (Figure 8). Transcripts of 

the lmo0363 were practically undetectable and showed to be transcribed independently from 

lmo0362 and lmo0361.  

 

 

Figure  8 – Northern blot analysis of lmo0361, lmo0362 and lmo0363 transcripts in wild-type 
and tatAC mutant strain. RNA was isolated from both strains at different times of growth (3.5, 5, 
6 and 8 hours, signed with an arrow in growth curve), corresponding to the exponential and 
stationary phases. 

 

The locus for lmo0361 and lmo0362 in L. monocytogenes EGDe (serovar 1/2a) is similar to a 

locus present in the nonpathogenic L. innocua, but it is absent in the genome of the L. 

monocytogenes F2365 (serovar 4b) (55).  

Between the genes coding for the secretion system and the operon containing the gene for 

the secreted protein, there is a gene coding for a transcription regulator (lmo0364) (see 

Figure 4 in section 1.3.).  

To address the possible involvement of this transcription regulator in transcription regulation 

of genes tatA and tatC, a new transcription analysis was performed. For that a deletion 

mutant in this gene was also constructed. In the deletion mutant, the resulting protein lacks in 

the N-terminal, including the DNA-binding domain, 247 amino acids, out of 313 that 

constitute Lmo0364.  

The results in Figure 9 show that the lmo0364 gene product has no influence in the 

transcription of tatA and tatC, since no difference between the mutant and the wild-type 

strain was detected.

3.2.2. Promoter activity 

The promoter activity of the genes lmo0361, lmo0362, lmo0363, lmo0364 and of the operon 

lmo0365-67 was analyzed for the wild-type strain using a ?-galactosidase assay.  

Interestingly, the promoters showed different levels of activity, with lmo0362 being the most 

active promoter, followed by the operon lmo0365-67 promoter (Figure 10). Although 

transcripts of the gene lmo0363 were undetectable in the Northern blot, promoter activity was 

low but recorded. Even much lower than the activity of the lmo0362 and lmo0365 promoters, 

the transcription regulator lmo0364 also showed promoter activity (Figure 10). The promoter 

of lmo0361 gene showed no promoter activity when compared to the empty plasmid 

demonstrating once more that this gene is not transcribed on its own but in a bicistronic 

transcript with lmo0362.

The lmo0362 transcript level showed to be growth-phase dependent in the Northern blot 

analysis, being the gene less expressed during the stationary phase. The promoter activity 

was investigated at different time points during culture growth (Figure 11). The promoter 

activity of the lmo0362 gene showed an increased activity during exponential phase, followed 

by a decrease during the stationary phase.

In order to investigate if the transcription regulator (Lmo0364) was related to the transcription

by the Tat pathway (25), and to confirm the result from the Northern blot for lmo0362, the 

promoter activity of lmo0362 and lmo0365 (Figure 12 A and B, respectively) was assessed in 

the wild-type and the deletion mutants ?tatAC and ?lmo0364.

No differences were found among the wild-type and the mutant strains both for the activities 

of lmo0362 and lmo0365-67 promoters, indicating that there is not a direct relationship 

between the transcription regulator Lmo0364 and the promoter activities of the genes 

lmo0362 and lmo0365-67.  

The results obtained for the activity of lmo0362 promoter (Figure 12A) also indicate that the 

presence of this secretion system and the promoter activity of the corresponding genes are 

not related. The same could be verified for the lmo0365-67 operon. This operon hosts the 

gene coding for the protein putatively secreted by the Tat pathway. Nevertheless, the 

promoter activity of the operon was not different in the Tat pathway mutant. 

To confirm that the transcriptional regulator was not associated to the transcription of the 

genes studied and that the results were not disguised by a down regulation of its 

transcription in the growing conditions used, the promoter activity of the lmo0364 was also 

assessed. No differences were found among strains (Figure 13) or time points during growth 

(data not shown). Finally, the influence of Lmo0364 in the promoter activity of lmo0363 gene 

was also investigated. The obtained results (not shown) also indicated the absence of 

differences between the wild-type and ?lmo0364 mutant strains.

3.3. Proteomic analysis 

3.3.1. SDS-PAGE analysis of secreted proteins 

The hypothesis that L. monocytogenes has a secretion system (Tat pathway) that secretes 

only a single protein was predicted in silico (25).  

In order to investigate this hypothesis, the secretome of L. monocytogenes, grown in minimal 

medium at both 20 and 37 ?C (the saprophytic and infectious temperatures, respectively) was 

analyzed for differences in the presence or absence of proteins in SDS-PAGE gels (Figure 

14). This preliminary analysis showed no relevant differences between the wild-type strain 

and the tatAC mutant. The protein predicted to be secreted by the Tat pathway (Lmo0364) 

should present approximately 40 kDa. No identifiable change between the mutant and the 

wild-type strain protein patterns was observed at this range size or at any other range sizes 

(Figure 14). 

At 20 ?C, the most intense band (between 29 and 36 kDa, marked with an arrow) is thicker in 

the mutant compared to the wild-type. Its relative amount was assessed using Gel Compare 

II version 5.1 (Applied Maths, Belgium), showing that there was a relatively higher amount 

(1.3 times) in the ?tatAC mutant when compared with EGDe wild-type. By comparison with 

previously identified bands from other strains of the same serovar 1/2a (data not published), 

this could be flagellin, the main constituent of the flagellar filament.

3.4. Phenotypical analysis   

3.4.1. In vitro virulence 

The importance of the secretion systems in virulence is related with the fact that the bacterial 

virulence depends on the ability to secrete virulence factors. To assess if the absence of the 

Tat pathway influenced the infectious ability of the tatAC mutant, plaque forming assays 

(PFAs) were performed (Table 3). These assays allow the evaluation, not only of the 

adhesion of the bacteria to the epithelial cells, but also its ability to internalize, multiply inside 

the host cell and migrate from one cell to another.

26 
 

Strain EGDe (wild-type) is generally used as a reference for virulent strain, whereas strain 

442 is used as reference for low virulence (42). 

The deletion mutant for the Tat pathway did not show alteration in the PFA assay results 

when compared to the wild type strain, demonstrating that this secretion system is not 

essential for the infectious steps analyzed by the PFA, specifically adhesion, internalization, 

multiplication and cell to cell spread.  

 

3.4.2. In vivo virulence 

Although in vitro results are a good methodology for the evaluation of some steps of the 

infectious cycle, when using animal models the whole process of infection is much more 

complex and more challenging for the bacteria.  

The Tat pathway has been described as responsible for the secretion of an iron dependent 

dyp-peroxidase (product of gene lmo0367), and iron is one of the key factors for 

pathogenesis. The pathogens need to keep the iron under a strict regulation and, therefore, 

an in vivo study of virulence was performed for the wild type and the deletion mutants ?tatAC 

and ?lmo0364 (Table 4).

mutant.

4. Discussion  

4.1. The Tat pathway in Listeria monocytogenes 

In the present study, a L. monocytogenes mutant strain lacking the genes coding for the Tat 

pathway was successfully constructed (EGDe ?tatAC). Like the parent strain, the mutant 

showed the ability to grow, in both complete and minimal medium, comfirming that the Tat 

pathway is not essential for L. monocytogenes survival. 

For other species, it has been reported that the tat genes are organized in an operon, but, to 

our knowledge, this is the first time that it is experimentally demonstrated that lmo0361 (tatC) 

and lmo0362 (tatA) genes in L. monocytogenes are co-transcribed in a bicistronic and 

growth-phase dependent manner. Transcription of these genes occurs rather in the early 

exponential phase, being down regulated in the stationary phase. This was confirmed by 

Northern blot analysis and by the promoter activity determination of lmo0362 and the null 

activity found for lmo0361 supposed promoter region. Even though transcription of the genes 

was shown, the Tat pathway functionality still remains to be elucidated.  

Previous studies showed that the genes coding for this secretion system were under the 

negative regulation of CtsR, a transcriptional repressor of class III stress response genes, 

and ?
B
, an alternative sigma factor that positively regulates the transcription of class II stress 

response genes (56). It has also been shown that Fur, a regulator of iron acquisition 

systems, was responsible for down regulation of the tatAC genes (40). 

The growth-phase dependent transcription observed for tatA and tatC is similar to the one 

described for the fri gene, which codes for a ferritin-like protein and is under the direct 

regulation of Fur (57).  Even though the tat genes may be under direct or indirect regulation 

by different proteins, its transcription pattern, similar to the fri gene, suggests a participation 

of Fur in the observed down regulation.  

Fur has been studied and some direct interactions between Fur and several promoter 

regions were identified (fur boxes). For some repression activities, Fur binding to fur boxes 

has been shown to be iron dependent, but iron independent when binding different fur boxes 

promoters (40). The pathways involved in this mechanism are still unclear.  

While transcription of tatAC showed to be growth-phase dependent by Northern blot 

analysis, this was not evident when promoter activity was assessed, even though a slight 

decrease of activity was observed in the stationary phase. This can be explained by the 

absence of the CtsR binding site previously identified for tatA promoter region in L. 

monocytogenes (56). CtsR binding site is located around 270 bp upstream the starting codon

of tatA (56), in the coding region of lmo0363, and was absent in the construction used for 

promoter activity determination. Furthermore, its distance from the starting site of tatAC, as 

well as the verification of promoter activity 152 bp upstream of the coding region and its 

down regulation in the stationary phase, seem to be indicative of the independence of direct 

regulation by CtsR at the locus previously identified. The down regulation verified in the 

promoter activity in the stationary phase can then be attributed to other regulators of these 

genes. The lower level of transcripts in the stationary phase can also be explained by a pos-

transcriptional regulation, such as mRNA degradation. 

The results obtained in this work with the wild-type and the ?tatAC mutant transformed with 

the lmo0362 promoter region, combined with the Northern blot analysis for tatAC genes, 

suggest that tatAC expression is not regulated by the level of their product, showing the 

same promoter activity and level of transcripts both in the wild-type and in the mutant strain. 

Previously in silico analysis (25) pointed to a 40 kDa protein secreted by the Tat pathway. 

The SDS-PAGE analysis of L. monocytogenes secretome did not show differences between 

the EGDe wild-type and the ?tatAC mutant, although it does not mean that the protein was 

not present. It could be present in undetectable levels by the method used. FLAG-tag 

methodology (58) is an alternative methodology that could be used to assess the presence of 

the protein both in the supernatant and in the cytoplasm, with a higher detection capability. 

For the observed intensity difference of bands possibly corresponding to flagellin (Figure 

14B), no plausible explanation was found, although a CtsR mutant was described in L. 

monocytogenes as having reduced flaA transcription and FlaA expression (59), showing that 

the repressor CtsR appears somehow connected to both flaA and tatAC. Further 

experimental studies will be needed in order to prove the involvement of the Tat pathway in 

the secretion of Lmo0367 and to identify other proteins possibly secreted by this system. 

Considering strains virulence ability, the presence of Tat pathway showed to be irrelevant for 

in vitro virulence, but significant differences were found when in vivo virulence was assessed. 

Surprisingly, the differences verified in vivo showed that the tat mutant was significantly more 

virulent (p &amp;lt;0.05) than the wild-type strain. This result was unexpected as the only protein 

considered as secreted by the Tat pathway, Lmo0367, is a peroxidase, pointed by some 

authors as a possible new major virulence factor (25). This protein should be important in the 

host environment, where oxidative stress due to release of reactive oxygen intermediates 

takes place (60). It is also interesting to notice an increase of in vivo virulence of tat mutants, 

as serovar 4b strains, which are usually more involved in clinical cases, appear to be lacking 

the genes coding either for the Tat pathway and the lmo0365-67 operon (55). This may 

indicate that, instead of being useful and necessary for virulence, the Tat pathway and

possibly the iron-dependent peroxidase Lmo0367 might be, on the other hand, impairing 

virulence.  

 

4.2. The lmo0365-67 operon  

A first reported in silico analysis identified two proteins secreted via Tat pathway: Lmo0367 

and Lmo2201 (24). Recently, another study reported that Lmo2201 was most certainly a 50S 

ribosomal protein L35 and, therefore, it could not be secreted. Thus, only the protein 

Lmo0367 is considered to be secreted by this secretion system (25). The gene coding for 

this protein is part of an operon where lmo0365 and lmo0366 are also present (40). These 

three genes are related to iron, as lmo0365 and lmo0366 code for a transporter and a 

lipoprotein, respectively, both involved in iron transport, while lmo0367 codes, as already 

mentioned, for an iron-dependent peroxidase.  

A similar operon was identified in Staphylococcus spp., where a peroxidase (FepB), similar 

to Lmo0367, was demonstrated to be secreted by the Tat pathway. In S. aureus, tatAC 

genes are right downstream the iron-operon, similar to lmo0365-67 (26). Although the 

proteins encoded in the operon are similar to those found in Listeria, their organization is 

different, raising once again the question of its origin, since it has been shown that this 

secretion system is also present only in some Staphylococcus species. Biswas et al. (26) 

support the possibility that, in Staphylococcus, the cluster holding the genes tat and the iron-

related operon have phage origin and therefore the phage would probably be the 

transmission vector among different species (26). This hypothesis was based on the fact that 

it was identified a gene coding for a protein similar to a phage envelop protein, immediately 

upstream of tatA.  

Here we demonstrated that the promoter of this operon has a strong activity, although less 

strong than the one observed for the tat genes. Moreover, our results show that there is no 

influence in promoter activity when the tat genes or the lmo0364 were deleted from the 

genome. It might be possible that there is no relation between the presence of the secretion 

system and the transcription of the operon where the putative secreted protein is coded, 

raising the question about what might happen to the transcript of lmo0367 in the tatAC 

mutant. Is the mRNA or the protein degraded? Is it possible that the Lmo0367 is secreted 

through another system or does it accumulates inside the cell? These questions can only be 

answered by performing a more detailed study on the protein Lmo0367. 

Similarly to what has been shown to tatAC genes by Ledala et al. (40), the lmo0365-67 

operon is also under the negative regulation of Fur. The fur gene has been shown to be 

expressed in the presence of iron and significantly repressed in the absence of the same

metal (40). However the transcriptional in vivo study developed by Camejo et al. (61) showed 

that both fur and lmo0366 were highly upregulated in vivo (61), presenting some 

inconsistency in the predicted mechanisms of regulation. It is also interesting to notice that if 

free iron is present in almost negligible concentrations in vivo (57), the fur gene should then 

be repressed or, at least, not upregulated, as it will repress some genes responsible for iron 

acquisition (40) (57). This reinforces the hypothesis that the regulation by Fur is far from 

being understood and that it might be a complex sensor/regulator pathway instead of a 

negative regulation by binding of Fur to a fur box in the promoter region. 

 

4.3. Transcriptional Regulator Lmo0364 

The locus from gene lmo0361 to lmo0367 is a conserved locus also present in L. innocua. 

Genes lmo0361 and lmo0362 seem to be related to lmo0367, since the first two code for the 

translocation system responsible for the secretion of the product of the last one. In the same 

locus, gene lmo0364, coding for a transcriptional regulator required further study. Besides its 

particular location, the lmo0364 proved not to be related to the other genes in the locus, as it 

is not involved in the transcription regulation of any of the genes studied. Interestingly, L. 

monocytogenes serovar 4b appears to have genes homologous to lmo0363 and lmo0364, 

lacking the two operons surrounding these genes.  

Considering the loss or acquisition of operons lmo0361-62 and lmo0365-67, depending on 

the evolutionary moments of serovar divergence, it is interesting to notice that it happened in 

two different places, although close to each other. The G+C content in these two loci is 

between 36 and 41%, similar to the content determined for Listeria species (38%). This may 

suggest their lost at some point along the species divergence. According to Doumith et al. 

(62), serovar 1/2a diverged from serovar 4b and L. innocua, being these last two evolutionary 

closer than to the serovar 1/2a. This may indicates that, serovar 4b has lost the genes 

lmo0361-62 and lmo0365-67, present in both serovar 1/2a and in L. innocua.  

Our results show that the transcription regulator Lmo0364 did not influence L. 

monocytogenes growth or in vivo virulence, pointing that probably it is not related to key 

virulence genes. Actually, when a protein BLAST (BLASTp, NCBI) was performed, 96% 

similarity was found between this transcriptional regulator and the DeoR regulator from E. 

coli. The E.coli family of DeoR regulators includes at least 14 members and they usually act 

as repressors in sugar metabolism (63). The Lmo0364 could then be related to L. 

monocytogenes sugar metabolism and not to the studied iron related operons. Either way, 

we showed that it might be transcribed when cells are grown in rich medium, since promoter 

activity was reported for lmo0364 for both exponential and stationary phases.

Figure 3. 1. Schematic representation of a two step procedure used to obtain gene deletion by 
recombination.  

Areas labeled A and B represent DNA sequences located upstream and downstream from 
gene. The crossed lines indicate crossover events. The first step is integration of the vector via 
homologous sequences, it can take place in area A or B. Depending on whether the second 
recombination event occurs between the two homologous sequences in area A or B, the gene 
will either remain in the chromosome (area A) or be excised along with the vector (area B). 
Gene deletion occurs only if the second recombination event occurs in area B, as shown.
