ABSTRACT 
 

 

BONÁCUL RODRIGUES, Guilherme. State Immunity and Human Rights Before 

National and International Courts. 2016. 239 p. Master’s Dissertation — Faculty of 

Law, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, 2016.   

 

State immunity has undergone major changes over time and is still a highly controversial 

and hotly debated topic. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between human 

rights and the norms governing state immunity. Located in different geological strata of 

international law, the clashes between the law of state immunity and human rights drew 

attention to the struggle among competing conceptions of international law. On one hand, 

being commonly linked to the principle of sovereign equality and to the need for stability 

in international relations, state immunity operates when a domestic court cannot exercise 

jurisdiction over the subject matter of a dispute because one of the parties is a foreign state. 

On the other, human rights have a different logic and require change and the realization of 

justice. The development of the body of human rights law allowed to call into question the 

grant of state immunity in cases in which human rights norms were violated. Legal 

questions arising from the relationship between state immunity and human rights have 

been put before domestic and international courts. Having examined the various judgments 

dealing with these issues, this study contends that the answers to the technical and 

dogmatic questions originating from the encounter between state immunity and human 

rights reproduce theoretical conflicts which happen—to use Koskenniemi’s expression—at 

a ‘higher level of abstraction’. The ICJ’s judgment in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State 

may have crystallized a consensus according to which state immunity trumps the 

individual’s right to reparation for serious violations of human rights. This consensus, 

however, is contingent and can be questioned through the language of international law.  

 

Keywords: state immunity; human rights; international legal argumentation; international 

legal theory.  

 

 



 

RESUMO 
 

 

BONÁCUL RODRIGUES, Guilherme. Imunidade Estatal e Direitos Humanos Perante 

Cortes Nacionais e Internacionais. 2016. 239 f. Dissertação (Mestrado) — Faculdade de 

Direito, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, 2016.  

 

A imunidade estatal passou por grandes mudanças através dos tempos e ainda é um tema 

controverso e bastante debatido. A proposta deste estudo foi investigar a relação entre os 

direitos humanos e as normas que governam a imunidade estatal. Estando em camadas 

geológicas diferentes do direito internacional, os choques entre o direito da imunidade 

estatal e os direitos humanos chamaram atenção para a disputa entre concepções 

conflitantes de direito internacional. De um lado, sendo comumente relacionada ao 

princípio da igualdade soberana e à necessidade de estabilidade nas relações 

internacionais, a imunidade estatal opera quando uma corte não pode exercer jurisdição 

sobre o objeto de uma disputa em razão de uma das partes ser um estado estrangeiro. De 

outro, os direitos humanos têm uma lógica diferente e requerem mudança e a realização da 

justiça. O desenvolvimento do corpo dos direitos humanos permitiu questionar a concessão 

de imunidade estatal em casos em que normas de direitos humanos foram violadas. 

Questões jurídicas originadas do relacionamento entre imunidade estatal e direitos 

humanos foram levadas a várias cortes domésticas e internacionais. Tendo sido realizado o 

exame dos vários casos lidando com esse assunto, este estudo argumenta que as respostas 

para as questões técnicas e dogmáticas originadas do encontro entre imunidade de 

jurisdição e direitos humanos reproduzem conflitos teóricos que ocorrem—na expressão de 

Koskenniemi—em um ‘nível mais elevado de abstração.’ O julgamento da Corte 

Internacional de Justiça em Imunidades de Jurisdição do Estado pode ter cristalizado um 

consenso segundo o qual as normas que se relacionam com a imunidade estatal prevalecem 

sobre o direito individual de reparação por sérias violações de direitos humanos. Tal 

consenso, no entanto, é contingente e pode ser questionado por meio da linguagem do 

direito internacional. 

 

Palavras-chave: imunidade estatal; direitos humanos; argumentação em direito 

internacional; teoria do direito internacional.

1 — INTRODUCTION 
 

 

 

 

 

‘… [Q]uite apart from the elucidation of the applicable rules of State immunity, the 

doctrine provides a valuable case study of the present nature of the international 

community … A study of State immunity directs attention to the central issues of the 

international legal system.’

1.1 Proposal: a case study in international legal argumentation focusing on the 

relationship between state immunity and human rights  

  

The initial intuition that inspired this research was that the study of the discourses 

on the relationship between, on one side, state immunity, and, on the other, human rights 

and jus cogens could deepen the understanding of how international legal argumentation 

works. The encounter of these very different branches of international law sheds light on a 

tension that does not relate solely to the normative conflicts with which international law 

theorists and practitioners are very familiar, but also to the foundational discourses of the 

discipline. 

State immunity is, of course, traditionally deemed a consequence of the principle of 

sovereign equality and an expression of the maxim par in parem non habet imperium and 

variations thereof.1 Its aims are usually considered to be the promotion of stability, of

International Law (6th edn, OUP 2007) 174-178 and 184-185.

comity and of good relations between states.2 On the other hand, human rights and jus 

cogens operate with a different logic, by according priority to the realization of justice.3 

When one may trump the operation of the other, choices have to be made. Technical legal 

discussions and dogmatics will often disguise these choices, which are related to the more 

crucial issue of foundations. The answers to seemingly technical legal question are 

dependent on the conception one has of international law—they hide theoretical conflicts 

about what international law is and about how to find it out.4 In other words, these 

questions do not have objectively ascertainable answers. These answers will have different 

degrees of persuasiveness, which depend not only on their intrinsic characteristics, such as 

internal coherence, but also on other factors, such as the biases and assumptions of the 

audience.5  

This study, therefore, does not presuppose there are correct answers to the various 

legal questions arising from the relationship between state immunity and human rights.6 

Accordingly, I will not try to point out allegedly correct solutions to these questions.  

Legal dogmatics has a central role in the research I propose to undertake. Through 

an analysis of the various judicial decisions dealing with the relationship between state 

immunity and human rights, I will try to identify the argumentative patterns, strategies and 

approaches of this legal debate. My aim is to recognize the theoretical conceptions of 

international law upon which these arguments and doctrines are founded. By doing it, I 

seek to demonstrate that the hegemonic outcome privileging state immunity over human 

rights can be questioned through the language of international law. As Koskenniemi 

argued, the theories that justify different interpretative constructions are external to the 

rules and to the facts themselves: there is not a theory which could ultimately solve

‘O direito internacional de coexistência compreendia, essencialmente, normas negativas, de 
caráter proibitivo, como a que veda a intervenção em um Estado estrangeiro. Corolário da 
soberania, a não intervenção é um dos pilares da ordem internacional de Westfália, retrato da 
consolidação do poder estatal. 
‘O direito internacional de cooperação e o direito internacional de solidariedade reúnem 
normas positivas, comandos que se resumem a prescrever ações ao invés de opor omissões. 
Desejam mudança mais do que a estabilidade ao definir comportamentos, estipular metas e ao 
distribuir custos e benefícios. …’

interpretative problems, and that is a fundamental condition of international legal practice.7 

And, indeed, as put by David Kennedy, international law is a ‘practice of interminable 

discourse’.8 

The present study is concerned with the immunity ratione personae of the state 

itself. There are other types of immunities, such as the immunity ratione materiae of state 

officials, the immunity ratione personae of heads of state, heads of government and 

foreign ministers, diplomatic and consular immunities, the immunities of international 

organizations and their officials etc. All these other immunities are governed by their own 

rules and principles and may also raise human rights issues. Nevertheless, for the purposes 

of this monograph, it was decided to focus on the immunity of the state itself.  

 

1.2 Problem statement 

 

The main questions underlying the research I propose to undertake are the 

following:  

 

1) What is the impact of human rights on the law of state immunity and how has this 

issue been dealt with dogmatically in domestic and international courts and in 

scholarly writings on the subject?  

 

2) What do the different answers to the problems arising from the relationship between 

state immunity and human rights reveal about the current competing theoretical 

conceptions of international law and about the practice of international legal 

argumentation?  

 

1.3 Argument  

 

When dealing with questions arising from the relationship between state immunity 

and human rights, domestic and international courts are faced with numerous questions. 

They have to decide whether state immunity is enshrined in customary international law or 

is only an expression of comity. The basis of state immunity as a rule of law and the

International Law: An Introduction (BIICL 1991) 44.

principles governing it have to be ascertained. The legal nature of acts performed by states 

has to be determined. Courts have to consider whether violations of international human 

rights law and international humanitarian law fit the dichotomy between acta jure imperii 

and acta jure gestionis or if it is the case that this distinction is immaterial in human rights 

cases. They have to decide whether an exception to state immunity in respect of torts 

committed in the forum state crystallized into a customary international rule. Courts will 

also have to determine how the law of state immunity interacts with jus cogens norms. 

They will have to investigate if the violation of a jus cogens norm may be interpreted as a 

tacit waiver of the right to immunity. Issues of normative hierarchy will also arise. The 

question of whether jus cogens norms take precedence over the rules relating to state 

immunity will have to be answered. The problem of conflicting norms will also appear and 

courts will have to determine whether the grant of state immunity can be considered a 

violation of the individual’s right of access to court. The list goes on.  

The answers to these problems depend on theoretical assumptions about the nature 

of international law. These theoretical assumptions incorporate choices, which will also 

lead to different attitudes towards the ascertainment of the law and towards the role of the 

interpreter and of the institution in charge of applying the law. The answers provided are 

contingent and remain open to contestation. Following the decision of the ICJ in 

Jurisdictional Immunities of the State, it seems that the hegemonic view of the relationship 

between state immunity and human rights privileges the former to the detriment of the 

latter. Nevertheless, this is an outcome open to contestation through the language of 

international law.9  

As emphasized by Hazel Fox and Philippa Webb in the quotation that is the 

epigraph of this chapter, state immunity is a subject of study that draws attention to the 

fundamental issues of international law.  

 

                                                
9 See Martti Koskenniemi, From Apology to Utopia: The Structure of International Legal Argument (CUP 
2005) 614-615 (footnotes omitted): 
 

‘If international law is indeterminate, then there is no limit to the extent it can be used to justify 
(and of course, to criticize) existing practices. If there is a structural bias, then international law 
is always already complicit in the actual system of distribution of material and spiritual values 
in the world. From this perspective, the task for lawyers would no longer be to seek to expand 
the scope of the law so as to grasp the dangers of politics but to widen the opportunity of 
political contestation of an always already legalized world.  
‘And yet, such contestation may also be carried out through the grammar of international law. 
…’

1.4 Structure of the monograph 

 

After these introductory notes, chapter 2 presents the main conceptual elements of 

the law of state immunity and the framework in which issues arising from the relationship 

between state immunity and human rights are embedded. Chapter 3, which is the longest 

chapter of this monograph, deals with the judicial practice relating to state immunity and 

human rights. This chapter breaks down the main cases in which questions concerning 

state immunity and human rights appear and maps the argumentative strategies employed 

by national and international courts and the theoretical conceptions upon which these 

arguments are made. Chapter 4 is dedicated to proposals put forth by scholars to better 

accommodate state immunity and human rights. They are outlined and briefly assessed. 

Chapter 5 expounds the core argument of this monograph, namely that the answers to the 

questions arising from the relationship between state immunity and human rights hide 

conflicts among theoretical conceptions of international law, which happen at a—to use 

Koskenniemi’s expression—‘higher level of abstraction’ 10 . As such, any consensus 

reached remains open to contestation through the language of international law. Some 

general concluding thoughts are then offered. 

 

                                                
10 See Koskenniemi (n 9) 3 (emphasis added):  
 

‘In crucial doctrinal areas, treaties, customary law, general principles, jus cogens and so on 
conflicting views are constantly presented as “correct” normative outcomes. Each general 
principle seems capable of being opposed with an equally valid counter-principle. Moreover, 
these conflicting views and principles are very familiar and attempts to overcome the conflicts 
they entail seem to require returning to “theory” which, however, merely reproduces the 
conflicts at a higher level of abstraction.’

2 — CONCEPTS AND FRAMEWORK 
 

 

 

 

 

‘The origin of the absolute theory of state immunity is usually traced to the maxim par in 

parem non habet imperium. It has been convincingly shown that law-trained minds are 

acutely vulnerable to maxims, especially those in Latin.’

Nijhoff 1984) 94 (footnote omitted) 

 

 

 

 

 

This chapter presents the discourses and the framework which underlie the debate 

on the relationship between state immunity and human rights. It starts by introducing the 

notion of state immunity and the discussion surrounding whether the starting point of an 

analysis of state immunity should be the principle of sovereign equality or the principle of 

adjudicatory jurisdiction.  

Subsequently, alternative views about the basis of the law of state immunity are 

analyzed. In an article published in 1911, Dionisio Anzilotti advanced a refreshing 

perspective on the subject. Although he is considered one of the proponents of absolute 

immunity, Anzilotti dismissed the understanding according to which immunity is a 

manifestation of the sovereign equality and the independence of states. Hersch 

Lauterpacht, in an article published in 1951, boldly stated that there was no rule of law 

obliging states to grant immunity to other states and proposed the abolition of state 

immunity subject to a few exceptions. James Crawford, upon considering that the assertion 

par in parem non habet jurisdictionem, traditionally understood to underlie state immunity, 

is question-begging, sought to rearticulate its basis. He found three international rules 

consistent with the grant of state immunity (the international dispute settlement rule, the 



7  

domestic jurisdiction rule and the exhaustion of local remedies rule) and contended that the 

distinction between acta jure imperii and acta jure gestionis did not exist as matter of 

positive international law. 

The following section gives a brief panorama of the current law of state immunity. 

It is analyzed how the restricted rule of state immunity came to be accepted. Studies 

contesting the disseminated notion that absolute immunity existed as a rule of international 

law are also presented. Next, problems relating to the distinction between acta jure imperii 

and acta jure gestionis are discussed. A cursory overview of the sources of the law of state 

immunity and a few remarks on the different issue of immunity from execution are then 

offered. 

Finally, referring to Wolfgang Friedmann’s work about the changing structure of 

international law and Joseph Weiler’s metaphor of the geology of international law to 

explain the changes undergone by international law, the context in which questions 

involving state immunity and human rights come about is framed.  

 

2.1 Discourses on the foundations of the law of state immunity  

 

2.1.1 Notion and functions  

 

As codified by the ILC in Article 5 of the UNCJISP, state immunity is the 

immunity enjoyed by a state in respect of itself (‘jurisdictional immunity’) and its property 

(‘enforcement immunity’) from the jurisdiction of the courts of another state.1 Regarding 

the raison d’être of immunities, the Resolution adopted in 2009 in Naples by the IDI stated 

that 

 
‘… [i]mmunities are conferred to ensure an orderly allocation and exercise of jurisdiction in 

accordance with international law in proceedings concerning States, to respect the sovereign 

equality of States and to permit the effective performance of the functions of persons who act 

on behalf of States.’2

 Sompong Sucharitkul asserted that there is an elusiveness to the concept of 

immunity due to its relativity. According to the Thai Ambassador, this relativity has at 

least three strands.3 In the first place, ‘… it does not impose an obligation to grant 

immunity beyond the extent recognized by customary international law.’ 4  Sompong 

Sucharitkul mentions that to accord immunity beyond the legitimate extent is not a 

violation of a rule of law5, but that is open to debate since it can be argued that it may 

conflict with the individual’s right of access to justice as protected, for instance, in Articles 

6.1 and 13 of the ECHR and Articles 8 and 25 of the ACHR. Secondly, it is relative in the 

sense that it has a connection to the consent of the state against which legal proceedings 

are initiated.6  As Sucharitkul emphasizes, said consent can only be implied by a positive 

conduct––and once it is given, immunity disappears without leaving any trace of impeding 

the operation of jurisdiction.7 Thirdly, the Thai Ambassador adds that state immunity is 

only from jurisdiction––and not from substantive law, which applies independently of the 

exercise of jurisdiction.8 The responsibility of the state for its wrongful acts is engaged 

automatically.  

The concept of immunity is not in itself problematic—in simple terms, state 

immunity exempts one state from the adjudicatory jurisdiction of another state in certain 

situations. 9  Furthermore, there is a consensus that immunity is now restricted. 

Nevertheless, the foundations and scope of state immunity are still a matter of debate.

‘Like other jurisdictional discourses, sovereign immunity doctrine resolves conflicting claims 
to authority without overt reference to norms of substance. Somewhat simplified, the doctrine 
of sovereign immunity exempts one sovereign from the municipal jurisdiction of another in 
certain situations. Both sovereigns might claim authority over the situation. In any dispute, 
only one can win. The discourse of immunity delimits the situations in which the territorial 
jurisdiction of one sovereignty gives away to the authority of another. Except in a very recent 
strand of the discourse, this is done without reference to the relative merits of the substantive 
rules each would apply.  
‘Immunity doctrine resolves not only a clash between two sovereign authorities but also 
between two aspects of the sovereignty of the territorial state. Typically, the foreign state has 
gotten in a wrangle with the citizens of the home state who seek relief in their court system. 
The court must then choose between the municipal rights of the citizens whose protection 
defines sovereign authority and the international rights of the foreign sovereign whose 
reciprocal respect defines sovereignty as well. When made in the rhetoric of sovereign 
immunity, this choice does not present a material hierarchy among various rights—comparing, 
for example, what the foreign state and the citizen require.’

These debates matter because different understandings on these subjects lead to different 

normative consequences.  

 

2.1.2 Sovereign equality or adjudicatory jurisdiction?  

  

In 1812, the US Supreme Court delivered its judgment in The Schooner Exchange v 

McFaddon. This case concerned the seizure of a private ship, which was ‘violent and 

forcibly taken … out of the custody of the libellants’ under the orders of the Emperor of 

France.10 When said ship anchored on the port of Philadelphia due to ‘great stress of 

weather upon the high seas’, its former owners filed a libel claiming ownership of the 

vessel.11 The claim was ultimately dismissed based on the immunity of the warship of a 

foreign sovereign. Chief Justice Marshall delivered the opinion of the Supreme Court. He 

identified a conflict of principles that to this day govern the discourses on the foundations 

of the law of state immunity: the principles of territorial jurisdiction and sovereign 

equality.12  

Chief Justice Marshall referred to the principle of territorial jurisdiction in the 

following way: 

 
‘The jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute. It 

is susceptible of no limitation not imposed by itself. Any restriction upon it deriving validity 

from an external source would imply a diminution of its sovereignty to the extent of the 

restriction and an investment of that sovereignty to the same extent in that power which could 

impose such restriction. 

‘All exceptions, therefore, to the full and complete power of a nation within its own territories 

must be traced up to the consent of the nation itself. They can flow from no other legitimate 

source.’13 

 

The principle of sovereign equality, in its turn, was presented in the following 

manner:

Hierarchy Theory’ (2003) 97(4) AJIL 741, 745-748.

10  

‘The world [is] composed of distinct sovereignties, possessing equal rights and equal 

independence …  

‘[The] full and absolute territorial jurisdiction, being alike the attribute of every sovereign and 

being incapable of conferring extraterritorial power, would not seem to contemplate foreign 

sovereigns nor their sovereign rights as its objects.’14 

 

Prima facie, the principle of territorial jurisdiction granted authority for the United 

States to adjudicate the dispute, in the same way that the principle of sovereign equality 

demanded the United States to abstain from exercising jurisdiction over the dispute.15 

Since these principles are not in a hierarchical relationship, choosing one over the other 

would amount to a violation of one of the parties’ rights. Chief Justice Marshall did away 

with the conflict by resorting to the notion of tacit consent:  

 
‘… [The] mutual benefit [of distinct sovereignties being] promoted by intercourse with each 

other and by an interchange of those good offices which humanity dictates and its wants 

require, all sovereigns have consented to a relaxation in practice, in cases under certain 

peculiar circumstances, of that absolute and complete jurisdiction within their respective 

territories which sovereignty confers. 

‘This consent may in some instances be tested by common usage and by common opinion, 

growing out of that usage.  

‘… This perfect equality and absolute independence of sovereigns, and this common interest 

impelling them to mutual intercourse, and an interchange of good offices with each other have 

given rise to a class of cases in which every sovereign is understood to waive the exercise of a 

part of that complete exclusive territorial jurisdiction which has been stated to be the attribute 

of every nation.’16 

 

Marshall gave three examples of exceptions to the exercise of territorial 

jurisdiction: the immunity of the person of the sovereign, of foreign ministers and of armed 

forces (‘troops of a foreign prince’) that are allowed to enter the territory of the state.17 

 In order to uphold France’s immunity without encroaching the United States’ right 

to territorial jurisdiction, Chief Justice Marshall had to rely on a fiction by asserting the 

United States had tacitly consented to abstain from the exercise of jurisdiction.18 With a

18 See also Kennedy (n 9) 155-165. 



11  

view to strengthening his argument, Chief Justice Marshall referred to an excerpt of 

Vattel’s treatise on the law of nations. In the words of Vattel: 

 
‘… it is impossible to conceive that the prince who sends an ambassador or any other minister, 

can have any intention of subjecting him to the authority of a foreign power: and this 

consideration furnishes an additional argument which completely establishes the independency 

of a public minister. If it cannot be reasonably presumed that his sovereign means to subject 

him to the authority of the prince to whom he is sent, the latter, in receiving the minister, 

consents to admit him on the footing of independency: and thus there exists between the two 

princes a tacit convention which gives a new force to the natural obligation.’19  

 

Chief Justice Marshall extended the same understanding to the situation of a 

foreign public armed ship that, in a situation of distress, is allowed to anchor in a foreign 

port:  

 
‘[It is] impossible … to conceive, whatever may be the construction as to private ships, that a 

prince who stipulates a passage for his troops or an asylum for his ships of war in distress 

should mean to subject his army or his navy to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign. And if 

this cannot be presumed, the sovereign of the port must be considered as having conceded the 

privilege to the extent in which it must have been understood to be asked. 

‘… [A public armed ship] constitutes a part of the military force of her nation; acts under the 

immediate and direct command of the sovereign; is employed by him in national objects. He 

has many and powerful motives for preventing those objects from being defeated by the 

interference of a foreign state. Such interference cannot take place without affecting his power 

and his dignity. The implied license, therefore, under which such vessel enters a friendly port 

may reasonably be construed, and it seems to the Court ought to be construed, as containing 

an exemption from the jurisdiction of the sovereign within whose territory she claims the rites 

of hospitality.’20 

 

Applying this understanding to the case at hand, Chief Justice Marshall concluded 

that

‘… the Exchange, being a public armed ship in the service of a foreign sovereign with whom 

the government of the United States is at peace, and having entered an American port open for 

her reception on the terms on which ships of war are generally permitted to enter the ports of a 

friendly power, must be considered as having come into the American territory under an 

implied promise that while necessarily within it and demeaning herself in a friendly manner, 

she should be exempt from the jurisdiction of the country.’21 

 

As pointed out by David Kennedy, the implications drawn out by Marshall could 

be reversed: 

 
‘One could image the U.S. having consented to entry only upon the grounds that France submit 

to its jurisdiction and France having accepted this condition. The point is that the consensual 

rhetoric allows Marshall to make an argument which relies upon a view of the substantive 

limits of sovereignty seem independent of substantive choice.’22 

 

In Schooner Exchange, as previously analyzed, Chief Justice Marshall did away 

with the conflict between sovereign equality and territorial jurisdiction by resorting to 

implicit consent. As described by Caplan, these two principles gave rise to two different 

theoretical approaches to state immunity.23 Adopting one approach or the other has great 

practical consequences, and more so as regards the relationship between state immunity 

and human rights. The first approach asserts that, since state immunity stems from the 

principle of sovereign equality, it is a fundamental right of the state, hence the maxim par 

in parem non habet imperium.24 The second, that sovereign immunity is an exception to 

the principle of territorial jurisdiction.25  

Lee M. Caplan put forth the view that the second perspective is more compelling 

based on several grounds. Caplan makes the case that the true meaning of the principle of 

sovereign equality does not entail as a corollary the maxim par in parem non habet 

imperium. According to Caplan, sovereign equality means that states are equal in their 

capacity for rights.26 Caplan argues that, in international law, there is a correspondence

26 ibid 751-752. 



13  

between sovereign authority and national borders, ie ‘a state’s capacity for rights, like 

statehood itself, is linked to a defined geographical area’.27 Accordingly,  

 
‘… a state’s capacity for right stands at its apogee when applied in relation to its own territory 

and citizens.  

‘… Conversely, by simple operation of the principle of sovereign equality, a state’s capacity 

for rights will diminish when in direct conflict with another state’s sphere of authority, i.e., the 

jurisdiction of that state over persons, property, and events in its national territory. … [T]he 

same principle of sovereign equality that entitles the foreign sovereign to govern with respect 

to its own national territory now excludes it from exercising authority in another state’s 

territory. In such cases, the foreign state’s capacity for rights with respect to the forum state 

reaches its lowest ebb.’28  

 

This is why Caplan concludes that the maxim par in parem non habet imperium 

does not reflect properly how the international legal order works. Caplan contends that 

state immunity is a privilege, and not a right, and that the principle par in parem non habet 

imperium distorts the meaning of the principle of sovereign equality, which refers to a 

state’s capacity for rights.29  

Caplan also argues that the view of state immunity as a fundamental state right has 

been used to justify the absolute theory of state immunity. And absolute immunity is, on its 

turn, a myth. According to Caplan’s account, the exemption from jurisdiction generally 

accorded to states in the eighteenth and nineteenth century was not a result of the 

application of a blanket rule of state immunity, but of practical considerations: 

 
‘In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, sovereigns interacted with one another in 

peacetime in a very limited way, predominantly through diplomatic intercourse or military 

cooperation. Consequently, inter-state disputes almost inevitably touched upon sensitive 

foreign policy matters. The law of state immunity reflected these sensitivities and the 

prevailing preference for resolving these disputes by diplomacy, rather than adjudication. Most 

likely, claims against states in respect of private conduct—though technically not barred from 

foreign adjudication—were also handled diplomatically in accordance with the prevailing 

state-centric paradigm. Thus, one cannot equate the fact that courts did not exercise jurisdiction

29 ibid 753. 



14  

over foreign states in this early period with a general prohibition against doing so on account of 

the principle of sovereign equality.’30 

 

Caplan considers that the advent of the restrictive theory of state immunity is also 

at odds with the fundamental right approach to state immunity. In Caplan’s view, ‘if state 

immunity were a fundamental state right, it would never be susceptible to theoretical 

division along public/private lines.’31 

The perspective according to which adjudicatory jurisdiction ought to be the 

starting point––and state immunity, an exception derived from the forum state’s waiver of 

adjudicatory jurisdiction—is, according to Caplan, not only a more ‘persuasive and 

realistic’ explanation of the doctrine of state immunity, but also a more ‘sensible 

international policy’.32 As he explains: 

 
‘States understood to possess a fundamental right to immunity would be permitted to act with 

impunity. Carried to the logical extreme, this notion would mean that foreign states acting in 

their foreign capacity could never be held accountable by the forum state. On the other hand, if 

state immunity is considered a practical courtesy, capable of being modified (or even 

withdrawn, if need be), then a more balanced relationship is maintained between the foreign 

state and the forum state. A foreign state will be more cautious about treading on the interests 

of other states, fearing that unacceptable conduct will result in the withdrawal of immunity 

and, in turn, the review of such conduct by domestic courts.’33 

  

Although Caplan contends that state immunity ought to be seen as a ‘practical 

courtesy’ and as a privilege, later in his article he concedes that  ‘… the practice by states 

of waiving adjudicatory jurisdiction to create immunity privileges has created binding 

norms through the development of international custom as to only a core body of state 

conduct.’34 According to him these binding norms do not comprehend ‘state conduct … 

that undermines the aim and purpose of the international legal order.’35 In sum, Caplan 

proposes a functional approach to state immunity, according to which immunity should be 

accorded only when it helps promoting the interests of the community of states. 

Rosalyn Higgins is also one of the proponents that sovereign immunity should be

seen as an exception to the principle of jurisdiction.36 She pointed out that the concepts that 

had been used to justify the absolute doctrine of state immunity (the equality and 

independence of states, the dignity of the sovereign, and the comity of nations), given the 

shift to the restrictive doctrine, do not make much sense any longer.37 In her view, the 

equality of nations ‘… now requires that States should not, by choosing to involve 

themselves in the field of trade, unilaterally be entitled to extended immunities that other 

States, which leave trade to the commercial sector, do not claim.’38 Accordingly, she 

maintains that the concept of the dignity of the sovereign has now changed and that it 

cannot be understood as contrary to the dignity of the sovereign to submit to the rule of 

law.39 As regards the principle of the comity of nations, Rosalyn Higgins highlighted that it 

‘… can only emphasize the important fact that the circumstances in which immunity will 

not be granted or withheld should be founded on international consensus, but cannot 

otherwise give guidance as to how the distinction is to be operated.’40 

Although the critiques presented by Caplan and Higgins are powerful, the orthodox 

view of state immunity still seems to consider it as a corollary of the principle of sovereign 

equality, which should then function as the starting point of analysis. As Lorna McGregor 

pointed out,  

 
‘[i]n civil actions brought against a foreign state or its officials, courts tend either to focus on 

the availability of immunity without first addressing the jurisdictional basis for the case or to 

conflate both jurisdiction and immunity into a simultaneous and overlapping analysis. Such an 

approach suggests that immunity constitutes the primary rule instead of reflecting its 

exceptionality which, but for the foreign state’s involvement, would enable the courts of the 

forum state to exercise jurisdiction.’41 
 

This is reflected in the approach adopted by most codifications of the law of state 

immunity (the UNCJISP 2004, the ECSI 1972, the FSIA 1976, the SIA 1978), which 

employed the technique of establishing a general rule of immunity and providing for the 

exceptions.

2.1.3 Other views 

 

2.1.3.1 Dionisio Anzilotti  

 

In an article published in 1911, Anzilotti contended that states had the right to 

jurisdictional immunity but for a few exceptions. He did so, however, by resorting to a 

different basis than that relied upon by most proponents of the absolute theory of state 

immunity.   

Anzilotti’s starting point is that there is a distinction between the recognition of a 

state as a subject of international law and the recognition of the domestic legal personality 

of a foreign state. The former is an act of international law, whilst the latter is an act of 

domestic law.42 The recognition of the legal personality of a foreign state under domestic 

law is, in Anzilotti’s perspective, a manifestation of the power of imperium of the forum 

state. As such, the foreign state enters this relationship as a subject of the sovereign power 

of the forum state. As put by Anzilotti: 

 
‘…[L]o Stato … può entrare in rapporti di diritto che si svolgono nel seno di un’altra comunità 

giuridica statuale solamente come un membro di questa comunità, sia pur temporaneo e a certi 

effetti soltanto; e quindi come sottoposto al potere che v’impera. Per tal via appunto diviene 

possibile che le leggi di uno Stato accordino diritti ed impongano doveri ad un altro Stato, 

comportandosi in confronto a lui come agli altri membri della comunità e si formano fra gli 

Stati medesimi delle relazione giuridiche, che metton capo alla loro capacità di diritto pubblico 

o privato, e non sono quindi nè possono essere regolate dal diritto internazionale.’43 

 

Anzilotti posits that the question that has to be answered is whether a state, as a 

subject of legal relations under the domestic law of another state, has an international right 

to jurisdictional immunity: 

 
‘Invece di discutere se lo Stato, per la natura sua e per le qualità di cui è investito, può andar 

sottoposto alla giurisdizione di un altro Stato, si deve partire dal principio che lo Stato può 

entrare in rapporti giuridici rispetto ai quali è sottoposto alla potestà di un altro Stato, e vedere 

                                                
42  Dionisio Anzilotti, ‘L’esenzione degli Stati stranieri dalla giurisdizione (saggio di critica e di 
ricostruzione)’ in Dionisio Anzilotti, Opere (Vol 2, CEDAM 1960) 131. 
43 ibid 135 (footnotes omitted).  



17  

se, relativamente ad essi, esista un principio di diritto internazionale che obblighi gli Stati ad 

astenersi dall’esercitare quella giurisdizione che altrimenti avrebbero …’44 

 

In Anzilotti’s perspective, therefore, immunity is a right enjoyed by the foreign 

state as subject to the authority of another state, which grants immunity as a result of the 

duty to do so under international law. In other words, the claim a foreign state has to 

immunity is founded on customary international law, but the foreign state does not enjoy it 

as a subject of international law, but as a legal person under the domestic law of the forum 

state. In Anzilotti’s words: 

 
‘Il fatto che l’immunità di giurisdizione non è la conseguenza logica dell’eguaglianza degli 

Stati propria dei rapporti internazionali, ma una prerogativa concessa dall’autorità statuale ad 

un ente subordinato, spiega l’esistenza di limiti dell’immunità stessa, ossia di casi nei quali uno 

Stato trovasi effettivamente sottoposto alla potestà giurisdizionale di un altro Stato: dove, per 

qualsiasi motivo, la concessione vien meno, rimane integro il rapporto di subordinazione 

caratteristico delle relazioni giuridiche di cui si parla, rapporto che la concessione restringe o 

modifica nelle sue pratiche conseguenze, ma non distrugge certamente né nega.  

‘Sarebbero invece inesplicabili questi casi se l’esenzione dalla giurisdizione fosse conseguenza 

ed applicazione dei principi di eguaglianza ed indipendenza degli Stati, perché non è 

concepibile potestà d’impero sopra un ente perfettamente eguale e completamente autonome, 

qualunque sia l’indole e la natura del fatto per cui quella potestà dovrebbe esercitarsi. Si 

l’eguaglianza e l’indipendenza degli Stati escludono l’esercizio della giurisdizione dell’uno in 

confronto all’altro quando si tratta di rapporti contrattuali o da fatto illecito, non si può 

ammettere che lo stesso principio non valga anche per le controversie relative a beni immobili: 

ammettere la subordinazione anche in un sol caso vuol dire ammetterne la possibilità, ossia 

negare il significato attribuito un momento prima alla posizione reciproca degli Stati.’45 

 

Anzilotti, therefore, dismisses the understanding according to which state immunity 

is a manifestation of the equality and independence of states under international law. To 

Anzilotti, in matters of immunity, the equality and independence of states is immaterial, 

since immunity is granted to the foreign state when it appears as subject of legal relations 

under domestic law, and not under international law, although the concession of immunity 

is done to fulfill an obligation under international law: immunity is, then, ‘… un diritto che 

lo Stato accorda a subietti subordinati, per adempire un dovere impostogli dalle norme

giuridiche internazionali.’46 At the time Anzilotti wrote his article, he found ‘… in modo 

non dubbio la persuasione che uno Stato non possa, fuori di certo casi eccezionali ben 

determinati, essere obbligato a sottostare alla giurisdizione di un altro Stato’47, and this is 

the reason why he is considered one of the proponents of absolute immunity. 

Anzilotti’s attempt to reconstruct the foundations of the law of state immunity is 

interesting because, although he found at the time there were few exceptions to the 

obligation states have to accord immunity to a foreign state, he did so on the basis of the 

existence of customary international law requiring it, and not on the basis of the sovereign 

equality and independence of states. If it was the case that state immunity derived from the 

sovereign equality and independence of states, then that would not account for the 

existence of some restrictions to the rule, as demonstrated by the widely recognized 

exception to state immunity as regards immovable property owned by the foreign state in 

the territory of the forum state.  

 

2.1.3.2 Hersch Lauterpacht  

 

Lauterpacht, in an article published in 1951, proposed that the position of foreign 

states should be assimilated to that of organs of the forum state before its courts.48 He 

rejected the restrictive doctrine of state immunity because, according to him, the 

distinction between acta jure imperii and acta jure gestionis could not ‘… accurately or 

profitably be accepted as the basis of future law.’49 A closer look will be taken at 

Lauteparcht’s critique of this distinction in a later section of this chapter. 

Lauterpacht expressed the view according to which there was ‘no rule of 

international law which obliges states to grant jurisdictional immunity to other states’.50 As 

put by Lauterpacht, assuming that the duty of municipal courts to abstain from exercising 

jurisdiction over foreign states stems from the independence and equality of nations, 

 
‘[i]t is not explained why, if immunity from jurisdiction is a rule of international law, it should 

not apply to acts jure gestionis; or, assuming that absolute immunity from jurisdiction was 

originally a rule of international law, when and how states consented to a limitation of that rule

in matters jure gestionis. 

‘… [N]o legitimate claim of sovereignty is violated if the courts of a state assume jurisdiction 

over a foreign state with regard to contracts concluded or torts committed in the territory of the 

state assuming jurisdiction. On the contrary the sovereignty, the independence, and the equality 

of the latter are denied if the foreign state claims as a matter of right––as a matter of 

international law––to be above the law of the state within the territory of which it has engaged 

in legal transactions or committed acts entailing legal consequences according to the law of 

that state. The absence of any denial of independence or equality appears even more clearly 

when the state exercising jurisdiction over a foreign state submits itself, within the same 

sphere, to the full operation of its own law without claiming any privileged status or 

immunity.’51  

 

Following Lauterpacht’s line of thought, considering that nowadays the state is 

subject to the full operation of its own law before its courts, it would actually be more 

consonant with the principles of equality and independence of states if domestic courts 

could exercise jurisdiction over foreign states,  

 
‘… so long as the state exercising jurisdiction merely applies its ordinary law … and so long as 

it applies it in an unobjectionable manner not open to the reproach of a denial of justice or of 

the disregard of the legislative and administrative sovereignty of the foreign state.’52   

 

 Indeed, the rationale for attributing immunity to foreign sovereigns followed from 

the traditional immunity of the sovereign––considered legibus solutus––before his own 

courts. Now that the state is subject to the jurisdiction of its own courts, it appears illogical 

that foreign states are exempt from it. 

As Lauterpacht articulated:  

 
‘A state does not derogate from the dignity of another state by subjecting it to the normal 

operation of the law under proper municipal and international safeguards and on a footing of 

equality with the state within which it concludes a contract or commits a tort. The dignity of 

foreign states is no more impaired by their being subjected to the law, impartially applied, of a 

foreign country than it is by submission to their own law. As English judges have occasionally 

observed, the dignity of a foreign state may suffer more from an appeal to immunity than from 

a denial of it.’53 

                                                
51 Lauterpacht (n 48) 228-229. 
52 ibid 229. 
53 ibid 231-232 (footnotes omitted). 



20  

  

In the light of these considerations, Lauterpacht proposed the abolition, subject to 

some exceptions, of state immunity by an international agreement or unilateral legislative 

action of the states that subject their organs to the jurisdiction of their own courts.54 

Lauterpacht put forth four exceptions to his proposal of abolition of state immunity.55 

Firstly, he considered that immunity ought to be maintained as regards legislative acts of 

foreign states and measures taken in pursuance thereof. Secondly, Lauterpacht maintained 

that immunity should remain in respect of executive and administrative acts of the foreign 

state that take place in its territory. Thirdly, Lauterpacht stated that immunity should 

continue as regards contracts which, by virtue of the rules of private international law, are 

not within the jurisdiction of the courts of the forum state. Lastly, Lauterpacht considered 

that diplomatic immunities should be maintained and that vessels and aircrafts belonging 

to the armed forces of a foreign state should not be subject to an action in rem, seizure, or 

arrest. 

  

2.1.3.3 James Crawford 

 

In an article published in 1984, Crawford maintained that the ‘… simple assertion, 

par in parem non habet jurisdictionem, which is said to underlie the principle of 

jurisdictional immunity, is itself question-begging.’56 He also asserted that the distinction 

between acta jure imperii and acta jure gestionis does not exist as a matter of positive 

international law, given the lack of consensus and of ‘inherent plausibility’.57 He sought to 

rearticulate the basis of state immunity as a rule of international law with a view to 

differentiating between immune and non-immune transactions under international law. 

Crawford found three rules underlying the notion of state immunity: (i) the international 

dispute settlement rule; (ii) the existence of matters that international law refers 

exclusively or primarily to the competence of states (ie, the domestic jurisdiction rule); and 

(iii) the exhaustion of local remedies rule.58  

The international dispute settlement rule establishes that a state ‘… cannot be

required to submit to international adjudication without its consent.’59 As stated by the ICJ 

in Monetary Gold Taken from Rome: ‘… [there is] a well-established principle of 

international law embodied in the Court’s Statute, namely, that the Court can only exercise 

jurisdiction over a State with its consent.’60 Said rule obviously does not apply directly to 

municipal courts, but, as stated by James Crawford,  

 
‘… [it] provides strong support by analogy, if not directly, for a rule of foreign State immunity 

in the rater limited areas governed by that jurisdictional rule. 

‘… [A]t least in limited circumstances, the international dispute settlement rule indicates, if it 

does not require, the adoption of a rule of deference by a municipal court, and that this rule is 

most coherently treated as an immunity ratione personae of foreign States from adjudicatory 

jurisdiction.’61  

 

In this perspective, as Crawford asserts, the domestic expression of the 

international dispute settlement rule is that, regarding transactions that are not within the 

jurisdiction of the forum state under international law, domestic courts are not in a position 

to assert jurisdiction over a state that did not consent to it.62 Crawford adds that the 

international dispute settlement rule does not cover matters left to the jurisdiction of the 

forum state, hence it has a limited scope.63  

Following Crawford’s line of thought, the translation of the international dispute 

settlement rule into a foreign state immunity rule is aided by the distinction between 

international and domestic jurisdiction and by the rule of exhaustion of local remedies.64  

Domestic jurisdiction refers to ‘… those transactions––typically, transactions 

within the community of a particular State––which international law refers primarily or 

exclusively to the competence of that State.’65 Crawford highlights that states are therefore 

autonomous to matters under their domestic jurisdiction––and such autonomy would be

‘Examples include the conferment of nationality on persons sufficiently connected with the 
State, the disposition of armed forces within the jurisdiction, and the exercise of legislative 
power over nationals resident within the State. For the most part such matters involve special 
powers exercised by the State or special relationships of State nationals with the State.’ 
 



22  

incompatible with the exercise of authority by foreign courts over these issues.66  

The exhaustion of local remedies rule establishes that parties aggrieved by a 

foreign state in its territory have to exhaust the local remedies available in the state in 

question before asking their own state to exercise diplomatic protection.67 As added by 

Crawford, although it may seem excessively restrictive, the exhaustion of local remedies 

rule does not apply to all disputes between foreign states and private parties (eg, disputes 

arising outside the defendant state’s jurisdiction, disputes in which a local remedy is 

unavailable or futile etc.).68 According to Crawford, 

 
‘… the exhaustion of local remedies rule is, to say the least, consistent with a restricted 

immunity rule allowing immunity to a defendant State with respect to transactions between 

that State and private persons in its territory. The analogy is reinforced by the fact that both 

rules can be waived.’69 

 

As previously discussed, in Crawford’s view, there are three rules of the 

international legal system that are consistent with the attribution of immunity ratione 

personae to a foreign state and that may even require domestic courts to do so: the 

international dispute settlement rule, the existence of transactions that international law 

refers to the competence of the state (the domestic jurisdiction rule), and the exhaustion of 

local remedies rule. As adverted by Crawford, these rules do not require domestic courts to 

decline jurisdiction whenever a state is party to a dispute––on the contrary, they leave 

room for the assertion of domestic jurisdiction in many (or even most) cases.70  

In Crawford’s analysis, the operation of these three rules does not support a 

distinction between acta jure imperii and acta jure gestionis. Also, lacking an international 

consensus in respect of the scope of acta jure gestionis, Crawford concludes that this 

distinction ‘… is radically defective and cannot claim to represent general international 

law.’71 As put by him 

 
‘… [A]lthough there has been a tendency to assert the existence of a rule of restrictive 

immunity predicated on a distinction between ‘private’, ‘commercial’ or ‘non-governmental’

acts of States and their ‘public’, ‘non-commercial’ or ‘governmental’ acts there is in 

international practice no consensus on any such distinction. Indeed, the better view is that, in 

the absence of a worked-out distinction between ‘public’ and ‘private’ law as part of the lex 

fori, such a distinction is incoherent. Nor does it reflect the actual distinctions drawn between 

immune and non-immune transactions in any of the recent international texts or municipal 

Acts. The better approach is to deal with the specific categories or classes of case that have 

arisen in practice and to elaborate specific rules for each such category, taking into account the 

reasons for extending immunity or asserting jurisdiction in that context. This is essentially the 

approach adopted in the United Kingdom Act and its counterparts, in the European Convention 

and (though to a rather lesser extent) in the United States and Canadian Acts. In this process it 

is necessary to have regard to the underlying reasons for extending immunity ratione personae 

to foreign States: in particular, the immunity from local jurisdiction of States with respect to 

transactions essentially within their domestic jurisdiction, or governed directly by the 

international dispute settlement rule. Of course it is also necessary to respect specific 

immunities established in international practice: in particular, the immunities of diplomatic and 

consular personnel and premises and of foreign public ships from arrest. Considerations of 

comity and reciprocity are also relevant, though the specific guidance they provide is, as usual, 

limited.  

‘… Despite statements to the effect that international law does not allow local jurisdiction to be 

exercised over foreign States in respect of their acts of sovereign authority, it is suggested that 

this is not an accurate or comprehensive statement of the relevant principles. It has already 

been suggested that the various distinctions drawn between immune and non-immune 

transactions are the result not of a single rule or principle but of a balance of principles and 

considerations. It follows that, provided local legislation reasonably reflects that balance, no 

further safeguard or prohibition is required.’ 72 

 

2.2 The current scenario of the law of state immunity 

 

2.2.1 The acceptance of the restrictive theory 

 

The standard textbook narrative on the history of the law of state immunity, as 

exemplified by Peter-Tobias Stoll, links its development with that of sovereignty and the 

territorial state.73 In the Absolutist state, sovereignty was embodied in a person.74 As 

Malcolm Shaw describes, as a result of this ‘mystique’, sovereigns could not be subject to 

suits in the courts of their countries and, accordingly, they could also not be made subject

24  

to the jurisdiction of foreign courts.75 Stoll explains that, with the end of Absolutism and 

the emergence of states as separate entities (in the sense that the state and sovereignty are 

no longer embodied in a person), state immunity starts to be considered separately.76  

The increasing engagement of the state in economic activities would have then 

started a movement from the absolute immunity approach, ‘… whereby the sovereign was 

complete immune from foreign jurisdiction in all cases regardless of circumstances’77, to 

the restrictive approach, ‘… under which immunity was available as regards governmental 

activity but not where the state was engaging in commercial activity.’78  

The idea that at some point absolute state immunity was a binding rule of 

international law has been contested. Byers sustains that, in international law, there was no 

binding rule as regards state immunity before the acceptance of the restricted rule of state 

immunity. As explained by him:  

 
‘… history suggests that there was no general rule regulating State immunity from jurisdiction 

prior to restrictive immunity becoming a rule of customary international law, and that a 

mistaken belief in such a pre-existing rule served to retard that later development.  

‘Belgian courts were applying restrictive immunity as early as 1857, while Italian courts were 

doing so in 1886, Swiss courts in 1918 and Austrian courts in 1919. Argentine and French 

courts distinguished between acts jure imperii (of government) and acts jure gestionis (of a 

commercial character) from 1924, Egyptian courts from 1926, Greek courts from 1928, Irish 

courts from 1941 and German courts from 1949. 

‘During this period, courts in common law States were applying absolute immunity and 

continued to do so until legislative changes were introduced during the 1970s and 1980s. In the 

United Kingdom, for example, it was not until 1977 that Lord Denning and Justice Shaw 

controversially applied restrictive immunity in direct contradiction to clear precedents in 

English common law.’79 

  

Byers’ findings that in some jurisdictions there was a mistaken belief in the 

existence of an absolute rule of state immunity in international law is consistent with the 

conclusions arrived at by Gamal Moursi Badr, who, upon a close analysis of the early case-

law in the United States and the United Kingdom, stated the following:

25  

‘… [T]he early decisions from the nineteenth century often cited in connection with state 

immunity do not really relate to the subject as we know it today but rather to the particular 

immunities of those physically transposed elements of the power structure of the foreign state 

[foreign ships and the person of the foreign sovereign], immunities which are distinguishable 

from what is now being debated in certain forums and being regulated by domestic legislation 

in certain countries under the heading of state immunity. It is nevertheless interesting to note 

that the said early decisions did distinguish … between a foreign sovereign’s public acts on the 

one hand and his private acts on the other, stating in no uncertain terms that the latter enjoyed 

no immunity from the jurisdiction of the local courts. The continued citation of those early 

decisions in support of the absolute theory of state immunity is therefore a curious 

phenomenon, due perhaps to a hasty perusal of those decisions or to second hand knowledge of 

them.’80 

 

As pointed out by Byers, in the United Kingdom, there were judicial expressions of 

dissatisfaction with absolute immunity and the restrictive rule was already being applied in 

some instances when the SIA came about in 1978, codifying the restrictive rule of state 

immunity.81  

In the United States, the process towards the adoption of restricted immunity was 

different. In Altmann v Republic of Austria, Justice Stevens, who delivered the opinion of 

the Court, took the opportunity to contextualize the evolution of the application of state 

immunity in the US until the enactment of the FSIA in 1976.82 Justice Stevens considered 

that the main source of sovereign immunity jurisprudence in the US was Chief Justice 

Marshall’s opinion in Schooner Exchange.83 He added that the practice of the Supreme 

Court, in the light of ‘… Chief Justice Marshall’s observation that foreign sovereign 

immunity is a matter of grace and comity rather than a constitutional requirement’, was to 

consistently defer to the decisions of the Executive on whether to exercise jurisdiction over 

actions against foreign states and their instrumentalities.84 In 1952, there was a change of 

policy in the State Department, which decided to adopt, as enunciated in the ‘Tate letter’,

the restrictive theory of state immunity.85 Justice Stevens added that the ‘Tate letter’ had 

little impact on federal courts: they continued to defer to the Executive’s opinion, which, 

on its turn, was inconsistent in respect of the restrictive theory of immunity due to political 

considerations.86 At the same time, when courts had to determine whether state immunity 

existed without relying on a suggestion of the State Department, they did not apply 

uniformly the existing criteria.87 It was for these reasons that Congress adopted the FSIA in 

1976, which ‘[codified], as a matter of federal law, the restrictive theory of sovereign 

immunity … and [transferred] primary responsibility for immunity determinations from 

the Executive to the Judicial Branch’.88 The FSIA was meant to be a ‘comprehensive 

statute containing a “set of legal standards governing claims of immunity in every civil 

action against a foreign state or its political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities.”’89 

Byers points out the following reasons that justify the difference of attitude 

between common law and civil law countries as regards openness to the restrictive theory 

of state immunity:  

  
‘First, common law courts remained bound by the doctrine of crown immunity (‘sovereign 

immunity’ in the United States) long after civil law courts began to distinguish between 

immune and non-immune acts of their own sovereigns. Secondly, courts in common law 
                                                
85 Republic of Austria v Altmann (n 83). The ‘Tate letter’ (‘Changing Policy Concerning the Granting of 
Sovereign Immunity to Foreign Governments’, Letter to US Acting Attorney-General, 19 May 1952 (1952) 
26 US Department of State Bulletin 984) posited the following: 
 

‘It is thus evident that with the possible exception of the United Kingdom little support has 
been found except on the part of the Soviet Union and its satellites for continued full 
acceptance of the absolute theory of sovereign immunity. ... The reasons which obviously 
motivate State trading countries in adhering to the theory with perhaps increasing rigidity are 
most persuasive that the United States should change its policy. Furthermore, the granting of 
sovereign immunity to foreign governments in the courts of the United States is most 
inconsistent with the action of the Government of the United States in subjecting itself to suit 
in these same courts in both contract and tort and with its long established policy of not 
claiming immunity in foreign jurisdictions for its merchant vessels. Finally, the Department 
feels that the widespread and increasing practice on the part of governments of engaging in 
commercial activities makes necessary a practice which will enable persons doing business 
with them to have their rights determined in the courts. For these reasons it will hereafter be 
the Department’s policy to follow the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity in the 
consideration of requests of foreign governments for a grant of sovereign immunity. 
‘It is realized that a shift in policy by the executive cannot control the courts but it is felt that 
the courts are less likely to allow a plea of sovereign immunity where the executive has 
declined to do so. There have been indications that at least some Justices of the Supreme Court 
feel that in this matter courts should follow the branch of the Government charged with 
responsibility for the conduct of foreign relations.’

27  

systems felt bound by the doctrine of stare decisis not to abandon their earlier applications of 

absolute immunity. Thirdly, common law States had a less acute interest in the development of 

the doctrine of restrictive immunity than most civil law States. The common law States were 

either large, such as the United States, or part of the former British Empire—with its internal 

cohesion and historic, political and commercial ties. By contrast, the smaller civil law trading 

States of continental Europe, such as the Netherlands and Belgium, were dependent to a far 

greater extent on trade between fully sovereign States. 

‘However, it seems that the principle of legitimate expectation also played a role. In every 

common law jurisdiction, absolute immunity was viewed as the previously applicable rule of 

customary international law. Consequently, the changes in national laws were regarded as 

responses to a change in the existing customary rule rather than as responses to the 

development of a new rule, even though it is apparent, from the earlier developments in civil 

law jurisdictions, that a customary rule of absolute State immunity could not have existed at 

any date after the very early twentieth century.’90 

  

2.2.2 Problems related to the distinction between acta jure imperii and acta jure 

gestionis  

 

According to Jasper Finke, the distinction between acts jure imperii and acts jure 

gestionis embodies the ‘capitalist conception of the liberal state’ and its ‘inherent 

distinction between private and public’: economic transactions would have a private 

character, thus they would not be protected by the veil of state immunity.91   

As posited by James Crawford, what is clear regarding state immunity is that it is 

not absolute––it is restricted. At the same time,  

 
‘… we lack a rationale, a connected explanation, for this state of affairs, an articulated set of 

criteria which would enable us to draw the distinction between cases in which States or their 

transactions are entitled to immunity from the jurisdiction of other States as a matter of 

international law and cases in which they are not.’92 

 

Indeed, this lack of rationale for the distinction between acts jure imperii and jure 

gestionis resulted in inconsistent state practice. Lauterpacht, in 1951, made the following 

observations:

28  

‘Courts of different countries––and occasionally courts of the same country––have treated the 

same kind of activity in different ways. Thus the operation of railways by the state has been 

considered by some courts to be an activity of a public-law character; it has been regarded by 

others as partaking of the nature of an undertaking of a private-law nature. 

‘… Moreover, it is no longer generally accepted that the economic activities of the state––such 

as state management of industry, state buying, and state selling––are necessarily of a purely 

‘private-law nature’; that they are ‘jure gestionis’; and that in engaging in them a state acts like 

a private person. In these and similar cases ostensibly removed from the normal field of its 

political and administrative activities, the state nevertheless acts as a public person for the 

general purposes of the community as a whole.’93 

 

Having analyzed the practice of many state on many different issues, Lauterpacht 

concluded that ‘… the distinction between acts jure gestionis and acts jure imperii cannot 

be placed on a sound logical basis.’94 Jasper Fink, in an article published in 2011, 

maintained that there is still a lack of consistency in state practice.95 This is why he 

concluded that foreign state immunity as a rule of customary law is characterized by an 

agreement between states concerning the concept itself and by substantial disagreement on 

detail and substance, ie states are bound to respect foreign sovereign immunity, but on a 

high level of abstraction.96 

The most common criteria for distinguishing between acts jure imperii and jure 

gestionis refer either to the purpose or to the nature of the act in question. The purpose test, 

as pointed out by Rosalyn Higgins, has been generally rejected.97 It is unsatisfactory 

precisely because of the reason indicated by Lauterpacht: all acts of a state ultimately have 

a public purpose of some sort.98 The nature test is not entirely satisfactory either. A 

classical formulation of the nature test is found on a course André Weiss, a former judge at 

the extinct PCIJ, taught at the Hague Academy in 1923. The excerpt where he explains it is 

long but worth reproducing: 

 
‘Il parait beaucoup plus sûr d’admettre que la nature des actes accomplis par l’État étranger 

doit seule être prise en considération, lorsqu’il s’agit d’accorder ou de dénier aux tribunaux des 

autres pays le pouvoir d’en connaître. Par là, nous rendons inutiles les distinctions que je 

signalais tout à l’heure; le juge n’a à se livrer à aucune recherche d’intention; et sa tâche

devient extrêmement facile, puisqu’elle se ramène à une simple constatation de fait : Un acte

aucun cas il ne puisse être fait par d’autres que par l’État ou au nom de l’État : dans ce cas, 

c’est un acte de puissance publique, c’est un acte politique, qui ne pourrait, sans atteinte à la 

souveraineté de cet État, être soumis au contrôle d’une autorité étrangère. L’incompétence 

s’impose. Au contraire, l’acte est-il de la nature de ceux que toute personne privée pourrait 

accomplir, tel qu’un contrat, tel qu’un emprunt, cet acte, quel que soit le but qui lui a été 

assigné, quel que soit le dessein qu’il poursuit, est un acte privé, et le tribunal étranger saisi 

sera compétent pour en connaître. Et nous en concluons que la compétence de ce tribunal ne 

pourra être déclinée, même si le contrat litigieux affecte un caractère administratif, s’il réalise 

par exemple l’acquisition d’un navire de guerre pour le compte de l’État ou encore la 

commande de munitions et d’armes pour les arsenaux.’99 

  

The test proposed by Weiss is, therefore, whether an individual could participate or 

not in a given transaction, regardless of its object. The test is simple, but it raises many 

difficulties. As Lauterpacht criticizes, following the nature test, contracts made by the state 

for the purchase of shoes for the army, or of a warship, or of foodstuff necessary for the 

maintenance of the national economy would be held not immune from jurisdiction because 

they are contracts and individuals can conclude contracts.100 In Lauterpacht’s view, the 

application of the nature test as proposed by Weiss would ignore the reality that 

individuals, after all, do not purchase shoes for their armies and do not buy warships either.  

Gamal Moursi Badr criticized the approach according to which the test to 

differentiate between public and private acts is whether an individual could also perform 

the foreign state’s disputed act. According to him, differences among legal orders make 

this test impracticable. 101  Badr considers the employment of the lex fori to the 

characterization of the act in question as public or private is also not ideal for the same 

reasons. 102 Nevertheless, he maintains there are four ‘intrinsic, objective and readily 

applicable’ criteria to make the distinction between public and private acts: the formation 

of the act, the parties, the contents and the sanctions attaching to it.103 As regards the 

formation, he contends that a public act can be performed by the state alone, without any

further collaboration, whilst private acts will normally depend on more than one person, 

like contracts and torts.  In respect of the parties, a public act will always affect individuals 

and entities within the territorial jurisdiction of the state, while a private act, for the 

purposes of state immunity, will involve a party not subject to the state’s jurisdiction. As 

regards the content, public acts regulate aspects of public interest and are determined by 

deliberation and decision-making, while private acts accommodate two antagonistic 

interests towards a common goal and are the result of negotiation and compromise. Finally, 

in respect of public acts, states have a coercive machinery to impose sanctions, while in 

respect of private acts the state can only employ legal remedies which are also open to the 

other party. Gamal Moursi Badr’s proposal is indeed interesting, but, lacking an 

international consensus in respect of it, it cannot solve the problem of inconsistency in the 

distinction between acta jure imperii and acta jure gestionis. 

In I Congreso del Partido, Lord Wilberforce proposed a so-called ‘two-stage’ or 

‘contextual’ test in order to establish whether immunity should be granted or not.104 The 

facts of the case occurred prior to the passing of the SIA 1978, which was not applied. 

Lord Wilberforce made a summary of the facts of the case. The claim was brought against 

the vessel I Congresso del Partido, owned by Cuba, but related to two sister ships: Marble 

Islands and Playa Larga.105 It related to a contract for a sale of sugar concluded in February 

1973 between a Cuban state trading enterprise (‘Cubazucar’) and a Chilean company 

(‘Iansa’).106 One shipment was carried on Playa Larga and another on Marble Islands.107 

Playa Larga was owned by Cuba and operated by a state enterprise (‘Mambisa’), whilst the 

Marble Islands was a vessel owned by a Liechtenstein corporation.108 In September 1973, 

when the government of President Allende was overthrown by Pinochet, Cuba and Chile 

severed diplomatic relations. Playa Larga was already discharging its cargo when it 

received orders from Cuba to leave Chile and meet Marble Islands, which was at sea.109 

Playa Larga ultimately returned to Cuba with a great part of the cargo, which was sold by 

Mambisa.110 Marble Islands, on its turn, was ordered to discharge the cargo in North 

Vietnam and had its ownership acquired by Cuba while on the high seas. The cargo was

sold to a Cuban state enterprise (‘Alimport’) and later donated to the people of North 

Vietnam.111 The owners of the cargo laden on Playa Larga and Marble Islands brought 

actions against the owner of I Congreso del Partido, which was arrested at Sunderland. The 

Republic of Cuba invoked its right to immunity.   

Lord Wilberforce considered that the restrictive doctrine of state immunity 

applied.112 One of the problems of the case was that, although the initial act was a 

commercial transaction (the sale of sugar), the acts upon which the claims were based 

could be considered to have been done jure imperii, since Cuba ordered the ships not to 

proceed with the discharge of the cargo due to political reasons. Lord Wilberforce 

considered the following:  

 
‘Under the “restrictive” theory the court has first to characterise the activity into which the 

defendant state has entered. Having done this, and (assumedly) found it to be of a commercial, 

or private law, character, it may take the view that contractual breaches, or torts, prima facie 

fall within the same sphere of activity. It should then be for the defendant state to make a case 

… that the act complained of is outside that sphere, and within that of sovereign action.’113 

‘… 

‘… in considering, under the “restrictive” theory whether state immunity should be granted or 

not, the court must consider the whole context in which the claim against the state is made, 

with a view to deciding whether the relevant act(s) upon which the claim is based, should, in 

that context, be considered as fairly within an area of activity, trading or commercial, or 

otherwise of a private law character, in which the state has chosen to engage, or whether the 

relevant act(s) should be considered as having been done outside that area, and within the 

sphere of governmental or sovereign activity.’114  

 

As regards the Playa Larga, which was at the relevant time owned by Cuba, Lord 

Wilberforce considered that both the initial act and the act which gave rise to the claim did 

not involve exercise of sovereign powers and were done by Cuba as owners of the ship.115 

He highlighted that the appellants were ‘… certainly able to show, as a starting point, that 

this vessel [the Playa Larga] was engaged in trade with the consent, if not with the active 

participation, of the Republic of Cuba.’116 As regards the Marble Islands, Lord Wilberforce

32  

considered there were some difficulties. In the first place, this vessel was initially not 

owned by Cuba. He underscored the following: 

 
‘… the Republic of Cuba had no concern with, interest in, or responsibility for the cargo or for 

the operation of the ship or for the actions of the master or the crew. It was, of course, in a 

position to control the acts of Mambisa, but the commercial venture was exclusively that of 

Mambisa. The cargo owners did not do any business with a sovereign state.’117 

 

Lord Wilberforce considered that, in the case of Marble Islands, by ordering the 

vessel to transfer the sugar to North Vietnam, Cuba acted in a governmental capacity, since 

it ‘never entered’ the ‘operations of carriage, deposit and sale of the cargo’, which were 

done by Mambisa, and it only intervened to direct the transfer of the sugar.118 All their 

Lordships agreed with Lord Wilberforce in respect of the Playa Larga, but the majority 

disagreed with him regarding the Marble Islands. Lord Diplock, in respect of the Marble 

Islands, asserted that the act of discharging and selling the perishable cargo in North 

Vietnam was ‘… fairly and squarely based on private law (jus gestionis)’119 He added that 

‘… the discharge and sale of the cargo to Alimport at Haiphong was … deliberately treated 

by the Cuban government as being effected under private and not in the exercise of any 

sovereign powers’ and that these acts could be considered prima facie a tort of 

conversion.120 Lord Keith of Kinkel and Lord Bridge of Harwich concurred with Lord 

Diplock. Lord Bridge added that ‘… assuming a conversion of the cargo by the Republic 

of Cuba (an assumption necessarily to be made at this stage), this was a breach of a private 

law obligation previously assumed when the Marble Islands was acquired.’ 121  Lord 

Edmund-Davies was the only one to agree with Lord Wilberforce that Cuba could rely on 

state immunity as regards the Marble Islands cargo.122  

As can be seen from the case, the ‘two-stage’ or ‘contextual’ approach posited by 

Lord Wilberforce did not solve the difficulties relating to the distinction between acta jure 

imperii and acta juri gestionis. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, there is also no 

international consensus on the distinction between acta jure imperii and acta jure 

gestionis. Crawford goes further and asserts that the lack of a clear guidance on this matter

facilitates manipulation with a view to achieving a particular outcome and it can result in 

immunity being accorded to ‘public’ acts even though there are good reasons for the 

exercise of jurisdiction by a domestic court.123 Given these difficulties, Crawford contends 

that ‘… it cannot seriously be argued that a distinction between “public” or 

“governmental” and “private” or “non-governmental” transactions exists as a matter of 

positive international law.’ 124 This is why he tried to rearticulate the basis of state 

immunity, as analyzed in a previous section of this chapter.  

There is also another problem as regards the distinction between acta jure imperii 

and acta jure gestionis. The main statutes and treaties codifying the law of state immunity 

were inspired by it, but did not incorporate it.125 As a result, some states may entertain 

jurisdiction over acts that are not jure gestionis. This can be exemplified by the case 

Letelier v Republic of Chile.126 The claim was brought by, among others, the widow and 

sons of Chilean Ambassador Orlando Letelier, following his assassination, which took 

place in Washington, D.C. on 21 September 1976. The plaintiffs sought damages for 

tortious injuries suffered as a result of the assassination, which was allegedly committed by 

people under the direction of Chile’s intelligence organ.127 Section 1605.5 of the FSIA 

provides that a foreign state is not immune for torts committed in the forum state.128 

Section 1605.a.5.A, however, establishes that the ‘tort exception’ is not applicable to ‘any 

claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a 

discretionary function regardless of whether the discretion be abused’.129 The District 

Court found that, for the purposes of Section 1605.a.5.A, the order of the Chilean Republic 

for its organs to perpetrate the conducts that culminated in the assassination of Orlando 

                                                
123 Crawford (n 56) 90. 
124 ibid 90-91. 
125 See Finke (n 91) 858-861. The ECSI does mention the expression ‘jure imperii’ in two provisions. Article 
24 of the ECSI allows any state ‘… to declare that, in cases not falling within Articles 1 to 13, its courts shall 
be entitled to entertain proceedings against another Contracting State to the extent that its courts are entitled 
to entertain proceedings against States not party to the present Convention’, but ‘without prejudice to the 
immunity from jurisdiction which foreign States enjoy in respect of acts performed in the exercise of 
sovereign authority (acta jure imperii).’ Article 27.1, on its turn, provides that certain state agencies that 
possess separate personality and are ‘capable of suing or being sued’ are not entitled to immunity even if they 
have been ‘entrusted with public functions.’ Nevertheless Article 27.2 provides that these state agencies are 
entitled to immunity ‘in respect of acts performed by the entity in the exercise of sovereign authority (acta 
jure imperii).’ See also Hazel Fox and Philippa Webb, The Law of State Immunity (3rd edn, OUP 2013) 118-

34  

Letelier could not be understood as a ‘discretionary act’––the tort exception, therefore, 

applied. In the words of the District Judge Joyce Hens Green,  

 
‘[w]hile it seems apparent that a decision calculated to result in injury or death to a particular 

individual or individuals, made for whatever reason, would be one most assuredly involving 

policy judgment and decision and thus exempt as a discretionary act … there is no discretion to 

commit, or to have one’s officers or agents commit, an illegal act.’130  

 

The District Court also dismissed Chile’s contention that the FSIA applied only in 

respect of acta jure gestionis, stating that the distinction between acta jure imperii and 

acta juri gestionis was not incorporated in the FSIA, which was meant ‘to govern all 

claims of sovereign immunity by foreign states’.131 Lastly, the District Court held that, 

although the acts undertaken directly by the Republic of Chile were carried out in the 

territory of that country, Chile could not rely on the act of state doctrine because the 

actions of its agents resulted in torts committed in the territory of the US––as put by 

District Judge Joyce Hens Green,  

 
‘[t]o hold otherwise would totally emasculate the purpose and effectiveness of the Foreign 

Sovereign Immunities Act by permitting a foreign state to reimpose the so recently supplanted 

framework of sovereign immunity as defined prior to the Act “through the back door, under the 

guise of the act of state doctrine.”’132 

 

It is unclear whether, under international law, states are entitled to immunity in 

respect of all acts jure imperii. In Jurisdictional Immunities of the State, the ICJ avoided 

making a finding on the matter by restricting the issue submitted to it. The ICJ considered 

it had not been called upon to ‘… to resolve the question whether there is in customary 

international law a “tort exception” to State immunity applicable to acta jure imperii in 

general’ and that the issue before the Court was confined to ‘… acts committed on the 

territory of the forum State by the armed forces of a foreign State, and other organs of 

State working in co-operation with those armed forces, in the course of conducting an 

armed conflict.’133

2.2.3 Sources of the law of state immunity  

 

Rosanne van Alebeek emphasized that immunity issues arise by definition before 

domestic courts and are a ‘… textbook example of domestic courts playing a role in the 

application and development of international law’. 134  As such, the customary and 

conventional regimes of state immunity feed on domestic law and domestic court 

decisions. The law of state immunity involves, indeed, an intricate interplay between the 

domestic and the international levels.  

Christopher Schreuer made the following remarks in respect of the heterogeneity of 

the sources of the law of state immunity: 

 
‘Today, it has become difficult to say whether State immunity is a question of customary 

international law, of treaty law or of domestic law. But perhaps this is just as well, in order to 

remind us that we cannot compartmentalize international legal problems neatly by sources but 

have to take a more synoptic view which takes into account of a variety of types of legal 

authority. 

‘An obvious irony in this development is the fact that common law countries have found it 

necessary to pass legislation in order to adjust their practice, while the civil law countries have 

been quite content at developing the law on a case by case basis. This reversal of the traditional 

patterns may at least partly be explained by the fact that stare decisis has led the common law 

judiciaries into dead ends, from which only formal legislation could free them.’135 

 

As examined in a previous section of this chapter, in a seminal article published by 

Lauterpacht in 1951, it was proposed the abolition of state immunity, subject to a few 

exceptions. Christoph Schreuer remarked that the codifications of the law of state 

immunity followed the opposite approach: 

 
‘Professor Lauterpacht’s solution would have been generally to do away with State immunity 

except for a few specific areas of public activity. The more recent attempts at codification have 

all adopted the opposite method. They start from a general rule of immunity, which is 

subsequently modified by a list of non-immune activities. … [T]his technique has undeniable 

advantages over the traditional dichotomy between public and private acts. The idea is to break 

up the somewhat unwieldy concept of acta jure gestionis into several categories and thereby

36  

get a more manageable list of non-immune activities.  … No inferences should be drawn from 

this technique as to the existence of a general rule of international law requiring immunity. 

Also, this method has by no means dropped the old distinction between public and private acts. 

It has merely differentiated and in some areas expanded the area of non-immune activities. For 

instance, the provision in the United States Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act withdrawing 

immunity in case of expropriation in violation of international law is not a specification but 

clearly a deviation from the old distinction.’136 

 

Indeed, the main existing codifications (the UNCJISP 2004, the ECSI 1972, the 

SIA 1978, and the FSIA 1976) on the law of state immunity adopted a cautious approach. 

State immunity is adopted as the general rule and exceptions are laid out. The most 

important exception in these codifications is the commercial exception, which is a more 

‘reduced’ and precise version of the distinction between private and public acts.137 As 

summarized by Schreuer,  

 
‘[t]he typical exceptions to immunity under this method are commercial transactions 

employment contracts, personal injuries and damage to property, ownership and possession of 

property, intellectual property, shareholdings in companies, arbitration and ships in 

commercial service.’138 

 

The exception to immunity for torts committed in the territory of the forum state 

has been especially debated given its potential to help address human rights violations that 

took place in the forum state. 

The two international treaties on the law of state immunity were not ratified by 

many states (at the date of the submission of this monograph, the UNCJISP, which is not 

yet in force, counts 19 parties and the ECSI, 8). Also, few states have legislations 

contemplating state immunity (eg, the US, the UK, Singapore, Japan, Pakistan, South 

Africa, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Israel).139 This means that most states have to rely on 

customary international law and the murkiness that comes with it when faced with a 

question of state immunity. In a comparative study of three European countries (the UK, 

Germany and France), Joseph Dellapenna concluded that there is a scenario of 

fragmentation: 

                                                
136 Schreuer (n 135) 7. 
137 See Finke (n 91) 858-861. Article 7 ECSI; Article 10 UNCJISP; Section 1605.a.2 FSIA 1976; Section 3 
SIA 1978. 
138 Schreuer (n 135) 8. 
139 Alebeek (n 134) 566-567.  



37  

 
‘All these countries [United Kingdom, France, Germany], in grappling with the needs to 

constrain the acts of foreign sovereigns by the rule of law, have developed roughly similar 

responses that are collectively described by the rubric of the “restrictive theory of state 

immunity.” A closer examination of the details of the several approaches to foreign state 

immunity described here demonstrates, however, that consensus exist only at a higher level of 

abstraction.   

‘… [T]he details of foreign state immunity in the law of any state still bear a greater 

resemblance to that state’s law of domestic sovereign immunity than they do to any supposed 

international consensus on the rules of foreign state immunity … [H]owever precisely the law 

of foreign immunity of a state—whether legislatively or judicially created—might appear, 

courts have exhibited, at times, an inescapable need to fashion vague exceptions, permitting 

them to avoid hearing politically sensitive cases. Likewise, one should not be surprised that 

multinational treaties are no more definitive on the details of state immunity than is state 

practice.’140 

 

Dellapenna’s conclusions are indeed consistent with what one would expect in the 

light of the historical development of the law of state immunity, a process in which 

domestic courts and domestic law had a central role.141  

 

2.2.4 Immunity from execution 

 

Suffice it to say for the purposes of this monograph that immunity from execution 

is a separate issue and is governed by different principles and rules than immunity from 

jurisdiction. The ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State stated that ‘… the immunity 

from enforcement enjoyed by States in regard to their property situated on foreign territory 

goes further than the jurisdictional immunity enjoyed by those same States before foreign 

courts.’142 The ILC’s Commentaries on the Draft Articles on Jurisdictional Immunities of 

States and Their Property summarized the subject in the following way: 

 
‘The practice of States has evidenced several theories in support of immunity from execution 

as separate rom and not interconnected with immunity from jurisdiction. Whatever the theories 

… the question of immunity from execution does not arise until after the question of 

jurisdictional immunity has been decided in the negative and until there is a judgment in favour

38  

of the plaintiff. Immunity from execution may be viewed, therefore, as the last bastion of State 

immunity.’143  

 

2.3 The impact of human rights on the law of state immunity 

 

It goes without saying that law feeds on societal changes. This was precisely the 

premise of one of Wolfgang Friedmann’s major works, ie ‘… that the extent of the 

structural changes in international relations in our times requires a far more basic 

reorientation of our thinking in international law.’144 What Friedmann had in mind was that 

changes in the nature and in the structure of international society reflected on international 

law. Friedmann described that parallel to the international law of coexistence, an 

international law of cooperation had developed. The former aims at the ‘… the regulation 

of the conditions of mutual diplomatic intercourse and, in particular, of the rules of mutual 

respect for national sovereignty’ 145 ; whilst the latter represents ‘… [a] move of 

international society, from an essentially negative code of rules of abstention to positive 

rules of co-operation, however fragmentary in the present state of world politics…’, 

resulting from the ever growing ‘range of universal human concerns calling for 

international regulation’146. Friedmann stressed that the emergence of an international law 

of cooperation affected the international law of coexistence, but that it did not mean that 

the international law of coexistence had lost its relevance and validity.  

Joseph Weiler explained the changes undergone by international law through his 

metaphor of the geology of international law. According to him, these changes could be 

captured by the analysis of the different ‘layers’ of international law in the same fashion as 

geology folds.147 Weiler stresses that, in contrast to the classical historical method that

147 Joseph Weiler, ‘The Geology of International Law – Governance, Democracy and Legitimacy’ (2004) 64 
ZaöRV 548, 549-550. Weiler further explain his metaphor by describing the ‘evolution’ of treaty making in 
the twentieth century:  
 

‘In the first decade of the 20th century one discovers a predominance of bilateral, contractual 
treaties and a very limited number of multilateral law making treaties. One also discovers, in 
that earlier part of the century, a very sedate, almost “magisterial”, and backward looking 
practice of customary law … In mid-century one discovers a huge enterprise of actual and in-
the-making multilateral law making treaties ranging from the Law of the Sea to Human Rights 
and even what may be called “constitutional” treaties. Customary law reincarnates itself into 



39  

privileges periodization and linearity, geology underscores accretion and the interaction 

between different strata.148 The geological perspective is a very useful lens through which 

one can examine the changes undergone by international law. As highlighted by Weiler, 

‘… geology allows us to speak not so much about transformations but of layering, of 

change which is part of continuity, of new strata which do not replace earlier ones, but 

simply layer themselves alongside’149. 

Being, according to Friedmann, one of the examples of the law of coexistence, the 

law of state immunity––traditionally understood as a corollary of the sovereign equality of 

states––would be located in the lower strata of international law.150  

Indeed, the principle par in parem non habet imperium has old roots: Bartolus de 

Saxoferrato’s Tractatus de regimine civitatis, which dates from the fourteenth century, 

mentions it.151 It was employed by him in a different context and only later it would 

receive a different interpretation in the context of the doctrine of state immunity, which 

gained proper form and content from the nineteenth century onwards.152 Although it may

numbers are in the hundred) as well as the new WTO and associated agreements, and in other 
similar fields: Environment, Asylum, Finance.’

‘Using Joe Weiler’s metaphor of the geology of international law, one could say that the law of 
state immunity is rooted deep in the lower layers of public international law where maxims 
like par in parem non habet imperium of Bartolus de Sassoferato played an important role in 
justifying that one state has no jurisdiction over the other. 
‘Have new strata changed the nature of the law on state immunity? …’ 

 
151 Stoll (n 1) para 4 and Moursi Badr (n 80) 94.  
152 As explained by Gamal Moursi Badr (n 80) 94 (footnotes omitted):  
 

‘[The maxim par in parem non habet imperium] comes from the pen of the fourteenth century 
Italian jurist Bartolus. Cited in full it reads “Non enim una civitas potest facere legem super 
alteram, quia par in parem non habet imperium”. The mention of civitas would indicate that 
what Bartolus had in mind were state-to-state relationships, probably the only kind of a state’s 
transnational relations which was of any importance in his time. Every state is doubtless the 
peer of every other state at the level of the interaction of supreme political authorities, not to 
say sovereignties, and no jurisdiction may, or indeed can, be exercised by one state over 
another at that level. When, however, a state enters into private law relations with individuals 
or corporations in another state, it is no longer acting in the rarefied atmosphere of the 
acephalous pseudo-society of states. … To say that par in parem non habet imperium and to 
mean thereby that the foreign state should be immune from the jurisdiction of the local courts 



40  

seem to the casual observer that it has frozen, the law of state immunity, to use the 

expression of Sompong Sucharitkul, is a ‘living reality’.153 At the time Friedmann wrote 

his book, which was first published in 1964, he noted the developments in the law of state 

immunity related to the assumption of new economic responsibilities by states:  

 
‘… certain rules, notably those dealing with the immunity of foreign governments from 

jurisdiction, have been considerably affected by the assumption of governments of economic 

responsibilities not contemplated when these rules were evolved. But the need to qualify the 

rule of absolute immunity with respect to commercial enterprises conducted by governments or 

governmental institutions was first acknowledged by the Belgian Cour de Cassation in 1903. 

State ownership and control of commercial enterprises, notably in shipping and other means of 

international transport, is spread throughout the world and a vast variety of states and political 

systems.’154 

 

According to Rosalyn Higgins, more recently, transformations in the law of state 

immunity have been caused by developments linked to the changing character of 

international law from a system providing benefits only for states to a system increasingly 

concerned with the protection of individuals.155 Bruno Simma referred to the movement 

from the classical, ‘horizontal’ and bilateral, conception of international law towards a 

more ‘vertical’ one, driven by community values and more hierarchical and densely 

institutionalized, ie a movement from ‘bilateralism to community interest’.156 Important 

elements in this regard are the concepts of jus cogens (enshrined in Articles 53, 64, and 71 

of the VCLT) and obligations erga omnes, and Article 103 of the UN Charter. According 

to Antônio Augusto Cançado Trindade, these elements point towards the construction of an 

international ordre public and a new jus gentium for the twenty-first century.157 Bröhmer 

summarized this process in the following way: 

 

                                                                                                                                              
in respect of those relationships shifts the focus of the problem and ignores its true nature to 
the detriment of a juridically correct solution.’

‘… international law has developed from a set of rules governing (only) the relationship of 

states to one that attempts to increase the protection of the individual as well, directly by giving 

more weight to human rights and indirectly by establishing rules which are considered 

peremptory (jus cogens) and which go beyond the bilateral relations of states to constitute 

“obligations erga omnes”, meaning that these “are concerns of all states”, and that all states 

“have a legal interest in their protection”.’158 

 

The development of the body of human rights law has been remarkable. In the 

well-known formulation of Norberto Bobbio regarding the evolution of the discipline, 

besides the increase in the number of rights deemed worthy of protection and the 

emergence of new subjects, individuals started to be perceived in the light of the special 

characteristics they possess.159 This is why, following the conclusion of the UN Charter in 

1945, the adoption of the UDHR in 1948 and of the two International Covenants of 1966 

on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which, 

together, are the keystones of the international architecture of human rights at the universal 

level, more human rights treaties were concluded setting up special systems of protection, 

with the scope of safeguarding the rights of specific groups of people, including the 1979 

Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the 1989 

Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 1990 International Convention on the 

Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and the 

2007 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Regional developments, like 

the ACHR, the ECHR, and other regional treaties and protocols, went even further with the 

establishment of international tribunals with jurisdiction over cases in which the 

contracting state has breached human rights provisions set out in each system of 

protection. Most notably, Protocol 11 to the ECHR abolished the European Commission of

‘Oltre ai processi di positivizzazione, generalizzazione, internazionalizzazione … si è 
manifestata in questi ultimi anni una nuova linea di tendenza che si può chiamare di 
specificazione, consistente nel passaggio graduale ma sempre più accentuato verso un’ulteriore 
determinazione dei soggetti titolari di diritti. 
‘… 
‘Così rispetto all’astratto soggetto uomo, che aveva già trovato una specificazione nel              
« cittadino » (nel senso che al cittadino potevano essere attribuiti diritti ulteriori rispetto 
all’uomo in generale), si è fatta valere l’esigenza di rispondere con ulteriore specificazione alla 
domanda: quale uomo, quale cittadino? 
Questa specificazione è avvenuta sia rispetto al genere, sia rispetto alle varie fasi della vita, sia 
tenendo conto della differenza tra stato normale e stati eccezionali nell’esistenza umana.’

Human Rights and allowed individuals to bring claims directly to the ECtHR, further 

empowering the position of the human being vis-à-vis the state. Within the framework of 

the Inter-American system, individuals have to petition the Inter-American Commission on 

Human Rights, which may refer the case to the IACtHR. 

In the light of the geological perspective, these phenomena would better be 

described as the accretion and thickening of the legislative and constitutional strata of 

international law. Said strata, as described by Weiler, have as a distinctive feature the 

appropriation of common assets, be it material (eg, the deep bed of the high sea) or, in the 

case of the international law of human rights, spiritual.160 The pressures exerted by ‘the 

common spiritual asset’ of human rights and jus cogens on the law of state immunity have 

been felt and have called into question its legitimacy. Ian Brownlie, in 1978, famously 

compared jus cogens to ‘… [a] vehicle [that] does not often leave the garage’, adding that 

‘… the concept does not seem to have a lot of obvious relevance.’161 Lately, though, said 

vehicle has been leaving the garage and bumping into state immunity quite often, as can be 

demonstrated by numerous cases in which there has been an opposition between, on one 

hand, state immunity and, on the other, human rights and jus cogens, and by numerous 

articles and book chapters that have been published on the subject.  

 

2.4 Concluding remarks 

 

It is generally accepted that state immunity is required in some cases as a matter of 

customary international law and that it is now restricted. There have been many different 

attempts to reconceptualize state immunity and to provide a more solid theoretical basis for 

it, and the foundations of the law of state immunity remain a contentious issue. The 

expansion of the human rights regime is a development that impacted and posed new 

challenges to the traditional domain of the law of state immunity. 

In the following chapter of this monograph, I shall consider how national and 

international courts dealt with cases relating to state immunity and the protection of human 

rights, ie how courts perceived and understood the pressures exerted by human rights on 

the law of state immunity.

3 — THE JUDICIAL PRACTICE 
 

 

 

 

 

‘In the international rule system, as in most national legal systems, the law accords a 

particular veneration to rules which have withstood the test of time. Age is respected in 

laws even more than in persons, in both cases not always deservedly. Even unjust old 

rules, however, have a high degree of compliance pull just because, being old, they are 

thought to be like the beams of an old house. Their legitimacy may be what holds up the 

whole structure and to remove them may jeopardize that structure.’

alone may start the process. Others may follow. At first a trickle, then a stream, last a 

flood.’

 In this chapter, I shall take a close look at the judicial decisions dealing with state 

immunity, human rights and jus cogens. The main goal was to identify the reasoning 

processes employed to reach the decisions. Although all the cases selected deal with the 

same subject-matter, each court is immersed in a different normative environment. I tried 

to be careful not to adopt a quantitative approach in the analyses of the cases, merely 

taking account of the outcomes without doing justice to the peculiarities of each case. It is 

important to keep in mind that not only technical questions of jurisdiction and applicable 



44  

law differ among the courts, but also the environment in which their practices are 

embedded. They do not address the same audiences, nor do their concerns necessarily 

coincide.  

The reference point adopted to structure this chapter was the decision of the ICJ in 

Jurisdictional Immunities of the State, due to the authoritativeness, prestige and influence 

accorded to its pronouncements. I begin by examining the judgments of domestic courts 

(Greece, Italy, Germany, France, Poland, the United States, the United Kingdom and 

Canada) and international courts (the ECtHR) rendered before Jurisdictional Immunities of 

the State. The chapter moves next to the decision of the ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of 

the State, and then to the national (Italy) and international (the ECtHR) decisions rendered 

after it. It ends with a brief assessment of the panorama revealed by the discussions 

engaged in by the courts in the various judgments.  

The judgment of the ICJ was the main guide to select the cases I discuss in this 

chapter. Nevertheless, not all cases mentioned by the ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of 

the State are individually considered here. Taking as reference this judgment, I tried to 

select a sample of cases that is representative of the main different argumentative patterns, 

strategies and approaches of the legal debate surrounding the relationship between state 

immunity and human rights.1 An article written by Filippo Fontanelli was useful to locate 

the relevant decisions rendered by the Italian Court of Cassation after the judgment of the 

ICJ.2  

Attention is devoted not only to the final decisions adopted by the courts, but also 

to some dissenting and separate opinions which were appended to them. Furthermore, as 

regards cases from domestic jurisdictions, emphasis was given to the pronouncements of 

the higher courts of each judicial system. Decisions from lower courts were also included 

when I had access to them and they were deemed to be significant to the debate (for

instance, when the reasoning and result they reached contrasted with those adopted by 

higher courts or when they inspired in a significant manner other decisions). 

Jones v Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (decided by English courts) and Jones v United 

Kingdom (decided by the ECtHR) deal not only with the subject of the immunity ratione 

personae of the state itself, but also with the immunity ratione materiae of state officials. 

Nevertheless, it was decided to include in the analyses of these cases the parts of these 

judgments that deal with the immunity ratione materiae of state officials due to the 

treatment the English courts and the ECtHR gave to this issue, operating what could be 

called an alignment of the immunity ratione materiae of state officials with the immunity 

ratione personae of the state itself.3

states’, and not to ‘private law (contractual) acts or activities of the foreign state’.5 The 

qualification of an act as jure imperii or as jure gestionis, in the view of Court, was left to 

the lex fori, ie ‘… by the courts of the state considering the relevant dispute, pursuant to its 

domestic law as influenced by international conventions and the international context, 

subject to the condition of reciprocity.’6 The Court of Levadia added that, even for acta 

jure gestionis,  ‘… if the relevant judicial acts may impinge upon the sovereign acts of the 

defendant state … the state immunity privilege is also extended to them’7. 

The Court proceeded to examine whether the peculiarities of the case impacted on 

the application of the law of state immunity. It found that the fact the territory where the 

events took place was occupied by Germany did not affect sovereignty, but meant only ‘… 

a temporary change in the subject exercising sovereignty, namely the occupier, who is 

obligated to respect, during the occupation, both the domestic legislation of the occupied 

state … and the rules of international law …’8. In a bold move inspired by the case law of 

the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal, the Multi-Member Court of Levadia found 

that, as regards the relationship between state immunity and jus cogens,  

 
‘… [a]ccording to the prevailing in contemporary theory and practice of international law 

opinion, to which this Court also subscribes, it is accepted that the state cannot invoke 

immunity when the act attributed to it has been perpetrated in breach of a ius cogens rule. In 

this case it is also accepted that the defendant state has indirectly waived immunity…’9 

 

The Court summarized its understanding in the following way: 

 
‘a) When a state is in breach of peremptory rules of international law, it cannot lawfully expect 

to be granted the right of immunity. Consequently, it is deemed to have tacitly waived such 

right (constructive waiver through the operation of international law); b) Acts of the state in 

breach of peremptory international law cannot qualify as sovereign acts of state. In such cases 

the defendant state is not considered as acting within its capacity as sovereign; c) Acts contrary 

to peremptory international law are null and void and cannot give rise to lawful rights, such as 

immunity (in application of the general principles ex iniuria ius non oritur); d) the recognition 

of immunity for an act contrary to peremptory international law would amount to complicity of 

the national court to the promotion of an act strongly condemned by the international public

order; e) The invocation of immunity for acts committed in breach of a peremptory norm of 

international law would constitute abuse of right; and finally f) Given that the principle of 

territorial sovereignty, as a fundamental rule of the international legal order, supersedes the 

principle of immunity, a state in breach of the former when in illegal occupation of foreign 

territory, cannot possible invoke the principle of immunity for acts committed during such 

illegal military occupation … .’10 

 

The Multi-Member Court of Levadia concluded that the acts perpetrated by 

Germany could not be qualified as sovereign acts because they were allegedly in breach of 

international peremptory rules––in particular, the rule enshrined in Article 46 of the 

Regulations on the Laws and Customs of War on Land attached to the 1907 Hague IV 

Convention, which provides that  

 
‘[f]amily honour and rights, the lives of persons, and private property, as well as religious 

convictions and practice, must be respected. 

‘Private property cannot be confiscated.’11 

 

The Court found the suit to be lawful grounded on Article 3 of the 1907 Hague 

Convention (IV), according to which ‘[a] belligerent party which violates the provisions of 

the said Regulations shall, if the case demands, be liable to pay compensation. It shall be 

responsible for all acts committed by persons forming part of its armed forces.’12 Although 

Greece had not ratified the 1907 Hague Convention (IV), the Court found that it was 

opposable to Germany because its norms were binding on the basis of customary 

international law.13 

 

3.1.1.1.2 Judgment No 11 of the Greek Court of Cassation (Areios Pagos) (2000) 

 

Germany appealed the decision of the Multi-Member Court of Levadia. The Greek 

Court of Cassation (Areios Pagos) delivered its judgment on 4 May 2000 and the appeal 

was ultimately dismissed by seven votes to four.

48  

The Areios Pagos began its decision by recalling Article 38 of the Statute of the ICJ 

and by referencing the traditional understanding of custom, according to which customary 

international law is composed of two elements: ‘constant and uniform’ practice and the 

conviction that this practice corresponds to a legal obligation (opinio jure sive 

necessitatis).14 It also recalled Article 28.1 of the Greek Constitution, according to which  

 
‘[t]he generally recognised rules of international law, as well as international conventions as of 

the time they are ratified by statute and become operative according to their respective 

conditions, shall be an integral part of domestic Greek law and shall prevail over any contrary 

provision of the law. The rules of international law and of international conventions shall be 

applicable to aliens only under the condition of reciprocity.’15 

 

By means of this provision, customary international law is part of the Greek legal 

order. Having established the relationship between international law and Greek domestic 

law, the Areios Pagos proceeded to ascertain customary international law on the subject of 

state immunity. It considered that ‘sovereign immunity constitutes a consequence of the 

sovereignty, independence and equality of nations, whilst its aim is to avoid the 

disturbance of international relations’16.  

Like the Multi-Member Court of Levadia, it stated that the international community 

accepted the restrictive theory of state immunity and that the distinction between acts jure 

imperii and jure gestionis ‘… is made on the basis of the law of the forum State and the 

criterion for making this distinction is the nature of the act of the foreign State, meaning 

whether the act itself involves the exercise of sovereign power.’17 

The Areios Pagos went a step further than the Multi-Member Court of Levadia and 

examined what it called the tendency to further limit the immunity of foreign states. To do 

so, it firstly examined the ECSI 1972. The low number of ratifications, in the Areios 

Pagos’ view, should not be understood as a sign there was disagreement on its basic 

principles.18 The Areios Pagos considered the ECSI a ‘codifying convention’19. Article 11 

of the ECSI, as is known, lays down the tort exception to state immunity.20

The tort exception, according to the Areios Pagos, applied irrespective of whether 

the tort was committed by a state acting jure imperii or jure gestionis and was part of 

customary international law, ‘… which, in accordance with Article 28(1) of the 

Constitution, constitutes an integral part of national [Greek] law with superior rank.’21  

The Areios Pagos came to this conclusion by ascertaining customary international 

law in a very conventional fashion. After the reference to Article 11 of the ECSI, it verified 

that the domestic legislations of states that had codified the law of state immunity provided 

for said exception. 22  In the same way, it found that the ILC’s Draft Articles on 

Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property enshrined in its Article 12 an 

exception from immunity with respect to the tortious liability of foreign states.23 The 

interpretative comments attached to the ILC’s Draft Articles added that the exception 

proposed did not make a distinction between acta jure imperii and jure gestionis, but noted 

that it was not meant to apply to ‘situations involving armed conflicts.’24 The Areios Pagos 

then mentioned the Resolution adopted by the IDI in 1991 in Basel (‘Contemporary

Enforcement’) also provided for the tort exception in Article 2.2.e.25 Lastly, it referenced 

the case-law of the United States courts26, which also provided a basis for the conclusion 

that the tort exception was part of customary international law. In any case, the Areios 

Pagos held the tort exception was not applicable  

 
‘… in relation to claims for damages arising [from military action] in situations of armed 

conflict, which generally involve conflict between States where harm to civilians necessarily 

results and where resultant claims are normally dealt with through inter-State agreements after 

the war has ended.’27  

 

In the next step of the argument, and basing itself on Article 43 of the Regulations 

on the Laws and Customs of War on Land annexed to the Fourth Hague Convention of 

1907, according to which, in case of military occupation, sovereignty is not transferred to 

the occupying state, which must respect the laws in force in the country, the Areios Pagos 

noted that  

 
‘… the [tort] exception to the immunity rule should apply where the offences for which 

compensation is sought (especially crimes against humanity) did not target civilians generally, 

but specific individuals in a given place who were neither directly nor indirectly connected 

with the military operations. 

‘… [E]xtraterritoriality (State immunity) does not cover the criminal acts of the organs of such 

an occupying force, where they are committed as an abuse of sovereign power, in retaliation 

for acts of sabotage by resistance groups, against a specific and relatively limited number of 

completely uninvolved and innocent civilians, something which is anyway contrary to the 

principle, generally accepted by civilized nations, that no one should be punished for the acts 

of someone else…’28

51  

Although acts of armed forces in situations of armed conflict were considered to be 

covered by state immunity, the Areios Pagos found that in the case in question this was not 

applicable because 

 
‘… these crimes (of murder which, at the same time, constituted crimes against humanity) 

were committed against specific persons of relatively limited number, living in a specific 

place, who had absolutely no connection to the resistance group which, within the framework 

of its resistance action, was responsible for the killing of the disguised German soldiers 

participating in the operation to terrify the local population. These cruel murders were 

objectively in any case not necessary for the conservation of the military occupation or to 

reduce the resistance action and were carried out on the territory of the State of the forum, by 

organs of the Third Reich, in excess of their sovereign powers.’29 

 

Finally, as a further argument to deny state immunity to Germany, the Areios Pagos 

mentioned the argument employed by the Multi-Member Court of Levadia, according to 

which the breach of jus cogens norms could be understood as a tacit waver of the right of 

immunity.30  

 

3.1.1.1.2.1 The dissenting opinions appended to the judgment of the Greek Court of 

Cassation (Areios Pagos) in Judgment No 11 (2000) 

 

Five out of the eleven judges of the Areios Pagos appended a dissenting opinion to 

the judgment.  

The dissenting judges called into question the ascertainment of customary 

international law by the majority of the Areios Pagos. Firstly, unlike the majority, which 

treated the ECSI as a ‘codifying Convention’, the dissenting judges took the position that 

the ECSI ‘… [did] not constitute in all its provisions a codification of previously 

formulated customary international law.’31  They highlighted the tort exception to state 

immunity, as embodied in the ECSI, did not apply to torts arising from armed conflicts and 

that the ILC’s Commentaries on the Draft Articles noted Article 12 also did not apply to 

‘situations involving armed conflicts’. 32 The dissenting judges questioned the use of

52  

domestic law in the process of deducing customary international law––in their view, the 

fact that some states had codified the tort exception to state immunity was of no 

consequence in this respect.33 Consequently, they deemed the decisions of the courts of the 

United States invoked by the majority to be irrelevant, since they were grounded on 

domestic legislation.34  

The dissenting judges also pointed out that the ILC’s Draft Articles on 

Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property and the resolution adopted by the IDI 

in 1991 in Basel (‘Contemporary Problems Concerning the Immunity of States in Relation 

to Questions of Jurisdiction and Enforcement’) could not be used as evidence of a 

customary norm establishing an exception to state immunity for torts committed jure 

imperii in the territory of the forum state—quite to the contrary, they pointed to the lack of 

state consent regarding the subject, since there did not exist at the time a treaty embodying 

their provisions.35  

The dissenting judges referenced the Draft Articles on Sovereign Immunity for 

American States (1983), which did not extend the tort exception to acta jure imperii.36 

Finally, the dissenting judges indicated the practice of the English courts in I Congresso 

del Partido (1983) and in Kuwait Airways Corporation v. Iraqi Airways (1995) as 

examples in which it was recognized state immunity should be granted with respect to torts 

committed jure imperii.37  

Four out of the five dissenting judges also disagreed with respect to the majority’s 

interpretation of the armed conflict clause. According to them, the armed conflict clause 

should be applicable to the case, since 

 
‘… [a]ttempts to break down armed conflicts into different phases, some considered as falling 

within and some as falling outside the notion of armed conflict, are artificial and do not 

correspond to reality … [I]t should be accepted that States enjoy immunity from all claims 

arising from a situation of general conflict between countries. This interpretation is supported 

by the fact that, despite the many recent wars and many atrocities carried out during them, 

there do not appear to have been any successful judicial claims for damages anywhere in the 

world and, in particular, relying on an exception to the rule of immunity.’38

They also added that they disagreed the infringement of a jus cogens norm could be 

understood as a tacit waiver of the right of immunity, ‘… given that there [was] no 

customary rule establishing that such an infringement [constituted] a tacit waiver of State 

immunity.’39 

 

3.1.1.2 Judgment of the Greek Special Supreme Court (Anotato Eidiko Dikastirio) in 

Germany v Margellos and Others (2002)  

 

In Germany v Margellos and others, the Areios Pagos referred to the Anotato 

Eidiko Dikastirio (AED) two questions dealing with the issue of state immunity and 

individual claims for torts committed jure imperii in the territory of the forum state: (i) 

whether Article 11 of the ECSI could be qualified as a generally accepted rule of 

international law; and (ii) whether the exception provided for in said article ‘… [covered], 

according to international custom, claims for compensation for torts arising from situations 

of armed conflict yet encompassing only certain persons at a certain location having 

nothing to do with the armed conflict and not involved in the war activity’40.  

Article 100.1.f of the Greek Constitution gives the AED jurisdiction for ‘… [t]he 

settlement of controversies related to the designation of rules of international law as 

generally acknowledged in accordance with article 28 paragraph 1.’41 Article 28.1 of the 

Greek Constitution, as referred before, establishes that ‘[t]he generally recognised rules of 

international law … shall be an integral part of domestic Greek law and shall prevail over 

any contrary provision of the law.’42 The AED followed a textbook approach to the 

ascertainment of customary rules. It referenced Article 38.1 of the ICJ Statute and stated 

that, to conclude whether a rule of customary international law existed, it could use as 

evidence  

 
‘[i]nternational conventions, records and correspondence of international organizations, the 

case-law of international and domestic courts, state legislation, diplomatic correspondence and

54  

advisory opinions of international organizations and States counsel as well as codification 

workings by international organizations, committees and international law institutes…’.43  

 

The AED emphasized that its task was to ‘… demonstrate the existence of a rule 

with the complete and specific meaning that this rule has within the international legal 

order’ and that ‘any further power … to interpret this rule is limited and is exercised in 

terms of the aforementioned meaning.’ 44  In other words, the AED expressed the 

understanding that its task was not creative in nature.  

The AED began the analysis of the legal questions submitted to it by analyzing 

Article 3 45  of the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and Articles 46 46  and 50 47  of the 

Regulations attached to this Convention. Greece was not a party to said treaty, but the 

AED accepted the provisions contained therein codified customary international law. The 

aforementioned Articles read together, according to the AED, established ‘… an obligation 

for compensation when acts of the occupying army took place in the territory of that State 

in violation of the laws of war upon the population of the occupied belligerent.’48 What 

was being discussed, however, was not state responsibility itself. As the AED pointed out, 

the rules enshrined in the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) and in the Regulations attached to 

it did not discipline ‘… the means of paying such compensation, nor whether it [would] be 

paid following an international agreement or directly to the injured, nor even [regulated] 

the issue of the competent court for the adjudication of such compensation, adjudicating 

individual law-suits by the injured addressed to the State responsible.’49

55  

In order to investigate the relationship between state immunity and individual tort 

claims, the AED produced a summary of the sources of law it had to take into account:  

 
‘Legal information by the Hellenic Institute of International and Foreign Law, the judgment of 

the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) McElhinney v. Ireland and Al-Adsani v. United 

Kingdom issued on 21 November 2002; the judgment of the International Court of Justice 

issued on 14 February 2002; documents of international conventions, such as the … Basle 

Convention and its preparatory workings; the text and preparatory workings of the draft 

Convention on State Immunity, adopted by the United Nations International Law Committee in 

1991, which has not been adopted as yet; the workings and comments by international law 

experts being reported in the decisions of the International Law Institute in its Conference in 

Basle in 1991; legislation of foreign states and mostly the relevant laws of the United States of 

America, United Kingdom and the laws of other States with similar content; the case-law of 

foreign courts; textbooks, studies and advisory opinions of experts from various States and 

types of legal order.’50  

 

The AED did not undertake a discussion of the international jurisprudence it 

mentioned. Following the ECtHR in McElhinney v Ireland, it accepted that there was no 

exception for immunity in cases in which the foreign state is being sued for torts 

committed jure imperii by its organs in the territory of the forum state.51 It also did not 

question the position taken by the ECHR in Al-Adsani v United Kingdom according to 

which a foreign state has the right to immunity even for acts committed in violation of jus 

cogens. In the same manner, it took note of the ICJ judgment in Arrest Warrant, in which 

it was upheld that, under customary international law, an incumbent Foreign Minister 

enjoyed immunity from criminal jurisdiction even where they are suspected of having 

committed war crimes and crimes against humanity.52  

The AED added that, regardless of the cases mentioned, by analyzing the other 

sources of law available, it would arrive at the same conclusion, namely 

 
‘… that at the present stage of international law development a generally acknowledged rule of 

international law, that allows, in exemption to immunity, to admissibly bring an action against 

a State before the courts of another State for compensation from any type of tort that took place 

in the territory of the forum and in which the armed forces of the defendant State are involved

56  

in any way, either in peace or in time of war, has not yet emerged … the Court reaches the 

conclusion that the foreign State is still enjoying the privilege of immunity, when sued for 

actions that took place in the territory of the forum and in which its armed forces were in any 

way implicated, without a further distinction as to whether these acts violate ius cogens or its 

armed forces were or not involved in an armed conflict with other armed parties. 

‘… Since a rule that allows for the lifting of immunity in cases of civil responsibility of states 

deriving from armed conflicts has been formulated neither in a legal text nor as a fact, it is not 

allowed to the Court, as set out in a previous thought, either to formulate such a rule for the 

first time or to deduce its existence, without invoking specific evidence from international 

practice; nor can the Court derive the existence of such a rule by interpreting solely the 

principle of the State’s obligation to pay compensation in case of breach of the laws of war on 

land.’53  

 

In the AED’s view, Article 31 of ECSI, according to which no provision of it ‘… 

shall affect any immunities or privileges enjoyed by a Contracting State in respect of 

anything done or omitted to be done by, or in relation to, its armed forces when on the 

territory of another Contracting State’54, was justified ‘… from the necessity to respect the 

sovereignty of the foreign State, the main expression of which are acts carried out by its 

armed forces.’55  The Court further stressed that respect to sovereignty was ‘… the 

foundation of equality between States and consequently of the harmonious international 

relations, which is the goal of all principles of international law.’56  

Much like the ICJ in Arrest Warrant, when it emphasized that the immunity from 

jurisdiction enjoyed by an incumbent Foreign Minister did not equal impunity in respect of 

crimes they may have committed,57 the AED also underlined that the recognition of 

immunity in favor of a foreign state did not mean the preclusion of the international 

responsibility of the state.58

3.1.1.2.1 The dissenting opinion appended to the judgment of the Greek Special 

Supreme Court (Anotato Eidiko Dikastirio) in Germany v Margellos and Others 

(2002) 

 

Four out of the eleven judges of the AED appended a joint dissenting opinion to the 

judgment. By examining the same materials, the dissenting judges arrived at the 

conclusion it had emerged in international law a rule according to which a state is not 

under an international obligation to grant immunity to a foreign state for torts committed in 

the territory of the forum state by an author present in that territory, regardless of whether 

these torts were committed jure imperii or not.  

They articulated four arguments in support of their view. Firstly, they argued that 

Article 11 of the ECSI, Article 12 of the ILC’s Draft Convention on State Immunity, 

Article 2.2.e of the Resolution adopted by the IDI in 1991 in Basel (‘Contemporary 

Problems Concerning the Immunity of States in Relation to Questions of Jurisdiction and 

Enforcement’) and Article III of the International Law Association’s Revised Draft 

Articles for a Convention on State Immunity all provided for a ‘tort exception’ clause.59 

Secondly, they pointed out that the same rule could be found in the statutes of states that 

codified the law of state immunity.60 Thirdly, they asserted that their understanding was 

backed up by the ECtHR’s McElhinney case and the Areios Pagos’ judgment in the 

Distomo Massacre case. According to the dissenting judges, both the majority and the 

dissenting judges in McElhinney recognized ‘… sovereign immunity of States does not 

prevail over the respective rights of persons both in international law and comparative law 

in case of material damages due to an act or omission that took place in the State of the 

forum by either the State or persons for which the State is responsible.’61   

The dissenting judges did perhaps a very generous reading of the position taken by 

the majority of the ECtHR, since the ECtHR in McElhinney referred to ‘a trend in 

international and comparative law towards limiting State immunity in respect of personal

1982, Article 6), Australia (FSIA of 1985, Article 13), South Africa (FSIA of 1981, Article 6) 
and Singapore (SIA of 1979, Article 7).’ 

 
61 ibid 205-206. 



58  

injury caused by an act or omission within the forum State’ and remarked that ‘… this 

practice is by no means universal.’62 The majority of the ECHR also noted that ‘… this 

trend may primarily refer to “insurable” personal injury’ and that it could not be said that 

‘… Ireland is alone in holding that immunity attaches to suits in respect of such torts 

committed by acta jure imperii or that, in affording this immunity, Ireland falls outside any 

currently accepted international standards.’63  

Lastly, the dissenting judges did a different reading of Article 31 of the ECSI, 

which reinstates the rule of state immunity ‘… in respect of anything done or omitted to be 

done by, or in relation to, its armed forces when on the territory of another Contracting 

State.’64 According to the dissenting judges, this provision ‘… refers to the presence of 

armed forces of a contracting State in the territory of another contracting State under 

regular circumstances tolerated by the latter’, thus it would not include a situation as the 

one presented to the Court, in which the territory of the forum state was illegally occupied 

and war crimes were perpetrated by the armed forces of a foreign state.65 The dissenting 

judges added, as a side argument, that war crimes were forbidden by the rules of the 1907 

Hague Convention (IV), which, in their view, have the character of jus cogens and created 

a direct obligation for the responsible state to pay compensation for injured individuals.66   

In sum, the main argument of the dissenting judges was that the tort exception was 

a rule of customary international law which could be applied regardless of whether the acts 

in question were categorized or not as jure imperii. They also considered it irrelevant that 

the acts discussed were committed by armed forces because they were war crimes and 

could not fall under the meaning of ‘armed conflict’.67

3.1.2.1 Judgment of the Italian Court of Cassation in Ferrini v Germany (2004) 

 

On 23 September 1998, Mr Luigi Ferrini initiated civil proceedings against 

Germany before the Tribunale di Arezzo.69 Mr Ferrini demanded reparations due to the 

damages he suffered for having been captured by the German Armed Forces on 4 August 

1944 and subsequently deported to Germany, where he was submitted to forced labor until 

20 April 1945.70 The Tribunale di Arezzo decided it had no jurisdiction because Germany 

had practiced those acts in its capacity as a sovereign, having as a consequence the right to 

immunity as established in customary international law.71 Mr Ferrini appealed to the Corte 

d’appello di Firenze, which confirmed the judgment of the Tribunale di Arezzo. 

Subsequently, he appealed to the Court of Cassation.72 

The Court of Cassation held that there could be no doubt regarding the existence of 

a norm of customary international providing for an obligation to abstain from exercising 

jurisdiction over foreign states and that this rule was given effect in the Italian legal system 

by virtue of Article 10.1 of the Italian Constitution, which establishes that ‘[l’]ordinamento 

giuridico italiano si conforma alle norme del diritto internazionale generalmente 

riconosciute.’73 At the same time, the Court recognized the scope of this principle was 

being progressively restricted.74  

The Court took the position the acts upon which the claim was based were 

undoubtedly an expression of Germany’s ‘potestà d’imperi’. However, in the Court’s view, 

these acts separated this case from others it had considered—due to their ‘estrema gravità’, 

the acts under consideration were ‘in forza di norme consuetudinarie di diritto

only the original contents of the decisions in full, but also summaries and analyses of the cases written by

internazionale, quali crimini internazionali, in quanto lesivi di valori universali che 

trascendono gli interessi delle singole comunità statali.’75 

The next step the Court took was to establish what justified the position it adopted 

in Markovic v Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri et al. (2002) and what justified a 

different treatment for the case at hand. In Marcovic v Presidenza del Consiglio dei 

Ministri et al., the Court adjudicated a claim for compensation due to damages suffered as 

a result of a deliberate air strike by NATO forces in Yugolasvia against the facilities of the 

RTS (Radio Television of Serbia), which resulted in the death of relatives of the 

applicants. The applicants argued Italy was liable for the damages because, as a member of 

NATO, it had taken part in the decision concerning the airstrike and because the actions 

had started in its territory.76 The Court of Cassation declined jurisdiction because, among 

other reasons, it considered the choice of a particular way of conducting hostilities was the 

manifestation of a political function against which the situation of an individual’s protected 

interests could not be opposed and therefore it could not be subjected to judicial review: 

‘alle funzioni di tipo politico non si contrappongono situazioni soggettive protette’.77  

It is clear Markovic v Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri et al., insofar as it dealt 

with a claim brought against the Italian State before an Italian Court, is not a case dealing 

with state immunity, but with the inadmissibility of judicial review of certain acts 

considered as political. In Ferrini v Germany, the Court pointed out said inadmissibility is 

not an obstacle to finding a crime has been committed nor to the determination of both 

criminal and civil responsibility.78 It seems, nevertheless, that in Markovic v Presidenza 

del Consiglio dei Ministri et al., the employment of the ‘political-acts’ doctrine coupled 

with the understanding there was no provision under domestic law of a right to seek 

reparation for injuries suffered as a result of the breach of certain international norms had 

this exact effect.79

The Court also observed that, by virtue of article 10.1 of the Italian Constitution, 

‘generally recognized’ international norms which protect liberty and human dignity and 

consider as ‘international crimes’ behaviors that seriously attempt against the integrity of 

these values are ‘automatically’ part of the Italian legal system and provide a standard 

whereby international and negligent ‘acts’ may be assessed.80 

The Court then proceeded to consider the status of deportation and forced labor 

under international law and it found various sources consistently considering it to be an 

international crimes, thus concluding that it was beyond doubt that, under general 

customary law binding on all components of the international community, deportation and 

forced labor were international crimes. 81  The Court of Cassation added Germany 

recognized the gravity of these crimes by creating, with the assistance of the German 

companies that benefitted from forced labor, the ‘Remembrance, Responsibility and 

Future’ Foundation (2000 Federal Law), which has the scope of keeping the memory of 

what happened and of providing the victims with compensation, as long as they meet the 

requirements established by the law.82  

Before stating its position, the Court of Cassation established an interesting 

dialogue with the decision rendered by the Greek Court of Cassation in the Distomo 

Massacre case (4 May 2000). In its decision, the Greek Court of Cassation employed the 

‘tacit waiver’ theory, according to which, by violating peremptory norms, Germany had

in caso di responsabilità (art. 91 del Protocollo; art. 41 della Convenzione), indicano le Corti

‘Le leggi che vi hanno dato applicazione nello Stato italiano non contengono per contro norme 
espresse che consentano alle persone offese di chiedere allo Stato riparazione dei danni loro 
derivati dalla violazione delle norme internazionali.

waived any benefits accorded by international law. The Court of Cassation did not 

consider this argument persuasive, because, in its understanding, it could not be implied 

from the serious breaches committed by Germany an intention to waive its jurisdictional 

immunity––in the words of the Court of Cassation: ‘… non vi è atto il quale presupponga 

necessariamente una determinata volontà. Una rinunzia non può quindi essere ipotizzata in 

astratto, ma solo riscontrata in concreto, se i fatti accertati consentono di qualificare un 

determinato contegno come “abdicativo”.’83 

The Court of Cassation pointed out the international crimes committed by Germany 

were ‘serious breaches’ of obligations arising under peremptory norms of general 

international law, in the sense given by Article 40.1 of the DARSIWA 2001, according to 

which ‘[a] breach of such an obligation is serious if it involves a gross or systematic failure 

by the responsible State to fulfill the obligation.’84 The Court stressed peremptory norms 

prevail over other norms regardless of their conventional or customary nature:  

 
‘… È ricorrente l’affermazione che i crimini internazionali « minacciano l’umanità intera e 

minano le fondamenta stesse della coesistenza internazionale » … Si tratta, infatti, di delitti che 

si concretano nella violazione, particolarmente grave per intensità o sistematicità …, dei diritti 

fondamentali della persona umana, la cui tutela è affidata a norme inderogabili che si collocano 

al vertice dell’ordinamento internazionale, prevalendo su ogni altra norma, sia di carattere 

convenzionale che consuetudinario … e, quindi, anche su quelle in tema di immunità.’85 

 

Before concluding its reasoning, the Court of Cassation mentioned other elements 

to be taken into account:86 (i) the non-applicability of statutory limitation to war crimes 

and crimes against humanity (European Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory 

Limitation to Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes 1974 and Convention on the Non-

Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity 1968); 

(ii) the existence of universal jurisdiction in regard to criminal and civil proceedings arisen 

out of these crimes, whose exercise may be compulsory (eg, Article 146 of the Geneva 

Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War 1949); (iii) 

and the duty, enshrined in Article 41 of the DARSIWA, not to ‘… recognize as lawful a

situation created by a serious breach … nor render aid or assistance in maintaining that 

situation’ and to ‘… cooperate to bring to an end through lawful means any serious 

breach…’.87 

The Court of Cassation stated that recognizing immunity for states that are 

responsible for such breaches would be in contrast with the normative data it laid out––it 

would amount to an obstacle to the protection of essential values for the whole 

international community.88  

The Court of Cassation recognized the existence of an antinomy, which, in its view, 

should be solved by giving precedence to the hierarchically superior norms. 89  It 

highlighted the dissenting opinions annexed to the judgment of the ECtHR in Al-Adsani v 

United Kingdom concurred with this reasoning.90 The Court also mentioned in this regard 

an excerpt of the judgment of the ICTY in Prosecutor v Anto Furundzija, according to 

which, as a consequence of a state adopting a measure in violation of jus cogens,  

 
‘[p]roceedings could be initiated by potential victims if they had locus standi before a 

competent international or national judicial body with a view to asking it to hold the national 

measure to be internationally unlawful; or the victim could bring a civil suit for damage in a 

foreign court, which would therefore be asked inter alia to disregard the legal value of the 

national authorising act.’91 

 

Unlike what was found in Al-Adsani v United Kingdom (ECtHR) and Bouzari v 

Islamic Republic of Iran (Ontario Superior Court of Justice), the Court of Cassation 

opposed the idea immunity had to be recognized insofar as the exception in question to it is 

not specifically provided by a legal norm.92 The Court of Cassation based this reasoning on 

the idea that legal norms cannot be interpreted in a vacuum, separately from one another:  

 
‘Il rispetto dei diritti inviolabili della persona umana ha invero assunto, ormai, il valore di 

principio fondamentale dell’ordinamento internazionale … [e] l’emersione di tale principio 

non può non riflettersi sulla portata degli altri principi ai quali tale ordinamento è

tradizionalmente ispirato e, in particolare, di quello sulla “sovrana uguaglianza” degli Stati, cui 

si ricollega il riconoscimento della immunità statale dalla giurisdizione civile straniera. 

‘Le norme giuridiche non vanno infatti interpretate le une separatamente dalle altre, poiché si 

completano e si integrano a vicenda, condizionandosi reciprocamente nella loro applicazione, 

(sentenze Al-Adsani, cit. 55; McElhinney, cit. 36). Queste decisioni fanno specifico 

riferimento alle norme convenzionali. Ma non vi è dubbio che criteri analoghi valgono per 

l’interpretazione di quelle consuetudinarie, che, non diversamente dalle altre, sono inserite in 

un sistema e possono, pertanto, essere correttamente intese solo se poste in relazione alle altre 

norme che fanno parte integrante dello stesso ordine giuridico (così ad. Es., Dichiarazione 

Universale dei diritti dell’uomo, adottata dall’Assemblea ONU il 10 dicembre 1948, articolo 

30).’93 

 

As a result of that, and of the status of the respect for inviolable human rights as a 

fundamental principle of the international legal system, the Court of Cassation concluded 

this principle impacted upon the scope of other legal principles, such as the principle of 

sovereign equality, which is linked to the recognition of state immunity from foreign civil 

jurisdiction.94 

The Court of Cassation remarked that in Al-Adsani v United Kingdom (ECtHR), in 

Bouzari v Islamic Republic of Iran (Ontario Supreme Court of Justice), and also in the 

opinion of Lord Hutton in Ex parte Pinochet (House of Lords)95, it was contended foreign 

states had the right to jurisdictional immunity with regard to claims for damages derived 

from the commission of international crimes, but added that these cases had an important 

distinction from the case at hand: they dealt with crimes that were not committed in the 

forum state.96 Indeed, these decisions were based on the assumption that any exception for 

state immunity had to be provided for in a specific legal norm, and both the United 

Kingdom’s SIA 1978 and Canada’s SIA 1985 did not provide for the possibility of 

removing immunity for torts committed outside the forum state. 

As stated before, the Court of Cassation did not share the view only a specific legal 

provision could justify a derogation from state immunity. The Court also noted that the 

practice pointed towards the overcoming of the distinction between acta jure imperii and 

acta jure gestionis (ie, the restrictive approach to state immunity), as was, in its view,

law Chile is responsible for acts of torture carried out by Senator Pinochet, but could claim state immunity if 
sued for damages for such acts in a court in the United Kingdom.’

65  

confirmed by domestic legislations on the subject, by Article 11 of the ECSI and by Article 

12 of the Draft Articles on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property.97  

The Court of Cassation understood that, for the purposes of tortious liability, the 

distinction between acta jure imperii and acta jure gestionis could be no longer considered 

as generally applicable.98  

As a further element to confirm the overcoming of that distinction, the Court of 

Cassation mentioned the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act 1996, which 

amended the FSIA 1976 of the USA. This amendment added a new exception to the grant 

of immunity in cases in which ‘… money damages are sought against a foreign state for 

personal injury or death that was caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft 

sabotage, hostage taking, or the provision of material support or resources for such an 

act…’.99 The derogation provided for by this amendment applies only to states designated 

as ‘sponsors of terrorism’ by the United States. The Court of Cassation considered the 

Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act 1996 provided a good example of the 

priority attributed to the protection of fundamental human rights over the interest of the 

state in having its immunity recognized.100  

The Court mentioned that, being a corollary of state immunity, the functional 

immunity of foreign state organs could not be invoked for international crimes.101 It 

considered that this point was undisputed and referred to treaty and domestic case law to 

support this statement.102 The Court of Cassation reasoned that, if functional immunity

Tribunale penale per la ex Jugoslavia e per il Ruanda, retro § 6.3.). Per quel che riguarda la 
prassi giudiziaria è sufficiente richiamare la sentenza della Corte Suprema di Israele 29 maggio

could not be granted in respect of international crimes, it should follow that there was no 

reason to grant immunity to the state itself in respect of these acts.103 

After all these considerations, the Court of Cassation declared Italian courts had 

jurisdiction to entertain the matter. Finally, the Court asserted that, although the facts on 

which the suit was based occurred in Italy, the ‘principles of universal jurisdiction’ over 

international crimes would suffice as a head of jurisdiction.104 The House of Lords in the 

Jones case discussed the matter and reached the opposite conclusion. 

 

3.1.2.2 Judgment of the Italian Court of Cassation in Mantelli and Others v Germany 

(2008) 

 

The decision rendered by the Court of Cassation in Mantelli and Others v Germany 

is part of a group of decisions with identical content, which denied immunity to Germany 

with respect to international crimes committed during the Second World War.105 The facts 

of this case are similar to those presented before the Court of Cassation in Ferrini v 

Germany. After 8 September 1943, Mr Giovanni Mantelli and other Italian citizens were 

deported to Germany, where they were forced to work for German industries.106 The 

plaintiffs initiated proceedings seeking compensation against Germany and the company 

for which they were forced to work, Daimlerchrysler.

‘L’immunità funzionale, secondo l’opinione prevalente, costituisce specificazione di quella che 
compete agli Stati, poiché risponde all’esigenza di impedire che il divieto di convenire in 
giudizio lo Stato straniero possa essere vanificato agendo nei confronti della persona mediante 
la quale la sua attività si è esternata. Ma se il rilievo è esatto, come sembra a questa Corte, deve 
allora convenirsi con quanti affermano che se l’immunità funzionale non può trovare 
applicazione, perché l’atto compiuto si configura quale crimine internazionale, non vi è alcuna 
valida ragione per tener ferma l’immunità dello Stato e per negare, conseguentemente, che la 
sua responsabilità possa essere fatta valere davanti all’autorità giudiziaria di uno Stato 
straniero.’

Germany contended Italian courts had no jurisdiction over the claim. It did so 

based on conventional and customary law. Firstly, it argued Italy could not exercise 

jurisdiction over the matter due to Article 77.4 of the Peace Treaty of 1947, according to 

which Italy waived ‘… on its own behalf and on behalf of Italian nationals all claims 

against Germany and German nationals outstanding on May 8, 1945, except those arising 

out of contracts and other obligations entered into, and rights acquired, before September 

1, 1939.’ 107  The waiver provided for in this article included ‘… debts, all inter-

governmental claims in respect of arrangements entered into in the course of the war, and 

all claims for loss or damage arising during the war.’108 Forecasting the Court of Cassation 

would deem the Peace Treaty inapplicable, due to Germany not being a party to it, it was 

put forward the Bonn Agreement between Germany and Italy concluded on 2 June 1961 

had settled the matter.  

Article 1 of the Bonn Agreement established that  ‘[l]a  Repubblica  Federale  di  

Germania  versa  alla  Repubblica italiana, a definizione delle questioni economiche 

pendenti, la somma di 40 milioni di marchi tedeschi.’109 According to Article 2.1 of the 

same treaty,  

 
‘… sono definite tutte le rivendicazioni e richieste della Repubblica italiana, o di persone 

fisiche o giuridiche italiane, ancora pendenti nei confronti della Repubblica Federale di 

Germania o nei confronti di persone fisiche o giuridiche tedesche, purché derivanti da diritti o 

ragioni sorti nel periodo tra il 1 settembre 1939 e l’8 maggio 1945.’110  

 

Article 2.2 provided that Italy would consider indemnified ‘… la Repubblica 

Federale di Germania e le persone fisiche e giuridiche tedesche da ogni eventuale azione o 

altra pretesa legale da parte di persone fisiche o giuridiche italiane per le rivendicazioni e 

richieste suddette.’111 In other words, the Bonn Agreement was a lump sum agreement by 

which Germany accepted to pay pecuniary compensation to settle pending claims against 

Germany and German natural and legal persons deriving from rights which had emerged

between 11 September 1939 and 8 May 1945. The compensation paid by Germani was 

split between the victims in accordance with the terms of a Presidential Decree.112 Lastly, 

Germany contended the Court of Cassation had erred in law in Ferrini v Germany, insofar 

as states enjoyed immunity with regard to acts which are an expression of their 

sovereignty.113 Germany grounded this argument on numerous judicial decisions which 

were in contradiction with the ruling of the Court of Cassation in the Ferrini case.114 

The Court of Cassation asserted the provisions contained in the Peace Treaty of 

1947 and in the Bonn Agreement of 1961 referred to substantive rights, and not to 

jurisdictional issues, and they could not exclude the jurisdiction of Italian judges.115  

The Court reaffirmed the soundness of its decision in Ferrini v Germany. It 

asserted that, whilst the judicial decisions cited by Germany could not confirm support for 

the existence of a ‘secure and explicit’ customary international norm providing for an 

exception to the principle of state immunity for acta jure imperii amounting to 

international crimes, they also could not support the existence of a customary norm 

expressing the opposite.116 In this sense, the Court emphasized that the joint dissenting 

opinion annexed to the judgment of the ECthR in Al-Adsani v United Kingdom and that the 

obiter dictum of the ECtHR’s decision in Kalogeropoulou and others v Greece and 

Germany pointed out that this exception to the principle of state immunity may be in statu

nascendi.117 The Court of Cassation then focused on reconstructing the argument it had 

previously laid out in Ferrini v Germany. It asserted that, in the international legal system, 

the principle of state immunity for acta jure imperii, which has the scope of favoring 

international relations with respect to each other’s sovereignty, coexists with the principle 

according to which international crimes threaten mankind as whole.118 As stated by the 

Court, deportation and forced labor are undeniably international crimes.119 There is, then, 

an antinomy between two competing principles which entered the Italian legal system by 

means of Article 10.1 of the Italian Constitution––and, at the systematic level, this 

antinomy is solved by giving precedence to the higher ranked norm.120 The Court made 

this move conscious that it was acting as an agent of the development of international law 

by contributing to the emergence of an international rule already implicit in the 

international legal system: 

 
‘[I]nfatti, come già sottolineato nella sentenza n. 5044 del 2004 [Ferrini] di questa corte, il 

rispetto dei diritti inviolabili della persona ha assunto, anche nell’ordinamento internazionale, 

il ruolo di principio fondamentale per il suo contenuto assiologico di metavalore … nel ribadire 

ora le conclusioni cui sono già pervenute con il ricordato proprio precedente, queste Sezioni 

unite sono consapevoli di contribuire così alla emersione di una regola conformativa della 

immunità dello Stato estero, che si ritiene comunque già insita nel sistema dell’ordinamento 

internazionale…’121 

 

The Court used as a supporting argument the incongruity that would result in the 

law by upholding the immunity exception for commercial transactions and at the same 

time not recognizing an exception for international crimes.122 Finally, the Court mentioned 

the fact the wrongful acts were committed in the territory of the forum state as a further 

argument to exercise jurisdiction over the matter.123

3.1.2.3 Judgment of the Italian Court of Cassation in the Milde case (2009) 

 

On 29 June 1944, a massacre against civilians took place in the municipalities of 

Civitella, Cornia and S. Pancrazio as a response to the killing of four German soldiers.124 

Two hundred and three people were killed, amongst them elderly people, women and 

children. 125  Sexual violence against women was committed and corpses were 

dismembered. 126  Decades later, on 10 October 2006, one of the participants of the 

massacre, Max Josef Milde, was sentenced to life imprisonment for having violated Article 

185 of the Codice penale militare di guerra, which prohibited the killing of civilian 

enemies. In the same sentence, the Court held Germany liable and ordered it to pay 

compensation to the parties.127 The judgment was unsuccessfully challenged before the 

Corte Militare di Appello and before the Court of Cassation.  

Germany argued the Italian courts had no jurisdiction due to the obligations Italy 

assumed in Article 77.4128 of the Treaty of Peace of 1947 and Article 2129 of the Bonn 

Agreement, concluded by Germany and Italy on 2 June 1961.130 Germany put forth that the 

right to obtain civil compensation was not a peremptory norm of international law and that 

Italy had validly waived on its behalf and on behalf of its nationals the right to seek

compensation in cases like the one under consideration.131 Germany also contended that 

the decision of the Court of Cassation in Ferrini v Germany was not in accordance with 

international law and that state immunity continued to extend for acta jure imperii in 

violation of jus cogens.132  

As asserted by Germany, international law rested on the practice of states, and the 

decisions of numerous domestic courts recognized states enjoyed jurisdictional immunity 

with respect to acta jure imperii even for cases arising from breaches of jus cogens norms, 

what was confirmed by the judgments of the ECtHR on the subject.133 Contradictorily, 

Germany also criticized the reference the Court of Cassation made in Ferrini v Germany to 

the terrorism exception to state immunity under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death 

Penalty Act, which amended the FSIA 1976: according to Germany, the decisions of the 

US courts based on this derogation to state immunity could not be used as evidence of 

international law because they were based solely on domestic legislation and this ‘new 

derogation’ was not provided for in the UNCJISP 2004.134 

The Court of Cassation, in its judgment, highlighted Germany only questioned the 

jurisdiction of the Italian courts to entertain the compensation claims––it was not contested 

Germany committed wrongful acts.135 The Court of Cassation reiterated it considered 

sound the jurisprudential turn established in Ferrini v Germany and reproduced in other 

decisions of the Italian courts. The Court then focused on justifying logically and 

systematically that the principle of jurisdictional immunity was not absolute and without 

exception and that it did not operate when confronted with the customary international 

principle which legitimizes remedies to obtain compensation for damages caused by 

international crimes.136 

When confronted with the argument espoused by Germany that the decision of the 

Court of Cassation in Ferrini v Germany was isolated and did not correspond to 

international law, the Court of Cassation took a very interesting approach to the problem: it 

asserted that the legal question posed by the relationship between state immunity and jus 

cogens could not be solved by a quantitative approach and that the answer to the problem

72  

could not depend on the number of decisions adhering to one solution or the other.137 The 

Court highlighted that the examination of the practice of tribunals was important to 

ascertain customary international law, but that there were other elements to be taken into 

account:  

 
‘… il punto che soprattutto preme di sottolineare è intimamente collegato alla convinzione che 

la soluzione della questione dibattuta non possa corrispondere ad un esito di tipo meramente 

quantitativo e non possa dipendere, perciò, soltanto dal numero, maggiore o minore, delle 

decisioni che aderiscono all’una o all’altra posizione. … se è vera che l’esame della prassi dei 

tribunali dei vari Stati costituisce uno strumento importante per l’accertamento del vigore delle 

norme consuetudinarie di diritto internazionale, è non di meno certo che il compito 

dell’interprete non può ridursi ad un computo aritmetico dei dati desunti dalla prassi, dovendo 

tenersi conto, oltre che delle difficoltà di verifica della reale esistenza delle consuetudini, anche 

della consistenza qualitativa di esse, delle interrelazioni riscontrabili tra le stesse, 

dell’operatività dei nessi di interdipendenza e di collocazione gerarchica operanti in diretta 

funzione del rango attribuito a ciascuna di quelle norme rispetto alla scala dei valori 

generalmente accolta dall’ordinamento internazionale.’138 

 

Echoing Ferrini, the Court of Cassation asserted that it could only provide a 

solution to the legal problem before it by coordinating the coexisting customary 

international norms in question and assessing whether their respective spheres of 

application were compatible or if one norm should prevail over the other: on one side, the 

principle of the jurisdictional immunity of states recognized with respect to acta jure 

imperii; on the other, the customary rules protecting fundamental human rights, which also 

were codified in numerous treaties.139  

The next step of the judgment is perhaps the most important: the Court 

acknowledged that ‘… [i]l coordinamento non può che essere realizzato sulla base di 

giudizi di valore che risultino in perfetta sintonia con le opzioni accolte nell’ordinamento 

internazionale.’140 In other words, the Court stated it was necessary to make a value-

oriented choice in consonance with the option embodied in international law. And in the 

Court of Cassation’s view, this option was to give precedence to the hierarchically superior 

principles. 141  Given the ‘parallela e antinomica coesistenza nell’ordinamento

internazionale dei due principi, entrambi di portata generale’, it was necessary to solve this 

conflict ‘sul piano sistematico del coordinamento e sulla base del criterio del 

bilanciamento degli interessi, dandosi prevalenza al principio di rango più elevato e di ius 

cogens, quindi alla garanzia che non resteranno impuniti i più gravi crimini dei diritti 

inviolabili di libertà e dignità della persona umana.’142 The Court remembered there was a 

‘qualitative difference’ between customary international norms: customary principles on 

jurisdictional immunity, remembered the Court, admit derogation by conventional norms, 

whilst customary norms safeguarding inviolable human rights have the nature of jus 

cogens and do not admit derogation.143 The Court added Article 53 of the VCLT postulated 

unequivocally the pre-eminence of jus cogens norms.  

The Court of Cassation concluded that, on the systematic level, precedence should 

be given to the norms belonging to jus cogens since they have a hierarchically higher rank 

in the international legal system.144  

The Court of Cassation then proceeded to analyze the issue on the logical level. It 

considered that the norms protecting freedom and human dignity were founded on 

‘principi universali ed inderogabili, percepiti come tali dall’intera comunità 

internazionale’ 145  and that the internal coherence of the international legal system 

demanded a reaction to the breach of these rules: it would not make sense to proclaim their 

primacy and at the same time to deprive individuals from the right of access to court, 

which provides the means to guarantee the effectiveness and preeminence of fundamental 

rights.146  

The Court of Cassation added an argument concerning the reception of customary 

international law in the domestic legal system that would be later developed in Judgment 

No 238/2014. Although the Court conceded the hierarchical status of international norms 

incorporated in the domestic legal order by means of Article 10.1 of the Italian constitution 

was still a controversial issue, the Court argued that even the authors who considered these 

norms enjoyed the same rank as constitutional law agreed that this reception could only 

operate provided that the international norms in question were in accordance with the

146 ibid.  



74  

constitutional principles considered to be non-derogable, which comprise, of course, 

fundamental human rights.147 

Finally, the Court of Cassation addressed the argument that Italy would be in 

breach of its treaty obligations if it exercised jurisdiction over the claim in question. The 

Court of Cassation asserted the Peace Treaty of 1947 could not be invoked because 

Germany was not a party to it and because the relevant provision of this treaty, Article 

77.4, only refers to rights related to material damages (‘diritti di natura reale relativi a 

danni materiali’), and not to moral damages. 148  The Court decided that the Bonn 

Agreement between Germany and Italy concluded on 2 June 1961 was not applicable to 

the situation at hand because, in its interpretation, Article 2 of the treaty circumscribed its 

scope to claims pending on the date the treaty was concluded, and not to claims that had 

not been started at the time the Bonn Agreement was concluded between the two states.149 

Also, the Court considered that the Bonn Agreement did not include moral damages 

(‘danni morali cagionati da crimini internazionali commessi attraverso la grave lesione dei 

diritti inviolabili dell’uomo’).150 

 

3.1.2.4 Judgment of the Italian Court of Cassation in Germany v Prefecture of Vojotia 

(2011) 

 

This is, to my knowledge, the last pronouncement of the Italian Court of Cassation 

on the issue of state immunity and grave violations of international human rights law and 

international humanitarian law before the judgment of the ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities 

of the State.  

This judgment has a direct link with the judgment of the Multi-Member Court of 

Levadia in the Distomo massacre case. As previously analyzed, the Greek Court of 

Cassation confirmed the decision of the Court of Levadia. The complainants 

unsuccessfully tried to enforce these decisions in Greece––Article 923 of the Greek Code 

                                                
147 Milde (Case No 1072/2009) (n 124) [7]. 
148 ibid [8]. 
149 ibid: 
 

‘Pertanto, va riconosciuto che è munita di solida base giustificativa l’opinione accolta nella 
sentenza impugnata secondo cui è da escludere che possa applicarsi l’Accordo del 1961 ad una 
controversia, come quella dedotta nel presente processo, non ancora pendente, perché neppure 
iniziata alla data di stipulazione della convenzione tra i due Stati …’ 

 
150 ibid. 



75  

of Civil Procedure prescribes that the enforcement of decisions against foreign states is 

subject to the prior consent of the Minister of Justice, which the complainants did not 

obtain. This refusal of the Greek courts to grant enforcement was questioned before the 

ECtHR in Kalogeropoulou and Others v Greece and Germany. Furthermore, the 

complainants sought to have the judgments enforced in Germany, but they were 

unsuccessful before both the German Federal Court of Justice and before the German 

Constitutional Court. 

In Italy, however, the Court of Appeal of Florence, in Judgment No 1696/2008, 

declared enforceable the decision of the Multi-Member Court of Levadia to pay 

compensation to the Prefecture of Vojotia, which was the legal representative of the 

victims.151  

Germany challenged this decision before the Court of Cassation, which rendered 

judgment on 20 May 2011. The Court of Cassation rejected Germany’s request to stay 

proceedings pending the ICJ’s judgment in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State on the 

grounds that the proceedings before the ICJ concerned the relations between states152. 

Accordingly, the Court of Cassation reasoned that, if Italy eventually had to give effect to 

the judgment of the ICJ, it would have to do so by adopting legislative and administrative 

measures––in the absence of such measures, the right of action of individuals who 

obtained a judgment enforceable in Italy remained intact.153 

Out of the seven grounds of appeal raised by Germany, only one related to 

international law, which was meticulously examined by the Court of Cassation. The 

ground of appeal in question was based on Article 64.1.g of Law No 218/1995 (‘Riforma 

del sistema italiano di diritto internazionale private’)154 and on Article 34.1 of Council 

Regulation No 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments

disposizioni non producono effetti contrari all’ordine pubblico.’ 

 



76  

in civil and commercial matters.155 Both provisions relate to the exception of public policy. 

Germany’s argument was that, after the judgment of the Court of Cassation, it had been 

established by the international community that state immunity still applied even in cases 

of grave breaches of human rights. Insofar as, by means of Article 10.1 of the Italian 

Constitution, ‘[l]’ordinamento giuridico italiano si conforma alle norme del diritto 

internazionale generalmente riconosciute’, Germany contended that the enforcement of the 

judgments of the Greek courts in question would amount to a violation of the principle of 

public policy.156 

The Court of Cassation took this opportunity to reaffirm the case-law it developed 

in Ferrini, Milde and Mantelli and to frame it in a theoretical account of the law of state 

immunity.  

The Court began by recalling the hierarchical argument it had employed in Ferrini: 

the international crimes committed violated rights from which no derogation is permitted. 

Given the existence of an antinomy between the international norms protecting those rights 

and those relating to state immunity, priority has to be accorded to the norms of higher 

rank—in the words of the Court of Cassation: ‘[i]t follows from this hierarchical 

relationship that the immunity States enjoy with regard to their acts jure imperii … is not 

an absolute immunity but rather an immunity conditional on the respect for norms that 

protect human rights.’157  

The Court of Cassation then referred to one of the arguments employed in Mantelli, 

which was part of a group of decisions (Orders 14201/2008 to 14213/2008) with identical 

content. In Mantelli, the Court of Cassation considered that human rights protection has the 

role of a fundamental principle due to its ‘axiological content of  “meta-value”’ and that, 

by giving priority to this principle when confronted with the principle of jurisdictional 

immunity of states, it was self-consciously contributing to the emergence of a ‘formative

rule concerning state immunity’ which was ‘already implicit in the international legal 

system’.158  

The Court of Cassation then sought to demonstrate that Germany erred when it 

contended that the Court of Cassation was isolated in respect of its approach. Germany 

referred to the Jones case, in which the House of Lords emphatically criticized the Ferrini 

judgment. In the House of Lords, Lord Bingham expressed its disapproval with the 

contention that the principle of universal jurisdiction was applicable to civil actions arising 

from international crimes. The Court of Cassation tried to dismiss this criticism by stating 

that  

 
‘… the 2006 judgment of the House of Lords [the Jones case] … relied on the principle of 

locus commissi delicti, and they opposed the part of the Ferrini judgment which referred to the 

universal character of jurisdiction in cases relating to the protection of inviolable rights of the 

person… [T]he references in Ferrini to the literature on universal jurisdiction (and to the non-

applicability of statutes of limitations) are made merely to corroborate the greater importance, 

in the international context, of the protection of inviolable rights as compared to State 

immunity. … [W]hen the limiting principle of locus commissi delicti is taken into account, the 

Ferrini judgment is by no means out of step with the international jurisprudence. … [W]e 

decline to attribute to the Ferrini judgment a meaning which—if the specific circumstances of 

that case are taken into account—it plainly does not have, namely, that it upholds the principle 

of universal jurisdiction to decide human rights cases and gives priority to that principle over 

the customary principle of State immunity.’159 

 

The Court of Cassation did not address, however, Lord Hoffmann’s critique that 

the ordering of competing principles was a technique of adjudication unacceptable in 

international law.  

In Ferrini the Court of Cassation criticized the ‘tacit waiver’ theory, which was 

employed by the Multi-Member Court of Levadia (and mentioned by the Areios Pagos), on 

the grounds that it could not be implied from the violations of peremptory norms by 

Germany its intent to waive its jurisdictional immunity. In this judgment, the Court of 

Cassation merely mentioned that  

 

                                                
158 Germany v Prefecture of Vojotia (Case No 11163/2011) (n 151) [30]. 
159 ibid [32]-[33]. 



78  

‘the tribunal [of Levadia] made explicit reference to the prevalence, in legal literature and in 

international practice, of the opinion according to which a State is precluded from invoking 

immunity where the act imputed to it violates a rule of jus cogens.’160 

 

Continuing its analysis, the Court of Cassation closed examined two cases decided 

by US Courts: Letelier v Republic of Chile (1980) and Liu v Republic of China (1989). The 

Letelier and Liu cases dealt with political assassinations committed in the territory of the 

United States by agents of foreign states. In both cases, the ‘tort exception’ to state 

immunity enshrined in the FSIA was applied. The FSIA did not incorporate the distinction 

between acta jure imperii and jure gestionis, which was immaterial to the outcome of the 

cases. In the Letelier case, the District Court found that, for the purposes of Section 

1605.a.5.A, according to which the tort exception is not applicable to ‘any claim based 

upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary 

function regardless of whether the discretion be abused’161, the order of the Chilean 

Republic for its organs to perpetrate the conducts that culminated in the assassination of 

Orlando Letelier could not be understood as a ‘discretionary act’—the ‘tort exception’, 

therefore, applied. The same understanding was applied in the Liu case. According to the 

Court of Cassation, the Letelier case was important because ‘it [highlighted] the 

inadequacy of the theory of acts jure imperii as a means to resolve the issue of immunity in 

cases of violations of important norms such as those protecting human rights.’162 

The Court of Cassation also referred to Altmann v Republic of Austria (2004), in 

which the US Supreme Court detailed the historical background of the codification of the 

FSIA.163 The Court of Cassation underlined the Altmann case showed that,  

 
‘… in American common law, the principle of State immunity had an “internal” origin, since, 

before the enactment of the FSIA, it was applied in a case-by-case basis and consistency often 

gave way to political considerations.164

79  

In the Arrest Warrant case, the ICJ considered that ‘… in customary international 

law, the immunities accorded to Ministers for Foreign Affairs are not granted for their 

personal benefit, but to ensure the effective performance of their functions on behalf of 

their respective States.’165 After an examination of the functions exercised by Foreign 

Ministers, the ICJ concluded that ‘… the functions of a Minister for Foreign Affairs are 

such that, throughout the duration of his or her office, he or she when abroad enjoys full 

immunity from criminal jurisdiction and inviolability.’166 The Court of Cassation inferred 

that these considerations of the ICJ were made pursuant certain theoretical premises. 

According to the Court of Cassation, the ICJ adopted a view of immunity that differed 

from the conception according to which immunity is founded on the principle of sovereign 

equality of states: 

 
‘According to the Court [the ICJ], an international customary rule required immunity for 

Foreign Ministers to ensure the effective fulfillment of their duties and to protect them from 

any act by another State that could impair the performance of their tasks. In essence, such a 

norm precluding the exercise of jurisdiction made it possible to discharge duties that promote 

the reciprocal interests of States and the interests of the Community of nations. This definition 

of the international customary norm expresses a conception of immunity altogether different 

from the notion of a dichotomy between acta jure imperii and acta jure gestionis, the latter 

vision being linked to a principle of equality among States, according to the maxim of par in 

parem non habet imperium. The theories that justify immunity on the basis of the principle of 

equality among States envisage an absolute shield of immunity which in reality … never 

existed. This absolute vision is an abstract one that depicts the international space as a space 

that is empty, rather than as one of cooperation. But in recent decades, we have witnessed an 

ever-advancing construction of supranational norms designed to respect and protect human 

rights.’167 

 

In my view, it is very doubtful that, underlying the ICJ’s argument, there was a 

rejection of the theory that links state immunity and the principle of sovereign equality of 

states. In any case, ten years later, in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State, the ICJ stated 

that ‘the rule of State immunity … derives from the principle of sovereign equality of 

States’. 168  Nevertheless, the Court of Cassation’s efforts to develop a theoretical

framework to support its case-law are notable. In the Court of Cassation’s view, state 

immunity is not founded on the principle of sovereign equality of states—it is ‘functional’ 

because it is accorded to ‘promote the reciprocal interests of States and the interests of the 

Community of nations’.  

Another point added by the Court of Cassation was that the UNCJISP and the ECSI 

were not relevant to the dispute, since they do not take into account situations in which a 

state practiced acts in violation of jus cogens norms.169 

Lastly, the Court of Cassation made a more general argument as regards the current 

state of international law by highlighting three developments in the post-Second World 

War international legal order: (i) the impact of the UN and the establishment of 

international ad hoc criminal tribunals and of the ICC; (ii) the continuous process of 

European integration and the creation of the ECtHR; and (iii) the rise of democratic 

regimes, specifically in Europe. 170  The Court of Cassation highlighted the Italian 

constitution was ‘… designed to fully implement the new order within the national 

territory’.171  

As a result, the Court of Cassation held that the execution in Italy of the relevant 

Greek judgments could not be considered to be in violation of the Italian public order: 

 
‘… it must therefore be excluded that the execution in Italy of a judgment of a foreign State, 

which requires a third State (each of these States, in this case, being a signatory to the 

European Convention of Human Rights and a member of the European Union) to compensate 

victims (and their heirs) of very serious war crimes—denied of their inviolable rights, 

including above all the right to life—can be held contrary to the Italian public order under 

Article 64(1)(g) of Law 218/1995.’172 

 

3.1.3 Germany  

 

The judicial decisions discussed here also have a link with the Distomo Massacre 

case. The claimants in that case (previously discussed in this chapter) initiated parallel 

proceedings before the German courts seeking a declaration of Germany’s liability in

damages in respect of those events.173 Their claim was dismissed by the Oberlandesgericht 

(OLG) (Regional Court) of Cologne.174 They appealed to the Federal Supreme Court.175 

On appeal, the claimants asked for recognition and enforcement of Judgment No 137/1997 

rendered by the Multi-Member Court of Levadia. The Federal Supreme Court asserted that 

there would be legal basis to recognize the judgment of the Multi-Member Court of 

Levadia only if it had been rendered ‘within the jurisdiction of the Greek State’.176 This 

requirement, however, was not met in the view of the Federal Supreme Court, which found 

that Greece did not have international jurisdiction over the claims. According to the 

Federal Supreme Court, the acts of German forces in the occupied Greek territory were of 

a sovereign nature and, under international law, immunity is available for acta jure 

imperii.177 The Federal Supreme Court added that the attempt to restrict immunity in 

respect of violations of jus cogens was not accepted by the majoritarian view.178 The 

Federal Supreme Court also did not accept the tort exception could be used to lift 

Germany’s jurisdiction.179 The Federal Supreme Court highlighted the tort exception was 

provided for in Article 11 of the ECSI, Article 31 of which excludes acts of armed forces 

from the scope of the convention. The Federal Supreme Court added it was questionable 

whether the tort exception was an expression of a rule of customary international law and, 

assuming it were, it could not have retroactive effect reaching the events of the Second 

World War.180 As a further argument, the Federal Supreme Court mentioned the judgment 

of the Greek Special Supreme Court in Germany v Margellos and the ECtHR’s judgment 

in Kalogeropoulou confirmed this interpretation of international law.181 The other part of 

the judgment concerned the claim for damages and compensation itself and is not relevant 

for the purposes of this monograph, since it deals with Germany’s liability, and not with 

state immunity.  

An appeal was lodged before the Federal Constitutional Court, which held that the 

refusal of the Federal Supreme Court to recognize Judgment No 137/1997 of the Multi-

Member Court of Levadia did not violate Germany’s Constitution:

‘The refusal of the Bundesgerichtshof [the Federal Supreme Court] to be bound by the 

judgment of the court in Livadia of 30 October 1997 is not objectionable under the 

Constitution. Under current international law, a State may claim exemption from the 

jurisdiction of another State if and in so far as an appraisal of its sovereign conduct is 

concerned—so called acta jure imperii … As the SS unit that took part in the events in 

Distomo was incorporated into the armed forces of the German Reich, the attacks, irrespective 

of the question of their infringement of international law, are to be classed as sovereign acts. 

The Bundesgerichtshof therefore correctly held it was not bound by the judgment of the Greek 

court in Livadia.’182  

 

3.1.4 France   

 

The French Court of Cassation has consistently held that Germany is entitled to 

immunity in proceedings brought by French citizens seeking damages for injuries suffered 

as a result of deportation to Germany and forced labor during the Second World War. The 

French Court of Cassation has justified the grant of immunity due to the jure imperii nature 

of the acts perpetrated by the Third Reich.183  

In GIE La Réunion Aérienne v La Jamahiriya Arabe Libyenne184, the French Court 

of Cassation had to pronounce itself on whether Libya was entitled to state immunity. The 

case was related to the explosion, on 19 September 1989, of an aircraft of the French 

Airline UTA, which was operating a flight from Brazzaville to Paris.185 The event, which 

led to the death of 170 people, was the result of a bomb planted in the aircraft. Six Libyan 

nationals were held civilly and criminally liable in absentia (‘par contumace’) for it by the 

Cour d’assises de Paris. 186  In another proceeding, other beneficiaries of the victims 

pursued claims against the six Libyan nationals who had been found liable by the Cour

d’assises de Paris, the Libyan state and the Fonds de garantie des victimes des actes de 

terrorisme et d’autres infractions.187 The GIE La Réunion Aérienne and other entities that 

had sold insurance policies to the French Airline UTA voluntarily intervened in the 

proceedings before the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris.188 They asked the Tribunal to 

condemn the six Libyan nationals and the Libyan state to reimburse the indemnities 

allocated.189 The Tribunal de grande instance de Paris declared Libya was entitled to 

immunity—except as regards the French claimants vis-à-vis which the foreign state had 

renounced its right to immunity.190  

The French Court of Cassation upheld the grant of immunity. The French Court of 

Cassation highlighted Libya had not committed the acts of terrorism—its responsibility 

was called into question because it had allegedly failed to repress and to disavow them, 

and allegedly had even approved and supported them.191 The Court of Cassation quoted 

with approval the decision of the Cour d’Appel according to which Libya could rely on 

state immunity because ‘… la nature criminelle d’un acte de terrorisme ne permet pas, à 

elle seule, d’écarter une prérogative de souveraineté’.192  

The Court of Cassation also remarked that, if the prohibition of acts of terrorism 

had the nature of jus cogens, which may constitute a legitimate restriction on state 

immunity, in the case at hand, such a restriction would be disproportionate in respect of the 

aim pursued because Libya was not being questioned for the commission of acts of 

terrorism, but for its moral responsibility. In the words of the Court: 

 
‘… à supposer que l’interdiction des actes de terrorisme puisse être mise au rang de norme de 

jus cogens du droit international, laquelle prime les autres règles du droit international et peut 

constituer une restriction légitime à l’immunité de juridiction, une telle restriction serait en 

l’espèce disproportionnée au regard du but poursuivi dès lors que la mise en cause de l’État 

étranger n’est pas fondée sur la commission des actes de terrorisme mais sur sa responsabilité 

moral.’193 

 

According to a commentator, this passage ‘pointed … to the existence of a possible 

restriction to immunity when a claim concerns the reparation of the breach of an obligation

under jus cogens wherever committed, provided that the breach results from a positive 

conduct of the foreign State.’194 In Jurisdictional Immunities of the State, the ICJ rejected 

that this excerpt could imply the existence of such a restriction. In the view of the ICJ, 

‘[t]he Cour de cassation in [GIE La Réunion Aérienne v La Jamahiriya Arabe Libyenne] 

stated only that, even if a jus cogens norm could constitute a legitimate restriction on State 

immunity, such a restriction could not be justified on the facts of that case.’195 

The Court of Cassation also considered that the risk of denial of justice could not 

‘…fléchir une règle par laquelle le droit français interdit aux tribunaux français de 

connaître d’un litige.’196 Lastly, the Court of Cassation asserted that a waiver to immunity 

must be ‘… certaine, expresse et non équivoque’.197 Accordingly, Libya’s renunciation of 

immunity in favor of some claimants could not be extended to the others. The Court of 

Cassation rejected the appeal and upheld the grant of immunity to Libya. 

 

3.1.5 Poland 

 

3.1.5.1 Judgment of the Polish Supreme Court in Natoniewski v Germany (2010) 

 

Mr Natoniewski brought a claim against Germany for damages arising from 

injuries suffered during the pacification of Szczecyn during the Second World War. Mr 

Natoniewski was six years old at the time and ‘… suffered extensive burns to his head, 

chest and both hands, with health consequences that are still present.’198 The case reached 

the Polish Supreme Court, which had to rule on whether Polish courts had jurisdiction over 

the claim and on whether immunity was available for Germany.  

The Polish Supreme Court adopted a very orthodox approach to customary 

international law, relying on Article 38 of the Statute of the ICJ and on the traditional 

definition of customary international law as being composed of state practice and opinio 

juris.199 As regards state immunity, the Polish Supreme Court also adopted a textbook 

approach. It considered that until the 1950s the absolute theory of state immunity prevailed

85  

and that, in recent times, immunity is only available in respect of acts jure imperii and has 

been subjected to a growing number of restrictions.200 The Polish Supreme Court asserted 

that state practice supported the tort exception, there being  

 
‘…no international duty, on the part of States, to grant immunity to other States in matters of 

torts, if the actions leading to a tort occurred in the territory of the forum State, and if the 

author of the injury or damage was present in that territory at the time when those actions 

occurred.’201  

 

Since the tort exception was a more recent restriction to state immunity, the Polish 

Supreme Court had to decide whether it applied to the case at hand. It concluded that, 

although the general rule was that the applicable law is that in force at the time of the 

occurrence of the relevant events, in the sphere of procedural law, the principle of direct 

application of the new law prevailed.202 In the light of the procedural aspect of immunity, 

the Polish Supreme Court concluded that it had to apply the rules relating to state 

immunity in force at the time of the Court’s decision on admissibility, and not the rules in 

force at the time of the events which gave rise to Mr Natoniewski’s claim.203 Nevertheless, 

the Polish Supreme Court held that the tort exception did not apply in respect of events 

during armed conflicts and provided the following justification:  

 
‘The specificity of the causes of armed conflicts suggests the applicability of state immunity 

for actions arising in the course of these conflicts. Armed conflicts—with victims on a large-

scale and an enormity of destruction and suffering—cannot be reduced to the relationship 

between the state/perpetrator and the injured person; the conflicts exist mainly between states. 

Traditionally, property claims arising from the events of war shall be settled in peace treaties, 

aimed at a comprehensive—at the international and individual level—regulation of the 

consequences of war. In such cases, jurisdictional immunity provides international law means 

for regulating property claims resulting from the events of war. The removal from court 

jurisdiction a whole range of civil claims (caused by the war) is designed to counteract the 

situation, when the normalization of relation between states may face obstacles as a result of a 

large number of proceedings instituted by individuals. The proceedings could be a factor 

maintaining political disputes and not necessarily lead to full satisfaction of claims. The 

international legal procedure for property claims caused by the events of war in conjunction

with the grant of sovereign immunity is a universal solution. Therefore, the international legal 

procedure for property claims caused by the events of war cannot be seen only from a 

perspective of relations between Poland and Germany, that is from a perspective of states 

which ended the war over sixty years ago.’204 

  

The Polish Supreme Court also rejected the argument a state is not entitled to 

immunity for the violation of jus cogens rules, although it conceded that it was an 

‘axiologically doubtful situation’ that immunity was not available for ‘a single injury’ 

committed in the territory of the forum state, whilst it was for ‘massive injury’ caused by 

military action.205 The Court provided the following reasons to justify its position. Firstly, 

it considered that the implicit waiver theory was inconsistent. In the view of the Polish 

Supreme Court, a violation of a jus cogens rule or the accession to international 

instruments protecting human rights could not be understood as a waiver of immunity, 

since a waiver must be clear.206 Secondly, the Polish Supreme Court considered state 

immunity could not be removed on the basis of general principles of law, insofar as state 

immunity is a customary rule and, in the view of the Polish Supreme Court, principles 

could only be invoked to fill lacunae and solve ambiguities.207 Thirdly, the Court asserted 

that the decision to remove immunity could be considered an act of reprisal, which has a 

political dimension, and it was questionable whether the court would be competent to 

perform it.208 Fourthly, the Court contended that the practice of piercing the veil of 

immunity for acts in violation of human rights committed in the forum state ‘… [was] by 

no means universal.’209 

The Polish Supreme Court also mentioned the grant of immunity in the case was 

consistent with the case-law of the ECtHR and would not violate Article 6.1 of the 

ECHR.210 Finally, it ruled that, due to the existence of immunity, a requirement for 

national jurisdiction as provided for in the Polish Code of Civil Procedure had not been 

met.211

3.1.6 The United States 

 

3.1.6.1 The Princz case 

 

3.1.6.1.1 Judgment of the District Court for the District of Columbia (1992) 

 

Mr Hugo Princz, a Jewish American, brought a claim against Germany before the 

United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to recover damages 

suffered by him as a result of his internment in various concentration camps by the Nazis 

during the Second World War.212 At the time they were arrested, in 1942, he and his family 

lived in Czechoslovakia.213 Mr Princz and his family were subjected to unfathomable 

atrocities, including enslavement. He was the only member of his family to survive the 

atrocities perpetrated by the Nazi regime.214 Mr Princz was unsuccessful in his endeavors 

to obtain a pension or other form of reparation under the compensation schemes set up by 

Germany for victims of the Holocaust.215 Attempts to obtain an ex gratia payment from 

Germany were also unsuccessful.216  

In its ruling on jurisdiction, District Judge Sporkin began by recalling that, in the 

Amerada Hess case, the United States Supreme Court concluded that the FSIA was the 

sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in US courts. Nevertheless, in the 

light of the facts of the case, District Judge Sporkin concluded that the understanding of 

the Supreme Court in Amerada Hess was not a bar to jurisdiction. He also added Germany 

was estopped from invoking US law, since it had showed blatant disregard for the US and 

for international law:  

 
‘The Supreme Court [in Amerada Hess] did not have such extraordinary facts as those 

presently before this Court in rendering its decision in Hess. And the Court cannot believe that,

Columbia), 598.

215 ibid. 
216 ibid. 



88  

in enacting the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, Congress contemplated a factual scenario 

akin to that at bar, let alone that it intended to bar a U.S. citizen from seeking redress against a 

nation standing in the shoes of his or her would-be butcher in U.S. courts in a case such as this. 

Therefore, this Court concludes that neither Hess nor the FSIA itself bars this Court from 

hearing the plaintiff’s claim.  

‘This Court finds that the Federal Sovereign Immunities Act has no role to play where the 

claims alleged involve undisputed acts of barbarism committed by a onetime outlaw nation 

which demonstrated callous disrespect for the humanity of an American citizen, simply 

because he was Jewish. The Court cannot permit such a nation, which at the time these 

barbaric acts were committed neither recognized nor respected U.S. or international law, to 

now block the legitimate claims of a U.S. citizen by asserting U.S. law to evade its 

responsibilities. A government which stands in the shoes of a rogue nation the likes of Nazi 

Germany is estopped from asserting U.S. law in this fashion. To allow otherwise would create 

a severe imbalance in the reciprocity and mutual respect which must exist between nations, and 

would work an intolerable injustice against the plaintiff and the principles for which this 

country stands.’217 

 

As further arguments, District Judge Sporkin also mentioned that it was unlikely 

that Mr Princz would be able to obtain a remedy before German courts, since the German 

Supreme Court, in an administrative determination, had signaled Mr Princz’s claim would 

be denied.218 District Judge Sporkin reasoned that the case involved not only a violation of 

international law, but also the violation of Mr Princz’s rights of citizenship and as a human 

being.219 Thus, although ‘Congress did indeed fashion a comprehensive scheme regarding 

U.S. courts’ jurisdiction over foreign nations’, it had not ‘…stripped Americans of their 

rights of citizenship or of their right to be protected by [the United States] government and 

… laws just because they travel overseas.’220 District Judge Sporkin concluded that to deny 

Mr Princz redress in the US courts ‘… would complete the stripping of Mr. Princz’s most 

valuable rights of citizenship.’221 

 

3.1.6.1.2 Judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (1994) 

 

Germany appealed the decision of the District Court to deny its motion to dismiss 

the suit. Circuit Judge Ginsburg, who delivered the judgment for the Court of Appeals,

considered that he did not have to decide whether the FSIA applied retroactively because 

the District Court would lack jurisdiction whether the FSIA applied or not. Mr Princz had 

argued that the US courts had jurisdiction under the FSIA based on the commercial activity 

exception, the implied waiver exception and the international agreement exception. Judge 

Ginsburg proceeded to examine the bases of jurisdiction invoked by Mr Princz.  

Section 1605.a.2 of the FSIA provides that a foreign state  

 
‘… shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States or of the States 

in any case ... in which the action is based ... upon an act outside the territory of the United 

States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign sovereign elsewhere and that act 

causes a direct effect in the United States.’222  

 

Mr Princz stated that the Nazi government leased his labor for profit to German 

companies and argued that this was a commercial activity that had a direct effect on the 

United States.223 Judge Ginsburg considered that he did not have to rule on whether leasing 

slave labor to private companies was a commercial activity under the FSIA because this 

activity did not have a ‘direct effect’ in the United States, and that rendered the 

commercial exception inapplicable. Judge Ginsburg dismissed Mr Princz’s argument that, 

since the companies for which he was forced to provide labor aided Germany in the war 

effort, the ‘direct effect’ requirement was met. Judge Ginsburg considered that ‘many 

events and actors necessarily intervened between any work that Mr. Princz performed … 

and any effect felt in the United States’, and thus the ‘direct effect requirement was not 

met.’224 Mr Princz had also argued that Germany utilized the mail, wire and banking 

system of the United States to administer its reparation schemes for the victims of the Nazi 

regime. Judge Ginsburg asserted that the administration of reparation schemes could not 

amount to a ‘direct effect’ of Mr Princz’s enslavement.225 Lastly, Judge Ginsburg did not 

accept the argument that Mr Princz’s continued suffering in the US could be considered a 

‘direct effect in the United States’.226 

The waiver exception is provided for in Section 1605.a.1 of the FSIA. It establishes 

that state immunity is not available in cases in which ‘…  the foreign state has waived its

immunity either explicitly or by implication, notwithstanding any withdrawal of the waiver 

which the foreign state may purport to effect except in accordance with the terms of the 

waiver.’227 It was argued that Germany had implicitly waived its immunity by violating jus 

cogens norms. Although acknowledging the violation of jus cogens norms by Germany, 

Judge Ginsburg dismissed this argument and adopted the same understanding of the Court 

of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Siderman de Blake, according to which, lacking an 

exception in the FSIA, the violation of jus cogens norms could not, in itself, confer 

jurisdiction.228 Judge Ginsburg added that the ‘… jus cogens theory of implied waiver is 

incompatible with the intentionality requirement implicit in § 1605(a)(l).’229 Germany had 

not showed ‘its amenability to suit’, so the waiver exception could not be used as a basis of 

jurisdiction in the case.230  

Judge Ginsburg moved next to the ‘treaty provision exception’. Section 1604 of the 

FSIA establishes that a foreign state is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the 

United States ‘… [s]ubject to existing international agreements to which the United States 

is a party at the time of enactment of this Act.’231 Mr Princz relied on the 1907 Hague 

Convention (IV). Article 52 of the Regulations annexed to the Hague Convention (IV) 

establishes that the inhabitants of an occupied State shall not be required to ‘… [take] part 

in military operations against their own country.’232 Article 3 of the Hague Convention 

(IV) provides that ‘[a] belligerent party which violates the provisions of the said 

Regulations shall, if the case demands, be liable to pay compensation.’233 Judge Sporkin 

considered that the Hague Convention (IV) did not create a private right of action. 

Furthermore, recalling Amerada Hess, he asserted that the ‘treaty provision exception’ is 

only applicable when there is an ‘express conflict’ between the international agreement 

and the immunity provisions of the FSIA.234  

Having established that there was not a jurisdictional basis under the FSIA even if 

it applied retroactively, Judge Ginsburg added that it could not ‘revive the pre-FSIA 

diversity jurisdiction’, which was enshrined in 28 U.S.C. § 1332, because Congress had

eliminated this head of jurisdiction when it passed the FSIA.235 Furthermore, he added the 

claims brought by Mr Princz were based on tort and quasi-contract law, and not on federal 

law, and that placed the case outside the federal question jurisdiction.236 

The Court of Appeal upheld Germany’s appeal and reversed the finding of the 

District Court.  

 

3.1.6.1.2.1 The dissenting opinion of Judge Wald appended to the judgment of the 

Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Princz v Germany (1994)  

 

Circuit Judge Wald appended a dissenting opinion to the judgment of the Court. 

Judge Wald started her dissenting opinion with a detailed account of the sufferings 

inflicted upon Mr Princz by Germany and offered a critique of Germany’s conduct: 

 
‘Despite its public professions of penitence for the horrors of the Holocaust … Germany 

repeatedly relied on technicalities such as Princz’s citizenship at the time of his enslavement to 

deny him either a pension or any restitution for his immense suffering. Ironically, had Princz 

not been an American citizen at the time of the Holocaust, he would have received 

compensation.’237  

 

Judge Wald understood the FSIA applied. She considered the language of the FSIA 

was ambiguous and relied on the standard provided in Landgraf v USI Film Prods. by the 

Supreme Court in respect of retroactivity analysis, according to which  

 
‘… [w]hen … the statute contains no such express command, the court must determine 

whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a 

party possessed when he acted, increase a party’s liability for past conduct, or impose new 

duties with respect to transactions already completed.’238

92  

The relevant test as regards retroactivity was, therefore, to determine whether the 

FSIA would ‘impair rights a party possessed when he acted’. She considered that at the 

time the events took place, between 1942 and 1945, the practice of the courts of the United 

States concerning state immunity was to ‘[defer] … to the case-by-case foreign policy 

determinations of the executive branch.’239 Judge Wald concluded Germany could not 

have expected the Executive branch to suggest immunity for acts related to the Holocaust: 

 
‘In the mid-1940s, Germany could not, even in its wildest dreams, have expected the executive 

branch of the United States, as a matter of grace and comity, to suggest immunity for its 

enslavement and confinement (in three concentration camps) of an American citizen during the 

Holocaust. The outcome of the Nuremberg trials provides a clear signal that the international 

community, and particularly the United States—one of the four nations that established the 

Nuremberg Tribunal—would not have supported a broad enough immunity to shroud the 

atrocities committed during the Holocaust. … Clearly, had the question been put to them, the 

United States executive branch would have opted to deny Germany’s claims to immunity for 

the crimes alleged in this case.’240 

 

In the light of these considerations, Judge Wald concluded that ‘…because the 

FSIA infringes upon no rights held by Germany at the time it enslaved and imprisoned 

Princz, it applies to this case.’241  

Judge Wald held that Germany had implicitly waived its right to state immunity by 

violating the jus cogens norms which prohibit enslavement and genocide. Underscoring the 

watershed represented by the Nuremberg trials, she stated the following: 

 
‘Prior to the Nuremberg trials, the positivist theory of international law governed state 

sovereignty, and a state’s treatment of its own citizens was considered immune from the 

dictates of international law. … The Nuremberg trials thus permanently eroded any notion that 

the mantle of sovereign immunity could serve to cloak an act that constitutes a “crime against 

humanity,” even if that act is confined within the borders of a single sovereign state.  

Because the Nuremberg Charter’s definition of “crimes against humanity” includes what are 

now termed jus cogens norms, a state is never entitled to immunity for any act that contravenes 

a jus cogens norm, regardless of where or against whom that act was perpetrated.  

‘… Jus cogens norms are by definition nonderogable, and thus when a state thumbs its nose at 

such a norm, in effect overriding the collective will of the entire international community, the

state cannot be performing a sovereign act entitled to immunity. When the Nazis tore off 

Princz’s clothes, exchanged them for a prison uniform and a tattoo, shoved him behind the 

spiked barbed wire fences of Auschwitz and Dachau, and sold him to the German armament 

industry as fodder for their wartime labor operation, Germany rescinded any claim under 

international law to immunity from this court’s jurisdiction.’242 

 

Judge Wald’s next step was to reconcile the operation of the implicit waiver in the 

sphere of international law with the FSIA. Judge Wald recalled that, in the Paquete 

Habana case, the Supreme Court declared that international law is part of the law of the 

United States.243 It followed, according to Judge Wald, that the FSIA should be construed 

consistently with international law: 

 
‘The only way to reconcile the FSIA’s presumption of foreign sovereign immunity with 

international law is to interpret § 1605(a)(1) [the waiver exception] of the Act as encompassing 

the principle that a foreign state implicitly waives its right to sovereign immunity in United 

States courts by violating jus cogens norms. 

‘Construing § 1605(a)(l) to include as an implied waiver a foreign state’s breach of a jus 

cogens norm is not at odds with the language and legislative history of the FSIA, which supply 

scant guidance as to the provision’s meaning.’244 

 

Judge Wald concluded that, by interpreting the FSIA in accordance with 

international law, under Section 1605.a.1 of the FSIA, Germany had waived its immunity.

Others (1996)   

 

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith provided a summary of the facts of the case. Mr Al-

Adsani, a dual British and Kuwaiti national, was a member of the Kuwait Air Forces who 

fought in the Gulf War. Mr Al-Adsani remained in Kuwait as a member of the resistance 

movement during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.245 In this context, he came into possession

of video tapes of a sexual nature belonging to Sheikh Jaber Al-Sabah Al-Saud Al-Sabah, 

who is related to the Emir of Kuwait and was considered an influential figure in Kuwait.246 

The contents of these video tapes entered circulation and the Sheikh blamed Mr Al-Adsani 

for it.247 After the Iraqi forces were expelled from Kuwait, in May 1991, Mr Al-Adsani 

alleged the following, as described by Lord Justice Evans: 

 
‘On 2 May 1991, the plaintiff [Mr Al-Adsani] was taken at gun point from his house in Kuwait. 

He was taken in a government car to the State security prison and was there subjected to very 

considerable physical ill-treatment.  

‘… The matter did not rest there because on 7 May the plaintiff was again taken at gun point, 

this time to what is described as a royal palace of some member of the ruling family. There he 

was first immersed in a swimming pool said to have contained a number of corpses, and then 

was placed in a cell together with a mattress which had been impregnated with petrol and 

which was afterwards set alight. The plaintiff managed to avoid being burned alive, which is 

what appears to have been intended. He was then threatened that he would be shot, but 

fortunately that fate was avoided also.  

‘He undoubtedly suffered very serious burns.’248  

 

Torture is an international crime and there is a wide consensus that its prohibition is 

a norm with the status of jus cogens. The prohibition against torture is enshrined in UNGA 

Resolution 3452 (XXX) of 9 December 1975 (‘Declaration on the Protection of All 

Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 

Treatment or Punishment’), in the CAT 1984, and, at the European level, in the ECHR. In 

the United Kingdom, pursuant to Sections 134 and 135 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, 

torture is a crime punishable in the UK even if committed elsewhere––the exercise of 

criminal jurisdiction, nevertheless, is only possible ‘… if the accused is physically present 

within the jurisdiction or amenable to extradition.’249  

In the United Kingdom, state immunity is governed by the SIA 1978, whose 

relevant provisions are the following:  

 
‘1––General immunity from jurisdiction.

‘(1) A State is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom except as 

provided in the following provisions of this Part of this Act. 

‘(2) A court shall give effect to the immunity conferred by this section even though the State 

does not appear in the proceedings in question. 

‘… 5––Personal injuries and damage to property. 

‘A State is not immune as respects proceedings in respect of— 

‘(a) death or personal injury; or 

‘(b) damage to or loss of tangible property,  

‘caused by an act or omission in the United Kingdom.’250 

 

Mr Al-Adsani’s counsel argued that Section 1.1 of the SIA, which establishes that 

‘[a] State is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom except as 

provided in the following provisions of this Part of this Act’, should be read as implying 

that immunity should only be accorded if the state is acting ‘within the Law of Nations’.251 

In his view, since the prohibition against torture is a norm belonging to the corpus of jus 

cogens and its violation amounts to an international crime, it should override state 

immunity.252  

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith disagreed with this understanding: 

 
‘The argument is, however, that international law against torture is so fundamental that it is a 

jus cogens, or compelling law, which overrides all other principles of international law, 

including the well-established principles of sovereign immunity. No authority is cited for this 

proposition. 253 

‘… [T]he Act [the SIA] is a comprehensive code and is not subject to overriding 

considerations. At common law, a sovereign State could not be sued at all against its will in the 

courts of this country. The 1978 Act, by the exceptions therein set out, marks substantial 

inroads into this principle. It is inconceivable, it seems to me, that the draughtsman, who must 

have been well aware of the various international agreements about torture, intended Section 1 

to be subject to an overriding qualification.’254  

 

His Lordship further supported his position by assessing the case-law of United 

States courts on the matter. The US, as the UK, has a codification of the law of state 

immunity. In Argentine Republic v Amerada Hess Shipping Corporation, the United States

96  

Supreme Court established the FSIA was the sole basis to obtain jurisdiction over a foreign 

state in the courts of the US—in the words of Chief Justice Rehnquist, who delivered the 

opinion of the court, Congress dealt ‘comprehensively with the subject of foreign 

sovereign immunity in the FSIA…’255. In Siderman de Blake v Argentina, the US Court of 

Appeals for the Ninth District, although mentioning that the theory according to which a 

state’s violation of jus cogens would not be entitled to immunity under international law 

was compelling, concluded that, in the light of the Supreme Court’s holding in Amerada 

Hess, the violation of jus cogens norms committed outside the United States does not 

confer jurisdiction to the courts of the United States since the FSIA does not provide for 

such an exception to state immunity.256 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith understood that, in this 

regard, the SIA functioned like the FSIA in the reading given by the Supreme Court to this 

statute. He also argued domestic courts are not an appropriate forum to assert jurisdiction 

                                                
255 Argentine Republic v Amerada Hess Shipping Corporation (1989) 488 US 428 (Supreme Court of the 
United States), 438. 
256 Siderman de Blake v Argentina (1992) 965 F.2d 699 (United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit), 718-
719. Circuit Judge Fletcher pronounced himself in the following way:  
 

‘The question in the present case is what flows from the Sidermans’ allegation that Argentina 
tortured Jose Siderman and thereby violated a jus cogens norm. The Sidermans contend that 
when a foreign state’s act violates jus cogens, the state is not entitled to sovereign immunity 
with respect to that act.  
‘… As a matter of international law, the Sidermans’ argument carries much force.  
‘… The Sidermans posit that because sovereign immunity derives from international law, jus 
cogens supersedes it. … International law does not recognize an act that violates jus cogens as 
a sovereign act. A state’s violation of the jus cogens norm prohibiting official torture therefore 
would not be entitled to the immunity afforded by international law.  
‘Unfortunately, we do not write on a clean slate. We deal not only with customary international 
law, but with an affirmative Act of Congress, the FSIA. We must interpret the FSIA through 
the prism of Amerada Hess. Nothing in the text or legislative history of the FSIA explicitly 
addresses the effect violations of jus cogens might have on the FSIA’s cloak of immunity. 
Argentina contends that the Supreme Court’s statement in Amerada Hess that the FSIA grants 
immunity “in those cases involving alleged violations of international law that do not come 
within one of the FSIA’s exceptions,” 488 U.S. at 436, 109 S.Ct. at 688, precludes the 
Sidermans’ reliance on jus cogens in this case. Clearly, the FSIA does not specifically provide 
for an exception to sovereign immunity based on jus cogens. In Amerada Hess, the Court had 
no occasion to consider acts of torture or other violations of the peremptory norms of 
international law, and such violations admittedly differ in kind from transgressions of jus 
dispositivum, the norms derived from international agreements or customary international law 
with which the Amerada Hess Court dealt. However, the Court was so emphatic in its 
pronouncement “that immunity is granted in those cases involving alleged violations of 
international law that do not come within one of the FSIA’s exceptions,” Amerada Hess, 488 
U.S. at 436, 109 S.Ct. at 688, and so specific in its formulation and method of approach, id. at 
439, 109 S.Ct. at 690 (“Having determined that the FSIA provides the sole basis for obtaining 
jurisdiction over a foreign state in federal court, we turn to whether any of the exceptions 
enumerated in the Act apply here”), that we conclude that if violations of jus cogens committed 
outside the United States are to be exceptions to immunity, Congress must make them so. The 
fact that there has been a violation of jus cogens does not confer jurisdiction under the FSIA.’ 
 



97  

over an uncooperative foreign sovereign in respect of violations of jus cogens committed 

outside the territory of the forum state: 

 
‘The courts in the United Kingdom are open to all who seek their help, whether they are British 

citizens or not. A vast number of people come to this country each year seeking refuge and 

asylum, and many of these allege that they have been tortured in the country whence they 

came. Some of these claims are no doubt justified, others are more doubtful. Those who are 

presently charged with the responsibility for deciding whether applicants are genuine refugees 

have a difficult enough task, but at least they know much of the background and surrounding 

circumstances against which the claim is made. The court would be in no such position. The 

foreign State would be unlikely to submit to the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom court, and 

in its absence the court would have no means of testing the claim or making a just 

determination.’257  

 

Lord Justice Ward took note he found ‘powerful’ the submission state immunity is 

trumped by jus cogens under international law. As put by him: 

 
‘Not to accede to it would have the ironic result that there may be no international forum (other 

than the forum of the locus delicti to whom a victim of torture will be understandably reluctant 

to turn) where this terrible, if established, wrong can receive civil redress.’258 

 

Nevertheless, he agreed with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith that the SIA bound the 

Court and that only the exceptions to state immunity expressly provided for in this statute 

could be accepted: 

 
‘It is inconceivable that Parliament legislated for the loss of State immunity when the acts 

causing that person injury are committed in the United Kingdom without having borne in mind 

 its clearest international obligations to recognize the fundamental freedom from torture which 

everyone should enjoy everywhere. Unfortunately, the Act is as plain as plain can be. A 

foreign State enjoys no immunity for acts causing personal injury committed in the United 

Kingdom and if that is expressly provided for the conclusion is impossible to escape that State 

immunity is afforded in respect of acts of torture committed outside this jurisdiction.’259

3.1.7.2 The Jones case 

 

3.1.7.2.1 Judgment of the High Court (2003)  

 

The facts of the case were described as follows by the High Court. Mr Jones, a 

British national, worked as an international tax adviser in Saudi Arabia, when he got 

injured as a result of a ‘bomb blast outside a bookstore’ in the city of Riyadh and was 

taken to a hospital.260  He alleged that, on 16 March 2001, agents of the Kingdom of Saudi 

Arabia ‘took him from the hospital and falsely imprisoned him in solitary confinement’, 

where, for sixty-seven days, he was ‘systematically abused and tortured’ by Lieutenant 

Colonel Abdul Aziz.261 Mr Jones sued the Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi 

Arabia and Lieutenant Colonel Abdul Aziz ‘… for damages including aggravated and 

exemplary damages for assault and battery and trespass to the person, torture and unlawful 

imprisonment on and between 16 March and 21 May 2001.’262 The High Court asserted 

there was no doubt Mr Jones’s allegations amounted to torture.263

Court), 637. 
261 ibid. 
262 ibid 636. 
263 ibid 637-638: 
 

‘5. That the allegations made against the defendant in this case amount to torture is plain. The 
claimant alleges that he was beaten on the palms of the hand with a cane about 4ft long with 
hands cuffed behind him with the back palms uppermost; of being beaten on the soles of the 
feet with a cane and also a wooden stave resembling an axe handle and being beaten on the 
arms, buttocks and lower legs with a wooden stave resembling an axe handle; of slapping and 
relatively mild punching in the facial area; of suspension of the cuffed hands above the level of 
his head by attaching them to window fitments; of the shackling of his ankles; of sleep 
deprivation achieved through being put in partly suspended postures; of being struck anywhere 
on the body both with and without weapons and being disturbed by noise and by the 
administration of mind-affecting drugs and other substances.  
‘6. The claimant says that the result of the injuries he sustained was, at the time, severe pain, 
discomfort, bruising and swelling and physical and mental trauma. The claimant says that he 
now suffers from substantial mental trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder, is severely 
psychologically disabled and is unable to work. He is undergoing treatment and a course of 
medication but the prospect for speedy recovery is poor. There is consequently a considerable 
claim for loss of future earnings and the overall value of the claim is put by the claimant at 
something in the region of £2.5m.’ 
 



99  

The High Court followed the approach the Court of Appeal had adopted in Al-

Adsani v Government of Kuwait and others: it held that the SIA was a comprehensive 

code, ‘intended to make new provisions for sovereign immunity replacing the common law 

in its entirety in relation to civil claims.’264 Accordingly, the High Court found the SIA did 

not provide any exception to state immunity applicable to the claims of the plaintiff.265 The 

High Court added the ECtHR in Al-Adsani v the United Kingdom found the English courts 

in Al-Adsani v Government of Kuwait and others had not violated Article 6 of the 

ECHR.266 Although the High Court regretted the missed opportunity the ECtHR had and 

considered the minority dissenting opinions attached to the judgment ‘compelling’, it 

asserted that 

 
‘… unless Parliament specifically amends the State Immunity Act in this respect, or another 

case comes before the European Court of Human Rights in which the minority view in Al-

Adsani prevails, so that our courts can thereafter consider the making of a declaration of 

incompatibility in respect of the 1978 [State Immunity] Act as it applies to civil actions for 

torture, the Act deprives me and the English courts of jurisdiction over the first defendant in 

this case. For that reason, with the greatest sympathy for the claimant, I must allow the 

application of the first defendant and dismiss the claim against them.’267 

 

The High Court also decided Mr Jones’s torturer, Lieutenant Colonel Abdul Aziz, 

was entitled to the same immunity accorded to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, since the 

claim against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was pleaded on the basis of its vicarious 

responsibility for the acts of Lieutenant Colonel Abdul Aziz.268 According to the High 

Court, 

 
‘To reach a conclusion that the first defendant [the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia] was not liable by 

reason of state immunity while holding that they are vicarious liable for the second defendant 

[Lieutenant Colonel Abdul Aziz] would undo the result reached in the Al-Adsani case.’269

3.1.7.2.2 Judgment of the Court of Appeal (2004)  

 

Mr Jones appealed against the decision of the High Court. The Court of Appeal 

joined Mr Jones’s case with another similar case brought by Messrs Mitchell and Sampson 

(British nationals) and Mr Walker (a Canadian national) against Ibrahim Al-Dali, Khalid 

Al-Saleh, Colonel Mohamed Al-Said and Prince Naif, all Saudi Arabian nationals and who 

were, at the time, respectively, a captain in the Saudi Arabian police force, a lieutenant in 

the Saudi Arabian police force, a colonel in the Ministry of Interior and Deputy Governor 

of the Al Ha’ir prison, and head of the Ministry of the Interior.270 These claimants had also 

allegedly been systematically tortured whilst under official custody in the Kingdom of 

Saudi Arabia and had also had their applications dismissed by the High Court on the same 

grounds of its previous ruling in respect of Mr Jones’s application.271   

Lord Justice Mance understood the Court of Appeal had to settle two questions:  

 
‘First, is the Kingdom entitled to immunity in respect of Mr Jones’s claim, which it accepts has 

been served on it? Second, is the Kingdom entitled to claim immunity on behalf of its officials 

in respect of the claims made against those officials in both Mr Jones’s and Messrs Mitchell’s, 

Sampson’s and Walker’s claims?’272  

 

Lord Justice Mance did not depart from the position the Court of Appeal took in Al-

Adsani v Government of Kuwait, which considered that the SIA was a ‘comprehensive 

code, and that, although international law prohibited torture, no express or implied 

exception to immunity existed in cases of torture.’273 In the same way, Lord Justice Mance 

remembered the ECtHR had decided that the restriction imposed on Article 6.1 of the 

ECHR by the English courts pursued a legitimate aim and was proportionate.274 Recalling 

the decision of the majority in Al-Adsani v United Kingdom and one of the passages in 

Hazel Fox’s treatise on the law of state immunity275, Lord Justice Mance did not accept the

275 Hazel Fox, The Law of State Immunity (2nd edn, OUP 2002) 525:  
 

‘State immunity is a procedural rule going to the jurisdiction of a national court. It does not go 
to substantive law; it does not contradict a prohibition contained in a jus cogens norm but 
merely diverts any breach of it to a different method of settlement. Arguably then, there is no 



101  

submission that the jus cogens nature of the prohibition of torture prevailed over the 

hierarchically inferior rules of state immunity: 

 
‘The recognition under general principles of international law of civil immunity on the part of 

a state from civil suit in a state other than that of the alleged torture does not sanction the 

torture or qualify the prohibition upon it. It qualifies the jurisdictions in which and means by 

which the peremptory norms may be enforced. There is a distinction between principles of 

substantive international law and other issues, such as jurisdiction and immunity in civil 

proceedings in any particular jurisdiction …’276  

 

Lord Justice Mance turned next to the question of whether Article 14 of the CAT 

required the United Kingdom to establish a civil right of redress for its nationals who were 

victims of torture abroad. Article 14 of the CAT provides that:  

 
‘1. Each State Party shall ensure in its legal system that the victim of an act of torture obtains 

redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation, including the means 

for as full rehabilitation as possible. In the event of the death of the victim as a result of an act 

of torture, his dependants shall be entitled to compensation. 

‘2. Nothing in this article shall affect any right of the victim or other persons to compensation 

which may exist under national law.’277  

 

Lord Justice Mance considered that 

 
‘… the article does not state expressly whether there must be any or what connection between 

the state which must ensure such redress and either the act or the victim. … [I]t seems unlikely 

that it can have been intended that every state should ensure that its legal system provided 

redress for every act of torture by the public officials (or by other persons acting in an official 

capacity) of other states, wherever committed and whoever the victim.’278 

 

To properly interpret Article 14 of the CAT, Lord Justice Mance compared it with 

Articles 4 and 5 of the same treaty, which establish rules concerning criminal jurisdiction:  

 
                                                                                                                                              

substantive content in the procedural plea of State immunity upon which a jus cogens mandate 
can bite.’

‘Article 4 

‘1. Each State Party shall ensure that all acts of torture are offences under its criminal law. The 

same shall apply to an attempt to commit torture and to an act by any person which constitutes 

complicity or participation in torture.  

‘2. Each State Party shall make these offences punishable by appropriate penalties which take 

into account their grave nature. 

‘Article 5 

‘1. Each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction 

over the offences referred to in article 4 in the following cases: 

‘(a) When the offences are committed in any territory under its jurisdiction or on board a ship 

or aircraft registered in that State; 

‘(b) When the alleged offender is a national of that State; 

‘(c) When the victim is a national of that State if that State considers it appropriate. 

‘2. Each State Party shall likewise take such measures as may be necessary to establish its 

jurisdiction over such offences in cases where the alleged offender is present in any territory 

under its jurisdiction and it does not extradite him pursuant to article 8 to any of the States 

mentioned in paragraph I of this article. 

‘3. This Convention does not exclude any criminal jurisdiction exercised in accordance with 

internal law.’279 
 

Mirroring Article 5.1.a, Lord Justice Mance considered Article 14 could be 

interpreted to mean that ‘… it is only concerned to ensure a right of redress in the state 

where an act of torture is committed.’280 Further building upon the definition of torture 

enshrined in Article 1 of the CAT, according to which torture ‘… is inflicted by or at the 

instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting 

in an official capacity’, His Lordship asserted that ‘it would seem curious if each state 

were not required to ensure a civil right of redress in respect of torture committed abroad 

by one of its officers’.281 However, as added by Lord Justice Mance, neither of these 

interpretations would require the United Kingdom to provide means of redress regarding 

an act of torture committed abroad by a foreign official. He further justified this 

understanding by mentioning that Article 5.1.c. leaves to the discretion of the state whether 

to exercise or not criminal jurisdiction on the basis that the victim of torture was one of its 

nationals, so that it would be improbable that states would be required to establish civil

103  

jurisdiction on the same basis.282 On this matter, Lord Justice Mance concluded the 

following: 

 
‘… article 14(1) is dealing with (no more than) a right of redress in the legal system of the state 

(state A) by whose official (or other person acting in a public capacity) the alleged act of 

torture was committed (whether such act was committed at home in state A or abroad). State A 

is, in short, the responsible state, and it must ensure proper civil redress. Article 14(1) is not 

designed to require every other state (state B) to provide redress in its civil legal system for 

acts of torture committed in state A, although under article 14(2) it remains permissible for 

state B to provide redress in state B for acts of torture committed (either in state A or 

elsewhere) by officials, etc. of state A.’283  

 

Having held that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was entitled to immunity, Lord 

Justice Mance moved to the question of whether immunity should extend to the acts and 

omissions amounting to torture of the individual defendants, who were ordinary state 

officials.284 As pointed out by him, a state’s claim to immunity ratione materiae with 

respect to a claim against its officials differs from the immunity ratione personae of the 

state itself.285 One of the crucial issues discussed by Lord Justice Mance was the assertion 

of the Court of Appeal in Propend that 

 
‘The protection afforded by the [State Immunity] Act of 1978 to States would be undermined if 

employees, officers (or as one authority puts it, “functionaries”) could be sued as individuals 

for matters of State conduct in respect of which the State they were serving had immunity. 

Section 14(1) [of the SIA 1978] must be read as affording to individual employees or officers 

of a foreign State protection under the same cloak as protects the State itself.’286 

 

Lord Justice Mance remarked that the SIA makes no reference to individual 

officials of the state—under Section 14.1 of the SIA, references to ‘state’ in the statute 

include ‘the sovereign or other head of that state in his public capacity’, ‘the government 

of that state’ and ‘any department of that government’.287 As observed by Hazel Fox and

287 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 270) 663-664 and 668. As 
regards Section 14.2 of the SIA, which deals with ‘separate entities’, Lord Justice Mance recalled that the 



104  

Philippa Webb, it seems that His Lordship took the position that Section 14.1 deals with 

immunity ratione personae, but, if it applied to immunity ratione materiae, it should be 

read as not including conducts which are outside the scope of the proper exercise of 

sovereignty, such as international crimes.288 Lord Justice Mance asserted that, in spite of it 

being defined by Article 1 of the CAT as an act ‘by or at the instigation of or with the 

consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official 

capacity’289, torture did not fall in the scope of immunity ratione materiae:  

 
‘It seems doubtful that the phrase “acting in an official capacity” qualifies the reference to “a 

public official”. The types of purpose for which any pain or suffering must be inflicted … 

would appear to represent a sufficient limitation in the case of a public official. Be that as it 

may, the requirement that the pain or suffering be inflicted by a public official does no more in 

my view than identify the author and the public context in which the author must be acting. It 

does not lend to the acts of torture themselves any official or governmental character or nature, 

                                                                                                                                              
Court of Appeal in Propend had considered it not to be relevant in respect of individual functionaries. See 
Propend (n 286) 670 (footnote omitted): 
 

‘The concept of an “entity … distinct from the executive organs of the government of the State 
and capable of suing or being sued” is not one which would normally be identified with an 
individual or natural person. Its background and history suggest that the concept was 
introduced to address the problem presented by artificial legal entities exercising public 
functions. Lord Goff in the Kuwait Airways case … pointed out that the language makes it 
probable that the section has in mind entities “of” or, in other words, created by the State in 
question. Where such an artificial entity exists and is entitled to immunity, then its servants or 
officers would of course benefit by immunity in similar fashion to the officers or functionaries 
of a State entitled to immunity. Further, an individual might possess status as a corporation 
sole or similar status which could constitute him in that capacity a “separate entity” for the 
purposes of Section 14.’ 

 
288 Hazel Fox and Philippa Webb, The Law of State Immunity (3rd edn, OUP 2013) 182-184. See Lord 
Mance, Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 270) 663-664: 
 

‘Section 14(1) on its face reflects the personal immunity that those identified would, apart from 
it, enjoy under both international and common law. If, which I doubt, it goes in its express 
terms any further, they must, on any view, be read subject to qualification to reflect the 
distinction between personal and subject-matter immunity.’ 

 
Hazel Fox and Philippa Webb added that, in the same judgment, Lord Phillips interpreted Section 14.1 as 
referring to immunity ratione materiae. In any case, he also understood that conducts like torture were 
outside the scope of immunity ratione materiae. See Lord Phillips, Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 270) 711: 
 

‘That principle [established in Propend] has no application if (i) the state’s immunity is not “in 
respect of conduct” but is ratione personae and (ii) the subject matter of the action does not 
rank as “matters of state conduct”. That is the position in the present case and, for that reason, 
the Propend case does not establish that state immunity attaches to the claims against the 
individual defendants.’

or mean that it can in any way be regarded as an official function to inflict, or that an official 

can be regarded as representing the state in inflicting, such pain or suffering. Still less does it 

suggest that the official inflicting such pain or suffering can be afforded the cloak of state 

immunity. … The whole tenor of the Torture Convention is to underline the individual 

responsibility of state officials for acts of torture … and I do not consider that one can derive 

from its definition of torture “for the purposes of the Convention” any conclusion on the 

different question whether a state can assert state immunity in respect of a civil claim against 

its officials based on allegations of systematic torture.’290  

 

Lord Justice Mance emphasized that, after the House of Lords’ judgment in Ex 

parte Pinochet (No 3), which related to criminal proceedings against a former head of 

state, the issue of civil jurisdiction should be considered under a new light.291 Taking this 

into account, His Lordship made some considerations. Firstly, he could not see how civil 

proceedings against an alleged torturer would involve a greater degree of interference in 

the domestic affairs of a state when compared to criminal proceedings—also, there would 

be ‘… no basis on which the state could be made liable to indemnify one of its officials 

proved to have committed systematic torture’.292 Secondly, Lord Justice Mance referred to 

the ‘obvious potential for anomalies’ if the provisions of the CAT on international criminal 

jurisdiction are not matched ‘… by some wider parallel power to adjudicate over civil 

claims’—it would be, according to him, incongruous that ‘if the alleged torturer was 

actually within and being prosecuted in the jurisdiction of the forum State pursuant to 

Article 5(2) of the Torture Convention … no immunity could be claimed, [but] the 

victim(s) of the alleged torture would be unable to pursue any civil claim.’293 Thirdly, he 

argued criminal proceedings have ‘a higher onus and evidential difficulties’ and states may 

have reasons to pursue or not criminal proceedings, and that makes civil proceedings 

valuable not only because of the potential financial recovery for the victims, but also in the 

process of truth-finding, rehabilitation and closure.294 Finally, he considered that the 

difficulties regarding extraterritorial jurisdiction and execution would not justify ‘… the 

possession by the foreign state of a blanket claim to immunity in respect of such an official 

or agent in a case of alleged systematic torture.’295

106  

Lord Justice Mance considered the impact of Article 6 of the ECHR on civil 

immunity. Having already concluded that, in the light of the ECtHR’s judgment in Al-

Adsani v United Kingdom, the grant of immunity to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia did not 

infringe Article 6 of the ECHR, Lord Justice Mance assessed the impact of the same 

provision on the different issue of immunity ratione materiae of state officials. He found 

that, unlike in respect of the immunity ratione personae of the state itself and the immunity 

ratione materiae of state officials for misconducts that not amount to international crimes, 

‘there [was] no settled practice in relation to serious international crimes …’.296 Lord 

Justice Mance asserted it would be disproportionate to simply guarantee a blanket 

immunity for state officials who allegedly committed acts of systematic torture.297 He 

reasoned as follows. Under Article 14 of the CAT states have to ‘… ensure in its legal 

system that the victim of an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to 

fair and adequate compensation, including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible’. 

If the state where the torture occurred or by whose official the torture was committed 

provided an adequate and effective domestic remedy, other states would be expected to 

abstain from exercising jurisdiction over the matter. In Lord Justice Mance’s view, in the 

absence of such remedy, it could be disproportionate for other states to simply maintain a 

blanket immunity in respect of civil proceedings.298 Lord Justice Mance added that, under 

the Human Rights Act, inasmuch as possible, primary legislation, like the SIA 1978, has to 

be read and applied in a way which is compatible with the ECHR, and that 

 
‘[t]here is nothing in the 1978 Act [the SIA] which expressly covers the civil liability of state 

officials against whom conduct is alleged constituting serious international crime. The gap 

cannot be filled by a simple assertion that the immunity possessed by a state should be mirrored 

                                                
296 Jones v Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and another (n 270) 696. 
297 ibid 696-697. Emphasizing once again the difference between a claim against the state itself and a claim 
against state officials, Lord Justice Mance remarked that, 
 

‘[a]lthough torture by one of its officials is a matter for which a state may be made civilly 
responsible under article 14(1), any claim to enforce that responsibility must be pursued in the 
state in question (or in an international forum), otherwise state immunity will still bar it. But, if 
claims against officials committing torture in the official capacity can be pursued elsewhere, 
the state will not be impleaded in any direct sense, and will not be obliged to indemnify any 
official or agent found to have committed systematic torture. Insofar as there may be said that 
there is interference in a foreign state’s domestic affairs or that a foreign state is being 
indirectly impleaded, this would occur in civil proceedings in respects no more far-reaching 
than those already permitted in criminal proceedings under the Torture Convention or (on one 
view) under more general international legal principles.’ 

 
298 ibid.

by an immunity possessed by the official whose act or omission has given rise to the state's 

immunity. … 

 ‘… [I]t can no longer be appropriate give blanket effect to a foreign state’s claim to state 

immunity ratione materiae in respect of a state official alleged to have committed acts of 

systematic torture. To do so could deprive the right of access to a court under article 6 [of the 

ECHR] of real meaning in a case where the victim of torture had no prospect of recourse in the 

state whose officials committed the torture.’299  

 

Lord Justice Mance allowed the claimants’ appeal in respect of the individual 

defendants: 

 
‘I would however conclude ... that, even apart from the Human Rights Convention, a foreign 

state cannot possess (either under international law or under English common law and the 

United Kingdom’s 1978 Act) any absolute right to claim immunity in respect of civil claims 

against its officials for systematic torture, even committed outside the country of suit. Further, 

in a jurisdiction like the English I would consider that it should be possible to cater for any 

concerns about the exercise of jurisdiction in respect of such claims by appropriate use or 

development of discretionary principles relating to the exercise of jurisdiction. But, even if that 

were not so either here or elsewhere, it seems to me that any absolute view of immunity must 

at the very least yield in the face of assertions of systematic torture to a more nuanced or 

proportionate approach. As it is, having regard to the [ECHR], it is sufficient to decide this 

appeal that, whether issues of state immunity are or are not treated as theoretically separate 

from issues of jurisdiction in English law, the permissibility, appropriateness and 

proportionality of exercising jurisdiction ought to be determined at one and the same time. 

Such a conclusion reflects the importance attaching in today’s world and in current 

international thinking and jurisprudence to the recognition and effective enforcement of 

individual human rights. It fits harmoniously with the position already achieved in relation to 

criminal proceedings. It caters for our obligation under article 6 of the European Convention 

on Human Rights not to deny access to our courts, in circumstances where it would otherwise 

be appropriate to exercise jurisdiction applying domestic jurisdictional principles, unless to do 

so would be in pursuit of a legitimate aim and proportionate. It also caters for all legitimate 

considerations, arising from the special position of states and the delicacy of suits indirectly

involving them and their affairs. It does so by allowing ample scope for the sensitive handling 

of claims such as the present which is unquestionably necessary. ...’300 

 

Lord Phillips agreed with Lord Justice Mance’s conclusions. He shared the view 

that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was entitled to immunity, in conformity with what had 

been established in Al-Adsani v Government and Kuwait (Court of Appeal) and in Al-

Adsani v United Kingdom (ECtHR).301 Accordingly, Lord Phillips also held there is a 

distinction between the immunity ratione personae of the state itself and the immunity 

ratione materiae of state officials. The latter issue was not the subject-matter of the Al-

Adsani case. As recalled by Lord Phillips, the majority of the House of Lords in Ex parte 

Pinochet (No 3) had considered that the acts of torture with which Pinochet had been 

charged could not be considered official acts and attract immunity ratione materiae in 

relation to criminal proceedings, since such conduct was a violation of jus cogens. Lord 

Phillips considered there would be no reason to afford individuals immunity for acts of 

torture in respect of criminal proceedings and not do the same in respect of civil 

proceedings: 

 
‘Once the conclusion is reached that torture cannot be treated as the exercise of a state function 

so as to attract immunity ratione materiae in criminal proceedings against individuals, it seems 

to me that it cannot logically be so treated in civil proceedings against individuals.302 

‘… If civil proceedings are brought against individuals for acts of torture in circumstances 

where the state is immune from suit ratione personae, there can be no suggestion that the state 

is vicariously liable. It is the personal responsibility of the individuals, not that of the state, 

which is in issue. The state is not indirectly impleaded by the proceedings.’303  

 

Lord Phillips argued the ECtHR would reach the same conclusion if confronted 

with this matter: 

 
‘Had the Grand Chamber been considering a claim for state immunity in relation to claims 

brought against individuals, I do not believe that there would have been a majority in favour of 

the view that this represented a legitimate limitation on the right to access to a court under 

Article 6(1). Had the Court shared the conclusions that we have reached on this appeal, it 

would have held that there was no recognised rule of public international law that conferred

109  

such immunity. Had it concluded that there was such a rule, I consider that it would have been 

likely to have held that it would not be proportionate to apply the rule so as to preclude civil 

remedies sought against individuals.’304 

 

3.1.7.2.3 Judgment of the House of Lords (2006) 

 

The case reached the House of Lords. The claimants appealed against the grant of 

immunity to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, whilst the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia appealed 

against the decision regarding the state officials.  

Lord Bingham considered the relationship between two principles of international 

law was the crux of the legal dispute: 

 
‘One principle, historically the older of the two, is that one sovereign state will not, save in 

certain specified instances, assert its judicial authority over another.  The second principle, of 

more recent vintage but of the highest authority among principles of international law, is one 

that condemns and criminalises the official practice of torture, requires states to suppress the 

practice and provides for the trial and punishment of officials found to be guilty of it. … The 

House [of Lords] must consider the balance currently struck in international law [between these 

two principles] …’ 305  

 

Lord Bingham observed that the logic of the international instruments (the ECSI 

and the UNCJISP) and of the various domestic statutes on state immunity was to establish 

immunity as a general rule and to specify a number of exceptions to this rule. He argued 

that, although the SIA 1978 does not have a specific provision governing immunity in 

respect of claims brought against officials of a foreign state for acts they practiced in the 

foreign state, there was a ‘… wealth of authority to show that in such case the foreign state 

is entitled to claim immunity for its servants as it could if sued itself. The foreign state’s 

right to immunity cannot be circumvented by suing its servants or agents.’306  

Lord Bingham added the UNCJISP addressed this issue and in its Article 2.1.b.iv it 

was established that ‘representatives of the State acting in that capacity’ were comprised in 

the definition of state. Accordingly, Article 6.2.b provides that

‘… [a] proceeding before a court of a State shall be considered to have been instituted against 

another State if that other State … is not named as a party to the proceeding but the proceeding 

in effect seeks to affect the property, rights, interests or activities of that other State.’307  

 

Unlike what was ruled by the Court of Appeal, to Lord Bingham, the conduct of the 

defendants was undoubtedly in discharge or purported discharge of their public duties.308 

Lord Bingham considered that any act attributable to the state for the purpose of state 

responsibility is an ‘official act’ for the purpose of immunity ratione materiae of state 

officials.309 Therefore, immunity could not be refused on the grounds of the unlawfulness 

of a given conduct: 
 

‘International law does not require, as a condition of a state’s entitlement to claim immunity 

for the conduct of its servant or agent, that the latter should have been acting in accordance 

with his instructions or authority. A state may claim immunity for any act for which it is, in 

international law, responsible, save where an established exception applies. 

‘… The fact that conduct is unlawful or objectionable is not, of itself, a ground for refusing 

immunity.’310 

 

Lord Bingham asserted that a ‘straightforward’ application of the SIA would lead 

to the conclusion that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its officials were entitled to 

immunity, insofar as the cases brought to the attention of the Court did not fall under the

309 ibid 718-719. Lord Bingham relied on Articles 4 and 7 of the DARSIWA 2001 to convey this point. 
Oddly, he did not refer to Article 58 of the DARSIWA, which states that the articles ‘… are without 
prejudice to any question of the individual responsibility under international law of any person acting on 
behalf of a State.’ ILC, ‘Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with

‘Article 4. Conduct of organs of a State 
‘1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international 
law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, 
whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an 
organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State. 
‘2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal 
law of the State.’ 
 
 ‘Article 7. Excess of authority or contravention of instructions  
‘The conduct of an organ of a State or of a person or entity empowered to exercise elements of 
the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law if the 
organ, person or entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes 
instructions.’

exceptions provided for in the statute—thus, unlike the Court of Appeal, Lord Bingham 

considered there was no distinction between the claim against the Kingdom of Saudi 

Arabia and the claim against the state officials.311  

However, the claimants had also argued that this interpretation of the SIA 

provisions would violate Article 6 of the ECHR and that, as mandated by Section 3 of the 

Human Rights Act 1989, ‘[s]o far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and 

subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the 

[ECHR].’312 Lord Bingham disagreed that Article 6 of the ECHR was engaged by the grant 

of immunity, since, according to him, ‘the rule of international law is not that a state 

should not exercise jurisdiction over another state a jurisdiction which it has but that (save 

in cases recognized by international law) a state has no jurisdiction over another state’313, 

so it would not make sense to consider that a state was denying a jurisdiction that it did not 

have in the first place. Nevertheless, Lord Bingham decided to accept the ruling of the 

ECtHR in Al-Adsani v United Kingdom, which had held Article 6 to be engaged. In the 

jurisprudence of the ECtHR, any limitation to the right of access to court must pursue a 

legitimate aim and be proportionate. The claimants contended that the grant of immunity in 

the case did not fulfill these requirements, insofar as it would result in an inconsistency 

with the jus cogens norm of prohibition of torture. Furthermore, as previously discussed, 

they had argued torture could not be considered an official act entitled to immunity ratione 

materiae.  

Lord Bingham disagreed with the submission of the claimants in this regard, which 

had been previously upheld in the Court of Appeal: 

 
‘It is, I think, difficult to accept that torture cannot be a governmental or official act, since 

under article 1 of the Torture Convention torture must, to qualify as such, be inflicted by or 

with the connivance of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. The 

claimants’ argument encounters the difficulty that it is founded on the Torture Convention; but 

to bring themselves within the Torture Convention they must show that the torture was (to 

paraphrase the definition) official; yet they argue that the conduct was not official in order to 

defeat the claim to immunity.’314

112  

The claimants had referred to the practice of US courts not to recognize violations 

of jus cogens as official acts for the purposes of immunity of state officials. Lord Bingham 

considered that the position of the US courts in this matter was not relevant because it was 

not shared by other states. In order to support this point, Lord Bingham referred to the 

following excerpt of the joint separate opinion of Judges Higgins, Kooijmans and 

Buergenthal annexed to the ICJ’s judgment in the Arrest Warrant case: 
 

‘The contemporary trends, reflecting international relations as they stand at the beginning of 

the new century, are striking. The movement is towards bases of jurisdiction other than 

territoriality. “Effects” or “impact” jurisdiction is embraced both by the United States and, with 

certain qualifications, by the European Union. Passive personality jurisdiction, for so long 

regarded as controversial, is now reflected not only in the legislation of various countries (the 

United States, Ch. 113A, 1986 Omnibus Diplomatic and Antiterrorism Act; France, Art. 689, 

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1975), and today meets with relatively little opposition, at least so 

far as a particular category of offences is concerned. 

‘In civil matters we already see the beginnings of a very broad form of extraterritorial 

jurisdiction. Under the Alien Tort Claims Act, the United States, basing itself on a law of 1789, 

has asserted a jurisdiction both over human rights violations and over major violations of 

international law, perpetrated by non-nationals overseas. Such jurisdiction, with the possibility 

of ordering payment of damages, has been exercised with respect to torture committed in a 

variety of countries (Paraguay, Chile, Argentina, Guatemala), and with respect to other major 

human rights violations in yet other countries. While this unilateral exercise of the function of 

guardian of international values has been much commented on, it has not attracted the 

approbation of States generally.’315 

 

The reference of the claimants to the decision of the Italian Court of Cassation in 

Ferrini was not successful either. As previously discussed, in Ferrini, the Court of 

Cassation expressed its disapproval of the ECtHR’s judgment in Al-Adsani v United 

Kingdom and of the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario’s judgment in Bouzari v Islamic 

Republic of Iran. According to the Italian Court of Cassation, since jus cogens norms are 

hierarchically superior and the emergence of the principle of respect to fundamental human 

rights as a fundamental principle of the international legal order impacted upon the scope 

of the principle of sovereign equality, the argument that there was not an explicit norm 

providing for a jus cogens exception to state immunity could not carry the day. Lord

113  

Bingham criticized the assertion of the Court of Cassation according to which the principle 

of universal jurisdiction applied to civil actions arising from international crimes.316 He 

considered that the judgment of the Court of Cassation in Ferrini was not ‘an accurate 

statement of international law as generally understood’—in his words, ‘one swallow does 

not make a rule of international law.’317  

Lord Bingham also understood that Article 14 of the CAT did not provide for 

universal civil jurisdiction in respect of acts of torture not committed in the state of the 

forum. The claimants had referred to a commentary of the Committee against Torture in 

response to the periodic report submitted by Canada. The Committee recommended that 

Canada ‘should review its position under article 14 of the Convention to ensure the 

provision of compensation through its civil jurisdiction to all victims of torture.’318 Lord 

Bingham argued this recommendation was not binding in international law. 319  His 

Lordship also referred to the declaration made by the US in respect of Article 14 of the 

CAT, according to which Article 14 ‘… requires a State Party to provide a private right of 

action for damages only for acts of torture committed in territory under the jurisdiction of 

that State Party.’320

Against Torture reiterated the understanding that Article 14 requires States parties to provided universal civil 
jurisdiction in the following terms:  
 

‘22. … The Committee considers that the application of article 14 is not limited to victims who 
were harmed in the territory of the State party or by or against nationals of the State party. The 
Committee has commended the efforts of States parties for providing civil remedies for victims 
who were subjected to torture or ill-treatment outside their territory. This is particularly 
important when a victim is unable to exercise the rights guaranteed under article 14 in the 
territory where the violation took place. Indeed, article 14 requires States parties to ensure that 
all victims of torture and ill-treatment are able to access remedy and obtain redress. 
‘… 
‘42. … [G]ranting immunity, in violation of international law, to any State or its agents or to 
non-State actors for torture or ill-treatment, is in direct conflict with the obligation of providing 
redress to victims. When impunity is allowed by law or exists de facto, it bars victims from 
seeking full redress as it allows the violators to go unpunished and denies victims full 
assurance of their rights under article 14. The Committee affirms that under no circumstances 
may arguments of national security be used to deny redress for victims.’

114  

On the other hand, Lord Bingham found the four arguments put forth by the 

defendants ‘cumulatively irresistible’.321 Firstly, the ICJ in the Arrest Warrant case did not 

find any exception under customary international law to the rule according immunity from 

criminal jurisdiction to incumbent Foreign Ministers, even in cases in which they are 

suspected of having committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. Logically, as put 

by Lord Bingham, it should follow that prohibitions of this character do not automatically 

prevail over other rules of international law. Moreover, the ICJ in Armed Activities on the 

Territory of the Congo concluded that ‘… the fact that a dispute relates to compliance with 

a norm having [a jus cogens character] … cannot of itself provide a basis for the 

jurisdiction of the Court to entertain that dispute’322. Secondly, he agreed that Article 14 of 

the CAT did not provide for universal civil jurisdiction.323 Thirdly, the UNCJISP did not 

provide for an exception from immunity in respect of civil claims based on violations of 

jus cogens.324 Finally, it was contended that an obligation to exercise universal jurisdiction 

over claims arising from breaches of jus cogen had not yet emerged in international law.325 

Based on these considerations, Lord Bingham found the SIA was ‘… not shown to be 

disproportionate as inconsistent with a peremptory norm of international law, and its 

application [did] not infringe the claimants’ right under article 6’.326  

Lord Bingham concluded the claims against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the 

individual defendants should have been dismissed—in his opinion, the Court of Appeal 

erred in law when it found the individual defendants were not entitled to immunity and 

asserted ‘a universal tort jurisdiction in cases of official torture … for which there was no 

adequate foundation in any international convention, state practice and scholarly 

consensus’327.  

Lord Hoffmann concurred with the judgment of Lord Bingham, further developing 

a few points. He did not accept there was a conflict between the jus cogens norm of 

prohibition of torture and a rule that accords immunity:

‘The jus cogens is the prohibition on torture. But the United Kingdom, in according state 

immunity to the Kingdom, is not proposing to torture anyone. Nor is the Kingdom, in claiming 

immunity, justifying the use of torture. It is objecting in limine to the jurisdiction of the 

English court to decide whether it used torture or not. … 

‘… To produce a conflict with state immunity, it is therefore necessary to show that the 

prohibition on torture has generated an ancillary procedural rule which, by way of exception to 

state immunity, entitles or perhaps requires states to assume civil jurisdiction over other states 

in cases in which torture is alleged. Such a rule may be desirable and, since international law 

changes, may have developed. But, contrary to the assertion of the minority in Al-Adsani, it is 

not entailed by the prohibition of torture.’328 

 

In further examining the relationship between jus cogens and state immunity, Lord 

Hoffmann criticized the decision of the Greek Court of Cassation in Prefecture of Voiotia v 

Federal Republic of Germany: 

 
‘The decision of the Greek Court of Cassation in Prefecture of Voiotia v Federal Republic of 

Germany, 4 May 2000 … went upon a theory of implied waiver which has received no support 

in other decisions. It was undermined by the court’s own refusal to order enforcement of the 

judgment and held to be wrong by a judgment of a special Supreme Court (the Anotato Eidiko 

Dikasterio) convened to decide cases involving the interpretation of international law: 

Margellos v Federal Republic of Germany … 17 September 2002. The original judgment was 

coldly received by the German Supreme Court when the claimants attempted to enforce it 

directly in Germany: Greek Citizens v Federal Republic of Germany (The Distomo Massacre 

Case) (2003) …’329 

 

Lord Hoffmann’s criticism of the decision of the Italian Court of Cassation in the 

Ferrini case was even sharper. According to him, the Italian Court of Cassation exhibited 

‘the same bare syllogistic reasoning as the judgment of the minority in Al-Adsani.’330 In a 

very interesting passage, Lord Hoffmann discusses the interpretation Pasquale de Sena and 

Francesca de Vittor gave to the Ferrini case, according to which the systematic approach 

adopted by the Italian Court of Cassation should be seen as giving primacy to the value of 

human rights over the value of sovereign immunity as a result of the balancing of these

330 ibid.  



116  

two fundamental principles of the international legal system.331 Lord Hoffmann argued that 

this technique was unacceptable in international law: 

 
‘I think that [‘giving priority to the values embodied in the prohibition of torture over the 

values and policies of the rules of state immunity’] is a fair interpretation of what the court was 

doing and, if the case had been concerned with domestic law, might have been regarded by 

some as “activist” but would have been well within the judicial function. As Professor 

Dworkin demonstrated in Law’s Empire (1986), the ordering of competing principles 

according to the importance of the values which they embody is a basic technique of 

adjudication. But the same approach cannot be adopted in international law, which is based 

upon the common consent of nations. It is not for a national court to “develop” international 

law by unilaterally adopting a version of that law which, however desirable, forward-looking 

and reflective of values it may be, is simply not accepted by other states.’332 

 

On the matter of the immunity of the individual defendants, Lord Hoffmann, 

following Lord Bingham, understood that ‘as a matter of international law, the same 

immunity against suit in a foreign domestic court which protects the state itself also 

protects the individual for whom the state is responsible’. 333  The terms ‘state’ and 

‘government’ in the SIA should, according to him, be understood as including state 

officials acting in that capacity, as a corollary of the principle that the SIA must be 

‘construed against the background of those principles of public international law as are 

generally recognised by the family of nations’334. In his view, although the CAT withdrew 

immunity in respect of criminal proceedings, it did not affect immunity for civil 

proceedings.335 Lord Hoffmann also agreed with Lord Bingham that an act attributable to 

the state for the purposes of international responsibility is an ‘official act’ for the purposes 

of immunity:  

 
‘It seems thus clear that a state will incur responsibility in international law if one of its 

officials, under colour of his authority, tortures a national of another state, even though the acts 

were unlawful and unauthorised. To hold that for the purposes of state immunity he was not 

acting in an official capacity would produce an asymmetry between the rules of liability and 

immunity.

117  

‘Furthermore, in the case of torture, there would be an even more striking asymmetry between 

the Torture Convention and the rules of immunity if it were to be held that the same act was 

official for the purposes of the definition of torture but not for the purposes of immunity …’ 336 

  

Also concurring with Lord Bingham, Lord Hoffmann considered the Court of 

Appeal had erred when it concluded that the definition of torture enshrined in the CAT (ie, 

that torture is an act ‘… inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or 

acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity’) did not lend 

it an official character.337  

The House of Lords ultimately held the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the 

individual defendants were entitled to immunity.

3.1.8.1 Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Bouzari and others v Islamic 

Republic of Iran (2004) 

 

The facts, as described in the judgment, were the following. Mr Houshang Bouzari, 

an Iranian national, who had been an advisor to the Minister of Petroleum and the state 

owned National Iranian Oil Company, left the Iranian government in 1987 to found his 

own consulting company.338 He eventually helped secure a deal between a consortium of 

companies seeking to engage in an oil and gas project in the Persian Gulf and the National 

Iranian Oil Company.339 Said consortium was to be paid $1.8 billion and Mr Bouzari’s 

commission was to be two per cent of this amount.340 Mr Bouzari was approached by the 

second son of the President of Iran, who offered his father’s help in guaranteeing the 

contract and demanded $50 million in return.341 Mr Bouzari alleged that, following his 

refusal to accept the assistance offered, he was kidnapped, imprisoned and repeatedly 

tortured in Tehran.342

118  

Mr Bouzari fled to Canada, where he brought suit against Iran for the damages 

suffered. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice declared it had no jurisdiction to entertain 

the claim. The ruling was confirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, whose 

judgment was delivered by Justice Goudge.343 

Mr Bouzari alleged that, since torture was prohibited by a jus cogens norm, there 

was universal civil jurisdiction for him to bring his claim before the court.344 Justice 

Goudge asserted there was nothing in the SIA 1985 or in any treaty binding on Canada 

which would require the application of universal jurisdiction.345 He also found there was 

nothing in customary international law requiring states to exercise civil jurisdiction for 

claims arising from torture suffered abroad.346 In any case, Justice Goudge considered it 

was not necessary to find whether the court had jurisdiction by applying the ordinary test 

of real and substantial connection, because the issue of state immunity precluded the 

question.347  

Justice Goudge expressed a very orthodox view on state immunity. He considered 

it to be ‘founded on the concepts of the sovereign equality of states and the non-

interference of states in the internal affairs of each other’ and ‘rooted on customary 

international law’.348 He also considered immunity was once absolute but the ‘dictates of 

justice’ had led to its attenuation.349   

In Canada, state immunity is governed by a statute, the SIA 1985, which 

establishes immunity as a general rule subject to the exceptions enshrined in the Act itself.  

Mr Bouzari relied on three exceptions provided for in the SIA.  

Firstly, Section 18 of the Act provides that it ‘… does not apply to criminal 

proceedings or proceedings in the nature of criminal proceedings.’350 Mr Bouzari alleged 

that this exception to state immunity applied because he was seeking punitive damages, 

which have the nature of a fine. Justice Goudge rejected this argument and asserted that 

punitive damages, whilst having the objective of deterring conduct, are a civil remedy. 351  

Secondly, Mr Bouzari invoked the exception for torts committed in the forum state, 

enshrined in the SIA. Indeed, Section 6 of the Act provides that ‘[a] foreign state is not

immune from the jurisdiction of a court in any proceedings that relate to (a) any death or 

personal or bodily injury, or (b) any damage to or loss of property that occurs in 

Canada.’352 Mr Bouzari alleged that his suffering continued in Canada. Justice Goudge 

considered that the continued suffering of Mr Bouzari was due to the injuries inflicted in 

Iran, not in Canada, and rejected the argument.353 

Thirdly, Mr Bouzari relied on the exception relating to commercial activity, found 

in Section 5 of the SIA, according to which ‘[a] foreign state is not immune from the 

jurisdiction of a court in any proceedings that relate to any commercial activity of the 

foreign state.’354 The act defines commercial activity as ‘any particular transaction, act or 

conduct or any regular course of conduct that by reason of its nature is of a commercial 

character.’355 Mr Bouzari claimed the acts of torture he suffered were committed with the 

purpose of affecting his involvement in a commercial activity. Justice Goudge did not 

accept this contention and asserted that the acts of torture were not commercial in nature, 

and that it was not enough that the claim related to ‘… acts which, in turn, relate to 

commercial activity of the foreign state.’356 

Justice Goudge also held the SIA was a comprehensive code, and thus the 

argument that, under common law, torture could not be considered a government act and 

could not attract immunity was dismissed.357  

Justice Goudge then turned to the question of whether Canada was bound by 

international law to allow for a civil remedy in the case. He considered that, as far as 

possible, domestic legislation should be interpreted consistently with international law (be 

it customary or conventional law).358 At the same time, he found that domestic law prevails 

when it conflicts with international law.359 As a consequence, he concluded that  

 
‘[e]ven if Canada’s international law obligations required that Canada permit a civil remedy 

for torture abroad by a foreign state, Canada has legislated in a way that does not do so. 

Section 3 of the SIA accords complete state immunity except as provided by the SIA. And, as 

we have seen, none of the relevant exceptions in the SIA permits a civil claim against a foreign

state for torture committed abroad. Canada has clearly legislated so as not to create this 

exception to state immunity whether it has an international law obligation to do so or not.’360  

 

Notwithstanding this conclusion, Justice Goudge undertook an examination of 

Canada’s international law obligations. Firstly, he analyzed whether Canada, which is a 

party to the CAT, was under the obligation to provide a civil remedy for acts of torture 

committed outside the forum state. Article 14 of the CAT establishes that  

 
‘1. Each State Party shall ensure in its legal system that the victim of an act of torture obtains 

redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation including the means for 

as full rehabilitation as possible. In the event of the death of the victim as a result of an act of 

torture, his dependants shall be entitled to compensation.  

‘2. Nothing in this article shall affect any right of the victim or other person to compensation 

which may exist under national law.’361  

 

In Justice Goudge’s view, a textual analysis of the CAT shows that ‘the absence of 

explicit territorial language does not necessarily mean the absence of territorial 

limitation’.362 He also mentioned the evidence of state practice regarding Article 14 limited 

the obligation enshrined in the provision for acts of torture committed in the state of the 

forum.363  

Mr Bouzari had also argued that the obligation to provide a civil remedy for him 

was established in Article 14 of the ICCPR, which reads as following: 

 
‘Article 14  

‘1. All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals. In the determination of any 

criminal charge against him, or of his rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be 

entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal 

established by law.’364

121  

  Justice Goudge found there was no evidence that Article 14 of the ICCPR was 

interpreted to require a state to provide a remedy for sovereign acts committed outside its 

jurisdiction.365 

As regards customary international law, Justice Goudge considered the jus cogens 

character of the prohibition of torture was not questioned.366 Based on a comparative 

review of domestic and international practice, it was concluded that, under customary 

international law, there was no exception to state immunity in respect of acts in breach of 

jus cogens committed outside the forum state.367 Nevertheless, even if this was the case, 

Justice Goudge asserted that the SIA is a comprehensive and does not provide for such an 

exception to state immunity: 

 
‘… the SIA simply does not include a civil action for damages for torture in any of the 

specifically drawn exceptions to the encompassing state immunity provided in s. 3(1). 

Moreover, the extent of the prohibition against torture as a rule of jus cogens is determined not 

by any particular view of what is required if it is to be meaningful, but rather by the 

widespread and consistent practice of states.’368 

 

The reference to Ex parte Pinochet (No 3) was deemed not to be relevant for the 

case. As put by Justice Goudge: 

 
‘… the opinions in Pinochet clearly reflect the distinction for state immunity purposes between 

proceedings seeking a criminal sanction against an individual for acts of torture committed 

abroad and proceedings seeking a civil remedy against a foreign state for the same acts. In the 

former case, the sanction can be imposed on the individual without subjecting one state to the 

jurisdiction of another. That is not so in the latter case.’369 

 

Finally, Justice Goudge dismissed the argument that, since the prohibition of 

torture implies the right to be free from it, there must be a remedy for it.370 He offered a 

two-fold response. Firstly, he considered that a civil remedy was not the only way to give 

effect for the prohibition of torture and that the CAT provided for the prosecution of

individuals who committed acts of torture committed abroad.371 Secondly, Justice Goudge 

asserted that state practice did not indicate that states were under the obligation to provide 

for a civil remedy for acts of torture committed outside the forum state and that the jus 

cogens character of the prohibition against torture did not have as a consequence an 

obligation for states to provide a civil remedy for its violation.372 

He concluded that  

 
‘… [b]oth under customary international law and international treaty there is today a balance 

struck between the condemnation of torture as an international crime against humanity and the 

principle that states must treat each other as equals not to be subjected to each other’s 

jurisdiction. It would be inconsistent with this balance to provide a civil remedy against a 

foreign state for torture committed abroad. In the future, perhaps as the international human 

rights movement gathers greater force, this balance may change, either through the domestic 

legislation of states or by international treaty. However, this is not a change to be effected by a 

domestic court adding an exception to the SIA that is not there, or seeing a widespread state 

practice that does not exist today.’373  

 

Mr Bouzari’s appeal was dismissed by the Court.

3.2.1 Judgment of the ECtHR in Al-Adsani v United Kingdom (2001) 

 

Having his appeal dismissed by the House of Lords, Mr Al-Adsani brought suit 

against the United Kingdom before the ECtHR. Mr Al-Adsani alleged the violation of 

Article 3 (prohibition of torture)374 read in conjunction with Articles 13 (right to an

degrading treatment or punishment.’

effective remedy)375 and 1 (obligation to respect Human Rights)376, and of Article 6.1 

(right to a fair trial)377 of the ECHR.  

The ECtHR found there had been no violation of Article 3, since the events alleged 

by Mr Al-Adsani did not take place in the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom 

authorities did not have a causal connection with them. Accordingly, the ECtHR held that 

‘… it [could not] be said that the High Contracting Party was under a duty to provide a 

civil remedy to the applicant in respect of torture allegedly carried out by the Kuwaiti 

authorities.’378 

With respect to Article 6.1, the ECtHR dismissed the United Kingdom’s first 

submission, namely that Mr Aldsani’s claim had no basis in domestic law because 

whatever substantive right he might have been entitled to had been extinguished by the 

operation of state immunity.379 According to the ECtHR, ‘[t]he grant of immunity is to be 

seen not as qualifying a substantive right but as a procedural bar on the national courts’ 

power to determine the right.’380 Having established Article 6.1 was applicable, the ECtHR 

turned to the question of compliance. The ECtHR began by sketching its doctrine with 

respect to the right of access to court, ie, that it is not an absolute right, and that it can be 

limited ‘by implication’ provided that there is a relationship of proportionality between the

extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity 
would prejudice the interests of justice. …’

means employed and the aim sought to be achieved, and that the limitations applied do not 

impair the very essence of the right and pursue a legitimate aim.381 It then outlined its view 

on state immunity:  

 
‘… sovereign immunity is a concept of international law, developed out of the principle par in 

parem non habet imperium, by virtue of which one State shall not be subject to the jurisdiction 

of another State …  [T]he grant of sovereign immunity to a State in civil proceedings pursues 

the legitimate aim of complying with international law to promote comity and good relations 

between States through the respect of another State’s sovereignty.’382 

 

Applying Article 31.3.c of the VCLT, according to which the treaty interpreter 

shall take into account, together with the context, ‘[a]ny relevant rules of international law 

applicable in the relations between the parties’383, the ECtHR understood that  

 
‘… measures taken by a High Contracting Party which reflect generally recognised rules of 

public international law on State immunity cannot in principle be regarded as imposing a 

disproportionate restriction on the right of access to a court as embodied in Article 6 § 1.’384  

 

The ECtHR moved next to the submission that the norm violated (the prohibition of 

torture), having the nature of jus cogens, took precedence over state immunity. The ECtHR 

noted that, in a Report produced in 1999, the ILC pointed out two developments that could 

support the argument a state could not invoke immunity in respect of gross violations of 

human rights.385 The first development was the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty 

Act of 1996, which amended the FSIA to add a new exception to the grant of immunity in 

cases in which ‘… money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or 

death that was caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage 

taking, or the provision of material support or resources for such an act…’, provided that 

the foreign state in question is designated as a ‘sponsor of terrorism’ by the United States 

and that the claimant or victim was a national of the United States when the acts

occurred.386 The second was the Ex parte Pinochet (No 3) case, in which the House of 

Lords held that immunity ratione materiae did not extend to former Heads of State who 

committed acts of torture. 387  The ECtHR remained unconvinced that, from these 

developments, it could be concluded there was acceptance in international law that states 

could not invoke immunity in civil claims for damages arising from jus cogens 

violations.388 As the ECtHR remarked, ‘the very fact that the amendment [to the FSIA] was 

needed would seem to confirm that the general rule of international law remained that 

immunity attached even in respect of claims of acts of official torture.’389 Also, the Ex 

parte Pinochet (No 3) case dealt with the immunity ratione materiae of a former Head of 

State from criminal jurisdiction, whilst the case under discussion dealt with the immunity 

ratione personae of a state from civil jurisdiction.390 The ECtHR concluded the grant of 

immunity to Kuwait by the English courts did not violate Article 6.1 of the ECHR. 

In a concurring opinion, Judge Pellonpää, joined by Judge Bratza, added two 

arguments to support the ECtHR’s judgment. The first one is a variation of the ‘flood-gate’ 

argument, ie accepting jus cogens norms override sovereign immunity would have as a 

consequence a steep increase in undesired litigation:  

 
‘The somewhat paradoxical result, had the minority’s view prevailed, could have been that 

precisely those States which so far have been most liberal in accepting refugees and asylum-

seekers, would have had imposed upon them the additional burden of guaranteeing access to a 

court for the determination of perhaps hundreds of refugees’ civil claims for compensation for 

alleged torture. Even if the finding of a violation of Article 6 in this case had not had a 

“chilling effect” on the readiness of the Contracting States to accept refugees—a consequence

‘The Court, while noting the growing recognition of the overriding importance of the 
prohibition of torture, does not accordingly find it established that there is yet acceptance in 
international law of the proposition that States are not entitled to immunity in respect of civil 
claims for damages for alleged torture committed outside the forum State. The 1978 [State 
Immunity] Act, which grants immunity to States in respect of personal injury claims unless the 
damage was caused within the United Kingdom, is not inconsistent with those limitations 
generally accepted by the community of nations as part of the doctrine of State immunity.’

126  

which I would not totally exclude—the question of the effectiveness of the access in the 

circumstances … would inevitably have arisen.’ 391 

 

The second argument concerned the extension of the jus cogens exception to the 

domain of immunity from execution. If jus cogens norms prevailed over the rule which 

requires one state to accord jurisdictional immunity to another, there would be no reason 

for them not to prevail over the rule which requires one state to accord immunity from 

execution to another, and negative consequences would ensue:  

 
‘If immunity from jurisdiction were to be regarded as incompatible with Article 6 because of 

the jus cogens nature of the prohibition of torture, which prevails over all other international 

obligations not having that same hierarchical status, it presumably would also have to prevail 

over rules concerning immunity from execution. Consequently, the Contracting States would 

have had to allow attachment and execution against public property of respondent States if the 

effectiveness of access to a court could not otherwise be guaranteed.  

‘… [I]n order not to contradict itself the Court would have been forced to hold that the 

prohibition of torture must also prevail over immunity of a foreign State’s public property, 

such as bank accounts intended for public purposes, real estate used for a foreign State’s 

cultural institutes and other establishments abroad (including even, it would appear, embassy 

buildings), etc., since it has not been suggested that immunity of such public property from 

execution belongs to the corps of jus cogens. Although giving absolute priority to the 

prohibition of torture may at first sight seem very “progressive”, a more careful consideration 

tends to confirm that such a step would also run the risk of proving a sort of “Pyrrhic victory”. 

International cooperation, including cooperation with a view to eradicating the vice of torture, 

presupposes the continuing existence of certain elements of a basic framework for the conduct 

of international relations. Principles concerning State immunity belong to that regulatory 

framework, and I believe it is more conducive to orderly international cooperation to leave this 

framework intact than to follow another course.’392 

 

3.2.1.1 The dissenting opinions appended to the judgment of the ECtHR in Al-Adsani 

v United Kingdom (2001)  

 

Eight out of the seventeen judges of the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR dissented of 

the judgment of the majority. In a much quoted dissenting opinion, Judges Rozakis and

127  

Caflisch, joined by Judges Wildhaber, Costa, Cabral Barreto and Vaji?, asserted that ‘the 

basic characteristic of a jus cogens rule is that, as a source of law in the now vertical 

international legal system, it overrides any other rule which does not have the same 

status.’ 393  Considering that it was demonstrated that the prohibition of torture had 

‘crystallised as a jus cogens rule’ and that the rules on state immunity ‘have never been 

considered by the international community as rules with a hierarchically higher status’394, 

the dissenting judges concluded that the veil of state immunity should be pierced if it 

conflicted with jus cogens. As explained by the judges: 

 
‘[t]he acceptance … of the jus cogens nature of the prohibition of torture entails that a State 

allegedly violating it cannot invoke hierarchically lower rules (in this case, those on State 

immunity) to avoid the consequences of the illegality of its actions. In the circumstances of this 

case, Kuwait cannot validly hide behind the rules on State immunity to avoid proceedings for a 

serious claim of torture made before a foreign jurisdiction; and the courts of that jurisdiction 

(the United Kingdom) cannot accept a plea of immunity, or invoke it ex officio, to refuse an 

applicant adjudication of a torture case. Due to the interplay of the jus cogens rule on 

prohibition of torture and the rules on State immunity, the procedural bar of State immunity is 

automatically lifted, because those rules, as they conflict with a hierarchically higher rule, do 

not produce any legal effect. In the same vein, national law which is designed to give domestic 

effect to the international rules on State immunity cannot be invoked as creating a 

jurisdictional bar, but must be interpreted in accordance with and in the light of the imperative 

precepts of jus cogens. 

‘… [T]he distinction made by the majority between civil and criminal proceedings, concerning 

the effect of the rule of the prohibition of torture, is not consonant with the very essence of the 

operation of the jus cogens rules. It is not the nature of the proceedings which determines the 

effects that a jus cogens rule has upon another rule of international law, but the character of the 

rule as a peremptory norm and its interaction with a hierarchically lower rule. The prohibition 

of torture, being a rule of jus cogens, acts in the international sphere and deprives the rule of 

sovereign immunity of all its legal effects in that sphere.’395  

 

At the beginning of his dissenting opinion, Judge Ferrari Bravo exclaimed: ‘What a 

pity!’ Judge Ferrari Bravo lamented the ‘golden opportunity’ missed and the endorsement 

by the ECtHR of ‘old formalist arguments’ in the conclusion that it was not yet accepted in

international law the proposition that states are not entitled to immunity in respect of civil 

claims arising out of acts of torture that were not committed in the territory of the forum 

state.396 Judge Loucaides, in his dissenting opinion, stated that, to him, any blanket 

immunity is a disproportionate violation of Article 6.1 of the ECHR. According to him, in 

order to apply immunity, it is always necessary to balance the competing interests, ie those 

related to the grant of immunity and those related to the nature of the substantive claim.397  

 

3.2.2 Judgment of the ECtHR in Kalogeropoulou and Others v Greece and Germany 

(2002)  

 

The Kalogeropoulou case has a direct link with the Multi-Member Court of 

Levadia’s Judgment No 137/1997, which was confirmed and made final by the Greek 

Court of Cassation in Judgment No 11/2000. In Jugment No 137/1997, the Multi-Member 

Court of Levadia ordered Germany to pay compensation for the relatives of the victims of 

the massacre perpetrated by Germany in Distomo during the Second World War. The 

enforcement proceedings related to Judgment No 137/1997 were, however, unsuccessful. 

Article 923 of the Greek Code of Civil Procedure establishes as a precondition to the 

enforcement of decisions against foreign states the authorization of the Minister of Justice, 

which was not obtained by the applicants.398 Although the Athens Court of First Instance 

held that Article 923 was incompatible with Article 6.1 of the ECHR and Article 2.3 of the 

ICCPR, the Athens Court of Appeal upheld Germany’s objection and set aside the 

judgment of the Court of First Instance, asserting that Article 923 pursued the public 

interest aim of avoiding disturbances in international relations and was proportionate to 

that aim.399 The Greek Court of Cassation ultimately upheld the position of the Athens 

Court of Appeal, considering that the limitation imposed by Article 923 of the Greek Code 

of Civil Procedure was compatible with Article 6.1 of the ECHR.400 

The applicants resorted to the ECtHR, claiming Greece and Germany, by refusing 

to comply with Judgment No 137/1997 of the Multi-Member Court of Levadia, had

infringed Article 6.1 of the ECHR (effective judicial protection) and Article 1 of Protocol 

No 1 to the ECHR (peaceful enjoyment of possessions).401 

The ECtHR strictly followed the approach it had set out in respect of Article 6.1 in 

its prior case-law and, when dealing with the relationship between Article 6.1 and state 

immunity, adhered to its decision in Al-Adsani. The ECtHR began by considering the right 

of access to court is not absolute and may be subject to limitations. It then asserted that 

Contracting States have a margin of appreciation, but the ECtHR has the final word 

concerning the compatibility of the limitations adopted by Contracting States with the 

ECHR. And then the ECtHR laid out the criteria the limitations applied have to fulfill: (i) 

they cannot impair the very essence of the right; (ii) they have to pursue a legitimate aim; 

and (iii) there must a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means 

employed and the aim sought to be realized. In line with the Al-Adsani judgment, the 

ECtHR considered that ‘the grant of sovereign immunity to a State in civil proceedings 

pursues the legitimate aim of complying with international law to promote comity and 

good relations between States.’402  

It also stated that, under Article 31.3.c of the VCLT, the ECHR must be interpreted 

in harmony with other rules of international law. Accordingly, the ECtHR found that  

 
‘… measures taken by a High Contracting Party which reflect generally recognised rules of 

public international law on State immunity cannot generally be regarded as imposing a 

disproportionate restriction on the right of access to a court as embodied in Article 6 § 1.’403  
 

Like in Al-Adsani, the ECtHR remarked that it was not established that there was 

acceptance for the proposition that states are not entitled to immunity in civil proceedings 

for damages arising from crimes against humanity committed outside the forum state.404 At 

the same time, and repeating what it had stated in Al-Adsani, the ECtHR left open the 

possibility that there could be such a development in customary international law in the 

future.405 In the light of these considerations, the conclusion of the ECtHR with respect to 

the claim Greece had violated Article 6.1 of the ECHR was predictable:

‘… the Minister of Justice’s refusal to give the applicants leave to apply for expropriation of 

certain German property situated in Greece cannot be regarded as an unjustified interference 

with their right of access to a tribunal, particularly as it was examined by the domestic courts 

and confirmed by a judgment of the Greek Court of Cassation.’406 

 

The ECtHR then moved to the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No 1 of the 

ECHR. The ECtHR remarked it was not disputed the ‘enforceable claim’ obtained by the 

applicants was a ‘possession’ within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No 1 and that 

there had been an interference with their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their 

possessions.407 It then examined whether the requirements for a justified interference under 

the ECHR had been satisfied. The ECtHR considered that ‘the first and most important 

requirement’ provided for by Article 1 of Protocol No 1 is that a deprivation of possessions 

must be lawful: it is only authorized ‘… subject to the conditions provided for by 

law…’.408 The ECtHR did not dwell too much on this requirement, considering it had been 

met since the interference in question was based on Article 923 of the Greek Code of Civil 

Procedure. Article 1 of Protocol No 1 also establishes that a deprivation of possessions 

must be ‘in the public interest.’ It concluded that there could be no doubt that this 

requirement had been fulfilled, ‘since it was intended to avoid disturbances in relations 

between Greece and Germany.’409 Lastly, the ECtHR considered that the structure of 

Protocol No 1 required ‘a fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the 

community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental 

rights.’410 The ECtHR stressed once again that

‘… the Greek Government could not be required to override the principle of State immunity 

against their will and compromise their good international relations in order to allow the 

applicants to enforce a judicial decision delivered at the end of civil proceedings.’411  

 

As supporting arguments to contend that a balance between the general interest and 

the protection of the applicants’ right to the peaceful enjoyment of property had been 

struck, the ECtHR emphasized that the situation could not have given rise to a legitimate 

expectation, since the applicants were aware that the authorization of the Minister of 

Justice had not been obtained, and that the applicants might be able to enforce the relevant 

judgment in the future or in another country.412 

The ECtHR also declared Germany’s responsibility under the ECHR had not been 

engaged. Article 1 of the ECHR prescribes that ‘[t]he High Contracting Parties shall secure 

to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this 

Convention.’413 The ECtHR understood that the participation of Germany in proceedings 

against it in the courts of another state was not sufficient to bring the applicants ‘within 

[its] jurisdiction’ for the purposes of Article 1 of the ECHR––Germany’s position in the 

proceedings was akin to that of a private individual.414

particular, those concerning: a) the interpretation of a treaty; b) any question of international

international obligation; and d) the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach 
of an international obligation.’

When it seized the Court, Germany advanced the following submissions, which 

remained unchanged throughout the proceedings:  

 
‘Germany prays the Court to adjudge and declare that the Italian Republic: 

‘(1) by allowing civil claims based on violations of international humanitarian law by the 

German Reich during World War II from September 1943 to May 1945, to be brought against 

the Federal Republic of Germany, committed violations of obligations under international law 

in that it has failed to respect the jurisdictional immunity which the Federal Republic of 

Germany enjoys under international law;  

‘(2) by taking measures of constraint against ‘Villa Vigoni’, German State property used for 

government non-commercial purposes, also committed violations of Germany’s jurisdictional 

immunity; 

‘(3) by declaring Greek judgments based on occurrences similar to those defined above in 

request No. 1 enforceable in Italy, committed a further breach of Germany’s jurisdictional 

immunity. 

‘Accordingly, the Federal Republic of Germany prays the Court to adjudge and declare that 

‘(4) the Italian Republic’s international responsibility is engaged; 

‘(5) the Italian Republic must, by means of its own choosing, take any and all steps to ensure 

that all the decisions of its courts and other judicial authorities infringing Germany’s sovereign 

immunity become unenforceable; 

‘(6) the Italian Republic must take any and all steps to ensure that in the future Italian courts do 

not entertain legal actions against Germany founded on the occurrences described in request 

No. 1 above.’416 

 

Italy, on its part, requested the ICJ to ‘… adjudge and hold the claims of the 

Applicant to be unfounded’ but it added that it had ‘… no objection to any decision by the 

Court obliging Italy to ensure that the mortgage on Villa Vigoni inscribed at the land 

registry is cancelled.’417 

 

3.3.2 Merits of the case 

 

Having established the scope of its jurisdiction, the ICJ first addressed Germany’s 

submission that Italy had acted in breach of Germany’s jurisdictional immunity by

exercising jurisdiction over civil claims based on the violations of the international law of 

armed conflict committed by Germany in Italian territory between 1943 and 1945. 

The ICJ recalled that there could be no doubt the acts perpetrated by Germany 

which provided the basis for the civil claims brought to the Italian courts were in violation 

of the international law of armed conflict applicable at the time, but it emphasized the 

question it had to settle was whether Italy had the obligation to accord immunity to 

Germany in those proceedings.418  

The Court then turned to the question of sources of law and the applicable law to 

settle the dispute. Its first finding was that the parties were in agreement that ‘… immunity 

is governed by international law and is not a mere matter of comity.’419 When considering 

the treaty law on the subject, the ICJ found out that the ECSI was not applicable because, 

although Germany was one of the Parties to the treaty, Italy was not. Neither state had 

ratified the UNCJISP, which nonetheless was not yet in force internationally.420 The 

conclusion was that the Court had to determine the scope and extent of the customary 

international law of state immunity.421  

In a rather formal fashion, the Court, invoking the North Sea Continental Shelf 

cases422, stated that it had to identify with respect to state immunity the existence of a 

‘settled practice’ coupled with opinio juris. Whilst it is not always clear how to isolate one 

element from the other, since, in order to demonstrate the existence of opinio juris, 

                                                
418 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 416) [52]-[53]. The ICJ identified three categories of cases: the 
first related to the ‘large-scale killing of civilians in occupied territory as part of a policy of reprisals’; the 
second category involved the deportation of civilians from Italy to perform slave labor in Germany; the third, 
the denial of the status of prisoners of war (and the protections entailed by this status) to members of the 
Italian armed forces, who were also submitted to forced labor.

Germany/Netherland) (Merits: Judgment) [1969] ICJ Rep 3, [77]:  
 

‘The essential point in this connection … is that even if these instances of action by non-parties 
to the Convention were much more numerous than they in fact are, they would not, even in the 
aggregate, suffice in themselves to constitute the opinio juris;—for, in order to achieve this 
result, two conditions must be fulfilled. Not only must the acts concerned amount to a settled 
practice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a 
belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it. The 
need for such a belief, i.e., the existence of a subjective element, is implicit in the very notion 
of the opinio juris sive necessitatis. The States concerned must therefore feel that they are 
conforming to what amounts to a legal obligation. The frequency, or even habitua1 character of 
the acts is not in itself enough. There are many international acts, e.g., in the field of 
ceremonial and protocol, which are performed almost invariably, but which are motivated only 
by considerations of courtesy, convenience or tradition, and not by any sense of legal duty.’ 
 



134  

reference is made to practice, and opinio juris is employed to identify the relevant 

practice423, the ICJ established a divide between the two: 

 
‘In the present context, State practice of particular significance is to be found in the judgments 

of national courts faced with the question whether a foreign State is immune, the legislation of 

those States which have enacted statutes dealing with immunity, the claims to immunity 

advanced by States before foreign courts and the statements made by States, first in the course 

of the extensive study of the subject by the International Law Commission and then in the 

context of the adoption of the United Nations Convention. Opinio juris in this context is 

reflected in particular in the assertion by States claiming immunity that international law 

accords them a right to such immunity from the jurisdiction of other States; in the 

acknowledgment, by States granting immunity, that international law imposes upon them an 

obligation to do so; and, conversely, in the assertion by States in other cases of a right to 

exercise jurisdiction over foreign States. While it may be true that States sometimes decide to 

accord an immunity more extensive than that required by international law, for present 

purposes, the point is that the grant of immunity in such a case is not accompanied by the 

requisite opinio juris and therefore sheds no light upon the issue currently under consideration 

by the Court.’424  

 

After having established the dispute would have to be settled on the basis of 

customary international law, the ICJ expressed its view on the importance and on the 

foundations of the law of state immunity. The ICJ considered that ‘… the rule of State 

immunity occupies an important place in international law and international relations’425 

and conveyed the traditional view that state immunity  ‘… derives from the principle of 

sovereign equality of state, which, as Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United 

Nations makes clear, is one of the fundamental principles of the international legal 

order.’426 The Court then briefly considered that, whilst exceptions to state immunity 

‘represent a departure from the principle of sovereign equality’, immunity itself ‘may 

represent a departure from the principle of territorial sovereignty and the jurisdiction which 

flows from it.’427

135  

The Court then addressed a question of intertemporal law on which the Parties 

disagreed, namely whether the law to be applied was that in force in 1943-1945, at the time 

the events which gave rise to the proceedings in Italian courts happened, or that which 

applied at the time the proceedings before Italian courts occurred.428 The ICJ found its 

response in Article 13 of the DARSIWA 2001, according to which ‘[a]n act of a State does 

not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the 

obligation in question at the time the act occurs.’429 Considering the issue in question was 

the denial of immunity by Italian courts, the Court found that it had to apply the 

international law in force at the times the proceedings in question happened.430 

Lastly, before addressing Italy’s arguments substantiating the contention that it had 

not failed to respect Germany’s jurisdictional immunity, the ICJ made some remarks 

regarding the nature of the acts committed by Germany which were the subject of 

proceedings before Italian courts. According to the Court, those were acta jure imperii. 

The ICJ dismissed the understanding according to which acts amounting to international 

crimes and grave breaches of international humanitarian law could not have the nature of 

sovereign acts. As it explained:  

 
‘The Court considers that the terms “jure imperii” and “jure gestionis” do not imply that the 

acts in question are lawful but refer rather to whether the acts in question fall to be assessed by 

reference to the law governing the exercise of sovereign power (jus imperii) or the law 

concerning non-sovereign activities of a State, especially private and commercial activities (jus 

gestionis). To the extent that this distinction is significant for determining whether or not a 

State is entitled to immunity from the jurisdiction of another State’s courts in respect of a 

particular act, it has to be applied before that jurisdiction can be exercised, whereas the legality 

or illegality of the act is something which can be determined only in the exercise of that 

jurisdiction. Although the present case is unusual in that the illegality of the acts at issue has 

been admitted by Germany at all stages of the proceedings, the Court considers that this fact 

does not alter the characterization of those acts as acta jure imperii.’431 

 

Having stated its position on these questions, the ICJ turned to Italy’s first 

argument, based on the territorial tort principle. The Italian contention was that, under

136  

customary international law, a foreign State does not have the right to immunity for torts 

committed in the forum state, even for acta jure imperii. The arguments brought by Italy 

regarding this point were not different from the ones used by Italian courts. Italy pointed 

out that Article 11 of the ECSI and Article 12 of the UNCJISP enshrined the tort 

exception, and so did numerous domestic codifications of the law of state immunity.432 

Italy also added that Article 31 of the ECSI, which reinstates the rule of state immunity for 

acts performed by armed forces on the territory of another Contracting State, had to be 

interpreted as referring to the tolerated presence of armed forces under regular 

circumstances, particularly in the context of Status of Force Agreements.433  

The ICJ remarked that it did not have to rule whether, under customary 

international law, the tort exception was applicable to acta jure imperii. It decided to take a 

more restrictive approach and understood that it only had to verify whether the tort 

exception applied to ‘… acts committed on the territory of the forum State by the armed 

forces of a foreign State, and other organs of State working in co-operation with those 

armed forces, in the course of conducting an armed conflict.’434 In consonance with what it 

had indicated, the ICJ followed a very formalistic path to find the answer to this question.  

Firstly, it analyzed the treaty law on the matter, but only insofar as it shed light on 

customary international law. Unlike Italy had argued, the ICJ found that Article 31 of the 

ECSI did not refer solely to the regular, consented presence force of armed forces in the 

territory of the forum state, but applied ‘… irrespective of whether those forces are present 

in the territory of the forum with the consent of the forum State and whether their acts take 

place in peacetime or in conditions of armed conflict.’435 Although the UNCJISP does not 

have a clause excluding the acts of armed forces from it scope, the ICJ referred to the 

ILC’s Commentaries to the Draft Articles that resulted in the adoption of the UNCJISP, 

according to which Article 12 is not meant to apply to ‘situations involving armed 

conflicts’, noting that this interpretation remained unchallenged by other states and that 

two states which ratified the Convention (Sweden and Norway) declared the same 

understanding.436

137  

Subsequently, the ICJ analyzed the domestic codifications of the law of state 

immunity, and found that out of ten states (United States, United Kingdom, South Africa, 

Canada, Australia, Singapore, Argentina, Israel, Japan, Pakistan), nine had codified the tort 

exception (Pakistan being the exception). Out of these nine, only the United Kingdom’s 

State Immunity Act 1978 and Singapore’s State Immunity Act 1985 excluded proceedings 

related to the activities of armed forces from their scope. In any case, however, as found by 

the ICJ, the courts of the other states, whose codifications did not provide for such a 

general exclusion, had never been called to adjudge a case involving the acts of armed 

forces in a situation of conflict.437  

Finally, the ICJ examined the judgments of national courts. It gave special attention 

to cases which had later developments in international courts. The ICJ remarked that in 

McElhinney v UK, Grosz v France and Kalogeropoulou and others v Greece and 

Germany, the ECtHR took the position that the grant of immunity to a foreign state in 

respect of acta jure imperii committed by its armed forces in the territory of the forum 

state did not violate the ECHR. Surveying the judgments of domestic courts, the ICJ found 

that only judgments of Italian courts and the judgments of the Greek courts in the Distomo 

case supported the tort exception argument put forth by Italy.438 The ICJ also remarked that 

the Greek Special Supreme Court in Margellos v Germany held that Germany was entitled 

to immunity, thus having taken a different position than the Greek Supreme Court in the 

Distomo case, and that, under Greek law, Greek courts have to follow the position of the 

Special Supreme Court, unless they find customary international law on the subject has 

changed.439 

The ICJ took with respect to the tort exception argument what the Italian Court of 

Cassation labeled as a quantitative approach. The ICJ limited itself to take note of treaty 

law and domestic statutes. When it assessed the judicial decisions on the subject, it merely 

took note of the outcomes, not dwelling upon the consistency of the arguments employed. 

The ICJ ultimately found that  

 
‘… customary international law continues to require that a State be accorded immunity in 

proceedings for torts allegedly committed on the territory of another State by its armed forces 

and other organs of State in the course of conducting an armed conflict.’440

438 ibid [76]. 
439 ibid. 
440 ibid [78]. 



138  

 

Next, the ICJ analyzed Italy’s three-stranded argument according to which the 

denial of immunity was justified due to the subject-matter and the circumstances of the 

claim brought before its courts. According to Italy, the gravity of the acts committed by 

Germany (amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity), the violation of jus 

cogens norms, and the lack of other forms of redress entitled the Italian courts not to grant 

immunity to Germany.  

The ICJ, although emphasizing Germany committed serious violations of 

international law, ruled that the gravity of these violations did not operate to deprive 

Germany of its entitlement to immunity. The ICJ reasoned that there would be a logical 

inconsistency otherwise, since immunity is an issue which precedes the merits and the 

determination of the gravity of the acts committed presupposes an examination of the 

merits. In the words of the Court,  

 
‘… the proposition that the availability of immunity will be to some extent dependent upon the 

gravity of the unlawful act presents a logical problem. Immunity from jurisdiction is an 

immunity not merely from being subjected to an adverse judgment but from being subjected to 

the trial process. It is, therefore, necessarily preliminary in nature. Consequently, a national 

court is required to determine whether or not a foreign State is entitled to immunity as a matter 

of international law before it can hear the merits of the case brought before it and before the 

facts have been established. If immunity were to be dependent upon the State actually having 

committed a serious violation of international human rights law or the law of armed conflict, 

then it would become necessary for the national court to hold an enquiry into the merits in 

order to determine whether it had jurisdiction. If, on the other hand, the mere allegation that the 

State had committed such wrongful acts were to be sufficient to deprive the State of its 

entitlement to immunity, immunity could, in effect be negated simply by skillful construction 

of the claim.’441 

 

Nevertheless, the ICJ conceded that, although it may be illogical, customary 

international law might have evolved to require or to allow the denial of immunity in cases 

in which a state is responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law and 

international human rights law.442 The ICJ once again adopted a quantitative approach to 

the issue. It concluded that only the judgments of Italian courts and the judgments of the 

Greek courts in the Distomo case (which were later repudiated by the Greek Special 
                                                
441 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 416) [82]. 
442 ibid [83]. 



139  

Supreme Court in Margellos v Germany) could substantiate this claim.443 By reviewing 

many domestic judgments, the ICJ found out there was a widespread tendency to reject the 

position of the Italian courts, which, in its view, demonstrated that ‘… customary 

international law does not treat a State’s entitlement to immunity as dependent upon the 

gravity of the act of which it is accused or the peremptory nature of the rule which it is 

alleged to have violated.’444 The ICJ also rejected Italy’s argument that the law of state 

immunity was undergoing a process of change, which could result in a new exception to 

state immunity based on the gravity of the violations. The ICJ added that the judgment of 

the House of Lords in Ex Parte Pinochet (No 3) was not relevant, because it dealt with the 

different issue of the immunity of a former Head of State from criminal jurisdiction.445 

Furthermore, the ICJ observed that neither domestic legislations nor treaty law (the ECSI 

and UNCJISP) limited immunity on the grounds of the gravity of the acts committed or the 

peremptory character of the rule violated.446 Finally, the Court referred again to the 

judgments of the ECtHR in Al-Adsani v United Kingdom and Kalogeropoulou and others v 

Greece and Germany, which pointed out that, under international law, it was not 

established there was an exception to state immunity in respect of civil claims brought 

against foreign states for grave breaches of international humanitarian law and human 

rights law.447 The ICJ therefore concluded that  

 

                                                
443 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 416) [83].

‘That practice is particularly evident in the judgments of national courts. Arguments to the 
effect that international law no longer required State immunity in cases of allegations of 
serious violations of international human rights law, war crimes or crimes against humanity 
have been rejected by the courts in Canada (Bouzari v. Islamic Republic of Iran, Court of 
Appeal of Ontario, [2004] Dominion Law Reports (DLR), 4th Series, Vol. 243, p. 406; ILR,

140  

‘… under customary international law as it presently stands, a State is not deprived of 

immunity by reason of the fact that it is accused of serious violations of international human 

rights law or the international law of armed conflict. In reaching that conclusion, the Court 

must emphasize that it is addressing only the immunity of the State itself from the jurisdiction 

of the courts of other States; the question of whether, and if so to what extent, immunity might 

apply in criminal proceedings against an official of the State is not in issue in the present 

case.’448 

 

Subsequently, the Court addressed the second strand of the argument, namely that 

there is a conflict between state immunity and jus cogens, and that this conflict should be 

solved in favor of the higher-ranking jus cogens norms. According to the ICJ, there is no 

such conflict: jus cogens norms have a substantive character, whilst the rules of state 

immunity are procedural in nature. In the ICJ’s view, there could not be a relationship of 

subordination between jus cogens norms and the rules of state immunity. The ICJ 

expressed itself in the following way:  

 
‘… no such conflict [between rules of jus cogens and the rule of customary international law 

which requires one state to accord immunity to another] exists. Assuming for this purpose that 

the rules of the law of armed conflict which prohibit the murder of civilians in occupied 

territory, the deportation of civilian inhabitants to slave labour and the deportation of prisoners 

of war to slave labour are rules of jus cogens, there is no conflict between those rules and the 

rules on State immunity. The two sets of rules address different matters. The rules of State 

immunity are procedural in character and are confined to determining whether or not the courts 

of one State may exercise jurisdiction in respect of another State. They do not bear upon the 

question whether or not the conduct in respect of which the proceedings are brought was 

lawful or unlawful. That is why the application of the contemporary law of State immunity to 

proceedings concerning events which occurred in 1943-1945 does not infringe the principle 

that law should not be applied retrospectively to determine matters of legality and 

responsibility … For the same reason, recognizing the immunity of a foreign State in 

accordance with customary international law does not amount to recognizing as lawful a 

situation created by the breach of a jus cogens rule, or rendering aid and assistance in 

maintaining that situation, and so cannot contravene the principle in Article 41 of the 

International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility.’449  

 

The ICJ took a position that many would consider to render jus cogens norms 

otiose. Relying on its pronouncements in Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo, 
                                                
448 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 416) [91]. 
449 ibid [93]. 



141  

according to which the violation of a jus cogens norm does not confer to the Court a 

jurisdiction it would not otherwise have450, and in Arrest Warrant, in which the Court held 

that an incumbent Foreign Minister enjoyed immunity from criminal jurisdiction even 

when suspected of having violated rules that possess the character of jus cogens451, the ICJ 

asserted there was ‘no basis’ for the proposition according to which  

 
‘… no rule which is not of the status of jus cogens may be applied if to do so would hinder the 

enforcement of a jus cogens rule, even in the absence of a direct conflict … A jus cogens rule 

is one from which no derogation is permitted but the rules which determine the scope and 

extent of jurisdiction and when that jurisdiction may be exercised do not derogate from those 

substantive rules which possess jus cogens status, nor is there anything inherent in the concept 

of jus cogens which would require their modification or would displace their application.’452 

 

Lastly, in order to dismiss this argument, the ICJ once again assessed domestic 

judicial practice, concluding that national tribunals had overall rejected that jus cogens had 

the effect of overriding state immunity.453

‘… The Court observes, however, as it has already had occasion to emphasize, that “the erga 
omnes character of a norm and the rule of consent to jurisdiction are two different things” (East 
Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 102, para. 29), and that the 
mere fact that rights and obligations erga omnes may be at issue in a dispute would not give 
the Court jurisdiction to entertain that dispute.  
‘The same applies to the relationship between peremptory norms of general international law 
(jus cogens) and the establishment of the Court’s jurisdiction: the fact that a dispute relates to 
compliance with a norm having such a character, which is assuredly the case with regard to the 
prohibition of genocide, cannot of itself provide a basis for the jurisdiction of the Court to 
entertain that dispute. Under the Court’s Statute that jurisdiction is always based on the consent 
of the parties.’

Appeal of Ontario, DLR, 4th Series, Vol. 243, p. 406; ILR, Vol. 128, p. 586), Poland 



142  

Subsequently, the ICJ considered Italy’s argument that the denial of immunity 

could be justified on the grounds that other attempts to secure compensation for the victims 

had failed. This argument concerned particularly the group of victims referred as Italian 

Military Internees. Those victims were members of the Italian armed forces who were 

deported to Germany to perform forced labor. Although at the time they were entitled to 

the status of prisoners of war, they were denied it by the German Reich. When Germany 

set up a scheme of compensation to the individuals who were subject to forced labor and 

other violations, by means of a Federal Law passed on 2 August 2000, it excluded from the 

right to compensation those who had the status of prisoner of war, based on the 

consideration that, under international law, prisoners of war could be put to work under 

certain conditions. Therefore, although those victims had the right to the protection owed 

to prisoners of war, they were denied this status by the Germany Reich. Still, when 

Germany set up a system of compensation, it considered that the Italian Military Internees 

had never lost the status of prisoner of war and did not have the right to compensation 

under the 2000 Federal Law.  

The ICJ limited itself to say that it was a matter of ‘regret’ and ‘surprise’ that  

 
‘… Germany decided to deny compensation to a group of victims on the ground that they had 

been entitled to a status which, at the relevant time, Germany had refused to recognize, 

particularly since those victims had thereby been denied the legal protection to which that 

status entitled them.’454  

 

Nevertheless, after highlighting once again one of the recurring themes of its 

judgment––namely that state immunity, international responsibility and the duty to make 

reparation are different questions––the ICJ held that it could

Rights in Al-Adsani v. United Kingdom and Kalogeropoulou and others v. Greece and

judgment of the French Cour de cassation of 9 March 2011 in La Réunion aérienne v. Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriya (No. 09-14743, 9 March 2011, Bull. civ., March 2011, No. 49, p. 49) as 
supporting a different conclusion.’

143  

‘… find no basis in the State practice from which customary international law is derived that 

international law makes the entitlement of a State to immunity dependent upon the existence of 

effective alternative means of securing redress.’455 

 

The ICJ also dismissed Italy’s contention that the three strands of the argument (the 

gravity of the violations, the jus cogens status of the norms breached and the lack of other 

means of redress) had a ‘combined effect’. Since it was not persuaded by each of the three 

strands, the Court asserted that, even if considered together, they would not have the effect 

purported by Italy.456 The Court also took the opportunity to assert immunity was a right of 

the state and therefore it could not be displaced by means of a balancing exercise—an 

exercise which, as it may be remembered, was performed by the Italian Court of Cassation: 

 
‘… [A]ccording to international law, State immunity, where it exists, is a right of the foreign 

State. In addition … national courts have to determine questions of immunity at the outset of 

the proceedings, before consideration of the merits. Immunity cannot, therefore, be made 

dependent upon the outcome of a balancing exercise of the specific circumstances of each case 

to be conducted by the national court before which immunity is claimed.’457 

 

The two other submissions put forth by Germany were dealt with by the ICJ rather 

succinctly.  

After the decision of the Multi-Member Court of Levadia in the Distomo case was 

declared enforceable in Italy, the Greek claimants registered a legal charge (‘ipoteca 

giudiziale’) against the German property of Villa Vigoni, located in Italian territory. 

Germany argued that Italy, by taking this measure of constraint, had violated Germany’s 

right to immunity from enforcement. The ICJ found that, being ‘… clear in the present 

case that the property which was the subject of the measure of constraint at issue is being 

used for governmental purposes that are entirely non-commercial, and hence for purposes 

falling within Germany’s sovereign functions’458, Italy had indeed breached the obligation 

to respect the immunity from enforcement owed to Germany.  

The decisions of the Italian courts conferring exequatur to the decisions of the 

Greek courts in the Distomo case were also found to be in violation of Germany’s right to 

immunity. Whilst the purpose of exequatur proceedings is not to decide the merits of a

case, the ICJ considered that the court seized of such an application ‘… has to ask itself 

whether, in the event that it had itself been seized of the merits of a dispute identical to that 

which was the subject of the foreign judgment, it would have been obliged under 

international law to accord immunity to the respondent State.’459 Given that Italy would 

have to grant immunity if it had been seized of a case identical to the one the Greek courts 

adjudged, the ICJ concluded that Italy had violated Germany’s jurisdictional immunity by 

granting exequatur to the aforementioned decisions of the Greek courts.  

 

3.3.3 The dissenting opinion of Judge Cançado Trindade 

 

Whilst Judge Yusuf460 and Judge ad hoc Giorgio Gaja461 dissented from the finding 

that Italy had violated Germany’s jurisdictional immunity by allowing civil claims based 

on the violations of international humanitarian law committed by Germany between 1943 

and 1945, Judge Cançado Trindade was the only judge to dissent of the ICJ’s judgment as 

a whole, asserting he was in disagreement with ‘the adopted methodology, the approach 

                                                
459 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (n 416) [130]. 
460 See Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Dissenting Opinion of 
Judge Yusuf) [2012] ICJ Rep 99. Judge Yusuf’s dissent focused on the processes of change and development 
of international law. He highlighted that, there being a ‘grey zone’ in the law, a court may clarify and fix its 
content, thus acting as an agent of development of international law (§47). Yusuf criticized the ICJ’s 
approach to the ascertainment of customary international law by asking why the Court attached more weight 
to some decisions to the detriment of the decisions rendered by the Italian and Greek Courts and whether 
customary international law was a ‘question of relative numbers’ (§24). After all, as put by him, ‘[s]tate 
immunity is … as full of holes as Swiss cheese’ (§26), and these holes were mostly produced by the action of 
domestic courts, at first isolated. In his words (§48- §51):  
 

‘… in the area of State immunity it is not to be excluded that such domestic courts may be 
performing a law-development function, even when their decisions are not yet shared by other 
jurisdictions or are considered, at first sight, not to conform to what may have hitherto been 
viewed as State practice. The Court itself appears to recognize the potential of domestic courts 
for further development of the law of immunity through its references to certain judicial 
decisions which were the first to formulate some of the derogations and exceptions to State 
immunity. 
‘… The assertion of jurisdiction by domestic courts for a failure to make reparations for 
serious breaches of the law of armed conflict admitted by the responsible State, particularly 
where no other means of redress is available, could not, in my view, harm the independence or 
the sovereignty of another State. It simply contributes to the crystallization of an emerging 
exception to State immunity, which is based on the principles underlying human rights and 
humanitarian law and on the widely-held opinio juris of ensuring the realization of those 
rights, including the right to an effective remedy, in those circumstances where the victims 
would have no other means of redress.’  

 
461 See Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Dissenting Opinion of 
Judge ad hoc Gaja) [2012] ICJ Rep 99. Judge ad hoc Gaja focused on the tort exception and concluded that 
‘at least for certain decisions of Italian courts, the exercise of jurisdiction could not be regarded as being in 
breach of an obligation under general international law’ (§12). 



145  

pursued, the whole reasoning in its treatment of issues of substance, as well as the 

conclusions of the Judgment.’462  

Paraphrasing Voltaire, Andrea Bianchi said that ‘[i]f Cançado did not exist, it 

would be necessary to invent him.’463 The lengthy dissenting opinion Judge Cançado 

Trindade annexed to the judgment of the ICJ is a testament to the flexibility of 

international law and to the plurality of views international legal argumentation can 

accommodate. Indeed, the contrast between his dissenting opinion and the judgment of the 

ICJ could hardly be more pronounced.  

Right at the outset, Cançado Trindade laid down the tone of his dissenting opinion, 

stating he was guided ‘… by the ultimate goal precisely of the realization of justice.’464 

Cançado Trindade emphasized more than once the importance of the factual background to 

the legal issues and also the recognition by Germany of its responsibility for the serious 

violations of international humanitarian law it had committed.465 It is clear Cançado 

Trindade wanted to defy the notion law can be considered in a vacuum and that law can be 

appraised by making abstraction of the facts underlying the case. Before further advancing 

in his argumentation, Cançado Trindade devoted a section of his dissenting opinion to 

expose its doctrinal foundations and remarked that, in his view, valuable lessons from the 

past are forgotten and the legal profession has a ‘persistent obsession of privileging 

strategies of litigation over consideration of fundamental human values.’466  

Cançado Trindade briefly analyzed the works of three jurists (Albert de La 

Pradelle, Max Huber, Alejandro Álvarez) and picked up the elements of the doctrines of 

these three authors which informed his dissenting opinion: the emphasis on fundamental 

human values, the critique of a state-centric approach to international law and the belief 

international law exists first and foremost to serve human beings.467 Cançado Trindade 

underlined his conception of international law was ‘… quite distinct from that of the 

Court’s majority’468 and, in his view, a ‘strict inter-State outlook’ could not suffice. In

146  

Cançado Trindade’s perspective, ‘the ultimate material source of all Law’ is the ‘universal 

juridical conscience’.469  

Cançado Trindade also highlighted the gravity of the violations of international 

humanitarian law and human rights law committed by Germany, which, according to him 

entailed ‘…ineluctable legal consequences for the removal of any bar to jurisdiction and 

for the question of reparations to the victims.’470  

Furthermore, in Cançado Trindade’s view, the victims had a direct right to 

reparation.471 This is why, according to Cançado Trindade, the waiver effectuated by Italy 

in the Peace Agreement of 1947 and the Bonn Agreement of 1961, which provide for an 

inter-state reparation scheme to the victims of the German Reich, could not affect the 

rights of victims of grave violations of international law––such a waiver, insofar as they 

involve rights that belong to individuals, and not to the state itself, according to the Judge, 

would breach jus cogens and be against the international ordre public: 

 
‘Article 3 of the IV Hague Convention of 1907 and Article 91 of Additional Protocol I of 1977 

confer the right to reparation at international level to victims of those grave breaches. And the 

responsible States are bound to provide them such reparation. A vast practice to this effect has 

developed in recent years, in the domain of the corpus juris of the International Law of Human 

Rights, marking—being one of the multiple aspects of—the emancipation of the individuals 

from their own State, in the vindication of the rights inherent to them.’472 

 

Before considering the relationship between state immunity and jus cogens, 

Cançado Trindade assessed the status of forced labor in international law, concluding that, 

at the time of World War II, it was ‘a form of slave work … already prohibited by 

international law’ and that ‘the absolute prohibition of forced and slave work in the war 

industry’ had the status of jus cogens.473  

Cançado Trindade retorted Germany’s argument that the decision to set aside state 

immunity could jeopardize the structure of the international society quite eloquently:

‘In my understanding, what jeopardizes or destabilizes the international legal order are the 

international crimes, and not the individual suits for reparation in the search for justice. In my 

perception, what troubles the international legal order, are the cover-up of such international 

crimes accompanied by the impunity of the perpetrators, and not the victims in search for 

justice. When a State pursues a criminal policy of murdering segments of its own population, 

and of the population of other States, it cannot, later on, place itself behind the shield of 

sovereign immunities, as these latter were never conceived for that purpose. Grave breaches of 

human rights and of international humanitarian law, amounting to international crimes, are not 

at all acts jure imperii. They are anti-juridical acts, they are breaches of jus cogens, that cannot 

simply be removed or thrown into oblivion by reliance on State immunity. This would block 

the access to justice, and impose impunity. It is, in fact, the opposite that should take place: 

breaches of jus cogens bring about the removal of claims of State immunity, so that justice can 

be done.’474  

 

Cançado Trindade criticized the ICJ’s approach of relying on decisions of national 

tribunals. According to him, the ICJ should have had a broader outlook on the matter and 

have taken into account other sources of international law. With this consideration in mind, 

Cançado Trindade set out to address the tension between state immunity and the right of 

access to justice in the light of the concept of rule of law in the following terms:  

 
‘The concept of rule of law moves away from the shortsightedness of legal positivism (with its 

characteristic subservience to the established power), and comes closer to the idea of an 

‘objective’ justice, at national and international levels, in line with jusnaturalist legal thinking. 

Within the realm of this latter, it is attentive to the protection of human rights, anterior and 

superior to the State.’475 

 

The codification of the tort exception in the ECSI and in the UNCJISP was, 

according to Cançado Trindade, an acknowledgment that ‘… their subject-matter [did] not 

exhaust itself in purely inter-State relations.’476 Always criticizing what he labeled ‘the 

strict inter-State outlook’ and state consent as the foundation of international law, and 

advocating a return to the universalism of the founding fathers of international law, 

Cançado Trindade put forth the view that, in the present case, the distinction between acta 

jure imperii and acta jure gestionis was irrelevant:

Judge Cançado Trindade) (n 462) [129].

‘War crimes and crimes against humanity are not to be considered acta jure gestionis, or else 

“private acts”; they are crimes. They are not to be considered acta jure imperii either; they are 

grave delicta, crimes. The distinction between acts jure imperii and acts jure gestionis, 

between sovereign or official acts of a State and acts of a private nature, is a remnant of 

traditional doctrines which are wholly inadequate to the examination of the present case on the 

Jurisdictional Immunities of the State before the Court. Such traditional theories, in their 

myopia of State-centrism, forgot the lessons of the founding-fathers of the law of nations, 

pointing to the acknowledgement that individuals are subjects of the law of nations (droit des 

gens). 

‘There is no immunity for grave violations of human rights and of international humanitarian 

law, for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Immunity was never conceived for such 

iniquity. To insist on pursuing a strictly inter-State approach in the relationships of 

responsibility leads to manifest injustice. The present case of the Jurisdictional Immunities of 

the State (Germany versus Italy, Greece intervening) gives eloquent testimony of this.’477  

 

Being delicta imperii, ie international crimes in breach of jus cogens, the grant of 

immunity to Germany would be, according to Cançado Trindade, inadmissible.478  

Cançado Trindade then turned to the question of access to justice. Cançado 

Trindade considers that the right of access to justice has to be viewed in its essence of a 

fundamental right, and not, like the ECtHR does, from the standpoint of permissible 

limitations. As famously stated by the ECtHR in Golder v United Kingdom, ‘the right of 

access to the courts is not absolute … there is room, apart from the bounds delimiting the 

very content of any right, for limitations permitted by implication.’479 In Ashingdane v 

United Kingdom, the ECtHR enumerated the requirements that must be fulfilled for lawful 

limitations of this right: (i) the limitations applied must not restrict or reduce the right of 

access to court in a way that impairs ‘the very essence of the right’; (ii) they have to pursue 

a ‘legitimate aim’; and (iii) there must be a ‘reasonable relationship of proportionality 

between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved.’480 According to Cançado 

Trindade, the IACtHR has a more sensible approach to the right of access to justice

149  

(enshrined in Articles 8 and 25 of the ACHR). The judge recalled the case Goiburu et al v 

Paraguay, in which the IACtHR stated that  

 
‘El acceso a la justicia constituye una norma imperativa de Derecho Internacional y, como tal, 

genera obligaciones erga omnes para los Estados de adoptar las medidas que sean necesarias 

para no dejar en la impunidad esas violaciones, ya sea ejerciendo su jurisdicción para aplicar su 

derecho interno y el derecho internacional para juzgar y, en su caso, sancionar a los 

responsables, o colaborando con otros Estados que lo hagan o procuren hacerlo.’481 

 

Accordingly, in this respect, Cançado Trindade concluded the following: 

 
‘[The right of access to justice] assumes an imperative character in face of a crime of State: it 

is a true droit au Droit, a right to a legal order which effectively protects the fundamental 

rights of the human person… We are here, in sum, in the domain of jus cogens.’482  

 

Cançado Trindade lamented the fact that the text of the UNCJISP remained silent 

in respect of the incidence of jus cogens and did not address the problem of the 

relationship between state immunity and serious breaches of international humanitarian 

law and human rights law.483 Indeed, the Working Group of the Sixth Committee of the 

UNGA, in a document pertaining to the travaux préparatoires of the UNCJISP, declared 

that ‘… the question of the existence or non-existence of immunity in the case of violation 

by a State of jus cogens norms of international law … did not seem to be ripe enough for 

the Working Group to engage in a codification exercise over it.’484 Cançado Trindade 

remarked that both the ECtHR in Al-Adsani and, after over a decade apart, the ICJ in 

Jurisdictional Immunities of the State used this ‘omission’ in the reasoning of their 

decisions. In his view, these judgments had the effect of ‘freezing’ international law.485 

It was not left unobserved by Cançado Trindade one of the most acute 

contradictions of the regime of state immunity:

485 Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Dissenting Opinion of 
Judge Cançado Trindade) (n 462) [226]. In his words: ‘I cannot at all accept that contemporary international 
law can thereby be “frozen”.’ 



150  

 
‘… to admit the removal of State immunity in the realm of trade relations, or in respect of local 

personal tort (e.g., in traffic accidents), and at the same time to insist on shielding States with 

immunity, in cases of international crimes marked by grave violations of human rights and of 

international humanitarian law in pursuance of State (criminal) policies, in my perception 

amounts to a juridical absurdity.’486 

 

In another step of his dissenting opinion, Cançado Trindade sought to demonstrate 

the existence under international law of an individual right to reparation for the victims of 

grave violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law: 

 
‘An interpretation of the regime of reparations as belonging purely to the inter-State level 

would furthermore equate to a complete misconception of the position of the individual in the 

international legal order.  

‘… [T]he regime of reparations for grave breaches of human rights and of international 

humanitarian law cannot possibly exhaust itself at the inter-State level, wherein the individual 

is left at the end without any reparation at all.’487  

 

This right to reparation, according to him, leads ultimately to the impossibility of 

invoking state immunity in order to be exempt from the duty to provide reparation for the 

victims.488  

Lastly, Cançado Trindade devoted a section of his dissenting opinion to assess the 

impact of jus cogens in the case. Again he expressed his concern that the ICJ was 

contributing to keep international law ‘frozen’ and ‘stagnated’.489 The judge criticized the 

positivist methodology employed by the ICJ, which relied on ‘an empirical factual exercise 

of identifying the incongruous case-law of national courts and the inconsistent practice of 

national legislations on the subject-matter at issue’490. According to Cançado Trindade, 

these are 

 
‘… positivist exercises leading to the fossilization of international law, and disclosing its 

persistent underdevelopment, rather than its progressive development, as one would expect. 

Such undue methodology is coupled with inadequate and unpersuasive conceptualizations, of

the kind of the ones so widespread in the legal profession, such as, inter alia, the 

counterpositions of “primary” to “secondary” rules, or of “procedural” to “substantive” rules, 

or of obligations of “conduct” to those of “result”.’491  

 

As discussed previously, one of the pivotal points of the ICJ’s decision in 

Jurisdictional Immunities of the State was the contention that there was no conflict 

between jus cogens norms (considered ‘substantive’ in nature) and the norms of state 

immunity (characterized by the Court as ‘procedural’). Cançado Trindade strongly 

criticized this approach: 

 
‘To me, the separation between procedural and substantive law is not ontologically nor 

deontologically viable: la forme conforme le fond. Legal procedure is not an end in itself, it is a 

means to the realization of justice. And the application of substantive law is finaliste, it 

purports to have justice done.  

‘… There is thus a material conflict, even though a formalist one may not be discernible. The 

fact remains that a conflict does exist, and the Court’s reasoning leads to what I perceive as a 

groundless deconstruction of jus cogens, depriving this latter of its effects and legal 

consequences.’492 

 

At one point, in paragraph 294 of his dissenting opinion, Cançado Trindade asked: 

‘Words, words, words … Where are the values?’493 This question indeed encapsulates 

Cançado Trindade’s perspective of international law, which privileges fundamental human 

values and the realization of justice.

3.4 Decisions rendered by national courts after Jurisdictional Immunities of the State  

 

3.4.1 Italy 

 

3.4.1.1 Judgment of the Italian Court of Cassation in the Albers case (2012) 

 

After the ICJ’s judgment of 3 February 2012 in Jurisdictional Immunities of the 

State, the Court of Cassation had once again the opportunity to dwell on the issue of state 

immunity in cases of a breach of peremptory norms of international law.  

The first judgment concerning the Albers case was handed down on 26 June 2009 

by the Tribunale Militare di Roma, which condemned to life imprisonment nine German 

citizens (Albers Paul, Baumann Joseph, Bichler Hubert, Kusterer Wilhelm Ernst, Rosler 

Arnold, Schneider Adolf, Schneider Max, Trager Heinz-Fritz, Wulf Helmut) who had 

belonged to the XVI SS Panzergrenadier Division.494 They had taken part in a massacre 

that occurred in Italy involving the death of about 350 Italian citizens not engaged in 

military operations, among women, children and the elderly.495 Based on the Court of 

Cassation’s previous judgments496, the Corte Militare di Appello partially upheld the first-

instance judgment. One of the accused, Rosler Arnold, was acquitted, and four others 

(Albers Paul, Bichler Hubert, Schneider Adolf, Trager Heinz-Fritz) had died before the 

judgment and therefore had their criminal liability extinguished.497 The Court also upheld 

the civil claims except with respect to Rosler Arnold, Albers Paul, Bichler Hubert, 

Schneider Adolf, and Trager Heinz-Fritz.498 The Corte Militare di Appello had also held 

Germany civilly liable and, as a result, on 23 June 2011, Germany appealed to the Court of 

Cassation protesting Italy’s exercise of jurisdiction.499  

Germany argued the principle of access to justice for the victims of gross violations 

of human rights did not prevail over the rule of state immunity from civil jurisdiction and 

that, in any case, the right to obtain civil compensation for damages arising from these

breaches was not part of the body of jus cogens.500 Germany pointed out that, in its view, 

the decisions rendered by the Italian courts contrasted with international practice and that 

the arguments employed in the different decisions were not consistent among themselves,  

 
‘… ora facendosi riferimento all’emersione di una regola non ancora sorretta dalla prassi 

internazionale, ora richiamando una tendenza evolutiva nella dottrina internazionalistica e in 

una parte ancora minoritaria della giurisprudenza interna ovvero una consuetudine 

internazionale in via di formazione, ora utilizzando il criterio del bilanciamento di interessi, ora 

facendo leva sul metodo qualitativo di rilevazione della consuetudine internazionale e 

privilegiando, con argomenti che si assumono in ordine sistematico e logico, la prassi 

qualitativamente superiore seppure minoritaria.’501 

 

 The Court of Cassation strongly criticized the ICJ’s judgment in Jurisdictional 

Immunities of the State. As previously mentioned, the ICJ held that there was no conflict 

between the customary norm which requires one state to accord immunity to another and 

jus cogens norms. To the Court of Cassation, it seemed 

 
‘… indebitamente riduttivo confinare la categoria dello jus cogens alla sua sola portata 

sostanziale, ignorando che la sua effettività concreta si mistura proprio alla stregua delle 

conseguenze giuridiche che derivano dalla violazione delle norme imperative. E––d’altro 

canto––non appare marginale considerare che proprio la predicata distinzione tra norme           

« sostanziali » e « procedurali » cagiona null’altro che l’impunità dei soggetti e finisce per 

riaffermare la poca persuasiva attrazione, nella sfera della esenzione dalla giurisdizione, 

propria degli atti adottati jure imperii, di atti quali i crimini contro l’umanità che in quella 

categoria stentano ad essere ricompresi.’502 

 

 Nevertheless, the Court of Cassation conceded it had to take into account the ICJ’s 

judgment due to its ‘indiscutibile autorevolezza’ and its ‘non assenti tratti di 

persuasività’. 503  As a matter of fact, the Court of Cassation went beyond that and 

considered the pronouncement of the ICJ should be examined ‘come dictum del Giudice 

internazionale ben prima che come fonte di una soluzione giuridica dotata di elevata

plausibilità’.504 In the Court of Cassation’s view, the judgment of the ICJ was owed 

deference due to being a dictum of the international judge and because it expressed the lack 

of support of the international community with regard to the position adopted by the Italian 

courts. The Court of Cassation remained, however, convinced of the soundness of its 

previous decisions and hopeful that its position would be adopted in the future:  

 
‘E pertanto, se è ben vero che non è dato desumere dalla statuizione della Corte internazionale 

argomenti in grado di sconfessare la persuasività e solidità giuridica dei principi fino ad ora 

affermati da questa Corte, tale statuizione, nel rammentato quadro di sostanziale isolamento 

della posizione del Giudice italiano, consiglia certamente di valutare le statuizioni del 2004 e 

del 2008—espressamente intese come fonti di un contributo “all’emersione di una regola 

conformativa dell’immunità dello Stato estero”—come un tentativo, dettato da esigenze di 

affermazione di principi di civiltà giuridica, che, in difetto della sua “convalida” da parte della 

Comunità internazionale della quale la Corte dell’Aja è il massimo momento di sintesi 

giurisdizionale, non è stato, o non è stato ancora, fornito della necessaria condivisione, e che, 

per questa ineluttabile considerazione, non può essere portato ad ulteriori applicazioni.  

‘Le espressioni di pieno consenso alle posizioni della Corte italiana da parte di autorevole parte 

della dottrina e lo stesso sintomatico emergere di opinioni dissenzienti nella pronunzia della 

Corte internazionale non fanno escludere che in avvenire il principio del necessario ritrarsi 

della immunità per gli Stati che agiscano jure imperii quando l’azione incida sui diritti 

individuali di rilievo primario per i cittadini possa essere in tutto o in parte acquisito dalla 

Comunità internazionale. Ma allo stato ciò non è.’505 

 

 The Court of Cassation pointed out the ICJ held Italy had incurred international 

responsibility and had to restore the situation which existed before the wrongful acts were 

committed.506 The Court of Cassation highlighted it was left to Italy to choose the means to 

implement its obligations, given the ‘… totale autonomia della funzione giurisdizionale … 

da vincoli diretti ed immediati scaturenti dal dictum della Corte Internazionale’.507 The 

Court of Cassation chose, however, to comply with the ICJ’s ruling and to annul the 

decision of the Corte Militare di Appello. The Court added the recognition of Germany’s 

entitlement to immunity from suits based on violations of fundamental rights would not

raise a question of constitutionality.508 It recalled Article 10.1 of the Italian Constitution 

provided for the automatic conformity of the Italian legal system with international law. 

Hence customary international law assumed the role of a primary source of law and the 

corresponding norms were subordinated only to the Italian Constitution, being ‘norme 

interposte’. Rather cryptically, the Court of Cassation added that, since it was inaccurate in 

the ascertainment of custom in previous cases, the custom it had once conceived did not 

produce ‘norme interposte’ and that would render a question of constitutionality 

immaterial.509 

 

3.4.1.2 Judgment No 238 of the Italian Court of Cassation (2014)  

 

 This time, the Court of Cassation was seized with a request by the Tribunal of 

Florence to decide on the constitutionality of various norms of Italian law related to the 

implementation of the ICJ’s ruling in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State and to the 

internalization of the UNCJISP 2004. Said referral had its origin in three different cases in 

which the subject-matter was again whether the Italian legal system required Italian courts 

to grant immunity to a foreign state in respect of proceedings seeking damages in cases 

involving the perpetration by Germany of war crimes and crimes against humanity in 

Italian territory.510

509 ibid: ‘… il diniego della attuale sussistenza di una consuetudine internazionale quale quella divisata a suo 
tempo dalle Sezioni Unite di questa Corte comporta necessariamente l’inesistenza delle “norme interposte” e 
fa venir meno, di necessità, alcuna rilevanza al dubbio stesso di illegittimità costituzionale.’ See also 
Fontanelli (n 504) 638 (footnotes omitted): 
 

‘In Albers, the Court of Cassation opined that, since the custom envisaged in Ferrini does not 
in fact exist, no issue of constitutionality can arise … This passage is elliptical, as it fails to 
specify which statutory act was suspected of breaching the alleged custom. Perhaps it refers to 
a conflict between the statutes enjoining Italian courts to decline jurisdiction and the Ferrini 
principle, elevated to a constitutional standard under Article 10 of the Constitution. Perhaps the 
Court was referring to another—more radical— conflict adumbrated by the plaintiffs, between 
immunity and constitutional counterlimits. If international jus cogens cannot trump sovereign 
immunity, one could try to invoke domestic peremptory safeguards to escape compliance with 
detestable international obligations, as in the Kadi case.’

 The context was different from the cases previously analyzed. As pointed out by 

the Tribunal of Florence, in the proceedings, Germany requested the Italian judge to give 

effect to the decision rendered by the ICJ and to declare lack of jurisdiction.511 Also, the 

Italian Court of Cassation itself had departed from the standard crafted in Ferrini v 

Germany (eg, in the Albers case, which was examined in the previous section of this 

monograph), and the Italian state had made efforts to conform to the ICJ’s ruling.512 

Article 3513 of Law No 5 of 14 January 2013 (‘Adesione della Repubblica italiana alla 

Convenzione delle Nazioni Unite sulle immunità giurisdizionali degli Stati e dei loro beni, 

fatta a New York il 2 dicembre 2004, nonchè norme di adeguamento all’ordinamento 

interno’) established Italian judges had to comply with the ruling of the ICJ. This Article 

also provided even final judgments already rendered by the Italian courts which contrasted 

with the decision of the ICJ could be revised (‘impugnate per revocazione’).  

 The Tribunal of Florence pointed out it was undisputed that the facts underlying the 

claims had the nature of international crimes.514 At the same time, it conceded to the 

authoritativeness of the pronouncements of the ICJ and assumed that there was no conflict 

between jus cogens norms and state immunity, that the crimes perpetrated by the German 

Reich were jure imperii and that customary international law recognized state immunity 

was applicable in civil proceedings even for international crimes committed by the armed 

forces and other organs of a state in the territory of the forum state.515 The argument of the

Tribunal of Florence was that if, on one hand, the ICJ has an ‘absolute and exclusive’ 

competence over these matters, on the other, the Italian judge has competence to decide on 

whether the grant of immunity to a foreign state to the detriment of individual rights 

complied with the Italian Constitution and its integrative sources.516 What the Tribunal of 

Florence pointed out is that, even if international law required state immunity to be granted 

in the proceedings in question, that could be in violation of domestic law: it shifted the 

focus from international jus cogens to domestic jus cogens.517  

 In an initial step, the Court of Cassation dismissed the understanding laid out in 

Judgment No 48/1979 and followed in other judgments according to which only customary 

international law norms created after the entry into force of the Italian Constitution could 

be subjected to constitutional review and have their reception precluded in the Italian legal 

system.518 In the light of what was previously held by the Italian Court of Cassation in 

Judgment No 48/1979, one could conclude that, since the customary international norms 

being discussed pre-existed the entry into the force of the Italian Constitution, the Italian 

legal system would have automatically and fully received them. The Court of Cassation, 

relying on another decision (Judgment No 1/1956)519, expressed a different position and

asserted the understanding according to which norms created both before and after the 

Italian Constitution could be made subject to constitutional review also applied to the 

norms incorporated in the Italian legal system through Article 10.1 of the Italian 

Constitution.520  

 Interestingly, the Court of Cassation dismissed the rigid distinction made by the ICJ 

between procedural and substantive rules and did not accept the argument that the 

establishment of jurisdiction of the forum state on the basis of a claim for compensation for 

damages caused by breaches of peremptory norms of international law would amount to 

reversing the order of assessment of jurisdiction and merits.521 According to the Court of 

Cassation, ‘… un’eccezione relativa alla giurisdizione richiede necessariamente una 

valutazione del petitum in base alla prospettazione della domanda, come formulata dalle 

parti.’522 

 In the merits, the Court of Cassation followed the reasoning of the Tribunal of 

Florence and adhered to a dualistic view of the relationship between international law and 

the Italian legal system. The Court of Cassation considered domestic judges should adopt 

the ‘principle of conformity’ and follow the interpretation of international law as adopted 

at the international level.523 The ICJ having defined the scope of the norm of state 

immunity, the Court of Cassation was called to pronounce itself on the compatibility of the 
                                                                                                                                              
 

‘L’assunto che il nuovo istituto della “illegittimità costituzionale” si riferisca solo alle leggi 
posteriori alla Costituzione e non anche a quelle anteriori non può essere accolto, sia perché, 
dal lato testuale, tanto l’art. 134 della Costituzione quanto l’art. 1 della legge costituzionale 9 
febbraio 1948, n. 1, parlano di questioni di legittimità costituzionale delle leggi, senza fare 
alcuna distinzione, sia perché, dal lato logico, è innegabile che il rapporto tra leggi ordinarie e 
leggi costituzionali e il grado che ad esse rispettivamente spetta nella gerarchia delle fonti non 
mutano affatto, siano le leggi ordinarie anteriori, siano posteriori a quelle costituzionali’.

domestic norm created by virtue of Article 10.1 of the Italian Constitution and which 

mirrors the customary international norm in question with the norms and principles of the 

Italian Constitution, specifically Articles 2524 (protection of fundamental human rights) and 

24525 (right of access to justice).526  

The Court of Cassation then highlighted the role of national courts in the transition 

from the absolute doctrine to the restrictive doctrine of state immunity and the later 

recognition of this practice by international organs in the process of identifying customary 

international law. 527  The Court of Cassation argued that the respect to the Italian 

Constitution had the effect of further restricting the scope of state immunity and that, 

although this effect was limited to the Italian legal system, it could concur ‘ad 

un’auspicabile e da più parti auspicata evoluzione dello stesso diritto internazionale.’528 

Unlike the ICJ, which established a stark distinction between procedural and substantive 

rules, the Court of Cassation considered that Articles 2 and 24 of the Italian Constitution 

are ‘inestricabilmente connessi’, ie it considered there is an intimate connection between 

the protection of human rights and the right of access to court529. Recalling its case-law, 

the Court of Cassation asserted that limits to the right of access to justice had to be justified 

by a ‘a public interest’. 530  The Court of Cassation could not find in the Italian 

Constitutional order a public interest able to justify a norm which requires the ‘complete 

sacrifice’ of the right of access to court in cases in which damages are sought by victims of 

crimes against humanity and gross violation of human rights.531

 The Court of Cassation espoused the understanding that the immunity from 

jurisdiction ‘consented by Articles 2 and 24 of the Italian Constitution’ could only protect 

the sovereign function of foreign states, and ‘... non anche comportamenti che non 

attengono all’esercizio tipico della potestà di governo, ma sono espressamente ritenuti e 

qualificati illegittimi, in quanto lesivi di diritti inviolabili…’.532 In the view of the Court of 

Cassation, denying judicial protection to the victims of international crimes would amount 

to a disproportionate sacrifice of the rights enshrined in Articles 2 and 24 of the Italian 

Constitution: 

 
‘… la circostanza che per la tutela dei diritti fondamentali delle vittime dei crimini di cui si 

tratta, ormai risalenti, sia preclusa la verifica giurisdizionale rende del tutto sproporzionato il 

sacrificio di due principi supremi consegnati nella Costituzione rispetto all’obiettivo di non 

incidere sull’esercizio della potestà di governo dello Stato, allorquando quest’ultima si sia 

espressa, come nella specie, con comportamenti qualificabili e qualificati come crimini di 

guerra e contro l’umanità, lesivi di diritti inviolabili della persona, in quanto tali estranei 

all’esercizio legittimo della potestà di governo.’533  

 

If in Ferrini v Germany the Court of Cassation engaged directly in the 

interpretation of international law, in this judgment the Court deferred to the interpretation 

established by the ICJ. Such deferral, nonetheless, amounted to lip service. In a formal 

fashion, the Court of Cassation concluded that the international norm granting 

jurisdictional immunity to states in respect of egregious violations of human rights had 

never entered the Italian legal system in the first place. Since it is in conflict with Articles 

2 and 24 of the Italian Constitution, the operation of Article 10.1 of the Italian Constitution 

was precluded in this situation, and the international norm did not produce a domestic 

norm with the same content.534  

 Article 1 of Law No 848/1957, which gave ‘full and complete execution’ to the UN 

Charter and, in particular, to Article 94 of the UN Charter, which requires Member States 

‘… to comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice in any case to which it 

is a party’, was also deemed to be in breach of Articles 2 and 24 of the Italian Constitution, 

but only insofar as it required compliance with the judgment of the ICJ in Jurisdictional

Immunities of the State.535 The Court of Cassation highlighted its decision did not impact 

any other obligations imposed by the UN Charter on Italy, including the duty to comply 

with other decisions of the ICJ.536  

 Finally, on the same grounds, the Court of Cassation also declared unconstitutional 

Article 3 of Law No 5/2013, which had been adopted to enable compliance with the ruling 

of the ICJ.  

In order to justify its dualistic position, the Court of Cassation made reference to 

the Kadi I case.537 This case concerned the setting up, by the UNSC, of a sanctions regime 

targeting individuals suspected to be associated with international terrorism. This sanctions 

regime imposed, inter alia, the freezing of assets of listed individuals without regard to 

basic guarantees, such as the right to be heard and the right to effective judicial protection. 

Mr Kadi and Al Barakaat brought proceedings before the CFI seeking the annulment of 

certain EU Regulations implementing SC Resolutions linked to the sanctions regime in 

question. Ultimately, the ECJ adopted an essentially dualist approach, dismissing the 

possibility of reviewing a SC Resolution even if it were in breach of jus cogens.538 This 

would not, nevertheless, limit in any way its capacity to fully review measures emanating 

from the European legal system—quite the opposite: according to the ECJ, the system set 

out by the UN Charter does not prohibit any judicial review of the internal lawfulness of 

contested EU Regulations in the light of the fundamental freedoms of the European legal 

system, even if the Regulations in question are intended to give effect to a SC Resolution 

adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. As well said by Antonios Tzanakopoulos, 

the ECJ put states in an awkward situation, insofar as they have to choose either to obey 

the ruling of the ECJ or the SC.539 In a similar way, in Judgment No 238/2014, the Italian

Court of Cassation put the Italian State in the awkward position of having to incur 

international responsibility. 
 

3.5 Decisions rendered by international courts after Jurisdictional Immunities of the 

State  

 

3.5.1 Judgment of the ECtHR in Jones v United Kingdom (2014) 

 

In the light of having their appeals denied by the House of Lords in the Jones case, 

Mr Jones and Messrs Mitchell, Sampson and Walker brought their cases before the 

ECtHR, which decided to join both applications, given their factual and legal similarities. 

They complained of a violation of Article 6.1 of the ECHR.540 Mr Jones’s claim was that 

the grant of immunity to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and to the individual defendants 

was a disproportionate violation of the right of access to court, whilst Messrs Mitchell, 

Sampson and Walker claimed that the grant of immunity to the individual defendants in 

their case was a disproportionate violation of the same right. 

Although the United Kingdom argued Article 6.1 was not engaged and the case 

should not be admitted, the ECtHR followed the understanding it had adopted in Al-Adsani 

according to which ‘… the grant of immunity did not qualify the substantive right but 

acted as a procedural bar on the national courts’ power to determine the right’, thus finding 

Article 6.1 to be engaged.541 

The ECtHR started its assessment by laying out its understanding of Article 6.1 of 

the ECHR in a similar fashion to what it did in Al-Adsani. It found the right of access to 

court was not absolute and it could be subject to limitations. Contracting States have a 

margin of appreciation in respect of the limitations, but the ECtHR has the final word in 

                                                
540 European Convention on Human Rights (n 374): 
 

‘Article 6––Right to a fair trial––1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of 
any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a 
reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be 
pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in 
the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the 
interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the 
extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity 
would prejudice the interests of justice. …’

respect of the observance of the requirements such limitations must satisfy: (i) they must 

not ‘restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent 

that the very essence of the right is impaired’; (ii) they must pursue a legitimate aim; and 

(iii) there must be a ‘reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means 

employed and the aim sought to be achieved’542 The ECtHR did not depart from its 

decision in Al-Adsani. It found that  

 
‘… sovereign immunity is a concept of international law, developed out of the principle par in 

parem non habet imperium, by virtue of which one State shall not be subject to the jurisdiction 

of another State. The grant of sovereign immunity to a State in civil proceedings pursues the 

legitimate aim of complying with international law to promote comity and good relations 

between States through the respect of another State’s sovereignty. 

‘… [T]he need to interpret the Convention so far as possible in harmony with other rules of 

international law of which it forms part, including those relating to the grant of State immunity, 

has led to the Court to conclude that measures taken by a State which reflect generally 

recognised rules of public international law on State immunity cannot in principle be regarded 

as imposing a disproportionate restriction on the right of access to a court as embodied in 

Article 6 § 1.’543 

 

The ECtHR emphasized that it had held in Al-Adsani that there was not yet 

acceptance in international law for the proposition that states were not entitled to immunity 

in respect of civil claims arising out of alleged acts of torture that were not committed in 

the territory of the forum state—accordingly, in the case, the United Kingdom was found 

not to have violated Article 6.1 of the ECHR for having granted immunity to Kuwait. The 

same conclusion was reached later in Kalogeropoulou. Since the ECtHR had left open the 

possibility of further developments in customary international law, the next step it took 

was to consider whether the approach adopted in Al-Adsani should be revisited. The Court 

did not develop its reasoning, merely mentioning that the approach adopted in respect of 

the proportionality test under Article 6.1 in Al-Adsani involved its obligation ‘to take 

account of the relevant rules and principles of international law and to interpret the 

[ECHR] so far as possible in harmony with other rules of international law of which it 

forms part’—and, as asserted by the ECtHR in Al-Adsani, these rules include the

‘generally recognised rules of public international law on State immunity’.544 Without 

further considerations, the ECtHR limited itself to state that it was ‘satisfied that the 

approach to proportionality set out by the Grand Chamber in Al-Adsani … ought to be 

followed.’545 

The ECtHR highlighted the similarities between Mr Jones’s claim regarding the 

grant of state immunity to Saudi Arabia and the material facts underlying the Al-Adsani 

case. Accordingly, the ECtHR considered that, if in Al-Adsani, it had held that the grant of 

immunity pursed a legitimate aim (namely, ‘complying with international law to promote 

comity and good relations between States through the respect of another State’s 

sovereignty’) and was proportionate (because the ECHR has to be as far as possible 

interpreted in harmony with other rules of international law and the measures taken by a 

state which reflect generally recognized rules of public international law on state immunity 

could not be considered in principle as imposing a disproportionate restriction on Article 

6.1),546 it could only do otherwise in this case if at the time the House of Lords rendered its 

decision in 2006 there had already been  

 
‘… an evolution in the accepted international standards as regards the existence of a torture 

exception to the doctrine of State immunity … such as to warrant the conclusion that the grant 

of immunity in [the] case did not reflect generally recognised rules of public international law 

on State immunity.’547  

 

The ECtHR mentioned cases decided by domestic courts in which the issue was 

whether there was a jus cogens exception to state immunity in civil claims against the 

state, but decided not to proceed to a closer examination of the reasoning employed in 

these judgments. Instead, the ECtHR decided to defer to the position taken by the ICJ in 

Jurisdictional Immunities of the State, according to which a jus cogens exception to state 

immunity had not yet emerged:  

 
‘… the recent judgment of the International Court of Justice in Germany v. Italy … —which 

must be considered by this Court as authoritative as regards the content of customary 

international law—clearly establishes that, by February 2012, no jus cogens exception to State 

immunity had yet crystallised. The application by the English courts of the provisions of the

165  

1978 Act to uphold the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s claim to immunity in 2006 cannot 

therefore be said to have amounted to an unjustified restriction on the applicant’s access to a 

court. It follows that there has been no violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention as regards 

the striking out of Mr Jones’ complaint against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.’548 

 

Next, the ECtHR moved to the question of whether the grant of immunity ratione 

materiae to state officials was compatible with Article 6.1 of the ECHR. The ECtHR, like 

the House of Lords, deemed the immunity of state officials symmetrical to the immunity of 

the state itself.549 Therefore, it considered that the grant of immunity to state officials was 

prima facie legitimate and proportionate:  

 
‘… the immunity which is applied in a case against State officials remains “State” immunity: it 

is invoked by the State and can be waived by the State. Where, as in the present case, the grant 

of immunity ratione materiae to officials was intended to comply with international law on 

State immunity, then as in the case where immunity is granted to the State itself, the aim of the 

limitation on access to court is legitimate. 

‘Since measures which reflect generally recognised rules of public international law on State 

immunity cannot in principle be regarded as imposing a disproportionate restriction on the 

right of access to a court, the sole matter for consideration in respect of the applicants’ 

complaint is whether the grant of immunity ratione materiae to the State officials reflected 

such rules.’550 

 

Accordingly, in order to assess whether the limitation on Article 6.1 was 

proportionate, the ECtHR had to confirm the limitation in question reflected general rules 

of international law, ie it had to establish the existence of a rule requiring domestic courts 

to grant immunity to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s claim in respect of its officials and

November 2015:  
 

‘… [T]he decision in Jones to uphold the immunity of the State officials even in the face of 
allegations of torture … stretches the meaning of the ICJ Jurisdictional Immunities Judgment 
and goes against two emerging trends: (1) accountability of non-high ranking State officials for 
serious human rights violations; (2) the diversification of various forms of immunity.  
‘… 
‘Jones v UK puts the brakes on the independent evolution of the immunity of State officials by 
re-integrating or re-aligning that immunity with that of the State.’ 
 

550 Jones and others v United Kingdom (n 541) [200]-[201]. 



166  

also whether there was an exception to the general rule in respect of claims arising from 

alleged acts of torture.  

The ECtHR considered that it had accepted that the grant of immunity to the state 

itself reflected generally recognized rules of public international law. It added to its 

reasoning that acts cannot be practiced by the state itself, but only by individuals—in the 

words of the ECtHR, ‘an act cannot be carried out by a State itself but only by individuals 

acting on the State’s behalf’551. Therefore, in the ECtHR’s reasoning, whenever the state 

itself can invoke immunity, then, in principle, state officials must be able to invoke 

immunity ratione materiae. As the ECtHR put it, ‘[i]f it were otherwise, State immunity 

could always be circumvented by suing named officials.’552 In order to support what it 

called a ‘pragmatic understanding’, the ECtHR invoked an argument that was also 

employed in the judgment of the House of Lords, namely that the UNCJISP established in 

Article 2.1.b.iv that, for the purposes of the Convention, the word ‘state’ should be 

understood as comprising ‘representatives of the State acting in that capacity’.553  

The ECtHR also examined the practice of domestic (England, Canada, Australia, 

New Zealand, the United States) and international courts (the ICJ and the ICTY) on the 

matter. From its survey, the ECtHR concluded that  

 
‘… [t]he weight of authority at international and national level therefore appears to support the 

proposition that State immunity in principle offers individual employees or officers of a 

foreign State protection in respect of acts undertaken on behalf of the State under the same 

cloak as protects the State itself.’554  

 

The ECtHR was then left with the question of whether there was an exception to 

this rule in respect of acts of torture. As with the discussion about this issue which took 

place in the House of Lords, one of the crucial points was whether torture could be 

considered an ‘official act’ for the purpose of immunity ratione materiae. The ECtHR first 

considered the definition of torture enshrined in Article 1 of the CAT, according to which 

torture is an act ‘inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of

167  

a public official or other person acting in an official capacity’.555 Although Lord Justice 

Mance in the Court of Appeal argued this definition did not lend to acts of torture an 

official character and merely served to identify the author and the public context of the act, 

the ECtHR preferred the position adopted by the House of Lords: 

 
‘[The definition of torture in the CAT] appears to lend support to the argument that acts of 

torture can be committed in an “official capacity” for the purposes of State immunity. … 

[A]fter an extensive review of the sources of international law, [Lord Justice Mance’s 

reasoning in the Court of Appeal] was rejected by a unanimous House of Lords. Lord 

Bingham, in particular, pointed out that the only case-law relied upon by the applicants to 

support this argument, which came from the United States, did not express principles widely 

shared and observed among other nations …’556 

 

Subsequently, the ECtHR discussed the DARSIWA and the relationship between 

state responsibility and state immunity.557 Indeed, Articles 4 and 5 of the DARSIWA 

attribute to the state acts which were performed by state organs (as defined in Article 4) 

and persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority (Article 5).558 Article 

7 establishes that ‘[t]he conduct of an organ of a State or of a person or entity empowered 

to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State 

under international law if the organ, person or entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds 

its authority or contravenes instructions.’559 Article 58, on its turn, makes clear that ‘[t]hese 

articles are without prejudice to any question of the individual responsibility under 

international law of any person acting on behalf of a State.’560 Thus, although the ECtHR 

had stated that, in principle, state officials have immunity ratione materiae in respect of 

acts undertaken on behalf of the state, it conceded that  

 
‘… individuals may in certain circumstances also be personally liable for wrongful acts which 

engage the State’s responsibility, and that this personal liability exists alongside the State’s 

liability for the same acts … This potential dual liability … is clearly seen in the criminal

context, where individual criminal liability for acts of torture exists alongside State 

responsibility. … Thus, as the existence of individual criminal liability shows, even if the 

official nature of the acts is accepted for the purposes of State responsibility, this of itself is not 

conclusive as to whether, under international law, a claim for State immunity is always to be 

recognised in respect of the same acts.’561  

 

It seems that the ECtHR identified a difference between criminal and civil 

proceedings regarding the availability of immunity ratione materiae for state officials. As 

remarked by William Dodge,  

 
‘… the ECtHR looks to the possibility of individual responsibility under criminal law to satisfy 

Article 58 [of the DARSIWA] … Indeed, throughout its decision, the ECtHR repeatedly 

distinguishes the substantial authority against treating human rights violations as official acts 

on the ground that those cases involved criminal proceedings.’562  

 

The ECtHR considered that it was ‘far from settled’ whether Article 14 of the CAT 

had given rise to universal civil jurisdiction in respect of acts of torture.563 Although the 

Committee Against Torture in General Comment No 3 stated the view that Article 14 

‘requires all States Parties to ensure that all victims of torture and ill-treatment are able to 

access remedy and obtain redress’564, the ECtHR pointed out that the United States had 

made a declaration to the CAT in which it expressed the understanding that Article 14 

required a State Party to provide a civil remedy only in respect of acts of torture committed 

in a territory under the jurisdiction of that State Party.565 The ECtHR then added that the 

judicial practice in Canada (the Ontario Court of Appeal in Bouzari v Islamic Republic of 

Iran) and in the United Kingdom (the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords in the Jones 

                                                
561 Jones and others v United Kingdom (n 541) [207]. 
562 Dodge (n 551). Dodge criticized this perspective: 
 

‘I find it hard to maintain a civil/criminal distinction with respect to immunity under customary 
international law, given the diversity of forms in which jurisdiction is exercised around the 
globe, with many nations allowing private parties to initiate criminal proceedings (subject to 
varying degrees of government control) and to seek damages in such suits. But even if one 
looks only at state practice in civil cases, there is clearly no general and consistent practice of 
States treating human rights violations as “official acts.”’

case) also shared the understanding that Article 14 was not meant to give rise to universal 

civil jurisdiction.566  

Nonetheless, in the context of immunity ratione materiae of state officials, the 

ECtHR identified ‘some movement towards the establishment of an exception to State 

immunity [for acts of torture].’ 567 Indeed, upon ratification of the UNCJISP, Norway, 

Sweden and Switzerland declared that ‘… the Convention is without prejudice to any 

future international development in the protection of human rights’.568 Also, a Resolution 

of the IDI concluded in Naples in 2009 (‘Resolution on the Immunity from Jurisdiction of 

the State and of Persons Who Act on Behalf of the State in case of International Crimes’) 

provided in Article III that ‘[n]o immunity from jurisdiction other than personal immunity 

in accordance with international law applies with regard to international crime’, having 

previously established in Article I that ‘jurisdiction’ for the purposes of the Resolution 

encompassed both civil and criminal jurisdiction569. Furthermore, in a dictum of the 

Furundzija case, also mentioned by the Italian Court of Cassation in the Ferrini case, the 

ICTY, in the context of discussing the jus cogens nature of the prohibition of torture, 

declared that ‘the victim [of an act of torture] could bring a civil suit for damage in a 

foreign court, which would therefore be asked inter alia to disregard the legal value of the 

national authorising act’. 570 The separate opinion of Judges Higgins, Kooijmans and 

Buergenthal in the ICJ’s Arrest Warrant case also remarked that ‘[i]t is now increasingly 

claimed in the literature ... that serious international crimes cannot be regarded as official 

acts because they are neither normal State functions nor functions that a State alone (in 

contrast to an individual) can perform’571—although Lords Bingham and Hoffmann in 

Jones contended otherwise.  

In the light of all these elements, the ECtHR found ‘there was acknowledged not to 

be any consensus yet’ in respect of the establishment of an exception to the immunity of 

state officials for acts of torture.572

The ECtHR then turned to civil claims brought before domestic courts dealing with 

the question of whether there was a jus cogens exception in respect of the immunity 

ratione materiae of state officials. The survey of domestic case-law (Canada, Australia, 

New Zealand, the United States) undertook by the ECtHR showed that, as regards civil 

proceedings, only in the US there was judicial practice supporting the contention that 

violations of jus cogens could not be considered official acts for the purpose of immunity 

ratione materiae of state officials.573 It was concluded that there was no ‘sufficient reason 

… to find that the grant of immunity in the [Jones] case did not reflect generally 

recognised rules of public international law.’574 Although the ECtHR conceded the law on 

the matter was still evolving, it found no fault in the judgment of the House of Lords—

quite to the contrary, the ECtHR commended it: 

 
‘… [W]hile there is in the Court’s view some emerging support in favour of a special rule or 

exception in public international law in cases concerning civil claims for torture lodged against 

foreign State officials, the bulk of the authority is … to the effect that the State’s right to 

immunity may not be circumvented by suing its servants or agents instead. Taking the 

applicants’ arguments at their strongest, there is evidence of recent debate surrounding the 

understanding of the definition of torture in the Convention against Torture; the interaction 

between State immunity and the rules on attribution in the Draft Articles on State 

Responsibility; and the scope of Article 14 of the Convention against Torture … However, 

State practice on the question is in a state of flux, with evidence of both the grant and the 

refusal of immunity ratione materiae in such cases. 

‘… [T]he House of Lords fully engaged with all of the relevant arguments concerning the 

existence, in relation to civil claims of infliction of torture, of a possible exception to the 

general rule of State immunity …  In a lengthy and comprehensive judgment … it concluded 

that customary international law did not admit of any exception—regarding allegations of 

conduct amounting to torture—to the general rule of immunity ratione materiae for State 

officials in the sphere of civil claims where immunity is enjoyed by the State itself. The 

findings of the House of Lords were neither manifestly erroneous nor arbitrary but were based 

on extensive references to international law materials and consideration of the applicant’s legal 

                                                
573 Jones and others v United Kingdom (n 541) [210]-[211]. There are many difficulties surrounding judicial 
practice on this topic. The ECtHR mentioned there was ‘little national case-law’ in respect of civil claims 
against state officials for the violation of jus cogens. In respect of criminal cases, the survey of the ECtHR 
showed (§212) ‘some support … for the argument that torture cannot be committed in an “official capacity” 
…’. Also, some domestic legislations allow victims to attach a civil claim to criminal proceedings and, 
consequently, as mentioned by the ECtHR (§212), ‘… any difference in the approach to immunity ratione 
materiae between civil and criminal cases will have an impact on the degree to which civil compensation is 
available in the different States.’  
574 ibid [212].

arguments and the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which had found in the applicants’ 

favour.’575 

 

The ECtHR ultimately found that the grant of immunity ratione materiae to the 

individual defendants by the English courts reflected generally recognized rules of 

international law and did not violate Article 6.1 of the ECHR.576 

 

3.5.1.1 The dissenting opinion of Judge Kalaydjieva appended to the judgment of the 

ECtHR in Jones v United Kingdom (2014) 

 

On the point of whether there had been a violation of Article 6.1 in respect of Mr 

Jones’s claim against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Judge Kalaydjieva remarked that he 

‘[shared] the doubts’ of some of the dissenting judges in Al-Adsani. Judge Kalaydjieva 

also pointed out an incoherence in the law of state immunity that is often highlighted by 

commentators: the ECtHR ‘… had no difficulties in waiving the automatic application of 

State immunity and finding violations of the right of access to court concerning disputes 

over employment … but not concerning redress for torture.’577  

Regarding the applicants’ claims that there had been a violation of Article 6.1 due 

to the grant of immunity to the state officials, Judge Kalaydjieva recalled some of the 

arguments employed by Lord Justice Mance in the Court of Appeal’s judgment in Jones. 

He pointed out he found it difficult to accept the distinction between criminal and civil law 

justified the grant of immunity in respect of the latter only.578 He added he did not find 

compelling the argument civil proceedings against an alleged torturer involved a greater 

interference in the internal affairs of a foreign state than criminal proceedings.579 He also 

mentioned there would be an incongruity if an alleged torturer could be prosecuted under 

Article 5.2 of the CAT and at the same time could rely on immunity in respect of a civil 

claim pursued by the victim. 580  Finally, Judge Kalaydjieva criticized the ECtHR’s 

perspective on the matter, which aligned the immunity of the state itself with the immunity 

ratione materiae of state officials:

‘I find myself unable to agree with the findings of the majority that “since an act cannot be 

carried out by a State itself but only by individuals acting on the State’s behalf, where 

immunity can be invoked by the State then the starting point must be that immunity ratione 

materiae applies to the acts of [torture committed by] State officials” … This appears to 

suggest that torture is by definition an act exercised on behalf of the State. That is a far cry 

from all international standards, which not only analyse it as a personal act, but require the 

States to identify and punish the individual perpetrators of torture––contrary to the “pragmatic 

understanding” of the majority that “[i]f it were otherwise, State immunity could always be 

circumvented by suing named officials”. I fear that the views expressed by the majority on a 

question examined by this Court for the first time not only extend State immunity to named 

officials without proper distinction or justification, but give the impression of also being 

capable of extending impunity for acts of torture globally.’581 

 

 Judge Kalaydjieva did not miss the opportunity and remembered the words of 

Judge Ferrari Bravo in his dissenting opinion appended to Al-Adsani: 

 
‘To use the words of one of the dissenting judges in Al-Adsani: “What a pity!”’582 

 

3.6 Concluding remarks 

 

The trickle did not turn to a flood. The mainstream, hegemonic approach in respect 

of the law of state immunity prevailed in spite of being strongly contested by alternative 

views. Before the delivery of the ICJ’s judgment in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State, 

Roger O’Keefe remarked the following: 

 
‘The final nail in the coffin of attempts to circumvent state immunity in domestic civil 

proceedings for death or personal injury alleged to be caused by the defendant state in breach 

of some norm, perhaps peremptory, of international law relative to the humane treatment of 

individuals may well prove to be the case of Jurisdictional Immunities of the State, brought by 

Germany against Italy in the ICJ and currently in progress.  

‘…[I]t is extremely hard to picture a majority of the [ICJ] backing—in the absence of 

consistent and representative state practice and opinio juris (not to mention logically cogent 

arguments) in support of the proposition, and given the potential of such a decision to lead to 

antagonism between states—a customary international rule to the effect that state immunity is 

                                                
581 Jones and others v United Kingdom (Dissenting Opinion of Judge Kalaydjieva) (n 577). 
582 ibid. 



173  

unavailable as a bar to domestic civil proceedings alleging the violation by the defendant 

foreign state of rules, even those of a peremptory character, of international law. And were the 

ICJ, as is not unlikely, to come down categorically against such a rule, even if only in terms of 

customary international law “as it presently stands” and subject to an impassioned dissent by 

Judge Cançado Trindade, the chances that future national courts (or legislatures) would reopen 

the matter are close to zero.’583 

  

Indeed, the ICJ, through its quantitative approach to the ascertainment of 

customary international law and resorting to formalist arguments like the distinction 

between procedural and substantive rules, may have crystallized a consensus according to 

which state immunity prevails over individual rights. This consensus came about through 

what Roger O’Keefe called a ‘customary international legal feedback loop’. As put by 

him: 

 
‘… Al-Adsani and Kalogeropoulou have given rise to a customary international legal feedback 

loop. The ECtHR holds that states do not currently accept that state immunity is unavailable as 

a bar to domestic proceedings for damages in respect of death or personal injury allegedly 

caused by an international wrong at the hands of the defendant state. As a result, the courts of 

nearly all of the member states of the Council of Europe dismiss legal arguments in favor of 

the unavailability of state immunity in such cases. In turn, it stands to reason that the ECtHR, 

and indeed other relevant international jurisdictions, will hold in future that states do not accept 

that state immunity is unavailable as a bar to domestic proceedings for damages in respect of 

death or personal injury allegedly caused by an international wrong at the hands of the 

defendant state. And so on in saecula saeculorum.  

‘In addition, we are already seeing the courts of states outside the Council of Europe, when 

similarly faced with the submission that international law does not require the grant of state 

immunity in civil claims for torture, looking for guidance to the decisions of the ECtHR in Al-

Adsani and Kalogeropoulou or to subsequent decisions of the courts of states parties to the 

ECHR in analogous cases—especially, in the common law world, to the influential conclusion 

of the House of Lords in Jones.’584  
 

The scope of the ICJ’s ruling was very strict as regards the tort exception (in 

essence, the ICJ considered the tort exception inapplicable in respect of acts committed by 

armed forces in the course of an armed conflict in the territory of the forum state), but it 

may be subject to more expansive readings in the future. Also, the argument according to

174  

which jus cogens may override state immunity is unlikely to succeed in the future. In 

Jones, as seen previously, the ECtHR employed the ICJ’s pronouncement in respect of the 

relationship between state immunity and jus cogens to support its reasoning. It is worth 

remembering that eight out the seventeen judges of the Grand Chamber dissented of the 

judgment rendered in the Al-Adsani case. The Jones case was decided by a chamber of the 

ECtHR. Out of the six judges, only one dissented and put forth that the approach adopted 

in Al-Adsani should have been reconsidered. This is an indication that the current 

professional consensus does not favor further restrictions to state immunity. 

As mentioned before, the Italian Court of Cassation, in Judgment No 238/2014, 

rebelled against the ruling of the ICJ, but, as asserted by Fontanelli, ‘it is clear that Italy 

has gone down a spiral of isolation from the rest of the international community.’585 

The antiquity and persistence of the law of state immunity may indeed explain 

partially its ‘pull to compliance’586. State immunity is, after all, widely understood as an 

expression of defining characteristics of the international legal system.

4 — PROPOSALS BY SCHOLARS 
 

 

  

 

 

In this chapter, I expose and analyze the critiques of attempts to better reconcile 

state immunity and human rights and the proposals to accomplish it put forth by two 

scholars, namely Lee Caplan and Jürgen Bröhmer. The chapter concludes by briefly 

assessing them. 

 

4.1 Lee Caplan 

 

4.1.1 Critiques of other attempts to reconcile state immunity and human rights 

 

In Caplan’s view, the normative hierarchy theory is flawed in its foundations. As 

mentioned previously in this monograph, the normative hierarchy theory, perceiving the 

existence of a conflict between state immunity and jus cogens, asserts that jus cogens 

norms, due to their higher rank, must be given precedence. According to Caplan, ‘the 

norms that are purportedly at odds with one another under the normative hierarchy theory 

in reality never clash’.1 As seen in the first chapter of this monograph, Caplan is one of the 

authors who contend that state immunity does not arise from the principle of sovereign 

equality and the maxim derived from it—par in parem non habet imperium.2 According to 

Caplan, the principle of sovereign equality ought to be read as meaning an ‘equal capacity 

for rights’.3 In his view, from this understanding, it follows that  

 
‘… [t]his [equal] capacity diminishes when a state intrudes on another state’s sphere of 

authority, and becomes virtually dormant within another state’s territorial borders. There is 

thus no inherent right of state immunity, as, ironically, is often suggested in the writings in 

support of the normative hierarchy approach.’4

Theory’ (2003) 97(4) AJIL 741, 771.

3 ibid. 
4 ibid. 



176  

 

According to Caplan, the binding norms created by the practice of waiving 

adjudicatory jurisdiction (ie, norms relating to state immunity) do not comprehend ‘state 

conduct … that undermines the aim and purpose of the international legal order.’5 This is 

why he says that the normative hierarchy theory implies that the scope of state immunity is 

larger than what is required by the international legal order.  

The real conflict, according to Caplan, does not occur between state immunity and 

jus cogens, but between jus cogens and the state’s right of adjudicatory jurisdiction, since, 

in his perspective, the grant of immunity in cases of violations of human rights is the result 

of the exercise by the forum state of its authority to regulate access to its courts.6 Lady 

Hazel Fox, in her treatise on the law of state immunity, famously stated that  

 
 ‘State immunity is a procedural rule going to the jurisdiction of a national court. It does not go 

to substantive law; it does not contradict a prohibition contained in a jus cogens norm but 

merely diverts any breach of it to a different method of settlement. Arguably then, there is no 

substantive content in the procedural plea of State immunity upon which a jus cogens mandate 

can bite.’7 

 

Supported by this quotation, Caplan adds another criticism to the normative 

hierarchy theory:  

 
‘To demonstrate a clash of international law norms, the normative hierarchy theory must prove 

the existence of a jus cogens norm that prohibits the granting of immunity for violations of 

human rights by foreign states. However, the normative hierarchy theory provides no evidence 

of such a peremptory norm.’8 

 

Caplan also makes the point that the difficulties surrounding the application of jus 

cogens norms undermine the normative hierarchy theory. As is known, although there is a 

positive concept of jus cogens, there is a not a consensus in respect of the content and the 

scope of the body of jus cogens beyond a few norms (eg, prohibitions against torture, 

slavery, aggression, genocide).9 Since, pursuant to the normative hierarchy theory, all jus

177  

cogens norms can potentially pierce the veil of state immunity, courts might found 

themselves in an odd situation. As explained by Caplan:  

  
‘Requiring application of the theory beyond cases of genocide, slavery, and torture would 

place national courts in an awkward position. The [normative hierarchy] theory not only would 

deprive the forum state of its right to regulate access to its own courts, but also would force 

them to determine whether a particular norm of international law had attained the status of jus 

cogens, a task that international legal scholars have grappled with for decades with only 

limited success. Further, the normative hierarchy theory logically requires courts to treat all 

violations of peremptory norms uniformly, even violations of norms that do not implicate 

human rights but are arguably jus cogens, such as pacta sunt servanda. In addition, allowing 

the courts to determine the parameters of jus cogens through application of the normative 

hierarchy theory may undermine the principle of separation of powers, in some cases 

inappropriately transferring foreign-policymaking power from the political branches of 

government to the judiciary. Finally … [the] adoption of the normative hierarchy theory could 

be the first step on a slippery slope that begins with state immunity from jurisdiction but could 

quickly extend to state immunity from execution against sovereign property and ultimately 

threaten the “orderly international co-operation” between states.’10 

 

Another argument advanced by Caplan is that, if one considers the principle of 

state jurisdiction as belonging to the body of jus cogens, then there would be difficulties in 

situations in which it clashes with jus cogens norms relating to the protection of human 

rights. Caplan questions:  

 
‘Can there be a hierarchy of norms within the body of peremptory norms and, if so, which 

ranks higher, human rights or territorial jurisdiction? The answers to these questions, if any, lie 

deep in uncharted territory of international legal scholarship … The very fact that the 

normative hierarchy theory would appear to lead courts into such a theoretical abyss casts 

doubt on its practical viability and utility.’11  

  

Caplan also critiques two explanations linked to the normative hierarchy theory of 

how a state may lose its entitlement to immunity. The first explanation is the implied 

waiver theory, according to which a state, by violating a jus cogens norm, implicitly 

renounces its right to immunity. The second explanation is that according to which 

                                                
10 Caplan (n 1) 773 (footnotes omitted). 
11 ibid 774.  



178  

violations of jus cogens are not within the scope of acts jure imperii, thus being outside the 

realm of acts protected by immunity.  

Since, in Caplan’s view, the principle of adjudicatory jurisdiction is the starting 

point of analysis and there is no entitlement to state immunity in respect of human rights 

violations in international law, he concludes the ‘implied waiver’ theory is not compelling. 

In his words: 

 
‘[A] foreign state’s entitlement to immunity for human rights violations is not derived from 

international law, so a foreign state cannot lose its right to immunity by violating international 

law.’12 

 

The second explanation is also not compelling to him: 

 
‘[A] foreign state does not cease to be a sovereign state simply because it commits acts of a 

criminal nature, including violations of human rights norms. Moreover, if state conduct that 

violates jus cogens is assertedly not jure imperii and obviously not jure gestionis (private or 

commercial), then what is it? This question is not addressed by supporters of the normative 

hierarchy theory. The real answer lies in the fact that foreign states are entitled to immunity for 

human rights violations only to the extent that a forum state grants them that privilege.’13  

 

 It thus can be said that Lee Caplan rejects the normative hierarchy theory in all its 

facets. 

 

4.1.2 Proposal  

 

Being a critic of the normative hierarchy theory and dismissing the soundness of 

the approach to state immunity according to which the starting point is the principle of 

sovereign equality, Caplan proposes an alternative perspective, labeled by him as the 

‘theory of state collective benefit’. It is a proposal de lege lata, insofar as Caplan believes 

there is a misunderstanding concerning the basis of state immunity. One of the foundations 

of his approach is Chief Justice Marshall’s judgment in the Schooner Exchange case. As 

discussed before, in this case Marshall considered that  

 

                                                
12 Caplan (n 1) 775. 
13 ibid (footnotes omitted). 



179  

‘… [the] common interest impelling [sovereigns] to mutual intercourse, and an interchange of 

good offices with each other, have given rise to a class of cases in which every sovereign is 

understood to waive the exercise of a part of that complete exclusive territorial jurisdiction 

which has been stated to be the attribute of every nation.’14 

 

Caplan conceives state immunity ‘… as arising out of an agreement forged between 

the forum state and any foreign state with which it seeks to develop transnational 

intercourse.’15 The crystallization of this practice into customary international law would 

thus determine the scope of the international rule of state immunity, which is founded, as 

remarked by Chief Justice Marshall, on the common interest of states. According to 

Caplan, the ICJ adopted this functional approach to state immunity in the Arrest Warrant 

case when it considered that ‘… in customary international law, the immunities accorded 

to Ministers for Foreign Affairs are not granted for their personal benefit, but to ensure the 

effective performance of their functions on behalf of their respective States.’ 16 It is 

doubtful whether the ICJ departed from the approach according to which state immunity 

derives from the principle of sovereign equality of state. In Jurisdictional Immunities of the 

State, a judgment delivered about a decade later, the ICJ stated that ‘the rule of State 

immunity … derives from the principle of sovereign equality of States’.17  In any case, 

Caplan laid out his alternative approach to state immunity in the following way:  

 
‘… the sole raison d’être for state immunity under customary international law is so that states 

can perform their public functions effectively and ensure that international relations are 

conducted in an orderly fashion.  

‘If one accepts this basic premise, then conduct of a foreign state that does not conform with 

the development of beneficial interstate relations falls outside the state immunity “agreement” 

and thus is not immune by virtue of international custom. The most obvious example excludes 

foreign state conduct that does significant harm to the vital interests of the forum state, such as 

the commission of human rights abuses against the forum state’s nationals. Accordingly, the 

basic test for distinguishing between immune and nonimmune transactions should not be

180  

whether the state conduct is public or private, as the theory of restrictive immunity requires, 

but whether such conduct would substantially harm the vital interests of the forum state.’18  

 

Caplan’s starting point is the state’s right of adjudicatory jurisdiction, which gives 

states a lot of leeway to determine the scope of state immunity rules. Nevertheless, Caplan 

lays down two limitations to this approach. The first one relates to the consistency of the 

forum state’s immunity policy with the international rules of adjudicatory jurisdiction—in 

his words, ‘… when opening up domestic courts to human rights litigation, it is necessary 

to ensure maintenance of an appropriate connection between the dispute and the forum 

state under international law.’ 19  The second one relates to the consistency with 

international law in general. As put by him, ‘… any alteration in state immunity law that 

unjustifiably endangers peaceful relations may be unlawful.’20 

Finally, Caplan gives two examples in international practice consistent with his 

‘theory of collective state benefit’.  

The first one is the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act 1996, which 

amended the FSIA 1976. As previously discussed, this Amendment removes immunity in 

cases in which ‘… money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or 

death that was caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage 

taking, or the provision of material support or resources for such an act…’.21 This removal 

of immunity is applicable only in respect of states designated by the United States as 

‘sponsors of terrorism’. Also, as specified by the Act, the claimant or the victim must be a 

‘national of the United States’, ‘a member of the armed forces’ or ‘otherwise an employee 

of the Government of the United States, or of an individual performing a contract awarded 

by the United States Government, acting within the scope of the employee’s employment’. 

The second example given by Caplan is the judgment of the Greek Court of 

Cassation in the Distomo Massacre case. As previously discussed, in this judgment, the 

Areios Pagos mentioned the emergence in international law of an exception to state 

immunity in respect of torts committed in the state of the forum, but remarked that this 

exception did not apply in situations of armed conflict. However, in the case, Germany had 

perpetrated crimes against people unconnected with the military operations, which led the

181  

Court to hold that the tort exception to state immunity was applicable—furthermore, as 

argued by the Greek Court of Cassation, those acts had been committed in abuse of 

sovereign power. Caplan commended the reasoning adopted in the judgment of the Areios 

Pagos, except in respect of its endorsement of the normative hierarchy theory. Caplan 

concluded that both examples 

 
‘… demonstrate that progress can be made in resolving the human rights litigation problem in 

a manner consistent with the true nature of the doctrine of foreign state immunity. That is to 

say that the forum state, through the agent it designates to create and interpret foreign state 

immunity law (the U.S. Congress in the case of the 1996 amendment and the Hellenic Supreme 

Court in the case of Prefecture of Voiotia [the Distomo Massacre case]), is empowered to 

modify foreign state immunity law to an extent consistent with the theory of collective state 

benefit.’22 

 

4.2 Jürgen Bröhmer  

 

4.2.1 Critiques of other attempts to reconcile state immunity and human rights  

 

In his book, which, to my knowledge, was the first one to deal comprehensively 

with the relationship between state immunity and human rights, Bröhmer critically 

surveyed four attempts to reconcile both. 

Bröhmer dismisses the implied waiver theory, according to which, by violating a 

jus cogens norm, a state waives its right to immunity. He presented the following criticism: 

 
‘Waiver of immunity is just another term for consenting to submit to the jurisdiction of the 

forum. To construe consent where there is none does not make sense. … While it is unclear 

whether a state is really entitled to immunity in cases of jus cogens violations, the intentions of 

that state will certainly not be directed at giving up its claim to immunity. The opposite is true 

and that is precisely the reason for the controversy. If, however, the state’s interest and 

intention is to avoid a lawsuit and possible liability, it is illogical to maintain that the same 

state has waived the very right enabling to achieve that goal. To construe an implied waiver in 

these cases is effectively the same as saying that here is no immunity in the first place for states 

which have violated the said norms of international law.’23 

 
                                                
22 Caplan (n 1) 780. 
23  Jürgen Bröhmer, State Immunity and the Violation of Human Rights (Martinus Nijhoff 1997) 191 
(footnotes omitted). 



182  

Bröhmer also highlights the inadequacies of restricting immunity as a ‘reprisal’. As 

pointed out by Matthias Ruffert, the notion of ‘reprisals’ has largely been replaced by that 

of ‘countermeasures’—something that is reflected in the DARSIWA 2001, which adopted 

the latter notion. The term ‘reprisals’ is nowadays limited to the context of wartime 

measures.24 In any case, Bröhmer employed the term in a manner coincident with the 

current usage of countermeasures, ie as ‘… coercive measures adopted by one state against 

another state, which would be illegal under international law, were it not aimed at the 

settlement of a dispute brought about by the latter’s illegal or unjustified conduct.’25 The 

ILC’s Commentaries to the DARSIWA state that countermeasures  

 
‘… may only be taken by an injured State in order to induce the responsible State to comply 

with its obligations … to cease the internationally wrongful conduct, if it is continuing, and to 

provide reparation to the injured State. Countermeasures are not intended as a form of 

punishment for wrongful conduct, but as an instrument for achieving compliance with the 

obligations of the responsible State [to cease the internationally wrongful conduct] …’26 

 

Bröhmer points outs several problems that may arise from the adoption of the 

notion of reprisals in order to justify the restriction of state immunity in respect of 

violations of human rights:  

 
‘First and foremost, it would require that the denial of immunity is considered a violation of 

international law and only admissible because it is itself directed against such a violation. Even 

if one were to consider the denial of immunity in such cases as contrary to international law … 

this notion could not be upheld. Within the framework of judicial proceedings it would 

inevitably lead into a circular argument because it will often be the object of the proceedings to 

determine whether international law has been breached. Should the court determine that this 

was not the case, the forum state would itself have committed a violation of international law 

by allowing the proceedings in the first place. This would cause a great amount of legal 

uncertainty, without answering the principle underlying question of whether international law 

demands immunity in such cases and if so why, respectively, why not. Other questions and 

problems would arise in regard to the controversial nature of the concept of reprisal itself. 

What kind of link is necessary between the state using its court system as a reprisal and the

183  

violation to be remedied by it (e.g. protection of nationals only?) and how do those links differ 

from those needed to establish jurisdiction stricto sensu?’27 

 

A similar proposal to that of the implied waiver theory, the idea of forfeiture of 

immunity as a consequence of the jus cogens and erga omnes character of the human rights 

norms violated is also not accepted by Bröhmer, since ‘… resorting to forfeiture would 

mean that all cases in which the violation of jus cogens norms of international human 

rights law is at issue would have to be treated the same’ and he doubts whether that would 

be an adequate solution.28 

Lastly, Bröhmer analyzes Mathias Reimann’s proposal for an amendment of the 

FSIA to allow suits for human rights violations. Mathias Reimann considered two 

explanations for the removal of immunity in respect of human rights violation: the first is 

the argument according to which a violation of jus cogens could not be considered a 

sovereign act, thus not being entitled to immunity; the second, the argument according to 

which jus cogens norms are hierarchically superior to the norms relating to state immunity, 

and, as result, the former take precedence over the latter.29 Mathias Reimann takes the 

position that these propositions may have troublesome consequences, insofar as they 

suggest state immunity should always be denied in respect of jus cogens violations.30 

Reimann argues that the approaches which suggest ‘… the forum may, or at most should 

(but not must) deny immunity for massive human rights violations’ are more consistent 

with ‘the two major principles underlying the sovereign immunity rule, namely 

noninterference with another state’s internal affairs, and equality of sovereigns’.31 In the 

light of these considerations, he proposes ‘… an individual country’s courts should hear 

only cases in which this country has a specific and legitimate concern.’32 In the context of 

the FSIA, he expresses approval as regards piercing the veil of immunity in cases in which 

nationals of the forum state were victims of grave human rights violations.33 In any case, 

Reimann recommends caution and advises that

‘… in order to enhance the international acceptability of results, courts in human cases against 

foreign sovereigns should tread lightly and err on the side of deference to the defendant state’s 

law as long as such law is acceptable under international standards.’34 

 

Bröhmer asserts that Reimann’s proposal is, in fact, ‘no restriction from the point 

of view of international law because such an exception could then be invoked by nationals 

of all countries in their respective domestic forums.’35 In his view, Reimann’s proposal 

does not really reconcile human rights and state immunity because it does not confer 

proper regard to the sovereignty of the defendant state, thus defeating the purpose of 

immunity rules.36 

 

4.2.2 Proposal  

 

In order to formulate his proposal, Bröhmer sought to identify the rationale that 

governs the attribution of immunity and then to apply it to the situation of human rights 

violations. In Bröhmer’s assessment, state practice revealed two approaches in respect of 

the grant of state immunity.37 The first one adopts the distinction between acta jure imperii 

and acta jure gestionis. The second one supports the understanding according to which the 

veil of immunity can be pierced even in respect of acta jure imperii if there is a sufficient 

territorial link.  

Bröhmer argues that these two mainstream approaches reveal that the distinction 

between immune and non-immune acts is based on three elements.38 He labels the first two 

elements ‘option’ and ‘risk calculability’. The third element is the pacifying function of 

immunity.39 If these criteria justify the removal of immunity in some cases, it should be 

assessed whether they could also justify the removal of immunity in respect of human 

rights violations.  

Bröhmer explains the ‘option’ element in the following way:  

  

                                                
34 Reimann (n 29) 422 (footnotes omitted). 
35 Bröhmer (n 23) 196. 
36 ibid. 
37 ibid 197. 
38 ibid. 
39 ibid: ‘Immunity as a reflection of a state’s sovereignty is also aimed at avoiding conflicts between states. 
The immunity privilege safeguards and preserves the international peace of justice.’ 



185  

‘The gestionis/imperii distinction is in principle based on the fictional assumption that by 

choosing private means of pursuing an objective the state also willingly exposes itself to the 

potential liability risks and to private remedies available to the other party of the transaction.  

… Under the broad restrictive approach, which denies immunity for government torts if a 

sufficient territorial link can be established, the right to exercise jurisdiction can be justified as 

a consequence of the decision of the foreign state to act within (or with a sufficient connection 

to) the territory and the legal order of the forum state.’40 

 

The idea underlying the ‘risk calculability’ element is that  
 

‘… foreign states should be able to foresee and calculate potential liability risks which might 

arise as a result of their exposure to foreign jurisdiction and thus be put in a position to adapt 

their behavior accordingly. … [T]he higher the liability risk, the more difficult it will be to 

argue that the state really opted to accept that risk.’41  

 

Bröhmer links both criteria to the concept of sovereignty. The ‘option’ element 

relates to the sovereign equality of states and emphasizes consent, whilst the ‘risk 

calculability’ element relates to the functional aspect of sovereignty and puts into the 

equation the fact that the ability of a state to perform its functions could be threatened if it 

had to cover liability claims in a multitude of fora around the world.42  

Bröhmer assesses that the ‘option’ element can also justify the removal of 

immunity in cases of human rights violations. In the same way a state can choose whether 

or not to enter into a private transaction, a state can choose among alternatives in the 

domain of human rights. The distinction is that, in the domain of human rights, the option 

is predetermined by international law. As put by Bröhmer: 
 

‘States must not violate fundamental human rights. The sovereignty of states does not include 

the right to submit an individual to torture or to arbitrarily kill people … Nonetheless, the state 

fully retains the power to influence its fate: no violation, no liability.’43 

 

As regards the ‘risk calculability element’, Bröhmer points out that, in the context 

of commercial transactions, ‘the economic interest of the state will in most cases prevent 

the state from assuming unforeseeable and incalculable commercial risks’.44 The situation

41 ibid 197. 
42 ibid 198. 
43 ibid 199. 
44 ibid 201. 



186  

in respect of torts is different, insofar only negligent torts are insurable. Although 

intentional torts are not insurable, Bröhmer considers that, in this case, ‘the impossibility 

of precisely pre-calculating the liability risk is compensated by the fact that the state has 

full control of its conduct.’45 Furthermore, Bröhmer points out that the position of a state as 

regards an intentional tort can be even more favorable than as regards a commercial 

transaction. As put by him: 
 

‘Whereas practical circumstances might force a state to enter into a high risk commercial 

transaction, it is inconceivable that a state might be compelled to commit an intentional tort by 

way of violating human rights.’46  

 

In the light of these considerations, Bröhmer concludes the ‘risk calculability’ 

element does not support the view that human rights violations should be protected by 

immunity. The ‘option’ and the ‘risk calculability’ elements, in Bröhmer’s analysis, justify 

protecting states with the shield of immunity. There are situations in which, however, not 

granting immunity to states in respect of human rights violations may not fulfill the third 

criterion proposed by Bröhmer in order to differentiate between immune and non-immune 

conducts: the pacifying function of immunity. As argued by him:  
 

‘… [H]uman rights can be violated in many different ways. Massive violations of the laws of 

war, for example, could result in the death or injury of thousands, perhaps even millions of 

individuals. If all these potential victims were to bring actions against the violating state, the 

state would necessarily cease to function long before all these individuals could be 

compensated. Even if one assumes that the violating state would try to comply with judgments 

rendered against it, compensation would reach only a few individuals on a “first-come-first-

serve” basis. However, it is questionable whether any state could and would accept a regime 

which would render it defunct both internally and externally as a member of the international 

community. Such a regime would undoubtedly jeopardise the international peace of justice 

while at the same time doing nothing for the individual victim. The war crimes committed by 

all sides during World War II, the Holocaust with its millions of victims, the conflict in former 

Yugoslavia, to name just a few examples, cannot be dealt with before the district courts of the 

world, notwithstanding the fact that all the suffering brought about by these violations of 

international law was ultimately individual suffering.’47  

 

                                                
45 Bröhmer (n 23) 201. 
46 ibid 202. 
47 ibid 204-205. 



187  

Having this in mind, Bröhmer proposes that immunity should be removed in 

respect of violations of human rights ‘carried out with the intention to inflict injury on 

specific, isolated and pre-identified individuals’ and preserved as regards violations of 

human rights ‘… carried out indiscriminately, for example in an armed conflict’48. Whilst 

very original, Bröhmer’s proposal sounds indeed quite shocking. The rationale is that the 

liability risk associated with individualized violations of human rights will not threaten a 

state’s functional sovereignty. As explained by Bröhmer: 
 

‘War, war crimes and genocide per definitionem inflict pain on thousands, sometimes millions 

of individuals. Municipal courts are just not equipped to deal with the sheer number of cases 

which could arise from such crimes. It would be impossible for the responsible state to satisfy 

all the judgments rendered against it. Even an attempt to do so would cripple its ability to 

function as a state for an unpredictable period of time. The resulting inability to continue to 

function as a state, to preserve peace and to promote some kind of general welfare, would not 

only constitute the ultimate infringement on that state’s functional sovereignty it would also 

constitute a threat to international peace because states would most likely not accept such 

subordination.’49 

 

Bröhmer admits there are borderline cases in which it is difficult to differentiate 

between individualized and indiscriminate violations of human rights. In these cases, 

Bröhme suggests a procedure analogous to that of filing bankruptcy:  
 

‘The defendant state could be allowed to invoke the immunity defence if it can establish to the 

satisfaction of the court that the exercise of jurisdiction in this particular case could prompt so 

many other victims of human rights violations to also commence proceedings in the same or 

other national forums that the cumulative effect of a negative outcome of these cases would 

imperil its functional sovereignty. 

‘… The state’s position could be improved further by applying the rule “in dubio pro 

immunitate” in this respect. In borderline cases the defendant state’s position could be 

additionally improved if recourse to the immunity defence were allowed if the state proves to 

the court that it has submitted the matter either to a respective international institution with 

jurisdiction to review the allegations and provide the plaintiff with adequate compensation or 

to some other effective international dispute settlement mechanism.’50 

 

                                                
48 Bröhmer (n 23) 205.  
49 ibid 206-207. 
50 ibid 212-213. 



188  

 In sum, Bröhmer’s argument is that international law does not prohibit states from 

exercising jurisdiction over foreign states in cases in which victims of human rights 

violations seek damages against the foreign state for injuries which could be characterized 

as torts under the law of the forum, even if these violations were committed jure imperii. 

Bröhmer, however, adds a limitation: immunity remains if the exercise of jurisdiction over 

the matter in question could threaten the foreign state’s functional sovereignty by allowing 

a large number of similar claims, since that could interfere with the foreign state’s capacity 

to discharge its public functions.51  
 

4.3 Assessment and concluding remarks 

 

 As seen in chapter 3, most judgments dealing with the relationship between state 

immunity and human rights relied on an amorphous notion of sovereignty and on the 

maxim par in parem non habet jurisdiction and lacked a more solid theoretical elaboration 

of the law of state immunity. The proposals put forth by Caplan and Bröhmer reveal that 

the foundations of the principles and rules relating to state immunity are still a contentious 

issue. 

                                                
51 Bröhmer (n 23) 214. Bröhmer formulated a provision codifying his proposal that could be included in an 
international treaty on the subject of state immunity in the following way:  
 

‘A Foreign State shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of the forum State to adjudicate 
‘A. If the case of action relates to death or personal injury and the act or omission, whether 
governmental in nature or not, which caused the death or injury also constitutes a violation of 
such fundamental international human rights, which are part of the jus cogens body of 
international law, eg the prohibition of torture and extrajudicial killing, and if  
‘1. the act or omission of the Foreign State which caused the death or personal injury was 
aimed at the injured or killed individual and if  
‘2. the act or omission of the Foreign State which caused the death or personal injury is not in 
violation of other norms of international law designed to protect large groups of individuals, eg 
the prohibition of genocide and if 
‘3. the act or omission of the Foreign State which caused the death or personal injury did not 
occur in the context of an armed conflict between states. 
‘B. In exceptional circumstances a Foreign State shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the 
forum State to adjudicate despite the applicability of section A.1 above 
‘1. if the Foreign State presents a prima facie case that the exercise of jurisdiction in this matter 
could lead to an unforeseeable number of similar claims in the forum state or other states 
which to settle individually could seriously interfere with the Foreign State’s ability to 
discharge its public functions or if  
‘2. the Foreign State establishes to the satisfaction of the tribunal that it has submitted the 
matter either to a respective international institutional with jurisdiction to review the 
allegations and provide the plaintiff with adequate compensation or to some other effective 
international dispute settlement mechanism.’ 

 



189  

Caplan’s attempt to reconcile state immunity and human rights sought to rescue a 

foundational discourse on the rationale of state immunity enshrined in Chief Justice 

Marshall’s judgment in Schooner Exchange, namely that state immunity has the function 

of ensuring the development of beneficial relations among states. In Caplan’s view, it 

should follow that conducts that do not conform to this purpose, such as human rights 

violations, are not immune under international law. Caplan also emphasizes that the 

international rules on jurisdiction must be respected, ie there must be an appropriate 

connection between the dispute and the forum state in accordance with international law.  

Bröhmer took a different path. He tried to identify the elements that justify the 

removal of immunity in the two mainstream approaches to the law of state immunity. As 

seen previously, the first one is based on the distinction between acta jure imperii and acta 

jure gestionis and posits that immunity should be accorded only to the former. The second 

model posits that the veil of state immunity can be pierced even for acta jure imperii 

provided the existence of a sufficient territorial link. In Bröhmer’s view, the elements that 

govern these two approaches can justify the removal of immunity in respect of human 

rights violations, subject to the limitation that the exercise of jurisdiction in these cases 

does not threaten the functional aspect of the foreign state’s sovereignty. In Bröhmer’s 

model, therefore, cases connected to indiscriminate violations of human rights would 

remain protected by state immunity.  

 Both authors highlighted the awkwardness of the solutions generally adopted to 

justify the removal of state immunity in human rights cases, such as the normative 

hierarchy theory and the implied waiver theory. 

 Although both proposals are interesting, thus far they failed to gain general 

acceptance. As discussed in chapter 3, in Germany v Prefecture of Vojotia, the Italian 

Court of Cassation adopted a functional approach to state immunity identical to the one 

proposed by Caplan, but it remained isolated.

191  

 

The relationship between state immunity and human rights has been one of the 

most controversial and discussed subjects of international law. The decision rendered by 

the ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State was said to have settled some key points 

of the debate. Finally there would be certainty in a debate relating to an area of law 

distinguished by fragmentation. As Philippa Webb correctly indicated, the ICJ’s 

Jurisdictional Immunities of the State judgment can provide a ‘point of integration’ 

concerning the law.1 Although it may be argued that it is a bad point of integration, the 

authority usually attached to pronouncements of the ICJ has the effect of consolidating the 

law and limiting to a certain extent the scope of further discussions on the issues that were 

settled.  

One could, therefore, conclude that the only logical thing for commentators and 

theorists to do would be to update textbooks to include the inescapable conclusions drawn 

by the ICJ and to write articles commenting on and spreading the ‘correct’ legal 

interpretation. Notwithstanding this line of thinking, I share Andrea Bianchi’s belief that 

‘[t]here is nothing inherently correct or incorrect in a judicial determination such as this.’2  

This chapter argues that the technical and dogmatic normative discussions engaged 

in by the various courts which had to deal with issues relating to state immunity and 

human rights hide theoretical conflicts, which happen at a ‘higher level of abstraction’.3 

What we have at hand is essentially a conflict among different conceptions of international 

law. There is nothing inherent about the hegemonic outcome privileging state immunity to 

the detriment of human rights. This consensus, which may have crystallized with the ICJ’s 

ruling in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State, is contingent and can be questioned.  

In the first part of this chapter, I shall present Koskenniemi’s proposal to treat 

international law as a language and discuss how it relates to the problem of the 

indeterminacy of international law. Koskenniemi’s argument highlights the contingency of 

current preferred interpretative outcomes and the existence of structural biases.  

In the following section, I contend that the legal questions in respect of the 

relationship between state immunity and human rights the various courts had to consider 

do not have objectively ascertainable answers. As previously mentioned, the conflicting

Structure of International Legal Argument (CUP 2005) 3. 



192  

answers reproduce theoretical conflicts that happen at a ‘higher level of abstraction’. The 

hegemonic outcomes may, therefore, be questioned through the language of international 

law. In the case of the relationship between state immunity and human rights, it is 

considered that, although the ICJ may have crystallized a consensus according to which the 

former prevails over the latter, many dissenting voices emerged and this position remains 

open to contestation. It is also highlighted how the different theoretical approaches to 

international law resulted in different attitudes towards its ascertainment and towards the 

role of the interpreter and of the institution in charge of applying the law. Subsequently, it 

is analyzed whether the judicial practice surveyed represented a victory for formalism in 

matters regarding the relationship between state immunity and human rights.  

Prospects are considered in the next section. It is pondered whether there may still 

be room for courts to reassess the relationship between state immunity and human rights. 

The section then briefly examines the proposal for an optional protocol to the UNCJISP 

providing for the abrogation of state immunity in civil claims based on violations of human 

rights. Also, it discusses the suggestion that focus should be shifted from the failure of the 

forum state’s courts to provide a remedy for the victims of serious violations of human 

rights as a result of the grant of state immunity to the state which caused death or personal 

injury in breach of international law and to the state which failed to defend the rights of its 

nationals who were victims of human rights violations committed by other states. Some 

concluding remarks ensue.  

 

5.1 International law as language 

 

In his treatise on the structure of international legal argumentation, Koskenniemi 

posited the thesis that international law has a ‘… “grammar” which controls the production 

of particular arguments within discourse and which counts for the lawyer’s specific legal 

“competence”’,4 defined by him as ‘… the ability to use grammar in order to generate 

meaning by doing things in argument.’5 Said grammar imposes limitations related to how 

competently arguments may be presented, but not to substantive outcomes: competent 

                                                
4 Martti Koskenniemi (n 3) 11. 
5 ibid 571. 



193  

lawyers are able to defend conflicting positions in a legal dispute, and thus justify different 

substantive outcomes.6 As summarized by Koskenniemi: 

 
‘The argumentative architecture allows any decision, and thus also the critique of any decision 

without the question of the professional competence of the decision-maker ever arising. 

Participants and observers will continue to disagree on the particular interpretations of the facts 

and the law, but the disagreements will remain internal to the profession … They are matters of 

“feel” and choice; they are the politics of international law. This does not mean that decisions 

would be random or difficult to predict … Competent lawyers are aware of patterns and 

tendencies. In any language, some expressions are used more than other expressions. This is 

not a function of the grammar, however, but of the social and cultural context in which native 

speakers act.’7 

 

The distinction made by Ferdinand de Saussure, in his Cours de linguistique 

générale, between langue and parole provides one way to better picture this relationship 

between the grammar of international law and the possibility of employing it to produce 

opposing, but equally competent, legal arguments.  

Saussure emphasizes the difficulty of establishing the object of linguistics due to 

the constant duality that characterizes the linguistic phenomenon. 8  Syllables, says 

Saussure, are ‘acoustic impressions’ perceived by the ear, but they would not exist without 

vocal organs.9 Sound, a ‘complex acoustic-vocal unity’, composes with the idea a complex 

physiologic and mental unity.10 According to Saussure, the langage is also characterized 

by dualities: it has a social and an individual aspect and it implies at the same time an 

established and an evolving system.11 Saussure’s solution to the problem posed is to focus 

on the langue, which can, according to him, be autonomously defined.12  

The langage ‘… est multiforme et hétéroclite ; à cheval sur plusieurs domaines, à la 

fois physique, physiologique et psychique … il ne se laisse classer dans aucune catégorie 

des faits humains, parce qu’on ne sait comment dégager son unité.’13 The langue is an 

essential part of the langage, being ‘… à la fois un produit social de la faculté du langage 
                                                
6 Koskenniemi (n 3) 570-511. Koskenniemi also adds that ‘winning’ or ‘losing’ a case is more related to the 
biases and preferences of the institution before which the arguments are presented than to the worth of the 
arguments themselves.

et un ensemble de conventions nécessaires, adoptées par le corps social pour permettre 

l’exercice de cette faculté chez les individus.’14 According to Saussure, whilst the langue  

is social and essential, the parole is individual and accessory.15 Saussure provides the link 

between langue and parole when he indicates that the langue is a repository furnished 

through the practice of parole by the members of a community, ie it is a grammatical 

system that, although existing in each brain of a given community, exists perfectly only in 

the group considered as a whole.16 The langue is, in a way, presupposed when exercising 

the parole, which is ‘… un acte individuel de volonté et d’intelligence’, comprising ‘les 

combinaisons par lesquelles le sujet parlant utilise le code de la langue en vue d’exprimer 

sa pensée personnelle’ and ‘le mécanisme psycho-physique qui lui permet d’extérioriser 

ces combinaisons.’17 The relationship between the two is of interdependence: without the 

langue, one could not understand the parole, which would be deprived of effects; at the 

same time, without the parole, the langue could not have established itself in the first 

place.18  

Koskenniemi intended not to merely examine international law ‘like a language’, 

but to treat it ‘as a language’.19 According to him, this approach has the advantage of 

accounting for two very pronounced features of international legal argumentation: its sense 

of ‘rigorous formalism’ and its ‘substantive open-endedness’.20 Whilst there may be a 

myriad of possible solutions (which could also be referred as arguments or doctrines) to a 

given legal problem or dispute, if one wishes to be heard and to proficiently support a 

particular one, it is necessary to follow rigid patterns of argumentation accepted by the 

‘invisible college of international lawyers’, to use the expression of Oscar Schachter21. 

These arguments and doctrines are, in Saussurean terminology, the parole of international 

law. As in any other language, to be able to produce parole, it is necessary to know the 

langue––in Saussure’s words, ‘la langue … est la partie sociale du langage, extérieure à

l’individu, qui à lui seul ne peut ni créer ni la modifier … l’individu a besoin d’un 

apprentissage pour en connaître le jeu …’22.  

Through the process of learning the langue of international law, a structure, which 

constrains what can be said, is internalized, although one may not be aware of it.23 As 

Koskenniemi pointed out:  

 
‘At the parole level, human agents appear as conscious builders of the world. At the langue 

level they work within the possibilities offered by a historically given code which the actors 

are routinely unable to transgress. Analogously, … arguments and doctrines about international 

law are only a contingent surface of a socially shared manner of envisaging international 

relations. … [T]his cannot be a code which is somehow “inherent” in the contexts in which we 

use it. It has neither descended from heaven to determine what we can see in international life, 

nor emerged as an aprioristic construction of an autonomous individual.’24 

 

The core of Koskenniemi’s thesis is that international law is founded on a liberal 

theory of politics and reproduces the contradictions found therein. According to 

Koskenniemi, this theory assumes law’s objectivity, ie its dual character as simultaneously 

normative and concrete. Koskenniemi asserts that the grammar of international law is 

governed by these two elements: concreteness and normativity. The former expresses the 

understanding that law ‘emerges from the legal subjects’25; the latter, the understanding 

that law binds the legal subjects regardless of their wills26. In other words, there is a 

distinction between law-creation (the realm of subjectivity) and law-ascertainment (the 

realm of objectivity).27 Without concreteness, law would seem utopian, disconnected from 

reality––it would amount to ‘natural morality’.28 If normativity were lacking, law would 

seem apologist, incapable of providing a standard against which state behavior could be 

assessed.29

singularly useless as a means for justifying or criticizing international behavior’, is often misunderstood. See 
Koskenniemi (n 3) 600: 
 

‘Taken out of its context, this is wrong—for international law is constantly used to justify or 
criticize international behaviour. In the context where it appears, however, its point remains 
valid: although international law has justifying or critical force, that force is inexplicable by the 



196  

To Koskenniemi, concreteness and normativity are ultimately incompatible. 

Nonetheless, in order to maintain that international law cannot be reduced to neither ‘social 

description’ nor ‘political prescription’30, international lawyers have to show ‘law is 

simultaneously normative and concrete—that it binds a State regardless of that State’s 

behavior, will or interest but that its content can nevertheless be verified by reference to 

actual State behavior, will or interest.’31 Koskenniemi labeled this approach the ‘social 

conception of international law’. As defined by him: 

 
‘The social conception proceeds from an agnostic view on value and a functional notion of 

society. Its central problem is how to cope with the tension between the (arbitrary) values held 

by members of society and the need for order so as to sustain social life.  

‘… The difficulty now becomes how to extract ‘international law’ from other aspects of social 

life among States, i.e. how to distinguish between political and legal obligation, convenience 

and custom, violence and enforcement. Inasmuch as recourse to ideas about the good life is 

excluded, in making these distinctions, jurists have assumed this to be a technical or a 

pragmatic approach. Simultaneously, theory has been reduced to methodology: practical 

guidelines for isolating what is law and what is politics in what States do or say.’32 

 

The belief on law’s objectivity, which is the cornerstone of the social conception of 

law, was once taken to extremes, as demonstrated by the doctrine of the limitation of the 

judicial process, which, as described by Lauterpacht, contended that some disputes were 

not justiciable due to: (i) the non-existence of applicable rules of law; (ii) the subject-

matter of the dispute being related to important interests of states; (iii) the undesirability 

and the incompatibility with the demands of justice of the result of the application of the 

existing rules; (iv) the controversy being related to conflicts of interests and not disputes as 

to rights.33 In other words, the understanding underlying this doctrine is that some disputes 

are not justiciable if their content is, in one way or another, political.  

                                                                                                                                              
liberal political theory that is invoked as its foundation. If we take liberalism seriously, then 
international law can only seem an abysmal fraud.’

also Koskenniemi (n 3) 28-29 (footnotes omitted): 
 

‘The basic position about the objectivity of international law is clearest within the doctrines of 
the judicial function. Their identity as distinct doctrines depends on the way they explain the 
law-ascertainment job as more objective than the legislative one. 



197  

The embodiment of this doctrine in a treaty can be exemplified by the Locarno 

Pact. Article 3.2 of the Locarno Pact established that ‘[a]ny question with regard to which 

the Parties are in conflict as to it respective rights shall be submitted to judicial decision’, 

whilst Article 3.3 provided that ‘[a]ll other questions shall be submitted to a conciliation 

commission.’34 

Lauterpacht wrote one of his major works, The Function of Law in the 

International Community, precisely to counter this idea, which, according to him, was an 

attempt to conciliate sovereignty with the demands by the international community and 

public opinion in favor of treaties providing for the judicial settlement of disputes35––in his 

words, this doctrine was ‘first and foremost, the work of international lawyers anxious to 

give legal expression to the State’s claim to be independent of law.’36  

Being a natural lawyer who proposed that the ‘initial hypothesis’ of international 

law ought to be considered the ‘will of the international community’—voluntas civitatis 

maximae est servanda, as opposed to the traditional rule pacta sunt servanda37 —

Lauterpacht believed in the material completeness of international law: 
 

‘… [T]he necessary aim of any legal system is also material completeness. In order to achieve 

that material completeness the judge must consider not only the letter of the law, but also its 

spirit and purpose.  

‘… The conception of the completeness of the legal order is a beneficent notion inasmuch as it 

excludes the anarchical possibilities of a non liquet. But there is little doubt that this very 

notion may obstruct the path of the law by being used as a justification for the renunciation on 

the part of the judge of his power to apply the existing law in a just, creative, and scientific 

manner.’38 

  

                                                                                                                                              
‘The classic separation of justiciable from non-justiciable disputes is one manner of upholding 
this distinction. In late 19th and early 20th century doctrines it was largely assumed that the 
prevalence of subjective State interests in some disputes rendered them incapable of legal 
settlement or that trying to find a general rule with which to solve them was pointless as the 
subjective interests would in any case overrule any attempt at legal solution. It has, however, 
been impossible to make a clear distinction between these two types of disputes. …’

 Lauterpacht’s conception of international law allowed him to question the idea that 

the intrinsic character of some disputes had as a result their non-amenability to the rule of 

law—at the same time, his conception was still informed by the idea of objectivity.39 

In any case, Koskenniemi grounds his thesis on a completely different basis than 

that of Lauterpacht, namely on the idea that objectivity at the level of law-ascertainment is 

a myth. As Koskenniemi explains, his idea about the indeterminacy of international law 

does not relate to semantic ambiguity or ambivalence: 

 
‘… [E]ven where there is no semantic ambivalence whatsoever, international law remains 

indeterminate because it is based on contradictory premises and seeks to regulate a future in 

regard to which even single actors’ preferences remain unsettled. To say this is not to say much 

more than that international law emerges from a political process whose participants have 

contradictory priorities and rarely know with clarity how such priorities should be turned into 

directives to deal with an uncertain future. Hence they agree to supplement rules with 

exceptions, have recourse to broadly defined standards and apply rules in the context of other 

rules and larger principles. Even where there is little or no semantic ambiguity about an 

expression in a rule … that expression cannot quite have the normative force we would like it to 

have.’40 

 

This indeterminacy, which Koskenniemi in fact considers essential to international 

law’s acceptability, is, in his view, linked to the fact that, inasmuch as rules have to fulfill 

                                                
39 See Koskenniemi (n 3) 52-53 (footnotes omitted): 
 

‘For Lauterpacht, the legal system controls effectively all the outcomes of legal decision-
making. There is a positive duty on the judge (lawyer) to decide the cases brought to him, to 
determine the parties’ rights and duties. But exclusionary residual rules—such as the 
presumption of the freedom of the State—cannot suffice. Contrary to Kelsen, Lauterpacht does 
not postulate formal but material completeness of the law, constructed by the lawyer as he 
proceeds to solve the case. But this construction is neither arbitrary nor based on abstract 
principles of justice or derivations from the nature of the thing. It is more than an effort to 
ascertain community consensus or the actual background purposes. For Lauterpacht, legal 
problem-solution seeks to ensure the unity, consistency and effectiveness of international law 
as a whole. By using analogy and abstracting general principles from individual rules the 
lawyer will be able to perceive the law as a coherent, meaningful whole which “is originally 
and ultimately not so much a body of legal rules as a body of legal principles”. These 
principles express the law’s autonomous, systemic “coherence” which ultimately justifies the 
solution of hard cases.’

purposes that are conflicting among actors and not consistent throughout time, there is a 

risk that they will be over-inclusive and under-inclusive.41  

The point about the over-inclusiveness and under-inclusiveness of rules can 

perhaps be illustrated by the distinction Thomas Franck proposed between idiot and 

sophist rules. In Franck’s definition, idiot rules are characterized by their clarity, precision 

and transparency.42 They manifest what Franck calls a what-based normativity, in the 

sense that they are concerned with what was done.43 Sophist rules, on the other hand, are 

characterized by their ‘multi-layered complexity’ and their elasticity, as, for instance, 

‘[n]orms setting out standards of compliance which are measured in complex qualitative 

terms, or which are hedged by why and to whom exculpations, [and they] may be difficult 

to apply to real life situations.’44 The determinacy of a sophist rule will depend ‘… on the 

degree of common community understanding of the rule’s complex content and … on the 

perceived legitimacy of the process by which the rule is applied.’45 As regards application, 

Thomas Franck considers that ‘[w]hile an idiot rule more-or-less applies itself, sophist 

rules usually require an effective, credible, institutionalized, and legitimate interpreter of 

the rule’s meaning in various instances.’46 As Franck puts it, however, it is not the case that 

idiot rules will always be more determinate than sophist rules—the precision of an idiot 

rule may have the effect of actually undermining its determinacy. Franck explains this 

situation in the following way: 

 
‘…[C]larity, while often an indicator of determinacy, may occasionally produce results which 

are so at variance with common sense that the clear meaning of the rule is rejected by those 

whose conduct the rule is intended to govern. A rule which appears to be perfectly clear 

unintentionally may command what turns out to be an absurdity. Indeed, the simpler, clearer, and 

                                                
41 Koskenniemi (n 3) 591-592. Koskenniemi explains that the force of rules is undermined because of issues 
related to their over-inclusiveness and under-inclusiveness, and, as a consequence, ‘discretion’ is encouraged. 
See Koskenniemi (n 3) 591-592: 
  

‘… The rules will include future cases we would not like to include and exclude cases that we 
would have wanted to include had we known of them when the rules were drafted. This 
fundamentally—and not just marginally—undermines their force. It compels the move to 
“discretion” which it was the very purpose to avoid by adopting the rule-format in the first 
place.’

46 ibid 81.

more straightforward a rule is, the greater is its propensity to produce an unintended absurdity, 

usually in unforeseen circumstances. 

‘… [D]espite its superficial clarity, the [idiot] rule—under certain circumstances—does not 

satisfy the test of common sense or fairness; and thus, deprived of the compliance pull its clear 

standard was meant to assure, the rule also will not accurately predict the actual conduct of 

states. This is because a literal reading of the rule can lead to absurd results at the margins of its 

application.’47 

 

 Franck utilizes Articles 2.4 and 51 of the UN Charter to exemplify an international 

idiot rule. Article 2.4 establishes the general prohibition of the use of force, whilst Article 

51 preserves a state’s inherent right of self-defense. Prima facie, the rule according to 

which a state cannot initiate the use of force, but only respond to an actual armed attack is 

highly determinate. However, as Franck points out, 

 
‘… a literal reading of the rule can lead to absurd results at the margins of its application. For 

example it would compel a state threatened by a nuclear attack to wait until it had actually been 

hit (“armed attack”) before permitting the use of force in self-defense. In less dramatic 

circumstances, the rule would require even a state like Israel or Singapore to wait until after an 

armed attack before striking back, by which time its minute territory might well have been 

overrun. Such a rule lacks essential legitimacy, because it is evidently absurd. It is easy to 

predict that no state would abide by its strictures in at least some situations, as Israel 

demonstrated by destroying the Iraqi nuclear reactor in an air raid … [T]he clear meaning of the 

rule is not determinate because the members of the community to which it applies have already 

decided that, in at least some circumstances, the rule cannot mean what it says.’48 

  

 At the domestic level, the problems relating to idiot and sophist rules are usually 

dealt with by courts, which may refuse to apply idiot rules in a literal manner if it leads to 

absurd results and may clarify the content of elastic sophist rules.49 It is then expected that, 

in international law, the problems related to idiot and sophist rules will be more acutely 

felt, due to the lack of international compulsory jurisdiction.  

 The nature of international law’s indeterminacy, in Koskenniemi’s view, is not then 

related to the lack of clarity of legal norms—indeed, Franck demonstrated that the clarity 

of a legal rule may even contribute to its indeterminateness. As Koskenniemi explains, 

 

                                                
47 Franck (n 42) 68 and 76. 
48 ibid 76. 
49 ibid 78-79 and 82-83. 



201  

‘[t]here is nothing necessarily unclear about “if an armed attack occurs” or “territorial 

inviolability” or “right to life”. The indeterminacy is about the relationship of those expressions 

to their underlying reasons and to other rules and principles that makes it sometimes seem 

necessary to deviate from a formally unambiguous provision in view of new information or a 

new circumstance, to sacrifice a smaller good (abstract legality) in view of realizing a larger one. 

‘… 

‘… [E]ven a “literal” application is always a choice that is undetermined by literality itself. 

There is no space in international law that would be “free” from decisionism, no aspect of the 

legal craft that would not involve a “choice”—that would not be, in this sense, a politics of 

international law.’50 

  

 To pick up on a point raised in the beginning of this section, indeterminacy does 

not mean that a judicial decision is random or unpredictable or that ‘anything goes’. 

International law has an inter-subjective dimension: doctrines can attain professional 

consensus and some theoretical trends may be more widespread among the professional 

community than others. And, as pointed out by Koskenniemi, structural biases play a 

crucial role. As he highlights, ‘the system still de facto prefers some outcomes or 

distributive choices to other outcomes or choices.’51  

Koskenniemi’s thesis about the indeterminacy of international law highlights the 

fact that there is nothing inherent about current preferred outcomes. They remain 

contingent and can be contested through the language of international law: 

 
‘… [T]he fluidity of international law does not deny the fact that there exists at any one time a 

professional consensus or a mainstream answer to any particular problem. Although, logically 

speaking, all positions remain open and contrasting arguments may be reproduced at will, in 

practice it is easy to identify areas of relative stability, moments where a mainstream has 

consolidated or is only marginally threatened by critique. Professional competence in 

international law is precisely about being able to identify the hegemonic and counter-hegemonic 

narratives and to list one’s services in favour of one or the other.’52

5.2 The debate on the relationship between state immunity and human rights as a 

conflict of conceptions of international law  

 

5.2.1 The role of theory 

 

In analyzing the various cases dealing with the relationship between state immunity 

and human rights, courts had to answer a multitude of questions. Is state immunity a rule 

of customary international law? Or is it only an expression of comity? Is it underpinned by 

the principle of sovereign equality and a consequence of the maxim par in parem non 

habet imperium? Or is it an exception to the principle of adjudicatory jurisdiction? Is state 

immunity functional and should it only be accorded when it promotes the interests of the 

community of states? Can gross violations of international humanitarian law and of 

international human rights law be considered acta jure imperii? Or are they delicta imperii 

that do not fit the dichotomy between acta jure imperii and acta jure gestionis? Is there a 

tort exception to state immunity under customary international law? If so, does it allow 

piercing the veil of state immunity for acta jure imperii and for acts committed by armed 

forces in the territory of the forum state? Does a state tacitly waive its right to immunity by 

violating a jus cogens norm? Or no such waiver can be implied from this act? Do jus 

cogens norms have a substantive nature that does not affect the operation of procedural 

norms? Or is the distinction between procedural and substantive norms immaterial to the 

concept of jus cogens? Are the effects of jus cogens limited to restricting the contractual 

liberty of states? Do jus cogens norms take primacy over other norms of international law 

when there is a material, but not a formal, conflict between them? Is the grant of state 

immunity in cases involving gross violations of human rights outside the jurisdiction of the 

forum state a violation of the individual’s right of access to justice? Or is it a lawful 

limitation of this right because it is a measure which reflects generally recognized rules of 

public international law and which pursues the legitimate aim of promoting good relations 

between states? Are states required under Article 14 of the CAT to provide a remedy for 

acts of torture committed outside the forum state? Or are they required only to provide a 

remedy for acts of torture committed in the forum state? Does Article 3 of the Hague 

Convention (IV) of 1907 confer a right to reparation to individuals? Or are the effects of 

this provision limited to inter-state relations? Can the ascertainment of customary 

international law be limited to a quantitative approach? Or is it a qualitative approach 

required?  



203  

These are all questions underlying the many cases previously analyzed. And 

different answers were offered to them by the various courts. The argument of this 

monograph is that the answers to these technical and dogmatic questions hide conflicts that 

exist—to use Martti Koskenniemi’s expression—at a ‘higher level of abstraction’.53 They 

hide conflicts about different conceptions of international law, ie about what international 

law is and about how to find it out. The aforementioned questions do not have answers that 

can be ascertained objectively. Different theoretical assumptions can lead to conflicting 

answers. And a given preferred outcome or decision is contingent and remains open to 

contestation. Oscar Schachter, for instance, in an article in which he tried to come up with 

a ‘more adequate theory’ of the basis of obligation in international law given the 

emergence of new normative processes which could not easily fit in the categories of treaty 

and customary law, listed  

 
‘… at least a baker’s dozen of  “candidates” … : (i) Consent of States; (ii) Customary practice; 

(iii) A sense of “rightness”––the juridical conscience; (iv) Natural law or natural reason; (v) 

Social necessity; (vi) The will of the international community (the “consensus of the 

international community”); (vii) Direct (or “stigmatic”) intuition; (viii) Common purposes of 

participants; (ix) Effectiveness; (x) Sanctions; (xi) “Systemic” goals; (xii) Shared expectations as 

to authority; (xiii) Rules of recognition …’54 

 

 It is not within the purposes of this monograph to dwell upon Schachter’s own 

proposal, a task for which he relied on the works of Harold Lasswell and Myres 

McDougal, but I share his view that these foundational issues matter because they have 

practical significance and are important to the outcome of concrete controversies.55  

Although in the cases surveyed some of the courts engaged in, to use Philippa 

Webb’s expression, a ‘high level of judicial dialogue’56, inasmuch as they cited and 

discussed other courts’ decisions, sometimes it felt like they were talking past one another, 

due to the adoption of different theoretical premises. As Koskenniemi highlighted:

204  

‘Whether the difficulty regards the sense of “rules” or the meaning of “facts”, the problem is that 

the theories and intuitions which may justify differing constructions are, by definition, external 

to the rules of facts themselves and do not, therefore, lend themselves to a discussion within the 

social conception [of law]. Nevertheless, the practical need for action compels the practitioner 

into a justification that at least addresses the normative claims which underlie the particular 

controversy and the differing views that exist for its solution, and establishes some kind of a 

reasoned balance or priority between them.  

‘It is an illusion to believe that there could be a “theory” or “method” which could solve such 

interpretative problems in a final way. States will continue to disagree about applicable law and 

its correct interpretation. This is not a result of the law’s poor quality of the statesman’s bad 

faith. Law carries political struggle within itself by receiving meaning only in frameworks of 

interpretation that reflect political priorities. The practitioners will continue to have some 

difficulty in coping with this fact. But the persistence of interpretative controversy is not really a 

“problem” to be solved by a better theory of method—it is the fundamental condition which 

defines what international legal practice is about.’57 

 

Despite having such a great influence, theoretical assumptions are usually 

embedded in an implicit way in the discourses found in legal texts. This happens because 

‘reification’—which could be defined as ‘… an attempt to deny both “contingency” and 

choice by incorporating some political decision about a subject into the description of that 

subject’58 or as ‘the way we turn other people, or social systems, or institutional hierarchies 

into objects which we then confront as disempowered observers’59—is pervasive in the 

practice of international legal argumentation. In other words, the authoritativeness of a 

technical, dogmatic argument is founded on the assumption that it derives from sound, 

unquestionable and neutral theoretical premises about the nature of international law. And, 

as a matter of fact, these theoretical premises incorporate choices. As James Boyle argued: 

 
‘Doctrinal scholarship often appears to be an attempt to show that rules can achieve determinacy, 

to show that there are correct interpretations of international legal norms. My claim is that this 

attempt is only explicable as the objectified manifestation of a different, more contentious 

political project. International lawyers are not attempting to show that rules are definite, firm and 

predictable because they believe this exercise will be good for their health. Their aspiration is to 

show that international law is a legitimate system for constraining power and irrationality, and,

59 ibid 352. 



205  

in their minds, they carry the assumption that it could only be such a system if there are neutral, 

objective answers to legal questions. 

‘… The dominant background conception of “reason,” self-interest and politics—and the utopian 

vision of power constrained by rules that is generated within that conception—seem to require a 

set of a-political rules. Since the mark of a neutral set of rules is their ability to provide one 

logically correct answer to each case, both the compulsive denial of contradiction and the 

doctrinal structure that this denial “generates” can be seen as products of the initial reification—

the attempt to define “what law is,” in order to separate it conceptually from morals and political 

argument.’60 

 

There is nothing inherently right or wrong about the answers provided by the 

various courts on the questions relating to the relationship between state immunity and 

human rights. The answers offered will have varying degrees of persuasiveness that 

depend not only on their intrinsic attributes, like internal coherence, but also on the 

audience (eg, the acceptability by the audience of the premises of a given answer to a legal 

question, the biases of the audience etc.).61 

 

5.2.2 Consensus and dissension, law-breaking and law-making 

 

In the case of state immunity, most courts adopted what could be called an 

orthodox, textbook approach to state immunity. They saw state immunity as underpinned 

by the principle of sovereign equality of states and as an expression of the Latin maxim 

par in parem non habet imperium. A distinction between procedure and substance was 

employed in order to preclude the effects of (substantive) jus cogens norms in the realm of 

(procedural) state immunity. Also, most courts adopted state immunity as the starting point 

of analysis—an exception in respect of human rights and jus cogens violations had thus to 

be found in the practice of states. And, as considered previously, this type of analysis gave 

rise to what Roger O’Keefe called a ‘customary international legal feedback loop’62, which 

was well received by the ICJ. Through its quantitative approach to customary international 

law, the ICJ may have crystallized the consensus according to which state immunity 

trumps the individual’s right to reparation arising out of serious violations of human rights.

206  

Nevertheless, many dissenting voices emerged. In the Princz case, the decision of 

District Judge Sporkin and the dissenting opinion of Judge Wald. In Greece, Judgment No 

137/1997 of the Multi-Member Court of Levadia, Judgment No 11/2000 of the Areios 

Pagos, and the dissenting opinion appended to the judgment of the Special Supreme Court 

in Germany v Margellos and Other. In the ECtHR, the dissenting opinions appended to Al-

Adsani and Jones. Judge Cançado Trindade appended a dissenting opinion to the judgment 

of the ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State in which he disagreed with the 

reasoning adopted by the ICJ as a whole. Cançado Trindade made his jusnaturalist 

perspective clear. In his view, the ultimate material source of law is the ‘universal juridical 

conscience’ and the inter-state outlook of international law is something that ought to be 

overcome. Cançado Trindade, so to speak, found that international law had a different 

Grundnorm and reached conclusions which were in stark opposition to those of the 

majority of the ICJ.63  

The case-law of the Italian Court of Cassation is the one that stood out the most. It 

adopted an entirely different approach as regards the role of domestic courts in the 

application of international law.64 The Italian Court of Cassation took on an active role and 

emphasized its self-awareness by stating that it was conscious that it was contributing to 

the emergence of further restrictions to the scope of state immunity.  

George Scelle’s theory of role splitting (‘la loi du dédoublement fonctionnel’) can 

perhaps shed light on the attitude of the Italian courts. Scelle, in the course he taught at the 

Hague Academy in 1933, explained what he called the ‘loi du dédoublement fonctionnel’ 

in the following terms:  

 
‘... [i]l en résulte que, dans l’ordre interétatique, où il n’existe pas de gouvernants et agents 

spécifiquement internationaux, les agents et gouvernants étatiques qui les remplacent sont 

investis d’un double rôle. Ils sont agents et gouvernants nationaux lorsqu’ils fonctionnent dans 

l’ordre juridique étatique; ils sont agents et gouvernants internationaux lorsqu’ils agissent dans 

l’ordre juridique international. C’est ce que nous appellerons la loi fondamentale du 

dédoublement fonctionnel. 

                                                
63 See Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece Intervening) (Dissenting Opinion of 
Judge Cançado Trindade) [2012] ICJ Rep 99 and Rosalyn Higgins, ‘Equality of States and Immunity from 
Suit: A Complex Relationship’ (2015) 43 NYIL 129, 146-148.  
64 See Rosanne van Alebeek, ‘Domestic Courts as Agents of Development of International Immunity Rules’ 
(2013) 26(3) LJIL 559 and Anthea Roberts, ‘Comparative International Law? The Role of National Courts in 
Creating and Enforcing International Law’ (2011) 60 ICLQ 57. Both authors assessed the different 
approaches domestic courts adopted with regard to the development of the law of state immunity. The 
perspectives they presented on the subject are very distinct from each other. 



207  

‘… [U]n acte n’a d’autre critère juridique que sa substance, et toutes les fois que nous nous 

trouvons en face d’un rapport et d’une situation internationale, il en résulte mathématiquement 

que l’acte juridique qui lui donne naissance est par nature un acte international.’65 

 

According to Scelle’s theory, when a domestic court delivers a decision on 

international law issues, it is acting qua an international organ because it is operating 

within the international legal system.66  

Furthermore, the attitude of the Italian courts may be better understood in the light 

of some aspects of the process of changes in international law, in which the frontiers 

between deviance, law-development and law-creation are not very clear. As put by John 

Merrills, in international law, law-breaking can sometimes be a method of law-making: 

 
‘Since customary international law is based on usage, the making of new claims always has the 

effect of weakening the established rule. If such claims are accepted, or become sufficiently 

widespread, that rule will change. Until that point is reached there is no doubt that the 

enforcement of a disputed claim involves a breach of a legal obligation. That international law 

can change quite rapidly even on highly controversial matters is illustrated by the emergence, 

against strong opposition, of the concept of the Exclusive Economic Zone. As that experience 

shows, however, when breaking law is an important method of law making conflict and 

controversy are unavoidable.  

‘... [S]ince international law is a reflection of the way states view the world, law cannot be 

made when, as often is the case, their interests are in sharp conflict. When state’s interests 

change established principles come under challenge. In such a situation only state practice can 

change the law and there will be controversy until new law emerges from the cauldron of claim 

                                                
65 George Scelle, ‘Règles générales du droit de la paix’ (1933) 46 RCADI 327. Cassese wrote an excellent 
analysis of Scelle’s ‘loi du dédoublement fonctionnel’. See Antonio Cassese, ‘Remarks on Scelle’s Theory of 
“Role Splitting” (dédoublement fonctionnel) in International Law’ (1990) 1(1) EJIL 210. 
66 From a formal perspective, James Crawford argued Scelle’s theory fails because international law does not 
confer on domestic courts a mandate to act as international law ‘agencies’. See James Crawford, ‘Chance, 
Order, Change: The Course of International Law’ (2013) 365 RCADI 13, 168 and 180: 
 

‘It is true that courts sometimes use language consistent with dédoublement fonctionnel. In 
Eichmann the Supreme Court of Israel stated that “in the capacity of a guardian of international 
law and an agent for its enforcement”, Israel was entitled to prosecute crimes that “shake the 
international community to its very foundations”. Similar assertions of guardianship were 
made by the US federal courts in Filártiga and Yunis ... 
‘But these assertions were not only equivocal; they were effectively self-judging. There was no 
specific international mandate in either case, such as the clear authority to exercise jurisdiction 
in various suppression treaties such as the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of 
Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Article 5. 
‘… As we have seen, Scelle’s theory of the dédoublement fonctionnel fails at a general level 
for want of any mandate from international law to domestic organs, notably courts, requiring 
them to act as international agencies.’

and counter-claim. In that convulsive process the tendency of states to regard as legally 

permitted any claim successfully asserted by any state in the past invests even individual states 

acts with a powerful law creating potential. 

‘With the creation of international law such a decentralised process, so liable for the reasons 

described to give rise to doubt or controversy, much clearly depends on the possibility of 

obtaining authoritative interpretations of the law …’67 

 

The Italian Court of Cassation assumed an active role and it can be argued that it 

sought to engage in dédoublement fonctionnel. The Court did so in an ingenious manner. 

The Court of Cassation’s dédoublement fonctionnel was ‘colored’ by an attempt to further 

develop the law of state immunity.68 Perhaps to avoid the accusation it was breaking 

                                                
67 John Merrills, Anatomy of International Law (2nd edn, Sweet &amp;amp; Maxwell 1981) 14-15. It might be added 
Anthea Roberts asserted that, in international law, domestic courts have a legitimate role as law-creators, 
which can be formally justified on the doctrine of sources. See Roberts (n 64) 62-63 and 70-71 (footnotes 
omitted): 
 

‘National court decisions play a distinctive dual role in the doctrine of sources: as evidence of 
State practice, relevant to the interpretation of treaties and the formation of custom (where 
domestic judgments play a role in law creation), and as a subsidiary means of determining the 
existence and content of international law (where domestic judgments can be characterized as 
law enforcement). The resulting Janus-faced nature of domestic court decisions gives rise to 
conflicting approaches about their purpose and value. 
‘… 
‘Judicial decisions of international courts provide a subsidiary means of determining 
international law only. National court decisions alone have the potential to wear both hats and 
thus their value is often considered to be mixed … 
‘… 
‘Domestic court decisions—like other forms of State practice emanating from legislatures and 
executives—can constitute breaches just as they can be evidence of emulation and 
acquiescence. To argue otherwise, and to limit the role of national courts to impartial law 
enforcement only, is to deny their potential role in developing international law and to accord 
greater power in this regard to legislatures and executives.’ 

 
Rosanne van Alebeek criticized Roberts’ argument. See Alebeek (n 64) 54. 
68  See Alebeek (n 64) 572-574 and 577-78; Roberts (n 64) 68-71. Alebeek explains that Scelle’s 
dédoublement fonctionnel ‘… arguably … provides above all a normative framework’ in the sense that, as a 
matter of international law, domestic courts are expected to be faithful to international law as it stands and 
should not have a domestic perspective on it. In this point of view, the position adopted by the Italian Court 
of Cassation in cases like Ferrini could be interpreted as a departure from dédoublement fonctionnel if it its 
understood that the Court violated international law. The Italian Court of Cassation, however, did not affirm 
that it was breaking international law, but rather that it was contributing to the emergence of further 
restrictions to state immunity that were already implicit in international law. The Court tried to frame its 
attitude as an exercise of development. Roberts argued that the Italian Court of Cassation in Ferrini fulfilled 
a ‘… “legitimate” function in pushing for a new interpretation of international law based on its role as a law 
creator rather than enforcer’ and contended that ‘[c]ustomary international law is made on the back of State 
practice, including court decisions, and custom is changed through breaches of existing rules, coupled with 
emulation or acquiescence.’ Alebeek criticized this perspective, claiming that it advances a ‘… completely 
novel take on the “role splitting of domestic courts”’, in which, rather than a splitting between the domestic 
and the international legal order, there is a splitting, within the international legal order, between law creation 
and law enforcement. Alebeek added that ‘[t]he process of change of custom through violation … is in any 
case not an instrument that fits the judicial toolbox.’ Another point raised by Alebeek was that the 
importance of domestic decisions to custom formation is based on the ‘… strong assumption that these 



209  

international law, the Court of Cassation alleged that the restrictions it had found in the law 

of state immunity were already implicit in international law.69 In order to find out what 

was already implicit in international law, the Court of Cassation adopted an approach to 

custom ascertainment that radically differed from that of the other courts.  

The Court of Cassation recognized the existence of an antinomy between two 

principles of international law—state immunity and the protection of inviolable human 

rights—and asserted there was a qualitative difference between norms of customary 

international law.70 In the Court of Cassation’s view, unlike the norms relating to state 

immunity, the norms relating to the protection of fundamental human rights belong to the 

body of jus cogens norms and take precedence over other norms of international law.71 It 

should follow that a state cannot hide behind the shield of state immunity when it violated 

peremptory norms of international law. Given the existence of an antinomy between 

norms, the Court of Cassation considered it had to coordinate them on the systematic level 

by making a value-oriented choice.72 By means of this coordination and on the basis of the 

criterion of balancing of interests, the Court of Cassation concluded that it had to give 

priority to the higher ranked norms. It may be said that underlying the Court of Cassation’s 

reasoning was the idea that legal norms are not in a vacuum—indeed, the Court of 

Cassation asserted that legal norms cannot be interpreted separately from one another, and 

that jus cogens norms affected the scope of norms relating to state immunity.73 Not only 

that, but on the logical level, the Court of Cassation considered it would not make sense to 

proclaim the primacy of certain norms and then to deprive individuals from having access 

to a remedy to make them effective.74  

The Court of Cassation criticized what it labeled a quantitative approach to 

customary international law. 75 The Court considered that the practice of the various 

                                                                                                                                              
decisions accurately reflect international law.’ Nevertheless, Alebeek conceded that ‘[s]ince every 
application of a legal rule entails interpretation, and hence development, domestic courts have the ability to 
act as agents of change of international immunity rules.’ As the Italian Court of Cassation showed, it is 
doubtful whether a distinction between law-development and law-creation can be rigorously maintained.

domestic courts was important, but it highlighted that, in its view, the ascertainment of 

customary international law could not be limited to arithmetically counting decisions in 

favor and against a certain position. This approach would be reductive of the role played 

by the interpreter, who should take account, as regards customary international law norms, 

‘delle consistenza qualitativa di esse, delle interrelazioni riscontrabili tra le stesse, 

dell’operatività dei nessi di interdipendenza e di collocazione gerarchica operanti in diretta 

funzione del rango attribuito a ciascuna di quelle norme rispetto alla scala dei valori 

generalmente accolta dall’ordinamento internazionale.’76  

Furthermore, in Germany v Prefecture of Vojotia, the Court of Cassation coupled 

the perspective on the relationship between state immunity and human rights based on a 

qualitative assessment of customary international law—which was developed in the 

Ferrini, Milde and Mantelli cases—with a functional approach to state immunity.77 In 

Judgment No 238/2014, in the light of the ICJ’s judgment, the Court of Cassation shifted 

the focus from international jus cogens to domestic jus cogens and declared provisions of 

Italian law which were adopted to implement the ruling of the ICJ in Jurisdictional 

Immunities of the State as incompatible with the Italian Constitution.78 If in cases like 

Ferrini, Mantelli and Milde the Court of Cassation actively applied international law and 

consciously acted as an agent of the development of international law, in Judgment No 

238/2014 the Court of Cassation considered the pronouncement of the ICJ in Jurisdictional 

Immunities of the State was authoritative as a matter of international law. At the same time, 

                                                                                                                                              
‘… it is virtually impossible to accurately assess the customary status of almost any norm 
given the number of States, the myriad forms of State practice, the existence of language 
barriers, and disputes about what counts as State practice and opinio juris. The result is that 
many actors, including international courts, routinely assert the existence of custom based on a 
handful of examples of State practice, with contrary practice being discounted as a breach and 
the absence of other practice being explained through concepts such as acquiescence. 
‘… 
‘If a comparative survey produces cases that the decision maker likes, the temptation will be to 
characterize these judgments as impartial evidence of the existence or meaning of international 
law. If the survey produces cases that the decision maker dislikes, these decisions are likely to 
be discounted as unpersuasive on the basis that they reflect the practice of only a few States.’

the Court of Cassation rebelled against it by adopting a dualistic position in respect of the 

relationship between domestic and international law, and remained hopeful that its position 

could contribute to future changes in international law.79  

In contrast, the ICJ and most other courts adopted a different methodology to 

custom ascertainment. Instead of acknowledging the existence of a conflict between 

existing customary international law norms which had to be solved by coordinating and 

balancing them, they sought to find whether state practice supported or not the removal of 

immunity in cases of gross violations of human rights. This approach effectively killed any 

possibility of adding this further restriction to state immunity and perpetuated the 

aforementioned ‘customary international legal feedback loop’. There was also a lack of 

nuance in this formalist exercise. Most courts merely took note of legislations and of the 

outcomes of judicial decisions of other states, without evaluating context. The ICJ, for 

instance, did not properly take into consideration that the courts of most common law 

countries, having statutes codifying rules relating to state immunity, did not rely directly 

on international law to reach their conclusions.  

The criticisms directed at the Italian Court of Cassation reveal the adoption of a 

manifestly voluntarist model of international legal rationality. As seen in chapter 3, Lord 

Hoffmann argued that the technique of balancing interests, which had been employed by 

the Italian Court of Cassation, could not be adopted in international law because that would 

mean unilaterally developing it, and that, according to him, would run counter to ‘the 

common consent of nations’, upon which international law is founded.80 Similarly, the ICJ 

asserted that state immunity, being a right of the foreign state, could not ‘… be made 

dependent upon the outcome of a balancing exercise of the specific circumstances of each 

case to be conducted by the national court before which immunity is claimed.’81  

                                                
79 Judgment No 238/2014 (n 78): 
 

‘Ad essa [Corte] spetta in via esclusiva il compito di assicurare il rispetto della Costituzione ed 
a maggior ragione dei suoi principi fondamentali e quindi la necessaria valutazione della 
compatibilità della norma internazionale sull’immunità degli Stati dalla giurisdizione civile 
degli altri Stati con i predetti principi, con l’effetto di produrre un ulteriore ridimensionamento 
della portata della predetta norma, limitato al diritto interno ma tale da concorrere, altresì, ad 
un’auspicabile e da più parti auspicata evoluzione dello stesso diritto internazionale.’

212  

 Upon the analysis of the various cases, it is clear that the methodology adopted by 

the courts for the ascertainment of customary international law, which created and 

perpetuated a loop, contributed to what Higgins called ‘the disturbing ethical dilemma 

presented by the law of State immunity’82.  

To my knowledge, thus far, the Italian courts were the only domestic courts to react 

to the judgment of the ICJ. In the Jones case, the ECtHR confirmed its previous case-law 

and relied on the judgment of the ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State to do so. 

The ECtHR mentioned it considered the ICJ’s judgment ‘authoritative as regards the 

content of customary international law’.83 The ECtHR thus concluded no jus cogens 

exception to state immunity had crystallized.  As Judge Cançado Trindade anticipated, it 

seems that the ICJ’s judgment in Jurisdictional Immunities of State indeed has contributed 

to the stagnation of the law of state immunity.  

 

5.2.3 A victory for formalism?  

  

As regards the relationship between state immunity and human rights, the cases 

studied showed the prevalence of formalism, of sovereign equality as the principle 

governing the outcome of the judicial decisions, and of a voluntarist rationality in the 

ascertainment of customary international law.   

Lorna McGregor captured how the use of the language of international law deflects 

attention from the real underlying problems and argued that the neutrality of state 

immunity is a myth: 

 
‘The formal division between procedural and substantive norms as parallel but distinct regimes 

provides plausible legal language to justify the provision of immunity without directly rejecting 

the prohibition of torture. In the same sentence, states and judicial bodies can reaffirm their 

commitment to the prohibition of torture and claim, through the neutralizing rhetoric of the law 

of procedure, that immunity sits compatibly with the prohibition of torture by not interacting 

with it at all. Equally, however, attempts to deny the impact of other procedural rules on the 

prohibition of torture have been exposed and rejected.  

                                                
82  Higgins (n 63) 142. Interestingly, when analyzing the availability of state immunity in cases of 
perpetration of heinous international crimes and of violations of jus cogens norms, Higgins considered that 
‘… the arguments of logic do not in fact seem to be insurmountable: it is really the will of States to develop 
the law, rather than principles of logic, which is pro tem the insurmountable hurdle.’ See Higgins (n 63) 141. 
83 Jones and others v United Kingdom [Fourth Section] (Application Nos 34356/06 and 40528/06) (Merits: 
Judgment) (2014)&amp;lt;http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-140005&gt; accessed 26 November 2015, [198]. 



213  

‘… By framing immunity as a procedural rule, the pretence of neutrality acts to steer attention 

away from the deeper question of the legitimacy of immunity when torture is alleged … [T]he 

focus on procedure sanitizes immunity, thus legitimizing and denying the impact of immunity on 

impunity … Once the mythology of the neutrality of immunity is exposed, immunity no longer 

presents itself as simply a procedural rule, but a barrier tantamount to the acceptance of torture; 

an acceptance which cannot co-exist with rejection of its prohibition. As such, procedural rules 

cannot be used to evade substantive obligations, as this would defeat the core basis for jus 

cogens norms such as the prohibition of torture, by facilitating unlawful derogation.’84 

  

In the same vein, Lorna McGregor also pointed out that the rhetoric of immunity is 

based on an idea about the scope of sovereignty that simply does not correspond to its 

current status—in her words, there has been a ‘disjuncture’ between sovereignty and 

immunity: 

 
‘If immunity derives from sovereignty, its meaning, extent, and impact must also be contingent 

on the current scope of sovereignty. Yet, by simply restating the origins of immunity in 

sovereignty, courts have failed to acknowledge the restrictions on the scope of immunity caused 

by the evolution of sovereignty over time. As such, judicial decisions in which a state pleads 

immunity against allegations of torture result in an inevitable clash between the principles of 

1648 and those of today. To tie immunity to the 1648 meaning of sovereignty positions the 

sovereign above the law. As a consequence, immunity renders the prohibition of torture impotent 

and also frees sovereignty from its own constitutive framework in international law. As with the 

division between procedural and substantive rules, the masked reliance on a Westphalian 

sovereignty would accord states the effective freedom to avoid accountability for a crime such as 

torture, while advancing a rhetorical commitment to its prohibition. 

‘… [B]y simply referring to sovereignty as if amorphous, abstract, and temporally detached, a 

Westphalian sovereignty is injected, enabling states to stand outside the law while framing the 

decision within the confines of the law.’85 

 

                                                
84 Lorna McGregor, ‘Torture and State Immunity: Deflecting Impunity, Distorting Sovereignty’ (2008) 18(5) 
EJIL 903, 911 (footnotes omitted). As remarked by Roberts, who referred specifically to the application of 
international law by domestic courts, the rhetoric of neutrality employed by courts can disguise attempts of 
progressive development as well as justify inaction. See Roberts (n 64) 71-72: 
 

‘In some cases, national courts embrace the vision of themselves as impartial law enforcers as 
a cloak to disguise their progressive development of the law. In others, domestic courts cling to 
this role as a shield to justify inaction and deflect criticism for not developing the law. In this 
way, the mantra of impartial law enforcement may serve to obscure the real actions or 
motivations of domestic courts.’ 
 

85 McGregor (n 84) 916-918 (footnotes omitted). 



214  

Nevertheless, these rhetorical strategies—a rigorous formalism, as seen in the stark 

division between procedural and substantive norms, the employment of an amorphous and 

hazy concept of sovereignty, and, it might be added, a quantitative methodology for the 

ascertainment of customary international law—have been successful, as demonstrated by 

the ‘customary international legal feedback loop’, which was picked up by the ICJ.  

As pointed out by Andrea Bianchi, the judgment delivered by the ICJ was 

‘perfectly attuned’ to its audience, namely states, or, more specifically, individuals who ‘in 

their professional capacity depend heavily on the inter-state system.’86 Bianchi’s analysis 

is grounded on the perspective of the relationship between the speaker (ie, the Court) and 

the audience (ie, states). This framework of analysis clarifies why the ICJ’s ruling was 

rhetorically effective. The adoption of alternative views by the ICJ might have been not 

only unsuitable for the audience, but also might have put at risk the legitimacy of the 

Court. In a commentary to the dissenting opinions attached to the ICJ’s judgment 

(particularly that of Judge Cançado Trindade), Bianchi highlighted the following: 

 
‘To adopt, as normative background, the protection of individuals and, therefore, the 

fundamental principles of human rights and humanitarian law will not make inroads on the views 

of those who look at the state as the main hinge upon which the whole international legal system 

revolves. It would be naïve to think that this way of thinking may be adopted by judges whose 

overwhelming majority acted in their prior professional experience as state’s or international 

organization’s advisers. 

‘… To appeal to values other than those traditionally upheld in the state-centred view of 

international law—the principle of sovereign equality being a good case in point!—can be 

counter-productive in a context such as that of the ICJ. 

‘… The passion and the sense of commitment to such a noble (and yet value-laden in the 

perception of the traditional approach to international law!) cause as the protection of human 

rights are not favourably received in an intellectual and professional milieu, which is more 

inclined to give weight to apparently value-free and objective standards such as the rules that 

they themselves are supposed to find in international law and that—what a coincidence!—tend 

to provide support to the current status quo and power structures of the international legal 

system.’87 

 

 It may be added that, in this case, the position adopted by the ICJ was also 

legitimized by the previous rulings of the domestic courts, which acted mostly as 

                                                
86 Bianchi (n 61) 467-468. 
87 ibid 472 (footnotes omitted). 



215  

‘objective’ or ‘impartial’ enforcers of international law. 88  Deflection from the norm 

according to which immunity should be granted even in claims arising out of gross 

violations of human rights will be even more difficult after the judgment of the ICJ.  

In an article written before the ICJ’s judgment, Roger O’Keefe asserted there was 

no ‘knock-down argument’ which could be marshaled in support of the circumvention of 

state immunity in human rights cases. 89  Within the current prevailing state-centered 

outlook of international law, that is indeed the case. Furthermore, the authority attached to 

rulings of the ICJ—in the expression of Jennings, there is the tendency of courts and 

writers ‘… to cite isolated passages from judgments, almost as if they were passages from 

Holy Writ’90—is an almost insurmountable obstacle to the success of a future generalized 

acceptance of a restriction to state immunity in respect of violations of human rights. The 

strategy adopted by the Italian Court of Cassation in Judgment No 238/2014 is very telling 

in this respect. Although the Court of Cassation criticized the ruling of the ICJ, it conceded 

that it was an authoritative pronouncement in matters of customary international law. The 

only way out was to adopt a dualistic position and declare that the customary international 

norm ascertained by the ICJ did not produce a domestic norm with the same content due to 

its incompatibility with the Italian Constitution. Thus far, the Italian Court of Cassation is 

isolated in its approach, but we ought to be careful not to rush to the conclusion that the 

ICJ’s judgment will settle the discussion. As pointed out by Bianchi: 

 
‘It is certainly true that the judgment in the Jurisdictional Immunities of the State case is a very 

good example of rhetorical efficacy and of the capacity of a judicial body to be attuned to its 

own audience. Having said that, one needs to notice that the blatant denial of any legal remedy to 

victims of serious human rights violations strikes a chord with transnational civil society that no 

technical reasoning or justification based on jurisdictional immunities can effectively counter. 

The idea that the privilege of immunity may shield a state just because of its status is unlikely to 

be well received by those who are unfamiliar with the law. It may then be argued that this is 

precisely the reason for which the law exists. My hunch, however, is that once the law becomes 

too disconnected from the societal body from which it emanates, its credibility is at risk.  

‘History shows that this is an area of law in which the activism of domestic courts has always led 

the way, one way or the other. Even though the constraints currently posed by domestic and 

international judicial precedents, let alone multilateral treaties, seem to be an insurmountable

obstacle to denying state immunity to violators of human rights, one should be cautious before 

concluding that what the ICJ held is the last word on the matter.’91 

 

Although the current consensus is biased towards privileging a formalist, 

quantitative approach to the ascertainment of custom over a qualitative one, states’ rights 

over human rights, and the maintenance of an alleged stability of international relations to 

the detriment of the right to reparation of victims of gross violations of human rights, it is 

important to highlight it is always possible to contest the current structural biases. And this 

contestation, as Koskenniemi argued, can be carried out through the language of 

international law.  

 

5.3 Prospects 

 

 From a geological perspective, the accretion and thickening of the layers relating to 

the protection of human rights generated pressures on the law of state immunity, which is 

located in lower layers of international law.92 Nevertheless, these pressures were not 

enough to give rise to a generalized acceptance of further restrictions to the scope of state 

immunity. The decisions of the ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State and of the 

ECtHR in Jones make it more difficult and unlikely for changes to occur in this regard. At 

the same time, and as noted by Andrea Bianchi, there may be a risk that the law is 

becoming ‘too disconnected from the societal body from which it emanates’ and it might 

be the case that the ICJ did not pronounce the last words on the matter. Domestic courts 

may still have the opportunity to develop renewed assessments of the relationship between 

state immunity and the human rights.93 

 As considered previously, the ICJ asserted that a state’s right to immunity could not 

be made dependent upon a balancing exercise to be conducted by a national court and that 

changes in the scope of state immunity could only be made by changes in state practice,

&lt;http://verfassungsblog.de/constitutional-paths-germany-italy-icj/&gt; accessed 29 April 2016. 
93 See Alebeek (n 64) 574-578. In Alebeek’s understanding, ‘… domestic courts are, as a matter of 
international law, bound by both primary and secondary rules of international law when applying 
international immunity rules.’ She ponders that, even within these strict limits, ‘… the particular sensitivity 
of domestic courts to the right of individuals makes them an obvious candidate for the much-called-for 
reconsideration of both the ECtHR and the ICJ perspectives on the relationship between immunity rules and 
the right of access to court.’  



217  

whilst the ECtHR concluded that the individual’s right of access to court could be limited 

by state immunity because such a limitation pursues a legitimate aim (the promotion of 

good relations between states) and is proportionate (because it is a measure which reflects 

a generally recognized rule of public international law). The Italian Court of Cassation, on 

the other hand, employed techniques typical of modern constitutionalism, resorting to 

general principles, to the concept of normative hierarchy, and to balancing and 

proportionality. 94 This comparison may indicate that domestic courts are in a better 

position to strike a balance between state immunity and human rights in order not to 

disregard the rights of individuals.95 Furthermore, an international court such as the ICJ 

may feel that it is at risk of undermining its legitimacy vis-à-vis its ‘clients’ (ie, states) by 

resorting to hermeneutical techniques like the ones employed by the Italian Court of 

Cassation. Only the future will tell whether the current consensus will be questioned and 

revisited by domestic courts.  

 There have been proposals for an optional protocol to the UNCJISP providing for 

the abrogation of immunity in civil claims based on serious violations of human rights, but, 

as put by Roger O’Keefe, ‘the idea is a pie in the sky’96, since most states are content with 

the status quo. Furthermore, as pointed out by him, states most likely to appear as 

defendants in proceedings of this kind would probably not ratify the proposed protocol.97    

O’Keefe also highlighted that there would be obstacles even if jurisdictional 

immunity were abrogated. Immunity from execution, ‘the last bastion of State 

immunity’98, is governed by different rules and it would still remain even in the case in 

which a victim of a serious violation of human rights obtained a favorable judicial 

decision. O’Keefe contends that the strategy of targeting the forum state’s courts for the 

failure of providing a remedy for the victims of serious violations of human rights due to 

the grant of state immunity is misdirected both in terms of fairness and in terms of ultimate 

policy objectives.99 In his view, this strategy is misdirected in terms of fairness because the 

‘chief villain’ is the state responsible for the violations of international human rights law

and international humanitarian law and which denies redress for the victims. 100 

Accordingly, the state of the victim’s nationality is also to be blamed inasmuch as it fails to 

exercise diplomatic protection in order to secure redress.101 As regards policy objectives, 

O’Keefe argues that the exercise of jurisdiction over foreign states in human rights cases 

does not solve the ultimate problem of the civil impunity of states which violate 

international human rights law and international humanitarian law and it also exempts 

states from defending the rights of its nationals who were victims of such violations 

committed by other states—it is, in his expression, ‘a band-aid solution to the problem of 

civil impunity for violations of international rules on the humane treatment of 

individuals’.102  His suggestion is therefore to shift the focus to the state which caused 

death or personal injury in breach of international law and to the state of the victim’s 

nationality.103  

It is doubtful, however, whether mobilizing the shame of states would be a more 

successful strategy than litigation. Pressuring the state of the victim’s nationality for a 

more active stance as regards diplomatic protection is unlikely to yield the desired results. 

Diplomatic protection is exercised by the state in its own right and has a discretionary 

nature. As Lorna McGregor highlighted, diplomatic protection, from the victim’s 

perspective, is not a ‘controllable and predictable’ mechanism through which a claim can 

be made.104 In any case, these strategies are not mutually exclusive. 

 

5.4 Concluding remarks 

 

 As underscored in the beginning of this chapter, Koskenniemi’s treatment of 

international law as a language accounts for two remarkable characteristics of international 

legal argumentation: its ‘rigorous formalism’ and its ‘substantive open-endedness’. This 

means that current hegemonic views are always open to contestation, provided that this is 

done through the patterns of argumentation accepted by the ‘invisible college of 

international lawyers’. As regards the relationship between state immunity and human 

rights, the current hegemonic professional consensus privileges a rigorous formalism, as 

expressed in the rigid dichotomy between procedural and substantive norms and in a

quantitative methodology for the ascertainment of customary international law. There is 

also a widespread use of an amorphous, hazy concept of sovereignty in order to justify the 

primacy of state immunity over the rights of individuals. Appeals to the necessity of 

maintaining the stability of international relations are also employed in order to rationalize 

the sacrifice of the individual’s right to compensation arising from serious violations of 

international human rights law and international humanitarian law.  

 The decisions of the ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of States and of the ECtHR in 

Jones may have crystallized this consensus. As remarked before, it is the case that, in 

international law, the distinction between deviance and law-creation is not always clear. 

Nevertheless, in the light of the authority attached to these pronouncements, deflection 

from the norm according to which immunity should be granted even in claims arising out 

of gross violations of human rights will more likely be considered law-breaking rather than 

law-development or even law-making. 

 Contestation always remains a possibility. As David Kennedy observed, ‘… the 

patterns of repetitions, associations and references which characterise public international 

law seems suited to a practice of interminable discourse’, and ‘[t]he interminability of 

international law seems the subtle secret of its success.’105 It may be the case that the 

balance struck between state immunity and human rights, regarded by many as 

unsatisfactory, will be reassessed in the future.

6 — GENERAL CONCLUSION 
 

 

 

 

 

‘Why is it that concepts and structures that are themselves indeterminate nonetheless still 

end up always on the side of the status quo?’ 

 

Martti Koskenniemi, From Apology to Utopia: The Structure of International Legal 

Argument (CUP 2005) 606 

 

‘International law might better be viewed as an area of contestation between different 

visions of international law articulated by many different actors, including domestic 

courts.’

and Enforcing International Law’ (2011) 60 ICLQ 57, 80 

 

 

 

 

 

The law of state immunity, which belongs to the international law of coexistence, is 

located in the lower layers of international law.1 Accordingly, expressions like ‘sovereign 

equality’, ‘the comity of nations’, and ‘the dignity of the sovereign’ will inevitably be 

raised when discussing it.2 Pressures on these layers have been caused by the accretion and 

thickening of the legislative and constitutional strata of international law, as evidenced by 

the remarkable expansion of the body of international human rights law.

and Theories; Selected Essays, Speeches and Writings in International Law (Vol 1, OUP 2009) 376-377.  



221  

Thus far, however, these pressures have not been enough to result in the 

preponderance of human rights over the norms relating to state immunity. Although state 

immunity prevents the realization of justice for the victims of serious violations of 

international law, it still exerts a compliance pull—something that may be explained by its 

symbolic validation, to use Franck’s expression.3 State immunity has been associated by 

most courts with the principle of sovereign equality, expressed in the maxim par in parem 

non habet imperium and which is widely recognized as one of the cornerstones of 

international law.  

Within the current predominant state-centered outlook of international law, in 

general terms, arguments supporting the contention according to which a state is not 

entitled to immunity for acts that violate human rights and jus cogens norms have not been 

successful. There have been, of course, voices that strongly disagreed with this hegemonic 

perspective. And they expressed this disagreement coming from different premises. It can 

be mentioned here Cançado Trindade’s dissenting opinion appended to the judgment of the 

ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State, in which it was proposed that the state-centric 

approach to international law should give place to fundamental human values. The Italian 

Court of Cassation resorted to techniques of adjudication usually associated with modern 

constitutionalism, such as general principles, the concept of normative hierarchy, and 

balancing and proportionality. 4  In a stark contrast, the idea that the state’s right to 

immunity could be balanced with other competing interests was frowned upon both in the 

House of Lords and in the ICJ. The judgments of the ICJ in Jurisdictional Immunities of 

the State and of the ECtHR in Jones have not, however, settled the debate, as demonstrated 

by the Italian Court of Cassation in Judgment No 238/2014.   

The legal discussions on the relationship between state immunity and human rights 

often hide and deflect attention from the real underlying problem, namely that of impunity. 

After all, civil claims arising from serious violations of human rights are brought against 

foreign states mostly due to the impossibility of obtaining a remedy otherwise.  

                                                
3 Thomas Franck, Fairness in International Law and Institutions (OUP 1998) 34: ‘Symbolic validation 
communicates authority. … A rule is symbolically validated when it has attributes, often in the form of cues, 
which signal its significant part in the overall system of social order.’ 
4  See Massimo Iovane, ‘Domestic Courts Should Embrace Sound Interpretative Strategies in the 
Development of Human Rights-Oriented International Law’ in Antonio Cassese (ed) Realizing Utopia: The 
Future of International Law (OUP 2012).

Lady Hazel Fox and Philippa Webb emphasized that ‘[t]he law of State immunity 

is not static.’5 It is unlikely, but it may be the case that the situation will eventually reach a 

point in which transformative action 6  will be felt needed—and, through the general 

acceptance by courts and states, changes in the consensus about the law of state immunity 

may take place. International law can change quickly, even in issues that once were 

considered extremely contentious.7 And it might also be the case that transformative action 

will assume other forms unrelated to the exercise by domestic courts of jurisdiction over 

foreign states in human rights cases. 

At the moment, the hegemonic consensus is on the side of the maintenance of the 

status quo. Nonetheless, contestation through the language of international law remains a 

possibility.
