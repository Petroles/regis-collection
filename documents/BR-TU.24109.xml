AGRADECIMENTOS 

Já que não há dissertação alguma sem esta parte (e, sejamos sinceros, quantas vezes ao folhear 

teses apenas lemos resumos e agradecimentos), aqui segue o elenco de quem foi contribuindo, de 

diferentes formas, para que se chegasse ao fim. Antes de mais, como a minha memória já não é o que 

era (por sua vez, graças, em parte, a este trabalho), faltarão pessoas. Se aqui não estão, não é por mal. 

Diria para me virem cravar um copo, que vontade não falta. Mas falta dinheiro, portanto fica para a 

próxima. 

Um especial agradecimento ao coordenador deste mestrado, Professor António Mateus, por todo 

o apoio prestado e paciência consumida, mas também pela preocupação e a disponibilidade que 

demonstrou, recorrentemente, no esclarecimento de dúvidas. Ao orientador Jorge Figueiras, pela leitura 

atenta, pelas correcções e sugestões, que permitiram melhorar substancialmente o documento final. À 

coorientadora deste trabalho, Ana Jesus, por todas as reuniões por Skype, pelas discussões, sugestões e 

correcções que beneficiaram este trabalho. Devo-lhe ainda um agradecimento especial e pessoal, não só 

por toda a preocupação, incentivo e amizade, mas também por me ter recebido de braços abertos em sua 

casa, a 8500km da minha, como se fosse apenas um reencontro de velhos (não etariamente) amigos, 

apesar de nos termos acabado de conhecer. Obrigado por teres tornado a estadia no inferno (aquilo é 

quente!) muito mais agradável. Quero ainda agradecer à Professora Isabel Costa e ao ao Professor Pedro 

Madureira, pelas preciosas correcções, sugestões e reparos, muitíssimo úteis na redacção de um 

documento final substancialmente melhor que o provisório. Gostaria também de agradecer a todas as 

pessoas que tornaram os meus dias na GUTech/Omã mais fáceis; um especial agradecimento à Céline 

Ducassou, ao Wilfried Bauer, ao Bernhard Pracejus e à Amal. À Universidade de Aveiro, na pessoa do 

Professor Fernando Rocha e de Maria Cristina Sequeira, pelo fornecimento de parte dos dados de 

litogeoquímica. Ao Mathieu Bennoit, pela outra metade dos dados de geoquímica de rocha total, os 

elementos traço, e pelas discussões relativas ao contexto geológico/geodinâmico. Ao Dr. Pedro 

Rodrigues, pelos dados de microssonda e também por toda a simpatia e paciência a responder às minhas 

questões existenciais relativas à química mineral. E por me mostrar que sou um nabo a fazer contas. 

Aos meus amigos, da universidade e não só, devo também umas palavrinhas: 

À Sofia, pelo enorme apoio e amizade, por ter sido (quase) minha mãe (também quem cria dois, 

cria dois e meio), por todo o gasóleo gasto a fazer um desvio, à noite, quando podia estar a fazer o o-ó, 

do qual se auto-intitula profissional. Pela companhia a horas obscenas na faculdade, que tornou o 

trabalho pós-luz solar muito mais tolerável e também pelas incríveis pausas, a melhor parte das noitadas 

sem fim. Além disso, devo-lhe também um agradecimento especial por ter sido fundamental para 

manter, pelo menos, parte da minha sanidade mental; obrigado pelo enorme apoio e por me ter aturado 

tanto tempo. Vamos à pausa! À Cristiana, por me ter deixado ocupar o sofá da sua casa algumas vezes, 

pela amizade e apoio constantes, pela motivação, assim como pelos já, internacionalmente, conhecidos 

bolos e doces, que fazem as delicias da malta do 4º piso do C6. À Rita (Ferraz), pela contagiante boa 

disposição, pela simpatia e motivação, pela ajuda e por me ter deixado, tantas vezes, invadir a sua casa 

e ocupar o sofá. Ao Bruno, por me ter aturado três meses em Omã sem ter cometido 

homicídio…oportunidades não faltaram. À chefa Filipa, pela ajuda essencial no processamento 

laboratorial das amostras, pela motivação, incentivo e puxões de orelhas (às vezes tem de ser!). Ao 

Filipe, pela preocupação, incentivo e amizade (já lá vão 6 anos!), e por ser uma excelente pessoa e um 

exemplo, a nível pessoal e científico; ao Ivo, pela boa disposição, apoio, motivação e toda a amizade, 

também já longa; ao Zé, pelas pausas, “reuniões importantes” e pela companhia durante as noites 

intermináveis na faculdade. Ao Marcelo e aos restantes amigos deste mestrado com quem passei 

momentos inesquecíveis, Fred, Miguel, Velez e Hugo. Ao Soares, por todas as palavras de carinho e 

amizade e pela constante preocupação; à Joana Duarte, pelas palavras de apoio, motivação e por todos 

os chocolates deliciosos que trouxe da Suíça. Ao Pambu, pela preocupação e por, apesar de toda a 

distância e tempo, continuar a ser o mesmo palhaço que ia comigo buscar chocolate e pão ao LIDL (bons 

tempos). À Maja que, apesar de ter tido uma estadia curta em Portugal, se tornou uma ótima companheira 

de trabalho e dos momentos de pausa, para beber uma cerveja e falar das banalidades da vida (em inglês 



 
 

IV 

claro); agradeço-lhe também a amizade e todas as palavras de apoio e motivação. Ao “camarada” 

Manuel Silva, por todas as discussões geológicas nas pausas para café. Um agradecimento especial 

também à Rita (Pereira), Marcelino, Miguel Teixeira, Ana Medeiros, Ana Jacinto, Vanessa Pais e Joana 

Ferreira, pela amizade e pela forma desinteressada com que me apoiaram ao longo deste(s) ano(s). 

Depois de toda esta lamechice, vem outra, que deixo o melhor para o fim. Gostaria de agradecer 

de forma muito especial aos meus pais, ao João e às minhas avós, que sempre me possibilitaram e 

incentivaram, sem restrições, a seguir os estudos em algo que, pelo menos ao início, não faziam ideia 

do que era (caramba, são só pedras!) – nem eu, passados seis anos, faço! Devo-lhes também um pedido 

de desculpas, por todas as ausências. Obrigado pela enorme compreensão e pelo constante apoio. 

Por fim, quero agradecer à pessoa a quem dedico este trabalho, que sempre me dirigiu palavras 

de motivação, carinho, apreço e apoio e, infelizmente, não o pôde ver terminado.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

Since this part is almost mandatory (and let’s be honest, no one reads any other chapters besides 

the abstracts and the acknowledgements), here is the list of people who contributed, in many ways, for 

this work to be completed. First of all, since my memory isn’t what is used to be (partly due to this 

work), some people are probably missing. It’s not in bad faith. I’d say to come and ask me for a drink, 

I’ve got the will. But not the money, so we’ll schedule it for another day. 

I am forever in debt to the MSc program coordinator, Professor António Mateus, for all the 

support and patience but also for all the concern and availability in answering questions he has shown. 

To this work supervisor, Jorge Figueiras, whose careful reading allowed to substantially improve the 

presented work. To the co-supervisor, Ana Jesus, for all the Skype meetings, discussions, suggestions 

and corrections, especially regarding my English skills, which were also important to this thesis. I owe 

her, also, many thanks, personally, not only for the concern, incentive and friendship, but also for 

welcoming me so warmly at her place, 8500km from mine, as if it was only an old friends reencounter, 

despite the fact we had just met each other. Thank you for making the stay in hell (that place is warm!) 

so much enjoyable. Also, many thanks to Professors Isabel Costa and Pedro Madureira, for the time and 

patience spent, reading this work, and for the precious and important corrections and suggestions, 

improving this final version I’d also like to thank to everyone that made my days in GUtech/Oman 

easier: special mentions to Céline Ducassou, to Wilfried Bauer, to Amal, to Bernhard Pracejus and to 

Michaela Bernecker. To the University of Aveiro, namely Professor Fernando Rocha and Maria Cristina 

Sequeira, for providing part of the lithogeochemical data. To Mathieu Bennoit, for the other part of the 

whole-rock trace element geochemical data as well as for the discussions related to the geodynamic and 

geological setting of the ophiolite. To Dr. Pedro Rodrigues, for the microprobe data, as well as for his 

kindness and patience in answering all my existential question regarding mineral chemistry. And also 

for showing me that I’m a complete zero at math. 

I’d also want to mention some of my friends.  

To Sofia, for the support and friendship. For being (almost) my mother (she raised two so, two 

and a half is not a problem), for all the gasoline spent in a small detour at night, when she could have 

been sleeping, which she brags about being a professional at it. For the company at obscene hours in the 

university, making the post-daylight work more bearable, as well as for the amazing breaks, the best 

time of those endless nights. Furthermore, I owe her also some special thanks for being fundamental for 

me to keep, at least part, of my mental health. Come, it’s break time! To Cristiana, for sometimes letting 

me occupy her sofa, for the constant friendship and support, motivation and the, by now internationally 

known, cakes and sweets, that delights everyone on the 4
th
 floor of C6. To Rita (Ferraz), with her 

constant and contagious good humour, for the kindness and motivational conversations, for the help she 

gave me and for often letting me invade her place and crash in. To Bruno, for putting up with me for 

three months without committing murder…There were a lot of opportunities. To the boss, Filipa, for the 

essential help in the laboratorial processing of the samples, for the motivational words and the occasional 

earful. To Filipe, for the constant concern, motivation and friendship (6 years already!). For being a 

terrific person and a great example, personally and scientifically; to Ivo, for the great and fun mood, 

support and motivation, as well as for the now long (and good) friendship; to Zé, for the breaks from 

work, “important meetings” and for the companionship throughout the nights in FCUL; to Marcelo and 

the rest of my friends from the MSc, with which I spent unforgettable moments, Fred, Miguel, Velez 

and Hugo. To Soares, for all the kind words and for being a great friend; to Joana Duarte, for all the 

inspiring words and for all the delicious chocolates brought from Switzerland. To Pambu, for the interest 

and, despite the distance, remaining the same asshole that kept me company at night in FCUL, after 

grabbing some bread and chocolate from LIDL (good old times). To Maja which, despite the short stay 

in Portugal, became a pleasant company, during work-time and afterwards: to grab a beer and talk about 

the trivialities of life; I also want to thank her for all the support and motivation, even when she left 

Lisbon. To my “comrade” Manuel Silva, for all the geological discussions and the coffee-break 

enjoyable times. I’d also like to give out special thanks to Rita (Pereira), Marcelino, Miguel Teixeira, 



 
 

VI 

Ana Medeiros, Ana Jacinto, Vanessa Pais and Joana Ferreira, for the friendship and support during 

this/these year(s). 

After all this lame conversation, here it comes: another one. I saved the best for last. I’d like to 

appreciate and acknowledge, in a very special way, both my parents, my brother João and my 

grandmothers, who’ve always supported and encouraged me, without restraints, to follow what I thought 

best, despite, at first, they didn’t have any clue of what was it all about (damn, it’s just rocks!)- neither 

do I, and six years have passed already! I owe them, also, a great deal of apologies, for all my absences. 

Thanks for the huge understanding and support. 

Finally, I also want to thank in a very special way to the person I dedicate this work, which 

unconditionally supported me and showed a great deal of appreciation and care; which motivated me to 

keep studying and, sadly, couldn’t see this “chapter” completed.

RESUMO  

Durante o Cretácico, o complexo contexto geológico e geodinâmico do ofiolito de Sumail, situado no 

Omã, permitiu o desenvolvimento de sistemas hidrotermais e consequente formação de numerosas 

mineralizações de sulfuretos maciços, algumas com interesse económico, encontrando-se hospedadas 

na sequência vulcânica. Esta é dividida em quatro principais unidades vulcânicas (da mais antiga para a 

mais recente): Geotimes, Lasail, Alley e Boninitic Alley. Apesar da maior parte destes depósitos se 

encontrarem hospedados na transição entre Geotimes e Alley, qualquer período de quiescência 

vulcânica, muitas vezes marcados pela presença de sedimentos metalíferos e outros marcadores de 

actividade hidrotermal exalativa, traduz um horizonte temporal onde a precipitação e acumulação de 

sulfuretos maciços é possível. Esta província metalogénetica de VMS do tipo máfico/tipo Chipre, é, 

então, comparável, em dimensão e tonelagem, ao ofiolito de Troodos, Chipre, com 30 a 50Mt de 

tonelagem total de minérios. 

O depósito de Mandoos, situado perto de Sohar, na parte Norte do ofiolito de Sumail, foi descoberto em 

2009 através de técnicas geofísicas aeroportadas (VTEM), e as operações de extração tiveram início em 

2011, em open-pit. Com recursos medidos que perfazem um total de 8 Mt, com 5 Mt de reservas (a 1.8% 

de Cu), este depósito representa um dos maiores depósitos descobertos neste ofiolito. Apesar disto, a 

inexistência de estudos detalhados desta mineralização, fazem dele um ótimo caso de estudo, permitindo 

o desenvolvimento de um estudo metalogenético aprofundado, (possivelmente) contribuindo para a 

definição de critérios de prospeção deste tipo de mineralizações. Assim, recorrendo a amostras recolhdas 

no open-pit e em sondagens cedidas pela Mawarid Mining, este trabalho teve como objectivo a 

caracterização da sequência vulcânica que hospeda esta mineralização, utilizando critérios 

mineralógicos e geoquímicos, com objectivo de I) atribuir uma posição volcano-estratigráfica ao 

depósito, e II) caracterizar os padrões de alteração observados, distinguindo entre halos de alteração 

imputáveis a episódios regionais, de baixa temperatura (“metassomatismo oceânico”) e halos de 

alteração hidrotermal, associados à precipitação e acumulação de sulfuretos maciços. 

As rochas vulcânicas que hospedam esta mineralização correspondem a rochas basálticas, de natureza 

toleiitica, caracterizadas por anomalias positivas, baixas, em Ti. Os teores baixos em ETRL (comparados 

com os dos ETRP), os padrões normalizados (condrito C1) de ETR e os seus teores em HSFE permitem 

atribuir estas rochas à unidade Lasail, colocando a possibilidade das rochas vulcânicas a muro da 

mineralização corresponderem a vulcanismo transicional entre esta unidade e a Geotimes. Considerando 

as características geoquímicas, particularmente de elementos traço e, também, os dados publicados (e.g. 

Godard et al., 2003; 2006; Kusano et al., 2012) para esta unidade vulcânica, considera-se que estas 

derivam da fusão parcial de rochas mantélicas, sujeitas anteriormente a taxas de fusão parcial elevadas, 

aquando da formação de fundidos silicatados máficos, tipo MORB, cuja extrusão originou a unidade 

infrajacente, Geotimes, num contexto de rift e formação de crosta oceânica.  

A sequência vulcânica é composta por basaltos microporfiríticos, sob a forma de escoadas maciças e/ou 

pillow-lavas, com quantidades e distribuição de vesículas variáveis, traduzindo os canais por onde os 

gases escaparam, durante a sua extrusão. Estas encontram-se também localmente fragmentadas, sendo 

esta fragmentação resultante de processos de arrefecimento brusco, relacionados com a interacção com 

água do mar. Estes processos estão associados a fracturação e fragmentação, criando descontínuidades 

físicas que permitem o escoamento de fluidos, gerando texturas similares a brechas. Os 

microfenocristais de clinopiroxena, de composição augítica, e de feldspatos do grupo das plagioclases, 

de composição bytownítica, encontram-se dispersos, por vezes em aglomerados, numa matriz composta 

por micrólitos de feldspatos do grupo das plagioclases, de composição semelhante à dos 

microfenocristais, e óxidos de Fe com quantidades consideráveis de Ti.  



 
 

VIII 

Um primeiro episódio de alteração, de natureza pervasiva e ubíquo, correspondente a alteração regional 

decorrente da circulação de água do mar, em condições oxidantes, emm razões água/rocha baixas 

(metassomatismo oceânico), processo comumente apelidado de espilitização. Este estádio de alteração 

é marcado pela alteração das fases vulcânicas primárias: no caso dos cristais de clinopiroxena, esta 

alteração dá-se preferencialmente nos bordos e em fracturas, e esta é materializada por anfíbola e, 

posteriormente, marcada por clorite+epídoto; por sua vez, os microfenocristais e micrólitos de 

plagioclase registam um incremento significativo da molécula albítica na sua composição, sendo apenas 

encontrados núcleos que preservam a composição primária; os óxidos de ferro disseminados na matriz 

apresentam, frequentemente, bordos corroídos, e, na proximidade destes, são encontrados cristais de 

titanite. A matriz destas rochas encontra-se substituída por filossilicatos, com características expansivas, 

possivelmente interestratificados clorite-esmectite. A presença destes interestratificados poderá resultar, 

assim, da alteração de vidro vulcânico. Este episódio é também caracterizado pelo preenchimento das 

vesículas por fases minerais neo-formadas, como é o caso dos interestratificados clorite-smectite, calcite 

e zeólitos cálcicos. Estas ocorrem frequentemente, também, sob a forma de precipitados que preenchem 

veios. Frequentemente, são também encontrados veios preenchidos por hematite+carbonatos+clorite, 

que marcam a transição para o segundo episódio de alteração identificado.  

Na zona SE do depósito, assim como no open pit, são encontrados jaspes e umbers – rochas argilíticas 

ricas em (hidr)óxidos de Fe e Mn-, resultado de actividade exalativa hidrotermal de baixa tempertura. O 

desenvolvimento deste sistema hidrotermal está, possivelmente, controlado estruturalmente, e, perto do 

contacto com estas rochas exalativo-hidrotermais, observa-se, na matriz das rochas vulcânicas, uma 

forte impregnação de hematite, sendo apenas reconhecível alguns fenocristais de clinopiroxena. Na 

restante área, longe da influência directa das estruturas por onde os fluidos hidrotermais oxidantes, ricos 

em Fe e Mn, circulam, este episódio está marcado pela presença de veios de hematite+quartzo. São, 

também, frequentemente, observados veios de carbonatos calcíticos, que cortam estas rochas exalativas, 

localmente preenchendo fracturas en echelon, com brechificação sobreimposta. 

A actividade hidrotermal relacionada com a mineralização de sulfuretos maciços (e a intensidade da 

alteração associada) é, também, controlada estruturalmente, mas também função da porosidade e 

permeabilidade das rochas vulcânicas, i.e. abundância e distribuição das vesículas. Com base em 

geotermómetros baseados na variabilidade composicional da clorite, é possível estimar temperaturas 

entre 250-400ºC, para o fluido hidrotermal relacionado com a mineralização.  

De forma geral, distinguem-se diferentes fases de circulação de fluidos hidrotermais, dispostos numa 

rede de veios e filonetes, preenchidos por: I) Qz+Py+Chl; II) Qz+Py+Ccp; III) Cb+Py/Qz+Zeol; IV e 

V) Qz microcristalino. O controlo estrutural para a circulação destes fluidos hidrotermais é também 

reconhecível através das evidências de reabertura e sobreposição destas estádios de precipitados 

hidrotermais. A acompanhar a alteração hidrotermal associada à mineralização, ocorrem esporádicas 

disseminações de cristais euédricos, sub-microscópicos, de apatite, sugerindo uma contribuição de 

fluidos magmático-derivados, associados à cristalização das intrusões sub-vulcânicas doleríticas. Estas 

rochas apresentam também disseminações de apatite, assim como alguns sulfuretos (sub)microscópicos. 

Na área S/SE da mineralização, a alteração hidrotermal está marcada por uma silicificação fraca, 

disseminação de pirite e processos mais intensos de cloritização (comparando com as amostras 

recuperadas no open pit), com veios de quarto, clorite, pirite e, ocasionalmente, calcopirite. A partir dos 

dados de quimica mineral de grãos de chlorite, obtidos a partir destas amostras, é possível concluir que 

o fluido hidrotermal mineralizante, circulou a temperaturas entre os 200-400ºC, com valor mediano de 

~270ºC. Por sua vez, nas amostras provenientes do open-pit são observáveis processos alteração 

hidrotermal marcados por silicificação mais intensos, acompanhados pela deposição de clorite, sob a 



 
 

IX 

forma de agregados de granularidade reduzida, disseminação de pirite, e ocasionalmente de calcopirite 

e esfalerite. Em ambos os casos é possivel encontrar, por vezes, evidências mineralógicas atribuíveis ao 

primeiro estádio de alteração descrito (metassomatismo oceânico), nomeadamente micrólitos de 

plagioclase albitizados.  

Durante a alteração hidrotermal, os balanços de massa que se estabelecem são, geralmente, negativos, 

com perdas de massa significativas, caracterizados por perda considerável em Si, Ca ou Mg, compatível 

com a decomposição das fases ferromagnesianas primárias e neo-formação de fases secundárias. Ganhos 

em Fe, acompanhados por Mg, indicam a presença de fluidos hidrotermais diluídos (misturados com 

água do mar), enquanto algumas zonas do open-pit são caracterizadas por ganhos em Fe, não 

acompanhados por ganhos em Mg, sugerindo a circulação de fluidos hidrotermais não diluídos. A estes 

domínios, registam também ganhos consideráveis em Cu, Zn, As, Ba e ainda em In, Sn, Tl e Cd, na 

ordem das dezenas de ppm, indicando ainda um input de fluidos tardios de oridem magmática, para o 

fluido hidrotermal, responsável pela mineralização. 

É também possível observar veios de hematite, posteriores à alteração hidrotermal, revelando que, 

durante o colapso térmico do sistema hidrotermal, outro(s) episódio(s) exalativo-hidrotermal de baixa 

temperatura sejam responsáveis pela deposição de jaspes/umbers. Assim, a mesma fonte de calor que 

permite sustentar os sistemas produtivos hidrotermais representa também, a fonte de calor que alimenta 

outros sistemas, de mais baixa temperatura, favorecendo a recorrência de alguns estádios de evolução 

do sistema, em períodos temporais distintos. 

Não obstante a amostragem abranger uma área significativa do depósito e permitir a caracterização da 

evolução do(s) sistema(s) hidrotermal/hidrotermais responsáveis pela formação deste depósito, uma 

amostragem mais completa, assim como a identificação e mapeamento das principais estruturas 

tectónicas presentes na área, permitiria a caracterização espacial do padrão de distribuição dos halos de 

alteração hidrotermal. 

Por fim, a utilização dos índices CCPI, AI e dos AImaiores e AItraço corroboram os dados mineralógicos e 

texturais, traduzindo uma boa correlação entre os dados de geoquimica de rocha total com as 

modificações mineralógicas, texturais e composicionais descritas. Assim, a sua utilização afigura-se 

interessante na prospecção de mineralizações do tipo VMS para o ofiolito de Omã.

ABSTRACT 

The Sumail ophiolite hosts numerous epi to syn-genetic massive sulphide mineralizations in its 

Cretaceous volcanic sequence. The Mandoos is one of the largest VMS deposits found in the ophiolite 

and the lack of detailed studies on its genesis makes it a prime case-study. Thus, this work aims to 

develop a mineralogical and geochemical characterization of the volcanic sequence that hosts the 

mineralization, in order to develop a metallogenetic model for the formation of the deposit, 

characterizing the hydrothermal alteration associated to the massive sulphide formation, the pinpoint of 

its volcanostratigraphic position and to develop geochemical criteria, helpful for mineral exploration 

purposes. 

Considering the REE contents and patterns, and the HSFE contents, these volcanic rocks are considered 

part of the Lasail volcanic unit, which rocks derive from the partial melting of an already depleted DMM 

mantle source, which underwent a previous melt extraction, in a ridge setting. These are 

microporphyritic basaltic rocks, with tholeiitic affinities, with a primary mineralogy is characterized by 

augitic clinopyroxene and bytownitic to labradoritic feldspar microphenocrysts, set in a plagioclase 

microlite rich matrix, with disseminated Ti-rich magnetite crystals. Oceanic metasomatic alteration is 

pervasive and responsible for the alteration and replacement of the primary volcanic minerals by (Ca-

)amphiboles+Chl+Ep, Ab and Ttn and by the alteration of volcanic glass to interlayered Chl-Sme, as 

well as other secondary mineral phases such as calcite and calcic-zeolites, as vesicles and fractures 

infills. Sub-volcanic intrusions (dolerites) act as heat sources that allow to sustain structurally controlled 

hydrothermal systems, in different periods of time. Low-temperature hydrothermal systems are 

responsible for late-developed Hem+Qz±Chl±Cb veins, throughout the sampled area, and, in the SE part 

of the deposit, for the deposition of jaspers and umbers. Overall, the hydrothermal alteration includes 

silicification, dissemination of pyrite and chloritization and, in most of the area it is associated to 

hydrothermal quartz veins, sometimes occurring with sulphides, distinguishing four different 

hydrothermal vein stages: i) Qz+Py, ii) Qz+Py+Ccp±Sph which are, sometimes, re-opened and Cb+Py 

or Qz+Zeol precipitate, denoting an evolution of the hydrothermal fluid; iii and iv) Qz. The hydrothermal 

system, responsible for the mineralization, is characterized by temperatures between 200-430 ºC; it’s 

circulation is responsible for the development of different alteration facies, sometimes with preservation 

of oceanic metassomatic alteration effects, such as the albitized microlites. This is the result of the 

primary volcanic rocks permeability but, more importantly, the proximity to the structural features that 

act as fluid-flow channels. In extreme cases, the hydrothermal alteration is marked by intense 

brecciation, with hydrothermal quartz and sulphides-bearing veins, silicification and sulphides 

dissemination, revealing that the mineralization also took place as sub-seafloor replacement.  

The lithogeochemical data is coherent with the mineralogical transformations, using the AI and CCPI 

indexes. Additionally, during the registered alteration stages, elements such as Ti, Zr, Ta, Yb, Y, Nb 

and Ta are considered to have an immobile behaviour, some of them showing a slight mobility, 

especially during hydrothermal alteration. Nevertheless, the established mass balances, during 

hydrothermal alteration, record negative balances. Nevertheless, Fe gains are usually accompanied by 

Mg additions, highlighting the presence of diluted fluids but, for the sampled area of the open pit, the 

presence of non-diluted hydrothermal fluids is inferred by gains in Fe (but not in Mg) and metals such 

as Cu and Zn. Also, gains in In, Cd, Sn and Tl, as well as Ap disseminations in hydrothermal altered 

samples, reveal an input of late-magmatic fluids into the hydrothermal system. Finally, the use of AImajor 

and AItrace is found to be useful in distinguishing hydrothermal alteration, related to sulphide deposition, 

from regional metassomatic alteration, useful for exploration surveys.

CHAPTER I  
INTRODUCTION 

 

Volcanogenic massive sulphides (VMS) are epigenetic to syngenetic, stratabound/lenticular bodies of 

sulphide minerals, precipitated from hydrothermal fluids at or immediately below the sea-floor. 

The term VMS implies a direct spatial, temporal or genetic relationship with volcanic activity and is 

distinguishable from other similar ore subtypes, like Volcanic Hosted Massive Sulphide (VHMS) or 

Volcanic Associated Massive Sulphides (VAMS), where that relationship is not straightforward 

(Hannington, 2014). These relationships include: I) controls on the occurrence of the orebodies within 

the volcanic structures and sequences; II) (sub)volcanic activity acting as a heat-source, producing high 

rates of heat advection, required to sustain (modified) sea-water circulation in the oceanic crust 

(convection being possible in presence of a quasi-isotropic permeability) and; III) source of metals, 

through interaction of the sea-water with the footwall volcanic rocks and, sometimes, with late-stage 

magmatic-derived fluids. Thus, the depth of the heat-source, the temporal and spatial distribution of 

permeability in the host-rocks as well as the tectonic activity represent the three major factors controlling 

the fluid-flow, discharge and the life span of a VMS-forming hydrothermal system (Hannington, 2014). 

Lenticular-shaped massive sulphide bodies are mostly composed of pyrite, with subordinate amounts of 

chalcopyrite, sphalerite, bornite, tetrahedrite, among others. It usually lies above an inverted cone-

shaped sulphide bearing anastomosed vein system, corresponding to the stringer or stockwork zone, 

which represent the fluid flow conducts that fed the hydrothermal ore system (Hannington, 2014). The 

interaction of these sea-water derived hydrothermal fluids with the footwall volcanic rocks results in a 

series of chemical reactions, that ultimately generate alteration haloes. These hydrothermal alteration 

haloes vary widely, even in the same ore district, depending on rock permeability, changes in fluid 

chemistry and, rock composition, as well as in other physical-chemical variables that control the rate 

and extension of mineral/textural transformations (Hannington, 2014). In general, hydrothermal 

alteration involves replacement of primary igneous minerals (e.g. pyroxenes, plagioclase, Fe(-Ti) 

oxides), and volcanic glass, by secondary mineral phases, stable at temperature and chemical 

environment, such as chlorite, epidote, carbonates, pyrite, albite, sericite, clay minerals and quartz or 

different forms of silica (chalcedony, opal). The degree of alteration is also very variable, ranging from 

weak, allowing the preservation of primary volcanic textures and rock-forming minerals, to pervasive 

and intense, with (almost complete) obliteration of primary textures and minerals.  

Despite this wide range of variation, there are recognizable zonal arrangements related to the 

hydrothermal fluid circulation in the genesis of VMS deposits, characterized by particular types of 

mineral assemblages that allow the reconstitution of the main paths of fluid flow, sulphide deposition 

and water/rock reaction processes (Hannington, 2014). The recognition of hydrothermal alteration 

haloes is therefore critical to the development of exploration vectors, which allow the assessment of 

favourable exploration targets for VMS deposits.

The classification of VMS deposits can be made on different basis. Some classification schemes use 

their metal composition/contents as the main criteria (e.g. Franklin et al. 1981; Franklin et al., 2005; 

Barrie and Hannington, 1999), others consider their geological setting (Sawkins, 1976), or host-rock 

composition (e.g. Barrie and Hanningtion, 1999). An increasingly used classification is the one proposed 

by Barrie and Hannington (1999) and later modified by Franklin et al (2005). Therefore, in a first 

approach, five different type of VMS districts can be recognized: I) bimodal-mafic; II) mafic; III) pelitic-

mafic; IV) bimodal-felsic; V) siliciclastic-felsic. These types are then sub-divided on the basis of their 

lithofacies association, providing a way of pinpointing the volcano-sedimentary environment of a 

specific deposit (Franklin et al., 2005): 

I). The bimodal-mafic VMS provinces (or districts) corresponds to incipient rift-related bimodal 

volcanic arcs, above intra-oceanic subduction (oceanic suprasubduction rifted arc), dominated by basalts 

but up to 25% of felsic rocks; pillowed and massive basaltic flows, felsic flows and domes with minor 

basaltic and felsic volcaniclastic rocks occur within sedimentary sequences dominated by graywackes, 

sandstones and shales, with local debris flows (e.g. Abitibi, Canada; Flin Flon, Canada). 

II). The mafic type VMS provinces correlates with intra-oceanic back-arcs and mid-ocean ridges, 

ophiolite and ophiolite-like sequences, dominated by MORB-boninite and arc tholeiite sequences with 

prevailing pillowed and massive basaltic flows, minor felsic flows and/or domes, synvolcanic mafic 

dykes or sills. Minor sulphide-rich/reduced or hematite/oxidized argillite, chert or tuffs also occur (e.g. 

Konuto, Canada; Troodos, Cyprus; Sumail, Oman). At fast spreading ridges, high temperature fluids 

circulate at relatively shallow depths and the ore-forming systems tend to be small and/or short-lived or 

subjected to strong intermittency, due to the frequent volcanic eruptions that disrupt the hydrothermal 

paths and bury the sulphide accumulations; in such settings, hydrothermal fields and vents are rapidly 

displaced from their heat source. In slow-spreading ridges the magma supply rate is lower, hence, 

hydrothermal systems are supported by long-lived high heat flow will have the chance to produce larger 

sulphide accumulations. 

III). The pelitic-mafic corresponds to mature, basalt-pelite dominated back-arc sequences, in juvenile 

accreted arc assemblages, typically devoid of felsic volcanic rocks. The sedimentary sequences are often 

of distal flysch type, but they can include carbonaceous shales, siltstones and minor sandstones, besides 

mafic sills (e.g. Outukumpo, Finland; Besshi district, Japan).  

IV). The bimodal-felsic association is common in continental margin arcs and related back-arcs in which 

felsic volcaniclastic rocks dominate, along with minor basaltic/andesitic flows and clastic sedimentary 

rocks (e.g. Pilbara, Australia; Eskay Creek, Canada). 

V). Siliciclastic-felsic type compares to mature epicontinental back-arcs where siliciclastic sequences 

prevail over felsic volcaniclastic and/or massive flows or domes with even minor mafic (tholeiitic to 

alkaline) flows or sills; often the sedimentary sequences contain Fe-, Mn- Ca- and Ba-rich chemiogenic 

sedimentary rocks/sediments (e.g. Iberian Pyrite Belt, Portugal and Spain; Lachlan Fold Belt, Mexico).  

Another commonly used classification scheme distinguishes three types of VMS deposits: i) Besshi type 

VMS, broadly correlated to the pelitic-mafic type VMS; ii) Kuroko-type VMS deposits, corresponding 

to the bimodal mafic type; and iii) Cyprus-type, representing obducted VMS deposits, i.e. of the mafic 

type. 

The Sumail ophiolite hosts of a series of VMS occurrences, classified as mafic-type VMS. These are 

mostly found in the northern part of Oman, along the Batinah Coast, in the Sohar region, some of them

irregularly mined since the Bronze Age (for Cu and, where gossanized sulphide mounds exist, for Au). 

The most important deposits are Aarja, Hatta, Lasail, Bayda, Shinas, Al Bishara, Rakha and Mandoos. 

These deposits are typical Cyprus-type ore systems and totalize 30 to 50Mt of ores (Galley et al., 2007; 

Franklin et al., 2005) with an average copper content of 2.3% (Gilgen et al., 2014), comparable to values 

for the Troodos Ophiolite in Cyprus. The known orebodies are, usually, massive pyritic masses with 

minor chalcopyrite and sphalerite, hosted in the extrusive Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian to Turonian) 

sequence. These mineralizations are thought to have been formed in black smokers sulphide mounds 

and hydrothermal fields, analogous to those found in present-day oceanic settings (e.g. East Pacific 

Rise).  

The Mandoos deposit was identified in 2009, when Mawarid Mining conducted the first exploration 

survey in the area, through an airborne VTEM (versatile time-domain electromagnetic) geophysical 

assessment, during which three other targets were defined. A later geological exploration survey, 

including an adequate drilling program, confirmed the existence of massive sulphides in three of the 

four previously delimited targets, Mandoos 1 being the bigger and copper richer target. The fourth target, 

Mandoos 4, did not result in the discovery of a VMS orebody (Mawarid Mining, 2014).  

The mining operations at Mandoos 1 started in October 2011, in an open-pit, that reached the maximum 

exploitable extension in mid-February 2015, when the mine finally closed, due to financial/economic 

factors. Although the mining activities were abandoned there is still some potential to expand 

exploitation underground and mine about the remainder of the orebody, an option which is currently 

under consideration. According to Mawarid Mining, the deposit contains about 8 Mt of copper sulphide 

ore, with 5 Mt in reserves at 1.8% Cu (Rob Willis, pers. comm. to Ana Jesus, February, 2015). 

The main objective of this project is to provide a study of the volcanic rocks forming the hanging and 

footwall sequence, hosting the Mandoos massive sulphide ores. The petrographic, mineralogical and 

geochemical characterization of a representative set of samples, collected at the open pit and 6 different 

drill cores, allowed: I) the discrimination of the petrological (igneous) processes responsible for the 

genesis of these rocks, especially regarding the tectonic setting in which the rocks erupted (MORB s.l. 

vs SSZ signatures); II) the correct assignment of a volcanic-stratigraphic position to the deposit, and III) 

the distinction between the inprints of the low-temperature oceanic metasomatic alteration from those 

due to hydrothermal processes, directly related to the massive sulphide deposition (i.e. hydrothermal 

alteration/mineralization haloes). The analysis of their extent and nature, as well as the crucial factors 

for their development, represent significant inputs to an intended metallogenic model of the deposit, 

providing also crucial information to further exploration surveys and economic feasibility studies.

GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

 

II.1. REGIONAL SETTING– OPHIOLITE OBDUCTION AND GEODYNAMIC MODELS 

The Sumail (also referred as Semail or Samail) ophiolite constitutes the best preserved and less deformed 

ophiolitic sequence in the world. It is found in the Oman mountains, in a ~600 km long, and up to 150-

wide belt and includes a complete section of the oceanic crust and underlying mantle (10-15 km thick), 

one of the Neo-Tethyan Oceanic basins. This oceanic crust fragment is part of the Alpine-Himalayan 

fold-thrust collisional belt that extends from the Mediterranean to the Far East (Lippard et al., 1986; 

Goodenough et al., 2014; Hou &amp;amp; Zhang, 2015) (Figure II. 1). It is one of the many Tethyan ophiolites, 

formed during the oceanic-continental collision related to the closing of the Neo-Tethys ocean, result of 

the Africa/Nubia and Eurasia tectonic plate collision, coeval of the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean 

(Lippard et al., 1986).

II.1.1. MAIN UNITS OF THE SUMAIL OPHIOLITE 

In the Sumail, a complete ophiolitic sequence (as defined in the Penrose Conference, 1972) is preserved 

(Figure 2 and 3). Deformation is not widespread and resulted in minor doming and thrusting during 

obduction (Gilgen et al., 2014). Instead, the deformation was strongly partitioned into a basal thrust and 

regional shear-zones (Boudier et al., 1988). Thus, this ophiolite preserves the main structure of the 

spreading centres, as well as the lithostratigraphic relationships, reason why it is widely used as an 

analogue for understanding present day oceanic crustal processes (Nicolas et al., 2000; Godard et al., 

2006; Gilgen et al., 2014).  

The mantle portion comprises mantle peridotites, mainly harzburgites, originated from partial melting 

of fertile spinel lherzolites; other peridotitic rocks include dunites and minor lherzolites, displaying 

various tectonic and plastic flow deformation (micro)structures, as well as evidence of various 

serpentinization episodes (Boudier, 1985). The Moho transition zone (MTZ) has a variable thickness, 

from ten to hundreds of meters. It represents a level of magmatic exchange between asthenospheric 

mantle and the oceanic crust, mainly composed of dunite with various types of segregations and 

intrusions (gabbroic, piroxenitic and chromitites) (Boudier, 1995).  

Above the MTZ, the lowermost crustal section composed of a gabbroic suite, layered and foliated- 

olivine gabbros, troctolites, wehrlites (Boudier, 1996; Boudier, 2000). The layered gabbros are found in 

the lower part of the crustal section and includes alternating layers of gabbroic cummulates, anorthosite 

and (ultra-)mafic portions: foliation is commonly defined by plagioclase laths and elongated crystals, 

corresponding to magmatic flow and compaction structures (Boudier, 1996). The upper gabbroic section 

is composed of foliated gabbros, having a linear and planar fabric. The foliation changes gradually from 

flat lying- in the layered gabbros- to a steeper dip towards the foliated gabbros, where it is almost parallel 

to the sheeted dykes. In some areas, the foliation in the upper gabbros disappears, forming patches of 

amphibole-rich isotropic gabbros in the root zone of the sheeted dykes (Boudier, 2000).  

The top of the gabbroic sequence, near (or at) the sheeted dyke transition, is intruded by trondhjemites, 

which genesis is still under debate. They are commonly interpreted as late-stage, extreme differentiates 

of basaltic melts (e.g. Lippard et al., 1986), thus providing a good estimate of the age of the ophiolite. 

Nevertheless, some authors distinguish three different type of trondhjemites (Rollinson, 2006): (1) the 

earlier ones, formed as a result of partial melting of MORB-like gabbros, previously hydrated by sea-

water derived fluids (second stage melts); (2) later trondjhemites result of differentiation of a magma 

produced from re-melting of a depleted harzburgitic mantle source; and (3) mantle-hosted trondhjemites 

formed by mixing or contamination processes, during or immediately following the emplacement of 

ophiolites (e.g. Rollinson, 2006). This implies that the trondhjemites found throughout the ophiolite are 

not providing the same age, since they originate from diachronic geological processes, challenging the 

average age of ~95Ma, often considered (e.g. Tilton, 1981; Lippard et al., 1986; Boudier et al., 1998; 

Searle and Cox, 1999; Searle et al., 2003; Warren et al., 2005; Dilek &amp;amp; Furnes, 2009; Goodenough et 

al., 2010; Dilek &amp;amp; Furnes, 2011). 

The uppermost part of the gabbroic section of the crust is crosscut by dolerite dykes, particularly at the 

transition zone to the sheeted dykes sequence. The dykes represent the feeder channels of the overlying 

extrusive magmatic sequence. The extrusive rocks comprise a suite of Cretaceous volcanic rocks, mostly 

pillow lavas and massive flows, that host numerous epigenetic volcanic massive sulphide orebodies 

(VMS). The volcanic rocks are affected by a set of normal faults, which are later intruded by un-

deformed dykes, sometimes displaying evidence of hydrothermal alteration. This suggests that these 

faults were related to seafloor extension and contemporaneous volcanism, as well as hydrothermal

activity- with sulphide deposition (Gilgen et al., 2014). The volcanic rocks are often overlain by pelagic 

sedimentary rocks, with Cenomanian to Turonian microfossils (Fleet &amp;amp; Robertson, 1980).  

Considering the accepted U-Pb zircon ages for several intrusive bodies at different levels in the 

ophiolitic section, ophiolite (e.g., Warren et al., 2005), and the combination with the microfossils from 

pelagic sediments, it is possible to infer that sea-floor volcanism was active for 10 M.y., between 98.8 

and ~89 M.y. (Gilgen et al., 2014).

MINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN

II.1.2. GEODYNAMIC EVOLUTION 

The opening of the Neo-Tethys and the Hawasina basin began in the mid-Permian, with the 

intracontinental rifting of the Gondwana, related to the closure of the Paleo-Tethys (Muttoni et al., 2009; 

Berra et al., 2016; Németh et al., 2016). The intracontinental rifting is marked by bimodal alkaline 

volcanism (Haiby volcanics), along with siliciclastic rocks and carbonates sedimentation, part of the 

Haybi Complex/Hamrat Duru group (Cox, 2000; Searl, 2007). Lateral facies variations account for the 

formation of shelf carbonates of the Sumeni Group and progressively distal siliciclastic slope and basin 

facies from the Hawasina Group (e.g. Searl, 2007 and references therein). The inexistence of calc-

alkaline magmatism in the Arabian margin, as well as the evolution of the sedimentary record, supports 

it behaved as a passive margin, until mid-Cretaceous (Searl, 2007). This excludes the possibility of a 

SW-dipping subduction zone, where oceanic crust was consumed, as proposed by Gregory et al., (1998) 

and Gray et al., (2000) (Searl, 2007). 

In the early-Jurassic, alkaline magmatism ceased, giving way to sea-floor spreading in the Late-

Cretaceous. The evolution of the extrusive sequence (MORB-like to arc/boninitic signatures), together 

with the  petrological and geochemical features of the mantellic and gabbroic sequence and the presence 

of the late intrusive bodies in the MTZ (e.g. Yamaski et al., 2006; Goodenough et al., 2010), sustain, 

until today, a long-lasting and vivid debate regarding the geodynamic setting of the Sumail – whether a 

mid-ocean ridge (e.g. Boudier et al., 1985; Boudier and Nicolas, 1995) or a suprasubduction zone setting 

(SSZ) (e.g. Pearce et al., 1981; Alabaster et al., 1982; Lippard et al., 1986). The first volcanic phase 

(V1), represented by the lowermost Geotimes unit, is attributed to a MORB-like setting or a back-arc 

basin, while the V2 volcanic phase, with arc-like geochemical signatures and the overlying Alley and 

boninitic volcanic rocks reveals an arc-like setting. These variations have been interpreted as a result of 

an intra-oceanic thrusting and subduction initiation, thus modifying the magma source zone.  

The intra-oceanic thrusting has long been understood as the mechanism that enabled the formation of 

the metamorphic sole that underlies the ophiolite (Breton et al., 2004). The metamorphic sole is a 

discrete ~200-300m thick thrust sheet, characterized by an inverted metamorphic gradient, from 

granulites to amphibolite gneisses and green-schist facies metasedimentary rocks at the bottom 

(quartzites, volcaniclastic and carbonates) (Cox, 2000; Searl et al., 2003, Breton et al., 2004; Searl, 

2007). The sole is present at the base of the entire ophiolite and the deformation fabrics are parallel to 

the Sumail thrust (Searl, 1980; Cox, 2000). There is evidence for localized partial melting within the 

sole, with the presence of tonalitic intrusions in the granulitic rocks (Cox, 2000). The heat source for the 

formation of the metamorphic sole is considered to be the downward heat transfer from young and hot 

over-thrusted mantellic rocks (&gt;600ºC) (Ishikawa et al., 2005). Geochemical data from the metabasaltic 

rocks that compose the sole indicates that these rocks are derived from Triasic to Jurassic tholeiitic rocks 

of the Haybi volcanics, as well as MORB-like oceanic crust, that formed the Neo-Tethyan oceanic crust 

(Cox, 2000, Searl, 2007). This intra oceanic thrusting explains the presence of granitic rocks, which 

intrude the mantle and gabbroic sequence of the ophiolite. These peraluminous granitic intrusions are 

derived from a mixed-source, which are the Haiby complex volcanic and sedimentary rocks, preserved 

as green-schists to granulite-facies rocks (Cox, 2000; Searl et al., 2003; Searl, 2007). The fluids released 

from the sole may also explain the geochemical variation of the ophiolite volcanic rocks, due to 

contamination and metassomatic fertilization of the mantle wedge, and thus accounting for the low-Ti 

andesitic volcanism (Alley) and of the boninites found in the volcanic sequence (Ishikawa et al., 2002; 

2005; Breton et al., 2004). Notwithstanding, other authors propose that this geochemical variation is not 

attributed to intra-oceanic thrusting, and consequent arc-formation, but to sea-water contamination into 

residual and shallow peridotitic rocks. The partial (re-)melting of these hydrothermally altered (by sea-

water derived fluids) mantle rocks experience P-T-H2O evolutionary trends that resemble the 



II. GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

 

12 

petrogenetic conditions for andesitic-boninitic magma genesis, usually attributed to subduction zones 

(Benoit et al., 1999; Nonnotte et al., 2005)  

During obduction of the ophiolite, c.a. 95 M.y., the Arabian continental crust was subducted, up to 

depths of about 80km. These rocks were brought into eclogite facies conditions 

(omphacite+garnet+glaucophane+phengite) along with metapelitic rocks (garnet+chloritoid), defining 

a clockwise P-T path, with estimated peak metamorphic conditions of 20-23±2.5 kbar and 540±75ºC at 

82-79 M.y. (Searl and Cox, 1999; Searl et al., 2003, Warren et al., 2005). These HP-LT (High Pressure-

Low Temperautre) rocks, outcropping in the Saih Hatat window, are also associated to blue schists and 

carpatholite-kaolinite schists. In this area (Saih Hatat), the metamorphic grade increases towards NE, 

where the eclogites occur as mafic boudins in the As Sifah sub-window. This subduction was “chocked” 

and exhumation was triggered by the positive buoyancy of the Arabic continental crust, as well as the 

extension of the ophiolite nappe (Cox, 2000; Sear et al., 2003).  

The ophiolite and its coupled metamorphic sole are underlain by sedimentary allochthonous, highly 

imbricate nappes- Hawasina nappes. These consist on Mesozoic hemi-pelagic and pelagic sediments 

that show complex geometries with several evidences of syn-emplacement folding phases, and low-

grade metamorphism (greenschists facies). The Hawasina-nappes are formed by three lower thrust 

sheets of proximal facies turbiditic sediments with a variable, usually kilometric, thickness with minor 

limestone breccias, pelagic sediments, basaltic sills and volcanic layers (Lippard et al., 1986). It is 

divided into four different formations: the Halfa and Haliw formations, the lower and more deformed, 

consisting in highly deformed upper Triasic to lower-Cretaceous cherts and thin pelagic limestones; 

Permo-Triasic limestones, the Oman Exotics; redeposited upper Triasic limestone breccias and pelagic 

sediments from the Al Aridh formation (Lippard, et al., 1986; Cox, 2000). 

The Batinah nappe is structurally overlying the Sumail mantelic and crustal ophiolitic sections, although 

it is accepted that this group (Batinah group), divided in a lower, Triasic to Jurassic portion- Sakhin-, 

and upper, early/mid-Jurassic to Cretaceous- Salahi-, was part of the Hawasina allochthonous; initially 

overridden by the ophiolite, it was thrusted above the Sumail during the last stages of the emplacement 

(Cox, 2000).  

The combination of the isostatic rebound and the emplacement of the nappes resulted in a marine 

regression, exposing the ophiolitic sequence. Hence, a late Maastrichtian unconformity is found, 

overlain by rudist-bearing beach deposits and later (Paleocene to mid/late Eocene) shallow marine 

fossiliferous carbonates. This carbonate sedimentation prevailed until the Oligocene, with marine 

carbonates (Lippard et al., 1986).  

In the Miocene, the uplift related deformation phase, warped the whole sequence into large scale open 

folds, caused by a biaxial compression. Following the deformation phase, an erosional event lasted until 

the Anthropocene, with the formation of thick piedmont deposits, alluvial, coastal, aeolian, Sabkah 

deposits (Bathinah coast deposits) and over 4km of cenozoic molasses representing ~100 000km
3
 of 

sediments (Lippard et al., 1986). 

Nevertheless, some questions remain unsolved, especially regarding the driving mechanisms that 

explain the transition of the passive margin to an active margin, with the obduction/subduction of the 

Hawasina oceanic crust and the lead edge of the Arabian plate, respectively. Despite this, some authors 

related this transition of kinematic change in the plates movement with the anticlockwise rotation of the 

African plate, associated to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, during the Cretaceous (Coleman, 

1981; Michard et al., 1991; Breton et al., 2004; Burg, 2015). Other topics, such as the geochemical 

variation of the extrusive sequence and its geodynamic setting remain widely debated and unsolved.

II.2. VOLCANOSTRATIGRAPHY, TECTONIC SETTING AND MS ACCUMULATION 

The volcanostratigraphy of the extrusive sequence of the Sumail ophiolite has long been studied and 

debated. The volcanic sequence is made up of different volcanostratigraphic units formed in overlapping 

volcanic centres, in a set of spreading axis, and later off-axis setting. The majority of the research was 

developed in the northern part of Oman, where the volcanic sequence is best exposed, aiming to define 

a group of mappable and distinct volcanic units, with distinctive features. Alabaster et al. (1982) defined 

five different volcanic units in the Bayda-Aarja-Lasail area and provided field, petrographic and 

geochemical criteria to distinguish them. Several authors have claimed that the field criteria is 

insufficient to distinguish them outside the same area, mapped by Alabaster et al. (1982). None of the 

later works on the volcanostratigraphy of the ophiolite defined more than five different units. In 2003, 

Godard et al. proposed a new classification, defining three different volcanic units based on geochemical 

data and paleomagnetic data, correlating its volcanic units with the ones defined by Alabaster et al. 

(1982). Nonetheless, the volcanostratigraphy proposed by Alabaster et al. (1982) remains as the most 

widely accepted and applied. This volcanic sequence is thus divided into five different units: 

I) Geotimes, the lowermost unit, directly overlies the co-magmatic sheeted dyke complex. It is 

composed of 0.75-1km thick sequence of aphyric tubular basaltic to occasional andesitic large pillow 

lavas with subordinated aphyric massive flows, pillow breccias and hyaloclastites (Figure II.4 [D]). The 

red/brownish hematitic alteration is one of the diagnostic field criteria. Geochemically, these lavas are 

slightly depleted in incompatible elements compared to N-MORB, namely HFSE such as Nb and Ta.  

(Alabaster et al., 1982; Lippard et al., 1986; Godard et al., 2003; Gilgen et al., 2014). 

II) The Lasail unit comprises grey to pale greenish, basaltic to andesitic smaller pillow lavas and 

frequent massive flows with porphyritic texture- olivine, clinopyroxene and plagioclase phenocrysts- 

with a thickness of ~0.75km. The lavas are depleted in LREEs and incompatible elements, compared to 

N-MORB and the concentrations in Zr and other refractory elements are lower than Geotimes’ lavas. 

Alabaster et al. (1982) noted that the Lasail unit is only present in some areas of the ophiolite and 

interpreted them as seamounts, overlying the Geotimes unit, whereas Godard et al. (2003), considered 

the Lasail equivalent unit (V2-1) to be present throughout the entire ophiolite. Alabaster and Pearce 

(1985) defined the transition of Geotimes/Lasail as transitional and Kusano et al. (2012) described 

Geotimes and Lasail unit as being interdigitated, considering Lasail a sub-unit of Geotimes (Kusano et 

al., 2012; Gilgen et al., 2014). 

III) The Alley unit includes a ~0.75km thick sequence of grey or brown-coloured, meter-sized 

amygdaloidal microporphyritic basaltic to rhyolitic pillow lavas that overlie the Lasail and, sometimes, 

the Geotimes unit. These amygdules and vesicles are commonly filled with zeolites and celadonite, the 

clinopyroxene and plagioclase microphenocrysts sometimes developing glomerophyric textures. Poly 

and monomict breccias are common. They are characterized by a REE pattern similar to Lasail’s with 

slighter higher REE concentrations. Geochemically, the distinction between Lasail and Alley consists 

in the latter having lower Cr concentrations and higher Zr contents. 

IV) The clinopyroxene-phyric unit occurs as small basaltic porphyritic flows with abundant 

clinopyroxene phenocrysts. They show low Zr and Ti concentrations and high Cr contents. 

V) The Salahi unit comprises alkaline to transitional massive thick flows, that regularly form joint 

columns and occurs only at one location. 

Ishikawa et al. (2002) reported boninitic lava outcrops, associated to Alley lavas, and recent 

volcanostratigraphic reviews (e.g. Gilgen et al., 2014) found them to have a widespread and regional

extent, defining the Boninitic Alley unit. The question remains, whether he boninite occurrences belong 

to the same unit or not. In general, they are vesicular pillow lavas and massive flows, several meters 

thick, with porphyritic texture. The phenocrysts and microphenocrysts are composed of orthopyroxene, 

clinopyroxene, olivine and chrome-spinel. This Boninitic Alley unit is macroscopically and 

mineralogically similar and equivalent to the clinopyroxene-phyric unit, defined by Alabaster et al. 

(1982). 

These new volcanostratigraphic reviews (Gilgen et al., 2014) distinguish four main volcanic units, 

comprising, from bottom to top, the Geotimes, Lasail, Alley and Boninitic Alley units, which correspond 

to the division accepted and followed in this work (Figure II. 5). 

The Geotimes unit erupted in a fast spreading ridge setting (Alabaster et al., 1982; Lippard et al., 1986; 

Kusano et al., 2012; Gilgen et al., 2014). The nature of this spreading ridge is under debated: a typical 

mid-ocean ridge (Boudier et al., 1997; Godard et al., 2006) or a suprasubduction marginal basin 

(Alabaster et al., 1982; Lippard et al., 1986). The Lasail unit shows a transitional geochemical nature, 

between ridge and arc-like geochemical affinity (Alabaster e tal, 1982; Searl, 2007). The more evolved 

compositions suggest an off-axis volcanism, occasionally influenced by on-axis volcanism, resulting 

into the interdigitated of both units (Gilgen et al., 2014), although some authors still debate if their 

geochemical signature marks a SSZ-signature. It is widely accepted that the Alley unit erupted in a 

suprasubduction setting, although the nature of the subduction is itself debated. The more consensual 

idea is that the subduction zone was already established when Geotimes erupted (Alabaster et al., 1982; 

Lippard et al., 1986; Godard et al., 2003). The Boninitic Alley unit is altogether similar to other boninites 

in numerous modern-day tectonic settings related to spreading ridges, like the Neogene boninites in the 

northern termination of the Tonga Trench (Gilgen et al., 2014 and citations therein), interpreted as the 

interference of the NW bifurcation of the Lau spreading ridge with the Tonga trench. Together, the 

Lasail and the Alley unit are considered to form a coherent sequence, as transitional lavas from a N-

MORB-like geochemical signature (Geotimes) to boninitic (Boninitic Alley). Nevertheless, some 

authors propose that this geochemical variation (MORB-like to arc-like signatures) is assigned to a range

the VMS deposits found within that sequence, in their volcanostratigraphic positions. Adapted from Gilgen et al. (2014).

of variation of the peridotitic rocks alteration, induced by sea-water derived fluids, whose partial melting 

generates andesitic-boninitic-lile magmas, as previously mentioned. 

The main horizon for VMS exploration was thought to be the Geotimes/Lasail contact and, to a minor 

extent, the Geotimes-Alley, defining the two major productive periods, in terms of VMS formation 

(Gilgen et al., 2014). The first comprises the period after the Geotimes unit extrusion, in which the 

spreading center and off-axis (sub)volcanic activity acted as heat sources for the hydrothermal 

convection and sulphide precipitation, forming at least 7 MS deposits. The Geotimes eruption was 

intermittent, allowing the formation of, at least, one intra-Geotimes VMS deposit, in the volcanic 

quiescence periods. The Lasail off-axis volcanism later covered some of the deposits. The fact that 

Lasail lavas erupted in a possible off-axis setting, thus lacking a proper heat source, possibly explains 

the absence of intra-Lasail sulphide accumulations. The second major period for sulphide accumulations 

and productive hydrothermal systems to develop initiates with the Alley and Boninitic Alley extrusion. 

The Alley unit eruption covers longer-lived hydrothermal systems that originated deposits hosted in the 

Geotimes-Alley transition but the period between Alley volcanic activity generated at least one major 

sulphide accumulation system- Shinas. The existence of, at least, four major deposits hosted in the 

Boninitic Alley unit shows that the intermittence of this volcanism also allowed several important 

sulphide accumulations. The period between sulphide accumulation and its “sealing” is also accountable 

for oceanic-oxidation events, with the development of oceanic weathering profiles in the sulphide body.  

New-found deposits and the re-examination of the volcanostratigraphic controls of massive sulphide 

occurrences, using clinopyroxene and whole-rock geochemistry, of the footwall and hanging wall of 

several VMS deposits, demonstrates that the idea that there were only two main periods of time for MS 

accumulation is not suitable (Gilgen et al., 2014). Although most of the sulphide ores are, indeed, hosted 

in the Geotimes/Lasail and Geotimes/Alley transition, numerous deposits (including some of the most 

recent discoveries) are hosted within volcanic units, such as the Aswad deposit (Geotimes), Shinas 

(Alley) or the Daris-3A-5, Rakah and Safwa deposits (Boninitic Alley) (Figure II.5). This suggests that 

all hiatus in the volcanic activity (contacts between units, umbers or cherts) represent potential periods 

in which hydrothermal activity and sulphide accumulation was possible, and that horizon may, thus, 

host a MS deposit. 

II.2.1. THE MANDOOS DEPOSIT 

The Mandoos deposit, is found near the Sohar, beneath eight to thirty-four-meter-thick wadi fluvial 

gravels within a volcanic sequence which is not assigned to any volcanic unit, in the volcanostratigraphic 

sequence. The magnetic data recovered from the exploration surveys suggests that this deposit is likely 

to be intra-Alley or hosted within the Lasail volcanic unit, consisting in pillow lavas and massive flows 

(Mawarid Mining, 2014). The massive sulphide body consists of a pyritic mass, including minor 

chalcopyrite and sphalerite, presenting evidence for multiple brecciation events; with a variable 

thickness (up to 60 m thick in the northernmost area, decreasing towards south), extending 250m (in 

length) to the south area, this massive sulphide orebody was interpreted as being formed in a topographic 

depression or a graben, later affected by sea-water oxidation processes. The hydrothermal alteration is 

characterized by the presence of carbonates, albite, chlorite, quartz and smectite (Gilgen et al., 2014). 

Quartz and sulphide veins form a discreet stockwork, within silicified basalts. The hanging wall shows 

less alteration, possibly related to alteration processes distinct from those that acted upon the footwall 

rocks. Like for most of the recently discovered VMS deposits in Oman, there are no detailed studies for 

Mandoos and consistent published data is lacking. Therefore, its size and unknown volcanostratigraphic 

position make it an excelent case study within the Omani scenario, from where a relevant contribution 

to the understanding of mafic hosted-type deposits may be expected.

CHAPTER III  
LABORATORIAL AND ANALYTICAL 

PROCEDURES 

 

The laboratiorial and sample preparation work carried out during this study included several stages: (I) 

drill-core re-logging and sampling; (II) sample lab processing; (III) petrography; (IV) mineral 

chemistry; and (V) whole-rock geochemistry. 

Drill c.ore re-logging and sampling 

Six drill cores were sampled in the Mawarid drill core deposit, in March 2016, representing different 

sectors of the deposit: (I) MD 174 the “central” zone; (II) MD150 and MD178 from the lower/SW 

central zone; and (III) the MD 431, MD430 and MD429 set, located in the most southwestern part of 

the deposit (Appendix I). These were chosen considering drill core availability and good preservation. 

Indeed, drill core deterioration was a major conditioning factor to the sampling objectives. 

Re-logging took place from end of March to mid-April in GUtech facilities. This work made it possible 

to recognize the overall volcanic sequence and to outline sampling targets.  

Sampling aimed to obtain a representative set of samples of both the hanging and footwall volcanic 

rocks: different volcanic- primary and secondary- textures/facies, hydrothermally altered samples and 

(apparently) fresh rocks.  

Some samples collected from the open pit mine by Ana Jesus in May 2015 were also used in this work; 

they represent the northern most portion of the deposit, where the massive sulphide body was thicker. 

Sample preparation 

After collecting the samples, they were processed for the preparation of polished thin sections and 

whole-rock geochemistry, using the SQU and FCUL facilities, from May to September 2016.  

Petrography and mineral chemistry: 

The preparation of thin sections consisted in the following procedure: (1) identification of textural and 

mineralogical features of interest; (2) manufacturing of rectangular slabs, using small diamond saws; 

(3) gluing the rock slabs into un-polished glasse slices, using a two-part resin epoxy resin with high 

refractive index and mechanic resistance; (4) cutting the obtained chips to 0.5 mm thickness, using a 

precision diamond saw; (5) grinding the glued chips, until they reach a 40-45 µm thickness, with an 

automatic lapping equipment; (6) polishing the rock surfaces with ever finer diamond-pastes, until a 

uniformly smooth plane is obtained and a thickness of 30 µm. For some samples, the presence of 

expansive clays/phyllosilicates created various technical problems during the thin section making 

process, posing additional difficulties during the polishing stage.  



III. LABORATORIAL AND ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES 

18 

Whole-rock Geochemistry: 

For the whole-rock geochemistry, a single procedure was used for all the selected samples: (1) cutting 

in thin slabs; (2) emery polishing, eliminating all possible contamination derived from the saw and 

weathering; (3) reduction of the slabs to chip size using a hammer, with the samples wrapped in white 

paper; (4) when necessary, another size reduction using a chromium hardened steel roll mill; (5) 

powdering, using an agate ring mill, when the samples weighted more than 100g or had enough volume 

to fill the space between the agate rings, or using two smaller agate ball mills, if the weight/volume of 

the sample was not enough to use the agate ring mill.  

Petrography  

The mineralogical and petrographic description of the thin sections was made from July until November 

2016, in FCUL facilities.  

This characterization was made using both reflected and transmitted light microscopy, identifying and 

characterizing the mineralogical and textural diversity of the volcanic sequence, with a special emphasis 

on the mineralogical transformations between primary and secondary phases related to oceanic 

metasomatism and hydrothermal activity, synchronous of sulphide deposition. This was documented by 

a set of microphotographs that illustrate the most important and representative mineralogical and textural 

features. 

Based on this petrographic study, a set of representative samples were gathered, to be used for the 

subsequent mineral chemistry studies. 

Analytical conditions 

Electron Probe Micro-Analyser (EPMA) 

The mineral chemistry data was obtained using a set of selected representative polished thin sections, 

which were covered by a 20nm thick carbon coating, in the Electronic Microprobe Lab at FCUL. The 

used equipment was a JEOL JXA 8200 Superprobe, equipped with four wavelength-dispersive 

spectrometers (WDS), six analysing crystals (LIF, LIFH, PET, PETH, TAP and LDED2) and secondary 

and back-scattered electron detectors as well as a coupled energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS). This 

allowed the quantitative, semi-quantitative and qualitative chemical analyses of mineral phases. All the 

measurements were made with a 20 second acquisition time for the peaks, and 5 seconds for the 

background. The accelerating voltage was 15kV, with a current beam of 25nA and a beam spot diameter 

of 5µm. Natural mineral and metallic standards were used as standards. The detection limits for the 

different measured elements, as well as the used standards, can be found in Appendix II 

The main objectives of data acquisition were i) resolution of pending questions about the petrographic 

study, more specifically the identification of mineral phases whose small size and/or occurrence mode 

prevented an unambiguous optical conclusion; (ii) identification of accessory mineral phases, 

impossible to determine properly, under the optical microscope; and (iii) characterization of variations 

in chemical composition exhibited by mineral phases, found in different textural arrangements and more 

importantly by various generations of the same phase, when polishing conditions were adequate.

19 

Whole-rock geochemistry 

Following sample preparation, major and trace were measured using two different methods: I) 

Wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF) for the major elements, at Aveiro University, and; 

2) Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for the measurement of trace elements, at 

CNRS, Tolouse. 

WDXRF: 

Whole-rock major elements were obtained by WDXRF, in Aveiro University facilities, on pressed-

powder pellets, using an Axios Panalytical equipment.  

ICP-MS: 

Whole rock trace elements concentrations were acquired on a HR-ICP-MS ELEMENT XR at the 

Géosciences Environnement Toulouse laboratory (Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées), Université of Toulouse 

III, following the procedure described by Barrat et al. (2007).  Sample preparation consisted of a HF-

HClO4 digestion procedure (Yokoyama et al., 1999) combined with a Tm addition (Barrat et al., 1996). 

The Tm addition allowed the calculation of the trace element compositions based on the Tm positive 

anomaly appearing in the samples REE pattern. Therefore, there is no correction for any elemental loss 

during the chemical procedure. Following digestion, samples were diluted and directly analysed to 

obtain concentrations all trace elements.  BHVO-2 was used as external standard following the values 

proposed by Barrat et al. (2007). The yield was monitored and concentrations calculated using the Tm 

anomaly (Barrat et al., 1996). MG-PMS and UBN geostandards were measured using the same 

procedure. Analytical blanks are systematically subtracted to BHVO2 and samples cps.

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE VOLCANIC SEQUENCE: 

HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES AND 

PETROGENETIC CONSIDERATIONS 
 

IV.1. PETROGRAPHY: TEXTURAL AND MINERALOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION 

In this section, the microscopic textural and mineralogical features are described, using the macroscopic 

and microscopic observations and a set of illustrative microphotographs, supplemented by EPMA data. 

The volcanic rocks that host the Mandoos MS deposit comprise a set of basaltic rocks that display 

numerous evidence of regional metasomatic and ore-forming hydrothermal (s.s.) alteration. The textural 

arrangements of secondary mineral assemblages document the progression of fluid-rock interactions, at 

different evolving stages, causing heterogeneous alteration patterns.  

Hanging Wall 

The hanging wall rocks comprise a set of coherent facies: massive flows and/or massive flows, with 

minor apparent-volcaniclastic/autoclastic facies (see McPhie, 1993), along with basaltic rocks that 

display evidence of different stages of alteration.  

Macroscopically, these rocks are classified as fine-grained vesicular microporphyritic basaltic rocks, 

distinguishable by their colours - resulting from differences in mineralogy, due to alteration (s.l.) 

phenomena - as well as by the presence of vesicle and their infillings and by the relative size and 

distribution of veinlets.  

Overall, primary textures and, to some extent, primary mineralogy, are well preserved. Clinopyroxene, 

minor plagioclase microphenocrysts are set within a fine-grained, microcrystalline plagioclase 

microlitic-lath matrix, partly replaced by secondary mineral assemblages, with abundant primary iron-

titanium oxides. 

The microphenocrysts generally occur as clusters or single crystals of euhedral to sub-euhedral 

clinopyroxene and minor plagioclase. The clinopyroxene crystals, ~600 µm to ~1mm in size, do not 

show zoning and are partly to completely replaced by secondary mineral phases, showing evidence for 

a complex and polyphasic replacement. At first, the clinopyroxene is altered to an amphibole 

(actinolite?), which is subsequently altered to chlorite and epidote. Plagioclase phenocrysts are mostly 

euhedral, ranging from ~0.5 to ~1mm, and are almost completely replaced by albite; early/primary 

plagioclase composition is preserved in patches, and the grains are set in a brownish-greenish 

phyllosilicate-rich groundmass.  

Swallow-tailed plagioclase microlites are also found within the phyllosilicate-rich matrix; these 

plagioclase microlites and matrix alteration are marked by (I) increase of the albitic component in the 

microlites (as documented by EPMA, see Chapter IV.2); (II) pervasive phyllosilicate, and minor epidote, 

alteration, affecting the matrix and early Fe-Mg silicate phases. Iron and titanium primary oxides –

titanium-rich magnetite -are found disseminated within the matrix, between the plagioclase microlites, 

showing corroded outer rims, intergrown with secondary small titanite crystals. 

The abundance of vesicles, size and distribution within the volcanic rocks varies and represents the 

channels generated by volatile escape. These vesicles are filled with secondary mineral phases, 

precipitated during alteration processes. Usually they are rimmed by fine-grained phyllosilicates and 

filled with radial aggregates of the same phyllosilicates, quartz, zeolites and/or carbonates. 

Volcanic glass was found in two samples, in contact with a basaltic rock; this glass-basaltic rock 

interface corresponds, probably, to a contact between two different lava flows, where the rapid cooling 

of the base of the latter inhibited crystallization and, consequently, fostered the formation of volcanic 

glass. This volcanic glass shows devitrification textures -– spherulites –  and aligned vesicles, mostly 

filled with phyllosilicates. The latter are also found replacing the volcanic glass, suggesting that the 

brownish groundmass observed in other volcanic rocks matrix is a result of volcanic glass alteration. 

Partly altered clinopyroxene and plagioclase microphenocrysts are also found within the volcanic glass, 

as well as hematite sealing microfractures.  

Monomict autoclastic breccia rocks occur within the hanging wall volcanic sequence. These consist of 

basalt pseudo-clasts surrounded by a micro to cryptocrystalline pseudo-matrix, composed of chlorite, 

quartz and minor carbonates. Although the primary igneous texture is still recognizable, the basalt 

pseudo-clasts show evidence of strong alteration: intense albitic replacement, in plagioclase, and strong 

phyllosilicates deposition, although preserving relics where the early breakdown of pyroxene into 

amphibole, preceding the formation of Chl+Ep, can still be seen. The intensity of this alteration increases 

towards the pseudo-matrix, blurring the contact between both; in other cases, the (-pseudo-)clast/matrix 

contact is outlined by late chlorite aggregates or by microfractures filled with carbonates. This reflects 

the distribution of fractures, generated by in-situ fragmentation, allowing an increase in the permeability 

and, consequently, an increase in fluid circulation. Thus, these samples might represent the top of 

massive flows/pillow lavas, where quenching favoured fragmentation and fluid circulation. 

The hanging wall volcanic sequence is crosscut by a series of late veinlets, with different mineral infills: 

(I) early (calcic) zeolites, with calcite intergrowths; (II) abundant calcite, with minor zeolites, whose 

deposition is correlative with brecciation episodes, possibly synchronous of the late events of vesicle 

infilling; and (III) minor late, fine-grained, chlorite and quartz or carbonate.  

During the final stages of carbonate precipitation, hematite occurs, sometimes, developing intergrowths 

with calcite and chlorite. Otherwise, hematite precipitation is controlled by structural discontinuities 

(fractures and veins/veinlets) and sometimes its deposition occurs together with microcrystalline 

silica/quartz. Hematite also occurs widely disseminated in the basaltic rocks, transposing the primary 

texture. In these situations, the volcanic primary texture is only recognizable by the occasional presence 

of primary clinopyroxene and minor plagioclase microphenocrysts. This pervasive hematitic alteration 

is also associated with the deposition of jaspers and umbers, which can be later crisscrossed by 

anastomosed carbonate and minor chlorite veins, with associated brecciation. 

It is important to highlight the absence of sulphides in the hanging-wall sequence, whether disseminated 

within the matrix, vesicles or even in later mineral infills along distinct sets of structural discontinuities 

veins/sealing, indicating the absence of mineralizing hydrothermal (s.s.) processes.

Footwall 

The footwall volcanic sequence is mostly composed of basaltic rocks, with primary textures almost 

completely obliterated, documenting an intense and possibly long-lasting alteration process. The only 

remnants of the primary mineral assemblage are feldspar microlithic laths. 

Plagioclase microlites show skeletal remains of the primary feldspar crystals, with Na-rich cores and, 

sometimes, intense quartz neo formation, overgrowing the original microlites and/or replacing them. 

Fine-grained chlorite aggregates, with bluish-anomalous interference colours, outline probable remnants 

of ferromagnesian phases (clinopyroxene). This is accompanied by the precipitation of fine-grained 

chlorite and euhedral pyrite crystals, in the rocks matrix; the same paragenesis is found filling vesicles. 

Nevertheless, this mineral association represents the less intense hydrothermal alteration association 

(Chl+Py+Qz) and characterizes the hydrothermal alteration observed in the footwall volcanic rocks 

sampled in the drill-cores. The hydrothermal alteration process is more intense when volcanic rocks are 

more vesicular, due to enhanced fluid circulation, induced by earlier high permeability. Thus, volcanic 

rocks record variable intensity of silicification and chloritization processes, with Na-rich plagioclase 

microlites recording also the effects of the early-developed regional alteration stage, as described before 

(see hanging-wall). The silicifiation ± pyritization processes are more pervasive and intense in the 

basaltic rocks recovered from the open pit, where, in extreme cases of hydrothermal alteration, samples 

are partly to completely replaced by Qz+Py±Ccp±Sph, with greenish, i.e. chloritzed, remnants of the 

basaltic rock and feldspar microlites. These samples are also characterized by an intense brecciation and 

infill by the same mineral association found in the rocks matrix.  

The hematitic alteration described for the hanging-wall volcanic sequence is also present in the footwall 

volcanic sequence. Hematite-impregnated basalts/jaspers/umbers are present in the 

southern/southwestern sampled portion of the deposit, affected by the same hydrothermal processes as 

the basaltic rocks, whereas hematite (±quartz)-bearing veinlets/veins are found throughout the rest of 

the sampled volcanic rocks. Additionally, some hematite veins cut the hydrothermally altered rocks, 

especially noticeable in the open pit samples.  

In the hematite-altered basaltic rocks, and in jaspers, formed prior to the development of the 

hydrothermal system and mineralization, evidence for bleaching processes is seen, adjoining quartz 

veins where the reddish hematite coloration becomes weaker or disappears, accompanied by 

dissemination of small pyrite crystals. Such relationship indicates iron bleaching/leaching and reduction, 

followed by minor sulphide precipitation. 

Four phases of formation of hydrothermal quartz veins can be identified, some of them evidencing 

brecciation that crosscuts the footwall volcanic sequence, as well as re-opening evidences, suggesting a 

tectonic control on the circulation of silica-rich (saturated) hydrothermal fluids. Sometimes, these quartz 

crystals present a mild wavy extinction, revealing sub-granulation, consequence of intra-crystalline 

plastic deformation. Occasionally, these hydrothermal veins are found overlapping, evidencing that 

these veins are reactivated/re-opened and, thus, denouncing a structural control on the fluid circulation.  

The first phase comprises comb-like quartz crystals, and, in the late-stages, chalcopyrite. These are cut 

by a second generation of veins, finer grained, granular quartz crystals, pyrite and chalcopyrite; the latter 

also precipitates in microfractures, outlining first-stage pyrite crystals.  

The third and fourth late quartz generations comprise microcrystalline quartz veinlets/veins, where 

microcrystalline quartz occurs, sometimes as bands, suggesting that deposition was triggered by rapid 

cooling; these bands are subsequently disrupted by an almost orthogonal set of quartz infilled

29 

microfractures, also with no sulphides associated. These quartz bands sometimes have the same 

orientation as previously formed veins, which might indicate re-opening of the structures. 

Late carbonate veins, with minor pyrite, cut the earlier quartz veins, some of which are reopened and 

sealed by Cb+Py. 

The various hydrothermal stages are conspicuous in the more intensely hydrothermally altered rocks 

(open pit samples), and in the hematite impregnated and jasper samples (S/SE drill-core samples), with 

silicification and dissemination of Py, sometimes together with Al-rich phyllosilicates. Thus, it is 

possible to establish a relative chronological relationship for the different hydrothermal stages. In some 

cases, this hydrothermal alteration is epitomized by fine-grained chlorite and/or quartz veins, with 

sulphides, pyrite with minor chalcopyrite, bearing veins and by disseminated, sub-microscopical, 

euhedral to subhedral apatite crystals. This is possibly related to a structural control of the alteration 

processes, suggesting that these mineral assemblages and textural arrangements can be used as proxies 

to the ore-forming system. In some cases, there is an overlap between more than one hydrothermal 

phase, similar to what is observed in the hematite impregnated basalts/jaspers, with the microcrystalline 

quartz bands corroding granular quartz and sulphide veins.  

In samples of the footwall volcanic sequence, fom the open pit, zeolites occur, with quartz, in veins and 

as vesicle infills. Such veins clearly cut the volcanic rocks after its weak to moderate hydrothermal 

alteration (Py+Qz) and they show evidence of reactivation, with hydrothermal microcrystalline quartz 

crystals. 

Doleritic rocks, with well-developed intersertal texture, occur also in the footwall sequence. These rocks 

display a primary mineralogy similar to the one found in the hanging-wall rocks, larger (in comparison 

to the hanging-wall volcanic rocks) primary iron-titanium oxides grains, and sparse clinopyroxene and 

feldspar microphenocrysts; phyllosilicate-filled vesicles occur sparsely. These doleritic rocks show a 

pervasive alteration similar to the one described above, with the breakdown of primary Fe-Mg phases 

and intense phyllosilicate alteration, demonstrating that these rocks underwent a similar fluid-assisted 

alteration process analogous to the one described for the hanging-wall volcanic sequence. Nevertheless, 

some sub-microscopical Py crystals are present, as well as apatite. The presence of such mineral phases 

will be later discussed (see Chapter V). 

 

 

Based on the mineralogical and textural relationships previously described, a paragenetic sequence is 

depicted in Figure IV.8 (see end of section). This is divided into three main alteration stages, the first 

(Alteration stage I) comprising the breakdown of primary igneous phases and vesicle and vein infills, 

evident on the hanging-wall sequence. The second alteration stage (Alteration stage II), found in both 

hanging and footwall rocks consists in a low-temperature hydrothermal alteration, including the 

formation of jaspers and/or umbers, and, occasionally coupled with pervasive hematite dissemination, 

transposing the primary igneous textures. Hydrothermal alteration, related to sulphide deposition 

follows (Alteration stage III), found only in the footwall volcanic rocks, with the development of quartz-

sealed veins, distinguishing different stages, some of them with associated sulphides and, occasionally, 

apatite.

IV.2. MINERAL CHEMISTRY 

This section reports the chemical compositions of the mineral phases, found on the volcanic rocks that 

host the Mandoos massive sulphide. For this, 8 representative thin sections were chosen representing 

the different textural arrangements. This analysis focused on silicates- namely primary phases such as 

feldspars (s.l.) and pyroxenes, or secondary, such as chlorite group minerals, oxides, carbonates, 

sulphides (pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite) and phosphates- apatite. Some of the identified mineral 

phases were not analysed due to their small dimensions or because the polishing was not ideal, the 

obtained results indicating the effects of contamination from the adjacent mineral grain; that was often 

the case of titanite, hematite or magnetite. The data management and processing was based on the 

previous petrographic characterization and it consisted on the confirmation of the mineral phases, 

ensuring that the EPMA analysis were valid and consistent with the mineral stoichiometry. The results 

of this detailed mineralogical characterization will contribute to constrain geochemistry-based models 

for the geological evolution these volcanic rocks and related ore forming processes. 

IV.2.1. SILICATES 

Silicates form most primary and secondary mineral phases in volcanic rocks, both in the hanging and 

footwall rocks. They include pyroxene, feldspar, chlorite minerals, zeolite group minerals, with some 

unidentified phyllosilicates. 

IV.2.1.a. PYROXENES  

In order to characterize the compositional variability of the pyroxene microphenocrysts found in the 

hanging-wall volcanic rocks, 71 analyses were performed, in three polished sections (see Appendix IV). 

Their study followed the recommendations of the pyroxenes CNMMN-IMA subcommittee (Miromoto 

et al., 1988).  

The general group formula is given as ?2(?2+)?1(?2+)?2(2?
4+)?6, in which T represents the 

tetrahedral position, occupied by Si and Al, and M1 and M2 the octahedral coordination positions, where 

divalent (?2+) cations are present (Morimoto et al.,1988).  

The discriminating J-Q diagram (Morimoto et al., 1988) (Figure IV.7), show that all the analysed 

pyroxenes fall into the “quadrilateral” chemical group field, i.e. they have Ca, Mg and Fe as major 

components, displaying also a strong compositional homogeneity. Following the recommendations 

proposed by Moritomo et al., (1988), the use of the Mg2Si2O6 (enstatite) – Fe2
2+

Si2O6 (ferrosilite) – 

CaMgSi2O6 (diopside) – CaFe
2+

Si2O6 (hedenbergite) quadrilateral system allows a chemical 

classification and the evaluation of the variation in the chemical compositions, where the solid solution 

end-members for Ca-Mg-Fe quadrilateral pyroxenes are expressed in % of enstatite 

(En%=100Mg/(Ca+Mg+?Fe), wollastonite (Wo%= 100Ca/Ca+Mg+ ?Fe ) and ferrosilite (Fs%= 100 

?Fe/Ca+ Mg+?Fe), where ?Fe = Fe
2+

+Fe
3
, including also Mn. 

The available data fall within the augitic clinopyroxene compositional field, with an average chemical 

formula En39-54Wo27-43Fs8-23. These pyroxenes are also characterized by low Al and Ti contents (1.22-

4.02; 0.07-0.41 wt%, respectively), typical of tholeiitic rocks (BVSP
1
, 1981). Additionally, Cr contents 

are also low (0.06-1.11 wt%).

IV.2.1.b. FELDSPARS 

Feldspar (s.l.) crystals are the most common primary mineral phase, occurring as minor euhedral 

microphenocrysts and, most commonly, as microlites in the groundmass of volcanic rocks. Its chemical 

composition variation were examined on the basis of 125 analyses in 5 thin sections (see Appendix V). 

The feldspar group are tectosilicates with general formula MT4O8, where T is occupied either by Si
4+ 

or 

Al
3+

 cations; the M position is occupied by Ca
2+

, Na
+
 and/or K+, allowing an incomplete solid solution 

between albite (NaAlSi3O8), anorthite (CaAl2Si3O8) and K-feldspar (KAlSi3O8) (Deer et al., 2008). 

Thus, a compositional classification can be made, using the relative percentage of the three end-members 

(An%, Ab% or Or%; Figure IV.7). 

The analysed feldspars belong to the plagioclase series, i.e. with less than 10% Or%, with two main 

compositional groups, spanning from Ca-rich terms to Na-rich phases: the first comprises the primary 

plagioclase compositions, falling within the bytownite and labradorite compositional field, reflecting a 

primary Ca-rich plagioclase. Primary plagioclases are still found in relic patches within 

microphenocrysts (An70.1-84.9) and microlites (An61.3-71.1). The second compositional group is 

characterized by plagioclase with a higher albitic component (Ab84.7-99.5). This represents the altered 

portion of the feldspar phenocrysts and microlites, in which there is a sodium incorporation, leaving 

cores of Ca-rich primary plagioclase (Figure IV.8).

IV.2.1.c. CHLORITE GROUP 

Chlorite-group minerals are abundant throughout the whole volcanic sequence, having formed in the 

different alteration stages and found in different textural contexts (see Chapter IV.1). Its chemical 

variability was studied; 16 valid analyses were obtained, in 1 polished sections, belonging to the footwall 

volcanic sequence, sampled through the drill-cores (see Appendix VI). Due to the poor polishing of the 

polished thin sections, as previously mentioned, most of the performed analysis were considered as not-

valid. Additionally, only the chlorite crystals found as vesicle infills exhibited appropriate dimensions 

and polishing to obtain acceptable analytical results. 

Chlorites are characterized by a wide range of compositions, with a general crystallchemical formula 

(??

?? (??4?? ???

2+ position is usually occupied by Mg, Fe

Ni, Zn and ?3+ by Al, Fe3+ and Cr; u+y+z=6 and z=((y-w-x))?2 and [  ] represents octahedral structural 

vacancies (Caritat et al., 1993). Chlorite structure is characterized by alternating octahedral-positive 

brucite layers and tetrahedral-octahedral-negative talc-like layers in 2:1 proportion (Caritat et al., 1993). 

The analysed chlorite grains are characterized by a wide variability of SiO2 Al2O3 and MgO, with Ti and 

Cr as main trace elements. 

The compositional variability of chlorite minerals can be explained by three substitution processes. I) 

the most common substitution found in chlorite minerals, the Tschermak exchange/substitution (TK), 

consists in the redistribution of charges between the tetrahedral and octahedral sites, but maintaining the 

overall charge balance given by ???? ???? (??, ??2+)?1

structural vacancies, given by ???? ???? [  ]?? (??, ??2+)?2
?? ; and III) the FM substitution, given by 

?????1 (Zane et al., 1988).  

In most of the analysed chlorites almost no Fe

is present. It is also interesting to note that there is a 

positive correlation between (Al+2Ti+Cr)

 vs ? ?? (Figure IV.9 [A]), highlighting the influence 

of the TK substitution in the chlorites composition. Furthermore, the positive correlation between

- (2[  ])VI (Figure IV.9 [B]) shows that the di-octahedral substitution (AM) is also 

one important mechanism that controls these chlorites chemical composition. Thus, these common 

substitutions cause deviations from the chlinochlore-chamosite compositions 

[(Mg5Al)(Si3AlO10)(OH)8], to more sudoitic compositions (Figure IV.19 [D]). 

Chlorites chemical composition is recognized to be influenced by temperature, pressure and other 

physical-chemical parameters, hance its use as proxies for inferring such conditions, especially 

regarding the temperatures at which the mineral was formed. Thus, the chemical composition of chlorite 

serves as basis of several geothermometers; these can be divided into two different groups: I) empirical 

geothermometers, initially proposed by Cathelineau and Nieva (1985) and Cathelineau (1988), and later 

updated by several other authors, accounting for the cation exchanges between octahedral positions, 

producing better results (Jowett, 1991; Kranidontis &amp;amp; MacLean, 1987). They are based on the empirical 

relationship between ????  with temperature, based on observations for present-day active geothermal 

systems. Thus, these empirical models are often flawd, since they are only valid for minerals formed in 

equilibrium with the fluid, posing problems to long-lived and multistage paleo-systems. Additionally, 

some authors denote that the use of empirical geothermometers do not consider the bulk-rock 

composition as a factor controlling chlorites chemical composition (Bourdelle et al., 2013); and II) 

(semi-)thermodynamic-based geothermometers, which offer better and more precise results, considering 

other parameters that control chlorites chemical composition. However, there are some uncertainties in 

these models, regarding the P-T data for the calibration of these models, innacuracies of the 

thermodynamic properties of chlorite solid-solution models and difficulties in the measurement of 

Fe
3+

and accounting for it in the solid-solution models. Nevertheless, various models with a (semi-

)thermodynamic base have been proposed (e.g. Walshe, 1986; Inoue et al., 2009; Bourdelle et al., 2013). 

Thus, for the calculation of the temperature of chlorite formation, the calculations were made using the 

above mentioned geothermometers (Figure IV.9 [E]). The Jowett (1991) and Bourdelle et al. (2013) 

empirical and thermodynamic-based geothermometers, respectively, were chosen as the most 

appropriate ones: the first - Jowett’s empirical model – due to the fact it offers the best approximation 

and better results, for empirical geothermometers, while the use of Bourdelle et al., (2013) (semi-

)thermodynamic-based geothermometer was used considering it accounts for the whole-rock 

composition as controlling factor for chlorites composition. The analyses of the temperatures obtained 

suggests that these chlorites precipitated from hydrothermal fluids at temperatures between 195 to 

~430ºC; the temperature data distribution is highly assymetrical, hence instead of the average, the 

appropriate measure of central tendency is the median, obtaining a T of 273ºC±13 ºC. It is also possible 

to conclude that the empirical approach yielded the highest values for chlorites, opposed to the (semi-

)thermodynamic-based geothermometer, which produced lower temperatures (Figure IV.9 [F]). It is 

then plausible to ascertain that the temperatures obtained for the empirical geothermometers can be 

considered as the maxmium temperatures for chlorite formation and the thermodynamic-based ones 

allow to obtain the minimum temperatures for chlorite formation, for the same chlorite crystal.

IV.2.1.d. INTERLAYERED CHLORITE-SMECTITE (CHL-SME) 

Interlayered chlorite-smectite are 1:1 mixed-layer chlorite-smectite and/or chlorite-vermiculite. They 

are, by far, one of the dominant type of natural interlayereds that occur in natural systems, in low to high 

temperature conditions, in evaporitic deposits, soils, sedimentary and volcanic rocks, as well as in burial 

diagenetic processes, in fossil or active hydrothermal systems and even in contact or low-grade regional 

metamorphism. In the literature, the overall given chemical formula for interlayered Chl-Sme is 

(??, ??, ?)1?? (??, ??, ??)9?20(??)10 ? ??2?. 

Usually identified by X-Ray Diffractometry, the interlayered phyllosilicates in the present study were 

identified on the basis of their expansive properties and chemical composition of:  

(??, ??, ?)0.141(??6.00, ??2.66, ??0.76) (??6.00, ??1.99)8?20(??)10 ? ??2? (See appendix VII). 

IV.2.1.e. ALUMINIUM RICH-PHYLLOSILICATES 

In the open pit samples, where volcanic rocks exhibit more intense silicification processes, Al-rich 

phyllosilicates are found, together with quartz and pyrite, occurring as fine-grained aggregates. Their 

chemical composition is characterized by low amounts of Mg and Fe, besides Si and Al. (see Appendix 

VIII). The chemical analyses of these phyllosilicates were recalculated on a 9 and 12 oxygens base, but 

they failed to adjust to a specific aluminium phyllosilicate stoichiometry such as illite, montmorillonite, 

halloysite or kaolinite.  

IV.2.1.f. ZEOLITES 

Zeolites are found as secondary mineral phases, filling vesicles or sealing veinlets, along with calcite, 

during the first alteration stages. For the study of their chemical variability, 150 analyses were 

performed, in 4 polished sections, one from the hanging-wall and three from the footwall. Zeolite-group 

minerals are hydrated aluminium silicates with open framework of linked (Si,Al)O4 tetrahedra. This 

framework contains cavities, which are occupied by H2O molecules and non-framework cations; non-

bridging anions can be protonated, becoming OH
-
, or altogether substituted by F

-
 (Armbruster and 

Gunter, 2001).  

The analysed grains are calcic zeolites, with little or no potassium and/or sodium. Although it is possible 

to distinguish different zeolites, based on the chemical analyses alone, it was not possible to assign these 

re-calculated analyses to a specific calcic zeolite stoichiometry, e.g. laumontite, stellerite, scolecite, 

wairakite or epistilbite. This can be interpreted as analytical inacuracy related to volatilization of light-

weight components under the electron beam (Campbell et al., 2016). Nonetheless, two groups of analysis 

can be matched to coincide with epistilbite and laumontite’s stoichiometry, with reasonable confidence 

(Appendix IX).

IV.2.2. CARBONATES 

Carbonates, together with zeolites, hematite and chlorite, trace the late stages of the first alteration 

episode and/or the transition to the second; they occur as well in later re-opening of previous Qz+Py 

veins, together with pyrite, in the hydrothermal (s.s.) mineralizing stage. A total of 129 analyses were 

performed in 3 different polished sections, one belonging to the hanging-wall and two from the footwall 

rocks (see Appendix X). The analyses reveal a strong compositional homogeneity, around calcite ideal 

composition, around (Ca1.76?1.96)??3. Mn occurs as trace-element but no difference was found 

between Mn contents for hanging-wall vs footwall rocks and open-pit vs drill-core samples, despite the 

different textural contexts and the different precipitation episodes. 

IV.2.3. SULPHIDES 

Sulphides are absent throughout the hanging-wall volcanic sequence, but are relatively common mineral 

phases within the footwall volcanic rocks. A total of 305 analyses were performed: 220 in pyrite crystals, 

77 in chalcopyrite and 15 in sphalerite grains (Table IV.I). 

All analysed pyrite crystals are found to have a homogeneous chemical composition, similar to the ideal 

pyrite chemical formula ???2, with ??0.96?0.99?1.97?2.05, showing trace amounts of Co and, sometimes, 

Cu and Sb. This applies to all analysed pyrite crystal, regardless of all the different textural contexts: 

matrix, vesicles and the different pyrite hydrothermal precipitation phases. 

The 82 chalcopyrite analyses also revealed a strong compositional homogeneity, close to the ideal 

composition of this mineral phase. The average composition is given as ??0.98??0.99?2, with systematic 

trace amounts of Mo, Zn and Co, and occasional trace amounts of In, Cd, Ag, Pb, As and Se.

Sphalerite crystals, occurring as (sub)euhedral grains in quartz + pyrite veins and disseminated within 

the matrix, exhibited a predominance of the sphaleritic component (i.e. Zn-rich), with average 

composition of ??0.95??0.03?1, showing trace amounts of Cu.

IV.2.4. PHOSPHATES 

Apatite occurs as an accessory mineral phase in hydrothermally (s.s.) altered volcanic rocks, as small 

crystals, disseminated within the rocks matrix and also in the doleritic rocks. The ideal composition of 

apatite is ??5(??4)3(?, ??, ??), where Ca can be replaced either by monovalent cations, with loss of 

F, OH or Cl, thus developing structural vacancies, or by other divalent cations, or even by trivalent 

cations, with substitution of P by tetravalent anions (Deer et al., 2001).  

The 9 analysed apatite grains are classified as fluorapatites with a chemical composition of 

??4.69?5.05(??4)2.97?3.12?0.42?0.79??0.1625?0.435??0.018?0.194, with Fe, Mg and Na occurring as trace 

elements (see Appendix XI).  

Nevertheless, and despite the limited amount of analyses, the fluorapatites analysed in the doleritic rocks 

are characterized by higher median values of Cl
-
 (0.16 apuf), when compared to the hydrothermally 

altered rocks (0.05 apuf); the latter also show higher OH
-
 contents (0.35 apuf), comparing to the doleritic 

rocks apatites (0.31 apuf). 

IV.2.5. OXIDES 

Iron oxides occur as primary mineral phases in the volcanic rocks (magnetite), as euhedral crystals, 

sometimes with corroded cores and preserved rims, dispersed within the volcanic rocks groundmass, or 

as a secondary mineral phase, sealing veins and microfractures (hematite). As previously mentioned, 

due to poor polishing, analyses of secondary oxides had to be rejected. 

These magnetite crystals are characterized by considerable amounts of Ti and Al, with Mn and Mg as 

trace elements (see Appendix XII). The magnetite analyses were recalculated on a 4-oxygen base but 

magnetite stoichiometry was not obtained, possibly due the low total elemental oxides- lower than 

94.35%., conceivably due to poor polishing conditions.

IV.3. WHOLE-ROCK GEOCHEMISTRY 

A total of fourty one samples, nineteen from the hanging-wall and twenty-two from the footwall, 

representative of the different alteration facies found throughout the volcanic sequence were chosen, for 

major and trace element analysis, with the purpose of characterizing the range of geochemical variability 

of the volcanic rocks, considering the above-mentioned aims for this study (Appendix XIII)  

A correlation matrix, for the major and trace element data was computed and the correlation values (r) 

were considered as i) linear, very good if |r| &gt; 0.95 (for positive and negative correlations); ii) good if 

0.8 ? |r| &amp;lt;0.95, both positive and negative linear correlations, but with some deviations and iii) |r| values 

between 0.75 and 0.8, as probable linear (positive and negative) correlations.  

Expected results were obtained: no significant negative correlations were found, the most important 

positive correlations are as follows, Zn and Cd are found to have a very good correlation, as well as Sb 

with As. Y establishes a very good correlation with the HREE, Zr with Hf and Th and Nb with Ta. Also, 

the HREE show very good correlations amongst themselves and good correlaions with LREE. P2O5 

covaries positively with Nb, Ta and LREE, while K and Ba are characterized by having good linear 

correlations between the two. Cu develops good correlations with As, Ge, Mo, Cd and Tl; while Zn has 

a good correlation with U. Titanium establishes good correlations with Th, Zr, Nb and with most of the 

REEs, Zr with the REEs and Th, Cr with Ni, Co with Se, As with Tl and Pb, Ag with In, Sb, Tl and Pb; 

Cd with U. 

IV.3.1. MAJOR ELEMENTS 

The major element geochemistry data is presented in Harker Diagrams, where Fe2O3, Al2O3, MgO, CaO, 

Na2O, K2O, TiO2 and P2O5 have been plotted against SiO2 (Figure IV.10 (I) and (II)).  

The Al2O3 vs SiO2 plot shows that most of the hanging-wall samples follow a negative linear trend, with 

some dispersion, following a decrease in SiO2 contents and Al2O3 enrichments tendency. This is related 

to the low magmatic differentiation, possibly enhanced during oceanic metasomatic alteration but also 

attributed to the formation of secondary Al-bearing mineral phases in more intensely altered footwall 

samples. Despite this, the difference between the previously described trend, for the hanging-wall and 

this, lies in the distinct nature of the alteration processes that affect the two groups: while oceanic 

metasomatism consists mainly in phyllosilicate formation, therefore there is an increase in aluminium 

contents, the hydrothermal alteration that affects footwall rocks is characterized not only by chlorite 

precipitation but with variable silicification processes, causing an increase in SiO2. One sample deviates 

considerably from these two trends, with lower Al2O3 values and high SiO2 contents and it corresponds 

to a jasper sample, formed during exhalative hydrothermal activity. The plot of Na2O vs SiO2 shows a 

relative linear correlation, with increase of Na2O accompanied by gains in SiO2, related to the 

albitization of the feldspar microlites and microphenocrysts, during oceanic metassomatic alteration and 

also preserved in some footwall volcanic rocks. As for the plot K2O vs SiO2, no linear correlation is 

found, with large dispersions found for the hanging and footwall samples. 

In the Fe2O3 tot vs SiO2 plot it is also possible to distinguish an inverse linear trend, defined by the 

hanging-wall and footwall samples; one of the footwall volcanic rocks is characterized by significantly 

higher contents in Fe2O3tot, possibly related to more intense hydrothermal alteration, possibly related to 

pyritization processes. The exhalate sample thas a considerable increase in Fe2O3 due to the abundance 

of iron oxi-hydroxides. Regarding the CaO vs SiO2 plot, the hanging-wall samples also follow an inverse 

compositional linear trend, with some of the samples of this group defining another trend, characterized 

by lower CaO contents. Even lower CaO values characterize the footwall samples and the jasper sample.

IV.3. WHOLE-ROCK GEOCHEMISTRY 

49 

The trend observed for the hanging-wall samples possibly reflects magmatic trend for these rocks, where 

the alteration of Cpx and the albitization of the plagioclase was possibly compensated by the neo-

formation of secondary Ca bearing mineral phases, such as epidote, carbonates and zeolites, during 

oceanic metasomatism. For the footwall volcanic rocks, the Ca contents are significantly lower, due to 

hydrothermal leaching, which produces rocks with few Ca-bearing mineral phases. The MgO vs SiO2 

can be characterized using a similar reasoning: the recognizable trend reflects magmatic differentiation 

tendency, where the precipitation and neo-formation of Mg bearing minerals (e.g. chlorite) explains why 

both hanging and footwall rocks follow the same trend. 

The P2O5 vs SiO2 and MnO vs SiO2 plots are fairly similar: overall low P and Mn values, for both 

hanging and footwall volcanic rocks, with significant increases in P and Mn in the jasper sample. The 

plot of TiO2 vs SiO2 reveals two distinct trends: one with the increase of TiO2 with SiO2, mostly recorded 

by the hanging wall samples, and likely related to magmatic differentiation and Ti-magnetite formation, 

and a second trend, observed for the footwall and some hanging-wall volcanic rocks, characterized by 

decreases in TiO2, possibly related to those oxides alteration during progressive alteration.

IV.3.2. MINOR AND TRACE ELEMENTS 

Minor and trace elements occur in the primary mineral phases structure and some of them are found to 

have immobile behaviour during alteration. In this section, the variation of minor and trace elements 

will be assessed, using I) REE patterns, and II) Spider diagrams. Some lithogeochemical indices will 

also be used, to evaluate the relationship between mineralogical and geochemical data, thus providing a 

qualitative interpretation of the alteration degree these rocks underwent, as well as a basis for mass 

balance calculations. 

  IV.3.2.2. C1-NORMALIZED REE  

For the C1
2
 chondrite-normalized REE plots (Figure IV.11), samples were grouped according the 

intensity of the alteration exhibited, and the Eu* and Ce anomalies were calculated. The first is 

calculated using the expression ?? ???? = ??? (??? ×??? )
0.5? , and it measures the depletion or 

enrichment, relative to Sm and Gd. The Ce anomaly measures its enrichment or depletion in relation to 

La and Sm, and (?? ?? ?? = 5??? (4??? + ??? )? ), being negative when its value is lower than 1. 

REE patterns for hanging-wall volcanic rock samples (Figure IV.11 [A]), exhibiting only evidence of 

oceanic metasomatic alteration, are characterized by a LREE (~3 to 20× C1) depletion, relative to HREE 

(7 to ~30× C1) – (L?/??)CN?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? = 0,3, an increasing LREE segment and a relative flat HREE pattern. Two 

samples display a mild negative Eu anomaly, otherwise the Eu anomaly is absent (Eu*= 0,804 to 1,097). 

The samples are, overall, characterized by a negative Ce anomaly, expcet for two samples (Ce* = 1.00 

and 1.09), with values spanning from 0.80 to 0.99. Overall, whithin this group it is possible to distinguish 

two sub-groups: one with higher bulk REE and, the other characterized by significantly lower bulk 

contents. 

The second group is composed of the footwall volcanic rock samples which show a lower hydrothermal 

alteration (dissemination of pyrite, incipient chloritization and/or silicification) with common oceanic 

metasomatic alteration evidences, as a well as the low-T hydrothermal episode (hematite-bearing veins) 

(Figure IV.11 [B]). They show a REE pattern similar to the first group, differing on a less steep slope 

of the LREE segment and lower LREE/HREE fractionation ((L?/??)CN?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? = 0,71), although, as a group, 

the REE contents are higher than the first group. Some samples exhibit a negative Ce (0,826 and 0,847) 

and Eu anomaly, in spite of positive-sloped LREE segments. 

The third group (Figure IV.11 [C]) comprises the footwall samples that show the most intense 

hydrothermal alteration (moderate to intense silicification, chloritization and pyrite dissemination) and 

consequently the widest range of variation in their REE patterns (see also Figure IV.12 [C]). The 

fractionation between LREE and HREE becomes less pronounced ((L?/??)CN?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? = 0,693), sometimes 

with mild LREE/HREE enrichments. The Eu anomaly becomes more pronounced, being positive in the 

case of two samples (MD-P2-4-1 and MD-P2-4-2), which also show the lowest bulk REE 

concentrations.  

The typicalREE compositions of N-MORB, E-MORB, OIB, BAAB and, more specifically, Lau Basin’s 

basaltic rocks REE compositions were added (Figure IV.11 [D]) for comparison.  

The studied REE patterns are characterized by overall REE depletions, low LREE/HREE, Eu and, in 

some cases, Ce anomalies. These rocks REE contents are consistent from being relatively evolved, 

derivate liquids from gabbroic rocks, in which plagioclase crystallized, having retained the Eu. They are

altogether similar with present-day back arc basin basaltic rocks (Tonga back-arc) or N-MORB basalts. 

Nevertheless, their overall REE contents are lower possibly result from being derived from a mantelic 

source from which MORB-like melts were previously extracted. Additionally, alteration processes are 

also responsible for REE contents modifications such as bulk REE decrease and development of Ce 

negative anomalies, which indicate that REE were mobile during both sea-water regional alteration, as 

well as during hydrothermal alteration. Additionally, the positive Eu anomaly, seen in the more 

hydrothermally altered samples, translate a direct influence of hydrothermal fluids, typically 

characterized by such Eu anomalies.

IV.3.2.2. SPIDER DIAGRAMS  

Representation of the different elements follows the increasing atomic number growth, from left to right, 

and samples were PM-normalized. They were also grouped according to the criteria previously defined: 

the first group of samples corresponds to the hanging wall rocks that chiefly display the effects of 

oceanic metasomatism. The two other groups comprise footwall samples: the second group comprises 

volcanic rocks with weak hydrothermal alteration, while the third is composed of samples which show 

evidence of more intense and pervasive alteration. This allows the distinction of the geochemical 

signatures and their correlation with each alteration episode. 

Figure IV.12 [A] shows that the hanging-wall volcanic rock samples, which exhibit only oceanic 

metasomatic alteration, show very similar and consistent patterns, with low P values (0.2 to 2× PM), 

Cu and Zn (~1× PM), a positive low-Ti anomaly (2 to 5× PM) and moderate K (3 to ~12× PM) As (~8 

to ~150× PM), Sb (3 to ~16× PM), and Bi (~5× PM) enrichments, as well as Pb (3 to ~17× PM) and 

U (from ~1 to 10× PM). Elements such as Rb, Sr, Ba and REE are also characterized by 1-10xPM 

variations. Conversely, the multi-elemental patterns for these rocks are marked by deep Cr, Ni and Cs 

negative anomalies, with lower-magnitude – and sometimes more variable – Co, Nb, Ta and Th negative 

anomalies, relatively to the PM.  

For the second group (Figure IV.12 [B]), which consists in samples that show evidences of oceanic 

metassomatic alteration (mostly albitized plagioclase), some evidences of the low-T hydrothermal event 

(hematite veins) and of hydrothermal mineralization (disseminated pyrite and incipient to moderate 

silification), the patterns are characterized by identical titanium concentrations (in relation to the first 

group), similar low concentrations in K, P, Cr, Ni and Cs and a substantial variation, i.e. enrichment, in 

Zn (4 to 60 × PM), Cu (2 to 20 × PM), As (~70 to 1000× PM), Cd (~2 to 8× PM), Sb (~7 to 100× PM), 

Pb (~5 to 50× PM) and U (~4 to ~17× PM). 

The patterns for the more hydrothermally altered samples (figure IV.12 [C]) show a slightly wider range 

of variations, for a given element in comparison to the samples pictured in [B]. Ti and P values and the 

Cs negative anomaly are also similar to the one described for the previous groups and the positive 

anomalies evident in the preceding diagrams are present – for K, As, Sb, Ba, Pb, Bi and U – although 

they show a broader range of variation: in the case of Ti, the positive anomaly decreases, whereas Cs, 

Zr and Nb (and, to some extent, Ta) anomlalies become more negative, relative to PM values. Cu, Co, 

As, In, Sb, Pb and U increase prominently in samples that show more intense hydrothermal alteration. 

The two samples with the highest As, Cu and Pb enrichment and the most depleted Sc, Ti, Rb, Nb and 

REE concentrations, show pervasive silicification and pyritization with only small remnants of a 

thoroughly chloritized basalt. The sample with the second highest As, Cu and Pb concentrations 

coincides with the jasper sample, cut by mineralized hydrothermal veins, with Qz, Py and Ccp.  

Spider N-MORB-normalized diagrams were not made, although it is a common practice, since they are 

not found to be useful, as the MORB “group” (N-MORB, E-MORB, T-MORB suites) trace elements 

abundances constitute a complete continuum spectrum of compositions, spanning from the more 

depleted MORB’s to OIB-like REE contents (Hofmann, 2014).  

The mild positive Ti anomaly, together with the negative Co, Ni, Cs and Cr anomalies translate primary 

magmatic trends and are compatible with a basaltic melt, extracted from a MORB-like mantle source; 

the detailed affiliation of these volcanic series will be further explored in section IV.5. These patterns 

also reveal that the rocks hosting the Mandoos deposit experienced several trace-element compositional 

modifications, during the different stages of alteration.  The U, Pb and As positive anomalies, as well as 

those observed for Sb, Rb and Sr are most likely the result of sea-water induced regional alteration

(oceanic metasomatism), since most of these elements are usually mobile in the presence of oxidizing 

fluids. Several other positive anomalies, such as Cu, Zn, Pb, Ba, In and Cd can be explained by the 

influence of hydrothermal ore-forming processes of different intensities.

IV.3.4. ALTERATION INDEXES 

The volcanic rocks that host the Mandoos massive sulphide deposit record mineralogical and 

compositional modifications attributed to different, and superimposed, alteration stages, not all of them 

related with hydrothermal ore forming processes. To geochemically differentiate among the various 

alteration stages, Large et al., (2001) proposed the use of a plot that relates mineralogical transformations 

with geochemical data and the gain/loss of particular elements, during these alteration processes. This 

allows the distinction between alteration stages with metallogenetic significance and regional, 

diagenetic trends. Two indices are proposed: the AI (Ishikawa Alteration Index) and the CCPI (chlorite-

carbonate-pyrite index), each each related with typical mineral assemblages associated with both 

regional/diagenetic processes (e.g. feldspar hydrolysis and albitization during widespread oceanic 

metasomatism) and ore-forming hydrotermal events (e.g. chloritization and pyritization of volcanic 

rocks, closer to the mineralization).  

?? =
100(?2? + ???)

(?2? + ??? + ??2? + ???)
 

???? =
100(??? + ???)

(??? + ??? + ??2? + ?2?)
 

The Mandoos samples in this diagram (Figure IV.16) define a clear trend for some samples related with 

the following compositional modifications: i) chlorite and pyrite (trend 3); ii) carbonate ± sericite (trend 

5) for the hydrothermal trends. As for the diagenetic trends, it is possible to identify the albite-chlorite 

(trend 7) and albite-chlorite-epidote (trend 8) mineral associations. Some dispersions are also observed, 

simulating other compositional tendencies, such as the diagenetic trend 9, possibly resulting from the 

combination of other two, such as the trend 5 and 7. Despite this, there are numerous samples that fall 

within the least altered box, even those that show pervasive hydrothermal alteration. This may be due 

to the superimposed alteration phenomena: e.g. first, a diagenetic trend such as 7 and afterwards, 

hydrothermal ore-forming alteration that follows vector 5.

57 

The use of major and trace alteration indices proposed by Häussinger (1993), together withtogether with 

AI and CCPI (Large et al., 2001) can be a useful tool in exploration surveys, as they discriminate 

different compositional trends, associated to: a) widespread regional alteration effects (Field III); b) 

diffuse and exhalative hydrothermal activity- without associated mineralization (Field I); and c) 

compositional modifications associated to ore-forming hydrothermal systems (Field II). This has been 

successfully applied by other authors in different VMS metallogenetic provinces, such as the IPB 

(Codeço, 2015). These indexes are calculated through the equations:  

??????? =
? ??2?3??? + ??? + ???

? ??2?3 ??? + ??? + ??? + ??? + ?2? + ??2?
 ; 

??????? =
? ?? + ?? + ?? + ??

? ?? + ?? + ?? + ?? + ?? + ??
 

The computed indices for the volcanic rocks that host the Mandoos massive sulphide deposit are 

represented in Figure IV.15: 

These indices yield more interesting results, which follow petrographic evidence more closely. All 

hanging-wall samples, which show no mineralization or hydrothermal activity related to sulphide 

precipitation fall in field III, corresponding to a widespread and regional alteration- oceanic 

metasomatism. Most of the footwall volcanic rocks fall in the upper right corner of the diagram, plot 

with high AImajor and AItrace indexes, within field II, where rocks affected by hydrothermal alteration 

related to ore-forming hydrothermal systems plot. Despite of the good results some dispersion is 

observed, possibly due to a heterogeneous, multi phase alteration history; that is the case of rocks 

displaying less pervasive hydrothermal alteration but still preserving some of the mineralogical aspects 

related to oceanic metasomatic alteration.

. IV.3.5. ELEMENT MOBILITY 

Considering the range of alteration of the studied rocks, it is essential to assess the mobility of some 

elements, especially of trace elements, during the course of the recognized alteration strages. Immobile 

elements can be used for mass balance calculations which are important to quantify mass exchanges that 

occur within alteration zones. Understanding element mobility is paramount to establish mineral 

exploration criteria and for petrological applications, such as determining protoliths and the magma-

type, besides geodynamic/tectonic setting in which the rocks erupted. 

The recognition of metasomatic and hydrothermal (s.l.) alteration processes in the studied rocks 

eliminates the possibility of using LILE elements such as K, Rb, Sr, Eu, Cs or Ba, as their considerate 

mobility during these processes is well documented (e.g. Rollinson, 1993). It is then more useful to use 

HSFE (e.g. REE, Zr, Hf, Ti, Nb, Ta, Pb) since they show relative immobile behaviour during alteration 

phenomena (Rollinson, 1993). Some authors select REE, Ti, Zr, Al, Hf, Y, and in some cases, Cr, V and 

Sc, as the least mobile elements (e.g. McLean &amp;amp; Kranidiotis, 1987; McLean, 1990; Barret &amp;amp; McLean, 

1994). Despite of the overall evidence, it has been reported (e.g. McLean &amp;amp; Barret, 1993), that Y and 

REE may be fairly mobile under some specific conditions (in comparison to other HSFE), reason why 

it is advisable to test their behaviour. The basis for the use of immobile elemens is that their ratios will 

remain constant throughout any alteration process the rocks may undergo. 

The TiO2 vs Zr (Figure IV.16 [A]) plot reveals a well-defined trend, especially for the hanging wall 

samples, between two extreme positions, probably recording their primary compositions. Regarding the 

plots Zr vs Al2O3 and TiO2 vs Al2O3 (Figure IV 16 [C] and [B], respectively) a wide dispersion is 

recorded, being wider for the hanging-wall samples. The normalization of immobile elements allows to 

remove the dispersion effects during multiple alteration processes, allowing to devise trends more 

clearly. Hence, the use of Al2O3/TiO2 vs Zr/TiO2 plot should be useful in the distinction of different 

igneous protoliths. The interpretation of the Figure IV.16 [D] suggests that the previously observed 

dispersion (Figure IV.16 [B]) is due to the mobility of this element (Al) during alteration processes, 

rather than due to the existence of different compositional protoliths.

59 

Binary plots for HFSE, REE, Y and Fe against TiO2 and Zr (Figure IV.17) reveals that, in addition to 

Al, such elements as Fe, Ba, Y, Co and to less extent La, show some mobility, especially during the 

most intense hydrothermal alteration processes. Thus, V, together with Sc and Fe2O3 chiefly show 

mobile behaviour, especially during metasomatic alteration but also during hydrothermal alteration. 

Similarly, Ba and Y are also mobile, but in this case, more so during hydrothermal alteration processes. 

It is also possible to conclude that elements such as Zr, Ti, Hf and Ta show an immobile behaviour, 

whereas elements such as Nb, Y or Yb showing an overall immobile behaviour but, under certain 

alteration conditions, they can show be mobile.

I.V.3.5. MASS BALANCES 

Mass balance calculations are extremely important to characterize the alteration processes the rocks 

underwent. This is useful in the definition of proxies for mineralized, productive hydrothermal systems 

during exploration surveys. Using the procedure reported in MacLean (1990) procedure, also indicated 

in MacLean and Barret (1993) and Barret (2008), the elemental mass balance calculations were made 

using the expression: 

?? = ?(?,???????) ?
? ??,????????? ; 

?(?,???????) ?
=   ? × ??,??????? ; 

? = [?????????,????????? /?????????,??????? ] 

where ?(?,???)?
 represents the concentration of a given element (x) in the altered rock, multiplied by an 

? factor, which represents the ratio between an immobile element in the precursor and the concentration 

of the same immobile element, in the altered sample. For these calculations, ? was calculated using TiO2 

and Zr previously proved to be immobile (see IV.3.4).  

The precursor composition was obtained by calculating the average values of the elemental 

concentrations for samples MD431-42.1 and MD431-91.0. These samples represent rocks with less 

intense metasomatic alteration, amongst the studied hanging-wall volcanic rocks. This chosen precursor 

composition bears, nonetheless, some alteration which cannot be quantified. Despite the mass gains 

related with the infilling of vesicles and veins, such alteration probably resulted in a negative mass 

balance, related to the alteration of primary igneous phases and leaching of some mobile elements.   

The mass balance calculations considered the alteration of the calculated precursor for the different 

hydrothermal “facies”, throughout the whole sampled area based on their intensity, mineralogy and 

location. Thus, four samples from the open pit were used (group 1): i) two samples showing weak to 

moderate hydrothermal alteration, with pyrite dissemination, mild silicification, Zeo+Qz veins and 

zeolites infilled vesicles, with preserved albitized microlites in the rocks matrix (MD-P2-8-1 and MD-

P2-9-1); ii) one sample showing moderate to strong hydrothermal alteration, related to the sulphide 

mineralization, with moderate silicification, pyrite, chalcopyrite and sphalerite dissemination (MD-P3-

1-1); and iii) one sample showing intense hydrothermal alteration and brecciation, with quartz and 

sulphides (Py, Ccp, Sph) replacing the basaltic rock and infilling veins, where chloritized, silicified cores 

are preserved (MD-P2-4-1). Additionally, three samples from the SSW area of the deposit were also 

used to establish mass balance calculations (group 2): MD431-121.7, MD430.127.7 and MD430-126, 

characterized by increasing hydrothermal alteration, and showing dissemination of pyrite, chloritization, 

weak silicification and scarse Qz+Chl+Py±Ccp±Sph veins.  

The use of Zr and Ti in the calculations of the ? factor provided similar results, with some variations, 

especially in the case of the sample MD-P3-1-1, belonging to the first group. In the other samples, the 

calculations are consistent. It is also important to note that the use of Zr, for the ? factor calculations, 

result in higher values (losses or gains) than when TiO2 is used with the same aim. Thus, the following 

reported values refer only to the results obtained while using Zr:  

Although the following calculations relate only to the mass exchanges associated to the hydrothermal 

alteration, it is possible to infer on the volume changes, associated to the hydrothermal alteration, based 

on the obtained ? factor. Overall, for the samples that exhibit a less intense hydrothermal alteration, 

from group 1 and group 2, the ? factor indicates volume loss (?= ~0.5-0.8), possibly related to the 

chloritization processes, and to the leaching of mobile elements, while the samples from these two 

groups that exhibit a more intense and pervasive hydrothermal alteration are characterized by volume 

increases (?= 1.3; 1.4; the sample MD-P2-4-1 exhibits a ? of 12), related to the silicification processes

62 

and, especially valid for MD-P2-4-1, related to the fracturing and brecciation episodes, with 

hydrothermal infills. 

Considering the samples from the SSW part of the deposit (group 2), mass calculations were used to 

quantify the hydrothermal alteration elemental exchanges that occurred during hydrothermal alteration 

(Figure IV.18 (I) [A]). Overall, these rocks record loss of Na2O, K2O, MnO and SiO2 gains, while the 

sample MD431-121.7 shows SiO2 loss, of around 9.8-6.62 wt%. For the least hydrothermally altered 

rocks, MgO, CaO, Al2O3 and Fe2O3 are lost, whereas the sample with the strongest hydrothermal 

alteration evidences show significant gains for the same elements, around 5-7 wt%. All samples are 

enriched in Cu around 100-156 ppm, the one with more intense hydrothermal alteration further showing 

Zn gains, with a magnitude order in the tens of ppm. Other trace elements show relatively small 

negatives mass balances, such as Sc, Ni, Rb, Cr and Sr. Others, such as Co, show depletions in the least 

hydrothermally altered sample of approximately 4-6 ppm but mass gains characterize the other two.  

As for the open pit samples (Figure IV.18 [B]), the two samples characterized by weak silicification, 

show very similar negative mass balances, characterized by losses in Na2O, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, CaO, 

MnO and Fe2O3, up to 11 wt%. Both samples are found to have considerable gains (tens to hundreds of 

ppm) in Zn, as well as As and Pb. Sample MD-P2-9-1 shows a small decrease in Cu, whereas MD-P2-

8-1 is characterized by positive Cu mass balance (? 110ppm). These two samples also show depletion 

for Ba. For the rest of the trace elements (e.g. Sr, Ba, Bi) the mass balance is, overall, negative. The 

samples which show a more intense hydrothermal alteration (MD-P3-1-1 and MD-P2-4-1) show 

variable results: regarding the sample MD-P3-1-1, the mass balance results differed when using Zr or 

TiO2. Using Zr, the mass balance result in losses in Na2O, CaO, up to 4%, in Cr, Ba, as well as Sr and 

Rb. Such mass balances are also responsible for gains in MgO ? 10 wt%, Al2O3 ? 19 wt%, SiO2 ? 46 

wt%, Fe2O3 ? 6 wt%. These are accompanied by additions in Cu ? 0.1 wt%, Zn ? 0.05 wt%, V ? 275 

ppm and small gains (up to dozens of ppm) in Y, Ge, Nb, Ni and Ag. However, for the same sample, 

when TiO2 is used in the calculations, the resulting mass balance calculations are different: Na2O 

depletion is of the same magnitude (? 2%), which is also valid for MgO (? 1.8 wt%) and K2O (? 0.6 

wt%), but additional depletions are also evidenced, in Al2O3 ? 2.9 wt%, SiO2 ? 19 wt% and Fe2O3 ? 5 

wt%. Cu and Zn additions are lower than those obtained using Zr (? 317 and 133 ppm, respectively), 

with comparable Cr, Sr and Ba mass losses. Finally, for the most altered sample (MD-P2-4-1), the 

calculated mass balances are characterized by considerable additions in SiO2, Al2O3, MnO, Fe2O3. This 

sample is also characterized by significant gains in Cu (11 wt%) and Zn (0.15 wt%), as well as increases 

in As (0.3 wt%), V, Co, Pb, Sr and Ba (hundreds to thousand ppm), In, Sn, Tl and Cd (tens of ppm).  

These mass balances results represent heterogeneous alteration processes: while the majority of the 

negative mass balances can be explained by the breakdown of primary igneous phases and generation 

of secondary minerals, such as phyllosilicates, carbonates, epidote and/or titanite, the mass gains 

associated to hydrothermal activity are restricted to samples where the hydrothermal alteration is more 

intense. In hydrothermally altered samples, the gains in Fe are generally accompanied by conspicuous 

additions in Mg, representing the formation of secondary phyllosilicates or the influence of diluted 

hydrothermal fluids, possibly result of mixtures between ascending hydrothermal fluids and sea-water. 

This Fe and Mg addition is only absent in MD-P2-4-1, which represents an area adjacent to the 

mineralization, where gains in Si and Fe, associated to high Cu, Zn, As, Sr and Ba mass increases, are 

not accompanied by Mg, reveal the influence of non-diluted, metal-rich, hydrothermal fluids. The 

additions of calcophile elements such as In, Cd and Sn, for more intense hydrothermal altered samples 

may also reinforce the possibility of a late-stage magmatic input for the hydrothermal fluids. 

Additionally, there are no litogeochemistry data for basaltic samples affected by the hematite 

impregnation, associated to the jaspers and umbers deposition (see Chapter IV.1). Based on the 

petrographic evidences, this low-temperature exhalative hydrothermal episode is most likely 

characterized by positive mass balances, with considerable gains of Fe±Mn, as well as Mg, Ca, 

associated to the precipitation of chlorite and carbonates, respectively.

I.V.3.6. COMPOSITIONAL CLASSIFICATION, VOLCANOSTRATIGRAPHY AND TECTONIC SETTING 

Several classical geochemical diagrams can be used both for classification of volcanic rocks and for 

discriminating geotectonic eruptive settings. The total alkali-silica (TAS) diagram, distributes volcanic 

rocks into 15 different compositional fields, from primitive to more evolved and discriminates alkalik 

and sub-akalic series., using the total silica and alkali content (SiO2 vs Na2O + K2O) (LeBas, 1986). The 

application of the TAS diagram is thought to be inefficient for the classification of highly 

hydrothermally altered or metamorphosed volcanic rocks as it is based on a set of elements which are 

mobile during such processes. Hence, a series of similar diagrams, especially useful for altered volcanic 

rocks were developed, using immobile elements as proxies for the classification. The adaptation of Floyd 

&amp;amp; Winchester’s diagram (Floyd &amp;amp; Winchester 1977) proposed by Pearce (1996) remains one of the 

most widely used tools, using the the Zr/Ti ratio as a measure of the primitive character of volcanic 

rocks (basic vs acid) and Nb/Y to distinguish between tholeiitic vs alkalic affinities. In the TAS diagram 

(Figure IV.19) most of the samples fall within the basalt, basaltic andesite or andesite fields, the 

dispersion probably resuting from the alteration procsses rather than from magmatic differentiation. 

Here, the term "andesite" has been applied to rocks of intermediate composition, and not used in its 

more usual petrogenetic meaning of rocks related to active oceanic-continental margins, which is not 

the case of the Sumail ophiolite. For the Zr/Ti vs Nb/Y plot, the samples fall within the basalt and alkali 

basalt fields. The samples falling within the alkali basalt field show more intense hydrothermal 

alteration which is consistent with the previously shown minor mobility of some of these elements (Nb, 

Y) under extreme hydrothermal alteration (see Chapter IV.3.4). Hence, it is possible to infer that the 

volcanic rocks that host the Mandoos deposit are basic to intermediate, basaltic rocks, with tholeiitic 

affinities (Figure IV. 19 [C] and [D]).

Trace-element and/or immobile element criteria have sometimes been used to distinguish the different 

volcanic units of the Sumail ophiolite. Besides the C1-normalized REE patterns and incompatible 

elements (“spider diagrams”), HSFE ratios, such as the Zr/Hf or Nb/Ta ratios, are found to be useful 

(e.g. Godard et al., 2003 2006) (Figure IV.20). Some alternative methods to distinguish volcanic units, 

namely those based on clinopyroxene chemistry (e.g. Ishikawa et al., 2002; Kusano et al., 2012; Gilgen 

et al., 2014) have been proved unreliable by published data.

Using some of these plots (Figure IV.20 &amp;amp; IV.21), the hanging-wall and some of the footwall samples 

fall within the Lasail field; additionally, some dispersion is observed for the footwall volcanic rocks 

which exhibit less intense hydrothermal alteration processes. Furthermore, the HSFE ratios (Table IV.3), 

the REE patterns and the Nb and Ta concentrations (section IV.3.2) of the hanging-wall basaltic rocks 

are also consistent with those described for the Lasail unit (Godard et al., 2003, 2006; Kusano et al., 

2012). Despite some differences in their REE patterns, the average HSFE ratios of the footwall and 

hanging-wall volcanic rocks are rather similar. The differences possibly result from the more intense 

alteration processes in these rocks, and it will be discussed ahead, especially for the REE patterns (see 

Chapter V). Thus, considering the HSFE ratios and, especially the REE patterns, both the hanging and 

footwall volcanic rocks are attributed to the Lasail volcanic unit.

The use of Th/Nb and V/Ti ratios (Pearce, 2014) in the Th/Yb vs Nb/Yb, V vs Ti plots are useful to 

discriminate the possible tectonic settings of ophiolites, particularly SSZ ophiolites (e.g. Pearce, 2008, 

2014). The first plot (Th/Yb vs Nb/Yb) is based on Th and Nb incompatibility and their distinct mobility 

during metassomatism. Since Th is mobile during the dehydration of the subducting slab, but Nb is not, 

suprasubduction lavas are characterized by higher Th values, in comparison to Nb (Pearce et al., 2008). 

The second plot (V vs Ti), from Shervais (1982) is based on the difference in the Ti and V contents and 

relies on their incompatibility: in water-induced partial melting, magmas are richer in V and have lower 

Ti contents. In Figure IV.22 [A], both the hanging and footwall rocks that host the Mandoos deposit are 

found to have higher Th/Yb values compared to MORB, possibly indicating a modification of the mantle 

source, by subduction-derived fluids. These values are higher for the hanging wall volcanic rocks and 

present a wider dispersion for the footwall rocks, possibly due to the hydrothermal alteration, during the 

mineralizing episode(s). This data is also supported by the N-MORB-normalized incompatible elements 

(Figure IV.23), as these patterns are typically interpreted as characteristic of suprasubduction zones (e.g. 

Saccani et al., 2011). Additionally, most of the studied samples fall within the MORB-like and IAT 

compositional fields, in the V/(Ti/1000) diagram. Despite the general agreement that these plots are 

useful to fingerprint the tectonic setting of ophiolitic rocks, their interpretation should be cautious, as 

there are other geochemical and petrological mechanisms that might explain the geochemical features 

of these rocks, as discussed ahead (see Chapter V).

CHAPTER V  
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 

 

IV.1. DISCUSSION 

The volcanic rocks that host the Mandoos VMS deposit occur as microporphyritic massive flows and/or 

pillow lavas, locally brecciated. Their primary mineralogy is composed of augite and bytownite euhedral 

microphenocrysts, set in a microlitic matrix composed of bytownite microlites, with similar Ca-rich 

compositions, with small and sparse, skeletical Ti-rich magnetite grains. All the hanging-wall samples 

and some footwall rocks show pervasive alteration marked by the breakdown and substitution of the 

microphenocrysts: the clinopyroxene is altered into a calcic amphibole (actinolite?) and then to a 

chlorite±epidote assemblage, while plagioclase are partly to completely replaced by albite. The same 

(partial to complete) substitution is also observed in the plagioclase microlites. The groundmass is 

composed of phyllosilicates (Chl-Sme), that also occur as vesicle infills, as radial aggregates, possibly 

representing the alteration of a volcanic glassy groundmass. The small skeletical iron oxides often show 

corroded rims and small titanite crystals in its surroundings. These basaltic rocks are ocasionally, 

brecciated in situ, the fractures acting as channels, increasing the permeability and allowing the 

circulation of sea water derived fluids, causing the alteration to proceed and the precipitation of 

microcrystalline quartz and chlorite, with minor carbonates, producing a “breccia-like” texture, with 

altered basaltic pseudo-clasts, surrounded by a fine-grained matrix. This fragmentation reflects the 

generation of physical discontinuities, wich enabled fluid circulation, during which late precipitation of 

quartz and chlorite. The alteration processes resulted in a breccia-like texture, with no jigsaw-fit 

geometry and/or block rotation, but instead characterized by isolated basaltic pseudo-clasts within the 

fine-grained pseudo-matrix. Thus, these samples might represent the top of massive flows/pillow-lavas, 

where the interaction with seawater caused quenching and in-situ fracturing, and the consequent 

increasing permeability favoured fluid circulation. 

This pervasive metasomatic alteration is found in all hanging-wall samples and in the footwall samples 

which show a less intense hydrothermal ore-forming alteration, thus suggesting a widespread regional-

scale metasomatic event. Taking the secondary mineral phases into account, it is likely that this stage 

corresponds to low temperature oceanic metassomatism, caused by sea water, and derived fluids; during 

this stage, the primary minerals of these volcanic rocks may have acted as a buffer for the chemical 

reactions, controlling the chemical composition of the secondary mineral phases, and thus 

metasomatism progressed under low water/rock ratios. Later calcite, calcite + calcic zeolites, formed 

veins and vesicles infills, possibly marking an increase in the temperature of the system.  

Low-temperature exhalative hydrothermal episodes are also identified, and in some cases, preceeded 

the ore-forming hydrothermal episode. This stage is marked by hematite + carbonates + chlorite veins, 

by local hematite impregnations and by the formation of jaspers and umbers. While the jaspers/umbers 

are mostly found in specific areas (E, SE area, and locally in the open pit), the hematite-bearing veins 

are found throughout the volcanic sequence. It is likely that the formation of these silica and hematite 

(and Mn)-rich exhalative rocks is structurally-controlled, involving the circulation of Fe(±Mn)-rich and 



MINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION HALOES RELATED TO THE MANDOOS VMS DEPOSIT, SUMAIL OPHIOLITE, OMAN 

70 

sulphur-poor, siliceous and oxidizing hydrothermal fluids. These are later crosscut by calcite veins, in 

the hanging wall sequence, and by Qz+Py and Cal+Py veins in the footwall rocks. In some cases, 

hematite-silica veins are found cutting the hydrothermally altered rocks. This indicates that temperature 

decrease, during the final waning-stage of the hydrothermal system, triggered the development of 

another exhalative low-T hydrothermal episode. 

The hydrothermal stage related to the mineralization event, is recorded by a set of quartz veins, with 

pyrite, chalcopyrite, and minor sphalerite and apatite disseminations; in certain areas of the deposit 

(central part, near the open pit), the hydrothermal alteration is marked by silicification, accompanied by 

pyrite dissemination and, in other cases (drill-core samples), by more intense chloritization pyrite 

dissemination with quartz, pyrite ± chalcopyrite veins. This difference is possibly a consequence of i) 

abundant vesicles promoting the circulation of hydrothermal fluids and leading to more pervasive and 

intense of alteration (e.g. open pit area) and; ii) secondary permeability due to the «network of fractures 

and veins which form the stockwork and enabled more focussed fluid-flow. Additionally, the existence 

of footwall samples that do not show evidences of hydrothermal alteration also supports the structural 

control on the development of this hydrothermal system, representing samples which were not cut by 

the structures that channeled the hydrothermal fluids and, consequently, were not pervasively altered by 

their circulation. The development of such fracture(s) and vein(s) network is related to hydraulic 

fracturing, associated to the circulation of the mineralizing fluids. 

Zeolites are also found in the footwall volcanic rocks. In some cases, they occur within veins, which are 

later crosscut by microcrystalline quartz veins; they fill the vesicles in weak to moderately 

hydrothermally altered rock (from the open pit), and they are also found filling open spaces in the 

massive sulphide which show typical primary textures found in black-smokers-type vents. This indicates 

that during the hydrothermal circulation, zeolites precipitated directly from a more alkaline 

hydrothermal fluid, possibly during the late stages of the hydrothermal fluid circulation, denoting a 

possible mixture or increase in the sea-water derived component of the hydrothermal fluid, coeval to the 

reopening of some hydrothermal veins and calcitic Cb + Py precipitation, as previously described (see 

Chapter IV.1, Figure IV.3). Despite the difficulties in adjusting the analysed minerals to any calcic 

zeolite stoichiometry, some analysis made in the samples collected at the open pit resemble laumontite 

and (Ca-) epistilbite. These zeolites have been described in present day and fossil mineralised 

hydrothermal/geothermal systems, e.g. Iceland and Troodos ophiolite (Marosvölgyi et al., 2010; Dill et 

al., 2007), where the temperature record was below 200-250ºC.  

The presence of the aluminium-rich phyllosilicates (kaolinite, halloysite, donbassite?) in the open-pit 

samples, combined in association with more intense hydrothermal alteration (silicification and 

pyritization) reinforces the idea that these rocks experienced a more intense and pervasive leaching and 

hydrothermal alteration process under strong acid conditions.  

Less vesicular volcanic rocks, further from the open pit (and possibly from structural discontinuities), 

exhibit less pervasive alteration, with occasional quartz, chlorite and pyrite ± chalcopyrite veins, in a 

mildly silicified matrix, with more intense chloritization and pyrite dissemination. Despite this, most of 

the samples from the footwall volcanic sequence were retrieved relatively far from the area where the 

hydrothermal activity was more intense and focalized, while some of the samples that show a more 

intense hydrothermal alteration came from the open pit, where the sulphide lens was thickest (thus, 

sampling the basaltic rocks that were most affected by the hydrothermal processes related to the 

mineralization).  



V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 

 

71 

The intermittence of volcanic eruptions and the residual heat from sub-volcanic intrusions have 

sustained hydrothermal activity, which consisted of: i) exhalative, low-temperature hydrothermal 

episodes, characterized by hematite veins and deposition of jaspers and umbers; and ii) a ore-forming 

hydrothermal system, with development of a network of crack-and-seal veins and veinlets, where 

sulphides (pyrite, chalcopyrite and minor sphalerite) precipitated, together with quartz, chlorite and 

accessory apatite, in a stockwork-like arrangement with an intensely silicified zone; Py, Cpy and Sph, 

disseminations formed close to the massive sulphide mineralization, and late Zeol and Cal+Py veins 

sometimes re-open previous structures. In extreme cases (such as the sample MD-P2-4-1), the 

hydrothermal ore-forming processes resulted in pervasive pyrite (with minor chalcopyrite and 

sphalerite) and quartz replacements, with intense brecciation and hydrothermal (Qz+Py±Ccp) 

precipitates, leaving only chlorite+quartz rich cores, remnants of the intensely replaced basaltic rocks. 

This suggests that the mineralizing system developed, as well, in sub-superficial conditions, as sub-sea 

floor replacements. This process can also be promoted by the presence of pre-existent discontinuities, 

such as the ones described for the in situ fragmentation, in the hanging-wall sequence.  

The spatial distribution of these hydrothermal alteration facies is structurally controlled, but variations 

in the amount and distribution of vesicles, determined the volcanic rocks primary permeability, also 

influencing the circulation of the hydrothermal fluids. In order to fully characterise the distribution of 

the hydrothermal alteration haloes a more comprehensive sampling would be necessary  

Evidences of widespread low-temperature alteration (oceanic metassomatism) followed by temperature 

increase (hematite veins and jaspers formation) in the hanging and footwall rocks supports a multi stage 

cyclical evolution of the system, having common heat-sources (such as sub-volcanic intrusions) wich 

favoured the recurrence of similar processes in different time-periods, before and after the mineralization 

processes took place.  

The hydrothermal fluids involved in the mineralization are nonoxidizing, siliceous fluids, probably sea-

water derived, which scavenged metals from the underlying volcanic and hypabyssal rocks. During fluid 

circulation, the fluid-chemistry controlled the progression of the mineralogical transformations at high 

water/rock ratios, also supported by the intense quartz and chlorite alteration in the open pit samples 

(Hannington, 2014). According to the chlorite-based geothermometers of Jowett (1991) and Bourdelle 

et al., (2009), mineralizing fluids would have circulated at temperatures between ~200-430ºC (median 

T ~275ºC). This temperature range is provided for the overall hydrothermal mineralising stage, since it 

was not possible to differentiate to which of the episodes the analysed chlorites belonged to. These 

temperatures were obtained using samples from the more distal SSE part of the deposit. Thus, it is 

admissible that these temperatures are lower than those expected for chlorites from the stockwork 

directly below the open-pit area, where the hydrothermal system was more vigorous. 

Additionally, the presence of small crystals of fluorapatite related to the hydrothermal alteration and 

mineralization, possibly indicates: I) the leaching of P from overlying pelagic organic matter-rich 

sediments; or II) an input of late-stage magmatic fluids/volatiles for the hydrothermal fluids (P and F), 

related to the crystallization of the doleritic rocks, since Ap is also found in these rocks; such crystals 

result precipitate directly from exsolved late-magmatic, volatile-rich (e.g. F) fluids, also responsible for 

the presence of small, disseminated, sulphides.  

The rocks that host the Mandoos deposit record several mineralogical transformations and major and 

trace-element compositional modifications, caused by the different interpreted alteration events. During 

such alteration events, elements like Zr, Ti, Hf, show an immobile behaviour, while elements such as 

Al, Nb, Ta, Y or Yb are found to be slightly mobile, under specific conditions. These alteration

72 

evidences, during the different distinguished stages, are expressed in the mineralogical transformations 

observed and can be quantified through mass balance calculations. 

The application of the alteration box-plot proposed by Large et al. (2001) based on whole rock 

geochemical data, corroborates the mineralogical transformations and the precipitation of secondary 

mineral phases, observed in the studied rocks especially those affected by the mineralising hydrothermal 

alteration event. The hanging-wall rocks follow a regional/diagenetic alteration trends wherein the 

formation of a secondary k-feldspars+albite mineral association is predicted. However, K-feldspar is 

not observed in the studied samples and instead, secondary K-bearing phyllosilicates are formed. 

Finally, the use of AImajor and AItrace, proposed by Häussinger (1993), allowed a clear the distinction 

between hydrothermally altered samples, associated to mineralizing hydrothermal activity and regional 

metasomatic alteration.  

Mass balance calculations were not possible for the initial metasomatic alteration event due to lack of 

samples without this alteration imprint. Nevertheless, through the analysis of the major and trace element 

data, it is possible to infer that oceanic metasomatism led mainly to negative mass balances, 

characterized by a high mobility of elements like K, Na, Ca, Rb, Sr, U, in spite of the mass gains, result 

of the veins sealing and vesicles infills by secondary mineral phases. This sea-water induced regional 

alteration is, possibly, also responsible for the observable negative Ce anomalies in the hanging and 

footwall lavas, as these fluids are typically characterized by such anomalies. For the low-temperature, 

exhalative hydrothermal alteration, mass balances were also not calculated, due to the inexistence of 

litogeochemical data for volcanic rocks that are only affected by this alteration processes. Nevertheless, 

considering the petrographic analysis and interpretation and the other products of these exhalative 

processes (formation of jaspers and umbers), it is possible to infer positive mass balances, with net gains 

in Fe ± Mn, Ca, Mg and possibly in P and other elements, such as As or Pb.  

The mass balances, calculated for the hydrothermal alteration, conspicuous of the ore-forming stage, are 

characterized by overall negative balances, with some exceptions regarding the samples recording more 

intense hydrothermal alteration. The breakdown of primary mineral phases and the formation of 

secondary mineral phases resulted in depletion in Si and other elements such as Ca or Mg, generally 

accompanied by losses in Si. These hydrothermal alteration haloes are further characterized by Fe 

additions, followed by mass gains in Mg and significant Zn and Cu; these may account for more diluted 

hydrothermal fluids, possibly related to sea water infiltration and mixture. Nevertheless, in the open pit 

samples, where the mineralization is more developed, the results show additions in Si and Fe, as well as 

Cu, Zn, As, Ba and lower or negative mass balances of Mg, revealing the input of non-diluted, 

hydrothermal, metal-rich fluids. The In and Sn, Tl and Cd gains, in the most intensily mineralized 

samples, can also support the possibility of a late-stage magmatic fluid input in the hydrothermal fluids, 

since these elements are usually associated with (late-stage) exsolved magmatic fluids. 

These mineralogical transformation and textural features, as well as the lithogeochemical data, are 

compatible with previously described hydrothermal alteration haloes, in mafic-hosted VMS deposits. 

The intense silicification and the dissemination of pyrite, in the vicinity of the massive sulphide body 

(open pit samples), is well documented within the literature (e.g. Galley and Koski, 1999; Franklin et 

al., 2005; Galley et al., 2007; Hannington, 2014; “Quartz-Pyrite stockwork), where Si precipitates 

directly from the hydrothermal fluids, possibly from the rapid cooling of the hydrothermal fluids. The 

chloritization and pyrite dissemination, found in the SE drill-core samples, is also commonly described 

within the literature (e.g. Galley and Koski, 1999; Franklin et al., 2005; Galley et al., 2007), 

corresponding, usually, to the lower-temperature, stockwork-related alteration. 



V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 

 

73 

Finally, petrogenetic and volcanostratigraphic significance the volcanic rocks are discussed. The 

comparison of their geochemical features (REE bulk contents, their LREE depleted and HREE flat-

segment, incompatible element ratios, and incompatible elements trace contents), with published data 

for the ophiolite volcanic units strongly suggests that the volcanic rocks that host the Mandoos deposit 

are part of the Lasail volcanic unit. The more enriched REE patterns of the footwall volcanic rocks 

(Figure IV.15) can be explained by apparent gains during alteration processes and the neoformation of 

secondary mineral phases that retain these elements in their mineral structure. Nevertheless, such 

differences can also be interpreted as resulting from magmatic differentiation; in this situation, these 

features could indicate a transition from the more evolved, REE enriched Geotimes volcanism to more 

primitive, REE depleted Lasail rocks, as previously documented in the literature (Godard et al., 2006). 

In this case, these footwall lavas can still be attributed to the Lasail unit, mostly based on their HSFE 

ratio, but would represent a transitional volcanism, between the two volcanic units. 

The REE ratios (LaN/SmN, LaN/YbN), N-MORB-normalized patterns (Figure IV. 20), especially their Ti 

contents and their Nb depletion and high Th contents of the volcanic rocks hosting the Mandoos deposit 

are compatible with the Medium Titanium Basalts (MTB), as defined by Saccani et al., (2011), and also 

with other interpretations for similar volcanic rocks (Saccani et al., 2011 and references therein). These 

authors suggest that MTB rocks originated from partial melting of a more refractory mantle source than 

that associated with typical MORB; such source could be a SSZ mantle wedge which underwent 8-10% 

of partial melting after a first MORB-melt extraction. They also interpreted the LREE depletion of the 

MTB’s as an evidence that the subduction related fluid-induced partial-melting was not responsible for 

significant enrichments of the SSZ mantle wedge. The V2 volcanic sequence of the Sumail ophiolite 

(Alley. followed by boninites has been interpreted as being generated in a SSZ setting, associated to the 

interpreted intra oceanic thrusting, followed by dehydration and consequent metasomatic modification 

of the mantle source (e.g. Searl, 2007). The lower Geotimes unit, thought to have erupted in a MOR-

setting, was targeted in recent studies (MacLeod et al., 2013), where it was concluded that the water 

content involved in its fractionation is not consistent with an eruption in a MOR setting, instead, the 

geotectonic setting was interpreted as a back-arc basin. Indeed, the geochemical compositions of the 

Geotimes and Lasail rocks are consistent with those found on back-arc basins, distant from subduction 

zones (e.g. Lau-basin or North Fiji Basin; Godard et al., 2006 and references therein; see Figure IV.15). 

While the Alley unit is considered to have a clear arc/SSZ signature, some authors suggest that Lasail 

volcanic rocks also bear the same geochemical signature (e.g. Searl, 2007). 

Godard et al. (2006) interpreted the LREE depletion, the lower incompatible element abundances 

(except for mobile elements such as Rb, Sr), such as Ta, Nb, Ti, and the Nd, Pb and Sr isotopic 

composition for the Lasail unit as the result of a later partial melting from the same mantle source as 

Geotimes (DMM), the Sumail peridotites, which underwent high degrees of melt extraction (15-30%). 

This later partial melting, that originated the depleted Lasail volcanics, would have involved the mixture 

between high-degree fractional melting (25%) of DMM and a small fraction of melt (2%) in equilibrium 

with the peridotitic rocks, resulting in geochemical compositions altogether similar to the ones described 

for the volcanic rocks that host the Mandoos deposit (Godard et al., 2006). Furthermore, the isotopic 

compositions of Lasail and Geotimes rocks are similar to those in Geotimes unit: their ?Nd and Pb 

isotopic signatures do not resemble any present-day slab-derived contamination setting, eliminating the 

possibility of these rocks originating in an arc-like setting. Additionally, the mobile elements spectrum, 

especially the enrichments in Rb, Sr, U and Pb, were explained by pervasive alteration, associated to 

sea-water and sea-water derived fluids, under low-temperature conditions, similar to the oceanic 

metasomatic event described in this work (see Chapter IV.3.2.1).

74 

Considering the available published data for the Lasail volcanic unit, especially regarding its isotopic 

compositions, these low-Ti, LREE depleted basalts possibly erupted in a back-arc basin. These are the 

result of a later, shallower, high % melting event of a DMM-like source, following an initial lower-

degree partial melting (extraction of Geotimes). This volcanic unit (Lasail) is usually considered as part 

of V2 magmatic stage of the Sumail, for which there is widespread agreement on the arc-affinity/SSZ 

signature (Figure IV. 22). Additionally, the tholeiitic nature of these rocks excludes any genetic 

relationship with typical alkaline-affinity off-axis volcanism. Considering the previous discussion, one 

may suggest that this unit should be attributed to the upper part of the V1 volcanic episode, as it does 

not seem to result from partial melting of a SSZ-modified mantle source; instead, it is likely that it 

formed during the latest stages of V1 volcanism, through partial melting of a depleted mantle source, 

after extraction of the Geotimes basalts, in a ridge-like setting. 

IV.2. CONCLUSIONS 

The volcanic sequence that host the Mandoos deposit includes basaltic to basalt-andesitic rocks with 

tholeiitic affinities, and with HSFE ratios and REE patterns characteristic of the Lasail volcanic unit. 

Those rocks represent the product of late partial melting of a depleted DMM source, during the first 

volcanic episode (V1), in a ridge-like setting (Godard et al., 2006). 

These rocks include pillow-lavas and massive volcanic flows whose texture and mineralogy documents 

the progression of heterogeneously developed and multi-staged alteration processes triggered by fluid-

rock interactions. These processes were locally promoted by physical discontinuities, generated during 

in-situ brecciation processes. Nevertheless, structurally-controlled fractures, related to hydraulic 

fracturing play an important role in fluid circulation, thus controlling the development of the alteration 

patterns.  

The breakdown of primary igneous phases, i.e. clinopyroxene microphenocrysts and magnetite, into 

Act+Chl+Ep and Ttn, albitization of the plagioclase microphenocrysts and microlites, and the 

neoformation of secondary mineral phases, such as carbonates, phyllosilicates (Chl-Sme 

interstratificates) and zeolites, in veins and vesicles, is of pervasive nature. This alteration marks the 

oceanic metassomatic alteration, also found in the footwall volcanic rocks, also known as spilitization. 

This process developed in (sub-)superficial conditions, involving sea-water fluids, at low water/rock 

ratios. 

The spatial distribution of the alteration haloes associated with hydrothermal stages is structurally 

controlled but also related to primary permeability, determined by the amount (and connectivity) of the 

vesicles: i) the distribution and circulation of low-temperature hydrothermal, siliceous, S-poor and Fe-

rich fluids, was responsible for the deposition of jaspers, with hematite impregnations in the underlying 

basaltic rocks; ii) the main hydrothermal activity is contemporaneous with the sulphide deposition. In 

the open pit samples, silicification processes are recorded, accompanied by the dissemination of pyrite 

with occasional chalcopyrite and sphalerite, sometimes preserving remnants of the feldspars microlites, 

in the rocks matrix. Locally, some Zeo+Qz veins cut these hydrothermally altered rocks, possibly 

developed during the reopening and sealing of a set of Cb+Py veins. These zeolite-bearing veins are 

later re-opened and sealed by microcrystalline Qz, suggesting a rapid cooling and also the important 

structural control on the hydrothermal fluids circulation. Towards the SSE part of the deposit, the 

hydrothermal alteration is marked by chloritization and pyrite dissemination, accompanied by mild 

silicification, with occasional Qz+Chl+Py+Ccp veins. Here, a strong variation in the alteration is 

observed: the presence of chloritized volcanic rocks contrasts with mildly silicified, chloritized (and also 

pyritized) volcanic rocks which essentially exhibits the alteration mineralogical association attributed to

the oceanic metassomatic alteration. Regardless of the differences on the hydrothermal alteration 

“facies”, further sampling (e.g. in the stockwork that underlies the massive sulphide lens and from 

different areas of the open pit, as well as a more detailed mapping of this area) would allow a better 

understanding of the spatial development and distribution of these haloes. Nevertheless, the 

recognizable mineralogical and textural alterations are analogous to those described in the literature for 

the mafic-hosted VMS-type deposits: a highly silicified and pyritized area, beneath the massive sulphide 

lens (quartz and pyrite stockwork) and the lower-temperature alteration, related to the stockwork that 

fed the hydrothermal system, characterized by chlorite and pyrite (chlorite-pyrite stockwork).  

The hydrothermal fluids responsible for the massive sulphide mineralization are characterized by 

moderate to high temperatures (195-430ºC), most cerntainly acidic and bearing relatively high metal 

contents; its chemistry as mostly controlled the chemical reactions that developed the alteration haloes, 

under high water/rock ratios.  

The residual heat derived from the cooling of sub-volcanic intrusions – dolerite dykes – sustained such 

hydrothermal processes; the presence of small disseminated Ap crystals, as well as sulphides (Py), in 

the doleritic rocks suggest a small contribution of late-stage magmatic volatiles to the hydrothermal 

fluid, responsible for the precipitation of accessory apatite in the hydrothermally altered footwall 

volcanic rocks. This input is probably also responsible for increases in the In, Cd, Tl and Sn contents in 

the most mineralized samples. 

Apart from the pervasive oceanic metasomatism, the similarities between the hanging-wall and footwall 

rocks imply that similar heat-sources favoured the development of low-temperature hydrothermal 

processes at different times, explaining the occurrence of jaspers and/or umbers both before and after 

the main mineralization event, during the waning of the hydrothermal system.  

The mineralogical and textural transformations are also evident in the major element geochemistry 

variations, using the AI and CCPI indexes. These indexes represent lithogeochemical compositional 

modifications which result in secondary mineral associations characterized by I) Ab+Chl; II) 

Ab+Chl+Ep; III) Chl+Py; IV) Cb±Ser; V) Chl+Cb. Such compositional modifications are consistent 

with mass losses, although some major and trace element additions are recorded; these are usually 

associated with hydrothermal activity, marked by vein- and vesicle-infilling or, during extreme 

hydrothermal alteration, by sulphide deposition. Furthermore, the AImajor and AItrace indices (Häussinger, 

1993) successfully discriminate various alteration trends, related or not to ore-forming hydrothermal 

systems, and rather useful for VMS exploration.
