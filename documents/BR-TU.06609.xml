Acknowledgements

Primeiramente, eu preciso agradecer aos meus pais pela força e apoio durante toda

a pós-graduação, afinal a chance de realizar este trabalho é fruto de capacidade e

oportunidade. Creio que eles deram a mim ambas primorosamente. Além dos meus

pais, posso citar o apoio das avós sempre muito queridas, bem como de outros familiares

que sempre depositaram em mim esperança para dar-me forças de seguir meus sonhos.

Muito há o que agradecer ao meu orientador professor Celso Pesce. Um homem

de visão que sempre viu em mim algo que ainda não consegui e, ao depositar sua fé

em mim, deu-me oportunidades, oportunidade para ser orientado, para crescer, para

trabalhar com outros tantos colegas geniais. Ainda assim, creio que o mais caro que

pude receber dele foram palavras em momentos difíceis. Fora meus pais, acho que

apenas Celso realmente acredita e deposita tua fé em mim tão sinceramente.

Não poderia deixar de agradecer minha terapeuta Carol porque, sem a ajuda dela,

eu não teria conseguido sobreviver aos meus 20-e-poucos até o presente momento. Os

anos 2007 da Britney chega para todos.

Seguindo aos colegas, o primeiro não poderia deixar de ser o professor Guilherme

Franzini por ter tanta paciência para conseguir acompanhar-me com passos muito mais

lentos do que os dele. Aos colegas Caio e Luzia, apenas penso em vós como figuras

angelicais que foram postas no meu dia-a-dia.

À equipa do LMO por estar presente em diversos momentos da minha vida

acadêmica. Colegas de longa data como Marcos Rabelo e Flávia Milo que marcaram

uma época muito importante da minha formação profissional. Aos colegas do TPN

pela imensa ajuda e disponibilidade em momentos de dificuldade, meus sinceros

agradecimentos, em especial aos Rodolfo Gonçalves e Pedro Melo por terem ficado

comigo até os últimos minutos de 2014 para realizar meus ensaios com o modelo vertical

no ar.

O pessoal que cuidou da parte administrativa, Larissa, Marta, Lúcia, saibam que eu

devo muito a vós; à equipa técnica do LMO e TPN reservo meu agradecimento sincero

pela paciência depositada em mim, que sou naturalmente uma pessoa atrapalhada; e

especialmente a Mariza e Regiane do PPGEM por serem as pessoas mais solícitas que



conheço.

Não poderia deixar de agradecer ao professor Raul Lima por sempre ter idéias e

opiniões que foram muito importantes na minha formação nos últimos anos. Assim como

ele, outros professores: Marcos Pimenta, Euryale Zerbini, Carlos Mazzilli e Roberto

Ramos.

Por último deixo um grande&amp;lt;3 INHAÍ&amp;lt;3 para meus amigos de longa data, Lara,

Bela, Bafominho, Bia, Esther, Ranily, Lurdes, Bucious e Bris; sou grato por todo o tempo

que estão ao meu lado diretamente, indiretamente e carmicamente. Agradeço à Nat por

ter-me como Moze by Ishikawa, assim como guardo as melhores lembranças dos novos

amigos com quem a vida presenteou-me.

Agradecimento também ao CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento

Científico e Tecnológico), sua assessoria científica e seus funcionários pelo suporte

financeiro e administrativo durante o período de vigência da minha bolsa de mestrado

Epigraph

“ Les découvertes des satellites de Jupiter, des phases de

Vénus, des taches du Soleil, etc., ne demandaient que

des télescopes et de l’assiduité; mais il fallait un génie

extraordinaire pour démêler les lois de la nature dans des

phénomènes que l’on avait toujours eus sous les yeux,

mais dont l’explication avait néanmoins toujours échappé aux

recherches des Philosophes. ”

Abstract

Oil and gas exploitation in deep waters has become more than just a profit business

to be a daily necessity, since the world energy matrix is based on fossil components.

Risers are offshore structures that are intimately linked with oil and gas exploitation

and those are subjected to a great variety of effects in field, e.g., marine currents,

Vortex Induced Vibration (VIV), heave motion caused by gravitational waves, non-linear

contact with the sea floor, and many others. Riser dynamics is essentially non-linear

and experimental tests in real scale are almost impossible due to a great variety of

control parameters acting concomitantly. Small-scale models are a better experimental

approach. Nevertheless, there are many structural and hydrodynamical parameters

to be evaluated. Considering only vertical risers in the present work, Galerkin’s modal

decomposition is used in order to reduce the dynamics of a vertical flexible cylinder to a

few linear modes in which the majority of energy and information are contained. From

the modal analysis, added mass and structural parameters damping of a vertical flexible

cylinder using data obtained from free-decay tests performed both in water and in air are

evaluated. Finally, a modal Mathieu-Hill oscillator with non-linear damping is constructed

and, based on a Strutt diagram, modal stability under parametric resonance is discussed.

Keywords: Flexible pipes, Riser, Fluid-structure interaction, Offshore structure,

Mathieu instability.



Resumo

Exploração de óleo e gás em bacias de águas profundas tem-se tornado mais

do que apenas uma economia lucrativa, para ser uma necessidade diária, já que

a matriz energética mundial está baseada em componentes fósseis. Risers são

estruturas offshore ligadas intimamente com a exploração de óleo e gás e essas estão

sujeitas a uma grande variedade de efeitos na operação, e.g., correntes marítimas,

Vibrações Induzidas por Vórtices (VIV), movimento de heave causado por ondas

gravitacionais, contato não-linear com o solo marinho, entre outros. Dinâmica de risers

é essencialmente não-linear e testes experimentais em escala real são praticamente

impossíveis devido a uma enorme variedade de parâmetros de controle agindo

concomitantemente. Modelos em escala reduzida são uma abordagem experimental

mais conveniente. Não obstante, há muitos parâmetros estruturais e hidrodinâmicos

a serem determinados. Considerando apenas risers verticais no trabalho presente,

a decomposição modal de Galerkin é usada a fim de reduzir a dinâmica de um

cilindro fléxivel vertical a alguns modos lineares em que a maior parte da energia e

informação estão contidos. A partir da análise modal, parâmetros de massa adicional

e amortecimento estrutural de um cilindro flexível vertical são obtidos usando testes

de decaimento livre conduzidos na água e no ar. Finalmente, um oscilador modal de

Mathieu-Hill com amortecimento não-linear é proposto e, baseado em um diagrama de

Strutt, a estabilidade modal sob excitação de ressonânica paramétrica é discutida.

Preface

The Laboratory of Offshore Mechanics (LMO) is a large group that assembles a few
research groups, among them the Laboratory of Fluid-Structure Interaction &amp;amp; Offshore
Mechanics (LIFE&amp;amp;MO). The LIFE&amp;amp;MO has dedicated its lifetime to study fluid-structure
interaction phenomena and many aspects of offshore mechanics since 1990. Such
themes include structural mechanics of risers, pipes and mooring lines, dynamic
positioning of floating stations, non-linear dynamics and hydrodynamics. Its main subject
is Offshore Engineering in deep water, patronized by institutions such as: Prysmian,
Petrobras, FAPESP, CNPq and FINEP. Some pioneering works developed by the LMO
group culminated with, just to cite a few:

• The Steel Catenary Riser (SCR) draft which, pioneering, was installed on a
semi-submersible platform (the P-18), see Pesce et al. (1994);

• A first methodology establishment for design of a SCR, see (Pesce et al., 1996);

• The analytical treatment of riser dynamics, see Pesce (1997), Aranha et al. (1997),

(1999), Ramos Jr. and Pesce (2003), Pesce et al. (2006a) and Silveira et al. (2007).;

Concerning experimental activities, LMO and LIFE&amp;amp;MO have been pioneers at
using several new monitoring techniques for VIV in flexible cylinders and riser models
since 1997. Among those techniques, some uses accelerometry and conventional
extensometry installed and distributed along the tested cylinder length; for further details,
e.g., Fujarra (1997), Fujarra et al. (1998), Pesce and Fujarra (2000), Fujarra et al.
(2001) and Fujarra (2002). The aforementioned experimental tests were performed at
facilities, such as: Institute for Technological Research (IPT), the Michigan University
and the Cornell University. The distributed extensometry technique were considered an
innovation within the international community, as references such as Pesce and Fujarra
(2000) and Fujarra et al. (2001) are acknowledged on important papers on VIV; see
Williamson and Govardhan (2004). Those techniques are still used nowadays at LMO,
e.g., Franzini et al. (2008), Franzini et al. (2009) and Franzini et al. (2011a), and other
research groups, e.g., Morooka et al. (2009).

The LMO was also internationally pioneer using the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT)
in order to analyze non-linear phenomena such as VIV; see Pesce et al. (2006), Silveira et
al. (2007), Franzini et al. (2008), Franzini et al. (2010),Franzini et al. (2011a) and Franzini
et al. (2011b). The HHT is a technique in which it is possible to obtain a time-frequency
spectral analysis from extremely non-ergodic signals. This signal analysis tool was
successfully employed on studies of offshore platforms Vortex-Induced Motion (VIM)
phenomena; see Gonçalves et al. (2012).

Hereupon, the R&amp;amp;D project entitled “Non-Linear Dynamics of Risers: non-linear
interactions of hydro-elastic and contact nature”1 was contracted to Universidade de São
Paulo (USP) by Petrobras in late 2009, under the Offshore Structures Thematic Network.
Its scope is based on four complementary activities, as follows:

1. Mathematical modeling of risers dynamics with reduction techniques by using
non-linear modes representation;

1The original title is in Portuguese: “Dinâmica não-linear de Risers: Interações não-lineares de
natureza hidro-elástica e de contato”.

2. Parametric excitations and internal resonant responses, arising from dynamical
interaction in several time and space scales, between heave imposed at the top
and Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV);

3. Analysis of typical cases, focusing on non-linear dynamics of risers;

4. Experimental dynamics tests with riser small-scale model.

It is worthy mentioning that the “Non-Linear Dynamics of Risers” project has enabled
the LIFE&amp;amp;MO to advance on state-of-art researches on VIV and riser dynamics,
improving technical and scientific topics related to theoretical models, modeling and
monitoring techniques, as well as on several experimental analysis techniques applied
to tests with small-scale riser models with catenary-shape and vertical configurations. It
might be remarked the following advances:

1. Small-scale modeling and monitoring techniques

(a) Development of a new methodology for designing a small-scale riser models
in which a silicon tube is filled with stainless steel micro-spheres, providing a
geometrical, structural and dynamical hydro-elastic Froude similitude with a
riser in real scale; see LIFE&amp;amp;MO (2012b) and Pereira et al. (2012);

(b) Development and consolidation of displacement measurement technique
along the model span, using an optical tracking system of cameras placed
on air and immersed at different laboratory facilities: a Water Channel (NDF),
a Hydrodynamic Calibrator (CH-TPN), and a Towing Tank (IPT); further details
on LIFE&amp;amp;MO (2012a, 2012b), Gonçalves et al. (2012), Franzini et al. (2013)
and Pereira et al. (2013).

2. Experimental analysis techniques

(a) Consolidation of an analysis methodology in which conventional techniques
are merged, such as: statistical methods, spectrum analysis (energy
spectrum along model span) and time-domain analysis (amplitude-time
scalograms); see LIFE&amp;amp;MO (2012c, 2012d);

(b) Crystallization of the time-frequency spectrum analysis using the HHT;
LIFE&amp;amp;MO (2012b), Gonçalves et al. (2012), Franzini et al. (2013), Pereira
et al. (2013) Franzini et al. (2015) and Franzini et al. (2016);

(c) Development of a modal decomposition method in VIV studies in flexible
cylinders; as it may be regarded in LIFE&amp;amp;MO (2012d) and Franzini et al.
(2014).

Among those advances enumerated before, the particular design of a small-scale
experimental model based on a silicon tube filled with stainless steel micro-spheres might
be pointed out as a great innovation on the experimental field. The author had the chance
of a life time to be part of the group who developed such experimental method, being able
to collaborate actively; see Pereira et al. (2012).

All work carried out on the aforementioned project might be summed up on the series
of technical reports LIFE&amp;amp;MO (2011a, 2011b, 2011c, 2011d, 2011e, 2011f, 2012a,
2012b, 2012c, 2012d) and a colossal and unique amount of experimental data, including
several appendices. An interesting note might be made, quoting the preface from
LIFE&amp;amp;MO (2012d), which says:



xxiii

The specific results obtained [on the technical reports LIFE&amp;amp;MO
(2012c, 2012d)] [...] are unique, since they came from a thorough
planning and testing which were conducted systematically with a
great degree of comprehensiveness and completeness.
The reader will be able to verify that the huge experimental data
base [...] will serve not only to technical and scientific insights of
experimental nature, however primarily to verification of theoretical
models, whether numerical or analytical, being able to become an
important source of benchmarking to industry, with consequent
impact assessments on risers design meyhodology. (LIFE&amp;amp;MO,
2012d, p. 12, own translation)

It is possible to affirm that the regarded R&amp;amp;D project is unique and its large
experimental data base will provide bright scientific insight for the next years. At least,
that is what it is hoped.

Chapter 1

Introduction

The dynamics of risers is eminently of nonlinear character, since it deals with vibration
phenomena on large aspect ratio, L/D ? 100, flexible cylindrical structures, associated
with interactions with the fluid medium surrounding them and the combined support
excitations and internal resonances of parametric nature. The complexity of these
concurrent interactions - associated with its practical relevance in ocean engineering
- makes the research topic in screen to remain in full development, both nationally and
internationally, as evidenced by the long list of publications in the field, which forms part
of Chapter 2.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 2

Risers are structures that transport, from the ocean floor till the ocean surface,
economical commodities, e.g., oil and gas. Together with oil and gas, sea water, salt,
sand, sediments, are also conveyed. Risers might be presented as a nearly rigid
structure, for shallow waters, or flexible, for deep-water and ultra deep-waters fields.
Besides, there are different configurations according to which a riser may be installed,
such as, the Steel “Canetary” Riser (SCR), lazy-wave, top tensioned vertical riser, and so
on; see Figure 1.1. What will determine the riser configuration is the sort of floating unit
from which is suspended, the local depth and other in financial parameters.

As mentioned before, the riser dynamics is a subject in which several phenomena
occur with different time and space scales. Among all sorts of Fluid-Structure
phenomena, Vortex Induced Vibration (VIV) over the spanwise and parametric
resonance due to heave motion imposed at the top of the line by gravitational waves over
the vessel in which risers are suspended; are to be emphasized Figure 1.2. Generally,
VIV and heave play concomitant action on the structure, however the present work will
only deal with effects due to parametric resonance, modal structural parameters and
hydrodynamical coefficients in still water.

The small-scale model developed back in 2011 to conduct experimental campaigns
at NDF, TPN and IPT will be soon detailed in Chapter 4. In order to study the elastica
dynamical behavior in the experiments, it was proposed a non-intrusive observation
using cameras capturing the Cartesian motion of an amount of optical targets attached in
the model. The number of optical targets is 43 (experiments in water) and 54 (experiments
in air).

Analyzing around 50 temporal series for each Cartesian direction of each target
would be a huge work that not necessarily would show some correlations, or internal
resonances easily. Following the Zeitgeist proposed in LIFE&amp;amp;MO (2012d), the modal
decomposition is studied and it is used to condensate the most part of the information
contained in all temporal series of each target in a few modal ones.

The choice of a modal basis to conduct a modal decomposition is properly discussed



CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 3

in the light of Galerkin’s method. The climax of modal decomposition is reached when
a modal Mathieu-Hill oscillator is determined from a proposed theoretical continuum
formulation of a heavy vertical line with imposed motion at the top in Chapter 3.

Considering initially the experimental results obtained in LIFE&amp;amp;MO (2012d) from
the perspective of the modal oscillator, it exists the possibility to define a few modal
parameters, e.g., total modal mass, structural linear modal damping, modal structural
stiffness and hydrodynamical non-linear damping. The total modal mass parameter
is consisted of the structural mass (known) and the added mass (unknown) and
the damping effect from both structural and hydrodynamical is amalgamated, being
impossible to isolate one from the other without previously evaluating the structural linear
damping.

The experimental campaign conducted in air comes to attention in order to evaluate
the modal structural damping coefficient using a simple free-decay test. Besides, it is
shown that it is also possible to estimate directly the modal added mass parameter when
both experiments in water and in air are compared one to the other in a certain physical
condition of modal structural stiffness equivalence between the experiments proposed.

Exploring the modal Mathieu-Hill oscillator, the experiment in water presents a
non-linear term due to hydrodynamical damping mainly caused by drag forces, being
necessary to use a perturbation techniques proposed by Ramani et al. (2004), yielding
to a local solution in the instability area in Strutt diagram. Finally, it is possible to study
the modal stability by means of Strutt diagram, looking for results that might be inside any
instability tongue.

Chapter 2

Literature review

The stilly murmur of the distant Sea

Tells us of silence.

And that simplest Lute,

Placed length-ways in the clasping casement,

[ hark!

[...]

O! the one Life within us and abroad,

Which meets all motion and becomes its soul,

A light in sound, a sound-like power in light,

Rhythm in all thought, and joyance everywhere–

Methinks, it should have been impossible

Not to love all things in a world so filled;

Where the breeze warbles, and the mute still air

Is Music slumbering on her instrument.

“The Eolian Harp” (excerpt) by Samuel Taylor

Coleridge, 1795.

One might say the natural order of nature is to have no order at all. The apparent

order humankind supposes to perceive is an illusion caused by the absence of two very

conflicting panoramas, by being unable to regard the whole universe at once, or to see on

quantum scale. However, it is possible to find some order on the way in which mankind

interacts and this fact could be pointed out as a great sparkle that has puzzled many

ingenious minds since the establishment of the human race.

Philosophy and Mathematics are not the same, although they have a non-empty

intersection. Clearly both subjects are infinite on their very own way, having a lot in

common, but mathematics has some impishness that the other does not. If it is possible to

conceive the idea that all sciences have come from the marriage between philosophy and

mathematics, mechanics would have been their first child. In this context, Mathematics

shall be understood as a language to express natural phenomenon concepts which one

may gaze through Philosophy, as far as art, music and literature are a sort of language

with whom one desires to express what their soul longs to say.



CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW 6

Historically, the first mathematical language well defined was geometry, as it may

be regarded with fundamental works of Euclid (c. 300 BC, 2002) and many others

mathematicians. Geometry is a powerful language that has been found on all mechanical

works since the Archimedes’ Principle of the Levers, one of the most fundamental

principles of statics, as it is said by Lagrange (1736–1813):

Archimède, le seul parmi les anciens qui nous ait laissé quelque théorie sur

la mécanique dans ses deux livres de Æquiponderantibus, est l’auteur du

principe du levier, lequel consiste, comme tout le monde fait, en ce que si

un levier droit est chargé de deux poids quelconques placés de part et d’autre

du point d’appui à des distances de ce point réciproquement proportionnelles

aux mêmes poids, ce levier sera en équilibre et son appui sera chargé de la

somme des deux poids. (LAGRANGE, 1989, p. 2)1

As Dark Ages rose, science found a rich nest among Arabs, Chineses and Indians.

The most significant contributions were led by Arabs who took into advantage all

acknowledgment acquired by the Romans and placed in libraries across the Empire,

e.g. Library of Alexandria. Among a few notable Arab mathematic findings, it is possible

to mention: the definition of the zero number; algebraic notations which are used still

nowadays; extensive studies with polynomials and their roots; numerical methods for

evaluating square and cubic roots; and even introduction of the proof by induction.

The 17th century Enlightenment brought a breath of fresh air to science and, by the

end of that century, mechanics would have been metamorphosed into a solid ground for

those who wanted to wonder about the universe; the triad of works developed by Galilei

(1638), Huygens (1673) &amp;amp; Newton (1687) opened doors to a whole new world.

A truly important question had risen: what would the fundamental principle of

mechanics be? Such an idea came from a principle Fermat (1601–1665) derived from

Huygens-Fresnel principle in which light should always take a path between two points

that can be transversed in the least time. Lanczos, in his masterpiece The Variational

Principles of Mechanics, (Lanczos, 1970), wrote a brief introduction very clarifying about

the philosophical evaluations of mechanics at the 17th–18th centuries.

1Archimedes, the only one among the ancients who has actually left us some theory about
mechanics on his two books of Æquiponderantibus, is the author of the principle of the lever, which
consists on the statement, as everyone does, that if a straight lever is to be loaded by any two weights
placed on either side of its support point, placed at distances reciprocally proportional to those weights,
the lever will be in equilibrium and its support point will be loaded with the sum of both weights. (Own

CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW 7

The keynote of that entire period was the seemingly per-established harmony

between “reason” and “world”. The great discoveries of higher mathematics

and their immediate application to nature imbued the philosophers of those

days with an unbounded confidence in the fundamentally intellectual structure

of the world. [...] But this is not surprising if we observe how the

purely æsthetic and logical interest in maximum-minimum problems gave

one of the strongest impulses to the development of infinitesimal calculus,

and how Fermat’s derivation of the laws of geometrical optics on the

basis of his “principle of quickest arrival” could not fail to impress the

philosophically-orientally scientists of those days. (LANCZOS, 1970, p. xxvii)

The principle of least action appeared on mechanics, establishing a dual

correspondence with Fermat’s principle on geometrical optics2. This principle has many

forms of being presented, but, for the sake of simplicity, it will be considered as Hamilton’s

principle. It is noteworthy that the principle of least action was misused by Maupertuis

(1698–1759) and others on a metaphysical context; Lanczos, in (Lanczos, 1970, p.

xxvii), also wrote about it arguing: “[...] the dilettante misuse of these tendencies [of

world intellectual structure] [sic] by Maupertuis and others for theological purposes has

put the entire trend into disrepute, is not the fault of the great philosophers”. Lagrange,

in his headstone Mécanique Analytique (Lagrange, 1989, p. 189), mentioned that “[...]

est le Principe auquel je donne ici, quoique improprement le nom de moindre action, &amp;amp;

que je regarde non comme un principe métaphysique, mais comme un résultat simple &amp;amp;

général des loix [sic] de la Méchanique”, consolidating the principle of least action only

as a scientific principle on the analytical mechanics realm.

Although the classical holonomic Hamilton’s principle is applicable for arbitrary

systems, it is not quite general, because it only holds for systems characterized by

monogenic forces and holonomic auxiliary conditions3. As a matter of fact, Hamilton’s

principle may be derived by the Principle of Virtual Work (PVW), already known in

statics, together with d’Alembert (1717–1783) principle4. D’Alembert’s principle is a

bridge between dynamics and statics, bringing into light the possibility of finding a system

of differential equations which describes the system dynamics, as much as the PVW

shall be employed in order to find a system of algebraic equations which solves a static

problem.

On the mechanics realm, it may be pointed out d’Alembert’s principle and the PVW

as fundamental principles of statics and dynamics. These two principles reproduce the

Hamilton’s principle and, by doing so, they reduce the fundamental problem of dynamics

as a calculus of variations problem, a branch of calculus developed by Euler (1707–1783)

2In this case, the principle of least action shall be understood as Jacobi’s principle.
3Conditions that can be written upon a differential form which may be integrated, also known as

Pfaffian form.
4Later, by using a proper treatment on the Hamilton’s principle, it has been generalized for systems

with changing mass – e.g., McIver (1973) – and for non-material systems; see Casetta and Pesce
(2013).

and Lagrange. This leads to Euler-Lagrange equations of movement, or even Hamilton

equations; further acknowledgments may be obtained in Goldstein (1965), Lanczos

(1970), Gantmacher (1975), Meirovitch (1980, 2003), Dugas (1988), Whittaker (1988),

Lagrange (1989) &amp;amp; Gelfand and Fomin (2000).

2.1 Approaches to modeling and dynamical experimental analysis

Inroads at the flexible cylinder system have been done over time using analytical,

semi-analytical and numerical models. There are structural models from the simplest

cable – under small displacement and linear-elastic behavior assumptions – in which the

representation is done using bars and Euler-Bernoulli tensioned beams, to more complex

models in which geometric non linearities or even non linear rheological behavior is taken

into account.

Calling attention to the analytical and semi-analytical models, it is usual to consider

a linear-elastic material. Asymptotic methods and perturbation techniques, e.g., WKB,

allow to reach closed modal representations of the structure dynamics; see Pesce et

al. (1999), Pesce and Martins (2005) &amp;amp; Chatjigeorgiou (2008a, 2008b), all inspired

on Triantafyllou (1984). The bending stiffness effect may also be taken into account

analytically, by introducing an integral concept of equivalent geometric rigidity, as it might

be seen in Mazzilli et al. (2014).

More sophisticated approaches, using non-linear modes, e.g., Shaw and Pierre

(1991, 1993), have also reached interesting results. The counterpart of those

approaches is the need for highly complex mathematical techniques, whereas they are

based on the use of multiple scales methods or a proper finite-element formulation; see

Sanches et al. (2007), Mazzilli (2009), LIFE&amp;amp;MO (2011c, 2011d), Mazzilli and Sanches

(2011), Mazzilli et al. (2011) &amp;amp; Prado et al. (2013).

On the other hand, high-hierarchy numerical model approaches are based on a

general Finite Element Method (FEM) formulation. This is an usual and classical

approach; further acknowledgment might be seen on Pesce and Martins (2005),

Huera-Huarte (2006), Pesce et al. (2006b), Silveira et al. (2007), Rustad et al.

(2008), Morooka and Tsukada (2011), Takafuji and Martins (2012), Mainçon and

Bernardo-Viljoen (2013) &amp;amp; Prado et al. (2013). Numerical models that consider large

rotations have shown to be a good approach for some stability investigations; see Gay

Neto and Martins (2013).

Regarding the structure dynamical experimental analysis, several techniques have

been employed. From classical techniques, e.g., Galerkin methods, achieving modal

decomposition representations on a finite Hilbert space – e.g., Huera-Huarte (2006), Gu

et al. (2013) &amp;amp; Franzini et al. (2014) – to identification techniques of other natures, e.g.,

Kassen (2002), Lucor et al. (2006), Lucor and Triantafyllou (2008), Mukundan (2008),



2.2. SIGNAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES 9

Mukundan et al. (2009) &amp;amp; Mainçon and Bernardo-Viljoen (2013).

The modal decomposition has been widely used in recent publications in which

experimental approaches are dealing with modal parameters as added mass and

damping; see Franzini et al. (2015). There is also a branch using Reduced Order Models

(ROMs) obtained from modal decomposition in order to study modal added mass and

mean drag force affect; see Franzini et al. (2015) Franzini et al. (2016).

2.2 Signal analysis techniques

Inasmuch as the present work gets along with experimental data, it is also important to

use proper signal analysis techniques which are more suitable for each modal or target

time series. The experimental database obtained in LIFE&amp;amp;MO (2012c, 2012d) shows a

great deal of displacement signals, along with a load cell signal. As it may be seen in

Franzini et al. (2014), such signals are extremely non-ergodic in some cases, presenting

amplitude modulation and spectral effects from a different assortment of harmonics; in

fact, Modarres-Sadeghi et al. (2011), via Poincaré mapping, have shown that there is a

possible switch behavior on a same signal in which the structure might be periodical at

one moment, being followed by a quasi-periodical or even chaotic behavior at another.

Spectral techniques as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Short Time Fourier Transform

(STFT), Gabor Transform5 (GT) and Wavelet Transform (WT) might be used somehow to

give a glimpse of the system dynamical behavior. A simple FFT can, at a first sight, tell a

lot from the signal spectra, however the FFT analysis is best suitable for ergodic signals

with no amplitude modulation; see Proakis and Manolakis (2007). On the other hand,

the STFT and the GT would exhibit more reliable results, giving a Joint Time-Frequency

Analysis (JTFA) with more details about the dynamics hidden on the temporal series; see

Hamdan et al. (1996), Jubran et al. (1998) &amp;amp; Ikoma et al. (2012). About JTFA using STFr

and GT, Jubran et al. said:

5Gabor Transform is a special case of a Short Time Fourier Transform in which the window used is
a Gaussian-type function.



2.2. SIGNAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES 10

It is to be noted that STFT method is one of the most widely used classical

methods of JTFA, which is also used, for the analysis of nonstationary signals

where the time series is scanned in overlapping windows. Thus, STFT

gives a redundant information and only a part of it is sufficient to synthesize

exactly the input signal using the inverse STFT. Although, STFT suffers from

many pitfalls, such as aliasing, time window effect, picket fence effects, and

bandwidth-localization tradeoff. For example, for a large analysis window, low

frequencies can be calculated, while high frequencies are poorly localized. On

the other hand, the STFr in time and frequency domains can not be arbitrarily

small because their product is lower banded [...]

Thus, for impulsive and nonstationary signals which requires good time

frequency resolution, classical STFT ceases to be productive, since STFr

can not either provide good frequency-resolution nor good time resolution.

(JUBRAN ET AL., 1998, p. 585, emphasis added)

Thereby, a properly chosen wavelet base would be a better choice than a simpler STFr.

As an alternative, there is the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) which has been used on

experimental data from fluid-structure interaction phenomena, specially VIV and VIM,

since Pesce et al. (2006). The HHT has shown to be a very useful and reliable technique

for the interpretation of phenomena in which amplitude-frequency modulation occurs;

see Franzini et al. (2011a), Franzini et al. (2011b), Franzini et al. (2012), Gonçalves et al.

(2012), Gonçalves et al. (2012), Franzini et al. (2013) &amp;amp; Gonçalves et al. (2013).

Chapter 3

Theoretical background

“As a matter of fact, there is no mystery about these distortions of nature about

which we still hear complaints in discussions on modern art. Everyone who

has ever seen a Disney film or a comic strip knows all about it. [...] Mickey

Mouse does not look very much like a real mouse, yet people do not write

indignant letters to the papers about the length of his tail.”

The Story of Art (excerpt) by Sir Ernst H. Gombrich.

Following, it will be presented the theoretical background of this present work, but,

firstly, it shall be remarked how this chapter is organized. There are four main subjects to

be placed on the theoretical background which refer to:

1. Development of small-scale model for the flexible vertical cylinder;

2. Experimental mathematical formulation:

(a) Approaches from different models;

(b) Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions: the Sturm-Liouville problem associated to

each sort of model;

(c) Defining the suitable modal decomposition;

3. Modal oscillator

3.1 Modal mathematical formulation

3.1.1 The classical vibrating string

The vibrating string is a mechanical system in which there is a material medium, the string,

that is able to transfer information from one point to another through a wave. That system

is essentially one-dimensional, but it can be extended to higher dimensional applications



3.1. MODAL MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION 12

on the theory of vibrating plates or bodies. The information is propagated along the

vibrating string at the sound velocity, which is a directed function of the material medium

(string) mechanical properties; see Rayleigh (1896). The called classical vibrating string

presents axial constant tension at each point of the string.

A phenomena such as the string vibration and its effects over nature should be

regarded as a puzzle that has been bewitching philosophers since Pythagoras (c.

570BC-–c. 495BC). Historically, Pythagoras was the first philosophically oriented

mathematician to demonstrate a proportional relationship between sound and the

wavelength of a stationary vibrating string. Such proportional relationship is known as

harmonic series; e.g., the harmonic series of C2, see Figure 3.1, also known as C on

Helmholtz designation, Helmholtz (1885).

Figure 3.1: Harmonic series of C2

The idea behind the harmonic series is ingenious: Pythagoras stated that, given an

ideal string with a fundamental frequency, every rational multiple of this fundamental

frequency is related to a wavelength inversely proportional to the integer chosen; see

Figure 3.2. From the harmonic series, it is possible to determine the perfect fifths1 chain

(F-C-G-D-A-E-B) and, then, it is also possible to find the seven natural pitches of the

diatonic scale, that are still used nowadays in music. Besides the chain of perfect fifths,

the diatonic scale and harmonic series, Pythagoras’ works on the vibrating string precede

the Major scale, the Ionian mode, a basis for musical composition.

1A perfect fifth is related to the third harmonic of the harmonic series proposed by Pythagoras;
actually, the third harmonic is the perfect fifth of the second harmonic, so there is a ratio 2 : 3 between
a pitch and its perfect fifth. For example, if C3 (130.81Hz) is considered to be the fundamental note, its
perfect fifth would be the G3 (196.15Hz); see Figure 3.1.



3.1. MODAL MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION 13

Figure 3.2: Pythagorean relationship between frequency and wavelength in a ideal vibranting string

After this brief introduction, it will be presented a mathematical model to the classical

vibrating string. The schematic model is seen in Figure 3.3.

Figure 3.3: Schematic model of a classical vibrating string bi-articulated with constant distributed mass,
µ, and constant traction, T.

The string is supposed to have constant length, even when it is transversally deformed

and it is considered bi-articulated in order to neglect flexural effects near its ends. The

transversal displacement is given by u (z,t). The stationary wave equation, eq. 3.1, will
be used as a mathematical model.

In which c0 = T/µ is the wave celerity. The variable separation method is employed
on u (z,t) = ? (z) ? (t) in order to uncouple both variables; see Tikhonov and Samarskii
(1980). Using the variable separation proposed before on eq. 3.2, it is possible to write2:

The equation 3.2 is a 2nd order equation in t and z, which means it would be necessary

4 informations in order to evaluate all constants – Dn, ?n, An and Cn – and find the
dynamical response of the system. Two informations were given as boundary conditions,

which determine the coefficients An and Cn. Initial conditions are missing in order to

determine the other two coefficients. For the present work, only the Sturm-Liouville

problem is necessary; therefore, the modal shapes (eigenfunctions), ?n, and natural

frequencies (eigenvalues), ?n, evaluated using the boundary conditions are desirable.

3.1.2 Vertical string

Next, it will be introduced the vertical string, a vibrating string in which the effect of

its own weight causes a variable traction along its span; see Figure 3.4. Some of the

assumptions made for the classical vibrating string still holds, as: constant length (even

when deformed), flexural effects on both endings are neglected and stationary waves.

2In this text, ?? refers to temporal derivatives; and ??, to space derivatives.

Figure 3.4: Vertical tensioned string subjected to its own weight

Similarly to that was done before, the main idea is to start with the wave equation,

see eq. 3.1, in order to determine the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the vertical

vibrating string. Again it will be supposed a transversal displacement along the string,

u (z,t), which can be decomposed into the Cartesian directions presented in Figure 3.4,
as ~u (z,t) = ux (z,t)~? + uy (z,t)~?. The traction on the vertical string shall be presented
as a function of the position of the string, T (z), due to the effect of its own weight; see
eq. 3.6.

T (z) = T0 + ?z = T0 + µgz (3.6)

Firstly, it is necessary to rewrite the wave equation, considering a non-constant

traction and, after that, the separation variable method shall be employed as well,

u (z,t) = ? (z) ? (t); see eqs. 3.7–3.8 and Tikhonov and Samarskii (1980).

necessary to introduce two change of variables, as follows; see 3.8.

to write the boundary conditions in matrix form, see eq. 3.13, and, ignoring the trivial

to find any ??n, it is necessary to use a graphical or a numerical method. It is noteworthy

that the parameter ??n is related to the eigenvalues, ?n, of the problem; see eq. 3.11. The

the normalized string length, z? ? I = [0, 1] ? R; see eq. 3.17. Finally, a normalized
eigenfunction, see eq. 3.18, might be presented to the vertical heavy string problem in

which the tension on the bottom end is always positive (under traction), T0 &gt; 0. The
normalized mode is useful in order to perform qualitative comparisons between the

unitary trigonometric (sine) eigenfunctions, see eq. 3.5, and the present eigenfunctions

A similar system, the heavy hung chain simply supported at the top, is presented

on Bowman (1958) and it has a similar solution to the vertical heavy string. Another

very interesting approach was proposed by Mazzilli et al. (2014) in which the flexural

rigidity is considered along the cylinder span as a “distributed load” and this load is

approximated by an equivalent normal force proposed in their work. Doing such a

trick, the fourth-order beam equation becomes a second-order one, resembling the

Bessel formulation. Mazzilli et al. (2014) approach calls the eigenfunctions obtained

as quasi-Bessel modes, from which they developed asymptotic expansions, reaching a

closed analytical form for those.

3.1.3 Modal decomposition

Modal decomposition is a powerful tool developed in late nineteenth century and early

twentieth century, with contributions from Rayleigh (1896), Ritz (1909) &amp;amp; Galerkin

(1915). Modal analysis is intimately related to musical acoustics. As it might be seen

in publications of middle-late nineteenth century, musical related studies, e.g., sound

phenomenology, instruments and concert hall acoustics, were very common, since

science also reflects the Zeitgeist.

At that time, analytical mechanics and the Hamilton theory of quaternions, see

Hamilton (1853), were well-established among scientists. Ritz (1909) showed that the

modal shape was directly linked to the minimization of a functional, being possible to

analytically determine the mode of a mechanical system. The Rayleigh-Ritz method5

and the Galerkin-Ritz, see Galerkin (1915), are attempts to analyze a continuum problem

from a discrete mesh, reducing the order of the system. Both methods are numerical

and iterative, based on the search for three parameters: eigenvalues (frequencies),

eigenfunction (modal shapes) and damping coefficients.

In order to find any of those parameters, it is necessary to guess how the modal

shape would be like. The only restriction for a function to be candidate to represent a

modal shape is to satisfy all boundary constraint. The quality of the method is defined by

how better was the modal shape function (educated) estimation.

Computational methods, e.g., FEM, are based on Rayleigh-Ritz-Galerkin method

inasmuch as they use a discrete mesh to discretize the continuum. The quality of a FEM

analysis is related to the number of mesh elements, because they try to use as simple as

possible polynomial functions to interpolate the continuum behavior: with a more refined

mesh, the result will be better. There is a computational cost discussion that should be

regarded, but it is not the main subject of the present work.

Experimental analysis commonly uses modal techniques, trying to reduce the order

of a continuum system into a finite number of dof discrete system. Ewins (2000) is a

masterpiece for experimental modal analysis, showing the fundamental points to perform

a good experimental test and a posterior analysis.

The experimental data collected in LIFE&amp;amp;MO (2012d) used a model in which discrete

optical targets were fixed. The optical tracking system, Qualys R©, recorded displacement

data from 43 discrete points of the tested model elastica. As it has been said, the

phenomenon observed is complex, with many nuances and different response types,

so that it is nearly impossible to extract much information when it is necessary to analyze

43 temporal series in parallel. An interesting manner to filter the data, minimizing the loss

5In a recent article, Leissa (2005) discuss that, in fact, the Rayleigh-Ritz method is strictly Ritz
method. The Ritz method is similar to Rayleigh method – both minimize an energy functional – but they
are different one from another. The aforementioned article has promoted a discussion on the same
Journal years later, see Ilanko (2009), with some other considerations about the historical analysis of
Rayleigh-Ritz method.



3.1. MODAL MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION 20

of information, is changing the analysis point of view from the physical model to a modal

model.

The continuum model has infinite modes, it has infinite dof. As much as the tested

model is continuum, it was necessary to fix discrete targets on it, then what really exists

is a finite number of dof from which it is possible to interpolate an elastica at each time

instant. Therefore, with the data obtained, it would be possible to study the same finite

number of modes. Would it be necessary to regard all 43 modes?

The answer is clearly negative, because it is possible to create a criteria of choosing

only the most significant modes. A significant mode would present non-negligible

amplitudes (or energy), which can be verified by a spectral analysis, such as FFT; see

Figure 3.6. Another way to check if a certain amount of modes is sufficient to represent

the whole model dynamics is comparing the elastica from the modal reconstitution with

the experimental at each time increment.

movement amplitude along the model spanwise.

Figure 3.6 shows that the structure keeps the main energy introduced in it at the first

three modes. It would be needed a similar analysis to every experimental test, with

VIV, imposed heave, concomitant VIV and heave, to conclude if only those modes are

sufficient to represent the model dynamics. However an educated estimation would be

that it is not many more modes than those, perhaps some mode should be included, but

the first three should probably not be excluded. Another interesting thing can be seen



3.1. MODAL MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION 21

from Figure 3.6 is that the experimental mode is very similar to sine and Bessel modes

discussed earlier. In special, it resembles the Bessel mode asymmetry.

Regarding the continuum hypothesis, any solution, u (z,t), for the vertical flexible
cylinder elastica shall also be continuous and have continuous derivatives. It will be

required that the solution is in a subset of Hilbert space, ? ? H2(R). There is a norm
defined on ?, such as:

?u? = ?u,u?1/2 ,?u ? ? (3.19)

In which? · , ·? represents an inner product still to be defined. Using the separation of
variables method, it is considered that any vector, u˜ (z,t) ? ?, can be decomposed as:

u˜ (z,t) = ?˜ (z) ? (t) = A (t) ?˜ (z) (3.20)
In which ? (t) = A (t) is the amplitude temporal series. Thereby, the modal

decomposition is defined as a projection of the elastica displacement, u˜ (z,t), at each
instant of time to a finite base formed with chosen modal shapes, {?? (z)}; see eqs.
3.21–3.24.

The inner product6 is the typical function space inner product with a weighting

function, w (z). The weighting function is considered to show some versatility of the

the variable transformation, ?J (z, z?)?:



3.1. MODAL MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION 22

method, although it is usual to choose a unitary weight. In the case of Bessel functions,

the natural weighting function would be w (z) = z, as it can be seen in Bowman (1958)
&amp;amp; Abramowitz and Stegun (1972). A suitable choice of an inner product can simplify

analytical expressions. However, in the modal decomposition case, all calculations will

be performed numerically, so it is not necessary to choose a natural weighting function.

The last, but not the least, point to be discussed is about the Galerkin method and

the experimental tests with imposed heave motion. As it was mentioned before, the

sufficient condition on Galerkin decomposition is to use a function which does not violate

the systems constraint, a condition that resembles the analytical mechanics concept of

virtual displacement, e.g., ?u.

The modal representation base, {?? (z)}, see eq. 3.21, is chosen to be only a vector
of the spanwise curved; being a fixed base for every time instant, it is time-invariant.

Accordingly, it has emerged a dichotomy: is it possible to use such modal base to analyze

experimental tests in which occur heave motion?

Heave motion simulates the effects of floating units in which a real riser might be fixed

and those effects are crucial on riser dynamics, inasmuch as they represent external

forces that may act on internal and parametric resonances. Trigonometric and Bessel-like

modes use a fixed model length, L, in their closed-form solution. On the other hand, there

is an elongation in heave tests in which the length becomes a function of time. Therefore,

it would be possible to obtain a time-variant modal base.

In order to project in a time-invariant modal base, it is necessary to choose a length

mean value. Galerkin’s method is still valid, as the longitudinal displacement varies, the

transversal does not violates the system constrains. Mazzilli et al. (2014) presents a

closed-form solution for modes in which the elongation is considered and it is expected

that the quality of a quasi-Bessel projection for a heave test should be better than a

trigonometric ou Bessel-like.

In fact, the Rayleigh quotient might help to justify the use of the time-invariant base

on the imposed heave tests. By choosing any close-to-the-mode function, the iterative

method will present an error of second-order on the eigenvalue. Therefore, the error

caused on the analysis using the time-invariant base with 1% of model length heave
motion should not have any significant effect on the temporal modal amplitude series

obtained.

3.2 Modal oscillator

The following section is devoted to propose a modal oscillator, based on a continuum

model, T (z,t). On the other hand, the heave will be considered as an axial tension
modulation of the model. A damping term proportional to the velocity, csu?˜, is considered
as an approximation of a viscous structural damping and a damping term proportional

quadratically in the velocity (hydrodynamical drag force – Morisson’s drag) is also present

on the continuum model.

3.2.1 Mathematical formulation from the continuum

The continuum mathematical formulation is made from a wave equation with damping

terms, considering the added mass effect; see eq. 3.25, Tikhonov and Samarskii (1980).

The tension term is defined in eq. 3.26 in which Tt = T (z = L) is the tension at
the experimental top, At; the heave motion amplitude; and ?t, the imposed movement

frequency (in rad/s). As presented in Table 4.3, EA is the axial stiffness of the
experimental model (as built), the traction modulation is evaluated based on a simply

rod model in which EA/L would represent an equivalent spring constant.

T (z,t) = Tt ?? (L?z) + Td, with Td =
EA

At cos (?tt) (3.26)

It is noticeable that there is an equivalent on writing the tension term using T0 or

Tt, see eqs. 3.6 &amp;amp; 3.26, respectively: Tt ? ? (L?z) = T0 + ?z. Calling again the
separation of variables method, the modal representation of the elastica, u˜ (z,t) =
?n (t) ?˜n (z) , with n = 1, 2, . . . ,N, and rewriting eq. 3.25 in a more convenient manner:

It is necessary to call attention to some notation in eq. 3.27. First, it was used a tensor

notation to represent derivatives7; last, 0? is the vector space null vector. By using the inner
product properties, eq. 3.24, and writing mt = µ+ma, it is possible to find an integral form
of the modal oscillator; see eq. 3.29.

Finally, by doing a change of variable, putting 2? = ?tt, it is possible to define a modal

possible to analyze a linear damped Mathieu equation using a classical Strutt diagram;

see Meirovitch (2003). In the new variable, ?n, the stability chart is dislocated to the right

in the ??-parameter.

4.1 Experiments in water: a brief account on previous experiments at IPT

In this section, it shall be presented an useful guide in order to demonstrate how a

small-scale model of a real riser was designed using similitude properties. As it has

been already mentioned, the present work is a direct consequence from the R&amp;amp;D project

“Non-Linear Dynamics of Risers: non-linear interactions of hydro-elastic and contact

nature”, sponsored by Petrobras; see the preface on pg. xxi for further acknowledgments.

4.1.1 Froude similitude

In order to perform the experimental tests, it was developed a similitude algorithm in order

to represent a regular 8in diameter Steel Catenary Riser (SCR) as a small-scale model,
for laboratory practical uses. After some analysis, a collection of dimensionless control

parameters was proposed to analyse the non-linear dynamics of risers (on still water),

including non-linearities of geometric, hydro-elastic and contact nature; see Table 4.1.

Unfortunately, it is impossible to reach a model in which both Reynolds (Re) and Froude

(Fr) similarities are satisfied. Thereby, the Froude scale was chosen in order to simulate

the dynamical load due to vertical motions imposed at the top of the riser, mainly caused

by the effect of gravity waves on the floating structure to which the riser is fixed.

The Froude scale parameter, ?Fr, sets a relationship between the operational riser

and the small-scale model with the quantity features presented on Table 4.21. The scale

chosen was ?Fr = 1 : 100 which leads to non-practical external diameter order of about
O = 2mm. The solution proposed by Pereira et al. (2012) was to increase the external
diameter, keeping constant three physical quantities from the scaled-model; they are:

i. Axial stiffness: EA;

ii. Flexural length: ?f ;

iii. Added mass coefficient: Ca or a.

In order to achieve such small-scale model, it was used an iterative algorithm in which

the external and internal diameters of a silicon tube were given as known and the method

would evaluate what would be the necessary model density.

The material needed to fill the silicon tube should be very dense, but with some

restrictions, e.g., non-toxic, accessible and reusable. The solution found was a silicon

tube filled with stainless steel micro-spheres. The micro-spheres used were chosen

regarding the effective density of the material, including the voids filled with air among

the micro-spheres, leading to Ø0.5mm to the micro-spheres. A data summary with all

inroad with a small-scale riser model so sophisticated, keeping a similitude with a

real operational riser. The silicon tube chosen presented a viscous-elastic rheological

behavior, see Figure 4.2, something that was not expected a priori, since the majority of

experimental models in this field are considered to be linear-elastic.

Figure 4.2: Viscous-elastic behavior of experimental model under cyclic tension test. Maximum
engineering deformation of ? ? 0.1% at f = 1.5Hz.

As much as the small-scale model aims at an operational riser, they will not establish

a full similarity to each other, inasmuch as it is impossible to match the Re using the

Froude scale adopted. If the total length of the small-scale model tested is considered,

L = 2602mm, see Table 4.4, which would be equivalent to a depth of approximately
? 260m on the ocean. It would not be considered as very deep waters. Such details would
cause a raid in some readers who would argue that the model does not represent a SCR,

consequently a flexible vertical riser, and, in fact, the model does not; at least not strictly.

Nevertheless, the small-scale model is as close as possible of a real riser, providing

experimental results at a laboratory facility that could even be used as benchmarking

for other analytical, semi-analytical or numerical models. Thereby, in order to be more

consistent, it will be understood from now on that the present work is focused on the

dynamics of a flexible vertical cylinder, which was designed and built inspired in a real

riser with a good degree of the Froude similitude linking them.

4.1.2 Experimental set-up: a brief description

The model designed was first tested at the NDF water channel and at the CH-TPN

immersed in water and in air, in order to be familiar with the experimental assembling,

challenges and to assimilate as much knowledge as possible about the model; see

LIFE&amp;amp;MO (2012a, 2012b). The vertical model was assembled at the NDF water channel

and some preliminary experimental analyses were made at that time. A preparation for

the experimental set-up that would be mounted on the Towing Tank from IPT.

Regarding now the experimental set-up at IPT facility, it is necessary identify some

basic general data about the methodology used. First, using the previous analyses made

with the model at NDF and TPN facilities, it was determined that the phenomena studied

would concentrate their frequency spectra within a range between 0.5Hz up-tp 6.0Hz.
Overestimating the sampling frequency, it was chosen the value of Fs = 60Hz, which it is
not the best suitable choice, since the electric power supply has the same frequency, the

multiplicity by 1/3 might promote some truncate error on numerical algorithms and the
next power-of-two number is very close.

For the purpose of measuring the elastica dynamics, it was used an optical tracking

system, by Qualisys
TM

, which captures the displacement of each discrete optical target

attached to the experimental model. Two aerial cameras were used to measure the

elastica displacement of the above water model segment, and more 6 submerged
cameras in order to capture the elastica under water; see Figures 4.3–4.4. Besides, it

is possible to mention that the accuracy of the optical system is about ±0.1mm. The
relative flow around the model was created by the moving towing tank carriage, with the

velocity controlled.

order to record any tension fluctuation. Along with the load cell, a controlled servo-motor

now in this work will be considered only the cases: ft : fN,1 = 1 : 1, ft : fN,1 = 2 : 1 &amp;amp;
ft : fN,1 = 3 : 1.

It is noteworthy to regard the detailed placement of the reflexive targets; see

Figure 4.6. The reflexive target near the water surface was poorly detectable by the

monitoring system, given its problematic intermittent dynamics in-and-out of water.

Chapter 5

Experimental Analysis: methodology

and results

The following chapter is dedicated to explore some analyses that have been made, using

some of the theoretical points presented on the Chapter 3. The text will be organized on

four sections which are dedicated to:

1. Modal representation;

2. Imposed heave and modal Mathieu instability;

3. Experimental tests with flexible vertical cylinder in air:

(a) Free-Decay test and structural damping;

(b) Comparison to tests in water in order to estimate modal hydrodynamic

coefficients.

5.1 Modal representation

Previously, two simplified mathematical models have been presented which lead to

two different eigenfunction bases: the classical vibrating string and the vertical string,

reaching trigonometric and Bessel-type modes, respectively. Which modal base

represents the experimental elastica better?

5.1.1 Imposed heave motion at the top

In this section, the effects of imposed heave on the structural dynamics will be analysed.

The following cases will be considered:

i. ft : fN,1 = 1 : 1;



5.1. MODAL REPRESENTATION 40

ii. ft : fN,1 = 2 : 1;

iii. ft : fN,1 = 3 : 1.

Initially, observing the heave imposed at ft : fN,1 = 1 : 1, see Figure 5.1a–b, it is
possible to regard some interesting phenomena.

Figure 5.1: Scalograms of imposed heave – ft : fN,1 = 1 : 1.

(a) Scalogram of x? displacement. (b) Scalogram of y? displacement.

Keeping in mind it is a heave test, it could be asked why there is a difference between

directions x and y, inasmuch as the cylinder has a circular section. Considering now the

PSD of the in-line motion, the one in which occurred the travelling wave, see Figure 5.2,

shows that there is a main frequency on the response and the following harmonics are

present, but with less energy. It is interesting to think the experimental model is similar to

a piano/harp string which presents a proper energy distribution on each harmonic, as the

experimental apparatus has its own timbre.

Figure 5.2: PSD of imposed heave – ft : fN,1 = 1 : 1.

Following, it shall be considered the case in which ft : fN,1 = 3 : 1. The PSD of the
in-line direction, see Figure 5.3, shows a monochromatic response, all energy within the

third mode. The harmonic series should also appear, however, if the third harmonic is

considered as fundamental, the next frequency would be twice its value, thus, the sixth

mode. The sixth mode has little energy on it and it was not considered on the PSD plot.

Is is also not observed any super-harmonic.



5.1. MODAL REPRESENTATION 42

Figure 5.3: PSD of imposed heave – ft : fN,1 = 3 : 1.

Source: Extracted from LIFE&amp;amp;MO (2012d)

The case ft : fN,1 = 2 : 1 was left to be presented last on purpose, inasmuch as
something really beautiful appears: Mathieu instability.

Figures 5.4a–d show much information about the model dynamics. The first

phenomenon that calls attention is the “fork pattern” that can be seen on Figure 5.4a.

The fork pattern indicates a Mathieu instability at the lower half of the model. Although

the Mathieu instability occurs in the whole model,it appeared more visually in 5.4a at the

lower half of the model.

Hereupon, whether it is considered the PSD of the crossflow motion plane, see

Figure 5.4d, it might be seen a high energy peak in the second harmonic, but it is

also possible to identify a weak energy peak of the fundamental mode. There is no

coincidence and that might be seen regarding the PSD of the in-line direction, Figure 5.4c,

where the fundamental mode is the high energy peak, followed by the second harmonic.

This shows that the modes are linked to each other, being able to transfer energy from

one to the other.

Considering imposed heave, there was not any frequency above the third mode that

could be seen in Figures 5.2, 5.3 &amp;amp; 5.4c–d. If it is considered only phenomena related

to heave, as shown, there is no necessity to use more than three modes to represent

successfully the experimental elastica and there is a huge gain of analysis improvement,

inasmuch as it is no longer necessary to analyse 43 temporal series in parallel, being
sufficient only 3 up-to 4 modal temporal series to represent the same amount of dynamical
information.

One final question remains about the modal representation: which modal

eigenfunctions bases should be used in order to achieve a reliable result? According to

what was discussed previously, the only requirement an eigenfunction base shall present

is related to the Galerkin condition.

In Figure 5.5, it may be seen two different experimental data on the legend:



5.1. MODAL REPRESENTATION 44

1. Experimental (Exp.);

2. Experimental filtered (Exp. filt.).

The one called “experimental” refers to data without any pre-processing signal

analysis, such as, filtering and windowing; the other data was processed using a

band-pass filter, in order to give it a smoother aspect. In the end, the filtered data was not

necessary, because the experimental data did not introduced much numerical error on

the modal decomposition method.

Visually, the two modal bases are equivalent, but which one is more suitable? The

answer is both are equivalently suitable. The argument to verify the equivalence comes

from the Galerkin method. It is only necessary to a set of functions does not violate

kinematical constrains in order to be a good base choice.

On the other hand, the sine base has shown to be a better modal decomposition

choice for eigenvalues due to its simplicity. The Bessel-type eigenfunction requires the

numerical solution of eq. 3.14, in order to determine the eigenvalue by the transcendental

equation and, then, to obtain the modal shapes. On the other hand, the sine base does

not require any of this, being much simpler to use numerically and analytically.



5.1. MODAL REPRESENTATION 45

Figure 5.5: Modal representation using three harmonics. Experimental data and Bessel-type
eigenfunction base. VIV – VR,1 = 6.00.

(a) x? displacement.

(b) y? displacement.

The number of modes considered in which decomposition is related to how simpler the

mode is. Sine modes are the simplest and they require a major number of harmonics in

order to represent satisfactorily the elastica dynamics recomposition. More sophisticated

modes as quasi-Bessel approach, see Mazzilli et al. (2014), have a closed-form solution



5.1. MODAL REPRESENTATION 46

that may be able to reduce the total number of harmonics. A non-linear mode would

reduce the harmonic number even more. A small number of harmonics is desirable in

order to obtain Reduced Order Models (ROMs) as compact as it is possible.

Hereupon, only the trigonometric base will be considered in modal analysis. It might

be prudent testing the minimal number of harmonics, 3 up-to 4, suggested before is
sufficient.

For the sake of imposed heave, it can be remarked 3 harmonics are sufficient to
represent the ft : fN,1 = 2 : 1 case; see eq. 5.6. Despite the fact ft : fN,1 = 1 : 1 case is
not shown, it was also well-represented by only 3 harmonics.

Then again, when it is called attention to the ft : fN,1 = 3 : 1 case, something
odd occurs. Whether the 3 harmonics representation is regarded, Figure 5.7, it will be
seen that it is quite not as good as the others previously mentioned. Actually, in this

particular case, the four harmonics modal decomposition is more suitable, reaching a

very satisfying result; see Figure 5.8.

Using Sine modes, four harmonics have shown to be a better choice. If it was used,

5.2. FREE-DECAY TEST IN AIR 48

Finally, the modal decomposition used might be summed-up as:

i. Sine modal eigenfunctions;

ii. Number of harmonics to be used: 3 up-to 4.

5.2 Free-Decay Test in air

Using a free-decay test in air, it is possible to isolate the effect caused from structural

damping, since it is possible to neglect drag force due to the air. The modal structural

damping coefficients will be the first result that follows. Then, it is evaluated the modal

added mass coefficient for the experiment in water, relating it with the experiment in air.

There are three different experimental tests that consist the free decay in air, called:

Test 4; Test 5; and Test 6. The difference among them are simply the position in the

model spanwise in which the initial impulse was given. Figure 5.9 shows schematically

the impulse position in each test.

An example of a free-decay time series may be regarded in Fig.5.10. The target chosen

is placed in the model middle spanwise. From the time series of each target on the model,



5.2. FREE-DECAY TEST IN AIR 49

the modal decomposition is evaluated using trigonometrical functions, obtaining modal

time series; see Fig.5.15.

Figure 5.11 presents the scalogram of each experimental test. There is a

predominance of the first mode in the free decay test movement in air. Such behavior

is confirmed analyzing the amplitude spectra1of all tests, see Figure 5.12–5.14, in which

the power is evaluated in dB, showing that the great majority of energy is confined in the

first mode, being necessary to decay almost two decades to reach the energy levels of

second and third modes.

5.2. FREE-DECAY TEST IN AIR 53

Figure 5.15 shows that the first mode behaves very smoothly, but the second and third

modes show evidences of being polichromatic. Besides, the movement is larger in the Y

direction, as the free-decay impulse was given in that direction.

Now considering only de Y direction movement and looking more closely to the

modal series, Figures 5.16–5.27 show that the chosen modal decomposition using a

trigonometric base produces a modal amplitude series that is not monochromatic. The

amplitude spectrogram shown in Figures 5.16–5.27 were obtained by creating a classic

FFT spectrum of each one and, by windowing samples, one-by-one. In order to evaluate

the FFT in each sample, a Kaiser window was used, so the spectra information is centered

in the middle of the sample. The energy within each frequency in the amplitude spectrum

is given in dB/Hz.

Using Test 4 as an example, Figures 5.17, 5.19 and 5.21 bring attention to some

interesting aspects of each modal amplitude series. The first mode is essentially

monochromatic and it is a general decaying response, as aforementioned when the

Figure5.15 was presented. The next modes do not have the same fortune, needing

more attention.

The second mode has a composition of frequencies in which the dominant response

has the frequency of the first mode. The damping effect of each mode appears to increase

with the number mode, inasmuch as the higher modes seems to decay faster than the

first. In order to estimate the damping coefficient of any mode, the initial signal interval

is necessary, but that is the region where the mixture of harmonics causes a unsuitable

signal behavior to be analyzed.

A simple band-pass filter was applied in the signal FFT spectrum, trying to reach a

modal series suitable for the decaying analysis. The second mode is filtered as shown in

Figure 5.19 and the filtered temporal series is simply evaluated with the inverse FFT. The

result obtained is not close to the original signal and it leaded to a damping coefficient

that needs to be analyzed together with the damping coefficient obtained with the other

tests.

When the same procedure is used with the third mode, see Figure 5.21, the

reconstructed signal is very close to the original, providing a damping coefficient more

suitable.

Table 5.1 presents a summary of all damping coefficients and natural frequencies

estimates using data from Figures 5.18, 5.20, 5.22, 5.24–5.26, 5.28–5.30. Adopting

a visual criteria when comparing the reconstructed filtered signal in time domain, the

more suitable results considered to be valid are emphasized in Table 5.1 and the mean

values of modal structural linear damping coefficients and natural frequencies are given

in Table 5.2.

5.2.2 Modal Added Mass

Resetting the added mass parameter has a direct influence on the eigenvalues of the

system. Moreover, the buoyancy effect changes the immersed weight of the model, also

changing some modal parameters, e.g., modal rigidity; see eq. 3.30.

It will be considered that the fundamental link between the model immersed in water

and the other in air is their geometric rigidity. Using eq. 3.30 notation:

?nw = ?nair (5.1)

Considering only the sine eigenfunction, setting the weight function of the inner

product to be unitary, w (z) = 1; see eq. 3.24, Equation 5.1 can be stated as:

?nw =
? L

0
{?i?n,z + [Ttw ??i (L?z)] ?n,zz}?ndz =

=
? L

0
{??n,z + [Ttair ?? (L?z)] ?n,zz}?ndz = ?nair (5.2)

Using now the eigenfunction definition, ?n (z) = sin (n?z/L), and evaluating its first
and second derivative, it is possible to perform the integral in eq. 5.2 analytically, reaching

the following result shown in Table 5.3.

By definition, the immersed weight (per unit of length) is the structural weight

decreased of the buoyancy effect, thus: ?i = (µ???wD2/4) g and ? = µg. Finally,
together with eq. 5.3, it is possible to find the value of the traction at the top of the model

which sets the same axial rigidity for both environments; see eq. 5.4.

Regarding the model parameters, see Table 4.4, it is possible to approximately

evaluate2 eq. 5.4, obtaining:

Ttair = 45.10N (5.5)

In the free decay experimental test analyzed, the tension imposed at the top time

series may be seen in Fig.5.31. The mean value of the tension is T = 47.36N, being very
close to the predicted value; see eq.5.5.

Table 5.4 shows numerical values of axial stiffness for both experimental set-ups in

water and in air. The axial rigidity equivalence is shown evaluating the parameter in both

cases and noting that they are equivalent mode by mode.

2In fact, given the elastic behavior of the material, the solution is iterative, since the model will stretch
when solicited.

Furthermore, using the axial rigidity equivalence, the modal added mass is a

The added mass coefficient defined in eq. 5.7 is a relation between the added mass

and the fluid displaced mass from the body, ma = Camd. Alternatively, the added mass
coefficient may be defined as a relation between added mass and the structure mass:

Amplitude spectrum density charts, see Figs.5.12–5.14, show which dominant

frequencies coexist in the analyzed signal. The data is organized in Tab.5.5, as follows.

Table 5.5: Modal added mass

3 2.52 3.0985 1.5074 0.5118 0.3998

Analyzing Table 5.5 added mass coefficients an and a?n evaluated from different

methods, two behaviors come to attention. The first is quite immediate that the added

mass an increases with higher modes. On the other hand, the added mass a?n decreases.

Both approaches lead to an equivalent result for the first mode, but the discrepancy of

others results only increases higher the next mode is. The coefficient order is the same

in both methods.

Considering the experiments presented in Sarpkaya (1977) with a rigid

cylinder in a constant oscillatory flow, non-dimension numbers as Reynolds (Re),

Keulegan-Carpenter (KC) and the frequency parameter (?KC)3give a hint of what should

be obtained for added mass coefficient and drag coefficient.

The free-decay test is non-stationary, so it is outside the experiments described in

Sarpkaya (1977). On the other hand, the free-decay is asymptotic to the trivial equilibrium

response and there is a possibility to find a initial range of the inertial coefficient in order

to inspect consistency with respect to the results shown in Table 5.5.

Figures 5.33a–b shown a typical free-decay in water. Choosing a modal amplitude of

approximately Ay1/D = 0.05 and Ay1/D = 0.04, the KC number order is less than the
unity (O (KC) = 10?1). Looking at Figure 5.32, the Cm curve is asymptotic near 2 to low
KC number and all Re range considered. The inertia coefficient indicates that CaN ? 1
for both modes (Cm = Ca + 1).

Such result appears, at a first analysis, non consistent with the added mass coefficient

presented in Table 5.5. In fact, the added mass evaluated from both experimental

approaches are greater than the unity suggested by Sarpkaya (1977). Nevertheless,

Pesce and Fujarra (2000) have also found an added mass value for a flexible cantilever

greater than the unity (Ca,1 = 1.17). Thorsen et al. (2016), analyzing experimental data of
a flexible cylinder subjected to an oscillatory flow presented by Fu et al. (2014), also found

added mass coefficient value greater than the unity (Ca = 1.53). It should be recalled that
the Sarpkaya charts were obtained for rigid cylinders under oscillatory flow, not for flexible

cylinders.



5.3. PARAMETRIC RESONANCE AND MATHIEU INSTABILITY 71

5.3 Parametric resonance and Mathieu instability

This section is dedicated to explore the possibility to occur a modal Mathieu instability

due to imposed heave motion. Mathieu instability is caused by a bifurcation on the

dynamical system, in which the stable center turns into unstable focus with a limit cycle

(Hopf bifurcation) for the trivial solution.

The Strutt diagram relates the Mathieu oscillator parameters, see eqs. 3.32–3.33, into

a chart-guide which can predict whether the system will be on a stable or unstable region

for the trivial solution. The Strutt diagram is determined by a linear oscillator, with or

without an equivalent damping term. However what would be the effects of considering

a non-linear oscillator with a quadratically damping term, as the hydrodynamic drag?

This question might be answered by parts, using local pertubation techniques.

Ramani et al. (2004) presented an approach in which, by considering the quadratically

damping term, the Strutt diagram shows a second bifurcation, see Figure 5.34,

determined by the red line. This line is evaluated using a local perturbation method and

the bifurcation line is better defined when closer to the point P. The point P is determined

in the critical point where the derivative change its signal in the Strutt diagram first stability

tongue.

The modal oscillator presented in Ramani et al. (2004) uses ?? =
(
?N
?t

)2
. The

difference between ?? and ? defined in eq. 3.32 is a factor of four, leading to a Strutt chart

equivalent, however in a different scale.

The “correction” provided by the method is interesting, inasmuch as, for a linear

system, whether it is located in the area above the second bifurcation line, but outside

the tongues, the Strutt diagram would predict a stable behavior for the trivial solution;

instead, the quadratically damping term causes the same region to be unstable.

Considering the Mathieu-Hill oscillator in eq. 3.33, the Strutt diagram seen in fig.

5.35 shows that the bifurcation occurs every time the system leaves the dashed area.

Considering the tongue tips at the line ? = 0, it is possible to determine the relation
between driven frequency and natural frequency necessary to leads the system into a

Mathieu instability analyzing the oscillator ?-parameter.

Among the imposed heave experiments analyzed, there are cases in which the

relation between the driven and natural frequencies are ft : fN,1 = 1 : 1, ft : fN,1 = 2 : 1
and ft : fN,1 = 3 : 1. In ft : fN,1 = 1 : 1 and ft : fN,1 = 2 : 1 cases, whether the trivial
solution becomes unstable, it will be caused by a Mathieu instability; otherwise any other

instability can not be Mathieu-type. The modal Strutt diagrams for the flexible vertical

cylinder in water can be seen in fig. 5.36.

5.3. PARAMETRIC RESONANCE AND MATHIEU INSTABILITY 75

Considering the first mode, the reader can identify the blue square data (ft : fN,1 = 3 :
1) in Fig. 5.36a. Only the red square (ft : fN,1 = 1 : 1) and green square (ft : fN,1 = 2 : 1)
are to be considered as Mathieu instability if they are inside a unstable region. A close look

can assure that both points are inside a unstable region. Therefore the trivial solutions for

first mode in the ft : fN,1 = 1 : 1 and ft : fN,1 = 2 : 1 parametric excitation are unstable.
The second mode eigenfrequency ?N,2 ? 2?N,1, inasmuch as the model in water

holds the Pythagorean harmonic series. In that case only there is only one Mathieu

instability due to the ft : fN,1 = 2 : 1 that corresponds to the ft : fN,2 = 2 : 2; the green
square in Figure 5.36b.

The same procedure for the third mode leads to ?N,3 ? 3?N,1 and, among the driven
frequencies, only ft : fN,1 = 3 : 1 (ft : fN,3 = 3 : 3) and ft : fn,1 = 2 : 1 (ft : fN,3 = 2 : 3)
are Mathieu instabilities of the trivial solution; respectively, the blue square and green

square in Figure 5.36c.

The results obtained with the Strutt diagram is summed up in Table 5.6. Those results

obtained are consistent with the power spectra shown in Figures 5.2, 5.3, 5.4c–d where

the trivial solution is unstable and the system finds another periodic solution for each

mode. The composition of modes provides scalograms as shown in Figures 5.4a–b in

which the coexistence of more than one mode in the elastica dynamics can be verified.

Introducing Reduce Order Models (ROMs) similar to the ROM described in eq. 3.32,

Franzini et al. (2015) has reached to numerical simulations of each mode, as seen in

Figures 5.37–5.39; see Table 5.7.

Comparing the results obtained by means of Strutt diagrams and the response of the

ROMs gives some interesting findings about the instability of the trivial solution when

the Strutt diagram is not clear enough, e.g., regions near the bifurcation. Furthermore,



5.3. PARAMETRIC RESONANCE AND MATHIEU INSTABILITY 76

multifrequency response composed of subharmonics are also found, a result that the

Strutt diagrams could not anticipate. Quoting Franzini et al. (2015):

Another interesting finding is that, whenever the Strutt diagram

did not clearly predict a single periodic solution for a given

mode, the spectral analysis revealed a multifrequency response

in that mode. In other words, periodic solutions emerging

from Mathieu-like instabilities appear to dominate other possible

harmonic components in a given mode. (FRANZINI ET AL., 2015,

p. 11).

In the first mode, see Figure 5.37, there are periodic solutions for ft/fN,1 = 1 : 1 and
ft/fN,1 = 2 : 1, as predicted in Table 5.6. Also as expected by Strutt diagram analysis,
the ft/fN,1 = 3 : 1 is stable.

The second mode is a little more interesting as there is a subharmonic response,

see Figure 5.38. There are periodic solutions for ft/fN,1 = 2 : 1 (ft/fN,2 = 2 : 2) and
ft/fN,1 = 3 : 1 (ft/fN,2 = 3 : 2) as also predicted by the Strutt diagram. In addition,
there is a quasi-periodic solution for ft/fN,1 = 1 : 1 (ft/fN,2 = 1 : 2) in which the power
spectrum shows a composition of the harmonic fr/fN,2 = 2 : 2 with a subharmonic
fr/fN,2 = 1/2.

Figure 5.39 shows results for the third mode. By Strutt diagram analysis, the ft/fN,1 =
2 : 1 (ft/fN,3 = 2 : 3) and ft/fN,1 = 3 : 1 (ft/fN,1 = 3 : 3) trivial solutions are known to
be unstable. Besides, subharmonics fr/fN,3 = 1/3 and fr/fN,3 = 2/3 can be seen
in the ft/fN,1 = 1 : 1 case; and a subharmonic fr/fN,3 = 4/3 is associated with the
ft/fN,3 = 2 : 3 in the response of ft/fN,1 = 2 : 1.

The results obtained using Strutt diagram analysis and the spectral analysis of ROMs

response are summarized in Table 5.8.

Conclusions

Alongside the experimental tests with a vertical flexible cylinder immersed in water

described in LIFE&amp;amp;MO (2012d), a new experimental test using the same model in similar

conditions was performed in order to obtain parameters, as: structural modal damping

coefficients and modal added mass coefficient.

For the sake of simplicity, the modal decomposition chosen used eigenfunctions

based on a trigonometric base. The results obtained by using the trigonometric base

were both satisfactory in the experiments in water and in air.

The experimental test conducted in air provided, successfully, modal structural

damping, when subjected to a free-decay test. The modal damping coefficients are

shown in Tab.5.2. These coefficients will be of importance in further analysis in order

to understand how much damping is caused by the structure itself, or by the drag

force in water. Understanding the difference between structural and hydrodynamical

damping is crucial, inasmuch as the structural damping is considered to be proportional

do the relative velocity of the structure, while the hydrodynamic damping is essentially

non-linear.

The most interesting result obtained using the free-decay test in air was the evaluation

of the modal added mass coefficient in still water. Such prediction is said to be in still water,

since it would be necessary a different experimental procedure to capture damping during

a towing-tank run, by studying transitory responses.

As discussed before, there are some important points to be considered in the added

mass results. The first is the difference between the increasing (aN ) or decreasing (a?N )

behavior of added mass coefficient with increase of the mode number. Such behavior

could not be explained with the present work. Additional analysis, including numerical

models, could be used in order to verify which of the results are more consistent. However

the first mode added mass is equivalent in both approaches used, a1 = 0.4158 ? 0.4201 =
a?1.

The second important consideration to be done about the added mass coefficient

refers to Sarpkaya (1977) results for a rigid cylinder under the effect of a oscillatory flow

around it. Sarpkaya showed that the inertia coefficient has a asymptotic value (Cm =
1 + Ca ? 2, Ca ? 1) for low KC number at any Reynolds number considered.

The added mass, Ca found in Table 5.5 is greater than the unity predicted by Sarpkaya.

However another experiment with a flexible structure presented in Pesce and Fujarra

(2000) has also shown a added mass coefficient greater than the unity. The case

presented in Pesce and Fujarra (2000) is a cantilever and the added mass was evaluated

using a relation between natural frequencies in air and in water likewise performed in the

present work.

The discussion about the value of flexible cylinder added mass coefficient is not a

closed subject. In fact, the recent work by Thorsen et al. (2016), e.g., on flexible cylinders

in oscillating flows, still uses Ca = 1 in its proposed empirical hydrodynamic model. The
experimental work by Fu et. al (2014), where a flexible cylinder is transversally excited

with sinusoidal displacements applied at the extremities, does not investigate the modal

added mass, also using Ca = 1.
Franzini et al. (2016), using nonlinear oscillators obtained through the Galerkin’s

projection technique, using sinusoidal modes, investigate the response sensitivity of the

vertical flexible cylinder subjected to parametric excitation to the parameters CD and Ca,

varied within a significant interval.

In the present work the modal added mass coefficients, Ca, are larger than unity, the

asymptotic limit when KC goes to zero for rigid cylinders subjected to oscillatory flows;

Sarpkaya (1977).

Reasons for that are not clear at this point and could be related to the choice of

the modal basis. A more represantive basis, as that called quasi-Bessel, could lead

to dinstinct results; see Dias (2015).

It should be emphasized that the methods applied in the present work to obtain

the modal added mass coefficients rely on decay tests only. Such point is essential

in the definition of representative KC and Reynolds numbers, inasmuch as the amplitude

varies in the free-decay and many of the hydrodynamic coefficients are function of the

amplitude.

Parametric resonance and Mathieu instability of the heave imposed experimental

tests in water were also explored in the present analysis. Strutt diagram predicted

unstable trivial solutions for some modes, leading to periodic solutions. The Mathieu

instability was discussed in the previous chapter; see p. 71.

Numerical results obtained with reduced-order models in Franzini et al. (2015) show

that, even in situations when the Strutt diagram does not predict instability of the trivial

solution, a response dominated by subharmonics is possible, leading the system to a

new quasi-periodical modal amplitude solution; see Table 5.8.

The presence of dominant subharmonic response in cases in which Strutt diagram did

not predict any stable periodical solution is a very interesting result found. This is closely



CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS 83

linked to the process of choosing a modal basis in order to decompose the movement.

The trigonometric base used has monochromatic modes and the experimental analysis

indicates the presence of subharmonics, associating the structure frequency modes with

the driven frequency.

In fact, the discussion on the proper modal basis choice permeates the whole

analysis. The Galerkin criteria must hold for any Eigen function chosen and the

trigonometric modes are, in fact, the simplest possible. The finite number of modes

necessary in order to reconstruct the elastica dynamics would decrease with a better

choice of modal shapes. Quasi-Bessel modes appear as a good choice, since written in

a closed-form and they already including non-linear effects of curvature and elongation;

see Mazzilli et al. (2014).

As further topics of research, a few are mentioned in the following paragraphs.

Similar to the study of parametric resonance and Mathieu instability of the

experiments with imposed parametric heave in water, there is a database of experiments

in air with parametric imposed heave. The difference between being immersed in water

and air will be to enlarge the Strutt diagram unstable tongue regions as effect of the

damping be greater in water than in air. Such difference might bring more subharmonics

to the response, or cause parametric resonance in modes that were stable in water.

It is also possible to use a non-linear Reduced Order Model (ROM) in order to evaluate

the effect of some hydrodynamical coefficients, as added mass and non-linear damping;

Franzini et al. (2015) and Franzini et al. (2016). It would be interesting to compare the

results obtained using the analytical-numerical ROM with the experimental results in

water obtained with modal decomposition techniques.

The use of Floquet theory and evaluation of characteristic exponents to study the

stability of trivial solution of a modal Mathieu-Hill oscillator can also provide a new

methodology to predict when the bifurcation will occur in some mode for a certain imposed

heave, complementary to the use of Strutt diagram.

Other possible inroad to take is using some better representation base for the modal

decomposition. The quasi-Bessel base has a closed-form solution, being very easy to be

adapted to the modal decomposition algorithms. Some advantages of the quasi-Bessel

mode was already mentioned, but it is very useful to point out again that those modes

inherited properties of a non-linear beam model, which is more robust than any cable

model using trigonometric ou classical Bessel modes; see Mazzilli et al. (2014).

Numerical models (CFD) could be used in order to assess the added

mass experimental estimates. Besides, numerical models could lead to a full

characterization of hydrodynamics coefficients in a wide range of Reynolds number and

Keulegan-Carpenter number.



CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS 84

Fu et al. (2014) and Thorsen et al. (2016) present interesting results of hydrodynamic

forces on a flexible cylinder. Further experiments in order to assess the inertia coefficient

would assist towards a deeper understanding of added mass results obtained in the

present work.

Another topic that may be addressed is the experimental tests with incident flow,

dealing with concomitant fluid-structure phenomena, as Vortex Induced Vibration and

parametric resonance. This can be carried out by analysing the enormous experimental

data base already available from the experiments at IPT; see LIFE&amp;amp;MO (2012d).

In the present work, only the vertical flexible cylinder was studied. However, as

presented in the Preface, p. xxi, experimental tests were also carried out for “catenary”

configurations at the IPT facility; see LIFE&amp;amp;MO (2012c). Pereira (2014) has already

carried out an extensive experimental analsyis ov VIV of “catenary” configurations,

by using Galerkin’s projections on proper numerically determined modes. Further

modal analysis with the “catenary” model in order to assess hydrodynamics coefficients,

numerical calibration of modal phenomenological models, parametric resonance and

Mathieu instabilities, as well as the effects of modal decomposition using non-linear

modes.
