ABSTRACT – A few examples of supergene ore formation and their interaction with morphogenesis (palaeosurfaces) and weathering
mineralogy are discussed. Geomorphological and mineralogical records to characterize palaeosurfaces associate the weathering of primary
minerals and their relationship with concentrations of cooper and iron ore deposits in southeastern state of São Paulo, Brazil. We have
distinguished two palaeosurfaces generated by several weathering phases and controlled by the geological framework. The first and oldest
upper palaeosurfaces (900 – 1000 m a.s.l.), situated in Riberão Branco (Alto do Brancal), were developed on silico-limestones. It is
formed by typical iron laterites enriched by secondary products of cooper. The second and younger level palaeosurfaces located in
Itapeva (Santa Blandina and Bairro do Sambra). This palaeosurface is formed by copper percolating through the weathered rock
(saprolite). Other features can be observed like neo-formed products in laterites. They are classified into two types: clay like silico-
cupriferous products (with noticeable amounts of iron) and copper minerals (crysocolla, in their flat slopes). These features allowed the
presence of copper ores and their morphogenesis control will help in the exploration and prospecting of supergene ore mineral.

RESUMO – L.F.B. Ribeiro &amp;amp; M.C. Siqueira Ribeiro – Mapeamento de Paleosuperfícies associadas a identificação de depósitos supérgenos
de cobre como ferramenta de exploração mineral na região de Itapeva e Ribeirão Branco- Vale do Ribeira, estado de São Paulo, Brasil.
Alguns exemplos de formação de minério supérgeno e sua interação com a morfogênese (paleosuperfícies) e resistência mineralógica são
discutidas aqui. Registros geomorfológicos e mineralógicos na caracterização paleosuperfícies associam o intemperismo de minerais primários
e sua relação com as concentrações de cobre e minério de ferro no sudeste do estado de São Paulo, Brasil. Distinguiram-se duas paleosuperfícies
geradas por várias fases de intemperismo e controladas pela estrutura geológica. A primeira, mais antiga, é a paleosuperfície superior (900 -
1000 m de altitude), situado em Ribeirão Branco (Alto do Brancal), foram desenvolvidas em rochas silico-calcários. É formada por lateritas
de ferro enriquecido por produtos secundários de cobre. O segundo nível de paleosuperfície é mais novo está localizado na região de Itapeva
(Santa Blandina e Bairro do Sambra). Esta paleosuperfície é formada por percolação de cobre através da rocha alterada (saprolito). Outras
características podem ser observadas como produtos neoformados em lateritas. Eles são classificados em dois tipos: a argila como produtos
silico-cuprífero (com quantidades significativas de ferro) e de cobre minerais (crisocola, fixas nas vertentes). Essas feições reconheceram a
presença de minérios de cobre e seu controle morfogénetico ajudando na exploração e prospecção de minérios supérgenos.

Deep chemical weathering on peneplained
landsurfaces can produce supergene ore deposits
whose content of minable elements may be related to
their pre-concentracion in the host rocks. During certain
moments in Earth history, special sub-aerial and
supergene environments led to extreme geochemical
separation, enrichment or depletion of certain elements
(Valenton, 1983, 1985; Melfi et al., 1979).

Element stability during weathering processes
depends upon the bounding energy of the primary
mineral, the different behavior of polyvalent elements
in relation to Eh conditions and the chemical
composition of the interstitial solution during
decomposition and neoformation. According to Valenton
(1985), the mineral or element stability in the supergene
layer may be grouped as follows:



São Paulo, UNESP,  Geociências, v. 29,  n. 4, p. 519-526, 2010 520

1. Those which are relativity stable in minerals like
hematite (Fe), cassiterite (Sn), zircon (Zn) and gold
(Au);

2. Those with became enriched by neomineralization
(layer silicates, Al, Ni, Cu);

3. Neomineralization oxides and oxihidrates (Al, Mn,
Fe, Co, Ni) correlative to parent rocks

4. Neomineralization of the carbonates, sulfates,
phosphates and arsenates (Cu, P, Al);

5. Supergene minerals or element concentration is
related to morphology and topography.
The Santa Blandina cupriferous mineralization is

constituted by a weathered skarnite. It is formed by
supergenous concentration of copper and residual laterites
enrichment of iron and copper. This mineralization is a
case example for the studies and mechanisms of
accumulation of supergene copper.  Previous studies
carried out in the area by Creach (1988) and Creach et

LOCATION  AND  GEOLOGICAL  SETTING

al. (1991, 1992) characterized the copper supergenous
accumulation, both from a mineralogical viewpoint, as
well as in cristalochemistry.  From such studies it may
be concluded that, during the weathering process, copper
was liberated from the structure of the primary sulphites.
Consequently, these primary sulphites were
incorporated to the infiltrating solution that took part in
the alteration of the escarnites and the whole-rock
limestone, and in the elaboration of the secondary
phases (carbonates, oxides and silicates).  The copper
is found associated in the silicate phase, constituted by
esmectites and interstratified with kaolinites- esmectites
and crysocolla (Creach et al., 1992).

This work intends to contribute upon the relation
of the palaeosurfaces with the distribution and genesis
of the supergenous deposits and iron/copper laterite
profiles in the Itapeva (São Paulo) region and adjacent
areas.

The research area is located in the southern region
of the state of São Paulo, between the Guapiara,
Itapeva and Riberão Branco areas (Figure 1).  The
main routes in the study area are the Presidente Castelo
Branco highway (SP-280) from Sorocaba and the
Raposos Tavares highway (SP-270) from Itapetininga.
There are other routes like SP-127 from Capão Bonito
and SP-258 to Itapeva (São Paulo) that provide access
to the area.

The study area is included in the southern segment
of the Mantiqueira Tectonic Province, dominated by
structures related to the Neoproterozoic Brasiliano/Pan
African Orogeny from 640 to 480 Ma (Cordani et al.,
2000; Heilbron et al., 2000, 2004). The geological
framework is dominated by several long NE trending
fault zones, which separate many tectonic blocks. It
contains Mesoproterozoic (ca. 1,750-1,450 Ma) and
Neoproterozoic supracrustal sequences (ca. 800-600
Ma) revealing a polycyclic evolution (Cordani et al.,
2000; Basei et al., 2009).

The area comprises the Apiaí Folded Belt (AFB),
which is a domain of the southern portion of the Ribeira
Belt. In the Paraná and São Paulo states, southern
Brazil, it is composed of met volcanic-sedimentary
rocks, of low to medium metamorphic grade, grouped
in the Açungui Supergroup (Campanha and Sadowski,
1999). The Neoproterozoic granitic rocks are
represented by the Cunhaporanga, Três Córregos and

Agudos Grandes batholiths which intrude the
supracrustal rocks. Both groups are affected by latter
granitic stocks (Corrêas, Sambra and Itaoca granite).
In the study areas of Santa Blandina and Alto do
Brancal (Figure 1), the rocks have undergone intense
mineralization process associated with a syn tectonic
granitic batholith. This granitic batholith is in contact
zone with limestone lenses which caused the skarnite
generation (Arruda, 1971). The metassomatic process
led to cupper remobilization and concentration in the
skarnite zone, in the shape of pockets and veins with
sulfide, chalcopyrite and bornite. This mineralization
zone extends for 400 meters long by 150 meters and is
flanked by metasedimentary and amphibolitic rocks
(Creach et al., 1991, 1992).

The Paraná Basin sequence area formed by
conglomerates ans sandstones rocks of the Itararé
group and siltites correlated of the Furnas Fm.These
sequences were tilted and the surface was uplifted,
partly eroded and  unconformably overlain by a thick
sequence (~1500 m) of Early Cretaceous Paraná
continental flood basalts (Renne et al., 1992, 1996). In
some parts, the area chracterized by these lithologies  is
cut by basic dykes, mostly with a NW, and rarely with a
NE, direction, associated to the Guapiara alignment. The
fault reactivation effects caused deep changes in the
drainage network pattern, the palaeosurfaces and the
dissection of the copper deposits.

METHODOLOGY
A general topographical overview for a preliminary

study, based on field work and digital elevation data,
was obtained. Large-scale landforms in the study area
were identified using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM)



São Paulo, UNESP, Geociências, v. 29,  n. 4, p. 519-526, 2010 521

imported by ArcGIS software. The large-scale
landforms have been analyzed by the major
morphological elements: the drainage network pattern
and the palaeosurfaces distribution. The DEM was used
to construct a model of distribution and height of the
plateau remnants above sea level.

Landform analysis was carried out in a digital
elevation model (DEM) in a 50x50 meters resolution
square grid, constructed by topographic maps. Based
on the given information of the study area, the analysis

was applied according to the methods developed for
mapping and recognizing these landforms postulated
by King (1956), Twidale (1997), and Granell-Pérez
(2004). In this map, altitudes of the palaeosurfaces and
valleys were identified through the numerical
digitalization of various topographic contours.

A general topographical overview was obtained
by a study based on field work and digital elevation
data (Ribeiro, 2008) and the description of landforms
in the southeastern part of the study area by taken



São Paulo, UNESP,  Geociências, v. 29,  n. 4, p. 519-526, 2010 522

from Arruda (1971) and Ponçano et al. (1981).
After this procedure, the landforms were analyzed

in several steps. Firstly, a surface/slope map of the
southern study area was designed. Areas with slope
angles less than 6.5° were defined as palaeosurfaces,
extracted and colored according to height above sea
level. After the elimination of flat valley bottoms at
high and medium elevations, the final map with flat
palaeosurface levels was obtained. These
palaeosurface levels were constructed on closed
topographic contours representing restricted summits.
The mapping resulted in a description of the several
palaeosurface levels and the identification of fault
blocks.

Palaeosurface levels could be interpreted in
different ways: as indicators of river-dissected,
denudation surfaces or as the result of the interaction
of the climate stability. The analysis of the landforms

in the study area resulted in the identification of two
planation surfaces at higher elevations. The first
palaeosurface level is situated at 660-720 m a.s.l. on
the low lying block to the north of the Sambra and
Santa Blandina areas and it has undergone deeper
erosion than other areas nearby. Another palaeosurface
level was mapped at 860-920 m a.s.l. on the higher
block of the Alto do Brancal area (Figure 1) but it has
not suffered as deep erosion as the other palaeosurface
recognized before.

The morphological description of the paleosols
followed the procedure proposed by Thomas (1994),
Widdowson (1997) and Twidale (2002) and the soil
terminology by Ollier (1991). In Figure 2, surface
deposits were recognized, by means of the soil
description in profile, which consisted in the construction
in profiles of the soils and paleosols found on the mapped
palaeosurfaces.

FIGURE 2.  Typical textbook illustration of a laterite profile (modified after Ollier, 1991);
Rock structure is usually preserved in the saprolite and mottled zones indicate
that these zones consist of in situ weathered rock with no volume alteration.

DISCUSSION

Through our investigations in the study area, we
can state that it underwent a distinct series of cyclic
events characterized by phases of deep weathering,
where the accommodation space was provided by large
scale tectonic deformation, alternating with periods
during which the supergene deposits were firstly
uplifted and then dissected.

After cartographic recognition, fieldwork was
conducted and the palaeosurfaces that characterize
these areas were recognized, namely:

The first palaeosurface level represented in the
map by a  red color was recognized in the northern
area, near Itapeva (SP) (Sambra and Santa Brandina
areas) with elevations ranging from 660 to 720 m a.s.l.,



São Paulo, UNESP, Geociências, v. 29,  n. 4, p. 519-526, 2010 523

developed on the Furnas Formation and the Itaiacoca
Group. It is comprised by granite and limestone,
respectively (Theodorovicz et al. 1988), with the
presence of two diabase dykes, highly fractured and
altered to Oxisols with the presence of esmectites,
kaolinites and goethite. In this palaeosurface level, it
was observed that the distribution of hills is highly
dependent on density of joints and fractures and it is
known that deep weathering is favored by structural
weaknesses in bedrock and it enhances landform

patterns controlled by fractures and joints. This is
represented by the reddish color related to Oxisols
(Figures 3 and 4).

The second palaeosurface level is located in the
southern area (Figure 3, yellow colored area), in the
Alto do Brancal (Ribeirão Branco county) with the
altitudes ranging between 860-920 m (Figure 4). In the
palaeosurface level, two laterites phases interspersed
with sand paleosols were recognized, which allowed
considering this as the oldest surface.

In the area where the Second Palaeosurface level
was observed during field work, the distribution of hills
is highly dependent on the relative density of joints and
fractures.

The landform analysis in the second palaeosurface
level led to the identification of a higher and well
preserved surface flat level, particularly well developed
in the northeastern part of the study area. It was
observed that the palaeosurface level distribution is
dependent upon the host rock weathering and its
resistance rate, which is affected by the velocity and
changes in the chemical and mineralogical alteration
and the geological and geomorphological factors. These
mechanisms forced deep weathering due to changes
in landform patterns controlled by fractures and joints,
thus generating residual copper deposits.

In the northern area, where the palaeosurfaces (red
area in Figure 5) were developed on basalts, they are
forming oxisols and, where they formed on the Furnas

Fm. sandstones, rare sandy soils These sandy soils are
overlying a profile change of almost 25 meters thick
(Creach et al., 1991) that corresponds to the saprolite
with argilomorphic products (Kaolinitte, montmorilonite
and smectite) and large amounts of chrysocolla. These
deposits were formed by the action of the in situ changes
and the drainage (Figure 2 and Figure 6 A, B).

In the southern area where the second
palaeosurface is located (yellow areas in Figure 5),
the laterites are a large iron ore deposit formed by two-
level laterite formation. Analyzing the profile of the
Figure 6 C, it can be seen that there is a small copper
deposit in this area, located on the lower slope, but at a
much higher altitude than in previous instances, which
is represented only by oxidized copper minerals (azurite,
malachite). Azurite occurs in the rock and also features
in the laterite profile therefore the migration of copper
was from the rock to the saprolite zone, but only iron
migrated to the surface forming laterite profile.

CONCLUSIONS

The combined results of the geomorphological and
chemical analyses (Ribeiro, 2009), together with the
soil description in the studied areas, allow the following
conclusions:

Palaeosurface level 1 is the lowest level and a
larger occurrence of rock alteration has been
preserved there (25 m of saprolite horizon), together
with the presence of silicate minerals, such as
chrysocolla and clays. Copper was accumulated in
the cementation zone in the form of chrysocolla and
malachite. In this profile, Fe has accumulated

residually forming an iron hat, nowadays partially
removed and modified.

Palaeosurfaces level 2 is the higher of the two
preserved levels. It presents in situ lateritic horizons
showing two overlapping climate phases, which are
indicated by traces of copper in the saprolite. The
migration of iron to the residual area occurs with the
concomitant elimination by leaching and hydrolysis of
the oxidized zone, which defined the boundaries of the
extension reaction (alteration haloes), with outcropping
azurite and other oxidized copper ores.
