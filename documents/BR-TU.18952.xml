Abstract 
 

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the potential benefits of the Luiz 

Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP) to three of the most important species for the local small 

scale artisanal fisheries: the white seabream, the Senegalese sole and the cuttlefish. 

Since this marine protected area (MPA) was implemented before the beginning of this 

study we also investigated if any changes had already occurred in the abundance or 

biomass of these species inside the MPA. 

High site fidelity was observed in white seabream with all individuals tagged with V9 

acoustic transmitters being detected over 50% of the time (average of 85%). Although 

some Senegalese sole showed high site fidelity the majority of the individuals tagged 

were more transient. Cuttlefish demonstrated no site fidelity to the study area, 

spending a maximum of 39 days inside the monitored area. The home range areas 

(95% KUD) ranged between 0.43 and 1.28 km2 (average of 0.65 km2) for white 

seabream and between 0.54 and 2.22 km2 (average of 1.19 km2) for Senegalese sole. 

The results obtained for cuttlefish were not coherent given the low site fidelity 

presented by this species. White seabream demonstrated a clear preference for rocky 

bottoms habitats while Senegalese sole prefer sandy bottoms, especially medium grain 

size sand. 

The results of experimental fishing trials revealed no significant differences in the 

abundance or biomass of Senegalese sole or cuttlefish between the periods before and 

after the implementation of the LSMP. 

The species distribution models obtained with Maxent indicate that most of the LSMP 

presents suitable habitats for cuttlefish but only a small proportion is suitable for the 

Senegalese sole and white seabream. The Senegalese sole suitable habitats are mainly 

found in sandy areas facing south whereas the white seabream suitable habitats are 

restricted to the narrow rocky areas that border the coastline. 



10 
 

Our results suggest that the existing marine reserve may offer appropriate protection 

for Senegalese sole and white seabream. However, given the low site fidelity and the 

large movements of cuttlefish the LSMP does not provide adequate protection for this 

species.  

According to the results of the different scenarios obtained with Marxan the design of 

the LSMP could be improved in order to offer more protection to habitats that are not 

sufficiently protected with the current design.

Resumo 
 

Nas últimas décadas, a pressão antropogénica sobre os ecossistemas marinhos tem 

aumentado em magnitude e diversidade, causando uma degradação drástica destes 

ambientes. Este facto tem levantado sérias preocupações e levou a apelos para a 

implementação de medidas que visam proteger, preservar e restaurar os ecossistemas 

marinhos. Uma das medidas que tem recebido maior atenção e apoio por parte da 

comunidade científica nos últimos 30 anos é a implementação de áreas marinhas 

protegidas.  

As áreas marinhas protegidas podem apresentar uma grande variedade de desenhos, 

gestão e extensão da proteção, dependendo das características biológicas, físicas e 

sociais do lugar onde são implementadas e os objectivos que pretendem alcançar. No 

entanto, de acordo com a IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) uma 

área marinha protegida é “um espaço geográfico claramente definido, reconhecido, 

dedicado e gerido, através de meios legais ou outros, para alcançar a conservação a 

longo prazo da natureza incluindo os serviços ecossistémicos associados e os valores 

culturais.” De um modo geral, a sua aplicação visa atingir um ou ambos dos seguintes 

objetivos: gestão dos recursos marinhos e conservação da biodiversidade e habitats . 

Na costa da Arrábida, situada na área metropolitana de Lisboa e próxima do estuário 

do Sado, foi estabelecida, em 1998, uma área marinha protegida designada Parque 

Marinho Luiz Saldanha (PMLS). Esta costa é muito procurada por vários sectores 

relacionados com o mar, desde actividades náuticas de lazer a actividades como a 

pesca e a apanha. Constitui uma zona de transição, onde muitas espécies com 

afinidades de água fria e água quente atingem os seus limites norte e sul da 

distribuição, respectivamente. Com mais de 1.200 espécies registadas esta zona é 

considerada um “hotspot” europeu da biodiversidade marinha. Para além disso, o 

estuário do Sado é conhecido como uma importante área de postura e/ou berçário 

para várias espécies de peixes e cefalópodes. Devido ao conflito entre as actividades 

humanas e os valores naturais desta área, o PMLS foi estabelecido com a intenção de 



12 
 

proteger a elevada biodiversidade e alguns dos habitats, bem como promover a 

sustentabilidade da pesca artesanal local. 

O principal objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar os potenciais benefícios do PMLS para três 

das espécies mais importantes para a pesca artesanal local: o sargo Diplodus sargus, o 

linguado senegalês Solea senegalensis e o choco Sepia officinalis. Também se 

investigaram possíveis alterações na abundância e/ou biomassa destas espécies no 

PMLS ao longo do período de duração deste estudo. 

Foi utilizada telemetria acústica passiva para determinar padrões de movimento, o 

tamanho das áreas de actividade e a fidelidade ao local das espécies em estudo. Vinte 

receptores acústicos, que cobriram uma área de aproximadamente 2 km2, detectaram 

a presença de indivíduos previamente marcados com transmissores acústicos (7 

chocos, 20 sargos e 17 linguados). Para identificar possíveis alterações na abundância 

ou biomassa das espécies estudadas foi utilizada a pesca experimental, realizada 2 

vezes por ano nos meses de Primavera e Outono. A pesca experimental foi efectuada 

com recurso à arte do tresmalho, seguindo as especificações utilizadas pela frota 

artesanal local. Foram analisados um total de 106 lances de pesca (de 500m) realizados 

entre 2007 e 2011. 

Uma elevada fidelidade ao local foi observada para o sargo, com todos os indivíduos 

marcados com transmissores acústicos V9 a serem detectados mais de 50% do tempo 

(média de 85%). Embora alguns linguados tenham demonstrado uma elevada 

fidelidade ao local de estudo, a maioria dos indivíduos marcados foi mais transiente. 

Pelo contrário, os chocos não demonstraram fidelidade ao local com apenas um 

exemplar a ser detectado por um período máximo de 39 dias. Os restantes exemplares 

marcados foram detectados menos de 15 dias. Para além disso, nenhum choco voltou 

a ser detectado após ter abandonado a área monitorizada. A recaptura dum choco no 

interior do estuário do Sado, a mais de 15 km do local de marcação evidencia as 

migrações para o estuário.  

As áreas de actividade (95% KUD) variaram entre 0,43 e 1,28 km2 (média de 0,65 km2) 

para os sargos e entre 0,54 e 2,22 km2 (média de 1,19 km2) para os linguados. Os 



13 
 

resultados obtidos para o choco não são relevantes dada a baixa fidelidade da espécie 

ao local.  

Os sargos demonstraram uma clara preferência por fundos rochosos enquanto os 

linguados exibiram uma preferência por fundos arenosos, especialmente os 

constituídos por areia média. 

Os resultados da pesca experimental não revelaram diferenças significativas na 

abundância ou biomassa de linguados ou chocos entre os períodos antes e após a 

implementação do PMLS. 

A combinação destes resultados sugere que a actual área marinha protegida pode 

oferecer proteção adequada para o sargo e potencialmente também para o linguado. 

No entanto, dada a baixa fidelidade ao local e os grandes movimentos do choco, o 

PMLS não oferece uma proteção adequada para esta espécie. 

Os dados de telemetria foram posteriormente utilizados em conjunto com as variáveis 

“habitat”, “profundidade”, “aspecto”, “inclinação”, “curvatura” e “distância a fundo 

rochoso”, de modo a determinar modelos de distribuição para cada uma das espécies 

utilizando o método de máxima entropia (Maxent). Estes modelos de distribuição 

sugerem que grande parte do habitat do PMLS é adequado para chocos, mas apenas 

uma pequena parte do PMLS apresenta habitats adequados para os sargos e os 

linguados. No caso dos linguados, estes habitats estão praticamente restringidos na 

parte voltada a Sul do PMLS. O habitat adequado para os sargos é composto por uma 

estreita franja que contorna os recifes rochosos praticamente ao longo de toda a linha 

de costa do PMLS. 

Posteriormente, utilizou-se o Marxan para testar diferentes soluções para o design do 

PMLS. De acordo com os resultados dos diferentes cenários obtidos com Marxan, o 

desenho do PMLS poderia ser melhorado de modo a oferecer mais proteção a alguns 

dos habitats que, com o presente desenho, apenas estão parcialmente protegidos. No 

entanto, a localização da zona “no-take” está situada no local considerado como 

óptimo.

Marine protected areas 

 

Over the last decades, it has become common knowledge that human impacts can 

cause drastic degradation of marine ecosystems and that these impacts have been 

increasing in magnitude, diversity and rates of change (Jackson et al. 2001, Lotze et al. 

2006, Palumbi et al. 2008). Worldwide, scientists have documented the devastating 

effects of overexploitation (Pauly et al. 2005), habitat loss (Short &amp;amp; Wyllie-Echeverria 

1996, Gray 1997), pollution (Jackson et al. 2001, Shahidul Islam &amp;amp; Tanaka 2004), 

invasive species (Molnar et al. 2008) and the negative consequences of increasing 

coastal development (Bulleri &amp;amp; Chapman 2010) and tourism (Hall 2001). According to 

the FAO’s latest report, around 57% of the worlds fish stocks are fully exploited and 

more than 29% are overexploited (FAO 2012). These factors have raised serious 

concerns and led to calls for the implementation of measures that aim to protect, 

preserve and restore marine ecosystems (Lubchenco et al. 2003).  

One measure that has received much attention and support from the scientific 

community over the last thirty years is the implementation of marine protected areas 

(MPAs) (Roberts &amp;amp; Polunin 1991, Guénette et al. 1998, Pauly et al. 1998, Kaiser 2011). 

Although they are not a new approach to conservation, MPA research and 

implementation have escalated since the 1990’s (Roberts &amp;amp; Polunin 1991, Agardy et al. 

2003, Bogaert et al. 2009, McCay &amp;amp; Jones 2011).  

The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) defines MPAs as “A clearly 

defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or 

other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with 

associated ecosystem services and cultural values”. MPAs present a wide range of 



25 
 

design, management and extent of protection, depending on the biological, physical 

and social characteristics of the place where they are being implemented and the goals 

they are intended to achieve. Most authors suggest their implementation to achieve 

biodiversity and habitat conservation, marine resource management, or both (Roberts 

&amp;amp; Polunin 1993, Agardy et al. 2003, Pauly et al. 2005, Claudet et al. 2008, Russ &amp;amp; Alcala 

2011).  

Biodiversity and habitat conservation includes an array of specific objectives such as 

protecting rare and vulnerable habitats and species, restoring ecological functions, 

encouraging research and education, maintaining aesthetic values and traditional uses 

and promoting sustainable tourism and the area’s nonconsumptive values (Jones 

2001). MPAs focusing on marine resource management have been strongly 

recommended over the last decades as an alternative and/or complement to 

traditional fisheries management methods (Roberts &amp;amp; Polunin 1991, Pauly et al. 1998, 

Murawski et al. 2000, Pauly et al. 2005, Roberts et al. 2005, Kaiser 2011). The 

ecological benefits that MPAs may provide to fisheries include increases in stock 

abundance, age/size composition and spawning stock biomass, the enhancement of 

recruitment in fished areas, the restoration of healthy trophic levels and spillover to 

adjacent areas (Edgar &amp;amp; Barrett 1999, Murawski et al. 2000, Barrett et al. 2007, 

Claudet et al. 2008). In fact, recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of 

MPAs in the management of fisheries in adjacent areas (e.g. Abesamis et al. 2006, 

Stobart et al. 2009, Goñi et al. 2010, Vandeperre et al. 2011) and in the recovery of 

habitats (Leleu et al. 2012). Hence, one of the advantages of MPAs is that, unlike the 

traditional ‘single species’ approach, MPAs offer an ecosystem based approach to 

conservation and fisheries management (Lubchenco et al. 2003, Crowder &amp;amp; Norse 

2008). 

While there is widespread recognition of the potential of MPAs to achieve 

conservation and fisheries management goals, the proper functioning of MPAs is 

frequently impaired by multiple knowledge gaps about key ecological aspects 

underlying the functioning of MPAs, and their potential benefits.   



26 
 

Hence, it is critical to increase our understanding of the dynamics of MPAs and their 

performance as fisheries management tools. In particular, it is important to fully 

understand species movement patterns and habitat use, and the amount of protection 

offered by MPAs. Filling these gaps will allow a better evaluation of the effectiveness 

of MPAs and the forecasting of their optimal designs. 

 

Species movement patterns and habitat use 

MPAs rely on spillover (export of adults/juveniles) and/or recruitment subsidy (export 

of larvae) in order to increase the yield of nearby fisheries (Bohnsack 1993, Sale et al. 

2005). Studies on fish movement patterns have increased in the past decades and, in 

some occasions, successfully demonstrated the spillover effect (Abesamis et al. 2006, 

Goñi et al. 2008, Stobart et al. 2009). Ideally, this information should be taken in 

consideration when defining the location and extent of MPAs and even later during the 

management process. Yet, this information is rarely available before the 

implementation of MPAs and therefore not integrated into the optimal design.  

Together with information on fish movement patterns, knowledge of species habitat 

use is crucial for the design and adaptive management of MPAs, so as to guarantee not 

only the existence of spillover but also that the size of the reserve unit is large enough 

to provide protection during large periods of their life cycle (Glazer &amp;amp; Delgado 2006, 

Grüss et al. 2011). The existence of preferred habitats should also be investigated to 

make sure MPAs provide the adequate habitats for the species involved. 

In most cases there is no empirical information on the size of suitable habitats where 

species are effectively protected from local fisheries, even several years after the 

implementation of MPAs. Acoustic telemetry is one of the most widely used methods 

to track marine species, as it provides long-term, fine scale spatio-temporal data on 

individual movement and home range. However, little has been done yet and there is 

no consensus on how to translate such individual data - the typical output of telemetry 

studies - into the more relevant population scale projection when evaluating the 

effectiveness of protection provided from existing MPAs or forecasting their optimal 



27 
 

designs. Even more striking is the general lack of information about the protection 

offered by MPAs to target species in terms of exposure to nearby fisheries. 

MPA assessment 

The assessment of MPAs has come a long way from the mostly qualitative early studies 

with poorly replicated designs and inappropriate statistical methods. More recently, 

studies carried out with appropriate experimental designs that include replicated 

controls have become common (Claudet &amp;amp; Guidetti 2010). Nevertheless, some authors 

argue that, in most cases, MPA evaluation has been undertaken without the use of 

appropriate sampling designs that enable scientists to unambiguously detect changes 

in species abundance and/or biomass (Fraschetti et al. 2002, Guidetti 2002, Claudet &amp;amp; 

Guidetti 2010).  

Amongst the different statistical approaches, the before-after control-impact (BACI) 

and the beyond BACI designs (Underwood 1991, 1994, Smith 2002) are considered 

some of the best to infer on MPAs effects (Fraschetti et al. 2002, Guidetti 2002). These 

methods and some of their variations, such as after control impact, have been used 

regularly in recent studies on the effects of MPA (e.g. Cole et al. 2011, Moland et al. 

2011, Bertocci et al. 2012, Horta e Costa et al. 2013).  

Regardless of the existence of positive effects after the implementation of an MPA, 

there are some aspects that should be taken in consideration and objectively 

discussed, such as the temporal scale of sampling and the enforcement/compliance 

level of the management rules. The very high natural variability of marine ecosystems 

and the difficulties to fully understand it make it even more difficult to discern 

stochastic effects from those of the protection given by MPAs. Therefore, the temporal 

scale of sampling should, ideally, be large enough to accommodate the natural 

fluctuations in species’ abundance, as several factors beyond fishing mortality may 

have a large effect on species’ reproductive success (Guidetti 2002). The level of 

compliance of the management rules may also have an important role. When there is 

no compliance then no protection effects are to be expected since there is no effective 

change in fishing pressure. As an example, Lipej et al. (2003) suggested that the lack of 



28 
 

differences in fish diversity and abundance between protected and unprotected areas 

in Slovenia is due to the lack of enforcement. 

Acoustic telemetry is one of the most commonly used tools to investigate fish home 

range areas, site fidelity and movement patterns (Abecasis &amp;amp; Erzini 2008, Abecasis et 

al. 2009, March et al. 2010, Mason &amp;amp; Lowe 2010, Afonso et al. 2011, Abecasis et al. 

2013). The use of passive acoustic telemetry, where acoustic receivers are placed in 

the marine environment to detect individuals tagged with acoustic transmitters, allows 

long term studies on animal movements in the wild without influencing their behavior 

(Heupel et al. 2006, Koeck et al. 2013b).  

Species distribution models (SDM) are extremely valuable tools for the implementation 

and management of MPAs (Leathwick et al. 2008, Carvalho et al. 2010). There are 

several approaches to obtain these models including generalized linear or additive 

models (GLMs or GAMs), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), boosted 

regression trees and maximum entropy modeling (Maxent) (Elith &amp;amp; Leathwick 2009, 

Newbold 2009). The low data requirements and the ease of integration with GIS 

analysis together with its superior performance have made Maxent one of the most 

widely used software for SDM (Elith et al. 2006, Elith &amp;amp; Leathwick 2009).  

The use of software that assists in the implementation phase of MPAs, especially in the 

location, size and design process is becoming more frequent (Loos 2006, Green et al. 

2009, Allnutt et al. 2012, Ban et al. 2013). In most cases these tools provide managers 

with options based on a wide variety of input data which can include physical, 

biological and socio-economical information. Among the most used conservation 

planning software is Marxan. It uses simulated annealing to create near optimal 

solutions for reserve systems that achieve determined conservation targets while 

minimizing the cost (e.g. fisheries effort or catch, socio-economic costs) of including 

these areas in no-take areas. Marxan is the most widely used software due to its ability 

to include different types of data and the easy connection with geographic information 

systems (GIS).

Study Area - The Luiz Saldanha Marine Park 

 

The Arrábida coast, located in the metropolitan area of Lisbon and near the Sado 

estuary, is in high demand by various marine-related sectors, from nautical leisure 

activities to fishing and shellfish harvesting. This area is in a transitional biogeographic 

zone where many species of cold and warm-water affinities reach their southern and 

northern limits of distribution, respectively (Gonçalves et al. 2003). With more than 

1200 registered species it is a European hotspot of marine biodiversity (Saldanha 1974, 

Henriques et al. 1999, Gonçalves et al. 2003). Moreover, the nearby Sado estuary is 

known as an important nursery area for several fish and cephalopod species (Serrano 

1992, Cabral et al. 2007, Neves et al. 2009, Vasconcelos et al. 2010, Vinagre et al. 

2010).  

The conflict between human activities and the natural values of this area has led to the 

need to implement regulations. For this reason, the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP) 

was established in 1998, covering approximately 53 km2 and stretching along 38km of 

coastline (Figure 1.1). The LSMP is located in an area of high fishing importance that 

encompasses the fishing port of Sesimbra and is close to the fishing port of Setúbal, 

upstream in the Sado river estuary. The main objectives of this MPA are to protect the 

coastal biodiversity of this particular area and to promote the sustainability of local 

artisanal fisheries and fishers’ livelihoods (Gonçalves et al. 2003).  

The LSMP is divided into three different protection levels (Figure 1.1): no-take areas 

where all human activities are prohibited; partially protected (or buffer) areas where 

only the use of octopus traps, jigging and handlines is allowed; and complementary 

protection areas where the use of all traditional fishing gears is allowed for fishing 

vessels smaller than 7m. In addition, all fishing vessels need a specific permit to 

operate inside the LSMP, spearfishing is prohibited in the entire MPA and recreational 

angling is only allowed within the complementary areas.

While the LSMP was designated in 1998, its final planning design was only achieved in 

2005 (Figure 1.2). The LSMP’s regulations were gradually introduced: in August 2006, 

the partially protected area of Portinho da Arrábida and the eastern half of the no-take 

area were set as a partially protected area; in August 2007 the remaining partially 

protected areas were established and the western half of the no-take area was set as a 

partially protected area; by August 2008 the eastern half of the total protection area 

became a no-take zone; finally in August 2009 the whole total protection area became 

regulated as no-take (Figure 1.2).

Objectives 

 

The main objectives of this study are: a) to evaluate the potential of the recently 

established Luiz Saldanha Marine Park as a management tool for the local populations 

of commercially and ecologically important species b) to determine how this potential 

varies with contrasting life history characteristics 3) to assess the extent by which the 

amount of protection offered by the MPA and the suitability of its current design 

influence the local management of the three selected species. 

We used a combination of passive acoustic telemetry, experimental fishing, species 

distribution models and conservation planning models to achieve these goals and, in 

particular, to answer the following questions: 



32 
 

1 - What is the size of cuttlefish, Senegalese sole and white seabream home range 

areas? 

2 - Do these species present site fidelity to the marine reserve? 

 3 - Do they favour any particular habitat within the study area? 

4 - Is it possible to already detect the effects of the marine reserve implementation on 

the abundance and/or biomass of Senegalese sole or cuttlefish? 

5 - Is the actual design of the LSMP appropriate for the protection/management of the 

three selected species?  

6 – Will changes in the size and location of no-take areas improve the efficiency of the 

LSMP? 

 

Study species 

 

Marine reserves should ensure protection for a wide range of species that have 

different life history traits and different economic and ecological values, and also that 

occupy different trophic levels and environments (Palumbi 2004, Afonso 2007, Claudet 

et al. 2010). For this reason, this study focuses on three species with contrasting life-

history, ecological traits, economic values and resilience: cuttlefish Sepia officinalis 

(Linnaeus, 1758), Senegalese sole, Solea senegalensis Kaup 1858; and white seabream 

Diplodus sargus (Linnaeus, 1758). Given their different characteristics we believe that 

this study is relatively representative in that it allows the perception of MPA benefits 

for a wide range of species. Additionally, despite the large number of studies on MPA 

efficiency, the vast majority of these studies focus on reef fish species whereas very 

few have investigated cephalopods or flatfish (Lester et al. 2009, Horta e Costa et al. 

2013), as in the case.  

 



33 
 

The cuttlefish 

The cuttlefish is a nekto-benthonic cephalopod that occurs over a wide variety of 

bottoms (sand, mud and sea grass beds) between the coastline and approximately 200 

m depth, although it is more abundant in the upper 100m (Guerra 2006). It is found 

from Northern England to the northwestern coast of Africa including the 

Mediterranean (Guerra 2006). It is a semelparous (reproducing only once in a lifetime) 

fast growing species with a lifetime between 1 and 2 years (Le Goff &amp;amp; Daguzan 1991b). 

These characteristics suggest that this species has high resilience to fishing pressure 

(Musick 1999). The first year breeders seem to be more common in the south of their 

geographical distribution, whereas second year breeders constitute the vast majority 

of the population around its northern distribution limit (Guerra &amp;amp; Castro 1988, Gauvrit 

et al. 1997).  

The first tagging experiments with cuttlefish were carried out in the 1980’s by 

Ezzeddine-Najai (1997) and by Le Goff &amp;amp; Daguzan (1991a) using plastic fanion tags. In a 

tag-recapture study carried in the Gulf of Tunis, all recaptured animals migrated 

towards the shallower coastal areas where the main habitats were sand/mud bottoms 

and sea grass beds (Ezzeddine-Najai 1997). During this study, the minimum distance 

travelled by cuttlefish was 4 km in 2 days and the maximum 25 km in 21days 

(Ezzeddine-Najai 1997). The maximum period between tagging and recapture was 89 

days with the cuttlefish covering almost 13.8km (Ezzeddine-Najai 1997). These known 

migrations enable cuttlefish populations to exploit the temporal and spatial variability 

of productive systems and fluctuating populations of prey (Rodhouse &amp;amp; Nigmatullin 

1996). Royer et al. (2006) suggested that coastal zone management alone is not 

sufficient to ensure the sustainable exploitation of cuttlefish due to its high mobility. In 

fact, several authors suggest that MPAs should be used in conjunction with traditional 

management measures such as gear restrictions, seasonal closures, or catch quotas 

especially when species present high mobility (Allison et al. 1998, Shipp 2003, Hilborn 

et al. 2004). 

 

 



34 
 

The Senegalese sole 

The Senegalese sole is a coastal benthonic fish species that occurs in sandy or muddy 

bottoms in depths up to 65m. It is common between the Gulf of Biscay and the coasts 

of Senegal but, according to Desaunay et al. (2006), its distribution is expanding north 

in the NE Atlantic. There are no studies describing the dispersal or movement patterns 

of this species, and the knowledge of its ecology and biology is relatively scarce, with 

most studies focusing on juveniles (e.g. Cabral 2000a, Cabral 2000b, Vinagre et al. 

2006, Vinagre et al. 2008). According to Fishbase (Froese &amp;amp; Pauly 2013) this species 

presents low resilience to fishing pressure. 

The Senegalese sole is one of the most important flatfish resources for fisheries in 

Portugal, yet it has not been properly assessed (Teixeira &amp;amp; Cabral 2009). Nevertheless, 

Teixeira &amp;amp; Cabral (2009) concluded that, even though there are no evaluations of 

flatfish stock status in Portugal, there is probably overexploitation of these fisheries 

resources. In fact, a decreasing trend in the landings per unit effort (LPUE) has been 

observed for the period between 1992 and 2005 (Teixeira &amp;amp; Cabral 2009).  

The sole fishery is one of the most important for the local artisanal fisheries of 

Sesimbra and Setúbal, the two most important fishing ports located near the LSMP 

(Batista et al. 2009). In addition, the nearby Sado estuary is an important nursery area 

for the Senegalese sole (Cabral 2000a, Vasconcelos et al. 2008), as otolith 

microchemistry shows that many of the fish caught in coastal waters originate from 

the Sado nursery (Vasconcelos et al. 2011, Tanner et al. 2013).  

 

The white seabream 

The white seabream is a demersal fish species usually found at depths less than 50 m 

on a variety of sea bottoms, including rocky and sandy bottoms as well as seagrass 

beds. It is one of the most important coastal fish resources in southern European 

countries, where it is mainly targeted by recreational fishermen and small scale 

fisheries (FAO 2012). Its age, growth, reproduction and diet have been widely studied 



35 
 

(e.g. Gordoa &amp;amp; Moli 1997, Morato et al. 2003, Figueiredo et al. 2005, Leitão et al. 2007, 

Mouine et al. 2007, Abecasis et al. 2008). Based on the biological parameters obtained 

by Abecasis et al. (2008) and Morato et al. (2003) this species presents a medium 

resilience to fishing pressure (Musick 1999). In Portugal, where it is a main target 

species for recreational rod and line anglers (Rangel &amp;amp; Erzini 2007, Veiga et al. 2010), 

commercial landings have been declining since the late 1980’s (Directorate General of 

Fisheries and Aquaculture).  

A wide variety of studies have focused on the movements, site fidelity and activity 

patterns throughout the life-history of the white seabream (Abecasis et al. 2009, 

D'Anna et al. 2011, Di Franco et al. 2012, Abecasis et al. 2013, Koeck et al. 2013). These 

studies show that the scale of the dispersion pattern of the white sea bream decreases 

with age: larval dispersion occurs at the scale of 100-200 km; post-settlement 

dispersion takes place over distances under 30 km, although a portion of 22% to 50% 

of settlers remains in the same area (Di Franco et al. 2012); and adult fish present high 

site fidelity with home ranges between 0.65 and 3.93 km2 (Abecasis et al. 2013).  

The movement patterns, site fidelity and habitat use of the white seabream have been 

previously described for juveniles in a coastal lagoon (Abecasis et al. 2009) and for 

adults around artificial and natural reefs (Lino et al. 2009, D'Anna et al. 2011, Abecasis 

et al. 2013, Koeck et al. 2013a). The discrepancy in patterns of activity and habitat use 

of adult white seabream between some of these studies emphasizes the need for local 

studies. Nevertheless this information suggests that, due to their high site fidelity as 

adults and to the dispersal as larvae and post-settlers, white seabream may benefit 

from the implementation of MPAs. In fact, previous studies on the effectiveness of 

MPAs as a fishery management tool suggest that marine reserves may provide long 

term benefits to adjacent local fisheries through the increase of white seabream 

production (Bennett &amp;amp; Attwood 1991, Lloret &amp;amp; Planes 2003, Tuya et al. 2006, Horta e 

Costa et al. 2013). This was also observed for other sparids elsewhere (Bennett &amp;amp; 

Attwood 1991,  Willis et al. 2003)

Thesis structure 

 

This thesis comprises 8 chapters. In the first chapter we present an introduction to the 

main topic and an overview of the study area and selected study species. Chapters 2 

through 4 focus on the home range, site fidelity and habitat use of each study species 

through the use of passive acoustic telemetry. Chapter 5 evaluates the effects of the 

LSMP on the abundance and biomass of Senegalese sole and cuttlefish, by analyzing 

data from experimental fishing trials. In chapter 6 we present distribution models for 

each of the study species estimated through Maxent and determine the size of suitable 

areas that provide full protection as well as their exposure to local fisheries. In chapter 

7 we analyze different protection scenarios using Marxan to identify the best location, 

size and design of no-take areas in the LSMP. Finally, in chapter 8 we synthesize the 

main findings of this study and present general conclusions and suggestions for future 

studies.

Abstract 

 

Knowledge on species site fidelity and movement patterns is key for evaluating the 

potential of marine reserves as fishery management tools. The cuttlefish is one of the 

most important resources for the artisanal fisheries operating in the vicinity of the 

recently established Luiz Saldanha Marine Park. Site fidelity and movement patterns of 

cuttlefish in the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park were investigated using passive acoustic 

telemetry.  

The results show that cuttlefish have no site fidelity to the study area. The maximum 

amount of time a cuttlefish spent inside the monitoring area was 39 days with all other 

individuals remaining less than 15 days. Movements over 15 km towards the nearby 

estuary were observed with the direction of the movement being independent of the 

tide direction. Although not conclusive, the results suggest that cuttlefish are more 

active during the night time. 

The fact that cuttlefish have low site fidelity inside the reserve and large movements 

across and beyond the study area suggest that small coastal marine reserves such as 

the LSMP are not effective in providing long term protection to cuttlefish populations 

and, probably, those of other short-lived, highly mobile cephalopods.

Introduction 

 

Understanding spatial and temporal movement patterns of marine species is key to 

ensure their adequate management. This is especially true in the context of marine 

protected areas (MPAs). As tools for the conservation and management of biodiversity 

and fisheries, MPAs are increasingly seen as a way of overcoming uncertainty in 

fisheries management based on conventional measures (e.g. effort control, size and 

gear restrictions). Yet, MPA design itself has also rested upon substantial uncertainty, 

mainly because information on the species habitat use and connectivity of their 

(sub)populations is generally lacking.  

Several authors recognize the need to incorporate specific information such as activity 

patterns, residency, habitat use and connectivity of (sub)populations into the design 

and planning phases of MPA establishment (e.g. Botsford et al. 2003, Glazer &amp;amp; Delgado 

2006). This is considered essential to ensure an appropriate MPA design that 

maximizes its beneficial mechanism operating inside and outside the protected areas 

(Grüss et al. 2011). However, in most cases, this information is either unavailable or 

not taken into consideration during the design and planning of MPAs. Nevertheless, 

even in contexts where MPAs have already been implemented, this information can be 

extremely useful as a tool for adaptive management (Grafton &amp;amp; Kompas 2005, 

Pomeroy et al. 2005). This study aims to evaluate the site fidelity, activity patterns and 

home range of the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis in the recently established Luiz Saldanha 

Marine Park (LSMP). 

The cuttlefish is one of the main target species of the small-scale fisheries that operate 

in the LSMP and the nearby Sado estuary (Serrano 1992, Batista et al. 2009). Previous 

studies on the distribution of cuttlefish for this region suggest a seasonal migration 

between the two main habitats occupied by the species in the area, as cuttlefish 

abundance is higher within the estuary during spring and summer but increases in 

nearby coastal waters, where the MPA is located, during autumn and winter (Batista et 

al., 2009; Neves et al., 2009). Seasonal migrations of cuttlefish between shallow and 

deeper waters have also been described for other regions (e.g. Wang et al. 2003, 



50 
 

Guerra 2006). These migrations can be due to ontogenic related habitat shifts and/or 

the onset of the spawning season, which only occurs once during the lifetime of the 

cuttlefish.  

Neves et al. (2009) found that, inside the Sado estuary, the cuttlefish’ spawning period 

ranges from February to June, whereas Serrano (1992) found mature individuals in 

coastal areas all year round. Both authors suggested a size-related spawning habitat 

selection, in which smaller individuals would prefer to spawn inside the estuary while 

larger individuals, which are rarely caught inside the estuary, spawn in adjacent coastal 

waters (Neves et al. 2009). It is therefore possible that such larger and more fecund 

cuttlefish may be more site attached, in which case an MPA could provide effective 

protection and have a direct benefit for the reproductive productivity of the local 

population. The information on the spatial and temporal movement patterns of 

cuttlefish that this study aims to unveil will demonstrate the potential of using MPAs 

to effectively protect cuttlefish populations. It will also provide valuable insight as to 

the suitability of the LSMP in protecting local cuttlefish populations.  

 

Materials and Methods 

 

Study area 

This study took place in the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP), which is located in the 

Setúbal Peninsula (Portugal). The LSMP covers an area of approximately 53 km2 and 

stretches over 38 km of coastline (Figure 2.1). It includes a narrow stretch of rocky reef 

bottom down to depths of about 15 m and a larger stretch of soft substrates (sand and 

mud) down to the 100 m bathymetric.  

Three different types of protection zones can be found in the LSMP: no-take, partial 

protection and complementary protection. The no-take zone comprises 4.3 km2 where 

no extractive or recreational activities are allowed. Octopus traps and jigs are allowed 

within the four partial protection zones, which cover a total of 21 km2. Finally, within 

the three complementary protection zones, totalling 28 km2, traditional fishing gears 



51 
 

for vessels smaller than 7m are allowed, along with recreational angling. In addition, all 

fishing vessels need a permit to operate inside the LSMP and spearfishing is prohibited 

in all zones. 

Acoustic telemetry 

Trammel nets, similar to those used by local fishermen, were used to capture 

cuttlefish, during the November 2010 experimental fishing campaign (see Chapter 5 

for more details). Seven cuttlefish were measured and tagged with an acoustic 

transmitter (Vemco, Canada), following an adaptation of the method used by Aitken et 

al. (2005). A small (9mm long and 5mm wide) section of stainless steel tube was 

attached to each end of the acoustic transmitter, using epoxy resin. The transmitters 

were then screwed into the cuttlebone through the stainless steel tubes. After the 

attachment of the transmitter, cuttlefish were released at the site of capture. The 

whole procedure took less than 1 minute. 

Two different transmitter types were used: V7 (7 mm in diameter and 22.5 mm in 

length), with random emission intervals between 30 and 90 seconds and an estimated 

lifetime of 95 days, and V9 (9 mm in diameter and 29 mm in length) with random 

emission intervals between 15 and 45 seconds and an estimated lifetime of 151 days. 

Preliminary tests showed detection ranges of approximately 300 m for V9 transmitters 

and 100 m for V7 transmitters.  

The presence of tagged cuttlefish was monitored through the use of 18 acoustic 

receivers (Vemco VR2 and VR2W) moored in two lined arrays parallel to the coastline 

(Figure 2.1). The inner line comprised nine receivers deployed at depths between 8 

and 14 m, thus monitoring both rocky and sandy habitats. The outer line comprised 

nine receivers deployed at depths between 17 and 21 m, mainly monitoring muddy 

bottoms. The monitoring period lasted from October 27th 2010 to September 15th 

2011, outlasting the duration of the acoustic transmitters by more than twice their 

expected lifetime. Six receivers from the outer line and two receivers from the inner 

line were lost after the data download that took place on November 17 2010, most 

likely due to illegal fishing activities. The loss of these receivers was noticed during the 

following download, which took place in April 2011, and forced a change in the array 



52 
 

design thereafter, with the deployment of four new receivers on May 9th 2011 (Figure 

2.1).

shown in the top right panel. Triangles show the initial location of the 
receivers, squares symbolize receivers that were lost after 17/11/2010 and 
stars the receivers re-deployed on 9/5/2011. The asterisks mark the locations 
where cuttlefish were captured and released. 

 

Data analysis 

A VUE database (Vemco, Canada) was used to manage acoustic detections. Single 

detections occurring in periods of more than 24h were considered spurious and were 

removed from further analysis (Afonso et al. 2009). Acoustic telemetry data was first 

analysed using Eonfusion software (Myriax, Australia) to visualize movement patterns 

of tagged cuttlefish fish inside the monitored area.  

To evaluate site fidelity two indexes were estimated: a residency index (IR; Abecasis &amp;amp; 

Erzini 2008) and a detection efficiency index (ID). IR was estimated by dividing the total 



53 
 

number of days with detections (Dd) by the number of days between first and last 

detections (Di). ID corresponds to the value of Dd divided by the estimated battery life 

(B), that is, the estimated period for which the transmitter would be heard of if it 

stayed within receiver range.  

Activity patterns throughout the day were evaluated by binning detections into 

assigned periods (day or night), according to the sunrise and sunset time obtained 

from the Astronomical Applications Department of U.S. Naval Observatory 

(http://aa.usno.navy.mil). Chi-square analyses were performed for each fish to test if 

there was a period of the day with a number of detections significantly different from 

the expected (Abecasis &amp;amp; Erzini 2008).  

To assess home range areas, minimum convex polygons (MCP) were calculated for 

each cuttlefish based on the location of the receivers. The MCP is the minimum area 

that encompasses all detections, and is an indicator of the dispersion throughout the 

monitored area (Kernohan et al. 2001). In this study, given the limited habitat coverage 

of the array, estimates of MCP were only considered as proxies of the actual home 

range areas. 

Centre of activity (COA) positions were estimated for each cuttlefish for 30 minute 

periods using the method described by Simpfendorfer et al. (2002). This method uses 

presence data from multiple receivers and converts them into position estimates, 

based on the weighed means of the number of detections at each receiver during a 

particular time period. These COA positions were then used to estimate the total 

distance (TD) travelled and the direction of the movements. Mean travelled distance 

per day (MTDD) was obtained by dividing TD by Dd. To determine the influence of the 

tidal currents in the direction of the movements of cuttlefish we compared the 

direction of successive COA positions against the direction of the tidal current during 

that period.

Results 

 

Five of the seven acoustically tagged cuttlefish were successfully detected by the 

receiver array up to 37 days after tagging (Table 2.1). Additionally, one of the 

undetected cuttlefish (# 1) was recaptured by a recreational fisherman 76 days after 

tagging, approximately 15.5 km away from the release location inside the Sado 

estuary. This cuttlefish was in good condition and its transmitter was well attached.

Residency values ranged between 0.33 and 1 (IR median=0.95), yet the detection 

efficiency was substantially lower, suggesting that the tagged cuttlefish spent the 

majority of the transmitter lifetime outside receiver range. Moreover, this also 

suggests that abandonment of the monitored area occurred after a few days of 

detection, which is evidence of low site fidelity (Table 2.2).

MCP areas could only be estimated for three individuals (#2, #6 and #7), as the 

remaining individuals (#4 and #5) were only detected by one receiver. Short-term 

‘home range’ values ranged between 0.26 and 1.26 km2 (Table 2.2). Cuttlefish travelled 

a minimum mean distance of approximately 2 km per day (Table 2.2). Approximately 

half of these movements were contrary to the prevailing tidal current direction (48.6% 

for #2, 50.5% for #6 and 52.1% for #7). The chi-square analysis revealed that two 

analyzed cuttlefish presented a significantly higher number of detections during the 

night, whereas the third cuttlefish showed no significant difference between the 

expected and the observed number of day and night-time detections (Table 2.2). The 

analysis of the total number of detections of all cuttlefish throughout the 24h of the 

day reveals an activity pattern with slightly higher number of detections during the 

night and a relatively lower but more stable number of detections during daytime 

(Figure 2.2).

Discussion 

 

Acoustic tracking of cuttlefish was first applied in the giant cuttlefish Sepia apama by 

Jackson et al. (2005). These authors found that placing the acoustic transmitter above 

the cuttlebone was more efficient than placing it inside the mantle. This study used a 

similar method which proved to be adequate, as the recaptured cuttlefish 

demonstrated. 

Even though the acoustic receiver array spanned a distance of 5.5 km, the average 

number of detection days was very low. Moreover, no cuttlefish was ever re-detected 

after leaving the monitored area. The short term individual home range areas obtained 

in this study ranged between 0.26 and 1.26 km2 and, although they are 3.5 to 16.5

times smaller than the total protection area, these results are based on a small time 

period between 14 and 37 days and with limited coverage by the receivers.  

The loss of several receivers during the experiment does not seem to affect the results 

of this study, seeing that most of the tagged cuttlefish detections had stopped before 

that. The only exception was cuttlefish #6, whose detections still occurred after the 

loss of some of the receivers. 

The recapture of one cuttlefish 76 days after release inside the nearby estuary (15.5 

km away) provides direct evidence of migrations between the coastal areas and the 

estuary, as previously suggested (Batista et al. 2009, Neves et al. 2009). In fact, 

cuttlefish seems to be a very vagile species with no site fidelity, given that all the 

individuals permanently abandoned the monitored area after just a few days. This 

suggests that relatively small MPAs such as the LSMP probably do not provide enough 

protection to this cuttlefish species.  

The direction of cuttlefish movements, which were up to a minimum of 2km per day, 

appears to be independent of the tide direction. As for the activity pattern, a higher 

number of detections during the night have also been reported for Sepia apama 

(Payne et al. 2010) suggesting that enhanced night-time activity may be common 

amongst cuttlefish species. These results show that cuttlefish have low site fidelity 

inside the reserve, and movements substantially larger than the size of the no-take 

area and even the marine Park.  

In order to offer adequate protection, MPAs should include all or, at least, the large 

majority of the individuals’ long term home range (Kramer &amp;amp; Chapman 1999, Kellner et 

al. 2008, Moffitt et al. 2009, Afonso et al. 2011), thus ensuring the protection of these 

individuals from fishing for a considerable amount of their life time. However, 

protecting mobile species throughout their lifetime has proved challenging, with 

several authors acknowledging that, for such species, MPAs do not offer effective 

protection (e.g. Kramer &amp;amp; Chapman 1999, Nowlis &amp;amp; Roberts 1999, Gerber et al. 2003, 

Afonso et al. 2009), especially considering the small size of most coastal MPAs. This 

seems to be the case of cuttlefish, which are known to perform seasonal migrations 

between shallow and deeper waters (Wang et al. 2003, Guerra 2006).  



58 
 

Modest size MPAs, such as the majority of NE Atlantic and Mediterranean MPAs 

(Claudet et al. 2010), are likely to fail in effectively protecting cuttlefish populations 

throughout their life cycle. Yet, given that this species lays eggs in the substrate, there 

is a strong possibility that MPAs may play an important role in protecting the 

reproductive output of cuttlefish populations, as long as they encompass (most of) the 

spawning grounds of cuttlefish.  

We recommend that long term monitoring studies be carried out to better understand 

the effects of the LSMP on cuttlefish populations, along with wider scale studies on the 

spatial ecology and migration. A wider array of acoustic receivers covering deeper 

waters and the nearby Sado estuary could help clarify the migrations of cuttlefish 

across its natural habitats and, in particular, the location of their spawning grounds.

Home range, site fidelity and habitat use of Solea senegalensis 

in the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park 

 

Abstract 

 

Information on the site fidelity and home range areas of adult Senegalese sole, one of 

the most important resources for the artisanal fishery operating in the Portuguese 

coast, is inexistent. We conducted long term (up to 293 days) passive acoustic 

telemetry studies in order to determine the site fidelity and movement patterns of this 

species in a recently established marine protected area (Luiz Saldanha Marine Park, 

Portugal). The results revealed that most Senegalese sole spent a large part of the 

time, between first and last detections (average residency index = 69%), inside a 

relatively small area (average 95% KUD = 1.2 km2; LSMP no-take area = 4.3 km2), 

during which they clearly preferred sandy bottoms, the most common habitat inside 

the MPA. Results also demonstrated that Senegalese sole do regular excursions 

beyond MPA boundaries, eventually disappearing from the MPA. The results of this 

study suggest that small coastal MPAs providing adequate habitat may protect 

individuals of this species, while allowing for moderate levels of adult spillover from 

the MPA to neighbouring areas. 

 

Introduction 

 

Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been widely used as a fishery and biodiversity 

management tool (Russ &amp;amp; Alcala 2011). MPAs where extractive human activities are 

reduced or excluded can provide a refuge for overexploited populations. In the long 



63 
 

term, they can also act as sources of emigrant larvae or post-recruit spillover that will 

replenish adjacent (fished) areas (Russ 2002). By continuously protecting individual fish 

within its boundaries, MPAs are expected to hold larger and older fish, which will reach 

higher reproductive potential and eventually produce offspring with better survival 

rates than those from younger fish, thereby benefiting local populations through 

enhanced recruitment (Birkeland &amp;amp; Dayton 2005).  

Spillover can take place when the movements of individual fish across the boundaries 

of an MPA result in a net emigration of fish to the outside areas, eventually increasing 

fisheries yields. This net spillover seems to be density-dependent, as several empirical 

studies demonstrate that it typically occurs in MPAs that hold higher densities than 

their neighbouring fished areas (e.g. Goñi et al. 2008, La Mesa et al. 2011, Russ &amp;amp; 

Alcala 2011). 

It follows that understanding the habitat use and movement patterns of individual fish 

is central to establishing the appropriate size, shape, location and separation of MPAs, 

so that they effectively promote the reserve effect and spillover. Moreover, this 

knowledge can also provide critical guidelines and input for a posteriori adaptive 

management of MPAs (Gerber et al. 2005, Grafton &amp;amp; Kompas 2005, Pomeroy et al. 

2005), especially when there was little or no relevant ecological data available in the 

first place. 

This study aims to shed light on the spatial-temporal movement patterns of a coastal 

fish species, the Senegalese sole Solea senegalensis Kaup 1858, within the context of a 

recently established MPA, the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP). The Senegalese sole 

is a coastal fish species that inhabits sandy and muddy bottoms at depths down to 

100m. Its geographic distribution comprises the NE Atlantic from the Gulf of Biscay to 

the coasts of Senegal, yet it appears to be expanding north (Desaunay et al. (2006). 

Knowledge of the ecology and biology of the Senegalese sole is relatively scarce, with 

most studies focusing on its juvenile phase (e.g. Cabral 2000a, Cabral 2000b, Vinagre et 

al. 2006, Vinagre et al. 2008). In particular, there are no published studies describing 

the dispersal or movement patterns of this species. 



64 
 

The Senegalese sole is one of the most important species for the artisanal fisheries 

that operate along the Portuguese coast, including those of the Setúbal peninsula, 

where the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP) was recently implemented (Batista et al. 

2009). The LSMP is located next to the Sado estuary, which is thought to be an 

important nursery for many coastal fishes including Senegalese sole (Cabral 2000a, 

Vasconcelos et al. 2008). Indeed, studies using otolith microchemistry showed that 

many Senegalese soles caught in coastal waters originated from the Sado nursery 

(Vasconcelos et al. 2011, Tanner et al. 2013).  

While these evidences suggest spatial migrations between the estuary and adjacent 

coastal areas, these are still poorly understood. This study uses passive acoustic 

telemetry to evaluate the size of individual home range areas, site fidelity and patterns 

of habitat use of adult Senegalese sole, inside the LSMP. This information will shed 

light on the suitability of the LSMP design for protecting local populations of 

Senegalese sole. 

 

Materials and Methods 

 

Study area 

The LSMP, located in the Setúbal Peninsula (Portugal), covers an area of approximately 

53 km2 and stretches over 38 km of coastline (Figure 3.1). It includes a narrow stretch 

of rocky reef habitats down to 15 m deep and a larger stretch of soft substrates (sand 

and mud) habitats down to 100 m. The LSMP is located in an area of high importance 

to commercial fishing activities, as it encompasses the fishing port of Sesimbra and is 

close to the nearby fishing port of Setúbal, located upstream in the Sado river estuary 

(Figure 3.1). 

This MPA was designated in 1998, yet its final planning design was only finalized in 

2005 and full implementation of regulations was only accomplished in 2009. The LSMP 

design includes one no-take zone of 4.3 km2 where all extractive activities are 

forbidden, four partial protection zones totalling 21 km2 where only commercial fishing 



65 
 

using octopus traps and jigs is allowed), and three complementary protection zones 

totalling 28 km2 where recreational angling and commercial fishing boats less than 7m 

long are allowed to operate using traditional fishing gear (Figure 3.1a). Additional 

regulations include the ban on spearfishing in the entire LSMP area and a tight control 

over fishing access, as all commercial fishing vessels require a permit to operate within 

the LSMP limits.

The red area corresponds to the no-take area, the orange area represents the 
partial protection area and the green area shows the complementary 
protection area. 

 

Tagging and monitoring 

Seventeen Senegalese sole over 30cm TL were captured, measured and tagged during 

the experimental trammel net fishing campaign of October 2010 (see Chapter 5 for 



66 
 

more details). Eleven were captured in the no-take area with the remaining six 

captured in the partially protected area located east of the no-take area (Figure 3.1b). 

According to Teixeira &amp;amp; Cabral (2010) all tagged fish should correspond to mature 

individuals between 3 and 8 years old. 

Acoustic transmitters (Vemco V9-2L) were externally attached on the eyed side 

underneath the dorsal fin (median region). The acoustic transmitters were previously 

glued, together with two nylon sutures 1 cm apart, to a smooth rubber plate. The 

sutures were then passed through the muscle underneath the pterigiophores of the 

dorsal fin and another rubber plate was placed on the opposite side (blind side) where 

threads were knotted (Figure 3.2). This tagging procedure was similar to that used by 

Bégout Anras et al. (2003) for Solea solea. After the attachment of the acoustic 

transmitter, fish were released at the site of capture.

Eighteen acoustic receivers (Vemco VR2 and VR2W) monitored the presence of tagged 

Senegalese sole. These receivers were moored in an array that comprised two lines of 

receivers parallel to the coastline that covered the no-take area and one neighbouring 

partial protection zone (Figure 3.1b). These lines, which had nine receivers each, were 

deployed so as to cover depths from 8 and 14 m (inner line), and 17 to 21 m (outer 

line). The monitoring period lasted from October 2010 until January 2012, outlasting 

the expected lifetime of the acoustic tags (282 days). Six receivers from the outer line 



67 
 

and two receivers from the inner line were lost following the first data download that 

took place on November 17 2010, most probably due to illegal fishing activity. The loss 

of these receivers was noticed during the second data download that was carried out 

in April 2011, leading to the deployment of four new receivers in slightly different 

locations in May 2011 (Figure 3.1b). Tag performance tests were carried out before the 

release of tagged animals. These tests showed detection ranges of approximately 300 

m and no significant differences between the number of observed and expected 

detections during day and night (?2= 1.47 p=0.22). 

 

Data analysis 

We used a VUE database (Vemco, Canada) to manage acoustic detections. Single 

detections occurring in periods of more than 24h were considered spurious and were 

removed from further analysis (Afonso et al. 2009). Acoustic telemetry data was first 

analysed using Eonfusion software (Myriax, Australia) to visualize movement patterns 

of tagged Senegalese soles inside the monitored area.  

Home range areas were estimated using two different methods: minimum convex 

polygons (MCP) and kernel utilization distributions (KUD). MCPs were estimated as the 

minimum area that encompassed all detections and represent a measure of dispersion 

over the monitored area used by an animal (Kernohan et al. 2001). The KUDs were 

estimated based on centre of activity positions (COA). These COA were estimated for 

each fish for 30 minute periods using the method described by Simpfendorfer et al. 

(2002). This method uses presence data from multiple receivers and converts them 

into position estimates based on weighed means of the number of detections at each 

receiver during a particular time period. A 50% KUD area was used as measure of the 

individual’s core activity area, and a 95% KUD area as the individual’s home range area 

(Afonso et al. 2008). Both MCPs and KUDs were estimated using Hawth’s Analysis 

Tools extension for ArcGIS (Beyer 2004). A smoothing factor of 250 and 25m grid cells 

were used for KUD estimation. Correlations between fish total length and home ranges 

areas (MCP, 50% KUD and 95% KUD) were assessed using the Pearson correlation 

coefficient (Pearson’s r). 



68 
 

To measure site fidelity, two indices were estimated for each individual: a residence 

index (IR), corresponding to the total number of days a fish was detected (Dd) divided 

by the number of days between the date of release and the last detection (Di) (Afonso 

et al.  2008), and a weighted residence index (IWR) (Lino 2012), which accounts for the 

number of days the fish was detected (Dd) as a proportion of the total number of 

monitoring days (Dt), and is weighted by the interval in days between first and last 

detection (Di) as a proportion of the total number of monitoring days (Dt),

This index was used to account for the long monitoring periods when compared with 

the expected tag lifetime. Therefore, the total number of monitoring days (Dt) was 

replaced by the tag expected lifetime. Both indices vary between 0 (no residency) and 

1 (full time resident).  

Whenever there were more than 22 days with detections and more than 2500 

detections in total Fast Fourier Transformations (FFT) were applied to the hourly 

number of fish detections in all receivers to detect diel activity patterns (Abecasis et al. 

2013). The FFT decomposes a sequence of values into components of different 

frequencies. The frequencies of dominant cyclical patterns are then identifiable as 

peaks within a frequency power spectrum (Chatfield 2004). Activity patterns 

throughout the day were evaluated by binning detections into assigned periods (day or 

night), according to the time of sunrise and sunset time as identified by the 

Astronomical Applications Department of U.S. Naval Observatory 

(http://aa.usno.navy.mil). A chi-square analysis was performed for each fish to test if 

there is a period of the day with a number of detections significantly different from the 

expected (Abecasis &amp;amp; Erzini 2008).  

To test for habitat selection, each COA was assigned as pertaining to one of the five 

available habitat types (fine sand, medium sand, coarse sand, rock and nearshore 



69 
 

reefs). We then used chi-squares tests to assess if fish used habitats differently than 

expected based on habitat availability (Rogers &amp;amp; White 2007). First, we calculated the S 

statistic 

? = ?  
?

?=1

?
???? ? ???+??

???+?

where pi is the proportion of available habitat i and uij, for 1?j?J and 1?i?I, the number 

of detections for animal j in habitat i. Under the hypothesis of random habitat use by 

all animals this test follows the chi-square distribution with J(I-1) degrees of freedom. 

Additionally, the hypothesis of equal habitat selection for all individuals was tested by 

a chi-square test on the contingency table containing the uij values, such as 

?? = ?  
?

?=1

?
???? ? ??+?+??

The result was compared with a chi-square distribution with (I-1) (J-1) degrees of 

freedom. Moreover, we estimated selection ratios (?ij=
???

?+???
) to measure individual 

habitat selection (Rogers &amp;amp; White 2007). The selection ratio (?) is a measure that 

refers to the selection of the relocations within the study area (Manly et al. 2002). 

Values above 1 indicate preference, values below 1 indicate avoidance. An 

eigenanalysis of selection ratios was performed to understand the individual 

heterogeneity of habitat selection (Calenge &amp;amp; Dufour 2006). All habitat selection 

analyses were performed using the adehabitatHS package for R (Calenge 2006). 

 

Results 

 

The number of days in which individual tagged  Senegalese sole were detected ranged 

from 5 to 213 days, corresponding to total periods of detection ranging from 5 to 293 

days (Figure 3.3), and to a total number of detections per fish that range from 282 to 

168133 (Table 3.1).

Figure 3.3. Calendar plot of daily detections of Senegalese sole tagged with 
acoustic transmitters. 

 

About 70% of tagged Senegalese sole presented a IR above 0.5, which suggests that 

these fish spent more than half of the detection period within the monitored area 

(Table 3.1). Conversely, only 2 (&lt;12%) tagged fish had IWR values above 0.5, indicating 

that very few individuals were detected for over half the days of expected tag lifetime 

(Table 3.1). Such low IWR also suggests that various fish had long detection periods but 

only some days with detections in between. It is also noteworthy that, 52% of 

individuals were no longer detected after just a few days of consecutive detections 

(Figure 3.3). A significant correlation was found between fish total length and IR (r=-

0.501, p=0.04), indicating that larger fish spent less time in the monitored area.

Overall, a higher number of detections was found during daytime (Figure 3.4). This 

pattern of detections was seen in all Senegalese soles, except for individuals #6 and 

#15, for which there were no significant differences between day and night-time 

detections (Table 3.2). Eight Senegalese soles presented enough detections to run the 

FFT analysis. Of these individuals, four presented a cyclical pattern of activity with a 

strong 24h peak (Table 3.2), whereas no distinct peaks were identified for the 

remaining four.

Home range areas spanned between 0.09 and 1.55 km2 for MCP; between 0.14 and 

0.55 km2 for 50% KUD and between 0.54 and 2.22 km2 for 95% KUD (Table 3.1). Home 

range (95% KUD) and core activity (50% KUD) areas were stable throughout the study 

period for nine fish whose detections spanned for over 30 days (Figure 3.5 and Figure 

3.6). No significant correlations were observed between fish length and MCP (r=0.124, 

p&gt;0.05), 50% KUD (r=0.273, p&gt;0.05) or 95% KUD (r=0.223, p&gt;0.05).

The chi-square test for habitat selection was highly significant (S=43810.78, df=68, 

P&lt;0.001). Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected, implying that fish were not 

distributed proportionately to the habitat type available. Furthermore, this habitat 

selection pattern was not identical for all individuals (Sc= 29287.92, df=64, p&lt;0.001; 

Figure 3.7). The eigenanalysis of selection ratios produced two factors that mostly 

explained the S statistic (98.3%). The nearshore reefs and rock habitats were hardly 

ever used by any fish, while medium sand habitat was favoured by nearly all fish 

(Figure 3.7). The habitat selection ratios (?) confirm these results by demonstrating a 

general, slight preference for medium sand habitats, with all individuals avoiding the 

rock and nearshore reefs (Table 3.3).

Discussion 

 

The FFT analysis revealed the strong diel activity pattern of the Senegalese sole, a 

common characteristic of most marine species that can be related with endogenous 

rhythms, abiotic factors such as daylight intensity, height of tides, moon phase and 

temperature, or even biotic factors such as predator and prey abundance (Cole 1957, 

Andrews et al. 2009). In contrast, the closest flatfish species present in the study area – 

the common sole Solea solea (Cabral et al. 2007), has been shown to be more active 

during night-time. This different behavior may assure that interspecific competition is 

avoided or might be related with fish size, since the common sole individuals tagged in 

previous studies were smaller than the Senegalese sole individuals tagged in this study. 

The lower number of night-time detections may be caused by fish burrowing in the 

sand. This would reduce the transmitters’ range, in a similar way to what was observed 

in other studies (Abecasis et al. 2013).  

Our results seem to indicate that some individuals exhibit high site fidelity while the 

majority is more transient. The low IR values for individuals whose detection period 

spanned over 100 days suggest that movements out of the monitored area occur on a 

frequent basis and sometimes for prolonged periods. As these periods occurred in-

between detections, these individuals abandoned the monitored area and later 

returned to it. In contrast, individuals that were detected for fewer days spent the 

majority of the time inside the monitored area. Thus, low IWR values can be divided in 

two main groups: 1) fish that were detected over short periods of time and never 

detected again (e.g. # 4, # 10 and # 15) and 2) fish with a long period of time between 

first and last detections but only some days with detections in between (e.g. # 2, # 3 

and # 13).  

The first group is most likely composed of fish that performed movements leading to 

spillover (permanent relocation of home range area outside the MPA) to adjacent 

areas where they can eventually be captured. This was confirmedly what happened to 

fish # 11. Another possibility is that (some) fish suffered post release mortality. 

However, two tagged soles (#11 and #13) were recaptured almost one year after 



79 
 

tagging in apparent good condition, suggesting that post release mortality is low. 

Except for some scale loss around the point of contact these fish were in good 

condition showing no sign of infection and the acoustic transmitters were still properly 

attached. 

The second group is composed of fish that moved outside the monitored area but 

ultimately came back, an event described as leakage, where temporary movements 

beyond the MPA boundaries are part of the home range movements (Pérez-Ruzafa et 

al. 2008). Although the monitored array only covered part of the LSMP the fact that 2 

individuals were captured outside this MPA strengthens this hypothesis. Another 

possibility is that the monitored area represents only a part of a larger home range 

that is seasonally visited. However, if this is the case there seems to be no common 

temporal trend among fish in such movements. 

Overall, our results indicate that larger fish have less site fidelity to the monitored area 

and, therefore, should use areas outside the detection range more often. Larger fish 

may move over larger areas due to a combination of enhanced exploring capabilities 

and a size-related increase of energetic needs demanding more captured prey. Rogers 

(1994) has shown that the geographic range of the common sole (Solea solea) 

increases with its abundance so that individuals may search for new feeding grounds, a 

behavioural response known as density dependent movements (Kellner et al. 2008). 

Another hypothesis could be the existence of a social/sex component similar to what 

has been reported for other flatfish species that exhibit complex haremic territorial 

systems. In several Bothidae species adult males defend territories that include several 

smaller female territories (Konstantinou &amp;amp; Shen 1995, Carvalho et al. 2003). 

The preference of adult Senegalese sole for medium sandy habitats found in our study 

contrasts with the preference of juveniles for mud sediments as reported for the 

nearby Sado estuary (Cabral 2000a). This change in habitat preferences is somewhat 

expected given the ontogenic shifts and the change in prey preference with age 

(Garcia-Franquesa et al. 1996, Cabral 2000b).  

 



80 
 

Conclusions 

According to our results, the ‘impact’ area of the LSMP (no-take and partial protection 

areas) is large enough to provide protection to individual Senegalese sole, as it 

represents approximately eleven times the largest individual long-term home range. 

Moreover, a large part of the no-take and partial protection areas holds the preferred 

habitat of adult Senegalese sole. In addition, spillover and leakage events, which are 

one of the supposed benefits of MPAs to local fisheries, seem common (Pérez-Ruzafa 

et al. 2008, Russ &amp;amp; Alcala 2011). On the other hand, the size of the ‘impact’ area may 

not be enough to offer protection to more than a few individuals due to density-

dependent movements or if this species presents a social system similar to that 

present in several Bothidae species. Therefore, future studies focusing on the social 

and reproductive behaviour of this species are needed in order to better clarify our 

findings.

Home range, site fidelity and activity patterns of Diplodus 

sargus in the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park 

 

Abstract 

 

Passive acoustic telemetry was used to analyze the activity patterns and site fidelity of 

white seabream (n=20), inside a marine protected area (Luiz Saldanha Marine Park, 

Portugal). The number of days between first and last detections ranged between 2 and 

293 with most individuals presenting high site fidelity. The results show a cyclical 24 

hour pattern of activity with most individuals being more active during the day with an 

increase in the number of detections after sunrise and a decrease just before sunset. A 

positive correlation was found between fish total length and the maximum range. 

However, the maximum range observed was 5 km and the average was 2.36 km 

indicating that even large fish occupy relatively small areas. The results of this study 

suggest that white seabream might benefit from the implementation of small coastal 

MPAs such as the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park. 

 

Introduction 

 

Understanding the activity patterns and residency of marine species is a fundamental 

aspect towards their proper management. With the onset of marine protected areas 

(MPAs) as a tool for conservation and management of biodiversity and fisheries this 

information has become even more necessary. Several authors acknowledge that 

information on species movements, site fidelity and habitat use should be taken in 

consideration during the design phase of MPAs (e.g. Botsford et al. 2003, Glazer &amp;amp; 



87 
 

Delgado 2006). However, in most cases, this information is either unavailable or not 

taken in consideration during the design of MPAs. This information is extremely useful 

even after the implementation of MPAs as a tool for adaptive management (Grafton &amp;amp; 

Kompas 2005, Pomeroy et al. 2005).  

During the recent implementation of the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP), a small 

coastal MPA with different protection levels, located in the vicinity of two large fishing 

harbours (Setúbal and Sesimbra), no information on the activity patterns and residency 

of some of the most important species for the local small scale artisanal fisheries was 

available. The main goals of this MPA are to protect the local high biodiversity and also 

to promote the sustainability of local artisanal fisheries. 

The white seabream, Diplodus sargus (Linnaeus, 1758), is one of the most important 

coastal fish resources in southern European countries and one of the main target 

species for recreational anglers (Veiga et al. 2010). According to Horta e Costa et al. 

(2013) the white seabream is one of the most landed reef fish species in the port of 

Sesimbra while also attaining one of the highest values per kg.  

The movement and activity patterns, habitat use and site fidelity have been widely 

studied in adults and juveniles of white seabream using tag-recapture and acoustic 

transmitters (Abecasis et al. 2009, Lino et al. 2009, D'Anna et al. 2011, Abecasis et al. 

2013, Koeck et al. 2013a). With the exception of juveniles that migrate from an 

estuarine environment to coastal areas (Abecasis et al. 2009) white seabream 

demonstrate high site fidelity (D'Anna et al. 2011, Abecasis et al. 2013). The size of the 

average home range areas of adult white seabream ranged between 0.11 km2 in the 

Mediterranean and 1.88 km2 in the South of Portugal (D'Anna et al. 2011, Abecasis et 

al. 2013). Different activity patterns have also been reported for this species. The study 

by D’Anna et al. (2011) revealed that white seabream were more active during the 

night while the study by Abecasis et al. (2013) showed that white seabream were more 

active during the day. The observed diversity in activity patterns and on the size of 

home range areas enforces the need for local studies particularly in MPAs (Abecasis et 

al. 2012).  



88 
 

The objectives of this study were to determine the site fidelity, activity patterns and 

home range areas for white seabream in the LSMP. This information is then used to 

discuss the usefulness of the LSMP towards the management of the local white 

seabream population. 

 

Materials and methods 

 

Study area 

This study took place in the LSMP, a 53 km2 marine reserve that stretches over 38 km 

of coastline. With only a narrow rocky reef from the coastline down to 15m deep the 

vast majority of its bottom is composed of soft substrates (Figure 4.1). This MPA 

comprises 3 different protection levels: one no-take zone of approximately 4.2 km2 

where all human activities except research and monitoring are banned; four partially 

protected areas where only octopus traps and jigs are allowed at more than 200m 

from the shoreline and three complementary protection areas where traditional 

fishing gears are allowed for vessels smaller than 7m. Recreational angling is only 

permitted in complementary areas and spearfishing is prohibited in the entire LSMP. 

The monitored area consisted of approximately 4.8 km of coastline covered by an 

array of 11 eleven acoustic receivers (VR2 and VR2W, Vemco) placed in a line parallel 

to the coast (Figure 4.1). 

Tagging and monitoring 

Fish were captured using hook and line baited with shrimp. Twenty white seabream 

were fitted with an acoustic transmitter. All transmitters had an emission rate 

between 30-90 seconds with exception of 4 transmitters which had a 15-45 seconds 

interval. Two different transmitter sizes were used, V7 and V9 (Vemco) with an 

expected lifetime of 95 and 282 days respectively. The transmitters with the higher 

rate of emission (V9; 15-45s) had an expected lifetime of 151 days. Acoustic 

transmitters were introduced in the coelomic cavity through a 1cm incision made in 

the ventral line between the insertion of the pectoral fins and the anus following the 



89 
 

procedures described in Abecasis &amp;amp; Erzini (2008). After introducing the transmitter, 

the incision was closed using cyanoacrilate tissue adhesive (Vetseal, BBraun). 

Preliminary tests showed detection ranges of approximately 300 m for V9 transmitters 

and 100 m for V7 transmitters. Fish were released in the same location where they 

were captured as soon as they recovered from surgery (approximately 15 minutes). 

Tagged fish ranged between 20 and 37 cm in total length (TL) which correspond to fish 

between 3 and 13 years old (Abecasis et al. 2008).

Monitoring of tagged fish was made through an array of 11 acoustic receivers located 

parallel to the coastline around 10m deep. Although the monitoring period lasted from 

1 May 2011 until 2 July 2013, receiver H was nonoperational from 24 December 2012. 

On average, the receivers were cleaned from incrusting algae and fauna, and data was 

downloaded every 3 months.

Data analysis 

Detections of tagged white seabream were managed using the VUE database (Vemco). 

The site fidelity was analysed by using two different indices, the residency index (IR) 

proposed by Afonso et al. (2008) and the weighted residency index (IWR) proposed by 

Lino (2012). The IR was estimated by dividing the total number of days a fish was 

detected by the number of days between the date of release and the last detection. 

This index was estimated for each receiver and for the entire array. The IWR takes in 

consideration the duration of the transmitter expected lifetime (or study duration) and 

follows the formula 

t

D
D

I ×=
 

where Dd is the total number of days a fish was detected, Di is the number of days 

between first and last detections and Dt is the expected duration of the acoustic 

transmitter or study duration whatever is shorter. Both these indices vary between 0 

(no residency) and 1 (full time resident).  

Home range areas were calculated using the kernel utilization distribution (KUD). The 

KUD is a two dimensional probabilistic function that estimates the area of probability 

of finding a fish (Worton 1989). The KUDs were estimated based on centre of activity 

positions (COA). These COA were estimated for each fish for 30 minute periods using 

the method described by Simpfendorfer et al. (2002). This method uses presence data 

from multiple receivers and converts them to position estimates based on weighed 

means of the number of detections at each receiver during a particular time period. A 

50% KUD was used as the core activity area and a 95% KUD as the home range area 

(Abecasis et al. 2013). We used 25 x 25 m cell grids and a smoothing factor (h) of 250 

to estimate KUD with Hawth’s analysis tools for ArcGIS. Because acoustic receivers 

were displayed parallel to the coastline the maximum range length between the 

acoustic receivers where fish were detected was also estimated in order to better 

understand the dispersion along the coast. The Pearson correlation coefficient was 

used to examine the relationship between fish total length and 50% and 95% KUD, IR 

and IWR. 



91 
 

To investigate possible diel patterns, detections were separated by day/night time for 

each individual fish. Sunrise and sunset times obtained from the United States Naval 

Observatory (http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/RS_OneYear.php) were used to 

determine the boundaries of the diel intervals. A chi-square test was then used to test 

for differences in the number of detections between day and night time (Abecasis &amp;amp; 

Erzini 2008). 

Fast Fourier Transformations (FFT) was applied to the hourly number of detections of 

each fish to examine diel detection patterns. Only individuals that were detected more 

than 22 days and had more than 2500 detections in total were analyzed. The FFT 

decomposes a sequence of values into components of different frequencies. The 

frequencies of dominant cyclical patterns are then identifiable as peaks within a 

frequency power spectrum (Chatfield 2004). 

 

Results 

 

The detection period of tagged white seabream, between first and last detection, 

ranged between 2 and 293 days with most fish being detected close to or even more 

than the expected lifetime of the transmitter (Figure 4.2). The high values of the IR and 

IWR observed for most individuals indicate that white seabream have strong site fidelity 

to the monitored area (Table 4.1). The fact that for most fish the highest IR is observed 

for the receiver closest to the tagging location reinforces the high site fidelity (Table 

4.2). The dispersion along the coast was also short with most fish covering a stretch of 

coastline around 2 km long. Only two fish (# 5 and 8) were detected in ten or more 

receivers which correspond to a stretch of coastline around 5 km. The 95% KUD ranged 

between 0.43 and 1.56 km2 (0.77 km2 average) whereas the 50% KUD ranged between 

0.13 and 0.41 km2 (0.18 km2 average) (Table 4.1). The number of detections was 

significantly higher during the day for all fish with exception of fish #16 and 19 which 

were detected more frequently during the night-time (Table 4.1). The FFT analysis 

revealed a 24h activity pattern for all analyzed fish except #15 that showed no pattern. 



92 
 

Additionally, fish #5, 7, 12, 13, 16 and 18 presented additional activity peaks at 48h 

and fish #8 and 18 also at 72h.  

The Pearson correlation revealed a positive correlation between TL and maximum 

range (Pearson’s r = 0.48, p=0.044) and between fish TL and IWR (Pearson’s r = 0.45, 

p=0.048). No significant correlations were found between TL and 50% KUD, 95% KUD 

or IR.  

 

Discussion 

 

Although several studies have already been published on the movement patterns, 

home range and site fidelity of white seabream (Abecasis et al. 2009, D'Anna et al. 

2011, Abecasis et al. 2013) the differences observed between them support the need 

for local studies. Knowledge of local populations’ habits and needs are especially 

relevant for the establishment of marine reserves and their adaptive management 

(Grafton &amp;amp; Kompas 2005, Kaiser 2011). Therefore, the results of this study provide not 

only information on the species movements but are also particularly useful for the 

adaptive management of the LSMP.

The tagging method used in this study had been previously used in other seabream 

acoustic telemetry studies with good results (Abecasis &amp;amp; Erzini 2008, Abecasis et al. 

2009, 2012, Abecasis et al. 2013). Moreover, a recent study by Koeck et al. (2013b) 

revealed that the implantation of an acoustic transmitter in the abdominal cavity of 

white seabream does not influence their survival or behaviour.  

The observed 24h diel pattern of activity with significantly more detections during the 

day is in accordance with the observations in the South of Portugal (Abecasis et al. 

2013) and with the results of white seabream inhabiting natural reefs (Koeck et al. 

2013a). These results are consistent with the findings of Figueiredo et al. (2005) that 

show a higher feeding activity during the day. On the contrary, it contrasts with the 

results of white seabream inhabiting artificial reefs where this species was found more 

active during the night (D’Anna et al. 2011, Koeck et al. 2013a). These contrasting 

results suggest that white seabream can easily adapt their diel behaviour pattern 

according to the habitat and its specifications. 

The average size of the home range areas found in this study is less than half of the 

average size found by Abecasis et al. (2013). This could be due to habitat differences 

since the study of Abecasis et al. (2013) took place in a set of artificial and natural reefs 

surrounded by sandy bottoms whereas this study took place in a stretch of rocky 

coastline that extends for over 20 km providing adequate food resources and plenty of 

refuges. Moreover, this study took place in a marine reserve whereas in the study area 

of Abecasis et al. (2013) took place in an area were both recreational and commercial 

fishing are allowed. A recent study on the sparid Pagrus auratus (Parsons et al. 2010) 

has shown differences on home range size between individuals from the marine 

reserve and individuals from outside the reserve. Parsons et al. (2010) suggest that 

individuals with small home ranges centered within the reserve will not often cross the 

reserve boundaries and therefore will be less likely to be captured by fishing. This 

would lead to a different selection pressure favouring individuals with smaller home 

range areas. Given the low age of the LSMP it is unlikely that this effect is already 

taking place however, future studies should investigate this possibility. 



99 
 

When compared with the home range areas observed by D’Anna et al. (2011) our 

values were considerably higher. However, the monitoring period of our study was 

much longer (maximum of 48 vs 293 days of monitoring) and our fish were also bigger.  

The fact that no significant correlations were found between fish TL and 95% or 50% 

KUD might indicate that adult white seabream do not use larger areas as they grow. 

Yet, larger individuals appear to roam over larger stretches of coastline as indicated by 

the positive correlation found between fish TL and the maximum range length. 

Given that white seabream show high site fidelity and home range areas which are 

about 5.5 times smaller than the no-take area, it is feasible that the LSMP can have an 

important role in this species’ local management. The results of the experimental 

fishing trials (Cunha et al. 2011) and of this study suggest that white seabream 

movements do not extend far away from rocky bottoms. In fact, the previous study by 

Abecasis et al. (2013) has also shown the white seabream preference for rocky 

bottoms even though movements to sandy bottoms were also observed. The exclusion 

of fishing nets in first 200m from the coastline in the partially protected areas confers 

additional protection areas for white seabream given the narrow width of the rocky 

reefs. Consequently, the total amount of coastline where white seabream is protected 

from fishermen is around 20km which is 8.5 times the average maximum range length 

observed for white seabream.  

The results of this study support the observations of Horta e Costa et al. (2013) which 

suggest that white seabream might already be benefiting from the implementation of 

the LSMP.

Evaluation of the effects of the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park on 

the local abundance of Sepia officinalis and Solea senegalensis 

using experimental fishing 

 

Abstract 

 

With fisheries management moving towards an ecosystem based approach marine 

protected areas (MPAs) have become a critical tool. Monitoring of MPAs is crucial to 

understand their effectiveness but also to their adaptive management. Experimental 

fishing surveys were carried in order to test the effect of the implementation of the 

Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP) on the abundance and biomass of Senegalese sole 

and cuttlefish. A total of 106 fishing sets were carried between 2007 and 2011, using 

500 m of trammel nets. The results of the beyond BACI analysis failed to detect any 

significant difference in either abundance or biomass of both species, between 

protected and unprotected areas before and after the implementation of LSMP. The 

possible causes for the lack of a significant effect are discussed. 

 

Introduction 

 

Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been widely implemented as a tool to protect 

biodiversity and/or manage fisheries (Roberts et al. 2005, Botsford et al. 2009). In most 

cases, especially those concerning fisheries management, MPAs are still seen mostly as 

a precautionary measure against local fishery collapse, since empirical evidence about 

their success is still scarce (Clark 1996, Botsford et al. 1997, Charton &amp;amp; Ruzafa 1999, 

Goñi et al. 2010, Vandeperre et al. 2011).  



105 
 

MPAs are seen as a way of overcoming uncertainty in fisheries management based on 

conventional measures (e.g. effort control, size and gear restrictions). Yet, the design 

of MPAs itself has also rested upon substantial uncertainty, mainly because 

information on the species habitat use and connectivity of their (sub)populations is 

generally lacking. This knowledge is crucial to an appropriate MPA design if one is to 

maximize the benefits inside and outside the protected areas (Grüss et al. 2011). Areas 

where extractive human activities are reduced or banned can provide a refuge for 

overexploited populations. In the long term, they can also act as sources of emigrant 

larvae or post-recruit spillover that will replenish adjacent (fished) areas (Russ 2002). 

By continuously protecting individual fish within its boundaries, MPAs should hold 

larger and older fish, which will reach higher reproductive potential and eventually 

produce offspring with better survival rates than those from younger fish, thereby 

benefiting local populations through enhanced recruitment (Birkeland &amp;amp; Dayton 2005). 

Spillover can take place when the movements of individual fish across the boundaries 

of an MPA result in a net emigration of fish to the outside areas, eventually increasing 

fisheries yields. Because those MPAs will typically hold higher densities than 

neighbouring fished areas, density dependence should promote this net spillover. This 

was recently demonstrated in several empirical studies (e.g. Goñi et al. 2008, La Mesa 

et al. 2011, Russ &amp;amp; Alcala 2011). 

The Arrábida coastal environment (Portugal) harbours over 1200 registered marine 

species and is considered a hotspot of marine biodiversity in the northeastern Atlantic 

(Gonçalves et al. 2003, Cunha et al. 2011). In 1998 an MPA - the Luiz Saldanha Marine 

Park (LSMP) - was designated to protect this biodiversity and also to promote the 

sustainability of local artisanal fisheries and fishers’ livelihoods. 

The cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis (Linnaeus, 1758), and the Senegalese sole, Solea 

senegalensis Kaup 1858, are the main targets of the artisanal fisheries based off the 

ports of Setúbal and Sesimbra, located near the LSMP (Serrano 1992, Batista et al. 

2009). Despite the variability in catches observed along the year, with higher catches 

of cuttlefish and the lowest for Senegalese sole during the autumn and winter months, 

these two species represent the highest revenues (Batista et al. 2009).  



106 
 

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the LSMP on the abundance 

and biomass of the local populations of cuttlefish and Senegalese sole. 

 

Materials and methods 

 

Study area 

The LSMP is located in the Setúbal Peninsula (Portugal) covering an area of 

approximately 53 km2 and stretching over 38 km of coastline (Figure 5.1). It includes a 

narrow rocky reef down to 15 m deep and wider soft substrates (sand and mud) down 

to 100 m. This MPA includes one no-take zone of 4.3 km2, four partial protection zones 

(only octopus traps and jigs allowed) totalling 21 km2 and three complementary 

protection zones (traditional fishing gears allowed for vessels smaller than 7m) 

totalling 28 km2. Although designated in 1998, the final planning design of this MPA 

was achieved in 2005, with full implementation of the management measures only in 

2009. The use of fishing nets was banned from the no-take zone and the partial 

protection areas in August 2007, with the implementation of the full no-take area only 

taking place in 2009. In addition, all fishing vessels need a permit to operate inside the 

LSMP. Recreational angling is only permitted in complementary areas and spearfishing 

is prohibited in the entire LSMP. 

Experimental fishing  

In order to estimate the abundance and biomass of cuttlefish and Senegalese sole in 

the LSMP, a total of 106 experimental trammel net fishing sets were carried out. The 

experimental net was made of monofilament and consisted of an inner mesh panel of 

100mm stretched mesh and two outer panels of 600mm stretched mesh. The inner net 

monofilament mesh is of 0.30mm in diameter while that of the outer net is 0.50mm. 

The net was constructed to have 50 inner and 3 outer meshes in height, with a total 

height of 1.60m. Each net had a total of 50m in length and each set consisted of 10 

nets.

experimental fishing sets. The red area corresponds to the no-take area, the 
orange areas represent the partially protected areas and the green areas stand 
for complementary protection areas. 

 

These fishing experiments took place in all protection levels: no-take area, partial 

protection and the complementary protection. Sampling took place three times during 

the first year after the ban of fishing nets in the no-take and partial protection areas 

(December 2007, May 2008 and October of 2008) and three times three years after 

the ban (November 2010, May 2011 and October of 2011). Fishing trials took place in 

two bottom types, sandy bottoms (12-20 m) and muddy bottoms (35-45 m) using 

500m nets per set. Nets were set after sunrise and hauled 20 to 24 h later. The catch 

was sorted onboard to the species level and fish were measured to the nearest 

millimetre. Specimens were released alive whenever possible. 

 

 



108 
 

Data analysis 

Catches of trammel net sets were standardized as catch per unit effort (CPUE) in 

number (n) and weight (kg) per 1000 m of net and per 24 h. Cuttlefish weight was 

obtained by using the weight/length relationship W = 0.325xML2.64, where W is the 

weight in g and ML the mantle length in cm (Serrano 1992). Individual Senegalese sole 

weight was obtained by the weight/length relationship W = 5.29E-06xTL3.104, where W 

is the weight in g and TL the total length in mm (Gonçalves et al. 1997). Abundance and 

biomass were log (x+1) transformed after tested for homogeneity of variance (Levene's 

test). 

In order to determine the effects of protection on the local population of Senegalese 

sole and cuttlefish, differences between the areas where each species was protected 

from fisheries, hereafter designated as ‘impact’ and areas where species were 

accessible to fisheries designated as ‘control’, were examined using ANOVA following a 

beyond BACI experimental design (Underwood 1992, 1994). A three-way model was 

used to examine patterns on the abundance and biomass. The ‘location’ factor, which 

includes the ‘impact’ and ‘control’ areas, was set as a random factor. The factor 

‘before/after’ was set as a fixed factor with two levels. The 2007 and 2008 

experimental fishing campaigns were regarded as ‘before’ the ban of fishing nets since 

they occurred during the first year of ban. In fact, for cuttlefish this period was before 

the onset of protection, since fishing gears such as jigs were still allowed in all areas. 

The factor ‘time of sampling’ was set as a random factor nested in the ‘before/after’ 

factor. Three replicates for each time x location were used. This design allowed us to 

test whether there was an interaction between locations through time (Underwood 

1992, 1994). 

Since Senegalese sole is captured using fishing nets, the areas were these were banned 

(no-take and partially protected areas) were regarded as the putative ‘impact’ zone 

while the complementary protection zone was used as ‘control’. For cuttlefish the no-

take area corresponded to the ‘impact’ while the partial and complementary 

protection zones correspond to ‘control’ because fishing gears that target cuttlefish 

such as jigs are still allowed in the partially protected areas.

Results  

 

Large variations were observed in the CPUE of cuttlefish, both in abundance and 

biomass (Figure 5.2 and Figure 5.3). However, the beyond BACI analysis showed that 

neither the number of individuals nor the biomass of cuttlefish differed between the 

no-take area and the controls (Table 5.1). There was also no difference in the temporal 

pattern from one control location to other. More importantly, there was no significant 

difference between before and after the implementation of the reserve in either the 

no-take or the control areas (Table 5.1).

For Senegalese sole only the data from fishing trials on shallower sandy bottoms was 

analysed with the beyond BACI design since there were no captures on muddy 

bottoms in over 60% of the trials. A decline both in abundance and biomass was 

observed for Senegalese between the two sampling periods (Figure 5.4 and Figure 5.5). 

The results of the beyond BACI analysis show that temporal trends in mean abundance 

and biomass of Senegalese sole were similar among the three locations ‘before’ the 

fishing net ban in the no-take and partial protection areas (Table 5.2: T(Bef)xC and 

T(Bef)xI were non-significant). Additionally, temporal trends in mean abundance and 

biomass of Senegalese sole did not differ significantly between the two putatively 

impacted zones (no-take and partial protection), as well as between these and that of 

the control area from before to after the ban (Table 5.2: BxC and BxI were non-

significant). Therefore, no significant change was detected in mean abundance or 

biomass of Senegalese sole attributable to the ban of fishing nets.

Discussion 

 

The high variation observed in the cuttlefish CPUE among sampling periods is, most 

probably, a consequence of stochastic variability on reproductive success and 

recruitment. Large interannual variation in cuttlefish recruitment has been observed in 

the English Channel (Royer et al. 2006) and is described for several cephalopod stocks 

(Royer et al. 2002, Young et al. 2004). In fact, large fluctuations in recruitment success 

are to be expected in semelparous species, such as the cuttlefish, since the success of 

their reproduction is highly dependent on favorable environmental conditions at the 

time of their reproduction (Pierce et al. 2008). Sea temperature and currents are two 

of the variables that are known to affect cuttlefish recruitment and abundance (Wang 

et al. 2003). Henriques et al. (2007) have shown that SST and other factors such as 

wind and current patterns, which are greatly influenced by the North Atlantic 

Oscillation (NAO), strongly influence the fish assemblages of the LSMP. 

No evidence of an effect on Senegalese sole or cuttlefish abundance or biomass due to 

protection status of the LSMP was found. Although it is possible that our sampling 

design failed to show putative effects, such designs are considered robust enough and 

therefore we are confident with regard to the no-effect conclusion. In fact, the use of a 

beyond-BACI approach is considered one of the most robust and valuable methods to 

examine the potential effects of MPAs and has been advocated by several authors in 

order to provide unequivocal empirical evidences of such effects (e.g. Fraschetti et al. 

2002, Guidetti 2002, Russ 2002). According to Underwood (1992), with the use of this 

procedure the effect of protection can be identified and distinguished from the 

stochastic variability of natural populations. Therefore, the fact that no significant 

interactions were found between the periods ‘before’ and ‘after’ the implementation 

of the LSMP regulations indicate that, if there was indeed an effect of its 

implementation on the abundance or biomass of the local populations of cuttlefish 

and Senegalese sole, then this effect was too small to be detected.  

Despite the similar results for both species the reasons for the apparent lack of effect 

of the LSMP on the abundance and biomass are most probably different. In the case of 



115 
 

cuttlefish, the results of a previous acoustic telemetry study appear to provide good 

evidence to explain the lack of reserve effect (Abecasis et al. 2013). The study showed 

a lack of site fidelity and the existence of large movements which preclude the reserve 

effect of the LSMP since it cannot offer long term protection (Abecasis et al. 2013). On 

the other hand, the results of the acoustic telemetry study of Senegalese sole suggest 

that the LSMP could be providing enough protection to this species given the high site 

fidelity and the size of the home range (Chapter 3). Yet, the results of the beyond BACI 

analysis failed to detect any significant interaction between the impact/control areas 

and the period before/after the ban of fishing nets in the abundance and biomass of 

Senegalese sole. A very parsimonious explanation for this lack of effect is the relatively 

young age of the LSMP. The use of fishing nets in the no-take and partially protected 

areas was only banned in 2007. It has been proven that the age of marine reserves has 

a positive impact on commercial fish species abundance and biomass (Roberts et al. 

2001, Alcala et al. 2005). Another possibility is that the small size of the reserve 

precludes such an effect if the establishment of new individuals inside the reserve is 

limited by an already saturated habitat, especially if adult habitat use is mediated by a 

territorial system and if juveniles face high competition for access to high quality 

habitat, thus promoting density-dependent emigration. Such a pattern would, 

however, promote spillover but not the build up of biomass and, consequently, of 

increased reproductive output and larval supply from the MPA. 

Clearly, a conclusive evaluation will require continued monitoring for a period of years 

concomitant with that necessary for benefits to be seen for most species elsewhere. 

Future studies should also be carried in the areas adjacent to the LSMP in order to test 

the effects of the implementation of the LSMP in these areas where Senegalese sole 

and cuttlefish are two of the most important fish resources. Additionally, the analysis 

of the landing records of the nearby fishing ports of Sesimbra and Setúbal could be 

interesting. However, it must be taken into account not only that this data is mostly 

incomplete due to illegal and unreported catches but also that there is no 

differentiation of sole species in the official landings statistics (Batista et al. 2009, 

Teixeira &amp;amp; Cabral 2009).

Combining multispecies home range and distribution models to 

evaluate the optimal design of MPAs 

 

Abstract 

 

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are today’s most important tools for the spatial 

management and conservation of marine species. Yet, the true protection that they 

provide to individual fish is unknown, leading to some of the uncertainty associated 

with MPA effectiveness. Importantly, there has been very little progress on how to 

translate the individual scale of movement and home range data to the more relevant 

population scale when evaluating the effectiveness of protection from MPAs or 

forecasting their optimal designs. In this study, conducted in a small and recently 

established MPA (Luiz Saldanha Marine Park, Portugal), we combined the results of 

individual home range estimation and population distribution models for three species 

of commercial importance and contrasting life histories to infer 1) the size of suitable 

areas where they would be fully protected, and 2) the vulnerability to fishing mortality 

of each species throughout the MPA. The results demonstrate that the protection 

offered by MPAs varies substantially, depending on the species home range and on the 

extent of the suitable protected area. This study highlights the need to consider a 

multi-species approach and provides an explicit framework to upscale from individual 

telemetry data to the needed population scale that can be of wide applicability for 

studies evaluating the optimal design of MPAs.

Introduction 

 

Marine protected areas (MPAs) have become a key spatial management and 

conservation tool for coastal nations worldwide but their effectiveness is largely 

uncertain in most cases, if not all (Kaiser 2011). In fact, the size of the areas where the 

different species are effectively protected and the amount of time they are available to 

the fishery is typically unknown.  

The adequate design and management of MPAs is highly dependent on the quality of 

the baseline ecological information. Of particular relevance is the knowledge of the 

species’ site fidelity, distribution and habitat use (Glazer and Delgado 2006; Grüss et al. 

2011; Le Quesne and Codling 2009; Schmiing et al. 2013). This data can not only help 

determine the initial location and correct size of MPAs based on the species habitat 

requirements, but also provide relevant information for the adaptive management of 

already implemented MPAs.  

Recent studies have presented quantitative models to assess the efficiency of MPAs 

(Le Quesne and Codling 2009; Moffitt et al. 2009; Walters et al. 2007). However, these 

models do not take in consideration that no-take areas do not, in most cases, consist 

of 100% of suitable habitats. It is therefore possible that a no-take area, several times 

larger than the species home range does not offer adequate protection. 

Acoustic telemetry is one of the most widely used methods to track marine species, as 

it provides long-term, fine scale spatio-temporal data on individual movement and 

home range (e.g. Abecasis et al. 2012; Abecasis et al. 2013b). However, very little has 

been done and there is no consensus on how to translate such individual data - the 

typical output of telemetry studies - into the more relevant population scale projection 

when evaluating the effectiveness of protection provided from existing MPAs or 

forecasting their optimal designs. 

This study provides a framework to upscale the telemetry data from the individual to 

the population level. This was achieved by combining information of species home 

range areas with species distribution models so as to calculate the effective protection 



122 
 

provided to three species with contrasting life histories by a small coastal MPA, the 

Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP, Portugal). In particular, this study focused on 

analysing the vulnerability to fishing of the three species – cuttlefish (Sepia officinallis), 

Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) and white seabream (Diplodus sargus) - and on 

estimating the size of suitable areas where these species are in fact protected from 

local fisheries. Arguably, an MPA design based on the requirements of only three 

species is unlikely to ensure the full protection of all local marine species. 

Nevertheless, the contrasting life histories of these three species, all of which are also 

of key commercial importance for the region, ensure the wide spectra needed to 

demonstrate the wider applicability of this framework towards this MPA and 

elsewhere. This study is also innovative in combining typical finfish with cephalopods 

and flatfishes, seldom used in MPA studies (Horta e Costa et al. 2013; Lester et al. 

2009) 

Species distribution models (SDMs) have become an important tool for studies in 

biogeography, ecology, species management, conservation biology and climate change 

(Bean et al. 2012; Elith and Leathwick 2009b; Guisan and Thuiller 2005; Guisan and 

Zimmermann 2000). These statistical methods associate species data (presence, 

presence/absence or abundance) with mapped environmental predictor variables 

and/or geographical information so as to provide information on the presence of 

species across the entire area of interest (Guisan and Zimmermann 2000).  

Recent developments in the field of SDMs have produced multiple methods (Elith and 

Graham 2009; Elith et al. 2006) which are now commonly used to predict species 

distribution, including generalized linear or additive models (GLMs or GAMs), 

multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), boosted regression trees (BRT) and 

maximum entropy modeling (Maxent) (Elith and Leathwick 2009a; Newbold 2009). The 

low data requirements and the ease of integration with GIS analysis have made 

Maxent one of the most widely used software for SDM (Elith et al. 2006, Elith &amp;amp; 

Leathwick 2009). Different comparative studies using a wide range of data 

demonstrated that Maxent is consistently among the best performing methods (Elith 

et al. 2006; Hernandez et al. 2006; Navarro-Cerrillo et al. 2011). Maxent is a machine 

learning method that predicts potentially suitable environmental conditions for the 



123 
 

species through the use of presence records and a set of environmental variables, 

continuous and/or categorical, that are likely to influence the species fitness and long-

term persistence (Phillips et al. 2006; Phillips and Dudík 2008).  

The main objectives of this study were 1) to determine the amount of suitable habitats 

where three of the most commercially important fish species are effectively protected 

2) to determine the vulnerability of these species to fishing throughout the LSMP. 

 

Materials and Methods 

 

Study area  

This study took place in the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP), which was established 

in 1998 yet only fully implemented in 2009. Located on the Portuguese western coast, 

this MPA covers an area of approximately 53 km2 stretching over 38 km of coastline. It 

includes a narrow stretch of rocky reef habitats down to a depth of 15 m and a wider 

stretch of soft substrates (sand and mud) down to 100 m. The LSMP regulations specify 

different zones and limitations to extractive activities. Commercial fisheries have 

different limitations within the different zones: all fisheries are excluded from a no-

take zone of about 4.3 km2; octopus traps and jigs are allowed within the four partial 

protection zones totalling 21 km2; and commercial fishing boats less than 7m long are 

allowed to operate using traditional fishing gear within the three complementary 

protection zones totalling 28 km2. Spearfishing is prohibited within the entire area of 

the LSMP, whereas recreational angling is only allowed within the three 

complementary protection zones. With these regulations, the cuttlefish is only fully 

protected from its targeted fishery (trammel nets and jigs) within the no-take zone, 

whereas the white seabream and the Senegalese sole are fully protected from their 

targeted fisheries (longlines and nets, respectively) within both the no-take zone and 

partial protection zone. 

 



124 
 

Study species 

This study focused on three species: the sparid Diplodus sargus (white seabream), the 

flatfish Solea senegalensis (Senegalese sole) and the cephalopod Sepia officinalis 

(cuttlefish). The three species are very distinctive from each other as they present 

contrasting ecological traits and life-histories, but share high economical value across 

southern Europe. In the LSMP area, both the cuttlefish and the Senegalese sole are 

targeted by the local small-scale commercial vessels that operate with trammel nets 

and gillnets (Batista et al. 2009), whereas the white seabream is mainly captured by 

artisanal longlines and recreational fishing (Veiga et al. 2010). Their habitat 

preferences are also very distinct: the Senegalese sole is a benthonic species that 

occupies soft substrates, the white seabream is a demersal species that prefers hard 

substrates such as rocky reefs, but also forages on soft substrates and the cuttlefish is 

a nekton-benthonic species that makes use of both types of substrates. All three 

species have very different life-histories, even though they all use estuaries as nursery 

areas. Cuttlefish are semelparous species with a maximum life time of about two years 

(Le Goff and Daguzan 1991), whereas the Senegalese sole and the white seabream are 

iteroparous species that can reach 8 and 18 years old respectively (Abecasis et al. 

2008, Teixeira and Cabral 2010). By focusing on species that present such different 

biological, ecological and economic characteristics, this study should allow us to shed 

light on the benefits and performance of this MPA for a wider range of species.  

Species distribution modelling  

To model species distribution, we used the Maxent software version 3.3.3k (available 

from http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/) with the maximum number of 

iterations set to 5000. Based on the ecological knowledge of the three species and the 

availability of environmental data for the area, we selected the following variables as 

explanatory variables in the model: ‘habitat’, ‘bathymetry’, ‘curvature’, ‘slope’, ‘aspect’ 

and ‘distance to rocky bottom’. The variables ‘curvature’, ‘slope’ and ‘aspect’ represent 

the surface curvature, the rate of maximum change in depth from each cell and the 

direction that the slope is facing (North, South, East, West), respectively. The variables 

‘habitat’ and ‘aspect’ were set as categorical variables, whereas the remaining 

variables were set as continuous. Information on ‘habitat’ was collected by the 



125 
 

Portuguese Sea and Atmosphere Institute (IPMA), using acoustic and video surveys, 

during the BIOMARES project (Cunha et al. 2011). This data was presented in raster 

format with a cell size of approximately 40m x 40m. The variable ‘bathymetry’ was 

estimated by combining data from a recent bathymetric survey carried out by IPMA 

with information collected by the project BIOMARES. All the data used to estimate 

‘bathymetry’ were included in the development of a raster file using the ‘inverse 

distance weighting’ (IDW) raster interpolation tool available in the 3D Analyst Tools 

package for ArcGIS 9.3. This final raster had a cell size of approximately 39m x 39m and 

was the basis for estimating the variables ‘slope’, ‘aspect’ (slope direction) and 

‘curvature’ using the Raster Surface tools in the 3D Analyst Tools package for ArcGIS 

9.3. In addition, we estimated the variable ‘distance to rocky bottom’ by extracting the 

areas containing rocky substrate using the ‘extract by attributes’ tool and then creating 

a new raster file with the Euclidean distance to the nearest rocky bottom. All the raster 

files produced for the different variables were converted to the same projection, cell 

size and geographic limits. We used the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) to test for 

correlations between variables, given that high correlations between variables should 

be avoided in SDM as they could lead to over fitting of the model.  

We used presence data from previous acoustic telemetry studies on these three 

species (Abecasis et al. 2013a; unpublished data) as training data for the SDMs. A 

sampling bias file with the extension of the acoustically monitored area was used to 

remove the sampling distribution bias (Phillips et al. 2009). Data from experimental 

trammel net monitoring surveys was used as independent test data for cuttlefish and 

Senegalese sole (Abecasis et al. 2013a; unpublished data). For the cuttlefish, however, 

given that its acoustic telemetry data presented a short temporal extent (November to 

December), we only considered the trammel net surveys carried out during autumn, 

which correspond to approximately the same time frame. As for the white seabream 

we obtained test data from underwater visual observations given that this species is 

rarely caught by the trammel nets (for more details see Horta e Costa et al. 2013). We 

ran models with regularization multipliers of 0.5, 1, 2, 2.5 and 3, and compared them 

using the small sample size corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), estimated 

using ENMTools (Warren and Seifert 2011), as recommended by Rodda et al. (2011). 



126 
 

The regularization multiplier parameter affects how closely fitted the output 

distribution is – a value smaller than the default of 1.0 will result in a closer fit to the 

given presence records, while a larger regularization multiplier will give a more spread 

out, less localized prediction. The AICc approach weights model fit with the number of 

included variables to provide a relative score for each model. This score was then used 

to rank the models so as to determine the best resembling model based upon a 

combination of explanatory power and parsimony criteria (Burnham et al. 2011).  

After selecting the most adequate regularization multiplier we tried different feature 

approaches by running models using hinge only, linear plus quadratic and auto 

features. Following the comparison of the different models with the AICc approach, we 

proceeded with the jackknife test of variable importance to see if any of the variables 

could be removed without sacrificing the model performance. The jackknife test 

calculates the drop in performance as each variable is removed from the fully specified 

model. We started with all variables and then proceeded by removing each variable 

one by one based on the drop of the regularized training gain.  

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used for model 

evaluation (Elith 2002). Although Lobo et al. (2008) considered that AUC was not 

appropriate for model comparison, Elith et al. (2011) have found it suitable to test for 

the model's predictive performance. The AUC statistic ranges between 0 and 1, with 1 

representing a perfect model and 0.5 a model no different from random. To test the 

significance of the SDMs, we tested the AUC value against a null distribution of 

expected AUC values based on random sampling (Raes and ter Steege 2007). For each 

species, 99 random null models were created and the 95 % confidence interval was 

calculated. Since the presence locations were biased, the randomly drawn points were 

selected from the acoustically monitored area to avoid higher chances of significantly 

deviating from the null model.  

Because Maxent produces continuous models, thresholds were adopted to make a 

distinction between suitable and unsuitable habitat areas. Two thresholds were 

applied, the lowest presence threshold (LPT) and the maximum sensitivity plus 

specificity threshold (MSST). The LPT, also known as minimum training presence, is the 



127 
 

lowest prediction value returned by Maxent for a location with observed presence of 

the species and is one of the most commonly used thresholds (Bean et al. 2012; 

Pearson et al. 2007; Thorn et al. 2009). The MSST is equivalent to finding a point in the 

receiver operating characteristic curve whose tangent slope equals 1 (Cantor et al. 

1999). This threshold is one of the various sensitivity-specificity methods, comparable 

with each other in performance, and has been shown to achieve better results than 

LPT (Bean et al. 2012; Hernandez et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2005). The performance of the 

binary models was measured using the true skill statistic (TSS). The TSS is independent 

of prevalence and its results are highly correlated with the AUC statistic (Allouche et al. 

2006). TSS varies between -1 and 1, where values below 0 represent models that 

perform no better than random and values close to 1 represent perfect agreement. 

We combined information provided by the SDMs with home range information so as 

to determine the effective protection provided by the LSMP to the three study species. 

The minimum, average and maximum length of home range for each species was 

estimated from information collected by previous telemetry studies conducted in the 

area (Abecasis et al, 2013a; unpublished data). From the SDMs, we calculated the size 

of the suitable areas where species were fully protected (no-take zone for cuttlefish 

and no-take plus partial protection zones for Senegalese sole and white seabream). 

Vulnerability to fishing (VX) was estimated for each discrete point along the coast of 

the LSMP for an individual with its home range centered there (Moffitt et al. 2009),

Results 

 

Species distribution models 

The Pearson correlation test did not reveal any strong significant correlation between 

the continuous variables: ‘slope’, ‘bathymetry’, ‘curvature’ and ‘distance to rock’ (r2=0 

to 0.07), with only a medium negative correlation between ‘bathymetry’ and ‘distance 

to rock’ (r2 = - 0.38). Therefore, all variables were initially included in the Maxent 

models.  

 

Cuttlefish  

The cuttlefish distribution model with the regularization parameter of 3 presented the 

highest AUC value. Nevertheless, the AICc revealed that the model using the 

regularization parameter of 1 was the most adequate from a parsimonious perspective 

(Table 6.1). The cuttlefish distribution model using auto features performed better 

than the models using only hinge features or linear plus quadratic features (Table 6.1). 

The AUC value for the models with different predictor variables was higher for the 

model containing the variables ‘bathymetry’, ‘distance to rock’, ‘aspect’ and ‘slope’ 

(Table 6.1). However, the AICc analysis suggests that the best performance was 

achieved when using all variables except ‘slope’ (Table 6.1). 

The jackknife test revealed that ‘bathymetry’ was the variable that contributed the 

most to the model, given that removing this variable resulted in the largest reduction 

of the regularized training gain. The percent contribution of each variable is shown in 

Table 6.2.

The relationship between ‘bathymetry’ and ‘presence probability’ resembles a bell 

shaped curve that peaks around a depth of 15m (Figure 6.1). The response curve of the 

relationship between ‘presence probability’ and ‘distance to rocky bottoms’ suggests 

that, at least during the months of November and December, the probability of 

cuttlefish being present in areas further than 450m away from rocky bottoms is very 

low (Figure 6.1). Medium sand (category 7) and algae on rock (category 8) were the 

habitats that presented the highest probability of cuttlefish presence (Figure 6.1).

Senegalese sole  

The Senegalese sole distribution model with a regularization parameter of 0.5 

achieved the best AUC and AICc values (Table 6.3). Although the model with hinge only 

features achieved the best AUC the AICc revealed that the model using auto features 

was the more adequate. According to the AICc the best model was achieved when 

considering the variables ‘bathymetry’, ‘habitat’, ‘aspect’, ‘slope’ and ‘curvature’. The 

jackknife test revealed that ‘bathymetry’ was the variable that contributed the most to 

the model. The removal of this variable resulted in the largest reduction of the 

regularized training gain, indicating that bathymetry is the variable with the most 

useful information and also the one that appears to have the most information that is 

absent in the other variables. The distribution of Senegalese sole is highly dependent 

on habitat and depth, which account for more than 80% of the SDM (Table 6.2).  

Figure 6.1 presents the probability of presence of Senegalese sole in the study area 

according to the different variables. The highest probability of presence occurred 

between the bathymetries of 5 m and 25 m, sea bottoms facing East, South-East and 

South, fine sands and medium sands habitats, and flatter sea bottoms in general with 

slope angles between 0.3 and 5. 

The map with the final model of the presence probability of Senegalese sole in the 

LSMP area (AUC=0.951; 95% C.I AUC of the biased corrected null model = 0.944) shows 

that the highest presence probabilities were found within the no-take zone and 

adjacent partial protection zones (Figure 6.3). Figure 6.3 also includes the binary maps 

with suitable and unsuitable areas for Senegalese sole according to the final Maxent 

model using the LPT, which reached a TSS of 0.308, and using the MSST, which reached 

a TSS of 0.423.

White seabream  

Although the best training AUC results were obtained for the model that used a 

regularization parameter of 0.5, from a parsimonious point of view the most adequate 

model was achieved when using a regularization parameter of 2 (Table 6.4). When the 

features used were changed, the best model, in terms of AICc was achieved when 

using the auto features option (Table 6.4). According to the AICc results, the best 

model was achieved when only the variables ‘bathymetry’, ‘distance to rock’, ‘aspect’ 

and ‘slope’ were used (Table 6.4). 

 As for the previous species, ‘bathymetry’ was the variable that contributed the most 

to the model, according to the jackknife analysis of variable importance. Besides 

providing the most useful information, this variable seems to present information that 

is absent for other variables. Table 6.2 shows the contribution of each variable to the 

white seabream distribution model. 

According to the final distribution model obtained for white seabream the highest 

probability of presence occurs between the depths of 5 and 10m and when the 

distance to rocky bottoms is less than 120m (Figure 6.1). The map with the final model 

of the presence probability of white seabream in the LSMP area (AUC=0.981; 95% C.I 

AUC of the biased corrected null model = 0.959) demonstrates that the areas with 

highest probabilities are located near rocky shore areas throughout the entire MPA 

(Figure 6.4). The map of suitable and unsuitable areas for white seabream using the 

LPT reached a TSS of 0.494, and the binary map using MSST achieved a lower TSS of 

0.260 (Figure 6.4).

Vulnerability to fishing 

The regulated zones where both the Senegalese sole and the white seabream are 

protected from fishing are larger than 25 km2 in total (no-take plus partially protected 

areas). For cuttlefish, the area where it is fully protected from fisheries is the no-take 

area which corresponds to approximately 4.2 km2. Although cuttlefish are also 

protected in the first 200m from the coastline in partially protected areas these areas 

were not considered given their small size. However, only a small proportion of these 

protected areas corresponds to suitable habitats for these species (Table 6.5). The 

vulnerability to fishing, considering an individual’s home range centered in the middle 

of the no-take area, was 0.0 for every species and home range considered (Figure 6.5). 

Regarding the western partial protection area the vulnerability to fishing was 0.0 for 

white seabream and Senegalese sole except when considering the maximum home 

range for Senegalese sole where it reached a minimum of 0.05 (Figure 6.5). Table 6.6 

shows the percentage of suitable habitat in each protection area for one, two and 

three of the studied species. The overlap of the studied species suitable areas can be 

seen on Figure 6.6.

Discussion  

 

The results of the home range studies together with the strong adequacy of the 

models produced, allow us to draw important conclusions with regard the habitat 

suitability of the LSMP for cuttlefish, Senegalese sole and white seabream, and the 

extent of protection offered by the MPA to these three species.  

 

Model adequacy  

The values of TSS and AUC for the different SDMs are evidence that the final models 

obtained through Maxent are adequate and likely useful instruments for the 

evaluation of the protection offered by MPA and the exposure to fishing. It could be 

argued that other potentially relevant input variables (e.g. hydrodynamics and prey 

distribution and abundance) could also prove useful to improve the predictive power 

of the spatial distribution models of these species. However, information on such 

variables was either absent or unavailable at adequate spatial scales for this area. Also, 

given the number of individual geographical positions obtained from the acoustic 

telemetry studies, only a small number of variables could be used to develop models 

that would be parsimonious and yet biologically relevant (Elith and Leathwick 2009a). 

A model using static environmental variables is more parsimonious because it only 

requires that the distribution of animals is the result of time independent 

environmental cues (Aarts et al. 2008).  

Importantly, the six variables that were selected to run the SDMs reflect various 

environmental factors known to influence marine species distributions. The variable 

‘habitat’ is widely used because marine species are known to prefer specific and 

sometimes distinct habitats throughout their life cycle. The variable ‘bathymetry’ is 

widely used as an indirect proxy for several proximal factors such as temperature, 

salinity, light and pressure (Elith and Leathwick 2009b). The variable ‘aspect’ was 

selected as a proxy for hydrodynamic variables since, in this specific case, bottoms 

oriented to the S and W quadrants are more influenced by strong winds and high seas 



147 
 

whereas those facing N and E quadrants are more sheltered. The variables ‘slope’ and 

‘curvature’ were also taken in consideration because these have been associated as 

predictor variables for several marine species (Leathwick et al. 2008; Owens et al. 

2012; Schmiing et al. 2013). The variable ‘distance to rocky bottoms’ could be 

interpreted differently depending on the studied species. The white seabream, for 

instance, is known to prefer rocky bottom habitats (Abecasis et al. 2013b) and 

therefore ‘distance to rocky bottoms’ is likely to simply stand for distance to its 

preferred habitat. In the particular case of the cuttlefish, however, it can be 

interpreted as distance to spawning grounds, given that this species prefers soft 

substrate but attaches its eggs to hard substrates like seaweeds, shells and debris, and 

such substrates are more frequently found on rocky bottoms. In fact, egg clutches 

were frequently observed in the acoustic receivers’ mooring structures, particularly in 

those located in vast sandy areas furthest away from rocky bottoms (Abecasis et al. 

2013a), where other hard substrates are absent or rare. These observations support 

the hypothesis that cuttlefish uses habitats closer to rocky bottoms during the 

spawning season because it is easier to find adequate substrates to attach their eggs. It 

also explains why the variables ‘distance to rocky bottom’ and ‘bathymetry’ were the 

most important ones for the final cuttlefish’s SDM, especially taking in consideration 

that data collection took place during the migration/spawning months of November 

and December.  

The observed Pearson correlation values were not sufficiently high to require the 

removal of any predictor variable, a step that some authors recommend when high 

correlations are observed (Gregr 2011; Leathwick et al. 2005; Rodda et al. 2011), even 

though Maxent is known to be more stable than other regression methods when using 

correlated variables (Elith et al. 2011; Phillips et al. 2006). 

The response curves obtained for the predictor variables were, in most cases, very 

complex and thus reduced the number of false negatives. This is especially relevant 

because a low number of false negatives is highly desirable in the particular case of 

conservation spatial planning because false negatives could lead potentially suitable 

areas to be left out of management plans (Araújo and Guisan 2006). 



148 
 

The SDMs for Senegalese sole and white seabream were estimated with presence 

locations obtained throughout almost the entire year. Therefore, it is likely that the 

suitability and presence probability maps represent an accurate picture for habitat 

selection of adults of both species in the LSMP. However, this was not the case for 

cuttlefish, for which presence data was only obtained for a shorter period of time 

(Abecasis et al. 2013a). Considering that cuttlefish is a migratory species that inhabits a 

wide range of habitats, it is highly probable that the distribution model obtained 

underestimates the true distribution for this species during its adult phase. Instead, 

the information provided by the model should be interpreted as an SDM for the 

cuttlefish’s spawning period because presence data were obtained from adults during 

this period (Abecasis et al. 2013a).  

 

Habitat suitability  

The suitability maps revealed that the LSMP area facing south contains the highest 

amount of suitable habitats for all three species. The fact that this area is sheltered 

from the dominant North winds and ocean swell has been put forward as one of the 

reasons for its high biodiversity (Gonçalves et al. 2003).  

Despite the good TSS values associated with the obtained SDMs, the results for white 

seabream might be slightly biased given that the areas defined as suitable when using 

the MSST expanded further away from rocky bottoms than anticipated, considering 

the results of experimental fishing trials. Some bias related with less accurate positions 

used as training data may have occurred and, as a result, several sandy bottoms areas 

relatively distant from rocky bottoms scored high probability of presence. Additionally, 

the method used to obtain the fishes’ fine scale positions has limited capability to 

distinguish between a true position over rocky bottom from an assumed position over 

sandy bottoms. This limitation results from the fact that the acoustic receivers were 

located in line with each other, parallel to the coast, and on sandy bottoms. 

Consequently, nearly all locations were associated with sandy bottoms when, in fact, 

fish were likely roving over the nearby rocky bottoms within the detection range. This 

possibility is supported by the inclusion of ‘distance to rocky bottoms’ as the second 



149 
 

most important variable for the white seabream distribution model, confirming 

previous studies that demonstrated this species’ preference for rocky bottoms, even 

though excursions to sandy bottoms may be frequent (Abecasis et al. 2013b). 

Regarding the Senegalese sole, the SDM model suggest that fine and medium sand are 

the habitats with the highest probabilities of presence, which is consistent with the 

results of habitat selection studies (unpublished data). 

Depth was the variable that most contributed to the distribution model of white 

seabream and Senegalese sole and the third most important for the cuttlefish model. 

According to our models, the depth interval in which the white seabream and the 

Senegalese sole were more common is consistent with the results obtained during the 

experimental fishing (unpublished data). As for cuttlefish, the model suggested a 

presence probability limited to the interval between 0 and 40 meters deep. However, 

this might not reflect the true bathymetric distribution of this species, which is known 

to occur at depths up to 200m (Guerra 2006), particularly because the area monitored 

during the acoustic telemetry campaigns was confined to shallower habitats given the 

limited number of receivers available. Moreover, the presence locations were 

obtained during a short period of time which overlapped the spawning season, during 

which cuttlefish has been reported to migrate into shallower waters (Ezzeddine-Najai 

1997; Gauvrit et al. 1997; Wang et al. 2003). 

 

Protection  

Our results demonstrate that the LSMP offers different levels of protection, depending 

on species. This is not only the result of the different regulations applied to each of the 

LSMP’s zones (e.g. the fishery targeting cuttlefish is only forbidden within the no-take 

zone, whereas the fisheries targeting Senegalese sole and white seabream are 

forbidden in both the no-take and partially protected zones) but also a consequence of 

the different movement patterns and home range areas required by each species. 

Overall, the LSMP appears to provide full protection from fisheries to resident 

individuals of white seabream and Senegalese sole that have their home range 



150 
 

centered anywhere in the no-take area or in central areas of partial protection zones. 

In fact, the results of a recent study suggest that white seabream may already be 

benefiting from the implementation of the LSMP (Horta e Costa et al. 2013). As for the 

Senegalese sole, the LSMP seems to play an important role in the protection of local 

stocks, given the large size of suitable areas for this species located within areas where 

the species is fully protected. However, the effects of protection to this species are yet 

to be detected (unpublished data).  

Cuttlefish, on the other hand, appears to benefit from less protection as our results 

indicate higher vulnerability to fishing throughout the LSMP. Previous studies suggest 

that this species presents low site fidelity and undertakes large migrations (Abecasis et 

al. 2013a), which is consistent with the short periods of time in which tagged cuttlefish 

remained within the study area. Therefore, despite the protection provided by the no-

take area to cuttlefish, this result might be misleading since this species presents no 

site fidelity. 

It should be taken in consideration that this study focuses on adult individuals only. 

Important factors such as larval dispersal and recruitment should be taken in 

consideration when overall MPA efficiency is assessed. Nevertheless, this framework 

provides important information regarding the protection of commercially important 

fish species.  

Conclusions 

This study demonstrates that long-term passive acoustic telemetry data in conjunction 

with fine scale environmental data and maximum entropy modeling techniques can 

provide useful SDMs. The combined use of home range areas and SDMs provides a 

better insight into the true potential of MPAs in effectively protecting marine species, 

since it can reveal the size of the areas where protection is most effective and a clear, 

quantitative estimation of the vulnerability to fishing throughout the entire MPA. It 

can and should be used in identifying multispecies optimal MPA designs, whether this 

is done a priori or as part of an adaptive management strategy of MPAs. 



151 
 

In the particular case of the LSMP, the levels of protection suggest that this MPA may 

provide adequate protection for Senegalese sole and white seabream if compliance is 

adequate, but this is not the case of cuttlefish, given this species’ higher levels of 

exposure to fisheries and very low residency.

Abstract 

 

Currently, there is still much discussion on the most appropriate location, size and 

shape of marine protected areas (MPAs). These three factors were analyzed for a small 

coastal MPA, the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP), for which a very limited amount of 

local ecological information was available at the start of its implementation in 1998. 

Marxan was used to provide a number of near optimal solutions considering different 

levels of protection for the various conservation features and different costs. These 

solutions were compared with the existing no-take area of the LSMP. Conservation 

features included eleven habitat types and distribution models for three of the most 

important species for the local artisanal fisheries. The human activities with highest 

impact in the study area (commercial and recreational fishing and scuba diving) were 

used as costs. The results show that the existing no-take area is actually located in the 

best area. However, the no-take area offers limited protection to vagile fish and covers 

a very small proportion of some of the available habitats. An increase in the 

conservation targets led to an increase in the number of no-take areas. The best 

solution, to target 15% of each conservation feature included three separate no-take 

areas totalling an area almost twice the size of the existing no-take. Yet, although 

providing higher level of protection to most habitats individually, each no-take area 

offers less protection to the fish species. An increase in 30% resulted in four no-take 

areas but, in this case, the protection offered to the study species was higher given 

their larger size.

Introduction 

 

The design, size and location of marine protected areas (MPAs) continue to be widely 

debated but no consensus has yet been found (Glazer and Delgado 2006, White et al. 

2009, Gaines et al. 2010). High-quality baseline information is essential not only to 

determine the design, size and location of MPAs but also to help during the adaptive 

management process, given that many times such information is not available at the 

time of MPA creation. Adaptive management is a formal process to improve 

management practices by learning from the outcomes of operational and experimental 

approaches (Bunnel et al. 2009). This process should be both scientific and social, 

requiring an open management where all stakeholders are included. The effectiveness 

of this approach is based on four key elements (Agardy et al. 2003, Grafton &amp;amp; Kompas 

2005). First, it is adaptive, and intended to be self-improving. Second, it is a formal 

approach that combines the power of science with the practicality of management. 

Third, it is an on-going process for continually improving management, so the design 

must connect directly to the actions it is intended to improve. Fourth, although 

experimental approaches can be incorporated into adaptive management effectively, 

operational approaches and temporal and spatial scales are emphasized to allow direct 

connection to the efforts of managers.  

Data on habitat type is considered to be the core baseline information since it can 

often be mapped relatively easily and because it can serve as a proxy for benthic 

biodiversity (Smith et al. 2006). Most authors agree that this baseline information 

should also include information on the movements, patterns of habitat use, home 

range areas and site fidelity of target species to protect (Babcock et al. 2012, Glazer 

and Delgado 2006). In addition, the need to include socioeconomic data is also 

becoming evident (Ban et al. 2009). Despite all these considerations most MPAs are 

designed and implemented with little baseline information and the process rarely 

takes into consideration all the stakeholders. This was the case of the Luiz Saldanha 

Marine Park (Portugal), a small coastal MPA implemented starting in 1998. 



160 
 

Geographic information systems (GIS) are one of the best tools to visualize the 

distribution of different habitats, the location of essential fish habitats and other 

information relevant to the design and management of MPAs. However, GIS alone 

does not provide stakeholders with design options, including where best to locate 

MPAs. The optimization of an MPA design is a problem where the goal is to find the 

best possible solution given a set of targets and constraints. The recent development 

of systematic conservation planning software has provided stakeholders with tools 

that present different MPA design solutions. Of the several available software options, 

Marxan is the most widely used given its ability to include different types of data and 

the easy connection with GIS (Ball et al. 2009). It has been used in studies throughout 

the world including the design of several MPAs such as the Channel Islands and 

Madagascar (Airame et al. 2003, Allnutt et al. 2012). Marxan tries to find a near 

optimal solution that reaches the pre-determined conservation targets while 

maintaining the cost of including planning units as low as possible. The costs 

associated with each planning unit can represent acquisition costs, management costs 

or opportunity costs. In marine environments opportunity costs related with 

commercial and/or recreational fisheries catch or effort are commonly used. 

Since Marxan provides several near optimal solutions, it allows dialogue between the 

different stakeholder groups in order to achieve the best compromise for all user 

groups involved, in a transparent manner.  

In this study we compared the location and design of an already implemented coastal 

no-take area included in the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (Portugal) with different near 

optimal solutions provided by Marxan. The influence of different target levels and 

costs on the optimal design and location of the no-take area was tested. Besides 

providing a comparative framework that can be applied elsewhere this information is 

especially relevant to local stakeholders and managers in order to proceed with 

adaptive management.

Materials and Methods  

 

This study focused on the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP), a marine reserve located 

in the Setúbal Peninsula (Portugal). The LSMP was established in 1998 but 

management regulations were only fully implemented in 2009. Although covering an 

area of approximately 53 km2, only 4.2 km2 are included in one no-take zone where all 

human activities, apart from those related with scientific research and enforcement, 

are prohibited. The remaining area includes 21 km2 of partially protected areas, where 

only octopus traps and jigs are allowed at more than 200m from the shoreline, and 28 

km2 of complementary areas where traditional fishing gears are allowed for vessels 

smaller than 7m and recreational angling is permitted (Figure 7.1).

protection level areas. 

 

Eleven different habitat types were identified in the LSMP by the Portuguese Sea and 

Atmosphere Institute (IPMA) during acoustic and video surveys carried during the 

BIOMARES project (Cunha et al. 2011). 



162 
 

In addition to the information on different habitats, the habitat suitability for three key 

species (cuttlefish, white seabream and Senegalese sole) was also used. These species 

present very different life-history, ecological traits and economic values (see Chapter 

6). This information comprised three different levels for each species. The first level 

corresponds to unsuitable areas for the species, the second to areas where the 

probability of presence was up to 80%, and the final level where the presence 

probability was over 80%. 

The study area was divided in planning units consisting of regular hexagons with an 

area of 1600 m2 (each side with 24.816 m). The total amount of each feature was 

quantified for the entire LSMP and for the no-take area only. This allowed us to know 

the total area of each conservation feature available in the LSMP and also the amount 

of protection offered by the already implemented no-take area to each of the 20 

conservation features (the 11 different habitat types and the three suitability level 

areas for each species). 

Six different scenarios with different costs and targets were run in Marxan (Table 7.1). 

Although there are many human activities in the region, the one with the most 

significant and direct impact on marine resources in the LSMP area is commercial 

fishing, followed by recreational fishing and scuba diving (Gonçalves, 2005). Data on 

fishing effort (boat based commercial and recreational fishing) was based on the 

results of Gonçalves (2005). The most important scuba diving locations were also taken 

in consideration. This data was obtained from Rodrigues (2008) and consists of a 100m 

buffer around the 25 most dived locations based on the number of divers in each 

location for four diving tour operators. Two different cost layers were considered, 1) 

commercial fishing only and 2) combined cost of commercial fishing, recreational 

fishing and scuba diving. Data on fishing effort and diving locations from a period 

before the implementation of the LSMP were used in order to compare with the 

situation when the LSMP was implemented. 

Three different targets were chosen: 1) targets that were the same as the protection 

offered to each conservation feature by the implemented no-take area, 2) 15% of the 

total available area in the LSMP for each of the habitats and 5%, 15% and 30% of each 



163 
 

species unsuitable, suitable and highly suitable areas for each species respectively and 

3) 30% of the total available area in the LSMP for each of the habitats and 10%, 30% 

and 50% of each species unsuitable, suitable and highly suitable areas respectively 

(Table 7.1).

For each scenario, 100 Marxan models were run with 1x109 iterations using the Zonae 

Cogito interface (Segan et al. 2011). The boundary length modifier (BLM) option was 

used to ensure the solutions comprised a compact set of no-take areas. Although a 

compact network required protecting a greater total area to meet our targets, the 

resulting no-take areas are more likely to be successful than a highly fragmented and 

dispersed network. The BLM was fine tuned following the procedures described in 

Game and Grantham (2008). The number of times a planning unit was selected in a run 

was estimated in order to identify the areas that were chosen more often, indicative of 

areas of higher importance. 

 

Results 

 

The results for scenarios 1 and 2, where the targets for all conservation features are 

the same as in the existing no-take area, show that the implemented no-take area is 

very close to the near optimal solution estimated by Marxan considering the 

conservation features used in this study (Figure 7.2). This was true when considering 

the combined costs of commercial and recreational fishing together with scuba diving 

but also when considering the costs of commercial fishing alone. When observing the 

number of times each planning unit was selected there were two highly selected areas 

located at opposite ends of the no-take area. Nevertheless, the most chosen planning 

units are inside the existing no-take area (Figure 7.3). For this reason, the amount of 

suitable habitats is very close to the results obtained for the existing no-take area 

(Table 7.2).

With the targets set to 15% for each of the habitats and 5%, 15% and 30% of each 

species unsuitable, suitable and highly suitable areas respectively (scenarios 3 and 4) 

the solutions provided by Marxan include three distinct areas which comprise part of 

the existing no-take area but also areas in two complementary protection zones 

(Figure 7.2). Figure 7.3 shows the number of times each planning unit was selected in 

scenarios 3 and 4. There were no large differences in the amount of suitable habitat 

included in the no-take area between the existing no-take area and scenarios 3 and 4 

(Table 7.2). However, in the latter, all habitats had at least 15% of their total area 

protected, which clearly contrasts with the protection provided by the existing no-take 

area where some habitats have less than 5% of the total available area protected

(Table 7.2). Scenarios 3 and 4 present three no-take areas with a total area close to 

twice the size of the implemented no-take area (Table 7.2).   

For scenarios 5 and 6 (30% of each habitat and 10%, 30% and 50% of each species 

unsuitable, suitable and highly suitable) the best solutions included four no-take areas 

totalling an area almost 3.5 times larger than the existing no-take area (Figure 7.2). The 

summed solutions of the 100 Marxan runs for scenarios 5 and 6 show four large, highly 

selected areas including the whole already implemented no-take area (Figure 7.3).

Discussion 

 

This study focused on three of the most important fish species for the local artisanal 

fisheries operating in the vicinity of the LSMP. Given the limitations on data availability 

we used information on 11 different habitats identified in the LSMP and habitat 

suitability models for the three of the most important species as conservation 

features. Smith et al. (2009) recommend the use of habitat type as conservation 

features since it can act as a surrogate for benthic biodiversity. These authors also 

recognize that species distributions models can be used as conservation features. 

Regarding the cost layers, and because the true cost of all human activities is still a 

long way from being quantified, we opted to use the best available spatial data on the 

location and intensity of the major human activities taking place in the LSMP.  

Our results demonstrate that, if the targets of the no-take area were to be the ones 

achieved by the already implemented no-take area, then its current location is the 

best. This was true when considering the cost of commercial fishing alone but also 

when taking in consideration the combined costs of commercial and recreational 

fishing together with scuba diving. However, the protection achieved by the 

implemented no-take area is not enough to effectively protect cuttlefish (Abecasis et 

al., 2013) and it also covers small amounts of largely available habitats such as rocky 

outcrops (&lt;1%), coarse sand (&lt;5%) or muddy fine sand (&lt;3%). Although these habitats 

are not the most relevant for the three studied species, there are other commercial 

species for which such habitats are important (e.g. Solea solea, Microchirus azevia, 

Chelidonichthys spp.).  

In contrast, the results for scenarios 3 and 4, with targets set to 15% of each habitat 

and 5%, 10% and 30% for species different suitability levels, show a total no-take area 

with almost twice the size of the existing no-take area. Nevertheless, because the best 

solution includes three separate no-take areas, their effectiveness might be limited 

since their individual area is less than 3.4 km2 which provides little protection from 

fisheries (see Chapter 6). Yet, from a fisheries management perspective, these 

scenarios could provide a better solution since they should allow higher amounts of 



170 
 

spillover while still offering some protection (Halpern &amp;amp; Warner 2003, Gaines et al. 

2010, Fenberg et al. 2012). Additionally, in these solutions (scenarios 3 and 4) all 

identified habitats have at least 15% of the area available in the LSMP set as no-take.  

The results obtained for scenario 5 and 6 (with targets set to 30% of each habitat and 

5%, 10% and 30% for species different suitability levels) also contemplate several no-

take areas, but because these areas are larger (two areas have more than 4.5km2) they 

offer higher protection to all studied species. In addition, all habitats have at least 30% 

of the total available area set aside as no-take, ensuring a high level of protection. In 

fact, the results of the previous chapter suggest that these scenarios would provide a 

much lower vulnerability to fishing for all three species throughout the LSMP. 

Our options for target levels were based on the literature review which suggests 

targets between 15% and 30% (Allnutt et al. 2012, Fraschetti et al. 2009, Green et al. 

2009). However, some authors claim that, in the case of severely overfished or highly 

mobile species, no-take areas may not be effective as a primary management tool 

unless much more than 20% is closed (e.g. Murawski et al. 2000, Sale et al. 2005). 

Nevertheless, we suggest that target values should be reviewed for each species based 

on monitoring data for each particular MPA, particularly when they are the target of 

MPAs protection. As seen in the previous chapter, the amount of protection offered by 

a no-take area can vary substantially between species. 

In this study we used Marxan to obtain near optimal solutions regarding the design, 

size and location of no-take areas for different scenarios considering different costs 

and conservation targets. The solutions presented in this study suggest that the 

performance of the LSMP could be improved with some changes in its design.  These 

different solutions are useful for the adaptive management of the LSMP, and to the 

wider significance in the context of the science of MPAs. Ecosystem based 

conservation management, especially when considering fisheries management, must 

follow an adaptive management process where changes should be introduced based 

on the evaluation and monitoring processes of the MPA (Grafton and Kompas 2005, 

Hilborn et al. 2004).  



171 
 

The conservation planning process should be an adaptive process where the location 

and size of protected areas change in accordance to new constraints and availability of 

better data (Smith et al. 2009). Therefore, the results provided by the different 

scenarios analyzed, even though based on limited data, provide stakeholders with 

several solutions. This will allow for different approaches regarding targets of 

conservation features and the different costs considered. Information on other 

conservation features such as other species suitable/unsuitable areas and additional 

costs can be added to this framework in order to make the adaptive management an 

evolving and continuous process. 

Even though the actual LSMP design only contemplates one no-take area, the 

enforcement is very poor and transgressions are frequent. Therefore, a solution which 

includes increasing the number of no-take areas would necessarily imply an increase in 

enforcement in order for these areas to function as true no-take areas. 

One other issue would be the loss of fishing grounds for the local artisanal fisheries. 

Fishermen would not only loose access to a larger area, especially when comparing 

scenarios 5 and 6 with the actual design, but there would also be an increasing 

competition for the best fishing grounds. This could eventually lead to a decrease in 

the number of fishing boats as observed after the implementation of the LSMP (Horta 

e Costa et al. 2013). Yet, it is worth noting that when comparing the areas set as no-

take areas in this study with the fishing hotspots found by Horta e Costa et al. (2013) 

there is only a small overlap with the areas presently used by fishermen. This was 

possible because the cost to fisheries was included in the models and therefore the 

most used fishing grounds would still be available in most cases. 

Besides Marxan, other options can be used for systematic conservation planning, such 

as Marxan with zones or Zonation among others. We chose Marxan for its efficiency, 

flexibility and easy integration with GIS. However, it should be noted that Marxan does 

not tell which conservation features are important and how much area should be 

protected. In addition, Marxan only allows one single cost layer and its solutions do 

not ensure the resilience of species. The use of Marxan is not straightforward, as the 



172 
 

process of preparing input files and learning its proper use takes time. Therefore, other 

approaches should be investigated and compared in the future.

General conclusions 

 

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the potential benefits of the Luiz 

Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP) for three species that are particularly important for the 

local small scale artisanal fisheries: the white seabream, the Senegalese sole and the 

cuttlefish. Given that this study started five years after the time of the MPA 

implementation, we also investigated whether any changes on species abundance or 

biomass have occurred within the limits of this the MPA. 

The specific questions we tried to answer were: 

What is the size of cuttlefish, Senegalese sole and white seabream home range 

areas? 

The home range areas (95% KUD) varied between 0.43 and 1.56 km2 (average of 0.77 

km2) for the white seabream and between 0.54 and 2.22 km2 (average of 1.19 km2) for 

the Senegalese sole. The results obtained for cuttlefish were not coherent given the 

low site fidelity that this species presented. 

 Do these species present site fidelity to the marine reserve? 

High site fidelity was observed for the white seabream, as most individuals tagged with 

V9 acoustic transmitters were detected over 50% of the time (average of 70%). Some 

Senegalese sole also presented high site fidelity, yet the majority of the tagged 

individuals were more transient. The cuttlefish demonstrated no site fidelity to the 

study area, with only one individual spending a maximum of 39 days inside the 

monitored area.   

 Do these species favour any particular habitats within the study area? 

The white seabream demonstrated a clear preference for rocky bottoms habitats, 

while the Senegalese sole prefers sandy bottoms, especially medium coarse sand. A 



179 
 

combination of short monitoring periods and large movement patterns invalidated the 

analysis of habitat preferences for the cuttlefish.      

Is it possible to already detect the effects of the marine reserve 

implementation on the abundance and/or biomass of Senegalese sole or 

cuttlefish? 

The results of the experimental fishing trials revealed no significant differences in the 

abundance or biomass of Senegalese sole or cuttlefish between the periods before and 

after the implementation of the LSMP. 

Is the actual design of the LSMP appropriate for the protection/management of 

the three selected species? 

Our results suggest that the existing MPA may offer appropriate protection for the 

Senegalese sole and the white seabream. However, it does not provide adequate 

protection for the cuttlefish, given this species’ low site fidelity and large movements. 

Would changes in the size and location of no-take areas improve the efficiency 

of the LSMP? 

According to the results of the different scenarios obtained with Marxan, the LSMP 

design could be improved in order to offer more protection to habitats that are only 

marginally protected with the current design and/or increase the amount of protection 

offered to the selected species.  

 

Implications for the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park 

 

The results of this study provide appropriate and useful information that can be used 

towards the adaptive management of coastal MPAs and the LSMP in particular. As in 

nearly all MPAs, the need for a multispecies based management is stressed given the 

multispecific nature of the artisanal fisheries operating within the LSMP and its 

adjacent waters. Furthermore, this is an improvement to implement the ecosystem 



180 
 

approach to fisheries management because it adds to the effects of MPAs, which are 

already multispecific and species dependent (Claudet et al. 2010), an explicit 

multispecific consideration into its design.  

While one should recognise that an MPA based on three species is unlikely to meet the 

requirements of all species occurring in the region, we also emphasize that the three 

species were selected for their contrasting characteristics (life history, economic value, 

etc) in order to capture as much ecological variability (hence variability effects) as 

possible. In addition, these species are economically important throughout the 

Mediterranean and ecologically similar to target species of other commercial fisheries 

in temperate coastal areas elsewhere. Furthermore, the results obtained in this study 

are representative of a wide variety of species that are important to sustain the local 

artisanal fisheries and fishers’ livelihoods, which is one of this MPA’s objectives.  

For the white seabream and the Senegalese sole, the observed values of site fidelity 

and size of home range areas suggest that the LSMP offers an adequate level of 

protection to these species. In contrast, the LSMP offers little protection to the 

cuttlefish, given that this species shows no site fidelity and performs movements of up 

to more than 15 km. For migratory species such as the cuttlefish, management in the 

coastal zone alone has been shown to be insufficient in ensuring sustainable 

exploitation (Royer et al. 2006). In fact, Shipp (2003) has suggested that when species 

are too mobile to remain within the limits of an MPA, traditional fishery management 

measures such as gear restrictions, seasonal closures, or catch quotas are more 

effective than MPAs. 

This study provided a suite of ecological information, such as habitat use, home range 

areas, site fidelity estimates and, especially, measures of vulnerability to fishing 

mortality inside the LSMP for the three contrasting species. This information is of 

extreme importance in understanding the implications of the LSMP for the 

management of these species, and may be useful for the development of an adequate 

MPA management plan with a design and regulations tailored to their characteristics. 

On the downside, this study did not provide evidence of detectable ecological effects 

caused by the LSMP implementation. This is most likely to be a result of the short 



181 
 

period of time in which the LSMP’s regulations have been fully implemented, given 

that the ecological effects of an MPA are known to be highly dependent on the age of 

the MPA (Claudet et al. 2008, Vandeperre et al. 2011, Leleu et al. 2012).  

In the event more no-take areas are implemented, as suggested by some of the 

scenarios analyzed in chapter 7, the compliance could be harder to achieve given the 

already low enforcement observed in the only no-take area implemented. The 

increasing competition for fishing grounds could lead to a decrease in the number of 

fishing boat as observed after the implementation of the LSMP (Horta e Costa et al 

2013). 

 

General implications for MPAs  

 

MPAs can provide both conservation and fisheries benefits, yet they should not be 

considered a panacea. In order to achieve sustainable fisheries and to protect 

biodiversity and habitats, fisheries management must include other tools such as the 

prohibition of damaging gears (e.g. trawl), quotas and the reduction of bycatch 

(Roberts et al. 2005). In fact, several authors (Shipp 2003, Roberts et al. 2005, Tetreault 

&amp;amp; Ambrose 2007) regard MPAs as a supplement and not a substitute for traditional 

fishery management tools. According to Roberts et al. (2005) only when combining 

MPAs with traditional fishery management tools will conservation and fishery goals 

become united. 

Nevertheless, in order for MPAs to function as fishery management tools, there needs 

to be an examination of specific instances and specific stocks to determine potential 

benefits (Shipp 2003).  Therefore, the objectives of MPAs should be clearly stated and 

the species and habitats they intend to protect should be identified early in the MPA 

establishment process. 

Natural variability in marine ecosystems is huge and difficult to predict. This makes it 

even more difficult to understand the effectiveness of MPAs. This is why, to this date, 



182 
 

there is no consensus on a framework to evaluate and manage MPAs. The framework 

presented in this study is widely applicable to coastal MPAs, and provides managers 

and stakeholders with relevant and useful information not only for the implementation 

phase of MPAs (establishing their size and location) but also for the adaptive 

management process of existing MPAs. This is a crucial aspect to improve the 

performance of the many coastal MPAs that represent a large proportion of the more 

than 5880 MPAs established throughout the world as of 2010 (Spalding et al. 2010).  

 

Future studies and recommendations 

 

This study focused on three of the most important species for the local small scale 

artisanal fisheries, yet other locally important species such as Solea solea, Octopus 

vulgaris and Raja spp. should not be overlooked, as they are also important resources 

for the local fisheries and information on their site fidelity and home range areas is 

missing. As in the present study, gathering this type of information for those species 

will provide extremely valuable inputs for the adaptive management of MPAs, such as 

distribution models and vulnerability to fishing. 

One of the limitations of this study is the fact that the telemetry studies did not cover 

the entire range of available habitats. Not only did we have a limited number of 

acoustic receivers but detailed information on habitat was only available towards the 

end of the acoustic telemetry campaigns, preventing an optimal design of the array. 

The increase of the monitored area in future studies using acoustic telemetry would 

allow increased habitat coverage and help to achieve longer term studies on the 

movements and activity patterns of fishes. In the particular case of cuttlefish, given 

their high mobility and migrations to the nearby estuary, it would also be interesting to 

monitor the Sado estuary. A larger array would also benefit acoustic telemetry studies 

on Senegalese sole because, even though some individuals presented high site fidelity, 

most were undetected for large periods of time. The fact that some of them eventually 

returned to the study area suggests that they may not displace far. Therefore, 



183 
 

increasing the size of the monitored area would, most probably, allow for longer 

periods of detection. 

Monitoring MPAs should be a continuous process in order to provide managers with 

information on the performance of MPAs and allow for adequate adaptive 

management actions. Hence, we propose that experimental fishing and visual census 

should be carried at least twice a year in order to properly evaluate the LSMP and to 

provide managers with information on its benefits. In the future, studies focusing on 

the fisheries of the adjacent areas should also be carried out in order to clarify the role 

of the LSMP as a fishery management tool. 

The poor enforcement observed in this particular MPA might turn the initial objectives 

of fisheries management and biodiversity management harder to reach. During the 

course of this study, infringements of the regulations were observed on several 

occasions. Among these were spearfishing, the use of octopus traps too close to the 

shore and the use of fishing nets and longlines in partial and no-take areas. Without 

enforcement and compliance, an MPA is just a paper park and no protection effects or 

benefits should be expected (Wood et al. 2008). Actual enforcement and compliance, 

and not the formal MPA establishment, must be considered as the true starting point 

of protection (Guidetti et al. 2008). 

Effective MPAs should include high-quality spawning and nursery habitats (Glazer &amp;amp; 

Delgado 2006). For the species on which this study focuses such habitats are mainly 

found in coastal lagoons and estuaries such as the nearby Sado estuary. Therefore, 

efforts should be put in place to ensure the quality and protection of these essential 

fish habitats. Ideally, migration corridors should be included between important 

juvenile and adult habitats such as the LSMP. This might implicate the identification of 

those habitats outside the MPA. If these migration paths are not protected, individuals 

may be susceptible to harvest when in transit or they may be unable to migrate into 

critical habitats (Simpson &amp;amp; Mapleston 2002). Given the location of the nearby Sado 

estuary, an area known to act as nursery/spawning area for several species, the 

establishment of protected corridors between these areas and the LSMP should be 

investigated. In addition, studies on the movements’ of earlier life stages (larvae, post-



184 
 

settlement) of the species would help to better understand their dispersion and the 

potential of the LSMP as source for seeding fished areas.

Range tests and detection efficiency 

 

In order to test the diel detection patterns we set an experiment prior to the release of 

any tagged animals. For this, we deployed three acoustic receivers and one acoustic 

transmitter. This experiment lasted for 25 days during which there was a large 

variation in sea state, rainfall and wind speed.  Daily rainfall and daily average wind 

speed based on forecast models were obtained from www.windguru.cz.  

 

 

Figure A.1. Number of daily detections, daily rainfall and average daily 
wind speed during the tag detection experiments. 

 

Results suggest that rainfall and especially wind speed have a great influence in the 

detection efficiency of the receivers. Other factors that may also influence the 

detection efficiency are the wave height and direction and wind direction however, 

these variables could not be accurately investigated.

Table A.1. Code detection efficiency and rejection coefficient of acoustic 
receivers placed at different distances from the acoustic transmitter. 

 

We determined two metrics of receiver performance, the code detection efficiency 

and the rejection coefficient. The results indicate that the detection efficiency 

decreases with the distance to the tag. The rejection coefficients obtained were low 

indicating that only a very small proportion of codes received were rejected.  

To test for differences between the number of detections during the day and during 

the night time we used data from 24h periods with similar wind, rainfall and sea state 

conditions throughout. The results of the t-test reveal no significant differences 

between day and night time detections (t-test = 1.112, DF=22; P=0.278).  

To evaluate the detection range of the acoustic tags we placed an acoustic transmitter 

at several known distances from the acoustic receivers for a period of one hour. We 

then estimated the percentage of the detections that were effectively detected by 

each receiver.
