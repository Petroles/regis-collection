Foreword 
 

This thesis is organized into two chapters. In the first chapter, the entire content 

of the experimental work is presented, while in the second chapter there is presented 

only the potentially publishable results. The entire thesis is written in English to 

facilitate that possible publication and the bibliography was made according to the 

criteria of Mutation Research, since it is a potential journal to publish this kind of 

results. 

It is important to note that to carry out part of the experimental work of this 

thesis, namely to determine acetylcholinesterase inhibition and to quantify 

manganese, it was necessary to establish a collaboration with Profª Doutora Ana 

Paula Marreilha dos Santos from Faculdade de Farmácia, Universidade de Lisboa.

Resumo 
 

A poluição ambiental induzida por substâncias químicas é considerada um 

grave problema a nível mundial e o uso generalizado de pesticidas é, talvez, o tipo 

de poluição química mais preocupante da actualidade, afectando todo o planeta, 

incluindo a saúde humana. A agricultura é uma importante actividade na economia 

de muitos países, mas é, ao mesmo tempo, a grande responsável pelo aumento do 

consumo de pesticidas a que temos vindo a assistir, ao longo dos tempos. Em 

Portugal, de acordo com o Eurostat, aproximadamente 17000 toneladas de 

pesticidas foram vendidos em 2008, contrastando com menos de 13000 toneladas 

vendidas em 1997. 

Pode considerar-se que os pesticidas são uma ferramenta económica, 

eficiente e racional no controlo de pragas pois, teoricamente, são desenvolvidos 

através de processos de regulamentação muito rígidos para que funcionem com 

segurança e mínimo impacto na saúde humana e no ambiente. No entanto, a 

maioria das vezes, os estudos publicados não estão em concordância com este 

facto e surgem, cada vez mais, preocupações relativamente aos riscos para saúde, 

decorrentes não só da exposição ocupacional aos pesticidas, mas também da 

exposição a resíduos destes químicos, presentes nos alimentos, que vão atingir toda 

a população. Consequentemente, nos últimos anos, procuram-se alternativas viáveis 

ao uso de pesticidas e a agricultura biológica pode ser uma opção a considerar. De 

facto, este tipo de agricultura não usa qualquer tipo de produto químico, sendo 

baseada na utilização de inimigos naturais para o combate de pragas. Todavia, esta 

prática é muito controversa, pois parece não ter ainda o potencial para responder a 

uma produção em massa, necessária para alimentar toda a humanidade. Assim, é 

essencial que se faça mais investigação nesta área de forma a entender as 

verdadeiras potencialidades, constrangimentos e limitações desta prática, que pode 

ser a chave para a resolução do grande problema do uso de pesticidas. 

O Mancozeb é um dos fungicidas mais usados a nível mundial, principalmente 

devido à sua baixa toxicidade aguda para os mamíferos e escassa permanência no 

meio ambiente. Apesar disto, o Mancozeb, principalmente através de um dos seus 

produtos de degradação, a etilenotiureia (ETU), tem efeitos toxicológicos ao nível da 

tiróide, sistema imunitário, reprodutivo e nervoso. Para além disto, o Mancozeb 

parece ter actividade mutagénica, teratogénica e ainda carcinogénica, tendo-se

verificado que induz uma variedade de tumores de diferentes origens em ratos, após 

uma exposição crónica. Há ainda a referir que o manganês (Mn), constituinte deste 

pesticida, também é um agente mutagénico comprovado, causando danos no 

material genético. Apesar de tudo isto, o Mancozeb está incluído na lista (Anexo I da 

directiva 91/414/EEC, 1991) de substâncias activas consideradas aceitáveis, tendo 

em conta o seu impacto no ambiente, saúde animal e humana, sendo o seu uso 

legalmente autorizado na formulação de pesticidas dentro da Comunidade Europeia. 

A avaliação ambiental da toxicidade dos pesticidas pode ser feita através da 

utilização de pequenos mamíferos roedores, que vivem nos campos, uma vez que 

estes são bons bioindicadores, acumulando um vasto espectro de poluentes 

presentes nos ecossistemas. Particularmente em relação aos pesticidas, existem já 

algumas correlações significativas entre exposição e a ocorrência de danos 

genéticos nestes animais. Por outro lado, estes animais têm a vantagem de ter 

grandes semelhanças genéticas e fisiológicas com os humanos, permitindo a 

extrapolação dos efeitos dos pesticidas. 

Assim, o principal objectivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a toxicidade dos 

pesticidas, in situ, comparando o estado de saúde de duas espécies de roedores 

(Mus spretus e Apodemus sylvaticus), provenientes de uma zona de agricultura 

convencional em contraste com os de uma zona de agricultura biológica. Para isto, 

foi necessária a colaboração dos agricultores em causa, que se mostraram sempre 

disponíveis, e forneceram toda a informação necessária. Assim, o agricultor 

responsável pelo campo de agricultura biológica garantiu que não eram usados 

quaisquer tipos de substâncias químicas, tratando-se de uma zona que sofreu 

conversão há cerca de 5 anos. Da agricultura convencional foi fornecida uma lista de 

pesticidas usados, onde os insecticidas organofosforados, carbamatos, juntamente 

com alguns EDBCs eram os principais grupos químicos de pesticidas usados. Para 

além disto, o agricultor da zona convencional informou que mais de 50% das 

aplicações eram baseadas num fungicida EDBC, o Mancozeb, sendo então este o 

pesticida maioritariamente aplicado. 

Depois de capturados e sacrificados, os animais foram avaliados do ponto de 

vista morfofisiológico, através das medidas biométricas, peso relativo dos órgãos 

internos e parâmetros hematológicos. Foram ainda sujeitos a três testes de forma a 

avaliar os danos ao nível do material genético: ensaio do cometa nos linfócitos, teste 

dos micronúcleos na medula óssea e teste das anomalias nos espermatozóides.

Resumo v 

Para além disto, foi feita a determinação da actividade da acetilcolinesterase no 

cérebro, que é um biomarcador da exposição a insecticidas organofosforados e 

carbamatos, e a quantificação do manganês (Mn) no fígado, que pode servir para 

avaliar a exposição ao Mancozeb, uma vez que este metal entra na sua constituição. 

Foi, ainda, iniciada uma análise molecular no intuito de determinar polimorfismos do 

gene CYP1A1, que está envolvido no processo de desintoxicação de agentes 

xenobióticos, como os pesticidas. 

Como resultado, o presente estudo demonstrou claramente que a exposição a 

uma mistura de pesticidas, onde o Mancozeb representa mais de 50% dessa 

mistura, tem a capacidade de causar danos genéticos em pequenos mamíferos, 

avaliados pelos ensaios do cometa, micronúcleos e anomalias nos espermatozóides. 

Para além disto, de forma a provar que, de facto, o Mancozeb era o agente 

genotóxico em causa, foi feita a quantificação do manganês no fígado dos animais, 

através da técnica de Espectrofotometria de Absorção Atómica com Câmara de 

Grafite. Assim, concluiu-se que os animais de ambas as espécies da zona da 

agricultura convencional, expostos a pesticidas, com maiores níveis de danos 

genéticos, tinham também maiores níveis de Mn no fígado, comparativamente aos 

animais da zona de agricultura biológica. Ou seja, o Mancozeb, sendo a fonte destes 

níveis de Mn mais elevados, será o agente genotóxico em causa. 

Por outro lado, foi feita a avaliação da actividade do enzima 

acetilcolinesterase, no cérebro, para despistar possíveis efeitos de insecticidas 

organofosforados e carbamatos, que também podiam ser a causa das diferenças 

nos danos genéticos encontrados entre as duas zonas analisadas. No entanto, 

verificou-se que não havia diferenças significativas nos valores da actividade deste 

enzima, entre os animais das duas zonas, que pudessem justificar os valores 

superiores de danos genéticos encontrados na zona de agricultura convencional.  

Foi ainda feita uma análise morfofisiológica para verificar se os animais 

expostos aos pesticidas tinham esses parâmetros alterados, mas apenas os baços 

aumentados foram reveladores da infecção provocada pela exposição aos 

pesticidas. Por outro lado, foi feita uma análise genética preliminar, no intuito de 

encontrar polimorfismos no gene CYP1A1, mas não foi possível conclui-la e, 

futuramente, será necessário continuar esta abordagem molecular do estudo. 

Tendo em conta as diferentes sensibilidades das duas espécies 

bioindicadoras analisadas, este estudo mostra como é importante usar pelo menos

Resumo vi 

duas espécies simpátricas para detectar a presença de agentes genotóxicos e 

utilizar vários testes de avaliação dos danos genéticos, porque a variabilidade em 

espécies selvagens é bastante mais elevada relativamente a animais de laboratório. 

Por outro lado, verificou-se que, de facto, a quantificação do Mn, tem potencial para 

ser um biomarcador da exposição e este tipo de pesticidas, que têm metais na sua 

constituição. Este estudo fornece ainda valores de referência para os biomarcadores 

utilizados em estudos futuros e demonstra como M. spretus e Apodemus sylvaticus 

são duas espécies indicadas para serem usadas como bioindicadores de poluição 

provocada pelos pesticidas. 

Concluindo, o presente estudo demonstra que a prática agrícola convencional 

representa um maior risco genotóxico comparativamente à agricultura biológica e 

contribuiu para alertar acerca dos efeitos prejudiciais que advêm da exposição aos 

pesticidas a longo prazo, particularmente, da exposição ao Mancozeb, que é um 

pesticida de uso legalmente autorizado na Comunidade Europeia. Apesar de vários 

estudos indicarem uma elevada toxicidade do Mancozeb, este continuará a ser um 

dos pesticidas mais usados no mundo, devido á sua eficácia, baixo custo e baixa 

persistência no ambiente relativamente a outros pesticidas. Assim, grande parte da 

população vai continuar a ser exposta e a problemática dos seus efeitos a longo 

prazo continuará a existir, enquanto não forem feitos investimentos na descoberta de 

alternativas ao uso de pesticidas.

Abstract 
 

Pesticides are widely used for pest control in conventional agriculture, despite 

their negative impacts. Biological agriculture can represent a valuable option, 

avoiding the use of pesticides, but it does not appear to have the potential to respond 

to the mass production of food to feed humanity.   

Mancozeb is a widely used fungicide mainly because of its low acute toxicity in 

mammals and scarce persistence in the environment. However, it has been 

considered a multipotent carcinogen, mutagenic and possibly teratogenic in a long-

term exposure context.  

Small mammals can be used as bioindicators of environmental toxicity of 

pesticides, accumulating a wide spectrum of pollutants, and significant correlations 

between pesticides and genetic damage in free-living rodents have already been 

detected.  

The main aim of this study was the in situ assessment of pesticide toxicity, 

using two small mammals’ species (Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus) from a 

conventional agriculture (CA) versus a biological agriculture (BA) zone.  

It was found that exposure to a mixture of pesticide, where Mancozeb 

represents more than 50% of that mixture, has the ability to cause DNA damage in 

small mammals, assessed by comet, micronucleus and sperm abnormality assays. 

Moreover, both species from CA zone, exposed to pesticides, with greater genetic 

damage, have also greater levels of Manganese. Thus, considering that Mancozeb is 

the widely used pesticide in the CA zone, we can conclude that this pesticide will be 

the source of the highest levels of manganese found in small mammals and it is the 

genotoxic agent at issue. Moreover, acetylcholinesterase activity revealed that 

organophosphates and carbamates insecticides also applied are not involved in that 

genotoxic action.  

In conclusion, the present work contributes to alert about hazard effects 

resulting from pesticide exposure, particularly Mancozeb, a pesticide legally 

authorized for use in European community.

Chapter I 
1. General Introduction  
1.1. The Pesticide Problem 
 

The environmental pollution induced by the chemical substances is regarded 

as a serious problem. Particularly, the widespread use of pesticides is affecting the 

entire planet, including the human health [1-3]. 

 According to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), 

a pesticide is defined as any substance or mixture of substances intended for 

preventing, destroying or controlling any pest. This includes vectors of human or 

animal diseases, unwanted species of plants or animals that cause harm during the 

production, processing, storage, transport, or marketing of food, agricultural 

commodities, wood and wood products, or animal feedstuffs [4]. Given this broad 

definition, is not surprising that pesticides include a wide range of different 

substances that are commonly used for different proposes. 

It is recognized that World War II was responsible for the development of 

various pesticides that we employ at the present.  In fact, some pesticides currently 

in use were developed for application in warfare, like organophosphates used as 

nerve gases. After World War II,  this chemicals began to be used as pesticides in 

environmental spraying for mosquito eradication and in  agriculture even when their 

potential hazards were unknown [5]. 

However, during the 1960s and 1970s, it began to emerge some evidences 

that these chemicals could have harmful consequences. Epidemiologists in the 

United States of America noted a rise in the incidence of blood cancers and when 

plotted on a map, these cases were clearly clustered in agricultural areas. This 

increase in blood cancers incidence paralleled the increase in pesticide use, has led 

some epidemiologists to assume that there was a causal link [5] and, in 1962, with 

the first publication of the Rachel Carson’s revolutionary book, Silent Spring [6], it 

was started the slow process of raising political and public consciousness of the 

effects of pesticides in wildlife, humans and ecosystems. 

As a consequence of these first evidences of pesticides hazards, by the end of 

the 1960s, it was created the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

2 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction 

that was the first governmental agency taking action against pesticide usage. 

Subsequently, in 1972, United Nations began to recognize the risks posed to humans 

and to the environment by the increased usage of pesticides and decide to establish 

the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) which together with World 

Health Organization (WHO) and FAO promoted more sustainable agricultural 

practices  like integrated pest management [7]. Furthermore, all over the years, there 

have been other efforts and initiatives to improve regulation of international pesticide 

trade and an example is the creation and update of an International Code of Conduct 

on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides [8]. 

Nevertheless, the world has known a continuous growth of pesticide usage, 

not only in number of different chemicals used but also in quantities sprayed [9]. In 

the European Union there are more than 800  of synthetic pesticide products with 

multiple formulations [10] and the trend is an increase because mostly pests develop 

resistance  and, therefore, chemical companies continuously synthesize new ones. 

According to Eurostat, Statistical Office of the European Communities [11], roughly 

17000 tones of pesticides were sold in Portugal, in 2008, while in 1997 was less than 

13000 tones (Figure 1). Although sales declined after 2002, that trend has apparently 

reversed, with substantially increasing in 2007 and 2008.

organisms designed to control, they can be classified as insecticides, fungicides, 

herbicides, rodenticides, molluscacides, nematocides and others that belonging to 

different chemical groups. They are deliberately spread into the environment, both in 

urban and rural areas, for industrial, agricultural and public health purposes and, after 

application, residues may persist in the environment, contaminating soils and water, 

remain in the crops, enter the food chain, and finally they are ingested by humans 

with foodstuffs and water [9, 12]. 

About their persistence in the environment, pesticides can be classified as 

organochlorines, such as  DDT, that are considered persistent pesticides because 

they have long environmental half-lives,  being transported over long distances by 

global circulation [13] and tend to bioaccumulate in humans and other animals, [14, 

15]. On the other hand, contemporary pesticides, such as organophosphates, 

carbamates, triazines, and others have much shorter environmental half-lives [16] 

and tend not to bioaccumulate. Even so, humans are chronically exposed to many of 

these no persistent chemicals because they are widely used in agriculture in large 

quantities which enhance their hazardous effects. 

At the present time, agriculture is an important activity and source of economic 

income in several countries all over the world but, at the same time, it is largely 

responsible for the increased consumption of pesticides [17]. Indeed, pesticides used 

in agriculture are very important to reduce yield losses, maintain high product quality 

and sometimes improve the nutritional value of food and its safety. From this point of 

view, pesticides can be considered as an economic, labor-saving, and efficient tool of 

pest management [18]. In addition, pesticides are developed through very strict 

regulation processes to function with reasonable certainty and minimal impact on 

human health and the environment [8, 19, 20]. Even though the published results are 

not always in agreement with this and serious concerns have been raised about 

health risks resulting not only from occupational exposure to pesticides but also from 

pesticides residues on food and in drinking water for the general population [10]. 

Consequently, in the last years, additional efforts have been produced to 

reduce the use of pesticides and biological agriculture can represent a valuable 

option. In Europe, the biologically managed land area has continued to grow (Figure 

2) and almost 7.8 million hectares (1.9 percent of the agricultural land) were 

managed biologically by more than 210000 farms in 2007 [21].

This practice respects the normal functioning of ecosystems, avoiding the use 

of pesticides, and leads to food ‘‘free’’ of synthetic chemicals. It has grown so much 

in the last 20 years that it corresponds to the use of millions of hectares already [22]. 

Nevertheless, organic agriculture does not appear to have the potential to respond to 

the mass production of food to feed humanity [9] and it deserves wide 

experimentation to fully understand its potentialities, constraints and limitations [23]. 

Given the current problem of pesticide usage, an increase of pesticide legal 

actions, like regulations, directives, decisions and recommendations for the use of 

pesticides is very important but not sufficient. It is urgent to find and develop 

alternative and profitable agricultural practices, in order to minimize the consumption 

of pesticides, which represents a real global problem.

1.2. Pesticides Toxicity and Potential Health Effects 
 

As a consequence of the widespread use of pesticides, all people are 

inevitably exposed and concern is growing in the international community about the 

health effects consequences to this ubiquitous contamination [12]. 

WHO and EPA have already classified pesticides according to their potential 

health risks. According to these classifications (Table 1 and 2), pesticides are 

grouped based on their median lethal dose (LD50), which is the pesticide dose that is 

required to kill half of the tested animals when entering the body by oral or dermal 

way [24].

The oral LD50 is usually lower than the dermal LD50 because pesticides can 

enter to the bloodstream more easily through the stomach than through the skin [26]. 

Moreover, according to WHO classification, there are differences for liquid and solid 

pesticides. In fact, the toxicity of the liquid formulation is usually much higher than 

that of the respective solid formulation since it is more difficult for a solid to pass 

through the skin [27]. In addition, the acute inhalation lethal concentration (LC50), 



 
 
 

 
Tese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente 

6 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction 

which is the pesticide concentration required to kill half of the exposed tested 

animals, is also considered in EPA classification. Despite all the known risks of some 

of these pesticides, many of those catalogued as extremely hazardous and dangers 

are still being used in some regions of the planet. 

While data on the acute toxicity of many of pesticides is easily recognized, 

knowledge on their delayed effects is much more limited.  In particular, pesticide 

residues in vegetables and fruits continue to generate concern in the general 

population mainly about their potential long term adverse effects such as cancer. 

These long-term effects resulting from a regular intake of pesticide are hard to detect 

and quantify [10, 28].  

Efforts have been made to assess carcinogenicity of pesticides and the 

International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an international organization 

that is part of WHO, has already a classification based on evidences derived not only 

from experiments with animals but also from epidemiological studies in humans and 

other relevant studies where carcinogenicity of pesticides is tested [29]. Accordingly, 

a pesticide is classified in different groups as presented in Table 3. 
 

 
 

Table 3. Classification of Pesticides carcinogenicity according to IARC [29]. 
Group Classification 

1 Carcinogenic to humans 
2A Probably carcinogenic to humans - limited evidence of carcinogenicity in 

humans but sufficient evidence in test animals. 

2B Possibly carcinogenic to humans - limited evidence of carcinogenicity in 
humans and less than sufficient evidence in test animals. 

3 Not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans - inadequate evidence of 
carcinogenicity in humans and inadequate or limited evidence in test animals. 

4 Probably not carcinogenic to humans. 
 
 
 
 

EPA has a similar classification where the respective classes are carcinogenic 

to humans; likely to be carcinogenic to humans; suggestive evidence of carcinogenic 

potential; inadequate information to assess carcinogenic potential; and not likely to 

be carcinogenic to humans [30]. 

It is important to note that these classifications results mainly from 

toxicological studies on experimental animals and from epidemiological studies and 

not result from cause-control studies on humans. In addition, toxicological testing is 



 
 
 

 
Tese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente 

7 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction 

based on the administration of a single active ingredient, whereas human exposures 

are to a complex mixture of compounds.  So, these classifications should be 

interpreted with extra caution because they can be associated with high uncertainty 

in the estimation of the relevant human exposure pattern [31]. On the other hand, 

when there is lack of toxicity data for specific pesticides, this does not necessarily 

imply that they are not toxic. They may have not been evaluated yet or that relevant 

data are not available. In truth, we need to know much more about the environmental 

behavior of these chemicals and about their effect upon humans.  

It is essential to invest in research of pesticides effects and, in fact, there are 

hundreds of scientific studies done on all continents to determine if there is a 

relationship between pesticide use and human health problems [32-35]. These 

studies have reported associations between exposure to pesticides and various 

health outcomes including immunologic abnormalities [1, 36], adverse reproductive 

and developmental effects [37],  cancer [35, 38], and neurological diseases, such as 

Parkinson`s [39]  and Alzheimer’s diseases, where cholinesterase inhibition may play 

an important role [40, 41].  

DNA damage and oxidative stress have been proposed as mechanisms that 

could link pesticide exposures to these health outcomes [42] and may be involved in 

the pathogenesis of various diseases including cancer. In fact, exposure to a wide 

range of pesticides induces oxidative stress reflected as accumulation of reactive 

oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and DNA damage [43]. Mechanisms 

leading to these alterations in cellular redox homeostasis are only partially 

understood for certain pesticides but, in general, pesticides have been shown to alter 

cellular redox balance by their enzymatic conversion to secondary reactive products 

and/or ROS, by depletion of antioxidant defenses and by the impairment of 

antioxidant enzyme function [44, 45].  

Additionally, for environmental stressors, such as pesticides, ROS may serve 

as common mediators of programmed cell death (apoptosis) and pathological 

conditions [46]. In conditions of homeostasis, cell duplication is compensated by the 

cell death, but in pathological conditions there is a deregulation (excessive or 

deficient) cell death and homeostasis in not maintained. Apoptosis in one of this 

mechanisms of cell death that is highly regulated and  it is characterized by the 

progressive activation of precise pathways leading to specific biochemical and 

morphological alterations [47]. When induced by environmental toxicants, such as 



 
 
 

 
Tese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente 

8 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction 

pesticides, apoptosis is widely associated with alterations in redox homeostasis 

which include both the depletion of antioxidant defenses, like Glutathione (GSH) and 

the increase accumulation of reactive species (RS) of oxygen or nitrogen (Figure 3). 

This will originate a direct damage of the mitochondria or indirectly via activation of 

death receptor, endoplasmic reticulum stress and/or DNA damage [43, 46]. So, 

apoptosis can be the mechanism involved in pesticide-induced pathologies where 

cell death has a major role. 
 

 

 
 

 
Figure 23. Schematic representation of apoptosis induced by environmental stressors. 
Apoptosis can be induced by activating intrinsic pathways (mitochondria, DNA damage 
and/or endoplasmic reticulum stress) as well as by extrinsic pathways (activation/modulation 
of death receptors). When induced by environmental toxicants it is widely associated with 
alterations in redox homeostasis which include both the depletion of antioxidant defenses 
(such as GSH) and the increase accumulation of reactive species of oxygen or nitrogen. 
GSH-Glutathione; GSSG-Glutathione disulfide; RS-Reactive species [48]. 
 
 
 
 

 Furthermore, various experimental data have provided evidence that 

pesticides are potential chemical mutagens inducing gene mutation, chromosomal 

alteration and DNA damage [10].  These genotoxic effects are also considered 

serious of the possible side effects of pesticides because they may produce DNA 

breakage at sites of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, thus playing a role in the 

induction of malignancies in individuals exposed to these agents [49].

1.2.1. The Particular Case of Mancozeb 
 

Among the 25,000 types of pesticides available, more than 80% are 

organophosphates or carbamates. Analogs of these last ones, dithiocarbamates, 

where oxygen atoms are replaced by sulfur atoms, are widely used as fungicides to 

protect fruits, vegetables and field crops against a large spectrum of fungal diseases. 

Particularly, ethylenebisdithiocarbamates (EBDCs) which include Maneb, Zineb, and 

Mancozeb are  regularly used in agriculture [50]. 

Mancozeb (Figure 4), a greyish-yellow powder, is a polymeric complex of 

EBDC-Manganese with zinc salt (molecular weight of 265.3 + 65.4) and it is one of 

the most widely used commercial fungicides worldwide [51], mainly because of its 

low acute toxicity in mammals and scarce persistence in the environment [52]. It is 

not known to occur as a nature product and it is synthesized from carbamate radicals 

that have reacted with carbon disulfide to give dialkyldithiocarbamates. After that, it 

reacts to diamines originating dithiocarbamates, and, finally, with the addition of a 

zinc chloride, is produced Mancozeb [29, 53].  
 

 

 
Figure 24. Chemical structure of Mancozeb [51]. 

Mancozeb is used to control fungal diseases that afflict many important 

economic crops, including potato, tomato, fruits and flowers. It is a broad-spectrum 

pesticide that indiscriminately kills a range of organisms, targeted as well as 

untargeted (and beneficial) species. It is a contact fungicide (non systemic) that 

disrupts cell metabolism, namely lipid metabolism [54]. This synthetic fungicide has a 

short environmental resistance with low solubility in water and low soil persistence. It 

is hydrolyzed within 1 day in sterile water [53] and has a field half-life of 1 to 7 days. 

On the other hand, it has low volatility at standard temperatures and pressure but can 

be found associated with air-borne particulates or as spray drift. 



 
 
 

 
Tese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente 

10 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction 

Even though Mancozeb has been characterized as less acutely toxic and less 

persistent in the environment, one of its main degradation products resulting of a 

spontaneous breakdown, ethylenethiourea (ETU) shows a long persistence (5–10 

weeks) in soil and high water solubility. ETU is thought to be the source of most of 

the toxicity associated with EBDCs and consequently with Mancozeb [50]. Its 
residues are regularly detected in fruit and vegetables, and it has been shown that a 

significant percentage of ETU is produced during cooking of contaminated foods [55]. 

This compound has been reported to have carcinogen, teratogen and goitrogen 

effects [53, 56, 57].  

Although the risk of intoxication by EBDCs mainly concerns industrial and 

agricultural workers [58], the general population can be chronically exposed to 

dietary residues present of such pesticides in food. Mancozeb, despite its low acute 

toxicity, has been shown to produce significant toxicological effects on thyroid [58, 

59], immune system [60], reproductive system [61-64] and nervous system [65], 

Moreover, Mancozeb was considered a multipotent carcinogen, inducing a variety of 

tumors of different origin in rats after chronic exposure [66], mutagenic [67] and  

possibly teratogenic [68].  

The alkylation of DNA is a mechanism that could be invoked to explain the 

DNA damage induced by the EBDC pesticides [69]. On the other hand some studies 

demonstrate that Mancozeb may act as prooxidants inside the cell. This mechanism 

is based on the presence of coordinated transitional metals, like manganese and zinc 

present in the chemical structure of this pesticide that will catalyze the formation of 

ROS through the Fenton reaction, where metals have a strong catalytic power to 

generate highly reactive radicals [67, 70].  

Even though Mancozeb is considered to have a low acute toxicity in mammals 

(Class U in the WHO classification) [24]  and not listed about its carcinogenicity in 

IARC classification, it is crucial to give a little attention to their long-term effects not 

only from the harmful action of ETU but also from its metallic constituents.

1.3. Using Biomarkers to Assess Pesticides Toxicity 
 

The term biomarker is used to include almost any measurement reflecting an 

interaction between a biological system and an environmental agent, which may be 

chemical, physical, or biological [71]. In other words, biomarkers are indicators of 

events in biological systems that could clarify relationships between environmental 

hazards and health effects or disease process [72]. Therefore, biomarkers can be 

used to identify causal associations, making possible to recognize susceptible groups 

or individuals who are at risk of exposure to certain toxic agents [73].  

Biomarkers can be divided into three classes (Figure 5): biomarkers of 

susceptibility, that indicate an organism`s inherent or acquired limitations affecting its 

response to a toxic exposure; biomarkers of effect, that provide information on an 

preclinical event occurring at a target site  in consequence of exposure, correlated to 

manifestation of disease; and biomarkers of exposure, that integrate all routes of 

exposure to a particular contaminant [74, 75].  
 

 

 
Figure 25. Schematic representation of the different types of Biomarkers of a toxicant from 
exposure to induction of health effects. [75]. 
 

Additionally, biomarkers of exposure currently available for monitoring pesticide 

exposure can be divided into two main groups: internal dose and biologically effective 



 
 
 

 
Tese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente 

12 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction 

dose [74]. Internal dose means the measurement of chemical agents or their 

metabolites either in tissues, secreta, excreta or  exhaled air in order to evaluate 

exposure and health risk [76]. A biomarker of biologically effective dose measures 

the amount of a toxicant that has interacted with a target site and altered its 

physiological function. These biomarkers may be spontaneously repaired or may 

lead to the development of disease [75, 76]. 

The use of several biomarkers is recognized as an important approach for the 

assessment of pollution, as chemical analysis of environmental samples alone does 

not provide evidence of the impacts in organisms. Biomarkers to assess pesticides 

toxicity cover a wide range [28] but this study will focus only on some biomarkers of 

genotoxicity (Comet, Micronucleus and Sperm Abnormality assays), 

acetylcholinesterase inhibition, manganese quantification and one biomarker of 

susceptibility (CYP1A1). 
 

 

1.3.1. Biomarkers of Genotoxicity 
 

Biomarkers of genotoxicity provide measures of the alterations of important 

genetic targets, like chromosomes, chromatids or gene sequences where  the link 

between the measured parameter and the development of tumors is probably closer 

[77]. Examples are sister chromatid exchanges, micronuclei, comet assay and 

chromosome aberrations, that are often associated with higher cancer incidence [78]. 

For genotoxic chemicals, such as pesticides, techniques that measure DNA 

damage provide a powerful tool in measuring environmental effects and the most 

commonly used test for genetic damage is classical chromosome aberration analysis. 

However, an inexpensive and simpler test looks for micronuclei, whole or fragmented 

extra chromosomes resulting from abnormal mitosis. Some studies use, yet, newer 

tests to assess DNA damage, such as Sister Chromatid Exchange, Comet assay and 

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH),  assay [79]. Sperm abnormality assay is also 

regularly applied to get information on the transmission of genetic damages. The use 

of multiple tests is very useful because it provides more information about the 

different types of lesions in the genetic material, allowing for greater reliability of 

results.

13 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction 

1.3.1.1. Comet Assay 
 

The Comet assay or single-cell gel electrophoresis test is a useful technique for 

studying DNA damage and, during the last two decades, it has become a method of 

increasing popularity [80-82]. It has been accepted by the United Kingdom 
Committee on Mutagenicity testing of chemicals in food, consumer products, and 

environment as a test for assessing DNA damage [83]. 
 Ostling and Johanson (1984) were the first to use this assay to quantify DNA 

damage induced by radiation in cells. Their technique consisted of lysing cells with 

detergents and high salt, and subjecting the liberated DNA to electrophoresis under 

neutral conditions. Cells with an increased frequency of DNA double-strand breaks 
displayed increased migration of DNA toward the anode. The migrating DNA was, 

then, quantified by staining with ethidium bromide and by measuring the intensity of 

fluorescence using a microscope photometer. The amount of the DNA liberated from 

the head of the “comet” depends on the effect of the genotoxic agent [84]. 

However, the neutral conditions used by Ostling and Johanson greatly limited 

the general utility of the assay because it only detects double-strand breaks (DSB) 

[85]. Consequently, the assay was adapted under alkaline conditions by Singh et al. 

(1988), which led to a sensitive version of the assay because it could assess both 

double and single-strand DNA breaks (SSB) as well as the alkali labile sites (ALS) 

expressed as single-strand breaks [86]. 

The alkaline version of the Comet assay (Figure 6) is the methodology of 

choice. Generally, a cell suspension is embedded in agarose on a microscope slide 

and lysed by detergents and a high salt concentration in order to liberate the DNA. 

Afterwards, the slides are treated at alkaline conditions (pH&gt;13) to produce single 

stranded DNA and to express ALS as SSB. During electrophoresis at the same alkali 

condition, DNA fragments induced by genotoxic agents migrate to the anode side. 

Subsequently, the slides are washed with a neutralizing solution, where DNA strands 

separated by alkaline treatment in the comet head will readily renature due to their 

intact structure with supercoiled loops, while the DNA in tail will remain single-

stranded [81, 82]. Then, slides are stained with  and fluorescent DNA binding dyes 

and  when viewed under a microscope, a cell has the appearance of a comet, with a 

head (the nuclear region) and a tail containing DNA fragments [87].

Scoring of DNA damage can be performed by visual (manual) scoring or by 

using an automated software scoring system with an image capture device attached 

to the microscope, that will permit the measurement of parameters such as the 

percentage of DNA in the tail (% tail DNA), tail length and tail moment (fraction of 

migrated DNA multiplied by some measure of tail length). % tail DNA is considered a 

better parameter as this gives a clear indication of the appearance of the comets 

and, in addition, is linearly related to the DNA break frequency over a wide range of 

levels of damage. It represents a more sensitive measure of DNA damage because it 

continues to increase with increased DNA damage, while tail length may not [89-93].  

The Comet assay possesses a number of advantages as compared to other 

genotoxicity tests. It is sensitive for detecting low levels of DNA damage, applicable 

to various tissues and/or special cell types, flexible to use proliferating as well as non 

proliferating cells, require for only small numbers of cells per sample, easy of 

application, low cost, and one short time needed to perform the assay [85]. This is a 

non-invasive technique compared to other DNA damage techniques, such as  

chromosomal aberrations or micronucleus assay in the bone marrow, which require a 

larger sample as well as proliferating cell population [81]. In addition, this assay can 

be used to evaluate various types of DNA damage and is readily modifiable for 



 
 
 

 
Tese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente 

15 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction 

adaptation to a variety of experimental requirements [85]. DNA damage assessed by 

the Comet assay gives an indication of recent exposure and at an early stage where 

it could also undergo repair without resulting in permanent genetic alteration [94]. 

Thus, it provides an opportunity for intervention strategies to be implemented timely 

[83]. 

A limitation of the Comet assay is that aneugenic effects, which may be a 

possible mechanism for carcinogenicity and epigenetic mechanisms of DNA damage 

such as effects on cell-cycle checkpoints, are not detected. On the other hand, 

neither the extent of DNA migration in the comet assay nor the shape of the comet 

can reveal the mode of action of the mutagenic potential of a test substance and it 

has technical variability and interpretation [95]. However, the advantages far 

outnumber the disadvantages, and hence, it has been widely used in fields ranging 

from molecular epidemiology to genetic toxicology [83].  
 
 

1.3.1.2. Micronucleus Assay 
 

 

The Micronucleus (MN) assay applied to erythrocyte cells has been usually 

used as a simple and sensitive method for determining the genotoxicity of chemical 

substances [96, 97]. It is extensively used as a biomarker of chromosomal damage, 

genome instability, and eventually of cancer risk [98]. This assay is based on the 

detection of small nuclei (micronuclei) formed during the metaphase-anaphase 

transition of cell division. It may be a chromosome (aneugenic phenomenon leading 

to loss of chromosome) or an acentric chromosome fragment (clastogenic 

phenomenon)  that stood out of a chromosome after breakage [99].  

 In greater detail, in process of erythropoiesis, proliferating stem cells start to 

divide at which time a genotoxic agent may cause chromosome damage, such as 

breaks and exchanges. In addition, the genotoxic agent may also acts on 

macromolecules related to the function of chromatid disjunction, such as tubulin, 

causing spindle dysfunction (Figure 7). Consequently, a fragment or a whole 

chromosome may lag behind in the cell during division and may not become 

integrated into daughter nuclei, forming MN in the cytoplasm.

Afterwards, during maturation in the process of erythropoiesis, the erythroblast 

develops into a polychromatic erythrocyte (PCE) that is a young erythrocyte still 

contains RNA, and the main nucleus is extruded. Therefore, if any MN has been 

formed during proliferation, it will remain in the enucleated cytoplasm and its 

visualization is facilitated because PCEs lack a main nucleus. PCEs, with time, lose 

RNA and develop into a normochromatic erythrocytes (NCEs), that are mature 

erythrocytes and they may also contain MN [97]. 

Traditionally, MN are identified using Giemsa staining method [99] but Hayashi 

et al. (1990) introduced a  new method using acridine orange (AO) to improve the 

identification of immature erythrocytes [100]. PCEs are identified by red fluorescing 

reticulum in the cytoplasm, and MN fluoresce greenish yellow while NCEs fluoresce 

as pale green. AO staining method is more useful and gives more reliable results 

than the usual Giemsa because both PCEs and  MN can be easily distinguished from 

NCEs [96]. 

 MN represents an integrated response to chromosome-instability phenotypes 

and altered cellular viabilities caused by genetic defects and/or exogenous 

exposures to genotoxic agents. As a result, an increase in the frequency of MN is an 

indication of induced chromosome damage. Moreover, the PCE/NCE ratio between 

test agent-treated animals and vehicle-control animals provides a cytotoxicity index 

because a decrease in this ratio would indicate destruction of immature erythrocytes 

[97].

This assay has several important advantages over the analysis of bone-

marrow metaphase analysis often used. It is technically simple, the endpoint scored 

is more objective and amenable for automation, it is less time consuming and it can 

be easily integrated into general toxicology studies [97].  This assay can be also 

applied to peripheral blood or other tissues or organs and it is a promising assay 

system, especially when used with FISH. With FISH, the presence of centromeres in 

MN can be clearly detected, and the ability to detect differences between MN 

induced by clastogens or by spindle poisons became possible [101, 102].  

 

1.3.1.3. Sperm Abnormality Assay 
 

 

There are several studies showing that pesticides have a direct effect on 

reproductive health, particularly in the formation of sperm cells [103-108]. The widely  

and first publicized report about these adverse effects was the case of pesticide 

dibromochloropropane (DBCP), in 1977, when Whorton et al. observed that male 

workers of a DBCP-producing factory in California in the United States became 

infertile after being exposed [109]. 

The DBCP story served to alert people about the potential for pesticides in to 

alter reproductive function in men. It also provided the rationale for adding direct 

evaluations of sperm production and quality to reproductive toxicology test protocols 

in which the rat is the preferred test species. The inclusion of measures of rat sperm 

quality, such as motility and morphology, into reproductive test protocols often 

increases the sensitivity of the test to detect effects [110]. 

Particularly, about morphological analysis, sperm abnormality assay is a 

sensitive and reliable endpoint and is widely used to identify germ cell mutagens 

[111, 112]. This biomarker is advantageous because the reproducibility of the results 

and, overall the possibility to get information on the transmission of genetic damages 

in successive generations. According to Wyrobek and Bruce [1975], the classification 

of anomalies of the sperm is based on changes in the head and tail that is shown in 

Figure 8 [113].

Characteristics controlling sperm head shape are carried on the autosomes 

and it is not clear what mechanism origins these morphological changes. However, 

induction of abnormal sperms is presumed to be a result of naturally occurring errors 

in the differentiation process, or the consequence of an abnormal chromosome 

complement. In accordance to some authors the alterations in sperm  can, in fact,  

occur as a consequence of DNA mutations and  additionally by endocrine 

dysfunction [114-117].

1.3.2. Acetylcholinesterase Inhibition  
 

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity is widely used as a specific biomarker of 

organophosphorus (OPs) and carbamate insecticides that are commonly used in 

agriculture [118]. These anticholinesterase pesticides have the ability to inhibit AChE 

activity that is an enzyme   responsible for modulating neural communication in the 

synaptic cleft by hydrolyzing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. OPs and carbamates 

lead to a phosphorilation and carbamylation of the serine residue at AChE catalytic 

site, respectively. In that conditions, enzyme is highly stable and the hydrolysis of 

acetylcholine is blocked [119].The neurotransmitter accumulates in the synaptic cleft 

which originates the continuous stimulation of cholinergic fibers throughout the 

nervous systems. Depending on the degree of inhibition, cholinergic stimulation may 

lead to hyperactivity of excitable tissues, causing convulsions, severe muscle 

paralysis, hypersecretion from secretory glands, respiratory failure, coma and even 

death. The enzyme can be restored to its active state but in some cases, depending 

on the chemical structure of the pesticide, the inhibition may be irreversible [119, 

120]. The Food and Agriculture Organization recommends that 20% inhibition is the 

relevant end-point to determine acceptable daily intakes of an anticholinesterasic 

compound [121]. 

Beyond this principal AChE involved in nerve impulse transmission, there are 

AChEs present in the outer membrane of erythrocytes and pseudocholinesterases 

present in blood plasma, liver and muscle tissues but their physiological function are 

unknown and it has a different substrate. Pseudocholinesterases are often inhibited 

more effectively by OPs and carbamates but their inhibition has no relation to that 

occurring in either erythrocytes or brain [122, 123]. The AChE activity in the brain is 

closely correlated with that measured in erythrocytes and to a lesser extent with 

pseudocholinesterase activity in the others tissues [76]. Notwithstanding, it is difficult 

to know how closely AChE inhibition in erythrocytes reflects that in the nervous 

system. Since access to blood is always easier than access to the brain, the 

inhibition of erythrocyte AChE is very useful as biomarker of exposure to pesticides 

and it usually overestimates AChE in the brain [123]. 

There are strong associations between exposures to pesticides and AChE 

inhibition symptoms. In accordance to some authors AChE is, in fact, significantly 

reduced in exposed populations [124-126].

20 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction 

Undoubtedly, the most widely used assay to detect AChE inhibition is the 

Ellman´s method. This method is extremely sensitive and is applicable to either small 

amounts of tissue and to low concentrations of enzyme [127].  This method is based 

on coupling of reactions presented in Figure 9: 
 
 

 

 

 
Figure 29. Principle of the Ellman´s method. AChE- acetylcholinesterase; DTNB-
dithiobisnitrobenzoate ion; TNB- 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate anion (adapted from[127]). 

 
 

 

 

Therefore, the enzyme activity is measured by the increase of yellow -5-thio-2-

nitrobenzoate anion (TNB) produced from the reaction of thiocholine with 

dithiobisnitrobenzoate ion (DTNB). Yellow TNB is quantified at 412 nm using a 

spectrophotometer. 

The main advantages of the Ellman´s method are simplicity, accuracy, a 

continuous increase in color density as a function of incubation time, and relatively 

low cost. It is easily adaptable for automated analyzers or plate readers for the rapid 

processing of large numbers of samples [127].

1.3.3. Manganese Quantification as a Mancozeb Biomarker 
 

Manganese (Mn) is an essential element that is required for growth, 

development, and maintenance of health. Within its multiple functions, it is a 

component and an activator of multiple important enzymes, like pyruvate 

carboxylase, superoxide dismutase or alkaline phosphatase and it is required for the 

formation of healthy cartilage and bone. Moreover, Mn is essential in the 

maintenance of mitochondria, production of glucose and in the urea cycle. It also 

plays a key role in wound-healing [128]. 

Mn is the 12th most abundant element in the Earth’s crust and constituting 

about 0.1% of it. Pure Mn is a silver-colored metal but it does not occur as a free 

metal.  Instead, it is found combined with oxygen, sulfur, and chlorine in more than 

100 minerals and is one of the most used metals in the industry with a wide range of 

applications. Magnetic resonance imaging, antiknock agent and fungicides 

formulations are the most recent applications of this metal. Particularly, Mn enters in 

the constitution of Mancozeb, a fungicide extremely used in agriculture, at the 

present time [128]. 

The general population is exposed to Mn through consumption of food and 

water, inhalation of air, and dermal contact with air, water, soil, and consumer 

products that contain Mn. The primary source of Mn intake is through diet and Mn is 

naturally present in food and in drinking water at low levels. Daily intakes of Mn range 

from 2-9 mg/day  depending on nutritional habits and only 3-5% is absorbed from the 

gastrointestinal tract [128]. However it is considered that the diet of most people in 

developed countries contains sufficient manganese [129]. The oxidation states of 

manganese range from 0 to +7 but the most stable valence is +2 and this is the state 

of Mn absorved from the gastrointestinal tract like tetravalent state [130]. This low 

gastrointestinal absorption together with a rapid elimination  limit the toxicity of the 

Mn [130].  

Despite its essentiality, possible involvement of high levels of Mn compounds 

in causing hazard effects on human health has been alert public to its utilization. On 

the other hand, Mn plays an important role in antioxidant defenses and forms part of 

a superoxide dismutase which often is characteristically modified in cancer cells. So, 

there is needed to consider the balance between essentiality and toxicity, when 

conduct of risk assessments for an essential element such as Mn [129].

22 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction 

It is consensual that chronic exposure to high levels of Mn is associated with 

adverse outcomes. John Couper, in 1837, was the first to report these Mn effects, 

when he described muscle weakness, limb tremor, whispering speech, salivation, 

and a bent posture in five men working in a Mn ore crushing plant in France [131]. 

This is the first description of manganism symptoms, a permanent neurological 

disorder caused by continued exposure to high levels of Mn. In fact, Mn has been 

shown to cross the blood-brain barrier, enters in  the nervous system that is the 

primary target organ, originating behavioral changes and movements that may 

become slow and clumsy [130, 132, 133].  

Despite the mechanism of toxicity of Mn is poorly understood, several studies 

indicate that oxidative stress and mitochondria play major roles in the Mn-induced 

neurodegenerative diseases [134, 135]. Moreover, there are some evidences that 

Manganese interferes with various mechanisms in nervous system, particularly in 

AChE activity. About interference of Mn in AChE activity, there have been conflicting 

reports regarding the effects of manganese treatment in developing rats. There are 

studies that indicate a significant inhibition AChE activity observed following lengthy 

periods of exposure to manganese [136]. On the other hand, Liapi et al (2008) 

suggests that short-term Mn administration causes a statistically significant increase 

in AChE activity in rats [137].  

Mn appears to exert different effects on AChE activity in different stages of the 

life cycle. As a result, AChE activity is unaffected by manganese during development, 

but increased in a long-term exposure to manganese throughout development until 

adulthood. During aging, the physiological decrease in AChE activity is abolished by 

manganese [136, 138-141]. 

Effects of Mn at neurological level [142] are, in fact, the most investigated but 

Mn have also another target organs in respiratory, reproductive, endocrine and 

hematological systems [142-144]. Furthermore,  a limited amount of manganese is 

also able to cross the placenta during pregnancy, thus potentiate its teratogenic 

action [128]. Information on cancer due to Mn is scanty but the results available do 

not indicate that Mn is carcinogenic. However, Mn is a proven mutagen, causing 

DNA damage and chromosome aberrations [129]. 

As previous mentioned, Mn enters on Mancozeb formulation. So, 

quantification of this metal in urine or in the organism can be used as a biomarker of 

exposure to Mancozeb. The most common analytical procedures for measuring Mn

23 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction 

levels in biological and environmental samples are the methods of Atomic Absorption 

Spectroscopy (AAS). Particularly, the Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption 

Spectrometry (GFAAS) analysis is often used for very low analyte levels and for the 

analysis of solid samples [145]. In this method, the sample is aspirated into a 

graphite furnace until the element atomizes. Then, the ground-state atomic vapor 

absorbs monochromatic radiation from a source and a photoelectric detector 

measures the intensity of radiation absorbed. It is important to refer that this 

methodology requires acidic digestion of the organic matrix in the biological materials 

prior to analysis and that special care is needed to avoid contamination of biological 

materials with exogenous Mn, especially for samples with low levels of Mn [128, 146].

1.3.4. CYP1A1 as a genetic marker of Susceptibility 
 

Genetic polymorphism is a difference in DNA sequence among individuals, 

groups or populations that may have been induced by external agents. The simplest 

form and the most common source of genetic polymorphism in the human genome is 

Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP). SNP is a single base mutation in DNA and is 

present at about 1 per 1,000 nucleotides in humans [147]. These polymorphisms can 

change the level of expression of a gene or change the activity of a gene product 

[148] which can be used a genetic marker of susceptibility when associated with an 

increased risk of develop certain diseases. 

Through the recent advances in molecular biology, these genetic markers of 

susceptibility have been developing and now they play a key role in environmentally 

induced diseases. Individual inheritance of variant polymorphic genes involved in the 

metabolism of chemical compounds, such as pesticides, can be good markers of 

susceptibility because they allow to understanding the relationships between 

exposure to these toxic chemicals and the development of chronic diseases [32]. In 

more detail,  genotypes responsible for inter individual differences in the ability to 

activate or detoxify pesticides will influence the genotoxic damage caused by this 

pesticides [73]. So, through the ability to sequence DNA and find individual 

genotypes, it is possible to discover the relationship between exposure and disease 

development according to genotype information. In case of humans, this is very 

useful because that information could be coupled with medical information to 

diagnose disease onset and to develop strategies of treatment [28].  

As human population is biologically diverse and genetically heterogeneous, it 

is not surprising that differences in susceptibility to disease among individuals with or 

without exposure to environmental chemicals exist and many genetic conditions 

associated with enhanced susceptibility to environmental chemicals remain to be 

discovered [149]. There has been a great investment in this area and various genetic 

polymorphisms of enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics have been 

examined. As a result, some studies have reported an association between 

polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes involved in human xenobiotics 

metabolism and susceptibility to cancer [150] . 

Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) are a superfamily of 57 genes that encode 

enzymes involved in the typical activation reaction which converts indirect 



 
 
 

 
Tese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente 

25 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction 

carcinogens to active electrophiles capable of interacting with the biological 

macromolecules DNA, RNA and proteins [77, 151]. Particularly, the family of genes 

CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 codify three enzymes, respectively, that detoxify or 

activate many procarcinogens, environmental toxins and some 

drugs. The activity of CYP1A1 is induced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 

(PAHs), such as those found in cigarette smoke, diet and pollutants relapsed from 

the combustion of fossil fuels. Its gene product is a hydroxylase which catalyzes the 

first step of the metabolism of PAHs to electrophilic compounds.  These enzymes are 

membrane associated proteins located in either the inner membranes of 

mitochondria and in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells, where they metabolize 

thousands of endogenous and exogenous compounds. The expression of 

CYP1A1 is mainly extrahepatic. [152]. Many enzymatic isoforms of this enzyme have 

been suggested to contribute to individual cancer susceptibility as genetic modifiers 

of cancer risk after exposure to genotoxic agents [153, 154]. Moreover, some genetic 

polymorphisms of CYP1A1 gene have been associated with an elevated risk of lung, 

colorectal and breast cancer [155-157].  

The role of specific polymorphisms of CYP genes, involved in the activation 

and detoxification of xenobiotics, in modulating cytogenetic effects have been studied 

in pesticide-exposed populations [153, 154, 158]. Even though, the available data on 

farmer populations suggest that individuals with unfavorable metabolizing alleles are 

more susceptible to genotoxic effects than those with favorable alleles, but there are 

no conclusive findings on whether metabolic polymorphisms affect the chromosomal 

damage induced by pesticides.

1.4. Using Small Mammals as Bioindicators 
 

The term bioindicator has been applied to living organisms whose 

characteristics are used to reveal the presence or absence of environmental 

conditions [159]. Thus, a bioindicator permits to evaluate a modification, usually a 

deterioration of the environmental quality and some wild species can carry out this 

purpose, being predictors of ecotoxicological consequences when contaminants are 

introduced in the environment [160].  

Consequently, if animals living in polluted environments, like small mammals, 

accumulate toxicants  with effects for their health, they can be used as bioindicators 

of that environmental pollution [161]. For example, morphological measures such as 

body and internal organs masses are commonly used to assess their health status 

[162, 163]. Moreover, the assessment of their hematological parameters also 

provides important information on their health and physiological status. Several 

studies have reported alterations of these measurements in small mammals when 

exposed to certain pollutants [162, 164]. Small mammals are able to accumulate a 

wide spectrum of pollutants which are present in the ecosystem [161] and, 

particularly, some significant correlations between pesticides and genetic damage in 

free-living rodents have been detected [165].  

There are a lot of arguments for the use of small mammals in pollution 

biomonitoring and hazard assessment.  They are often considered to represent an 

intermediate stage between low and high trophic levels, since they feed on herbs, 

fruits and invertebrates, and they constitute important items in the diet of carnivorous 

animals. Moreover, they participate actively in soil bioturbation and, despite their 

small body size, they have a high metabolic rate, being their degree of exposure 

greater than in large mammals, which have a slower metabolic rate [166-168].  

On the other hand, the use of small mammals, mostly rodents in this type of 

work is very important because they have enough genetic and physiological 

similarities with humans and, therefore, it allows extrapolating the effect of these 

pollutants. Many rodent carcinogens are also human carcinogens, and hence, this 

model not only provides an insight into the genotoxicity of human carcinogens but 

also is suited for studying their underlying mechanisms. 

The wild small mammal species, Algerian mouse (Mus spretus Lataste, 1883) 

and wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus, Linnaeus, 1758) were chosen in this study

27 Chapter I: 1.General Introduction 

as pesticide pollution bioindicators. These species have been widely used as a 

bioindicators in some environmental studies [160,162, 169-171]. 

Algerian mouse belongs to the family Muridae and it is a rodent species that 

inhabits the occidental portion of Mediterranean Europe and North Africa. They 

occupy sub-humid and semi-arid habitats, typically Mediterranean, and have an 

herbivore diet composed with seeds, leaves, stalks and fruits. Wood mouse also 

belongs to the family Muridae and it inhabits Europe and North Africa. They consume 

seeds, fruits, insect larvae, earthworms, or plant material depending on local and 

seasonal abundance [172, 173].  

  
Figure 30. A- Apodemus sylvaticus [174]; B- Mus spretus [175]. 

 

These two species meet the criteria of good bioindicators because they are 

abundant and are easily caught; they contact with soil during their entire life cycle, 

being exposed to pesticides mainly by ingestion of contaminated food or soil as well 

through dermal absorption; their populations are usually large enough to support 

individuals collection without a major adverse effect at a population and they also are 

quite accessible for both population investigation and experimental research [176].

1.5. Thesis Context and Objectives 
 

 

The widespread use of pesticides in agriculture represents a threat not only to 

the environment but also to human populations exposed to them. Conventional 

agriculture practices are largely responsible for the increased consumption of 

pesticides worldwide and, in Portugal, this consumption also have been increased. 

As a consequence,  investments  have been made  in biological agriculture, 

without the use  of pesticides,  but this practice is still very restricted. Therefore, 

human exposure to pesticides continues to be inevitably and it is important to be alert 

in relation to their possible hazard effects. 

The main aim of the present thesis is the in situ assessment of pesticides 

toxicity, using biomarkers to compare the health state of two small mammal species 

(Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus) from conventional agriculture (CA) versus 

biological agriculture (BA) zone. Specific objectives of this thesis include:  

1. to investigate the potential genotoxic effects of pesticides on small mammals, 

using Micronucleus, Comet and Sperm Abnormality assays as biomarkers;  

2. to assess morphologic and physiologic conditions of both species;  

3. to appraise the adequacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibition as a biomarker of 

exposure to organophosphates and carbamates;  

4. to investigate the adequacy of manganese quantification as a biomarker of 

exposure to Mancozeb, the principal pesticide used in  the studied CA zone; 

5. to perform preliminary genotype analysis to try establish more frequent profiles 

for CYP1A1 polymorphism gene that are involved in the activation and 

detoxification of xenobiotics like pesticides; 

6. to appraise the adequacy of those biomarkers adopted;  

7. to compare the two different species of small mammals from the two different 

zones to verify which one is the best bioindicator of pesticide exposure; 

8. to evaluate the potential environmental risk upon wildlife as well as the likely 

impact on human health;

2.1. Sampling and Animals Capture 
 

This study was carried out in an agricultural zone of Alcobaça, district of Leiria, 

Portugal (Figure 11). In this region, agriculture is still an important economic activity 

with a wide area under agricultural practice. 
 

 
Figure 31. Geographic location of agricultural zones in study (adapted from [177]). 
 

It was considered that conventional and biological agriculture zones (Figure 12) 

are both insert in the same biotope (?1km of distance between them) and it was 

presumed that pesticide use is the main external factor that distinguishes them. The 

biological agriculture zone is correctly isolated from adjacent agriculture zones, so it 

is expected that it cannot be affected by adjacent pesticides applications. 

Before animals capture, the agreement and the cooperation of the farmers 

involved were required and they were asked about pesticides and others chemical 

products that were used in the fields. While in biological agriculture (BA) zone, the 

owner farmer ensured that there were not used any type of chemical products, being

an agricultural practice based on the use of natural enemies for the pest control that 

was converted about 5 years ago, in conventional agriculture (CA) zone, the owner 

farmer provided a list of pesticides used, where OPs, carbamates insecticides and 

EBDCs were the most representative groups. Moreover, CA farmer ensure that more 

than 50% of the applications were based on one EBDC: Mancozeb. Thus, Mancozeb 

is the most used pesticide in the CA zone.

Approximately 60 small mammals of both sexes were captured between 

December 2010 and February 2011 in both zones (Figure 12). All the animals were 

treated according to the Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the 

Council of 22 September 2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific 

purposes [178]. Small mammals were captured with Sherman traps using a mixture 

of canned sardine, flour and oil as bait. Cotton was also placed inside each trap to 

minimize lower temperatures that were felt during the night. Pregnant or lactant 

females were discharged as well as animals with less than 10g of weight. Mice were 

housed in individual plastic cages until reach the laboratory with ad libitum access to 

food and water.

2.2. Animals Sacrifice and Morphophisiological 
Analysis 
 

Small mammals were anesthetized and weighed before sacrifice and then 

general measurements were made (body size, tail size, left paw size, left ear size).  

Cardiac puncture was done for blood collection, using a syringe with heparin 

to prevent coagulation and during dissection, organs were removed (liver, heart, 

kidneys, spleen, testis, femurs and brain) and weighed. Liver, heart, kidneys, spleen 

and brain were stored on cold (-70 ºC) for subsequent analysis. 

Moreover, hematological parameters were taken from animal’s blood using 

Beckman Coulter Act Diff Hematology Analyzer that measures the following 

parameters: WBC (white blood cells; x103/µL), RBC (red blood cells; x106/µL), Hgb 

(hemoglobin; g/dL), Hct (hematocrit; %), MCV (mean corpuscular volume; fL), MCH 

(mean corpuscular hemoglobin; pg) and MCHC (mean corpuscular hemoglobin 

concentration; g/dL). 
 

2.3. Biomarkers of Genotoxicity  

2.3.1. Comet Assay 
 

The comet assay was performed as described by Singh et al. [86] with minor 

modifications. An aliquot of 15 µL of the blood samples collected by cardiac puncture 
was mixed with 300 µl 0.8% low-melting point agarose (37ºC) and then placed on a 

slide precoated with 1% normal-melting-point agarose. Immediately after that, the 

slide was covered with a coverslip and was then kept for 5 minutes on ice to solidify. 

After gently removing the coverslip, subsequent to solidification, slide was immersed 

in a cold lysing solution (2.5M NaCl, 0.1M EDTA, 10mM Tris, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 

and 10% (v/v) DMSO) at 4ºC over night. After lysis, the slide was placed in a 

horizontal electrophoresis box. The box was filled with fresh electrophoresis solution 

(1 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaOH, pH?13) and the slide was left in this solution for 40 min 

to allow unwinding. Electrophoresis was performed using the same solution at 25 V 

and 300 mA for 30 min. After that, the slide was gently neutralized with 0.4 M Tris 

buffer at pH 7.5 three times and then stained with SYBR Safe 4µL/mL. All steps 

described were performed under dark conditions to minimize additional ultraviolet 

induced DNA damage.

32 Chapter I: 2.Material and Methods 

The slides were examined, and comet images were captured using a 

fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX41). Approximately 200 randomly selected 

cells were analyzed at 400x magnification per each animal. Extent of DNA migration 

was determined using a computerized image analysis system (Comet Score TM - 

TriTek Corp).  
 

 

2.3.2. Micronucleus Assay 
 

 

 At the time of sacrifice, bone-marrow cells from both femurs of each animal 

were flushed with foetal calf serum, for the estimation of the frequency of 

micronucleated PCEs, according to Schmid [99]. The obtained cell suspension was 

centrifuged (800rpm, 5 min), the supernatant was removed and the pellet re-

suspended in foetal calf serum. Then, a drop of the suspension was smeared on a 

clean slide, air-dried, fixed in methanol for 10 minutes and stained with AO for 

fluorescent microscopic examination (Olympus BX41, equipped with blue excitation 

and 515-530 nm barrier filter) with a magnification of 400×. The frequency of MN in 

1000 PCE per mouse (coded slides) was scored. The acridine orange (0.24mM in 

Sorensen Buffer pH=6.8) used was prepared from a stock solution 0.1% AO 

according to Krishna and Hayashi (2000) [97]. 

 

2.3.3. Sperm Abnormality Assay 
 

The testis of the mice was dissected out, placed in 1 mL of Sorensen buffer (pH 

7.0) and gently centrifuged (800rpm, 10 min) to obtain a pellet of undamaged cells. 

After removal of the supernatant, the pellet was re-suspended in 1 mL of Sorensen 

buffer. A drop of the suspension was placed on a clean slide and a smear is made, 

air-dried and fixed in absolute methanol for 10 min. After drying overnight the slides 

were stained with 10% Giemsa for 1 h [179] and observed under the microscope with 

a magnification of 100×. According to Wyrobek and Bruce [113], 1000 sperm per 

animal were assessed for morphological abnormalities, which included without hook, 

banana shape, amorphous, folded on themselves and two tails.

2.4. Determination of Brain Acetylcholinesterase 
Activity 
 

The brain acetylcholinesterase activity was measured spectrophotometrically 

according to Ellman et al. (1961) [180] in 10 Mus spretus and 10 Apodemus 

sylvaticus randomly selected from both zones (5 from CA zone and 5 from BA zone). 

Before enzyme reaction, 50 mg of each freeze-thawed brain sample were 

homogenized in 0.9 mL of 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 0.1mL of 

Triton X-100 5% (v/v), using a Potter homogenizer.  

Then, for the enzymatic assay, 25 µL of the homogenized brain were added to 

the reaction mixture contained 50µL of DTNB (3.96mg/mL) and 1375 µL of 0.1M 

sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Subsequently, 50 µL of acetylthiocholine iodide 

(ACT) (9.248mg/ml) were added and the mixture was vortex for a few seconds. With 

the addition of ACT, the enzymatic reaction begins and the reading in the Beckam 

640 spectrophotometer at 412 nm had to be immediate. All steps described were 

performed under cold conditions, on ice, to minimize enzymatic activity before the 

enzymatic reaction begins. Changes in absorvance were recorded for a period of 3 

minutes at intervals of 10 seconds. This enzymatic assay was always done in 

triplicates and the enzymatic activity was expressed as µmol ACT hydrolyzed/min/g 

of brain and nmol ACT hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein. 

The protein content of the homogenates was determined according to the 

method of Bradford [181] using bovine serum albumin as standard. 
 

2.5. Determination of Manganese in the Liver  
 

About 150 mg of each sample of liver pre-stored at -70ºC from 10 Mus spretus 

and 10 Apodemus sylvaticus randomly selected from both zones (5 from CA zone 

and 5 from BA zone) were defrosted and dried at 80ºC until reaching a constant 

weight. After that, dried samples were digested with 5 mL of 65% suprapure nitric 

acid during 3 hours at 150ºC. 

The resulting clear acid solutions were transferred to 50 mL volumetric flasks 

that were completed with deionized water. These solutions were used for the 

determination of Mn concentrations that were determined by GFAAS with a 

PerkinElmer AAnalyst™ 700 atomic absorption spectrometer equipped with an HGA 

Graphite Furnace and a programmable sample dispenser (AS 800 Auto Sampler and

WinLab 32 for AA software). Mg(NO3)2?6 H2O (0.84 mol/L) was used as a chemical 

modifier. Samples were measured at least twice and every measurement consisted 

of two separate injections into the graphite furnace.  

Results were expressed as micrograms of Mn per gram of dry liver. Calibration 

curves were automatically obtained by the device starting from a 25µg/L solution of 

MnCl2 that was successively diluted for 12.5, 6.3, and 2.5 µg Mn/L. The limit of 

detection was 0.05 µg Mn/L.  
 

2.6. Preliminary Genotype Analysis 
 

 For the genotype analysis of CYP1A1 polymorphism gene, it was used 

Tissue DNA Kit (Omega bio-tek) for extraction of DNA in muscle tissues. After that, 

Polimerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed for amplify samples of DNA, using 

specific primers available on lab that flanking one region of CYP1A1 gene with 702 

bp (Figure 13). It was used 15.5 µL of water, 5 µL of buffer (1x), 1 µL of dNTPs (2.5 

mM), 1.5 µL of magnesium (1.5 mM), 0.2 µL of primers F and R (25 µM), 0.4 µL of 

BSA (0.16 µg/µL), 0.2 µL of Taq polymerase (5U/µL) and 1 µL of DNA, for a total 

reaction volume of 25 µL per tube. Thermal cycling conditions included a hot start at 

94ºC for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94ºC for 1min, annealing at 

66ºC for 2 min and extension at 72ºC for 1 min. Final extension was performed at 

72ºC for 5 min. Then, samples were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose 

gel. Moreover, two samples successful amplified was purified and then send for 

sequencing.

In addition, successful amplified PCR products were digested during 3h at 

37ºC with restriction enzymes MseI and EcoRI, whose recognition sites are TTAA 

and GAATTC respectively, in order to assess if there was a differential cut. Through 

the GenBank, it was possible to consult the sequence of the fragment amplified and 

predict the number of fragments originated by these enzymes: MseI should cut the 

fragment at two sites, forming three fragments and EcoRI should cut the fragment at 

one site, forming two fragments. It was used 1 µL of 10x buffer, 2µL of DNA, 1 µL of 

MseI or 0.5 µL of EcoRI and 6 or 6.5 µL of water, respectively for a total reaction tube 

volume of 10 µL. After digestion, samples were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% 

agarose gel. 

 

2.7. Statistical Analysis 
 

The statistical analysis of the two species captured was done separately 

because of the differences between them. The data were statistically analyzed using 

SPSS v.19.0. All variables were checked for normal distributions, using Kolmogorov-

Smirnov test. 

Differences between conventional agriculture group and biological agriculture 

group were assessed with Student’s t-test if they exhibited a normal distribution; if 

not, the Mann-Whitney`s U-Test was used instead. Differences between males and 

females of each zone were always assessed. The significance of differences was 

examined at the p-value of 0.05.  

For alignment and sequence analysis were used BioEdit and Sequencher 4.8 

programs.

There were no significant differences for morphophisiological measurements 

between males and females of each zone, thus sexes were combined for statistical 

analysis. All measures were normally distributed except body length (D=0.236, 

p=0.034) and MCHC (D=0.352, p&lt;0.001) for Mus spretus from CA zone, WBC 

(D=0.416, p&lt;0.001) for Apodemus sylvaticus from CA zone and MCHC (D=0.294, 

p=0.024) in Apodemus sylvaticus from BA zone. 

About Internal organs mass, significantly higher mean values of relative weight 

spleen (t=2.405, p=0.024) were found for Mus spretus from CA zone compared to BA 

zone. Moreover, Mus spretus from BA zone have a higher mean value of relative 

weight testis (t=-4.471, p=0.001). In relation to Apodemus sylvaticus, there were find 

significant differences only for the relative weight liver, where animals from BA zone 

have significantly bigger livers (t=-3.126, p=0.007). 

In relation to hematological parameters, there were no significant differences 

between CA and BA groups of Apodemus sylvaticus. However, there were significant 

differences between Mus spretus from CA and BA zones for hemoglobin (t=3.735, 

p=0.001), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (t=3.905, p=0.001) and mean corpuscular 

hemoglobin concentration (U=13.00, p&lt;0.001). 
 

3.2. Biomarkers of Genotoxicity 

3.2.1. Comet Assay 
 

Extent of DNA migration was assessed using the parameter percentage of 

DNA in the comet tail (% tail DNA). This parameter of DNA damage is widely used 

and correlates well with visual scores. Figure 13 shows examples of visual aspect of 

comets from Mus spretus lymphocytes with different levels of DNA damage. Comets 

from Apodemus sylvaticus have a similar aspect. 

About % tail DNA, there were no significant differences between males and 

females of each zone, thus sexes were combined for statistical analysis. % tail DNA 

was not normally distributed for Mus spretus (D=0.233, p=0.038) and Apodemus 

sylvaticus (D=0.286, p=0.033) samples from CA zone.

showing different levels of DNA damage: A) Comet with low DNA migration that means few

As we can see in Figure 15, for both species there is a tendency for greater 

genetic damage in animals from CA zones, which are exposed to pesticides. 

However, there is a significant difference between CA zone (Mean % tail 

DNA=9.80±2.48) and BA zone (Mean % tail DNA=6.96±2.63)  only for Apodemus 

sylvaticus (U=16.00, p=0.031). Mus spretus from CA zone (Mean % tail

not show significant differences (U=85.00, p=0.550) relatively to the DNA damage 

estimated by % tail DNA.

3.2.2. Micronucleus Assay  
 

With Acridine Orange staining, cytoplasm of PCEs emits red fluorescence and 

MN fluoresces yellowish green. NCEs emit green fluorescence and they were easily 

distinguished from PCEs (Figure 16).

polychromatic erythrocyte (PCE). 
 

 

 
 

There were no significant differences for MNPCEs number between males and 

females of each zone, thus sexes were combined for statistical analysis. MNPCEs 

number was not normally distributed for Mus spretus from CA (D=0.252, p=0.0316) 

and BA (D=0.227, p=0.048) zones. 

As we can see in Table 5, for both species there is a tendency for greater 

genetic damage in animals from CA zones, which are exposed to pesticides. 

However, there is a significant difference between CA  (Mean % tail DNA=9.80±2.48) 

and BA zones (Mean % tail DNA=6.96±2.63)  only for Mus spretus (U=14.00, 

p&lt;0.001). Apodemus sylvaticus do not show significant differences (t=1.482,

two zones.

3.2.3. Sperm Abnormality Assay 
 

In this assay different morphological alterations in the mice sperm were 

observed (Figure 17). Amorphous sperm and sperm without the usual hook are the 

most frequently observed alterations. On the contrary, the two tails and the banana 

form are the least common morphological abnormalities (Table 6).

usual hook; B- Banana-like form; D- Amorphous; E- Two tails. 
 

Abnormal sperm frequency was normally distributed for all the samples and it 

increased significantly in Mus spretus from CA zone when compared with Mus 

spretus from BA zone (t=3.201, p=0.006). So, small mammals exposed to pesticides 

have increased abnormal sperm. Apodemus sylvaticus from CA zone also present a 

higher frequency of abnormal sperm compared to BA zone but this result is not 

statistically significant (t=0.500, p=0.638).

3.3. Determination of Brain Acetylcholinesterase 
Activity 

 

Brain AChE activity was expressed not only as µmol ACT hydrolyzed/min/g of 

brain but also as nmol ACT hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein, being protein content 

determined according to the method of Bradford. AChE activity expressed as nmol 

ACT hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein was not normally distributed for Apodemus 

sylvaticus (D=0.385, p=0.002) from BA zone. 

For both species, there is a tendency for greater activity of brain AChE in the 

CA zone, exposed to pesticides (Table 7). However, the differences between CA and 

BA zones are not statistically significant (Mus spretus: 1t=1.207, p=0.262; 2t=0.991,

Mn concentrations in the liver were normally distribuited for all the samples. 

Both Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus from CA zone  had statistically 

significant high levels of Mn in the liver compared to animals from BA zone (Figure 

18).  

For Mus spretus, animals from CA zone had 7.20±1.87 µg Mn/g dry liver, while 

animals from BA zone had 4.21±1.09 µg Mn/g dry liver (t=3.078 p=0.015). For 

Apodemus sylvatcus, animals from CA zone had 7.65±1.12 µg Mn/g dry liver, while 

animals from BA zone had 4.85±1.83 µg Mn/g dry liver (t=2.915 p=0.019).

The electrophoresis result of 10 Mus spretus muscle samples successful 

amplified with PCR are presented in Figure 19. As we can see, all samples were 

correctly amplified because there is a single band (? 700bp) of DNA for each sample. 

For Apodemus sylvaticus, there were not successful amplified samples with the same 

primers used for Mus spretus.

control assay. 

After analysis of the two samples sequenced, it was found only one different

About enzymatic digestion, MseI and EcoRI originate the 3 and 2 fragments 

expected, respectively and there was no differential cut, when comparing CA and BA 

samples (Figure 20).

4. Discussion of Results 
 

 

 

 

Pesticides are widely used in modern agriculture despite their hazards to 

humans and to nature. They have played a key role in providing reliable agricultural 

products at prices affordable to consumers, improving the quality of produce, and 

ensuring high profits to farmers. Theoretically, they are developed to function with 

reasonable certainty and minimal impact on human health and the environment. At 

European level, according to 91/414/EEC Directive (Council Directive 91/414/EEC, 

1991), active substances in pesticides formulations are only approved for use if they 

have undergone a peer-reviewed safety assessment [19]. Despite of that, serious 

concerns have been raised about health risks resulting from exposure to these 

approved pesticides and numerous studies have been published in order to alert 

about this [7,31, 183]. 

In particular, the low reported acute toxicity and short environmental 

persistence of Mancozeb have allowed its worldwide usage in agriculture, even 

though numerous effects of its chronic exposure have been reported. In fact, as 

stated before, Mancozeb has the capability to alter the function of thyroid [58, 59], 

immune system [60], reproductive system [61-64] and nervous system [65]. 

Moreover, in a long-term experimental study, Belpoggi et al. (2002) verified that 

Mancozeb is a multipotent carcinogen inducing a variety of tumors of different origins 

in rats [66]. Nevertheless, Mancozeb is included in the list (referred to as Annex I of 

the Council Directive 91/414/EEC, 1991) of active substances that are considered 

acceptable in regard to their impact on the environment, human and animal health, 

and therefore authorized for use in pesticide formulations within the European 

Community [19]. 

The present study clearly demonstrates that exposure to a mixture of 

pesticide, where Mancozeb represents more than 50% of that mixture, has the ability 

to cause DNA damage in small mammals, assessed by comet, MN and sperm 

abnormality assays. These results are in accordance with other studies using comet 

assay [67], MN assay [184] as well as the sperm abnormality assay [185] to assess 

Mancozeb genotoxicity. 

In a situation of chronic exposure to a mixture of pesticides like that, it is 

difficult to make sure that genotoxic effects detected are due to a particular pesticide. 

The owner farmer from CA zone ensures that more than 50% of the pesticide 



 
 
 

 
Tese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente 

45 Chapter I:  4.Discussion of Results 

applications were based on Mancozeb, an EBDC fungicide, but some OPs and 

carbamates insecticides were also used. So, to verify if the genetic damage detected 

would be due to this insecticides action, AChE activity was determined. AChE activity 

is widely used as a specific biomarker of these pesticides that are commonly used in 

agriculture [118] and if the small mammals analyzed were subjected to their action, 

AChE activity will be inhibited. In the present study, there were no significant 

differences between AChE activity for small animals from CA and BA zones that 

could explain the significant differences of the genetic damage found in the same 

animals. Thus, we can conclude that OPs or carbamates insecticides are not the 

genotoxic agents at issue.  

On the other hand, to prove that Mancozeb, the most widely used pesticide in 

the CA zone, was the genotoxic agent responsible to the DNA damage detected, it 

would be necessary to prove that these animals were really exposed. Mancozeb is 

an EBDC with the presence of coordinated transitional metals and ETU is the specific 

metabolite of these compounds resulting from a spontaneous breakdown. Therefore, 

ETU quantification in urine has been widely used as a biomarker of exposure to 

Mancozeb and others EBDCs[76]. However, in this study, it was not possible to use 

this biomarker to assess exposure to Mancozeb because the amounts of urine 

obtained from small mammals were not sufficient to quantify ETU. To achieve this, it 

would be necessary to keep animals in metabolic cages for several days, which was 

not possible.  

Alternatively, it was used Mn quantification by GFAAS to indirectly quantify 

Mancozeb inside the animal’s body. Mancozeb is chemically characterized by the 

presence of coordinated transitional metals in the molecule, like Mn and Zn. Thus, 

measurement of these metals in biological tissues has been proposed as an 

alternative approach to monitor Mancozeb exposure. This application  may be very 

useful for biological monitoring, since determination of metals can be performed with 

very sensitive AAS methods which are of lower complexity than those required for 

metabolite determination, like ETU [52]. Canossa et al. (1993) have already observed 

an increased urinary excretion of manganese in workers exposed to Mancozeb [186] 

but  more research is needed because the available data, at present,  are not 

sufficient to validate the use of metals as biomarkers of exposure to Mancozeb [52]. 

In addition, it is necessary to investigate the presence of metals not only in urine but 

also in other tissues and biological fluids as potential biomarkers.  



 
 
 

 
Tese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente 

46 Chapter I:  4.Discussion of Results 

Consequently, in the present study, it was used Mn quantification by GFAAS 

in small mammals’ liver as a potential biomarker of Mancozeb exposure, because the 

liver is a filter organ where metals will be accumulated. As a result, it was found that 

both species (Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus) from CA zone, exposed to 

pesticides, with greater genetic damage, have also greater levels of the metal Mn, 

comparing to animals from BA zone. So, considering that Mancozeb is the widely 

used pesticide in the CA zone, we can conclude that this pesticide will be the source 

of the highest levels of Mn found in small mammals. In other words, it seems that 

Mancozeb is the genotoxic agent which caused the DNA damage detected. 

It is still important to note that, although results are not significant, there is a 

tendency for higher values of AChE activity in the CA zone compared to BA zone, 

which is not in line with expectations because CA zone is exposed to pesticides, 

including OPs and carbamates insecticides, which supposedly will inhibit the 

enzyme. However, it is known that AchE activity has to be determinated immediately 

after exposure and during captures there were no pesticides applications. So, AchE 

activity is not a good biomarker when the objective is to evaluate the long-term 

exposure. On the other hand, the presence of higher levels of Mn, as a consequence 

of the high amounts of Mancozeb used, can be related to these higher levels of 

AChE activity. In fact, Liapi et al. (2008) has recently suggests, in a short-term Mn 

administration study, that Mn cause a significant increase in AChE activity in rats 

[137] and our results seem to be in concordance with these ones. Although Mn action 

is a complex process and is still very controversial, Mn exerts different effects on 

AChE activity in different stages of the life cycle [138]. 

Despite the evident genotoxic action of Mancozeb, the two analyzed species 

seems to be affected in a different away. While, for Mus spretus significant genetic 

differences were detected by the MN and sperm abnormality assays, for Apodemus 

sylvaticus significant genetic differences between animals from CA and BA were only 

detected by comet assay. Comet, MN and sperm abnormality assays assess the 

DNA damage in different cells populations: comet assay evaluate the DNA damage 

in lymphocytes from the bloodstream, MN were detected in PCEs from bone marrow 

and sperm abnormalities were assessed in male germ cells. Thus, our results 

suggest that the two species subject to the same genotoxic agents appear to have 

populations of cells to be affected differently.

47 Chapter I:  4.Discussion of Results 

The differential response to the same genotoxic agent may be due because 

these two species have very different habits of life, including different feeding habits. 

Mus spretus are exclusively herbivores, whereas Apodemus sylvaticus are more 

omnivorous and their diets may include a large fraction of arthropods. Thus, the 

intensity and the frequency of the animal`s exposure to pesticides will be different in 

the two species because different foods will have different levels of these chemicals. 

On the other hand, different responses to genotoxic agents may only reflect intrinsic 

differences of species rather than differences related to exposure that was already 

corroborated in previous studies [187, 188]. 

It would be expected that Comet assay was a more sensitive test than MN 

assay because there are a lot of studies that confirm the ability of comet assay to 

detect the effect of genotoxic agents at lower doses than the MN assay. However, 

taking into account the present study, it seems that this sensibility depend on the 

species concerned. For Mus spretus, MN assays was the ability to detect significant 

differences in DNA damage between small mammals from CA and BA zones that 

were not detected by Comet Assay. MN assay using AO as staining method is more 

useful and gives more reliable results than the usual Giemsa staining because both 

PCEs and a MN can be easily distinguished. So, MN assay using AO staining has 

also a good sensibility that should be considered.  

On the other hand, the sensitivity difference between the comet assay and MN 

assay may be due to their different endpoints. MN assay determines unrepaired DNA 

strand breaks, while the comet assay determines strand breaks (single and/ or 

double) and labile sites that are subsequently removed by repair enzymes [189]. 

Comet assay can determine the short-lived DNA damage while the MN assay detects 

the structural and numerical chromosomal damage [97, 190]. Thus, like several 

reports suggests, a combination of this two assays might therefore be recommended 

to understand the mechanisms underlying mutagenicity and to improve the sensibility 

as well as reliability of detection which can better facilitate the risk assessment 

process [191].  

Furthermore, a combination of these two assays with the sperm abnormality 

assay is also very useful because it is a fast and sensitive mutagenicity test [113] 

used to detect cytogenetic damage in germ cells further than somatic cells. However, 

the classification used in this test is somewhat subjective with many technical 

artifacts and, therefore, it has not been widely used in recent times. For example, in

the present study, we have to discard the category “folded on themselves” of the 

sperm abnormalities classification because there was found an abnormal percentage 

of sperm cells in this category for all the animals due possibly to a very high 

centrifugal speed. Nevertheless, we find significant differences in the percentage of 

sperm abnormalities in Mus spretus from CA zone, comparing to BA zone, but there 

were no significant differences for Apodemus sylvaticus. It is important to refer that 

this result can be due to the reduced number of males Apodemus sylvaticus 

captured: only six males in CA zone and two males in BA zone. In fact, a larger 

sampler would be essentially for more reliable results not only for sperm abnormality 

assay but also for the other genotoxic tests, especially in wild species like these 

because the variability among animals can be higher than in laboratory animals. 

Our study clearly showed that the use of only one cytogenetic end point is not 

sufficient to understand the range of the effects of pesticides on the genetic material 

in an in situ study. However, when other end points are included like in the present 

study, the method can be very promising. Moreover, because of differences in 

sensitivities, it is important to have more than one species for comparison to 

establish a genotoxic profile of one area.   

About morphophisiological analysis, it will be expected that animals from 

contaminated zone (CA zone) would have lower values for body measurements 

comparing to uncontaminated zone (BA zone). In fact, there have been recognized 

morphological changes in organisms as a result of environmental pollution and body 

measurements, internal organs mass as well as hematological parameters are 

commonly used to assess the health status of wild species exposed to any kind of 

pollution [162, 163]. So, it will be expected that exposure to pesticides had influence 

on animals development and consequently on animal size. However, there were no 

significant differences for body measurements between animals from CA and BA 

zones for both species. Significant differences were only found in some internal 

organs mass: Mus spretus from CA zone have significant lower values of relative 

weight testis comparing to animals from BA zone. Moreover, significant differences 

were also found in relative weight spleen for Mus spretus, where animals from CA 

zone have bigger spleens than animals from BA zone. This is in line with 

expectations because spleen has an important immune function and bigger 

dimensions are indicative of an infection response that could be caused by pesticides

49 Chapter I:  4.Discussion of Results 

exposure. In fact, splenic hyperplasia were already detected in mice after 

administration of some pesticides [192].  

Significant differences were also found in relative weight liver for Apodemus 

sylvaticus, but this is not in line with expectations because animals from BA zone 

have bigger livers than CA zone. Liver is a filter organ, filtering xenobiotic agents and 

are involved on metabolism and detoxification of this compounds. So, it would be 

expected that animals from CA zone, exposed to pesticides, had a hyperplasic liver 

in order to provide as far as possible a satisfactory degradation of xenobiotics. This 

tendency for bigger livers in animals from BA zone only happened in the species 

Apodemus sylvaticus and it may be due to the presence of other xenobiotic agents. 

Regarding hematological parameters, several studies have reported changes 

in those parameters as a consequence of pesticides exposure [192-194]. In the 

present study, significant results were only found for Hgb, MCH and MCHC 

parameters in Mus spretus species. These parameters are all related to hemoglobin 

and are higher in small mammals from CA zone that is not in line with expectations 

because pesticides seem to cause a decrease in hemoglobin content. It is important 

to refer that Beckman Coulter Act Diff Hematology Analyzer, the apparatus used to 

obtain these results, showed some inconsistencies in the provided values, so we 

must consider the hypothesis of these values are not the real ones. 

In relation to genotype analysis, we were able to amplify CYP1A1 in Mus 

spretus species but not in Apodemus sylvaticus. This is because the available 

primers were nor adequate to amplify this gene in Apodemus sylvaticus genome. 

Thus, to do an analysis of this kind, it is essential to start by drawing new primers that 

allowing the amplification of this genome region and then optimize the PCR 

technique as was done for Mus spretus. We only amplified the genome of ten Mus 

spretus from CA and BA zones and then only two samples were sequenced due to 

economic constraints. To obtain some reliable results it would be necessary to 

analyze much more individuals. However, comparing the two sequences amplified, 

one from CA zone and another from BA zone, it was found that they differ on only 

one base pair. So, this region of the genome seems to be very conservative between 

individuals and we cannot conclude that this difference is a SNP because we only 

compared two animals and this difference can be only genetic diversity between 

individuals of the same species.

50 Chapter I:  4.Discussion of Results 

 Moreover, some samples were cut with two restriction enzymes, MseI and 

EcoRI, to research any possible polymorphism. These enzymes cut in the expected 

sites and there were no differences between animals from CA and BA zone. Only a 

small number of samples were tested due to economic constraint because enzymes 

are very expensive, so we cannot take conclusions.  

It will be important to investigate specific polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 

genes, like CYP1A1, involved in the xenobiotic´s metabolism because individuals 

with unfavorable metabolizing alleles can be more susceptible to genotoxic effects of 

xenobiotic agents, like pesticides, that can lead to an increased probability to 

developing cancer. Thus, the research of susceptibility biomarkers will be 

fundamental to the diagnosis and prevention of the disease. 

In situ studies like the present that compares bioindicator species from a 

conventional agriculture zone versus a biological agriculture zone can be extremely 

important in assessing the toxicity of pesticides to humans. Even though the general 

population is not as exposed as animals because they only contact to pesticides 

through the consumption of agricultural products while animals live in the fields and 

are directly subjected to pesticide applications, the evaluation of the toxicological risk 

of pesticides in this way for humans is quite acceptable and more realistic than 

animal laboratory experiments. In fact, it is known that many pesticides are 

transformed in the environment through physical, chemical and biological processes 

which are intended to detoxify them but often the transformation process forms 

products that are more toxic than the parent [195]. Moreover, it is not feasible to 

predict the toxicity of pesticide mixtures on the basis of the results of the toxicity of 

single components because the effects of a mixture of pesticides are often different 

from the individual effects of a single components [196] and human exposure is 

rarely limited to a single compound. So, in situ studies are obviously closer to the real 

situation and must be considered in the pesticide approval process. 

In conclusion, the present study clearly prove that conventional agriculture 

even with the use of pesticides legally approved in the European community, like 

Mancozeb, represent a higher genotoxic risk compared to biological agriculture. 

Despite all the controversy, biological agriculture has been adopted by an increasing 

number of farmers, like the farmer who collaborated in this study, and they believe 

that this practice has the potential for mass production of the amount of calories 

needed to feed humanity. We do not know if this is possible but it is urgent to find

and develop alternative and profitable agricultural practices, in order to minimize the 

use of pesticides, which represents a real global problem.

5. Final Remarks and Future Perspectives 
 

 
? The present work contributes to alert about hazard effects resulting from 

pesticide exposure, particularly Mancozeb, a pesticide legally authorized for 

use in European Community; 
 

? As revealed by the three cytogenetic endpoints used, Mancozeb is capable of 

inducing DNA damage in Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus species; 
 

? The use of several tests is essential to have a full picture of the genotoxic 

effects especially in wild species since the variability among animals can be 

higher than in laboratory animals; 
 

? The use at least two sympatric species to detect the presence of genotoxic 

agents is essential because there may be a difference in sensitivity of the 

species selected as bioindicators in relation to the cytogenetic end points 

analyzed; 
 

? Morphophisiological analysis was not able to detect pesticide toxicity. Only the 

increased spleens reveled clearly the consequences of pesticide exposure; 
 

? AChE activity  is not a good biomarker when the objective is to evaluate the 

long-term exposure to a mixture of pesticides, where some pesticides like 

Mancozeb can have components, which interfere with AChE activity; 
 

? Mn quantification seems to be a good biomarker of exposure to Mancozeb and 

more research is needed to validate the metal quantifications as biomarkers of 

exposure to this type of pesticides; 
 

? The present results provide reference values for the analyzed biomarkers 

allowing future comparisons with other small mammals’ populations. 
 

? M. spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus are suitable bioindicator species of 

pesticide pollution, demonstrating variation in morphological, biochemical and 

genotoxic effects of exposure; 
 

? To determine CYP1A1 polymorphisms, that could be genetic markers of 

susceptibility to genotoxic agents’ action, it is necessary to continue the 



 
 
 

 
Tese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente 

53  Chapter I: 5.Final Remarks and Future Perspectives 

preliminary genotype analysis described, analyzing more animals and 

exploring different primers and enzymes; 
 

? Finally, despite Mancozeb toxicity, it will belong to the most widely used 

pesticide in the world due to their efficacy, and low relatively low cost and 

persistence in the environment. As a result, a large part of the population will 

continue to be exposed, and concerns for their known and potentially newly 

discovered adverse effects will remain alive.

67 Chapter II: Abstract 

Abstract 
 

Pesticides are widely used for pest control in conventional agriculture, despite 

their negative impacts. Biological agriculture can represent a valuable option, 

avoiding the use of pesticides, but it does not appear to have the potential to respond 

to the mass production of food to feed humanity.   

Mancozeb is a widely used fungicide mainly because of its low acute toxicity in 

mammals and scarce persistence in the environment. However, it has been 

considered a multipotent carcinogen, mutagenic and possibly teratogenic in a long-

term exposure context.  

Small mammals can be used as bioindicators of environmental toxicity of 

pesticides, accumulating a wide spectrum of pollutants, and significant correlations 

between pesticides and genetic damage in free-living rodents have already been 

detected.  

The main aim of this study was the in situ assessment of Mancozeb 

genotoxicity, using two small mammals’ species (Mus spretus and Apodemus 

sylvaticus) from a conventional agriculture (CA) versus a biological agriculture (BA) 

zone. It was found that exposure to a mixture of pesticide, where Mancozeb 

represents more than 50% of that mixture, has the ability to cause DNA damage in 

small mammals, assessed by comet, micronucleus and sperm abnormality assays. 

Moreover, both species, exposed to pesticides, with greater genetic damage, have 

also greater levels of Manganese. Thus, we can conclude that Mancozeb, the source 

of the highest levels of manganese found in small mammals, is the genotoxic agent 

at issue.  

In conclusion, the present study clearly prove that conventional agriculture 

even with the use of pesticides legally approved in the European community, like 

Mancozeb, represent a higher genotoxic risk compared to biological agriculture. It is 

urgent to find and develop alternative and profitable agricultural practices, in order to 

minimize the use of pesticides, which represents a real global problem.

Chapter II: 1.Introduction 

1. Introduction 
 

 

The widespread use of pesticides is affecting the entire planet, including the 

human health [1-3] and conventional agriculture is largely responsible for the 

increased consumption of pesticides worldwide [4]. In Portugal, according to Eurostat 

[5], sales of pesticides have been increased in the last years and more than 17000 

tones were sold in 2008. 

Pesticides can be considered an economic, labor-saving, and efficient tool of 

pest management [6] and they are developed through very strict regulation 

processes to function with reasonable certainty and minimal impact on human health 

and the environment [7-9]. Even though the published results are not always in 

agreement with this and serious concerns have been raised about health risks 

resulting not only from occupational exposure to pesticides but also from pesticides 

residues on food, for the general population [10]. Consequently, in the last years, 

additional efforts have been produced to reduce the use of pesticides and biological 

agriculture can represent a valuable option, avoiding the use of pesticides. 

Nevertheless, it does not appear to have the potential to respond to the mass 

production of food to feed humanity [11] and it deserves wide experimentation to fully 

understand its potentialities, constraints and limitations [12].  

Mancozeb, an ethylenebisdithiocarbamate (EBDC) is a widely used fungicide 

to protect fruits, vegetables and field crops against a large spectrum of fungal 

diseases. It is one of the most widely used commercial fungicides worldwide [13], 

mainly because of its low acute toxicity in mammals and scarce persistence in the 

environment [14]. Although, Mancozeb, mainly through its degradation product 

ethylenethiourea (ETU), has been reported to produce significant toxicological effects 

on thyroid [15, 16], immune system [17], reproductive system [18-21] and nervous 

system [22]. Moreover, Mancozeb was considered mutagenic [23], teratogenic [24] 

and a multipotent carcinogen, inducing a variety of tumors of different origin in rats 

after chronic exposure [25]. In addition, Mn, a coordinated transitional metal 

constituent of Mancozeb, is also a proven mutagen, causing DNA damage and 

chromosome aberrations [26]. 

The environmental genotoxicity of pesticides can be investigated in small 

mammals in the fields because they are able to accumulate a wide spectrum of 

pollutants which are present in the ecosystem [27] and, particularly, some significant

Chapter II: 1.Introduction 

correlations between pesticides and genetic damage in free-living rodents have been 

detected [28]. Moreover, small mammals, mostly rodents, have enough genetic and 

physiological similarities with humans and, therefore, it allows extrapolating the effect 

of these pollutants.  

The main aim of this study is the in situ assessment of pesticides genotoxicity, 

particularly Mancozeb, in two small mammal`s species from a conventional 

agriculture (CA) versus a biological agriculture (BA) zone. The wild small mammal 

species, Algerian mouse (Mus spretus, Lataste, 1883) and Wood mouse (Apodemus 

sylvaticus, Linnaeus, 1758) were chosen in this study as pesticide pollution 

bioindicators. These species have been widely used as a bioindicators in some 

environmental studies [29-33].

2. Material and Methods 
 

 

2.1. Study Areas 
 

This study was carried out in an agricultural zone of Alcobaça, district of Leiria, 

Portugal. In this region, agriculture is still an important economic activity with a wide 

area under agricultural practice. Animals were captured from conventional and 

biological agriculture zones. It was considered that these zones are both insert in the 

same biotope (?1km of distance between them) and it was presumed that pesticide 

use is the main external factor that distinguishes them. The biological agriculture 

zone is correctly isolated from adjacent agriculture zones, so it is expected that it 

cannot be affected by adjacent pesticides applications. 

Before animals capture, the agreement and the cooperation of the farmers 

involved were required and they were asked about pesticides and others chemical 

products that were used in the fields. While in biological agriculture (BA) zone, the 

owner farmer ensured that there were not used any type of chemical products, being 

an agricultural practice based on the use of natural enemies for the pest control, that 

was converted about 5 years ago, in conventional agriculture (CA) zone, the owner 

farmer guarantee that more than 50% of the applications were based on one EBDC: 

Mancozeb.  

 

2.2. Mice Sampling and Sacrifice 
 

A total of 46 small mammals of both sexes were captured between December 

2010 and February 2011 in both zones. All the animals were treated according to the 

Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 

September 2010 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes [34]. Small 

mammals were captured with Sherman traps using a mixture of canned sardine, flour 

and oil as bait. Cotton was also placed inside each trap to minimize lower 

temperatures that were felt during the night. Pregnant or lactant females were 

discharged as well as animals with less than 10g of weight. Mice were housed in 

individual plastic cages until reach the laboratory with ad libitum access to food and 

water.  

Animals were anesthetized and weighed before sacrifice. Cardiac puncture 

was done for blood collection, using a syringe with heparin to prevent coagulation

71 Chapter II: 2.Material and Methods 

and, during dissection liver, brain,femurs and testis were removed. Livers and brains 

were stored at -70ºC before subsequent analysis. 

 

2.3. Biomarkers of Genotoxicity  
 

2.3.1. Comet Assay 
 

The comet assay was performed as described by Singh et al. [35] with minor 

modifications. An aliquot of 15 µL of the blood samples collected by cardiac puncture 

was mixed with 300 µL 0.8% low-melting point agarose (37ºC) and then placed on a 

slide precoated with 1% normal-melting-point agarose. Immediately after that, the 

slide was covered with a coverslip and was then kept for 5 minutes on ice to solidify. 

After gently removing the coverslip, subsequent to solidification, slide was immersed 

in a cold lysing solution (2.5M NaCl, 0.1M EDTA, 10mM Tris, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 

and 10% (v/v) DMSO) at 4ºC over night. After lysis, the slide was placed in a 

horizontal electrophoresis box. The box was filled with fresh electrophoresis solution 

(1 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaOH, pH?13) and the slide was left in this solution for 40 min 

to allow unwinding. Electrophoresis was performed using the same solution at 25 V 

and 300 mA for 30 min. After that, the slide was gently neutralized with 0.4 M Tris 

buffer at pH 7.5 three times and then stained with SYBR Safe 4µL/mL. All steps 

described were performed under dark conditions to minimize additional ultraviolet 

induced DNA damage. 

The slides were examined, and comet images were captured using a 

fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX41). Approximately 200 randomly selected 

cells were analyzed at 400x magnification per each animal. Extent of DNA migration 

was determined using a computerized image analysis system (Comet Score TM - 

TriTek Corp).  

 

2.3.2. Micronucleus Assay using Acridine Orange 
 

 At the time of sacrifice, bone-marrow cells from both femurs of each 

animal were flushed with foetal calf serum, for the estimation of the frequency of 

micronucleated PCEs, according to Schmid [36]. The obtained cell suspension was 

centrifuged (800rpm, 5 min), the supernatant was removed and the pellet re-

suspended in foetal calf serum. Then, a drop of the suspension was smeared on a 



 
  
 

 
Tese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente 

72 Chapter II: 2.Material and Methods 

clean slide, air-dried, fixed in methanol for 10 minutes and stained with AO for 

fluorescent microscopic examination (Olympus BX41, equipped with blue excitation 

and 515-530 nm barrier filter) with a magnification of 400×. The frequency of MN in 

1000 PCE per mouse (coded slides) was scored. The acridine orange (0.24mM in 

Sorensen Buffer pH=6.8) used was prepared from a stock solution of acridine orange 

0.1% according to Krishna and Hayashi (2000) [37]. 

 

2.3.3. Sperm Abnormality Assay 
 

The testis of the mice was dissected out, placed in 1 mL of Sorensen buffer 

(pH 7.0) and gently centrifuged (800rpm, 10 min) to obtain a pellet of undamaged 

cells. After removal of the supernatant, the pellet was re-suspended in 1 mL of 

Sorensen buffer. A drop of the suspension was placed on a clean slide and a smear 

is made, air-dried and fixed in absolute methanol for 10 min. After drying overnight 

the slides were stained with 10% Giemsa for 1 h [38] and observed under the 

microscope with a magnification of 100×. According to Wyrobek and Bruce [39], 1000 

sperm per animal were assessed for morphological abnormalities, which included 

without hook, banana shape, amorphous, folded on themselves and two tails. 

 

2.4. Determination of Manganese in the Liver  
 

About 150 mg of each sample of liver pre-stored at -70ºC from 10 Mus spretus 

and 10 Apodemus sylvaticus randomly selected from both zones (5 from CA zone 

and 5 from BA zone) were defrosted and dried at 80ºC until reaching a constant 

weight. After that, dried samples were digested with 5 mL of 65% suprapure nitric 

acid during 3 hours at 150ºC. 

The resulting clear acid solutions were transferred to 50mL volumetric flasks 

that were completed with deionized water. These solutions were used for the 

determination of Mn concentrations that were determined by Graphite Furnance 

Atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) with a PerkinElmer AAnalyst™ 700 atomic 

absorption spectrometer equipped with an HGA Graphite Furnace and a 

programmable sample dispenser (AS 800 Auto Sampler and WinLab 32 for AA 

software). Mg(NO3)2?6 H2O (0.84 mol/L) was used as a chemical modifier. Samples 

were measured at least twice and every measurement consisted of two separate 

injections into the graphite furnace.  



 
  
 

 
Tese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente 

73 Chapter II: 2.Material and Methods 

Results were expressed as micrograms of Mn per gram of dry liver. Calibration 

curves were automatically obtained by the device starting from a 25µg/L solution of 

MnCl2 that was successively diluted for 12.5, 6.3, and 2.5 µg Mn/L. The limit of 

detection was 0.05 µg Mn/L.  

 

2.5. Statistical Analysis 
 

The statistical analysis of the two species captured was done separately 

because of the differences between them. The data were statistically analyzed using 

SPSS v.19.0. All variables were checked for normal distributions, using Kolmogorov-

Smirnov test (Lilliefors significance correction). 

Differences between conventional agriculture group and biological agriculture 

group were assessed with Student’s t-test if they exhibited a normal distribution; if 

not, the Mann-Whitney`s U-Test was used instead. Differences between males and 

females of each zone were always assessed. The significance of differences was 

examined at the p-value of 0.05.

3. Results  
 

3.1. Comet Assay 
 

There were no significant differences between males and females of each 

zone, thus sexes were combined for statistical analysis. % tail DNA was not normally 

distributed for Mus spretus (D=0.233, p=0.038) and Apodemus sylvaticus (D=0.286, 

p=0.033) samples from CA zone. 

As we can see in Figure 1, for both species there is a tendency for greater 

genetic damage in animals from CA zones, which are exposed to pesticides. 

However, there is a significant difference between CA zone (Mean % tail 

DNA=9.80±2.48) and BA zone (Mean % tail DNA=6.96±2.63)  only for Apodemus 

sylvaticus (U=16.00, p=0.031). Mus spretus from CA zone (Mean % tail 

DNA=8.10±3.04) and Mus spretus from BA zone (Mean % tail DNA=6.96±2.63) do 

not show significant differences (U=85.00, p=0.550) relatively to the DNA damage 

estimated by % tail DNA.

3.2. Micronucleus Assay  
 

There were no significant differences for MNPCEs number between males and 

females of each zone, thus sexes were combined for statistical analysis. MNPCEs 

number was not normally distributed for Mus spretus from CA (D=0.252, p=0.0316) 

and BA (D=0.227, p=0.048) zones.

As we can see in Table 1, for both species there is a tendency for greater 

genetic damage in animals from CA zones, which are exposed to pesticides. 

However, there is a significant difference between CA (Mean % tail DNA=9.80±2.48) 

and BA zones (Mean % tail DNA=6.96±2.63) only for Mus spretus (U=14.00, 

p&lt;0.001). Apodemus sylvaticus do not show significant differences (t=1.482, 

p=0.158) relatively to the DNA damage estimated by MN PCEs number, between the 

two zones. 

 

3.3. Sperm Abnormality Assay 
 

In this assay different morphological alterations in the mice sperm were 

observed. Amorphous sperm and sperm without the usual hook are the most 

frequently observed alterations. On the contrary, the two tails and the banana form 

are the least common morphological abnormalities (Table 2).  

Abnormal sperm frequency was normally distributed for all the samples and it 

increased significantly in Mus spretus from CA zone when compared with Mus 

spretus from BA zone (t=3.201, p=0.006). So, small mammals exposed to pesticides

have increased abnormal sperm. Apodemus sylvaticus from CA zone also present a 

higher frequency of abnormal sperm compared to BA zone but this result is not 

statistically significant (t=0.500, p=0.638).

3.4. Determination of Manganese in the Liver  
 

Mn concentrations in the liver were normally distributed for all the samples. 

Both Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus from CA zone had statistically significant 

high levels of Mn in the liver compared to animals from BA zone (Figure 2).  

For Mus spretus, animals from CA zone had 7.20±1.87 µg Mn/g dry liver, while

4. Discussion of Results 
 

Pesticides are widely used in modern agriculture despite their hazards to 

humans and to nature. They have played a key role in providing reliable agricultural 

products at prices affordable to consumers, improving the quality of produce, and 

ensuring high profits to farmers. Theoretically, they are developed to function with 

minimal impacts on human health and the environment. At European level, according 

to 91/414/EEC Directive (Council Directive 91/414/EEC, 1991), active substances in 

pesticides formulations are only approved for use if they have undergone a peer-

reviewed safety assessment [8]. Despite of that, serious concerns have been raised 

about health risks resulting from exposure to these approved pesticides and 

numerous studies have been published in order to alert about this [40-42]. 

In particular, the low reported acute toxicity and short environmental 

persistence of Mancozeb have allowed its worldwide usage in agriculture, even 

though numerous effects of its chronic exposure have been reported. In fact, as 

stated before, Mancozeb has the capability to alter the function of thyroid [15, 16], 

immune system [17], reproductive system [18-21] and nervous system [22]. 

Moreover, in a long-term experimental study, Belpoggi et al. (2002) verified that 

Mancozeb is a multipotent carcinogen inducing a variety of tumors of different origins 

in rats [25]. Nevertheless, Mancozeb is included in the list (referred to as Annex I of 

the Council Directive 91/414/EEC, 1991) of active substances that are considered 

acceptable in regard to their impact on the environment, human and animal health, 

and therefore authorized for use in pesticide formulations within the European 

Community [8]. 

The present study clearly demonstrates that exposure to a mixture of 

pesticide, where Mancozeb represents more than 50% of that mixture, has the ability 

to cause DNA damage in small mammals, assessed by comet, MN and sperm 

abnormality assays. These results are in accordance with other studies using comet 

assay [23], MN assay [43] as well as the sperm abnormality assay [44] to assess 

Mancozeb genotoxicity. 

To guarantee that Mancozeb, the most widely used pesticide in the CA zone, 

was the genotoxic agent responsible to the DNA damage detected, it would be 

necessary to prove that these animals were really exposed. Mancozeb is an EBDC 

with the presence of coordinated transitional metals and ETU is the specific

79 Chapter II: 4.Discussion of Results 

metabolite of these compounds resulting from a spontaneous breakdown. Therefore, 

ETU quantification in urine has been widely used as a biomarker of exposure to 

Mancozeb and others EBDCs [45]. However, in this study, it was not possible to use 

this biomarker to assess exposure to Mancozeb because the amounts of urine 

obtained from small mammals were not sufficient to quantify ETU. To achieve this, it 

would be necessary to keep animals in metabolic cages for several days, which was 

not possible.  

Alternatively, it was used Mn quantification by GFAAS to indirectly quantify 

Mancozeb inside the animal’s body. Mancozeb is chemically characterized by the 

presence of coordinated transitional metals in the molecule, like Mn and Zn. Thus, 

measurement of these metals in biological tissues has been proposed as an 

alternative approach to monitor Mancozeb exposure. This application may be very 

useful for biological monitoring, since determination of metals can be performed with 

very sensitive AAS methods which are of lower complexity than those required for 

metabolite determination, like ETU [14]. Canossa et al. (1993) have already observed 

an increased urinary excretion of manganese in workers exposed to Mancozeb [46] 

but more research is needed because the available data, at present, are not 

sufficient to validate the use of metals as biomarkers of exposure to Mancozeb [14]. 

In addition, it is necessary to investigate the presence of metals not only in urine but 

also in other tissues and biological fluids as potential biomarkers.  

Consequently, in the present study, it was used Mn quantification by GFAAS 

in small mammals’ liver as a potential biomarker of Mancozeb exposure, because the 

liver is a filter organ where metals will be accumulated. As a result, it was found that 

both species (Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus) from CA zone, exposed to 

pesticides, with greater genetic damage, have also greater levels of the metal Mn, 

comparing to animals from BA zone. So, considering that Mancozeb is the widely 

used pesticide in the CA zone, we can conclude that this pesticide will be the source 

of the highest levels of Mn found in small mammals. In other words, it seems that 

Mancozeb is the genotoxic agent which caused the DNA damage detected. 

Despite the evident genotoxic action of Mancozeb, the two analyzed species 

seems to be affected in a different away. While, for Mus spretus significant genetic 

differences were detected by the MN and sperm abnormality assays, for Apodemus 

sylvaticus significant genetic differences between animals from CA and BA were only 

detected by comet assay. Comet, MN and sperm abnormality assays assess the 



 
  
 

 
Tese de Mestrado em Biologia Humana e Ambiente 

80 Chapter II: 4.Discussion of Results 

DNA damage in different cells populations: comet assay evaluate the DNA damage 

in lymphocytes from the bloodstream, MN were detected in PCEs from bone marrow 

and sperm abnormalities were assessed in male germ cells. Thus, our results 

suggest that the two species subject to the same genotoxic agents seem to have 

populations of cells to be affected differently.  

The differential response to the same genotoxic agent may be due because 

these two species have very different habits of life, including different feeding habits. 

Mus spretus are exclusively herbivores, whereas Apodemus sylvaticus are more 

omnivorous and their diets may include a large fraction of arthropods. Thus, the 

intensity and the frequency of the animal`s exposure to pesticides will be different in 

the two species because different foods will have different levels of these chemicals. 

On the other hand, different responses to genotoxic agents may only reflect intrinsic 

differences of species rather than differences related to exposure that was already 

corroborated in previous studies [47, 48]. 

It would be expected that Comet assay was a more sensitive test than MN 

assay because there are a lot of studies that confirm the ability of comet assay to 

detect the effect of genotoxic agents at lower doses than the MN assay. However, 

taking into account the present study, it seems that this sensibility depend on the 

species concerned. For Mus spretus, MN assays was the ability to detect significant 

differences in DNA damage between small mammals from CA and BA zones that 

were not detected by Comet Assay. MN assay using AO as staining method is more 

useful and gives more reliable results than the usual Giemsa staining because both 

PCEs and a MN can be easily distinguished. So, MN assay using AO staining has 

also a good sensibility that should be considered.  

On the other hand, the sensitivity difference between the comet assay and MN 

assay may be due to their different endpoints. MN assay determines unrepaired DNA 

strand breaks, while the comet assay determines strand breaks (single and/ or 

double) and labile sites that are subsequently removed by repair enzymes [49]. 

Comet assay can determine the short-lived DNA damage while the MN assay detects 

the structural and numerical chromosomal damage [37, 50]. Thus, like several 

reports suggests, a combination of this two assays might therefore be recommended 

to understand the mechanisms underlying mutagenicity and to improve the sensibility 

as well as reliability of detection which can better facilitate the risk assessment 

process [51].

81 Chapter II: 4.Discussion of Results 

Furthermore, a combination of these two assays with the sperm abnormality 

assay is also very useful because it is a fast and sensitive mutagenicity test [39] used 

to detect cytogenetic damage in germ cells further than somatic cells. However, the 

classification used in this test is somewhat subjective with many technical artifacts 

and, therefore, it has not been widely used in recent times. Nevertheless, we find 

significant differences in the percentage of sperm abnormalities in Mus spretus from 

CA zone, comparing to BA zone, but there were no significant differences for 

Apodemus sylvaticus. It is important to refer that this result can be due to the 

reduced number of males Apodemus sylvaticus captured: only six males in CA zone 

and two males in BA zone. In fact, a larger sampler would be essentially for more 

reliable results not only for sperm abnormality assay but also for the other genotoxic 

tests, especially in wild species like these because the variability among animals can 

be higher than in laboratory animals. 

Our study clearly showed that the use of only one cytogenetic end point is not 

sufficient to understand the range of the effects of pesticides on the genetic material 

in an in situ study. However, when other end points are included like in the present 

study, the method can be very promising. Moreover, because of differences in 

sensitivities, it is important to have more than one species for comparison to 

establish a genotoxic profile of one area.   

In situ studies like the present that compares bioindicator species from a 

conventional agriculture zone versus a biological agriculture zone can be extremely 

important in assessing the toxicity of pesticides to humans. Even though the general 

population is not as exposed as animals because they only contact to pesticides 

through the consumption of agricultural products while animals live in the fields and 

are directly subjected to pesticide applications, the evaluation of the toxicological risk 

of pesticides in this way for humans is quite acceptable and more realistic than 

animal laboratory experiments. In fact, it is known that many pesticides are 

transformed in the environment through physical, chemical and biological processes 

which are intended to detoxify them but often the transformation process forms 

products that are more toxic than the parent [52]. Moreover, it is not feasible to 

predict the toxicity of pesticide mixtures on the basis of the results of the toxicity of 

single components because the effects of a mixture of pesticides are often different 

from the individual effects of a single components [53] and human exposure is rarely

82 Chapter II: 4.Discussion of Results 

limited to a single compound. So, in situ studies are obviously closer to the real 

situation and must be considered in the pesticide approval process. 

In conclusion, the present study clearly prove that conventional agriculture 

even with the use of pesticides legally approved in the European community, like 

Mancozeb, represent a higher genotoxic risk compared to biological agriculture. 

Despite all the controversy, biological agriculture has been adopted by an increasing 

number of farmers, like the farmer who collaborated in this study, and they believe 

that this practice has the potential for mass production of the amount of calories 

needed to feed humanity. We do not know if this is possible but it is urgent to find 

and develop alternative and profitable agricultural practices, in order to minimize the 

use of pesticides, which represents a real global problem.

83 Chapter II: 5.Final Remarks 

 

5. Final Remarks  
 

• The present work contributes to alert about hazard effects resulting from pesticide 

exposure, particularly Mancozeb, a pesticide legally authorized for use in European 

community; 

• As revealed by the three cytogenetic endpoints used, Mancozeb is capable of 

inducing DNA damage in Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus species; 

• The use of several tests is essential to have a full picture of the genotoxic effects 

especially in wild species since the variability among animals can be higher than in 

laboratory animals; 

• The use at least two sympatric species to detect the presence of genotoxic agents 

is essential because there may be a difference in sensitivity of the species selected 

as bioindicators in relation to the cytogenetic end points analyzed; 

• Mn quantification seems to be a good biomarker of exposure to Mancozeb and 

more research is needed to validate the metal quantifications as biomarkers of 

exposure to this type of pesticides; 

• The present results provide reference values for the analyzed biomarkers allowing 

future comparisons with other small mammals’ populations. 

• Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus are suitable bioindicator species of pesticide 

pollution, demonstrating variation in morphological, biochemical and genotoxic 

effects of exposure; 

• Finally, despite Mancozeb toxicity, it will belong to the most widely used pesticide in 

the world due to their efficacy, and low relatively low cost and persistence in the 

environment. As a result, a large part of the population will continue to be exposed, 

and concerns for their known and potentially newly discovered adverse effects will 

remain alive.
