Resumo
O Raymond Lemaire International Centre for Conservation da Universidade Católica de 

Lovaina na Bélgica colaborou com a missão arqueológica de Sagalassos para a investigação 
arquitetónica e estrutural e para a preparação do projeto de restauro das ruínas da casa-fonte de 
estilo Helenístico tardio. As escavações arqueológicas em Sagalassos, dirigidas pelo Prof. Marc 
Walkens do departamento de arqueologia da Universidade Católica de Lovaina, começaram 
em 1990. As ruínas da casa-fonte Helenística – Nymphaeum -, do século I a.C. e destruídas por 
um tremor-de-terra no século VI d.C., encontravam-se completamente enterradas em depósitos 
erosivos das montanhas. O edifício, encastrado no declive do terreno tem uma planta retangular de 
10,90 metros de largura por 7,33 metros de profundidade e é orientado a sul. O edifício é composto 
por três pórticos Dóricos desenhando um plano em forma de U. Os pórticos são compostos de 
oito meias colunas adossadas a pilares retangulares e em pilares duplos de canto, estabelecendo 
a partição do espaço em nove partes. As colunas estão pousadas em pedestais que compõem um 
parapeito desenhando as bacias de colecta de água. O entablamento é composto por arquitraves e 
frisos unificados. As cornijas elaboram a cobertura das bacias. A estrutura é inteiramente construída 
em blocos talhados em pedra calcária e aparelhados em junta seca. 

O projeto de restauro utilizando técnicas de anastilose foi proposto para a estrutura de pedra 
do Nymphaeum Helenístico. Os trabalhos desenvolveram-se em quatro fases: 1ª Fase – escavações, 
recolha de informação e documentação do material descoberto. 2ª Fase – anastilose teórica 
de fragmentos e blocos. Estudos, experiências e testes no terreno foram executados de modo a 
desenvolver um conhecimento aprofundado da estrutura original, dos sistemas construtivos, dos 
sistemas de talha da pedra, das técnicas de montagem, etc. 3ª Fase – estudo do posicionamento 
exato dos diferentes blocos na estrutura, reconstituições gráficas. Restauro de fragmentos e blocos 
e consolidação das ruínas in-situ. 4ª Fase – anastilose final e reconstituição do edifício através do 
reposicionamento dos blocos de pedra restaurados nas suas posições de origem e exercendo as 
suas funções estruturais respetivas. O restauro formal, estrutural e funcional do Nymphaeum 
Helenístico tardio terminou a 3 de setembro de 1997.

O presente artigo apresenta os princípios orientadores na escolha das diferentes técnicas de 
restauro utilizadas, e os resultados obtidos. O sistema inovador desenvolvido para o restauro 
dos diferentes blocos de pedra da estrutura do Nymphaeum – um sistema ‘Fibra-de-vidro/
resina epoxídica/pó de pedra’ – dá uma resposta efetiva aos princípios de ‘intervenção mínima’, 
‘compatibilidade de materiais’ e ‘retrocessividade’. O sistema utilizado – ‘Fibra-de-vidro/resina 
epoxídica/pó de pedra’ – pretende: juntar e integrar fragmentos que compõem um só bloco 
transformando fragmentos de pedra em blocos monolíticos estáveis; estabelecer ligações verticais e 
horizontais entre blocos, quando posicionados na estrutura, mais fracas que a pedra. Com este tipo

de sistema pretende-se evitar ligações verticais e horizontais rígidas, o que causaria a destruição 
completa dos blocos, em caso de um tremor de terra de grande magnitude. A retrocessividade do 
sistema é garantida palas dimensões e proporções aplicadas. 

As ações do projeto de anastilose seguiram a vocação da ruína, preservando o monumento, 
reconstituindo a sua forma física, restabelecendo o comportamento estrutural de cada elemento 
e recuperando a função original de fonte. O Nymphaeum hoje, é uma ruína, onde o restauro da 
função e da estrutura criam uma permanente cenografia dependendo do dia e da hora, criando um 

jogo de transparência, cheio e vazio, luz e sombra, som e silêncio.

IntRoductIon 

The R.Lemaire International Centre for Conservation of the K.U.Leuven was involved in the 
architectural and structural Bauforshung of the remains of the Late Hellenistic Nymphaeum on 
the archaeological site of Sagalassos (Patrício [et al.] 1993; Patrício [et al.] 1995), as well as in its 
restoration (Van Balen [et al.] 1995, Ercan [et al.] 1997, Patrício [et al.] 2000). 

Archaeological excavations in Sagalassos started in 1990 under the direction of Prof. Marc 
Waelkens from the Department of Archaeology of the K.U.Leuven, Belgium. When the excavations 
started, the remains of the Nymphaeum dated from the 1st century B.C., were almost completely 
buried under slop deposits from the mountains. During the excavations, a relatively well preserved 
fountain house came to daylight (Waelkens [et al.] 1991, Waelkens [et al.] 1993, Waelkens [et al.] 
1995). The rectangular building, 10.90 m wide and 7.33 m deep, orientated to the south is set into the 
mountains slope. It is constructed in limestone carved blocks in a regular polygonal dry masonry 
arrangement. The fountain is composed by three Doric porticoes in a U-shaped lay-out. The 
porticoes are composed of eight half-columns attached to a rectangular pillar and to corner pillars, 
thus establishing the partition of the space into nine parts. These supports stand on the parapet 
of the water basin. The parapet projects forward below each column to resemble a pedestal. The 
entablature is made up of architraves and friezes together with their cornices. The cornices make 
the roof of the water basins (Patrício [et al.] 1995).

To restore a ruin obliges to the elaboration of a preliminary program based on the values 
assessment of the remains and their cultural significance for the site and for the region. During 
the excavating, it was realised that the structure of the fountain house, a structure made by carved 
stone with dry joints from the late Hellenistic period - a common and everyday building in its times 
- was presenting an inestimable value: nearly all of the architectural elements were present in the 
area of the building (Figure 2) and presenting a good state of conservation together with the in-situ 
remains (Patrício [et al.] 1995). The aim of the project follows the vocation of the ruin: preserving 
the monument by its physical restitution, re-establishing it’s initial and nowadays missing volumes 
by reusing all its original architectural elements and placing them into their original positions. 
(Figure 3, Figure 4) The integrity recovered and its beauty suggested while preserving the original 
structural behaviour of each architectural element. Besides, as the natural water spring still exists, 
the final physical restitution aimed above all to recover the original Nymphaeum vocation by 
restoring its original function of a fountain.

After the preliminary works and excavations at the Nymphaeum, a restoration project applying 
anastylosis techniques was proposed for the stone structure of the Late Hellenistic Nymphaeum. 
The first phase of the work, from 1991 to 1992, included gathering information and preparing the 
discovered material for further restoration (Patrício [et al.] 1993). The second phase began in 1993 
and led to partial anastylosis of some parts of the building with the partial anastylosis of fragments and 
blocks. A preliminary study of the architectural elements in 1992 also allowed the first experiments 
and tests during the campaign of 1993, as well as a detailed study by means of direct investigation. 
It was possible, as a result, to establish relationships among fragments, to determine the general 
shape of the building, (Figure 5, Figure 6) as well as to define the construction techniques, the stone 
carving process, lifting techniques, surface treatment, etc. The third phase began in 1994. Research 
focused on the position in which the stones were found at the time of excavation and on their 
relation with the structure. Graphic restitutions were established (Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8). The 
architectural elements were restored (Ercan [et al.] 1997; Patrício [et al.] 1997). During the campaign 
of 1995, 1996 and 1997, the final anastylosis and reinstatement of the monument reusing the original 
and restored architectural elements was realised. The restoration project of the Late Hellenistic 
Nymphaeum by its formal, structural and functional restitution was completed the 3rd September 
1997. (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4)

RequIRements and pRIncIples foR the InteRventIon

From the generally accepted Venice Charter and current discussions on the guidelines for 
monuments restoration, and especially within the framework of archaeological sites, a number of 
requirements and principles were established and taken into account in every project decisions in 
the international world of monuments restoration. Therefore for the drawing up of the restoration 
project of the late Hellenistic Nymphaeum and for the choices of the various restoration methods it 
was essential to define several principals to be used as project guidelines. They can be summarised 
in the following topics: restitution, authenticity, reversibility, compatibility and retreatability.

The respect and preservation of the original material was our premise to decide the type of 
restoration to be applied to the Nymphaeum. The choice of the restoration techniques was based 
on the principle of a minimum intervention. If the main goal was to preserve its integrity, with the 
respect to the original materials the idea of a reconstruction - new construction of a structure and use 
of new materials - was out of priori. Only a restitution - to reinstate a structure with its original materials 
- could promote correctly the intentions. 

The authenticity of the ruins of the Nymphaeum revealed through the excavations should 
be understood as different levels of significance. Apart from the authenticity of the materials - 
which is easily understood as being the original building material and architectural elements - the 
original structural system, destroyed by an earthquake, also represents a ‘state of understanding’ 
regarding the construction of fountains houses built as trabeated structures. The latter means that 
there is some added value in reassembling the structure as it was originally, instead of creating a 
new structure which would ‘carry’ the architectural elements of the Nymphaeum. The design of the 
intervention aimed to protect the original elements of the structure, rather than just its architectural 
appearance. (Ercan [et al.] 1997, Patrício [et al.] 2000)

Reversibility is a term that has often been used in the conservation of historical heritage. 
At the end of the 20th century this principle was very much applied to architectural restoration. 
An international group of experts came recently to the conclusion that: “...Along with minimum 
intervention, the concept of reversibility has been considered to be one of the principal requirements of 
conservation treatments. However, in the case of the treatment under discussion, reversibility is often not 
achievable and in some instances not applicable. Prompted by the suggestion made by Sasse and Snethlage 
as well as discussions which have long taken place in the field, it was proposed that the requirements of 
reversibility be replaced by the demand for compatibility and retreatability...” (Teutonico [et al.] 1997). 

Simply stated, ‘compatibility’ means that introduced treatment materials will not have negative 
consequences while ‘retreatability’ means that the conservation treatment in the present would not 
prevent or impede further treatment in the future. While in the context of the discussion about 
reversibility mentioned above was mainly in reference to surface treatments, these criteria also 
apply to the treatment carried out on the Nymphaeum. In the context of a structural treatment in an 
earthquake risk-area, this can be translated into the idea that an earthquake should not create more 
damage than damage created by previous earthquakes. It also means that if a next earthquake 
would damage the Nymphaeum structure as in the past, the types of treatments proposed for the 
restoration should at least remain re-executable.

The restruturation of the hellenistic Foundation of Sagalassos in Turkey

RestoRatIon of the stone stRuctuRe - fIeld WoRk

The field works at the Nymphaeum concentrate on the following: archaeological research, 
architectural investigation (detailed survey of the membra disjecta and in-situ remains) (Figure 5, 
Figure 6), restoration of the stone carved blocks (membra disjecta and in-situ remains), replacement 
of missing parts of the structure, consolidation and levelling of the foundations, correction of the 
west wall’s distortion, controlling and canalising the natural water spring with testing of mortars 
for the water basins and final anastylosis of the structure. 

The first problem to solve for the re-erection of the dismembered building was to make up 
sound blocks, as strong as they had been originally. Broken fragments had to be joined together 
and where parts of the blocks were missing they needed to be completed for structural integrity. 
The materials and techniques, after being studied and improved through laboratory tests were 
then applied for the restoration of the fountain house. (Ercan [et al.] 1997) The restoration of the 
stone blocks can be divided into four main activities: joining the broken parts, completing the 
missing parts consolidation and cleaning of the blocks.

Joining of the broken stone blocks

An epoxy-based adhesive mixed with a limestone powder filler was used to glue small 
fragments. By mixing the epoxy adhesive with an inert filler of powdered limestone the strength of 
the adhesion and cohesion has been reduced to almost the strength of the stone itself.

For joining the structurally important broken blocks, such as columns drums, architraves and 
cornices, fibreglass rods were used together with the epoxy adhesive. Two conditions were imposed 
on this work. First, the broken blocks should be joined in such a way that the strength of the 
joined block would not exceed the limit state strength of the monolithic block. Second, if the joined 
block were to break, it should break again in the original failure. To fulfil these requirements, the 
application area of the epoxy glue was limited to only half of the broken surface and the Fiberglas 
reinforcing rods were designed appropriately according to these considerations. The brittle nature 
of the fibreglass is an advantage here, as it means that the reconstruction can be altered at any time 
in the future, as the broken reinforcement can be removed and replaced by a similar system. The 
number, size and length of the reinforcing rods varied according to the broken parts of the block 
and its structural function. For the blocks under flexural stress, like architraves and cornices, the 
rods should have a certain anchorage length, so that they would not be pulled out. Generally 4 
fibreglass rods of 34 cm length and 16 mm diameter were used for joining these blocks (Figure 
8). Shorter rods are sufficient for joining the column drums, as the main structural stress on them 
would be in shear. Generally 4 fibreglass rods of 20 cm length and 12 mm diameter were used to 
join the columns drums.

completing the missing parts of the stone blocks

After joining the fragments composing a block, missing parts had to be completed to fulfil 
the structural integrity. An epoxy mortar obtained by mixing epoxy adhesive with well-graded 
crushed limestone filler was used for this purpose. The maximum particle size of the filler was 2 
mm and the binder to filler ratio of the mortar varied in between 1:5 to 1:8 by volume, according to 
the application. The epoxy mortar, which was tested earlier in the laboratory, has similar physical 
properties to the original stone. Its mechanical properties are slightly weaker than the original 
stone and it also has a more elastic behaviour than the stone.

The epoxy mortar was applied in a few layers, where each layer was compacted firmly. 
According to the volume to fill and the structural function of the block to be completed, fibreglass 
bars were sometimes used for a stronger bond between the epoxy mortar and the stone blocks 
(Figure 10, Figure 11). As epoxy mortars discolour under ultraviolet radiation and in order to create 
a proper surface texture, a 1 to 2 cm thick covering mortar was applied over the dried epoxy fillings 
(Figure 12). The covering mortar was a zinc chloride-based mineral mortar, which was also tested 
in laboratory before being used. This quick setting and non-shrinking covering mortar has a very 
similar colour to the stone and its shape and textures can be finished easily by carving (Figure 15).

structural consolidation of the stone slocks

Structural consolidation was necessary for stone blocks of structural importance that had severe 
cracks. First the stones were detected by inspection and sound testing, then structural consolidation 
was undertaken where necessary by pinning fibreglass rods, anchored by an epoxy grout, through 
the cracks. Fibreglass rods of 7 mm and 8 mm diameter and at least 20 cm length were used. Some 
of the in-situ blocks were also consolidated in-situ using the pinning method. 

non-structural consolidation

The fissured and flaking stone blocks of no structural importance were consolidated in-situ 
by injection of water-porous glue. Different materials were tested and evaluated for this purpose. 
The most important criterion was that the sealed crack should allow water vapour through, so 
that the wet and very fine sand present in the crack could dry, in this way frost damage due to the 
expansion of the water trapped in the crack is avoided. After these consolidations, all the fissures 
and cracks were sealed with a zinc chloride-based covering mortar, to avoid water seeping in, 
which could cause further frost damage. 

cleaning of the blocks 

All the restored blocks were cleaned with cold water under pressure (100 to 200 bars). A 
chemical cleaning method was applied to the biological dirt deposits that did not come off with 
water. A cleaning product “complexion paste” was used for this. The pasta was applied on the 
stone surface with a brush and was covered with a plastic cling-film to prevent drying out. After 
two days the paste was washed away with water under pressure. The cleaning product, which 
does not leave or generate harmful salts on the stone, was tested earlier in laboratory. The final 
cleaning was done after putting the blocks in place. 

replacement of missing parts of the building

The architectural investigation of the fountain house revealed that some complete stone blocks 
from the original structure were missing: wall blocks from the south and west wall, steps blocks 
from the entrance stair, cornices and capitals. Since the start of the project, the principle of minimum 
intervention was a fundamental aspect in our philosophy. Following this principle, it was clear 
that the missing blocks were only replaced by new elements when it was strictly necessary for the 
positioning of an existing one (Figure 17, Figure 18). (Patrício [et al.] 2000: 408)

fragments from the original capital.

Figure 14 – Insertion of original fragments in a new carved capital.

For the replacement of the missing blocks by new elements two problems arose: The 
determination of the shape and proportions of the missing element and the choice of the material 
to produce them. From the study of the existing material it was easy to extrapolate the shape 
and dimensions of the missing elements. Nowadays, different materials are being used in 
various restorations all over the Mediterranean area, such as artificial stone, concrete and stone. 
For structural reasons the missing parts should be on a material with physical and mechanical 
properties similar to the original parts of the structure. It was decided to prepare new wall blocks, 
stairs steps and capitals by carving natural stone, from a quarry in the region and with similar

geological properties. This material is not expensive in Turkey and being a similar material to 
the original allowed us to remain faithful to the materials, construction techniques and structural 
behaviour of the ancient building.

Furthermore, the use of natural stone cannot harm the building, its long-term durability is 
known and it is highly compatible with the original material from an aesthetic and structural point 
of view. (Patrício [et al.] 1997, Patrício [et al.] 2000) As the main goal of the project was to preserve 
the original material it was decided to integrate all the small capitals fragments found into the 
new carved blocks (Figure 13, Figure 14). To improve the aesthetic integration, the final shades 
and decorations of the new carved stones, as well as matching the integrated original fragments, 
were further finished when the new blocks were in their final position on the structure (Figure 
15, Figure 16). The final surface carving was integrated into the ancient one to guarantee a more 
satisfactory aesthetic result without constituting a violation of the principle that the modern parts 
should remain distinguishable from the older ones (Venice Charter: 1964).

The final decorations as well as matching the integrated original fragments were further finished.

the fInal anastylosIs

The architectural research for the existing in-situ remains demonstrated and quantified the 
movement suffered by the structure during its destruction by the earthquakes. The earthquake 
forces induced a movement of the structure in the Southwest / Northeast directions. This resulted 
in the total collapse of the west and east porticoes, in a partial destruction of the west wall and in 
inducing a strong tilt in the wall to the east side and the consequent slipping of the foundations of 
the east and west porticoes. Since the beginning of the excavations and its consequent restoration, 
we wanted to avoid dismantling the still in situ remains of the structure in order to preserve, as 
far as possible, the structure’s original integrity. Therefore, for the reconstitution of the porticoes, 
it was necessary to dismantle the in-situ elements in order to correct their levels and positions. 
The heavily damaged load bearing column bases were consolidated. The foundation level was 
corrected with natural hydraulic lime mortar mixed with small rubble; which provided a correctly 
levelled bed. After replacing the basin parapets the foundations were strengthened by the injection 
of a plastic hydraulic mortar to increase the contact area between the stones of the foundations and 
the stones of the bed rock on which they were placed. 

After stabilising the foundations and column bases it was possible to start the final anastylosis 
of the restored blocks. Originally column drums and capitals were linked by vertical iron dowels 
set in square blocks of lead. The architraves were posed directly on the capital and interconnected 
with P-shaped rectangular iron cramps that were also protected with lead. For the reconstitution 
of the vertical dowels fibreglass dowels of 15 mm diameter and 10 cm length were used, which 
were fixed in the original dowel holes by means of an epoxy grout (Figure 12). For the cramps a 
rolling pin made by a fibreglass mesh was prepared, placed into the original cramp holes and fixed 
also with an epoxy grout. The intention of these dowel and cramp connections is not to create a 
rigid connection, which will cause the crushing of the blocks in case of a severe earthquake’s but 
to protect the original blocks by breaking just before the stone breakage and realising the blocks to 
consume the imposed energy through free movement.

 

the noWadays Image of the nymphaeum

With this paper, we wanted to express the guidelines of our decisions, the reasons for ours 
choices, and the results of our actions concerning the stone restoration. We wanted to express 
how it was possible with a ruin and some 300 stones and fragments to revive the history and the 
structure of the Nymphaeum of Sagalassos. 

The system used for the restoration of the stone blocks of the Nymphaeum - the Fiberglas-
epoxy system - had as main goal to join and integrate the stone elements so that they will be as 
strong as their monolithic form, and when connected in the structure - different stone elements 
connected vertically and horizontally - the connection will be less strong than the stone itself (Ercan 
[et al.] 1997). Having a high mechanical strength, the system makes it possible to strengthen the 
members and the structure itself with minimum intervention. Moreover, the system is compatible 
with the stone because it acts as a unit in itself and as a whole with the stone, creating a perfect 
bond. The retreatability of the system can be guaranteed with the applied dimensions. The starting 
point set by the objective of looking for a repair technique based on conservation principals of 
minimum intervention, compatibility and retreatability has helped to find a new technology much 
more adapted to the requirements formulated in this anastylosis project.

The restruturation of the hellenistic Foundation of Sagalassos in Turkey

Nowadays the Late Hellenistic Nymphaeum presents an inestimable value for the society, 
for the site, for the region, and for the world of archaeological conservation: the recovering of its 
structural integrity, the suggestion of its original beauty, and the salvage of the original Nymphaeum 
function as a fountain.  

Many questions must be considered with the choice of restoring methods and, this makes the 
mission of restoring and presenting architectural ruins so difficult and so engaging. The nowadays 
restitution of the Sagalassos Nymphaeum answers in our point of view, to our premise concerns. 
From the beginning, we knew that at the same time we had to protect the ruin, to prolong its 
existence, to preserve its symbolic character and to make it more readable to the visitor. Today, the 
visitor of Sagalassos will not anymore see a ruin frozen in time with a panel in front. He will see 
again an architectural object; he will understand it in its totality and will repeat the same journey 
as 21 centuries ago - walking from the centre of the city to the Theatre, taking a rest at the fountain 
house to have same fresh and cold water.
