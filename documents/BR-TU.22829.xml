resumo 
 

 

As áreas peri-urbanas representam uma das formas mais importantes de 
desenvolvimento urbano. Aprofundar o conhecimento dos impactes destas 
áreas ao nível dos processos hidrológicos e a sua influência na qualidade da 
água superficial, constitui o principal objetivo deste estudo. O trabalho foi 
desenvolvido numa bacia hidrográfica Portuguesa, com características peri-
urbanas (Ribeira dos Covões), sob a influência do clima Mediterrâneo. 
 
O estudo considera uma abordagem a várias escalas espaciais e temporais, 
envolvendo a realização de medições ao nível das propriedades do solo, 
ensaios em parcelas experimentais e a monitorização à escala da bacia 
hidrográfica e sub-bacias. 
 
Solos associados a diferentes usos apresentam distintas propriedades físicas 
que determinam a capacidades de infiltração de água, bem como os 
mecanismos de geração de escoamento superficial ao longo do ano. Durante 
períodos secos, a natureza hidrofóbica dos solos florestais e dos campos 
agrícolas abandonados, localizados na zona de calcários, promove uma baixa 
capacidade de infiltração da matriz do solo, induzindo a suscetibilidade para a 
geração de escoamento do tipo Hortoniano. Contudo, a reduzida repelência 
nas áreas agrícolas (em zona de arenitos) e as características hidrófilas dos 
solos urbanos promovem uma maior capacidade de infiltração, o que revela o 
potencial destes solos para a infiltração do escoamento gerado em áreas a 
montante. Por outro lado, ao longo do período húmido, a repelência do solo vai 
desaparecendo, o que promove o aumento da capacidade de infiltração, 
principalmente nas áreas florestais. No entanto, o aumento da humidade do 
solo restringe a capacidade de infiltração nos solos agrícolas e urbanos, 
favorecendo a geração de escoamento superficial por saturação, 
principalmente em locais de fundo de vale e em encostas calcárias de solos 
pouco profundos. 
 
As áreas florestais apresentam uma elevada capacidade de infiltração de 
água, mesmo quando a matriz do solo apresenta um elevado carácter 
hidrofóbico, promovida pela presença de macroporos. Todavia, densas 
plantações de eucaliptal são menos favoráveis à infiltração de água do que 
áreas de regeneração natural de eucalipto e zonas de carvalhos, devido à 
maior repelência do solo. 
 
 
 
 
     



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
O padrão climático, nomeadamente a precipitação, determina o regime 
hidrológico das bacias hidrográficas e a qualidade da água superficial. As 
características físicas da bacia, tais como a litologia, também afetam os 
processos hidrológicos, uma vez que determinam a permeabilidade dos solos 
e o regime hídrico das linhas de água ao longo do ano. 
 
Durante o verão, o escoamento de base representa uma componente 
relevante das linhas de água, mas o reduzido caudal promove uma baixa 
capacidade de diluição de poluentes, podendo colocar em causa a qualidade 
da água durante eventos de precipitação, principalmente devido a 
concentrações elevadas de carência química de oxigénio e nutrientes. Ao 
longo da época de chuvas, o aumento da conetividade hidrológica entre as 
fontes de escoamento superficial e de poluentes, origina maiores contribuições 
para as linhas de água. Elevadas cargas de poluentes, nomeadamente sólidos 
em suspensão, metais pesados e azoto, podem colocar em causa a qualidade 
da água superficial durante maiores eventos de precipitação.  
 
De um modo geral, a expansão das áreas urbanas, e particularmente das 
superfícies impermeáveis, promove o aumento dos coeficientes de escorrência 
e origina concentrações médias elevadas de alguns parâmetros que afetam a 
qualidade da água, tais como nitratos e carência química de oxigénio. No 
entanto, os impactes nos recursos hídricos são determinados pela localização 
das fontes dentro da bacia hidrográfica. Fontes de escoamento superficial e 
poluentes localizadas em posições mais elevadas das encostas podem ter um 
efeito negligenciável nas linhas de água, devido às oportunidades de infiltração 
e retenção superficial promovidas pela passagem ao longo da encosta. Por 
outro lado, fontes de escoamento e de poluentes localizadas nas imediações 
das linhas de água originam maiores impactes nos ecossistemas ribeirinhos. A 
presença de sistemas de drenagem de águas pluviais aumenta de forma 
eficiente a conetividade hidrológica dentro da bacia.   
 
Os agentes responsáveis pelo ordenamento do território e o planeamento 
urbano devem considerar a utilização de um mosaico paisagístico constituído 
por diversos usos do solo, de modo a maximizar a infiltração de água e limitar 
a conetividade hidrológica entre as fontes de escoamento e as linhas de água. 
A preservação de um regime hídrico mais aproximado ao de características 
naturais é importante para a minimização do risco de cheia e a degradação da 
qualidade da água.

abstract 

 
Peri-urban areas represent one of the most important development forms. The 
aim of this study is to contribute for an improved knowledge about the impact of 
peri-urban areas on catchment hydrology and surface water quality. The 
research focus on a Portuguese peri-urban catchment (Ribeira dos Covões), 
under Mediterranean climate. 
 
The study is based on a spatio-temporal multi-scale approach, involving the 
measurement of soil properties, runoff plot experiments as well as catchment 
and subcatchments monitoring. 
 
Land-uses have distinct soil properties which provides different infiltration 
capacities and mechanisms for generating overland flow over the year. During 
the summer, the hydrophobic nature of woodland and abandoned agricultural-
limestone fields exhibit low soil matrix infiltration capacity, being prone to 
induce infiltration-excess overland flow. However, wettable urban soils and low 
hydrophobic agricultural fields (overlaying sandstone) have greater matrix 
infiltration capacity, and can provide infiltration opportunities for uphill overland 
flow. On the other hand, throughout wet season, hydrophobicity switches off 
and matrix infiltration capacity increases under woodland soils. But increasing 
soil moisture limit the infiltration capacity of agricultural and urban land-uses, 
favouring saturation-excess overland flow, particularly in valley bottoms and 
hillslope shallow soils overlaying limestone. 
 
Even under widespread hydrophobic conditions in driest settings, woodland 
areas can provide high infiltration through macropores. Nevertheless, dense 
eucalypt plantations are less suitable than open eucalypt stands and woodland 
areas, due to most severe hydrophobicity. 
 
Climate pattern, and particularly rainfall, is the most important parameter 
affecting stream flow and surface water quality. Physical characteristics of the 
catchment, such as lithology are also important in determining soil permeability 
and the temporal stream flow regime.  
 
During the summer, base flow represents a larger percentage of the stream 
discharge, but the limited flow provide minor pollutants dilution during rainfall 
events, mainly chemical oxygen demand and nutrients, which may threaten 
water quality standards. Over the wet season, increasing hydrological   
 
 

            



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
connectivity of overland flow and pollutant sources provide greatest stream flow 
inputs. Enhanced pollutant loads, particularly of suspended sediments, heavy 
metals and nitrogen, can hinder surface water quality during wettest conditions. 
 
Generally, increasing urban land-use extent, and particularly impervious 
surfaces, leaded to enhanced runoff coefficients and high mean concentrations 
of few pollutants, specifically chemical oxygen demand and nitric oxide. 
However, impacts on stream flow are largely dependent on the source position 
across the landscape. Overland flow and pollutant sources located upslope 
may have a minor impact on riverine ecosystems, due to greater infiltration and 
surface retention opportunities provided by downslope areas. Contrary, source 
areas with greater proximity to the stream network would have major impacts. 
The presence of urban drainage system can efficiently favour flow connectivity, 
enhancing the impacts on aquatic ecosystems. 
 
Landscape managers and urban planners should employ a mosaic of different 
land-uses, in order to maximize infiltration and disrupt the flow connectivity 
between sources and stream network. The maintenance of a more natural 
hydrological regime would be important to minimize flood hazard and preserve 
water quality.

LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS

1.1. Research scope  

1.1.1. Peri-urban areas 

Urbanization has been a worldwide tendency over the last decades (e.g. Duh et al., 2008). 

In 2000 year, people living in urban areas represented 47% of the world’s population, and 

75% of European citizens (EEA, 2006). This tendency is expected to continue, with urban 

population reaching 56% of the world, and 80% of European population by 2020 (EEA, 

2006).  

The increase in urban surface area has been even greater than that of the urban population. 

In countries belonging to EU25, urban areas expanded by 78% between 1950s and 1990, 

while population increased only 33% (EEA, 2006). This trend continued until 2000, with 

more than 5% increase in urban areas, associated with a lower 2% growth of urban 

population. This greater increase of urban surface was mainly a result of expansion, 

increased number of households constructed farther away from the city centres (Jansson 

and Terluin, 2009).  

These trends in urbanization have been driven by a mix of forces including both micro 

and macro socio-economic trends, such as improved transportation links and enhanced 

personal mobility, the price of land and individual housing preferences (EEA, 2006). 

People living in the areas surrounding the cities take advantage of more affordable 

accommodation than inner urban areas and better quality of life in certain ways 

(Oyeyinka, 2008).  

The transition zones between completely urban and strictly rural landscape, called peri-

urban areas, are responsible for the increased radius of urbanization spanning from inner 

city areas. The word peri-urban is most often used in Europe and Australia, where it refers 

to land made of a mixture of natural or agricultural lands and urbanised areas. In USA 

and UK, the word suburban is most commonly used, and it generally refers to residential 

areas with houses and gardens, but some urban areas are so large that some suburban 

areas are now distant from urban boundaries and no longer peri-urban.  

Peri-urban areas are characterized by a wide range of population density (more than 40 

inhabitants per km2), larger than in rural areas, and comprises distinct land-uses, 

particularly associated with different urban features, including residential, commercial 

and leisure-related land-uses (Ravetz et al., 2013). These urban settlements may be linked 

to dispersed or constrained, scattered or contiguous developments, demonstrating distinct 

spatial patterns. Due to its complex pattern, peri-urban areas should not be seen as just a 

zone of transition between urban and rural landscape, but rather a new kind of multi-

functional territory (Ravetz et al., 2013). 



 CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION

Peri-urban areas represent a significant part of city land, with almost the same size as 

urban areas across Europe (48,000 km2 and 49,000 km2, respectively) (Piorr et al., 2011). 

As Figure 1.1 shows, it is the dominant form of urbanization of the northeast European 

countries (e.g. Poland and Romania) and some southern ones, like Italy. In Portugal, 

despite peri-urban areas being not so widespread, they represent a significant part of the 

North-Centre and Algarve regions. 

 

Figure 1.1 - Location of peri-urban areas across Europe, and percentage cover of the total area 

(Piorr et al., 2011). 

 

Although most urban areas across the world are now growing relatively slowly at a rate 

of 0.5-0.6% per year (Piorr et al., 2011), but attaining 1.7% per year in developing 

countries (Ravetz, et al., 2013), built development in peri-urban areas is growing at four 

times this rate (Piorr et al., 2011). This trend is expected to continue in the future (Ravetz 

et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2014), even in regions where the population is decreasing. This 

is particularly the case in some European countries such as Portugal, Spain and in some 

parts of Italy (EEA, 2010).  

Considering the current and potential growth of peri-urban areas, it is important to 

develop stormwater management strategies to mitigate the impacts of urbanization on 

both water quantity and quality at the catchment scale. The spatial planning of peri-urban 

areas represents one of the twenty-first century challenges (Ravetz et al., 2013). 

 

1.1.2. Urbanization impacts on hydrochemistry 

1.1.2.1. Hydrological processes 

Urbanization, associated with the conversion of cropland, forestry and grassland into at 

least partly impervious surfaces lead to increasing hydraulic efficiency within the 

catchments. There have been many studies focusing on the hydrologic impacts of urban

areas around the world, identifying changes in: 1) evapotranspiration, due to vegetation 

removal (Carlson and Arthur, 2000; Costa et al., 2003) and precipitation changes, allied 

to the “heat island” effects (Jauregui and Romales, 1996), 2) decreasing infiltration 

capacity following soil compaction and soil water proofing (Carlson and Arthur, 2000), 

3) increasing overland flow and streamflow (Corbetts et al., 1997), and 4) shrinkage of 

groundwater recharge with a corresponding decline in baseflows (Klein, 1979; Smakhtin, 

2001; Llorens and Domingo, 2007).  

The impacts of urbanization on streamflow are also coupled with changes in hydrograph 

shape. Since water storage capacity and evapotranspiration decreases in urbanized 

catchments, more rainfall is available for streamflow and the hydrograph rises more 

abruptly (Sauer et al., 1983; Rhoads, 1995; Changnon and Demissie, 1996; Konrad, 

2002), attaining higher peak flows as imperviousness increase (Espey et al., 1969; 

Changnon and Demissie, 1996; White and Greer, 2006). Greater peak flows are linked to 

decreasing return periods (Brath et al., 2006; Ying et al., 2009; Hawley and Bledsoe, 

2011) and increasing flood hazard (Hollis, 1975; Swanson, 1998; Wijesekara et al., 2012; 

Konrad, 2002; Burns et al., 2005; Chang, 2007; Kjha et al., 2011). Urbanization impacts 

on hydrograph shape are also associated with steep falling limbs (Burns et al., 2005; 

Verbeiren et al., 2013). 

The magnitude of the impacts of urbanization on the water cycle, and particularly on 

streamflow, are highly variable between research studies. Despite consistency as regards 

greater streamflow with increasing impervious surface area, the relationship is not linear. 

Arrigoni et al. (2010) realized that the most heavily modified catchment does not 

necessarily display the most altered flow regime. Using selected catchments in different 

parts of Germany, Tetzlaff et al. (2005) noticed that the magnitude of the flow 

acceleration was more influenced by the physical catchment characteristics, e.g. mean 

slope and mean elevation, than by urban land-use. Differences in the biophysical 

characteristics of the catchment, such as geology, lithology, climate and soil properties 

also affect the hydrological processes, and can mask the influence of land-use changes 

(e.g. Boyd et al., 1993; Konrad and Booth, 2005). Furthermore, recent studies have been 

reporting the influence of urbanization type and its spatial pattern accros the catchment 

on streamflow response (e.g. Leith and Whitfield, 2000; Pappas et al., 2008; Zhang and 

Shuster, 2014). 

Despite several decades of scientific studies focussing on urbanization impacts on 

hydrological processes, peri-urban studies have been few. However, the different 

hydrological responses of distinct land-use patterns within peri-urban catchments provide 

a mix of overland flow sources and sinks, associated with fast and slow water fluxes over 

the landscape. The lack of few hydrological data from peri-urban catchments has been 

limiting the understanding of the impact of the landscape mosaic pattern on rainfall-runoff 

relationships and streamflow response.  



 CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION

Considering the current and potential growth of peri-urban areas, new hydrological data 

are required for improved assessement of the influence of different spatial land-use 

arrangements on flow connectivity. Hydrological connectivity influences water passage 

from one part of the landscape to another, and thereby determines catchment runoff 

response and flood hazards (Bracken and Croke, 2007; Borselli et al., 2008; Callow and 

Smettem, 2009; Lexartza-Artza and Wainwright, 2009).  

During the last decade, the role of hydrological connectivity has become a key issue in 

catchment hydrology, but the spatio-temporal variation of hydrological processes is still 

not well understood (Bracken et al., 2013). In peri-urban areas, flow connectivity 

represents an additional challenge, considering the different hydrological responses of 

distinct land-uses. Forest areas have a high rainfall retention capacity due to interception 

and transpiration process (Legesse et al., 2003; Andréassian, 2004; Delgado et al., 2010), 

whereas agricultural fields are subject to annual harvesting cycles, which influence 

evapotranspiration and soil permeability (e.g. through compaction), and thus runoff 

generation (Martin and Shipitalo et al., 2013). Urban areas are organized in complex 

structures, consisting of built-up and green areas, separated by the street network. 

Different combinations and arrangements of land-uses and types of impervious and 

pervious surfaces within urban areas, affect the ultimate fate of rain during and after 

storms, influencing the amount of runoff produced and the time at which it is delivered 

to other parts of the catchment (Jacobson, 2011). 

Hydrological connectivity is also affected by antecedent weather conditions, particularly 

associated with soil moisture status, which affect storage capacity (Bull et al., 2003; 

Easton et al., 2007). Soil moisture is recognized as a major runoff-controlling factor, 

particularly in regions under Mediterranean climate (Cerdà, 1997). However, soil 

moisture variation is not entirely understood, particularly in urbanizing catchments where 

its spatial and temporal variability are rarely reported (Easton et al., 2007). 

Knowledge of runoff processes and flow connectivity across heterogeneous landscapes, 

and on their temporal variation under contrasting seasonal conditions, such as in a 

Mediterranean climate, is of utmost importance for catchment management. 

Understanding the impacts of land-use pattern on spatio-temporal variation of 

hydrological processes is required to improve urban planning and to support water 

management decisions, particularly within peri-urban catchments. 

 

1.1.3. Surface water quality 

Human interference in the natural environment, particularly through urbanization, also 

influences streamflow chemistry. Different land-uses such as woodland, agriculture and 

urban areas, residential, commercial and industrial uses, with different proportions of

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     

 

7 

impervious and pervious surfaces (e.g. lawns and gardens) generate runoff with specific 

physical-chemical characteristics.  

Land-use properties determine the ability to absorb, release and/or transport different 

concentrations and loads of chemical substances, such as nutrients, heavy metals, 

microorganisms, pesticides and hundreds of organic contaminants, such as hydrocarbons, 

hormones, antibiotics, surfactants, endocrine disruptors, human and veterinary 

pharmaceuticals (e.g. Goonetilleke et al., 2005; Pal et al., 2014). All these pollutants 

affect the physical, chemical, and biological health of a stream, with negative 

consequences for biological habitat, aesthetic value of natural watercourses, and utility of 

water for different purposes, such as human consumption and irrigation, linked to health 

hazards (Hammer, 1972; Arnold and Gibbons, 1996; Paul and Meyer, 2001; Brilly et al., 

2006).  

Many studies have focused on the impact of different land-uses, particularly agricultural 

activities, and point source discharges on water quality (Compton et al., 2000; Kulabako 

et al., 2007; Gooddy et al., 2014). Vegetated areas, such as forestry, cultivated fields and 

lawns are frequently associated with higher nutrient contributions to the streamflow 

(Steuer et al., 1997; Goonetilleke et al., 2005; Groffman et al., 2009), whereas impervious 

surfaces within urban areas and particularly industrial zones are prone to increase levels 

of nutrients in rivers and streams (Herngren et al., 2004; Pitt and Maestre, 2005; Zhang 

et al., 2007; Li et al., 2012). It is usually accepted that pollutant load increase directly 

with the percentage of total impervious area (TIA), and several authors have been 

considering this parameter has an indicator of the ecological and environmental 

conditions of an aquatic system (Schueler, 1994; Arnold and Gibbons, 1996; Paul and 

Meyer, 2001; Morse et al., 2003; Kuusisto-Hjort and Hjort, 2013). However, a wide range 

of water quality impacts resulting from land-use changes, particularly urbanization, has 

been reported.  

Surface water quality is driven not only from land-use type but also from land-

management, such as fertilizer and manure application (Gross et al., 1990; Easton and 

Petrovic, 2004; Khai et al., 2007; Antonious et al., 2008). The location of pollutant 

sources within the catchment and the connectivity with the stream network, driven by the 

spatial distribution of different land-uses and the presence or absence of urban drainage 

system, have been considered as an important parameter determining water quality 

impacts (Booth and Jackson, 1997; Brabec et al., 2002; Ouyang et al., 2009). In urban 

catchments, the connectivity issues can be far more important for water quality than 

percentage of impervious surface (Brabec et al., 2002; Wickham et al., 2002; Carey et al., 

2011). Furthermore, catchment properties, such as lithology, influence not only the runoff 

processes and flow connectivity, but can also inprint specif physical-chemical properties 

on runoff, which affect water quality (Bricker and Jones, 1995; Richards et al., 1996).  



 CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION 

 

 

8 

The variation of surface water quality and pollutant loads is also a function of climatic 

factors including rainfall, which influence streamflow variability and thus pollutant loads 

(Goonetilleke et al., 2005; Thompson et al., 2012; Rodríguez-Blanco et al., 2013). 

Antecedent weather conditions also affects pollutant deposition at the catchment surface, 

resulting mainly from atmospheric deposition, particularly important due to 

anthropogenic emissions, such as vehicular traffic and industrial emissions (Bernhardt et 

al., 2008; Apeagyei et al., 2011). The length of antecedent dry period (ADP) influences 

the amount of pollutants available to be washed-off during rainfall events, with impacts 

on streamwater quality (Marsalek, 1976; Vaze and Chiew, 2002; Qin et al., 2013).  

Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamic of runoff sources and its physical-chemical 

properties, as well as how connectivity governs pollutants transfer during and between 

rainfall events, is limited. Despite several studies focused on the relation between land-

use and pollutant loadings, as well as the interactions between multiple land covers within 

a single catchment, outcomes to date have been inconclusive, particularly because of 

relatively scarce hydrologic and water quality data, and thus making it difficult to identify 

cause–effect relationships. However, knowledge on pollutant buildup and wash-off 

processes in distinct land-uses is a key research need.   

Further investigation is required to better assess the impact of the landscape mosaic on 

surface water quality, particularly in peri-urban areas. This knowledge should guide 

decision-makers and policy actor on sustainable solutions for water quality management, 

in order to attain the “good ecological status” of rivers, as imposed by the European Water 

Framework Directive (WFD, 2000). The information of pollutant source areas is 

fundamental to develop and implement cost-efficient strategies to improve water quality, 

and to move beyond the dependency on customary structural measures and end-of-pipe 

solutions and prevent water quality problems at the catchment and urban planning scale. 

 

1.2. Aim and objectives 

The main aim of this research is to contribute to assess the impact of a mosaic of different 

land-uses on overland flow processes and its contribution to surface hydrology and 

streamwater quality in a Mediterranean climate and socioeconomic setting. The study 

focuses on a peri-urban catchment in Portugal, where this subject has been poorly 

investigated. The specific objectives are, for this peri-urban context: 

1. Assess the spatio-temporal variability of soil hydrological properties in different 

land-uses of the mosaic; 

2. Investigate how and why overland flow processes and its spatial pattern change 

over the year, as a result of the seasonal Mediterranean climate;

3. Assess the impact that different landscape patterns, marked by different extent and 

location of urban areas, have on flow connectivity and stream discharge, and also on 

streamwater quality; 

4. Provide some guidelines to improve land management and urban planning on peri-

urban catchments, in order to minimize flood hazards and water quality degradation. 

 

1.3. Research design 

The research is based on Ribeira dos Covões study site, a small peri-urban catchment 

undergoing rapid urbanization due to its proximity to Coimbra city centre, the largest city 

in the central part of Portugal. The main elements of the research design are shown in 

Figure 1.2. In order to fulfil the objectives regarding to the quantification of the 

hydrological processes, a combined approach of field data acquisition and analysis was 

adopted at different scales: pedon, plot and catchment. This inclusive methodology 

provides a better understanding of the rainfall-runoff processes and the impacts on 

catchment hydrology. Spatio-temporal variation of surface water quality was assessed 

using the same multi-scale approach, but focusing on the sub-catchment and catchment 

scales.

 CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION

At the Pedon scale, in order to assess the land-use impact on soil hydrological properties, 

a network of 31 sites was established focussing on six distinct landscape (land-

use/lithology) units. The number of selected sites per landscape unit was a function of 

their representativeness within the catchment: 11 sites in woodland, 9 being on sandstone  

and 2 on limestone; 2) 11 sites in agricultural fields, including 5 on sandstone and 6 on 

limestone; and 3) 9 sites on unpaved urban soils, comprising 4 on sandstone and 5 on 

limestone. Over a one-year period, nine monitoring campaigns were carried out. These 

assessed the variability of surface soil matrix infiltration capacity, surface soil moisture 

content (0-50 mm) and hydrophobicity at different depths (0 mm, 20 mm and 50 mm) 

within the distinct landscape units. Spatial patterns of non-transient soil properties were 

also analysed at each site: bulk density, organic matter content, particle size and rock 

fragment content.   

At the Plot scale, spatio-temporal variability of overland flow processes was explored 

through the installation and monitoring of runoff plots (8m×2m). However, the absence 

of landowners’ authorization to install plots in agricultural and urban soils, restricted the 

study to woodland areas. Considering the representativeness of woodland areas within 

Ribeira dos Covões catchment, the study investigated the rainfall-runoff relationship in 

the three most representative woodland types: 1) dense eucalypt plantations; 2) sparse 

eucalypt stands; and 3) a relic of semi-natural oak woodland. Three replicated plots per 

woodland type were considered. Overland flow depth was measured at 1- to 2-weekly 

intervals, depending on rainfall events, during two hydrological years. To better 

understand spatio-temporal differences of overland flow, additional measurements of 

throughfall (manual gauges), soil moisture (0-100 mm) and hydrophobicity (0 mm, 20 

mm and 50 mm depth) were performed at the same time as overland flow measurements.  

The land-use impact on streamflow was assessed at the sub-catchment and catchment 

scales. Data at the catchment scale was derived from a continuos flow gauging station 

that had been established in 2008 at the catchment outlet. In order to assess the impact of 

different landscape patterns, characterized by different land-uses and urbanization styles, 

the hydrological and meteorological network was extended by eight additional raingauges 

and eight water-level recorders to provide continuous data records at the sub-catchment 

level. Discharge differences were evaluated through 1) annual and monthly flows, by 

runoff coefficient and baseflow index examination, and 2) analysis of individual rainfall 

events, in terms of flow depth, runoff coefficient, surface runoff coefficient, peak flow, 

response and recession time. A detailed characterization of the land-uses and the urban 

areas within each sub-catchment was performed, in order to enable the impact of flow 

connectivity to be explored. This strategy also enabled the roles of climatic variability on 

streamflow of different lithological units (sandstone vs limestone) to be explored. 

The impact of land-use pattern on water quality was also assessed through several water 

samples collected in four sites of the stream network. Samples were taken at the

catchment outlet and in three sub-catchments with distinct land-uses (urban areas ranging 

between 9-25% and 50%) at different times during eight rainfall events of differing 

magnitude and antecedent weather.  

The integrated approach of this methodology was considered to provide a better 

understanding of the spatio-temporal variation of overland flow sources and sinks over 

the landscape and the influence on streamflow. This knowledge was used in the thesis to 

provide guidelines for urban planning and catchment management, in order to minimize 

flood hazards and maintain a good water quality status, through flow connectivity breaks 

between the potential sources and the stream network. 

 

1.4. Thesis structure 

Subsequent to this introductory chapter (Chapter 1), this manuscript is divided into six 

additional chapters. Chapter 2 was based on literature review and presents the state of the 

art regarding land-use impacts driven by urbanization on hydrology and surface water 

quality. Chapters 3-5 present and analyse the results of the programme aimed at 

quantification of surface hydrological processes in Ribeira dos Covões. 

Chapter 3 is focused on the spatio-temporal variability of soil hydrological properties. 

Differences in soil moisture, hydrophobicity and soil matrix infiltration capacity were 

measured over one year, in different land-uses (woodland, agricultural and urban) 

overlaying sandstone and limestone lithologies. These results are analysed in terms of 

potential overland flow sources and sinks within the catchment, and how they may change 

over the year, as a result of contrasting seasonal patterns associated with Mediterranean 

climate.  

Chapter 4 is dedicated to the field experiments carried out in woodland areas of Ribeira 

dos Covões over two years, analysing overland flow differences between dense eucalypt 

plantations, sparse eucalypt stands and oak woodland. Temporal variation of overland 

flow processes between dry and wet seasons are discussed based on soil moisture and 

hydrophobicity variation. The potential impact of different woodland patches as sources 

and sinks of overland flow in peri-urban catchments is also addressed.  

The influence of land-use pattern on streamflow (sub-catchment and catchment scale) are 

investigated in Chapter 5. The influence of urban areas, characterized by distinct extent 

cover, proportion of soil sealing, distance to the stream network and dissimilar water 

management strategies, on stream discharge (e.g. runoff coefficients, flow depth, peak 

flow, response and recession times) are analysed and discussed. The influence of climate 

variability and lithology on catchment hydrological response is also analysed. Spatio-

temporal differences in the flow regime are discussed in terms of flow connectivity. 



 CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION 

 

 

12 

Current problems of water drainage systems within the catchment are stressed, and the 

implications of the forecasted urbanization trend on flood hazard are pondered.   

Chapter 6 focuses on the impact of rainfall pattern on water quality. Physical-chemical 

properties of distinct drainage areas within the peri-urban catchment are presented. The 

impact of different rainfall events on physical-chemical properties of surface water are 

assessed in relation to Portuguese standards for minimum environmental water quality. 

The results are analysed and discussed in terms of differences in the urbanization type.   

The chapters focusing on field data analysis (Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6) are structured in the 

format of individual scientific publications. Thus they each comprise a small introduction 

to the covered content, a study site description focusing the most relevant aspects 

regarding to that chapter, the methodology used to achieve the specific objectives, the 

associated results as well as their analyses and discussion, and the key conclusions. 

Because of this structure, the introductory sections involve partial repetition, although 

focussing on specific topics. 

Chapter 7 summarises the main findings of the thesis. It then provides some suggestions 

to improve stormwater management in the study site, as well as guidelines to improve 

general land management and urban planning at the catchment scale, in order to minimize 

flood hazard and preserve surface water quality. The challenges and limitations of the 

research are also discussed. 

A consolidated list of references for the entire thesis is provided. Thus, to avoid repetition, 

individual lists for Chapters 3-6 were not presented, despite their scientific paper structure 

in all the other aspects.

LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS

2.1. Introduction 

Population growth has been driven a global urbanization trend, associated with great 

environmental pressure, particularly as a result of land-use changes. The conversion of 

natural landscapes into agricultural fields and impervious surfaces can substantially affect 

hydrological processes at several scales and the equilibrium of aquatic ecosystems. The 

increasing tendency for urban sprawl from the urban cores, associated with a low-density 

development, is a major factor in the acceleration of the extent to which impervious 

surfaces come to dominate the landscape (Zhang and Shuster et al., 2014).  

Over the last 50 years, land-use change impacts on water cycle have been widely 

monitored and documented, but the studies focusing the impact on water quality are more 

recent. Human activities and different land surface covers affect water yields, interception 

losses, evapotranspiration rates, flood peaks, sediment transport rates, and concentrations 

and loads of many water quality constituents.  

Nevertheless, these consequences are not only affected by the spatial extent of land-use 

changes, but tend to be also site-specific, particularly due to the influence of climate on 

temporal variation of the hydrological processes (e.g. Cerdà, 1997; Cammeraat, 2002; 

Easton et al., 2007). Field observations and measurements are undoubtedly the base to 

understand human effects on the hydrological cycle and water quality issues. Recent 

improvements in data collection, data archiving, data distribution and computational 

capabilities to support such analyses represent important parameters to enhance 

knowledge about land-use impacts. However, it has proven to be quite challenging to 

draw conclusions from studies due to relatively short time series and great local spatial 

variation in parameters, such as geology, lithology and soil depth (Calvo-Cases et al., 

2003; Güntner and Bronstert, 2004; Komatsu et al., 2011; Lorz et al., 2007; Hardie et al., 

2012).     

The consequences of land-use changes are of interest not only for the academic 

community, particularly hydrologists and ecologists, but are also of critical importance 

for land management and urban planners. The proper planning of landscape pattern and 

runoff management, associated with flood control measurements, as well as protective 

actions to ensure water quality standards and thus, public health and environmental 

protection, are critically dependent on the understanding of human impacts at the 

catchment scale. There is a clear trend towards approaches that attempt to restore pre-

development flow-regimes and water quality simultaneously. There has been an 

increasing recognition that restoring a more natural water balance benefits not only the 

environment, but enhances the “liveability” of the urban landscape (Fletcher et al., 2013).    

The main goal of this chapter is to present a synthesis of a wide-ranging literature on the 

effects of land-use change, particularly associated with urbanization on (1) hydrological 

processes and (2) surface water quality.

2.2. Hydrological consequences of land-use change focusing 

on urbanization/peri-urbanization  

2.2.1. Methodologies to assess hydrological impacts at the catchment 

scale 

The methods used by researchers to assess impacts of land-use change on the hydrological 

response of catchments, may be grouped into: 1) paired catchment monitoring, 2) time 

series analysis, and 3) hydrological modelling. The first approach is based on the 

comparison of adjacent catchments with different degrees of urban development and 

under similar climate settings, as well as similar geological characteristics. However, this 

methodology has been mostly applied in small catchments, given the difficulty to find 

two similar catchments with medium or large sizes. The use of one catchment has been 

also considered if it contains areas with different land-uses, but spatial differences in 

physical characteristics of the catchments are limiting to the conclusions. Increasingly, a 

“double comparison” approach has been adopted by including a “control” catchment in 

which there has been no land-use change in the study period, but which has had the same 

land-use history as the ones undergoing change. 

The data exploration approach is based on statistic time-series analysis of hydrological 

data from areas undergone urbanization. Different studies focused on few years of 

streamflow data (e.g. Huang et al., 2008; Wijesekara et al., 2012), whereas other studies 

are based on a few decades of records (e.g. Mungai et al., 2004; Leopold et al., 2005). 

Several parameters have been considered by different authors to assess the impact of 

urbanization on streamflow regimes, including statistical tests and characterisation of 

high and low flows. Braud et al. (2013) reviewed the methods applied for streamflow 

analysis, and extracted five classes of indicators used to examine the impact of land-

use/land cover change on discharge time series. These are 1) parameters related to 

hydrological regime, such as annual runoff, seasonal components, discharge quantiles and 

flow duration curves; 2) high flows characterization, focussing on annual maximum 

discharge and peak flows; 3) low flow indicators, such as minimum annual discharge, 

frequency of zero discharge, baseflow index (defined as the ratio between annual 

baseflow and total annual flow); 4) hydrograph analysis, including the study of event 

characteristics (runoff coefficient, rising and falling limbs of hydrographs) and the 

quantification of flow components into baseflow, interflow and quick flow; and 5) 

indicators based on statistical analysis of long time series, in order to compare differences 

between various periods as well as trend analysis.  

Since controlled field-scale experiments are difficult to perform because of land-use and 

climate changes, numerical models have been widely implemented to predict the 

hydrological consequences of these alterations and to anticipate the impact of future 

global changes (e.g. DeFries and Eshleman, 2004; Delgado et al., 2010). These methods 

mostly rely on either simple or lumped, distributed or conceptual hydrological modelling

17 

(Wijesekara et al., 2012). However, models are subjected to uncertainties in their 

structure, inputs, and parameter estimation so that the measure of their reliability is always 

questionable (Zhang and Shuster, 2014). For example, Bhaduri et al. (2001) compared 

modelling results from the L-THIA (Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment) model 

with the SWMM (Stormwater Management Model) in two small catchments in Chicago. 

Results indicated that L-THIA predicts annual average runoff between 1.1 and 23.7% 

higher than SWMM.  

Differences between modelling results reinforce the need for field data in order to 

improve model efficiency. In addition, the choice of model is always limited by available 

data, computing capabilities and thorough knowledge of the catchment hydrology (Chu 

et al., 2013). A review of different hydrological models used to assess the impacts of land-

use changes was performed by DeFries and Eshleman (2004). Recently, the Peri-Urban 

Model for landscape Management (PUMMA) was specifically designed to study the 

hydrology of peri-urban catchments. This model combines rural and urban hydrological 

models, and is used for process understanding (Jankowfsky et al., 2012). 

 

2.2.2. Urbanization impacts on catchment hydrology  

The process of urbanization leads to changes on the water cycle. As an area becomes 

dominated by impervious surfaces, decreasing evapotranspiration and soil infiltration 

capacity lead to increasing surface runoff and enhanced hydraulic efficiency over the 

landscape, promoting a decreasing groundwater recharge. Nevertheless, the magnitude of 

such impacts varied greatly among study sites. Some examples are given below.  

Based on modelling results, increasing urban surface from 20 to 100% in U.S.A 

catchments leads to a 50% increase in total runoff and a 50% reduction in actual 

evapotranspiration and percolation to groundwater (Albrecht, 1974). In contrast, in 

Canada, a 65% increase of built-up areas in southern Alberta, was calculated to provide 

decreases of only 1% and 2.3% in total evapotranspiration and water infiltration, 

respectively. These changes led to a 7.3% increase in stream runoff, but also to a 13.2% 

decrease in baseflow, resulting in a total flow decrease of 4% (Wijesekara et al., 2012).  

In the Southern River catchment, Western Australia, 20% urbanization of a natural area 

fomented a significant reduction in evaporative losses from the soil profile, and a decrease 

from nearly 80% to less than 20% in infiltration, causing a decrease on water table after 

urbanization. In addition, increases in total annual discharge were associated with a 

predicted runoff coefficient rise from 1% to more than 40%. However, increased 

streamflow was mainly due to higher groundwater recharge and subsequent catchment 

baseflow, as a result of the roof and road runoff infiltration and establishment of 

subsurface drainage adopted in local construction practices (Barron et al., 2012).

HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW

Other studies also reported greater impacts of imperviousness on surface flow than on 

total streamflow (Choi et al., 2003; Li and Wang, 2009). A comparison between 

streamflow of a mixed land-use catchment and an urban catchment in the Portland 

Metropolitan Area of Oregon, USA, reported significant increases in runoff during storm 

events rather than increases in mean annual runoff (Chang, 2007). In Dardenne Creek 

catchment, Missouri, the urban area increase from 3.4% to 27.3% was accomplished by 

a modelling forecast of &gt;70% increase in average direct runoff (Li and Wang, 2009). 

In Leipzig, Germany, modelling analysis of available data demonstrated increased storm 

flow with the extent of impervious land, but storm flow increased less severely where the 

soil had a poor infiltration capacity before it was surfaced, depending on soil texture. Only 

when the impervious area reached 20% of the surface, did storm flow values start to 

double, since before that impervious threshold there were still sufficient un-built surfaces 

in which the precipitation could percolate and infiltrate. When the surface was largely 

unsurfaced, annual storm flow was of the order of 25-150 mm, but reached 200 mm when 

imperviousness amounted to 40–60%, and attained more than 300 mm when 

imperviousness exceeded 80% of the area (Haase, 2009). 

Based on Gwynns Falls catchment near Baltimore, Brun and Band (2000) found a 

threshold of 20-25% impervious cover was necessary to identify changes in runoff 

coefficient. Also Hawley and Bledsoe (2011) found from the analysis of 43 gauging 

stations installed on urban streams within semi-arid southern California, that with more 

than 20% imperviousness, streamflow experienced five times as many days of mean daily 

flows higher than 3 m3 s-1 and approximately three times as many days of the order of 30 

m3 s-1 relative to the undeveloped setting.  

In Accotink Creek, Virginia, Jennings and Jarnagin (2002) identified statistically 

significant increases in mean daily streamflow response when impervious cover increased 

from 13% to 21%, associated with mean and extreme daily precipitation levels. Analysis 

of historical mean daily streamflow also revealed a decrease in the precipitation amount 

required to produce a given level of streamflow. However, Burns et al. (2005) reported a 

300% increase in mean peak discharges for a catchment with only 11% impervious 

surface compared with a similarly sized catchment with no impervious surface.  

Increasing frequency of high flow events resultant from urbanization was also reported 

in other studies, accompanied by a decreasing frequency of low-flow events. In the Big 

River catchment, in east-central Missouri, a three fold increase in urban area in 15 years 

resulted in a 140% increase of high flow events, as well as a decrease in frequency of low 

flow events by up to 100% (Chu et al., 2013). 

In Atlanta Metropolitan Area, Georgia, USA, a comparative study of streamflow 

characteristics of non-urbanized, less-urbanized and highly urbanized catchments, 

exhibited 30–100% greater peak flows in the latter. In the highly urbanized catchment,

19 

shorter storm recession period (1–2 days less than in the other catchments) and baseflow 

recession constants (35-40% decrease), were attributed to the more efficient routing of 

stormwater and the paving of groundwater recharge areas (Rose and Peters, 2001).  

In the Tanshui catchment, Taiwan, urban development from 4.8% to 12.5% led to 

shortened times to peak flow from 9 to 6h, and the recurrence intervals of 200, 100, 50, 

and 25 years before urbanization were reduced to about 88, 33, 16, and 8 years (Huang et 

al., 2008). However, in the Mid-Atlantic Region, Jarnagin (2007) reported a 20% 

development has a 'hard limit' (with 10% imperviousness) without significant changes in 

stream hydrology, particularly on stream flashiness.  

Rogers and DeFee (2005) suggested that when urban development exceeds 25% of the 

catchment area, the potential for floods and droughts increases exponentially. Increased 

flood frequency was also demonstrated in the streamflow records of six urbanized basins 

in Puget Lowlands, Washington, subject to distinct degrees of urbanization (Moscrip and 

Montgomery, 1997). Generally, events of 10-year recurrence interval in pre-urbanization 

stage, were shortened to 1 to 4-year recurrence interval events in post-urbanization 

records.  

Some authors also suggest that urbanization mainly affects the flow peaks of smaller 

events with higher frequency, and have only a minor impact on larger storm events. In 

the Apennines of Itally, a 5% urbanization of a meadow and pasture region over a 20 

years period, showed a greater incidence of lower return period discharges, but only small 

increase in peak flows of 10 and 200 years return periods.  

In Xitiaoxi catchment, China, modelling results revealed that for an urban area increase 

from 9% to 17% of the catchment, the expected peak flow increase was 3.9%, 2.7% and 

2.3% associated with recurrence intervals of 10, 50 and 100 years. For the same 

recurrence intervals and for a scenario of urban area increase from 9% to 14%, the peak 

flow increases were 3.3%, 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively (Ying et al., 2009). In Qinhuai 

River catchment in Jiangsu Province, China, an increase in impervious surface from 2.3% 

to 13.9% led to daily peak discharge rise from 2.3% to 13.9%, but also indicated greater 

impacts associated with smaller than larger rainfall events (Du et al., 2012). 

The long-term observation of urban growth and sprawling land consumption has proven 

that it is the cumulative impact of land-use change and surface sealing, rather than short-

term consequences of construction that is likely to impair the urban water balance. 

However, research along 47 southeastern Wisconsin streams found that baseflow 

declined significantly when catchment imperviousness exceeded a threshold range of 8 

to 12% (Wang et al., 2011). In Philadelphia catchments, baseflow declined steadily until 

catchment imperviousness reached 40% to 50% (Hammer, 1972).

Detailed reviews of the urban impacts on catchments hydrology are given by Shuster et 

al. (2005), Jacobson (2011) and Fletcher et al. (2013), but a synthesis of streamflow 

variation resultant from urbanization is shown on Figure 2.1.

from Fletcher et al., 2013). 

 

2.2.3. Overland flow processes and flow connectivity over the 

landscape 

Despite a large degree of consencus between hydrological studies focusing on 

urbanization impacts on the water cycle, particularly on streamflow changes, magnitudes 

of impact vary and differ concerning the existence of an urban cover threshold. These 

variations may be a consequence of differences in (1) the spatio-temporal pattern of runoff 

processes generated within the catchments, and (2) the flow connectivity between sources 

and the stream network.  

In urban and peri-urban catchments, overland flow can occur on both pervious and 

impervious surfaces. Pervious surfaces can generate infiltration-excess overland flow 

(Hortonian flow) when precipitation intensity exceeds the soil infiltration capacity 

(Horton, 1933). It depends on soil properties, such as unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, 

which may be an important predictor of runoff timing and volume (Shuster et al., 2005). 

Urban soils are usually associated with lower infiltration capacity, due to physical 

degradation through compaction, linked to increased soil bulk density and decreased 

porosity (Dornauf and Burghardt, 2000; Yang and Zhang, 2011). Infiltration-excess 

mechanism is very important not only in pervious urban surfaces, but also in bare soils 

and cultivated areas, where significant soil crusting and/or surface sealing occurs during 

rain events (Steenhuis et al., 2005).

During wet periods, overland flow can be also generated in saturated areas of permeable 

soils. It is driven by rainfall amount and antecedent weather conditions (Dixon and Earls, 

2012) and is dependent on landscape factors such as shallow soil depth (affects available 

water storage capacity), slope concavities and hollows (Walter et al., 2000; Steenhuis et 

al., 2005). This saturation mechanism is mainly important in humid and well vegetated 

regions (e.g. Dunne and Black, 1970). 

Impervious surfaces, such as roads and roofs, are prone to generate overland flow, given 

their small storage capacity and smooth surface (Albrecht, 1974). Road surfaces in UK 

cities were found to infiltrate only 6 to 9% of the rainfall, depending on the nature of the 

surface, subsurface layers, level of traffic, etc. (Rabag et al., 2003). However, if overland 

flow from impervious surfaces flows onto pervious surfaces, it may infiltrate before 

reaching the catchment drainage network (Boyd et al., 1993). Thus, streamflow response 

will depend on the extent and distribution of impervious and pervious surfaces, as well as 

the connectivity between land surface and the drainage network, driven by the spatial 

form and location of different land-uses (Hawley and Bledsoe, 2011; Jacobson, 2011; 

Mejía and Moglen, 2009; Parikh et al., 2005).  

Slopes can therefore behave as a mosaic of runoff and run-on areas, providing non-

uniform infiltration. On each surface, interception and depression storage must be 

satisfied before overland flow commences. Initial losses are known to be small on 

impervious surfaces (Melanen and Laukkanen, 1981; Pratt et al., 1984; Jensen, 1990), but 

larger on pervious areas (Boyd et al., 1993). As a consequence, overland flow from 

pervious sites is more difficult to predict than runoff from impervious surfaces, because 

it depends on land-use, soil properties, geology, surface topography, as well as antecedent 

wetness. These factors influence the landscape structure and spatial organisation of a 

catchment which, in turn, determine the distribution of water flow paths, the patterns of 

water storage and residence time distributions (Soulsby et al., 2006).   

When rainfall intensity exceeds infiltration capacity and/or the soil become saturated, the 

excess water remains on the surface and partly fills depressions. If rain persists, 

depressions become filled and overland flow occurs, connecting adjacent depressions. 

With additional rainwater, more and more depressions become connected and a network 

of flow paths is eventually formed and may reach the outflow boundary (Darboux et al., 

2001). If rainfall has occurred prior to an event, soil moisture stores will be part full and 

the water retention capacity is lower (Boyd et al., 1993).  

A simulation study performed by Liu et al. (2006) demonstrated than in Steinsel 

catchment, Luxembourg, the overland flow coefficient and runoff partitioning from 

different land-use areas vary from one storm event to another due to the differences in 

soil moisture and storm characteristics. Increasing overland flow with greater soil 

moisture was also reported in a small catchment located in a suburban area near Nantes, 

France, where base flow represented on average 14% of the total per-event streamflow,

22 

but increased to average 36% during rainfall events (Berthier et al., 2004). These studies 

also show that the pervious part of a catchment may contain source areas which generate 

most of the runoff, with little runoff coming from the remaining pervious areas.  

The presence of vegetation and litter increases soil roughness (soil irregularities and 

cavities) and therefore depression storage capacity (hydraulic resistance), which may 

provide local water storage capacity and aid infiltration, by providing runoff obstructions 

and delaying or eliminating overland flow transfer downslope (Darboux et al., 2001; 

Calvo-Cases et al., 2003; Bracken and Croke, 2007; Borselli et al., 2008; Rodríguez-

Caballero et al., 2012). The capacity of the vegetation to reduce runoff volume and 

velocity depends on: (a) the plant cover/biomass (Kirkby et al., 2002) and its 

characteristics (width and slope of the vegetation strip, vegetation height, density, 

stiffness and species composition); (b) the inflow (runoff velocity, discharge, and 

volume); and (c) the antecedent weather conditions (López-Vicente et al., 2013). 

Vegetation creates a mixture of run-off and run-on sites determined by soil wetness 

(Castillo et al., 2003), reason why it has been considered by many authors as a key factor 

interrupting hydrological connectivity (e.g. Bracken and Croke, 2007).  

In urbanized areas, vegetation is cleared and the soil surface is often graded, depressions 

are filled and impervious surfaces are extended. This leads to decreased depression 

storage capacity and a concomitant decline in natural sinks for water infiltration. As a 

consequence, larger volume of water is available for overland flow, reaching higher 

velocities due to water resistance reduction at the surface. In addition, overland flow 

amount and velocity is also a function of the slope, since gentle slopes favour infiltration 

but also lead to easier saturation due to the influence of throughflow, whereas steep slopes 

lead to larger amounts of overland flow (Bronstert et al., 2002).  

 

2.2.4. Influence of spatial land-use pattern  

Considering the relevance of the extent and location of pervious and impervious surfaces 

to overland flow and runoff generation, the understanding and quantification of the 

hydrological impacts of urbanization require a detailed characterization of different land 

covers (Shuster et al., 2005; Mouri et al., 2011; Berezowski et al., 2012). Several methods 

have been used to analyse the spatial arrangement of land-uses and imperviousness within 

catchments, as can be found in the reviews by Jacobson (2011) and Weng (2012).  

The distance between overland flow sources (pervious soils and/or impervious surfaces) 

and the drainage network (main channel or tributaries) represents an important parameter 

influencing streamflow response (e.g. Wang et al., 2000). Source areas located close to 

the drainage network can be significant contributors to runoff, while those located further 

away may provide no or only a minor impact on streamflow, due to the greater

23 

opportunities for surface flow retention and infiltration over the hillslope. Through the 

modelling of two small catchments (&lt;1 ha), Zhang and Shuster (2014) demonstrated less 

hydrological connectivity between impervious elements and the outlet when pervious 

elements are located downslope. 

The lack of flow connectivity between runoff sources and the stream network has been 

used to explain unexpected patterns between total impervious area (TIA) and streamflow 

parameters (Hawley and Bledsoe, 2011; Jacobson, 2011). In order to overcome these 

problems, some authors have been considering the Effective Impervious Area (EIA) 

parameter, which represents the impervious areas directly connected to the stream 

network (Roy and Shuster, 2009; Jacobson, 2011; Yang and Zhang, 2011).  

A laboratory study by Pappas et al. (2008) showed higher stream runoff generation when 

impervious surfaces were located downslope comparing with similar upslope 

imperviousness. Overland flow from directly connected impervious surfaces will reach 

the slope outlet more rapidly than where impervious surfaces run-off onto areas having 

significant capacity for abstraction or storage. In contrast, if the runoff from upslope 

impervious surfaces are not directly connected with the outlet, it will only contribute for 

streamflow if downslope soil infiltration capacity or water storage capacity are exceeded 

by rainfall and generate run-on. Through rainfall events, as the downslope soil infiltration 

capacity and/or storage capacities decline, soil surface generates overland flow and can 

become similar to an impervious surface.  

In the lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada, discharge data from streams 

draining areas with similar percentage urbanization increase but distinct types of urban 

development, displayed greater runoff coming from areas with large housing 

developments and extensive parking lots, than areas with small housing developments 

distributed throughout the catchment (Leith and Whitfield, 2000).  

The mixed land-use character of peri-urban catchments can therefore provide increasing 

retention capacity of the overland flow, showing a lower hydrologic impact than classical 

urban catchments (Jankowfsky et al., 2012). However, seasonal variation of runoff 

sources can result from changes in pervious area contribution during wettest periods. In 

Chaudanne catchment, which is located in the peri-urban area of Lyon, France, under a 

temperate climate with Continental and Mediterranean influence, uncalibrated model 

results showed the importance of overland flow from impervious areas in summer events 

and flow contributions from rural zones during winter events (Jankowfsky et al., 2012).  

Based on the analysis of the streamflow records from 26 urban basins located in 12 

countries, Boyd et al. (1993) showed that small amounts of pervious runoff occurred for 

most storms, but increased for larger storms. These led to a greater scatter of data in 

catchments with pervious overland flow than those dominated by impervious overland

24 

flow. These authors also reported that larger basins tend to generate both pervious and 

impervious runoff.  

Variable runoff contributions from pervious areas can be enhanced by the subsurface 

water connectivity. During a wet period, Burns et al. (2005) observed greater flows from 

an undeveloped catchment in Croton River basin, New York, USA, than an alike 

residential one (similar size, geomorphology and physiographic characteristics) as a result 

of greater subsurface storage and/or hydraulic conductivity of the soil at depth, leading to 

greater baseflow contribution. On the other hand, with increasing impervious cover and 

a concomitant decrease in subsurface runoff, the importance of antecedent soil water 

content to overland flow formation is restricted (Shuster et al., 2005). 

Within urban areas, the road network has been considered an important source of overland 

flow and a main cause of decreased water concentration time. Eisenbies et al. (2007) 

estimated that road networks could increase the effective drainage density by 40-100%. 

Road cuts may also intercept subsurface water by breaking the natural movement of 

pipeflow, or by creating artificial areas of water resurgence through disruption of 

subsurface flow networks. In recent years, best management practices consider the 

location and form of road networks in order to redirect overland flow at topographic 

breaks and other permeable sites, thus minimizing connectivity with streams (Eisenbies 

et al., 2007; Hümann et al., 2011).  

 

2.2.5. Impacts of water management activities  

Besides the spatial distribution of pervious and impervious surfaces within a catchment, 

flow connectivity is also affected by water management activities (Reed et al. 2006; 

DeFries and Eshleman 2004). Problems of urban runoff are usually managed with 

engineered solutions linked to the channelization of water. In urban/peri-urban areas there 

are three basic types of drainage systems: 1) sanitary sewerage for domestic and industrial 

wastewater, 2) storm drains intended to rapidly and safely convey storm runoff, and 3) 

combined sewerage, which drains wastewater and storm runoff in one system.  

The introduction of artificial drainage increases the direct input of precipitation into 

stream channels, by circumventing depression storage and groundwater recharge (Foster 

et al., 1999). In the urban area of Nassau County, total streamflow declined when local 

water users began to send wastewater to a regional sewer system and abandoned the use 

of on-site septic systems (Sulam, 1979). Konrad and Booth (2002) also attributed the flow 

decrease in Issaquah Creek to the combination of wastewater collection and ground-water 

pumping. Simmons and Reynolds (1982) reported decreases of 20% to 85% of 

groundwater flow in sewered urbanized catchments.  



LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     

 

25 

Storm runoff channelization leads to a faster rise and recession of streamflow, higher peak 

rates and increased storm flow volume from a given amount of precipitation (Konrad and 

Booth, 2005; Tetzlaff et al., 2005; Wheater and Evans, 2009). Streamflow records from 

two adjacent catchments in Swindon, United Kingdom, showed that the area served by a 

storm drainage system was a stronger determinant of streamflow response than either 

impervious area or development type (Miller et al., 2014). Here, the introduction of a 

large-scale storm drainage system in a 44% urban cover was accompanied by a 50% 

reduction in rainfall-runoff duration and a peak flow increase of over 400%. The study 

also revealed a significant increase in flashiness of storm runoff, above that attributed to 

impervious area alone. 

The quicker runoff resulting from the storm drainage systems can, however, induce flood 

risk in downstream areas, particularly in small catchments (Boyd et al., 1993; Navratil et 

al., 2013). Nevertheless, in a peri-urban area of Lion, France, Braud et al. (2013) reported 

an increase in frequency of smaller floods as a result of the sewer overland flow devices, 

but a marginal impact on the largest floods, mainly governed by saturation of the rural 

parts of the catchments. 

The maintenance of the artificial drainage systems can also influence the catchment 

hydrology. Generally, such drainage systems are not watertight and leakage from 

drinking water, storm drainage and wastewater pipes can provide an important source of 

groundwater recharge, thus sustaining baseflow during dry periods (Foster et al., 1999; 

Scholz and Yazdi, 2009; Jankowfsky et al., 2012).  

Increases in baseflow have been also noted due to irrigation (Barron et al., 2012), car 

washing (Meyer, 2005) and water imports from outside the catchment (Walsh et al., 2005; 

Konrad and Booth, 2002). In a high density residential catchment of New York, Burns et 

al. (2005) reported an increase of 0.25 mm day-1 in low streamflow due to groundwater 

pumping for human consumption and irrigation. 

In peri-urban areas, flow connectivity and streamflow response is often further 

complicated by the installation of reservoirs and stormwater retention systems. In a 

Mediterranean catchment near St Tropez, France, the installation of a reservoir with a 

storage capacity of 14% of the catchment area, decreased the runoff from the small 

upslope urban core (1.7% of the catchment area) by approximately 15% if the reservoir 

was filling. Nevertheless, if the reservoir was full, no impact on streamflow was recorded 

(Fox et al., 2012). Detention tanks are used to store water during high intensity rainfall 

and gradually release it when the drainage network is not overloaded (Cembrano et al., 

2004). 

In addition, surface runoff retention in specific infrastructures can favour infiltration and 

groundwater recharge. Thus, in Long Island, New York, the use of recharge basins for 



CHAPTER 2 – URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON

26 

collection and disposal of urban storm runoff led to a 12% increase in annual groundwater 

recharge (Ku et al., 1992).  

Nevertheless, construction of dams and subsequent regulation of river flow regime can 

either increase or decrease low-flow discharge levels, depending on the operational 

management of the reservoir. It is necessary to distinguish between small impoundments, 

such as farm dams, where there is little or no control over the level of storage, and larger 

dams where artificial releases can be made. Large artificial impoundments probably 

constitute the single most important direct impact on the low flow regimes of rivers 

(Smakhtin, 2001).  

The complex interaction between all the above stated factors affecting flow connectivity 

over the landscape and the hydrological response of a catchment requires additional 

scientific information to understand better in which ways flow dynamics are changed by 

human impacts. Understanding the controls of runoff generation and transmission in 

relation, for instance, to rainfall events, and how they differ according to temporal or 

spatial constraints, will give key information regarding flow pathways and hillslope 

connectivity. Although some pathways might be dominant, they can change under 

different circumstances (Lexartza-Artza and Wainwright, 2009).  

 

2.3. Surface water quality 

2.3.1. Sources of pollutants within peri-urban areas 

Concern with water quality degradation within peri-urban and urban areas has raised 

awareness regarding sources of pollution. In mixed land-use catchments, there can be 

numerous sources of contaminants, such as nutrients, organic compounds and heavy 

metals. Sources can include untreated solid waste disposal, leachate from landfills, 

wastewater contamination (e.g. sewerage systems leakage, inefficient wastewater 

treatment), industrial processes and spills, atmospheric deposition and stormwater runoff.   

Percolation of rainwater through waste layers leads to various physical, chemical, and 

microbial processes that generate leachate which threaten water resources, particularly 

groundwater. Landfill leachate plumes have been recognized as important sources of 

dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen, as well as ferrous iron, chloride and bicarbonate 

(Christensen et al., 2001; Corniello et al., 2007; Lorah et al., 2009). In a peri-urban 

floodplain adjoining the city of Oxford, landfills contributed nearly 40% of the in-stream 

ammonium (NH4). High concentrations of NH4 and low concentrations of nitrate (NO3) 

and dissolved oxygen in groundwater were also linked to landfill leachate in a peri-urban 

floodplain adjoining the city of Oxford, UK (Gooddy et al., 2014). In a peri-urban area of 

Uganda, solid waste dumping, together with animal rearing and grey water/stormwater

27 

disposal in unlined channels have been the main causes of groundwater contamination by 

nitrogen compounds (up to 370 mg Nk L-1 and 779 mg NO3 L
-1), phosphorus (up to 13 

mg L-1), thermotolerant coliforms and faecal streptococci (median values of 1263 cfu 100 

mL-1 and 1543 cfu 100 mL-1, respectively) (Kulabako et al., 2007). 

In peri-urban areas, sewage is generally either disposed and treated in septic systems, or 

piped into wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), together or separated from the 

stormwater flow. Septic fields have been recognized as significant sources of NO3, 

phosphate (PO4), chemical and biochemical oxygen demands (COD and BOD), as well 

as coliforms. In Rhode Island, for example, leachate from residential septic fields led to 

NO3 concentrations of 68 mg L
-1 and mass losses of 47.5 kg ha-1 (Gold et al., 1990). 

Groundwater contamination derived from septic systems has been well documented 

(Robertson, 1995; Robertson and Harman, 1999; Wilhelm et al., 1994), but it eventually 

contributes to surface water pollutant inputs (Gold et al., 1990; Wernick et al., 1998; 

Castro et al., 2003).  

On the other hand, centralized WWTPs ensure compliance with regulatory standards, but 

the characteristics of the effluent released can vary considerably depending on the level 

of wastewater treatment. For example, Andersen et al. (2004) compared streamwater 

quality at multiple sites in South Carolina and reported higher average nitrate and soluble 

reactive phosphorus concentrations in streamwater downstream than upstream of 

WWTPs (NO3: 50.5 mg L
-1 vs 1.6 mg L-1 and reactive phosphorus: 3.7 mg L-1 vs 0.3 mg 

L-1).  

Surface water quality may be particularly affected by WWTP discharge during dry 

seasons, since it may represent a major fraction of downstream flows and dilution rates 

are reduced (Andersen et al., 2004; Ekka et al., 2006). The impact of WWTPs discharge 

on surface water quality can therefore obscure the impact of the catchment land-use 

(Miltner et al., 2004). Furthermore, sewage and storm drainage system leaks during larger 

storm events have also been considered a relevant source of pollution (Le Pape et al., 

2013).  

The efficiency of wastewater treatment is also dependent on the characteristics of the 

input sewage. In combined drainage systems, sewage pollutants such as BOD, ammonia 

(NH3), total phosphorus (TP) and faecal coliform bacteria are diluted, but added to 

stormwater runoff pollutants like heavy metals (e.g. Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, Hg, and Zn). 

These stormwater pollutants can have a negative impact on the performance of biologic 

treatments in the WWTPs (Gromaire et al., 2001; Schoonover and Lockaby, 2006; 

Soonthornnonda and Christensen, 2007).  

Erosion is prone to occur in bare soils, construction sites and road edges due to rainfall 

and storm runoff, depending on soil properties and topographic characteristics (e.g. 

Burton and Pitt, 2001). Line et al. (2002) reported sediment exports during the clearing 



CHAPTER 2 – URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON 

HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  

 

28 

and grading phase of a construction site nearly 10 times greater than in other land-uses, 

such as single-family residential areas, a golf course and dairy cow pasture. Line and 

White (2007) also reported sediment exports from a developing area about 95% greater 

than forested and agricultural areas.  

Erosion has been considered a major factor perturbing the ecological status of the rivers, 

due to greater suspended sediment concentrations and stream channels clogging. The 

presence of sediments in streamflow increases the turbidity and leads to reduced amount 

of light penetration, with detrimental impacts on photosynthesis, which affect dissolved 

oxygen concentration and food availability to aquatic life (e.g. Atasoy et al, 2006).  

Furthermore, fine sediments can also represent a threat for surface water quality due to 

their absorptive properties for several inorganic pollutants, such as phosphorus, heavy 

metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Goonetilleke et al., 2005; Le Pape 

et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2014). Nitrogen inputs resulting from sediments released in a 

construction site in North Carolina (TN: 36.3 kg ha-1 yr-1; TP: 1.3 kg ha-1 yr-1) were similar 

to total N exports from residential (23.9 kg ha-1 yr-1) and golf course areas (31.2 kg ha-1 

yr-1) (Line et al., 2002). 

Atmospheric chemistry can play an important role in influencing surface water quality, 

mainly via its influence on runoff process properties. Dry and/or wet deposition (through 

precipitation) can contribute significant amounts of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) 

from 1) tree pollen, mostly from forestry but also lawns within residential areas (Hu, et 

al., 2001; Easton and Petrovic, 2004); 2) livestock emissions associated with agriculture 

(e.g. NH3) (Spokes and Jickells, 2005); 3) wind-eroded particles (Smil, 2000); and 4) 

fossil fuel combustion, released from vehicle traffic and industrial activities (Bernhardt 

et al., 2008; Apeagyei et al., 2011).  

Nutrient contributions from vegetated areas in San Bernardino Mountains, California, 

were investigated by Fenn and Poth (2004), who recorded nitrogen deposition rates of 

146 kg ha-1 yr-1 (NH4 + NO3) from ponderosa pine trees (Pinus ponderosa Laws).  

In Waquoit Bay, atmospheric deposition supplied 30% of estuary nitrogen loads, whereas 

fertilizer use and wastewater accounted for 15% and 48%, respectively. These 

contributions were provided by fractions of the catchment, specifically from urban (39%), 

natural vegetation (21%) and turfgrass areas (16%) (Valiela et al., 1997) 

Traffic emissions also provide an important nitrogen source to the atmosphere, ranging 

from 10 to 155 mg NH3 km
-1 depending on vehicle type (Emmenegger et al., 2004). The 

relationship between automobile emissions and NH3 concentrations in freeway runoff 

was demonstrated by Pitt and Maestre (2005).  

Anthropogenic sources of air pollution can also act as sources of many metals in urban 

environments (Ellis et al., 1986; Yu et al., 2014). Based on moss bags and total deposition

collectors installed in seven urban sites throughout London, Duggan and Burton (1983) 

calculated mean total deposition of 193.3, 433.3, 30.0 and 2.0 µg m-2 day-1 for Pb, Zn, Cu 

and Cd, respectively. In Milwaukee, USA, rainfall falling in residential areas exhibited a 

10-fold higher mass rate of metals (Zn, Cu, Cd, Ni, Pb, Hg and Ag) than open land areas, 

due to vehicular traffic emissions (Soonthornnonda et al., 2008). In Shanghai, a 

significant amount of heavy metals identified in sediments from the lake was provided by 

dust from coal combustion (represented 50% of Pb concentration) and vehicular traffic 

(10–30% of total Pb and Hg content) (Li et al., 2012). 

Overland flow has been considered by several authors as the major non-point source of 

pollutants at the catchment scale (e.g. Bannerman et al., 1993; Qian et al., 2002). 

Impervious surfaces have been considered as a concentrator and transporter of pollutants, 

mainly due to its efficient capacity to convert rainfall into overland flow. In many cases, 

overland flow from impervious areas is piped directly to streams, rather than filtered 

through soils.  

Overland flow from impervious surfaces is typically associated with several pollutants, 

particularly heavy metals (Zhang et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2014), nutrients (Gilbert and 

Clausen, 2006; Ouyang et al., 2009), major ions (e.g., sulphate, nitrate, chloride, calcium, 

magnesium and potassium) (Rose, 2002), pesticides (Hatt et al., 2004) and faecal 

coliforms (Gregory and Frick, 2000; Mallin et al., 2000). 

In USA, Schueler (2003) reported 2.0 mg L-1 of TN and 0.26 mg L-1 of TP as typical 

concentrations in urban stormwater runoff. In Seattle, Washington, under baseline 

conditions, streamflow from urban areas displayed average TN, TP and dissolved P 

concentrations higher than in forest streams (greater values by 44%, 95%, and 122%, 

respectively) (Brett et al., 2005). Urban impervious surfaces (18%) within a forest and 

agricultural catchment in Indianapolis, Indiana, also led to greater TN, TP and total Pb 

loads (24%, 22% and 43%), associated with higher annual runoff (34%) (Lim et al., 

2006). In the peri-urban stream around Shanghai, East China, nitrogen and phosphorus 

concentrations were much higher than in agricultural streams (NH4: 9.2 mg L
-1 vs. 1.5 mg 

L-1, TP: 1.4 mg L-1 vs 0.2 mg L-1) (Qian et al., 2002). Shields et al. (2008) also reported 

higher nitrogen exports with increasing urbanization, with particularly high values in fully 

urbanized catchments than in low-density peri-urban, agricultural and forest catchments.  

Other land-uses within mixed catchments can also influence surface water quality. In a 

rapidly developing mixed land-use catchment in southeastern China, urban areas were the 

dominant contributor of Pb and Cd loads, whereas farmland provided most of the Cu, Zn, 

Cd and Mn loads. Forest and green land did not supply metal loads (except Cr) into 

streamwater (Yu et al., 2014). Nevertheless, Göbel et al. (2007) identified Cu and Zn, as 

well as Ni, as typical metals associated with urban land-uses in German.

Mallin et al. (2000) found that % impervious surface was the single most important 

determining factor of faecal coliform (FC) contamination in coastal catchments of North 

Carolina, explaining 95% of the variability in average FC abundance. In western Georgia, 

a study performed within 18 mixed land-use catchments revealed nitrogen and FC 

concentrations within catchments having more than 24% impervious surface to be higher 

than non-urban catchments, both under baseflow (N: 1.64 mg L-1 vs. 0.61 mg L-1 and FC: 

430 vs. 120 MPN100 mL-1) and storm flow conditions (N: 1.93 mg L-1 vs. 0.36 mg L-1 

and FC: 1600 vs. 167 MPN100 mL-1) (Schoonover and Lockaby, 2006).  

 

2.3.2. Contributions from different impervious surfaces 

It is usually accepted that pollutant loads tend to increase directly with % TIA. Thus, 

several authors have been considering this parameter has an indicator of the ecological 

and environmental conditions of an aquatic system (Schueler, 1994; Arnold and Gibbons, 

1996; Paul and Meyer, 2001; Morse et al., 2003; Kuusisto-Hjort and Hjort, 2013). Brabec 

et al. (2002) identified different thresholds of TIA for different water quality parameters. 

Thresholds ranged from 8% for oxygen to 30-50% for other chemical properties and 5-

50% for physical variables. Other authors have also identified different impervious 

thresholds for specific water quality parameters. For example, Griffin et al. (1980) 

identified a 42% impervious cover for degradation due to nutrients, May et al. (1997) 

recognised a 45% for phosphorus and Horner et al. (1997) reported a 50% imperviousness 

for significant metals increase in streamwater quality, but only 40% in the case of zinc. 

Aquatic ecosystems may be affected by a combination of pollutants rather than by 

individual water quality parameters. As a result, Schiff and Benoit (2007) considered that 

a threshold of 5-10% TIA can impair water quality due to urbanization effects. On the 

other hand, Exum et al. (2005) suggested that 5-10% TIA produces modest impacts 

related to urbanization, which can be addressed through planning and catchment 

management. These authors considered that urbanization of only 10-20% TIA can lead to 

significant aquatic degradation, whereas for catchments exceeding 20% TIA the 

likelihood of successful remediation efforts being able to improve water quality are 

minimal. Schueler (1994) reviewed eleven published studies and reported their evidence 

that stream quality declines at 10 to 15% imperviousness. Based on a review of different 

studies, Arnold and Gibbons (1996) also defined a 10% TIA threshold for minimum 

degradation start and a 30% threshold for unavoidable impacts. Based on the magnitude 

of the impacts of TIA, Arnold and Gibbons (1996) suggested a classification of the stream 

health “which can be roughly characterized as ‘protected’ (&lt;10% impervious surface), 

‘impacted’ (10%-30% impervious surface), and ‘degraded’ (&gt;30% impervious surface).” 

Although the establishment of an impervious cover threshold can be very useful for 

management purposes, results from different studies are not unanimous. Differences

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     

 

31 

between the reported thresholds can be driven by site-specific characteristics of the 

catchment, such as the proportion of different types of impervious surfaces.  

Impervious surfaces within urban areas are mostly represented by rooftops and roads, 

both characterized by distinct pollutant loads, with different potential impacts on 

catchments’ water quality. A number of studies have reported the release of certain 

compounds from rooftops during rainfall events (Athanasiadis et al., 2007). Because of 

this, rooftop runoff can be an important source of pollutants for the aquatic ecosystems. 

Gromaire et al. (2001) compared the runoff pollution in an urban district in Paris, France, 

derived from rooftops (54% of the area) with different types of covering material (Zn 

sheet, slate, interlocking tiles, flat tiles) and guttering (Zn, Cu, cast Fe), streets (22%) and 

impervious miscellaneous structures (24%). The results showed that rooftops contributed 

more than 80% of the Cd, Pb and Zn contamination during the wet season in the combined 

sewer system. The runoff from sawmill rooftops along Washington coast also exceeded 

the water quality guidelines for Cu, Pb and Zn in all the samples tested (Good, 1993). In 

Austin, Texas, the runoff from a rooftop of an Army fort contributed as much as 55% of 

the specific heavy metal concentrations measured in the total catchment loads (Van Metre 

and Mahler, 2003).  

Other authors, however, reported a low impact from rooftop runoff. For example, 

Simmons et al. (2001) measured the concentration of heavy metals (Zn, Cu and Pb) in the 

runoff of 125 domestic rooftops in four rural areas of Auckland, New Zealand, but only 

a few sites exceeded the drinking water standards: 14%, 2% and 1% of the sites for Pb, 

Cu and Zn, respectively.  

The type of roof material, the age and the conservation status of the roof are important 

parameters on runoff properties and pollutant loads (e.g. Chang et al., 2004; Adeniyi and 

Olabanji, 2005). Schriewer et al. (2008) studied the runoff properties from a 14 years old 

zinc roof and measured mean concentration of 4.9 mg Zn L-1. According to a study by the 

German Federal Environmental Agency, roof runoff in Germany releases almost 

85.2 tonnes of copper every year (UBA, 2005). A detailed review of rooftop runoff 

pollution is given by Lye (2009).  

Some authors have considered roads has a major source of pollutants within urban 

catchments, particularly due to the heavy metal composition (e.g. Ellis et al., 1986; 

Bannerman et al., 1993; Herngren et al., 2004). Studies in Europe and USA catchments 

encompassing highways reported maximum heavy metal loads of 244, 499 and 288 µg 

m-2 day-1 for Pb, Zn and Cu, respectively (Mance, 1982; Randall et al., 1979). However, 

road runoff properties are highly variable. For a highway in metropolitan London, UK, 

with 500 vehicles day-1, Ellis et al. (1986) measured a metal removal rate varying between 

15.6 and 167 µg m-2 day-1 for Pb, 17.2-194 µg m-2 day-1 for Zn and 4.9-69.2 µg m-2 day-1 

for Cu. Greatest variability of pollutants concentration was even reported by Crabtree et

32 

al. (2006), based on runoff discharges from several highways across UK: 2.1 - 304.0 ?g 

L-1 of Cu, 5.0 - 1360 ?g L-1 of Zn and &amp;lt;0.01 - 5.40 ?g L-1 of Cd. In Western Washington 

State, however, runoff properties from 35 highways varied less, displaying 3.1 - 18.1 ?g 

L-1 of Cu, 13 - 134 ?g L-1 of Zn and 0.9 - 2.8 ?g L-1 of Cd (Herrera Environmental 

Consultants, 2007).  

Spatial and temporal differences in road runoff composition can be due to several 

parameters, such as: 

 

? Vehicular traffic  

Besides the impact of gas exhaustion discussed on section 2.3.1., wear of vehicles 

components, such as tyres and brakes, as well as fluid losses, can be important sources of 

pollutants in road runoff, but also in the runoff from car parks and service stations (Ellis 

et al., 1986; Sullivan et al., 1978; Bannerman et al., 1993; Soares, 2014). 

In several small peri-urban catchments around Madison, Wisconsin, the runoff from 

streets, driveways and parking lots supplied 21% and 28% of the dissolved and total 

phosphorus loads of the surface waters (Waschbusch et al., 1999). 

A positive relationship between the amount of vehicular traffic and pollutant 

concentrations has been described in several studies. Steuer et al. (1997) reported nitrogen 

and phosphorus concentrations in the runoff from high traffic streets to be twice as high 

as in low-traffic streets (TN: 2.95 mg L-1 vs 1.17 mg L-1; TP: 0.31 mg L-1 vs 0.14 mg L-

1). Pollution from traffic also varies with urban type. For example, in UK, a sub-catchment 

dominated by a highway showed three times more Fe and a 16-fold increase of Cu than a 

residential area (Ellis et al., 1986).  

Similarly, Herngren et al. (2004) measured, through rainfall simulation experiments, 

greater runoff pollution in a road in a highly urbanized area (dominated by town houses) 

than on an access road in suburban residential area of Brisbane, Australia. Suspended 

sediment concentration was almost twice higher in the highly urbanized than suburban 

area. As regards to organic carbon compounds, dissolved fractions were twice as high in 

the most urbanized area, but three times higher for total organic compounds. Greater 

metals concentration in the highly urbanized area were also found, particularly as regards 

to Al (17 times higher in the dissolved fraction, but only 2 times higher for the total 

fraction) and Fe (8 times higher in the dissolved fraction and slightly higher in the total 

fraction). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons also displayed 15 times greater dissolved 

fraction concentration and 40 times more total fraction in the road of the highly urbanized 

area.

? Pavement material, conservation status and management activities  

Pavement material influences surface permeability and pollutant accumulation rates 

(Sartor and Boyd, 1972; Gilbert and Clausen, 2006). Furthermore, it affects the release of 

chemical compounds and thus, the sort of pollutants washed-off. This is also influenced 

by the conservation or degradation status of the road surface (Sartor and Boyd, 1972), as 

well as by cleaning activities. Street sweeping may have an adverse impact on pollutant 

wash-off because it releases the finer material of the pavement, which is not removed by 

the cleaning equipments (e.g. due to the reduced suction), making the fine sediments 

available for wash-off during the next storm (Vaze and Chiew, 2002).  

Management activities during colder weather conditions, linked to sand and de-icing 

materials commonly applied to assure safe road driving, can also have a detrimental 

impact on water resources. Interlandi and Crockett (2003) measured increasing 

streamwater concentrations of chloride (37%) and sodium (25%) as a result of salts 

deposited on roadways of Philadelphia. 

 

? Rainfall and runoff  

Rainfall intensity determines the available energy to overcome the initial resistance 

provided by both the amplitude and scale of surface roughness (Athayde et al., 1982), 

whereas rainfall amount determines the runoff volume generated. Runoff volume 

influences both pollutant removal rates (Helsel, 1978) and the dilution factor (Deutsch 

and Hemain, 1984). In a highway surface of metropolitan area of London, UK, Ellis et al. 

(1986) found that storm duration and runoff volume together explain over 90% of the 

observed variance in Pb, Cd, Mn and sediment loads, as well as 79% of Zn concentration.  

 

? Antecedent dry period 

The extent of time without rainfall determines the amount of pollutant material deposited 

on road surface resulting from vehicular traffic, pavement degradation and atmospheric 

deposition (Sullivan et al., 1978; Owe et al., 1982; Zhang et al., 2007; Qin et al., 2013). 

According to Marsalek (1976), the antecedent dry period (ADP) explained 83-92% of the 

variance in heavy metal concentrations from road runoff. Based on the study of a road 

surface in a Melbourne urban area, Vaze and Chiew (2002) demonstrated that pollutant 

build-up (accumulation) over dry days occurs relatively quickly after a rainfall event, but 

slows down after several days as redistribution by wind occurs. 

 

2.3.3. Land-use contributions for water quality 

The complex land-use pattern of peri-urban areas provide distinct sources of pollutants. 

Generally, agricultural and vegetated areas are associated with nutrient sources (e.g. 



CHAPTER 2 – URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON 

HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  

 

34 

Crawford and Lenat, 1989; Groffman et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2007), whereas urban 

areas are mostly associated with heavy metal and organic pollutants to streamwater 

pollution (e.g. Pitt and Maestre 2005; Yu et al., 2012).  

Diffuse pollution from agricultural fields, particularly associated with high concentrations 

of NO3, have been widely reported due to fertilizer application (Oakes et al., 1981; 

Addiscott et al., 1991). Groffman et al. (2004) reported NO3 losses from agricultural 

catchments to be 2-4 times higher than urban/peri-urban catchments in Baltimore. 

Crawford and Lenat (1989) also found greater nutrient concentrations in streams from 

agricultural catchments comparing with catchments dominated by forest and urban land-

uses. On the other hand, highest temperatures and concentrations of heavy metals were 

found in the urban catchments (Crawford and Lenat, 1989).  

Livestock manure and sludge application into agricultural fields can represent additional 

risks of nutrients and heavy metal contaminations of rivers and groundwater (Gupta and 

Charles, 1999; Antonious et al., 2008). In a peri-urban region of Vietnam, the application 

of livestock manure provided a surplus of 85 to 882 kg ha-1 year-1 of nitrogen, 109 to 196 

kg ha-1 year-1 of phosphorus and 20–306 kg ha-1 year-1 of potassium. According to Khai 

et al. (2007), sludge application in agricultural fields of Hanoi, Southeast Asia, leaded to 

high accumulation of heavy metals in the soil, ranging between 0.2 to 2.7 and 0.6 to 7.7 

kg ha-1 year-1 of Cu and Zn. 

In the Yellow River catchment, Asia, farmland and forestry were found to be the main 

sources of nitrogen and phosphorus (Ouyang et al., 2009). In Gold Coast, Australia, 

greatest total organic carbon concentrations were also found in surface waters from 

catchments dominated by forestry than other land-uses. In forest areas, nutrients release 

are provided by the degradation and leachate from the leaf litter, supplied by the extensive 

tree canopy (Goonetilleke et al., 2005).  

Zhang et al. (2007) studied the impact of two contrasting peri-urban areas in the Yangtze 

River of China, comparing a vegetable-based (VB) area, dominated by agricultural fields 

used for vegetables production, with a factory-based (FB) area, encompassing 400 small-

scale factories producing a variety of materials including chemicals, fertilizers, pesticides 

and steel. The surface water in the VB area had significantly higher levels of NO3, organic 

N and TN than those in the FB area. In contrast, heavy metal concentrations in the surface 

water from the FB area were higher than those in the VB area.  

Despite agricultural and forest areas being considered important non-point sources of 

nutrients, the lower amount of runoff produced limits the loads of pollutants reaching the 

stream network (Ouyang et al., 2009).  

The type of urban land-use influences pollutant contribution to the stream network. For 

example, based on the study of 200 municipalities of Alabama, USA, Pitt and Maestre 

(2005) demonstrated substantial differences in the chemical composition of the runoff

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     

 

35 

from distinct urban land-uses (industrial, residential and commercial areas, freeways and 

open spaces). Industrial areas showed the greatest concentrations of nitrogen oxide (0.73 

mg L-1 NO2+NO3), Cd (2.0 µg L
-1) and Cr (14.0 µg L-1). Together with freeways, 

industrial areas showed the highest concentrations of Pb (both had 25 µg L-1) and Zn (200 

µg L-1 and 210 µg L-1, respectively), as a result of gas emissions. Freeways showed greater 

concentrations of total suspended sediments (99 mg L-1), COD (100 mg L-1), NH3 (1.07 

mg L-1), phosphorus (0.20 mg L-1) and Cu (µg L-1) than all the other land-uses. On the 

other hand, residential areas showed the highest faecal coliform concentration (8345 

MPN 100 mL-1), due to sewer contamination. Open spaces showed the lowest values of 

COD (42 mg L-1), NH3 (0.18 mg L
-1), Cd (0.38 µg L-1), Cu (10 µg L-1), Pb (10 µg L-1) 

and Zn (40 µg L-1), whereas freeways showed the lowest values of NO2+NO3 (0.28 mg 

L-1). 

The intensity of urbanization has been reported by some authors as a major parameter 

influencing water quality impacts (e.g. Mallin and Wheeler, 2000). A comparative study 

focusing on surface water quality from 28 urban and peri-urban catchments in USA, 

indicated decreasing loading rates of nutrients (TP, TN, NO3+NO2, and NH3) from low 

house density to high density (USEPA, 1983). The difference between the urban areas of 

high and low density reached 90% of the nutrient loads. In the Grand Canal of China, 

surface water quality also showed increasing levels of nutrients (TN and TP) and 

dissolved metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr and Mn) from towns (&lt;150000 inhabitants) to large 

cities (up to 2200000 inhabitants) (Yu et al., 2012).  

The form of urban settlements is another parameter reported on literature with impacts on 

surface water. Corbetts et al. (1997) measured higher sediment yelds in the runoff 

genererated from dispersed impervious surfaces than from clustered development areas, 

despite no significant different runoff volume. This was because of less protection to the 

soil surface. Goonetilleke et al. (2005) also reported greater pollutant loads from detached 

houses than multifamily dwelling units, possibly due to greater extent of road surface area 

but also landscaped gardens. Greater extent of gardens/open spaces and the associated 

application of fertilisers, explained the high nitrogen loads in runoff from duplex housing 

developments comparing with single detached-dwelling areas.  

Increasing nutrient concentration in urban catchments have been attributed to green areas 

and their management activities, particularly fertilization. Steuer et al. (1997) reported 

that runoff concentrations from lawns contributed five to ten times more nutrients than 

other landscape surfaces, such as streets, into Lake Superior in Michigan. Besides 

fertilization, grass clipping can be another source of nutrients in urban green areas, 

particularly of nitrogen (Goonetilleke et al., 2005) but also COD (Schoonover and 

Lockaby, 2006).  

Nutrient losses from urban green areas have been considered similar to forest areas. Gold 

et al. (1990) reported similar nitrogen losses in leachate from home lawns and forest areas. 



CHAPTER 2 – URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON 

HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  

 

36 

Groffman et al. (2009) suggested similar carbon cycling rates between turfgrass and 

forest. However, the different growing stages of the vegetation can lead to seasonal 

variation in nutrient losses (May et al., 2001; Ouyang et al., 2009). For instance, Wherley 

et al. (2009) reported greater NO3 uptake during the active growth period of summer 

(&gt;90%), slightly decreasing during fall and spring transition months (80-90%) and being 

significantly reduced during winter dormancy (10-20%).  

Although urban green areas can be important sources of nutrients, mostly due to 

inappropriate management practices (e.g. fertilization and irrigation) performed to 

maintain the desired aesthetic characteristics (Gross et al., 1990; Easton and Petrovic, 

2004), these areas may have a positive impact on catchment water quality. Some 

researchers highlighted the capacity of lawns to retain nutrients within residential areas 

(Groffman et al., 2004). Furthermore, the low runoff generated on green pervious urban 

surfaces also limit the rate of nutrient losses.  

Based on rainfall simulation experiments performed in different pervious surfaces, Ross 

and Dillaha (1993) measured limited runoff amount from grass and turf surfaces (5% and 

3%), associated with small amounts of suspended sediment, but 3 times more soluble 

phosphorus in grass than turf cover. Nevertheless, runoff from grass and turf displayed 

similar soluble nitrate loads than runoff from bare soil, despite the greatest runoff 

coefficient of the latter (33%). Nevertheless, the runoff from the bare soil was linked with 

greater total suspended sediments (3-fold), soluble nitrate and phosphorus (11- and 13-

folds) than a gravel driveway (51% runoff coefficient). Meadow and mulched landscape 

did not produce runoff.  

Differences in runoff characteristics from various pervious surfaces are critical to land-

use planning, because land-uses vary widely in their ability to absorb or shed rainfall and 

thus, transport sediment and pollutants. Some researchers have stressed the relevance to 

identify the areas prone to generate pollutants, called sensitive or critical areas, in order 

to improve catchment management (Thompson et al., 2012; Easton et al., 2007). 

 

2.3.4. Influence of landscape connectivity  

The multiple mosaic features determined by different land-uses over the peri-urban 

catchments are very complex in terms of potential sources and sinks of runoff pollutants, 

as discussed in the previous sections. The research studies above cited highlight that 

imperviousness may not be the only or even the most important catchment variable, since 

the pervious surfaces, such as vegetated areas, can represent an important source of 

nutrients.  

Nevertheless, the impact of land-uses on surface water quality is dependent on the flow 

connectivity within a catchment, which is affected by the location of pollutant sources 



LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     

 

37 

and the downslope land-use and land cover (LULC). Considering the greater runoff 

volume and pollutant loads from impervious surfaces, the placement of these 

infrastructures within a catchment influences the possible absorption by pervious surfaces 

and, thus, the amount and speed with which contaminants in flow enters the stream (under 

natural conditions, without runoff piped directly to the stream) (Carey et al., 2011). 

Overland flow infiltration or retention in surface depressions is the key to accomplish 

nutrients and pollutants removal and prevent environmental risks (Horner et al. 1997; 

Brabec et al. 2002; Easton et al., 2007; Thompson et al., 2012), by breaking flow 

connectivity and using soil as a filter.  

Wickham et al. (2002) modelled alternative land-use change scenarios in the mid-Atlantic 

region of the USA to identify the most vulnerable areas to increased N and P exports. 

Areas with a forest and agricultural land-use with a ratio of 6:1 and projected urbanization 

rates of 20%, were vulnerable to increased N export; at similar urbanization rates, P 

vulnerability increased in areas with a 2:1 forest and agriculture ratio.  

However, depending on the location and extent of forest areas, they can contribute 

considerably to water quality protection, especially due to the high infiltration capacity 

and thus, the ability to act as sinks of overland flow and pollutants (Groffman et al., 2002; 

Lorz et al., 2007).  

Few studies have investigated the role of riparian vegetation as an effective solution for 

reducing non-point sources of nutrients. Hicks and Larson (1997) explored the 

relationship between imperviousness, forest cover and the width of riparian buffer on 

stream chemistry. The authors reported the degradation of water quality with increasing 

imperviousness and decreasing forest and riparian buffer cover. No discernible human 

impact on water quality was found on catchments with 4% impervious surface, &gt;50% 

forest land-use and riparian buffer of 60 m in more than 80% of the stream network. A 

low level of impact was reported in catchments with 9% impervious surface, 30-50% 

forest stand and 50-80% of riparian buffer. A moderate level of impact was described in 

catchments with 10-15% impervious surface, 10-29% forest area, and 20-49% riparian 

buffer. A high level of impact was showed in catchments with 15% impervious surface, 

10% forest stand, and&amp;lt;20% riparian buffer.  

The role of riparian vegetation on surface water quality was also investigated by 

Steedman (1988), who found an inverse relation between the extent of riparian cover and 

impervious surfaces on sustainable biological integrity of the aquatic ecosystem. This 

author reported that in catchments without urban areas, 75% of the riparian forest could 

be removed without detrimental impacts on aquatic communities, but no riparian forest 

should be removed for a 55% urbanizated catchment. In turn, Horner et al. (1997) 

identified a threshold of 45% impervious surfaces for cease the effective protection of 

riverine systems provided by riparian buffers. Nonetheless, Roth et al. (1996) found that 

regional land-use was more important than local riparian vegetation for stream integrity. 



CHAPTER 2 – URBAN AND PERI-URBAN LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON 

HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND SURFACE WATER QUALITY: A REVIEW  

 

38 

In peri-urban and urban catchments, artificial drainage systems provide higher 

connectivity between pollutant sources and the stream network. Ouyang et al. (2009) 

highlighted the role of the artificial drainage system on phosphorus linkage between 

farmland areas and streamflow. In urban areas, Bannerman et al. (1993) demonstrated the 

water quality impacts of the overall connectivity between road runoff and the stream 

network, whereas only 2% of the roof runoff reached the stream.   

In recent years, runoff channelling have been considered in order to evaluate pollutant 

pathways. The term directly connected impervious area (DCIA) covers the impervious 

surfaces that are hydrologically linked to the watercourses (Booth and Jackson, 1997). 

Some authors have been stressing the relevance of DCIA percentage rather than TIA 

percentage on pollutant loads reaching urban streams (Brabec et al., 2002).  

Based on modelling results, Wilson and Weng (2010) demonstrated that the spatio-

temporal variation in areas that contribute towards runoff, i.e. the spatial extent of 

hydrologically active areas within a catchment, are more important than the spatial extent 

of LULC for surface water quality. 

 

2.3.5. Temporal variation of pollutant sources  

Pollutant sources and transport mechanisms are directly linked to the hydrological 

processes, and thus, associated with temporal variation between overland flow processes 

and hydrological connectivity at catchment scale.  

Schoonover and Lockaby (2006) considered the hydrological processes to explain the 

minor impact of a heavily grazed catchment (&gt;25%) on streamwater quality. The free 

cattle access and the deposition of faecal material near the stream channel provided a low 

faecal coliform concentration in the stream. This was explained by the insufficient volume 

of surface runoff generated and/or energy to transport faecal coliform bacteria from the 

pastures to the streams.  

Temporal variation of pollutant sources are influenced by the rainfall pattern, since it is 

the driver of the hydrological processes, as discussed in section 2.2.3.. In a hydrologically 

isolated grassland hillslope in Co. Down, Northern Ireland, overland flow was highly 

variable and dependent on rainfall intensity. There were some areas of the hillslope that 

either did not generate overland flow or generated overland flow that was not connected 

through flow pathways. The size of the area prone to generate overland flow ranged 

between 20% and 80% of the hillslope, and was found to control the streamflow variation 

and temporal changes on dissolved phosphorus inputs. However, it did not seem to 

explain the particulate phosphorus concentration, which may be due to rapid exhaustion 

of fine particles, and a switching from transport-limited to detachment-limited processes 

at early stages in each storm (Thompson et al., 2012).

Antecedent climatic conditions, particularly the length of time without rainfall, is an 

important parameter determining not only the flow connectivity over the catchment 

during rainfall events, but also the build-up and wash-off processes from different land-

uses and, therefore, pollutants composition and loading (Goonetilleke et al., 2005). 

Generally, rainfall events with longer ADP have more pollutant build-up at the beginning 

of the rainfall, thus higher pollutant loads can be potentially flushed off during rainfall 

events, as referred in section 2.2.3.. Greater rainfall amount has the ability to flush off the 

higher amount of pollutants deposited over the catchment, leading to higher Event Mean 

Concentration (EMC) on streamflow. However, when the capacity of pollutant wash-off 

is greater than the pollutant build-up, additional rainfall causes lower EMC due to a 

dilution effect.  

The influence of ADP on pollutant availability and transport over the hillslope has been 

considered to explain distinct EMCs resulting from similar rainfall events (Qin et al., 

2013), as well as seasonal variation on runoff quality (Interlandi and Crockett, 2003; Lee 

et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2007). In a mixed land-use catchment in Galicia, Spain, 

Rodríguez-Blanco et al. (2013) reported that 68% of phosphorus transport was influenced 

by storm events. In a small catchment in Macau, Huang et al. (2007) showed that mean 

concentration of COD ranged from 41 to 464 mg L-1 between five rainfall events. Qin et 

al. (2013) found maximum EMC for COD over five times higher than the minimum value 

in a typical urbanizing area of China.  

In Mediterranean regions, summer droughts create a long period for pollutant build-up 

and, therefore, the initial storm of the wet season may have higher pollutant 

concentrations than later events (Lee et al., 2009). However, few researchers have 

determined the effect of the ADP in their studies of stormwater discharge, particularly in 

Mediterranean environments. This deficiency is one of the research gaps trackeled in this 

thesis. 

 

2.4. Final considerations 

Land-use changes, particularly associated with urbanization, have impacts on catchment 

hydrology, but the magnitudes of the changes are dependent on several local biophysical 

characteristics, which determine the flow connectivity over the landscape. Only in recent 

years has flow connectivity been recognised as a major parameter influencing the 

hydrological processes and the catchment response (e.g. Shuster et al., 2005; Bracken et 

al., 2013).  

Flow connectivity is driven by the spatial distribution of runoff sources, particularly 

impervious surfaces, as well as temporal variation associated with climate and weather. 

Generally, urban areas are considered one of the most important runoff sources within

development catchments, but under wet conditions, increasing soil moisture favours the 

flow connectivity within the landscape, thus the runoff contributions from other land-uses 

may become increasingly important for streamflow variation. 

Despite several studies focusing on the impact of land-use changes and advances in 

hydrological processes understanding, the runoff processes from mixed land-use patterns 

and their impact at the catchment scale are not fully understood. Mosaics of different 

land-uses provide a combination of fast and slow responses, runoff sources and water 

fluxes over the landscape. Mosaic landscapes are typical of peri-urban areas, but the 

relative lack of available hydrological data, limits understanding of hydrological 

processes within these areas. Despite the spatial variation of runoff processes, 

understanding the temporal fluctuation of soil moisture, as well as the relation between 

rainfall and overland flow processes, particularly in seasonal climates such as the 

Mediterranean, remains a major challenge on hydrology. 

Surface water quality is undoubtedly coupled to the hydrological regime. Different land-

uses are associated with different pollutants, with green areas usually recognized as 

potential sources of nutrients, whereas urban land-uses can be important sources of heavy 

metals, organic and microbial pollution. Flow connectivity between pollutant sources and 

the stream network has been considered a key issue for surface water quality. However, 

the relationship between land-use sources and the mechanisms of transmission and 

dispersion of pollutants over the catchment is still not fully understood.   

Improved knowledge about the spatio-temporal pattern of runoff processes and its impact 

on surface hydrology and water quality is important to improve catchment management 

and urban planning in order to minimize flood hazard and pollution risks. Furthermore, 

this information should guide decision-makers to establish and implement strategies to 

solve current problems within the catchments. Management strategies to minimize runoff 

and pollutant loads, require understanding of the sources and their temporal variation 

resulting from rainfall characteristics and antecedent weather conditions. These will allow 

the implementation of cost-efficient measures to prevent runoff and pollution problems, 

as well as raise awareness on local population.

ABSTRACT 

 

Planning of semi-urban developments is often hindered by a lack of knowledge on how 

changes in land-use affect catchment hydrological response. The temporal and spatial 

patterns of overland flow source areas and their connectivity in the landscape, particularly 

in a seasonal climate, remain comparatively poorly understood. This study investigates 

seasonal variations in factors influencing runoff response to rainfall in a peri-urban 

catchment in Portugal, characterized by a mosaic of landscape units and a sub-humid 

Mediterranean climate. Variations in surface soil moisture, hydrophobicity and 

infiltration capacity were measured in six different landscape units (defined by land-use 

on either sandstone or limestone), during nine monitoring campaigns at key times over a 

one-year period.  

Spatio-temporal patterns in overland flow mechanisms were found. Infiltration-excess 

overland flow was generated in rainfalls during the dry summer season in woodland on 

both sandstone and limestone and on agricultural soils on limestone due probably in large 

part to soil hydrophobicity. In wet periods, saturation overland flow occurred on urban 

and agricultural soils located in valley bottoms and on shallow soils upslope. Topography, 

water table rise and soil depth determined the location and extent of saturated areas. 

Overland flow generated in upslope source areas potentially can infiltrate in other 

landscape units downslope where infiltration capacity exceeds rainfall intensity. 

Hydrophilic urban and agricultural-sandstone soils were characterized by increased 

infiltration capacity during dry periods, while forest soils provided potential sinks for 

overland flow when hydrophilic in the winter wet season. Identifying the spatial and 

temporal variability of overland flow sources and sinks is an important step in 

understanding and modelling flow connectivity and catchment hydrologic response. Such 

information is important for land managers in order to improve urban planning to 

minimize flood risk.

AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT

3.1. Introduction 

Land-use changes associated with urbanization strongly affect hydrological processes. 

Research into the hydrological effects of urbanization has focused on its impact on runoff 

processes, but conclusions have proved difficult to extrapolate because of the complex 

interplay of such parameters as climatic setting (Boyd et al., 1993; Costa et al., 2003), 

geologically-controlled topography (Wilson et al., 2005), soil properties (López-Vicente 

et al., 2009; Hardie et al., 2011), vegetation and land-use (Mallick et al., 2009), including 

land-use change history, the percentage of impervious surface and its spatial arrangement 

(e.g. Konrad and Booth, 2005). Variation in the combined effect of these factors is 

arguably the main reason for observed differences in impact of urban land-use change on 

hydrology. 

Soil moisture, linked to storage capacity, is recognized as a major runoff-controlling 

factor, particularly in a Mediterranean climate (Cerdà, 1997). Its seasonal variability can 

mean that greater rainfall intensity is required for overland flow initiation in summer than 

in winter (Cammeraat, 2002). When saturation overland flow mechanisms are involved, 

the influence of soil moisture is more varied and not entirely understood, particularly in 

urbanizing catchments where its spatial and temporal variation is rarely reported (Easton 

et al., 2007). 

Although there have been many studies of soil hydrophobicity and its impacts on 

infiltration and overland flow processes in a range of seasonal and sub-humid 

environments (e.g. Glenn and Finley, 2010; Carrick et al., 2011; Orfánus et al., 2014), in 

areas of Mediterranean climate they have mainly focussed on forested terrain (e.g. Doerr 

et al., 1996, 1998, 2000; Varela et al., 2005; Keizer et al., 2008; Neris et al., 2013; Nyman 

et al., 2014). Furthermore, relatively little is known about ‘switching’ between 

hydrophobic and hydrophilic conditions in dry and wet periods, and the net effects on 

catchment hydrological response in areas affected seasonally by soil hydrophobicity 

(Leighton-Boyce et al., 2005). In hydrological modelling of urbanizing areas, the 

phenomenon has not even been considered.  

The seasonal and spatial variability of soil moisture and hydrophobicity on heterogeneous 

landscapes affects overland flow sources and sinks, and is critical in understanding flow 

transfer between different landscape units (Kirkby et al., 2002; Bull et al., 2003). 

Relatively little research into such hydrological effects has been carried out in 

Mediterranean environments, so the impact of marked seasonal changes on runoff 

processes is not well understood. This is even truer of peri-urban areas, which represent 

the transition zone between urban and rural environments on the outskirts of cities and 

which often comprise a mosaic of land-use types. Here, better understanding of the 

interplay between these factors would help in the prediction of the flow response and 

estimation of the overland flow amount reaching any point in a catchment (Borselli et al., 

2008).

This chapter focuses on temporal and spatial variations in key soil hydrological properties 

(soil moisture, hydrophobicity and infiltration capacity) in different land-uses in a small, 

peri-urban, partly limestone, partly sandstone catchment in central Portugal. The 

catchment has changed rapidly from agricultural land and forest to a discontinuous urban 

fabric, with urban patches interrupting both woodland and semi-abandoned agricultural 

terrain. The urban areas comprise a complex mosaic of tarmac, gardens and walls, in 

addition to buildings and derelict ground. The distinctive mosaic pattern of the catchment 

is typical of Portuguese urbanization. Specific aims of the paper are to: 1) assess spatial 

and temporal variability of hydrological soil properties in different land-uses/lithology 

landscape units in the catchment; 2) identify seasonal changes in overland flow sources; 

3) evaluate the impact of landscape units (characterized by different land-uses and 

lithologies) on flow connectivity and streamflow response; and 4) explore implications 

of urbanizing mosaics for landscape management and urban planning, especially with 

respect to streamflow regimes and flood risk. 

 

3.2. Study area 

The study site is the S-N elongated Ribeira dos Covões catchment (40°13’N, 8°27’W; 6.2 

km2) in the suburbs of Coimbra, the largest city of central Portugal. The climate (as 

recorded at Bencanta, 0.5 km north of the catchment boundary) is sub-humid 

Mediterranean, with a mean annual temperature of 15ºC, a mean annual rainfall of 892 

mm (INMG, 1941-2000), hot and dry summers (8% of rainfall in the months June-

August) and wet winters (Figure 3.1). The main watercourse is perennial, supplied by 

several springs, and there are several smaller ephemeral tributaries (Figure 3.2). The 

geology (Figure 3.2a) comprises Jurassic dolomitic and marly limestone in the east (49% 

of the catchment area), and Cretaceous and Tertiary sandstones, conglomerates and 

mudstones in the west (47% of the area), with some Pliocene-Quaternary sandy-

conglomerate (colluvium) and alluvial deposits (4% of the area) in the main valleys. Soils 

are generally deep (&gt;3m) Cambisols and Podzols (Tavares et al., 2012). Only on steeper 

slopes in the northwest is soil depth less than 0.4 m. Altitude ranges from 29 m to 201 m. 

The average slope is 9º, but a few slopes reach up to 46º.

The catchment, totally rural until 1972, underwent discontinuous urbanization in 1973 - 

1993, followed by urban consolidation after 1993 (Tavares et al., 2012). The agricultural 

area, mainly olives and arable land, declined from 48% in 1958 to 4% of the catchment 

in 2009. Woodland increased from 46% to 66% over the same period, changing also in 

nature from Quercus suber and mixed woodland to large commercial plantations of pine 

(Pinus pinaster) and eucalypt (Eucalyptus globulus) (Tavares et al., 2012). Urban land-

use increased from 6% in 1958 to 30% in 2009 (Figure 3.2b), of which 14% comprised 

impervious surfaces and 16% urban soil. The result was a mosaic of older urban cores, 

with detached houses and gardens, contrasting with newer apartment blocks. There are 

also a few small industrial premises, recreational areas and an enterprise park begun in 

2009. Urban storm runoff (from roofs, streets and concrete paved areas) is either piped to 

tributaries or flows directly towards the stream network. Where urban buildings and 

derelict urban land are surrounded by fields, however, stormwater is not controlled.  

 

3.3. Methodology 

3.3.1. Research design 

A network of 31 representative sites was established in the catchment to assess 

hydrological properties of the six different land-use/lithology combinations or “landscape 

units” (Figure 3.2b). There were: 1) 11 sites in woodland, 9 being on sandstone 

(dominated by eucalypt, pine and mixed deciduous forest) and 2 on limestone (in small 

areas of oak and mixed deciduous woodland); 2) 11 sites on agricultural fields, including 

5 on sandstone (dominated by light grazing pasture, small olive groves and minor 

cultivated patches) and 6 on limestone (in olive groves and abandoned fields undergoing 

natural succession); and 3) 9 sites on uncultivated urban soil, 4 on sandstone (bare soil 

sites associated with construction and open spaces with ground vegetation between 

houses) and 5 on limestone (derelict spaces between houses and between houses and 

roads).  

At each site, soil moisture content, hydrophobicity and soil matrix infiltration capacity 

were monitored 9 times between September 2010 and June 2011, to cover a representative 

range of antecedent weather and seasonal conditions, including prolonged periods of wet 

weather and long dry spells. Temperature and rainfall data during the study period were 

provided by the national meteorological weather station 12G/02UG, located at Bencanta, 

0.5 km north of the study catchment.  

Replicate measurements of soil hydrological properties, spaced approximately 1m apart, 

were carried out at each site. In total, 558 measurements of each parameter were obtained. 

Three soil samples (c. 100 g each) were collected on the nine occasions at each site to 

assess surface soil moisture (0-50 mm depth). Additional soil samples were taken at all

AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT  

 

48 

sites on 23rd November 2010 to determine dry bulk density, rock fragment content, 

organic matter and particle size distribution. The excavation method (150×150 m and 100 

mm depth) was used for bulk density and rock fragment analyses (three samples per 

location) (Dane and Topp, 2002). Composite samples were also collected at depths of 0-

50 m and 50-100 mm for organic matter and particle size distribution analyses. Each 

composite sample comprised 17 sub-samples collected at 150 mm intervals along a 2.4 

m transect at each site. 

 

3.3.2. Field methods and procedure 

Soil matrix infiltration capacity was measured using a Minidisk Tension Infiltrometer 

(Decagon Devices; 45 mm diameter and pressure head of -30 mm). Before measurements, 

ground vegetation was trimmed and surface litter carefully removed. Following 

preliminary trials, measurements were taken over 30 minutes by which time steady-state 

conditions were assumed to have been reached. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was 

calculated using published guidelines (Zhang, 1997; Li et al. 2005; Decagon, 2007). 

Infiltration capacity, however, was calculated from the final 10 minutes of data (i.e. when 

the values were judged to have stabilized). Taking all measurements as recommended by 

Decagon (2007) would have given spurious values due both to initially high infiltration 

in hydrophilic soils and to delayed infiltration when soils were hydrophobic. 

Near each infiltrometer location, soil hydrophobicity was assessed at depths of 0, 20 and 

50 mm using the Molarity of an Ethanol Droplet (MED) technique (Doerr, 1998). Fifteen 

drops of distilled water and then progressively higher concentrations of ethanol were 

applied until the lowest concentration was identified at which at least 8 out of 15 drops 

were absorbed within 5 seconds. Ethanol concentrations of 0, 3, 5, 8.5, 13, 18, 24 and 36 

percent by volume were used. The soil was considered wettable (hydrophilic) when 

distilled water drops infiltrated within 5 seconds. The classes of levels of hydrophobicity 

used were: low for 3 and 5% ethanol, moderate for 8.5 and 13%, severe for 18 and 24%, 

and extreme for 36% (Doerr, 1998). 

 

3.3.3. Laboratory methods 

Soil physical properties (bulk density, rock fragment, organic matter content and particle 

size) were analysed using standard methods (Dane and Topp, 2002). Bulk density was 

obtained from undisturbed samples dried at 105°C. Disturbed soil samples were oven-

dried at 38°C until a constant weight was reached, and the&amp;lt;2 mm fraction extracted. The 

&gt;2 mm rock fragment content was calculated as a percentage of the total dry soil sample 

weight. The organic matter content was analyzed by oxidation at 600ºC and detected by 

close infra-red, using SC-144DR equipment (Strohlein Instruments). Porosity was

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     

 

49 

calculated from the dry bulk density and the organic matter content according to methods 

recommended by Dane and Topp (2002), assuming a soil mineral particle density of 2.65 

g cm-3 and organic matter bulk density of 0.90 g cm-3. The particle size distribution of the 

minerogenic component of the soil samples was determined where organic matter content 

was &gt; 2% either by: 1) oxidation using hydrogen peroxide (6%), for samples with organic 

matter contents of 2-4%; or 2) heating to 550ºC for samples with higher values. The 

samples were then dispersed using Na-hexametaphosphate and the ultrasonic method 

(Dane and Topp, 2002). Particle size distribution was subsequently determined using a 

combination of sieving, gravity sedimentation and pipette analysis. Soil texture classes 

were based on the ISSS international classification (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993).  

Soil moisture content was assessed on each measurement occasion by the 

thermogravimetric method following oven-drying at 105ºC. Soil saturation was than 

estimated by dividing the volumetric water content (estimated from gravimetric water 

content and bulk density) by porosity. 

 

3.3.4. Data analysis 

The statistical significance of soil property differences between the land-use/lithology 

landscape units was investigated first using the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis H test 

(SPSS 17.0). Where significant differences between units were identified, the Least 

Significant Difference (LSD) Post-Hoc test was applied to identify distinct units or groups 

of units. The same tests and procedure were applied to differences in soil hydrological 

properties between measuring dates. A 95% level of significance (p&lt;0.05) was used. In 

addition, Pearson-r correlation coefficients were calculated to assess linear relationships 

between: 1) soil properties (organic matter content, bulk density and particle size) and 

soil moisture, soil hydrophobicity and infiltration capacity (n=64); and 2) antecedent 

weather and soil hydrological properties on each monitoring occasion. Principal 

Component Analysis was used to quantify the infiltration variance explained by the 

correlated variables. Although the data were not normally distributed, it was considered 

useful to apply this technique for explorative purposes to improve understanding of the 

controls on overland flow. Spatial patterns of hydrological soil properties were analysed 

using geostatistical methods, based on Thiessen Polygons, carried out using ArcGIS 9.3 

software.

3.4. Results and analysis 

3.4.1. Soil properties 

Soil organic matter was generally higher and more consistent for surface (0-50 mm) than 

subsurface soil (50-100 mm) (Figures 3.3a and 3.3b). For both soil depths, organic matter 

content increased from urban (1-3%) to agricultural (3-9%) and woodland soils 

(averaging 7% and 14% on sandstone and limestone, respectively). In the woodland and 

agricultural-limestone landscape units, organic matter was highly variable, but greater 

than in agricultural-sandstone and urban soils (p&lt;0.05). 

Bulk density increased from woodland (0.7 g cm-3) to agricultural (1.0 g cm-3) and to 

urban soils (1.2 g cm-3) (Figure 3.3c). In woodland and urban soils, bulk density was 

similar on both lithologies (p&gt;0.05), but it was higher for agricultural-sandstone than 

agricultural-limestone soils (median values of 1.1 g cm-3 and 0.9 g cm-3) (p&lt;0.05). Values 

for the latter were similar to woodland, whereas agricultural-sandstone values were 

similar to urban soils (p&gt;0.05). Bulk density decreased as soil organic matter increased 

(r=-0.341, p&lt;0.001). 

Soil porosity ranged from 40 to 65% (Figure 3.3d) with generally lower values for urban 

soils, despite no significant difference (p&gt;0.05). Greater heterogeneity was found in 

agricultural soils, with higher values on limestone than sandstone (p&lt;0.05). Rock 

fragment content ranged from 14 to 57% and was similar amongst landscape units 

(p&gt;0.05). Particle size varied between individual sites (Figure 3.3e and 3.3f), but not 

between landscape unit averages (p&gt;0.05), with sandy-loam and loamy-sand textures 

dominating. Particle size distribution affected bulk density, which increased with larger 

coarse sand (r=0.189, p&lt;0.001) and clay fractions (r=0.115, p&lt;0.001), and diminished 

with larger fine sand (r=-0.287, p&lt;0.001) and silt fractions (r=-0.190, p&lt;0.001).

Rainfall and temperature patterns during the monitoring period are shown in Figure 3.4

Antecedent 30-day rainfall ranged from 5.0 mm (30/09/2010) to 141.8 mm (23/11/2010). 

Antecedent 5-day rainfall ranged from rainless (prior to 30/09/2010 and 13/06/2011) or 

trace (0.2 mm prior to 15/10/2010 and 24/01/2011) to 26.0 mm (prior to 03/01/2011) and 

75.4 mm (prior to 02/11/2010).

Soil hydrophobicity varied greatly in severity and frequency both between landscape 

units and with season and antecedent weather (Figures 3.5 and 3.6). Surface (0 mm) and 

subsurface (20 mm and 50 mm) soil (results not shown) exhibited similar spatial and 

temporal trends. Hydrophobicity increased with temperature (r=0.337, p&lt;0.001) and 

decreased with antecedent 2- and 30-day rainfall (r=-0.298 and -0.373 respectively, 

p&lt;0.001). The area affected by hydrophobicity was larger in summer (50% of all 

measurement sites) and hydrophobicity was more severe in summer than in winter. It

Figure 3.6- Spatial variation of median soil hydrophobicity at the measurement dates, based on 

the Thiessen polygon method. 

 

Hydrophobicity was of greater severity and spatial extent in woodland, where after dry 

spells it required several rainfall events to lessen its impact, particularly on sandstone 

(Figures 3.5a and 3.5b). At agricultural sites especially on limestone (Figures 3.5c and 

3.5d), hydrophobicity was also present in dry periods but was less severe than on 

woodland and rapidly decreased in frequency following rainstorms and disappeared in 

wetter periods. Urban soil was mostly hydrophilic (Figures 3.5e and 3.5f), with 

hydrophobicity only affecting a minority of sites even in the driest periods. Re-

establishment of hydrophobic conditions in dry weather also varied with land-use, being 

rapid in woodland, particularly on sandstone where it re-appeared by 24 January 2011, 

but far slower on agricultural and urban soils, where it was absent until March 2011. 

Significant differences between woodland and urban soils were found (p&lt;0.05). 



LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     

 

55 

A positive correlation was identified between hydrophobicity severity and organic matter 

content (r=0.308 for surface and 0.345 for subsurface soil, p&lt;0.001). Hydrophobicity was 

correlated with particle size, increasing with surface fine sand (r=0.197, p&lt;0.001) and 

decreasing with subsurface clay fraction (r=-0.226, p&lt;0.001). This was reflected also in 

a negative correlation with bulk density (r=-0.240, p&lt;0.001). Hydrophobicity was also 

found to be inversely correlated with soil moisture (r=-0.363, p&lt;0.001, n=558). 

Nevertheless, hydrophilic conditions were recorded at least at some locations in all 

agricultural and urban landscape units over the range of soil moisture contents recorded 

(see section 3.4.4), whereas in woodland  soil was invariably hydrophobic at contents 

below 20%. There seemed to be no particular moisture threshold, although at 75% of the 

measurement sites, at least low hydrophobicity was characteristic below 45% soil 

moisture. Hydrophobicity, however, was recorded at a few woodland sites with 70% soil 

moisture. 

 

3.4.4. Soil moisture 

Surface soil moisture varied with antecedent weather (Figures 2.7 and 2.8), increasing 

after rainfall (although correlations were weak: r=0.375, 0.168, 0.258 and 0.541 with -2, 

5-, 10- and 30 day antecedent rainfall, respectively, p&lt;0.001), and declining with higher 

temperature (r=-0.593 with values in previous 5 days, p&lt;0.001). During summer and after 

long rain-free periods (30/09/2010 and 13/06/2011), soil became dry (&lt;20% moisture) 

across the catchment.

Figure 3.8 - Spatial distribution in median soil moisture content for each the measurement date, 

using the Thiessen polygon method. 

 

Land-uses responded differently to rainfall, but limestone areas generally had higher soil 

moisture than sandstone areas. This was very pronounced on 2nd November 2010 (Figure 

3.7). Soil moisture was generally lower in urban sandstone soils throughout the year, but 

also on woodland sandstone in winter and in dry-wet and wet-dry transition periods. 

Indeed, the lowest post-summer (30/09/2010) median soil moisture content was recorded 

in woodland sandstone areas, where it persisted until late autumn (23/11/2010). 

Conversely, agricultural and urban limestone soils generally exhibited higher moisture 

contents, especially in the wettest periods, when soil saturation occurred at a few valley-

floor sites near streams (Figure 3.8). Nevertheless, the locations and sizes of wettest areas 

in Ribeira dos Covões changed through time, and high soil moisture values were recorded 

occasionally at a minority of woodland sandstone sites in winter. In general, soil moisture 

content increased with greater silt (r=0.220, p&lt;0.001) and clay (r= 0.163, p&lt;0.001) 

fractions.

3.4.5. Infiltration capacity 

Soil matrix infiltration capacity in the Ribeira dos Covões catchment was generally low, 

despite occasional higher values (Figures 3.9 and 3.10). In general, sandstone soils 

recorded greater permeability than limestone soils. Land-use also affected infiltration 

capacity but differences varied with season and weather (Figure 3.9). Generally, 

woodland recorded higher values in wet than dry periods (p&lt;0.05), with median values 

increasing from 0.1 - 0.2 mm h-1 on 13/06/2011 and 30/09/2010 to 2.8 mm h-1 on 

03/01/2010. Nevertheless, after the summer, higher infiltration capacity in woodland 

occurred earlier on limestone than sandstone. Urban soils showed the opposite trend 

(p&lt;0.05), with median infiltration capacity diminishing from 2.6 mm h-1 on 13/06/2011 

and 3.1 mm h-1  on 30/09/2010 to 1.4 mm h-1 on 03/01/2010, with slightly higher values 

on sandstone than on limestone. In agricultural areas, the fall in median infiltration 

capacity (from 2.5 mm h-1 on 30/09/2010 to 0.8 mm h-1 on 03/01/2010) was not 

statistically significant.

Figure 3.10 - Spatial variation in median matrix soil infiltration capacity at each measurement 

date, considering Thiessen Polygon method for data distribution. 

 

Infiltration capacity increased with sand content (r=0.228 and r=0.201 for surface and 

subsurface soil respectively, p&lt;0.001), but decreased with clay fraction (r=-0.140 for 

subsurface soil, p&lt;0.001) and organic matter (r=-0.149, p&lt;0.001). Statistically significant 

correlations were also found between infiltration capacity and hydrophobicity (r=-0.314 

and -0.111 at 0 mm and 20 mm depth respectively, p&lt;0.001), as well as soil moisture (r=-

0.117, p&lt;0.001). 

Generally, infiltration capacity was significantly correlated with hydrophobicity and soil 

moisture, but the lower correlation coefficients may be because infiltration capacity was 

only calculated during the last 10 minutes, and hydrophobicity and soil moisture were 

measured separately on adjacent soil. Nevertheless, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 

showed that despite the complex interaction between hydrophobicity and soil moisture,

60 

these variables together explain 63% of total infiltration capacity variance (Table 3.2). 

When particle size characteristics (surface and subsurface coarse sand and silt fractions, 

and subsurface clay) and organic matter content (surface and subsurface) are considered, 

the three component variables together explain 76% of infiltration variance (Table 3.3). 

However, the results of PCA must be interpreted as only indicative, since the variables 

do not follow the normal distribution that is strictly required by the approach.

3.5. Discussion 

3.5.1. Characteristics of the landscape units and their influence on 

overland flow 

3.5.1.1. Woodland  

Woodland environments showed the highest soil organic matter content over the 

catchment. The high variability of this soil property within woodland areas may be due 

to differences in tree species and management practices, affecting the litter layer 

thickness. The lower organic matter of eucalypt than other woodlands may reflect (a) 

periodic understorey clearance to help prevent wildfires and (b) low understorey 

vegetation caused by reduced water availability (DeBano, 2000). The generally low 

values of soil bulk density in woodland units may be the outcome of higher organic matter 

in woodland soils than in soils of the other landscape units and the denser root systems 

associated with a tree cover. Reduced bulk density is also characteristic of soils with 

greater organic matter, since it helps the formation of soil aggregates and structure (Celik 

et al., 2010).  

 The greatest soil hydrophobicity of woodland units can be linked to the species involved 

and their organic matter produced. Seasonal changes in hydrophobicity, with high values 

in summer and considerable disappearance in winter, was more pronounced in woodland 

than other landscape units and is in accordance with previous studies (e.g. Dekker and 

Ritsema, 1994; Doerr et al., 2000; Martínez-Zavala and Jordán-López, 2009). Within 

woodland, however, hydrophobicity was more extensive, severe and persistent in sites 

overlying sandstone than limestone (Figures 3.5a and 3.5b). Thus, in woodland-sandstone 

areas a larger number of rainfall events were required for the soil to become hydrophilic, 

and even during the wettest periods, hydrophobicity persisted in a few soil sites. This is 

probably because sandstone areas were mainly dominated by eucalypt and pine 

plantations, whereas on limestone, oak is more dominant.   The type of resins, waxes and 

aromatic oils produced by eucalypt (Doerr et al., 1998; Jordán et al., 2008) is thought to 

have caused hydrophobicity to be more extensive and resistant than in the other woodland 

stands, with hydrophobicity in eucalypt stands able to persist following rainfall of as 

much as 200 mm in 2 months (Ferreira, 1996; Doerr and Thomas, 2000). In contrast, in 

woodland-limestone areas, hydrophobicity was less severe and easier to switch to 

hydrophilic conditions because oak, which is not usually associated with hydrophobic 

soil (Zavala et al., 2009), is the dominant vegetation.  

Generally, woodland areas were also characterized by a quicker re-establishment of 

hydrophobic conditions after rainfall events, comparing with the other landscape units, 

particularly under eucalypt plantations. The rate of re-establishment would depend on the 

biological productivity of the ecosystem (Doerr and Thomas, 2000; Hardie et al., 2012), 

the type of hydrocarbon substances produced and microbial activity (Keizer et al., 2008). 



CHAPTER 3 – SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF HYDROLOGIC SOIL PROPERTIES 

AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT  

 

62 

Santos et al. (2013) report greater dynamism and more frequent hydrophobic conditions 

in eucalypt than in pine.  

Nevertheless, differences in hydrophibicity between sandstone and limestone, may also 

be linked to differences in particle size, given the statistically significant (albeit weak) 

positive correlation found between hydrophobicity and sand-fraction. This correlation has 

also been recorded elsewhere (e.g. DeBano, 1991; McKissock et al., 2000), although a 

few studies have reported hydrophobicity in finer-textured soils (e.g. Doerr and Thomas, 

2000).  

The higher evapotranspiration associated with a forest cover (e.g. Holden, 2008) may 

explain the low soil moisture contents recorded during dry periods in woodland, 

compared with in the other land-uses (Figure 3.7), although shading by ground vegetation 

and litter  can reduce soil moisture loss in warm, sunny conditions. The more intense 

hydrophobic conditions in eucalypt and pine woodland, by hindering infiltration (Dekker 

and Ritsema, 1994; Doerr and Thomas, 2000), might also help to explain the lower soil 

moisture results recorded in woodland-sandstone compared with limestone  at times of 

transition from dry to wet conditions (15/10/2010 and 02/11/2011).   

Despite the inverse correlation found between hydrophobicity and soil moisture content 

in the woodland units, no soil moisture threshold seems to determine the switching pattern 

between hydrophobic and hydrophilic soil properties. This accords with the inconsistent 

results recorded elsewhere. Thus in field experiments in Portugal, Leighton-Boyce et al. 

(2005) reported no threshold for up to 50% soil moisture content, whereas Doerr and 

Thomas (2000) found one at 28%. Reports of thresholds outside Portugal vary from 21% 

for medium-textured soils in SE Spain (Soto et al., 1994), to 38% for Dutch clayey peats 

(Dekker and Ritsema, 1994) and 50% for some organic-rich Swedish soils (Berglund and 

Persson, 1996). 

The seasonal changes in hydrophobicity of woodland areas would explain seasonal 

contrast in infiltration capacity. Thus, under driest conditions, when hydrophobicity is 

widespread on woodland soil, measured infiltration capacity was minimal, whereas in 

wettest conditions, the limited spatial extent of hydrophobicity allowed infiltration 

capacity of woodland sites to attain the highest values within Ribeira dos Covões. 

Nevertheless, the low inverse correlation coefficient found between infiltration capacity 

and hydrophobicity, despite being statistically significant, may have arisen because 

infiltration may sometimes have been delayed by repellency, but on other occasions have 

commenced with switching to hydrophilic conditions by the end of the final 10 minutes 

of the 30 minutes measurement period.  

Organic matter arguably plays a dual role in explaining seasonal contrast in infiltration 

capacity in woodland units. Thus, although it is associated with hydrophobic conditions 

and low infiltration capacities in dry and transitional weather, in wet periods in winter,

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     

 

63 

when hydrophobicity has largely disappeared, the same high levels of organic matter 

promote structured soils of high matrix infiltration capacity, representing the more typical 

situation of forest soils (e.g. Costa, 1999; Mouri et al., 2011).  

The variations in hydrophobicity, soil moisture and infiltration capacity linked to 

geological and land-use controls and seasonal climatic influences, discussed above, result 

in spatio-temporal patterns of overland flow that differ seasonally and between woodland-

sandstone and woodland-limestone areas.  In storms following summer dry periods (e.g. 

following 30/09/2010 and 13/06/2010), drought-induced hydrophobicity in eucalypt and 

pine areas and resultant very low matrix infiltration capacity makes the woodland-

sandstone areas particularly susceptible to infiltration-excess overland flow generation. 

The less hydrophobic nature of the predominantly oak vegetation of woodland-limestone 

areas means that they are less prone to infiltration-excess overland flow.  Prolonged or 

repeated rainfall events lead to partial switching of woodland soils to a hydrophilic state, 

and reductions in spatial extent and severity of hydrophobicity. Hydrophobicity in 

eucalypt stands is more resistant to break down, requiring longer and/or a greater number 

of rainfall events. Because of this, infiltration capacity generally remained low in 

woodland sandstone areas (Figure 3.9a) and, therefore, prone to generate overland flow 

during transitions from dry to wet conditions, as recorded on 15th October 2010.  In 

prolonged wet weather of the winter wet season, hydrophobicity largely disappeared even 

in woodland-sandstone areas, where no infiltration-excess overland flow occurred. Even 

under the wettest winter conditions, woodland areas showed relatively low soil moisture 

and high infiltration capacities, thus saturation overland flow was rare.  

The potential for infiltration-excess overland flow in woodland landscape units in dry 

summer conditions was confirmed by rainfall simulation experiments, when a 43 mm h-1 

simulated rainfall  produced runoff coefficients of  20-83%  in a small plot (0.25 m2), 

under extremely hydrophobic woodland soils (slope: 5-36º)  (Ferreira et al., 2012b). 

Under natural rainfall in larger runoff plots (16 m2) in woodland, however, under 

extremely hydrophobic conditions, overland flow did not exceed 3% even for a 23 mm 

rainfall event (Ferreira et al., 2012a), mainly because of infiltration bypassing the 

hydrophobic soil matrix via macropores that can be provided by root-holes, invertebrate 

activity and high concentrations of stones (e.g. Urbanek and Shakesby, 2009; Hardie et 

al., 2011),  Such bypass (preferential) flow is viewed as an important mechanism not only 

in extremely hydrophobic soils (Doerr and Thomas, 2000), but also in dry loamy soils 

with high clay and silt contents (Yang and Zhang, 2011; Bracken and Croke, 2007). 

Cracks in clay soils were observed in dry conditions during fieldwork in the catchment 

study.

AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT

3.5.1.2. Urban  

In contrast to woodland areas, urban landscape units in the Ribeira dos Covões catchment 

are characterized by lowest soil organic matter content. This is probably linked to the 

reduced and patchy vegetation cover and, in some locations, either loss or deposition of 

surface soil. The higher bulk density may be largely due to compaction by people and 

vehicles (Silva et al., 1997), as a result of vehicle access and parking in the discontinuous 

urban fabric. Soil bulk densities measured (1.07-1.72 g cm-3) were similar to those  

reported in Nanjing, China, where lowest values were recorded in greenbelt areas and 

maximum ones in parking zones (1.19-1.62 g cm-3) (Yang and Zhang, 2011).  

In the Ribeira dos Covões catchment, the dominance of bare surfaces and sparse grass 

and shrub vegetation is the main cause of the recorded widespread hydrophilic conditions 

throughout the year. Only at particularly well vegetated sites was hydrophobicity 

recorded during the driest periods. Bare soil sites, mainly found on sandstone, being more 

susceptible to evaporation (Nunes et al., 2011), may have led to the low soil moisture 

content recorded  particular in dry-wet transitional periods, such as in the southwest of 

the catchment  on 02/11/2010 and 21/03/2011 (Figure 3.8).   

The generally hydrophilic conditions found in urban soil would help to explain the high 

soil matrix infiltration capacity values recorded particularly after prolonged dry weathers 

(Figure 3.9), despite the  high bulk density, which elsewhere has been noted to be 

associated with lower infiltration capacities  (e.g. Dornauf and Burghardt, 2000; Yang 

and Zhang, 2011).  The very low and in some cases zero values of soil matrix infiltration 

capacity  recorded  during wet periods may be linked to a decline in the suction force and 

then saturation of the soil. The inverse correlation recorded between soil moisture and 

infiltration capacity was also found in Tasmania, Australia, where the application of dye 

tracer showed infiltration to an average depth of 1.03 m (with a wetting front velocity of 

1160 mm h-1) in low antecedent soil moisture conditions, compared with a depth of 0.35 m 

(and a wetting front velocity of 120 mm h-1) with wet antecedent conditions (Hardie et 

al., 2012). 

In urban landscape units, overland flow is readily generated on paved and tarmac 

impervious surfaces, but for urban soils it varies in importance both seasonally and 

between urban-sandstone and urban-limestone areas. In dry summer conditions, the 

generally hydrophilic soils of greater infiltration capacity (Figures 3.9 and 3.10) lead to 

little or no overland flow and make these areas overland flow sinks.  In contrast, after 

larger winter storm events, soil saturation or near-saturation was identified at urban-

limestone sites (Figures 3.7 and 3.8), associated with a near-surface water table (on the 

valley floor) and shallow soils of low water storage capacity (on hillslopes). In both 

situations saturation overland flow was at least locally being generated. In contrast, in 

urban soils on sandstone, soil moisture levels recorded in winter were much lower than 

on limestone (Figure 3.7) and infiltration capacities (Figure 3.9) varied from low (on bare

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     

 

65 

soil) to relatively high (on uncompacted, vegetated sites); the result was patchy Hortonian 

overland flow, mostly on the bare soil areas, with some of the vegetated patches acting as 

overland flow sinks.   

The potential for  overland flow generation in urban soils was demonstrated by runoff 

coefficients of 59-99% recorded on hydrophilic urban soils (slope: 6-30º) in 43 mm h-1 

rainfall simulations on small plots (0.25 m2) at the field sites, though it was unclear 

whether the overland flow was infiltration-excess or saturation in nature (Ferreira et al., 

2012b). 

 

3.5.1.3. Agriculture  

In agricultural landscape units, different land-use/land management types lead to major 

differences on surface cover and soil properties. The agricultural types on sandstone 

(mainly pasture, small gardens and olive plantations) may explain the low organic matter 

content and high bulk density results of that landscape unit compared with the 

agricultural-limestone unit, where abandoned fields undergoing natural vegetation 

succession are dominant. This greater vegetation cover with higher soil organic matter 

content for agricultural-limestone would also explain the unit’s enhanced spatial extent 

and severity than on sandstone. Nevertheless, hydrophobicity at agricultural-limestone 

sites was less severe than in woodland, and fewer rainfall events were required to 

accomplish switching from hydrophobic to hydrophilic conditions and hydrophobicity re-

establishment in wet to dry transitions was also slower than for woodland (Figure 3.5). In 

a previous study of a partly urbanized Mediterranean catchment, Fernández and Ceballos 

(2003) only recorded lower hydrophobicity persistence when conditions were changing 

from dry to wet. 

 The generally greater soil moisture values of agricultural compared with other landscape 

units, despite the absence of irrigation, may be explained by the lower vegetation cover 

of the agricultural-limestone sites and the low hydrophobicity, particularly when 

compared with woodland. In addition, high surface roughness associated with tillage in 

agricultural-sandstone fields may enhance surface water retention and lead to higher soil 

moisture (Álvarez-Mozos et al., 2009), especially when compared with untilled urban 

soils.  

Soil moisture, however, was slightly higher at agricultural-limestone than agricultural-

sandstone sites, despite most of the former being abandoned. This may be a consequence 

of the marly nature of the limestone, which leads to greater fractions of fine material. 

However, the small soil moisture difference may reflect the fact that most sandstone 

agricultural sites are on valley floors (Figure 8), whereas limestone sites are mainly on 

upper slopes, where the soil is shallow (generally&amp;lt;0.4 mm depth), though in the wettest 

periods some saturation was observed here.  



CHAPTER 3 – SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF HYDROLOGIC SOIL PROPERTIES 

AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT  

 

66 

Differences in particle size distribution and land management practices, particularly 

wheeling, may explain higher soil porosity on abandoned limestone than on ploughed 

sandstone fields. Nevertheless, coarser particle size distribution and minor 

hydrophobicity may explain greater soil matrix infiltration capacity on sandstone 

compared with limestone agricultural areas in dry periods.  

However, rising soil moisture content through the wet season, could restrict soil matrix 

infiltration capacity over agricultural areas, mostly noticed on sandstone fields. In 

agricultural-limestone sites, matrix infiltration capacity was relatively constant over the 

year. In this landscape unit, the slight infiltration capacity increase during early autumn, 

possibly due to soil hydrophobicity shrinkage, gives place to a decreasing capacity in later 

autumn and winter seasons, as a result of soil moisture increase. Throughout spring, with 

soil moisture decrease, infiltration capacity tend to increase, but possibly with 

hydrophobicity re-emergence, infiltration capacity was limited again. The development 

of hydrophobic conditions in the agricultural soils was clearly slower than woodland 

(Figure 3.5).  

Overland flow generation, in response to the contrasts in soil moisture, hydrophobicity 

and infiltration capacity and their seasonal dynamics discussed above, differed between 

the agricultural-sandstone and agricultural-limestone landscape units.  In agricultural-

sandstone areas, high infiltration capacities associated with hydrophilic soils throughout 

the year and with sandy particle size meant that overland flow was absent in summer and 

in winter was only generated in big events or following very wet weather.  In contrast, 

the greater vegetation of the abandoned fields on limestone led to hydrophobic soils in 

summer and a degree of proneness to infiltration-excess overland flow. Despite partial 

switching in transition periods and total switching to hydrophilic conditions in winter wet 

periods, the relatively low infiltration capacities and high soil moisture resulting from the 

marly limestone lithology meant that the agricultural limestone areas were more prone in 

winter to saturation overland flow than the sandstone areas. Unlike on urban and 

woodland soil sites, no infiltration-excess overland flow  was recorded in 43 mm h-1 

rainfall simulation experiments  on hydrophilic agricultural land (slope 15-50º) in the 

study area (Ferreira et al., 2012b). 

 

3.5.1.4. Synthesis: the influences of lithology, topography and land-use 

factors on overland flow and temporal variation in its distribution within the 

Ribeira dos Covões catchment 

Lithology seems to play an important role in controlling spatio-temporal dynamics of 

overland flow in the Ribeira dos Covões catchment via its influence on particle size 

distribution, soil moisture and infiltration capacity variability over the catchment. 

Generally, the greater sand fractions and deeper soils of the sandstone areas promote

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     

 

67 

greater infiltration capacity and water storage capacity, as well as lower soil moisture, 

leading to reduced proneness to both Hortonian and saturation overland flow. In contrast, 

the higher silt-clay content and shallower nature of soils on the marly limestone result in 

greater soil moisture, lower infiltration and water storage capacities and hence greater 

proneness to saturation overland flow than on sandstone. These are in line with reports 

elsewhere of the influence of shallow soils (Easton et al., 2007, Hardie et al., 2011) and 

variations in particle size (Rahardjo et al., 2008; Yang and Zhang, 2011) on overland 

flow.  

Secondly local topographic characteristics also seem to be an important driver. Saturation 

was observed at urban soil sites near streams (Figure 3.8) caused either by (1) lateral 

subsurface flows from upslope (Aryal et al., 2005) or (2) groundwater table rise, as 

recorded at a woodland-sandstone site near to an active spring on 24th January 2011 

(Figure 3.8). In a small cultivated Mediterranean catchment, Latron and Gallart (2007), 

also explained the saturation pattern with extent and height of the water table. The 

locations and extents of the wettest areas in the Ribeira dos Covões catchment varied 

temporally, a feature also reported elsewhere within agricultural hillslope (Walter et al., 

2000) and mixed agricultural and forested areas (Easton et al., 2007). 

Land-use and land management constitutes the third and perhaps most important 

influence on differences in overland flow between and within landscape units. This 

influence is exerted through the effects of different percentage ground covers, 

management practices and other human activities on degrees of soil compaction, soil 

moisture levels and soil permeability and via the effects of different plant species on 

hydrophobicity severity, switching dynamics and seasonality. Overland flow is 

consequently of greatest significance in urban landscape units, particularly in winter, 

when urban soils are often either saturated or bare and compacted, whereas in summer 

overland flow from impervious or bare areas is reduced by hydrophilic soil patches. 

Overland flow in the woodland units is in general greatly reduced by vegetation effects 

on infiltration, but is seasonally enhanced in storms following summer dry periods in 

eucalypt and pine woodland-sandstone areas because of their severe soil hydrophobicity, 

but absent in woodland-limestone areas because of the oak woodland land-use. The 

agricultural-sandstone landscape unit produces very little overland flow because of high 

infiltration capacities resulting from a combination of land-use and land management 

practices that do not result in compaction, but mostly because of the sandy soils. In 

converse fashion, the abandoned field land-use of agricultural-limestone areas probably 

has the effect of reducing overland flow responses from what they would otherwise be 

with active cultivation, but which for lithology-related reasons can be significant 

particularly in winter wet weather.    

Differences in temporal variability of soil hydrological properties between landscape 

units led to spatial fluctuation in overland flow sources and sinks. In wet winter 

conditions, overland flow is greatest from the urban landscape units and also significant

AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT  

 

68 

from the agricultural-limestone unit, but comparatively little from the hydrophilic and 

permeable agricultural-sandstone and woodland units except in the wettest weather. 

During transitions from wettest to dry conditions, the spatial pattern of response to 

rainstorms is reversed, with decreasing susceptibility to saturation overland flow as soil 

moisture declined (mainly associated with agricultural- and urban-limestone areas) and 

increasing vulnerability to infiltration-excess overland flow, enhanced by hydrophobicity 

re-establishment (particularly in woodland but also on agricultural-limestone). In 

summer, overland flow is comparatively low but still greatest in urban-limestone areas 

and to a lesser extent is also significant in the woodland and agricultural-limestone units 

because of their hydrophobic condition, but urban-sandstone and agricultural-sandstone 

areas produce comparatively little overland flow, because of locally or more widespread 

hydrophilic and permeable surface soils providing overland flow sinks.  Finally, in the 

dry to wet transition of autumn, patterns of overland flow are broadly similar to the wet-

to-dry transition, with hydrophobicity (and overland flow responses) becoming most 

rapidly re-established in eucalypt parts of the woodland-sandstone landscape unit.      

Spatial variability of soil properties within the same landscape unit, such as particle size 

and hydrophobicity, provides heterogeneous infiltration capacities, where this 

particularly applies to the partly bare urban-sandstone unit and woodland and 

agricultural-limestone units in transitional periods (Figure 3.9). Soil spots with matrix 

infiltration capacity lower than rainfall intensity will lead to infiltration-excess overland 

flow, which may be infiltrated in surrounding soil spots with greater infiltration capacity.  

Not all the landscape units provided spots with sufficient permeability throughout the 

year. Urban and agricultural landscape units showed more sites of high permeability after 

dry periods, while even in wettest conditions, woodland provided sites of high infiltration 

capacity.  Nevertheless, even the most permeable soil patches could not cope with the 

maximum rainfall intensity of 15.6 mm h-1 recorded in the rainstorm of 2nd November 

2011. Thus infiltration-excess overland flow would be expected to occur widely during 

particularly intense storms in all landscape units. 

 

3.5.2. Implications for catchment runoff delivery and land 

management 

The changing nature of overland flow sources and sinks within the catchment can be 

expected to affect flow connectivity over the hillslope and influence storm runoff delivery 

to the stream network. Under hydrophobic conditions, infiltration-excess overland flow 

generated in relatively extensive woodland on steep slopes and on shallow upstream 

agricultural-limestone soils, may reach the stream network directly or be delivered to the 

urban cores situated downslope (Figure 3.2b). 



LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     

 

69 

Vegetation is widely considered as a key factor interrupting hydrological connectivity 

(e.g. Bracken and Croke, 2007; Appels et al., 2011). Greater vegetation interception 

provided by woodland and agricultural-limestone areas, compared with the other land-

uses, tends to reduce overland flow, though the effect will be marginal in large storm 

events, when percentage interception is small. The more important effect of interception 

is in helping (together with transpiration) to reduce antecedent soil moisture levels prior 

to rainfall events. In central Portugal, Valente et al. (1997) reported relatively high 

interception losses of 17% in Pinus pinaster forest and 11% in eucalypt stands and 

attributed them to the  greater canopy storage and,  aerodynamic roughness (and hence 

higher evaporation rates) of forest covers. In addition, greater litter density and frequency 

of root holes compared with the other landscape units may lead to enhanced water 

interception, retention and infiltration, particularly in smaller storm events after dry 

spells. Surface roughness also enhances water retention and reduces overland flow rates, 

and promotes discontinuities between overland flow source areas (Rodríguez-Caballero 

et al., 2012). These infiltration/retention processes operating at larger scales, as well as 

preferential flow via root-holes and cracks, considerably reduce the risk that overland 

flow from low permeable soil sites might reach downslope contiguous urban areas and/or 

the stream network. Although urban soils may provide overland flow sinks, the 

impermeable tarmac and paved surfaces allow little infiltration, restricting the capacity 

of these areas to deal with rainfall and overland flow from upslope landscape units. 

Observations in Ribeira dos Covões over three years suggest that only small amounts of 

overland flow were generated in woodland and agricultural limestone areas, mainly after 

dry conditions. Nevertheless, preferential flow via macropores can reach streams 

relatively quickly and thus contribute to the flood peak, as reported in other areas of the 

world (Uchida et al., 1999; van Schaik et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2014).   

Although not recorded during this study, clear-felling in woodland would cause increased 

overland flow and water connectivity by providing bare, compacted areas and reducing 

interception, transpiration and surface roughness. Thus the size and location of clear-

felled areas require planning to ensure that most overland flow is intercepted by 

downslope woodland area sinks in order to reduce flood hazard. Clear-felling should also 

be timed to avoid storms of early autumn rainy seasons, in view of the greater extent and 

location of hydrophobic areas at that time (Figure 3.6). In addition, if forest managers 

select tree species that release less hydrophobic substances, overland flow may be 

correspondingly reduced (e.g. Ferreira et al., 2012a).  

Under wet winter conditions, saturation overland flow becomes more likely in urban and 

agricultural land-uses, but saturated areas may be more influenced by topography and soil 

depth than by land-use (Figure 3.8). Overland flow generated in these landscape units 

would be delivered mostly to the stream network, but also to downslope woodland and 

urban cores in the case of upslope saturated shallow soils (Figures 3.2b and 3.8). Previous 

studies reported higher runoff coefficients in shallow soils affecting hillslope runoff 

connectivity (Kirkby et al., 2002; Easton et al., 2007; Hopp and McDonnell, 2009). In 



CHAPTER 3 – SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF HYDROLOGIC SOIL PROPERTIES 

AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT  

 

70 

agricultural areas, however, overland flow paths would depend on land management. 

Land drains, ditches, wheel ruts and roads may enhance flow connectivity, particularly if 

they are aligned downslope, whereas terracing and stone boundary walls can form traps 

for water, enhancing infiltration and disrupting flow pathways. Overland flow transfer 

from agricultural and urban areas to downslope woodland soils when hydrophilic may be 

dissipated by enhanced infiltration and surface retention. Furthermore, although much of 

the overland flow from impermeable urban surfaces located in upslope positions (Figure 

3.2b) is collected by the urban drainage system and delivered directly into the stream, 

some reaches nearby soil. 

Because of the generally low infiltration capacity or saturated condition of downslope 

urban soil areas, saturation overland flow reaching such areas may be problematic, 

although this can be offset by spatial differences in modified and unmodified soil 

properties providing a mosaic of different infiltration capacities. Even if urban soils 

surrounding impermeable surfaces (e.g. roofs and roads) cannot act as sinks, obstructions 

(such as buildings and walls) may delay overland flow transfer. This will depend on 

urbanization style, since extended impermeable surfaces will enhance landscape 

connectivity, whereas detached houses surrounded by gardens and walls can provide 

sinks and flow discontinuity.  

The susceptibility of urban core areas located in topographic lows (Figure 3.2b) to 

saturation overland flow and stream flooding may represent a real flood hazard for the 

inhabitants, particularly considering the scale of recent urban consolidation in the Ribeira 

dos Covões catchment. This risk may be enhanced by 1) additional overland flow 

resulting from greater connectivity with upslope areas subject to soil moisture increase 

and water table rise, and 2) the rapid transfer of most overland flow from upslope 

impermeable surfaces directly into the stream via the urban drainage system. These may 

be particularly important in larger storm events, considering the generally low soil 

permeability across the catchment. According to interviews with older citizens, flooding 

events were already experienced about 80, 50 and 10 years ago, when the urban area was 

considerably less extensive than now. 

Analyses of storm hydrographs of the outlet stream (results not shown) suggest that the 

actual landscape mosaic of Ribeira dos Covões catchment, comprising extensive 

woodland areas and large urban areas near the catchment outlet, together with numerous 

smaller urban areas mainly along ridges and dispersed agricultural fields (Figure 3.2b), 

may be sufficient to promote discontinuities to the infiltration-excess overland flow 

generated by soil hydrophobicity. Thus, in dry settings, rainstorms of 2.8 mm (average) 

and 14.4 mm (large), recorded on 6th August and 1st September 2011, promoted runoff 

coefficients for the Ribeira dos Covões stream of only 5% and 2% respectively and peak 

streamflows of only 0.041 mm h-1 and 0.036 mm h-1, compared with maximum 5-minute 

rainfall intensities of 2.4 mm h-1 and 9.6 mm h-1 respectively. Thus, hydrophobicity over 

the catchment does not translate into catchment-scale overland flow, presumably due to

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS     

 

71 

infiltration into sinks downslope. In wet conditions, however, enhanced soil moisture 

levels seem to increase flow connectivity over the catchment. Thus rainstorms of 2.8 mm 

and 15.0 mm registered on 11th February and 28th March 2011, led to 10% and 9% storm 

runoff coefficients and peak flows of 0.079 and 0.370 mm h-1, compared with maximum 

rainfall intensities of 9.6 mm h-1 in both cases. Although lag times from peak rainfall to 

peak streamflow are short, ranging between 25 and 35 minutes, and probably a direct 

result of urban surface runoff and the urban drainage system, the overriding feature is the 

small size of the storm runoff coefficients both during dry and wet times of the year, 

which shows how little of the rain falling on the peri-urban mosaic actually reaches the 

stream network. This may reflect in part the ridge location of much of the urban expansion 

to date and in part a rather high proportion of infiltration into urban soil within the urban 

units and adjacent landscape units.  

The short lag times between rainfall and streamflow peaks in urban areas, however, mean 

that future urban consolidation and the construction of new urban cores, already proposed, 

must be planned carefully in order to minimize urban flood hazard. From the hydrological 

point of view, instead of extending the existing urban cores, it would be better to establish 

new dispersed urban cores far from the stream network. The maintenance of a patchy 

mosaic of dispersed landscape units would reduce overland flow and river flood peak 

responses. 

 

3.6. Conclusions 

The peri-urban Ribeira dos Covões catchment is covered by soils of relatively low matrix 

infiltration capacity, but of greater permeability on sandstone than limestone, due to the 

marly nature of the latter. The different landscape units, associated with different land-

uses and lithologies, display varying responses of soil hydrological properties to season 

and to antecedent rainfall with complex consequences for spatial patterns of overland 

flow and its flow connectivity. The main findings are: 

1. In dry conditions, severe hydrophobicity in eucalypt and pine (but not oak) 

woodland and limestone-agricultural areas (abandoned fields) considerably reduces 

soil matrix infiltration capacity. In contrast, agricultural-sandstone soils (mainly 

covered by olives, pasture and gardens) and urban soils remain mostly hydrophilic, 

and have relatively high infiltration capacities. Under wet conditions, hydrophobicity 

in woodland and agricultural-limestone areas breaks down and infiltration capacity 

increases, reaching 6 mm h-1. In contrast, on urban and agricultural sites, a rise in soil 

moisture leads to a decline in infiltration capacity, with soil saturation in areas of 

shallow soils and high water tables on hillslopes, in topographic lows and in valley 

bottoms.

AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERLAND FLOW AND LAND MANAGEMENT  

 

72 

2. Temporal variability of soil hydrological properties indicates that, in dry conditions, 

hydrophobicity-related infiltration-excess overland flow may be generated in 

woodland and agricultural-limestone areas, while in wet conditions saturation is likely 

in some locations on urban and agricultural soils. Nevertheless, soil property 

heterogeneity and the distinct temporal pattern of infiltration capacity indicate that 

much overland flow must be infiltrating before reaching the stream network in patches 

of unsaturated soil of relatively high permeability, either within the same landscape 

unit or on adjacent landscape units. 

3. Despite the generally low soil matrix infiltration capacity across the catchment, 

macropores, vegetation, litter and surface roughness play important roles in surface 

water retention and facilitating infiltration. Nevertheless, these processes are 

influenced by the different landscape units, which provide overland flow sinks with 

differing temporal regimes. Because of this, a patchy mosaic comprising fragmented 

and dispersed land-uses, and the tendency for much of recent urbanization to have 

occurred along ridges, have to date led to relatively low flow connectivity over 

hillslopes, thereby attenuating river discharge peaks.  

Understanding how the spatial and temporal variability in overland flow generation and 

infiltration affect flow connectivity in a catchment with varied land-use, geology and soils 

is vital for predicting flood hazards. Landscape managers and urban planners should 

employ a mosaic of different land-uses, where impermeable surfaces are joined 

hydrologically to infiltration-promoting “green” areas, in order to prevent or reduce 

downstream flooding. There need to be informed decisions about the precise spatial 

arrangement of different land-uses.

ABSTRACT 

 

Forest hydrology has been widely investigated, but the impacts of different woodland 

types on hydrological processes particularly in peri-urban catchments are poorly 

understood. This chapter investigates overland flow generation processes in three 

different types of hardwood stand in a small (6.2 km2) catchment in central Portugal 

that has undergone strong urban development over the past 50 years. Two eucalypt 

plantations of differing tree density and a semi-natural oak stand were each 

instrumented with three 16 m2 runoff plots and 15 throughfall gauges, which were 

monitored at c. 1- to 2-week intervals over two hydrological years. In addition, surface 

moisture content (0-50mm) and hydrophobicity (0-20mm, 20-50mm and 50-100mm) 

were measured after individual rainfall events. Although all three woodland types 

produced relatively little overland flow (&amp;lt;3% of the incident rainfall overall), the dense 

eucalypt stand produced twice as much overland flow as the sparse eucalypt and oak 

woodland types, despite similar throughfall amounts. This contrast in overland flow 

can be attributed to infiltration-excess processes operating during dry antecedent 

weather conditions when severe hydrophobicity was widespread in the dense eucalypt 

plantation as opposed to being moderate and low in the sparse eucalypt plantation and 

the oak stand, respectively. In contrast, under wet conditions more overland flow 

(though still small) tended to be produced in the oak woodland than in the two eucalypt 

plantations; this was probably linked to saturation-excess overland flow being 

generated more readily at the oak site as a result of its shallower soil. Differences in 

water retention in surface depressions affected overland flow generation and 

downslope flow transport. Implications of the seasonal differentials in overland flow 

generation between the three distinct woodland types for the hydrological response of 

peri-urban catchments are addressed.

4.1. Introduction 

Forest and woodland represent the dominant land-use in Europe, covering 37% of the 

earth surface (FAO, 2001) and 35% of mainland Portugal (IFN6, 2013). In recent decades, 

globally forest cover has increased as a result of greater demand for timber and 

environmental concerns (e.g. Robinson et al., 2003). This increasing tendency is expected 

to continue in the future, in response to European policy, linked to the Common 

Agricultural Policy and Water Framework Directive. However, forest cover has 

decreased in peri-urban catchments, where urbanization has led to progressive 

deforestation and forest fragmentation (Nowak, 2006). 

Forest hydrology has been widely documented, particularly with respect to some 

hydrological processes. Forest and woodland promote rainfall interception, 

evapotranspiration and infiltration, affecting baseflow recharge and storm runoff (e.g. 

Hewlett, 1969; Scherer and Pike, 2003; Eisenbies et al., 2007). Several studies report the 

hydrological impacts of afforestation (Wattenbach et al., 2007; Iroumé and Palacios, 

2013; Salazar et al., 2013), thinning (Dung et al., 2012; Webb and Kathuria, 2012; 

Hawthorne et al., 2013) and wildfire (Doerr et al., 1996; Moody et al., 2013; Nyman et 

al., 2014), being unanimous as regards to overland flow increase. This increase may 

represent an additional problem when generated upslope urban areas. 

Vegetation affects rainfall partitioning and its redistribution, influencing the amount and 

spatial distribution of water reaching the ground surface (throughfall) and deeper layers 

of the soil (stemflow) (Martinez-Meza and Whitford, 1996). Different tree species are 

linked to different canopy architecture, stem properties and root system, which affect the 

fate of water. For example, horizontal leaves direct water to branches, increasing the 

stemflow, while vertical leaves tend to increase throughfall (Ferreira, 1996). Crown 

characteristics affect water flow along branches towards the trunks (André et al., 2011). 

Nevertheless, throughfall and stemflow typically account for 70–90% of the net-

precipitation, with stemflow representing a minor fraction of 5-10% (Herwitz and Levia, 

1997; Crockford and Richardson, 2000), which reach 15% in the oak forest in northeast 

China (Wei et al., 2005). Generally, evergreen have lower throughfall than deciduous 

species (Barbier et al., 2009; Llorens and Domingo, 2007), as well as conifers when 

compared with broadleaves (Freedman and Prager, 1986; Keim et al., 2006). Stemflow 

decreased with bark roughness from smoother to rougher bark (Johnson and Lehmann, 

2006; Livesley et al., 2014). Besides interception, transpiration is also dependent on tree 

species, attributed to distinct stomata, leaf water potential and hydraulic conductance 

(Ewers et al., 2002). 

In addition, vegetation type have been associated with the release of different 

hydrophobic compounds, such as different resins and waxes (DeBano, 2000; Lozano et 

al., 2013; Zavala et al., 2009), leading to soil hydrophobicity which restricts infiltration 

capacity and may enhances overland flow, particularly in seasonally dry environments 

(Dekker and Ritsema, 1994). Hydrophobicity is mainly associated with dry settings

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  

 

77 

(Doerr and Thomas, 2000; Santos et al., 2013) and may influence seasonal pattern of 

overland flow, particularly under Mediterranean climate, marked by a long dry summer 

season (Doerr et al., 2000; Jordán et al., 2013). Nevertheless, under eucalypt plantations, 

hydrophobicity may persist after several rainfall events (Ferreira, 1996; Ferreira et al., 

2000). In a previously rip-ploughed eucalypt plantation area of north-central Portugal, 

hydrophobicity was found to explain 74% of overland flow variation (Ferreira et al., 

2000). 

Many studies have demonstrated differences in degrees of hydrophobicity between 

different vegetation types (e.g. DeBano, 2000; Zavala et al., 2009; Lozano et al., 2013). 

Eucalypt stands are renowned for inducing high levels of hydrophobicity (Ferreira et al., 

2000; Santos et al., 2013). In Portugal, some studies have reported greater overland flow 

under eucalypt than pine plantations caused by enhanced soil hydrophobicity (Ferreira et 

al., 2000; Keizer et al., 2005), but little is known about the slope hydrology of oak stands, 

particularly in wet Mediterranean climates. This is important as differences in overland 

flow between distinct forest stands can contribute to variations in total streamflow and 

the stormflow component with forest land-use change (Fritsch, 1993; Grip et al., 2005). 

However, in the literature, streamflow differences in areas subject to forest cover changes 

are mostly attributed to evapotranspiration adjustments. For example, Otero et al. (1994) 

reported reduced streamflow with conversion of native forest to fast-growing plantations 

of Pinus radiata. In the southern Appalachians, the conversion of a deciduous hardwood 

catchment to a Pinus strobus L. stand (eastern white pine) led to a 20% reduction of 

streamflow, attributed to the greater vegetative surface area of Pinus strobus (Swank and 

Douglass, 1974). 

Although it is widely accepted that forests regulate water yield and their soils are usually 

highly permeable (Eisenbies et al., 2007; Bathurst et al., 2011), the role of forest areas in 

flood protection has been hotly debated. Some have argued that interception and higher 

soil moisture deficits under forest should reduce floods by removing a proportion of the 

storm rainfall (e.g. Bathurst et al., 2011), whereas others have argued that such water 

retention by forest is minimal in the extreme rainfall events that are responsible for floods 

(Eisenbies et al., 2007; Hümann et al, 2011; Komatsu et al., 2011). Thus, it is argued that 

forest cover might not significantly reduce peak flows during extreme events, particularly 

in small catchments, but that it could be effective in reducing the peakflow responses of 

more frequent, less intense rainfall events (Bathurst et al., 2011).  

Impacts of different forest and woodland stands on overland flow may be particularly 

important in the hydrology of small peri-urban catchments. Such catchments tend to be 

characterized by a mosaic of different land-uses, which provide varying sources and sinks 

of overland flow (Ferreira et al., 2011). Any overland flow generated on forest areas may 

reach downslope urban areas and represent an additional contribution to the urban flood 

hazard, whereas in other cases forest patches can act as sinks for upslope-generated 

overland flow from urban surfaces. Knowledge of overland flow responses from different

forest and woodland types is arguably particularly important for land-use planning and 

water resources management of catchments undergoing partial urban development. 

This chapter investigates differences in overland flow generation, and its influencing 

factors, in distinct eucalypt and oak woodland types in a peri-urban catchment in central 

Portugal, using a plot-scale monitoring approach over a two-year period. The focus is on 

the roles played by differing temporal regimes in hydrophobicity and soil moisture of the 

woodland types studied. The implications of the results for catchment streamflow 

response in peri-urban catchments in such environments are also explored. 

 

4.2. Study Area 

The study was carried out in the peri-urban Ribeira dos Covões (8º27´W, 40º13´N) 

catchment, located 3km NW of Coimbra, the largest city in central Portugal. This 

catchment (6.2 km2) is aligned S-N and ranges in altitude from 34 to 205 m a.s.l. The area 

has a sub-humid Mediterranean climate, with a mean annual temperature of 15°C and an 

average annual rainfall of 892 mm over the period 1941-2000 recorded at Coimbra-

Bencanta (national meteorological weather station 12G/02UG), sited 0.5 km north of the 

study catchment. A distinct dry and hot season occurs from June to August (8% of annual 

rainfall), whereas the rainiest period is between November and March (61% of rainfall).  

Relatively small rainfall events are dominant over the year, with 83% of daily rainfalls 

between 2001 and 2013 at Coimbra-Bencanta being ?10 mm. Maximum daily rainfalls 

over the same 2001-13 period ranged between 20 mm and 102 mm. The catchment is 

underlain by sandstone (57%) and limestone (43%). Soils developed on sandstone are 

classified as Fluvisols and Podzols, following WRB (2006) classification, and are 

generally deep (&gt;3 m), while Leptic Cambisols found on limestone slopes are typically 

shallow (&lt;0.4 m) (Pato, 2007). 

The catchment has undergone profound land-use changes over the last five decades, 

mainly associated with rapid urbanization and increased eucalypt planting for timber 

production. Between 1958 and 2007, the urban and woodland areas expanded from 6 to 

32% and from 44 to 64%, respectively, at the expense of a marked decrease in agricultural 

land from 48 to 4%. Since 2007, however, deforestation has occurred because of a main 

road construction and the building of an enterprise park, which now occupies 5% of the 

former wooded area. Thus by 2012, the urban area had increased to 40%, while the 

woodland area had decreased to 53%.This trend towards a reduced tree cover and 

increased urbanization is expected to continue. 

Currently, wooded areas consists mainly of eucalypt plantations and few mixed stands of 

eucalypt and pine (84%), with minor fractions of scrub and herbaceous vegetation (15%) 

and relic oak woodland (1%) (Figure 4.1). The major eucalypt plantation species is 

Eucalypt globulus Labill.. Over the last years, increased eucalypt plantation in detriment

79 

of pine stands was due to harvesting interval of typically 10-12 as opposed to 50-60 years 

for pine (Robinson et al., 2003), as well as their relatively high commercial value for the 

pulp industry. Generally, eucalypt plantations are placed over sandstone, but some 

abandoned logged areas lead to sparse eucalypt stands which are densely covered by 

scrubs. These scrub areas, observed on sandstone, are dominated by heather (Erica 

scoparia L. and E. umbellata L.), broom (Pterospartum tridentatum L.) and gorse (Ulex 

europaeus L.), with eucalypt and pine encroachment. On limestone, vegetated areas are 

mainly covered by herbaceous associations, represented by grasses (mainly Salvia 

verbenaca, Geranium purpureum Vill, Vicia sp.), together with spanish broom (Spartium 

juncium L.), cypress (Cupressus sempervirens L.), pine (P. pinea L.) and olive (Olea 

europaea L.) encroachment. A relic of semi-natural oak is also observed in limestone 

area, consisting of a mixture of Quercus robur L., Q. faginea broteroi and Q. suber L. 

trees (mean high of 4 m and 25%-50% cover), with strawberry (Arbutus unedo L.) and 

laurel (Laurus nobilis L.) bushes forming the ground cover (average height: 800 mm and 

5%-25% cover). Invasive plants such as wattle (Acacia longifolia A.) and mimosa 

(Acacia dealbata L.) can be found in small numbers everywhere (Pato, 2007).

4.3. Methodology 

4.3.1. Research design and experimental setup 

Runoff plots were established in the three principal types of woodland within Ribeira dos 

Covões (Figure 4.1): (1) dense eucalypt plantation, which may include occasional pine 

and acacia trees (plots DE1, DE2 and DE3); (2) sparse eucalypt areas, with an extensive 

cover of scrub (SE1, SE2 and SE3); and (3) oak woodland (O1, O2 and O3) (Figure 4.2). 

Similar topographic and soil properties between sites were search for the plot location 

(e.g. slope angle, aspect, parent material and soil type). However, the spatial distribution 

of woodland types within the catchment and site accessibility led to topographic and 

lithological (and hence soil) differences between the three study sites. For instance, dense 

and sparse eucalypt areas were largely located on sandstone, whereas oak was only 

overlaying on limestone.

plantation, b) sparse eucalypt, dominated by scrub, and c) oak woodland. 

 

Each of the study sites was instrumented with three runoff plots placed 20 – 500 m apart, 

depending on local constraints (e.g. avoiding close proximity to tracks and locations with 

extensive stone lag). The plots were 2 m wide by 8 m long, bounded by metal strips of 

150 mm high inserted into the soil to a depth of 50-100 mm. A modified Gerlach trough 

(Gerlach, 1967) was installed at the outlet of each plot to collect the overland flow and to 

retain the &gt;0.5 mm fraction of the eroded material with the aid of a mesh. Overland flow 

was then routed via a garden hose, first to an automatic tipping-bucket device with a 

capacity of 0.5-L per tip (connected to a data logger), using an in-house design, and then 

to a 50-L tank. Plot installation was completed on 10th January 2011, but data collection 

started one month later, in order for the plots to recover from any disturbance caused 

during installation. 

Each plot was further equipped with five throughfall gauges as well as with five automatic 

soil moisture probes to give an approximate idea of differences between woodland types. 

The throughfall gauges comprised funnels (Ø 200 mm) connected to a storage bottle,

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  

 

81 

installed within half-buried PVC pipes (Ø 200 mm; height: 300 mm). The five gauges 

were placed randomly 0.5-2 m outside the plot boundaries beneath the tree and/or scrub 

vegetation. The soil moisture probes (Decagon EC-5, connected to Hobbo data logger) 

were divided amongst three soil depths (2 sensors at 0-20 mm, 2 sensors at 50-100 mm, 

and 1 sensor at 150-200 mm) and installed at 2-5 m distance from the plot boundaries. 

Volumetric soil moisture content was recorded at 5-min intervals. Laboratory calibration 

per woodland site was performed before installation in the field, using columns of sieved 

soil (&lt;2 mm) from the sites where the sensor was going to be installed, on repacked soil 

material at the average dry bulk density of the sites. A linear curve was found to provide 

the best calibration for the sensor data in the three woodland sites. However, theft of 

devices considerably restricted soil moisture data acquisition. 

Overland flow and throughfall were measured at mostly 1- to 2- weekly intervals, 

depending on previous rainfall, during the two years of study (9th February 2011 – 14th 

April 2013), in a total of 61 measurement occasions. Throughfall measurements in the 

oak woodland started later than the plot measurements on 23rd March 2011. A visual 

general description of the vegetation cover was performed at the beginning of the study 

period. 

In the second week of March 2012, part of the dense eucalypt site was clear-felled, 

affecting two of the three existing plots (DE1 and DE2). Plot DE2 had to be abandoned 

since it was destroyed by logging activities.  Owing to vandalism (theft in particular), the 

other two plots at the dense eucalypt site could only be monitored for total runoff. 

Furthermore, due to theft of equipment on several occasions after clear-felling, 

throughfall measurement at the dense eucalypt plot locations was also abandoned. 

Rainfall was recorded continuously using five tipping-bucket rain-gauges (Davis 

Instruments) in open areas within and near the catchment. No significant inter-gauge 

spatial rainfall variation was identified, so that the weighted average of the five 

raingauges was used. 

 

4.3.2. Soil data collection 

During monitoring, at the same time as overland flow measurements, soil hydrophobicity 

was assessed at 0-20 mm, 20-50 mm and 50-100 mm depths along two 1-m transects at 

either side of each plot using the ‘Molarity of an Ethanol Drop test’ (Doerr, 1998). Sets 

of fifteen droplets of increasing ethanol concentration were applied along each transect 

until infiltration of at least eight droplets of the same concentration occurred within 5 

seconds. The results for each transect were classified according to the following five 

repellency ratings and associated ethanol concentrations: wettable (0%); low (1, 3 and

82 

5%); moderate (8.5 and 13%); severe (18 and 24 %); and extreme (36 and &gt;36 %) 

hydrophobicity.   

In addition, on each fieldwork visit, one composite sample per plot (0-50 mm soil depth), 

obtained by mixing 10 samples collected randomly on undisturbed land around each plot. 

Gravimetric was converted into volumetric water content using the mean soil bulk density 

of each site, calculated from 11 random samples of  143 cm3 volume collected near to 

each plot, using soil ring samplers of 50 mm diameter. These laboratory measurements 

were considered highly important to assure soil moisture data over the study period, since 

malfunctioning and theft of soil moisture probes severely restricted the field data 

aquisition. Because of this, the soil moisture data used in the results and discussion 

sections relates to the soil samples and laboratory assessment, thus no soil moisture data 

from probes are shown.  

Throughout the first year of study, soil matrix infiltration capacity was measured on 12 

occasions, covering different weather conditions. The measurements were performed 

with a mini-disk tension infiltrometer (Decagon Devices), carrying out one experiment 

alongside each transect. Overall, 216 measurements were performed. Unsaturated 

hydraulic conductivity (Kuns) was calculated from soil matrix infiltration capacity, based 

on Decagon's instruction manual (Decagon, 2007). 

The physical properties of surface soil (0-50 mm) were sampled in January 2011. Around 

each runoff plot, six core samples of 137.4 cm3 were collected to determine dry bulk 

density following Dane and Topp (2002). In addition, 10 sub-samples were collected 

manually with a scoop and mixed to create one composite sample of c. 1.5 kg per plot. 

These samples were then oven dried at 38°C until a constant weight was reached and 

sieved to obtain the&amp;lt;2 mm fraction. This fine-earth fraction was analyzed with respect 

to organic matter content using infra-red detection after oxidation at 600°C (SC-144DR 

equipment, Strohlein Instruments) (LECO, 1997) and particle size distribution, using the 

standard pipette method (Dane and Topp, 2002). 

 

4.3.3. Data analysis 

In view of the non-normal distribution of the overland flow, throughfall, soil moisture 

and hydrophobicity data, non-parametric statistical tests were used to assess differences 

in median values between the three forest types and between plots of the same forest type. 

The Kruskal–Wallis test was employed to test the significance (p&lt;0.05) of the differences 

with woodland type in overland flow, throughfall, hydrophobicity and soil moisture, and 

their seasonal variations. The Spearman correlation coefficient (r) was used to assess 

whether significant associations (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01) existed between rainfall 

characteristics (1- to 2-weekly totals, maximum 30-min rainfall intensities (I30) and 

antecedent rainfall over the previous 30 days) and soil hydrological properties

(hydrophobicity and soil moisture), as well as overland flow. All statistical analyses were 

carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software. 

 

4.4. Results and analysis 

4.4.1. Biophysical properties of the study sites 

Vegetation differences between sites are linked to the woodland types and can be 

observed in Table 3.1. The greater tree density is clearly found in the dense eucalypt 

stands and contrast with the dominant cover of scrubs in sparse eucalypt areas. Despite 

the lower trees density in oak compared with dense eucalypt, oak canopy covers all the 

woodland area. Under dense eucalypt stands, the clear-felling performed in the first week 

of February 2012, removed the canopy cover, but biomass waste (leaves and smaller 

branches) was left on site. Eucalypt regrowth started in late April, following some rain 

but became more rapid by autumn. At the beginning of January 2013, a few trees 

surrounding the O2 plot were cut and the tree canopy cover decreased by about 20% near 

the upper boundary. Despite not being measured, the canopy cover decreased in 

autumn/winter for these deciduous trees, with a corresponding increase in the litter layer.

S: sandy, SL: sandy loam, L: loamy, LS: loamy sand. 

  

 

The location of woodland types across the catchment and problems with accessibility led 

to differences in the site characteristics and soil properties between runoff plots (Table 

3.1). Dense eucalypt plots were mainly on W- and NW-facing moderate slopes, sparse 

eucalypt on NE-facing steeper slopes, whereas oak locates on W-facing gentle slopes. 

Oak woodland, was on loamy soil laid on limestone, contrasting with dense and sparse 

eucalypt stands, mostly sandy loam and loamy sand soils, respectively, overlying 

sandstone. Soil depth in oak forest site (~0.4 m) was lower than in hardwood and scrub 

(&gt;2m). Soil organic matter was significantly lower in sparse eucalypt sites (4%) than in 

the dense eucalypt plantation (8%) or in the oak woodland (6%). In contrast, the soil of 

the sparse eucalypt site had a significantly higher bulk density (1.22 g cm-3) than that of 

the dense eucalypt site (0.69 g cm-3) and of the oak site (0.73 g cm-3).  

Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity ranged from very slow (?1 mm h-1) to slow (&gt;1 mm 

and ?5 mm h-1) over the year, according to Kohnke’s (1968) classification (Figure 4.3). 

Values were in general higher in dense eucalypt (0.9 mm h-1) than in sparse eucalypt and 

oak (0.6 mm h-1 for both woodland types) (p&lt;0.05). Over the year, Kuns in eucalypt sites 

(dense and open) was greater in winter and spring seasons than in summer and autumn 

(dense: 1.4 vs 0.6 mm h-1; open: 0.7 vs 0.3 mm h-1; p&lt;0.05), whereas in oak woodland no 

significant difference was observed (p&gt;0.05). Kuns increased with increasing soil organic 

matter content (r=0.60, p&lt;0.01) and decreased with increasing bulk density (r=-0.34, 

p&lt;0.01). It was also affected by particle size, increasing with a greater sand fraction 

(r=0.74, p&lt;0.01) and decreasing with increasing silt and clay fractions (r=-0.72 and -0.47, 

p&lt;0.01).

4.4.2. Rainfall 

Overall, the 2-year period was relatively dry, with rainfall in 2011 and 2012 (607 and 565 

mm) being 32 and 36% below the long-term (1941-2000) average of 892 mm. 

Nevertheless, the study period included three months that were wetter than their long-

term averages (1941-2000): November 2011 (163 vs. 111 mm), January 2013 (166 vs. 

116 mm) and March 2013 (228 vs. 87 mm). The differences in rainfall patterns between 

the studied years were also noticeable from the number of rainy days: 91 during the four 

months of monitoring in 2013 vs. 99 over the 11 months of measurements in 2011. In 

2012, there were 157 rainy days, similar to the reference period (128±14 rain days per 

year) (Figure 4.4).

14th April 2013: (a) over the time; b) total rainfall amount and average maximum 30-min 

rainfall intensity (I30). 

 

Seasonal patterns in rainfall were pronounced during the study period and followed the 

typical Mediterranean intra-annual variation, with distinctively lower rainfall in summer 

(4% of total rainfall) comparing with the other seasons (autumn: 35%, winter: 32% and 

spring: 28%) (p&lt;0.05). Nevertheless, extremely dry conditions were observed in winter 

2011/12 (21st December 2011 – 20th March 2012), pointing out the significant inter-

annual variation between this and 2010 (from 9th February to 20th March 2011) and 

2012/13 (21st December 2012 – 14th April 2013) winters (p&lt;0.05). Spring 2013 (only until 

14th April) was also rainiest than spring 2012 (120 mm and 182 mm, p&lt;0.05). No inter-

annual variability was observed among summers (42 mm vs 35 mm in 2011 and 2012) 

and autumns seasons (257 mm vs 297 mm in 2011 and 2012) (p&gt;0.05). 

Over the study period, most of the rainfall intensity was lower than 1 mm h-1 (67%), and 

intensities between 1 and 5 mm day-1 characterised 29% of the rainfall days. Values 

greater than 5 mm day-1 did not exceed 4% of the daily rainfall. No significant intra-

annual variability was observed in between rainy days, or in maximum 30-min rainfall 

intensities (p&gt;0.05).

The 61 measurement periods differed markedly in total rainfall amount (1.8-113 mm), 

number of rainfall days (2-12) and maximum 30-min rainfall intensity (I30: 0.6-24.8 mm 

h-1) (Figure 4.4), but none represented extreme rainfall events, since all beneath 2-years 

Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves of Coimbra (Brandão et al., 2001). Total rainfall 

amounts and I30’s were significantly correlated (r =0.66, p&lt;0.01) but there were several 

instances of minor rainfall amounts due to short-term high-intensity events. 

 

4.4.3. Temporal pattern of hydrological variables 

4.4.3.1. Throughfall 

Overall throughfall for the period 2nd April 2011 to 5th March 2012 (periods 3-23), when 

measurements were carried out at all three woodland sites, was higher in dense eucalypt 

(99% of rainfall) than in sparse eucalypt (85%) and oak stands (67%) (Figure 4.5). For 

the 2-year period 2nd April 2011 to 14th April 2013 (periods 3-61), however, overall 

throughfall represented 97% and 72% of rainfall in sparse eucalypt and oak stands 

respectively. In both periods, no significant difference was identified in percentage 

throughfall between woodland types (p&gt;0.05). No significant difference in throughfall 

between the gauges installed in each runoff plot was identified, except in O1 (overall 

study period average and standard deviation of 21±22 mm) and sparse eucalypt plots 

(SE1: 23±23 mm, SE2: 27±21 mm and SE3: 23±23 mm) (p&lt;0.05). 

Throughfall represented variable fractions of the rainfall over the year, with generally 

lower values under oak (85±33%) than eucalypt woodland (96±50% and 96±34% in both 

dense and sparse eucalypt). Nevertheless, there were monitored periods where the 

throughfall amounted to higher values than the rainfall in all the study sites, particularly 

in dense eucalypt areas and, for fewer measurements, under oak woodland. Median 

differences between rainfall and throughfall reached 6-7 mm in dense eucalypt (6.7, 6.0 

and 6.8 mm in DE1, DE2 and DE3, respectively), 4-5 mm in sparse eucalypt (4.5, 4.3 and 

5.1 mm in SE1, SE2 and SE3, respectively) and 4-6 mm in oak woodland (3.7, 5.6 and 

4.1 mm in SE1, SE2 and SE3, respectively). Nevertheless, maximum water retention 

reached 30-38 mm at the dense eucalypt, 30-40 mm at the sparse eucalypt and 18-20 mm 

at the oak woodland for the period 11, during autumn (maximum rainfall and I30 for the 

whole study period, Figure 4.3).

OF WOODLAND AREAS WITHIN A PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT

Figure 4.5 - Weighted average rainfall amount and median throughfall per woodland type, for 

the 61 measurement periods from 9th February 2011 to 14th April 2013. Throughfall results only 

until 5th March 2012 in dense eucalypt plantation due to collectors’ theft. 

 

Throughfall increased significantly with rainfall amount and maximum intensity (r=0.83 

and 0.57, respectively; p&lt;0.01). Generally throughfall percentages were lower in dry than 

wet periods, with median values of 90%, 74% and 46% in summer, and 93%, 92% and 

86% in winter, for dense eucalypt, sparse eucalypt and oak stands, respectively. However, 

there was not a significant seasonal pattern of throughfall (p&gt;0.05). Despite throughfall 

increased with rainfall, in smaller storm events the percentage of rainfall intercepted was 

also greater, particularly during drier periods. No throughfall was measured in any of the 

plots for rainfalls of 3.3 mm and 3.7 mm measured during summer (periods 10 and 34). 

However, for a rainfall event of 3.7 mm measured in late winter (period 23), throughfall 

represented 14% and 7% of the rainfall in dense eucalypt and oak woodland (under sparse 

eucalypt throughfall was higher than rainfall). 

 

4.4.3.2. Hydrophobicity 

In all the soil layers, hydrophobicity was most severe and frequent in the dense eucalypt 

plantations, intermediate in the sparse eucalypt stand and lowest in the oak woodland  

(p&lt;0.05) (Figure 4.6). In the oak stand, hydrophobicity was absent on most measurement 

dates (69% at both 0-20 mm and 20-50 mm and 48% at 50-100 mm) and was largely of 

low or moderate severity when present. Hydrophobicity was mainly transient in nature, 

being recorded in all the sampling sites only on 14%, 13% and 17% of monitoring 

occasions, at 0-20 mm, 20-50 mm and 50-100 mm depth respectively. In the sparse 

eucalypt site, hydrophobicity showed the greatest spatial and temporal variations with 

hydrophilic conditions dominant on 49%, 34% and 39% of the measurement dates, at 0-

20 mm, 20-50 mm and 50-100 mm, respectively, but with moderate to severe classes

being more representative when hydrophobicity was recorded. Similar to oak woodland, 

the sparse eucalypt stand also showed a transient and patchy hydrophobic pattern, with 

widespread hydrophobic properties recorded in just 26% of the 61 measurement periods 

at 0-20 mm and 50-100 mm and 24% of occasions at 20-50 mm depth. In contrast, in 

dense eucalypt plantations, hydrophilic conditions were only observed on 41, 15 and 13% 

of occasions, at 0-20 mm, 20-50 mm and 50-100 mm depth respectively, with severe to 

extreme hydrophobic properties being dominant and widespread, forming a continuous 

surface area in 53, 55 and 70%, respectively, of  occasions when hydrophobicity was 

present. 

Hydrophobicity showed the same marked seasonal patterns at all three study sites. It was 

typically absent during late autumn and winter, and most severe and widespread during 

summer. After dry periods, hydrophobicity was more resistant to being broken down 

during rainfall events in eucalypt plantations and disappeared earlier in oak woodland. 

Also, when drier conditions were restored, hydrophobicity was re-established more 

quickly under eucalypt than under oak. Thus after the largest rainfalls in autumn 2011 

and beginning of winter 2012, hydrophobicity required five months longer to reappear in 

oak than in the eucalypt stands.   

In dense eucalypt stands, hydrophobicity increased in frequency and severity with soil 

depth (increasing from 44 to 59% of the monitored periods between 0-20 mm and 50-100 

mm layers, p&lt;0.05). Also, a greater number of rainstorms were required to reduce 

hydrophobicity levels in deeper soil. Extreme hydrophobicity was recorded on 18, 13 and 

30% of occasions, respectively, at 0-20 mm, 20-50 mm and 50-100 mm. A similar pattern 

with depth occurred in the sparse eucalypt site, despite lower hydrophobicity severity and 

coverage (extreme hydrophobicity was recorded in 8, 13 and 15% of occasions, at 0-20 

mm, 20-50 mm and 50-100 mm depth respectively). In contrast to eucalypt sites, 

hydrophobicity did not vary statistically with soil depth in oak woodland (p&gt;0.05), 

although it showed a tendency to decrease in severity but increase in temporal frequency 

with soil depth (Figure 4.6).  

Although hydrophobicity severity and spatial frequency varied with antecedent weather 

at all stands and at all depths, inverse relationships with storm rainfall and throughfall 

amount, although statistically significant (p&lt;0.01), are weak (r never exceeding -0.31) 

and are not statistically significant in the case of maximum rainfall intensity (p&gt;0.05). 

Particle size and organic matter content were weakly correlated with hydrophobicity. 

Hydrophobicity slightly increased with increasing sand content (r=0.25, 0.28 and 0.34 for 

increasing soil depths, p&lt;0.01) and organic matter content at the subsurface (r=0.14, 0.16 

and 0.22 for increasing soil depths, p&lt;0.01), and was negatively correlated with silt (r=-

0.26, -0.30 and -0.36 for deeper soil layers, p&lt;0.01) and clay (r=-0.15, -0.18 and -0.23 for 

increasing soil depths, p&lt;0.01) fractions.

4.4.3.3. Soil moisture content  

Median surface soil moisture content (0-50 mm), measured under laboratory conditions 

for samples collected during monitoring periods, was similar between dense (15%) and 

sparse (18%) eucalypt stands (p&gt;0.05), but both were significantly lower than at oak sites 

(29%) (p&lt;0.05) (Figure 4.7). 

 

 

Figure 4.7 - Median surface soil moisture content per woodland type for the 61 measurement 

periods from 9th February 2011 to 14th April 2013. 

 

During the study period, no significant difference on soil moisture content was found 

among the three plots at the dense and sparse eucalypt sites (p&gt;0.05). However, under 

oak woodland, plot O2 had significantly higher values than the other two plots (O1: 29%, 

O2: 35% and O3: 25%) (p&lt;0.05). In dense eucalypt stands, DE1 clear-felling in March 

2012 (period 22) did not significantly affect soil moisture content, but it seemed to change 

the spatial patterns. Before logging, higher soil moisture content was measured in ED3, 

whereas after clear-felling it was observed in DE1, but differences became more alike 

with eucalypt regeneration in DE1. Despite not clearly noticed, thinning of 20% of O3 

canopy cover (period 48) may slightly increase soil moisture content. In fact, soil moisture 

was generally lowest in plot O3 before thinning, whereas after it was greater than O1, but 

still lower than O2.  

Soil moisture content increased significantly with preceding period rainfall amount and 

throughfall (p&lt;0.01), although the relationships were not very strong (Table 4.2). It was 

substantially lower in summer than during the other seasons (p&lt;0.05), with a similar 

median value (8%) for all woodland types. Soil moisture increased slightly from spring, 

to autumn and winter (21, 24 and 25%, respectively), but with variations between the two

years. During spring, median soil moisture content was higher in 2013 (22%) than in both 

2011 (16%) and 2012 (11%) (p&lt;0.05). Through autumn, soil moisture was significantly 

higher in 2011 than in 2012 (28% vs 17%) (p&lt;0.05). Over winter, median soil moisture 

reached highest values in 2013 (26 % compared with 19% in 2011 and 20% in 2012). 

Generally, higher soil moisture content was observed during autumn 2011 (median values 

of 27%, 33% and 27% for DE, SE and O, respectively), winter 2013 (median values of 

23%, 24% and 36% for DE, SE and O, respectively) and spring 2013 (median values of 

18%, 22% and 36% for DE, SE and O, respectively). Soil moisture content reached 

highest values of 37%, 32% and 49% in DE, SE and O in winter 2013, but the peak value 

of 47% in the SE site was attained in autumn 2011. 

Overall, considering the results from all plots together, soil moisture content increased 

significantly with increasing rainfall and throughfall amounts, but the relationship were 

rather weak (r=0.25 and 0.20, respectively, p&lt;0.01), even excluding the summers season 

due to the lowest throughfall percentages associated with driest conditions. Nevertheless, 

no significant correlation between soil moisture and rainfall was identified in oak 

woodland. Rainfall intensity was not significantly correlated with soil moisture content 

(p&gt;0.05). Hydrophobicity decreased with soil moisture increase, but correlations were 

weaker at greater soil depth (r=-0.51, -0.52 and -0.42 for depths of 0-20 mm, 20-50 mm 

and 50-100 mm). Generally, soil moisture differences between runoff plots may be 

partially explained by topographic characteristics and soil properties, considering their 

significant influence despite the poor correlations. Soil moisture decreased with 

increasing slope angle (r=-0.32,&amp;lt;0.01) and was affected by particle size distribution, 

increasing with increasing silt (r=0.20, p&lt;0.01) and clay (r=0.09, p&lt;0.05) contents and 

decreasing with sand content (r=-0.19, p&lt;0.01), although the weak correlations. 

 

4.4.3.4. Overland flow 

Overland flow was generated in most measurement periods (97, 92 and 89% of the 

occasions for dense eucalypt, sparse eucalypt and oak stands, respectively), although 

runoff coefficients represented less than 1% over the 2 years (Figure 4.8). Overland flow 

exceeded 1% of period rainfall on just 8, 4 and 3 occasions out of 61 for dense eucalypt, 

sparse eucalypt and oak sites respectively, but never exceeded 3%. Overland flow was 

significantly higher in the dense eucalypt plantation than in the sparse eucalypt and oak 

stands (overall values of 6.9 mm, 2.6 mm and 2.9 mm, respectively) (p&lt;0.05).  

Differences in the temporal pattern of overland flow were also observed between 

woodland stands. Dense eucalypt plantation plots generated greater percentage overland 

flow (medians of up to 2.2%) in rainstorms occurring in dry settings (late spring, summer 

and at the beginning of autumn), whereas in wet conditions it was lower than 1.0%. In 

the sparse eucalypt stand, overland flow varied less over the year, with maximum runoff 

coefficients of 0.5% and 1.2% in both dry and wet settings (mainly in spring, autumn and 



LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  

 

93 

winter periods). In the dense eucalypt plantation, the highest percentage overland flow 

values were recorded in rainfall events that were moderate (4-23 mm and I30= 3-16 mm 

h-1) and in the sparse eucalypt stand highest percentage overland flow occurred in 

relatively small rainfall events (4-10 mm and I30=3-6 mm h
-1). In contrast to eucalypt 

sites, overland flow in oak woodland was mainly produced after the wettest antecedent 

weather and soil moisture conditions, attaining higher values mainly after larger rainfall 

events (&gt;10 mm), which were mostly experienced in winter and spring 2013, the wettest 

measurement periods in the 2-year study. Even under the wettest conditions, however, 

the runoff coefficient only reached 2.2% in the oak stand (but median values of three 

replicated plots did not exceed 0.6%), whereas following dry weather it did not exceed 

0.4%.  

 

 

Figure 4.8 - Median overland flow, expressed as amount and percentage rainfall, per woodland 

type for the 61 measurement periods from 9th February 2011 to 14th April 2013. 

 

Under dense eucalypt plantation, overland flow did not vary much between runoff plots, 

even after clear-felling (p&gt;0.05), except immediately after disturbance. Before tree clear-

felling (period 22), DE1 showed slightly higher overland flow amount than the other plots 

(DE1: 4.0 mm, DE2: 1.9 mm and DE3: 3.3 mm), whereas after that, the difference was 

more noticeable until period 36 (DE1: 1.3 mm and DE3: 0.9 mm). Immediately after 

harvesting, the clear-felled plot (DE1) showed the highest overland flow of the study 

period (2.3%) whereas in DE3 it did not exceed 1.0%. However, with faster vegetation 

regeneration after September 2012 due to rainfall increase after the dry period, overland 

flow in the harvested plot DE1 became lower than in the intact DE3 (2.3 mm vs 2.9 mm, 

respectively). 

Contrary to dense eucalypt woodland, plots installed in sparse eucalypt and oak sites 

showed significant differences (p&lt;0.05). In the sparse eucalypt stand, overland flow was 

higher on SE3, installed on intermediate vegetation density but with a greater number of 

trees nearby, showed higher overland flow than SE1 and SE2 (total overland flow: 5.9,

1.4 and 2.9 mm, respectively), associated with a higher number of overland flow events 

(56, 45 and 48, correspondingly, out of 61 events). In the oak site, overland flow was 

lower on O1 than at the O2 and O3 plots (2-year totals of 1.9 mm, 4.3 mm and 3.2 mm, 

respectively). The number of overland flow events showed a gradual increase with 

decreasing vegetation density (54 events in O3, 56 in O2 and 59 in O1, out of 61). The 

decrease of 20% in canopy cover on plot O3, between periods 48 and 49, however, did 

not significantly affect overland flow.  

Overland flow increased significantly with period rainfall (amount and intensity) and 

throughfall (Table 4.2), but the strength of the correlations varied with woodland type. 

Dense eucalypt plantation exhibited stronger correlations between overland flow and 

rainfall variables than the other woodland types (DE: r=0.61 and 0.62, SE: r=0.44 and 

0.34, and O: r=0.53 and 0.27 for rainfall amount and I30, respectively, p&lt;0.01). Oak 

woodland showed stronger correlations than eucalypt plantations between overland flow 

and throughfall amount (0.48, 0.46 and 0.60 for DE, SE and O stands, respectively, 

p&lt;0.01), as well as rainfall in the previous 30 days (r=0.43 and 0.26 for O and SE, 

p&lt;0.01). No significant correlation was found between overland flow and antecedent 

rainfall within dense eucalypt site (p&gt;0.5).  

Generally, overland flow correlated significantly neither with hydrophobicity or soil 

moisture content within woodland areas (p&gt;0.05, Table 4.2). Separating monitoring 

periods into wettable and hydrophobic conditions at the surface did not produce 

significant correlations with overland flow volume or coefficient. However, considering 

individual woodland types, overland flow increased with soil moisture content in the oak 

and sparse eucalypt plantations, although correlation coefficients were weak (r=0.21 and 

0.29, respectively, p&lt;0.05). 

A synthesis of significant correlations is shown on Table 4.2. A summary of statistical 

differences between hydrological properties between runoff plots is given on Table 4.3.

4.5. Discussion 

4.5.1. Spatio-temporal pattern of hydrological properties and 

woodland type 

4.5.1.1. Throughfall 

Despite the reported important role of vegetation structure and architecture in influencing 

throughfall amount (Návar, 1993; Levia and Herwitz, 2005; Levia et al., 2010; Livesley 

et al., 2014), no significant differences in throughfall were identified between the different 

woodland types in Ribeira dos Covões. Nevertheless, throughfall slightly increased from 

dense eucalypt, to oak and sparse eucalypt, following decreasing tree density. According 

to André et al. (2011) more horizontal branches in oak trees would favour drip 

development, enhancing throughfall. Differences in tree density and species, as well as 

dissimilarities in the stage of tree development between individual dense eucalypt plots 

and between woodland stands (Table 4.1), may explain the throughfall similarities found 

(Ferreira, 1996; Pypker et al, 2005; Barbier et al., 2009). For instance, the larger 

differences found within dense eucalypt plots did not show a significant influence on 

throughfall. Young forest have been reported to provide significantly lower canopy water 

storage capacity and higher direct throughfall relative to old-growth forest (Pypker et al, 

2005). Barbier et al. (2009), measured an increase of 16% of net precipitation from young 

to adult evergreen forests. Ferreira (1996) reported throughfall decreases in Eucalypt 

globulus Labill. stands from 90 to 86% for trees 5 and 10 years in age. A 5% average 

increase in throughfall was measured during the dormant phase in the Belgian deciduous 

forest relative to the growing season (André et al., 2011).  

The study performed in Ribeira dos Covões did not allow extrapolation of the influence 

of harvesting at the dense eucalypt site (due to theft) nor thinning in O3 plot. Nevertheless, 

these management activities are expected to increase throughfall. In southern France, tree 

thinning carried out to reduce 33% of the stem basal area of an evergreen Q. ilex coppice, 

caused a decrease of 31 to 20% in interception losses (Limousin et al., 2008).  

In Ribeira dos Covões throughfall percentages were generally higher than those reported 

in literature dealing with similar woodland stands. In eucalypt plantations in Ribeira dos 

Covões, median throughfall was 98%, whereas Valente et al. (1997) reported 58-92% 

throughfall under Eucalyptus globulus Labill. stands elsewhere in Portugal, whereas a 

review by Llorens and Domingo (2007) indicated 85-88% under E. globulus.  

The larger scrub cover in sparse eucalypt stand of Ribeira dos Covões, which extended 

above throughfall gauges, may be the reason for the slightly lower throughfall than that 

recorded in the dense eucalypt plantation (98 and 87%, respectively), with its limited 

underbrush cover (Table 4.1). However, since throughfall measurements were made ~30 

cm above the soil surface, actual interception by scrub less than 30 cm high would be 

missed and throughfall would be smaller than the values recorded. Previous studies have, 



LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  

 

97 

however, also reported interception losses declining under short vegetation compared 

with trees, due to lower aerodynamic roughness (Robinson et al., 2003). In shrubs and 

bushes mean relative throughfall of about 49% has been reported (Llorens and Domingo, 

2007).  

Despite, to the author’ knowledge, no throughfall measurements having been previously 

undertaken in Q. robur, Q. faginea or Q. suber (the woodland species found in the oak 

stand within the catchment), the results from Ribeira dos Covões (average throughfall of 

85%) are higher than those reported for Q. cerris L. (85-89%), Q. pyrenaica, (83-86%), 

Q. coccifera (55%) and Q. ilex (60-78%) (Llorens and Domingo, 2007).  

Throughfall was found to be affected by rainfall amount and intensity as reported in 

previous studies (e.g. Ferreira, 1996; Gash, 1979; Shachnovich et al., 2008; André et al., 

2011). No significant seasonal pattern of throughfall was observed over the study period, 

as reported in previous deciduous trees studies (Cape et al., 1991). However, generally 

lower throughfall values were measured in drier than wetter periods. For instance, rainfall 

of a particular amount in summer can be fully intercepted, whereas the same rainfall in 

winter can generate throughfall (periods 34 and 23). This may be related to antecedent 

vegetation moisture content and evapotranspiration rate, associated with antecedent 

weather conditions (rainfall and temperature) (Gash, 1979; Crockford and Richardson, 

2000; Limousin et al., 2008). For the smallest rainfall events, throughfall represents water 

passing between canopy gaps (direct throughfall), since water hitting vegetation is 

retained, whereas for increasing rainfall volumes, additional indirect throughfall is 

generated from water dripping onto the ground, as a result of canopy storage capacity 

exceedance. Increased vegetation interception during drier seasons results from generally 

lower rainfall, which may be insufficient to saturate the canopy, and higher evaporation 

(Hewlett, 1969). In addition, during the summer, the interval between rainfall events is 

generally larger, leading to lower vegetation moisture content. In a north-central 

Portuguese pine and eucalypt forest, rainfall interception during discontinuous storms 

was twice as high as during continuous ones, due to evaporation of water retained in the 

vegetation canopy between rainfall events (Ferreira, 1996).  

Throughfall results from Ribeira dos Covões must be interpreted as indicative. 

Throughfall measurements include the influence of trees canopy as well as scrub 

vegetation in eucalypt and oak woodland, leading to overestimation of water retention by 

trees when compared with other studies. Furthermore, a larger number of throughfall 

gauges should be used in order to perform a better assessment, better accounting for the 

spatial variation. Ziegler et al. (2009) reported that several trees could combine channel 

stemflow to common drip points on a trunk and large limbs, and, therefore, cause 

measured throughfall to exceed rainfall. Large spatial variability associated with 

throughfall has been reported elsewhere, attributed to precipitation patterns and structural 

characteristics of the trees (Carlyle-Moses et al., 2004; Shachnovich et al., 2008; Rodrigo 

and Ávila, 2001). Different number of measurements have been used to quantify 



CHAPTER 4 – DIFFERENCES IN OVERLAND FLOW DYNAMICS IN DIFFERENT TYPES 

OF WOODLAND AREAS WITHIN A PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT  

 

98 

throughfall, varying between 9 (e.g. Rodrigo and Ávila, 2001), 20 (Shachnovich et al, 

2008), 38 (Carlyle-Moses et al., 2004), 94 (Keim et al., 2005) and 180 (Ziegler et al., 

2009). Rodrigo and Ávila (2001) declared that the number of collectors should not be 

&lt;30, in order to obtain a good estimate of throughfall. 

 

4.5.1.2. Hydrophobicity  

In Ribeira dos Covões, soil hydrophobicity was high and resistant to breakdown under 

eucalypt stands (particularly in the dense plantation), as widely reported (Doerr et al., 

1996; Keizer et al., 2008; Santos et al., 2013). Hydrophobicity is caused by organic 

compounds, derived from living or decomposing plants or microorganisms, and it is 

intimately related with vegetation type due to exudate chemistry (e.g. Doerr et al., 2000). 

Different hydrophobic substances released by vegetation type may explain the greater 

resistance of hydrophobicity to break-down with rainfall events in eucalypt (greater in 

dense than open stands) than oak areas. This compounds type would also affect the time 

needed for new hydrophobic compound input in order to re-establish hydrophobicity after 

wet periods (e.g. Doerr et al., 2000; Doerr and Thomas, 2000), which increased from oak 

to open and dense eucalypt sites. 

In dense eucalypt stands of Ribeira dos Covões, hydrophobicity disappeared after 113 

mm (period 11), whereas Ferreira et al. (2000) found hydrophobicity persisted after 200 

mm rainfall in schist soils farther north in Portugal. Furthermore, the recorded increase 

in the extension and severity of hydrophobicity under eucalypt stands with soil depth 

contrasts with the findings of Santos et al. (2013) in similar plantations in Portugal, 

though on schist soils. The increase in and persistence of hydrophobicity with soil depth 

under eucalypt stands can indicate that hydrophobic compounds are primarily released by 

root activity (Dekker and Ritsema, 1994; Doerr et al., 1998). However, considering the 

deepness of eucalypt roots, it is more plausible that hydrophobicity at 50-100 mm results 

from surface leaching compounds during storm events (Doerr et al., 2000). High surface 

hydrophobicity found at the eucalypt harvest site (ED1) could be due to eucalypt leaves 

and branches left on the ground, the breakdown of which would have led to hydrophobic 

compounds (Doerr et al., 2000; Robinson et al., 2003; Zavala et al., 2009). In sparse 

eucalypt site, hydrophobic conditions under abundant scrub cover, were also reported 

under similar climatic conditions, 50 km from the study site (Stoof et al., 2011; Walsh et 

al., 2012). 

Under the oak woodland, the observed low severity and persistence of hydrophobicity 

accord with the findings of Cerdà and Doerr (2005) for Q. coccifera in south-eastern 

Spain. However, the similar hydrophobicity found between soil depths in Ribeira dos 

Covões is in contrast to the progressive decrease described for oakwood soils in northeast 

Spain (Badía et al., 2013). 



LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  

 

99 

The recorded differences in soil hydrophobic properties between woodland types in 

Ribeira dos Covões (dense eucalypt&gt;sparse eucalypt&gt;oak) may in part be linked to 

vegetation type and density, but could also be linked to soil texture differences. 

Hydrophobicity is more frequently associated with coarse-textured soils, since coarse 

particles are more susceptible to develop hydrophobicity due to a smaller surface area per 

unit volume compared with fine-textured soils (DeBano, 1991; Doerr et al., 2000; Cerdà 

and Doerr, 2007; Martínez-Zavala and Jordán-López, 2009; González-Peñaloza et al., 

2013). This could enhance the hydrophobicity on the sandier eucalypt locations compared 

with the loamy oak woodland sites. Although not common in clay-rich soils, the type of 

clay has been reported as important in hydrophobicity formation (DeBano, 2000; Diehl, 

2013; McKissock et al., 2002; Zavala et al., 2009).  

Reported relationships between hydrophobicity and soil organic matter have been very 

inconsistent, and some authors suggest that the kinds of organic matter compounds (e.g. 

aliphatic and amphiphilic hydrocarbons structure, the presence of tannins, phenolic 

compounds, lipids and the humic/fulvic acids proportion) are more important than the 

amount (Doerr et al., 2000; Diehl, 2013; de Blas et al., 2010; McKissock et al., 2002; 

Jordán et al., 2013). According to Zavala et al. (2009), soil and vegetation parameters 

need to be considered together. 

The seasonal hydrophobicity pattern characterized by greater severity and spatial extent 

in dry periods, as well as lower under wet settings, has been widely reported (Dekker and 

Ritsema, 1994; DeBano, 2000; Doerr et al., 2000; Santos et al., 2013) and is clearly linked 

to the antecedent rainfall pattern. The significant negative correlations found between 

hydrophobicity and antecedent rainfall were also recorded by Buczko et al. (2007), but 

not by Santos et al. (2013) for other eucalypt sites in Portugal.  

 

4.5.1.3. Soil moisture 

The higher soil moisture content recorded under oak than in the two eucalypt stands may 

be associated with higher water retention by the finer-textured soil overlying limestone 

bedrock compared with the coarser sandstone soils of the eucalypt areas, causing lower 

percolation (as unsaturated hydraulic conductivity results showed) and higher soil 

moisture content. Soil texture has been reported to influence the spatial variability of soil 

moisture particularly in wet conditions (Baroni et al., 2013). The higher soil moisture 

content under oak, however, could also be the result of: (1) more effective ponding by 

underlying bedrock in the shallower soil (&lt;0.4 m on limestone as opposed to &gt;3 m in 

sandstone), as found elsewhere by Maeda et al. (2006), Hardie et al. (2012) and Yang et 

al. (2012); (2) the lower slope angles (13-22º as opposed to 16-26º and 26-28º in dense 

and sparse eucalypt plots), which gives more opportunity for infiltration and therefore 

increased soil moisture as found elsewhere by Zhu and Lin (2011); (3) the lower position 



CHAPTER 4 – DIFFERENCES IN OVERLAND FLOW DYNAMICS IN DIFFERENT TYPES 

OF WOODLAND AREAS WITHIN A PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT  

 

100 

of oak plots on the hillslope (Table 4.1), leading to more effective moisture accumulation 

and retention than upslope (Kim, 2009; Ridolfi et al., 2003); and (4) the presence of a few 

relict stone walls in the oak woodland which may have increased water retention, as found 

elsewhere by Yang et al. (2012). 

In addition to differences in soil properties and terrain characteristics, higher soil moisture 

under oak than eucalypt sites may be linked to factors driven by vegetation, such as 

transpiration and hydrophobicity (less intense and less frequent in oak woodland soil). 

Eucalypt trees are usually associated with greatest water demand (Robinson et al., 2003; 

Yang et al., 2012), leading to lower soil moisture content than oak woodland. Previous 

reports from Portugal, showed that daily transpiration from a mature Eucalyptus globulus 

Labill. stand varied between 0.5 and 3.6 mm day-1 during a spring-summer period (David 

et al., 1997). In south-eastern Australia, Forrester et al. (2010) reported a transpiration 

increase of eucalyptus plantations from 0.4 mm day?1 at age 2 years to a peak of about 

1.6–1.9 mm day?1 in stands aged 5–7 years. Lower transpiration was reported in Quercus 

ilex L., in Catalonia, NE Spain, which ranged from 464 mm year-1 and 453 mm year-1 in 

valley and ridge-top locations of a forest catchment, respectively (Sala and Tenhunen, 

1996).  

In Ribeira dos Covões, the higher soil moisture content in oak than eucalypt stands, 

however, does not seem to result from greater water consumption by eucalypt trees, since 

no significant difference in soil moisture was found between dense and sparse eucalypt 

stands. Nevertheless, the high evapotranspiration rate of extensive scrub cover can be 

similar to that of eucalypt trees (Bellot et al., 2004; Hümann et al., 2011; Yang et al., 

2012), which could lead to the absence of significant soil moisture differences in distinct 

eucalypt stands. The high evapotranspiration provided by the scrub cover may also 

counterbalance the higher soil water retention expected at the sparse than dense eucalypt 

stands, due to higher silt and clay contents (Table 4.1). 

Harvesting (DE1) and thinning (O3) performed in wet periods seemed to enhance soil 

moisture content, as a result of higher throughfall. Nevertheless, lower soil moisture 

content would be expected if harvesting was performed in dry weather, because of higher 

exposure to insolation (Ferreira, 1996; Scherer and Pike, 2003; Vernimmen et al., 2007; 

Ensenbies et al., 2007). The litter layer also intercepts incoming radiation, reducing soil 

evaporation and increasing water retention capacity (Ogée and Brunet, 2002; Matthews, 

2005; Savva et al., 2013). Greater litter thickness and lower soil bulk density may explain 

greater soil moisture content at the O2 plot compared with O1 and O3 plots. Differences 

in the litter layer could have masked the effect of different tree densities in the eucalypt 

areas. 

Surface soil moisture content seemed to be strongly associated with hydrophobicity 

pattern. Generally, soil moisture was low when hydrophobicity was most severe and high 

when hydrophobicity was weak or absent. Soil hydrophobicity blocks water infiltration, 

which is usually restricted to preferential pathways provided by root holes and burrows,

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  

 

101 

channels, cracks and stones (Urbanek and Shakesby, 2009; Wang et al., 2013). Such 

patchy infiltration leads to a heterogeneous soil moisture distribution (Dekker and 

Ritsema, 1994; DeBano, 2000; Doerr et al., 2000; Tumer et al., 2005). Stronger 

persistence of hydrophobicity under dense eucalypt stand could have led to a lower soil 

moisture content compared with the sparse eucalypt site, as well as lowest values under 

oak woodland. 

In Ribeira dos Covões, hydrophobicity was absent above soil moisture contents of 33, 21 

and 32% in dense eucalypt, sparse eucalypt and oak woodland, respectively (Figure 4.9). 

Similarly, extreme hydrophobicity was not recorded for soil moistures above 26, 18 and 

21%, respectively, reinforcing the view of the highly resilient nature of hydrophobicity 

in dense eucalypt plantations. Differences in the critical moisture content for the existence 

of hydrophobicity between woodland types may be linked to variations in soil texture 

(Doerr et al., 2000) and soil organic matter (Tumer et al., 2005; Jordán et al., 2013), where 

the latter may be linked to species of trees and understorey vegetation. Previous studies 

have reported hydrophobicity for soil moisture contents of up to 22% in sandy loam soils 

(Doerr and Thomas, 2000), and as high as 38% in clayey soils (Dekker and Ritsema, 

1994). Under eucalypt plantations in central Portugal, Santos et al. (2013) reported the 

dominance of strong and extreme hydrophobicity in schist soils when soil moisture 

content was below 14%, which is lower than for the Ribeira dos Covões findings.  

 

 

Figure 4.9 - Average soil moisture variability within hydrophobicity classes (1: wettable, 2: low, 

3: moderate, 4: severe and 5: extreme hydrophobicity) for different forest types. 

 

Temporal pattern of surface soil moisture was affected by variation in rainfall, as reported 

in previous studies (Bellot et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2012), as well as throughfall, as 

observed by Ferreira et al. (2000). However, no correlation between throughfall and soil 

moisture was identified by Shachnovich et al. (2008).

4.5.1.4. Overland flow 

Runoff plots installed in Ribeira dos Covões recorded very low overland flow coefficients 

(&lt;3%) in woodland sites. Generally, vegetation enhances infiltration, particularly in tree 

stands because of their comparatively deep root systems (Calvo-Cases et al., 2003; 

Hümann et al., 2011; Komatsu et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the underlying bedrock can 

have an important effect on slope hydrology, particularly influencing infiltration and 

overland flow (Hattanji and Onda, 2004; Zhang and Hiscock, 2010). Generally, coarse-

textured soils associated with sandstone are usually highly permeable, allowing water to 

drain freely. High permeability of limestone soils has been also widely reported in areas 

of Mediterranean climate (e.g. Calvo-Cases et al., 2003; Cerdà, 1997). Although bedrock 

differences in the study catchment may mask the influence of woodland type, significant 

overland flow differences were found between dense and sparse eucalypt despite both 

being on sandstone, and no significant overland flow difference was identified between 

sparse eucalypt and oak stands, despite the latter overlying limestone. Spatio-temporal 

variation in overland flow pattern between woodland types is thought instead to be a 

consequence of hydrophobicity differences, since no significant throughfall difference 

was found between woodland stands, and soil moisture was higher in oak soils, where 

overland flow was lower. 

In storm events following dry weather, the most likely cause of overland flow seemed to 

be infiltration-excess caused by hydrophobic soils. Infiltration-excess overland flow 

under hydrophobic conditions have been widely reported (e.g. DeBano 2000; Doerr et al., 

2000; Hümann et al, 2011). Thus the greater severity of hydrophobicity in the dense 

eucalypt plantation is considered to be the reason for its greater overland flow (Figure 

4.10), especially in larger rainstorms. In the sparse eucalypt stand, the moderate or severe 

and patchier hydrophobicity broke down more easily as a result of rainfall (see section 

4.4.3.2), thereby explaining the lower overland flow than in the dense eucalypt 

plantations. Nevertheless, smaller rainfall events (3.7 mm and 9.5 mm in period 23 and 

25) failed to break down soil hydrophobicity in the sparse eucalyptus (Figure 4.6), which 

may explain the higher percentage overland recorded in those periods (Figure 4.8). In oak 

woodland, the low or moderate hydrophobicity and its much patchier nature would 

explain why infiltration-excess overland flow responses were very small even after 

prolonged dry weather. Differences in the breakdown resistance of hydrophobic 

properties may be the reason for a stronger correlation between overland flow and rainfall 

in dense eucalypt plantation than in the other woodland types (see section 4.4.3.4).

Figure 4.10 - Variation of overland flow coefficient according with surface hydrophobicity (1: 

wettable, 2: low, 3: moderate, 4: severe and 5: extreme hydrophobicity) for different monitored 

plots. 

Even under extreme hydrophobic conditions, however, overland flow was minor. Thus, 

the maximum runoff coefficient in dense eucalypt plantations never exceeded 2.2%. This 

peak runoff is lower than the maximum of 10% measured in similar experimental plots 

under similar eucalypt stands in north-central Portugal following a long dry season, 

though for schist soils (Ferreira et al., 2000). The low overland flow under extreme 

hydrophobicity indicates the role of water sinks within the woodland soils. Given the 

relatively low soil moisture content in hydrophobic soils, infiltration would seem to 

occur: (1) in hydrophilic soil patches, linked to a discontinuous hydrophobic layer, 

particularly under oak and sparse eucalypt stands (Figure 4.6); and (2) via preferential 

flow routes provided by cracks and root holes, although stones in sufficient quantities 

may also promote infiltration (Urbanek and Shakesby, 2009). Several authors have 

reported the relevance of preferential flow patterns for water infiltration in hydrophobic 

soils (DeBano, 2000; Doerr et al., 2000; Buczo et al., 2006). In hydrophobic sandy and 

sandy loam soils elsewhere, &gt;80% (Ritsema et al., 1997) and 86-99% (Tsukamoto and 

Ohta, 1988) of water movement has been attributed to preferential flow.   

Limited overland flow under antecedent dry settings may be also associated with surface 

water retention, favoured by vegetation and litter, as well as micro-topographic 

concavities on hillslopes. Under these conditions, rainfall may stop before surface 

depressions had been filled. The longer concentration time required for continuous flow 

on long hillslopes compared with the duration of the most effective rain showers was 

stated by Yair and Raz-Yassif (2004) as the cause of the low efficiency of runoff 

processes on slopes.  

In wet conditions, particularly in the dense eucalypt plots, it was unclear whether overland 

flow was promoted by hydrophobicity-linked infiltration-excess and/or saturation-excess 

mechanisms. The persistence of subsurface hydrophobicity, in combination with a thin 

hydrophilic soil layer, may prevent downward water flux through the soil matrix (Doerr 

et al., 2000). Any infiltrated water would tend to pond above the hydrophobic layer

leading to surface soil moisture build-up and possible saturation (Doerr et al., 2000; 

Calvo-Cases et al., 2003). Under these conditions, ponded water in the surface saturated 

layer may be diverted laterally as subsurface lateral flow unless encountering a vertical 

preferential flow path, allowing it to reach soil at greater depth and perhaps enter the 

underlying rock.  

During the wettest conditions, overland flow appears to be generated by saturation-excess 

in the sparse eucalypt and, particularly, oak woodland types, as the soils were hydrophilic 

rather than hydrophobic. In the sparse eucalypt stand, generation of saturation-excess 

overland flow may also have been favoured by greater bulk density and clay content of 

its soil (Table 4.1), and its steeper slopes (26-28º), as found elsewhere by Neris et al. 

(2013). Saturation overland flow was greatest in large rainfall events, when water 

detention by the surface micro-topography is exceeded leading to a greater downhill flux 

connectivity to develop (Yang et al., 2012). Surface topography may also enhance 

overland flow connectivity via local rills. Thus it was observed that during this study, a 

rill developed on plot SE3 creating a preferential surface path for overland flow, which 

may account for the significantly greater overland flow in that plot compared with in plots 

SE1 and SE2 (see section 4.4.3.4). 

In the oak woodland, generation of saturation overland flow may have been favoured by 

the loamier and also shallower soil than in the eucalypt plantations (Table 4.1). These will 

enhanced ponding and lead to subsurface lateral flow, which was observed while digging 

the holes for the overland flow tanks at the O2 and O3 oak plots. Previous researchers 

have also remarked on the contribution of lateral subsurface flow in lower hillslope 

positions in view of the high soil moisture content after rainfall (Gautam et al., 2000; 

Ridolfi et al., 2003; Güntner and Bronstert, 2004). According to Lorz et al. (2007), 

subsurface water flow paths prevail where there is a uniform forest cover. The lack of 

water ponding where the pit for the collecting tank for plot O1 was excavated, may 

indicate deeper subsurface lateral flow associated with locally deeper soil, since this plot 

was installed a few metres downslope and at some lateral distance from the other plots. 

The impact of spatially heterogeneous distributions of soil thickness on rainfall–runoff 

processes was also reported elsewhere (e.g. Maeda et al., 2006).   

Nevertheless, based on minor overland flow events during the study, the dominance of 

infiltration and/or subsurface lateral flow is evident. Even with high soil moisture content, 

plots showed an elevated permeability on limestone soil. Owing to high soil permeability, 

no seasonal variation was identified in overland flow measured on plot O1. However, 

since overland flow generated on plots O2 and O3 was affected by subsurface soil 

saturation and lateral flow, temporal differences were identified. The oak woodland 

results accord with the high infiltration capacities of limestone soils under Mediterranean 

climate reported in previous studies (Cerdà, 1997; Calvo-Cases et al., 2003). 

Lower overland flow in oak compared with eucalypt sites could be also favoured by lower 

slope gradients (Table 4.1), despite no significant correlation being observed. A lower

slope angle on plot O1 may have led to minor overland flow than the other runoff plots 

installed under oak stand (cumulative overland flow over the study period was 1.9 mm, 

4.3 mm and 3.2 mm for plots O1, O2 and O3, respectivelly). On steep slopes, overland 

flow tend to increase due to the shorter residence time for water on the soil and reduced 

effectiveness of surface roughness in retaining water (Ferreira et al., 2012; Neris et al., 

2013). This can be particularly important throughout, or immediately after, large rainfall 

events, when surface microtopography exceeds water retention capacity, leading to 

increase downhill flux connectivity (e.g. Yang et al., 2012). Topography has been 

considered the controlling factor on lateral flow only in wet conditions (Lv et al., 2013; 

Ridolfi et al., 2003). 

Forest management activities can also affect overland flow generation. Under dense 

eucalypt plantation, plot DE1 had its highest runoff coefficient immediately after clear-

felling. Such increases in overland flow and stream peakflows after logging have been 

widely reported elsewhere, where they have been linked to reduced infiltration capacities 

due to ground disturbance and soil compaction (Ferreira et al., 2000; Eisenbies et al., 

2007; Robinson et al., 2003). In south-central Japan, partial plot thinning (43%) of a 

Japanese cypress forest led to an increase in runoff coefficient from 33 to 56% (Dung et 

al., 2012). At the catchment scale, Calder (1993) calculated a runoff increase of 3.3 mm 

for each percent of an area deforested, based on a world-wide database of hydrologic 

studies. Based on 94 experimental catchments throughout the world, Bosh and Hewlett 

(1982) estimated that partial tree thinning (by 20%) led to changes in annual streamflow 

increase lower than 10% in hardwoods and than 20% in scrub areas. Nonetheless, some 

studies have pointed out that such changes in catchment discharge are unlikely to be 

detected if the area affected constitutes less than 20-30% of the total forest cover (Scherer 

and Pike, 2003; Bathurst et al., 2011).  

In Ribeira dos Covões, the fact that overland flow after clear-felling was not higher than 

2.3% may be due to the thick ground cover of leaves, bark and small branches left in the 

harvested plot DE1, which would have enhanced water retention capacity and minimized 

any reduction in infiltration capacity due to splash effects. The enhancement of overland 

flow in DE1 was quickly reduced, first because of low rainfall in spring and summer and 

secondly with rapid regeneration of vegetation after September 2012, in response to the 

onset of the rainy late autumn-winter season. The timing of clear-felling may be a 

determining factor in overland flow impact, since felling performed during spring allows 

vegetation to regenerate before autumn rains, minimizing overland flow impacts, 

compared with late summer or autumn felling. 

In oak woodland, canopy cover reduction in plot O3 (between periods 48 and 49) did not 

affect overland flow generation, which indicates the minor influence of vegetation on 

overland flow under wet conditions. Nevertheless, the removal of much of the canopy 

near the upper plot boundary, although not leading to increased overland flow,  resulted 

in much water being retained in surface depressions and not reaching the plot outlet.

4.5.2. Potential implications for catchment streamflow  

The low overland flow recorded in Ribeira dos Covões over 2-year period supports the 

widespread notion of high soil permeability associated with forest vegetation. 

Nevertheless, different woodland types have distinct effects on overland flow amount and 

on its temporal pattern. Dense eucalypt plantations are less suitable as a tree cover to 

encourage infiltration than sparse eucalypt and oak stands, as a result of great severity 

and resistance of soil hydrophobicity. However, the minor overland flow generated even 

under extreme soil hydrophobicity highlights the dominance of vertical water fluxes, 

favoured by preferential flow pathways. In oak woodland, and to a lesser extent in the 

sparse eucalypt stand, overland flow is mostly produced in prolonged rainfall events 

during wet weather conditions.  

Based on Ribeira dos Covões results, it is arguable that dense eucalypt plantations would 

be most likely to contribute to flash floods during extreme storms that occur immediately 

after the summer, due to infiltration-excess overland flow favoured by greater severity 

and spatial cover of hydrophobicity. On the other hand, sparse eucalypt stands and 

particularly oak woodland, would contribute to large-scale floods mostly in wettest 

conditions, since overland flow in those forest types is typically produced by saturation-

excess mechanisms. Nevertheless, even under saturated conditions, water interaction with 

the canopies, litter layers and enhanced surface roughness of woodland and forest areas 

may delay overland flow, slowing its transport down a hillslope thus lengthening the lag 

time and reducing the peak discharge in the stream network (Eisenbies et al., 2007; 

Hewlett, 1982). 

On 25th October 2006, a rainfall event at Coimbra-Bencanta of 102 mm after a long dry 

summer, led to a flash flood in Ribeira dos Covões catchment. According to Brandão et 

al. (2001), rainfall events of 94 mm day-1 and 112 mm day-1 at Coimbra have return 

periods of 10- and 50-years, respectively. Although the contribution from woodland areas 

to this flood is unknown, based on overland flow measurements performed under local 

woodland, dense eucalypt plantations could have some contribution to this flood, whereas 

sparse eucalypt and oak sites could provide upstream overland flow sinks.  

Nevertheless, the overland flow measurements undertaken in this study were conducted 

at a plot scale. It is known, however, that overland flow responses tend to diminish with 

increasing contributing area (van de Giesen et al., 2000; van de Giesen et al., 2005; 

Ferreira et al., 2011; Chamizo et al., 2012). For example, van de Giesen et al. (2005) 

recorded a decrease of 40–75% in overland flow from short (1.25 m) to long plots (12 m).  

On the other hand, Mounirou et al. (2012) reported similar runoff amounts from 50 and 

150 m2 plots, though both were significantly lower than the smallest plot (1 m2) used. 

Cerdan et al. (2004), in turn, observed a strong decrease in mean runoff coefficients with 

increasing area in studies performed at larger scales: three times lower for 90 ha than 450 

m2, and ten times for 1100 ha than 90 ha. In an experimental study, Chamizo et al. (2012) 

found an optimal plot length of 20 m to determine runoff representative of a catchment.

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  

 

107 

Decreasing overland flow with increasing slope length is usually explained with greater 

opportunity for water infiltration on long than on short slopes (van de Giesen et al., 2005). 

It has also been attributed to increased soil heterogeneity within larger area, in terms of 

greater spatial variability in soil infiltration capacity (Cerdan et al., 2004; Mounirou et 

al., 2012), wettable patches and macropores, which can act as sinks for water (Calvo-

Cases et al., 2003; Güntner and Bronstert, 2004; Nasta et al., 2009), as well as the 

temporal dynamics of the rainfall–runoff events (van de Giesen et al., 2005). These spots 

with enhancing infiltration capacity can provide important overland flow sinks, breaking 

flow connectivity (Calvo-Cases et al., 2003; Güntner and Bronstert, 2004; Nasta et al., 

2009). In addition, the relatively little overland flow tends to be trapped by vegetation 

and litter and retained in microtopographic concavities on the hillslope. However, flow 

connectivity may be enhanced by rill development, as observed in plot SE2.  

Nevertheless, some authors have argued that spatial variability only has a scale-related 

effect on total runoff during relatively short rainfall events (van de Giesen et al., 2005; 

Mounirou et al., 2012). In Ribeira dos Covões, considering the discontinuous pattern of 

the rainfall and the small amounts of overland flow generated under woodland land-use, 

the generation of sufficiently continuous overland flow able to reach valley floors and 

channels would be rare, particularly under dry conditions. This was particularly obvious 

at the sparse eucalypt site, where overland flow under dry conditions was mostly 

generated by lower rainfall events. Under these conditions, rainfall stopped before surface 

depressions had been filled. Thus, much overland flow generated on upper slopes is 

retained and/or infiltrated somewhere downslope, thus never reaches the channel. The 

longer concentration time required for continuous flow on long hillslopes compared with 

the duration of most effective rain showers was also stated by Yair and Raz-Yassif (2004) 

as the cause for the low efficiency of runoff processes on slopes. Nevertheless, with 

continuous rainfall, surface depressions may eventually reach saturation, leading to a 

continuous flow transferred downslope. Under these conditions, field measurements 

showed larger overland flow amounts (particularly in late winter and spring seasons of 

2013). However, stone walls, even when small as in this study, present barriers to 

overland flow delivery, limiting significantly the amount of overland flow reaching the 

valley floor.  

Previous studies also have been reporting that slopes behave as a mosaic of runoff 

generation and run-on patches, whose size depends on slope morphometric 

characteristics, lithology, differences in soil thicknesses and climate (Calvo-Cases et al., 

2003; Ridolfi et al., 2003; Güntner and Bronstert, 2004; Komatsu et al., 2011; Lorz et al., 

2007). These variables control the hydrological discontinuity between different parts of 

the same slope and between slopes, channel network and catchment outlet. The scale 

effect is of the utmost importance in this process due to the size of the contributing area 

and the number of opportunities for water infiltration and retention (Merz and Bárdossy, 

1998; Güntner and Bronstert, 2004). 



CHAPTER 4 – DIFFERENCES IN OVERLAND FLOW DYNAMICS IN DIFFERENT TYPES 

OF WOODLAND AREAS WITHIN A PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT  

 

108 

Vegetation intercepts and detains water within the canopy delaying or preventing some 

of it from reaching the ground. Vegetation, and particularly trees, can mitigate peak flow 

by maintaining soil moisture deficit through evapotranspiration over days or weeks, 

thereby resulting in increased potential for soil storage and infiltration capacity during 

frequent, relatively low intensity storms (Eisenbies et al., 2007). Although the minor 

overland flow measured in the woodland areas of Ribeira dos Covões catchment supports 

the protective role of forest land-use during storm events, the highest daily rainfall in the 

monitoring period was only 48 mm, which does not exceed a 2-year return period 

(Brandão et al., 2001). Overland flow responses in more extreme events can only be 

surmised. It is clearly possible that in such extreme events overland flow from woodland 

areas will be much greater and will also more readily be transferred to downslope areas, 

since interception by vegetation and surface water retention capacities provided by litter 

and micro-topographic concavities will be exceeded. Thus, some studies have 

emphasized the limited storage capacity of forested terrain during larger storms and its 

minor role in flood protection (Bathurst et al., 2011; Eisenbies et al., 2007). Nevertheless, 

even under saturated conditions, forest floor roughness represents a barrier for overland 

flow passage.       

The role of woodland type on flood events, however, clearly needs further investigation. 

Additional monitoring in Ribeira dos Covões would need to be carried out in order to 

monitor larger storm events and improve understanding of the role of woodland on 

overland flow under these conditions. Furthermore, the impact of woodland types on 

overland flow should also be performed at a larger scale, in order to understand its 

influence on catchment scale. In Ribeira dos Covões, streamflow measurements have 

been carried to assess the role of woodland areas at the sub-catchment scale. This 

information would be particularly important for mixed land-use catchments.   

Woodland is the dominant land-use in Ribeira dos Covões catchment, followed by urban 

surfaces, which in some places interrupts woodland patches. Urbanization in recent years 

seems to have promoted increased catchment discharge, which is expected to continue in 

view of the character of future urban development already approved (Ferreira et al., 

2013). Considering the small amount of overland flow generated in local woodland, this 

land-use can provide potential overland flow sinks for such flow emanating from upslope 

impermeable urban areas. A discontinuous pattern of urban and woodland land-uses can 

interrupt flow connectivity over the landscape and minimize the detrimental hydrological 

impacts of urbanization (Ferreira et al., 2015). Nevertheless, the infiltration of urban 

surface runoff through preferential flow routes, particularly under woodland areas, 

especially under dry settings when soil hydrophobicity is widespread, may represent a 

problem for groundwater contamination (Selker et al., 1996; Pitt et al., 1999).  

Furthermore, forestry management activities can also play an important role on overland 

flow and influence the role of woodland areas on flood protection. Timber harvesting may 

enhance overland flow due to the higher throughfall, decreased evapotranspiration and 

lower resistance to water run-on promoted by vegetation removal, and soil compaction

109 

caused by heavy machinery (Scherer and Pike, 2003). Nevertheless, results from Ribeira 

dos Covões showed no significant change in overland flow with total or partial plot 

harvesting (ED1 and O3), but increased overland flow coefficients were attained 

immediately after harvesting. This was attributed to the retention of logging slash on the 

soil, which can enhance surface detention. The importance of logging slash in harvested 

areas for interception has also been noted by other researchers (e.g. Shakesby et al., 2013; 

Robinson et al., 2003; Prats, 2013). Small areas covered would generate little overland 

flow, particularly if harvesting is carried out on upper hillslopes. On the other hand, large 

clear-felled areas would provide high quantities of overland flow that might reach the 

channel. Chang (2003) reported that small canopy openings on upper slopes can cause a 

smaller impact on water yield than when they occur on lower slopes. Some studies, 

however, have pointed out that changes in catchment discharge are unlikely to be detected 

if the area affected is&amp;lt;20-30% of the total forest cover (Scherer and Pike, 2003: Bathurst 

et al., 2011). In a review by Eisenbies et al. (2007), studies are cited where a harvesting 

impact on stormflow was only significant at relatively low volumes (0.1-1 mm) and others 

where no differences were observed for stormflows &gt;10 mm. Calder et al. (1992) 

calculated a runoff increase of 3.3 mm for each percent of area deforested, based on a 

world-wide database of hydrologic studies.  

Despite the impact of harvesting on overland flow was not an original objective of this 

study, the results from plots DE1 and O3 suggest that the impact of clear-felling on 

overland flow depends on its timing. Harvesting performed during spring and summer 

allows vegetation to regenerate before autumn rains, minimizing overland flow impacts, 

compared with autumn harvesting, given the size and frequency of rainfall events. 

In Ribeira dos Covões, woodland is the most dominant land-use, followed by urban areas, 

some of them located upslope. Urbanization in recent years seems to have promoted 

increased catchment discharge, and this is expected to continue in future taking into 

account the character of urban development already approved (Ferreira et al., 2013). 

Considering the greater overland flow generated in urban areas (e.g. Mulliss et al., 1996; 

Konrad and Booth, 2002; Huang et al., 2008) and the high infiltration capacities of 

woodland, this land-use may provide sinks for overland flow generated in comparatively 

impermeable urban areas. The flow disconnectivity provided by a mosaic of different 

land-uses may minimize the detrimental hydrological impacts of urbanization (Ferreira et 

al., 2012d) and enhance the safety of the resident population downslope of woodland 

areas, at least during small and average storm events.  

Despite woodland capacity to generate limited overland flow and to provide potential 

overland flow sinks from upslope land-uses, it is also prone to contribute into catchment 

streamflow. Through dry settings, widespread hydrophobicity, particularly dense 

eucalypt areas due to great severity and resistance of switching to hydrophilic properties, 

has led to increased overland flow and could contribute to flash floods. In wet weather 

conditions, long-lasting rainfall events during saturated soil conditions, particularly in 



CHAPTER 4 – DIFFERENCES IN OVERLAND FLOW DYNAMICS IN DIFFERENT TYPES 

OF WOODLAND AREAS WITHIN A PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT  

 

110 

oak woodland areas, enhance overland flow and can contribute to large-scale floods. 

Anyway, woodland areas may slow down overland flow due to great surface roughness 

and thus lengthen the lag time and reduce peak discharge in stream network. Usually 

woodland and forest streams have a delayed response time because of water interactions 

with the canopy, litter layer and increased surface roughness, in addition to any influence 

of soils and topography (Hewlett, 1982; Eisenbies et al., 2007).  

The importance of sustainable management of forest areas in retaining and reducing 

overland flow may be important to protect downslope urban areas. The understanding of 

seasonal variability of overland flow and its spatial distribution as a result of soil 

properties, topographic position and geographic location in catchment, in particular 

within wooded areas, is of the utmost importance to identify landscape sinks and sources. 

This information is crucial for integrated planning and management of catchments 

undergoing urban development, to minimize hydrologic impacts. Further investigation 

should be carried out in order to improve understanding of the appropriate sizes and 

locations of woodland areas within peri-urban catchments, in order to minimize the 

hydrologic impacts of urbanization and protect downslope urban cores from flood hazard.  

 

4.6. Conclusions 

In the urbanizing catchment of Ribeira dos Covões in central Portugal, permeable 

woodland soils on sandstone and limestone produced overland flow representing less than 

3% of the incident rainfall, based on measurements performed on small (16 m2) plots over 

2 years of monitoring. A dense eucalypt stand generated significantly higher overland 

flow than either sparse eucalypt or oak woodlands, which differed only slightly. Although 

the underlying bedrock can also influence hydrological processes, woodland type appears 

to be far more important, given the differences in soil hydrological properties and 

overland flow generation recorded on dense and sparse eucalypt stands, as they are both 

located on sandstone.  

In dry conditions, hydrophobicity-linked infiltration-excess overland flow was the 

dominant means of downslope water movement. This process was particularly important 

in dense eucalypt plantations, where hydrophobicity was more extreme, spatially 

contiguous and resistant to breakdown with rainfall than was the case in the other two 

woodland types. Under hydrophobic conditions, overland flow strongly increased with 

rainfall amount and intensity, but overland flow coefficient did not exceed 2.2%. In 

contrast, in the sparse eucalypt plots, moderate hydrophobicity was easily broken down, 

and percentage overland flow was greatest in smaller rainfall events (overland flow 

coefficient&amp;lt;0.5%), when the soil was not rendered wettable. The weak hydrophobic 

properties observed in oak woodland plots led to a maximum overland flow coefficient 

of 0.4% in storms following dry antecedent weather.

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS  

 

111 

In periods of wet weather, saturation overland flow occurred most readily in oak 

woodland followed by sparse eucalypt stands. Relatively high soil moisture contents 

maintained throughout wet periods enhanced overland flow by saturation, so that runoff 

coefficients reached 1.2% and 2.2% on the sparse eucalypt and oak woodland plots, 

respectively. On the latter, saturation was favoured by the shallow soil overlying 

limestone, its loamy texture and subsurface lateral flow, whereas in sparse eucalypt stand, 

saturation was favoured by the high bulk density and clayey nature of the soil. In both 

woodland types, overland flow strongly increased with rainfall amount and soil moisture. 

In the dense eucalypt plantation, overland flow did not exceed 1.0% of the rainfall in wet 

weather.  

Interception by the different tree canopies was not significantly different. It is thought to 

have been important in reducing overland flow responses only during small rainfall events 

following antecedent dry weather, as interception was low in percentage terms during 

large events and wet periods due to canopy saturation. In addition, surface roughness, 

associated with the litter layer promoted water retention and decreased lateral flow 

connectivity.   

Important implications of this study for managing peri-urban catchments are that patches 

of semi-natural and managed woodland are critical in order to retain rainfall, promote 

infiltration and act as sinks for overland flow from upslope. In urbanized catchments, the 

lack of rainfall interception and the size, and often contiguity, of areas covered by 

impermeable surfaces tend to promote rapid overland flow and the possibility of flooding. 

Authorities concerned with catchment management and urban planning, therefore, should 

try to incorporate such patches in any development proposal in order to reduce the total 

runoff-generating area and provide sinks for runoff generated on impermeable urban 

surfaces upslope. Thus, the most satisfactory compromise is likely to be a mosaic of 

diverse land-uses designed to disrupt overland flow connectivity. Identifying the best 

arrangement of such patches while maximizing the use of land for urban development 

should now be a research priority. A second research need is for field data on overland 

flow responses within this mosaic in more extreme, potentially flood-producing 

rainstorms than occurred within the 2-year monitoring period of this study.

ABSTRACT 

 

Population growth and improved living standards are leading to patchy urban sprawl 

and land-use change in peri-urban catchments. In order to understand better the impacts 

on peak flows and in the response and recession times of the storm hydrograph, a 

monitoring network was installed in a small peri-urban catchment (620 ha) located in 

Coimbra, central Portugal. The network comprised five rainfall gauges and eight water 

level recorders, in order to provide information on the hydrological response to 

rainstorms of catchments and sub-catchments of different size and urban patterns 

(extension, impervious surface cover, distance to the stream network and water 

management strategies), overlying either sandstone or limestone areas. The results 

showed both the importance of weather, season and lithology on catchment 

hydrological response and the increase of runoff coefficients with percentage urban 

area. However, urban areas located closer to the stream network showed higher 

contributions to the streamflow due to lower water infiltration opportunities. This 

included greater peak flows and lower response times, especially where the storm 

drainage system diverts the overland flow from impervious areas directly to the stream 

or nearby soils. However, some urban features (e.g. houses and walls constructed in 

valley bottoms) may provide surface water retention, breaking the connectivity 

between hillslope urban surfaces and the stream network. In contrast, continuous 

urbanization enhances overland flow and streamflow peaks, though may be reduced 

through adopting particular land-use pattern and urbanization style, in order to enhance 

water infiltration opportunities. Hydrological monitoring of peri-urban areas can 

provide crucial information to develop planning strategies that improve the 

hydrological sustainability of urban areas and minimize the flood hazard.

PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE

5.1. Introduction 

The proportion of urban residents across the globe increased from 29% to 47% between 

1950 and 2000, and are forecasted to reach 56% by 2020 (UNESCO, 2006) and 70% by 

2050 (UNPD, 2008). In Europe, urban population attained 75% in 2006, and is expected 

to increase to 80% by 2020 (EEA, 2006). Nevertheless, the lower living costs, easy 

mobility/transport and the demand for improved quality of life, have been leading people 

to move outside the city to peri-urban areas (Ravetz et al., 2013). It has been been argued 

that peri-urban areas, comprising a mixture of natural forest or agricultural lands and 

urbanized areas, usually with less than 20000 inhabitants, with an average density of at 

least 40 persons per km2, may become the dominant urban form of the twenty-first century 

(Braud et al., 2013; Ravetz et al., 2013).  

Urbanization involves radical changes to the environment, including hydrological 

processes. These impacts have been studied through statistical analysis of long data 

records, monitoring of paired catchments (similar catchments with different land-uses) 

and by predicting changes through modelling. Results report decreased 

evapotranspiration and infiltration, as well as increased runoff (e.g. Kundzewicz, 2008; 

Ying et al., 2009; Kalantari et al., 2014). These lead to hydrograph shape changes, linked 

to greater peak discharge (e.g. Semadeni-Davies et al., 2008), reduced time of 

concentration and recession period (Graf, 1977; Baker et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2008) 

and lower baseflow (e.g. Simmons and Reynolds, 1982; Konrad and Booth, 2005; 

Wheater and Evans, 2009). These lead to increased magnitude and frequency of floods 

(Moscrip and Montgomery, 1997; Burns et al. 2005; Haase, 2009) and shorten recurrence 

intervals on urban streamflow (e.g. Hollis, 1975; Chen et al., 2009). However, the size of 

hydrological impacts is not clearly related to the percentage impervious surface. The 

existence of a threshold level of urbanization above which hydrological changes are 

noticed is not consensual. Some studies have been reporting urbanization influences on 

streamflow regime above 3-5% impervious surface (Yang et al., 2011), while others 

identified a minimum of 20% (Brun and Band, 2000).  

The nature of hydrological changes varies greatly with the biophysical characteristics of 

the catchment, such as geology, lithology, climate and soil properties, as well as 

anthropogenic activities, which affect land-use change history and the percentage and 

distribution of impervious area (e.g. Boyd et al., 2003; Konrad and Booth, 2005; 

WMO/GWP, 2008). Each landscape contains different combinations and arrangements 

(distribution and size) of pervious and impervious surfaces (buildings, roads and other 

paved areas), which affect the amount of runoff produced and the speed at which it is 

delivered to other parts of the catchment (Parikh et al., 2005; Jacobson, 2011).  

Since 1960, many studies have focussed on urban hydrology, but few have studied peri-

urban areas, particularly under Mediterranean climate. Although studies performed on 

peri-urban areas confirm many of the accepted theories regarding to urbanization impact

on hydrological regime, they highlight the complexity involved in isolating land-use 

change impacts in a real catchment with diverse land-uses and hydrological pathways 

(Perrin et al., 2001; Braud et al., 2013). The complexity of spatial pattern within peri-

urban areas, the irregular rainfall regime of Mediterranean climate and the combination 

of artificial and natural flow pathways represent additional challenges to urban hydrology 

(Miller et al., 2014). Thus, it is important to understand the impact of different 

urbanization patterns on runoff and flow connectivity.  

This chapter aims to assess the impact of a Portuguese peri-urban area on catchment 

hydrology. The specific objectives are to: 1) assess the streamflow response of a 

catchment undergoing urbanization process; 2) investigate the seasonal influence of the 

Mediterranean climate on catchment discharge; 3) quantify the streamflow delivery from 

different contributing areas, characterized by different land-use arrangements and their 

contribution to catchment hydrology; 4) explore the role of different urbanization styles 

on flow connectivity and stream discharge. Knowledge of the influence of different urban 

mosaics on peri-urban catchment hydrology is important to landscape managers and 

should guide urban planning in order to restrict flow connectivity and reduce flood 

hazard. 

 

5.2. Study Area 

The study focuses on Ribeira dos Covões, a small catchment (6 km2) located nearly 2 km 

away from the Coimbra city centre, one of the main cities in central Portugal (Figure 5.1). 

The catchment is somewhat elongated in shape, draining S-N into the large floodplain of 

the Mondego river.

The area has a Mediterranean sub-humid climate, with an annual average temperature of 

15°C, an average annual rainfall of 892 mm of rainfall and a strong contrast between dry 

summer and winter conditions. The catchment experiences a progressive wet-up period 

from about October to December and thereafter maintains very moist conditions until late 

spring. It is a well-drained catchment (drainage density of 3.1 km km-2), supplied by a 

dendritic pattern with a perennial 3rd order stream (Strahler, 1957) and ephemeral 

tributaries (Figure 5.2a).

From the geological point of view, the study site is located in the Orla Meso-Cenozóica 

Ocidental, characterized by sandstone and limestone hills and broad shallow valleys with 

abundant alluvium. Orla is characterized by important aquifer systems, related to the 

detrital and carbonate formations. The sequential organization of sedimentary rock loads 

to multi-layer aquifer systems, usually of karstic and porous nature. Generally, karstic 

aquifers have limited auto-regulation capacity, evidenced by large variations in flow rate 

of the important springs between the rainy and dry seasons (Almeida et al., 1999). The 

Ribeira dos Covões catchment is characterized by contrasting geology, marked by areas 

of 1) sandstone, mostly represented by sand and gravel conglomerate and deposits from 

Paleogene/Neogene, with variable depth but not exceeding 25 m;  2) limestone formations 

on the east side, represented by limestone and marl units from Cretaceous, with mean soil 

depth of 7-8 m, and dolomitic and marl limestone of the Jurassic, which soil depth mostly 

ranges between 0.1 m and 0.4 m; and 3) alluvial deposits of the Quaternary age, whose 

depth may reach 5 m (Pato, 2007). The lithological units are interrupted by some 

geological faults (Figure 4.2b). Soils are mainly represented by Cambisols (medium and 

fine-textured materials) and Podzols (derived from sandstone rock).  

Topography of Ribeira dos Covões catchment ranges from 30 m to 205 m (Figure 5.2a). 

Slopes average is 11º, but steep slopes (from 17-31º) represent 10% of the area, and 

hillslope gradient reaches 36º in few locations.  

The catchment went through major land-use changes and an increasing urbanization 

process for the last half century as a result of the proximity to Coimbra city center. People 

living in Coimbra municipality increased 150%, from 98027 in 1950 to 143396 in 2011, 

while in Antanhol, São Martinho and Santa Clara parishes, where Ribeira dos Covões is 

located, population doubled, from 14315 to 26632 inhabitants (INE, 1950; INE, 2011). 

The study catchment covers 16% of the mentioned parishes area, but based on aerial 

photographs and urban cores location, it is estimated that people in the study site increased 

from 2500 to 7200 inhabitants. This led to the conversion of a rural area with few 

dispersed urban cores (before 1958) to a discontinuous urban fabric. In 1993, a new 

Master Plan considered the study catchment as part of the Coimbra urban area, 

encouraged continuous urbanization and triggered a new urban consolidation phase 

(Tavares et al., 2012).  

Between 1958 and 2007, land-use changes in Ribeira dos Covões involved the conversion 

of agricultural fields (from 48% to 4%) to urban (from 8% to 32%) and forest areas (from 

44 to 64%) (Figure 5.3). After 2007, some deforestation occurred to build a major road, 

an enterprise park and to expand some existing urban cores. These changes led to urban 

areas covering 40% of the catchment in 2012. This urbanization trend is expected to 

continue, based on urban projects already approved.

Figure 5.3 - Variation of land-use cover between 1958 and 2012 (the largest open space in 1995 

was a result of forest fire). 

 

Urbanization has involved large areas of paved surfaces interrupting woodland and often 

semi-abandoned agricultural terrain. Urban settings vary from older discontinuous 

buildings and structures (&lt;25 inhabitants km-2), comprising mostly detached houses 

surrounded by gardens and delimited by walls, but also recent well-defined urban cores, 

comprising apartment block (9900 inhabitants km-2) (Tavares et al., 2012). The area also 

contains educational and health facilities, including a central hospital and some small 

industrial facilities. Much of the urban area is located in the valleys but also in upslope 

sites, mostly along ridges including the catchment boundary (Figure 5.4). 

Within the urban areas, separate drainage systems transport domestic waste water into a 

treatment plant located outside the catchment, whereas the stormwater (including from 

roofs, streets and concrete paved area) generated in the most recent urban cores is piped 

to the main river and/or its tributaries. Where urban infrastructures and derelict urban land 

are surrounded by agriculture fields, however, stormwater just dissipates in these areas.

5.3. Methodology 

5.3.1. Research design 

The hydrological response of the Ribeira dos Covões catchment was assessed via a 

monitoring network. In late 2005, a weir was constructed at the catchment outlet (ESAC) 

to measure stream discharge. This involves a 90º V-notch weir for the lower flows and a 

concrete rectangular section for greater discharges. Water level in the pool behind the 

weir has been continuously recorded using a float-operated Thalimedes Shaft Encoder 

(OTT Hydromet) with integral data logger. However, several construction problems only 

allowed reliable water level data collection from October 2008 onwards.  

Daily climatic data, including rainfall, temperature, wind and solar radiation were 

provided by the Coimbra/Bencanta weather station, integrated in the national 

meteorological network (12G/02UG, from IPMA), located 0.5 km north of the study area. 

Although spatial variation of rainfall was later found to be minor, three raingauges were 

installed across the study catchment in February 2008. These tipping-bucket raingauges 

(Rain-O-Matic from Pronamic, 0.2 mm resolution) were connected to a continuous 

recording data logger (Onset HOBO).  

In October 2010, the hydrological network was extended by installing eight additional 

water-level recorders (Odyssey, ~0.8 mm resolution), to provide sub-catchments 

discharge data (Figure 5.5). Sites took into account land-use and lithology, local 

suitability and accessibility. The purpose and characteristics of each sub-catchment were 

as follows: 

? Espírito Santo measures the streamflow response of a highly urbanized sub-
catchment overlying sandstone; it was installed in an asymmetrical section, 

delimited by a cement wall and an irregular compacted soil slope. 
 

? Quinta provides data for a large sandstone area, mostly dominated by forestry; it 
was settled in a natural channel of rectangular shape. 
 

? Iparque was sited at the outlet of the detention basin constructed downstream of 
the enterprise park area.  
 

? Covões drains an area of sandstone and limestone, mostly dominated by forest but 
with downslope urban cores; the monitored channel cross-section comprises a 

straight cement wall on one side and an irregular herbaceous slope on the other. 
 

? Ribeiro da Póvoa provides discharge data from most of the sandstone part of the 
catchment; it was installed in a current concrete rectangular section; 
 

? Mina provides discharge data from an ephemeral watercourse overlying limestone 
that also receives stormflow from a section of the recent constructed major road; 

it was installed in an existing concrete trapezoidal channel.

? Porto Bordalo measures the discharge of three ephemeral streams on limestone 
(including Mina sub-catchment); it was sited in a current concrete trapezoidal 

channel. 
 

? Drabl provides discharge data from an extensive limestone area (including Porto 
Bordalo and Mina sub-catchments), with a large urban cover downslope; it was 

installed in an existing stone trapezoidal channel.

Vandalism (equipment damage and theft) restricted data acquisition, particularly at the 

Iparque and Mina gauging stations. Destruction of raingauges led to the installation (in 

different sites) of three additional double tipping-bucket raingauges (Davis Tipping-

bucket Rain Collector, coupled to Odyssey rain gauge loggers, 0.2mm resolution) in 

January 2011, and two more in June 2011.   

Equipment maintenance was carried out at least every 3 months. Manual measurements 

of streamflow were made to calibrate and validate equipment results. In each gauging 

station, water height was measured manually with a ruler, whereas flow velocity was 

measured with a float and a chronometer for low flows (&lt;7 L s-1), or with an ultrasonic 

transit time flow meter (Vórtice) for greater discharges, following Bedient and Huber 

method (1987).

5.3.2. Characterization of drainage area 

A detailed analysis of sub-catchments area was accomplished using cartographic 

information, aerial photographs and field visits. Characterization included drainage area, 

slope gradient, soil type, land-use and percentage impervious surface. Slope gradient was 

derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) with 5 m × 5 m pixel size, prepared using 

contour and elevation points (supplied by Instituto Geográfico Português - IGP). The 

DEM was processed to fill null cells, to calculate flow directions and delimit drainage 

areas of all the gauging stations, based on Spatial Analyst Tools available on ArcGIS 10 

software. 

Land-use data from 2007 were available from Corine Land Cover (5 m × 5 m resolution), 

and cartographic information as regards to impermeable surfaces was provided by IGP. 

However, since these information was not available for recent years, it was manually 

updated through the analysis of aerial photography using available Google Earth imagery 

(29/07/2009, 20/03/2011 and 13/06/2012) and field observations. Land-use and urban 

feature polygons were drawn for 2009, 2011 and 2012, with Google Earth tools, and 

exported to ArcGIS 10. Detailed information on urban features encompassed: 1) 

impermeable surfaces, including buildings, swimming pools, walls, roads, car parks, 

courtyards, driveways and pavements; 2) semi-permeable surfaces, including paths, 

compacted bare soil linked to parking and construction sites, as well as gardens covered 

by semi-permeable materials such as geotextiles; 3) permeable surfaces, mostly gardens; 

and 4) water detention basins, comprising structural flood measures but also sites where 

runoff is retained due to walls and roads embankments. The percentages of impermeable, 

semi-permeable and permeable surfaces in each catchment were calculated by dividing 

the area of such features by the respective catchment area. Description of the storm 

drainage system within the study site was not provided in time by the responsible 

institution, so it was based on observation during field visits. 

 

5.3.3. Data analysis 

Catchment hydrological response was analysed over five hydrological years (October 1 

to September 30) (Palutikof et al., 1996), from 2008/09 to 2012/13. Analysis of discharge 

from the extended gauging station network was performed for three hydrological years 

2010/11 to 2012/13. 

Until December 2010, rainfall data was provided by the Bencanta/Coimbra national 

meteorological station (12G/02UG), because of vandalism with the installed raingauges. 

After January 2011, rainfall data was provided by the new raingauges installed. Spatial 

differences in rainfall records were investigated through Mann-Whitney U test (p&lt;0.05), 

using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software. Since no significant difference was identified,

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

125 

weighted average rainfall results were assumed uniform for the entire catchment. 

Weighted average rainfall was calculated from the gauges’ area of influence, determined 

by Thiessen Polygons on ArcGIS 10 software. During periods of missing data, due to 

equipment malfunction/failure, weighted average was adjusted considering the available 

rainfall records. Data quality was checked by storage rainfall gauges installed adjacent to 

the recording ones. Long-term rainfall records (INMG, 1971-2000) were used to calculate 

rainfall probability and recurrence periods of rainstorms. Potential evapotranspiration was 

calculated based on Thornthwaite and Mather method (Thornthwaite and Mather, 1955), 

considering the climatic data from the Bencanta/Coimbra station. 

Stage-discharge rating curves for each gauging station were derived from field 

measurements of water level and discharge. The quality of the rating curves was assessed 

through the calculation of the Perarson’s rank correlation, Root Mean Square Error 

(RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (E) between measured and 

calculated flow. Streamflow records, calculated from the rating curves, were manually 

checked, validated, corrected or removed, based on field measurements. Missing daily 

values were replaced by interpolation based on discharge relation between all stations for 

the corresponding month. In order to compare data from drainage areas of different sizes 

and identify possible impact of land-use on the discharge, specific flows (L km-2 s-1) were 

calculated by dividing all the data by the drainage area. These values also enabled runoff 

coefficients to be calculated.  

Baseflow and storm flow components were separated, through the application of a 

mathematical low-pass digital filter developed by Lyne and Hollick (1979), considering 

the improvements suggested by Nathan and McMahon (1990). The constant used in the 

filter was assumed to be 0.925, based on a visual inspection of several data sets which 

indicated that this value of the filter parameter was that yielded the most acceptable. The 

baseflow index (BFI), defined as the ratio between baseflow and total streamflow (Nathan 

and McMahon, 1992), was calculated for all the gauging stations based on daily 

streamflow data.  

Differences in flow magnitude of all the gauging stations were assessed through the 

calculation of annual and monthly runoff coefficients (ratio between total discharge and 

rainfall), as well as individual storm event analysis. A storm event was defined by the 

time interval between the beginning of the rainfall and the stop of storm flow. Rainfall 

events that did not promote a rise in streamflow were not considered for the individual 

storm event analysis. The study was performed for the January 2011 to September 2013 

period, which had time resolution of rainfall data (5-minutes interval), comprising 310 

storm events. For individual storm events several rainfall and hydrograph parameters 

were calculated. The rainfall characteristics considered were the depth, duration and 

intensity - mean hourly intensity and maximum intensities observed in 5 and 15 minutes 

(these maximum values were converted into mm h-1) and 1-hour. The hydrograph 

parameters considered were: 1) storm runoff, 2) peak flow discharge, 3) response time,

126 

defined as the time lag between the centroid of the rainfall and peak flow (Lana-Renault 

et al., 2011), 4) recession time, which corresponds to the time interval between peak flow 

and the time when storm flow cease, and 5) runoff coefficient, defined as the ratio 

between stream runoff and rainfall. Differences in response and recession times between 

different gauging stations were investigated with Kruskal-Wallis test, at 0.05 significance 

level. Antecedent Dry Period (sum of rainfall over a defined period of days) was 

calculated for 7, 14 and 30 days prior to a storm event (API7, API14 and API30). The 

relation between rainfall and hydrograph parameters were analysed through Spearman’s 

rank correlation coefficient (r), in IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software. The relation between 

annual runoff coefficient and the characteristics of the drainage area (area, mean slope, 

urban area extent and impermeable surfaces percentage) were also assessed. For the 

2010/11 hydrological year, urban area and percentage impermeable surfaces were derived 

from the March 2011 aerial photograph, whereas for the 2012/13 and 2013/14 

hydrological years it was based on June 2012 aerial photograph. Between these years, no 

land-use change was observed. 

 

5.4. Results and analysis 

5.4.1. Drainage area characterization 

The gauging stations installed in Ribeira dos Covões have catchment areas ranging from 

15 ha (Iparque) to the full catchment size (620 ha, ESAC). Variations in topography, 

lighology and land-use of the catchments are summarized in Table 5.1. Iparque and Mina 

gauging stations were abandoned due to vandalism problems (theft).

Although all catchments are dominated by forest (Figure 5.6), Espírito Santo and Drabl 

showed the largest urban cover (46-48% and 47-53%) (Figure 5.7). Between 2007 and 

2012, land-use changes were noticed all over the catchment, though only minor changes 

were recorded in Espírito Santo and Covões (2% and 3% increase of the urban areas, 

respectively). Major land-use change was recorded in Iparque sub-catchment (in upslope 

sandstone area), where 97% of the forest area was clear-felled for the enterprise park 

construction. Nevertheless, the majority of this area is still in an initial build-up stage, 

largely covered by compacted bare soil, considered as semipermeable area (Figure 5.7). 

These changes led to an enlargement of the urban area from 6% to 25% in Quinta drainage 

area, although most of it is still compacted bare soil (semipermeable) (Figure 5.7). Under 

limestone land-use changes were mainly associated with the new major road construction 

(Figure 5.8).

Figure 5.8 – Location of the urban impermeable surface in Ribeira dos Covões catchment 

(adapted from IGP, 2007, and Google Earth Imagery, 2012). 

 

Between 2007 and 2012, urban land-use increased from 32% to 40% across Ribeira dos 

Covões catchment, but impermeable surfaces (e.g. paved areas) enlarged from 20% to 

33%, displaying the urban consolidation process undergoing the recent years (Figure 5.8). 

Impermeable surfaces were mostly located in the north part of the catchment. Within 

Ribeiro da Póvoa (56% of the catchment area), in 2007, impermeable surfaces 

represented 43% of its urban drainage area, whereas in 2012 they covered 37% of the 

area. Most of these impermeable surfaces were located downslope, between Ribeiro da 

Póvoa and the upstream gauging stations (38-27%, between 2007 and 2012) and in 

Espírito Santo (56-49%) urban drainage area. Inside Drabl drainage area (25% of the 

catchment), 44-41% of the impermeable surfaces were concentrated in the small 

downslope area, between these and Porto Bordalo gauging stations (39 ha, 26% of the 

Drabl area). This high urban intensity contrasts with the upslope Porto Bordalo drainage 

area, where the impervious surfaces were dispersed across the valley bottom and in the 

upslope W side (Figure 5.8). Nevertheless, the most recent urban cores constructed in 

Porto Bordalo and Drabl drainage areas (limestone) are characterized by townhouses and 

flats (Figure 5.9a and 5.9b), whereas in upslope sandstone areas, the urban areas include 

larger permeable areas, such as gardens (Figure 5.9c and 5.9d). The different urbanization 

styles reflect differences in the extent of permeable and semipermeable surfaces within 

the drainage areas.

Figure 5.9 - Different types of urban areas across Ribeira dos Covões catchment: a) recent urban 

cores with greater population density in NE side, b) townhouses characterized by intensive soil 

sealing in E, and older urban cores with c) lower population density and d) isolated houses. 

 

Across the catchment, management of storm runoff differs with age and location of the 

urban core. In the smaller and dispersed urban nuclei located in upslope areas, storm 

runoff was routed downslope (enhanced by the slope gradient and/or driven by the storm 

drainage system) to forest and/or agricultural soils, at different distances to the stream 

network. Increasing distance to the stream provides more infiltration/retention 

opportunities, leading to generally low runoff coefficients and greater response time to 

rainfall events. On the other hand, urban areas located downslope are characterized by a 

greater intensity of impervious surfaces, with road runoff collected in gutters and quickly 

delivered into downslope watercourses or nearby soils. The stream network represents a 

mix of semi-natural (with soil banks but partially straightened) and channelized sections. 

Open artificial channels contribute the stream for a few metres before Porto Bordalo 

gauging station and for a larger distance immediately after Ribeiro da Póvoa station. The 

stream section between Porto Bordalo and Drabl stations is piped, flowing beneath the 

soil surface. Along the main stream and larger tributaries crossing urban areas, some 

hydraulic infrastructures were built in order to by-pass the storm runoff from roads, for 

example. At the outlet of the enterprise park, under construction area in upslope 

catchment, a detention basin has been created to minimize downstream flood peaks. This 

structure consists of a 3650 m2 basin with three small pipes (Ø= 0.20 m) that allows a 

perennial water flow downstream, but with a peak flow delay during storm events.

5.4.2. Climate during the monitoring period 2008-13 

Climate during the years 2008/09 to 2012/13 showed the typical Mediterranean pattern, 

with hot and dry summers, as well as cool and wet winters (Figure 5.10). During the study 

period, rainfall between June and August represented 2-11% of the annual rainfall, similar 

to the average of 8% (INMG, 1971-2000). There were great differences, however, 

between the very dry 2011/12 (551mm, recurrence period of 17 years) and very wet 

2012/13 (947 mm, 3 years return period) (Figure 5.11). These annual differences were 

also reflected in potential evapotranspiration differences (greater in 2011/12 and lower in 

2012/13), typical of the Mediterranean environments (Figure 5.12). Rainy days varied 

from 89 days in 2008/09 to 200 days in 2012/13 (Table 5.2). Low rainfall intensities of 

&lt;2 mm day-1 were dominant. Maximum daily rainfall ranged from 27 mm in 2008/09 and 

2011/12 to 74 mm in 2009/10. These maximum daily intensities were not associated with 

the greatest hourly intensities, which varied between 10 mm in 2012/13 and 58 mm in 

2009/10, respectively. However, based on the duration and mean hourly rainfall intensity 

of isolated storm events, observed between October 2010 and September 2013, none 

exceeded two years return period.

5.4.3. Catchment hydrology 

5.4.3.1. Rating curves 

The rating curves established for each gauging station were defined by composite 

equations (Figure 5.13), except for Ribeiro da Póvoa. The equations gave good fits to the 

stage-discharge data as measured by Pearsons´ rank correlations and Nash-Sutcliffe 

model efficiency coefficients, which ranges between 0.86-1.00 and 0.77-1.00 (Table 5.3). 

Although many flow measurements (varying from 25 to 68), high flow measurements 

were few.

5.4.3.2.1. Temporal pattern of catchment discharge 

Ribeira dos Covões discharge responded to rainfall through the five studied hydrological 

years, particularly to rainfall amount (r=0.941, p&lt;0.01) (Figure 5.14a). On average, runoff 

rate was 0.4 mm day-1, but mean daily winter values were ten times higher than in summer 

(0.06 and 0.60 mm day-1). The highest recorded peak flow was 738 L s-1 on 16th November 

2009, as a result of the maximum daily rainfall intensity recorded in the study period (74 

mm). In the other studied hydrological years, peak flows were perceived in winter and 

spring seasons (wettest periods) (Figure 5.14a).

Figure 5.14 - Temporal variation of Ribeira dos Covões discharge between 2008/09 and 

2012/13 hydrological years: a) daily hydrograph and b) annual variation. 

 

Annual runoff varied from 14% in the driest year (2011/12) to 22% in the wettest 

(2012/13) hydrological year (Figure 5.14b). Most of the catchment discharge was storm 

flow (61-64%), whereas annual BFI ranged between 36 and 39% (Figure 5.14b). Despite 

annual BFI and rainfall patterns displayed similar tendencies, no significant correlation 

was found between these two variables (p&gt;0.05). In fact, despite a greater annual runoff 

coefficient in 2012/13, BFI was slightly lower than in the previous 3 years (Figure 5.14b).  

The seasonal rainfall pattern was clearly reflected in the river regime (Figure 5.14a), with 

summer flows representing 3-7% of the annual flow. Increasing flow responses to rainfall 

over the wet period are shown by the rise in runoff coefficients from October until 

February (median values of 8% and 27%, respectively) (Figure 5.15a). Through spring, 

monthly runoff coefficients slightly decreased (23% in March to 19% in May) and 

reached minimum median values at the end of the summer (6% in September). 

Nevertheless, this temporal pattern was not always the same as the observed for monthly 

BFI. In fact, baseflow component increased with the rainfall amount, through the wet 

season (r=0.584, p&lt;0.01), but reached highest values in summer (median values of 56 - 

79%). In addition, BFI became stable over the spring (~60%), whereas runoff coefficient 

started to decline (Figure 5.15). The lowest BFI attained 27-18% of the catchment 

discharge, at the end of dry period. Inter-annual variability between monthly runoff 

coefficients were greatest in February, April and August, as a consequence of greater 

rainfall differences (Figure 5.10).

5.4.3.2.2. Contributions from upstream sub-catchments 

At all the gauging stations installed across Ribeira dos Covões catchment discharge 

followed the rainfall pattern (Figure 5.16), with lower values in summer, increasing 

through autumn and reaching higher values in winter and spring. Flows were always 

greater in the wettest 2012/13 hydrological year, whereas lower values were measured in 

the driest 2011/12, except in Covões, which recorded the lowest value in 2010/11 (Figure 

5.16a). In general, flow increased with drainage area (r=0.992, p&lt;0.01) and was correlated 

with hillslope position (total flow depth and altimetry: r=-0.793, p&lt;0.05). Espírito Santo 

and Covões, with the smaller drainage areas (56 ha and 65 ha), presented lower runoffs 

(13-23 mm year-1 and&amp;lt;10 mm year-1, respectively), whereas ESAC, representing the 

catchment outlet, recorded annual runoff of 200 mm.  Nevertheless, Covões’ peak flow 

(attained 91 L s-1), slightly greater than in Quinta (87 L s-1) which drains a larger area 

(150 ha). Ribeiro da Póvoa (outlet of sandstone), with a larger drainage area than Drabl 

(outlet of limestone), showed highest peak flow (257 L s-1 and 214 L s-1). However, 

despite all these peak flows being measured in late winter 2012/13, they were not reached 

at the same time (distinct days in January and March). In ESAC and Porto Bordalo for 

instance, the highest flows were observed in December 2012 (488 L s-1 and 146 L s-1).

Iparque and Covões (note scale differences). 

Although the runoff increased from up to down slope the catchment (Figure 5.17a), storm 

runoff coefficients did not follow this tendency. Storm runoff coefficient was highest in 

Espírito Santo (20-21%) (Figure 5.17b). ESAC and Ribeiro da Póvoa revealed similar 

storm runoff coefficients (9-13% and 9-12%, respectively), slightly lower than Drabl (13-

18%). The lowest storm runoff coefficients were found in Covões and Porto Bordalo (3-

9% and 11%), followed by Quinta (9%) (Figure 5.17a). Annual storm runoff coefficient

through the study period showed a slight impact on storm runoff coefficient of ESAC 

(increased from 12.5% in 2010/11 to 13.4% in 2012/13) (Figure 5.17b). In Covões, 

however, a 2% urban expansion led to a storm runoff increase from 3 to 9%. In Drabl, 

Ribeiro da Póvoa, Quinta and Espírito Santo, the storm runoff coefficients were similar 

over the three hydrological years (18%, 11%, 9% and 21%), despite the urban 

enlargement of 8%, 6%, 16% and 2% (Figure 5.6).

and Espírito Santo), was the number of days without flow greater in 2012/13, following 

the driest year. All the gauging stations experienced lower annual BFI in the driest 

2011/12 year (1% to 36%) and greater values in 2010/11 year (2% to 46%) (Figure 5.19a). 

In 2012/13, despite being the wettest hydrological year of the study period, BFI was 1-

10% lower in the stream network than in 2010/11 (greater losses in Covões), due to the 

antecedent dryness, apart from Porto Bordalo which always showed very low BFI (2%). 

A clear difference was observed in the BFI between gauging stations installed in different 

lithologies: in limestone areas (Porto Bordalo, Drabl and Covões) it did not surpass 5% 

of the annual discharge, whereas in sandstone dominated areas (Quinta, Espírito Santo, 

Ribeiro da Póvoa and ESAC) it ranged between 20% and 40% (Figure 5.19a). In Drabl, 

the low BFI seems to contrast with the reduced number of days without flow, which is 

due to the maintenance of a very small flow (median summer flow of 0.03 L s-1).

Figure 5.19 - Baseflow index variation for individual gauging stations over the study period: (a) 

annual and (b) seasonal mean and standard deviation values. 

The majority of the no flow days were observed in the driest season. Baseflow represents 

a larger proportion of the summer flow than wet season flow (Figure 5.19b). Only in 

Quinta and Espírito Santo, upstream gauging stations on sandstone, was the BFI larger 

in wet periods (24% of the discharge). In Covões gauging station the increase of BFI 

during the wet season was minimal. Through the wet period, BFI was similar between 1) 

Quinta and Espírito Santo (with similar topography and lithology, see Table 5.1), 2) 

Drabl and Porto Bordalo, fully overlaying limestone, and 3) Ribeiro da Póvoa and ESAC 

(downslope gauging stations, both mostly overlaying sandstone). BFI did not 

significantly correlate with catchment area, but it increased with decreasing mean slope 

(r=-0.839, p&lt;0.05). Quinta and Espírito Santo, located at greatest altitudes, were the only 

gauging stations which showed significant correlations between montly BFI and rainfall 

(r=0.472 and 0.449, respectively, p&lt;0.01). 

Annual variation on stormflow was also observed (Figure 5.20). In most of the gauging 

stations storm runoff coefficient increased during the rainy season, from late 

September/October until February – May, but decreased through spring and summer

months. Monthly differences on storm runoff coefficients were greater in Espírito Santo 

and Drabl, ranging between no (or almost) flow in summer and 55%-41% of the rainfall 

in late winter/beginning of spring. However, in Ribeiro da Póvoa and Covões, storm 

runoff coefficients displayed lower annual differences, marked by lower increase through 

the wet season (Ribeiro da Póvoa: 5% - 14% and Covões: 3% - 9%, from October until 

May) and high values in the summer (median values for the three months of 20% in 

Ribeiro da Póvoa and 7% in Covões).

remaining 26% of the catchment flow was provided by the downstream drainage area 

(bellow Drabl and Ribeiro da Póvoa drainage areas, covering 19% of the catchment). 

This downslope area contributed 45% of the outlet baseflow (Figure 5.21b). Nevertheless, 

Ribeiro da Póvoa supplied the majority of the catchment baseflow (53%), since Drabl 

had a minor contribution (2%). Nevertheless, Drabl has a larger contribution to the 

catchment stormflow (35%), despite the important supply from Ribeiro da Póvoa (50%) 

(Figure 5.21c).

Figure 5.21 - Mean contribution of different gauging stations discharge (between 2010/11 and

and Espírito Santo were included in Ribeiro da Póvoa discharge, and Porto Bordalo was 

included in Drabl (see Figure 4.6). 

 

Most of the Ribeiro da Póvoa flow (68%) was supplied by the upstream gauging stations 

(Quinta: 34%, Espírito Santo: 26% and Covões: 8%), which comprised 78% of the 

drainage area (Quinta: 43%, Espírito Santo: 16% and Covões: 19%). However, these

Ribeiro da Póvoa area). Within Drabl, 48% of its flow was delivered by Porto Bordalo, 

which covers 74% of its drainage area. Porto Bordalo provided 20% of Drabl’ baseflow 

and 49% of its stormflow. This results highlight the prominence of the remaining 26% of 

the Drabl’ downslope drainage area (below Porto Bordalo) on flow supply, particularly 

stormflow. 

In sub-catchments overlying limestone, stormflow encompassed the majority of the flow, 

with median values ranging from 62% to 86% during wet periods (increasing from 

Covões, to Drabl and then to Porto Bordalo). In summer, stormflow was even greater in 

Drabl and Porto Bordalo flows (86% and 100%), but it was lower in Covões (50%), 

partially overlying sandstone (36% of the drainage area). Over sandstone lithology, 

stormflow encompassed a considerably lower fractions of the total discharge, with 

median values ranging between 27% to 45% during the wet seasons, but from 16% and 

31% in the dry seasons (increasing from Ribeiro da Póvoa to ESAC, Quinta and Espírito 

Santo).  

 

5.4.3.2.3. Spatio-temporal response during storm events 

Storm event analysis indicated that only a small threshold amount of rainfall was required 

to generate runoff all over the catchment. During wet season, only 0.3 mm of rainfall was 

necessay after several antecedent storm events (API7 &gt;25 mm), whereas under summer 

conditions 0.7 mm was necessary with less antecedent rainfall (API7 &gt;7 mm or API14 

&gt;13mm). The seasonal climate pattern greatly influenced the runoff and storm runoff 

coefficients associated with individual storm events. Storm runoff coefficients were 

higher during the wet (median values ranged from 2% in Covões to 15% in Espírito Santo) 

than dry seasons (from 0.3% in Quinta to 7% in Espírito Santo), particularly in Porto 

Bordalo and Quinta gauging stations (6% vs 0.4% and 6% vs 0.3%, respectively) (Figure 

5.23a). However, largest summer storms were only 14 mm of rainfall, whereas in wet 

periods it attained 29 mm. Runoff coefficients increased with: 1) storm rainfall (r ranged 

between 0.121 and 0.362 for the different gauging stations, p&lt;0.05); 2) maximum 15-

minute rainfall intensity (r ranged between 0.150 and 0.301 for different gauging stations, 

p&lt;0.05), except in Porto Bordalo and Drabl, which always exhibited greater stormflow 

throughout the year; and 3) antecedent rainfall (correlation with API7 ranged between 

0.228 and 0.563 for the different gauging stations, p&lt;0.01, but correlations with API14 

and API30 were also found for the same level of significance). 

At the end of winter (late March 2013), immediately after the largest rainfall period (API7 

&gt;50 mm and API30 &gt;160 mm) the greatest storm runoff coefficient reached 70% of the 

rainfall in the fully limestone areas (Porto Bordalo and Drabl), 52% in Covões, partially 

covered by limestone (62%), 39% at the catchment outlet (ESAC, 41% overlying 

limestone), 37% of the largely urbanized sandstone area (Espírito Santo) and, 14% and

10% in Quinta and Ribeiro da Póvoa, covered by more than 60% of forest under 

sandstone (Figure 5.22b).  

During the summer, the highest storm runoff coefficients were attained in the largest 

urbanized catchments, but did not surpass 18% in Espírito Santo and 11% in Drabl, as a 

result of the greatest rainfall intensities (6-10 mm h-1, in 5-minutes interval). In this 

summer storm, storm runoff coefficient only reached 8% in Porto Bordalo, overlaying 

limestone, 6% in Quinta and Covões, with the largest forest cover, and 3% in ESAC and 

Ribeiro da Póvoa, the largest drainage areas, mainly overlying sandstone. Nevertheless, 

median storm runoff coefficients over three years of study did not show a significant 

correlation with drainage area, mean slope, land-use or percentage impervious area 

(Figure 5.22b).

The higher storm runoff in limestone than sandstone areas, was also supported by the 

differences in peak flows (Figure 5.23). Despite the smaller drainage area of Drabl, 

median peak flow was 50% higher than in Ribeiro da Póvoa. Even the smallest drainage 

area under limestone (Porto Bordalo) displayed marginally higher peak flows than the 

largest sandstone Ribeiro da Póvoa (37 L s-1 vs 26 L s-1), despite the slightly great urban 

cover in the later (Figure 5.6). Drabl and Ribeiro da Póvoa provided 89% of the median 

peak flows of ESAC, but this contribution falls to 50% during the highest storm event. 

These results stresses the importance of downslope catchment area, embracing 12% of 

the catchment urban area, to increase the magnitude of the largest floods. Within 

limestone areas, Porto Bordalo, covering 74% of Drabl drainage area, supplied 66% of 

median peak flows in Drabl. However, contrary to the observations in ESAC, during 

greatest storm events, the runoff contribution from Porto Bordalo increased to 74% of 

the Drabl peak flow, perhaps denoting a greater overland flow connectivity in the upslope 

drainage areas during largest storms. Within Ribeiro da Póvoa, the greater peak flows 

were observed in Quinta, which represents the largest area. However, Espírito Santo with 

slightly lower area than Covões but greater urban cover, showed somewhat higher peak 

flows (Figure 5.23). Nevertheless, considering the normalized discharge (divided by the 

drainage area), Quinta and Covões showed similar median peak flows (0.2 L km-2 s-1), 

but Espírito Santo attained higher values (0.3 L km-2 s-1). Nonetheless, during the largest 

storms, the discharges from Quinta, and particularly Covões, increased deeper than in 

Espírito Santo (peak flow of 2.3 L km-2 s-1, 2.9 L km-2 s-1 and 3.5 L km-2 s-1, respectively).  

 

 
Figure 5.23- Spatial variability of peak flows measured during individual storms within 

Ribeira dos Covões catchment. 

 

Results demonstrate the increase of overland flow connectivity during largest storms 

within all the drainage areas, but particularly within Covões and Quinta. Nevertheless, 

the lower peak flows in Quinta exhibits the delaying effect of the runoff promoted by the

the peak flow increases significantly with: 1) rainfall depth (r ranged between 0.482 and 

0.656 for the different gauging stations, p&lt;0.01); 2) maximum hourly rainfall intensity (r 

ranged between 0.463 and 0.605 for the different gauging stations, p&lt;0.01); and 3) 

antecedent rainfall (correlation with API7 ranged between 0.159 and 0.452 for the 

different gauging stations, p&lt;0.01, but correlations with API14 and API30 were also found 

for the same level of significance). 

The differences in the hydrographs produced by similar rainfall patterns during different 

seasons, particularly on peak flows, may be observed in Figure 5.24 and Figure 5.25. For 

similar rainfall events with 7.2-7.5mm (Figures 5.24a and 5.24b), peak flows were over 

2 times higher under antecedent wet conditions, except in Covões where it decreased (31 

L s-1 vs 20 L s-1). In terms of storm runoff coefficient there were only a slight increase in 

Porto Bordalo, Espírito Santo and Covões (&lt;1.25 times), whereas at the other gauging 

stations the increase was 4-8 times higher, and 11 times higher at the ESAC outlet.

Figure 5.24 (cont.) - Individual storm hydrographs to show the impact of antecedent weather 

conditions on the peak magnitude of the seven gauging stations: a) storm of 7.5 mm in late 

winter (10/04/2013) (API7=15 mm, API14=91 mm, API30=179 mm), b) storm of 7.2 mm during 

summer (07/06/2012) (API7=0.7mm, API14=0.7 mm, API30=12.7mm).  

 

Comparing storm events with similar rainfall amount (22 mm vs 20 mm) observed in 

autumn and in late winter (Figures 5.25a and 5.25b), the differences in peak flows were 

not so accentuated as in previous example, with winter peak flow 1.4-2.6 times higher 

than in autumn. The increases in storm runoff coefficients from autumn to winter were 

minor, except in Covões where it increased 6 times. This may be a result of lower rainfall 

intensity in the winter event (mean rainfall intensity was only 1.3 mm h-1 compared with 

2.4 mm h-1 in the autumn event).

Santo) (Figure 5.26). Within limestone areas, Drabl took five minutes more to reach peak

minutes), which covers 74% of the Drabl area. Covões, with a smaller area mostly on 

limestone, recorded the fastest response time, with a median value of 5 minutes. This 

drainage area, however, included downslope impermeable surfaces (Figure 5.5). In 

Espírito Santo, with more than twice the urban cover of Covões, peak flows were reached 

in a median time of 15 minutes. In fact, Espírito Santo and Drabl showed similar response 

times (p&gt;0.05), may be because, despite the lithology, they have similar land-uses (Figure 

4.7). The largest drainage areas of Ribeiro da Póvoa and ESAC had similar response times 

(p&gt;0.05), with peak flows being reached in a median time of 40 minutes. Quinta 

experienced greater response times than at all the other gauging stations (p&lt;0.05), with a 

median value of 50 minutes. This is because the recent enterprise park drains into a 

constructed detention basin, about 800 m upstream of Quinta gauging station. Field 

observations, however, revealed that during larger storms the flow exceeds the drainage 

capacity of the stream, thus some streamflow run-off into woodland land.

Recession time ranged, in median, from 3h in Porto Bordalo (p&lt;0.05), with the smallest 

drainage area fully overlying limestone, to 7h for the overall catchment (ESAC) (p&lt;0.05) 

(Figure 5.27). Ribeiro da Póvoa, located 750 m upstream of ESAC, draining the second 

largest area, mostly on sandstone, showed a median recession time of 6h. Nevertheless, 

for largest rainstorms at the end of winter, ESAC and Ribeiro da Póvoa stormflow 

sustained for more than 1 day. In Drabl, Covões, Quinta and Espírito Santo recession 

times were similar and showed median values of 4h (p&gt;0.05). Generally, the recession 

time increased with rainfall amount (r ranged between 0.163 and 0.432 for the different 

gauging stations, p&lt;0.01) and maximum hourly intensity (r ranged between 0.178 and 

0.393 for the different gauging stations, p&lt;0.01), as well as with the runoff (r ranged 

between 0.150 and 0.436 for the different gauging stations, p&lt;0.01) and baseflow 

component (r ranged between 0.148 and 0.470 for the different gauging stations, p&lt;0.01).

season, but only 7% of the 310 individual storms analysed occurred during the summer.

5.5. Discussion 

5.5.1. Hydrological response of catchment to weather and climate  

Rainfall seems to be the main driver of Ribeira dos Covões streamflow. Nevertheless, 

previous studies performed under Mediterranean conditions also reported the importance 

of temperature on runoff, due to its influence on potential evapotranspiration (Lacey and 

Grayson, 1998; Rose and Peters, 2001; Lana-Renault et al., 2011). Rainfall and 

temperature also influence baseflow (e.g. Lacey and Grayson, 1998), which represents an 

important component of the catchment annual discharge (37-39%). Rainfall has positive 

and negative effects on baseflow in different seasons, as a result of baseflow recharge 

factors which affect groundwater discharge to streams. Over the year, BFI increases 

during wetting (autumn) and wettest (winter) months, but reached highest values during 

the summer (37% and 63% in wet and dry seasons), as a consequence of the antecedent 

recharge. Only in September was there a substantial decrease of BFI (Figure 5.15b), due 

to lower rainfall and higher water losses promoted by greater evapotranspiration 

(resulting from higher summer temperatures), which leads to a drop in groundwater level. 

The impact of climatic factors on the water table fall was greatest during the driest 

hydrological year (2011/12), when BFI attained the lowest annual value (36%) (Figure 

5.14b). Decreased groundwater level as a result of driest conditions may be also linked 

with enhanced groundwater pumping, for irrigation uses. Based on field observations, 32 

wells for irrigation purposes were identified in Ribeira dos Covões, mainly located in the 

agricultural SE and SW parts of the catchment (overlying sandstone) and in the valley

bottom. In Makaha valley, Hawai, between 1971 and 1991, groundwater pumping was 

estimated to reduce streamflow by 19-22%. Subsequent additional pumping linked to the 

use of a new irrigation well leaded to a 36% reduction on streamflow (Mair and Fares, 

2010).   

Quinta drainage area, located in upslope sandstone, showed an almost continuous flow 

over the year, provided by several active springs, which supplied 16% of the catchment 

baseflow (Figure 5.21b). Only during the driest summer of 2011/12 were there a few days 

without flow, as well as in the subsequent hydrological year (Figure 5.18).  

Generally, the low BFI of Ribeira dos Covões (36%-39%) is typical of catchments with 

low storage capacity (Braund et al., 2013), i.e. high evapotranspiration loss (Figure 5.12), 

but also linked to deep water infiltration. The great infiltration results from the generally 

deep soil and the easy infiltration of rainfall provided by abundant carbonates and 

sandstones. In addition, the deep filled valley on which the catchment is located may lead 

to subsurface flow under the gauge, which contributes for the low annual runoff 

coefficients (14-22%) measured. 

The seasonal variability of rainfall has a noticeable impact on streamflow discharge, 

which increases during the rainy seasons and is restricted in summer. Dry soils in summer 

lead to a small streamflow response, low storm runoff coefficients (Figure 5.17), as 

typically observed under Mediterranean conditions (Lana-Renault et al., 2011). Lower 

storm runoff coefficients in September/October (beginning of the rainy season) have been 

attributed to the rainfall being used to recharge catchment soil moisture (García-Ruiz et 

al., 2008; Lana-Renault et al., 2011). As a consequence, during dry conditions, 

infiltration-excess overland flow is the only active runoff process, occurring in response 

to short and intense rainstorms, mostly over degraded areas (compacted soils with limited 

vegetation cover) and on hydrophobic soils.  

In Ribeira dos Covões, hydrophobicity was identified within woodland areas and 

abandoned agricultural fields (Chapter 3). The impact of hydrophobicity on soil matrix 

infiltration capacity and enhanced overland flow have been reported at the hillslope scale 

(e.g. Ferreira, 1996) and at catchment level (Ferreira et al. 2000), particularly in Ribeira 

dos Covões, as discussed on Chapter 3. However, results from stream gauging stations 

show a limited impact of infiltration-excess from hydrophobic soils at the sub-catchment 

scale. During summer months, infiltration-excess overland flow promoted by 

hydrophobic soils lead to a slight increase in the storm runoff coefficients measured in 

Ribeiro da Póvoa and Covões (Figure 5.20), with the largest woodland areas, mainly 

covered by pine and eucalypt, linked to greatest soil hydrophobic conditions (e.g. Doerr 

et al., 2000). Nevertheless, the low impact at the sub-catchment scale, may be a result of 

the bypass of run-on water through preferential flow paths to deep soil layers, typical of 

vegetated hydrophobic soils (Dekker and Ritsema, 1994; Doerr et al., 2000), but also due 

to enhanced evapotranspiration and great surface water interception and retention of the

limited rainfall amount typical of summer storms, which may be not enough to fill the 

surface depressions and run-off freely (Darboux et al., 2001). Grayson et al. (1997) also 

found that vertical flow is the controlling factor for the dry state of the soil. However, 

during dry periods, in Ribeira dos Covões, streamflow abstraction for private reservoirs 

and field irrigation was observed in sandstone areas. This may reduce the already limited 

streamflow which reaches the gauging stations, masking the hydrophobicity impact on 

catchment discharge. This was seen, for example, within Quinta drainage area, where a 

landowner diverts the streamflow into a tank with a capacity of approximately 100 m3, 

placed 500 m upslope the gauging station.   

Overland flow also occurred in wet periods during larger rainfall events, demonstrated by 

the significant positive correlation between runoff and rainfall intensity during storm 

events. The influence of this runoff process was clearly noticed in 16th November 2009, 

during the largest rainfall event of the study period (Figure 5.14a). However, during the 

wetting-up and drying-down transition periods, the hydrological response was variable, 

with infiltration-excess and saturation runoff processes occurring at the same time in 

different parts of the catchment, depending on the depth of the water table (which could 

be a pershed water table on slopes) before the event and the storm characteristics (depth 

and intensity).  

Saturation overland flow was more prone in late winter and beginning of spring, as a 

result of greater soil moisture content, favoured by water table rise. Soil saturation was 

observed in some valley bottoms, particularly under sandstone and catchment 

downstream. This led to greater storm runoff coefficients from individual late 

winter/spring storms 2-19 times higher than in summer (Figure 5.22). Soil saturation was 

also observed in shallow soils (&lt;0.4 m) of the limestone hillslopes (Ferreira et al., 2014), 

accompanied by subsurface lateral flow (Figure 5.28a). Subsurface saturation restricts 

deeper percolation and enhances the flow above that layer (Dahlke et al., 2012). 

Macropore flow can be a major process controlling the hydrologic response of a 

catchment to storm events (Peters and Ratcliffe, 1998). Nevertheless, subsurface lateral 

flow was also observed within sandstone areas, particularly in upslope areas (Figure 

5.28b). Subsurface flow has been reported to be an important component of the catchment 

hydrology (McDaniel et al., 2008; Buda et al., 2009).

  Figure 5.28- Subsurface lateral flow observed in a) limestone shallow soils and b) upslope 

sandstone. 

 

In Ribeira dos Covões, analysis of individual storm events also showed increased storm 

runoff coefficients with greater antecedent soil moisture, as a consequence of enhanced 

flow connectivity over the hillslope and between the hillslope and the stream network. 

This is indicated by the significant positive correlations between storm runoff coefficient 

and the antecedent precipitation index. In addition, storm size has an effect on the 

occurrence of water ponding as well as on flow connectivity. With smaller storms, patches 

of saturation (or near-saturation) were smaller and the degree of connectivity was 

markedly lower, resulting in smaller trench responses. The location and extension of 

saturated areas varies through time, with antecedent soil moisture. These variable source 

areas have been identified in previous studies in other climatic settings (Troendle, 1985; 

Easton et al., 2008; Dahlke et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2014).  

Flow connectivity is not confined to overland flow but may be also established at the 

subsurface, depending on soil moisture distribution. This pattern is influenced by 

topography, which controls the dynamics of isolated patches of saturation, defining the 

hillslope hydrological system and the catchment response (Famiglietti et al., 1998; Zehe 

et al., 2005). Meerveld and McDonnell (2006) demonstrated that the connectivity 

between subsurface saturation patches was a necessary prerequisite for exceeding the 

rainfall threshold needed to drive sub-surface lateral flow in a Mountain catchment of 

Georgia, USA. A study performed by Hopp and McDonnell (2009) in a hillslope of 

Georgia, showed that significant lateral subsurface stormflow (&gt;1 mm) only occurred 

when more or less well connected hillslope-scale areas of saturation or near saturation 

(within 95% relative saturation) developed at the soil–lithology interface, if the input 

exceed the topography-related threshold to induce spilling that leads to connection. 

Recent studies have shown that during autumn wetting (Harpold et al., 2010) and wet 

(winter) periods (McDaniel et al., 2008) near-stream areas connect with hillside saturated 

areas if the transient water table in the hillslope establishes whole-slope hydraulic 

connectivity. Reduced hillslope connectivity restricts the generation of saturation 

overland flow to small portions of the study area during the heavy rainy season (Haga et 



LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

153 

al., 2005). Srinivasan and McDowell (2009) found that disproportionately large runoff 

amounts are contributed by less than 10% of the catchment area.  

Although no significant seasonal difference being observed in the response time of storm 

events analysed in Ribeira dos Covões catchment, rapid streamflow response was 

observed during near-saturation conditions in previous studies performed under 

Mediterranean climate, due to greater flow connectivity (Hopp and McDonell, 2009; 

Nasta et al., 2013). 

 

5.5.2. Lithological influence on the streamflow regime 

Lithology plays an important role on Ribeira dos Covões discharge, mainly due to 

baseflow regulation. Median annual BFI did not surpass 5% on limestone areas (Porto 

Bordalo, Drabl and Covões), whereas in sandstone it ranged between 25-33% in upstream 

tributaries (Espírito Santo and Quinta, respectively) and 37-38% in downstream areas 

(Figure 5.19a). These differences indicated the perennial regime of most of the sandstone 

areas, which contrasts with the ephemeral regime of the streams draining the limestone 

areas.  

In the study site, seasonal variability on BFI was also affected by the lithology. On 

limestone BFI was twice as high in the dry than wet season, whereas in sandstone it was 

twice as high under wet conditions. These seasonal changes promoted by the lithology 

did not correlate with differences in the number of days without flow. Downstream 

gauging stations showed a continuous (at the outlet) or almost uninterrupted flow over 

the year, despite the great difference in the baseflow levels between sandstone and 

limestone areas (mean annual baseflow of 47 mm in Ribeiro da Póvoa and 5 mm in 

Drabl). In upstream areas, limestone gauging stations (Porto Bordalo and Covões) 

showed nearly twice as many days without flow than the sandstone stations (Espírito 

Santo and Quinta). However, larger number of active springs within Quinta drainage area 

provided more days with flow than Espírito Santo (Figure 5.18). Only in later summer 

did the flow from springs cease. Spring locations may be favoured by the presence of 

geological faults (Figure 5.2a).  

Differences in baseflow were driven by the water table position within the distinct 

lithological units. Water table was closer to the surface in topographic lows, and seems 

to follow the hillslope relief under sandstone areas, whereas in limestone it seems to be 

deeper. Under limestone, typical rock fragmentation may provide deep water infiltration 

and horizontal movement (Almeida et al., 1999), as observed in Ribeira dos Covões 

(Figure 5.28). The multilayer aquifer systems associated with the limestone hillslopes, 

may provide water storage capacity through the rainy season. However, the limited water 

storage in superficial deposits and the thin soils of limestone areas, lead to rainfall 

conversion into storm runoff which enters directly to the stream via overland flow, 



CHAPTER 5 – INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A 

PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE 

 

154 

exhibiting a lower baseflow component in the stream discharge. This could be also 

favoured by the lower woodland cover under limestone areas, leading to lower 

evapotranspiration losses than in sandstone areas.  

Greater silt and clay soil contents in limestone leads to lower permeability than sandstone 

soils (Ferreira et al., 2012c), enhancing storm flow which reaches the stream network. 

This may partially explain the higher storm runoff coefficients and greater peak flows 

measured in limestone areas during individual rainfall events. Median storm runoff 

coefficients reached 2.6% and 3.4% for Drabl and Porto Bordalo, whereas in sandstone 

dominated areas they were&amp;lt;1.5% (Figure 5.22). Drabl also reached median peak flows 

twice as high as at Ribeiro da Póvoa, despite draining half size of the area (Figure 5.23). 

In addition, peak flows in Drabl (reached after 10 minutes) were quickly transferred 

downstream and contributed to the ESAC peak flow (Figure 5.26).  

Despite the above stated differences between baseflow among limestone and sandstone 

areas, the impact of lithology on the recession time was not noticeable (Figure 5.27). This 

may be a result of the influence of different land-use and several topographic 

characteristics, such as relief, elevation, length of stream network and drainage density 

(Zecharias and Brutsaert, 1988; Nathan and McMahon, 1992; Lacey and Grayson, 1998). 

The similar recession time between Drabl and Covões may be due to similar lithology, 

altimetry and mean slope (Table 5.1). Drabl and Espírito Santo have similar land-uses 

(Figure 5.6), Drabl and Quinta, as well as Espírito Santo and Covões drains areas with 

similar size, Espírito Santo and Quinta are both located in upstream sandstone, with 

similar altimetry, and Quinta and Covões, drain the largest woodland areas. This suggests 

the dominance of overland flow on storm runoff. 

 

5.5.3. Impact of land-use and urbanization pattern on streamflow 

During the study period, land-use, and particularly urban areas, did not seem to be a 

significant factor controlling the streamflow response, possibly due to climate variability. 

Although previous studies have identified the land-use as a critical variable in the 

examination of stream discharge (e.g. Tang et al., 2005; Galster et al., 2006; Loperfido  

et al., 2014), other researchers reported the dominance of the weather settings and the 

catchment characteristics on the hydrological response within urbanizing catchments 

(Rose and Peters, 2001; Braud et al., 2013). Some methods have been devised to separate 

the influence of climate and land-use on the hydrology (Semadeni-Davies et al., 2008; 

Franczyk and Chang, 2009), but these methods require long data records and are not 

appropriate if the land-use changes were already happening during the hydrological 

measurements response, as in Ribeira dos Covões.  



LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

155 

Although the limited discharge records preclude consideration of long-term hydrological 

trends, some comments may be inferred as regards to the land-use change in Ribeira dos 

Covões, and specifically to urbanization impact on storm hydrographs and baseflow 

component. At the catchment scale, there was not a clear change tendency on annual 

runoff coefficients through the study period, linked to the urbanization pattern, but runoff 

coefficient was greater in late 2012/13 (22% of the rainfall). Nevertheless, the slightly 

higher rainfall between 2012/13 than 2009/10 (Figure 5.11), reflected in a 5% increase 

on annual runoff coefficients (Figure 5.14) may be indicative of the urbanization 

influence (6% increase in the urban area and 5% increase of the impermeable surfaces), 

particularly noticing the minor decrease on annual BFI. Urbanization has been widely 

reported to enhance runoff and reduce baseflow components of the stream discharge 

(Shuster et al., 2005; Zhang and Shuster, 2014). However, in Ribeira dos Covões the 

decreasing BFI was more a result of the lower recharge in the antecedent dry year than a 

consequence of the urbanization, particularly considering the larger aquifer beneath the 

study site.    

During the study period, greatest peak discharge across the catchment was also observed 

in 2012/13 (Figure 5.16), demonstrating a twice higher magnitude than in previous years, 

greatest than rainfall peak increase. However, the comparison of storm events observed 

between January 2011 and September 2013 did not show increasing peak flows and storm 

runoff coefficients over time (Figure 5.29). Nevertheless, the relationship between the 

urban increase and these streamflow variables may not be noticed for storm events with 

small return period, as the ones observed during the study period (&lt;2 years). Hollis (1975) 

reported that paving over 5% of the landscape did not affect flood peaks with a return 

period of one-year. However, increasing runoff and peak discharges with urbanization 

have been reported in studies performed in USA (e.g. Cook and Dickinson, 1985; Rose 

and Peters, 2001).

CHAPTER 5 – INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A 

PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE 

 

156 

Since increasing urban area in the last few years did not seem to affect the peak flows in 

Ribeira dos Covões catchment, the greatest peak observed in 2012/13 may be a result of 

greater flow connectivity enhanced by greater soil moisture, as discussed in section 

5.4.3.2., associated with the higher rainfall of that year. Larger time series and a multiple 

regression approach may be useful to explore this in future work. 

Based in all gauging stations results, if the hydrological impact of different lithological 

units (discussed in 5.5.2 section) are considered, runoff coefficient increased with urban 

and impermeable surfaces cover (Figure 5.30). Quinta and Covões with the largest 

woodland areas (&gt;80%) of the sandstone and limestone sides, respectively, showed the 

lowest runoff coefficients (14% and 7% over the study period), apart from Porto Bordalo. 

Lower runoff in woodland areas may result from higher transpiration losses and greater 

water interception and retention (e.g. Mahmood et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013). Surface 

roughness, characteristic of woodland land-uses, increases soil irregularities and cavities 

and therefore depression storage capacity, creating opportunities for water infiltration, 

delaying or eliminating overland flow transfer to downstream (Appels et al., 2011; 

Rodríguez-Caballero et al., 2012). Vegetation can create a mixture of run-off and run-on 

sites, determined by soil wetness in semiarid environments, of utmost importance to 

interrupt hydrological connectivity (Appels et al., 2011; Castillo et al., 2003).

Impermeable surfaces seems to control the runoff during dry periods, since despite the 

generally lower runoff coefficient than in the wet season, the largest surface flow was 

measured within the most urbanized areas, Espírito Santo and Drabl. In this highly 

urbanized areas, the winter flow was 2-4 times higher than in dry periods, whereas in the 

other drainage areas, less urbanized, the seasonal difference in the measured flows was 

greater, and reached flows 21 time higher during wet period’s storms than summer flows 

in Quinta.    

Impermeable surfaces have been widely reported to generate overland flow and to 

increase hydrological connectivity (Tang et al., 2005; Meijía and Moglen, 2009). 

However, in sandstone areas, despite the runoff coefficient increased with the urban area, 

the correlation with the impermeable surfaces was rather weak (Figure 5.31b). This may 

be attributable to differences in the urbanization pattern, particularly in Espírito Santo 

and in the overall catchment (ESAC), which affect flow connectivity over the landscape. 

Espírito Santo drains a small area with greatest urban cover (Figure 5.6). Within this 

urban area, mostly represented by older houses, the storm runoff from the impermeable 

surfaces was dispersed in soils between the impermeable urban surfaces or downslope 

agriculture and woodland areas. The absence of storm drainage systems are typical in 

oldest urban cores. In urban areas, the location in the landscape between overland flow 

delivery and the stream network seems to be an important parameter affecting the flow 

connectivity and the catchment discharge. 

Over the study period, despite the great urbanization within Quinta (urban areas increased 

from 9 to 25%), mainly associated to the upstream enterprise park construction, storm 

runoff did not increase (9%, Figure 5.17b). This may be attributed to the minor surface 

sealing of the under construction enterprise park (70% of the area was bare soil, Figure 

5.7). In addition, overland flow generated in the impermeable surface could infiltrated in 

nearby soils or was diverted to the detention basin. Nevertheless, the detention basin was 

designed to reduce the flood peak by temporarily storing the excess stormwater and then 

releasing the water volume at allowable rates over an extended period (Ravazzani et al., 

2014). Apart from the enterprise park, the remaining urban cores established within 

Quinta were mostly dispersed in upslope woodland and/or agricultural fields, enhancing 

the infiltration opportunities before overland flow could reach the stream network. On the 

other hand, in Covões, the 2% enlargement of the urban area during the study period 

(Figure 5.6) led to a storm runoff coefficient increase from 3% to 9% (Figure 5.17b). 

However, the new impermeable surfaces were mostly in downslope locations, where the 

stormwater from roads and rooftops (released on sidewalks) was partially routed to the 

stream channel.

overland flow into the stream network, downslope section of ESAC catchment and d) 

downslope Drabl; and e) stream channelization within downstream Porto Bordalo and f) Drabl. 

 

Although impermeable surfaces generate overland flow, several urban features may 

obstruct water passage to downslope, breaking the flow connectivity. Surface water 

retention may occur due to: 1) tanks used to store channelized streamflow for irrigation 

purposes (Figure 5.32a); 2) surface depressions promoted by soil movement in 

construction areas (Figure 5.32b); and 3) embarkments such as roads constructed above 

natural terrain level (Figure 5.32c), houses and walls constructed in topographic lows 

(Figure 5.32d).

irrigation purposes (~700m3), b) surface depression within a construction site (~1100m3), c) 

detention basin, d) overland flow retention promoted by walls, and e) road embarkment.    

 

Most of these urban features were located in Porto Bordalo and led to a lack of 

connectivity between sources of overland flow and the stream network. This surface water 

retention explains the lower increase of stream discharge during wettest conditions, when 

saturation was observed in some upslope sites. Also an increase of urban areas from 35 

to 42% only increased impermeable surfaces by 2%. Most of the flow which reached 

Porto Bordalo gauging station represents overland flow diverted by the storm drainage 

system installed in downslope urban areas.  

The area between Porto Bordalo and Drabl gauging stations, despite only representing 

26% of Drabl drainage area, provided 51% of its stormflow. This was not only because 

of the lack of connectivity within Porto Bordalo, but also because the great connectivity 

within this highly urbanized area (encompasses nearly 80% of the Drabl urban area), 

promoted by the storm drainage system (Figures 5.32c and 5.32d). The greater flow 

connectivity provided by the storm drainage system within the urban areas was also

PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE 

 

160 

observed in the downslope ESAC drainage area (below Drabl and Ribeiro da Póvoa 

gauging stations), covering 19% of the catchment area. This area was characterized by 

50% urban land-use and was largely served by a storm drainage system (road runoff 

collection), leading to 15% contribution to the catchment storm flow. The downstream 

part of Ribeiro da Póvoa (21% of the drainage area), despite being ~35% urban, supplied 

only 20% of the gauging station stormflow. This lower contribution from the urban areas, 

may be a result of a lower storm drainage system coverage, such that part of the overland 

flow generated finds its way to downslope soils where it infiltrates and fails to reach the 

stream network. 

Only a few studies have investigated the effect of urban areas and impermeable surfaces, 

and their spatial arrangement, on runoff volume, as well as the impact of storm drainage 

system. In a catchment in Indiana, USA, Tang et al. (2005) demonstrated the greater 

impact on runoff volume from urban growth dominated by commercial and high density 

residential uses, compared with the low density residential areas. Several researchers have 

found, through statistical analyses of field data, that some types of urbanization had no 

discernible effects on peak-flows or floods (Dudley et al., 2001). Despite an 161% 

increase in catchment imperviousness from 1.3 to 3.5% in a 34 km2 catchment located in 

southern Maine, Dudley et al. (2001) found that there was no significant change in peak 

flows and hydrograph shape. Hammer (1972) also reported the small effect of impervious 

areas associated with detached houses, unless the gutters connect directly with storm 

sewers. Storm drainage systems result in little opportunity for infiltration. These impacts 

were also reported in the review of impacts of impervious surfaces on catchment 

hydrology (Shuster et al., 2014). Through modelling, Zhang and Shuster (2014) also 

demonstrated that increasing distance to the stream is associated with weaker 

connectivity, because of the infiltration opportunities downslope. Complex interplays 

between spatial distributions of soil, impervious area and catchment shape may result in 

considerable differences within catchments in the changes of runoff behaviour in 

response to urbanization. 

Increasing imperviousness tends to enhance the depth and speed of overland flow by 

diminishing infiltration and leading to quicker response time (Zhang and Shuster, 2014). 

However, the location and the characteristics of the urban cores, particularly the presence 

or absence of storm drainage systems, also have an important impact on the response 

time. Drabl and Espírito Santo, with the largest percentage of urban areas, reached peak 

flows in less than 20 minutes (Figure 5.26). Nevertheless, Drabl drains a considerable 

larger area than Espírito Santo, but in Drabl the stream network receives water mostly 

from downslope urban areas, mainly via storm drainage system, whereas in Espírito Santo 

overland flow runs over the surface because of the absence of storm drainage system. A 

reduced response time during storm events was also found in Porto Bordalo and Covões. 

Despite draining smaller urban areas, the flow reaching the gauging stations was mostly 

supplied by the downslope impermeable surfaces and discharged by storm drainage 

systems a few metres above the gauging stations. In addition, the peak flows in Porto

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

161 

Bordalo represented a considerable fraction of the Drabl peak flow. Peak flows in Drabl 

were reached, in median, only 5 minutes later than Porto Bordalo sub-catchment, located 

~700 m upstream. The quick flow between these gauging stations was favoured by the 

artificial channelization of the stream (Figure 5.31e and 5.31f), which is used to carry 

excess water rapidly away (Baker et al., 2004). The downstream Ribeiro da Póvoa and 

ESAC gauge stations, draining larger areas partially covered by storm drainage systems, 

required in median 40-50 minutes to reach the peak flows. In natural catchments, larger 

streams are usually less flashy than small ones, due to hydrograph mixing accompanying 

flood routing through stream networks and other scale dependent runoff factors (Baker et 

al., 2004). In Quinta, longer response time (~50 minutes) was probably due to in part to 

the distance of the upslope urban cores from the stream network, as the overland flow 

from impermeable surfaces flowed into the downslope woodland soil and infiltrated 

before reachig the stream network, as refered on section 5.4.3.2.3.. Also in the recent 

enterprise park area, overland flow was diverted from the detention basin which delays 

the peak flow observed in Quinta gauging station. According with Baker et al. (2004), 

the construction of storm runoff holding basins is a water management practice that could 

shift flow regimes back toward a more natural condition. 

An urbanization impact on the recession time of storm events was not perceived (Figure 

5.27), possibly due to different sizes of the drainage areas (ESAC and Ribeiro da Póvoa 

with largest areas showed longer recession time), but also due to differences in the 

overland flow drainage systems. Previous studies reported reduced recession time in 

downslope areas of the catchment, in larger streams, as a result of the storm drainage 

systems on rapid transportation of runoff, which mask the effect of the natural drainage 

(Baker et al., 2004). A study performed by Hood et al. (2007) also reported increased lag 

times in areas with low impact development, associated with disconnected impervious 

areas, than traditional residential development. 

Generally, the study of Ribeira dos Covões catchment showed that peri-urbanization, 

characterized by dispersed urban cores and low imperviousness, enhance the lack of flow 

connectivity within the landscape, favouring the maintenance of a more natural 

streamflow, associated with minor stormflows and larger recession time. On the other 

hand, urbanization styles favouring extensive impervious surface will enlarge streamflow 

during rainfall events, particularly if runoff is piped to the stream network. This type of 

urbanization, mostly associated with recent urban cores, can have detrimental impacts on 

flood hazard, particularly if downslope areas are occupied by urban land-uses. Few past 

flood events affected downslope urban areas located adjacent to the watercourse. The 

enlargement of impervious surface within urban areas, mainly located downslope and 

supplied by artificial drainage systems, can enlarge the flood risk within these areas.

PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE 

 

162 

5.5.4. Spatial pattern of urbanization and stormwater management: 

problems and future challenges 

Actual landscape arrangement within Ribeira dos Covões comprises urban areas mainly 

along ridges and downslope catchment (Figure 5.8). Urbanization pattern over the last 

decades created distinctive urban settings characterized by different extension of 

impermeable and semi-permeable surfaces, with storm runoff routed to the stream 

network naturally (following the topography) or through artificial drainage systems. 

Discharge measurements performed in different sections of the stream network revealed 

generally low annual runoff coefficients. Streamflow increased with the urban land-use 

cover, but it was affected by the presence or absence of storm drainage systems, and the 

distance between the source or the storm discharge and the stream network. Urban 

features, such as houses, walls and road embankments, particularly in valley bottoms 

provided surface water retention, breaking the flow connectivity between the sources and 

the stream network. Analyses of storm events revealed greater flows under antecedent 

wettest conditions, demonstrating the increased surface and subsurface connectivity as 

soil moisture increases. The limited retention capacity provided by urban features may 

represent an additional flood hazard, since they may be exceeded by overland flow in 

major rainstorms.  

On 25th October 2006 an extreme daily rainfall event of 102.1 mm led to floods. 

According to Brandão et al. (2001), in Coimbra, rainfall events of 93.6 mm day-1 and 

112.2 mm day-1 have return periods of 10- and 50-years respectively. Flood damage 

included the collapse of walls and costs linked to the flooding of houses in topographic 

lows. The collapse and “dam failure” of urban features which usually retained storm 

runoff exacerbated the problem of downslope and downstream areas. It is unclear if the 

major flood driver was urbanization or extreme rainfall, but according to older local 

residents, other significant flood events were reported about 50 and 80 years ago. 

The presence of the storm drainage systems and the partial channelization of the stream 

network leads to quicker runoff concentrations in downslope areas. Althoug the median 

response time of the catchment was 40 minutes, sub-catchment gauging stations with 

downslope urban areas (Porto Bordalo, Drabl and Covões), reached peak flows in less 

than 20 minutes. This flashy response of the catchment highlight the problem of the local 

authorities to activate timely warning and alert systems.   

However, within Ribeira dos Covões, problems with storm management were not only 

observed in the downstream section of the catchment, where flow depths are usually 

greater. The lack of capacity of the stream network and/or hydraulic infrastructures 

located upslope also caused occasional inconvenience for local population. These 

problems were driven by the partial obstruction of culverted drains with sediments and/or 

plant material (Figure 5.33a), and the limited flow capacity of some stream sections 

(Figure 5.33b). These problems were identified mainly near Quinta gauging station, and 



LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

163 

are recognized by the local residents as an increasing problem after the construction 

activities in the upslope enterprise park. The deforestation of a considerable area 

increased the overland flow and although the retention basin stores most of this and 

releases it after a delay, the flow capacity of the downslope stream is not enough to carry 

all the additional runoff promoted by the urbanization process. Damages has been 

reported in the downslope agricultural fields, in terms of crop losses and soil erosion. 

 

a) b) 

  

  Figure 5.33 - Problems with current storm drainage system: a) decreased flow capacity of drain 

pipes due to sediment deposition, and b) limited flow capacity by artificial bottleneck of the 

stream channel. 

 

Projected urban changes indicate a substantial development within the catchment for the 

near future, mainly in the upper catchment, with the enlargement of the enterprise park 

area. This additional urbanization will enhance even more the runoff and reduce water 

infiltration opportunities, exacerbating the actual problems of stormwater management. 

To minimize these problems it would be necessary to enlarge the river bed, particularly 

downslope the enterprise park. However, this will bring social resistance since the stream 

flows through private properties, and expropriation processes or loss of private land is 

always difficult to accept, at least in Portugal. On the other hand, it is also important that 

responsible authorities provide adequate maintenance and cleaning of the river bed and 

hydraulic structures. But different authorities are responsible for the stormwater 

management across the catchment. For instance, local authorities are responsible for the 

stream bed, municipal water authority is responsible for the storm drainage system, 

whereas hydraulic structures associated with the major road construction belong to the 

national semi-private authority responsible for the national roads. The involvement of 

different legal authorities within the same catchment is not easy and represents a 

management challenge, particularly within a national scenario of economic crises.  

An additional challenge is related to the stream network flowing mainly through private 

properties, some of them fenced without easy access, which makes intervention by the 

authorities difficult. Thus, landowners sometimes take actions which affect the 

streamflow. For example, in 2014, a landlord decided to install small branches and trunks 



CHAPTER 5 – INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A 

PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE 

 

164 

in the stream channel, few metres upstream Ribeiro da Póvoa gauging station, within his 

property, in order to prevent bank erosion. However, this led to a local reduction of the 

flow capacity and flooding of the surrounding land. In the past, private owners were 

responsible for maintenance of the river bed, and they could be fined if inappropriate 

management was performed. The loss of this landowners’ responsibility and restricted 

maintenance by the authorities has accentuated the state of degradation of many 

Portuguese rivers. Another problem resulting from rivers flowing through private 

properties is associated with illegal constructions close to the streams. For example, a 

private house under construction in the river bed, involved local stream diversion a few 

metres above Espírito Santo gauging station. Despite national legislation forbiden 

construction activities within 100 m of a river (Lei nº58/2005), cases like this do occur. 

The current houses and walls installed in valley bottoms of Ribeira dos Covões should be 

of increasing concern in a continuous urbanization process, not only because of the social 

expropriation problems already discussed, but also for the economic and social fragilities 

of these local residents.  

Appropriate stormwater management is required to minimize the runoff increment 

provided by additional urbanization. This requires a complement to the actual and the 

above stated measures associated with the current storm drainage system. Additional 

measures may include dry detention ponds to store and delay runoff excess in the 

limestone areas, infiltration basins within sandstone areas (based on greater infiltration 

capacities of sandstone than limestone soils) and use of permeable pavements in the new 

urban cores. These structures and measures would diminish increases in peak discharge 

and runoff volume, as well as increases lag times and retention of smaller and more 

frequent rainfall events (Baker et al., 2004; Hood et al., 2007; Loperfido  et al., 2014). 

Structural measures, however, need to be complemented with non-structural measures, 

such as adequate land management and urban planning at the catchment level. The 

magnitude of the potential benefits of land-use planning based on water resource impacts, 

in particular on runoff processes and systems affected by runoff processes, is largely 

unknown. A few studies, however, have been demonstrating the potential of distributed 

hydrological models to investigate the hydrological impacts of new urban areas. Zheng 

and Baetz (1999) evaluated design alternatives for new urban cores and found that designs 

with smaller total development area can effectively reduce the increase of peak flows and 

total runoff volumes due to development, when compared with less efficient designs. 

Moglen et al. (2003) suggested a framework for quantifying smart growth in land 

development in which the runoff impact was reduced by minimizing the total area change 

in imperviousness. Both studies revealed that the impact of development can be reduced 

by limiting the total impervious area. Ravazzani et al. (2014) used a distributed 

hydrological model to evaluate the impacts of downstream detention basins, in order to 

investigate the best location within the urbanized catchment to install them. Nonetheless, 

the magnitude that runoff can be minimized depends on site specific land-use types, soil 

properties and the urbanization level of a catchment. Smart growth is being promoted as 



LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

165 

a progressive approach to development. One of the goals of smart growth is water 

resources protection, in particular minimizing the impact of urban sprawl on runoff and 

systems affected by runoff processes (Tang et al., 2005) 

 

5.6. Conclusions 

Land-use changes, particularly associated with peri-urbanization have affected the 

hydrological processes. In Ribeira dos Covões catchment, although urban surfaces cover 

near 40% of the catchment area annual runoff coefficient did not exceed 22%. This 

chapter highlighted the importance of distinct biophysical properties, such as weather, 

lithology and urban style and its distribution over a catchment on streamflow variation: 

1. Runoff is mainly generated by infiltration-excess overland flow processes, dominant 

during dry conditions, and by saturation and subsurface lateral flow during wet 

weather. Through wet season, increasing surface and subsurface flow connectivity, 

promoted by soil moisture rise, led to highest storm runoff coefficients in late winter. 

However, in Ribeiro da Póvoa (mainly sandstone) and Covões (mostly limestone), 

storm runoff coefficients were higher in the summer, possibly due to infiltration-excess 

promoted by woodland hydrophobic soils. 

2. Sandstone areas showed a perennial regime, with few days without flow even in 

driest periods, and with baseflow representing 30% to 40% of the annual flow. Streams 

in limestone areas were only active during rainfall events, except Drabl which is 

located downslope, showing a continuous trickle flow. Thus, baseflow delivered by 

the limestone areas represented ~2% of the annual catchment baseflow. During storm 

events, limestone areas provided a greater contribution to the peak flow at the 

catchment outlet than sandstone areas. Quicker response time in limestone than 

sandstone sub-catchments were found (&lt;15 minutes vs. 15-50 minutes). 

3. Considering the results from gauging stations installed in similar lithology, storm 

runoff coefficients over the study period increased with the urban cover and provided 

quicker peak flows. In sandstone areas storm runoff coefficients ranged from 9% in 

Quinta, with 9% urban area, and 21% in Espírito Santo, represented by 23% urban 

surface. Overlaying limestone, storm runoff coefficients ranged from 3% in Covões, 

with a 15% urban area, to 18% in Drabl, encompassing 47% urbanization.  

4. Over the study period, the urbanization impact on streamflow at the catchment outlet 

and upstream gauging stations varied according with the type of urbanization, 

particularly if it was patchy and dispersed within the landscape or not, the distance to 

the stream network and the type of storm drainage system. An urban area increase of 

about 2% (from 15% to 17%), mainly located downslope and with storm runoff being 

piped to the stream led to a storm runoff increase from 3% to 9% in Covões. On the 



CHAPTER 5 – INFLUENCE OF THE URBANIZATION PATTERN ON STREAMFLOW OF A 

PERI-URBAN CATCHMENT UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE 

 

166 

other hand, an urban cover increase from 9% to 25% (Quinta), in upslope locations 

and with storm runoff coefficient being diverted to downslope urban and woodland 

soils, did not have a discernible impact on storm runoff coefficient (14%). The type of 

urbanization also plays an important impact on the storm reponse time, with 

downslope urban areas connected to artificial storm drainage system reaching the peak 

flow in 5 minutes (Covões), wereas in larger areas with upslope dispersed urban cores 

it takes 40 minutes (Ribeiro da Póvoa and ESAC). When storm runoff runs freely 

and/or is diverted into pervious soils it may be infiltrated. Furthermore, surface water 

retention, either provided by vegetated surfaces or urban infrastructures (e.g. 

embarkments and walls), may break flow connectivity and/or retard its downslope 

transfer, minimizing the impact of urbanization on streamflow.  

The creation of local opportunities for water infiltration, provided by an appropriate 

urbanization pattern, associated with the size and position of urban developments on the 

landscape, the degree of sealing and the strategy for stormwater management (storm 

drainage system and the location where runoff is delivered within the landscape), should 

be considered in catchment management and urban planning. This is of utmost 

importance to break the flow connectivity and minimize flood hazard. However, 

identifying the best arrangement of urban patches whilst maximizing the use of land for 

urban development needs now to be a research priority.

ABSTRACT 

 

Peri-urban areas are characterized by a complex land-use pattern which influences 

surface water quality. In this study, the impact of land-use pattern was investigated 

through surface water quality assessment in Ribeira dos Covões, a peri-urban 

catchment (615 ha) in central Portugal, with a 40% urban cover. Besides catchment 

outlet, surface water quality was monitored in three upstream locations, encompassing 

different drainage areas (56 – 150 ha). Two of the sub-catchments are of similar 

percentage urban cover (42% and 49%) but different lithologies (sandstone and 

limestone), whereas the third is of lower urban extent (25%) and includes a construction 

site covering 10% of its drainage area. Numerous surface water samples were collected 

during ten rainfall events (of different amount and intensity), between October 2011 

and March 2013. Several chemical parameters, including nutrients, major cations and 

metals were analysed. The results were compared with Portuguese national water 

quality guidelines for environmental and irrigation uses, and the spatio-temporal 

variation of pollutant loads was assessed. The outcomes of the study highlight the 

complexity of spatio-temporal impact on surface water quality, particularly considering 

the variations of analytical parameters between sites. Generally, chemical loads per unit 

area increased in the study site with greater urban land-use extent. Parameters such as 

EC, COD, NO2+NO3, Ca, Mg and K on dissolved phase of surface water also increased 

with percentage impervious surface. The role of hydrological connectivity between 

pollutant sources and the stream network is discussed. COD, nutrients (Nk, NH4, 

NO2+NO3 and TP) and Mn attained highest concentrations during the first rainfall 

events after the summer, as a result of lower dilution effect provided by the low 

discharge. Standards for minimum water quality and recommended guidelines for 

irrigation practices were occasionally exceeded, not only during low flow conditions, 

but also in wettest settings. Further monitoring is required for a fuller understanding of 

the spatio-temporal changes of water quality. The information gained, however, should 

guide sustainable landscape management and urban planning, in order to avoid 

conflicts between urban development and water quality degradation in peri-urban 

catchments.

TO RAINFALL EVENTS

6.1. Introduction 

The replacement of natural land surfaces, including woodland and agricultural areas, by 

impervious coverage, such as paved roads, car parks and roofs, leads to significant 

changes on both quantity and quality of the stormwater runoff, with deleterious impacts 

on stream ecosystems (e.g. Arnold and Gibbons, 1996; Brilly et al., 2006). Urban runoff 

has been considered a major non-point source of pollutants within catchments (Wahl et 

al., 1997; Schoonover and Lockaby, 2006; Yu et al., 2012). Research studies have 

identified high loads of heavy metals from industrial sources (Pitt and Maestre, 2005; Qin 

et al., 2013), roads and vehicular traffic (Ellis et al., 1986; Emmenegger et al., 2004; 

Gilbert and Clausen, 2006; Li et al., 2012) and material corrosion (Neff et al, 1987). 

Organic matter, nutrients and pathogenic microorganisms have been also found with 

greater concentrations within urban areas due to sewage contaminations, resulting from 

septic tanks (Gold et al., 1990; Steffy and Kilham, 2004), combined sewer systems 

(Gromaire et al., 2001; Soonthornnonda et al., 2008; Mannina and Viviani, 2009), sewage 

leaks (Le Pape et al., 2013) and discharge of wastewater treatment plants (Yu et al., 2014). 

In addition, high loads of nutrients and the presence of pesticides have also been identified 

in the runoff from pervious urban surfaces, such as lawns and golf courses, as a result of 

inappropriate management, linked to fertilization and irrigation activities (Steuer et al., 

1997; Khai et al., 2007). Soil erosion also represent a significant source of suspended 

sediments, as well as nutrients and heavy metals in particulate forms (Line et al., 2002; 

Goonetilleke et al., 2005; Atasoy et al, 2006). These contaminants will have a detrimental 

impact upon water quality and aquatic organisms. 

It is usually accepted that pollutant loads increase with the percentage of total impervious 

area (Arnold and Gibbons, 1996; Morse et al., 2003; Kuusisto-Hjort and Hjort, 2013). 

However, the impact of different urban cores configuration (e.g. isolated houses with 

gardens vs townhouses) and their location within catchments have been recognised as 

important parameters affecting pollutant transport and water quality impacts (e.g. 

Corbetts et al., 1997). Based on a study performed in Queensland, Australia, Goonetilleke 

et al. (2005) observed greater pollutant load from detached houses than multifamily 

dwelling units, due to a greater extent of road surface area and higher nitrogen 

concentrations resulting from gardens extension and fertilise use in detached housing 

areas comparing with high-density residential development. Main roads and industrial 

areas have been also associated with greater suspended sediments and heavy metals than 

residential, open spaces and commercial areas (Pitt and Maestre, 2005). In addition, the 

location within the landscape can play a significant role on streamwater quality impact. 

Urban areas located downslope may provide runoff flowing into the stream network, 

whereas runoff from upslope areas may be infiltrated and/or retained in downslope 

pervious areas (Groffman et al., 2004; Wilson and Weng, 2010; Carey et al., 2011), if the 

natural drainage is not replaced by artificial drainage systems. 



LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

171 

The complex landscape of peri-urban areas, characterized by a mosaic of different land-

uses and urban infrastructures, determines the potential sources and sinks of pollutants 

and the impacts on streamwater quality (Booth and Jackson, 1997; Brabec et al. 2002; 

Groffman et al., 2004). Despite the importance of knowing potential runoff and pollutant 

sources and understanding their connectivity with the stream network, it requires further 

investigation. Apart from land-use, runoff properties can vary significantly with rainfall 

characteristics, such as the amount and intensity (Memon et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2014). 

For example, Rodríguez-Blanco et al. (2013) observed that 68% of phosphorus transport 

ocurred in storm events. In a small catchment of Macau, chemical oxygen demand (COD) 

ranged between 41 and 464 mg L-1 during five rainfall events (Huang et al., 2007). Inter-

storm variability observed in a typical urbanizing area of China also leaded to mean COD 

concentration with 5-folder difference (Qin et al., 2013). Furthermore, the length of 

Antecedent Dry Period (ADP) may greatly affect runoff discharge and its characteristics, 

due to pollutant accumulation, from atmospheric deposition (Sullivan et al., 1978; Valiela 

et al., 1997; Easton and Petrovic, 2004) from natural sources (e.g. pollen) and human 

activities, such as vehicular traffic (Bannerman et al., 1993; Li et al., 2012). During 

rainfall events, pollutants are totally or partially washed-off, depending on rainfall 

characteristics. Rainfall intensity determines the available energy to overcome surface 

resistance (Athayde et al., 1982), whereas rainfall volume affects the removal rates and 

pollutant dilution (Helsel, 1978). Higher pollutant concentration during dry seasons have 

been reported by several authors (Barbosa and Hvitved-Jacobsen, 1999; Zhang et al., 

2007), but the influence of climate on temporal variability of pollutant load and its 

influence on streamwater quality is not fully understood.     

The main aim of this part of the study is to investigate the impact of different land-uses 

and distinct urbanization patterns, typical of Portuguese peri-urban areas, on surface 

water quality during storm events. The specific objectives are to: 1) assess spatio-

temporal variability of several physical-chemical parameters (including solids, nutrients, 

major cations and metals) of the streamwater, during different rainfall events; 2) explore 

the influence of rainfall pattern on chemical loads; 3) verify if the monitored parameters 

exceed Portuguese minimum surface water quality and irrigation water uses; and 4) 

discuss the influence of land-use pattern on streamwater quality.  

Knowledge of spatio-temporal variability of potential runoff and pollutant sources and 

sinks are relevant to guide decision-makers and policy actors to implement the most 

suitable solutions to achieve good water quality and preserve aquatic ecosystems. 

However, understanding the relationship between land-uses and physical-chemical runoff 

properties, and how they change before reach the stream network, is essential for urban 

planning and catchment management, in order to prevent water quality degradation within 

peri-urban areas.

6.2. Study Area 

The Ribeira dos Covões study area has been characterized by a fast urbanization process, 

linked to population increase from about 2500 to 8000 inhabitants between 1958 and 

2011. Nowadays, the land-use is largely dominated by woodland areas (56%), with a 

significant urban cover (40%) and only minor sparse agricultural fields (4%). Urban land-

use comprises mostly residential areas, including some leisure areas, commercial 

buildings (small supermarkets and pastry shops), educational and health services, 

including a central hospital, and few facilities (garage shops, sawmill and a pharmaceutic 

industry). An enterprise park, covering 5% of the catchment area, is under construction 

in the catchment headwaters. A network of roads extends across the catchment, covering 

7% of its area, and includes a recent motorway. Residential areas comprise distinct urban 

cores with contrasting urbanization styles, marked by single-family houses, most of them 

surrounded by gardens, and apartment blocks (mostly in downslope catchment). These 

distinct residential areas are linked to contrasting population densities, ranging from&amp;lt;25 

inhabitants km-2 to &gt;9900 inhabitants km-2 (Tavares et al., 2012). Agricultural land-use is 

dominated by a few olive plantations, pasture areas with extensive cattle rearing and small 

family farms. Pasture areas are mostly concentrated along the stream network. 

Within the urban areas, the artificial drainage network encompasses separated systems 

for stormwater and wastewater transport. Urban storm runoff is collected in culverts and 

gutters, covering the majority of the road network, and is routed/piped to the main river 

or into its tributaries. In urban settlements surrounded by agricultural and woodland soils, 

stormwater just dissipates in these areas. Runoff from the enterprise park is partially 

routed to a retention basin and then to a downslope tributary, with a delay during peak 

flows. Domestic effluent is piped to a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), located 

outside the catchment. However, a small WWTP was installed about 30 years ago within 

Ribeira dos Covões, in an upslope area, in order to receive the wastewater from a small 

urban core. Despite being abandoned several years ago, only recently (~3 years) was it 

effectively disabled, with the wastewater being routed to the larger sewer network. During 

this period, sewage was piped to the WWTP infrastructure and released to the surface 

water network. The landowners of downslope agricultural fields reported several 

damages on crop production and irrigation systems during this period. 

In this region, water supply for human consumption is provided by groundwater sources, 

whereas surface water is mostly used for irrigation purposes.

6.3. Methodology 

6.3.1. Sampling strategy: spatial and temporal 

Locations for surface water sampling were considered in order to assess the influence of 

different land-uses, particularly with distinct urban cores. Apart from the catchment outlet 

(ESAC), three additional sub-catchment sites were selected upstream: Espírito Santo, 

embracing an urban land-use associated with high imperviousness intensity; Porto 

Bordalo, with similar urban extent but sprawl imperviousness; and Quinta, encompassing 

a minor urban area but covering the enterprise park under construction (covering 10% of 

the drainage area) (Figure 6.1). However, the selected sub-catchments do not differ only 

in land-use, but also in the extent of drainage areas and lithology, as shown in Table 6.1. 

Flow regime of the selected drainage areas is also distinctive: ESAC has perennial flow, 

whereas the Quinta and Espírito Santo streams dry in summer, and Porto Bordalo flow 

is ephemeral.

(S.: sandstone, L.: limestone; A.: alluvial). 

 
NOTE: Land-use and land cover was based on Corine Land Cover 2007, and updated through Google Earth Imagery 13/06/2012 and 

field observations. Within the urban areas, impervious surfaces represent sealed soil, such as roads and buildings, semi-pervious 

consists of construction sites, parking zones, courtyards and sidewalks, and pervious surfaces encompasses gardens. Open spaces 

consists of clear-felled areas.  

 

Surface water samples were collected during 10 rainfall events, observed between 

October 2011 and March 2013. Sampling dates were based on weather forecast, in order 

to assess rainfall events with different frequency, following dry and wet conditions. Prior 

to each rainfall event, whenever possible, one sample was taken from each monitored 

site, if stream was flowing, to provide the base water quality level. Additional samples 

were collected after the rainfall start, in order to assess hydrograph variation (raising limb, 

peak discharge and the falling limb). Samples were collected manually. Due to limited 

human resources, samples were taken at different times in each study site. Time 

differences ranged between 15 to 30 minutes for equivalent site samples, except in cases 

were no significant flow difference was observed when compared with the previous 

sample taken on that specific site. It was considered that rainfall event ended when no 

additional rainfall was observed during a period of 8 h (Asdak et al., 1998). Because of 

the different flow regimes between study sites, the number of water samples was 

dissimilar. In total, 76 samples were taken in ESAC, 75 in Porto Bordalo, 56 in Espírito 

Santo and 58 in Quinta. Each sample was analysed for a large number of water quality 

parameters. 

Rainfall and discharge data were provided by the hydrological network in Ribeira dos 

Covões. Rainfall data were provided by weighted average values from 5 rainfall tipping-

buckets (assumed for all the sub-catchments), and discharge data was provided by water 

level records, with a 5-minutes interval, at each stream gauging station. 

 

6.3.2. Analytical procedures 

Grab water samples were collected into different containers, according with the analytical 

parameters. Two-liter polyethylene bottles were used for chemical oxygen demand 

(COD), nitrogen, including kjeldahl nitrogen (Nk), ammonium (NH4), and nitric oxide 

(NO2+NO3), major cations (such as sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca) and 

potassium (K)), and metals (such as iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), cupper (Cu), zinc (Zn)

and cadmium (Cd)). Smaller polyethylene bottles (250 mL) were used for pH, electrical 

conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids as NaCl (TDS), turbidity and total solids (TS) 

analysis. Glass bottles (250 mL) were also used to collect samples for total phosphorus 

(TP) quantification. Some water quality parameters including pH, EC and TDS were 

measured on site, using a portable meter (Hach, Sension Portable case). The samples were 

transported to the laboratory in thermal boxes with ice (~4ºC) and stored. 

In the laboratory, the 2-L water samples were filtered through a 0.45 ?m nitrocellulose 

filter (Millipore filters), using a vacuum pump, in order to quantify the dissolved fraction 

of several chemical elements, as described in Standard Method 3030-E (APHA et al., 

1998). Aliquots of filtered samples were then stored in smaller bottles. For major cations 

and metals, samples were acidified with nitric acid and frozen until analysis. Samples for 

COD, Nk, NH4 and TP were acidified with sulphuric acid and subsequently frozen. 

Samples for nitric oxide were only frozen. Sample storage and preservation was 

performed in accordance with Standard Method 1060-C (APHA et al., 1998). 

Turbidity was analysed in the original water samples, using a single beam 

spectrophotometer (Hach DR 2000) according with the HACH-8237 method, range 0-

1000 NTU (HACH, 1999). Total solids (TS) were quantified through sample evaporation 

at 105ºC, until constant weight, following Standard Method 2540-B (APHA et al., 1998). 

COD was quantified by using a low range (0 to 150 mg L-1) kit test (HI 93754A-25, 

Hanna Instruments). The sample was measured (2 mL) into digestion vials and oxidized 

at 150ºC during 2h, in a reactor digester (HACH), under acidic conditions. The remaining 

dichromate ion concentration was determined through absorbance at 420 nm (Hach DR 

2000 spectrophotometer). The method is in accordance with EPA 410.4 and ISO 

15705:2002 standards. Total phosphorus was also analysed with a low range (0.00 to 3.50 

mg L-1) test kit (HI 93758A-50, Hanna Instruments). The method is based on acid 

persulfate digestion at 150ºC over 30 minutes (Hach reactor digester), followed by 

reaction with molybdate ascorbic acid and antimony potassium tartrate. Subsequent 

quantification was performed at 610 nm (single beam spectrophotometer, Hach DR 2000) 

(adapted from EPA 365.2 and 4500-P E Standard Methods). 

Analytical procedure for Tk (including ammonia, organic and reduced nitrogen forms, 

excluding nitrate and nitrite) was based on Standard Method 4500-Norg B (APHA et al., 

1998), with samples digestion performed at 400ºC, during 2h (J.P. Selecta reactor), with 

selenium catalyser. Digested samples were than distilled in a Kjeltec System 1026 

Distilling Unit (Tecator), followed by titration with hydrochloric acid, performed in 

automatic burette. 

Ammonium nitrogen was quantified according with the Skalar Method 155-316 (Skalar, 

2004a), based on ISO 14255: 1998. This method focus on molecular absorption 

spectrophotometry, performed in a segmented flow auto-analyser (SAN++ system). It is 

based on a modified Berthelot reaction and subsequent quantification at 660 nm. Nitric

TO RAINFALL EVENTS 

 

176 

oxide was also measured in the auto-analyser SAN++ system, using the Skalar Method 

461-322 (Skalar, 2004b). This method was adjusted from ISO 14255: 1998 and is based 

on nitrate reduction within a cadmium-cupper column, coupling with N-1-

napthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride and quantification at 540 nm.  

Major cations and metals were quantified after digestion with nitric acid, in accordance 

with Standard Method 3030-E (APHA et al., 1998), through ebullition in hotplates. 

Individual chemical elements were than quantified by atomic absorption 

spectrophotometry (Perkin Elmer AA300 analyser), with direct air-acetylene flame 

method and corresponding hollow cathode lamp, in accordance with Standard Method 

3111-B (APHA et al., 1998).     

Water samples were defrozen at room temperature before analysis. Some samples 

required dilution, in order to fit the method range. Reagent blanks and duplicate samples 

were used for quality control purposes and mean concentration values (repeated analysis 

of same sample) were used in data analysis. 

 

6.3.3. Data analysis 

The hydrological regime of the ten sampled rainfall events was characterized in terms of 

rainfall and stream discharge. For each rainfall event, the amount, duration and intensity 

of the rainfall was calculated. Rainfall intensity was described in terms of the event mean 

value (Imed) and maxima in 15- and 60- minutes (I15 and I60). Antecedent precipitation 

index values were calculated as the sums of the precipitation in 7 and 14 days prior to 

each rainfall event (API7 and API14). Streamflow parameters used included instantaneous 

flow (at the time of water sampling) and event flow description. Surface and baseflow 

components were also estimated for individual hydrographs, using a mathematical digital 

filter (Nathan and McMahon, 1990). 

The results of surface water quality parameters were visualized by box- and whisker 

diagrams for the four study sites, over the ten rainfall events monitored. Statistical 

differences between the four study sites were investigated through the analysis of 

individual water qualiy parameters (based in all the sample results of each site), using the 

non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, since the criteria for normal distribution was not met. 

Surface water quality differences over the time were also explored for individual 

parameters, considering all the measurements performed in each rainfall events, based on 

the same statistical test. Whenever significant spatial and/or temporal water quality 

differences were identified, further investigation was carried out with post-hoc Fisher's 

Least Significant Difference test. All the statistical analysis were accomplished for a 95% 

confidence interval. The relationship between individual water quality parameters, and 

between water quality and the discharge properties at the sampling time (flow, surface 



LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

177 

and baseflow component at sampling time) were explored using Spearman’s rank 

correlation coefficient (r). 

Water quality parameters were compared with Portuguese guidelines, established for 

environmental goals of minimum surface water quality, as well as for irrigation uses 

(Ministry of Environment, 1998). As regards to irrigation purposes, the results were 

compared with the established maximum recommended values (MRV) and maximum 

admissible values (MAV) defined by the legislation. According with the Portuguese water 

irrigation standards, Sodium Adsorption Relation (SAR) parameter was calculated for 

individual water samples (equation 1): 

SAR= Na / [(Ca + Mg) /2] ½      (1) 

where Na is the concentration of sodium; Ca is the concentration of calcium, and Mg 

represents the concentration of magnesium. All the concentrations are expressed in meq 

L-1. 

In order to assess the impact of different rainfall events on water quality, pollutant loads 

were calculated for the four study sites. Event load (EL) was estimated for all quantifiable 

parameters analysed, based on weighted mean concentration per rainfall event (EMC) 

(equation 2). EMC was calculated using equation 3, adapted from Qin et al. (2010) 

methodology, developed for discrete water samples. 

EL = EMC × Qt    (2) 

where EL is the event load, EMC is the event weighted mean concentration, and Qt is the 

total streamflow during the event. 

Total streamflow represents the cumulative flow during individual sampling events. The 

duration of the streamflow was defined by the time between the first and the last water 

sample collected in each monitoring date. This assumption does not consider the different 

flow regimes between study sites, displayed by dissimilar hydrograph shapes. However, 

this criterion was considered the most adequate for comparison purposes between study 

sites, since water samples were collected at different times and distinct stages of the 

hydrographs. 

EMC = ? (Ci   Qi) / ? Qi       (3) 

where EMC is the event mean concentration, Ci is the concentration at time i, and Qi is 

the streamflow at time i. 

Specific event loads (SEL) were calculated by dividing EL for the extent of the drainage 

area, in order to better assess the impact of different land-uses within the study sites. SEL 

represents the mass of the physical-chemical property washed off per unit area per rainfall 

event, and describes the area-averaged intensity of runoff property loads.

CHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION 

TO RAINFALL EVENTS 

 

178 

The impact of hydrological processes and catchment biophysical properties on spatio-

temporal variation of EMCs and ELs, was explored through Spearman correlation 

analysis (r). The role of the rainfall characteristics (amount, duration, intensity – including 

Imed, I15 and I60) on catchment physico-chemical parameters wash-of and their influence 

on stream water quality was considered, together with the possible effect of build-up 

parameters between rainfall events (through the correlation of EMCs and ELs with API7 

and API14). The correlation of EMCs and ELs with sub-catchments total streamflow 

during montitored rainfall events was investigated, as well as the importance of storm 

flow on catchment physico-chemical properties wash-off. The baseflow contribution for 

potential dilution effect of storm flow physic-chemical properties and/or contribution 

with specific chemical properties were also investigated. The influence of distinct 

lithologies (percentage of sandstone and limestone) on different water chemical 

parameters was also assessed through the correlation with EMCs and ELs. The 

biophysical properties of the sub-catchments also included the land-use cover (percentage 

of woodland, agriculture and urban) and the extent of impervious surfaces (percentage of 

the drainage area). All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 

software. 

 

6.4. Results and analysis 

6.4.1. Storm rainfall 

Sampling performed in Ribeira dos Covões catchment was linked to different rainfall 

events, associated with dissimilar amount, duration and intensity, following different 

antecedent weather conditions, as summarized on Table 6.2 and shown on Figure 1 of 

Annex. Rainfall ranged from small (2.3 mm) to larger amounts (46.8 mm), falling within 

a few hours (2.3 h) or more than one day (93.3 h). The rainfall event of 02/11/2011 was 

different from all the other measurement dates (p&lt;0.05), in terms of its greatest rainfall 

intensity (I15=24.0 mm h
-1).

Mean storm streamflow increased with rainfall amount (Figure 6.2) (r=0.648 and 0.685 

in ESAC and Espírito Santo, p&lt;0.05), particularly in Porto Bordalo which exhibits a 

ephemeral flow regime (r=0.806, p&lt;0.01). In Quinta sub-catchment, the largest woodland 

land-use cover (67%) and the presence of several springs, could have masked the 

significance of the correlation between mean runoff and rainfall depth (p&gt;0.05). Only in 

Porto Bordalo, where part of the impervious surface runoff is piped directly to upstream 

gauging station, and Espírito Santo, with the largest impervious surface cover, was mean 

storm flow significantly correlated with maximum rainfall intensity measured in 15- 

(r=0.903 and 0.806, p&lt;0.01, respectively) and 60-minutes (r=0.794 and 0.685, p&lt;0.01). 

However, all the monitored sites showed peak flow increases with increasing rainfall 

depth (ESAC: 0.952, Porto Bordalo: 0.879, Espírito Santo: 0.994 and Quinta: 0.903, 

p&lt;0.01) and rainfall intensity, with slightly stronger correlations with maximum 15 

minutes than hourly intensities (ESAC: 0.745 vs 0.685, p&lt;0.05; Porto Bordalo: 0.855 vs 

0.830, p&lt;0.01; Espírito Santo: 0.720 vs 0.665, p&lt;0.05; and Quinta: 0.842 vs 0.733, 

p&lt;0.01). 

 

 

Figure 6.2 - Variation of runoff depth (base and storm component) and runoff coefficient at 

different monitoring sites, between sampling events (*larger event; **very large event). 

 

During monitored rainfall events, Espírito Santo, which encompasses the largest 

impervious surface cover (27%), exhibited greatest median runoff coefficient (13.8%). 

However, Quinta with the smallest impervious cover (5% of the drainage area) exhibited 

a greater median runoff coefficient (8.0%) than ESAC (7.4% runoff coefficient and 20% 

imperviousness) and Porto Bordalo (6.6% runoff coefficient and 15% impervious cover). 

This is thought to be a consequence of the greatest baseflow component in Quinta (73%). 

Despite the median runoff coefficient in ESAC being lower than Espírito Santo, it reached 

31% of the rainfall for the 25/03/2013, which may be linked to the greatest overland flow

connectivity at the end of the wet season, given the similar baseflow contribution (84% 

of the streamflow in both gauging stations). 

Generally, during monitoring rainfall events, streamflow within sandstone areas was 

dominated by baseflow, which represented, in median, 75% of Quinta flow, 69% of 

Espírito Santo and 62% of ESAC discharge (Figure 6.2). In Porto Bordalo, overlaying 

limestone, median baseflow did not surpass 24% of the streamflow during the storm 

events, highlighting the relevance of storm flow on stream discharge. Besides the low 

baseflow in the limestone area, the partial piping of the urban storm runoff to the Porto 

Bordalo stream may contribute to its greatest storm flow.   

Baseflow amount follows a seasonal pattern (Figure 6.2), with lowest values observed 

after summer seasons (23/10/2011, 26/10/2011 and 25/09/2012) and greater values in the 

late wet season (15/01/2013 and 25/03/2013).

Physical-chemical parameters 

Water samples exhibited pH largely in the slightly acidic and lightly alkaline range (6.0-

8.0), with few samples attaining stronger alkali characteristics (not surpassing 9.0). Porto 

Bordalo displayed the highest pH (median of 7.6), statistically different from the lower 

values observed in ESAC (median of 7.1, p&lt;0.05). In Espírito Santo and Quinta, median 

pH were 7.3 and 7.4 (Figure 6.3). Over the study period, pH showed a tendency to 

decrease through the wet season.

represent median values of all the results over the study period. 

 

Electrical conductivity showed a wide range of values (32 – 991 µS cm-1), associated with 

high heterogeneity between samples collected in same locations, particularly in autumn 

and spring rainfall events (Figure 6.4). Distinct distribution of EC values were found 

between the four study sites (p&lt;0.05), however, only marginal median EC increase was 

observed from Porto Bordalo (160 µS cm-1), to Quinta (182 µS cm-1), ESAC (297 µS cm-

1) and Espírito Santo (318 µS cm-1).

Figure 6.4 - Temporal variability of electrical conductivity between the four study sites. Dashed 

lines represent median values of all the results over the study period. 

 

Temporal variability of EC was identified (p&lt;0.05), with distinct results during 

02/11/2011, 14/11/2011 and 04/05/2012 water sampling. During this measurments, 

median values between sites ranged from 117-416 µS cm-1 to 296-830 µS cm-1. These 

rainfall events were characterized by a mix of greater rainfall intensity and antecedent 

precipitation in previous days (Table 6.2). Nevertheless, EC exhibited significant positive 

correlations particularly with TDS and TS (r=0.816, 0.397, p&lt;0.01), as well as NO2+NO3, 

Na, Mg and Ca (r=0.461, 0.367, 0.639, 0.681, p&lt;0.01) (Table 6.3).

Total dissolved solids exhibited the same spatio-temporal pattern as EC (r=0.829, 

p&lt;0.01), despite the slightly higher values in ESAC than Espírito Santo. Median values 

increased from Porto Bordalo (76.4 mg L-1), to Quinta, (109.4 mg L-1), Espírito Santo 

(163.6 mg L-1) and ESAC (174.6 mg L-1) (results not shown). Maximum values ranged 

between 401.0 mg L-1 and 758.0 mg L-1 within the four study sites.  

Turbidity displayed a different spatial pattern than pH, EC and TDS, with greatest values 

in Quinta surface water (p&lt;0.05). Over the study period, median turbidity values in 

Quinta (134 FTU), were almost twice higher than in ESAC (79 FTU), and about four 

times the amount found in Espírito Santo and Porto Bordalo (38 FTU and 33 FTU, 

correspondingly) (Figure 6.5). Surface water quality showed significant turbidity 

increases during 02/11/2011 and 14/11/2011 measurements (p&gt;0.05). Nevertheless, 

during these rainfall events, differences in maximum turbidity were not so large between 

Quinta and ESAC (1548 FTU and 1127 FTU), but were clearly distinct from Espírito 

Santo and Porto Bordalo (313 FTU and 493 FTU).  

 

 

 

Figure 6.5 - Temporal variability of turbidity between the four study sites. Dashed lines 

represent median values of all the results over the study period. 

 

Greater TS concentrations were observed in ESAC and Quinta surface water (75% of the 

samples ranged between 200-470 mg L-1 and 113-456 mg L-1, respectively), opposing to 

Espírito Santo and Porto Bordalo (183-292 mg L-1 and 47-209 mg L-1, p&lt;0.05) (Figure 

6.6). Although water samples from ESAC displayed generally higher TS concentrations

ADP (02/11/2011 and 14/11/2011), were reached in Quinta, and exceed twice higher the 

maximum concentrations in ESAC (4320 mg L-1 vs 1656 mg L-1). Nevertheless, even 

under these rainfall conditions, TS concentrations did not surpass 852 mg L-1 and 598 mg 

L-1 in Espírito Santo and Porto Bordalo, correspondingly.    

 

    

Figure 6.6 – Temporal variability of total solids between the four study sites. Dashed lines 

represent median values of all the results over the study period. 

 

Total solids followed similar temporal pattern as observed for turbidity and both showed 

greater values with peak flows. However, general TS increases were also noticed in 

25/09/2012, representing one of the first rainfall events after the dry summer. In fact, this 

rainfall event triggered the beginning of streamflow in Espírito Santo and Quinta, which 

exhibited some of the highest concentrations during this sampling event, measured at the 

beginning of the flow and not following discharge variation as generally observed. Within 

Porto Bordalo, despite the relatively constant TS over the study period, and contrary to 

the measurements performed in the other study sites, high concentrations were quantified 

during 14/11/2011. This is linked with urbanization works performed nearby the sampling 

site regarding to a dich opening on the soil surface. 

Total solids concentration was significantly correlated with turbidity (r=0.573, p&lt;0.01). 

Concentrations of TS and TDS increased with increasing stream discharge (total flow and 

storm component), despite the week correlations, particularly with TS (TS: r=0.313 and 

0.205, TDS: r=0.408 and 0.381, for total flow and storm component, p&lt;0.01) (Table 6.3).

Opposing to the previous physical-chemical parameters, COD in dissolved phase was 

greater in Espírito Santo (median values of 17.8 mg L-1), followed by ESAC (13.0 mg L-

1) and Porto Bordalo (12.0 mg L-1), with lowest concentrations in Quinta (9.5 mg L-1, 

demonstrating significant differences to the other study sites, p&lt;0.05) (Figure 6.7). 

Nevertheless, over the study period, the highest concentrations were attained in ESAC 

and Porto Bordalo (56.0 mg L-1 and 83.5 mg L-1). Temporal pattern of COD displayed a 

lower surface water quality immediately after driest settings (23/10/2011 and 25/09/2013) 

(p&lt;0.05) and decreasing concentrations through the wet periods. Generaly, highest 

concentrations were measured in baseflow during rainfall events after the summer, but 

with peak flow in winter storms. COD increased significantly with NO2+NO3 

concentrations (r=0.409, p&lt;0.01).

Nutrients 

Kjeldhal nitrogen in dissolved phase did not show significant differences between study 

sites (p&gt;0.05), but  a minor decrease in median concentrations from downstream to 

upstream monitoring locations was observed (1.34 mg L-1 in ESAC, 1.31 mg L-1 in Porto 

Bordalo, 1.22 mg L-1 in Espírito Santo and 1.20 mg L-1 in Quinta) (Figure 6.8). Similarly 

to Nk, NH4 concentrations were slightly higher in ESAC (median values over the study 

period of  0.41 mg L-1), but minor decreases were displayed from Quinta to Porto Bordalo 

and Espírito Santo (0.36 mg L-1, 0.32 mg L-1 and 0.26 mg L-1, respectively).

Figure 6.8  Temporal variability of Kjeldhal nitrogen between the four study sites. Dashed lines 

represent median values of all the results over the study period. 

 

Both Nk and NH4 compounds presented the same temporal pattern (only shown for Nk, 

Figure 6.8). In ESAC and Porto Bordalo, the temporal pattern was analogous to COD 

concentrations, with great concentrations in dry periods (in late summer – 25/09/2012, 

and in rainfall events after several days without rainfall - 23/10/2011 and 08/10/2013, 

both with API7=0.0 mm), decreasing values through wet seasons (lowest values in 

14/11/2011, with the largest API14), and increasing in late spring (04/05/2012). On the 

other hand, Espírito Santo and Quinta seemed to show increasing Nk and NH4 over the 

wet season, with the highest values measured in 15/01/2013 (2.5 mg L-1 and 2.8 mg L-1, 

measured at the beginning of flow increase in Espírito Santo and immediately after peak 

flow in Quinta).  

Generally, NH4 represented a small fraction of the Nk: 31% in ESAC, 30% in Quinta, 

25% in Porto Bordalo and 21% in Espírito Santo (Figure 6.9). Significant positive 

correlation was found between both nitrogen forms (r=0.476, p&lt;0.01). Over the study 

period, nitrogen was mostly in organic form in Quinta surface water, based on lower 

NO2+NO3 than Nk concentrations, and considering the small percentage of NH4. In Porto 

Bordalo and ESAC, median concentrations of NO2+NO3 were also lower than Nk, but 

with minor differences than observed in Quinta. Contrary to these sites, in Espírito Santo 

NO2+NO3 was the most dominant nitrogen form in surface water.

Figure 6.9  Variation of different nitrogen forms concentration (Kjeldhal, ammonium and 

nitrogen oxide) in the four study sites, considering all the stream values measured during the ten 

storm events monitored. 

 

Generally low NO2+NO3 concentrations were found within the four study sites (Figure 

6.10), but minor contribution of NO2 is expected, given the usual oxidative conditions. 

Nitrates displayed the same spatial pattern as COD, with dissolved concentrations 

decreasing from Espírito Santo (1.46 mg L-1), to ESAC (1.01 mg L-1), Porto Bordalo (0.62 

mg L-1) and Quinta (0.35 mg L-1) (Figure 6.10).

Higher concentrations of NO2+NO3 were observed in ESAC, Espírito Santo and Quinta 

after the summer, particularly during the 25/09/2012 rainfall event, where few samples 

reached 6-14 mg L-1 (immediately after the peak flow), but after few rainless days during 

the wet season in Porto Bordalo (08/01/2013, with API7=0.0 mm), with peak 

concentrations attaining 19 mg L-1 with peak flow. In Quinta and Porto Bordalo, after the 

greatest NO2+NO3 concentrations were reached, a considerable decrease was observed in 

the subsequent rainfall events, demonstrating a distinct temporal pattern than Nk and 

NH4. Nitrates concentration was positively correlated with COD (r=0.409, p&lt;0.01). 

Generaly, COD and nitrogen compounds did not correlate significantly with streamflow 

parameters (p&gt;0.05).  

Total phosphorus in dissolved phase was mostly lower than 0.10 mg L-1, with greater 

concentrations in Porto Bordalo and ESAC (median values of 0.07 mg L-1 in both sites) 

than in Espírito Santo and Quinta (0.06 mg L-1 and 0.05 mg L-1) (p&lt;0.05) (Figure 6.11). 

During the study period, peak concentrations of TP attained 0.39 mg L-1 in ESAC, 0.30 

mg L-1 in Porto Bordalo, 0.17 mg L-1 in Espírito Santo and 0.14 mg L-1 in Quinta, mostly 

at peak flows. The highest concentrations were observed not only in driest settings 

(23/10/1011, 04/05/2012 and 25/09/2012), but also during wet seasons, after few days 

without rainfall (08/01/2013). The temporal variability of TP is similar to COD and alike 

Nk and NH4. Nevertheless, significant correlation was only identified between TP and 

Nk (r=489, p&lt;0.01).

Major cations 

Dissolved concentrations of Na, K, Ca and Mg exhibited significant differences between 

study catchment sites (p&lt;0.05), but varying with the chemical element. Nevertheless, 

Espírito Santo surface water showed greater concentrations for all the cations. 

Sodium displayed lowest concentrations in Porto Bordalo (median values of 5.7 mg L-1) 

(p&lt;0.05), less than half that recorded in Espírito Santo (18.6 mg L-1) (Figure 6.12). Quinta 

only showed slightly lower Na concentrations comparing with ESAC (11.9 mg L-1 and 

14.7 mg L-1) (p&gt;0.05). The temporal pattern of Na displayed a tendency for lower values 

in rainfall events after driest periods (23/10/2011 and 25/09/2012), and increasing 

concentrations through the wet season, particularly in Espírito Santo and Quinta (attained 

34.7 mg L-1 in 04/05/2012 and 33.1 mg L-1 in 25/03/2013, immediately after the peak 

flow). This temporal pattern is opposite to the pattern observed for COD and nutrients 

concentrations. However, Porto Bordalo exibited the highest Na concentrations in 

25/09/2012, different from the other study sites.  

 

 

   

Figure 6.12  – Temporal variability of dissolved sodium concentrations between the four study 

sites. Dashed lines represent median values of all the results over the study period. 

 

Surface water from Porto Bordalo displayed lowest Ca (median values of 19.8 mg L-1), 

followed by Quinta study site (22.6 mg L-1), similar to Na measurements (Figure 6.13). 

No significant difference was observed between Ca concentrations in Espírito Santo and 

ESAC (p&gt;0.05), which showed the greatest median values within Ribeira dos Covões

(30.9 mg L-1 and 34.4 mg L-1). Calcium did not exhibit significant variability between 

measurement dates (p&gt;0.05), as observed with Mg (Figure 6.14). Furthermore, Mg in 

surface water displayed similar spatial pattern as Ca, despite the significant highest 

median concentration in Espírito Santo (10.4 mg L-1) (p&lt;0.05). The lowest Mg 

concentrations were also measured in Porto Bordalo surface water (2.3 mg L-1).

October 2011 and March 2013. 

 

 

Figure 6.14 – Temporal variability of dissolved magnesium concentrations between the four 

study sites. Dashed lines represent median values of the ten measurement dates. 

 

The spatial pattern of K was similar to Mg, with concentrations in surface water 

decreasing from Espírito Santo (6.1 mg L-1) and ESAC (5.5 mg L-1), but with slightly 

higher concentrations in Porto Bordalo (4.9 mg L-1) than Quinta (3.1 mg L-1) (Figure 

6.15). The temporal pattern of K was analogous to the variation observed for Na, which 

demonstrated an increasing concentration tendency over the wet season, particularly in 

ESAC and Porto Bordalo. Generally, major cations attained the highest concentrations 

under baseflow conditions, but also under peak flows in later winter storms (results not 

shown).

Figure 6.15 – Temporal variability of dissolved potassium concentrations between the four 

study sites. Dashed lines represent median values of all the results over the study period. 

 

Surface water concentrations of Na, K, Ca and Mg were positively correlated between 

each other (p&lt;0.01), but with stronger correlations among Ca and Mg (r=0.779). 

Streamflow regime did not show a great impact on major cations concentrations, given 

the very week negative correlations with storm flow component, although significant 

(p&lt;0.01) (Table 6.3). Major cations established significant correlations with EC (r=-

0.639, -0.681, -0.295 and -0.367, for Mg, Ca, K and Na, p&lt;0.01). 

 

Metals 

Dissolved Fe showed a spatial and temporal pattern distinct from the other water quality 

parameters. Throughout the ten rainfall events, Espírito Santo exhibited the highest Fe 

concentrations (median values of 0.366 mg L-1), whereas the lowest median value was 

observed in ESAC (0.302 mg L-1) (Figure 6.16). Quinta surface water displayed distinct 

Fe concentrations comparing with the other study sites (p&lt;0.05), marked by greatest 

heterogeneity within the same rainfall events and highest maximum concentrations (2.25 

mg L-1), largely noticed during the initial five water sampling dates. In general, surface 

water displayed decreasing Fe concentrations over the study period.

Dashed lines represent median values of all the results over the study period. 

 

Within Ribeira dos Covões surface water, median Zn concentrations were similarly low 

at all study sites (p&gt;0.05), varying only from 0.118 mg L-1 in Espírito Santo, to 0.128 mg 

L-1 in Quinta, 0.157 mg L-1  in Porto Bordalo and 0.165 mg L-1  in ESAC (Figure 6.17).  

However, it was in ESAC that Zn reached the highest concentrations (0.91 mg L-1). Zn 

varied in opposite fashion to Fe, with distinctively higher concentrations in rainfall events 

observed after the summer season (25/09/2013) and in late winter season (08/01/2013 and 

15/01/2013) (p&lt;0.05).

Figure 6.17 – Temporal variability of dissolved zinc concentrations at the four study sites. 

Dashed lines represent median values of all the results over the study period. 

 

Most of the heavy metals investigated in the dissolved phase were below detection limits. 

Cadmium exceeded the detection limit (0.031 mg L-1) on only one occasion at ESAC, 

which attained 0.050 mg L-1 during the hydrograph rising limb of 15/01/2013 (results not 

shown).  

Cupper also rarely exceeded the detection limit (0.068 mg L-1) at the study sites, 

representing 9% of Espírito Santo and ESAC water samples, 7% in Porto Bordalo and 

5% in Quinta (results not shown). These quantifiable concentrations of Cu were largely 

observed during 15/01/2013 rainfall event, reaching 0.174 mg L-1 in ESAC, 0.102 mg L-

1 in Porto Bordalo, 0.219 mg L-1 in Espírito Santo and 0.094 mg L-1 in Quinta (linked 

with greater discharges).  

Manganese exceeded the detection limit (0.048 mg L-1) more frequently than Cu:  33% 

of ESAC water samples, 31% in Quinta, 18% of Espírito Santo and 5% in Porto Bordalo 

(results not shown). The majority of these high values were attained during the rising limb 

of storms observed after the summer (26/10/2011 and 25/09/2012), but also at peak flows 

in late winter (especially during 15/01/2013 and 25/03/2013). Maximum Mn values were 

0.867 mg L-1 in ESAC, 0.400 mg L-1 in Porto Bordalo, 0.150 mg L-1 in Espírito Santo 

and 0.148 mg L-1 in Quinta. Water samples collected at the four sites did not show 

significant differences (p&gt;0.05).

6.4.2.2. Compliance with Portuguese water quality guidelines 

According with the Portuguese guidelines (Environmental Ministry, 1998) for minimum 

surface water quality, pH (5.0-9.0) and total phosphorus (1 mg L-1) did not represent 

problems for aquatic ecosystems within Ribeira dos Covões. However, nitrogen and a 

few heavy metals occasionally threatened surface water quality in all the study sites.  

The minimum water quality threshold of Nk (2 mg L-1) exceeded in 15% of the Porto 

Bordalo water samples, 9% in Quinta and 7% in ESAC and Espírito Santo. Problems 

linked to high concentrations of Nk were largely observed on 25/09/2012, 08/01/2013 

and 15/01/2013 (Figure 6.10). Some of these high Nk concentrations found in ESAC and 

Porto Bordalo, were identified in baseflow samples, before rainfall start, but also during 

the falling limb of the hydrograph. Ammonium standards (1 mg L-1) were surpassed in 

8% of ESAC surface water samples, 3% in Porto Bordalo and 2% in Espírito Santo. The 

highest NH4 concentrations were linked to Nk maxima.    

Cadmium standard (0.01 mg L-1) was surpassed in the only quantifiable sample over the 

study period, which was collected in ESAC, during the 15/01/2013 rainfall event (raising 

limb). At this time, ESAC also exceeded Cu water quality standards (0.1 mg L-1) in two 

samples. Furthermore, Cu concentration also exceeded the threshold in 2% of the Espírito 

Santo samples, on 25/03/2013 (during peak flow). Dissolved Zn concentrations also 

surpassed minimum surface water quality guidelines (0.5 mg L-1) in 11% of ESAC water 

samples and 3% in both Porto Bordalo and Quinta, not only on 25/09/2012 (rising limb) 

but also in the 15/01/2013 (peak flow and recession limb) storm events.   

In the four study sites, recorded values always complied with recommended surface water 

quality guidelines for irrigation purposes for NO3 (RMV=50 mg L
-1), Fe (RMV=5.0 mg 

L-1), Zn (RMV=2.0 mg L-1 and MAV= 10.0 mg L-1), and SAR parameter (RMV=8 meq 

L-1). Maximum values of SAR attained 3 meq L-1 in Quinta and 2 meq L-1 in ESAC, Porto 

Bordalo and Espírito Santo, over the study period (results not shown). The MRV for TDS 

(640 mg L-1) was exceeded on only one sample collected at ESAC, near the peak flow on 

late winter (15/01/2013).  

Surface water quality displayed some limitations for irrigation purposes, associated with 

greatest Cu, Mn and pH values, above the recommended guidelines in some samples. 

Maximum recommended values of Cu (0.2 mg L-1) were exceeded in 2% of Espírito 

Santo water samples, during 25/03/2013 (same samples which exceeded the minimum 

water quality standards). Manganese was surpassed in 4% and 1% of the ESAC and Porto 

Bordalo water samples (MRV=0.20 mg L-1), due to great concentrations on 25/09/2012 

(measured during the rising limb of the hydrographs). In Porto Bordalo, pH was at MRV 

(4.5-9.0) limit in 3% of the analyses (rising limb of 02/11/2010 rainfall event). 

Nevertheless, in all of these MRV exceedance, the maximum admissible standards 

(VMA) were always accomplished (Cu: 5.0 mg L-1, Mn: 10 mg L-1 and pH: 4.5-9.0).

CHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION

198 

The high detection limit of the analytical method used for Cd quantification (0.031 mg L-

1), did not allow conclusions concerning to the water quality for irrigation practices 

(RMV=0.01 mg L-1 and MAV= 0.05 mg L-1). 

 

6.4.2.3. Variation of median concentrations and specific loads per event 

Spatial and temporal differences in surface water quality were presented previously, in 

section 6.4.2.1., but event median concentrations are now summarized (Table 6.4). A 

wide range of differences were found according with the water quality parameter, as 

indicated by great standard deviation values. Marked differences were particularly 

observed in EC and turbidity, with standard deviation greater than mean values. On the 

other hand, major cations were the chemical elements analysed which displayed lower 

variability between rainfall events.

LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

201 

Generally, based in all the rainfall events sampled, water quality at the catchment outlet 

(ESAC) demonstrated higher event median concentration of TS (marginally higher than 

in Quinta) and Ca (slightly greater than in Espírito Santo), as well as a bit higher 

concentrations  of Nk and NH4 (Table 6.4). Porto Bordalo, overlying limestone, displayed 

greater median values of pH and TP (both slightly higher than ESAC), and somewhat 

greater concentrations of Zn, but lowest results of Na. In turn, with similar land-use but 

overlaying sandstone, Espírito Santo exhibited greatest median concentrations of EC, 

COD, NO2+NO3, Na, Mg, K and Fe. On the other hand, within the sandstone drainage 

area, partially under construction, Quinta demonstrated the highest median 

concentrations of turbidity and Fe, but the lowest concentrations of COD.  

The spatial differences on surface water quality can be partially explained by the 

biophysical characteristics of the study sites. Lithology displayed significant correlations, 

with median TS (increased on sandstone, but decreased with limestone, p&lt;0.05) and Mg 

median concentrations (decreased with limestone, p&lt;0.05), despite de very week 

correlation with the latter (Table 6.5). Land-use seems to play an important role on surface 

water quality, with percentage woodland significantly correlated with lower medians of 

EC, NO2+NO3 and major cations (Na, Mg, Ca and K) (at least at p&lt;0.05) (Table 6.6). 

Despite the smaller agricultural fields (including sandstone and limestone), this land-use 

demonstrated positive significant correlations with TS (p&lt;0.05), although rather week 

coefficient. Within urban areas, decreases in TS were significantly correlated with 

increasing % pervious surfaces, such as gardens (p&lt;0.01). On the other hand, percentage 

impervious surfaces, linked to roads and buildings cover, was positively correlated with 

EC (p&lt;0.05), NO2+NO3 as well as major cations (Na, Mg, Ca and K) (p&lt;0.01).

CHAPTER 6 – ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER 

CHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION 

TO RAINFALL EVENTS 

 

204 

Median concentrations per rainfall event were significantly affected by rainfall and 

streamflow patterns (Table 6.5). Increasing rainfall depth lead to significant increases of 

Zn (p&lt;0.05), but decreases in Fe (p&lt;0.05). Rainfall duration showed positive correlations 

with TP, Nk and Zn (p&lt;0.01), but also negative correlations with pH (p&lt;0.05). 

Furthermore, greater mean rainfall intensity reduced TP and Nk (p&lt;0.01). Nonetheless, 

greater maximum rainfall intensity (I60) lessened median EC (p&lt;0.01) and Fe values 

(p&lt;0.05). Antecedent rainfall also demonstrated some influence on surface water quality 

during rainfall events, displayed by the positive correlations between API7 and pH 

(p&lt;0.05) and negative correlations with median concentrations of NH4 (p&lt;0.01). Apart 

from pH, API14 was also negatively correlated with Nk and TP (p&lt;0.01). 

Cumulative values of streamflow per storm event also influenced median concentration 

values. Iron decreased significantly with increasing total flow, cumulative storm flow and 

peak flow (p&lt;0.05). But increasing storm flow favoured median Zn concentrations 

(p&lt;0.05). However, when all the water samples were considered together with the 

instantaneous discharge, total and storm flow only led to turbidity increases, as presented 

on section 6.4.2.1.. Furthermore, cumulative baseflow per storm event provided 

significant increases in median Mg and Ca concentrations (p&lt;0.05), but decreases on pH 

(p&lt;0.05) (Table 6.5).   

Since ESAC represents the largest drainage area, including the upstream sub-catchments, 

it showed the greatest loads (Table 6.6), but not the highest specific loads (Table 6.7). 

Generally, over the study period, Espírito Santo, with smaller drainage area and larger 

urban land-use, demonstrated the higher specific loads of all the parameters quantified, 

except TS, which was greater in Quinta sub-catchment, encompassing the enterprise park 

construction site. Quinta also displayed the second larger mean of NH4 and Fe loads, 

whereas for all the other water chemical parameters (except NO2+NO3 and Mg) the 

second higher specific loads were found in ESAC. The lowest loads per unit area were 

perceived in Quinta (TP, NO2+NO3, Mg, Ca, K and Zn) and Porto Bordalo (TS, Nk, 

NH4, COD, Na and Fe). These spatial variation of specific loads between study sites did 

not follow the same order as observed for median concentrations, previously reported on 

section 6.4.2.1..

CHAPTER 6 – ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER 

CHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION 

TO RAINFALL EVENTS

Specific loads per rainfall event did not show the same correlations with the biophysical 

characteristics of the study sites as observed with median concentrations, particularly 

regarding to major cations. In terms of correlations with land-use, SEL of NO2+NO3 and 

Mg decreased with % woodland (p&lt;0.01), but increased with % urban areas, particularly 

impervious surface extent (p&lt;0.01) (Table 6.8). Within urban land-use, pervious areas did 

not show correlations with surface water quality. As regards to lithology, SEL of Na 

increased significantly with higher % sandstone (p&lt;0.05), despite the week correlation, 

but decreased with % limestone (p&lt;0.01).  

Hydrological data demonstrated to be a major parameter influencing specific loads of 

surface water quality parameters (Table 6.8). During storm events, rainfall pattern, 

particularly rainfall amount and duration, showed strong correlations with all specific 

loads (p&lt;0.01). Increasing I15 and I60 also leaded to higher SEL, except for NO2+NO3 and 

Na. However, API did not seem to influence specific loads of water quality parameters. 

Discharge properties (total flow, including storm and baseflow components, as well as 

runoff coefficients per event) significantly correlate with all specific loads (p&lt;0.01). Peak 

discharge revealed lower correlation coefficients than total discharge properties, and it 

did not seem to influence NO2+NO3, COD, Na, Mg and Fe specific loads (p&gt;0.05). 

A positive linear correlation between event streamflow and SELs (Figure 6.18) highlight 

the relevance of stream discharge. ESAC no longer showed higher specific loads, but 

contrary, displayed the smallest SELs within Ribeira dos Covões, linked to the lowest 

regression lines (Figure 6.18). Despite the generally higher SELs in Espírito Santo, Porto 

Bordalo showed greatest increases with discharge as regards to TP, Mg, K and Zn loads. 

In turn, Quinta displayed the highest regression line of NH4.

LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

213 

6.5. Discussion 

6.5.1. Spatial variation of surface water quality 

6.5.1.1. Land-use impacts 

The four study sites, characterized by different land-uses, revealed dissimilar surface 

water quality, although some chemical elements, such as EC, Nk, NO2+NO3 and heavy 

metals, did not show significant spatial variations. Despite the general acceptable water 

quality across Ribeira dos Covões, ocassional pollutant levels were achieved in all the 

measured sites, as regards to nitrogen and few heavy metals. Kjeldhal nitrogen achieved 

pollutant levels in few samples of all the study sites (maximum concentrations over the 

study period reached 2.5 mg L-1 in Espírito Santo and Porto Bordalo, 2.6 mg L-1 in ESAC 

and 2.8 mg L-1 in Quinta, when the standard is 2.0 mg L-1). Pollutant levels of NH4 (&gt;1.0 

mg L-1) were also attained in few samples of ESAC and Espírito Santo (maximum values 

of 1.6 mg L-1 and 1.5 mg L-1), with slightly exceedance of the quality standards in Porto 

Bordalo (1.1 mg L-1). Few measurements of Zn revealed marginal pollutant 

concentrations (0.5 mg L-1) in ESAC (maximum of 0.8 mg L-1), as well as Quinta and 

Porto Bordalo (maximum of 0.6 mg L-1 in both sites). In Espírito Santo, there was one 

sample showing Cu concentrations twice higher than the minimum water quality standard 

(maximum of 0.2 mg L-1), but in ESAC, Cd concentration exceeded five times the 

pollutant levels in one occasion (0.05 mg L-1).   

Within urban land-uses, impervious surfaces are usually associated with decreasing 

surface water quality. Considering the water quality of the four study sites, median event 

loads of EC, COD, NO2+NO3, Mg, Ca and K displayed a linear association with 

increasing TIA (Figure 6.19), despite the correlations were only statistical significant as 

regards to NO2+NO3 and Mg. Sodium also showed this tendency if results from Quinta 

are not considered, possibly due to partial disturbance caused by construction works in 

10% of the contributing area. 

 

 

 



CHAPTER 6 – ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER 

CHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION 

TO RAINFALL EVENTS 

 

214 

   

  

Figure 6.19 - Relationship between mean event load and total impervious area for the four study 

sites within Ribeira dos Covões. 

 

Numerous studies have reported the impact of urban land-use on surface water quality 

degradation (Vander Laan et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2014). However, in Shanghai, China, 

Wang et al. (2008) demonstrated that despite there being a direct relationship between 

urbanization level and the degree of water degradation, this relationship takes the form of 

an inverted U-shaped curve, steeper in urban than suburban areas, linked with the 

economic development. After urbanization establishment, environmental concerns start 

to rise in economically developed cities, leading to increasing investment in pollution 

prevention, particularly, water quality protection.    

Despite pollutant concentrations are of utmost importance for ecosystems status, they are 

highly variable during inter- and intra-storm events, representing environmental risk 

during short periods of time (in few samples), according with Ribeira dos Covões results. 

Because of the highly variable concentrations of water quality parameters, pollutant loads 

can be an interesting parameter to consider the longer term impacts on ecossystems. There 

can be high concentrations of pollutants, but if the discharge is low, there would only be 

a small quantity of pollutant transported, thus having minor environmental impact 

comparing with lower concentrations associated with higher flows. Considering the 

significant increases of most water quality parameters with increasing drainage area, 

normalized pollutant loads were considered the most appropriate to assess differences 

between the study sites.

LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

215 

In Ribeira dos Covões, despite the general increase of specific loads with urban extent, 

except for TS, linear relationships were only observed for TP, NO2+NO3, Ca and Mg 

(Figure 6.20).  

 

 

Figure 6.20 – Mean specific event load over the ten sampling periods and percentage urban 

area, for quantifiable water quality parameters. 

 

Espírito Santo, with the largest urban land-use (49% of the drainage area and 27% 

impervious surface cover), displayed the highest specific event loads of COD, Nk, 

NO2+NO3, Na, K, Fe and Cu. Porto Bordalo, with minor urban areas and imperviousness 

(42% and 15%, respectively) recorded higher event loads of TP, Mg, Ca and Zn. Quinta, 

with the lowest urban extent (25% of the area and 5% impervious surfaces), but with 10% 

of the drainage area under construction phase, displayed greatest loads of TS and NH4. 

ESAC, representing the entire Ribeira dos Covões catchment, with 40% urban extent and 

20% urban impervious surface, showed the lowest specific pollutant loads. 

 

Organic and nutrient pollutants 

Chemical oxygen demand displayed significant lower concentrations within Quinta

TO RAINFALL EVENTS

loads from urban areas were also reported by previous authors (e.g. Wilbers et al., 2014). 

However, according to Shields et al. (2008), urbanized catchments export more nitrogen 

at higher but less frequent flows than catchment dominated by woodland, agricultural and 

low-density suburban areas. In fact, in Ribeira dos Covões, highest nutrients 

concentration were measured with peak flow in winter storms, but also under summer 

baseflow conditions due to lower dilution effect. 

In a previous study performed to assess surface water quality in Ribeira dos Covões, 

between 2004 and 2006, the relation BOD/COD in different stream channels was about 

0.1 (Ferreira, 2009). Assuming this relationship was constant over the time, despite the 

nearly 10% increase in the urban land-use, based on COD measurements, median BOD 

estimations per site (ESAC: 1.3 mg L-1; Porto Bordalo: 1.1 mg L-1; Espírito Santo: 1.8 

mg L-1; and Quinta: 1.0 mg L-1) did not indicate organic contamination. However, during 

great rainfall events observed in late summer (25/09/2012), BOD concentrations could 

have exceeded water quality standards (5 mg L-1, Environmental Ministry, 1998) in all 

the study sites (in 2% of Espírito Santo and Quinta samples, 3% and 8% of ESAC and 

Porto Bordalo, with maximum values of 6.3 mg L-1, 5.8 mg L-1, 5.6 mg L-1 and 6.2 mg 

L-1). 

In the urban land-uses, wastewater has been considered an important source of surface 

water contamination with COD and nutrients (Kaushal et al., 2011; Wilbers et al., 2014). 

In Ribeira dos Covões, contamination of surface water with untreated domestic 

wastewater was identified during field trips (through colour, aspect, and smell), possibly 

resulting from small leakages in the drainage system, but also large pipe ruptures. Such 

contamination was observed close to the catchment outlet, but also within Porto Bordalo, 

and can be related to the highest COD concentrations and higher median Nk 

concentrations observed in ESAC and Porto Bordalo water samples.          

Nevertheless, after Espírito Santo, the greatest COD and Nk loads considering event 

streamflow were recorded for the Quinta sub-catchment (Figure 6.18). Considering the 

smaller urban land-use and the existence of sewer drainage system, these results may 

indicate past soil contamination from an inactive wastewater treatment plant, which 

received domestic wastewater from upslope urban cores and spread it downstream 

without treatment. Possible leaching of contaminants can explain the increasing 

concentrations through the wet season, contrary to the observations at the other study 

sites, which exhibited greatest concentrations after the summer. However, high COD and 

Nk loads within Quinta could be also a consequence of extensive cattle rearing in the 

upslope agricultural fields, adjacent to the water channel and close to the sampling 

location. Surface water contamination by organic compounds in Quinta, was also 

indicated by relatively high median concentrations (0.36 mg L-1) and specific loads of 

NH4 (545 g km
-2). In USA, manure management problems regarding to agricultural 

practices have been considered a major problem for water quality, particularly during 

rainfall events, due to runoff impact on stream network (EPA, 2001). 



LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

217 

Despite the high NH4 loads recorded in Quinta, concentrations occasionally exceeded the 

water quality standards (1.0 mg L-1) at the other three catchment sites, with larger % urban 

land-use. High concentrations of NH4 can be toxic to aquatic organisms (Lin et al., 2014).  

As regards TP, higher concentrations were found in Porto Bordalo and ESAC (median 

values of 0.07 mg L-1 for both sites) than in Espírito Santo and Quinta (0.06 mg L-1 and 

0.04 mg L-1), and greates specific loads in Porto Bordalo (174 g km-2). Phosphorus in 

urban areas is usually associated with household sources, such as laundry and dishwasher 

detergents, as well as organic matter biodegradation in domestic wastewater (Mendes and 

Oliveira, 2004; Carey et al., 2013). In Porto Bordalo, pavement and car washes also may 

be linked with the higher TP loads. Nevertheless, greater TP concentrations in Porto 

Bordalo and ESAC, can be also related in part perhaps to the higher clay content of the 

limestone soils. The high loads of TS can partially involve suspended sediments from 

clay nature, since Porto Bordalo and ESAC overlay fully and partially limestone. The 

contribution of phosphorus in suspended sediments with clay nature was reported by Lin 

et al. (2014), as a result of adsorptive properties. Furthermore, the downslope location of 

ESAC can favour high TS loads and sediment deposition, based on field observations. 

According with Mendes and Oliveira (2004), higher concentration of TP are usually 

found in surface water of sedimentary areas, usually at lower altitude (Mendes and 

Oliveira, 2004).  

Within urban land-use, green areas, such as lawns and gardens, have been also recognised 

as an important source of nutrients, resulting from fertilization practices (Law et al., 2004; 

Carey et al., 2013). In Ribeira dos Covões, the higher NO2+NO3 concentrations were 

generally observed after the summer (23/10/2011 and 25/09/2012), possibly associated 

with lawns and gardens fertilization, mostly performed in spring and late summer. 

However, limited overland flow is usually generated in these pervious surfaces, leading 

to minor nutrient loads. The highest median NO2+NO3 concentrations in Espírito Santo 

(1.5 mg L-1) could be due to agricultural fertilizers. Although Espírito Santo has a small 

percentage agricultural land-use (5%), some of the fields are adjacent to the stream 

channel, and may establish a direct contribution of nutrients, particularly nitrate, into the 

surface water. However, both in agricultural fields and green surfaces of urban areas, 

impacts on surface water quality will depend on fertilizer management practices, such its 

timing, recycling grass clippings without adjusting fertilizer rates, irrigation practices, 

species variability and soil characteristics (e.g. Carey et al., 2013; Wilbers et al., 2014). 

Furthermore, specific loads of NO2+NO3 increased with % urban area (Figure 6.20), 

which may result from atmospheric deposition, given the greater values recorded after 

the summer.  

In Ribeira dos Covões, NO3 did not represent a constraints for irrigation use, since the 

recommended guidelines were not exceeded (Environmental Ministry, 1998). Similarly, 

TP at all the study sites fulfilled the standards for minimum surface water quality.

CHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION 

TO RAINFALL EVENTS 

 

218 

Phosphorus seems to be the limiting nutrient of aquatic ecosystems in the study 

catchment. Higher nutrient loads in surface water usually trigger eutrophication problems.   

Streamwater from woodland is usually associated with lower runoff and pollutant loads 

(Yu et al., 2014), which can explain the negative correlation between % of this land-use 

and median concentrations of EC and NO2+NO3. Furthermore, the negative correlation 

between % woodland and major cations concentrations (Na, Mg, Ca and K) may be due 

to greater infiltration and weathering (Table 6.5).  

 

Impervious surfaces and other potential sources of metals 

Automobile-related sources (e.g. fluids from parking lots, service stations, automobile 

exhaust, etc.) are important pollutant sources to runoff (Bannerman et al., 1993). Road 

runoff has been considered an important pollutant source within urban areas, partially due 

to greater runoff volumes, compared with other land-uses, and thus, increased pollutant 

loads (Ellis et al., 1986; Bannerman et al., 1993; Crabtree et al., 2006). Typical pollutants 

in highway runoff include TS, metals (As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Fe, Pb Hg, Ni and Zn), nutrients 

(NH4, NO3, Nk and TP), organic compounds (ex., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, oil 

and grease), oxygen demand (COD and BOD) and conventional parameters, such as pH, 

turbidity and conductivity hardness (Herrera, 2007). Road runoff therefore may also have 

contributed to greater COD and nutrient specif loads in Espírito Santo (68 kg COD km-2, 

4 kg Nk km-2, 1 kg NH4 km
-2 and 6 kg NO2+NO3 km

-2). Also the significant positive 

correlations between % impervious surfaces and SELs of Mg, Na and NO2+NO3 in 

Ribeira dos Covões may be linked to cement composition, which is largely represented 

by calcium oxide and silicon dioxide, with minor composition of aluminium and 

magnesium oxides, and several alkalis, such as sodium oxide and potassium oxide 

(Hellebois et al., 2013).   

Vehicular traffic is an important factor affecting pollutant loads, particularly heavy metals 

(Zhao et al., 2010; Soares, 2014; Yu et al., 2014). Most pollutants associated with vehicles 

originate from engine parts (Cu, Cr, Mn), lubricants (Zn and Ni), rusting (Fe), tire wear 

(Zn, Pb) and tire breaks (Cd) (Herrera, 2007). In the characterization of runoff highway 

performed by Ellis et al. (1986), decrease metal loadings were observed in the order Fe &gt; 

Mn &gt; Pb &gt; Zn &gt; Cu &gt; Cd which reflects the expected availability of these metals.  

In Ribeira dos Covões metal concentrations were not present at pollutant levels, but Zn, 

Cu and Cd occasionaly exceeded the minimum environmental guidelines, mostly at 

recession limb of later winter storms. Harmful concentrations of Zn were attained in 

ESAC, Porto Bordalo and Quinta, possibly due to contributions from road traffic 

separators, particularly placed nearby Porto Bordalo stream and downslope ESAC, 

covering a greater road extension than within the other sites. Possible Zn contaminations

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

219 

could also result from industrial activities, namely wood conservation in sawmill 

companies and pharmaceutic industry, found in the study catchment. Industrial activities 

have been also considered has a source of metals by previous authors (e.g. Naeemullah et 

al., 2014). 

Cupper concentration guidelines were exceeded in few samples of all the sites, whereas 

Cd was only measured in ESAC. Cupper exceeded the MRV guideline for irrigation 

purpose in Espírito Santo, whereas VRM of Mn were exceeded in few water samples of 

ESAC and Porto Bordalo. High concentrations of heavy metals in surface water may 

provide toxic effects when used for animals and cultures irrigation (Environment 

Ministry, 1986). Generally, there is not an apparent relation between heavy metals 

concentration and the urban extent, but the relatively high detection limit of the analytical 

methods used may be masking the metal loads and the urban impact of surface water 

quality.  

According with other authors (Yuan et al., 2013; Wilbers et al., 2014), the presence of 

heavy metals in urban environments were also associated with urban and industrial 

wastewater, particularly as a results of metal pipes corrosion. However, Sansalone et al. 

(2005) found that loadings of Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd were higher in urban stormwater than in 

untreated municipal wastewater in a city with a population of 800000. Cupper, Zn and 

Cd have been associated with farm lands as a result of animal manure and sewage sludge 

applications (Antonious et al., 2008). Few heavy metals such as Cu and Zn for instance, 

are also used as components of insecticides and fungicides (Mendes and Oliveira, 2004; 

Yu et al., 2014), leading to potential sources of surface water contamination, not only 

from agricultural fields, but also from the urban areas, due to lawns and gardens 

maintenance. Vander Laan et al. (2013) identified agriculture and urbanization as most 

likely sources of metal contaminations, and that they are one of the stressors of aquatic 

ecosystems degradation. Metals may be also provided by natural sources, since metallic 

agents that are made available and mobile via reduced conditions (Mendes and Oliveira, 

2014; Wilbers et al., 2014). Iron and Mn are present naturally in soil-derived sediments 

(Ellis et al., 1986).  

 

Bare soil 

Despite the catchment outlet (ESAC) displayed the highest TS concentrations (median 

values of 298 mg L-1), Quinta drainage area demonstrated slightly higher specific TS 

loads than Espírito Santo and ESAC (965 kg km-2, 937 kg km-2 and 804 kg km-2, 

respectively). The higher TS load and turbidity values in Quinta are mostly because of 

the enterprise construction site, which covers 10% of the drainage area, and encompasses 

a major area of bare soil, resulting from deforestation and initial construction phase. 

Runoff erosion within the construction site was active during field visits, with widespread 

rills and visible accumulation of sediments in the retention basin which received the

CHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION 

TO RAINFALL EVENTS 

 

220 

overland flow from this area (Figure 6.21). Nevertheless, within Quinta drainage area, 

there were additional bare soil sites associated with clear-felled woodland in upslope 

areas, which displayed signs of erosion. However, these sites do not seem to have a 

considerable impact on surface water TS or turbudity, since the overland flow from these 

areas tended to dissipate in downslope woodland areas, before reaching the stream 

network. On the other hand, overland flow from the enterprise park is routed to the 

retention basin, which then discharges to the stream channel, providing fewer 

opportunities for sediments to settle down, and thus, represents a major contribution to 

the Quinta TS load. 

 

             a)                                                       b)  

   

Figure 6.21 – (a) Rill erosion in the enterprise construction site  and (b) sediment accumulation 

within the retention basin. 

 

In contrast, woodland clear-felled seemed to enhance TS loads in Espírito Santo, 

particularly in the last event (Table 6.6). Also afforestation of fields nearby the stream 

channel led to substantial runoff erosion confirmed by field observations. Since the 

overland flow from these areas was generated near the stream channel, it could represent 

an important sediment load contribution, in contrast to upslope Quinta clear-felled areas. 

The impact of soil disturbance close to the stream network was also noted in Porto 

Bordalo during the 14/11/2011 rainfall event. At this time, there were roadworks (open 

ditch) a few metres above the sampling site, and despite the smaller area affected, its 

impact on surface water TS was very obvious and led to high TS concentrations, 

particularly at the beginning of rainfall event. This explains the higher median TS 

concentrations, as well as greater heterogeneity in the sampling records (Figure 6.6).  

Within urban land-uses, despite semi-pervious surfaces, such as unpaved parking sites, 

did not correlate with TS, other authors refer to them as potential sources of sediments 

due to great overland flow generation, since they behave like impermeable surfaces 

(Carey et al., 2013). Opposing, pervious surfaces within urban land-use over the 

catchment, associated with minor or even absent overland flow, showed significant 

negative correlations with TS concentrations, as well as turbidity (Table 6.5).       



LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

221 

In Ribeira dos Covões, TS can influence surface water quality, since it includes suspended 

sediment (SS) fraction, which can play an important role on environmental impacts due 

to its high adsorptive capacity and mobilization of pollutants, such as nutrients, 

particularly phosphorus (Atasoy et al, 2006; Carey et al., 2013) and heavy metals (Yu et 

al., 2014). Research has shown that due to their physical-chemical characteristics, the 

finer particulates are more efficient in the adsorption of pollutants and hence will carry a 

relatively higher pollutant concentration (Andral, 1999). Although much pollution is 

moving in dissolved form, increasing SS concentrations may lead to increasing pollutant 

loads (Goonetilleke et al., 2005). Furthermore, the presence of sediments in surface water 

increases turbidity and reduces the amount of light penetration, retarding photosynthesis 

and, as a consequence, decreasing the food supply available to aquatic life (Mendes and 

Oliveira, 2004).  

The relationship between TS and SS in Ribeira dos Covões streamwater was measured in 

a previous project, based on samples collected over two years (under baseflow conditions) 

in five sampling locations (Ferreira, 2009). Median values of SS/TS were 0.7 for Quinta 

streamwater and 0.1 in the other streams. Assuming this relationship was kept constant 

over the time, despite the urbanization and during storm events, median SS concentrations 

over the ten storm events monitored increased form Porto Bordalo to Espírito Santo, 

ESAC and Quinta: 14 mg L-1, 25 mg L-1, 30 mg L-1 and 180 mg L-1. In addition, maximum 

SS per storm event would range from 16-115 mg L-1 in Porto Bordalo, 25-85 mg L-1 in 

Espírito Santo, 29-166 mg L-1 in ESAC and 151-1680 mg L-1 in Quinta. These high 

concentrations within Quinta demonstrate the impact of construction site on surface water 

quality.  

Despite Portuguese legislation do not establish an environmental standard for suspended 

sediments, it considers a MRV of 60 mg L-1 for irrigation uses. Based on the SS 

estimations presented on previous paragraph, this guideline is largely exceeded in Quinta, 

as well as in the other study sites in few samples collected during greater storm events, as 

denoted by the significant positive correlation between turbidity and streamflow at the 

sampling time. High concentrations of SS in irrigation waters may lead to clogging of soil 

and siltation of irrigation networks, particularly blockage of irrigation drop by drop and 

sprinkler systems (Environment Ministry, 1998).  

 

6.5.1.2. Differences with lithology  

Some differences in surface water properties between study sites can be linked to 

lithology. Major cations vary with bedrock material and soil. Generally, Ca is more 

abundant in limestone than sandstone (380 g kg-1 vs 13 g kg-1), whereas the other major 

cations tend to be more profuse in sandstone than limestone (Mg: 7 g kg-1 vs 4 g kg-1, Na: 

17 g kg-1 vs 6 g kg-1, K: 11 g kg-1 vs 3 g kg-1) (Reimann and Caritat, 1998). 



CHAPTER 6 – ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER 

CHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION 

TO RAINFALL EVENTS 

 

222 

The Porto Bordalo sub-catchment, underlain by limestone, displayed low specific loads 

of Na and K (16 kg km-2 and 10 kg km-2), but high Ca and Mg loads (65 kg km-2 and 18 

kg km-2), despite not always distinctively different from sandstone-dominated Espírito 

Santo and Quinta sub-catchments, possibly due to different hydrological regimes. 

Nevertheless, a characterization study performed within Ribeira dos Covões, identified 

Ca and Mg concentrations at the soil surface (0-20 cm) over 13- and 2- times higher in 

limestone than sandstone (Pato, 2007). There was also a significant positive correlation 

between specific Mg loads and impervious surface within urban land-use, which can be 

linked with Porto Bordalo results. As mentioned before, although this catchment does 

not have the largest impervious cover, surface runoff reaching the stream channel is 

largely provided by the urban drainage system, which collects and pipes overland flow 

from urban areas (mostly roads but also roof runoff routed to the roads) close to the 

sampling site.  

Porto Bordalo displayed higher pH than in sandstone surface water. Previous studies in 

Ribeira dos Covões, also reported limestone soils exhibiting greater pH (~7.6) than 

sandstone (4.5-5.2) soils (Pato, 2007). Porto Bordalo surface water showed significant 

higher pH than ESAC, which is only partially overlying limestone (41%). This is possible 

due to the lower streamflow contribution from Porto Bordalo to the catchment outlet 

(23%) (Chapter 5). Nevertheless, surface water pH within Ribeira dos Covões was largely 

within neutral classification, and did not menace the environmental quality standards for 

surface water. However, the higher values measured in Porto Bordalo (during the 

recession limb of the small storm event of 26/10/2011 and the initial samples of 

02/11/2011), surpassed the recommended guidelines for irrigation uses. These slightly 

alkaline properties could have been associated with greatest Fe concentrations, indicative 

of older water mobilization, which had greater contact time with soil and that was not 

mobilized during storm events observed immediately after the long summer. However, 

Fe abundance in limestone is typically lower than sandstone soils (5 g kg-1 vs 10 g kg-1) 

(Reimann and Caritat, 1998).  

Occasionally, Zn attained pollutant concentrations (slightly higher than 0.5 mg L-1, 

Ministry of Environment, 1998) in Porto Bordalo and ESAC, fully or partially overlaying 

limestone, and in Quinta construction site. These highest concentrations of Zn were 

measured mainly under the falling limb of hydrograph (not shown), mostly in storm 

events after the summer, in the limestone dominated areas (25/09/2013). This high Zn 

concentrations could result from soil water accumulated during the summer which was 

easily mobilized with the first rainfall events after the dry period, since the presence of 

Zn in surface water may result from soil and rock leachate. Sandstone bedrock is usually 

associated with lower Zn proportions than limestone (20 mg kg-1 vs 40 mg kg-1). 

However, in Quinta, pollutant concentration levels were observed in late winter 

(15/01/2013) and could result from materials being used under the constructions site.  



LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

223 

Manganese concentrations were always very low within Ribeira dos Covões (&lt;0.1 mg L-

1), but showed slightly higher values in Porto Bordalo, followed by ESAC (maximum 

values of 0.4 mg L-1 and 0.2 mg L-1), which may indicate possible leachate from limestone 

areas. Limestone areas usually display higher Mn in its composition than sandstone 

(700 mg kg-1 vs 100 mg kg-1) (Reimann and Caritat, 1998). Nevertheless, these 

differences between sandstone and limestone could be rather a result of anthropogenic 

sources, namely road runoff, as mentioned in section 6.5.1.1. 

Total solids concentration significantly increased in sandstone but decreased in limestone 

areas. This is related to soil aggregation properties, which are lower under sandstone, and 

thus easily eroded, despite the higher infiltration capacity than in limestone. Stronger 

cohesion between limestone soil particles enhances the resistance to soil erosion.  

 

6.5.2. Temporal variation of surface water quality 

Surface water quality ranged over the study period, demonstrating opposing seasonal 

trends between some physical-chemical parameters (apart from Ca and Mg which did not 

reveal significant temporal differences between samplings). Many research studies have 

reported the influence of climate and hydrological variation, particularly of rainfall and 

flow discharge, on water quality (Meixner and Fenn, 2004; Brilly et al., 2006; Wilbers et 

al., 2014). 

Rainfall events monitored after the summer (23/10/2011 and 25/09/2012), recorded 

greater concentrations of COD, nutrients (Nk, NH4, NO2+NO3 and TP) and Mn, with 

general decreasing tendencies through the wet season. Some Nk and NH4 concentrations 

found during these rainfall events surpassed the minimum surface water quality standards. 

First rainfall events sampled after the summer also leaded to great TS concentrations, or 

at least higher standard deviations. The impact on TS concentrations was particularly 

noticed in Quinta and Espírito Santo, especially in 25/09/2012 since it represents the 

beginning of streamflow (first runoff) after the dry season.  

Generally, nutrients in Ribeira dos Covões (phosphorous and nitrogen forms) reached 

high concentrations during winter storm flows, near the peak discharge. In a vegetated 

catchment in southern England, May et al. (2001) reported greater phosphorus uptake 

during the growing season of plants (from spring to early autumn), leading to greater 

nutrient loads in the river system during the winter. In addition, authors also reported the 

greater phosphorus uptake by macrophytes and algae at low flow than higher winter flow. 

Nevertheless, in Ribeira dos Covões study green areas may not be the main TP source 

within the study catchment.  

In a mainly agricultural region of Vietnam, highest concentrations of NO3 and NH4 were 

observed during the dry season, but in different regions of the country highest 



CHAPTER 6 – ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STREAMWATER 

CHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION 

TO RAINFALL EVENTS 

 

224 

concentrations of NO3 were found during the wet season, but no temporal variation in 

NH4 concentrations were reported (Wilbers et al., 2014). These findings suggest that 

nutrient concentrations vary with location and over the time. In a set of catchments located 

in the San Bernardino Mountains, California, Meixner and Fenn (2004) found a positive 

relationship between nitrate and discharge, suggesting that nitrate may accumulate in the 

soil zone during dry periods. In an urban fringe catchment of Los Angeles, Barco et al. 

(2008) also exhibited highest NO3 during the first runoff event after an extended dry 

period (flushing effect), and lower concentration in the spring. This hydrological 

enhanced behaviour was explained by NO3 accumulation during dry periods in soils and 

groundwater from mineralization and nitrification processes, as well as high atmospheric 

deposition. Ocampo et al. (2006) also found that the antecedent moisture conditions of 

the catchment at seasonal and interannual times-scales had a major impact on the nitrate 

flushing response. 

Atmospheric deposition may contribute with several pollutants, as a result of human 

activities emission, particularly industrial and vehicular traffic, but also natural sources, 

such as pollens. Fossil fuel combustion produces nitrogen oxides (NOx) which are 

converted to nitric acid and nitrate aerosols. Catalytic converters in vehicles also release 

gases enriched with nitrogen, which may deposit along major roads (Carey et al., 2013). 

Stolzenbach et al. (2001), using a regional air quality model, estimated that dry 

atmospheric deposition in Los Angeles region can contribute as much as 13–99% of the 

total mass loading of metals to Santa Monica Bay. In China, local air pollution with metal-

enriched dust was considered an important source of Cu and Zn concentrations, leading 

to exceeding surface water quality standards (Yu et al., 2014). 

In Ribeira dos Covões, pollutant accumulation during dry periods and subsequent wash-

off process during the first rainfall events, may explain in part the higher concentrations 

of COD, nutrients and Mn. However, except with EC and Na, the negative or absent 

correlations between EMC parameters and API (7 and/or 14 days before the rainfall 

event), did not seem to support the pollutant accumulation theory. Higher concentration 

after the summer can, thus, be a consequence of the lower dilution effect resulting from 

lower streamflow. The small dilution effect was also considered by Wilbers et al. (2014), 

to explain the higher COD and Mn concentrations during dry season. Whitehead et al. 

(2009) stressed the relationship between decreased flow velocities and less mixing of 

water with higher concentrations of organic pollutants. 

In the study catchment, higher SELs resulted from major rainfall events observed during 

wet season. Thus, SELs were significantly positively correlated with rainfall amount, 

rainfall duration and streamflow (Table 6.5). It has been argued elsewhere that the strong 

correlation of wash-off loadings with total runoff and event duration determines the flow 

volume required to overcome surface roughness and retention thresholds on the surface, 

leading to runoff and pollutants transfer downslope (Ellis et al., 1986). Wilbers et al 

(2014) also reported the impact of increasing rainfall events on run-off from urban and

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

225 

agricultural lands to enhance water pollutants contamination. Yu et al. (2014) reported 

positive correlations between rainfall amount and loadings of Zn, Pb, Cd and Cr in a 

rapidly developing mixed land-use catchment of China. 

Peak discharge and SELs of all the quantifiable parameters analysed, except NO2+NO3, 

COD, Na, Mg and Fe, are positively correlated. An investigation into the quality of 

surface water from a motorway catchment stressed that it is peak flow intensity rather 

than volume which is of significance in runoff terms (Pope et al., 1978). Athayde et al. 

(1982) have suggested that runoff volume is the most significant predictive loading factor 

with preceding dry period and peak rainfall intensity as the most important regulators of 

pollutant concentrations.  

Rainfall intensity was also an important parameter influencing temporal variation of 

surface water quality. Maximum rainfall intensity in 15- and 60-minutes displayed 

significant positive correlations with specific loads of all the quantifiable parameters, 

except NO2+NO3 and Na. Previous authors also showed pollutant removal and loss 

through overland flow to be dependent on rainfall intensity, due to increased erosivity of 

rain splash and greater depth of interaction between rainfall and soil (Thompson et al., 

2012). The impact of rainfall intensity was particularly noticed in the greatest TS 

concentrations measured at the four sites in 02/11/2010 (I15= 15.9 mm), but also in 

14/11/2011 (I15= 2.7 mm, observed after largest antecedent rainfall period, demonstrated 

by API14= 98.5 mm). Impacts of rainfall intensity were particularly important for bare 

soil. Due to enterprise park construction, Quinta showed the highest TS concentrations 

and turbidity, greater than in ESAC surface water, which represents the catchment outlet. 

The increasing flow from other cleaner tributaries and baseflow dilutes the Quinta flow, 

minimizing the potential impact of upslope pollutant sources particularly on turbidity.  

Through the wet season, increasing baseflow contribution as well as inputs of water 

retained in the soil during previous rainfall events may also have a positive impact of few 

chemical parameters. The longer contact between water and soil matrix may provide 

higher loads of soil leachate elements into the stream network. This could explain the 

high Nk concentrations exhibited in some surface water samples collected in late winter, 

the higher Na and K concentrations through the wet season, as well as the significant 

positive correlations observed between baseflow and major cations concentration in 

surface water (Na, Mg and Ca).  

Since groundwater is usually associated with lower organic contamination (Carey et al., 

2013), except when septic tanks are present (which is not the case in Ribeira dos Covões), 

baseflow increases could have led to significant COD decreases (significant correlation 

found between the variables), associated with a possible dilution effect on streamflow in 

storm episodes.  

Higher heavy metal concentrations were also observed during wet settings (associated 

with stormflow), particularly Zn, Cu and Cd, which occasionally surpassed

226 

environmental and/or irrigation uses guidelines. These higher concentrations may be due 

to possible sewer contaminations, as discusses in section 6.5.1.. Iron and Zn 

concentrations exhibited a particular temporal variation over the study period. Iron 

displayed greater concentration during the first half sampling campaigns and greater 

dilution in later storm events, whereas Zn showed an opposite trend. This temporal 

variability of Fe and Zn could have been affected by human sources. However, since there 

were not an apparent change on car/local industry/sewage sources in the Ribeira dos 

Covões, a possible explanation may be linked with atmospheric contributions from a 

metallurgical industry, located 3 km from the north boundary of the catchment, and 

potential changes in the production chain. In fact, some of the Zn concentrations 

exceedance as regards to minimum surface water quality standards were observed in late 

summer (25/09/2012), after a longer potential period of accumulation. Nevertheless, 

further investigation is required to understand the temporal pattern of Fe and Zn within 

Ribeira dos Covões. 

 

6.5.3. Water quality at the catchment scale 

Surface water quality within Ribeira dos Covões revealed spatial variation, resulting from 

land-use and land-cover, as observed in other research studies (Basnyat et al., 1999; 

Carrey et al., 2011). Urban land-use, and particularly impervious surfaces, represented an 

important source of pollutants (Figure 6.19). The relation between major cations and TIA 

can be a result of cement composition, mainly under oxide forms of the cations (e.g. CaO, 

MgO, Na2O and K2O) (Hellebois et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2013). Despite the increase of 

EC, COD, NO2+NO3 and major cations with imperviousness, these parameters do not 

seem to represent a direct threat for aquatic ecosystems, since they are not regulated by 

the Portuguese environmental standards for surface water quality (Environmental 

Ministry, 1998). Thus, the results of the study do not allow to identify a threshold of 

impervious cover leading to aquatic ecosystems degradation. Nevertheless, there is no 

doubt that increasing organic matter (included on COD) and nitrogen loads, namely under 

NO2+NO3 forms, may cause surface water degradation, including eutrophication, 

depending on phosphorous availability. 

Total impervious area have been considered by other authors as an indicator of aquatic 

ecosystems conservation status (e.g. Arnold and Gibbons, 1996; Morse et al., 2003; 

Kuusisto-Hjort and Hjort, 2013). In previous research studies, several TIA values were 

recognised to degrade specific water quality parameters. TIA thresholds include 30-50% 

for several chemical measures and 5-50% for physical variables (Brabec et al., 2002). 

More specifically, TIA includes 42% for nutrients degradation (Griffin et al., 1980) and 

45% for phosphorus (May et al., 1997). Considering metal degradation, 50% of TIA was 

identified, as well as 40% in the case of Zn (Horner et al., 1997). Although this TIA limits 

are specific for individual parameters, aquatic ecosystems behave as a whole and one

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

227 

parameter may trigger impacts which affect all the system. TIA thresholds for general 

water quality include different ranges recognized by distinct authors. For example, Schiff 

and Benoit (2007) reported that 5-10% TIA may weaken water quality, whereas Exum et 

al. (2005) recognised modest impacts for this TIA percentage. Other authors assumed a 

minimum of 10% TIA threshold for minimum degradation start (Schueler, 1994; Arnold 

and Gibbons, 1996; Exum et al., 2005), 20% TIA for successful remediation efforts 

(Exum et al., 2005) and a maximum of 30% threshold for unavoidable impacts (Arnold 

and Gibbons, 1996). Differences in TIA thresholds between authors may stress the 

importance of pollutant sources.  

In Ribeira dos Covões, several water quality parameters did not show a relationship 

between mean event loads and TIA, including turbidity, TS, COD, Nk, NH4, Zn, TP, Fe 

and Zn. Major sources of these pollutants may include bare surfaces as regards to TS 

loads, sewage contaminations (COD, TP, NH4, Fe and Zn), manure (NH4), industrial 

pollution and lithology (Fe and Zn).  

Chemical loads were directly affected by hydrologic regime. Generally, streamflow 

increases during the wet season, not only as a direct consequence of rainfall events, but 

also antecedent rainfall and increasing baseflow, as a result of water table rise. Antecedent 

rainfall affects soil moisture content, which is an important parameter determining 

infiltration and, thus, overland flow processes (Grayson et al., 1997; Hardie et al., 2011). 

This leads to temporal variations in overland flow generation and transfer over the 

landscape. Differences in hydrological connectivity will have impacts on stream 

discharge, but also on water quality. Increasing flow connectivity within a catchment will 

involve a larger number of pollutant sources, enhancing the loads for the stream network. 

This can explain the generally high concentrations of COD, nutrients, major cations and 

heavy metals in later winter storms. The location of pollutant sources within a catchment 

and the connectivity with stream network may be crucial for water quality impacts 

(Brabec et al. 2002; Groffman et al., 2004).     

Despite the greatest absolute chemical loads were observed at the catchment outlet 

(ESAC), this drainage area exhibited the lowest specific loads of the four study 

catchments. Lower cathments produce less loads per unit area than the monitored 

upstream tributary catchments. In extensive areas, higher infiltration opportunities may 

decrease flow connectivity between the sources of pollutants and the stream network, 

which can explain lowest specific loads at the catchment outlet. Ellis et al. (1986) stated 

that catchment loadings are controlled predominantly by transport limited hydrodynamic 

conditions rather than by source availability. According to Horner et al. (1997), runoff 

infiltration or retention in surface depressions is the key to reduce pollutant loads reaching 

the stream network.  

The relevance of connectivity between pollutant sources and the stream network was 

highlighted with TS results. Solid contributions from clear-felled areas located upslope

CHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION 

TO RAINFALL EVENTS 

 

228 

Quinta were negligible, because overland flow had to overpass woodland land-use before 

reach the channel. On the other hand, clear-felled areas in Espírito Santo displayed a great 

impact in TS due to its proximity to the stream. Furthermore, fertilization and manure in 

agricultural fields nearby the stream channels also exhibited greater nitrogen impacts on 

surface water.  

In addition, natural overland flow connectivity can be changed over a catchment through 

human interventions. Particularly in the urban land-uses, drainage systems are 

constructed in order to collect and pipe overland flow to downslope areas. In Ribeira dos 

Covões, storm runoff is usually piped into the stream network or nearby soils, where 

overland flow dissipates. Piping overland flow from impervious surfaces directly to the 

stream channels enhances not only the streamflow response, but also pollutant loads. The 

impact of induced drainage system connectivity on streamwater quality was more evident 

in Porto Bordalo, where partial urban runoff was discharged above the sampling site.  

The hydrological connectivity provided by the urban drainage system may be particularly 

important under drier conditions. Despite the lower pollutant loads, some of highest 

concentrations where measured during the first rainfall events after the summer, leading 

to surpassed minimum water quality standards, particularly as regards to Nk and NH4. 

Water quality degradation during drier periods was enhanced by the lack of dilution 

effect, resulting from lower streamflow. In contrast, natural pathways for overland flow 

or its discharge in downslope permeable soils, such as woodland and agricultural fields, 

would enhance the opportunity for overland flow infiltration and, thus, reducing pollutant 

loads. The placement of impervious surfaces and the location of urban systems discharge 

influence the possible absorption by pervious surfaces, and represent an important issue 

regarding stream quality (Horner et al., 1997; Barbec et al., 2002).   

Several studies have investigated the role of green areas, such as woodland land-uses, 

riparian zones and turfgrass, to improve water quality in urban catchments (Wickham et 

al., 2002; Matteo et al., 2006). Vegetated areas are effective in overland flow infiltration 

and, particularly, at reducing nutrient exports because these areas function as active 

nutrient transformation zones or sinks (Basnyat et al., 1999; Groffman et al., 2009). 

Matteo et al. (2006) also indicated that the selection and placement of green areas cover 

can influence sediment and pollutant loadings.  

Developing strategies to reduce overall pollutant exports within a catchment require an 

assessment of relative contribution sources and pollutant transport mechanisms (Carey et 

al., 2013). In addition, flow connectivity across the landscape and its seasonal variability 

as well as its impact on surface water quality represents important information for 

landscape planning. Stein and Ackerman (2007) also noted that management strategies to 

protect water quality should consider the seasonal importance of dry weather runoff. 

Prevent water quality damage under catchment management planning stage will be more

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

229 

cost effective than later implementation of structural measures, which should be specific 

for target pollutants (Goonetilleke et al., 2005). 

Considering the relatively low storm events monitored and the huge land-use 

heterogeneity across the Ribeira dos Covões catchment, pollutant sources were not clearly 

identified. However, the results highlighted the potential environmental problems 

resultant from higher TS concentrations, particularly during the first rainfall events after 

the summer. Construction sites represent major sediment sources, and in situ 

measurements, such as surface cover with geotextile of areas temporarily unmanaged, 

should be implemented to minimize erosion. Fertilizer and manure application, 

particularly in agricultural fields adjacent to the stream channel should be appropriately 

managed, particularly as regards to the time and amount of application, in order to avoid 

pollutant levels of nitrogen, not only after the summer but also during winter storms. 

Higher concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and COD were also 

associated with urban areas, possibly due to domestic wastewater leakages. Periodic 

maintenance of sewer systems should be performed in order to avoid environmental 

problems. Sources of heavy metals within the study sites were possibly associated with 

road runoff, but further investigation should be performed in order to better understand if 

road runoff should be routed to wastewater treatments systems or not.  

 

6.6. Conclusion 

Peri-urban catchments display multiple pollutant sources and pathways which affect 

surface water quality. Within these catchments, the complex land-use pattern and its 

spatial configuration present additional challenges to identify the specific sources of 

pollutants, particularly in a catchment with high spatial complexity such as the Portuguese 

Ribeira dos Covões.   

This study revealed significant spatio-temporal variation in surface water quality, which 

vary between different physical-chemical parameters. Climatic conditions, land-use and 

lithology are parameters affecting catchment surface water chemistry. Some of the 

physical-chemical properties increase with greater urban land-use extent, particularly 

with impervious surface cover. Significant correlations between median event 

concentration and percentage impervious surface were found for EC and NO2+NO3 on 

dissolved phase of surface water. Over the study period, median EC increased from 182 

µS cm-1 in Quinta (sub-catchment with lowest urban area, 25%), to 318 µS cm-1 in 

Espírito Santo (with greatest urban cover, 50%), whereas median NO2+NO3 

concentrations increased from 0.35 mg L-1 to 1.46 mg L-1. Significant positive correlations 

between major cations and urban impervious surface were also found (median values of 

5.7-18.6 mg Na L-1, 3.1-6.1 mg K L-1, 19.8-34.4 mg Ca L-1 and 3.2-10.4 mg Mg L-1 in the

CHEMISTRY WITHIN A PERI-URBAN MEDITERRANEAN CATCHMENT, IN RELATION 

TO RAINFALL EVENTS 

 

230 

monitored sites), but they could have been influenced by lithology differences between 

the study sites. 

Greatest specific loads of chemical parameters were found in the highly urbanized 

Espírito Santo sub-catchment (mean event values of 203 kg COD km-2, 4 kg Nk km-2 and 

0.2 kg TP km-2), but greater TS loads were maeasured in Quinta sub-catchment (mean 

event values ranged between 27 and 3943 kg km-2 over the 10 rainfall events monitored), 

encompassing 10% of its area under construction.   

Hydrological connectivity seems to be an important key issue on surface water quality, 

since it determines the linkage between pollutant sources and stream network. Larger 

areas provide more opportunities for overland flow infiltration and retention, enhancing 

flow and pollutants pathways disruption. This may in part explain the lower specific 

pollutant loads observed at the catchment outlet. The relevance of landscape connectivity 

was also denoted by TS loads, with clear-felled located upslope woodland areas exposing 

lower TS contribution to the stream channel, than disturbed surfaces located nearby the 

stream and with overland flow linkage. Similarly, agricultural fields adjacent to the 

stream network could have led to higher nitrogen contributions than agricultural areas 

located at larger distances from watercourses. Nevertheless, in urban areas, the 

hydrological and, thus, pollutant sources connectivity with watercourses do not depend 

on location and distance, but rather on the urban drainage system itself. Surface water 

with direct contribution from impervious surfaces, provided by urban drainage system 

discharge, showed higher event median concentrations of EC, TP, Nk, NH4 and Zn. 

Furthermore, leakages from the domestic wastewater drainage system may provide an 

important source of organic matter and nutrient contamination.    

Although surface water quality is strongly influenced by the hydrological regime, the 

concentrations in surface water often show distinct temporal patterns. Chemical oxygen 

demand, nutrients (Nk, NH4, NO2+NO3 and TP) and Mn, presented higher concentrations 

in the first rainfall events monitored after the summer, and generally decreasing 

concentrations through the wet season. This is thought to be a consequence of reduced 

dilution at times of low streamflow. Under these conditions, some minimum surface water 

quality standards were exceeded, notably Nk and NH4 (&gt; 2.0 mg L
-1 and 1.0 mg L-1), in 

all the studied catchments and sub-catchments (except in Quinta, with ~70% woodland 

area, as regards to NH4). In addition, concentrations of these parameters, as well as some 

heavy metals (Zn, Cu and Cd) also exceeded the environmental standards during late 

winter storm events (&gt;0.1 mg L-1 of Cu and Cd, and&amp;lt;0.5 mg L-1 of Zn), possibly due to 

increasing connectivity between sources and the stream network. Surface water quality 

in Ribeira dos Covões, occasionally exceeded the recommended guidelines for irrigation 

use as regards to TDS (&gt;640 mg L-1), pH (slightly higher than 9.0 in Porto Bordalo), Cu 

(&gt;0.2 mg L-1 in Espírito Santo), Mn (&gt;0.2 mg L-1 in Porto Bordalo and ESAC) and Cd 

(&gt;0.01 mg L-1 in ESAC). Despite occasional exceedance of maximum recommended 

values, the guidelines for maximum admissible value were always accomplished.

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

231 

Nevertheless, additional sampling during dry periods should be performed in order to 

assess water quality within Ribeira dos Covões better, since some pollutants may be 

diluted during rainfall events.  

Further investigation is required to assess changes in spatial location of pollutant sources 

over the year better. In addition, other pollutants typically associated with human 

activities and urban land-uses, such as suspended sediments, BOD, oils, hydrocarbons 

and biological contaminants (e.g. coliforms), should be studied in order to improve the 

understanding of urbanization impacts on stream water quality. 

The identification of pollutant sources and knowledge about the seasonal variation is 

important in order to establish spatially-explicit water management strategies to monitor 

and improve the local water quality at different time intervals. Moreover, a better 

understanding of the potential sources and sinks of pollutants should guide the 

stakeholders to design sustainable peri-urban areas. A planned land-use pattern at the 

catchment scale can minimize surface water quality problems and protect aquatic 

ecosystem services.

LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

235 

7.1. Context 

Land-use changes, including those associated with urbanization, can have major impacts 

on hydrological processes and streamwater quality. These modifications can be 

particularly significant and complex in peri-urban areas, due to the complex mosaic of 

the landscape. Understanding how different combinations and arrangements of land-uses 

affect overland flow generation and its speed and magnitude transfer via other parts of 

the catchment to the stream network is a major research question in hydrology.  

This research has been the first study to assess the spatio-temporal variation of surface 

hydrological processes and their impact on stream water quality in a peri-urban catchment 

in a Portuguese setting. The study has used an integrated methodology based on field data 

acquisition at different scales: soil properties, runoff plots and catchment/sub-catchment 

scale, which is not usually considered in this type of studies. Real data acquisition is 

essential for understanding the system behaviour, and measurements at different scales 

provide important information for a better understanding on interactions between factors 

influencing processes and their integration at the catchment scale. Without data gathering, 

there is no basis for predictive modelling and risk management, as well as decision-

making based on scientific knowledge to establish preventive actions in order to minimize 

the flood hazard.   

The research allies itself with WFD objectives in that it highlights nature’s capacity to 

absorb or control overland flow and the relevance of spatial planning for flood prevention 

and aquatic ecosystems protection. It also stresses that preventing these problems at a 

planning stage and at the catchment scale is the most cost-effective solution.    

 

7.2. The role of soil properties in different land-uses on 

potential overland flow processes  

Land-use changes in the Ribeira dos Covões catchment were found to have affected soil 

properties greatly and via them to have influenced infiltration and overland flow 

processes. Woodland soils were found to have the highest organic matter content and the 

lowest bulk density, favoured by the great vegetation cover. However, the vegetation also 

releases hydrophobic compounds which form an impermeable surface soil layer and leads 

to infiltration-excess overland flow. This is particularly important in dry conditions, due 

to the widespread and stronger hydrophobic properties, particularly under eucalypt and 

pine stands, dominant on woodland-sandstone areas (median infiltration capacity: 0.3 mm 

h-1). During the wet season, the switching properties of the hydrophobic substances and/or 

its leachate to deeper soil layers, lead to hydrophilic soil conditions and higher soil matrix 

infiltration capacity, which reached 8.3 mm h-1 at some sites.  



CHAPTER 7 – FINAL DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS 

 

236 

In contrast, urban soils were found to be characterized by lowest soil organic matter 

content and greatest bulk density, possibly resulting from human trampling and vehicular 

traffic. The limited production of hydrophobic substances input, associated with only a 

minor and patchy vegetation cover, was found to lead to widespread hydrophilic 

conditions over the year. Nevertheless, the lower vegetation cover led to greater soil 

moisture increase during rainfall events, as a result of minor rainfall interception, but also 

favours enhanced soil drying between storms. During dry periods, matrix infiltration 

capacity was high (median 2.7 mm h-1), whereas, in wet periods, increased soil moisture 

content reduced infiltration capacity (median  1.2 mm h-1), favouring the development of 

saturation overland flow.  

In agricultural fields, distinct land management associated with pasture, olive tree 

plantations and small gardens, dominant over sandstone soils, resulted in lower organic 

matter and higher bulk density than in the abandoned fields on limestone, with vegetation 

following the natural succession. In agricultural fields, the higher vegetation cover under 

limestone than sandstone also leads to greater soil hydrophobicity. Nevertheless, given 

the lower vegetation cover in agricultural-limestone than woodland soils, hydrophobicity 

was not so severe and widespread, breaking down more easily with rainfall events and 

requiring longer dry conditions to be re-established. Lower vegetation cover than 

woodland and higher surface roughness than urban soils may have led to greater soil 

moisture content in agricultural areas, particularly the ones overlaying limestone, due to 

the marly nature and hence higher silt-clay content. In agricultural sandstone areas soil 

matrix infiltration capacity was higher in summer (except in agricultural-limestone soils), 

decreasing with soil moisture increase through the wet seasons (median matrix infiltration 

capacity: 1.9 mm h-1 and 0.9 mm h-1, respectively).  

Distinct spatio-temporal variation of soil hydrological properties led to contrasting matrix 

infiltration capacity and overland flow sources between landscape units. In general, 

woodland and agricultural-limestone areas were more susceptible to overland flow during 

dry periods, due to soil hydrophobicity, whereas urban and agricultural-sandstone soils, 

with higher matrix infiltration capacity, may provide potential overland flow sinks. In 

contrast, during wet conditions, increasing soil moisture in urban and agricultural soils 

led to lower matrix infiltration capacity, while switching hydrophobic to hydrophilic 

conditions enhanced the infiltration capacity of woodland soils. The changing nature of 

overland flow sources and sinks of different land-uses would decrease flow connectivity 

over the hillslope, minimizing the impacts on the streamflow regime. This information 

should be considered in spatial urban planning in peri-urban catchments, in order to 

reduce connectivity of overland flow and maintain a more natural streamflow regime.

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

237 

7.3. Impact of different woodland types on overland flow  

Forest is generally associated with highly permeable soils. This was in general confirmed 

for the three woodland types of Ribeira dos Covões by the low overland flow recorded 

over two years (&lt;3%). Nevertheless, dense eucalypt plantations produced twice as much 

overland flow than sparse eucalypt stands and oak woodlands. 

Significant differences in soil properties, particularly hydrophobicity and soil moisture, 

were observed between woodland types. Despite being widespread in dry periods and 

almost absent during wettest seasons, hydrophobicity was generally low in oak soils, 

moderate in sparse eucalypt stands and severe/extreme in dense eucalypt plantations. 

Under dense eucalypt plantations, hydrophobicity required longer rainfall events to break 

down and was quickly re-established after just a few days without rainfall. Furthermore, 

hydrophobicity tended to increase with soil depth in eucalypt areas, but exhibited an 

opposite trend in oak woodland soils. Oak woodland soils revealed greater soil moisture 

content than eucalypt sites.  

Differences in soil properties led to spatio-temporal variation in overland flow, despite 

the minor amounts produced. Infiltration-excess overland flow was the most important 

process within dense eucalypt plantations, as a result of the significantly greater soil 

hydrophobicity. Under driest conditions, when hydrophobicity was largest, overland flow 

attained 2.3% of the rainfall in dense eucalypt plantations, but it did not surpass 0.5% in 

sparse eucalypt stands and 0.4% in oak woodland. In dense eucalypt stands, overland flow 

increased with enhanced rainfall amount and intensity. On the other hand, in oak 

woodland, overland flow was mainly associated with saturation mechanisms, although it 

did not exceed 2.2% of the rainfall. In wettest periods, overland flow in dense and sparse 

eucalypt stands only attained 1.0% and 1.1% of storm rainfall. In oak stands, overland 

flow appeared to be linked to saturation of the shallow soil during the wettest periods. At 

the sparse eucalypt and oak sites, overland flow increased significantly with soil moisture 

content, perhaps produced due to the lower subsoil permeability, linked to its higher clay 

content and bulk density. The relatively low percentages of overland flow measured, both 

in hydrophobic and saturated soil matrix conditions, indicates the importance of water 

bypass via preferential flow paths provided by cracks and root holes.        

Results from runoff plots highlight the important role that woodland areas have on water 

infiltration and retention during rainfall events, even considering the differences in 

overland flow mechanisms. The protection of this land-use within peri-urban catchments, 

including downslope of urban expansion, is of utmost importance to minimize the impacts 

of enhanced urban runoff. Nevertheless, oak woodland is more favourable to mitigate 

floods than eucalypt plantations.    



CHAPTER 7 – FINAL DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS 

 

238 

7.4. Catchment hydrology and water quality, and potential 

impacts of the landscape pattern 

Ribeira dos Covões has a relatively low annual runoff coefficient (14-22%) despite the 

high urbanization rate (40% in 2012). This is thought to be a consequence of the low 

storage capacity of the catchment, linked to high potential evapotranspiration and high 

permeability linked to the limestone and sandstone lithology. The low annual BFI (37-

39%) can also be explained by this high permeability of the generally deep soil, but may 

also in part result from valley infill favouring subsurface flow beneath the river discharge 

gauging station.   

The seasonal Mediterranean climate is a major hydrological driver on streamflow and 

pollutant loads. During the summer, discharge is limited and dominated by baseflow 

(63%). Infiltration-excess is the dominant overland flow process and is more prone in 

areas of degraded (highly compacted and without vegetation cover) and hydrophobic 

soils, and on impervious urban surfaces. The low streamflow provides little dilution effect 

resulting in highest concentrations of chemical oxygen demand and nutrients (nitrogen 

and phosphorus). During the first rainfall events after the summer, nitrogen (kjeldahl 

nitrogen and ammonium) and manganese concentrations occasionally exceeded 

Portuguese surface water quality standards, but total solids also showed greatest 

concentrations.   

Over the wet season, increasing rainfall favours overland flow production, due to 

increasing soil moisture, which led to greater streamflow and pollutant loads. Saturation 

overland flow was more prone in late winter, favoured by water table rise in valley 

bottoms and saturation of shallow soils on limestone hillslopes. Under saturated 

conditions, higher flow connectivity down hillslopes led to greater peak flows and also 

some pollution problems, in the form of high kjeldahl nitrogen and ammonium, and some 

heavy metals (zinc, copper and cadmium), exceeding Portuguese environmental 

guidelines. 

Hydrology and hydrochemistry varied with lithology. Sandstone plays an important role 

on streamflow outlet delivery, with Ribeiro da Póvoa (56% of the catchment area) 

supplying 51% of ESAC discharge and 50% of storm flow (Figure 7.1). Within this 

lithology, stream network denotes a perennial flow regime, favoured by the greater 

baseflow (annual BFI ranged between 25-33% at upstream gauging stations and 37-38% 

in downstream locations). In limestone areas, the ephemeral regime is the product of low 

baseflow (~2% annual BFI), but annual storm flow represents 35% of ESAC storm flow. 

Streamwater chemistry within limestone areas showed higher pH as well as calcium, 

magnesium and manganese concentrations, whereas sandstone exhibited higher sodium 

loads.  

Land-use was also an important parameter influencing the catchment hydrological 

response. Across the catchment, increasing urban land-use was associated with greater 

runoff and storm runoff coefficients, though these varied with lithology. Storm runoff 

coefficients ranged from 3% in Covões to 21% in Espírito Santo sub-catchments, with 

the lowest and highest urban land-use (15%-17% and 47-49%) respectively (Figure 7.2).

LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

241 

Impermeable surfaces represent important sources of overland flow, not only within 

urban land-uses but also at the catchment scale, particularly during driest periods. In the 

Espírito Santo and Drabl sub-catchments of greatest urban cover (47% and 43%), winter 

streamflow was only 2-4 times higher than in dry periods, whereas in less urbanized areas 

the seasonal streamflow difference were greater, attaining as much as 21 times in Quinta 

(9-25% urban land-use). However, in terms of storm runoff coefficient, small differences 

were found between dry and wet seasons in the downslope area of the catchment 

(downstream Ribeiro da Póvoa and Drabl), covered by 51% of urban land-use, but also 

in Covões sub-catchment, where the reduced urban area (15%) is mostly located 

downslope, with storm runoff being piped to the stream (Figure 7.2). These differences 

highlight the role of impermeable surfaces on overland flow generation. During the rainy 

seasons, increasing soil moisture content led to enhanced flow connectivity over the 

landscape, traduced on higher storm runoff coefficients during wet conditions (Figure 

7.2).   

The proximity of urban land-use to the stream network is an important parameter 

influencing streamflow. In most urban cores located upstream, overland flow is usually 

routed and/or piped to downslope permeable soils, mostly into woodland areas but also 

into agricultural fields. Overland flow discharge into areas of permeable soil facilitates 

water infiltration and/or retention leading to minor contributions to the stream network. 

In contrast, urban areas located near the stream network have a greater impact on 

streamflow, particularly if storm runoff is piped directly to the water lines. During the 

study period, the 2% enlargement of the urban area of Covões, mostly downstream and 

with overland flow piped directly into the stream, led to a 6% storm runoff coefficient 

increase. On the other hand, the enlargement of urban area within Quinta (from 9 to 25%), 

did not reflect on storm runoff increase, due to greater overland flow retention/infiltration 

opportunities in downslope permeable soils, enhanced by larger distance to the tributary. 

The 7% growth in urban cover of Porto Bordalo, located in upslope areas far away from 

the stream, also did not affect the runoff coefficient. This was also due to obstructions to 

overland flow in downslope areas by several structures, including road embankments, 

houses, walls and surface depressions within construction sites.  

Urban impervious surfaces also led to quicker response time. In Porto Bordalo and 

Covões, where the urban overland flow is partially piped to the tributaries, peak flow was 

usually reached in 5-10 minutes after the peak rainfall. Despite the largest urban land-

uses in Espírito Santo and Drabl, response time was ~20 minutes. This was due to 

overland flow being routed into soils rather than being piped to the stream network. 

Despite the highest annual peak denoted an increasing tendency with urban areas 

expansion, the analysis of storm events did not show a clear impact of urbanization on 

peak flow during the three years of study.  

Urban land-use and impervious area also affected surface water quality. Increasing 

imperviousness led to greater specific loads of chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen 

(kjeldahl nitrogen) and phosphorus. Hydrological connectivity between sources of 

pollutants and the stream network, however, is an important parameter affecting surface 

water quality. Direct discharge of urban runoff into stream led to higher concentrations, 

particularly of phosphorous and zinc. Erosion of bare soil by overland flow supplied 

considerable sediment when overland flow was connected to the water lines (e.g. the 



CHAPTER 7 – FINAL DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS 

 

242 

enterprise park construction site). But when sediment sources were not hydraulically 

connected with the stream network, particularly if they were located upslope of woodland, 

the impact on surface water quality was minimal. Similarly, higher loads of nitrogen were 

measured in streams surrounded by agricultural fields. 

In peri-urban catchments a dispersed settlement of urban structures, particularly located 

upslope, and the maintenance of permeable soils should be considered in order to 

minimize streamflow impacts, not only as regards to the magnitude of the flow but also 

to water quality. In Ribeira dos Covões, the proximity of some houses to the stream 

network and the expected future urbanization increase, controlling additional overland 

flow production and preventing it from reaching the stream network, would be very 

important to mitigate flood hazards and aquatic ecosystems degradation.  

 

7.5. Overland flow processes at different scales and impacts 

on catchment surface hydrology 

The research in Ribeira dos Covões indicates that different physical processes may 

dominate at different spatio-temporal scales. Based on soil properties, such as particle 

size distribution, bulk density and hydrophobicity, spatial differences between land-uses, 

but also within the same land-use, provide differences in soil matrix infiltration capacity 

which can support different overland flow processes. However, the relatively low soil 

matrix infiltration capacity values measured at a very small soil scale with a minidisc 

infitrometer did not corroborate with the high permeability indicated by the runoff plot 

experiments and catchment hydrology. This could be because of the dominance of other 

physical processes acting at larger scales.  

Plot experiments highlighted the important role of preferential flow paths on hillslope, 

associated with macropores such as cracks, root holes or wormholes, on infiltration of 

water to deeper soil layers with a minimum contribution of the soil matrix. In addition, at 

the hillslope scale, surface roughness can be an important parameter. Thus the greater 

surface concavities and litter layer of woodland areas have a higher potential for overland 

flow retention. However, after the retention capacity is exceeded, flow connectivity will 

be established downslope.   

Land management in agricultural fields can also influence surface roughness, particularly 

through ploughing. Also ancestral stone walls, used in agricultural and woodland areas in 

order to promote water retention, are also effective in breaking flow connectivity. In urban 

areas, impervious surfaces not only promote greater overland flow and quicker transport 

due to surface smoothness, though pervious soil areas can lead to overland flow 

infiltration. Some urban features such as retention basins, embarkments and walls, may 
provide surface water retention, although their role under large storm events may be limited 

and could exacerbate flood damages in case of failure.    

At the hillslope scale, soil depth and lithology could be also relevant parameters 

influencing hydrological processes. In shallow soils overlying marly limestone, soil 

saturation and sub-surface lateral flow is prone to occur. Furthermore, lithology is also 



LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

243 

associated with baseflow delivery, representing a minor contribution in limestone areas, 

but a considerable fraction of the sandstone streamflow.  

Apart from the spatial scales, hydrological processes are, to some extent, related with 

time scales. Infiltration-excess, resulting from heavy rainfall events, is usually observed 

in short periods of time, varying between minutes to hours, according with rainfall 

duration. Saturation is typically slower, since overland flow is determined by building up 

soil moisture. It can endure several days, particularly if saturated areas are influenced by 

water table level. Subsurface lateral flow is often associated with response times of a day 

or longer (Bloschl and Sivapalan, 1995). Furthermore, baseflow at the catchment level, 

due to delayed water sources and groundwater contribution, is usually linked to time-

scales of months and years.  

All these spatio-temporal scales determine the catchment hydrology but also its 

hydrochemical properties. Overland flow sources and the mechanisms of transport over 

the hillslope will influence the connectivity between pollutant sources and the stream 

network. Nevertheless, greater distances create more opportunities for water infiltration 

and/or surface retention, if storm drainage systems are not installed.  

In general, considering the potential sources and sinks of overland flow and their 

contribution to catchment hydrology, the landscape of Ribeira dos Covões can be 

divided into several hydrological units: 1) woodland-sandstone areas, characterized by 

hydrophobic soils and thus, susceptible to infiltration-excess overland flow in summer 

storms and after dry periods; 2) woodland-limestone areas and agricultural 

fields overlying limestone, which are associated with high surface roughness but usually 

shallow soils, and hence more prone to saturation overland flow especially in wet periods; 

3) agricultural-sandstone areas and upslope urban areas (without overland flow being 

piped to the stream network), characterized by a low susceptibility to generate overland-

flow; and 4) urban areas located near the stream network, characterized by high and 

rapid overland flow contribution to the streamflow, both from impervious surfaces 

(especially if directly piped to the ephemeral stream network)  and easily saturated urban 

soils. 

 

7.6. Implications  

7.6.1. Ribeira dos Covões catchment 

Despite the dominance of woodland areas, this peri-urban catchment has undergone rapid 

urbanization, which is expected to continue in the near future. The current mosaic of land-

uses seems to favour water infiltration, traduced by the relatively low storm runoff 

coefficients (Figure 7.2). Some of the urban areas are dispersed over the catchment and 

located in upslope positions, which not only represent safe areas in terms of flood hazard, 

but also allow downslope areas to act as sinks for overland flow infiltration and/or 

retention. Nevertheless, there are urban cores placed on valley bottoms, and the proximity 

between some infrastructures, namely houses, to the stream network, highlight the 



CHAPTER 7 – FINAL DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS 

 

244 

vulnerability to floods (Figure 7.3).  A few flood events have already brought 

inconvenience and damage to the local population. This problem is expected to become 

more frequent, considering the upslope urban areas planned for the near future (Figure 

7.3).  

 

 

 

 

Figure 7.3  – Location of most vulnerable houses (based on reports of local citizens of previous 

flood events), projected urban cores and potential sites for installing retention basins (adapted 

from Google Earth, 2014).  

 

The projected urban cores and extent of the existing ones are well positioned within the 

catchment, considering the topography, hydrology and accessibility. However, despite 

the downslope opportunities for overland flow infiltration, increasing impervious area 

would affect streamflow and enhance flood hazard in downslope urban areas. The most 

appropriate solution to protect the most vulnerable citizens would be to relocate them in 

other urban spaces, and convert these areas into additional stream bank. However, this

would be a drastic measure which would bring conflicts with local population and high 

financial costs.  

The most cost-efficient solution to protect downslope urban areas from flood hazard, 

would be to enhance overland flow infiltration and/or retention in upslope areas, and 

prevent additional run-off from the new urban cores. The establishment of green areas 

within the urban cores would not only have aesthetical value but also create permeable 

areas which could enhance water infiltration. Other potentially useful measures would be 

to construct infiltration trenches immediately downslope of urban structures and retention 

basins in open fields. Suggested locations for these preventive structures are shown on 

Figure 7.1 and were selected based on the streamflow amount resulting from upslope 

urban cores but also in the overland flow from the highway. In addition to reducing the 

flow connectivity over the landscape, these structures would also delay the overland flow 

and retain sediments, which would be important to reduce suspended sediment loads in 

stream water. 

In the enterprise park area under current construction, the overland flow is routed at the 

moment to a retention basin, which delays the flow delivery into the stream network 

(Figure 7.1). However, discharge from the retention basin has already caused the stream 

to overflow onto downslope agricultural fields. This is mostly because of the small size 

of the channel section, thus its enlargement seems to be the only effective solution to 

reduce the flooding hazard, erosion and potential pollution of these fields with urban 

pollutants, particularly nutrients and metals.  

An important problem observed within the study catchment is the lack of cleaning and 

maintenance of features of the urban drainage network. Sediments tend to clog drains and 

channels, thus reducing their drainage capacity and leading to overflow. These problems 

can be easily solved with regular cleaning and dredging activities.  

Inspections and maintenance operations to the wastewater drainage system would be also 

important, in order to prevent sewage leakages and surface water contamination. 

 

7.6.2. Urban land management  

Land-use changes, particularly of peri-urban areas, should be planned so as to minimize 

hydrological changes and flood hazard resulting from urban development. These goals 

could be partially achieved through appropriate spatial planning at the catchment scale. 

Physical catchment characteristics, such as geology, topography and soil properties, 

should be considered in order to evaluate the potential uses. Importantly, however, a 

landscape pattern comprising a strategically positioned combination of land-uses should 

be designed to favour water infiltration and detention. As this study has demonstrated, 

during the year, different land-uses are prone to provide potential sources and sinks of 



CHAPTER 7 – FINAL DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS 

 

246 

overland-flow. Thus a mosaic of mixed land-uses that will break flow connectivity across 

the landscape can be designed so as to restrict the amount of overland flow reaching the 

stream network, leading to smaller changes in streamflow storm peaks, less water quality 

degradation and hence only minor impacts on aquatic ecosystems.  

In Portugal, municipalities are the responsible authorities for land-use planning, through 

the development of the Municipal Master Plan. These plans should try to incorporate 

land-use patches in any development proposal to reduce overland flow sources and 

provide infiltration areas. Besides the spatial location and extent of each land-use, these 

municipal plans should also limit the maximum area of impervious surfaces. Adequate 

provision of permeable surfaces breaking up the impervious area could greatly increase 

infiltration and reduce peak flows at the stream network. 

The safeguarding of soils with greatest infiltration capacity is recognised at a Portuguese 

national level. A network of sites with ecological interest, in which maximum infiltration 

areas are included, has been established (National Ecological Reserve). All the areas 

included in this reserve have several usage restrictions, in order to preserve their 

ecological role (Ministry of Planning and Territory, 1990). These areas include stream 

beds and areas threatened by floods (defined as areas covered by water during medium 

floods). Moreover, with the purpose of minimizing flood damage, national legislation 

imposes tight construction restrictions within 10 m of non-navigable streams (Ministries 

of Marine and Public Constructions, 1971), though, this protection distance is not always 

adhered to.   

Although improved landscape planning and protection of maximum infiltration areas are 

cost-efficient methods to reduce overland flow, additional measures can be required in 

order to maximize upstream overland flow reduction. It could be important to combine 

nonstructural (associated with planning process) and structural (e.g. stormwater detention 

structures, such as dykes and dams) measures to mitigate flood risks. Sustainable urban 

drainage systems, incorporating features such as infiltration trenches and small detention 

ponds, have been considered as cost-effective means to control overland flow and 

associated pollutant loads and partially restore a more natural hydrologic regime to a 

catchment (Parikh et al., 2005).  

 

7.7. Challenges and limitations of the research 

Catchment hydrology is a result of the complex interplay of several biophysical 

parameters, such as climate pattern, topography, geology and soil properties, land-use and 

land cover as well as their historical evolution. The requirement of knowledge in all these 

fields in a holistic approach to understanding hydrological and hydrochemical processes 

represented the most challenging issue in this research study. Despite this research 



LAND-USE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDROCHEMICAL 

PROCESSES OF PERI-URBAN AREAS 

 

247 

contributed to a better understanding of the impact of a Portuguese peri-urban style, the 

influence of each landscape unit and the result of different combinations and 

arrangements of land-uses on overland flow connectivity and streamflow discharge, 

particularly, surface water chemistry remains not fully understood and some aspects 

require further investigation.  

Besides the complexity to understand overland flow processes at different spatial and 

time scales, and its influence on transfer mechanisms over the hillslope, additional 

challenges were posed by the influence of urban drainage systems. They significantly 

affect the connectivity between overland flow and pollutant sources and the stream 

network. Over the study period, there were contacts with the local authorities responsible 

for the design, development and maintenance of the urban drainage system. However, 

despite their interest in the outcomes of this research, the bureaucratic process for formal 

requests for drainage system information, and its approval by the company managers, did 

not allow the supply of this information in time. Because of this lack of information 

transfer, the discussed impact of the drainage system was based on field observations and 

information from local citizens, rather than from arguably more accurate official sources. 

It was not possible to calculate the directly connected impervious area and, thus, quantify 

the connectivity over the catchment and adequately assess its impact on streamflow 

response.  

Longer-term monitoring data would be also valuable for a better understanding of the 

spatio-temporal overland flow processes, since  the hydrological years covered in this 

study were years of below- or near-average annual rainfall. It is important to measure and 

understand how catchment hydrology change under rainiest conditions, and particularly 

during severe rainfall events, since these will be the most endangering for local people, 

and the ones where the impacts most need to be minimized. 

Limited human resources also represented an important constraint to the study, given the 

time required to install and maintain the extensive monitoring network involved. Time 

required for field measurements was not always compatible with the quick hydrological 

response of Ribeira dos Covões catchment, which led to a relatively low number of high 

flow measurements at all the gauging stations. It also affected the temporal resolution of 

surface water sampling in storm hydrographs. The type of water level recorders used in 

the gauging stations was not always the best, considering the small water depths and the 

occasional changes on the channel surface, resulting from some sedimentation associated 

with major rainfall events. Although frequent field visits and manual data acquisition 

made it possible to correct streamflow data series, this took several months to achieve.  

Vandalism and theft significantly affected data acquisition by parts of the monitoring 

network. This was particularly the case with the streamflow record from Iparque and 

Mina, where the resultant short and broken flow records and uncertainties of their quality 

prevented them being included in the analysis. In addition, theft of soil moisture sensors 



CHAPTER 7 – FINAL DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS 

 

248 

installed in woodland runoff plots also hindered continuous data acquisition at different 

soil depths. Soil sampling and soil moisture measurements in the laboratory were the 

alternative solutions found, but they did not allow monitoring of soil moisture behaviour 

through rainfall events.  

As regards surface water quality assessment, few storm events were able to be sampled 

as a result of limited human resources, particularly to perform laboratory analysis. The 

analytical methods used for different water quality parameters were largely determined 

by the laboratory conditions and equipment. Thus the high detection limits of the heavy 

metal analytical procedures constrained the assessments of spatio-temporal variations in 

metal concentrations. Also the study was not able to include assessment of chemical 

parameters, such as biochemical oxygen demand, as well as oils and fats, that are usually 

considered as important urban pollutants.  

 

7.8. Fields for future research 

A prime need of future research will be the incorporation of more detailed information of 

the artificially constructed urban drainage system in order to improve the understanding 

of the connectivity, between different urban land-uses and the stream network. This 

information, coupled with the field data acquired, should be used as data inputs for, and 

to calibrate and validate, spatially-distributed hydrological models. The application of 

modelling tools will allow an improved assessment of the impact of the location and 

extension of different landscape mosaic features, as well as the testing of future 

urbanization scenarios and the best locations for mosaic elements and mitigation 

measures. Such information should be coupled with flood risk assessment and should 

guide future catchment management.  

Further investigation of surface water quality is also important. Greater spatial and 

temporal resolution of water sampling is required in order to identify pollutant sources, 

their transport mechanisms and understand the seasonal variation on surface water 

quality. Identifying critical source areas and their connectivity with the stream network 

over the year is needed in order to select appropriate preventive measures and settings, 

which may be specific to different target pollutants. Water quality data should be also 

considered together with the hydrological modelling, so that best spatial arrangement of 

land-uses is based upon both flood risk management and aquatic ecosystems protection. 

This research has also highlighted some complementary themes that should be 

investigated in the future, such as establishing practical guidelines and rules to provide 

hydrological connectivity breaks, which should be considered under current planning 

legislation and catchment management.
