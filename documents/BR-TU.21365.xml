abstract 
 

 

An enormous contribution in the scientific community of material engineering is 
being made by the exceptionally rapid evolution of the field of multifunctional 
materials. Multiferroics combine simultaneously at least two of the three ferroic 
properties: ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity. Magnetoelectric 
multiferroics’ ability of magnetic field manipulation via electric fields or vice 
versa can be extremely promising for information storage applications, leading 
to thinner, as well as flexible devices, with significantly high energetic 
efficiencies and elevated capacities. 
The aim of this work is the preparation and characterization of bismuth ferrite 
porous thin films, having as further objective to be able to serve as matrices for 
future functionalization. The strategy of this work consists of: a) dense film 
preparation with varying deposition velocities, b) porous film preparation with 
varying solution template quantities, inorganic precursor concentration and 
deposition velocities. Annealing temperature studies were also required, for the 
obtainment of the desired properties and control of microstructure. The 
methodologies for the film preparation in use were: a) sol-gel process, b) 
Evaporation Induced Self-Assembly (EISA), for the induction of porosity, and c) 
dip-coating technique. 
A series of dense films with varying deposition velocities were produced, 
serving as means of comparison for the porous thin films. Increasing the sol-gel 
deposition velocity led to increasing thickness. Piezoresponse Force 
Microscopy (PFM) characterization was conducted, revealing the expected 
ferroelectric domains. By the same technique, local piezoelectric hysteresis 
loops were obtained, showing increase of polarization saturation with 
increasing thickness. Lastly, magnetic moment measurements were carried out 
by the use of Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID), 
presenting decrease of remnant magnetization with increasing thickness. 
Varying template concentration was introduced in order to obtain a 
homogenous porous network. Homogeneity and lack of cracks in the films were 
successfully achieved, by decreasing solution template mass, for a given 
solution concentration. Thermal treatment studies revealed loss of porous 
network ordering at elevated annealing temperatures, required for the 
obtainment of crystallization and enhanced multiferroic properties. Local 
piezoelectric hysteresis loops showed increase of the effective piezoelectric 
coefficient with increasing thickness. SQUID characterization presented 
increasing remnant magnetization with increasing porosity. Lastly, increasing 
inorganic precursors concentration resulted in better control of porosity order 
and increase in the piezoelectric coefficient.

resumo 

 
Uma enorme contribuição na comunidade científica da Engenharia de 
Materiais tem sido feita pela evolução excecionalmente rápida no âmbito dos 
materiais multifuncionais. Os multiferróicos combinam simultaneamente pelo 
menos duas das três propriedades ferróicas: ferroeletricidade, 
ferromagnetismo e ferroelasticidade. Os multiferróicos magnetoelétricos que 
permitem a manipulação do campo magnético através do campo elétrico e vice 
versa são extremamente promissores para aplicações de armazenamento de 
informação, levando a dispositivos mais finos e flexíveis com eficiência 
energética significativamente mais alta e elevadas capacidades. 
O objetivo deste trabalho é a preparação e caracterização de filmes porosos 
de ferrite de bismuto, com vista a serem capazes a uma futura funcionalização. 
A estratégia deste trabalho consiste: a) preparação de filme denso variando a 
velocidade de deposição, b) preparação de filme poroso variando o template 
da solução concentração do precursor inorgânico, e velocidades de deposição. 
Os estudos sobre temperatura de calcinação são também necessários, para a 
obtenção das propriedades requeridas e o controlo da microestrutura. As 
metodologias para a preparação dos filmes foram: a) sol-gel, b) Evaporation 
Induced Self-Assembly, para a indução da porosidade, e c) dip-coating. 
Foi preparada uma série de filmes densos variando a velocidade de deposição, 
servindo como meio de comparação para os filmes porosos. Aumento da 
velocidade de deposição resulta em aumento da espessura dos filmes. Foi 
utilizada a caracterização por piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), 
revelando domínios ferroelétricos como esperado. Pela mesma técnica, foram 
obtidas curvas de histerese piezoelétricas locais mostrando o aumento da 
saturação da polarização com o aumento da espessura. Por fim, as medidas 
dos momentos magnéticos foram obtidos através do Superconducting 
Quantum Interference Device (SQUID), apresentando uma diminuição da 
magnetização remanescente com o aumento da espessura. 
A variação da concentração do template foi introduzida de modo a obter uma 
porosidade homogénea. A homogeneidade e ausência de fissuras nos filmes 
foi conseguida com sucesso pela diminuição da massa do template da 
solução, para uma determinada concentração da solução. Os estudos do 
tratamento térmico revelou a perda da porosidade ordenada para temperaturas 
mais elevadas, necessárias para a obtenção da cristalização e melhoria das 
propriedades multiferróicas. As curvas de histerese piezoelétrica local 
mostraram um aumento do coeficiente efetivo piezoelétrico com o aumento da 
espessura. A caracterização por SQUID apresentou um aumento da 
magnetização remanescente com o aumento da porosidade. Por fim, o 
aumento da concentração dos precursores inorgânicos resulta em um melhor 
controlo da ordem da porosidade e aumento do coeficiente piezoelétrico.

1. Introduction 

 Objectives 1.1

Porous matrices have a great importance for a large range of applications. Firstly, 

the presence of porosity can provide lighter devices. In addition, novel architectures can be 

achieved by the incorporation of diverse materials in the pores, producing multifunctional 

films. Importantly, these structures are ideal for the field of sensors and actuators, since 

porosity confers enhanced pyroelectric properties, by decreasing the dielectric constant, 

which results in increase in the figure of merit.[1,2] Lastly, for the case of 

antiferromagnetic materials, the high surface area owing to the porous network can result 

in elevated magnetization.[3,4] 

This thesis aims at understanding the effect of porosity and thickness on the 

multiferroic properties of Bismuth Ferrite (BiFeO3, BFO) thin films. For this purpose, a 

series of BFO films were prepared, with varying porosity and thickness, having as a 

starting and comparison point dense and relatively thick films (~300nm). 

Films were prepared via a sequence of simple and low cost processes: sol-gel, 

Evaporation Induced Self-Assembly (EISA) and dip-coating for the deposition of the films 

on silicon platinised substrates. The porosity was tailored by the polymer and inorganic 

precursors concentration. Processing variables, as deposition, drying and annealing 

temperatures, were modified for maximized control of the microstructure and properties. 

 Structure of the Thesis 1.2

The thesis consists of 5 chapters. Chapter 2 is dedicated to the State of the Art, the 

fundamental theories and ideas, which led to the definition of the experimental strategy. 

Chapter 3 comprises the detailed description of the experimental and the characterization 

procedure used along this work. In Chapter 4, a comprehensive discussion of the obtained 

results is conducted. Finally, in Chapter 5, general conclusions and proposed future work 

are presented.

 Microelectronics 2.1

If 50 years took us to get from the room-sized computer of the 60’s to the 9 mm-

thick ultra-books of the 00’s, we are just on the threshold of the era of electrically 

controllable nanoscale storage, which will lead to thinner, lighter, portable and flexible 

devices, with significantly high energetic efficiencies and huge capacities (Figure 2.1). 

Figure 2.1 Computer evolution from the 60’s up to the 00’s, with decreasing cost and 

dimensions and increasing capacity and velocity (adapted from reference [5]). 

An enormous contribution to the scientific community of materials engineering is 

being made by the exceptionally rapid evolution of the field of multifunctional materials. 

The limitations of Moore’s law, which predicted the exponential increase over time of the 

number of components in integrated circuits,[6] have led to a high demand for alternatives 

in the field of microelectronics. Indeed, since 2007 the International Technology Roadmap 

for Semiconductors [7] has been addressing the concept of functional diversification under 

the title “More than Moore”. As a consequence, the combination of the miniaturization of 

the components (Moore’s law) and the use of novel material architectures (“More than 

Moore”) makes possible the integration of digital and non-digital functionalities into 

compact systems. Within this context multiferroics hold great promise.

Multiferroics combine simultaneously at least two of the three ferroic properties: 

ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity.[8–11] The magnetoelectric 

multiferroics offer the ability of magnetic field manipulation via electric fields or vice 

versa. A wide range of applications, such as information storage, sensing, actuation and 

spintronics, await pioneering strategies of producing robust magnetoelectric coupling at 

room temperature.[11]  

 

 

Figure 2.2 Schematic simplification of the electric-driven magnetic recording mechanism 

in magnetic hard disk drive (adapted from Hu et al.[12]). 

 

Data storage, probably the most crucial battlefield of the tough and consuming 

expedition for miniaturization, is mainly focused on the development of Ferroelectric and 

Magnetic Random Access Memories (FeRAMs and MRAMs respectively), which have 

limited efficiencies.[13] The use of multiferroics can provide electrically written and 

magnetically read devices, thus faster, low-energy consumption and with a non-destructive 

magnetic read operation. 

In Figure 2.2, we can observe a simplified example of a magnetoelectric device on 

a magnetic hard drive disk. By the application of an electric field E, opposite 

magnetization domains are formed on the magnetic hard drive disk, corresponding to 0-1 

magnetic bits.[12] 

In Figure 2.3, a Magnetoelectric Random Access Memory (MERAM) is presented, 

where an electric field E is applied on the magnetoelectric material (blue), inducing a 

magnetic moment ?mME which provides a magnetic flux density B through a magnetic 

phase (grey).[14] A magnetic ‘’bit’’ is written on the moving track of the hard disk, which 

has a constant velocity v. Switching of the magnetization direction corresponds to opposite 

orientations, thus 0-1 magnetic bit configuration.

Lastly, lead-based compounds, due to their excellent ferroelectric properties, have 

dominated the electronics field through the years. However, lead’s high toxicity, in 

combination with the lack of device recycling, leads to contamination of the soil, air, water 

and the human and animal population. High levels of lead concentration in the human body 

can provoke a series of complications, culminating with madness. In addition, lead 

exposure is very dangerous for children, since it affects the neurodevelopment and it can 

even provoke lowering of the IQ.[15] For these reasons, the European Union, in 1 July of 

2006, banned the use of lead in some electronic equipment, under the Restriction of 

Hazardous Substances.[16] Therefore, a significant support to a global environmental 

consciousness has been made lately, propelling a generalized search for lead-free materials 

for electronic applications.

 Ferroelectrics 2.2

Ferroelectrics correspond to insulating systems, which present two or more stable 

or metastable states of nonzero electric polarization in the absence of electric field, known 

as spontaneous polarization.[17–20] The polarization in a bulk or film is organized in 

domains and, by reversing the applied electric field, switching of the domains’ orientation 

takes place. For a finite system, the polarization simply corresponds to the charge density, 

while for infinite crystalline structures, is the result of the integrated current through the 

transformation of one variant to another, else known as Berry phase. Ferroelectrics belong 

to 10 polar point groups, a subcategory of the 20 non-centrosymmetric piezoelectric point 

groups.[17]  

The ferroelectric phenomenon was firstly observed by Valasek in 1920.[19] 

Initially, the research was limited to the study of hydrogen-bonded materials, such as 

Rochelle salt (Potassium Sodium Tartrate (KNaC4H6O6.4H2O)) and Monopotassium 

Phosphate (KH2PO4). In 1949, Barium Titanate’s (BaTiO3) ferroelectric properties were 

discovered and the route for understanding ferroelectricity was simplified.  

There are various groups of materials that present ferroelectric properties. To name 

a few: perovskites (BaTiO3, PbTiO3, BiFeO3, SrTiO3), trigonal paraelectrics (LiNbO3), 

layered oxide ferroelectrics (Aurivillius phases consisting of layered bismuth oxides), other 

ferroelectric oxide families (tungsten bronzes, boracites), magnetic ferroelectric oxides 

(hexagonal manganites, such as YMnO3), electronic ferroelectrics (BaBiO3, LuFeO4, 

YFeO4) and ferroelectric polymers (PVDF, liquid crystals).[17]

Figure 2.4 Displacement of cation B in the perovskite structure ABO3 and the respective 

double-well potential of the two polarization states.[21] 

However, the most widely studied and used class of ferroelectrics in industry are 

the perovskites. Their structure is ABO3, having cation A at the corners of the unit cell, B 

at the centre and O at the midpoint of each edge, creating an oxygen octahedra net, with B 

at the centre of each one of them (Figure 2.4). Not all perovskites present ferroelectric 

properties, since the latter are intimately linked with the size and position of the oxygen 

octahedra. The ion fitting in a perovskite unit cell can be calculated by Eq.1, known as 

Goldschmid tolerance factor t, which corresponds to the ionic distance between cation A 

and its closest oxygen divided by the length of the octahedral edge: 

    
     

? (     )
                 Eq. 1 

where rA, rB and rO are the radii of the A, B and O ions respectively.[17] Depending on the 

ionic radii, Eq. 1 yields three cases: cubic structure for t?1, hexagonal structures with small 

polar distortion for t&gt;1 and orthorhombic or rhombohedral structures with strong polar 

distortion for t&lt;1. As seen in Figure 2.4, the vertical displacement of central cation B 

breaks the symmetry of the cubic structure and, by changing the distribution of charge in 

the unit cell, provokes polarization.[21] The double-well potential, also shown in Figure 

2.4, presents the two stable states (lower energy states) of the spontaneous polarization. 



CHAPTER 2 State of the Art

An important characteristic of ferroelectrics is the hysteretic behaviour of 

polarization with the application of an electric field.[22,23] In Figure 2.5, an almost ideal 

case of hysteresis loop is presented. As the electric field is increased, polarization increases 

until a certain value, which corresponds to the saturation polarization PS. By removal of the 

bias voltage, a large part of the polarized regions maintain their distorted positions and, 

subsequently, at zero field a remanent polarization PR is reached. The same behaviour is 

followed for the case of negative bias. The two points where the hysteresis loop meets the 

voltage axis correspond to the forward and reverse coercive voltages, V
+
 and V

-
 

respectively. High values of the coercive field account for easily polarizable materials, 

which retain their polarization. Finally, the area of the loop provides the work necessary 

for polarization switching.[22]

The two axes represent the applied voltage V and the resulting polarization P. PS and PR 

correspond to the saturation and remanent polarization, whereas V

and reverse coercive voltage.[22]

 Ferromagnetics 2.3

The magnetic behaviour of matter, thus attraction or repulsion of some materials by 

others, owes its origin to the existence of magnetic moments throughout various material 

structures.[24] Magnetic moments could be described as small magnets, with polar 

character. As known by classical electromagnetism, movement of electrically charged 

elements generates magnetic fields. Therefore, the origin of magnetization (accumulation 

of magnetic moments in a material) is the orbiting and spinning electrons of the atoms 

(Figure 2.6).  

 

Figure 2.6 The two different origins of magnetic moment: (a) Orbiting electron and (b) 

Electron spin.[24] 

Ferromagnetism is one of the five different existing magnetic behaviours of matter: 

diamagnetism, paramagnetism, antiferromagnetism, ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism, 

as shown in Figure 2.7 (diamagnetism is not included since no magnetic moments are 

present with absence of magnetic field).[24,25] Ferromagnets owe their elevated and 

spontaneous magnetization to aligned magnetic dipoles, which maintain their orientation 

even when no magnetic field is applied. Paramagnetic materials reveal randomly oriented 

magnetic moments, thus an approximately zero macroscopic magnetization, which at the 

presence of a magnetic field are rotated and aligned, resulting in increase of magnetization. 

Antiferromagnetism corresponds to a zero overall magnetization, since cancellation of the 

equally distributed antiparallel magnetic moments occurs (Figure 2.7). Lastly, 

ferrimagnetic behaviour is similar to the antiferromagnetic, however, since different ion 



CHAPTER 2 State of the Art

types originate the magnetic moments, conferring them different magnitudes, total 

magnetization is non-zero. 

 

Figure 2.7 The different magnetic states of matter: paramagnetic, antiferromagnetic, 

ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic.[25] 

 

Like in ferroelectrics, hysteresis loop is an unbreakable proof of the ferromagnetic 

character. In Figure 2.8, magnetic induction B (corresponds to the magnetic flux density 

and is linearly related to the magnetization M) is presented as a function of the magnetic 

field H for a ferromagnet and a ferrimagnet.[25] Both loops have hysteretic character. 

Initially, for zero magnetic field the magnetization is zero. With the increase of H, 

alignment of magnetic moments results in the increase of B, reaching a saturation point BS, 

when no further alignment is possible. The reverse process provokes a small decrease in B, 

however it never reaches zero, having instead a significant residual magnetization Br at 

H=O. For negative orientation of H, one gets negative orientation of B. The coercive 

magnetic field HC corresponds to the point at which magnetization is switched, therefore 

higher HC means high resistance in demagnetization. The outer loop, presenting larger BS, 

Br and HC, corresponds to a ferromagnet and the inner one to a ferrimagnet, since magnetic 

moment cancellation attenuates magnetic behaviour, as discussed above.

magnetic induction, Bs and Br respectively) and a ferrimagnetic material (inner curve, low 

saturation and residual magnetic induction, Bs and Br respectively).[25] 

 

 A large variety of ferromagnetic materials have been studied and used for various 

applications. Apart from the conventional pure metals (Fe, Co, Ni) and rare-earth magnets, 

a series of compounds present significant ferromagnetic properties, such as the alloy 

TbDyFe2 (Terfenol-D), the spinels ?-Fe2O3, CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4, the corundum ?-Fe2O3, 

the manganites LaSrMnO3 and LaCaMnO3 and the magnetic semiconductors, like ZnO and 

GaN.[9,26]

 Multiferroics 2.4

Ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity are defined by switching of the 

alignment of electric dipole-moment, electron spin and strain via electric, magnetic and 

stress fields, respectively.[11]  

Multiferroic materials combine at least two of these three properties.[8–12,27] 

However, apart from this multifunctional character, multiferroics present the remarkable 

phenomenon of coupling the different properties, in a sense that the stimulating fields 

(electric, magnetic and stress) can also provoke the manifestation of the responses which 

do not correspond to their counterparts (Figure 2.9). Consequently, an electric field E can 

induce strain ? or magnetization M, a magnetic field B polarization P or strain ?, and, 

finally, stress field ? polarization P or magnetization M, certainly depending on the 

material characteristics.  

 

Figure 2.9 Representation of multiferroicity concept, with the different cases of coupling 

that can occur by the presence of the three different fields: electric, magnetic and 

stress.[27] 

2.4.1 Single-phase 

Magnetoelectric multiferroics correspond to the coupling of ferroelectricity and 

ferromagnetism. In single-phase magnetoelectrics, the multiferroic behaviour is dominated 

by the linear magnetoelectric effect. In mathematical terms, partial derivation of the free 

energy of a material F (given by Eq. 2) over the electric E and magnetic field H, results in

dielectric and magnetic susceptibilities respectively, ?ij the linear magnetoelectric 

coefficient and ?ijk and ?ijk third-order tensor coefficients.[27,28] The latter also can 

manifest magnetoelectric effect, however of smaller range. The linear magnetoelectric 

coefficient ?ij corresponds to magnetic field-induced polarization or electric field-induced 

magnetization, as shown in Eq. 5: 

    
   

   
 
   

   
               Eq. 5 

However, contradictory theories concerning their basic physics principles result in 

a very limited number of magnetoelectrics in nature.[9,11] The main reason for that fact is 

that ferroelectric properties require strong insulators, whereas ferromagnets are principally 

conducting metals. Additionally, symmetry breaking in ferroelectrics, thus polarization, is 

provided by the empty d shells, whereas partially filled d orbitals of transition metals are 

responsible for magnetization. Intensive research is being made since the 70s, which has 

led to a series of recipes for single phase multiferroics.  

The most studied case is the perovskite bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3), which falls in the 

wider group of materials that combine two different cation types with the properties 

mentioned above. Another group is that of the non-centrosymmetric magnetic ordering 

which leads to the rise of polarization, even with the presence of atomic 

centrosymmetricity, such as chromium chrysoberyl (Cr2BeO4), terbium manganite 

(TbMnO3), as well as the manganites TbMn2O5 and Ca3CoMnO6. A combination of polar 

tilts and rotations of the anionic sublattice which occurs in rare-earth manganites and in 



CHAPTER 2 State of the Art 

16 

 

barium nickel fluoride (BaNiF4), also results in symmetry breaking, thus induction of 

polarization. Finally, attempts to provoke off-centering structures for cations with partially 

filled d orbitals have been made via epitaxial strain.[11] 

2.4.2 Composites 

Due to the limited number of single-phase multiferroics, great efforts have been 

made in order to develop composites, whose two or more components will present the 

desired properties. It has been proved that the magnetoelectric coupling effect in 

multiferroic composites can be significantly enhanced.[29–34] The architecture of these 

composites is mainly based in three different heterostructures: horizontal, vertical and 

particulate (Figure 2.10).[8,9]  

 

Figure 2.10 Illustration of the three multiferroic composite heterostructures: (a) 

Particulate, (b) Horizontal and (c) Vertical.[8] 

In the last years, aiming at higher efficiencies and smaller dimensions, the scientific 

community has focused particularly on nanostructures, decreasing the thickness and 

increasing the interfaces between the two components. Therefore, as discussed in Section 

2.5.3, surface anisotropies together with coupled properties of composites’ components, 

such as piezoelectricity and magnetostriction, can produce gigantic magnetoelectric 

coefficients. Recently, Jahns et al.[35] presented a bilayer heterostructure of Aluminium 

Nitride (AIN) and FeCoSiB coumpound, whose magnetoelectric coefficient reached the 

value of 9.7 kV/cm?Oe, the highest measurement ever recorded at normal pressure. 

For such heterostructures, a series of ferroelectric (BaTiO3, PbTiO3, Pb(Zr,Ti)O3, 

BiFeO3) and ferromagnetic (CoFe2O4, NiFe2O4, ?-Fe2O3) materials have been combined. 

However, due to the toxic character of lead-based compounds,[15–17] despite their 

excellent ferroelectric properties, more and more research groups are searching for lead-

free solutions.

 Bismuth Ferrite: The Model Multiferroic 2.5

BiFeO3 (BFO) is the only single-phase multiferroic, presenting simultaneously 

magnetic and ferroelectric order at room temperature, thus, as mentioned above, is the 

most studied.[9,11,36–38] It exhibits a strong ferroelectric behaviour, however the 

apparent antiferromagnetic order of magnetic moments results in weak magnetic response. 

Concerning its chemical behaviour, BFO is a metastable and off-stoichiometric compound, 

easily forming secondary phases, like Bi2O3, Bi2Fe4O9 and sillenite Bi25FeO39.[36] 

 

 

Figure 2.11 Bismuth Ferrite unit cell structure with the oxygen octahedra rotation and the 

Fe ion shifting.[39] 

2.5.1 Ferroelectricity 

BFO owes its ferroelectric properties to the two distorted perovskite blocks, 

connected along the pseudocubic-[111], building a rhombohedral unit cell (Figure 2.11). A 

clockwise and a counterclockwise rotation of the two oxygen octahedra connected along 

the [111], as well as a shift of the Fe ion also along the [111], are responsible for 

conferring spontaneous polarization. The Godschmid tolerance factor (Section 0) for BFO 

is equal to 0.88, which yields a rhombohedral or orthorhombic symmetry. BFO’s 

ferroelectric Curie temperature, or else the temperature at which the ferroelectric to 

paraelectric transition takes place, corresponds to 1100 K.[37,38] 

BFO’s piezoelectric constant (d33) is substantially low, reaching a maximum of 

approximately 100?C/cm
2
, whereas other perovskites extend to 100-1000?C/cm

2
. The 



CHAPTER 2 State of the Art 

18 

 

reason for the presence of such a large difference is BFO’s small dielectric constant at 

room temperature, which corresponds to approximately 30. This can be easily understood 

by the definition of the effective piezoelectric coefficient, as shown in Eq. 6: 

 

   
   

 
  

  
 

  

  

  

  
                  Eq. 6 

 

where s, P, E, Q and ? stand for strain, polarization, electric field, electrostrictive 

coefficient and dielectric constant respectively. 

Since the value of Q does not diverge much from the ones of other perovskites, 

dielectric constant accounts for such behaviour. The dielectric constant evaluation is 

inseparably linked with polarizability measurements. The relatively small electric fields 

required for dielectric measurements cannot affect the highly saturated polarization at 

room temperature, due to the elevated Curie temperature of BFO (1100K). Another 

assumption coming from experimental results places emphasis on the possible existence of 

a difference between the A-site and B-site cation originated polarizations, with the A-site 

case present at BFO being the lower.[37]  

This relatively small piezoelectric coefficient is also responsible for the weak 

contribution of strain-induced polarization in epitaxially grown BFO thin films. As a result, 

an increase in effective piezoelectric coefficient with increasing film thickness is observed 

(Figure 2.12).
 
[29]

epitaxially grown BiFeO3 thin films.[29] 



  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art 

19 

 

Finally, the [111] oriented polarization in BFO is bound to switching by the 

application of an external electrical field. There are three possible rotations: 71
o
, 109

o
 and 

180
o
 (Figure 2.13). The first two also result in the rotation of the antiferromagnetic planes, 

hence providing evidence for a magnetoelectric behaviour. The antiparallel case of 180
o
 

for symmetry reasons maintains the initial magnetic ordering. Zhao et al.[40] and 

Zavaliche et al.[41] showed the influence of polarization rotation in the antiferromagnetic 

domains, by the combination of Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) and 

Photoemission Electron Microscopy (PEEM) techniques. 

 

Figure 2.13 The three possible rotations of polarization orientation in BiFeO3 by the 

application of an external electric field.[40] 

2.5.2 Phase Transitions 

A great polemic prevails over the complex matter of phase transitions occurring in 

the BiFeO3 structure. BFO’s crystallographic structure determine both its ferroelectric and 

magnetic properties, often in a way that the cause becomes the effect and vice-versa. This 

entanglement of causality, in combination with BFO’s intricate magnetic behaviour and the 

presence of impurities, hinders the characterization process.[37,42] 

The different BFO phases already observed and proposed by a series of techniques 

are: rhombohedral, orthorhombic, monoclinic and cubic. The ground phase, or referred to 

as ?-phase, corresponds to a rhombohedral crystal system (R3c). A ferroelectric to 

paraelectric transition at 825 
o
C (~1100 K) is clearly detected, presenting simultaneously 

an impulsive volume contraction. However, the nature of this apparent ?-phase remains in 

question. Apart from the relatively safe agreement of the community for a centrosymmetric 



CHAPTER 2 State of the Art 

20 

 

structure, the majority of X-Ray and Neutron Diffraction studies incline towards a mixed 

rhombohedral-orthorhombic phase. Propositions for the presence of tetragonal or 

pseudotetragonal systems are mainly rejected due to the observed domain structure. 

Furthermore, the monoclinic case argument does not agree with the XRD patterns and the 

most controversial rhombohedral symmetry retainment through the ?-? transition is 

precluded by the occurrence of ferroelastic transition. The higher-temperature ?-phase 

presents a cubic symmetry, though usually obscured by the presence of parasitic phases, 

such as Bi2Fe4O9 and Fe2O3. Lastly, anomalies reported in dielectric constant 

measurements reveal low-temperature (50 K and 200 K) weak coupling, probably of 

magnetic or magnetoelastic nature, as well as a possible magnetoelectric coupling at 370 

o
C (30

o
C bellow antiferromagnetic Néel temperature 673 K). 

A proposition of the possible phase transitions as a function of temperature and 

pressure occurring in BiFeO3 is presented in Figure 2.14. A coincidence in the sequence of 

the main occurring transitions (rhombohedral ? orthorhombic ? cubic) can be observed 

both for temperature and pressure increase. There is a slight rise of the antiferromagnetic 

Néel temperature with increasing pressure.

pressure. Solid points correspond to experimental data. Blue region presents the 

ferroelectric rhombohedral phase (R3c). Light red region represents the paraelectric ?-

the less supported monoclinic. White region shows the cubic ?-phase and along the black-

2.5.3 Magnetism 

A combination of various scenarios seems to give rise to the complex magnetic 

behaviour of BFO. 

One of the most widely accepted theories is that of G-type antiferromagnetic 

ordering, resulting from the ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically ordered Fe 

magnetic moments along the [111] axis and between the adjacent planes, respectively 

(Figure 2.15(a)).[37,43] BFO’s antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition happens at 

the antiferromagnetic Néel temperature of 673K.

Most studies are based on Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which corresponds to 

the spin-exchange accompanied by spin-orbit coupling, leading to canting of the magnetic 

sublattices.[43] The latter phenomenon together with the rotation of the oxygen octahedra

yields weak macroscopic ferromagnetism. The lattice distortion impact on BFO’s 

ferromagnetic character can be also understood by the relatively low Godschmid tolerance 

factor (Section 2.5.1), a fact that allows for buckling of the oxygen octahedra, hence 

change in the angle between Fe-O-Fe.[37]  

Another proposal for the apparent magnetic activity in BFO, first published by 

Sosnowska et al.[45], is the presence of a cycloidal spin arrangement of the 

antiferromagnetic sublattices, following a wavelength period of 64nm and propagating 

perpendicularly to [111] pseudocubic axis (Figure 2.15(b)). Suppression of the cycloidal 

spin structure, due to epitaxial strain in thin films[43] or grain-particle size[3,4,46,47], can 

lead to the emergence of uncompensated magnetic moments. In addition, this long-range 

superstructure can result in the induction of an additional polarization, giving rise to 

magnetoelectric coupling.[44] As shown in (Figure 2.15(c)), a rotation by 71
o
 in 

polarization orientation can result in change in the magnetic cycloid plane, providing 

strong evidence for magnetoelectric coupling. In bulk architectures cycloid spin structure 

can induce canting angles of 2.25
o
, introducing a significant contribution to the overall 

magnetoelectric effect. In thin films, cycloidal magnetic moment order appears to result in 

smaller canting angles (~0.2
o
), leaving Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya interactions accounting for 

coupling manifestation.

domain wall thickness x.[48] 



  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art 

23 

 

Furthermore, ferroelectric domain walls appear to play an important role to 

magnetization generation, as shown by Privratska et al.[49] and later by Darakrchiev et 

al..[48] The symmetry breaking and lack of homogeneity in domain walls can produce 

significant spontaneous magnetization (Figure 2.16). This fact is accentuated by the 

considerable occupying volume fraction of walls in thin films, due to smaller grain sizes. 

In addition, Kay-Dunn law reveals a power dependence between the domain wall thickness 

d and the resulting coercive electric field E, as can be seen in Eq. 7: 

       
 
 

                Eq. 7 

 

As wall thickness decreases, higher fields are generated and the anisotropy degree is 

substantially increased, hence enhanced magnetoelectric coupling can occur. 

Finally, as mentioned above, any anisotropy may lead to the rise of magnetism, 

among which the megnetocrystalline, surface and shape related are the most 

important.[50,51] For the case of thin films, perpendicular surface anisotropy can be 

responsible for ferromagnetic ordering, even for antiferromagnetic materials. Surface 

influence in anisotropy is much stronger than that caused by volume fractions, a solid 

explication for the comparable magnetizations observed between bulk and thin films. 

Wang et al.[29] in 2003, showed that magnetization increases with decreasing film 

thickness in BFO thin films.

 The Strategy for Porous Thin Film Preparation 2.6

2.6.1 Sol-gel Process 

A plethora of thin film preparation techniques has been developed over the years, 

such as Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), Pulsed Layer Deposition (PLD), Radio 

Frequency Sputtering (RFS), Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOC-VD), 

Chemical Solution Deposition (CSD), to name a few.[9] The latter corresponds to a simple 

and cost-effective chemical method and consists of the preparation of a solution and its 

subsequent deposition on a substrate.  

The sol-gel process, one if the CSD methods, corresponds to the hydrolysis of 

inorganic or metal organic reactive precursors in aqueous or organic solvents, followed by 

condensation reactions, which result in the so-called gel.[38,52,53] 

Sol is a colloidal suspension of well dispersed solid particles in a liquid.[54] Due to 

the small dimensions of the dispersed phase, Van der Waals forces and surface charge 

interactions surpass the gravitational field influence. Gel corresponds to a porous three-

dimensional solid network and, depending on the medium that fills the pores, it can be 

aquagel, hydrogel, alcogel, aerogel or cryogel. The various steps of the sol-gel procedure 

are the following: preparation of a homogeneous solution, conversion to sol, gel formation 

(polycondensation), gel shaping (thin films, fibres, spheres or grains) and sintering.[54] 

For the case of a metal alkoxide M(OR)n with valence n, the following reactions 

take place: 

 

M(OR)n + H2O ? M(OR)n-1 OH + ROH           (Hydrolysis) 

M(OR)n-1 OH+ M(OR)n ? (RO)n-1 M-O-M (OR)n-1 + ROH    (Condensation) 

 

The first reaction corresponds to the hydrolysis of the alkoxy groups and the second one to 

the polycondensation. The result is a gel with a mixture of weakly bonded polymers and 

highly condensed particles.[53] 



  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art 

25 

 

2.6.2 Dip-coating Deposition 

Some of the deposition techniques for the preparation of thin films are spray-

coating, meniscus-coating, dip-coating and spin-coating.[55] One of the most widely used 

is dip-coating, mainly due to its simplicity, the ability of producing homogenous films with 

controlled thickness, the lack of waste and, certainly, its low-cost.[52,53,56] 

For film deposition via dip-coating, the substrate is dipped into the sol-gel and 

subsequently withdrawn at a constant speed.[56] Since sol-gel’s nature is non-newtonian, 

evaporation of the solvents takes place during deposition, which is determinant for the film 

formation. Many factors are influenced by the evaporation mode, such as viscosity, 

density, surface tension, pH and local accumulation of precursors. Another important 

factor that necessitates scholastic control is the hydrolysis and condensation reaction 

kinetics taking place throughout the whole procedure, until the final heat treatment, which 

affect the degree of condensation, the density and the species’ structure. 

In Figure 2.18 (a), one can observe the gradual evaporation of the solvents, the 

formation of meniscus and the decrease of the film thickness, during the deposition. 

Although, phenomenologically, we expect an increase in the thickness by increasing 

withdrawal velocity due to draining phenomenon, in reality, there are two regimes that 

govern the process: a capillary/evaporation regime for very low withdrawal velocities and 

a draining/evaporation regime for higher values (Figure 2.18 (b, c)). The first behaviour is 

owing to capillary phenomena, which lead to a linear evaporation, thus obstruction of 

otherwise expected draining.

Faustini et al.[56] conducted a comparison between an experimental procedure 

(using a sol-gel derived from the mixture of tetraethyl and methyltriethyl orthosilicates 

with Pluronic F127 copolymer), a capillarity model and a draining model, as shown in 

Figure 2.19. There is a very good correlation between the experimental results and the 

combination of the two models incorporating the capillary and draining regimes.

2.6.3 Evaporation Self-Induced Assembly (EISA) 

There are various chemical and physical methods for the induction of porosity in 

thin films, however, Evaporation Induced Self-Assembly (EISA) is one of the most 

popular, owing to its simplicity and rapid production of patterned pores.[57–59] EISA is 

based on the use of micellar and lyotropic liquid-crystal phases, which act as templates, 

regulating the nucleation, growth, morphology and orientation of inorganic crystals, and, 

after evaporation during the thermal treatment, eventually, they form periodically 

organised porous structures.[55,57,60]  

As shown in Figure 2.20, there are 4 main steps during the EISA process: solvent 

evaporation, which ends with the gel formation, water equilibrium, mesostructuration, 

which result in the hybrid organic/inorganic structure and, finally, condensation through 

treatment and removal of the templates. Throughout the whole procedure, overlapping of 

the different stages might occur. 

 

Figure 2.20 Schematic illustration of the different steps occurring through the evaporation-

induced self-assembly for the formation of mesoporous structures.[55] 

 



CHAPTER 2 State of the Art 

28 

 

The templates consist of hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts. The hydrophilic tails 

are selectively brought in contact with water, bringing the hydrophobic ones shielded 

within the spherical or cylindrical micelle. 

By increasing the templates molecular weight and, as the critical micelle 

concentration has been exceeded, spherical and cylindrical micelles are formed, thus 

different pore sizes can be produced (Figure 2.21). Further increasing of the templates 

concentration, periodic hexagonal, cubic or lamellar structures can be achieved.[57]

 Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) 2.7

Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM), currently one of the most popular 

techniques of ferroelectrics’ characterization via Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM), 

allows a nondestructive visualization of domain structures at the nanoscale in thin films 

and bulk materials. 

2.7.1 Historical Review 

The historical starting point for the wider family of Scanning Probe Microscopy 

takes place in 1981, with the invention of Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) by Gerd 

Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer, to whom subsequently the Nobel Prize in Physics was 

attributed in 1986 for their so-called “candid cameras of the nanoworld”.[61,62] STM’s 

function is based on the quantum-mechanical phenomenon of electron tunnelling, 

occurring by the application of a relatively small electric potential between an atomically 

sharp conducting tip and the surface of a conducting or semi-conducting sample. By 

measuring the resulting current of those electrons that manage to overcome the barrier, the 

topography of the sample surface can be given down to atomic resolution. In 1990, the 

world’s smallest logo was created by such a microscope. I.B.M.’s initials were formed by 

arranging 35 individual xenon atoms (Figure 2.22).[63] That was the moment that the 

message was passed along even outside the scientific community and “sneaking” into the 

atomic world became “messing” with the actual atoms!

atoms, by the use of Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) (image published in 1990 by 

Eigler &amp;amp; Schweizer in Nature [63], but artistically adapted by IBM Research [64]). 



CHAPTER 2 State of the Art 

30 

 

However, STM’s limitation to conducting and semi-conducting materials, lead to 

the development of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), in 1986 by Binnig et al..[65] This 

time the basic functioning principle is even simpler, since the only measurement is the 

deflection of the tip as it passes over the sample surface, therefore no conduction is needed 

and the range of materials is substantially widened, particularly for the ample field of 

biomolecular analysis. Different modes have been developed since, such as contact, non-

contact and tapping mode, to mention the most important ones, depending on the material 

and the properties in question. 

In 1991, Birk et al. publish the first measurements made by Piezoresponse Force 

Microscopy (PFM) for Vinylidenefluoride Trifluoroethylene (VDF-TrFE) thin films.[66] 

In 1992, Guthner et al. refer to a new ferroelectric storage technique (write-read) by local 

poling, as well as the crucial ferroelectric domain size effect due to tip geometry and film 

thickness. However, the systematic studies carried out by Gruverman et al.[67,68] 

highlight the importance and utility of PFM technique for a profound insight into the 

ferroelectric behaviour of materials. 

2.7.2 Principles of Operation 

PFM technique is based on a very simple method, yet without preventing high 

accuracy and reliability. The general idea derives from the principles of inverse 

piezoelectric effect, or else the conversion of electrical energy to mechanical. In that way, 

the measurement is realized by detecting the electromechanical interaction between the 

sample surface and a conductive tip, induced by the application of an external ac 

voltage.[67,68]  

AFM technique is grounded in Hooke’s law and the oscillatory behaviour of the 

force sensor, which consists of two parts: a cantilever-type spring with position parallel to 

the sample surface and a sharp tip placed at the edge of the cantilever perpendicularly to 

both surface and cantilever (Figure 2.23 (a, b)). A laser beam is deflected on the top-side 

of the cantilever and, subsequently collected by a Position Sensor Detector (PSD), usually 

a quadrupole-electrode geometry photodiode (Figure 2.23 (c)). The detection precision 

corresponds to sub-Å scale. A piezoelectric scanner with nanometric precision is 

responsible for the sample movement relative to the tip, allowing for lateral and vertical 



  CHAPTER 2 State of the Art 

31 

 

movements. In order to achieve a topography image, the cantilever deflection must be kept 

constant. 

 

Figure 2.23 (a) Schematic illustration of cantilever-tip geometry and position. Red dashed 

line represents the laser deflection on the Position Sensing Detector (PSD). Fdefl, Fbuck and 

Ftor are the forces which result in tip’s deflection, buckling and torsion effects respectively. 

(b) Cantilever’s vertical deflection, buckling and torsion effects. (c) Vertical (caused by 

Fdefl and Fbuck) and lateral (Ftor) signals of cantilever movement detected by a quadrupole-

electrode geometry of the detector (PSD).[69] 

 As mentioned above, there are various AFM modes for the obtainment of different 

information. For the case of piezoelectricity, contact mode is necessary for sensing the 

vibration of the sample surface. Surface reaction to the applied field is characterized by 

short-range repulsive interatomic forces, thus the contact requirement, unlike the non-

contact case, intended for the detection of long-range interactions, such as magnetic, 

electrostatic and Van der Waals.[68] 

 The external voltage applied between the tip and the surface consists of a dc and an 

ac component, as shown in Eq. 8: 

                                        Eq. 8 

where ? is the frequency of ac component. A lock-in technique is used to modulate the 

output signal, in a sense that topographic and piezoresponse signals to be separated, 

providing the two images simultaneously. For a homogeneously polarized material, the 

vertical displacement under voltage V, as a function of the piezoelectric and 

electrostrictive coefficients, d33 and Q33 respectively can be expressed as: 



CHAPTER 2 State of the Art 

32 

 

         
   

 
              Eq. 9 

where t is the sample thickness.[70] Since lock-in technique does not measure the dc 

component, the vertical displacement ?z via Eq. 8 becomes: 

         (       )   
    

 
      (       )           Eq. 10 

where ? the phase difference between the ac input and the piezoreponse output signal, 

related to the polarization direction.[20] Eq. 10, corresponds to the first harmonics of the 

signal and its first part is linked to the piezoelectric effect. The second part, as well as the 

second harmonics can be neglected, since they are basically related to the electrostrictive 

effect, which is much weaker and it only produces a dc offset. Thus, a PFM image is 

composed by: 

             (    )           Eq. 11 

Depending on the information in question, both mapping of amplitude d33Vac and phase ? 

can be conducted. 

 A series of reasons have established PFM technique as one of the most accepted 

and popular methods for the investigation of piezoelectric properties. Firstly, its high 

spatial resolution, lack of special sample preparation and normal conditions operation lead 

to cost and time-effective studies. In addition, its high vertical sensitivity prevents any 

destructive considerations. A variety of phenomena linked with piezoelectric behaviour 

can be easily studied, such as switching mechanisms, writing-reading in micrometric scale, 

microstructure-domain correlation, domain wall investigation and degradation effects. 

Importantly, as mentioned before, it gives the opportunity of a simultaneous representation 

of the surface topography and the piezoelectric response. By choosing the adequate 

cantilever-tip, one can work with a wide range of surface roughness and hardness. 

Furthermore, contact mode is not susceptible to screening effects, usually caused by charge 

absorption when non-conduct, hence no veiling of domain mapping can occur. It should be 

mentioned that PFM imaging is favourably used for thin film characterization than bulk 

cases, due to lack of uniformity of the applied electric field. Lastly, the ability of 

measuring piezoelectric properties locally at a nanoscale provides an insight to more 

complicated structures, such as polycrystalline or inhomogeneous samples.[67,68,71]

2.7.3 PFM Studies of Bismuth Ferrite 

BFO’s good ferroelectric behaviour, and most importantly its large remanent 

polarization, allows for extended studies via PFM technique. Compared to pure 

ferroelectrics, BFO’s multiferroic character induces bigger domains, due to 

magnetoelectric coupling occurring at the domain walls.[48,72]  

Three main domain structures have been observed in BFO thin films by the use of 

PFM technique. For film thicknesses of about a few hundreds of nanometres, the domain 

patterns are mostly striped (Figure 2.24 (a)). However, decrease in the thickness originates 

an irregular domain structure, accompanied by a fractal configuration along the domain 

walls (Figure 2.24 (b)). Mosaic-like structures are observed by domain imaging of 

polycrystalline samples, such as films deposited via sol-gel method (Figure 2.24 (c)).[73]  

   

Figure 2.24 The three main domain structures observed by PFM in BFO thin films: (a) 

Striped and (b) irregular domains in epitaxially grown thin and ultrathin films 

respectively,[37] and (c) mosaic-like in polycrystaline sol-gel deposited thin film.[73] 

As mentioned in Section 2.5.1, the three polarization rotations, taking place by the 

application of the electric field, were studied by Zavaliche et al.[32,74] and are presented 

in Figure 2.25. In-plane PFM images show a higher contrast between the domains, due to 

polarization orientation. An external dc electric field of -12V magnitude was applied to the 

samples. The dark square in Figure 2.25 (b) denotes the poled area, thus much more 

intense in the out-of-plane imaging. Relevant pattern can be observed also for the 

respective in-plane piezoeresponse in Figure 2.25 (c). In Figure 2.25 (c, d, e) we can see 

clearly the three polarization rotations: P1

Magnetic Force Microscopy is based on a combination of tapping and non-contact 

mode, for topography and magnetic response mapping of the same area, by the use of 

magnetically coated conductive tips. However, unlike PFM technique, the two images are 

not taken simultaneously. The tip after taking the tapping signal of one scanning line, 

draws further from the surface in order to detect magnetic interactions.  

Unfortunately, the antiferromagnetic nature of BFO makes impossible the 

visualization of magnetic domains via Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM). Nevertheless, 

the magnetoelectric coupling in composite heterostructures, such as the ferromagnetic 

CoFe2O4 nanopilars in BiFeO3 matrix shown in Figure 2.26, is of great interest and it 

produces good description of magnetic domains, originated by the nanopilars, and their 

switching under dc bias of -16V.

 Dense Films 3.1

The preparation of dense films basically aims at obtaining means of comparison 

and reference point for the properties of porous films, which is naturally the main subject 

of this work. Although during the whole procedure of this work, a series of approaches to 

prepare dense films have been conducted, the most effective one will be reported. 

For the obtainment of the dense films, three main steps were followed: i) sol-gel 

preparation, ii) dip-coating deposition, and iii) drying and annealing (Figure 3.2). 

 

 

Figure 3.2 Flow diagram for the preparation of dense films. 

3.1.1 Sol-gel Process 

For the preparation of the sols the following reagents were used: bismuth (III) 

nitrate pentahydrate (Aldrich, purity ?98%), iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate (Aldrich, purity 

98%), 2-methoxyethanol (Aldrich, purity 99.8%) and pluronic F127 copolymer (Polymer 

Source, purity 100%). The procedure was based on the strategy followed by Coondoo et 

al.[73], yet with some alterations. The sols were prepared with a concentration of 0.5 M, 

0.2 mL final volume and 1:1 stoichiometry for the two inorganic precursors, iron (III) 

nitrate nonahydrate  (Fe(NO3)3.9H2O) and bismuth (III) nitrate pentahydrate 

(Bi(NO3)3.5H2O). Each precursor was dissolved with 0.1 mL of 2-methoxyethanol 

(C3H8O2), left stirring for 30 min and subsequently the two solutions were mixed. The 

mixture was kept at constant stirring for 1 h, unlike the case of Coondoo et al. that propose 

a 24 h stirring. Both procedures were tested, however no differences were observed.

3.1.2 Dip-coating Deposition 

Dip-coating technique was used for the film deposition, mainly due to its 

simplicity, time and cost-efficiency, as well as the production of homogeneous thickness, 

as mentioned in Section 2.6.2. The same methodology was employed for dense and porous 

films. The dip-coater used for the deposition was from KSV, model DC/D/LM, adapted 

with a homemade drying chamber. 

Prior to the deposition step, the Pt(111)/TiO2/SiO2/Si(100) substrates were cut in 

rectangles of 2 cm x 1 cm and subsequently ultrasonically cleaned with ethanol (EtOH) 

and acetone during 10 min respectively. 

One of the main parameters studied for the preparation of the films was the drying 

temperature, employed to maximise the adhesion of the sol on the substrate. High 

temperature during the deposition, between 40 and 90 
o
C depending on the solvents in use, 

facilitates the solvent evaporation process, allowing for domination of the viscous drag 

upon gravity forces, thus inducing a faster growth of the film.[56] For that purpose, a 

temperature controller was adjusted to the dip-coater, in such way that the substrate would 



CHAPTER 3 Experimental Procedure

be under constant temperature along the entire withdrawal trajectory. After testing the 

deposition at 40, 50 and 70 
o
C, the last one was used, as it resulted in better adhesion for all 

the range of withdrawal velocities. 

Based on Faustini et al. studies [56], six different withdrawal velocities were used, 

as seen in Table 3.2. These values correspond to low, medium and high velocities. The 

purpose was to develop films with increasing thickness, as discussed in Section 4.1.

3.1.3 Drying and Annealing Process 

 A variety of drying and annealing profiles were studied, since preparing a dense 

structure without changing significantly the porous film-based recipe proved to be 

substantially difficult. Indeed, it was verified that the polymer used as adhesion regulator 

led to the formation of pores and cracks. Thus, a more controlled procedure for evaporation 

of solvents and polymer removal was followed.  

Apart from the temperature control during deposition, two drying steps were 

introduced before annealing. Immediately after the deposition, the film was placed on a 

hot-plate at 120 
o
C for 2 min and subsequently fired at 300 

o
C for 3 min.[73] Finally, the 

films were annealed at 550 
o
C for 5 min in air, in order to establish the required 

crystallization. As discussed in Sections 4.1 and 4.2.2, mainly due to dense-porous 

comparison reasons, the films were additionally annealed at 600 
o
C for 5 min.

 Porous Films 3.2

The porous thin film preparation procedure consists also of three main steps: i) sol-

gel process, ii) dip-coating deposition, and iii) annealing (Figure 3.3).  

 

Figure 3.3 Flow diagram for the preparation of porous thin films. 

 

3.2.1 Sol-gel Process 

The sol-gel process for the case of porous thin films differs from that of dense, 

principally due to the introduction of the templates, employed for the induction of porosity. 

Thus, the initial solutions for the inorganic precursors are prepared as for the dense case, 

yet with different quantities for solids and solvent (Table 3.3 and Table 3.4). 

The template used in this task is polystyrene-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) 

block copolymer, which consists of two polymer blocks, a hydrophilic (PEO) and a 

hydrophobic (PS). Its polymer molecular weight is 40,000 g/mol (PS) - 53,000 g/mol 

(PEO) (Polymer Source). The template dissolution was realized by the use of 

tetrahydrofuran (THF, Aldrich, purity ?99.5%) and ethanol (EtOH, Panreac, purity P.A.). 

PEO and PS present relatively similar degree of affinity with THF, thus the latter is 

initially introduced, resulting in the formation of a homogeneous solution with the 

copolymer chains separated. By adding EtOH, which has a hydrophilic character, the PEO 

part of the chain is oriented towards the EtOH molecules and the PS parts, being 

hydrophobic, are approached to each other. The result of this molecular rearrangement is 

the formation of micelles, which are composed by a central PS sphere and an outer co-

central PEO cell (Figure 3.4).[75]

In order to achieve equilibrium between the two activities and prevent precipitation, 

mainly provoked by surpassing the critical micelle concentration due to EtOH excess, a 

volume ratio between THF and EtOH of 1:3 is required. In order to assist the dissolution 

procedure, for each solvent step the solution was kept in the oven at 60 - 70 
o
C for 10 - 15 

min, depending on the template concentration. When the template solution was sufficiently 

dissolved, the mixture of the inorganic precursors was introduced drop by drop, avoiding 

sudden expansion of micelles, caused by the polar character of 2-methoxyehtanol. As 

discussed in Sections 2.6.2 and 2.6.3, the formation of micelles is a continuous procedure, 

which lasts until the final thermal treatment, thus it is influenced by every step and its 

respective parameters, such as solvents character and quantities, dip-coating withdrawal 

velocity and temperature and, finally, thermal treatment.  

Two principal studies were conducted for the case of porous thin films; the role of 

the concentrations of: a) the template and b) the inorganic precursors, which implied 

adjustments in the initial solution. For the first case, 5 different solutions with varying 

template quantities and fixed inorganic precursors concentration of 0.3 M were produced 

(Table 3.3). For the second case, three different solutions with varying concentrations and 

fixed template mass at 30 mg were prepared (Table 3.4).

3.2.2 Dip-coating Deposition 

The step of sol-gel deposition on substrates is similar to that of the dense films, 

discussed in Section 3.1.2, however the used temperature deposition was 90 
o
C, based on 

the studies discussed in Section 4.2.1. For the investigation of the withdrawal velocity 

effect on the multiferroic properties of porous thin films the selected solution was that of 

0.3 M concentration of the inorganic precursors and 24 mg of solution template mass, since

it presented the best results concerning the porous network ordering. The different

3.2.3 Annealing Process 

All porous films were treated under the same annealing profiles. Initially, the 

chosen temperature was 400 
o
C for 5 min, aiming at the removal of the templates. 

Subsequently, the films were annealed at 550 
o
C and 600 

o
C for 5 min each, in order to 

study the multiferroic properties for both temperatures. 

Nevertheless, since the disappearance of the ordering of the porous structure was 

observed at elevated temperatures, required for the crystallization of the films, two 

annealing temperature/time studies were conducted for the case of sample P30 (Section 

4.2.2). For the first case, the films were annealed at 400, 450, 500, 550, 600 and 650 
o
C for 

5 min each, in order to observe the effect of the annealing temperature on the 

microstructure development. The second study aimed at investigating the effect of 

annealing time on the crystallization and densification of the sample. In this case the films 

were annealed at 450 and 500 
o
C for 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 min for each temperature.

 Characterization 3.3

The structural, microstructural and ferroic properties of the thin films were assessed 

through a series of characterization methods.  

Crystallinity and formed crystalline phases of the annealed films were characterized 

by X-Ray Diffraction, using Philips X-Pert MPD equipment, with Cu-K? X-Ray radiation 

and ? = 1.5406 Å. 

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) mainly serve for microstructure and 

thickness characterization. The equipment used for SEM characterization was Hitachi® 

model S4100, and in some cases Hitachi® model SU-70. The acceleration voltages utilized 

for dense and porous films were 15 and 25 kV respectively, since higher values permit a 

better penetration for a 3D visualization of the porous network.  

The study for the presence of BFO’s rhombohedral phase presence was assisted by 

Raman Spectroscopy. The equipment used was JY Horiba LabRam model HR800, with a 

high resolution 800 mm focal length spectrometer. The laser beam utilized was Argon at 

532 nm (Ventus). 

Ferroelectric properties were investigated via Piezoresponse Force Microscopy 

(PFM). The microscope used was Veeco, equipped with Nanoscope III, Digital 

Instruments. The silicon cantilever-tips used were coated with Al, produced by 

NANOSENSORS
TM

 model PPP-NCHR, with length of 125 ?m, resonant frequency of 204-

497 kHz and force constant of 10-130 N/m. 

Magnetic properties were measured by Superconducting Quantum Interference 

Device (SQUID). The measurements were conducted under constant temperature at 300 K 

and for varying magnetic field. The equipment used was Quantum Design – MPMS 

(Centro de Física Matéria Condensada, Faculdade de Ciências, Universidade de Lisboa).

4. Results and Discussion 

 BiFeO3 Dense Films 4.1

As mentioned in Section 3.1.1, a series of efforts were conducted in order to 

prepare the necessary BFO dense thin films, our reference point for the investigation of the 

role of porosity. In order to create the best possible conditions, so that a reasonable 

comparison between the two structures could be made, the same preparation conditions 

were used, i.e. the same type of solvents and same annealing temperatures.  

However, due to the weak adhesion of the sol on the substrate, a small amount of 

Pluronic F127 polymer (5mg) was added. Since in this case some porosity was observed, 

an extra drying step was applied, by placing the deposited film on a hot-plate at 120 
o
C for 

2 min, prior to the thermal treatment for template removal and crystallization annealing, as 

proposed by Coondoo et al.[73]. Deposition temperature control (70 
o
C), in combination 

with the immediate contact with the hot-plate, and the subsequent treatment at 300 
o
C for 3 

min, solved the problems of pore occurrence, for medium and high withdrawal velocities. 

4.1.1 Effect of Withdrawal Velocity on Film Thickness 

Table 4.1 presents the different cases of withdrawal velocities used for the 

preparation of dense films, together with the respective thicknesses, as measured by the 

cross-section SEM images (Figure 4.1), with the help of the image processing program 

ImageJ. Sample D100 was not characterized, mainly due to stabilization difficulties on the 

sample holder. Cross-section images require perpendicular positioning of the sample and 

owing to disproportionate dimensions, there is always a small movement during the 

acquisition of the images, resulting in distortion of the real dimensions. It should be 

mentioned that some inhomogeneity was detected in the film thickness, thus the 

thicknesses presented in Table 4.1 were calculated as the average of measurements taken 

in various positions of the cross-section SEM images.

  CHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion

The thickness of BFO dense films varied between 100 and 285 nm, as can be seen 

in Table 4.1 and Figure 4.1. Thickness increases with increasing withdrawal velocity, 

meaning that the velocities chosen belong to the draining regime (Section 2.6.2, Figure 

2.19).[53,56] Lower velocities were also tested, however due to adhesion problems the 

films presented inhomogeneous zones with clear difference in deposited mater, hence 

thickness.  

In Figure 4.2, the effect of the withdrawal velocity on the film thickness is 

presented. A logarithmic scale was used for the x-axis and the units are presented in mm/s, 

instead of mm/min that appear in Table 4.1, in order to be able to make a comparison with 

Faustini et al.[56]. As shown in Section 2.6.2, the draining regime exists for withdrawal 

velocities higher than 0.1 mm/s, which is also observed for the current case. However, no 

direct conclusions can be made concerning the limits of the draining regime. Undoubtedly, 

withdrawal velocity-thickness relation depends on the nature of solvents, precursors, 

solution viscosity, chamber temperature and humidity. In addition, no lower withdrawal 

velocities were possible to investigate, which gives no clues about the capillary regime for 

the specific solution. Importantly, viscosity measurements are required for inclusion of 

such extreme values of withdrawal velocities.

In Figure 4.3, the top view SEM microstructures of the BFO films for different 

withdrawal velocities are presented. For higher velocities that correspond to thicker films a 

more dense structure was obtained and samples D29, D45, D100 and D150 show a 

considerably higher densification, apart from some inhomogeneity in grain distribution and 

the appearance of some individual pores. At these velocities, the draining regime 

dominates and the films are thicker. Drying process in thicker films lasts longer, since it 

occurs with the evaporation of the exterior surface and, apart from the increase of the gel 

aging time, there is more time for the particle ordering.[53] However, samples D5 and 

D10, deposited at lower withdrawal speeds, present a clear porous structure. This can be 

explained by the fact that at low withdrawal velocities, at which capillary forces start to 

influence the solvent-inorganic precursor interaction, solvent evaporation occurs faster 

than the motion of the drying line between the vapour, the liquid and the solid phase.[56] 

This results in inhomogeneous film formation.

4.1.2 XRD Results 

The XRD patterns of the BFO films with varying thickness of 100, 195 and 230 nm 

(samples D5, D29 and D150 respectively) are presented in Figure 4.4. All films present 

the main peaks of the rhombohedral phase of BFO. The peak appearing at around 29 2? 
?
 

can be attributed to the Bi2Fe4O9 secondary phase, with cubic structure and (121) 

orientation. The flattening close to 46 2? 
?
 can be due to a combination of the Pt peak with 

orientation (200) and the BFO monoclinic phase, which presents three intense peaks in that 

region. However, also monoclinic BiFeO3 and rhombohedral Fe2O3 impurities can 

contribute for the occurrence of multiple peaks close to that region, concerning the 

rhombohedral and monoclinic phases of BiFeO3, as well as the secondary phases. Since 

D150 film is thicker (230 nm thick), more intense peaks are visible, whereas for the D5 

case (100 nm thick), substrate clamping could have provoked the formation of off-

stoichiometric phases, as well as monoclinic symmetry.

4.1.3 PFM Studies 

By the use of Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM), topography and PFM 

images of dense samples were obtained simultaneously. All images were composed with 

detection of the vertical signal, thus imaging of out-of-plane polarization was conducted. 

The amplitude of the applied ac voltage was 5 V and the frequency 50 kHz. 

As shown in Figure 4.5, the first column corresponds to the topography image and 

the second to the piezoresponse. Topography basically images the film surface, where 

light regions correspond to heights and dark ones to lows. However, due to the use of 

contact mode, required for the monitoring of piezoelectric behaviour, size effects take 

place resulting in misrepresentation of the real grain size and morphology of the sample in 

investigation. 

The PFM images are composed by dark, medium and light domains. The first 

correspond to ferroelectric domains with substrate-oriented polarization (downwards, 

notation ?) and the light ones to tip-oriented polarization (upwards, notation ?) (Figure 

4.5). The medium domains could result owing to a series of cases.[68] Firstly, the 

polycrystalline nature of thin films produced via sol-gel process induces a random 

polarization. Integration of the piezoelectric response over film thickness results in zero 

total polarization. In addition, the relatively small grains, comparing to the film thickness, 

tend to reinforce polarization annihilation, since naturally domains are related with the 

grain structure. The latter statement should not be confused with topography-piezoresponse 

correlation, which in order to reveal truthful piezoelectric response demands independence 

between the two images. In other words, domain contrast should not coincide with grain 

contrast, which is related to the topography. Another case, usually characteristic of the 

stripe-like epitaxial BFO thin films (Section 2.7.3), is that of the in-plane oriented 

domains, which of course for the case of out-of-pane imaging have very low or even zero 

contribution. Furthermore, lack of polarized domains could result from the highly complex 

multiphasic character of BFO, with the occurrence of non-ferroelectric phases 

(orthorhombic, monoclinic and cubic), secondary phases and impurities (Section 2.5.2). 

Lastly, if the amplitude of the ac voltage used for the visualization of the domains is close 

to the magnitude of the coercive field, switching of the polarization could take place, 

following the same frequency, thus producing no domain contrast. 



  CHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion 

55 

 

The topography and PFM images for samples with increasing thickness D5, D29 

and D150 are presented in Figure 4.5. The samples were annealed at 600 
o
C. All samples 

present similar domain geometry and distribution. The domain configuration appears to be 

continuous, apart from the case of D29, which presents some areas with no response, 

mainly due to topography anomalies, as can be confirmed by the respective topography 

image.

The ferroelectric domains show a mosaic-like structure, similar to the one presented 

by Coondoo et al. for BFO films prepared by sol-gel.[73] Such a pattern differs from the 

stripe-like domains of BFO epitaxially grown thin films, mostly due to the polycrystalline 

character of sol-gel derived films, as well as the random grain formation and growth during 

crystallization. Although BFO’s piezoelectric coefficient is smaller than other perovskites, 

as referred in Section 2.5.1, the domains present high intensity and relatively large size, 

possibly due to the multiferroic character of BFO and the occurring magnetoelectric 

coupling taking place mostly at the domain walls, as discussed in Sections 2.5.3 and 2.7.3. 

BFO films with 230 nm thickness (sample D150) were thoroughly studied, due to a 

more regular and homogenous surface morphology. In Figure 4.6, the topography and 

PFM images for different scanning areas of 5 ?m x 5 ?m, 3 ?m x 3 ?m, 2 ?m x 2 ?m and 1 

?m x 1?m are shown. Upwards and downwards polarized domains are equally distributed, 

however the appearance of regions with intermediate contrast is highly frequent.

The relatively low roughness of the surface makes the verification of genuine 

domains less complicated, since irregular topography can provoke artefacts in the 

piezoresponse image, easily confused with ferroelectric domains. To avoid such confusion, 

areas in the topography image presenting homogenous grain colour (thus situated at the

same height) were chosen and correlated with the respective area in the PFM image. If 

domains with contrast can be observed for such a region, then the domains in question 

correspond to real ferroelectric domains. 

Figure 4.6 depicts the smaller scanning areas (2 ?m x 2 ?m and 3 ?m x 3 ?m) of 

sample D150, taken by zooming in the first image (5 ?m x 5 ?m), except for the case of 

1?m x 1?m. Domain structure, of course apart from the loss of resolution due to 

amplification, maintains exactly the same morphology and contrast. 

Small scanning areas also facilitate the local piezoelectric hysteresis loop 

measurements. The latter technique is based on the application of dc voltage pulses, which 

are subjected to a loop-like increase and decrease of the amplitude, with the necessary 

application of negative potential, for induction of polarization switching. In order to carry 

out these measurements, a ferroelectric domain should be chosen and the tip should stand 

still to a specific point on the domain. Hence, amplification of domains makes sure that the 

tip will be standing on a ferroelectric domain and not on a non-ferroelectric one or an inter-

domain region. 

Figure 4.7 presents the dc voltage pulses applied for the measurement of the local 

piezoelectric hysteresis loop, with pulse duration of 2 seconds and intervals of zero voltage 

of 1 second. Apart from the dc voltage required for the stimulation of piezoelectric 

behaviour, an ac field is applied simultaneously, mainly for the detection of the film 

reaction during the zero voltage intervals between the pulses. This ac voltage should be 

relatively low comparing to the dc bias, so that polarization removal would be avoided 

during piezoresponse reading. The small ac voltage had amplitude of 2 V and 50 kHz 

frequency. The maximum dc voltage was of 15 V and the step between each pulse is 1.5 V.

A slight increase in the saturation polarization with increasing thickness can be 

observed. High thickness corresponds to large grain and crystallite size, which results in 

the slightly stronger piezoelectric response. Nevertheless, thickness is a macroscopic 

characteristic of the films, whereas the current piezoresponse measurements are local, 

which implies that no absolute and direct correlation can be made. In some cases, 

impurities and elevated inhomogeneity can result in the formation of highly polarized 

domains, while at the same time large regions of the film present zero piezoresponse. The 

piezoelectric coefficient measured in these cases reaches even higher values than those 

observed in the thickest films (~230nm). 

 

4.1.4 Magnetic Characterization Results 

The magnetic properties of dense BFO films were measured by Superconducting 

Quantum Interference Device (SQUID). In order to subtract the substrate signal from the 

one produced by the film, a measurement of the magnetization of the substrate under the 

same magnetic field variation and the same temperature (300 K) was carried out. 

The magnetic moment measurements at 300 K for the BFO films have great 

importance, revealing for this model case of single-phase magnetoelectric multiferroic the 

uniqueness of room temperature multiferroic behaviour. A mass normalization is normally 

required, in order to present the apparent magnetization related to a specific amount of 

matter. For the current measurements the samples were cut in squares of 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm. 

Unfortunately, no easy and approachable technique was possible to be followed in order to 

measure the quantity of the mass deposited on such small areas. Hence, in all the SQUID 

results presented in this work, the magnetic response is given by the total magnetic 

moment measurement. As a result, a comparison with magnetization values referred in 

literature cannot be made.

In Figure 4.9, the magnetic moment measurements of samples with increasing 

thickness D5, D29 and D150 are presented. The antiferromagnetic behaviour displays an 

approximately linear relation between the applied magnetic field and the resulting 

magnetization and it dominates the magnetic response at higher magnetic fields. The 

magnetization increasing rate with the application of the magnetic field corresponds to the 

antiferromagnetic susceptibility of the material. For low magnetic fields, one can observe 

the manifestation of a slight hysteretic behaviour due to uncompensated magnetic 

moments.  

An intense difference can be observed for the case of 100 nm thick BFO films 

(sample D5), in comparison to the other samples. This can be interpreted by the possible 

occurrence of impurities, as discussed in Section 4.1.2, which could present ferromagnetic 

behaviour, resulting in the emergence of the low field weak ferromagnetic response. 

Furthermore, the highly porous microstructure observed for these films can be an 

additional factor for such a divergence. As discussed in Section 2.5.3, large surface 

anisotropies due to low film thickness, in combination with high roughness, relatively 

small grains (average size of 30nm), low crystallinity texture and possible presence of out-

of-plane surface spin structure, give rise to uncompensated magnetic moments, thus 

increased magnetization.[3,4,46,47] As a result, decrease of remanent magnetization with 

increasing film thickness can be observed in Figure 4.9 (b).

In Table 4.2, the antiferromagnetic susceptibility ?AF and the remanent 

magnetization ?r are presented for the BFO dense films 100, 195 and 230 nm thick 

(samples D5, D29 and D150). The antiferromagnetic susceptibility, characteristic of the 

material and derived from the slope of the graph at high magnetic field values, should have 

been the same for all the samples. However, since the total magnetic moment measured 

was not normalized concerning the mass contribution, there is a slight increase with 

increasing withdrawal velocity, due to the thickness increase. The samples’ magnetic 

response can be obtained by the remanent magnetization, which corresponds to the point at 

which the referred slope line meets the y-axis. Nevertheless, this assumption should be 

considered with care, due to the possible error introduced by the lack of normalization in 

the antiferromagnetic susceptibility.

 BiFeO3 Porous Films 4.2

4.2.1 Studies of the Template Concentration Effect 

In Table 4.3, the different samples prepared by increasing the solution template 

quantity are presented. All films were deposited at a velocity of 29.58 mm/min. The initial 

use of 60 mg in the solution presented highly inhomogeneous microstructure, hence the 

content of the template was decreased for a better micelle distribution along the film.  

Table 4.3 Template quantities used in the preparation of BFO porous films and the 

respective film porosity densities, pore size and porosity contribution. The pore size 

corresponds to the pore diameter. The porosity density relates to the number of pores for a 

specific area. The surface porosity contribution corresponds to the ration between the 

surface area occupied by the pores and the total area of the film.

In Figure 4.11, the SEM micrographs of P60, P48, P36, P30 and P24 (with the 

content of the template decreasing with this order) are presented. All the BFO films are 

visibly porous and the size and degree of order of the porosity varies with the content of 

the polymer. It is clearly visible that as the content of polymer increases the porosity of the 

films increases, but pore organization is also directly affected by the polymer content. An 

enhanced degree of order was obtained for the films with the lowest content of polymer, 

the cases of P30 and P24 films. For the films with the highest polymer content (sample 

P60), the excess of template lead to the coalescence of the porosity and also to the 

formation of bigger pores in comparison with the films prepared with lower polymer

contents. P48 films show an organised network of pores with the biggest pore size among 

these organised pore networks; the pore size was calculated to be ~ 74 nm. It is also visible 

and related with the amount of the template that in this case the pore walls are thinner than 

for the films with lower polymer amounts. As the polymer content decreases the pore size 

decreases and the pore organization increases. 

Pore size, porosity density and surface porosity contribution were calculated by the 

SEM images (Figure 4.11) by the use of the image processing program Image J, as 

presented in Table 4.3. The pore size corresponds to the pore diameter. The porosity 

density was measured as the number of pores for a specific area. Finally, surface porosity 

contribution was calculated by the ratio between the surface area occupied by the pores and 

the total area of the film. Calculation of the actual porosity density along the whole film 

volume was very difficult, since cross-section SEM images lacked resolution. Thus, the 

presented densities correspond to the surface porosity density and not to the bulk density.

Increasing the template quantity resulted in increasing pore size and decreasing 

porosity density (Figure 4.12 (a) and (b) respectively). The decrease in the surface 

porosity contribution as a function of the solution template mass for samples P48 and P60 

(Figure 4.12 (c)) results from the formation of large micelles, as well as the presence of 

large template aggregates, which led to the coalescence of the pores and the formation of 

big craters.

? XRD Results 

In Figure 4.13, XRD patterns for the samples P24, P30 and P60, annealed at 600 

o
C, are presented. The most intense peaks correspond to the BiFeO3 rhombohedral phase. 

Samples P24 and P60 present higher degree of crystallinity, which results from the lower 

porosity contribution, as presented in Table 4.3. For samples P24 and P60, the peak 

appearing at around 28 2? 
o

? PFM Studies 

In Figure 4.14, the topography and PFM images of samples P24, P30 and P60 are 

presented. The same conditions as those of the dense film characterization were used. All 

samples present similar domain configuration. However, the high degree of surface 

inhomogeneity for the sample P60 made difficult the acquisition of the images, thus the 

topography image presents grain deformation. The elevated roughness also affected the 

detection of piezoresponse, revealing regions with zero polarization.

The local piezoelectric hysteresis loops were measured for P24, P30 and P60 films. 

P30 films show smaller saturation polarization, probably due to the thinner inorganic 

network induced by the higher porosity contribution, as seen in Figure 4.11 and Figure 

4.12 (c). The increase of template mass in the solution caused increase of the pore size and 

decrease of porosity density. As a result, the formation of larger grains was allowed for 

samples with lower degree of pore distribution, and since the most intense domains were 

selected for the current study, higher piezoelectric coefficients were detected for samples 

P24 and P60. Once again, the phenomenon of strong polarized domains, isolated by 

surrounding areas with weak polarization was repeatedly observed in highly 

inhomogeneous samples.

? Magnetic Characterization Results 

In order to investigate the effect of template concentration on the magnetic 

behaviour of the porous films, magnetic moment measurements upon increasing magnetic 

field at 300 K were carried out for the porous films P24 and P60 and compared with the 

dense films D29 (prepared with the same withdrawal velocity and annealed at 600

There is again a slight divergence in the values of the antiferromagnetic 

susceptibility, due to lack of mass normalization in the measurements. The results show the 

opposite behaviour of what was expected, as increase in remanent magnetization with 

decreasing porosity contribution is presented. In addition, the otherwise predicted effect of 

thickness on magnetization is not observed in this case, since there is increase in magnetic 

response with increasing thickness. Both phenomena should have yielded increase in the 

uncompensated magnetic moments, due to higher degree of surface roughness and 

anisotropy. The explanation lies in the lack of thorough investigation of each sample, since 

a more reliable technique for the thickness and porosity characterization should have been 

employed. Nevertheless, the higher frequency of ferroelectric domains observed for the 

samples D29 and P24 signifies enhanced ferroelectric behaviour and naturally higher 

magnetoelectric coupling, in addition to the domain wall induced magnetization.[48,49] 

Furthermore, the random grain size distribution together with the larger grains observed in 

P60 can stimulate the formation of larger ferroelectric domains, thus smaller wall network.

In Figure 4.17, a comparison between a dense and a porous film is presented. For 

the case of higher withdrawal velocity of 150 mm/min (Figure 4.17), porous sample P150 

shows a higher remanent magnetization, as expected by the presence of surface anomaly 

induced magnetization. The two thicknesses do not present large deviation, with 230 nm 

and 240 nm for P150 and D150 respectively, thus the uncompensated spins result mainly 

from the presence of porosity.

4.2.2 Studies of the Annealing Temperature 

The loss of porosity order at elevated temperatures led to the need of a deeper 

understanding of grain growth and crystallization procedure, and how this affects the 

porosity network. The sample chosen for this study is P30 (with 29.58 mm/min withdrawal 

velocity, 0.3 M sol-gel concentration and 30 mg solution template mass), since it presented 

a relatively homogeneous porous structure. 

Figure 4.18 presents the SEM micrographs of P30 films for six different annealing 

temperatures, ranging from 400 to 650 
o
C with a dwell time of 5 min. The gradual loss of 

porous structure can be observed above 550 
o
C, which corresponds to the beginning of the 

crystallization process.

concerning the porous order, as the annealing time increases. However, after 1 h of thermal 

treatment, break of symmetry in grain interfaces due to the presence of porosity results in 

random densification of the films.

This effect becomes clear for the films annealed at 500 
o
C, where the ordered array 

gives rise to large gaps of matter, creating a labyrinth-like porous motif. As the annealing 

time increases the film densification takes place and the degree of porosity decreases, but 

the ordering of porosity is almost lost. As 500 
o
C is just before the transition temperature at 

which crystallization happens, as seen in Figure 4.19, higher annealing times present an 

extremely intense grain growth, thus these first steps of densification tend to diminish the 

size of pores.  

PFM studies conducted in these samples show the lack of piezoresponse signal 

confirming the incipient degree of crystallinity of these films, since the crystallization 

occurs above 550 
o
C. 

? Raman Spectroscopy Results 

Raman spectroscopy studies were carried out to compliment the investigation and 

identification of the rhombohedral BiFeO3 phase present in the films. Figure 4.20 presents

The allowed active phonon modes for the rhombohedral symmetry of BFO can be 

represented by: ?=4A1+9E, where 4 modes of A1-symmetry and 9 degenerate modes of E-

symmetry are predicted by group theory.[77] In the films under study, A1-1, A1-2 and A1-3 

modes present strong scattering intensity, while A1-4 and all the E phonons are of weak 

and medium intensity respectively. In addition, peaks appearing at wavenumbers lower 

than 200 cm
-1

 result from Bi dislocations within the perovskite structure, whereas those 

with wavenumber above 200 cm
-1

 imply the tilting of the oxygen octahedra.[4,78] 

However, not all modes are always visible. Polarized Raman scattering studies by 

Fukumura et al.[79] and Kothari et al.[80], for single-crystal and polycrystalline bulk BFO 

respectively, revealed all 13 active modes, since phonon detection depends on polarization 

orientation. In our case horizontal polarization with backscattering geometry was used.  

Porous BFO P30 films annealed at 650 
o
C present 6 of the phonon modes: A1-1, 

A1-2, A1-3, A1-4 and 4 E-symmetry modes (Figure 4.20 and Table 4.5). For 600 
o
C 

annealing temperature only six active modes were detected. For 550 and 600 
o
C annealing 

temperatures the second E mode is present, whereas for 650 
o
C it disappears. However, the 

latter case shows the symmetry of A1-4. Raman spectrum for 550 
o
C presents lower peak 

definition, possibly due to incipient crystallization. Although for the case of 600 
o
C more 

modes are present, the peak intensity is hindered, probably due to the appearance of other 

BFO symmetry phases.[37,81] 

Table 4.5 presents all the detected phonon modes for BFO porous P30 films 

annealed at three different temperatures, together with the respective modes and its 

frequencies reported by Kothari et al.[80], Fukumura et al.[79], Singh et al.[77] and Yuan 

et al.[82], for comparison. The first group’s studies were conducted for bulk 

polycrystalline BFO prepared via solid state reaction technique. The second group studied 

bulk single crystal BFO and the last two groups epitaxial thin films. These discrepancies 

between the obtained results may be related to the different nature of the films and the 

presence of residual secondary phases.

? PFM Studies 

In Figure 4.21, the topography and PFM images of BFO porous P30 films 

annealed at 600 
o
C for different scanning areas, 5 ?m x 5 ?m, 3 ?m x 3 ?m, 2 ?m x 2 ?m 

and 1 ?m x 1 ?m, are presented. A uniform ferroelectric domain distribution is observed 

for all images. 

In order to ensure the genuine ferroelectric origin of the appearing domains, 

topography and PFM image correlation is required. The green contour in the case of 2 ?m 

x 2 ?m scanning area corresponds to a ferroelectric domain with upward polarization 

orientation, while the yellow one to a downward. The respective areas in the topography 

image are also highlighted, revealing topography uniformity for the specific area. Thus, in 

a highly homogeneous part of the film surface, ferroelectric domains with opposing 

orientations can be observed, which is a strong evidence for the claiming ferroelectric 

behaviour. These results also attest the crystallinity of the BFO porous films annealed at 

600 
o
C.

to peeling effect of the fragile film off the substrate surface. Images P29 and P150 were 

taken with perpendicular positioning of the sample. However the rest of the images were 

taken with an 8
o
 rotation angle of the sample holder, relatively to the perpendicular 

position required for the capture of cross-section image. The rotation was used in order to 

show the peeling effect, which makes difficult the focus on the significantly thin film. The 

inclination only causes a small divergence in the real film thickness, since cos (8
o
)?0.99, 

which corresponds to a much smaller error comparing to the irregularity in the film 

thickness.

38 and 44 2? 
o
. Comparing sample P5 with the respective dense D5 film (Figure 4.4, 

Section 4.1.2), one can observe the appearance of the same peaks, a fact that could lead to 

the conclusion that very low withdrawal velocities require a thorough investigation of the 

entire procedure, in order to achieve homogeneous, impurity-free thin films.

applied and the frequency were the same as the other studies, 5 V and the 50 kHz 

respectively.  

All PFM images show relatively high frequency of presence of ferroelectric 

domains, resembling extremely with the dense films presented in Section 4.1.3. Only the 

case of P5 films shows large non-polarized regions, mainly due to the presence of BFO 

impurities, as well as surface or thickness irregularities, a fact that also provoked 

deformation in the topography image. It should be mentioned that there were some regions, 

especially for the thinner films, where the PFM signal was much weaker. In addition, 

zones with larger grains or inhomogeneous distribution of grains performed enhanced 

piezoelectric response, often surrounded by regions with zero induced polarization, as seen 

in PFM images of films P5 and P29.

? Magnetic Characterization Results 

Table 4.7 summarises the magnetic response measurements for the BFO porous 

P5, P29 and P150 films, together with the relevant thicknesses. The respective porosity 

surface for the total volume for each sample was calculated. The pores were considered as 

spheres, with the respective diameter, as measured by the SEM micrographs presented in 

Figure 4.28. An approximation of the total surface area of the porous network was made 

by calculating the pore density of the surface and admitting that the same distribution takes 

place for the entire film volume. As expected, increase of the total porosity surface is 

observed for increasing thickness. The pore sizes and the surface pore density of the films 

do not present large deviation. Larger volume due to higher thickness for P150 films 

results in higher than the double of the porosity area of P5 films.

CHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion

As shown in Figure 4.29, the magnetization curves reveal increase of 

magnetization saturation for increasing thickness (Figure 4.30 (a)). This outcome is 

explained by the increase of the porosity surface (Table 4.7 and Figure 4.30(b)), induced 

be the increased porous network for the cases of thicker films. Since no normalization by 

mass of film was made, in a sense that a more relative value of magnetization would have 

been measured if such a subtraction had been made, thicker films presented higher absolute 

magnetization than the thinner ones. BFO porous P150 films with a thickness of 240 nm 

present a porous network of 1.99 cm
2
 total area, which is 330992 times larger than the 

surface area of a dense sample with the same dimensions and as discussed in Section 4.2.1 

it presents higher magnetic response.

Summarising for the thickness and porosity study of the porous films, increase in 

the withdrawal velocity led to increase in the film thickness. The high surface area present 

in the porous films results in increase in the remanent magnetization, due to the 

uncompensated magnetic moments occurring at cases with surface anisotropies and 

elevated roughness.

4.2.4 Effect of Sol-gel Concentration on Microstructure and FerroelectricProperties 

The observation of loss of porosity order with increasing annealing temperature 

(Section 4.2.2) led to a sol-gel concentration increase study. Crystallization process 

resulted in large gaps between the BFO grains, with a random arrangement. A well-ordered 

porous network is essential, principally for the possible functionalization procedure and the 

obtainment of properties which are not subjected to irregular conditions. In addition, the 

investigation of inhomogeneous samples is always much more elaborate, requiring more 

accurate characterization techniques and more complicated theoretic background.

Figure 4.32. All the samples present the characteristic peaks of the rhombohedral phase of 

BFO, with a slight difference in the intensity of the peaks. The peak close to 28 2?

 for the

are presented, with 0.3 M, 0.4 M and 0.5 M solution concentrations respectively and 

annealed at 400 and 600

the case of 24 mg template mass showed better results, it was avoided for the current study, 

since it corresponded to the lowest template quantity and could have provoked more 

extreme changes. The withdrawal velocity for all the samples was at 29.58 mm/min. The 

samples were annealed at 400

Increase of the inorganic precursor concentration led to the formation of more 

dense microstructure, decreasing substantially the gap generation observed in the porous 

P0.3 films, as discussed in Section 4.2.2. Sample P0.5 at 600

C shows a porous structure 

with an increase in the average pore size from 40 to 44 nm, yet with a high degree of 

deviation. Further annealing temperature studies should be carried out, in order to explore 

the effect of different annealing profiles on the porous structure.

In Figure 4.34, the topography and PFM images for BFO porous P0.3, P0.4 and

The local polarization hysteresis loops for the porous films with increasing sol-gel

saturation polarization can be observed with increasing inorganic precursor quantity in the 

solution. This result is extremely important, since by increasing the solution concentration 

a more controlled order of the porous structure can be obtained with a simultaneous 

increase in the piezoresponse.

4.2.5 Magnetic Force Microscopy Studies 

The weak ferromagnetic behaviour of BFO difficilitates the magnetic domain 

visualization via Magnetic force Microscopy (MFM), No report of such characterization 

has been made before, apart from the case of composites, primarily a combination of the 

ferroelectric-antiferromagnetic BFO with ferromagnetic materials. By the application of an 

external electric field, magnetoelectric coupling takes place, mainly at the interface of the 

two phases, which makes possible the emergence of magnetic domains.[32,74] 

In order to explore whether electric field-induced magnetization could occur, MFM 

studies were carried out for BFO D180 and P24 films annealed at 600 
o
C, with 

simultaneous application of dc voltage of 4 V. As mentioned in Section 2.7.3, a 

combination of tapping and non-contact mode is required for such measurements. The 

topography image is first taken by tapping mode, which is a hybrid type of topography 

imaging, a combination between contact and non-contact mode. The cantilever-tip vibrates 

at the resonance frequency and the amplitude is maintained constant during surface-tip 

interaction, causing vertical variations and making possible the surface monitoring. 

However, for the magnetic force detection the tip is elevated at sufficient distance from the 

surface (non-contact lifting mode operation), depending on the roughness of the sample. 

For the current study, non-contact measurements took place at 200 nm.  

In Figure 4.37, the topography and MFM images are shown for a dense sample 

deposited at 180mm/min (D180) and a porous sample with 24 mg of solution template 

mass and 29.58 mm/min withdrawal velocity (P24). The last image is a tapping mode 

topography image of sample P24, without the use of magnetic detection mode. The tip 

elevation, required for the latter measurement, in most cases results in large drifts in the 

topography image, as can be observed in the second topography image. It was chosen in 

order to show the high resolution of tapping mode for surface imaging, comparing to the 

contact mode of PFM technique. 

In the MFM images domains with opposing orientation were detected. The 200 nm 

tip distance of the surface excludes the case of topography artefacts. However, most 

probably the domains’ nature is ferroelectric, since the conductive tip can sense the 

attractive electrostatic forces from the electric field induced surface charges. In addition, 

the domain geometry is very similar to the ones obtained by PFM characterization. In order 



  CHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion 

91 

 

to ensure the origin of the identified response in the MFM images, a tapping mode 

cantilever-tip without the magnetic coating was subsequently used. The results showed 

resembling domain configuration, however are not presented here, as scanning of the same 

area is extremely difficult to be achieved when changing the tip. Last but not least, a 

possible magnetoelectric coupling, presumably occurring at the domain walls and grain 

boundaries, resulted in domains slightly larger than the ferroelectric ones.

5. Conclusions and Future Work 

A series of BFO dense films with varying withdrawal velocities were produced, 

serving as means of comparison for the porous thin films. For low withdrawal velocities 

the films presented porosity features, yet by increasing velocity dense structure was 

obtained. Increasing withdrawal velocity resulted in increasing film thickness. Phase 

impurities were detected for the dense films D5 with the lowest film thickness. 

Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) characterization was conducted, revealing the 

expected ferroelectric domains. By the same technique, local piezoelectric hysteresis loops 

were obtained, showing increase of polarization saturation with increasing film thickness. 

Lastly, magnetic moment measurements were carried out by the use of Superconducting 

Quantum Interference Device (SQUID), presenting decrease of remanent magnetization 

with increasing thickness. A schematic representation in Figure 5.1 summarises the above 

results. 

Nevertheless, further studies for the obtainment of higher film densification should 

be made, so that a more correct comparison with the porous case could be carried out. 

Finally, after conferring a dense structure, macroscopic measurements of the piezoelectric 

hysteresis loop should be done, in order to be compared with the local ones.

97 

 

A porous network in BiFeO3 thin films was introduced by using a polymeric 

template. By varying the template concentration, the size and ordering of porosity was 

tailored. Homogeneity and lack of cracks in the films were successfully achieved, by 

decreasing solution template mass, for a given solution concentration. Thermal treatment 

studies revealed loss of porous network ordering at elevated annealing temperatures, 

required for the obtainment of crystallization and enhanced multiferroic properties. BFO 

porous films with low film thickness presented the formation of impurities. Increasing dip-

coating withdrawal velocity led to the production of films with increasing thicknesses. 

Local piezoelectric hysteresis loops showed increase of the effective piezoelectric 

coefficient with increasing thickness. SQUID characterization presented increasing 

remanent magnetization with increasing porosity. 

The most important future study for the porous matrices is that of the 

microstructure regulation at elevated annealing temperatures. This could be faced by better 

control of the correlation of the quantities of the inorganic precursors and the template in 

the solution, as well as by the use of different solvents. In addition, a series of annealing 

profiles should be studied, such as nitrogen atmosphere and slower and longer thermal 

treatment processes. 

At last but not least, the functionalization of the porous matrices by the introduction 

of preferably a ferromagnetic material, could lead to enhanced multiferroic properties and 

gigantic magnetoelectric coupling. Anyhow, that is the main purpose for the investigation 

of such intelligent architectures.
