Highly potent but structurally simple transmembrane anion transporters are reported that function at

receptor to lipid ratios as low as 1 : 1 000 000. The compounds, based on the simple ortho

phenylenediamine based bisurea scaffold, have been studied for their ability to facilitate chloride/

nitrate and chloride/bicarbonate antiport, and HCl symport processes using a combination of ion

selective electrode and fluorescence techniques. In addition, the transmembrane transport of

dicarboxylate anions (maleate and fumarate) by the compounds was examined. Molecular dynamics

simulations showed that these compounds permeate the membrane more easily than other promising

receptors corroborating the experimental efflux data. Moreover, cell based assays revealed that the

majority of the compounds showed cytotoxicity in cancer cells, which may be linked to their ability to

function as ion transporters.
Introduction

The regulation of cellular ion concentration by complex
membrane spanning proteins is critical for a range of biological
processes.1 Misregulation of chloride transport has been asso-
ciated with myotonia, nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), Bartter’s
syndrome and cystic ?brosis.2 Similarly, bicarbonate transport
misregulation is linked to a range of disease states,3 and has
been linked with pathogenic mucus production in cystic

transmembrane transport of chloride and bicarbonate it may be
possible to develop new treatments for this type of disease.

agents since the deacidi?cation of acidic organelles leads to
cytoplasmic acidi?cation, an early event in apoptosis.5 Indeed,
there are a number of anticancer agents that have been reported
to modulate intracellular pH. The prodiginines are one
example, with the anticancer activity of these molecules linked

antiport processes.6

The synthesis of small molecules that function as membrane
resident, mobile carriers for anions is an expanding ?eld of
research. By incorporating hydrogen-bond donor groups into a
suitably lipophilic scaffold it is possible to transport anions
through the hydrophobic interior of a lipid bilayer. Recent
examples of such scaffolds include the steroid-based chola-
pods,7 calix[4]pyrrole and its ?uorinated or triazole-strapped
analogues,8 amphiphilic catechols and monoacylglycerols,9

preorganised isophthalamides and squaramides,10 and tripodal
tris(aminoethyl)amine (tren) thioureas.11

Interest in this area has grown to encompass transporters
(carriers or otherwise) that show activity in biological
systems.6,12 To improve the likelihood of new transmembrane
transporter motifs exhibiting biological activity it is important
to design compounds that have suitable absorption, distribu-
tion, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) characteris-
tics.13 There are guidelines, such as Lipinski’s rule of ?ve, that

specify ranges of ‘ideal’ molecular properties such as molecular
weight, partition coefficient and the number of hydrogen bond
donors and acceptors.14 By considering these guidelines we
generated transporters that exhibit biological activity in vivo,
such as ?uorinated molecules based on indolylurea/thiourea15

scaffolds that show promise as anticancer agents. By synthe-
sising transporters that obey the rules of thumb de?ned by
Lipinski and others, the possibility that these compounds will
be biologically compatible is greater, i.e. have acceptable
absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties.

We have previously shown that bisurea receptors in which
the two urea groups are linked by alkyl chains can promote
chloride transport across phospholipid bilayers.16 In other work
we have shown that ortho-phenylenediamine-based bisureas are
effective anion receptors.17 We decided to explore the anion
transport properties of ortho-phenylenediamine-based bisureas
as promising candidates for biologically active ion transporters
that may conform to the rules of thumb de?ned by Lipinski and
others.14

Molecules developed from this scaffold have found extensive
use in the ?eld of anion complexation; we have previously
reported that ortho-phenylenediamine-based bisureas function
as selective carboxylate complexation agents,17 whilst the anal-
ogous 4,5-dimethyl-1,2-phenylenediamine scaffold has been
used to construct colorimetric anion sensors.18 These motifs
can be extended with additional hydrogen bond donor groups
to yield receptors with enhanced anion affinity.19 Trisureas and
tetraureas developed in this way show good selectivity for
phosphate and sulfate,20 whilst a tripodal tren-based hexylurea
functions as a sulfate extractant.21 Extended amidourea mac-
rocycles based on these scaffolds exhibit good selectivity
towards carboxylates.22 Replacement of the phenylene core with
anthraquinone yields colorimetric sensors for the detection of
Hg2+ and H2PO4

?,23 whilst replacement with a cyclohexyl core
has been used for the chiral recognition of phosphate ions24 and
the colorimetric sensing of cyanide.25 Further, these molecules
have found other applications in crystal engineering,26 as gela-
tors,27 and in catalysis.28

In this paper we report the transmembrane transport
properties of ortho-phenylenediamine-based bisureas 1–8, and
compare them to monoureas 9–11; the latter being analogues
of the three most active bisurea transporters. The anion
binding properties of this series of compounds were deter-
mined using 1H NMR titration techniques in DMSO-d6/0.5%
H2O mixtures. Anion transport was studied using a combina-
tion of ion selective electrode assays and ?uorescence tech-
niques in phospholipid vesicles. In vitro viability and
?uorescence assays have been performed in order to evaluate
the anticancer properties of these compounds. We show that
this hydrogen bonding array is a highly potent anion transport
motif with the most active compound studied showing trans-
port at 1 : 1 000 000 receptor : lipid ratios. Effective transport
at very low concentrations is a desirable feature allowing the
potential use of these compounds in biological systems at low
dose. Finally, in silico studies were also performed to bring
further insights into the interactions of 5 and 6 with a lipid
bilayer model.

Results and discussion
Synthesis

We have previously reported the synthesis of compounds 1,17a

3,17b 6,17b and 8.17b Reaction of the appropriate isocyanate with
ortho-phenylenediamine in dichloromethane/pyridine gave
compounds 4, 5 and 7 in 39%, 84% and 82% yields respectively.
Compound 2 was prepared by a similar method, using
4,5-di?uoro-2-nitroaniline as the starting material. Hydrogena-
tion using Pd/C in methanol, followed by reaction with
phenylisocyanate in dichloromethane/pyridine yielded
compound 2 in 37% yield.

The syntheses of monoureas 9,29 10,30 and 11 (ref. 31) have
been previously reported.32 In all cases aniline was added to the
corresponding isocyanate in dichloromethane/pyridine to
produce compounds 9, 10, and 11 in 56%, 58% and 75% yields
respectively. These compounds are analogues of the three most
active bisurea transporters 4, 5 and 6.

Anion binding in solution

The ability of compounds 1–11 to bind anions in solution was
investigated using 1H NMR titration techniques in DMSO-d6/
0.5% water (with the anions added as tetrabutylammonium
(TBA) or tetraethylammonium (TEA) salts) both to provide
comparability with earlier studies33 and for solubility reasons.
The binding studies were performed for anions relevant to both
our transmembrane transport assays and biological systems.
Where possible the change in chemical shi? of the most
down?eld NH signal was ?tted to a 1 : 1 binding model using
WinEQNMR2 so?ware.34 The results are summarised in Table 1.
Previously reported stability constants are included for
comparison.17 Fitted curves and selected Job plots can be found
in the ESI.†

In general, compounds 1–11 exhibit strong 1 : 1 binding with
tetraethylammonium bicarbonate, moderate 1 : 1 binding with
tetrabutylammonium chloride and no signi?cant interaction
with tetrabutylammonium nitrate under the conditions of the

NMR experiments. A sigmoidal binding curve was obtained for
compound 2 with tetraethylammonium bicarbonate that could
not be ?tted to a binding model.35 Job plot analysis suggested
1 : 1 binding, however the plot was an unusual shape, that may
be due to more complex solution phase behaviour such as
deprotonation of the bound oxoanion.33b Signi?cant urea NH
peak broadening was observed upon addition of tetraethy-
lammonium bicarbonate to compounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 11.
A stability constant could not be determined for compound 4
with tetraethylammonium bicarbonate due to this broadening
effect, however Job plot analysis con?rmed 1 : 1 binding.

Comparing functionalised receptors 2–7 with receptor 1, it
can be observed that addition of electron withdrawing substit-
uents to either the central core or the peripheral phenyl groups
increases anion affinity. In addition, it has been suggested that
halogenation of the phenylene core (2 and 3) can aid receptor
preorganisation by increasing the acidity of the phenylene CH
groups, strengthening intramolecular hydrogen bonding inter-
actions.17b For compounds 2–7 the binding constants obtained
with tetrabutylammonium chloride are of similar magnitude
whilst no signi?cant interaction was previously reported
between compound 8 and tetrabutylammonium chloride.17b

This lack of interaction was attributed to intramolecular
hydrogen bonding. The ortho-nitro groups may also provide a
steric constraint on the binding site. Similarly, compound 8 has
a signi?cantly lower binding constant with tetraethylammo-
nium bicarbonate than compounds 6 and 7.

Colour changes were observed upon addition of tetraethy-
lammonium bicarbonate to nitro-functionalised compounds 6,
7, 8 and 11. Such behaviour has been reported previously in the
presence of basic anions and has been attributed to deproto-
nation in analogous systems.17b,18,25,36

Interestingly, the two least active ion transporters (1 and 8)
display the lowest affinity for both chloride and bicarbonate.
This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013
The most active transporter 6 has the highest affinity of the
series for bicarbonate. In addition, the monourea compounds
9, 10 and 11 show reduced anion affinity compared to their
bisurea analogues, demonstrating the impact of incorporating
additional convergent hydrogen bond donor groups into the
receptor scaffold.

To complement the transport studies, we attempted to titrate
compounds 4, 5 and 6 with tetrabutylammonium maleate and
tetrabutylammonium fumarate in DMSO-d6/0.5% H2O.

37 Addi-
tion of the tetrabutylammonium dicarboxylate to the receptor
solution resulted in the formation of a precipitate in both
instances, preventing determination of a binding constant.
Instead ESI mass spectrometry was used to examine the inter-
action between bisureas and dicarboxylate anions. Compound 5
was studied owing to both its good solubility and high transport
activity. Negative ESI experiments with solutions of 5 and either
maleic or fumaric acid revealed the formation of 1 : 1 bisurea–
carboxylate complexes in the gas phase. Further, by analysing
samples containing different ratios of bisurea host and
carboxylate anion it was possible to determine that compound 5
binds maleate more strongly than fumarate.38,39
Solid state

The solid-state behaviour of compound 7 was examined using
single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1). Tables of hydrogen
bonds, data collection and re?nement details, and thermal
ellipsoid plots can be found in the ESI.†

Crystals were obtained by slow evaporation of a methanol–
water solution of compound 7 in the presence of tetraethy-
lammonium bicarbonate. Analysis revealed that the meta-nitro
functionalised bisurea forms a 2 : 1 (receptor : anion) complex
with carbonate, the encapsulated carbonate anion bound by
eleven hydrogen-bonding interactions. All the available urea NH
groups were found to be involved in hydrogen bonding the
carbonate (N–O distances 2.726(2)–3.368(2) A?, N–H/O angles
139.0–166.9?). It appears that in the solid state the meta-nitro
group does not hinder guest inclusion.

Transport studies

We assessed the ability of compounds 1–11 to transport anions
across phospholipid bilayers using a combination of ion
selective electrode and ?uorescence techniques. In a typical
assay unilamellar, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidyl-choline
(POPC) vesicles (200 nm diameter) were prepared containing
sodium chloride (488 mM with 5 mM phosphate buffer at pH
7.2) and suspended in a solution of sodium nitrate (488 mM
with 5 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.2).40 Compounds 1–11 were
added as solutions in DMSO and the resulting chloride efflux
from vesicles monitored using a chloride selective electrode
(Accumet). At the end of the experiment detergent (octaethylene
glycol monododecyl ether) was added to lyse the vesicles. The
?nal reading was used to calibrate the electrode to 100% chlo-
ride release.

In these assays ion transport occurs by a passive process. To
maintain charge balance, ion transport must occur by either a
symport or an antiport mechanism.40 The chloride efflux in
Fig. 2 could therefore be a consequence of chloride/nitrate
antiport, chloride/sodium symport or HCl symport processes.

To examine the possibility of sodium/chloride co-transport,
an ISE assay was performed using vesicles containing caesium
Fig. 2 Chloride efflux promoted by a DMSO solution of compounds 1 11 (2 mol
% carrier to lipid) from unilamellar POPC vesicles loaded with 488 mM NaCl
buffered to pH 7.2 with 5 mM sodium phosphate salts. The vesicles were
dispersed in 488 mM NaNO3 buffered to pH 7.2 with 5 mM sodium phosphate
salts. At the end of the experiment detergent was added to lyse the vesicles and
calibrate the ISE to 100% chloride efflux. Each point represents an average of
three trials. DMSO was used as a control. See Fig. S44 and S45† for versions of this
figure with error bars.

chloride buffered to pH 7.2 with 5 mM phosphate buffer. The
vesicles were suspended in a solution of sodium nitrate buff-
ered to pH 7.2 with 5 mM phosphate buffer. In the event of
metal chloride co-transport we would expect the rate of chloride
release to be dependent on the nature of the metal cation.8,41

The rates of chloride release for vesicles containing sodium
chloride were within error of those observed for vesicles con-
taining caesium chloride, implying that metal/chloride symport
is not facilitated by these compounds (see ESI† for comparative
plots).

Chloride/bicarbonate antiport is a biologically signi?cant
process.3,6e,42 Compounds 1–11 were tested for ability to facili-
tate chloride exchange using a chloride selective electrode assay
with vesicles containing sodium chloride (451 mM with 20 mM
phosphate buffer at pH 7.2) suspended in a solution of sodium
sulphate (150 mM with 20 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.2).
Compounds 1–11 were added as solutions in DMSO. A?er two
minutes a sodium bicarbonate ‘pulse’ was added such that the
external concentration of bicarbonate was 40 mM.

The external sulfate is more challenging to transport through a
lipid bilayer than bicarbonate, due to its higher hydrophilicity.43

dispersed in 150 mM Na2SO4 buffered to pH 7.2 with 20 mM sodium phosphate
salts. At t ¼ 120 s a solution of sodium bicarbonate was added such that the
external concentration of bicarbonate was 40 mM. At the end of the experiment,
detergent was added to lyse the vesicles and calibrate the ISE to 100% chloride
efflux. Each point represents an average of three trials. DMSO was used as a
control. See Fig. S57 and S58† for versions of this figure with error bars.

Consequently, chloride efflux observed in the ?rst two minutes of
the assay (before the bicarbonate ‘pulse’) is not expected to be the
result of an anion antiport mechanism. Upon addition of the
‘bicarbonate pulse’ a chloride/bicarbonate antiport mechanism
becomes possible. A marked increase in transport activity was
observed for compounds 2–7 at this point (Fig. 3).

Low levels of chloride efflux were observed for some of the
compounds in the two minutes before the bicarbonate pulse in
the aforementioned assay. To investigate this effect further, the
experiment was repeated without the bicarbonate ‘pulse’.
Signi?cant chloride efflux was observed for some of the
compounds (see ESI, Fig. S59†).

Evidence in support of transmembrane sulfate transport has
been observed previously for ?uorinated tripodal ureas and
thioureas.44 To test if the chloride efflux observed in the afore-
mentioned assay was linked to the transport of sulfate, uni-
lamellar POPC vesicles were prepared containing 100 mM NaCl
and 2 mM lucigenin buffered to pH 7.2 with 20 mM phosphate
buffer. These vesicles were suspended in 100 mM NaCl solution
buffered to pH 7.2 with 20 mM phosphate salts. A solution of
sodium sulfate was added such that the external concentration
of sulfate was 40 mM, and a?er one minute compounds 2–7
were added as solutions in methanol (2 mol% carrier to lipid).
No evidence of sulfate transport was observed using this assay
(see ESI†).

Compound 6 facilitated the highest chloride efflux in the
sulfate ‘blank’ assay and was used to explore the possibility of
HCl co-transport using a pH gradient assay.45 Vesicles con-
taining 451 mM sodium chloride buffered to pH 4.0 with 20 mM
citric acid buffer were suspended in a solution of 150 mM
sodium sulfate buffered to pH 7.2 with 20 mM sodium phos-
phate salts. Fig. 4 shows that the rate of chloride transport
facilitated by compound 6 under gradient conditions is greater
than in the absence of a pH gradient, implying that this mole-
cule can facilitate HCl symport in addition to anion–anion
antiport.
Fig. 4 Chloride efflux promoted by a DMSO solution of compound 6 (2 mol%
carrier to lipid) from unilamellar POPC vesicles loaded with either 451 mM NaCl
buffered to pH 7.2 with 20 mM sodium phosphate salts or 451 mM NaCl buffered
to pH 4.0 with 20 mM sodium citrate salts. The vesicles were dispersed in 150 mM
Na2SO4 buffered to pH 7.2 with 20 mM sodium phosphate salts. At the end of the
experiment, detergent was added to lyse the vesicles and calibrate the ISE to
100% chloride efflux. Each point represents an average of three trials. DMSO was
used as a control.

Proton transport was con?rmed using POPC vesicles loaded
with NaCl (488 mM) and 1 mM 8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfo-
nate (HPTS), a pH sensitive ?uorescent dye.46 These vesicles
were suspended in a solution of Na2SO4 (150 mM) and the HPTS
?uorescence measured upon addition of a DMSO solution of
compound 6. An increase in intravesicular pH was observed,
corresponding to deacidi?cation of the vesicles via either
H+/Cl? co-transport or an equivalent Cl?/OH? antiport pathway
(see ESI†).

Three modes of operation are known for synthetic trans-
membrane ion transporters; a mobile carrier mechanism,
channel formation, or a relay mechanism.47 We probed the
transport mechanism of these systems using an ion selective
electrode assay with POPC vesicles containing cholesterol (7 : 3
molar ratio). The vesicles were prepared containing sodium
chloride (488 mM with 5 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.2) and
suspended in a solution of sodium nitrate (488 mM with 5 mM
phosphate buffer at pH 7.2). By comparing the chloride efflux
observed in this assay with that observed in the absence of
cholesterol we can deduce if these molecules are mobile
carriers. Cholesterol decreases membrane ?uidity and thus
transport that relies on a diffusion mechanism (i.e. mobile
carrier), is expected to be slower in the presence of cholesterol.48

Compounds 2–7 all showed reduced chloride efflux in the
cholesterol containing vesicles (see ESI†).

Further evidence for a carrier mechanism was obtained from
U-tube experiments.15,44 A membrane is modelled by two
aqueous phases separated by a nitrobenzene organic phase. The
source phase was loaded with sodium chloride (488 mM buff-
ered to pH 7.2 with 5 mM sodium phosphate salts) and the
receiving phase was loaded with sodium nitrate (488 mM
buffered to pH 7.2 with 5 mM sodium phosphate salts). The
carrier (1 mM) was dissolved in the nitrobenzene phase and
chloride transport into the receiving phase was monitored
using an ion selective electrode. The separation of the two
aqueous phases rules out the possibility of channel formation.49

For solubility reasons only compounds 2, 4, 5 and 7 could be
tested in this way. All yielded a higher concentration of chloride
in the receiving phase than in the control (see ESI†). These
results are further evidence that the compounds operate via a
mobile carrier mechanism.

To quantify the transport activity of compounds 1–11 Hill
analyses50 for the chloride/nitrate and chloride/bicarbonate
antiport assays were performed (see ESI†). Hill analysis enables
determination of an EC50,270s value; the concentration of carrier
(mol% with respect to lipid) required to afford 50% chloride
efflux 270 s a?er addition of the carrier (or a?er the bicarbonate
‘pulse’), enabling us to compare the transport activity of the
compounds. These values are summarised in Table 2, together
with the Hill coefficients (which provide supporting evidence
for a mobile carrier mechanism), the calculated values for polar
surface area (PSA) and total surface area (TSA) and log P.51 The
PSA and TSA parameters were estimated as described in the
ESI† from molecular dynamic (MD) simulations carried out with
compounds 1–11 in water solution.

In general, we observed that incorporation of electron with-
drawing functionalities into the bisurea scaffold affords

5-positions improved transporter activity, but to a less dramatic
extent than the addition of electron withdrawing functionalities
to the 4-position of the peripheral phenyl groups. In these
instances transporter activity was observed to increase with
increasing electron withdrawing strength of the substituents
(represented by the Hammett constants shown in Table 3); H &amp;lt;F
? Cl &amp;lt;CF3 &amp;lt;CN &amp;lt;NO2. This trend is consequently re?ected in
the binding constants, with transport inactive receptor 1
exhibiting relatively low binding constants with chloride and
bicarbonate (43 M?1 and 1270 M?1 respectively), in comparison
to the most active transporter 6, (78 M?1 and 3770 M?1

respectively), re?ecting the strong electron withdrawing effect
of the nitro functionality. Indeed, para-nitro functionalised
compound 6 displays very high transport activity, facilitating
chloride efflux at receptor : lipid ratios as low as 1 : 1 000 000
(Fig. 5). To the best of our knowledge we believe that this is the
lowest loading level of transporter observed that can facilitate
transport to date.

We have also examined the effect of varying substituent posi-
tion on the peripheral phenyl rings (compounds 6, 7, and 8). The
nitro functionality is most electron withdrawing in the ortho- and
para-positions.52 para-Nitro functionalised compound 6 shows
greater transporter activity than meta-nitro functionalised
compound 7. The ortho-nitro functionalised compound 8 displays
poor transport activity, likely a consequence of the involvement of
the nitro group in intramolecular hydrogen bonding and also
sterically hindering the binding site.17b This is re?ected in the
stability constants for compound 8 with chloride and bicarbonate
(&lt;10 M?1 and 826 M?1 respectively) which are signi?cantly lower
than those observed for compounds 6 and 7.

Carboxylate transport

Recently, interest has grown in the construction of molecules
capable of discriminating between small isomeric dicarboxy-
lates.53 Several examples of bisurea compounds with structural

similarity to compounds 1–8, have been shown to selectively
bind carboxylates.54 Owing to this similarity, we postulated that
out most active transporters (4, 5 and 6) might be able to
facilitate the transmembrane transport of carboxylate anions.
The transmembrane transport of carboxylates is biologically
important; failure of glutamate transporters is linked neuro-
degenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s and Hunting-
don’s disease,55 whilst disruption of oxalate transport can result
in renal disorders.56

We decided to focus on the transmembrane transport of
fumarate and its stereoisomer, maleate. Fumarate has biolog-
ical importance as a key intermediate in the citric acid cycle.57

Carboxylate transport was examined using vesicles containing
sodium chloride buffered to pH 7.2, suspended in a solution of
sodium sulphate buffered at pH 7.2. Compounds 4, 5 and 6 were
added as solutions in DMSO (2 mol% with respect to lipid).

chloride efflux was observed on addition of a sodium maleate
‘pulse’ with all three compounds, whilst no signi?cant
enhancement in chloride efflux was seen with the sodium
fumarate ‘pulse’. The experiment was repeated at pH 4.0,
whereupon an enhancement in chloride efflux was observed
upon addition of both maleate and fumarate pulses (Fig. 7
shows compound 4 as a representative example).

We have already shown that pre-pulse chloride efflux is the
consequence of HCl symport and not sulfate transport or NaCl
symport. We can rationalise the pH dependant nature of the
transport by considering the pKa values for maleate (pKa1 ¼
1.92, pKa2 ¼ 6.23) and fumarate (pKa1 ¼ 3.02, pKa2 ¼ 4.38).52
Thus, at pH 7.2 a higher proportion of maleate exists as the
monoanion, whilst fumarate will predominantly exist as the
dianion. Dianions are more hydrophilic than their mono-
anionic counterparts and will consequently be more difficult to
transport.43 Hence, at pH 7.2 we observe an increase in chloride
transport upon addition of maleate, but little enhancement
upon addition of a fumarate. At pH 4.0 the monoionic forms of
both maleate and fumarate will predominate, and an increase
in chloride efflux was observed upon addition of both maleate
and fumarate, corresponding to chloride/carboxylate exchange.

In summary, we have observed that ortho-phenylenediamine-
based bisureas functionalised with electron withdrawing
substituents are potent ion transporters, facilitating chloride/
nitrate and chloride/bicarbonate antiport. In some instances we
have observed carboxylate/chloride antiport and HCl symport.
We have demonstrated that these compounds operate via a
mobile carrier mechanism and that sulphate transport and
metal/chloride symport processes are not facilitated.

toxic, whilst compounds 1 and 4 are the least toxic in the series
(Fig. 8).

Dose–response curve experiments were performed and IC50
values (Inhibitory Concentration of 50% of cell population)
were calculated for the most cytotoxic compounds (?uorinated
compounds 2 and 5, and nitro functionalised compound 8) in
the most sensitive cancerous cell lines (Table 4). These results
corroborate the potency of these cytotoxic receptors, showing
IC50 values around 10 mM in GLC4 cells.

We have previously reported that ?uorination is an effective
strategy for the production of compounds that can function as
cytotoxic agents in cancerous cell lines.15,44 In contrast, the
nitrophenyl group is a known toxicophore.58 The disruption of
intracellular pH (pHi) has been suggested as a strategy for
cancer treatment.59 Modulation of pHi is essential for control of
the cell cycle (amongst other cellular processes) and is regulated
by several mechanisms, including Na+/H+ co-transport,

? symport and H+ uniport.60 To

determine if the observed cytotoxicity was caused by sustained
changes in pHi compounds 1–8 were studied in A375 melanoma
cells stained with acridine orange (AO) (Fig. 9). Upon proton-
ation this cell-permeable dye displays an orange ?uorescence
and accumulates within acidic intracellular compartments.
Green ?uorescence is observed under the more basic conditions
of the cystol.61 Cells in basal conditions were stained with AO
and showed typical granular orange ?uorescence, correspond-
ing to cellular acidic compartments such as lysosomes (Fig. 9
Ct). A complete loss of orange ?uorescence was observed on
exposure to compounds 5, 6 and 7 and a signi?cant reduction in
orange ?uorescence was observed with compounds 2 and 3.
This corresponds to an increase in the pH of the intracellular
organelles, achieved through acidi?cation of the cytoplasm.
Granular orange ?uorescence was retained with compounds 1,
4 and 8, indicating that exposure to these compounds did not
facilitate changes in pHi. This ?nding, combined with the
inactivity of compound 8 in the vesicle based ion transport
assays, suggests that the cytotoxicity in this instance is the
result of a mechanism other than transmembrane ion
transport.58

Cancer cell death can be induced by sustained changes in
pHi.

facilitating ion transport processes that lower pHi.

the compounds that facilitated a reduction in pHi function as

? antiport agents in vesicle based

assays. In addition, the most active transporter (compound 6)
has been shown to facilitate HCl co-transport. The biological
activity observed in the AO assay could therefore be the direct
result of the transmembrane transport of HCl or bicarbonate, or
the result of ion transport coupled to the uniport of chloride.64

Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that facilitates
the removal of damaged cells without causing in?ammation
and can be induced by sustained changes in pHi. Nuclear
condensation, fragmentation and the formation of apoptotic
bodies are characteristic of this type of cell death.65 The type of
cell death induced by compounds 1–8 was examined using
Hoechst 33342 staining in A375 cells. Hoechst 33342 is a ?uo-
rescent nuclear dye, permitting changes in nuclear morphology
to be monitored. In Fig. 10 untreated A375 cells have typical
rounded nuclei (Ct). Following treatment with the compounds
(10 mM for 48 hours), the most cytotoxic compounds 2, 5 and 8
showed nuclear condensation (2a, 5a, 8a), and at 50 mM the
formation of apoptotic bodies was observed, con?rming that
these compounds induce apoptotic cell death (2b, 5b and 8b).

In summary, compounds 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 have been shown
to be toxic in a range of cancer cell lines. With the exception of

? antiport in vesicle based ion

transport assays. In an AO assay compounds 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 were
found to alter pHi in A375 cells and the formation of apoptotic
bodies was clearly observed with the most cytotoxic compounds
(2, 5 and 8) using Hoechst 33342 staining in A375 cells.
Compounds 2 and 5 facilitated apoptotic cell death in A375
cells, likely through sustained changes in pHi as a consequence
of in vitro ion transport. In contrast, compound 8 induced
apoptotic cell death but organelle deacidi?cation was not
observed in the AO assay. The cytotoxicity of this compound
thus appears to be unrelated to its ion transport activity
(compound 8 was found to be inactive in vesicle based ion
transport assays) and may therefore be the result of an alter-
native mechanism.58 Compound 5 was shown to reduce the
viability of the cell lines to a greater extent than compound 6
whilst compound 6 is the most effective anion transporter of the
two compounds. This could be due to differences between the
model membrane used for the vesicle studies and the biological
membranes present in the cells. We are continuing to study the
effects of these compounds on cells.
Molecular dynamics simulations on POPC bilayer model

The ability of 5 and 6 to permeate a POPC bilayer model, being
the ?rst step towards the anion transport, was also investigated
by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the AMBER12
so?ware.66 These mobile carriers were selected taking into
account that, among the ortho-phenylendimine-based bisureas,
5 with two p-CF3 substituents is signi?cantly the more lipophilic
one, while 6 functionalized with two p-NO2 withdrawing elec-
tron substituents is the most active Cl?/HCO3

These modelling studies were carried out with 5$Cl?, 6$Cl?

and 5$HCO3
? complexes and using a bilayer system (square in

the xy plane), composed of 128 POPC lipids and 6500 TIP3P
water molecules,67 as model of a POPC vesicle. The compounds
5 and 6 and bicarbonate anion were described with GAFF68 and
RESP atomic charges (see ESI for details†), while the LIPID11

membrane simulations were performed under periodic
boundary conditions in a NPT ensemble at 303 K with a surface
tension of 17 dyn cm?1 and an 8 A? cut-off for van der Waals and
non-bonded electrostatic interactions following the protocol
detailed in ESI.†

The starting binding arrangements of the anionic complexes
were determined in gas phase by quenched molecular dynamics
as stated in ESI.† In the lowest energy structures of the halide
complexes, the two-bisurea binding sites adopt a syn con?gu-
ration, establishing four N–H/Cl? hydrogen bonds. In the
5$HCO3

? complex, three N–H binding sites form three N–H/O
hydrogen bonds with an oxygen atom from the –CO2

? group
while the remaining N–H binding site is involved in a N–H/O
single hydrogen bond with the other oxygen atom from this
group. These two binding scenarios are illustrated in Fig. 11
with the structures of 5$Cl? and 5$HCO3

? complexes, along
with hydrogen bonds lengths.

A?erwards, 5$Cl?, 6$Cl? and 5$HCO3
? complexes were

initially positioned in the water slab of a pre-equilibrated
POPC bilayer at distances larger than 8 A? away from the water–
lipid interface (see Fig. S95 in ESI†) and subject to a production
run of 80 ns simulation length, preceded by a multi-stage

equilibration process (see ESI†). Two independent replicates
(R1 and R2) were performed for each system using
different initial velocities and comparable sequences of events
were observed as described below. The chloride and bicar-
bonate anions are promptly solvated by water molecules and
released in the water phase before either 5 or 6 reach the
water–lipid interface, which occurs within the ?rst 20 ns of the
production runs as depicted in Fig. 12 for all anion complexes.
This ?rst insight indicates that in the water phase, 5 displays
equivalent binding behaviours towards both anions and
henceforth the simulations carried out with 5$Cl? and
5$HCO3

? are analysed together. A?erwards, the free receptors
interact with the membrane interface in a comparable fashion.
Indeed, 5 is able to either permeate the membrane or to
remain at the interface during almost of the subsequent
simulation time, as also evident in Fig. 12 (top and middle
plots). Surprisingly, the two replicates performed with 6$Cl?

reveal that this less lipophilic receptor (see Table 2) permeates
the membrane more easily, which can be correlated with the
population of N–H/O]P hydrogen bonds established
between the amide binding sites and phosphate head groups,
as discussed below.

The events’ sequences associated with the passive diffusion
of 5 and 6 towards POPC, described above, are illustrated in
Fig. 13 and 14 with three consecutive snapshots taken from the
MD simulations of 5$Cl? and 6$Cl? complexes, respectively.

Fig. 13 and 14 show that the ?rst interaction of 5 and 6 with
membrane occurs through the p-CF3 or p-NO2 groups from an
ortho-phenyldiamine substituent. Subsequently, regardless of
the relative position of the receptors to the interface, both p-
substituents of 5 are preferentially located between the lipids
chains, pointing to the bilayer core, while the ortho-phenyldi-
amine head with the two syn urea binding units are closer to the
water–lipid interface, thus able to form strong hydrogen
bonding interactions with the phosphate head groups as shown
in Fig. 15 (le?). This is particularly evident in replicates R2 and
R1 of complexes 5$Cl? and 5$HCO3

receptor mainly remains at the water–lipid interface throughout

the course of the MD simulation (see Fig. 12, top and middle
plots, above and Fig. S96,† le? and right top plots). In contrast,
the slightly lighter receptor 6 (mol. wt 436.11 of 6 vs. 482.12 of 5)
permeates the phospholipid bilayer more deeply during the
simulation time (see Fig. 12, bottom) with a non-speci?c spatial
orientation consistent with the existence of sporadic N–H/O]
P hydrogen bonds. These interactions generally occur via a
single urea binding unit, as depicted in Fig. 15 (right), and are
observed during both MD simulations replicates of 6$Cl? (see
Fig. S96,† bottom), in spite of this receptor higher propensity to
establish hydrogen bonding interactions (see Table 3). In other
words, these results seem to indicate that N–H binding sites of 6
are available to bind the anions and consequently to promote
their transmembrane transport, in agreement with the chloride
efflux experimental data.

In order to ascertain the impact of 5 and 6 on the structural
properties of the POPC bilayer, the aforementioned simulations
were preceded by a simulation of the free membrane under the
same computational conditions. The following structural
membrane parameters, area per lipid, bilayer thickness, elec-
tronic density pro?le and order parameters were evaluated and
compared with the corresponding experimental data and with
those found for the last 10 ns of MD replicates of 5$Cl?, 6$Cl?

and 5$HCO3
? complexes. The ?rst two parameters’ values are

listed in Table 5, whereas the corresponding electronic density
pro?les and order parameters are plotted in Fig. S100 to S105.†
As would be expected, the average values of the area per lipid
(64.38 A?2) and bilayer thickness (38.28 A?) calculated for the free
membrane are similar to those recently obtained by neutron
scattering (64.30 A?2 and 39.10 A?),71 and as reported when a
POPC bilayer with 128 lipids is simulated using the aforemen-
tioned simulation conditions.69 The interaction of 5 and 6 with
the membrane produces a slight decrease in the area per lipid
(&lt;4.8%) and, consequently, a slight increase in the bilayer
thickness (&lt;2.2%), indicating that the in?uence of both recep-
tors on these two structural parameters is small. The order
parameters for saturated (sn-1) and unsaturated (sn-2) POPC
lipid chains of the free membrane (see Fig. S99†) follow the ones
previously found with LIPID11.69 Similar pro?les were obtained
for the membrane simulations carried out with 5 and 6 (see
Fig. S103 to S105†), suggesting that the order parameters are
unaffected by the presence of the receptors. In fact, the single
exception was found for the sn-2 tails of POPC in replicate R2 of
5$Cl? in which the receptor is preferentially located near of the
water–lipid interface. Furthermore, the electronic density
pro?les for all simulated systems show that the bilayer structure
is preserved without apparent interdigitation between the
phospholipid tails as shown in Fig. S100 to S102, and further
discussed in ESI.† In addition, the electronic density pro?les for
the receptors are consistent with their relative position to the
water–lipid interface throughout the simulation time, as rep-
resented in Fig. 12.

more computationally demanding, are currently in progress.
However, the studies reported here have unequivocally shown
that two of the most promising receptors are able to permeate
the membrane, having a low impact in its structure, being
capable of mediating anion transport as mobile carriers.
Conclusions

We have demonstrated that the ortho-phenylenebisurea motif is
a new scaffold for the construction of transmembrane ion
transporters that function by an anion antiport and in some
cases a HCl co-transport mechanism. Addition of electron
withdrawing groups to either the central core or the peripheral
phenyl groups yielded potent anion transporters for the trans-
membrane transport of chloride, nitrate and bicarbonate with
transport observed at receptor: lipid concentration ratios as low
as 1 : 1 000 000. Compounds 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 were found to be
cytotoxic in a range of cancer cell lines. AO assays con?rmed
that these compounds can facilitate a reduction in pHi and the
two most cytotoxic compounds (2 and 5) were found to induce
apoptosis in A375 cells. We have also demonstrated that our
most active transporters (4, 5 and 6) can facilitate the trans-
membrane transport of carboxylate species. We are continuing
to study the transport of biologically relevant carboxylates. The
results of these studies will be reported in due course. The MD
results have demonstrated, at the atomic level, the ability of 5
and 6 to permeate the membrane while having a reduced
in?uence on its properties.
