Abstract 

Blocking high pressure systems are large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns with 

meteorological impacts that vary across regions and seasons, depending on the blocking location, 

spatial characteristics and temporal length. While blocking episodes are an important component 

of intra-seasonal and inter-annual variability at mid-latitudes, particularly in Europe, previous 

studies have mostly focused on characterizing European blocking impacts on either winter or 

summer seasons. In this thesis, a thorough characterization of Euro-Atlantic blocking occurrence 

within different longitudinal sectors (Atlantic, European and Russian) was performed, followed 

by a comprehensive analysis of their seasonal impacts on temperature and on the precipitation 

regimes of the European continent and specific sub-regions, with particular emphasis on Iberia, 

and on extreme events. In order to distinguish high-latitude blocking from other common high 

pressure systems affecting Europe, namely sub-tropical ridges, a novel ridge detection scheme was 

developed. Ridges do not require a wave-breaking occurrence as blockings do, although they are 

frequent precursors of wave-breaking, which may lead to blocking. Thus, as an additional novelty, 

this thesis also characterizes the distinctive seasonal impacts associated with sub-tropical ridges 

occurring at different longitudinal sectors of the Euro-Atlantic region. Finally, an assessment of 

the involved mechanisms behind the temperature and precipitation responses to blocking is also 

carried out. This included for precipitation the role of cyclonic activity (storm-tracks and cut-off 

lows), moisture transport, and large-scale atmospheric instability, while for temperature the focus 

was on the role played by horizontal advection, subsidence and imbalances in various radiation 

budgets.   

This distinction clarifies that most extreme heat episodes in southern Europe and Mediterranean 

areas should not be attributed to blockings, but rather to ridges. In central and northern areas of 

the continent, both regimes are responsible for warm conditions in summer, due to enhanced 

radiative heating and increased subsidence. During winter, blocking and ridges lead to opposite 

temperature responses. Blocking reinforces cold northerly advection in its eastern flank, thus 

promoting European cold winter spells, especially those located in the eastern Atlantic and western 

Europe, while mild Atlantic flows associated to ridge patterns result in warmer conditions.  

Regarding the impacts on precipitation, blocking and ridges are associated with a marked north-

south dipole for the three considered longitudinal sectors of occurrence. While blocking patterns 

force a split of the storm-track, ridges are associated with a stronger zonal flow at higher latitudes. 

Thus, negative (positive) precipitation anomalies during blocks occur at higher (lower) latitudes. 

Enhanced atmospheric instability and cyclonic activity south of blocking centers relate very well 

with increased rainfall in southern Europe, including Iberia, where torrential regimes are more 

relevant in the precipitation totals. This dipole is reversed during ridges, which lead to dry 

conditions in southern Europe. The seasonal analysis further reveals that winters characterized by 

high frequencies of blocking (ridge) occurrence present above (below) average snow covered soils. 

Blocking/ridge impacts on temperature and precipitation have also additional effects on 

meteorological and climate extreme events with large socio-economic impacts. Thus, the results 

show a blocking/ridge role at different time-scales in controlling a significant part of wildfire inter-

annual variability in Mediterranean areas. Meteorological pre-conditioning raises vegetation stress 

during dry winters, while increased ridge and blocking occurrence in summer fosters 

meteorological conditions which are prone to fire ignition and spread. Finally, outputs from state-

of-the-art General Circulation Models raise the challenge to develop further these automated 

schemes for blocking/ridges detection, as their representation in climate models is crucial to 

understand impacts towards the later decades of the 21st century. 

Summing up, the main novelties and achievements of this thesis are: 1) the clear disentanglement 

between blocks and ridges; 2) the seasonal analyses of specific regional impacts resulting from 

different locations of blocking/ridge structures; 3) the detailed analysis of dynamical/physical 

forcing mechanisms associated to each considered weather pattern.

Resumo 

Apesar de não existir uma definição unanimemente aceite para o conceito de bloqueio 

atmosférico, este pode ser descrito como uma supressão do fluxo zonal devido à presença de 

um sistema de alta pressão. Esta circulação anticiclónica, normalmente localizada nas latitudes 

onde se observa a corrente de jato polar, apresenta uma dimensão espacial de larga-escala, é 

geralmente quase-estacionária, e tem um tempo de vida útil entre vários dias a várias semanas. 

Os sectores orientais dos oceanos Atlântico e Pacífico são geralmente as regiões de ocorrência 

preferencial de bloqueios no Hemisfério Norte. A ocorrência de bloqueios atmosféricos está 

diretamente associada a condições prolongadas de tempo seco e estável nas regiões diretamente 

localizadas sob o sistema de altas pressões. O seu posicionamento geralmente origina uma 

divisão em dois ramos da corrente de jato. Esta perturbação do habitual padrão zonal resulta em 

alterações significativas das condições meteorológicas a outras latitudes (tanto meridional como 

setentrional) distintas da zona diretamente afetada pela posição central do bloqueio. 

Torna-se necessária assim uma compreensão mais detalhada da climatologia associada aos 

bloqueios atmosféricos centrados no setor Euro-Atlântico, com especial ênfase aos impactos 

específicos associados às diferentes localizações que os seus centros de ação possam ter. Apesar 

de serem um fenómeno que ocorre à escala sinóptica, os bloqueios podem implicar impactos 

climáticos muito distintos à escala regional, ou mesmo local. Desta forma, um dos principais 

objetivos desta tese centra-se na elaboração de uma climatologia completa da sua ocorrência, e 

na respetiva caracterização dos impactos climáticos regionais resultantes da ocorrência de 

bloqueios em diferentes sectores longitudinais: Atlântico (ATL; 30W-0W), Europeu (EUR; 0E-

30E) e Russo (RUS; 30E-60E).  

Tendo-se verificado na literatura uma certa confusão entre bloqueio de alta latitude e outros 

sistemas comuns de alta pressão que afetam a Europa, nomeadamente as cristas sub-tropicais, 

foi considerado prioritário obter um novo catálogo de cristas de alta pressão para o setor Euro-

Atlântico. Desta forma, um segundo objetivo central da tese foi o do desenvolvimento de um 

novo algoritmo automático de deteção de cristas sub-tropicais, que permita assim realizar uma 

clara distinção fenomenológica e dos impactos destes dois padrões atmosféricos (bloqueios 

versus cristas). Assim, a compreensão das condições sinópticas e dos mecanismos físicos 

envolvidos em cada um destes padrões é também tema central desta tese. No caso da 

precipitação, esta análise de mecanismos incluiu o papel da atividade ciclónica (storm-tracks e 

cut-off lows), do transporte de humidade e da instabilidade atmosférica em larga escala. Para 

avaliar os impactos na temperatura analisou-se a contribuição da advecção horizontal, da 

subsidência e das alterações nos vários balanços radiativos. 

A desagregação bloqueios-cristas permite distinguir fenomenologias por vezes confundidas 

na literatura, nomeadamente aquando da análise de episódios de calor extremo no sul da Europa. 

Verifica-se dos resultados obtidos que, devido a uma clara distinção no posicionamento 

latitudinal dos centros de ação entre bloqueios e cristas, as respostas na temperatura associadas 

a cada padrão são também bem distintas, sendo estas diferenças particularmente notáveis no 

inverno. De uma forma geral, nesta estação, os bloqueios (essencialmente os centrados nos 



vi 

 

sectores ATL e EUR) resultam em valores das temperaturas do ar bastante abaixo da média, 

provocadas pela advecção de ar frio de latitudes mais elevadas ao longo do flanco este dos 

anticiclones. Em oposição, as cristas originam anomalias positivas na temperatura na maior 

parte do continente europeu, essencialmente como resultado do transporte de massas de ar de 

origem Atlântica, e de uma redução do arrefecimento radiativo, associado ao aumento da 

nebulosidade. Durante o verão, ambos os padrões atmosféricos estão associados a temperaturas 

acima da média em vastas áreas da Europa central e do norte. Em contrapartida, nas regiões 

mais a sul, e em particular na área da bacia do Mediterrâneo, as cristas controlam a ocorrência 

de dias extremamente quentes (usualmente identificados como ondas de calor). No verão é 

também de salientar o papel dominante do aquecimento radiativo solar (sob condições de céu 

limpo) como principal impulsionador destas anomalias positivas de temperatura em dias de 

ocorrência de bloqueio/crista, particularmente para os sistemas localizados sobre áreas 

continentais. 

Relativamente aos impactos nos regimes de precipitação, existe um claro dipolo norte-sul ao 

analisar as anomalias associadas a dias de bloqueio/crista. A ocorrência de bloqueios leva a uma 

redução da precipitação na metade norte do continente Europeu (em algumas áreas superior a 

50%) devido ao bloqueio dos sistemas depressionários de médias-latitudes (e do correspondente 

transporte de humidade) provenientes do Atlântico. No entanto, esta configuração sinóptica leva 

a um aumento da precipitação (relativamente à média) nas zonas mais a sul, fundamentalmente 

relacionado com o desvio do storm-track nesta direção, e a um consequente aumento da 

instabilidade atmosférica e da convecção. Este padrão resulta numa clara mudança nas 

distribuições de regimes de precipitação nos países do sul da Europa, e demonstra também a 

ligação entre bloqueios atmosféricos e os regimes de precipitação torrencial na área do 

Mediterrâneo. Em padrões de fluxo zonal intenso as anomalias da precipitação são no geral 

opostas às encontradas durante bloqueios, originando um deficit de precipitação no sul da 

Europa. No contexto dos vários regimes possíveis de fluxo zonal forte, as cristas sub-tropicais 

estão associadas a condições particularmente secas nos países do sul da Europa. Isto 

naturalmente também se aplica à Península Ibérica, onde os totais anuais de precipitação 

dependem largamente da atividade frontal de origem Atlântica (em particular nos meses de 

inverno), sendo esta afastada da região durante a ocorrência de cristas nos sectores ATL e EUR. 

Neste contexto, mostra-se crucial o recurso a bases de dados de alta-resolução com uma 

densidade de estações muito mais elevada, permitindo uma análise regional mais detalhada para 

o domínio da Península Ibérica. 

 Os bloqueios centrados em latitudes elevadas, em particular os que ocorrem no sector ATL, 

são responsáveis por invernos com maior cobertura de neve no continente Europeu (até cerca 

de 50% mais dias com a superfície coberta de neve na Europa central), devido a uma maior 

frequência de dias frios sob os fluxos de norte associados à circulação anticiclónica. Por outro 

lado, a ocorrência de cristas nos sectores ATL e EUR (que estão associadas a dias de inverno 

bastante amenos) impõe uma frequência muito mais baixa de dias com neve no solo. 

Foi também concluído que os padrões de bloqueio/crista exercem um efeito regulador 

importante na variabilidade inter-anual de incêndios florestais. Mostra-se que o feedback 



vii 

 

existente entre a ocorrência destes padrões atmosféricos, a ocorrência de secas, e os incêndios 

florestais, acontece a diferentes escalas temporais. Nos meses antecedentes à época de 

incêndios, uma frequência superior ao normal de cristas (bloqueios) é responsável por valores 

de precipitação abaixo (acima) da média no sul da Europa, aumentando a vulnerabilidade da 

vegetação. Durante a própria época de incêndios, este padrão atmosférico está associado a 

condições anomalamente quentes e secas que promovem a ignição e fácil propagação do fogo. 

Finalmente, no contexto das alterações climáticas, verificou-se que nas últimas décadas a 

frequência de cristas sub-tropicais aumentou bastante no sul da Europa. As projeções futuras 

dos Modelos de Circulação Geral sugerem uma expansão para norte das altas pressões sub-

tropicais (associadas à expansão da célula de Hadley). Por outro lado, não existem sinais 

dinâmicos de alterações muito significativas na frequência e localização dos bloqueios de alta 

latitude no sector Euro-Atlântico, exceto uma ligeira tendência de deslocamento para nordeste 

na sua região preferencial de ocorrência. Pretende-se como trabalho futuro utilizar também uma 

abordagem dinâmica (não apenas baseada em campos de anomalia) para o algoritmo de deteção 

de cristas, que permitirá uma maior confiança na extrapolação para cenários futuros.

1.1 Large-scale variability and the European climate 
 

Although Europe lies within the northern temperate climate zone, its relative large extension 

encloses a wide range of different climates (Barry and Chorley, 2010). Kottek et al (2006) have 

developed an updated version of the Köppen-Geiger climatic classification map that is shown 

here for the European continent (Fig 1.1). While oceanic climate classifications predominate in 

western sectors, temperate and cool continental climates are characteristic of eastern and 

northern countries. The Mediterranean basin is dominated by warm and temperate Mediterranean 

classes, which are characterized by wet winter and dry and hot summers (see Fig. 1.1). The 

prevailing westerly zonal flow and the associated Jetstream control a large fraction of the 

European climate, although disruptions of the Jetstream frequently alter significantly the usual 

precipitation and temperature distributions. A large part of the inter-annual variability in 

European weather is modulated by a few synoptic structures (e.g. the Azores high, Iceland low, 

Jetstream, storm-tracks). Amongst them, quasi-stationary high pressure systems referred to as 

blocking, are one of the main weather regimes disrupting the mean European conditions (Rex, 

1950a,b).

In order to frame a large-scale phenomenon such as blocking, in terms of climatology and 

impacts over the European continent, as intended throughout this thesis, it is firstly required to 

present the main large-scale atmospheric variability modes that affect the study area at different 

time scales. In the following sub-sections, the links between these circulation modes (as well as 

other remote atmospheric and oceanic phenomena) and the European climate variability at 

different time-scales (from a long-term perspective to inter-annual variations), are briefly 

described, taking also into account the Mediterranean environment. 

 

1.1.1 Inter-decadal and inter-annual temperature variability 

At long temporal scales, the rate of global warming in the post-industrial era is unprecedented 

(Luterbacher et al., 2004; Mann et al. 2009; Ljungqvist et al., 2012) and leads to a generalized 

consensus on an anthropogenic fingerprint (Cook et al., 2013; Fischer and Knutti, 2015). An 

apparent hiatus in this steep recent warming trend has been discussed in recent years (e.g. 

Seneviratne et al., 2014). However, the successive record temperature years at the global scale, 

including 2014, 2015 and 2016 have now undermined the concept of hiatus (e.g. Su et al., 2017).  

Superimposed on this long-term trend, the mean temperature in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) 

during the 20th century has been characterized by a multi-decadal warming-cooling-warming 

pattern (Li et al., 2013), with the latter being particularly notable through the early stages of the 

21st century. The work by Peña-Ortiz et al. (2015) corroborates a similar behavior in the 

European region, as the authors refer to a shortening of the summer season in Europe throughout 

the 1950-1978 period, and a notable lengthening in the post-1979 period. To understand the 

multi-decadal changes within the long-term temperature trend it is mandatory to take into 

account the effects of internal variability, including several oscillatory phenomena associated 

with Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies, such as the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation 

(AMO) or the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). A close relation between the AMO phase and 

the mean temperature of the NH and the European continent has been reported by several authors 

(Li et al., 2013; Mann et al., 2014; Peña-Ortiz et al., 2015; Zampieri et al., 2016), with the 

cooling phases of the AMO signal likely offsetting some of the anthropogenic warming (see Fig. 

1.2). Gámiz-Fortis et al. (2011) have shown that the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) of the 

Atlantic Ocean is able to  account  for  about  12%  of  the  north-western  European  land 

surface temperature variance. These authors also stress that the AMO influence on European 

temperature is not only regional-dependent, but also non-stationary in time, as links change 

significantly throughout the decades.

atmospheric CO2 concentrations. b) The 11-year running means of the de-trended Northern

decadal Oscillation (AMO). The pink shaded areas in (a) and (b) show the 2-sigma uncertainty 

ranges. From Li et al. (2013). 

 

At the inter- and intra-annual temporal scales, multi-decadal variability modes, such as the 

AMO and PDO are not critical due to the intrinsic mismatch of temporal scales. Instead, 

emphasis must be oriented toward large-scale teleconnection patterns which in turn modulate 

atmospheric circulation conditions at shorter spatio-temporal scales. With this aim, a number of 

different methodological approaches have been developed to derive the most important large-

scale patterns of atmospheric circulation, particularly those affecting Europe and North America, 

as summarized in major review works (e.g. Wallace and Gutzler, 1981; Yarnal, 1993; Barry and 

Carleton 2001). Besides the methodology to extract the relevant atmospheric patterns, many 

authors have been particularly interested in evaluating the associated impacts on the surface 

climate at the continental and regional scales. In Europe, some of the most important circulation 

patterns are connected with anomalies of the North Atlantic eddy-driven Jetstream, particularly

for winter. These most relevant circulation modes are depicted in Fig.1.3, namely: a) North 

Atlantic Oscillation (NAO); b) East Atlantic (EA); c) East Atlantic / Western Russia (EA/WR); 

d) Scandinavian (SCA) patterns. In other seasons, the climate of the region is also influenced by 

remote patterns from subtropical latitudes, as well as global phenomena, often involving 

atmosphere-ocean interactions (García-Herrera and Barriopedro, 2017).

height fields at 500 hPa during winter.  

 

The NAO (Fig. 1.3a) is the leading mode of atmospheric circulation variability over the Euro-

Atlantic sector, and is characterized by a seesaw of atmospheric mass between the Iceland Low 

and the Azores High (e.g., Hurrell and Deser 2009). On intra-seasonal time-scales, the NAO is  

associated with variations  in  the  latitude  of  the  North  Atlantic  Jetstream  and  storm-tracks,  

while  on the inter-annual time-scales  it  characterizes  changes  in  their  strength (Woollings et 

al., 2014). Regarding the European temperature responses to NAO, characterized by warmer 

conditions in central and northern Europe during its positive phase, it has been shown that 

besides its phase, the exact location of the NAO centers of action is more determinant in southern 

than in central and northern Europe (e.g. Castro-Díez et al., 2002). Also, the particularities of the 

summer NAO - characterized by a meridional dipole with low pressures over Greenland and high

pressures over the UK - have also been explored. For example, its positive phase promotes cold 

and wet summers in central and eastern Mediterranean (Bladé et al. 2012; Mariotti and 

Dell’Aquila 2012). Other atmospheric circulation patterns (e.g., SCA, EA and EA/WR) become 

also quite relevant in terms of inter-annual variability of temperature at the European and 

regional scales (e.g. Trigo et al., 2008; García-Herrera and Barriopedro, 2017). Fig. 1.4 shows 

the most relevant modes of variability for this variable in European areas, including the 

Mediterranean basin.

annual variations during winter (DJF, left panel) and summer (JJA, right panel) seasons of the 1951-

2013 period. Colors identify the large-scale phenomenon with the largest Pearson correlation 

coefficient with seasonal-mean temperature data. Dots highlight areas displaying significant 

correlations with more than one teleconnection pattern. The following large-scale phenomena are 

considered in the analysis: North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), East Atlantic pattern (EA), East 

Atlantic / Western Russian pattern (EA/WR), Scandinavian pattern (SCA), El Niño index (NINO3.4) 

and the high-summer NAO (SNAO). Adapted from García-Herrera and Barriopedro (2017). 

 

As mentioned above, atmospheric teleconnections are closely related to the occurrence of 

specific weather regimes, such as atmospheric blocks, albeit often not explicitly. As better 

described in Section 1.2, atmospheric blocking is associated with disruptions of the usual 

westerly flow from a few days to weeks, thus causing significant changes in the synoptic 

environment (Trigo et al., 2004; Silmann and Croci-Maspolli, 2009), and consequently on the 

regional temperature in Europe. This topic will be discussed in detail in Chapter 2. 

 

 

 

1.1.2 European temperature extremes 
 

There is a vast literature focusing on European temperature extremes, including both cold and 

hot extremes, regional impacts, and the atmospheric circulation patterns which enhance them 

(e.g. Barriopedro et al., 2011, Horton et al., 2015). Several studies have pointed that anomalies in 

the North Atlantic atmospheric flow are crucial to modulate winter, spring and autumn

occurrences of both cold nights and warm days in Europe (e.g. Andrade et al., 2012; Cattiaux et 

al., 2012). More specifically, atmospheric blocking is tightly linked with the occurrence of 

extreme temperature events (Trigo et al., 2004; Buehler et al., 2011; Pfahl, 2014), although the 

majority of the studies focus on cold extremes during the winter season only. 

In recent years, some exceptional extreme cold winter episodes have occurred in Europe, such 

as the 2009-2010 winter (Cattiaux et al., 2010), driven by record persistent negative phases of the 

NAO and enhanced blocking conditions. The late stages of the 2011-2012 winter were also 

exceptionally cold over large parts of Europe, and took place after the occurrence of a Sudden 

Stratospheric Warming episode (WMO, 2012). Further back in time, a close link between 

anomalously cold winters in Europe and enhanced blocking occurrence had already been 

explored by Lejenäs (1989), presenting the winter of 1941-1942 as a vivid example. The 

blocking-driven frigid conditions were associated with some of the most poignant episodes of 

World War II, particularly the dramatic siege of Leningrad. Similarly, the historical cold winter 

of 1962-1963, one the bitterest seasons of the 20th century in the UK (see Table 1.1), was 

recently explored by Burt (2013), who reported prolonged cold temperatures that were are only 

comparable to episodes occurring in one of the coldest periods of the last millennium, i.e. during 

the so-called Late Maunder Minimum (LMM, ca. 1685–1715 - Wanner et al. 1995; Luterbacher 

et al. 2001, 2004; Xoplaki et al. 2005). Several studies have suggested that the LMM exhibited 

recurrent winter anticyclonic conditions over eastern Europe (Luterbacher et al. 2001; Jacobeit et 

al. 2003; Pauling et al. 2006). More specifically, Wanner et al. (1995) indicated an enhanced 

blocking frequency in the 1690’s decade, and Kington (1999) indicated that in the 1698 winter, 

the circulation over the British Isles was dominated by blocking conditions.

Some of the most remarkable extreme temperature episodes in Europe correspond to recent 

major summer heatwaves, sometimes coined mega-heatwaves (Barriopedro et al. 2011; Miralles 

et al., 2014). The striking heatwave of 2003 affected large parts of western and central Europe, 

and caused substantial socio-economic impacts, including excessive mortality, damages in 

agricultural crops (Poumadere et al., 2005; García-Herrera et al., 2010) or intensive wildfires 

(e.g. Trigo et al., 2006b). This persistent episode, culminating in the first two weeks of August, 

reached summer temperature anomalies as large as 5ºC (Black et al., 2004). Another outstanding 

episode occurred in the summer of 2010 - the warmest summer at the European scale since at

least 1500 (Barriopedro et al. 2011). This prolonged episode caused unprecedented catastrophic 

wildfires, and increased mortality in Russia. These mega-heatwaves lasted for a period longer 

than usual and achieved record-breaking temperatures over extensive swathes of land, thus being 

also unusual from a full summer seasonal perspective (Fig. 1.5). While the exceptional 2010 

Russian event was unambiguously associated with persistent blocking over the area (e.g., 

Barriopedro et al. 2011; Dole et al. 2011), the characterization of the weather conditions that 

occurred during the mega-heatwave of 2003 was not so clear, with some studies pointing to 

blocking systems (e.g., Trigo et al., 2005) and others suggesting an anomalous northward 

intrusion of sub-tropical ridges (e.g., García-Herrera et al. 2010). Given the outstanding effects 

of the 2003 event, it is of paramount importance to characterize these two weather systems and 

disentangle their associated impacts. This question will be further addressed in Section 1.2.   

 

1.1.3 European precipitation regimes 
 

A wide range of approaches to characterize atmospheric circulation and its links with European 

precipitation regimes is available in the literature, ranging from teleconnection patterns to 

weather type catalogues (e.g., Barry and Carleton 2001). The role of the NAO has been 

recurrently analyzed, with its positive phase being associated to a stronger Jetstream and wetter 

conditions in central and northern areas of Europe (e.g. Trigo et al., 2008), and drier than average 

conditions in southern areas of the European continent (Lavers and Villarini, 2013). This dipole 

of positive (negative) correlation between the NAO and precipitation in northern (southern) 

regions represents the leading canonical correlation mode between atmospheric circulation and 

European precipitation inter-annual variability (e.g., Trigo et al., 2008). This signature is 

particularly relevant in autumn, winter and spring, with weaker links obtained in summer, where 

the NAO effects are more restricted to northern areas of the continent and the Balkans (Folland 

et al., 2009; Bladé et al. 2012). Vicente-Serrano and López-Moreno (2008) have analyzed the 

nonstationary influence of the NAO in European precipitation, pointing to inter-decadal shifts in 

the location of the NAO pressure centers, and to a general trend towards a strengthening of the 

NAO-precipitation relationship over most of Europe during the 20th century.  

Other teleconnection indices have been widely linked with anomalous European precipitation, 

such as the SCA (related to high-latitude blocking occurrence over Scandinavia), or the EA 

pattern (Trigo et al., 2008; García-Herrera and Barriopedro, 2017). Figure 1.6 shows the 

European areas affected by some of the most relevant modes of variability for precipitation inter-

annual variability. The role of global phenomena such as ENSO should also not be disregarded 

(Pozo-Vázquez et al., 2005; Bulic et al., 2012). Taking into account the reasonable predictability 

of the ENSO, several authors have explored this link in order to improve the skill of seasonal 

forecast for Europe. However, this is not easy to achieve, as the influence of the ENSO signal on 

the European climate is seasonal- and regional-dependent, not linear with respect to the 

magnitude of the ENSO event, and depends on other inter-annual and even inter-decadal 

variability modes (e.g. Brönnimann, 2007). 



1. Introduction

At shorter time scales, several authors have linked Weather Types daily classifications with 

precipitation regimes. For example, Cortesi et al. (2014) used a Lamb classification to analyze 

the spatial variability of Iberian precipitation, following pioneering works in this topic, such as 

Trigo and DaCamara (2000). Circulation Weather Types have often been used to characterize 

regional responses, as they are usually defined and calibrated on relatively small domains, thus 

reflecting atmospheric configurations at synoptic. Differently, European precipitation responses 

to large-scale atmospheric systems, such as blocking, can be explored by describing blocking-

related synoptic conditions (Trigo et al., 2004). Using this approach, European blocking has been 

found to exert a large influence on winter precipitation over large areas of Europe (Trigo et al., 

2004). For seasons other than winter, the impacts of blocking remain unexplored. In addition, a 

regional classification of blocking is needed, since blocking occurrence within different 

longitudinal sectors can lead to very distinct synoptic configurations. These questions will be 

addressed in Chapter 3, paying special attention to the precipitation responses over the Iberian 

Peninsula in Chapter 4.

coefficient with seasonal-mean precipitation data. Dots highlight areas displaying significant 

correlations with more than one teleconnection pattern. The following large-scale phenomena are

Atlantic / Western Russian pattern (EA/WR), Scandinavian pattern (SCA), El Niño index (NINO3.4) 

and the high-summer NAO (SNAO). Adapted from García-Herrera and Barriopedro (2017). 

 

1.1.4 Drought conditions throughout the 20th century 

Droughts are complex events with severe environmental, economic and social impacts. From a 

meteorological and hydrological point of view, droughts can be defined as shortages in water 

availability throughout prolonged periods, which may be considered at different time-scales, 

depending on the specific water resource we are interested in (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010).  



1. Introduction 
 

12 
 

In Europe, droughts have recurrently affected wet areas, such as western and central Europe 

(Rebetez et al., 2006), eastern Europe (Spinoni et al., 2013) or Scandinavia (Hisdal et al., 2006). 

Spinoni et al. (2015) have shown that droughts have been more frequent in northern Europe and 

Russia in the 1950s and 1960s, whilst for central areas it was during the 1970s, and for southern 

European regions in the later decades of the 20th century (see Fig. 1.7). In agreement with such 

assessment, Lloyd-Hughes and Saunders (2002) stated that the secular trend in rainfall has been 

positive in the region from the Alps to northern Scandinavia, while a drying tendency is found 

for eastern Europe and Mediterranean regions.

regions. The bold lines represent the 5-year moving weighted averages. Adapted from Spinoni et al. 

(2015). 

  

Overall, most concerns have been centered in semi-arid regions, such as southern Europe, and 

in particular, over the Mediterranean basin (Hoerling et al., 2012; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2014). 

The observed drying trends (particularly notable in the late 20th century) have persisted during 

the beginning of the 21st century. Major drought episodes have occurred in the western 

Mediterranean during 2005 (García-Herrera et al., 2007) and 2012 (Trigo et al., 2013a), with an 

almost continuous drought in the eastern Mediterranean and the contiguous unstable area of the 

Fertile Crescent (Trigo et al., 2010; Kelley et al., 2015). This has raised concerns on water 

availability in the region, especially taking into account the drying and warming projected 

scenarios for the Mediterranean area (e.g. Giorgi and Lionello, 2008), with the resulting 

increases in evapotranspiration demand and drought severity (Vicente-Serrano et al. 2010).

Sousa et al. (2011) studied the trends and extremes in drought conditions in the Mediterranean 

and a few subareas during the 20th century (Fig. 1.8). They found that the positive phase of the 

NAO during winter is the main large-scale circulation pattern driving severe moisture scarceness 

in southwestern Europe, while the SCA pattern becomes more relevant for central Mediterranean 

areas (in agreement with the precipitation assessment provided in Fig. 1.6). The link between 

water balance and sustained anomalies in European, which are strongly connected to 

perturbations in the mean zonal flow, suggests that atmospheric blocking may play a role in the 

hydrological balance. This issue will be further discussed in Chapter 5.

1.2. Atmospheric blocking: climatology and associated 

impacts 
 

1.2.1 Blocking definition 

There is no universally accepted definition for atmospheric blocking, although it can be 

fundamentally described as a suppression of the normal westerly flow in mid-to-high latitudes 

due to the presence of a relatively stationary high-pressure system. In this sense, several features 

are generally accepted as specific characteristics of a standard blocking system, as summarized 

by Barriopedro et al. (2010a), namely:  

1) a large-scale high pressure system with a quasi-stationary anticyclonic circulation located 

on the usual track of the prevailing westerlies; 

2) spatio-temporal signatures typical of the large-scale, with lifetimes spanning from a few 

days to several weeks; 

The traditional definition of blocks consists in a split-flow regime, with an associated low-

pressure system located southwards of the blocking structure (Rex 1950b). However, such a 

dipole is not observed during the so-called Omega block, where the flow reversal is tightly 

connected to a high-latitudinal extension of the sub-tropical ridge belt, and negative anomalies in 

the geopotential height field are located southwest and southeast of the blocking center 

(Barriopedro et al., 2006). Two examples of these typical blocking patterns are depicted in Fig. 

1.9.

and (b) Rex block (23 Dec1948). From Barriopedro et al. (2006). 

 



1. Introduction 
 

15 
 

The exact definition of blocking has been a matter of wide discussion in the scientific 

community, and several indices and methodologies for detection have been developed. As 

expected, the use of different definitions may result in discrepancies in the blocking 

climatologies, namely in their frequency and location (Barriopedro et al., 2010a). Most of the 

approaches have been based on the 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500) or, on dynamical fields 

(vertically integrated Potential Vorticity, PV, or Potential Temperature on the dynamical 

tropopause, PT). Generally speaking, these algorithms impose certain criteria in terms of 

minimum spatial extension and temporal duration (some criteria are objective and other 

subjective). Still, there are profoundly different rationales in these methodologies, particularly in 

what concerns the use of absolute vs. anomaly (departure) fields. As such, blocking 

methodologies can be classified into two groups:  

1) The flow reversal or wave-breaking approach, which identifies blocks as an easterly 

geostrophic flow around a reference Jetstream latitude, using absolute Z500 or PT fields 

(e.g., Tibaldi and Molteni, 1990; Trigo et al., 2004;  Barriopedro et al., 2006); 

2) Persistent departures from the climatological mean of the Z500 or PV fields (e.g. Dole 

and Gordon, 1983; Knox and Hay, 1985; Schwierz et al., 2004). 
 

These methodologies, originally proposed by Tibaldi and Molteni (1990) and Dole and Gordon 

(1983) and, hereafter TM and DG, respectively, have been modified with further features and 

criteria in subsequent works (e.g. Barriopedro et al. 2006, 2010a; Masato et al., 2011).  

All methods present specific caveats and shortcomings. Regarding the DG index, some of the 

main criticisms are based on the difficulty of defining proper thresholds for blocking detections, 

and the fact that a variety of synoptic situations which cannot be defined as blocking may be 

detected as so, such as northward shifts of the jet or amplifications of subtropical or subpolar 

anticyclones. Methodologies based on departure fields, such as DG have also the disadvantage of 

requiring longer time-series, in order to create robust climatological reference fields (Barriopedro 

et al., 2010a). 

On the other hand, the 1-D nature of the TM methodology is a limiting factor, not allowing the 

2-D description of the blocking structure. Another limitation of this method has been ascribed to 

the eventual identification of blockings due to the occurrence of cut-off lows. Also, early stages 

of block development and some Omega blocks can be missed using this approach, due to the too 

demanding extension and flow reversal criteria. Several modifications to the original algorithm 

have been introduced in order to minimize such problems, including a 2-D extension of the TM 

method (e.g., Barriopedro et al. 2006; Woollings et al. 2008; Davini et al. 2012a). Using this 2-D 

diagnosis of blocking, Davini et al. (2012a) explored the distinction between high-latitude and 

low-latitude blocking, noting that the latter structures are unable to divert or completely block 

the zonal flow. This example highlights the need to distinguish high- and low-latitudinal high 

pressure systems and to explore their dynamical characteristics, as detailed in the following sub-

sections. 

Throughout this thesis, the climatology of high-latitude blocking and the impacts on the 

European continent will be addressed relying on the catalogue developed by Barriopedro et al.

(2006), which results from a 2-D adapted version of the Tibaldi and Molteni (1990) index. A 

schematic of this automated detection algorithm is presented in Fig. 1.10, using daily Z500 data 

on a 2.5º x 2.5º grid as input.

1. Introduction 
 

17 
 

According to the scheme from Fig. 1.10, two Z500 gradients (GHGN and GHGS) have been 

simultaneously computed for each longitude on the NH and for each day of study, where Z(?,?) 

is the Z500 at a given longitude ? and latitude ?. GHGS is proportional to the zonal geostrophic 

wind component and provides a measure of the zonal flow intensity for each longitude, while 

GHGN is imposed in order to exclude non blocked flows. A given longitude is considered 

blocked when both GHGN&lt;-10gpm/º and GHGS&gt;0gpm/º for at least one of the five ? values, 

evaluated around a reference latitude ?0, and simultaneously the Z(?,?0) anomaly is positive. A 

large-scale instantaneous blocking pattern is detected when there are at least five blocked 

longitudes. The method includes a tracking algorithm to follow the daily evolution of these 

blocking patterns by demanding a minimum overlapping between them, and a blocking event is 

said to occur when the blocking pattern persists for at least five days. 

This detection scheme also incorporates a procedure to detect the 2-D center of each blocking 

pattern (defined as the gridpoint with the maximum Z500 within the anticyclonic flow), and the 

blocking intensity. The final catalogue includes individual blocking events, tracked on a daily 

basis, with daily information about their central location, longitudinal extension and intensity. In 

this thesis, this daily catalogue is used to identify blocking occurrence in different longitudinal 

sectors, according to their central location, as it will be described in detail further ahead in 

Section 2.1 

Furthermore, taking advantage of the Z500 gradients (GHGN and GHGS), a catalogue of 

strong zonal westerly flows is also computed, by simply identifying days with zonal flow as 

those characterized by GHGS&lt;22.5gpm/º, following the approach developed in Trigo et al. 

(2004). This distinction between zonal and blocked days will be exploited in the following 

Chapters. 

 

1.2.2 Euro-Atlantic blocking climatology 

Some fundamental characteristics of blocking climatology in the NH, and in the particular frame 

of the Euro-Atlantic sector, are discussed in this section. For this purpose, the blocking catalogue 

described in Section 1.2.1 has been used, and several diagnostics such as frequency of 

occurrence, mean duration, mean extension, and blocking life-cycles are herein presented. The 

comprehension of these blocking climatological features is an important first step to understand 

their associated impacts on different meteorological fields at local and regional scales, as it will 

be discussed throughout the remaining chapters of this thesis. 

There are two preferential areas of blocking occurrence in the NH, which overlap with the 

climatological regions of wave amplification and the exit zones of the principal storm-tracks 

(i.e., the eastern sides of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, e.g., Barriopedro et al. 2010a). This is 

clear in Fig. 1.11, which shows the annual and seasonal frequencies of the blocking centers. The 

largest frequencies are located in the longitudes surrounding the Greenwich Meridian (between 

the British Isles and Scandinavia), and near the international date line in the Pacific area. Even 

though they occur throughout the whole year, blocking is more frequent during winter and spring 

(e.g. Tibaldi et al., 1994, Barriopedro et al., 2006; Masato et al., 2011). In summer, there is a 



1. Introduction

smoother distribution, with a larger tendency for blocking to occur in continental areas and at 

higher latitudes. In the Euro-Atlantic region, this northeastward migration of blocking locations 

leads to a third smaller maximum close to the Urals mountain range, a feature already known 

(Tibaldi and Molteni, 1990; D’Andrea et al., 1998). In autumn, Pacific blocking occurrence 

decreases, while it persists in the Euro-Atlantic region, although less frequently when compared 

to winter and spring. Overall, these preferred locations at the seasonal scale are in agreement 

with those found in other works that used either subjective identification of blocks or detection 

schemes based on the TM approach (Treidl et al. 1981; Wiedenmann et al. 2002).

The duration distribution of NH blocking episodes presents the well-known one side tailed 

distribution (Fig. 1.12). This is observed through the whole year, although long-lasting blocks 

(more than 20 days) are more frequent in winter and spring. A similar seasonal behavior is 

observed for the spatial extension of the blocking patterns (not shown), with blocking covering 

larger areas during the coldest seasons of the year.

Red (blue) areas represent locations where the difference between the percentage of days with 

blocking centers in the early and mature stages is positive (negative). The two first (last) days of 

detection within the life cycle of each blocking event were considered for early (mature) stages. 

 



1. Introduction 
 

21 
 

Understanding blocking genesis and decay processes throughout the whole blocking life-cycle 

is not a simple task. The existent literature on this topic will be discussed in Section 1.2.3. As a 

first approach on this subject, the preferred locations for blocking genesis and decay are shown 

herein in Fig. 1.13. To do so, the differences in the frequencies of blocking center locations 

during their onset (two first days of detection) and decay (last two days of detection) in each 

geographical location ware computed. Taking into account the averaged blocking persistence (~8 

days), Fig. 1.13 corroborates the quasi-stationary character of blocking, with a slight tendency 

for Euro-Atlantic blocks to slowly migrate eastwards during their lifecycle, and a more unclear 

displacement pattern for Pacific blocks. 

 

1.2.3 Blocking life cycle: onset, maintenance and decay 

The life-cycle of blocks is influenced by both large-scale waves and small-scale perturbations 

(Nakamura et al., 1997; Tsou and Smith, 1990). The blocking life-cycle has been a widely 

discussed topic in the literature, both from a dynamical point of view, and also to evaluate the 

ability of models to represent blocking phenomenology (e.g., D’Andrea et al., 1998; Scaife et al., 

2010). A good model performance in simulating blocking becomes relevant in operational 

forecasts and climatological contexts, with the latter framing both to model the mid-latitude 

climate, as well to perform reliable climate projections (Barriopedro et al., 2010b; Davini and 

D’Andrea, 2016).  

 

Blocking precursors and onset 

The onset of blocks is closely related to the amplification of planetary waves and their 

underlying mechanisms, such as: a) planetary wave-wave interaction (Égger, 1978; Kung et al., 

1990; DaCamara et al., 1991), including resonant amplification between free and topographic 

Rossby waves (Tung and Lindzen 1979), b) non-linear interactions between synoptic and 

planetary-scale waves (Shutts 1983; Tsou and Smith, 1990; Lupo and Smith, 1995). More 

specifically, transient eddy activity is considered to play a crucial role in the genesis and 

maintenance of block, primarily through feedbacks between synoptic eddies and the large-scale 

flow (e.g., Yamazaki and Itoh, 2009). 

The precursor role of the synoptic-scale has been widely studied. Altenhoff et al. (2008) 

confirmed the existence of precursor signals several days (up to 10) prior to blocking onset, 

namely: 1) a coherent wave-train emanating approximately 110º upstream of Atlantic blocking; 

2) a long-lived northerly wind signal preceding Pacific blocking. Masato et al. (2011) 

distinguished the influence of cyclonic and anticyclonic wave-breaking towards blocking onset, 

as well as the separation between warm/cold air extrusions (as depicted in Fig. 1.14). The authors 

found that anticyclonic breaking dominates over Europe, as previously discussed by Martius et 

al. (2007) or Gabriel and Peters (2008), while cyclonic breaking tend to occur mainly over 

oceanic areas.

Fig. 1.14 Schematic for the Direction of Breaking (DB) and Relative Intensity (RI) phase space plot. 

On the x-axis is DB, while on the y-axis is RI. Positive values of DB are for anticyclonic wave 

breaking and positive values of RI indicate warm air extrusion dominance. As sketched, a unique 

wave-breaking type is identified for each quadrant of this plot. Adapted from Masato et al. (2011). 

 

Michel et al. (2012) have shown that during the onset of Scandinavian blocks, Atlantic 

cyclones display trajectories towards northern Scandinavia, associated with anticyclonic wave-

breaking in the upper troposphere. With such atmospheric configurations, low PV air masses are 

advected northeastwards contributing to this type of wave-breaking over Europe and preventing 

the occurrence of cyclonic wave-breaking further west. As a consequence, the occurrence of 

blocks in the eastern Atlantic is not favored under such atmospheric patterns. On the other hand, 

blocks originating in the Atlantic and Greenland area are preceded by a rapid poleward 

deflection of low PV values towards the southeast of Greenland, which acts as a barrier for the 

downstream motion of cyclones, favoring a cyclonic wave-breaking in the Atlantic region. 

 Croci-Maspolli et al (2007) and Woollings et al. (2008) have explored the dynamical links 

between blocking and the NAO. Woolings et al. (2010a) further discussed how features such as 

the NAO and EA patterns (which are associated to the location of the eddy-driven jet over the 

Atlantic) are closely linked to blocking occurrence. These studies have shown that blocking 

reinforces the pre-existing negative NAO phases, and that long-lasting blocks may even instigate 

phase changes in the NAO (from positive to negative). Also, blocking genesis locations vary 

according to the NAO phase (Fig. 1.15). Such findings highlight that small-scales may force 

larger-scales.

More recently, a particular emphasis has also been devoted to the coupling between 

stratospheric dynamics and blocking occurrence, particularly during the incidence of major 

Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs). These SSW events are characterized by a significant 

weakening of the polar cyclonic vortex and an abrupt warming of the polar stratosphere during 

the extended winter. SSWs result in stratospheric anomalies that can propagate downwards 

towards the troposphere in the form of negative values of the Northern Annular Mode (NAM, 

e.g., Baldwin and Dunkerton 2001). The tropospheric NAM is associated to significant 

anomalies in the Jetstream and hence in blocking occurrence (e.g., Davini et al. 2014). 



1. Introduction 
 

24 
 

Interestingly, the SSW-blocking link is not purely one-directional, and the role of blocks on 

forcing SSWs has also been discussed by several authors (e.g. Martius et al., 2009; Nishii et al., 

2011; Barriopedro and Calvo 2014).  In addition to internal atmospheric dynamics, external 

forcings may also modulate blocking onset, such as: snow cover (García-Herrera and 

Barriopedro, 2006), solar activity (Barriopedro et al., 2008) or the AMO (Martinez, 2014). 
 

Blocking maintenance 

The comprehension of processes responsible for blocking maintenance is a complex subject, 

which led several authors to make use of numerical models.  

Works such as Green (1977) and Shutts (1983) detail the Eddy Straining Mechanism (ESM), 

where transient eddies act to maintain the blocking through the input of anticyclonic vorticity to 

the western flank of the block, thus indicating a contribution of the high frequency for the 

development and sustainment of blocks (see Fig. 1.16a). Synoptic eddies are strained by the 

block in the north?south direction, and provide negative (positive) vorticity to the blocking high 
(low), which maintains the blocking dipole against dissipation. The meridional stretching of 

Rossby waves in the blocked area can in turn result in additional synoptic disturbances (Tanaka 

1998). The positive feedback can be lost by a subtle change in the synoptic forcing (Maeda et al. 

2000, Arai and Mukougawa 2002). The ESM is not so clear for Omega-type blocks, as a 

split/meridional dipole is not present. In these blocks, a different mechanism, the Selective 

Absortion Mechanism (Yamazaki and Itoh 2009, see Fig. 1.16b) has been proposed. 

Accordingly, the blocking high selectively absorbs the anticyclonic vorticity of the transient 

anticyclones, reinforcing its low potential vorticity, while synoptic cyclones will either travel 

south and downstream of an Omega-type block, or be attracted to the blocking low in a dipole-

type block, in both cases maintaining the whole blocking structure. 

The important role played by transient eddies in blocking maintenance is well recognized (e.g. 

Green, 1977; Dole, 1986), although some authors consider that these feedbacks are secondary 

contributors, and that low-frequency dynamics should still be considered as the primary driver of 

blocking intensification and maintenance (e.g., Nakamura et al. 1997).

Blocking decay 

As discussed above, the planetary scale is very influential in the blocking onset. This is also 

valid regarding the decay phase of blocking systems. Nakamura et al. (1997) attributed blocking 

decay to the low-frequency dynamics, more precisely, to the downstream emanation of a quasi-

stationary Rossby wave train, as also pointed out by Dole (1986, 1989) and Black (1997). Haines 

and Holland (1998) suggested that blocking regimes may persist for, as long as, the large-scale 

flow remains balanced and does not become unstable or transition to a new state.  

Michel et al. (2012) have shown that during the decay process of Scandinavian blocks, 

cyclonic wave-breaking is more frequent than the anticyclonic type. Blocks located in the 

referred area usually decay throughout a transition to a Greenland anticyclone, driven by a 

sustained advection of low PV under curved cyclone trajectories over the mid-Atlantic. This 

agrees with the previous work of Nakamura et al. (1997), whom already noted an eastward shift 

of the low-PV center concurrent with the slow retrograding high pressure center when blocking 

decay begins. Croci-Maspoli et al. (2007) noted that in its decaying phase, blocking is 

characterized by a strong decrease of the spatial scale irrespective of the block type and 

geographical location. This implies some difficulties for tracking algorithms to correctly 

characterize the final stages of the blocking life-cycle. 

 

1.2.4 Sub-tropical ridges 

A sub-tropical ridge is often regarded as an extension of the sub-tropical high pressure belt 

northwards into mid-latitude areas. This atmospheric structure is usually characterized by a 

meridional stretch of anomalously high values in the Z500 field. The synoptic pattern acts as a 

“barrier” for the local westerly flow, thus disturbing the zonal circulation at sub-tropical 

latitudes, similar to the blocking action on the extratropical Jetstream. However, and unlike high-

latitude blocks, the Jetstream does not split into two branches. Instead, it is reinforced and 

pushed northwards of the ridge structure, although often embedded in a much larger-scale 

meandering circulation with alternating ridges and troughs (Fig. 1.17). Furthermore, the full 

connection between the ridge structure and the sub-tropical high pressure area prevents a reversal 

of the zonal flow on the eastern and western flanks of the system, contrarily to canonical 

blocking systems.  

From a more dynamical point of view, a sub-tropical ridge is not necessarily accompanied by a 

wave-breaking event as blocks do (see Section 1.2.3) and may (or may not) evolve into a 

blocking structure at a later stage. In the case of blocking, the early stages may be characterized 

by a sub-tropical or an extra-tropical ridge structure, which eventually breaks and becomes 

partially or fully isolated from the sub-tropical belt at higher latitudes (Woollings et al., 2011). 

As ridges and blocks may correspond to different stages of the same wave-breaking event, the 

distinction between a more traditional Rex-type block and an Omega-type block should be once 

again considered. Frequently, an Omega block structure represents the intermediate stage 

between a sub-tropical ridge, and a final isolated Rex block. In fact, in pioneering studies on this 

topic, blocking systems were often defined as “blocking ridges”, although authors were referring

specifically to blocks with wave-breaking (e.g. White and Clark, 1975). Recent works, such as 

Santos et al. (2009) or Woollings et al. (2011) have addressed in more detail sub-tropical ridges 

(defined as strong persistent ridge events – SPREs) in the eastern Atlantic area. The latter work 

highlights the differences between ridges occurring with and without posterior Rossby wave-

breaking, as presented in Fig. 1.18. Ridges with Rossby wave-breaking display similar signatures 

to the so-called low-latitude blocking events (Davini et al. 2012a), including a strengthened and 

northward shifted Jetstream.

Low-latitude blocks are very different from high-latitude blocks, which instead, are associated 

to a weakening and reversal of the extra-tropical Jetstream. In this sense, attending to the 

characteristic perturbations that these weather systems impinge on the Jetstream, it can be 

concluded that the low-latitude and high-latitude blocks display larger differences than sub-

tropical ridges with and without Rossby wave-breaking. In order to address the distinct impacts 

of these weather systems, it is mandatory to separate high-latitude blocks and subtropical ridges, 

the latter group including both, those with Rossby wave-breaking (i.e., low-latitude blocks) and 

those without it. These low-latitude structures will be named as sub-tropical ridges (or simply 

ridges) throughout the remaining of the thesis. In order to perform this disentanglement, an 

automated ridge detection algorithm was developed, as published in Sousa et al. (2017b). The 

complete description of the methodology will be addressed further ahead, in Section 2.1.

1.2.5 Blocking and ridges impacts 

Blocking occurrence is related to anomalous weather conditions over wide areas of the mid and 

high latitudes. Trigo et al. (2004) firstly explored in a long-term context the European 

precipitation and temperature responses to winter blocking occurrence over the whole Euro-

Atlantic sector (Fig. 1.19). As shown in that study, blocking is associated with prolonged 

cloudless and dry periods in the areas under the blocking high. Euro-Atlantic winter blocks also 

tend to deflect storm-tracks to northern or southern areas of the continent, often increasing 

precipitation in the Mediterranean (Trigo et al., 2004). On the other hand, the meridional 

circulation associated with blocks favors the advection of cold air from higher latitudes, thus

promoting cold winter spells over the European continent (Buehler et al., 2011; Sillmann et al., 

2011). However, the regional responses and the involved processes can be highly dependent on 

the specific location of the blocking system (e.g., García-Herrera et al. 2007), and on the specific 

season in which they occur.

composites of: a) blocking episodes, b) non-blocking episodes, and c) their difference (represented 

only if significant at the 5% level). Solid (dashed) contours in a) and b) show positive (negative) 

values of the 10 m vorticity anomaly field, with intervals in 0.2·10–6 s–1. Lower panels: anomalies of 

the daily maximum temperature field (ºC) for winter composites of: d) blocking episodes, e) non-

blocking episodes, and f) their difference (represented only if significant at the 1% level). The arrows

Therefore, a good characterization of the synoptic environment associated to blocking patterns 

is crucial in the assessment of their impacts. In addition, a regional classification of blocking is 

mandatory, since blocking occurrence within different sectors of the Euro-Atlantic-Russian area 

can lead to very distinct atmospheric configurations. Taking these facts into account, it was 

considered a priority in this thesis to: 1) update results from previous works using higher 

resolution datasets to better characterize the regional/local responses; 2) characterize the 

associated impacts as a function of the specific blocking location (thus defining distinct 

longitudinal sectors of blocking occurrence); 3) extend previous analyses to other seasons and to 

extreme episodes; 4) better characterize the associated synoptic environment and underlying  

processes; 5) distinguish the blocking impacts from those associated to ridges, whose effects 

have not been described so far over the European continent.

1.3 Goals and structure of the thesis 

In this thesis, a thorough description of blocking occurrence and the associated impacts on the 

European climate is provided, by distinguishing regional blocking patterns in three sectors within 

the Euro-Atlantic region: a western (Atlantic), a central (European) and an eastern (Russian) 

sector. Furthermore, a clear separation between opposite regimes of the Jetstream is explored, by 

distinguishing periods of: 1) strong zonal flow, and 2) high-latitude blocking. Sub-tropical ridges 

are herein considered among the synoptic systems that are associated with strong Jetstream 

episodes. The consideration of sub-tropical ridges is further motivated by the need to distinguish 

the impacts of blocking from those associated to high-pressure systems occurring at sub-tropical 

latitudes. This separation is necessary in order to clarify a relatively widespread misusage of 

blocking patterns when attributing extreme temperatures events (both hot and cold), a 

misconception that still abounds in the literature. 

Thus, the main objectives of this thesis are:  

1) Characterize the blocking impacts on the European climate (temperature and precipitation), 

according to their location; 

2) Develop a novel detection scheme for sub-tropical ridges; 

3) Distinguish the impacts of high-latitude blocking from the ones associated to other large-

scale patterns (zonal flows and ridges), and the underlying processes; 

4) Perform a finer description of the aforementioned impacts at the regional scale, with 

special emphasis on the Iberian Peninsula; 

5) Explore impacts on extreme temperature and precipitation events, as well as in derived 

fields with socio-economic relevance (e.g. droughts, wildfires). 

 

The thesis is structured around three core chapters that correspond to the three published 

papers comprising the main outcome of the work performed during the PhD (Sousa et al., 2016, 

Sousa et al., 2017a and Sousa et al., 2017b). Given that the three papers are integrally presented 

as they were published, there are some unavoidable repetitions in the chapter sections addressing 

datasets, methodology and climatologies. It must also be noted that the order of the chapters does 

not follow the chronological order of the publications (taking into consideration the need to 

present the disentanglement between blocking and ridges at an early stage of the thesis). 

However, some additional unpublished material has been included in the required Chapters to 

provide coherence to the thesis. This extra material corresponds to additional sections in 

Chapters 3 and 4 and to the outlook of Chapter 5. 

 

 

 

 



1. Introduction 
 

30 
 

 

 The thesis is structured as follows: 

- Chapter 1 introduced overviews on: 1) the large-scale variability and its influence on the 

European climate; 2) blocking definitions, climatology and the dynamics behind its life-cycle, as 

well as the distinction between blocking and ridges.  

- Chapter 2 introduces the methodology used to detect sub-tropical ridges in order to 

distinguish them from high-latitude blocks (Sousa et al., 2017b). A comprehensive 

characterization of the impacts on European temperature and extreme events associated to both 

patterns is then performed, outlining the relative roles of the involved mechanisms. 

- Chapter 3 describes the specific impacts of regional blocks on European precipitation, 

precipitation extremes, and the associated synoptic environment (Sousa et al., 2017a). The 

distinct impacts of blocking and strong zonal flow (herein including ridges) regimes on regional 

precipitation distributions are addressed is this chapter. Furthermore, the responses in solid 

precipitation (i.e., snow cover) to regional blocking occurrence are also presented. 

- Chapter 4 presents the detailed impacts of blocks in the Iberian Peninsula, relying on 

precipitation (Sousa et al., 2016) and temperature datasets at higher spatial resolutions than those 

used in previous chapters. Similar to the larger-scale analyses, changes in the regional 

precipitation distributions, extreme events and the driving mechanisms are explored. 

- Chapter 5 summarizes the Conclusions, and the main achievements of this thesis. It also 

highlights the topics of research that remain open after the work performed during the PhD. In 

particular, it provides preliminary insights on the impacts of blocks/ridges in other relevant 

variables at the European scale (such as drought variability and wildfire occurrence). A brief 

outlook at future changes in blocking/ridge occurrence is also presented in this section.  

In Annex, two additional studies which were published during the course of this PhD are 

presented (Sousa et al., 2015; Trigo et al., 2013b). Although these works are not directly 

connected with the main motivation of this PhD, their datasets and part of the addressed topics 

are discussed throughout this thesis.

Summary 
 

 

Context and objectives 

This chapter is devoted to the characterization of the seasonal impacts of blocks and ridges on 

European temperature at continental and regional scales by using the E-OBS dataset, as 

described in Sousa et al. (2017b). Section 2.1.2 provides a novel approach to disentangle high-

latitude blocks from sub-tropical ridges. Geopotential height (Z500) from the NCEP/NCAR 

dataset is used to develop a catalogue of sub-tropical ridges, which will be employed throughout 

the remaining of this thesis. As an important novelty, the temperature impacts of blocking and 

ridges are disentangled by considering three different sectors of occurrence (ATL, EUR and 

RUS) within the Euro-Atlantic region. Special attention is paid to explore extreme temperature 

events and the driving mechanisms of the temperature responses associated to each considered 

atmospheric pattern. 

 

Methods 

An algorithm based on exceedances of Z500 thresholds (against the daily climatology) in three 

longitudinal consecutive sectors (ATL, EUR and RUS) was developed to detect ridges, avoiding 

their overlap with blocking occurrence. These two catalogues are used to compute composites 

of minimum and maximum temperatures for each regime and sector. An analysis of the 

tendency equation was performed, detecting the main contributing term to the regional 

temperature anomalies induced by each weather regime. This was supported by a surface 

radiative budget decomposition. Finally, changes in regional extreme temperature occurrences 

were examined. 

 

 

Results 

There are substantial differences in the European 2 m temperature responses to blocking and 

ridge regimes, particularly during winter. While winter blocking (essentially in the ATL and 

EUR sectors) leads to generalized below average temperatures and cold spells, prompted by 

cold advection from northerly flows, mild winter days occur during ridge regimes, with 

increases up to 7ºC in parts of central Europe, through enhanced transport from Atlantic air 

masses and reduced long-wave cooling.  

During summer, both atmospheric patterns are associated with warmer temperatures in central 

and northern Europe. However, in southernmost countries, and in particular in the 

Mediterranean area, only ridges (mainly those occurring in the EUR sector) exert a large 

influence on the occurrence of hot summer days. During this season, and for both weather 

regimes, the anomalous radiative heating due to enhanced clear sky conditions plays a leading 

role in explaining the positive temperature anomalies over continental areas.

Paper published in Climate Dynamics (2017b) 

 

Blocking occurrence and its impacts on European temperature have been studied in the last 

decade. However, most previous studies on blocking impacts have focused on winter only, 

disregarding its fingerprint in summer and differences with other synoptic patterns that also trigger 

temperature extremes. In this work, we provide a clear distinction between high-latitude blocking 

and sub-tropical ridges occurring in three sectors of the Euro-Atlantic region, describing their 

climatology and consequent impacts on European temperature during both winter and summer.  

Winter blocks (ridges) are generally associated to colder (warmer) than average conditions over 

large regions of Europe, in some areas with anomalies larger than 5ºC, particularly for the patterns 

occurring in the Atlantic and Central European sectors. During summer, there is a more regional 

response characterized by above average temperature for both blocking and ridge patterns, 

especially those occurring in continental areas, although negative temperature anomalies persist in 

southernmost areas during blocking.  

An objective analysis of the different forcing mechanisms associated to each considered weather 

regime has been performed, quantifying the importance of the following processes in causing the 

temperature anomalies: horizontal advection, vertical advection and diabatic heating. While during 

winter advection processes tend to be more relevant to explain temperature responses, in summer 

radiative heating under enhanced insolation plays a crucial role for both blocking and ridges.  

Finally, the changes in the distributions of seasonal temperature and in the frequencies of 

extreme temperature indices were also examined for specific areas of Europe. Winter blocking and 

ridge patterns are key drivers in the occurrence of regional cold and warm extreme temperature, 

respectively. In summer, they are associated with substantial changes in the frequency of extremely 

warm days, but with different signatures in southern Europe. We conclude that there has been 

some misusage of the traditional blocking definition in the attribution of extreme events. 

2.1.1 Introduction 

Anomalous temperature episodes are one of the most widely addressed topics in climatological 

studies, and numerous works have been published in the last decades concerning this subject in 

Europe, at both continental and regional scales. They cover a wide range of sub-topics, ranging 

from winter cold spells to summer heatwaves (e.g. Santos et al., 2006; Cattiaux et al., 2010; 

Andrade et al., 2012; Simolo et al., 2012; Monteiro et al., 2013; Lowe et al., 2015), heatwave-

related mortality (García-Herrera et al., 2005b; Trigo et al., 2009; Muthers et al., 2010; Green et 

al., 2016), forest fires (Pereira et al., 2005; Marcos et al., 2015; Sousa et al., 2015), drought 

occurrence and agricultural management (Bastos et al., 2014; Gouveia et al., 2016), amongst other 

topics. The physical and dynamical mechanisms that trigger such extreme episodes are interpreted

with very distinct methodologies. In this sense, an increasing number of studies are focusing on 

the contribution from large-scale dynamics and mid-latitude synoptic circulation patterns to the 

occurrence of these anomalously cold/warm temperature episodes (e.g. Andrade et al., 2012; 

Cattiaux et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013; Pfahl, 2014). 

In the context of climatic change, trends in global mean temperature have been accompanied by 

an increase of warm extreme temperature events (Fischer and Knutti 2015), which has not been 

offset by the hiatus or slowdown in global mean temperature rise of the last 15 years (Seneviratne 

et al. 2014). These recent trends do not only indicate a thermodynamic forcing, but also changes 

in the frequency of occurrence of mid-latitude circulation patterns (Horton et al., 2015), thus 

stressing the need of characterizing their associated impacts. 

Regarding European winter cold spells, there is a wide consensus on the critical role played by 

atmospheric blocking episodes over large sectors of the European continent. In works such as 

Trigo et al. (2004), Cattiaux et al. (2010), Sillmann et al. (2011), de Vries et al. (2012) or Pfahl 

(2014), the role of blocking structures in transporting cold air from higher latitudes or from cold 

landmasses becomes quite clear. Other studies have undertaken a deeper analysis of some specific 

European winter cold spells, as well as of their associated synoptic context, and have also 

addressed feedback processes that may amplify the resulting anomalies, such as Eurasian autumn 

snow-cover anomalies (García-Herrera and Barriopedro, 2006; Cohen and Jones, 2011). The 

interplay between Rossby wave-breaking and jet stream regimes (Woolings et al., 2011), or the 

occurrence of Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (Barriopedro and Calvo, 2014; Liu et al., 2014), 

are potential mediators of blocking activity, and hence, important precursors of cold events. 

Episodes like the extensive cold spell which occurred on the later stages of the previously mild 

winter of 2012 (WMO, 2012) are pertinent examples of the relevance of complex feedback 

processes in triggering significant European cold blasts.  

Blocking has also been associated with extremely warm episodes in summer (Buehler et al., 

2011; Andrade et al., 2012; Pfahl, 2014). However, using the well-known 2003 heatwave in 

Europe as an example, García-Herrera et al. (2010) stressed that there is some overstatement when 

attributing these episodes to standard definitions of atmospheric blocking – high-latitude quasi-

stationary anticyclones associated with a reversal of the prevailing westerly flow (e.g., Rex, 

1950a,b; Treidl et al., 1981; Barriopedro et al., 2006, 2010a). These weather systems are indeed in 

clear association with summer heat episodes over European mid/high-latitudes (e.g. Barriopedro 

et al., 2011; Pfahl, 2014). However, this is not the case for southern European sectors, where high-

latitude blocks are frequently associated with colder than average temperatures throughout the 

year. Therefore, there is a clear need to distinguish high-latitude blocking structures from low-

latitude systems, including the extensions of sub-tropical high pressure systems, commonly 

denominated as sub-tropical ridges. Unlike canonical blocking systems, sub-tropical ridges do not 

have the necessary condition of a wave-breaking occurrence (Woollings et al., 2011; Masato et al., 

2011; Santos et al., 2013). They manifest as relatively narrow bands of positive anomalies of 

geopotential height extending from sub-tropical latitudes towards southern Europe and often 

reaching higher latitudes. Although sub-tropical ridges can be precursors of wave-breaking and

subsequent blocking (Altenhoff et al., 2008; Masato et al., 2011; Davini et al., 2012a), their impacts 

on European surface temperatures are rather different from those of high-latitude blocks. 

García-Herrera et al. (2005b) briefly introduced the importance of sub-tropical ridging patterns 

on extreme summer temperatures over Iberia. Other studies have analyzed ridge patterns over 

Europe and their influence on rainfall regimes and droughts in southwestern Europe (Santos et al., 

2009; Santos et al., 2013). However, there are no systematic studies aiming to characterize and 

distinguish the impacts on European temperature due to blocking and ridge patterns, at both 

regional and seasonal scales. In this paper, we characterize the local and regional European 

temperature responses associated with blocking and ridging patterns occurring over different 

locations of the Euro-Atlantic sector and on different seasons. We also clarify some of the referred 

ambiguity on the impacts’ attribution to these weather systems. More specifically, the main 

objectives are to: 1) distinguish blocking and ridge structures with objective detection schemes; 2) 

characterize the seasonal  impacts of these patterns, considering their specific location, on 

European surface temperature (including extremes); 3) objectively quantify the contribution and 

seasonality of the main physical mechanisms involved in the regional temperature anomalies 

associated to blocking and ridging regimes. 

 

2.1.2 Data and Methods 

Meteorological Data 

Maximum and minimum near-surface temperatures (at 2 m above the ground, T2m hereafter) 

are considered for the period spanning between 1950 and 2012 from the E-OBS dataset (Haylock 

et al., 2008). This high-resolution gridded dataset is provided by the European Climate Assessment 

and Dataset (ECA&amp;amp;D) project, and is available on a daily basis and on a horizontal resolution of 

0.25º latitude × 0.25º longitude. This regular grid is obtained by interpolating observations from 

local meteorological stations. Despite the overall good quality of this dataset, it must be 

acknowledged that it has some caveats in areas where the spatial distribution of stations is sparser 

(e.g., Kyselý and Plavcová 2010). Moreover, the E-OBS temperature dataset suffers from other 

limitations such as inhomogeneities in input records, statistical interpolation errors and “heat 

island” effects (Hofstra et al. 2009; van der Schrier et al. 2013). 

The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis daily dataset is also used (Kalnay et al., 1996), at a 2.5º latitude × 

2.5º longitude horizontal resolution for the same period. The following mean daily fields are 

selected: 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500); 850 hPa temperature, omega-vertical velocity and 

horizontal wind components; upward, downward and net long-wave and short-wave surface 

fluxes; and total cloud cover. The Z500 field was used to compute the blocking (Barriopedro et 

al., 2006) and ridge days catalogues separately, as described below. These two different dynamical 

indicators will be used to distinguish the impacts of anomalous geopotential fields at different 

European sectors (see next section).

Blocking and Ridge Catalogues 

The catalogue of days adopted in this work for high-latitude blocking (hereafter only referred as 

blocking) was developed by Barriopedro et al. (2006). The algorithm is an adapted version of the 

Tibaldi and Molteni (1990) index based on the reversal of the meridional Z500 gradient around 

the typical latitudes of the extra-tropical jet stream. It further imposes spatial (minimum 

longitudinal extension of 12.5º) and temporal (minimum duration of 5 days) criteria to account for 

the characteristic spatio-temporal scales of blocking. The algorithm also enables the 

characterization of useful daily parameters, such as the location of the blocking center, the intensity 

or the spatial extension. Following previous studies (Sousa et al., 2016, 2017), where the same 

catalogue was used to assess the impacts of blocking patterns on precipitation regimes over 

Europe, three non-overlapping blocking sectors covering the Europe and the eastern Atlantic are 

defined. More specifically, daily blocking occurrences are assigned to one of the following spatial 

sectors according to the location of their blocking centers (Fig. 2.1): ATL (30ºW–0º), EUR (0º–

30ºE) and RUS (30ºE–60ºE). 

 

Fig. 2.1 Geographical representation of the considered sectors for blocking location (thick black 

frames): Atlantic (ATL) – from 30ºW to 0º; European (EUR) – from 0º to 30ºE; Russian (RUS) – from 

30ºE to 60ºE. Each of these sectors was also sub-divided into two smaller 15º longitude-wide sub-

sectors (west and east, dashed black lines). Magenta boxes identify areas for regional-scale 

assessments (cf. Section 2.1.3). 

 

To compute the catalogue of sub-tropical ridge days (hereafter only referred to as ridges), we 

follow a similar methodology as in Santos et al. (2009), which is based on daily anomalies of the 

Z500 field. In order to compare it with the blocking catalogue, we also classified ridge occurrence 

into the same three sectors (ATL, EUR and RUS). Furthermore, each sector is split into two halves: 

south (30ºN–50ºN) and north (50ºN–70ºN). These latitudinal bands are used for winter and, to 

accommodate the annual cycle, they are shifted 5º northward for summer. This partition enables 

classifying ridges as strong Z500 positive departures in sub-tropical and mid-latitudes that do not

37 
 

extend significantly northwards, thus avoiding overlapping days between blocking and ridge 

patterns. For each grid point, we computed Z500 departures for each specific day, and a 30-day 

running threshold based on the 80th percentile of the daily Z500 series. We then obtained, on a 

daily basis and for each longitudinal sector, the percentage of area above that threshold in its 

northern and southern halves. To classify a ridge day in one of the three considered longitudinal 

sectors the following criteria are employed: 1) at least 75% of the area in the southern half is above 

the threshold; 2) less than 50% of the area in the northern half is above the same threshold. These 

percentages and thresholds were tested and calibrated in order to avoid overlaps between blocking 

and ridge dates, and furthermore to obtain climatological ridge frequencies comparable to previous 

studies (e.g. Santos et al. 2009).  

We also evaluate for each blocking and ridge day the contribution to grid point temperature 

anomalies of three major physical forcings: horizontal advection, vertical advection and diabatic 

processes. This is carried out by separating and identifying the process associated with the largest 

daily temperature change at each grid point (considering only those cells where the absolute 

temperature anomalies exceed 1ºC under the given weather regime). Daily mean horizontal and 

vertical temperature advections are explicitly calculated as in Equations (1) and (2), respectively:

Wright and Fueglistaler (2013). It must be kept in mind that different factors such as sub-grid 

turbulent mixing, analysis increments and other numerical errors may contribute to the residual 

term. Further, this approach does not consider sub-daily fluctuations of the contributing terms, 

potential interactions among the underlying processes and feedbacks between the dynamics and 

thermodynamics. For example, in addition to horizontal warm advection, diabatic and adiabatic

heating experienced during the re-circulation of air masses around high pressure systems can 

contribute to the warm anomalies. Similarly, warm temperatures induced by a given weather 

system can in turn modulate the contributing terms by reinforcing the Z500 anomaly. Thus, the 

attribution of the temperature responses should be taken with caution, as some one-directional 

causal relationships cannot be fully inferred from a composite analysis.  

This bulk analysis is performed for the 1000-850 hPa layer. Then, we compute the daily

 for blocking and ridge days, and the leading process i with the largest contribution 

to the temperature tendency anomaly.  

In this work, the analyses are performed for winter and summer separately, using the 

meteorological seasons: December to February and June to August, respectively. The statistical 

significance of the anomalies presented in the Results section was assessed with a two-sample 

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (the 5% significance level was considered). 

 

2.1.3 Results 

2.1.3.1 Blocking and ridge seasonal distribution 

The classification of events according to their position enables a simple and objective way of 

grouping blocking and ridge days in each sector and season. It also allows the computation of 

composites for the aforementioned meteorological variables under each specific synoptic pattern. 

The winter and summer composites of Z500 anomalies for blocking and ridge days of each sector 

are shown in Fig. 2.2. Overall, blocking and ridges display a clear difference in the latitude of their 

maximum Z500 anomalies. The composites for blocking days show an omega-like structure, 

which is distinguishable from the non-wave-breaking pattern that is evident in the composites 

corresponding to days of ridge. Furthermore, the absolute anomalies are larger in winter, and for 

blocking regimes (Fig. 2.2a-c). During winter, around one third of the days comprises blocking 

occurrence in at least one sector of the Euro-Atlantic region, while summer frequencies are smaller, 

particularly over the ATL sector (Fig. 2.2g). The composites accurately capture the signatures 

associated with blocking over preferred sectors of occurrence in the Eurasian sector (Barriopedro 

et al. 2006). It is still worth noting that some events contribute to the composites of more than one 

sector during their lifecycle (Sousa et al., 2017a). Ridge frequencies are more equally distributed 

throughout the three sectors and seasons, with closer values to those of blocking during summer. 

The largest Z500 anomalies under ridging patterns are found for ATL and EUR ridges in winter 

(Fig. 2.2d-e). The positive anomalies of Z500 during blocking and ridge regimes are often 

accompanied by negative anomalies, but much less pronounced. The most relevant negative Z500 

anomalies occur southwards (northwards) of the blocking (ridges) centers, mainly for ATL 

structures in winter (Fig. 2.2a and 2.2d).

geopotential height for blocking centers and ridges in each sector, during winter (upper panels, a-c 

and d-f, respectively) and summer (lower panels, g-i and j-l, respectively). All values are in gpm and 

the thick line represents the 5500 isohypse (the thinner contours are separated by 50 gpm). The 

seasonal frequencies of occurrence for each regime are shown in percentage. 

In the following sub-sections, the specific surface temperature responses driven by each weather 

regime, as well as the corresponding synoptic environments, will be analyzed in more detail. 

 

2.1.3.2 Seasonal temperature responses 

Using the seasonal and regional catalogues of blocking and ridge days, we computed the 

corresponding composites for the maximum and minimum T2m anomalies. In Figs. 2.3 and 2.4 

we present the maximum (TX) and minimum (TN) temperature anomalies for winter and summer, 

displaying only statistically significant anomalies at the 5% significance level.

Overall, the geographical locations of the anomaly patterns undergo west-east shifts, in 

agreement with the positioning of the considered blocking or ridge structure (as presented in Fig. 

2.2). Additionally, there is a clear seasonality in the responses to blocking and ridge patterns, as 

they typically extend over larger areas in winter than in summer. Furthermore, the temperature 

responses to blocking are opposite to those of ridges in winter, but not in summer. These distinctive 

signatures highlight the need of distinguishing between blocking and ridges, including their spatial 

scales and location.

winter 2 meters above ground maximum (upper panels – TX; a-c and d-f, respectively) and minimum 

temperature (lower panels – TN; g-i and j-l, respectively) anomalies (in ºC). Only statistically 

significant anomalies at 5% significance level are depicted.

The responses in TN and TX are generally coherent for all sectors and regimes during winter 

(Fig. 2.3) and reveal highly contrasting patterns between blocking and ridges (Fig. 2.3a-c versus 

2.3d-f). While during blocking most of Europe experiences well below average temperatures, ridge 

days are characterized by extensive above average temperatures. Negative anomalies exceeding -

3ºC tend to occur southward and eastward of the blocking centers, with ATL blocking (Fig. 2.3a) 

revealing the largest widespread signal over the continent. During blocking episodes, strong 

positive temperature anomalies are found in land areas under the highest Z500 anomalies (Fig. 

2.2), i.e. northern half of Scandinavia for EUR blocks (Fig. 2.3b) and northern Russia and eastern 

Scandinavia for RUS blocks (Fig. 2.3c). Conversely, winter ridges in both ATL and EUR sectors 

(Fig. 2.3d-e) are responsible for anomalously warm conditions in almost all regions of Europe. 

These anomalies are particularly striking for EUR ridges (Fig. 2.3d), when Central Europe 

experiences positive TX anomalies reaching up to 7ºC. There are some areas on the ridge’s eastern 

and western flanks that experience slightly below average temperatures, mainly in Mediterranean 

regions. This is particularly noteworthy in Turkey during EUR ridges (Fig. 2.3k), though these 

negative anomalies are smaller in magnitude and spatial extension than their positive counterparts. 

 

As previously mentioned, summer temperature anomalies (Fig. 2.4) are more spatially confined 

than in winter and the opposite temperature response to blocking and ridge patterns is no longer 

observed (Fig. 2.3). In the case of blocking systems, positive anomalies are again centered under 

the maximum Z500 anomaly area, but now affecting larger areas. In particular, during EUR (RUS) 

blocking, extensive areas of Central Europe and Scandinavia (Eastern Europe and Russia) 

experience anomalously warm conditions, with TX anomalies &gt;5ºC, as seen in Fig. 2.4b (2.4c). 

Temperature anomalies for ATL blocking (Fig. 2.4a) are much less pronounced. As in winter, 

negative anomalies are found in the southern and eastern flanks of blocking systems, but they are 

small in magnitude, and mostly restricted to TX. Still, southern areas of Europe (e.g., Iberia, 

Balkans) display negative temperature anomalies associated to blocking in both winter and 

summer. 

Summer ridges are associated with above normal temperatures over a more confined area than 

in winter. In particular, they do not have significant effects in temperature over northernmost areas 

of Europe during this season. The lack of opposite signed responses to blocking and ridges during 

summer is evident in some regions, such as Central Europe or Russia, which experience above 

average surface temperatures under both regimes, albeit at different latitudes. On the contrary, in 

southernmost areas, particularly the Iberian Peninsula for ATL regimes (Fig 2.4d and 2.4a), 

positive temperature anomalies during ridge days tend to be replaced by negative anomalies during 

blocking days. Furthermore, summer temperature anomalies over southern Europe critically 

depend on the specific location of ridge structures.

Fig. 2.4 Same as in Fig. 2.3, but for summer. 

  

Although their locations are similar, TX anomalies (Fig. 2.4d-f) are larger in magnitude than 

those of TN (Fig. 2.4j-l). This different amplitude in the day-time and night-time temperature 

responses is much more pronounced than during winter, which is also observed for blocking 

systems (Fig. 2.4a-c vs 2.4g-i). This is particularly relevant for the occurrence of extremely hot 

days in summer. In this sense, it is worth noticing that a given synoptic pattern can affect very 

differently areas situated relatively close, as shown by García-Herrera et al. (2005b) when 

comparing the weather regimes associated with local heatwaves in Lisbon and Madrid. Therefore, 

a finer-scale analysis using smaller regional sectors is required to address local extreme events. In

43 
 

Figs. 2.12 and 2.13 of the Supplementary Material we show the winter and summer composites of 

TX and TN, considering narrower longitudinal sub-sectors for blocking and ridge location (15º 

longitude-wide). Overall, the results are similar to those of Fig. 2.3 and 2.4, although the 

temperature responses to summertime ridges are more spatially restricted, especially in western 

Europe. As an illustration for the Iberian Peninsula, the exact areas under intense summer hot 

conditions are very dependent on small west-east shifts in the position of the sub-tropical ridge 

(Fig. 2.14g-i). Thus, some regional impacts can be smoothed out in the analysis using larger 

sectors. However, on the whole, the analysis based on three 30º longitudinal sectors is sufficient 

to identify the most relevant temperature responses to blocking and ridges, as well as the associated 

mechanisms, which are described in the following section. 

 

2.1.3.3 Synoptic and forcing mechanisms 

In this section we apply the methodology described in Section 2 in order to assess the relative 

contribution of different processes to the local temperature anomalies associated with blocks and 

ridges, namely: 1) horizontal advection by the large-scale flow; 2) vertical advection - adiabatic 

heating/cooling; 3) diabatic processes. In most cases one dominant mechanism can be identified, 

though local temperature responses can also be due to a combination of the forcing terms, 

frequently involving a partial cancelation in the net temperature tendency. For the sake of 

succinctness, only the leading term is shown in Fig. 5, and the full analysis of the heating/cooling 

fraction due to each specific term is presented in the Supplementary Material (Figs. 2.14 and 2.15). 

 

During winter (Fig. 2.5a-c) and summer (Fig. 2.5g-i) blocking days, horizontal advection by 

anomalous southerly flows appears responsible for a large fraction of the warming observed in the 

northwestern flank of the blocking systems, with the exception of winter RUS blocks. The negative 

temperature anomalies found in the southeastern flank of the blocking center, particularly striking 

during winter, are also predominantly a result of cold advection from higher latitudes under the 

northerly flow established along the eastern flank of the high-pressure system (see the anomalous 

wind fields in Fig. 2.5a-c). This colder air is carried towards southern Europe (e.g. north of the 

Black Sea), thus interacting with different air masses. As a result, other processes, such as diabatic 

cooling, and in particular, convective processes in warm seasons, can gain further importance in 

localized areas to the southeast of the blocking centers (Sousa et al. 2017a). This mixed 

contribution of different forcing terms at lower latitudes under blocking occurrence is confirmed 

by Fig. 2.14 and 2.15. In areas under the maximum geopotential height anomaly, warming due to 

reinforced subsidence and diabatic heating gains particular relevance, particularly for continental 

blocks. There are also differences in the relative contribution of each term depending on the season 

(Fig.2.5a-c and 2.5g-i):  warming due to horizontal advection is relevant during both winter and 

summer blocks, while anomalous downward motion is mostly relevant for winter blocking. On the 

other hand, significant diabatic heating dominates in summer, predominantly over continental 

areas (Fig. 2.5h-i). As shown later, the summer dominance of the diabatic term over land areas is 

well explained by changes in the radiative flux budgets.

Fig. 2.5 Mechanisms related to temperature anomalies in the lower troposphere (1000–850 hPa) 

during blocking and ridge days during winter (upper panels, a-c and d-f, respectively) and summer 

(lower panels, g-i and j-l, respectively). Color shadings depict anomalies in the mean daily 

temperature (in ºC). Solid (dashed) contours represent positive (negative) 500 hPa geopotential height 

anomalies in 15 dam intervals. Light grey vectors show anomalies in the horizontal wind direction. 

Symbols denote the highest contributing mechanism for the observed temperature changes at each grid 

point: horizontal advection (?), vertical advection (?) and diabatic processes (X). 

 

Regarding ridge days, warm horizontal advection from Atlantic air masses influences the 

temperature responses in the northern flank of the ridge, particularly during winter ATL and EUR 

ridges (Fig. 2.5d-e). This is associated with the passage of cyclones, but also with the 

corresponding changes in cloud cover and long-wave fluxes, as explained below.  Similarly to 

blocking, subsidence and diabatic processes are crucial in continental areas under the influence of 

winter and summer sub-tropical ridges (Fig. 2.14m-r and 2.15m-r). Adiabatic heating due to strong 

subsidence extends over larger areas in winter than in summer, mostly eastwards of the maximum 



2. European temperature responses to blocking 
 
 

45 
 

Z500 anomalies (Fig. 2.5e-f), while diabatic heating dominates the summer temperature responses 

(Fig. 2.5k-l). Over the Iberian Peninsula, subsidence and horizontal advection towards 

southwestern coasts are the main driver for above average summer temperatures during ATL 

ridges. 

It should be stressed that NCEP/NCAR temperature anomalies for the considered layer do not 

fully overlap with the TX and TN anomalies of the E-OBS datasets in all areas and for all regimes, 

thus partially explaining some discrepancies between the areas highlighted in Fig. 2.5 and Figs. 

2.3 and 2.4. Still, there are also some important dynamical features related to these discrepancies. 

For example, negative T2m anomalies during winter blocking (Fig. 2.3a-c, 2.3g-i) are more 

widespread than aloft (Fig. 2.5a-c). In particular, some areas with negative near-surface 

temperature anomalies display simultaneously positive anomalies in the highest level of the 

considered layer (850 hPa, not shown). This indicates a typical pattern of thermal inversion under 

high pressure systems, which extends westwards of the blocking center (see Fig. 2.16a-c). The 

thermal inversion and the corresponding imprisonment of cold air at lower levels are typical of 

enhanced long-wave radiative cooling, thus stressing the importance of diabatic processes for the 

near-surface temperature responses. During summer, the well-mixed boundary layer determines a 

better agreement between anomalies at surface and aloft, supporting the smaller role of horizontal 

advection when compared to other processes, particularly those associated to diabatic heating. 

 

Up to now, we have shown that diabatic processes are key to determine the near-surface 

temperature responses to blocking and ridges, particularly in summer. The diabatic term includes 

different processes, such as radiative fluxes, latent and sensible heat fluxes and frictional 

dissipation. To better frame the observed temperature responses to the weather regimes and the 

seasonal-dependent role of the diabatic term, we computed composites of surface radiative fluxes 

for blocking and ridges in winter (Fig. 2.6) and summer (Fig. 2.7), along with composites of total 

cloud cover anomalies (Fig. 2.8).  

 

The radiative forcing over Europe during winter blocking episodes is not remarkable, at least 

concerning short-wave fluxes (Fig. 2.6d-f), which are quite modest in high latitudes during months 

with reduced insolation. Anomalies are rather dominated by the gains (losses) in surface net long-

wave fluxes, which in turn are strongly associated with above (below) average cloud cover (see 

also Fig. 2.8a-c). For example, near the blocking centers, the enhanced nocturnal long-wave losses 

(Fig. 2.6a-c) under clear sky conditions are partly offset by diurnal short-wave gains (Fig. 2.6d-f). 

This winter radiative surface cooling signal is in agreement with that in the 1000-850 hPa layer 

due to the diabatic term (Fig. 2.14g-i), which is the leading process in areas to the southeast of the 

ATL and EUR blocking centers (Fig. 2.5a-b).

correspond to positive (negative) fluxes towards the surface.

47 
 

The radiative fluxes anomalies during winter ridges reveal an increase in diurnal radiative 

heating near the Z500 maximum (Fig. 2.6m-o), due to positive net short-wave fluxes under 

enhanced clear sky conditions over Iberia (ATL), Balkans (EUR) and Middle East (RUS). 

However, this signal is offset by the opposite negative long-wave fluxes (Fig. 2.6j-l) over the same 

southern regions, as reflected in the total radiative budget (Fig. 2.6p-r). In contrast, areas north of 

the ridge structures exhibit significant increases in cloud cover (Fig. 2.8d-f), which lead to positive 

anomalies in the surface long-wave (Fig. 2.6j-l) and total (Fig. 2.6p-r) radiative budgets. A similar 

increase in long-wave and total radiative fluxes is found north of the blocking systems, but 

restricted to very high latitudes (Fig. 2.6a-c, 2.6g-i). The winter radiative heating is particularly 

relevant for the UK and coastal areas of central Europe under ATL or EUR ridges (Fig. 2.6j-k), as 

well as some Mediterranean areas during EUR and RUS ridges (Fig. 2.6k-l). Its combined effect 

with the advection of mild Atlantic air masses explains the large positive near-surface temperature 

responses during ridge days (Fig. 2.3d-f). However, as long-wave radiative fluxes tend to cancel 

out the short-wave fluxes, on the overall diabatic processes are less important in the 1000-850 hPa 

layer than subsidence or advection, with the exception made for northern Russia (Fig. 2.5d-f). 

  

During summer, anomalies in radiative fluxes are larger than in winter, in accordance with the 

stronger contribution from diabatic processes (Fig. 2.5g-l) and an increase in insolation hours. Like 

in winter, below average cloud cover (Fig. 2.8g-l) over the centers’ systems results in simultaneous 

warming by diurnal radiative gains (Fig. 2.7d-f and Fig. 2.7m-o) and cooling by nocturnal radiative 

losses (Fig. 2.7a-c and Fig. 2.7j-l). Nonetheless, and different to winter, the summer increases in 

short-wave income are stronger in magnitude than the enhanced nocturnal surface long-wave 

losses over areas under the blocking and ridges centers. Thus, short-wave gains clearly dominate 

in summer, and the resulting net radiative balance (Fig. 2.7g-i and Fig. 2.7p-r) explains well the 

larger anomalies for TX than for TN. The subsequent increase in daily temperature range can be 

found for both blocking and ridge regimes, being particularly remarkable at higher latitudes for 

blocking episodes, and also for central Mediterranean areas during EUR ridges. On the other hand, 

areas south of blocking and north of ridges experience losses in net short-wave fluxes and gains in 

long-wave radiation. This is in agreement with increases in cloud cover (Fig. 2.8g-l) due to the 

deflection of humid Atlantic westerly flows around the high pressure centers (e.g., Trigo et al., 

2004; Sousa et al. 2017a). This effect on the radiative budget due to increased cloudiness is 

particularly evident for Atlantic areas in summer, when comparing ATL ridges to those located in 

EUR or RUS (Fig. 2.7p-r).

2.1.3.4 Changes in regional temperature distribution 

In this section we will analyze regional changes in the Probability Density Function (PDF) of 

daily TX and TN for each weather regime. These regional temperature responses will also be 

related to the previously discussed forcing mechanisms. The PDF analysis was performed using 

all grid point series of each region highlighted in magenta in Fig. 2.1. We computed regional PDFs 

for all days of each season and for each regime separately (Figs. 2.9 and 2.10), along with the 

corresponding changes in mean TN and TX and in their temporal variance. We also measured the 

degree of homogeneity inside each region (?T), by computing the standard deviation of the mean 

local temperatures of all grid points, thus accounting for the dispersion of the climatological TX 

and TN values within each region. As it can be seen in Figs. 2.9 and 2.10 the regions with larger 

values of ?T comprise important orographic barriers (Iberia, Italy and Turkey). 

 

Figure 2.9 indicates that wintertime PDF temperature distributions over the considered regions 

are generally shifted towards lower values for blocking, and higher values for ridge patterns. 

Warming due to the presence of ridge structures is on the overall larger than cooling due to 

blocking. The anomalous warming driven by winter ridges may lead to high temperatures over 

large parts of Europe, such as the Central European region (Figs. 2.9e-f). For this region, EUR 

ridges (red dashed lines in Fig. 2.9) result in a mean increase in TX of almost 6ºC, and of about 

4ºC in TN, as well as abnormally high frequencies of extremely warm winter days, while nights 

with TN below -10ºC are almost nonexistent. In the UK, the frequency of days with TX below 

freezing during ATL (blue dashed lines) and EUR ridge patterns becomes almost negligible (Fig. 

2.9b). While ATL and EUR ridges result in well above average temperatures over most of Europe, 

the same is not true for RUS ridges (green dashed lines, Fig. 2.9). In this case, well above average 

temperatures are restricted to the easternmost areas of Europe (cf. Fig. S6a-d for Russia and 

Turkey). However, in areas distant enough to the west of such structures (e.g., UK and Iberia) 

slightly negative temperature anomalies are found due to the presence of a trough westwards of 

the RUS ridge (Fig. 2.2f).  

During winter blocking, there is a shift towards colder TX and TN in all regions, which is 

particularly pronounced for ATL and EUR blocks (blue and red solid lines, Fig. 2.9). Furthermore, 

blocking promotes wintertime extreme cold days and nights over large parts of Europe, as inferred 

from the regional shifts towards the left end tails of the PDF distributions. In particular, ATL 

blocks are the main drivers of cold days in all regions, since the location of the high pressure center 

favors cold advection over large areas of the continent (as previously shown in Fig. 2.5a). For the 

same reason, during EUR blocks, colder than average temperatures are observed in Central Europe 

(Fig. 2.9e-f) and Italy (Fig. 2.9g-h), extending towards Russia and Turkey (Fig. 2.17a-d). 

Remarkable PDF changes during winter RUS blocking are mostly restricted to the easternmost 

areas, as it was found for RUS ridges.

Winter ridges in the ATL and EUR sectors reduce the variance of TX and TN in the UK (Fig. 

2.9a-b) by more than 10%, while in Central Europe they are associated with smaller (larger)  

variability in TX (TN), as shown in Fig. 2.9f (2.9e). On the overall, winter blocking patterns result 

in qualitatively similar, but smaller changes in variance. For southern sectors, most weather 

regimes concur with larger wintertime variance in TX and TN. This is particularly clear for the 

Italian sector (Fig. 2.9g-h), where TX displays around 25% more variability during EUR ridges.  

 

During summer (Fig. 2.10), the regional PDF responses to blocking and ridges are no longer 

opposite in sign for all regions. While ridges (blocks) are still associated with warmer (colder) than 

average temperatures in the southernmost regions (Figs. 2.10c-d and 2.10g-h), both regimes cause 

shifts towards higher temperatures in the northernmost regions (Figs. 2.10 a-b and 2.10e-f). Larger 

PDF changes are observed for ridges than for blocks, and in TX than in TN, in agreement with 

Fig. 2.4 and the dominant role of short-wave over long-wave radiative fluxes in summer (Fig. 2.7). 

In the Iberian Peninsula, there is a very clear rise in the number of days with TX above 35ºC for 

ATL and EUR ridges when compared to other regimes (Fig. 2.10d). In Central Europe, EUR 

blocking and ridge patterns result in an impressive increase in the frequency of days above 30 and 

35ºC (Fig. 2.10f), respectively. As we move to eastern Europe, the RUS patterns become more 

relevant (see PDF changes for Russia and Turkey in Fig. 2.17). Concerning summer changes in 

variance, we found a slight increase for almost all patterns and regions, particularly pronounced in 

Italy (Fig. 2.10g-h) during EUR ridges.

 Changes in extreme temperatures associated with blocking and ridges were also investigated for 

each region of Fig. 2.1. To do so, we computed for each grid point the number of days below the 

10th percentile of winter TN (TN10, hereafter) and above the 90th percentile of summer TX 

(TX90, hereafter). The percentiles, which were derived from all seasonal days of the period 1950–

averaged for all grid points of each region. The relative changes in these extreme indices associated 

with each weather regime are presented in Fig. 2.11 (expressed in % with respect to that expected 

from the full 1950-2012 climatology). 

Changes in TN10 confirm the previously described opposite responses for blocking and ridge 

patterns during winter. On the overall, there is an increase in cold winter extremes during blocking 

(filled triangle symbols in Fig. 2.11). In particular, the increases in TN10 exceed 10% over Iberia 

(Fig. 2.11c) and Central Europe (Fig 2.11b) during ATL blocks. On the other hand, ridges (open 

triangle symbols), especially those occurring in the ATL and EUR sectors, reduce the occurrence 

of winter cold extremes in all regions. Similar responses to blocking and ridges are found in winter 

TN10 for easternmost areas (cf. Fig. 2.18 for Russia and Turkey), but being the RUS patterns more 

relevant here. 

During summer, blocking (filled circles) and ridges (open circles) cause opposite changes in the 

frequency of extremely hot days in southern Europe (Iberia and Italy, Fig. 2.11c-d). However, in 

areas further north (UK and Central Europe, Fig. 11a-b), both weather regimes promote substantial 

increases in TX90. Thus, while ridging is associated to a rise in the frequency of extremely hot 

days in almost all regions, the same is not true for blocks, which decrease (increase) TX90 in 

southern (northern) regions. In particular, nearly 30% more extremely hot days occur in Central 

Europe and Italy under EUR ridges (Fig. 2.11b and 2.11d, respectively), while in Iberia TX90 

increases by around 10% during ATL and EUR ridges (Fig. 2.11b). Differently, the most important 

regimes for the occurrence of hot days in the UK are ATL and EUR blocks (Fig. 2.11a), which 

cause TX90 increases of around 10% and 15%, respectively.  Again, for easternmost areas, weather 

regimes centered in the RUS sector trigger the largest changes in TX90. Thus, in Turkey (Fig. 

2.18b), extremely hot conditions are driven essentially by RUS ridges, whereas in Russia (Fig. 

2.18a) both RUS ridges and blocks result in a 15-20% increase in TX90. In fact, the impact of 

anomalous Z500 fields in the Russian area has been widely discussed due to recent events, such 

as the 2010 Russian mega-heatwave (e.g., Barriopedro et al. 2011).

2.1.4 Discussion and Conclusions 

In this work we introduced a clear separation between high-latitude blocking structures and sub-

tropical ridges occurring in different sectors of the Euro-Atlantic area (30 ºW-60 ºE), both in terms 

of climatology and seasonal impacts on temperature in the European continent. While winter 

blocking characteristics have been extensively studied, our work also focuses on the 

characterization of blocking impacts on European summer temperature, which has been much less 

investigated. Furthermore, the extension of this comprehensive analysis towards the sub-tropical 

ridge phenomenology is a significant novelty. In this sense, this systematical separation between 

high- and low-latitude structures may be used in other climatological and dynamical applications, 

besides the one presented in this work.

We introduced an objective separation of the different forcing mechanisms behind the 

temperature responses associated to each considered weather regime. This approach enabled 

quantifying the importance of the following forcing factors: horizontal advection, vertical 

advection and diabatic heating. Particular attention was devoted to the radiative contribution to the 

diabatic term. To our knowledge, this systematic quantification of the different contributing factors 

to the temperature responses represents an innovation in the literature of climatological impacts 

related to blocking and ridge phenomenology – Seo et al. (2016) used a similar approach to link 

temperature anomalies with the Madden-Julian Oscillation. Despite the limitations in the 

methodology, the results are in agreement with previous studies which have analyzed air parcel 

trajectories over Europe and the associated surface temperature responses for some specific case 

studies or regional weather systems. Thus, our approach corroborates these results from another 

perspective, and also distinguishes between the physical mechanisms associated with blocking and 

ridges, and to what extent they critically depend on their exact locations.  

Finally, we complemented our analysis by evaluating changes in the PDF distributions of 

seasonal maximum and minimum temperature for different European regions, and in the frequency 

of extremely cold nights in winter and hot days in summer. This assessment allowed a finer look 

at regional impacts, framing smaller scale responses into the previous larger scale analysis. The 

main results of this study can be summarized as follows: 

1) In winter, the synoptic signatures and near-surface temperature responses are generally 

opposite between blocking and ridge patterns. In particular, most of Europe experiences colder 

(warmer) than average winter conditions during blocking (ridge) days. On the contrary, the 

summer temperature responses to blocking and ridges are more regional and not so dissimilar, with 

above average regional temperatures for both patterns. Negative temperature anomalies are 

essentially restricted to southern Europe during blocking episodes. The spring transition in the 

blocking signatures from winter cold to summer warm anomalies in central and northern areas of 

Europe has been noted recently by Brunner et al (2017). 

2) Concerning the regional classification of blocking and ridges, the largest impacts 

associated to the weather regimes of each specific sector follow the specific longitudinal locations 

of the maximum 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies. Nevertheless, blocking and ridge 

structures located over central and western Europe are usually the ones with larger and more 

extensive temperature anomalies, as they cause the largest disruption of the Atlantic jet stream. 

3)   During winter, the horizontal advection by the anomalous flow plays a dominant role in 

shaping the lower-tropospheric temperature responses to blocking and ridge systems. In particular, 

the cold advection of high-latitude air masses towards central and southern Europe during blocking 

episodes and the transport of Atlantic moist and warm air towards the continent during sub-tropical 

ridges are key processes. Over continental areas, long-wave radiative losses associated to blocking 

and ridges tend to offset the near-surface temperature anomalies induced by changes in short-wave 

radiation fluxes. In summer, diabatic heating is the most important factor in determining warm 

temperature anomalies during blocking and ridge regimes. Different to winter, the induced 

anomalies in short-wave radiative fluxes overwhelm those in long-wave radiative fluxes due to the 

summer increase in insolation hours. As a consequence, blocking and ridges prompt larger 



2. European temperature responses to blocking 
 
 

57 
 

responses in maximum than in minimum temperatures, and a resulting increase in the temperature 

daily range. The adiabatic heating triggered by reinforced subsidence during blocking and ridges 

plays a secondary role in rising lower-tropospheric temperatures, being more relevant during 

winter, and particularly important near the central locations of the anticyclonic circulation.  

4) This process-oriented attribution has enabled more detailed regional and seasonal analyses, 

additionally reporting some smaller-scale exceptions. However, some limitations must be 

acknowledged. For example, although a dominant forcing factor has often been identified, in some 

cases there is a similar contribution or a partial cancelation between the considered forcings. In 

spite of this, our results are in agreement with Lagrangian-based studies (Pfahl et al., 2015; Bieli 

et al., 2015; Santos et al., 2015), which have noticed that winter cold events are associated to long 

air mass trajectories, whereas summer events are more related to in situ warming due to enhanced 

radiation and surface heat fluxes.  

5)  On the overall, winter changes in extremely cold temperatures are spatially coherent, with 

generalized increases (decreases) in the frequency of TN10 during blocking (ridge) occurrence. 

Summer changes in extremely hot days are more regionally focused during blocking and ridge 

regimes. This is particularly evident in southern Europe, where we show a clear dissociation 

between the impacts of blocking (decreases in TX90) and ridges (increases in TX90). Further, the 

impact of ridges is particularly dependent on the exact longitudinal location of northwards 

extensions of the sub-tropical ridge belt. 

In summary, we have clarified the very distinct role of blocking and ridges in European 

temperature. This gains particular relevance for summer extreme temperatures in southern Europe, 

which has been affected by major heatwaves such as the episodes of 2003 and 2007 and is bound 

to suffer even more frequent heatwaves in coming decades (Christensen et al., 2013). In this sense, 

there has been some misperception and imprecise attribution of heat episodes in these areas to 

classical blocking definitions (e.g. Trigo et al., 2005). We are confident to have achieved a more 

complete and consistent phenomenological description of the distinctive impacts of blocking and 

ridges on European winter and summer temperature. Finally, we must acknowledge the relevance 

of performing further sensitivity analyses using different reanalyses datasets when carrying out 

specific methodologies as the one performed in this work, namely the temperature tendency 

diagnostic.

Summary 

 

Context and objectives 

In this chapter the main effects of blocking activity in European precipitation regimes are 

analyzed, as presented in Sousa et al. (2017a). Section 3.1 describes the contrasting signals of 

blocked and strong zonal flow regimes. The E-OBS precipitation dataset is used to analyze the 

impacts of blocking/zonal regimes in European precipitation regimes. The regional impacts of 

blocking occurrence in different sectors aims a more comprehensive assessment than 

previously performed in the literature. Special attention is devoted to some 

synoptic/dynamical processes and shifts in precipitation regimes associated to each considered 

atmospheric pattern. Based on the methodology presented in Chapter 2, the separation of 

impacts on European precipitation associated to high- and low-latitude high pressure 

structures (blocks and ridges, respectively) is performed in Section 3.2. The regional impacts 

of blocking and ridge occurrence in winter European solid precipitation (snow-cover) are also 

addressed (Section 3.3). 

 

Methods 

We computed composites of daily precipitation and winter snow-cover anomalies occurring 

during blocked and zonal flow days in three longitudinal sectors (ATL, EUR and RUS). To 

further characterize the synoptic environment, a subset of variables derived from the 

NCEP/NCAR dataset was examined: Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT), an instability index 

(Lifted Index – LI) and extratropical cyclone activity. The changes in the Probability Density 

Functions (PDFs) of precipitation distributions in several subcontinental areas over northern 

and southern Europe were also computed. 

 

Results 

Our results show a clear north-south dipole in the precipitation regime responses. Blocking 

occurrence leads to below average precipitation in the northern half of Europe (more than 

50%), due to the ceasing of moist westerly Atlantic flows, and to increased precipitation in 

southernmost areas, which is in agreement with increased atmospheric instability. A reversal 

of these anomalies is found for strong zonal flow days, which are responsible for precipitation 

deficits in southernmost countries of Europe, and precipitation increases further north. Within 

strong zonal flow regimes, we find that subtropical ridges are associated with particularly dry 

conditions in the Mediterranean. On the contrary, the analysis of changes in precipitation 

distributions shows a clear shift towards more torrential regimes in the Mediterranean 

environment during blocking episodes.  

Winter snow-cover is shown to be enhanced during blocking occurrence in large areas of 

Europe (including southernmost areas), particularly for ATL patterns, which increase by 

~50% the number of days with snow covered surface in central Europe. This impact is related 

with much colder than average conditions under northerly advection. On the other hand, ATL 

and EUR ridge regimes impose a much lower frequency of days with snowed soils in large 

parts of the continent, due to a predominantly mild zonal flow.

Paper published in Climate Dynamics (2017a) 

 

In this work we performed an analysis on the impacts of blocking episodes on seasonal and 

annual European precipitation and the associated physical mechanisms. Distinct domains were 

considered in detail taking into account different blocking center positions spanning between the 

Atlantic and western Russia. Significant positive precipitation anomalies are found for 

southernmost areas while generalized negative anomalies (up to 75 % in some areas) occur in 

large areas of central and northern Europe. This dipole of anomalies is reversed when compared 

to that observed during episodes of strong zonal flow conditions. We illustrate that the location 

of the maximum precipitation anomalies follows quite well the longitudinal positioning of the 

blocking centers and discuss regional and seasonal differences in the precipitation responses. To 

better understand the precipitation anomalies, we explore the blocking influence on cyclonic 

activity. The results indicate a split of the storm-tracks north and south of blocking systems, 

leading to an almost complete reduction of cyclonic centers in northern and central Europe and 

increases in southern areas, where cyclone frequency doubles during blocking episodes. 

However, the underlying processes conductive to the precipitation anomalies are distinct 

between northern and southern European regions, with a significant role of atmospheric 

instability in southern Europe, and moisture availability as the major driver at higher latitudes. 

This distinctive underlying process is coherent with the characteristic patterns of latent heat 

release from the ocean associated with blocked and strong zonal flow patterns. We also analyzed 

changes in the full range of the precipitation distribution of several regional sectors during 

blocked and zonal days. Results show that precipitation reductions in the areas under direct 

blocking influence are driven by a substantial drop in the frequency of moderate rainfall classes. 

Contrarily, southwards of blocking systems, frequency increases in moderate to extreme rainfall 

classes largely determine the precipitation anomaly in the accumulated totals. In this context, we 

show the close relationship between the more intrinsic torrential nature of Mediterranean 

precipitation regimes and the role of blocking systems in increasing the probability of extreme 

events.

3.1.1 Introduction 

Blocking systems wield a significant role on the atmospheric dynamics of mid-latitude regions, 

and their frequency and variability impinge on the climatology of large continental areas. As a 

result, these high latitude quasi-stationary anticyclones have been frequently studied throughout 

the last decades, regarding their climatology and characterization (e.g., Rex, 1950b, 1951; Treidl 

et al., 1981; Barriopedro et al., 2006, 2010a; Croci-Maspoli et al., 2007; Davini et al., 2012a), 

their specific impacts (e.g., Trigo et al., 2004; Sillmann and Croci-Maspoli, 2009; Buehler et al., 

2011; Barriopedro et al., 2011; Ruti et al., 2014; Sousa et al., 2016), as well as their 

representation in General Circulation Models (Barriopedro et al., 2010a, b, Matsueda et al., 

2009; Scaife et al., 2010; Barnes et al., 2012; Vial and Osborn, 2012; Anstey et al., 2013; Dunn-

Sigouin and Son, 2013; Masato et al., 2013). Previous studies have found that, over the Euro-

Atlantic sector, the occurrence of winter blocking systems disrupts the dominant zonal 

circulation that affects the European continent, often leading to a reversal of this prevailing 

westerly flux. As a consequence, low-pressure systems travelling from the Atlantic towards 

Europe are diverted from their usual paths, resulting in a large decrease of rainfall for most of the 

European countries. An exception can be found for southernmost and northernmost sectors of 

Europe, which experience increased precipitation due to a bifurcation of the storm-track around 

the blocking high structure (Trigo et al., 2004; Nieto et al., 2007; Sousa et al., 2016). 

It is worth mentioning the differences between a blocking pattern and a subtropical ridge 

(Barriopedro et al., 2010a) although sometimes they can induce similar anomalies in surface 

climate variables (García-Herrera et al., 2010). Some authors have shown that northward 

strengthening’s of sub-tropical ridges in the Eastern Atlantic during the wet season have opposite 

precipitation responses in Western and Southern Europe to those associated with blocking (e.g. 

Santos et al., 2009, 2013). Such separation of phenomena should be kept in mind to stress how 

important is the distinction between the impacts of this type of ridge patterns and those caused by 

high latitude blocking, which we are concerned about in this particular study. In fact, the balance 

between strong westerly zonal flows and their interruption at higher (lower) latitudes during 

blocking (ridge) episodes tend to dominate a large fraction of the variability of European rainfall 

(Hoy et al., 2014). Teleconnection indices associated with major large-scale patterns affecting 

the North-Atlantic and European sectors (particularly the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Eastern 

Atlantic and the Scandinavian pattern) are frequently used in order to explain the intra and inter-

annual fluctuations of the intensity of zonal flow, and consequently of precipitation series (e.g. 

Trigo et al., 2008; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2009; Altava-Ortiz et al., 2010; Casanueva et al., 

2014). Still, such one-dimensional monthly-based approaches hamper a deeper comprehension of 

more complex spatial patterns occurring at intra-monthly time scales, such as blocking systems, 

reinforcing the need of using more objective blocking detection schemes. 

Previous studies based on these algorithms have shown that the impacts of Euro-Atlantic 

blocks in terms of winter precipitation regimes essentially change with latitude, with a general 

decrease in most of central areas of Europe, and increases at lower and higher latitudes, albeit 

over less extensive areas. Such changes may have significant relevance on the annual total 

during years with highly anomalous frequency of blocking occurrence. However, studies of 



3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes

European precipitation changes associated with blocking have been restricted to the winter 

season. In this regard, most of the European continent lacks a comprehensive and all year-round 

analysis on changes in precipitation due to blocking occurrence. This analysis is of particular 

relevance in southern areas of Europe with Mediterranean climates, where precipitation regimes 

during the warm season tend to be more torrential, i.e., with a higher contribution of intense and 

more isolated rainfall episodes to annual totals (e.g. Kutiel et al., 1996; Peñarrocha et al., 2002; 

Burgueno et al., 2010; Cortesi et al., 2013). Therefore, in this perspective, linking precipitation 

anomalies with blocking occurrence throughout the use of objective detection methods acquires 

particular importance. An additional asset of these methods is their versatility to address changes 

in surface impacts as a function of the blocking location. In this sense, previous works have 

shown that the distinction of separate (yet large) blocking sectors in the Euro-Atlantic sector still 

results in considerably different impacts at finer scales inside the Euro-Atlantic sector (Yao and 

Luo, 2014a, b), and even in smaller areas such as the Iberian Peninsula (Sousa et al., 2016). 

Accordingly, the relevance of the specific longitudinal position of the center of a blocking 

system cannot be disregarded when analyzing impacts at such a large scale as for the European 

continent. 

On the other hand, blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes have been generally 

characterized throughout the use of composites of either absolute or relative precipitation 

anomalies (e.g. Trigo et al., 2004; Masato et al,. 2011). This approach focuses on changes in the 

mean and hence, has neglected to a large extent the importance of shifts in precipitation 

distributions which arise from these particular synoptic patterns. Extreme Values theory has been 

used to identify either changes in precipitation and temperature extremes over very confined 

regions (e.g., Buehler et al., 2011; Sousa et al., 2016) or shifts in temperature distributions 

(Sillmann et al., 2011). To the best of our knowledge, the assessment of the impact of blocking 

patterns on the entire precipitation distribution has only been addressed outside of Europe in 

regions such as California (Hughes et al. 2009). The investigation of these precipitation changes 

can be assessed through rather simple methodologies, like the one used by Soares et al. (2014), 

which analyzed changes in Probability Density Functions (PDFs) of precipitation series for 

Portugal, in the scope of Regional Climate Models performance and future scenarios evaluation. 

This method follows the works of Perkins et al. (2007) and Boberg et al. (2009, 2010). 

Works such as Trigo et al. (2004), Michel et al. (2012), Pfahl (2014) or Sousa et al. (2016) 

have also shown that the precipitation increases found in southern sectors of Europe during 

blocking episodes are mainly driven by dynamical features. These factors include synoptic scale 

processes such as increases in cyclone frequency, but there are also other thermodynamical 

factors which can enhance atmospheric instability at the local or mesoscale (Lolis et al., 2004; 

Ricard et al., 2012). Hence, smaller scale processes (e.g. latent heat fluxes) must be addressed to 

understand regional impacts of blocking occurrence, in line with the distinct shaping of 

precipitation Probability Density Functions associated to blocking occurrence in specific sectors 

of the European domain. 

The main objective of this work is to characterize the distinct impacts on European 

precipitation regimes of blocking occurrence in three different sectors, taking into account the

68 
 

entire distribution of precipitation series, which allows evaluating the net changes as well as the 

responses in precipitation intensity. The changes in the precipitation regimes of several regions 

will be supported by a comparison between blocked and strong zonal patterns occurring over 

different longitudinal sectors of the target domain. Finally, the precipitation responses will be 

interpreted in terms of dynamical and thermodynamical processes. The work is structured as 

follows: in Sect. 3.1.2, the datasets are presented, along with a characterization of typical 

atmospheric patterns during blocking episodes; in Sect. 3.1.3 the precipitation anomalies 

registered during blocked and zonal patterns are presented, followed by the main dynamical 

drivers associated to these atmospheric patterns in Sect. 3.1.4; the different responses in terms of 

changes in precipitation distributions due to blocked and zonal patterns are presented in Sect. 

3.1.5; finally, a summary and discussion of the obtained results is offered in Sect. 3.1.6. 

 

3.1.2 Data and Methods 

We used daily precipitation data for Europe from the E-OBS dataset during the period 1950–

2012 (Haylock et al. 2008). This European land-only daily high-resolution gridded dataset is 

accessible throughout the European Climate Assessment and Dataset (ECA&amp;amp;D), and is available 

on a grid with a horizontal resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°, based on the interpolation of daily 

observations from meteorological stations. Despite the overall good quality of this dataset we 

must acknowledge that this dataset has caveats in areas where the spatial distribution of stations 

is sparser, such as biased and over smoothed precipitation fields in some cases, as well as 

possible effects in extremes (e.g., Hofstra et al. 2009, 2010). 

The dataset from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis (Kalnay et al., 1996), on a horizontal resolution 

of 2.5° × 2.5° for the 1950–2012 period is also used. The variables explicitly considered were: 

daily fields of 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), Lifted Index (LI) and Latent Heat Flux 

(LHF). In addition, several fields also from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis were employed to 

compute the Integrated Water Vapor Transport between 1000 and 300 hPa (IVT, Ramos et al., 

2015) and the following catalogues of weather systems: (i) blocking events (Barriopedro et al., 

2006); (ii) strong zonal flow days (Sousa et al., 2016); (iii) extratropical cyclones for the 

northern hemisphere obtained by using the methodology described in Trigo (2006a). These 

derived datasets are used to explore the blocking signatures in precipitation regimes and to 

interpret the role of the associated dynamical and thermodynamical processes. 

The particular characteristics of the blocked and zonal days catalogues are described next. We 

distinguish synoptic conditions characterized by blocked patterns and strong zonal flows by 

objectively identifying days under such atmospheric conditions in the Eurasian sector. These 

methods rely on the Z500 field from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. The catalogue of blocked days 

was developed by Barriopedro et al. (2006) - further information on the methodology can be 

found in that work. The authors have used this and other similar blocking datasets extensively for 

different applications, such as to characterize blocking effects on total ozone (Barriopedro et al., 

2010c) and stratospheric variability (Barriopedro and Calvo, 2014), and in evaluating the impact

of blocking patterns in the Iberian Peninsula using a high-resolution precipitation dataset (Sousa 

et al. 2016). 

Following the latter work, the locations of the maximum Z500 for each identified blocking 

pattern will hereafter be called blocking centers. The reduction of the large-scale blocked pattern 

to a single central gridpoint (representative of the entire blocking system) enables an objective 

separation of blocking in different spatial sectors. Thus, three sectors were defined: the Atlantic 

sector (ATL) which includes all blocking centers located in 30°–0°W, the European sector 

(EUR), spanning 0–30°E and the Russian sector (RUS), including blocking centers positioned 

between 30 and 60°E. Figure 3.1 presents the annual mean frequency of blocking center 

locations in each gridpoint. We must stress that this classification of blocks into ATL, EUR an 

RUS types intends to assess different precipitation responses and changes in precipitation 

regimes purely based on the geographical location of the considered high pressure system, which 

strongly influences the synoptic environment associated to blocking occurrence in each 

considered sector. The selection of these blocking sectors is based on previous studies that have 

already identified distinctive features in the resulting blocking signatures (Wang et al., 2010; 

Masato et al., 2011; Sousa et al., 2016). 

 

Fig. 3.1 Thick black boxes identify the considered sectors for blocking center location: Atlantic 

(ATL)-from 30 W to 0 W; European (EUR)-from 0E to 30E; Russian (RUS)-from 30E to 60E. The 

shadings indicate the annual mean frequency of blocking center locations in each gridpoint. Blocks 

outside the 45 N to 70 N latitude strip were discarded in both sectors. Thin blue boxes identify areas 

which were considered in the regional assessment performed in Section 3.1.5. 

 

Seasonal composites of Z500 anomalies during blocking days in each sector are shown in Fig. 

3.2. Positive Z500 anomalies centered in the respective blocking sector dominate the northern 

latitudes, being larger in the colder seasons for all sectors. They capture well the canonical 

signatures associated with blocking over its climatologically preferred sectors of occurrence in 

the Eurasian sector, which include eastern Atlantic, Scandinavian and the Urals, respectively.

Negative anomalies of the Z500 fields are less pronounced and usually found southwards and 

northwards of the blocking centers, mainly during ATL blocks. Also, in this region, summer 

blocks display a northward extension of subtropical wave-breaking systems near the Azores 

high. It is important to note that some blocking events contribute to the composites of more than 

one sector during their lifecycle, since they tend to evolve eastwards towards Europe (Croci-

Maspoli et al., 2007; Barriopedro et al., 2010a; Sousa et al., 2016).

geopotential height for blocking centers in each sector and for all seasons. All values are in 

decameters (dam) and the thick line represents the 550 dam isohypse. 

 

As a complement to highlight the large impacts resulting from zonal flow reversals which 

occur during blocking episodes, we also computed a catalogue of days were strong zonal flow 

conditions occur in the same three sectors (ATL, EUR and RUS). They represent strong westerly 

flows and hence a large-scale atmospheric pattern that is nearly opposite to that of blocking.

They were computed following very simple criteria based on several empirical thresholds 

imposed on the meridional mid-latitude Z500 gradients to ensure a strong westerly flow. See 

Trigo et al. (2004) for further details on the methodology. 

Extratropical cyclones for the northern hemisphere were obtained by adapting the methodology 

described in Trigo (2006a) and recently used to assess and intercompare the most common 

features of mid-latitude cyclones, including the most active regions, the most common 

trajectories, inter-annual variability and trends (e.g. Vicente-Serrano et al. 2011; Neu et al. 

2013), cyclone formation mechanisms and impacts (e.g. Liberato et al., 2012, 2013). The 

objective cyclone identification is based on the detection of local minima in 1000 hPa 

geopotential height. The cyclone tracking consists on a nearest neighbor search in the previous 

Z1000 field, considering several thresholds: (i) within a certain area, the cyclone speed should 

not exceed 50 km/h in the westward direction and 160 km/h in any other. Additionally, the 

cyclone speed should be higher than 12 km/h. These criteria allow to include the most rapidly 

deepening cyclones (e.g. Xynthia, Liberato et al., 2013) and to filter the stationary cyclones; (ii) 

during the lifecycle the cyclone should reach a minimum central pressure corresponding to a see 

level pressure below 1020 hPa; (iii) a minimum lifetime of 24 h. 

 

3.1.3 Changes in mean precipitation rates 

In order to evaluate the distinct impacts of the different blocking locations on precipitation 

regimes, we computed the composites for absolute and relative anomalies of daily precipitation, 

during blocked and zonal days, in each of the three considered sectors, at the annual and seasonal 

temporal scales (Figs. 3.3, 3.4). When evaluating the resulting relative anomaly composites one 

must bear in mind the large range of precipitation values that coexist within such a large domain 

as the European continent. Thus, one must take into account that similar absolute anomalies in 

regions with very distinct total annual precipitation climatologies have different relevance. 

Consequently, to ensure this distinction we first considered the annual composites for the relative 

changes in precipitation during blocked and zonal days, as presented in Fig. 3.3. 



3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes 
 
 

72 
 

 

Fig. 3.3 Annual composites for daily precipitation anomalies (%) in Europe during blocking (upper 

row) and strong zonal flow (middle row) days in the ATL (left column), EUR (central column) and 

RUS (right column) sectors. The difference between the regional blocking and strong zonal flow 

composites is presented in the bottom row. Only statistically significant anomalies at the 5 % level 

are shown (two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). 

 

Figure 3.3 clearly shows that for the three considered sectors, the presence of blocking systems 

leads to well below average precipitation in a wide region under direct influence of the 

anticyclonic circulation. Maximum decreases of near 75 % are recorded in northern Europe near 

the blocking centers, which corresponds to an almost complete cease of precipitating days. The 

maximum negative anomaly is well collocated with the maximum Z500 anomaly of the 

respective sector (Fig. 3.2), being more extensive for EUR blocking. On the other hand, the 

increase in precipitation in southern areas of Europe, as well as in the Atlantic strip of 

Scandinavia matches well with the negative Z500 anomalies, which arise northward and 

southward of blocking systems (as shown in Fig. 3.2). These positive precipitation anomalies 

shift eastwards with the considered blocking sector, thus following the relative west-east 

migration of the maximum Z500 positive anomaly (blocking center). At the annual scale, the 

widest positive anomalies are found for ATL blocks, during which a large portion of Iberia, Italy, 

and the Balkans region experience wetter than usual conditions. In particular, daily precipitation 

rates in southeastern Iberia almost double. 



3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes 
 
 

73 
 

During strong zonal westerly flows these anomalies are essentially inverted, with a significant 

reduction in precipitation amounts at lower latitudes, particularly around the Mediterranean 

basin. Much less significant losses are also found for northernmost areas of Scandinavia. On the 

contrary, sharp increases in precipitation rates are found in most central and northern Europe, 

with gains close to 100 % in Benelux, Germany and southern Scandinavia during strong zonal 

flows in the EUR sector. The difference between composites for blocked and zonal flows 

sharpens their opposite responses in daily precipitation anomalies, thus illustrating the very 

significant impacts of zonal flow reversals. 

The presented changes in precipitation are in general good agreement with those in the 

frequency of dry days (below 1 mm) - see Fig. 3.13 from the Supplementary Material. In Sect. 

3.5, we will address in more detail how the changes in the number of wet days are distributed for 

different precipitation intensities. 

As stated before, annual rainfall totals in the European domain range from a few hundred mm 

in dryer regions to several thousand mm in mountainous regions, particularly in Atlantic coastal 

areas (Haylock et al. 2008). This must be taken into account when analyzing relative anomalies, 

as a change of 50 % per day in a dry region/season corresponds to a much lower absolute 

precipitation anomaly than in a corresponding wet region. Therefore, we now present (Fig. 3.4) 

the corresponding seasonal analysis of Fig. 3.3 but based on the precipitation absolute anomalies 

at the seasonal scale. In this case, we summarize the results presenting the difference in daily 

rates between blocking and strong zonal flow days.  

 

When using absolute anomalies, the relative changes are emphasized in regions where seasonal 

precipitation amounts are high, as for example in central and northern Europe during most of the 

year, or in easternmost interior areas during the warm seasons. Nevertheless, increases of 2-3 

mm per day are significant in relatively dry areas (such as southernmost Europe), as previously 

depicted in Fig. 3.3. When blocked conditions prevail, precipitation losses in the UK and central 

Europe are quite striking throughout the year. Summer precipitation responses often embrace 

lower spatial extensions; however, in some regions such as the northernmost countries and 

Russia–where precipitation in form of snow is often recorded in colder months–the summer 

deficits represent the largest changes. 

This seasonal analysis also helps distinguish seasonal precipitation responses that are masked 

at the annual scale. For example, during summer, blocking systems and their associated impacts 

shift north, and rainfall increases in parts of continental Europe–suggesting a rise in convective 

precipitation during summer blocks, as it will be discussed further ahead.

3.1.4 Synoptic and dynamics associated to different blocking locations 

To better understand the processes triggering the precipitation anomalies associated with 

blocking (particularly relevant in southern Europe) we analyzed the changes in the frequency of 

extratropical cyclonic activity occurring during blocked and zonal regimes. According to Neu et 

al. (2013) a cyclone refers to a point (the cyclone center) identified on the Earth’s surface at a 

certain time using a certain methodology. The annual mean climatological frequency of 



3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes 
 
 

75 
 

extratropical cyclone center locations in the Euro-Atlantic-Russian sectors is shown in the top 

panel of Fig. 3.5, along with their relative anomalies (in %) during blocked and zonal events in 

each sector. 

 

Fig. 3.5 Top: annual mean frequency of non-stationary cyclone centers (counted in 2.5° × 2.5° 

boxes). Middle: row annual mean changes (in %) in the cyclone frequency during blocking episodes 

in the ATL (middle left), EUR (middle center) and RUS (middle right) sectors. Bottom: row annual 

mean changes (in %) in the cyclone frequency during strong zonal flow episodes in the ATL (bottom 

left), EUR (bottom center) and RUS (bottom right) sectors. Increases are shown with blue shading 

and decreases with red shading. Stippling corresponds to areas with very low mean annual 

frequency of cyclone occurrence (below 0.5 per year). 

 

A clear increase in cyclonic activity (non-stationary near-surface systems) in southwestern 

Europe is found during ATL blocks (Fig. 3.5, middle left), contrasting with an almost complete 

cutback in the UK area, where cyclonic activity is almost non-existent during blocking patterns 

(relative changes near 100 %). This decrease shifts eastwards as we consider blocking sectors 

further east. In the particular cases of EUR and RUS blocks, increases in cyclone frequency are 

also found south of the blocking structures, although more spatially confined and much less 

pronounced. These changes are in agreement with the well-known blocking effect on storm-

tracks and the resulting split in two branches–north and south of the blocking high. During zonal 



3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes 
 
 

76 
 

patterns consistent increases in cyclone activity are found at higher latitudes, ranging from 

Iceland to eastern areas of Scandinavia and northern Russia, along with an eastward extension of 

the strongest branch of the Jetstream. On the southern flank of the Jetstream mean location we 

find negative anomalies in the frequency of cyclones. These occur over large portions of western 

and central Europe during strong westerly flows in the ATL and EUR, which in the specific case 

of the former synoptic pattern contrast with simultaneous increases (reaching 50 %) in eastern 

Mediterranean areas. Modest increases in extratropical cyclone paths at lower latitudes are also 

found during strong westerly flow regimes. Nevertheless, these changes tend to be comparatively 

smaller than those during blocking. Similar spatial patterns have been found for the changes in 

cut-off lows frequency during blocked/zonal conditions (Sousa et al., 2016; Nieto et al., 2007). 

As expected, the southward shift in cyclonic activity during blocking episodes is in fair 

agreement with the decrease (increase) in precipitation in northern (southern) Europe. This 

impact is particularly striking during ATL blocks, which exert the largest influence on the track 

of storms approaching Europe, and accordingly, on the European moisture sources of the 

Atlantic Ocean, as it will be detailed further ahead. On the other hand, the modest increases in 

cyclone frequency over some Mediterranean areas during zonal flows are not accompanied by 

significant rises in precipitation rates (Fig. 3.3). 

To complement the obtained changes in cyclonic activity and deep further in the processes 

behind the precipitation responses, we computed composites of Z500, LI, and IVT (and the 

corresponding mean horizontal transport of IVT) for blocked and zonal days. The anomalous 

fields of these variables are shown simultaneously in Fig. 3.6, in order to evaluate concurrently 

the dynamic and thermodynamical processes (including moisture fluxes and atmospheric 

instability).

Fig. 3.6 Annual composites of the daily Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT, in kg m?1 s?1, blue 

shading), and its anomaly in the bottom panels (brown to green shading), the Lifted Index anomaly 

(LI, in C, reddish thick lines), 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500, in dam, thin grey lines – the 

thicker grey line corresponds to the 550 dam isohypse) and mean horizontal transport (black arrows, 

kg m?1 s?1) for blocking (upper row) days, strong zonal flow days (middle row) days and their 

difference (bottom row). Left, center and right columns correspond to composites for weather 

patterns occurring in the ATL, EUR and RUS sectors, respectively. 

 

The composites during strong zonal flow days (Fig. 3.6, middle row) reveal a stretching of the 

high moisture content corridor from the Atlantic towards each considered sector, although in the 

case of the RUS sector, moisture income towards this area is relatively modest. These extensions 

towards each sector are on the overall quite coherent with the cyclonic signatures and the 

precipitation anomalies during zonal days previously shown (Fig. 3.3). On the other hand, 

blocking structures obstruct these moisture fluxes (Fig. 3.6, upper row), being most of the 

moisture transport deflected northwards. In the case of ATL blocks, these fluxes are diverted far 

from continental Europe and the UK, while during EUR blocks the northward deflection of the 

moisture corridor occurs over Ireland towards Scandinavia. Moisture transport anomalies during 

RUS blocks are less striking, which agrees with the fact that larger precipitation anomalies in this 

sector are confined to summer (Fig. 3.4), when moisture fluxes are reduced. For the three 



3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes 
 
 

78 
 

blocking sectors, there is also a modest transport towards lower latitudes (Mediterranean areas) 

through the southern flank of the blocking systems. In agreement with the precipitation 

differences between blocked and zonal patterns, the corresponding difference in moisture fluxes 

at the annual scale (Fig. 3.6, lower row) clearly shows that a shift from a westerly flow to 

blocked pattern results in an overall substantial decrease in moisture availability over western 

and central areas of Europe, and in a significant increase in northernmost Scandinavian areas. 

The precipitation increases in southern Europe during blocking episodes do not reflect 

significant anomalies in available moisture. Instead, for southernmost latitudes, atmospheric 

instability (depicted by the Lifted Index) appears to relate better with precipitation anomalies, as 

evidenced in the blocking minus zonal flow composites (bottom panels of Fig. 3.6). Moreover, 

these changes in LI are spatially consistent with the changes in cyclonic activity frequency, 

suggesting potential effects in the frequency of extreme precipitation days (as it will be analyzed 

in Sect. 3.5) in the regions located at the southern flank of blocking structures (i.e. in 

Mediterranean areas). Thus, moisture availability is not a major constrain to the occurrence of 

significant precipitation events in southern Europe, at least at the annual scale. On the other 

hand, the small increases in cyclonic activity in the Mediterranean area which are found during 

zonal days (Fig. 3.5) are not collocated with the positive LI changes (located further north), 

therefore supporting the weak precipitation effectiveness of low-latitude weather systems under 

zonal flows. All these facts reinforce the major role played by atmospheric instability on the 

precipitation regimes of southern Europe, and its gradual loss of importance as we move north, 

where stratiform precipitation and moisture availability tend to dominate. 

Despite cyclonic activity increases in northern Europe extend to parts of central Europe during 

ATL blocks (Fig. 3.5), the simultaneous reduction in moisture fluxes at these latitudes explains 

the decrease in precipitation that can be found in areas such as southern France, parts of central 

Europe, or even northwestern sectors of the Iberian Peninsula. In this sense, it is important to 

stress that frontal precipitation associated to extratropical cyclones tends to occur to the south of 

the cyclone center. As an example concerning the latter region, Sousa et al. (2016) noted that a 

large fraction of the precipitation that occurs in this area depends on frontal systems linked to 

cyclone centers located at higher latitudes, and whose frequency is strongly reduced during 

blocking situations. The same rationale can be applied to other regions as France and central 

parts of Europe during blocking events in the EUR sector. Thus, while at higher latitudes, the 

blocking-related decreases in precipitation are in good agreement with an obstruction of storm-

tracks and associated moisture corridors, in southern areas, the agreement between blocking-

related rainfall increases (Fig. 3.4) and above average atmospheric instability suggests a shift 

towards more extreme precipitation regimes.

to blocked patterns in the ATL (left column), EUR (central column) and RUS (right column) sectors. 

Arrows represent the mean horizontal transport of specific humidity. 

 

Overall, the seasonal composites (Fig. 3.7) resemble the annual, although a generalized 

northward shift can be noted during the warm season–in good agreement with the corresponding 

migration of the seasonal precipitation anomalies (Fig. 3.4). The pattern of enhanced 

atmospheric instability in the areas southwards of blocking systems is considerably larger in 

warmer months. During spring and summer the increase in instability is quite striking west of 

Iberia (during ATL blocks), as well as in southern France and western Mediterranean areas 

(during EUR blocks). Interestingly, during summer, an outstanding rise in atmospheric instability 

during RUS blocks covers a wide domain spanning from Turkey to Scandinavia. The fact that 

this pattern is essentially restricted to summer explains its absence at the previous annual scale 



3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes 
 
 

80 
 

analysis. In effect, during summer some continental areas display precipitation decreases under 

blocked conditions, despite significant increases in atmospheric instability. We hypothesize that 

the summer enhancement in atmospheric instability during blocked days must be insufficient to 

overwhelm the moisture inflow reduction associated with this atmospheric pattern. Thus, once 

again we find that the precipitation responses in northern areas of Europe are well explained by 

changes in moisture availability. Nevertheless, some mid-latitude continental areas show a 

seasonal shift towards wetter conditions during summer and autumn blocks, despite the overall 

reduction in moisture inflow. These regional warm season changes are concurrent with 

remarkable increases in LI and hence, the reasoning could be quite comparable to the one 

presented for southern Europe (essentially driven by atmospheric instability. In summary, this 

balance between contrasting responses in terms of moisture flows and atmospheric instability 

between northern and southern Europe is, overall, well explained by a dominant role of moisture 

fluxes in the former, and of atmospheric instability in the latter, whose influence extends further 

north into continental Europe during the warmer months. 

The atmosphere–ocean coupling must be also considered in this context. In fact, variables such 

as Sea Surface Temperature anomalies and Latent Heat Fluxes (hereafter LHF) may play a role 

on thermodynamic processes at both local scale (such as small scale convective systems), and 

synoptic scale, such as cyclone life-cycles (Grams et al., 2011). As previously shown, LI changes 

are not always associated to concurrent changes in atmospheric circulation (e.g. cyclones), and 

hence, the underlying processes behind these LI changes (particularly important in southern 

areas) should be explored. Thus, we have analyzed changes in LHF during blocked and zonal 

patterns, as presented in Fig. 3.8.  

As it can be observed in the top panel of Fig. 3.8, the highest mean values of LHF (at the 

annual scale) are observed over the equatorial areas and the Gulf Stream in the Western Atlantic. 

These areas with high rates of oceanic evaporation are the main large-scale sources of moisture 

content originated in the Atlantic which are carried towards Europe by typical westerly flows 

(Gimeno et al., 2013). Other regions, such as the Mediterranean area, may also be important 

sources of moisture for regional precipitation throughout evaporative processes (Gimeno et al., 

2010, 2012). Subsequently, we analyzed LHF anomalies during blocked or zonal synoptic 

patterns, as changes in evaporative rates should not be disconnected from the thermodynamic 

processes related with precipitation (particularly convection). 

As shown in Fig. 3.8, strong zonal flows are related to above average LHF at higher latitudes, 

particularly notable in the vicinity of the UK during ATL events, but also in the North Sea and 

Baltic Sea during EUR and RUS zonal flow episodes, respectively. On the contrary, at lower 

latitudes, these zonal regimes result in below average LHF. During blocked conditions, there is 

an overall opposite response in terms of LHF anomalies. For example, during ATL blocks, a 

large area surrounding Iberia shows higher values of LHF (with maximum expression in the Gulf 

of Biscay). During EUR blocks this pattern shifts eastwards towards the eastern Mediterranean 

(particularly in the Aegian Sea), while during RUS blocks positive anomalies are restricted to the 

Black Sea.

Fig. 3.8 Top: annual mean latent heat flux (counted in 2.5° × 2.5° boxes). Middle: row annual mean 

changes (in W/m2) in the latent heat fluxes during blocking episodes in the ATL (middle left), EUR 

(middle center) and RUS (middle right) sectors. Bottom: row annual mean changes (in W/m2) in 

latent heat fluxes during strong zonal flow episodes in the ATL (bottom left), EUR (bottom middle) 

and RUS (bottom right) sectors. Increases are shown with red shading (solid white lines) and 

decreases with blue shading (dotted white lines). 

 

This pattern of above average LHF in the southern flank of blocking systems may reflect 

enhanced evaporative processes under the advection of cooler air from higher latitudes due to the 

easterly/northeasterly synoptic flow. On the other hand, strong westerly flows extending to the 

surface level may explain the increased LHF at higher latitudes during zonal regimes. Note that 

the regions of increased LHF during blocked conditions do not display concurrent changes in 

atmospheric circulation, but they agree with the regions experiencing increased precipitation. In 

this context, positive LHF anomalies could help explain thermodynamic processes which 

regionally enhance atmospheric instability in southern areas of Europe during blocking episodes. 

Taking the Iberian Peninsula as an example, in Fig. 3.14 of the Supplementary Material we 

present the forward trajectories of air parcels (at different altitudes) originated in areas where the 

maximum LHF anomaly was found (e.g., the Gulf of Biscay) for a subset of days under ATL 

blocking. This pattern favors the transport and elevation of air parcels (originally at lower levels 

in the region with above normal evaporation) towards Iberia, thus possibly establishing a positive

feedback process between evaporative and convective processes, and contributing, at least 

partially, to the observed rainfall increases in the region.  

 

3.1.5 Shifts in precipitation distributions 

In the previous sections we analyzed net precipitation changes in Europe associated to distinct 

atmospheric circulation patterns. Still, it is important to understand the underlying shifts in 

different precipitation regimes (or intensities), which can be addressed looking at precipitation 

distributions, or commonly designated PDF changes. In this section we perform a comprehensive 

assessment of modifications in precipitation distributions in some representative areas (identified 

in the boxes in Fig. 3.1) following a similar scheme as the one presented in Soares et al. (2014), 

and consisting in the next steps: 

(i) For each box presented in Fig. 3.1, we pooled together all the gridpoints, and then 

computed frequency histograms for wet days (days with rainfall above 1 mm) for 1 mm 

bins, without distinguishing weather regimes (HISTALL);  

(ii) The frequency of each of these bins has been multiplied by its precipitation value, in 

order to obtain its relative contribution to the total precipitation climatology 

(CONTALL) of each box; 

(iii) The previous procedure was also applied to wet days under each specific weather 

regime and for each sector (thus obtaining CONTBLOCK and CONTZONAL); 

(iv) The difference between the bin contributions under each weather regime and the 

corresponding all-days bin was then computed, in order to obtain the relative change in 

the contribution of different daily precipitation intensities to the total precipitation 

anomaly ascribed to the specific weather regime, according to: 

 

 

(??????????? )  =
?????????

 ????????
 

??????????
      (1) 

 

(??????????? )  =
?????????

 ????????
 

??????????
      (2) 

 

The computation described in Eqs. (1) and (2) has been performed for all three sectors 

considered previously (ATL, EUR and RUS), and NDAYS represents the number of wet days 

occurring in each of these specific weather regimes. 

Since the sample sizes for each specific weather regime and for each sector are different (and 

much smaller than the all-days sample size) we have applied a bootstrapping technique to enable 

a fair comparison between them. To achieve this, the method estimates random subsamples of 

days with the same size as that of the specific weather regime. Thus, for a given weather regime 

having NDAYS as sample size, we randomly selected NDAYS from the complete series and 

obtained the corresponding histogram, to perform an unbiased comparison. This random process 



3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes 
 
 

83 
 

was repeated 1000 times, and the average of the resulting histograms was taken as the final 

HISTALL. 

The precipitation distributions of the four selected European regions and their shifts associated 

with the occurrence of blocking and strong westerly flows over each sector are shown in Figs. 

3.9, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12. In these figures, the upper panel shows the histogram of daily 

precipitation for all wet days (above 1 mm, HISTALL) and the black curves show the contribution 

of each bin to the total precipitation (CONTALL), thus highlighting the daily intensities that are 

more relevant to the total rainfall of each specific region. The middle panels show the relative 

changes for each bin under each specific weather regime (CHANGEBlock and CHANGEZonal, 

distinguishing between the three sectors considered), in order to compare the impacts that each 

atmospheric pattern promotes in different precipitation intensities. Finally, the lower panels show 

the cumulative relative changes from the previous panels, with the impacts of each considered 

weather pattern on the total precipitation distribution of the considered location. Please note the 

different y-axis scales in Figs. 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12.

patterns. Top: relative frequency of days with precipitation totals considering 1 mm bins (grey bars) 

and the corresponding contribution of each bin to the total annual precipitation (solid black line). 

Middle: relative change in the contribution of each bin to the total annual precipitation for blocked 

(solid lines) and zonal (dashed lines) patterns in the three considered sectors (colored lines). Bottom: 

cumulative change resulting from the relative changes in the precipitation distribution associated to

3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes 
 
 

84 
 

 

This approach enables a deeper assessment of the contrasting anomalies found in the 

precipitation composites (Figs. 3.3, 3.4) for areas such as the UK (Fig. 3.9) or the Iberian 

Peninsula (Fig. 3.10). As stated before, ATL and EUR blocked patterns reduce daily 

precipitation rates in the UK and foster them on most of the Iberian Peninsula, while the opposite 

result is found for strong zonal flow days. The analysis of Fig. 3.9 provides a more detailed view 

of these differences, as it clarifies that blocked patterns in the ATL sector drastically reduce the 

number of moderate rainfall days in the UK region (below the 90th percentile), and increase the 

frequency of low precipitation days, as compared to the climatology. The latter have a relatively 

minor contribution for the precipitation totals, while the former impinge a very large impact on 

the accumulated relative changes of the precipitation distribution (Fig. 3.9, lower panel), with the 

total effect being a reduction of 40 % in annual precipitation. On the contrary, strong zonal 

patterns (particularly in the ATL and EUR sectors) induce an increase of the highly-contributing 

precipitation bins (those near the median of the distribution), resulting in positive cumulative 

changes, in clear agreement with the composites of the previous section. Thus, ATL patterns are 

the most efficient in triggering shifts in precipitation distributions in the UK. 

 

On the other hand, the differences in Iberian precipitation (Fig. 3.3) during blocked (zonal) 

days in the ATL and EUR sectors are associated to an increase (decrease) in days with 

precipitation amounts above the 50th percentile (Fig. 3.10). Contrarily to the UK, where blocked 

and zonal flows have minor impacts on the occurrence of extreme precipitating events, in the 

Iberian Peninsula ATL and mainly EUR blocks are associated with a substantial shift in extreme 

events (Fig. 3.10, middle panel), which largely influences the annual total differences in 

precipitation (Fig. 3.10, lower panel). This is a strong evidence of the impact that blocked 

patterns have on the occurrence of intense to extreme precipitation days in this area, which are 

essentially driven by atmospheric instability, as referred in Sect. 3.4. These results help 

distinguish the utterly different precipitation regimes, and the underlying processes, that 

dominate annual rainfall totals at different European latitudes. Still, we must bear in mind the 

existence of large gradients in precipitation regimes that characterize some areas (particularly in 

southern Europe). Such different responses across regions and seasons, result in a smoothed 

signal in the annual balance for the entire region. In the particular case of the Iberian Peninsula, 

different local responses from the overall region’s signals are found in northwestern areas during 

the wet season (Sousa et al., 2016), as shown in Fig. 3.15 and 3.16 of the Supplementary 

Material. 



3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes

Fig. 3.10 Same as Fig. 3.9, but for the Iberian Peninsula. 

 

The contrasting results between the UK and Iberian Peninsula shifts in the precipitation 

distributions are similar to those found between central/northern Europe against the central 

Mediterranean areas, the main difference residing on the zonal (blocking) sector with most 

important differences, which in the latter cases correspond to the EUR sector. Thus, zonal 

(blocked) conditions relate to an overall increase (decrease) in the number of moderate rainfall 

days (largest differences around 5 mm/day rates) in most of central/northern Europe, while the 

opposite response is found at lower latitudes, where differences are more associated to the higher 

percentiles of daily precipitation intensity. Taking into account the similarity with the previous 

cases, we opted to remit the corresponding figures (3.17 and 3.18) to the Supplementary 

Material. 

We also explored the shifts in the seasonal distributions. Overall, the results indicate a 

latitudinal dependent behavior. Northern regions of Europe exhibit qualitatively coherent 

responses to weather systems through the year, although the cumulative changes can display 

seasonal variations, following the seasonal cycle of precipitation and the factors that cause 

precipitation anomalies therein (cyclonic activity and moisture availability). As an example, we 

decided to present the differences in the summer precipitation distribution of the Russian box to 

emphasize the huge impact that summer blocking episodes exert on the climate of this region 

(Fig. 3.11). As in other northern/central European areas, the positive (negative) cumulative

changes that arise from zonal (blocked) flows over this region are strongly influenced by 

variations in the number of moderate rainfall days. 

 

 

Fig. 3.11 Same as the previous, but for Russia, and considering only summer days. 

 

On the other hand, the shifts in the precipitation distribution of southern European areas are 

more likely to be seasonal dependent, as the seasonal cycle in precipitation is larger and the 

relative contribution of extreme precipitation to the annual total is more important than in 

northern Europe. Figure 3.12 shows the PDF changes at the annual scale for Turkey. Significant 

differences occur in a wide range of percentiles, including the highest ones (above the 95th). 

However, there are clearly contrasting responses between winter and summer weather patterns 

(see Figs. 3.19 and 3.20 from the Supplementary material. There is not a clear opposite response 

to zonal or blocked flows, nor a coherent signal through the year. This fact suggests an important 

heterogeneity in precipitation regimes at both intra-annual and spatial scales in the region, when 

compared to other European areas, and in particular with other Mediterranean sectors (Sousa et 

al., 2011). The fact that some other European areas do not show significant differences in the 

annual mean precipitation responses to blocked/zonal may be due to the co-existence of similar 

contrasting signals, either in different seasons, or at different precipitation intensities of the 

distribution.

In summary, the presented cases denote that precipitation regimes in southern Europe are more 

dependent (than those at higher latitudes) of shifts in the higher percentiles of the daily rainfall 

intensity. In addition, heterogeneities at both spatial and temporal scales are also much more 

important than in northern Europe, where distributions tend to be qualitatively similar throughout 

the year. Consequently, in northern regions, annual analyses of the precipitation distribution 

shifts are generally sufficient to examine the distinct impacts of blocked and zonal episodes, as 

the shifts in highly-contributing moderate rainfall days prevail in these regions throughout the 

year. 

 

3.1.6 Discussion and conclusions 

We have performed a pan-European analysis on the impacts of blocking episodes and strong 

zonal flows on European precipitation regimes and the physical mechanisms associated. Unlike 

previous studies, we have described the impact in annual and seasonal precipitation, thus 

including seasons other than winter, which has been the focus of previous assessments. We first 

analyzed composites for precipitation anomalies, and afterwards, the precipitation distribution 

shifts over major regional domains, considering in all cases the effects of large scale circulation 

anomalies over three different areas of occurrence (mid-Atlantic, Europe and Russia).

Overall, the results indicate significant opposite precipitation responses to blocking occurrence 

between northern and southern regions of the continent. Positive net changes are found in 

southernmost areas, while negative net changes occur in most central and northern regions of 

Europe - exception made for the Atlantic strip of Scandinavia where variations in precipitation 

present the same signal response as in southern Europe. The location of the largest precipitation 

anomalies follows well the positioning of the blocking centers, migrating eastward as we move 

from the Atlantic to the Russian sector. On the other hand, during strong westerly flows, the 

anomalies of this north–south dipole are reversed, resulting in precipitation gains (decreases) at 

higher (lower) latitudes. In the areas under direct blocking influence, the substantial decrease in 

precipitation rates (reaching in some cases around 75 %) extends throughout the year, including 

areas where annual rainfall totals depend more on warm season’s precipitation. In particular, the 

dramatic decrease in Russian precipitation during spring and summer blocking episodes gains 

particular relevance under the scope of recent noticeable events, such as the mega-heatwave of 

2010 (Barriopedro et al., 2011). Our results reinforce the potentially outstanding impact of 

prolonged blocking episodes occurring over continental areas in terms of water availability (e.g., 

the role of Russian blocks on the complex feedback processes between pre-conditioning soil 

moisture deficits and summer heatwaves enhancement, Miralles et al., 2014; García-Herrera et 

al., 2010). 

The presence of blocking systems results in a bifurcation of storm-tracks north and south of 

their usual paths, as already described by Trigo et al. (2004) or Walter and Graf (2005). In large 

parts of central and northern Europe, where frontal systems associated to synoptic-scale 

disturbances usually prevail, these storm-track shifts are responsible for the previously referred 

rainfall deficit due to the subsequent significant decreases in cyclone frequencies and moisture 

transport. Contrariwise, during days characterized by strong zonal flow, our results demonstrate 

an increase in cyclonic activity and moisture transport towards northern and central Europe, 

concurring with a rise in rainfall totals, associated to a stronger than usual Jetstream. In 

agreement with this main driver of precipitation anomalies in northern and central Europe, the 

strongest effects are observed under the occurrence of circulation anomalies centered in the 

Atlantic and European sectors, which exert a major influence on the storm-tracks and moisture 

advection inland. 

On the other hand, in southern Europe, the branch of storm-tracks deflected southwards due to 

blocking occurrence is responsible for above average cyclonic activity. Again, this effect is 

particularly relevant for blocking centers located in the Atlantic sector, resulting in twice as 

much cyclonic activity in the Iberian Peninsula area. Although not so striking, increases in 

cyclone frequency extend throughout many Mediterranean areas for other blocking locations. 

Quite the opposite, rainfall deficits in southern Europe are found for strong westerly flows, 

particularly in western and central Mediterranean areas. 

While the rainfall increases over southern Europe during blocking agree with cyclonic activity 

anomalies, we have shown that they are better explained by increases in atmospheric instability, 

which are particularly notable in the southern flank of blocking systems. This process is not 

particularly dependent of high moisture contents, as our analysis shows that these blocking-

89 
 

related rainfall increases are concurrent with below average moisture influxes towards Europe. 

This emphasizes the more convective nature of precipitation regimes of southern European 

countries, when compared to a much more relevant contribution of frontal/stratiform systems at 

higher latitudes. These results lead us to perform a more regionalized assessment of precipitation 

changes and to highlight the meridional variation in precipitation responses and associated 

mechanisms. In this regard, we went further than previous studies by analyzing changes in the 

seasonal and annual precipitation distributions for a number of boxes in northern and southern 

Europe, during blocked and zonal regimes. 

We show that the overall negative net changes in precipitation in most sectors of 

central/northern Europe are essentially driven by the substantial drop in the mid-percentiles of 

the distribution (i.e., moderate rainfall days), which strongly contribute to the cumulative totals. 

Inversely, during days characterized by intense zonal flow, an increase in the mid-percentiles of 

daily precipitation rates highlights the vital role of synoptic-scale frontal systems and their 

association to a stronger Jetstream and the Atlantic moisture inflow. In contrast, in southern 

European areas, the increases in precipitation rates during blocking episodes are mostly related 

with increases in the mid to high percentiles of the precipitation distribution, in some cases 

particularly striking above the 90th and 95th percentiles. This clearly shows an increase in the 

probability of heavy to extreme precipitation days during blocked patterns, confirming the role of 

convective processes in the blocking-related precipitation anomalies of southern Europe. Given 

the significant contribution of heavy precipitation days to annual totals in this region, our results 

highlight an outstanding role of blocked patterns on the inter-annual variability of southern 

European rainfall regimes. 

In most areas, the synoptic patterns and precipitation responses are quite coherent throughout 

the year. However, the involved mechanisms differ in magnitude and spatial extent from season 

to season and affected areas. In particular, blocking occurrence and the associated increase in 

atmospheric instability (and consequently in convective processes) to the south/southeast of 

blocking centers shift northward during summer, and as a consequence, positive precipitation 

anomalies also extend further north than during other seasons. Besides, we have also verified that 

while precipitation responses during blocked/zonal regimes are spatially coherent in central and 

northern Europe, the responses in southern regions are more complex. In this area, opposite 

responses within relatively small domains (and/or between different seasons) can be masked on 

the annual analysis (e.g. Iberia and Turkey). 

Finally, we discussed how processes such as latent-heat-fluxes may be determinant to both 

cyclogenesis and local feedback processes. In fact, blocked atmospheric patterns are associated 

with above average evaporation in specific sectors, which may enhance atmospheric instability 

and/or provide a local moisture source for precipitation. In this context, parcel tracing and other 

ocean–atmosphere processes should be analyzed in more depth for a deeper assessment of local-

scale processes, which may be particularly relevant in southern European areas.

3.2 Dry fingerprint of ridge patterns in southern Europe 

As discussed in Section 3.2, dry episodes are recurrent in southern European areas, particularly 

in the Mediterranean. In Section 3.3, we demonstrated that the variability in rainfall regimes and 

particularly heavy precipitation events in southern Europe are closely related to the occurrence of 

high-latitude blocking. On the other hand, precipitation deficits in this area are related to 

anomalous high pressure systems at lower latitudes (e.g. Xoplaki et al., 2004). Santos et al. 

(2009) already associated very dry winters in Portugal to the occurrence of persistent sub-

tropical ridge episodes in the eastern Atlantic, which reduce the number of frontal systems in the 

vicinity of northwestern Iberia, thus resulting in well below average rainfall during the wet 

season.  

Taking this into account, and making use of the developed catalogue of sub-tropical ridges, we 

also explored the impacts on European precipitation during ridges in the ATL, EUR and RUS 

sectors. The composites for the seasonal precipitation relative anomalies (in %) are shown in Fig. 

3.21.

(left column), EUR (central column) and RUS (right column) sector. Only statistically significant 

anomalies at the 5 % level are shown (two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). 

 

Similar to the temperature anomalies (particularly during winter) presented in Chapter 2, the 

precipitation changes during ridge days are essentially opposite to those found for blocking days 

(Fig. 3.4). Consequently, ridge patterns are associated to well below average precipitation in 

most of southern areas, where the maximum geopotential height anomalies of the ridge structure 

are located (see Fig. 2.2). The exception can be found during RUS ridges, which are located 

sufficiently to the east to still allow the penetration of Atlantic frontal systems towards the 

Mediterranean area. It should be noted the similarities of the ridge signals in precipitation 

(particularly in winter and for central and northern Europe) with the corresponding patterns 

obtained for the zonal flows as shown in Fig. 3.22. 

 



3. Blocking impacts on European precipitation regimes 
 
 

97 
 

 

Fig. 3.22 Same as Fig. 3.21, but for strong zonal flows. 

 

Interestingly, ridges promote the lack of rainfall over some areas. For example, most of Iberia 

is completely dry during ATL ridges. The same is true in southern Italy and most of the Balkans 

area during EUR ridges. The precipitation responses to ridges are quite coherent throughout the 

year, although during summer the dry fingerprint of subtropical ridges extends further north, 

reaching central Europe and even the UK (particularly during spring and summer ATL ridges).  

Contrarily, central and northern areas of Europe are, on the overall, much wetter during ridge 

occurrence. During winter ATL ridges the Alpine region receives about 150% of the usual 

rainfall. Indeed, this natural barrier marks a clear separation in the north-south dipole of the 

precipitation responses to ridges. These increases northwards of the ridge location agree with an 

enhanced zonal flow at higher latitudes, thus corroborating the similar composites found in Figs. 

3.21 and 3.22. These patterns are not detached at all, as a ridge structure and its corresponding

positive Z500 anomaly at low latitudes sharpens the north-south pressure gradient, thus favoring 

above average zonal flow. 

In this sense, while blocking events are related to precipitation scarceness in the northern half 

of Europe, ridges are a key driver of precipitation deficits in the southern half, and particularly 

on the Mediterranean. This fact gains relevance in climates where water availability depends a 

lot on winter rainfall totals, being winter ridges a major drawback for annual precipitation totals.  

 

3.3 Impacts on European snow-cover  

Snow cover represents an important contributor to soil moisture in mid-to-high latitudes and 

mountainous regions. While accumulations at higher elevations (e.g. the Alps - Beniston, 2012) 

depend mostly on the amount of precipitation, at lower altitudes, where snowfall is scarcer, 

temperature anomalies will tend to dominate the anomalous snowfall patterns (Henderson and 

Leathers, 2009). As shown previously in Chapter 2, blocking events are often associated with 

significant cold spells in the European continent. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that blocking 

patterns will also play a significant role on the anomalous snowfall regimes of Europe (e.g., 

García-Herrera and Barriopedro, 2006).  

In this section, the associated impacts on snow cover are explored by using the Global Snow 

Lab from the Rutgers University Climate Lab (RUCL) dataset (Robinson et al., 2012), covering 

the 1974-2012 period. The climatological frequency of winter days with snow covered soil is 

presented in Fig. 3.23, while the correlation between the anomalies of snow covered soil days 

and blocking/ridges frequency during winter for the three main 30º width sectors of the Euro-

Atlantic region is represented in Fig. 3.24.

period.

Fig. 3.24 Winter Pearson correlation coefficients (in percentage) between the frequency anomalies 

of snow covered soil and blocking (upper panels) and ridge (lower panels) occurrence in the three 

longitudinal sectors: ATL, EUR and RUS. Only statistically significant correlations (at the 5% level) 

are shown. 

  

The upper panel of Fig. 3.24 shows that ATL blocks are associated with higher than average 

snow cover days throughout most of Europe. As illustrated previously in Section 2.3, this pattern 

is related with significant cold advection of polar air masses towards the south of Europe (Fig. 

2.5). Such conditions lead to increases up to 50% in days with snow cover in central Europe, 

despite the concurrent decreases in precipitation (Fig. 3.4), meaning that a larger fraction of the 

precipitation occurs in the form of snow. The impacts even extend over large parts of Iberia, Italy 

and the Balkans. During EUR and RUS blocks, the anomalies are less significant, and located 

further east, in areas where snowfall days represent winter standard conditions (Fig. 3.23), thus 

being their frequency just slightly enhanced by blocking action.  

An almost completely opposite correlation is found for ATL and EUR ridges, resulting in 

much less days with snow cover in central Europe and the UK (lower panel in Fig. 3.24). This 

result is anticipated, as ATL and EUR ridges are related to significantly warmer temperatures in 

most regions (see Section 2.1). As a result, although precipitation totals are enhanced during 

these regimes, snowfall becomes scarcer. Furthermore, the associated positive temperature 

anomalies (in the order of 5-10ºC) contribute to enhanced snow melting. Interestingly, during 

ATL (EUR) ridges some Mediterranean areas, such as Italy (Turkey), present slightly increased 

snow cover days, as some colder air masses plunge southwards in the eastern flank of the ridge 

structures. During RUS ridges some appreciable increases can be found in western and central 

Europe, although not comparable in magnitude to those occurring during ATL blocks. As shown 

in Fig. 2.2, ridges located in easternmost areas of Europe allow an atmospheric pattern 

characterized by slightly increased northerly flow and below average Z500 in western Europe.

Summary 
 

Conte xt and obje ctive s  
As illustrate d in Chapters 2 and 3, there is a significant contribution of blocking (ridges) for 
cold (warm) and wet (dry) spells in the Mediterranean region. This chapter will focus on Iberia n 
precipitation and temperature responses to blocking and ridge patterns occurring in the ATL 
and EUR sectors, as these regional systems wield the largest impacts on the Iberian climate. To 
perform this finer scale regional analysis, it was necessary to employ high-resolu t ion 
precipitation and temperature datasets. A thorough assessment of the high-resolu t ion 
precipitation responses to blocking in Iberia, which includes a comprehensive Extreme Value  
Analysis can be found in Section 4.1 (as publishe d in Sousa et al., 2016). Additiona l results on 
the rainfall signatures during ridge patterns are described in Section 4.2, while Section 4.3 is  
devoted to regional temperature responses in Iberia under blocking and ridge patterns.  
 
Me thods  
We use the IBERIA02 (precipitation) and SPAIN02 (temperature) datasets, at 0.2º x 0.2º 
horizonta l resolution, and analyze the corresponding anomalies for each atmospheric pattern in 
each sector. Integrated Vapor Transport, the instability, as measured by the Lifted Index, 
cyclones and cut-off lows catalogues are used to characterize the synoptic environme n t.  
Changes in Probability Density Functions and an Extreme Value Analysis are performed to 
explore the relationships between blocking occurrence and precipitation regimes, includ ing 
extreme rainfall events in different regions of the Iberian Peninsula. 
 
Re s ults  
Similarly to other Mediterranean areas, blocking is associated with increased precipitation in 
most of Iberia, except in the northwestern tip of the Peninsula. Despite the large-scale reductions  
in moisture availability, the generalized rainfall increases are well explained by enhance d 
atmospheric instability, partially driven by a southward deviation of the storm-track and 
increases in cut-off lows. These changes are not concurrent with increases in the number of 
precipitation days, thus highlighting the heavier behavior of precipitation regimes during 
blocking, which is particularly notable on the eastern shores of Iberia. Conversely, strong zona l 
flows, and especially sub-tropical ridges in the Euro-Atlantic sector result in more stable  
conditions and precipitation scarceness in Iberia (except in the northernmost regions).  
An opposite response to blocks and ridges is also found in temperature, with blocking events  
favoring cold days in most areas (with temperature anomalies below -3ºC in winter), along with 
increased cloudiness and wetter than average conditions. On the contrary, dryer and sunnie r 
weather conditions associated with ridges enhance sensible and short-wave radiative heating, 
thus promoting above average temperatures during both winter and summer. The specific  
location of the ridge is determinant for regional extreme summer temperature events, with 
subtropical ridges over Iberia triggering the largest anomalies in maximum temperature.

In this work we reassess the impacts of blocking patterns on precipitation regimes in the Iberian 
Peninsula, distinguishing between north Atlantic and European blocking. For this we take full 
advantage of the recently developed high-resolution datasets for the Iberian countries. 
Precipitation anomalies during blocking events obtained with this dataset allow a much finer 
regional characterization of the impacts on both average and extreme daily precipitat io n, 
particularly when compared to widely used low-resolution reanalysis datasets. Blocked patterns 
induce a negative-positive dipole of precipitation anomalies from northwest to southeast Iberia. 
Increases are widespread during Atlantic blocks and pronounced in southern and eastern areas of 
Iberia, while during European blocks they are more spatially restricted, with increases above 50 % 
in coastal Mediterranean areas, which represents a considerable fraction of the annual 
precipitation. Blocking impacts on precipitation are nearly opposite to those found during strong 
zonal flow situations, but there are also some asymmetries in the precipitation responses. A 
significant increase in cyclones and cut-off lows frequency southwards of blocking structures is 
related to precipitation excesses over southern and eastern areas, where dynamical factors and local 
processes play a crucial role. On the contrary, precipitation deficits in northwest Iberia during 
blocking episodes are better explained by a reduction in north Atlantic frontal activity and 
simultaneous decreases in large-scale moisture advection towards northern Iberia. We show that 
these anomalies during blocking result from changes in precipitation amount rather than from 
increases in rainy days, pointing to more extreme rainfall regimes, particularly in southeastern 
Iberia. Finally, an Extreme Value Analysis was performed, fitting Generalized Pareto Distribut io ns 
to precipitation extremes. Results show that the different extreme precipitation regimes of 
northwest and Mediterranean regions are partially determined by opposite anomalies of the zonal 
flow. Thus, heavy precipitation events in Mediterranean areas are usually short-lived and 
frequently associated with blocking conditions, while in northwest Iberia the total accumulat io ns 
during rainfall episodes are more important for triggering extreme events and they are mainly 
related to strong westerly flows.

4.1.1 Introduction 

The climate of Europe is controlled to a large extent by the usual sequence of low-pressure 
systems travelling from the west and associated with the jet stream. These mid-latitude cyclones 
leave their fingerprint on spells of varying precipitation amount, alternating with dry periods that 
range from weekly to monthly scales. With the advent of upper level observations in the wake of 
the WWII, it was found that this pattern of predominantly zonal circulation is often disrupted by a 
temporary change to a situation of strong meridional flow (e.g., Rex, 1950a, b). This meridio na l 
component favors the formation of quasi-stationary anticyclones at high latitudes, coined as 
blocking highs (Rex, 1950a, b), which are often accompanied by low-pressure areas at lower 
latitudes (Treidl et al., 1981). 

The influence of blocking systems on the climate of mid latitudes is well known. The first climate 
assessments of the impact of blocking were based on very few cases (e.g., Rex, 1951), or on 
particular anomalous seasons (e.g., Quiroz, 1984). More recently, the longer reanalysis datasets 
have been used to characterize blocking (e.g., Barriopedro et al., 2006, 2010a; Croci-Maspoli et 
al., 2007; Davini et al., 2012a) and their associated impacts (e.g., Trigo et al., 2004; Masato et al., 
2011), including extreme events (e.g., Sillmann and Croci-Maspoli, 2009; Buehler et al., 2011), 
such as the drought events in the Iberian Peninsula (IP) during 2004–2005 (García-Herrera et al., 
2007) and 2011–2012 (Trigo et al., 2013a), or the more recent outstanding heatwaves in the Euro-
Russian area (Barriopedro et al., 2011; Ruti et al., 2014). The specific role of atmospheric blocking 
on precipitation regimes has been widely studied, although there is some tendency to focus on the 
climate of the area more directly affected by the anomalous stationary ridge. In this restricted 
spatial context, blocking occurrence causes precipitation scarceness. Nevertheless, blocking 
episodes may also increase precipitation in remote regions, since storm tracks tend to be deflected 
north and south of the blocking systems. Trigo et al. (2004) found that blocking episodes in the 
Euro-Atlantic sector reduce the precipitation rate at higher latitudes, and increase it in 
southernmost areas of Europe. In addition, blocking can be favorable for strangling upper level 
cold air pools (usually referred as cutoff lows), which may produce severe weather and flooding 
(Nieto et al., 2007). Cut-off lows are more frequent in spring and summer seasons, and in mid and 
low latitudes, with the European sector being a preferred sector of occurrence. In particular, Nieto 
et al. (2007) has shown that the southern flank of blocking systems is a favorable location for cut-
off occurrence. This is crucial for the climate of the IP, where some of the most torrential rainfa ll 
episodes can arise from relatively small-scaled low-pressure systems. Some examples of cut-off 
low systems occurring under large-scale blocked conditions are the exceptional rainfall event in 
the Lisbon area in 18 February 2008 (Fragoso et al., 2010), or the October 2000 torrential 
precipitation event in eastern Spain (Homar et al., 2002). In addition, and particularly during late 
summer and early autumn, cut-off lows can trigger Mesoscale Convective Systems affecting the 
eastern coast of Spain and the Balearic Islands (García-Herrera et al., 2005a).  

Within the context of blocking-related impacts, it is imperative to distinguish the disruption of 
the prevailing westerly circumpolar flow by a blocking episode from the strengthening of the North 
Atlantic ridge at lower latitudes (40°N–50°N—sometimes called low-latitude blocking), which is 
frequently linked with sub-tropical high pressure systems. Santos et al. (2008, 2009) have studied

the latter, and linked such events with the occurrence of severe droughts in the IP, particularly in 
the western half, since these patterns prevent storms from reaching that region. On the contrary, 
closed and persistent blocking systems located at higher latitudes leave a margin for the occurrence 
of synoptic eddies at lower latitudes (e.g., Pfahl, 2014). More specifically, the blocking pattern 
induces a shift of the usual storm-track paths that can interact with the sub-tropical jet stream, 
enhancing large-scale ascending motions, instability and the development of severe precipitat io n 
events (Toreti et al., 2010). Thus, unlike strong ridges, which tend to deprive the IP of rains, 
blocking episodes can promote either dry periods or wet spells therein, depending on the location 
of the blocking pattern.  

The strong spatial and temporal variability of precipitation regimes in the IP, with the relative ly 
high frequency of blocking patterns (Barriopedro et al., 2006; Woollings et al., 2010a) and cut-
off-lows (Nieto et al., 2007) in western Europe converts the IP in an excellent “laboratory” to 
evaluate the impacts of blocking episodes. However, blocking induced low pressure systems may 
produce very distinct signatures in precipitation at the regional scale. This underlines the need of 
high-resolution precipitation datasets to obtain a more comprehensive assessment on the impacts 
of blocking episodes on the IP precipitation regimes. Previous studies have used gridded 
precipitation datasets with poor spatial horizontal resolutions to address blocking effects on 
precipitation (e.g., Trigo et al., 2004), thus possibly losing crucial spatial details. Additiona l ly, 
Trigo et al. (2004) found that the blocking signals in precipitation are relatively unconnected from 
those in precipitable water, which are rather controlled by blocking- induced temperature 
anomalies. This fact suggests that the precipitation anomalies in IP during blocking situations are 
mainly driven by dynamical factors, such as higher-than- usual cyclonic activity, albeit the 
importance of thermodynamic factors in the precipitation responses to blocking cannot be 
disregarded. This fact stresses the need to explore the blocking influence on cyclone paths, and 
cut-off lows in the region.  

In this study we perform a reassessment of blocking impacts on precipitation using the recently 
developed Iberian high-resolution gridded precipitation datasets (Belo-Pereira et al., 2011; Herrera 
et al., 2012). Moreover, we assess in detail how precipitation anomalies and associated 
atmospheric circulation change with respect to the specific location of the blocking high patterns. 
This spatial dependence may be crucial to determine the local impacts and extremeness of 
precipitating systems like cyclones and cutoff lows. Finally, we also explore the relations hip 
between blocking and the occurrence of extreme precipitation. In summary, the main objectives 
of this work are: (1) to examine blocking impacts, in terms of precipitation anomalies and physical 
forcings (instability and moisture fluxes), distinguishing the sector of blocking occurrence; (2) to 
identify changes in cyclonic activity and cut-off lows frequency during blocking episodes; (3) to 
perform an Extreme Values Analysis for Iberian precipitation during blocking episodes.  

This work is structured as follows. In Sect. 4.1.2, the data used in this work is described, and a 
brief overview of the blocking climatology in the target domain is presented. In Sect. 4.1.3, we 
analyze the impacts of different weather patterns (namely blocked and strong zonal flow) on the 
precipitation regimes, and compare them when using datasets of different spatial resolution. The 
synoptic patterns and forcings that promote these impacts are described in Sect. 4.1.4. An Extreme

Value Analysis is performed in Sect. 4.1.5, and finally, in Sect. 4.1.6, the main results of this work 
are discussed.  

 

4.1.2 Data 
 
Reanalysis data 

We have used the following datasets for the purposes of our analysis: 

(a) The recently developed high-resolution precipitation datasets for Portugal (PT02 - Belo-
Pereira et al., 2011), and Spain (SPAIN02 - Herrera et al., 2012), which have a horizonta l 
resolution of 0.2° × 0.2° and have been combined in a single dataset (IBERIA02) for the years 
spanning from 1950 until 2007. The average number of stations used by both datasets is very large 
(although not constant during the period), allowing its application for both climatological studies 
(e.g., Ramos et al. 2014), and characterization of extreme precipitation events (Ramos et al., 2015). 

(b) The dataset from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis (Kalnay et al., 1996) for the 1948–2007 period, 
at a 2.5° × 2.5° horizontal resolution. The variables explicitly considered were: daily fields of 500 
hPa geopotential height (Z500) and Lifted Index (LI) - the latter is an instability index defined by 
the temperature difference between an air parcel lifted adiabatically and the temperature of the 
environment at Z500. Furthermore, we made use of several fields from the NCEP/NCAR data to 
compute the following data: (1) a catalogue of blocking events (Barriopedro et al., 2006); (2) a 
catalogue of cut-off lows (COL - Nieto et al., 2005); (3) Integrated Water Vapor Transport between 
1000 and 300 hPa (IVT- Ramos et al., 2015); (4) a catalogue of cyclones for the northern 
hemisphere obtained by using the methodology described in Trigo (2006a). These datasets will be 
employed to explore the blocking signatures in precipitation regimes and interpret these responses 
in terms of dynamical (cyclones, COLs) and thermodynamical (IVT, LI) processes. The particular 
characteristics of the blocking catalogue are explored in more detail in the following sub-section. 
 

Blocking index catalogue 

The catalogue of blocked days was developed by Barriopedro et al. (2006) by using daily Z500 
data on a 2.5° × 2.5° grid. It is an adapted version of the Tibaldi and Molteni (1990) index. 
Blocking events can be identified when the averaged zonal index, computed as the 500-hPa height 
difference between 40° and 60°N, is negative over 30° in longitude and during five or more days. 
To exclude spurious blocks due to the occurrence of cut-off lows, an additional negative height 
gradient northward of 60°N is demanded. A blocking event is detected when at least three 
consecutive longitudes appeared as blocked during at least five days. Two Z500 gradients (GHGN 
and GHGS) have been simultaneously computed for each longitude and for each day of study over 
the North Hemisphere:

where Z(?,?) is the Z500 at a given latitude and longitude. GHGS is proportional to the zonal 
geostrophic wind component and provides a measure of the zonal flow intensity for each longit ude, 
while GHGN is imposed in order to exclude non blocked flows. An arbitrary longitude is 
considered blocked when both GHGN and GHGS verify the condition expressed by Eq. (3) for at 
least one of the five ? values and simultaneously the ?0 height anomaly is positive. The detection 
scheme also incorporates a procedure to detect the center of blocking events (maximum Z500 
gridpoint within the anticyclonic flow), a blocking intensity index, and a spatial and temporal 
tracking algorithm.  

 

In this study, we only considered daily blocking patterns for which the maximum Z500 anomaly 
is located between 45°N and 70°N, and these locations will hereafter be called blocking centers. 
We must stress that this definition has the purpose to enable an objective separation in blocking 
sectors by reducing the large-scale of the blocking pattern to a single gridpoint that is 
representative of the weather system, as the specific location of a blocking center plays a major 
role in defining the synoptic circulation of a much wider region. Thus, two main sectors are 
defined: the Atlantic sector (ATL) which includes all blocking centers located in 30°W–0°W, and 
the European sector (EUR), spanning 0°E–30°E. This regional classification is justified from 
previous works that have explored the relationship between blocking and the main modes of 
variability of the atmospheric circulation (e.g., Barriopedro et al., 2006; Scherrer et al., 2006). 
These studies have reported a tight link between blocking activity and the centers of variability of 
the leading modes in the Euro-Atlantic sector, with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the 
Scandinavian Pattern (SCA) explaining most of the variability of ATL and EUR blocking, 
respectively. ATL and EUR blocking have also very distinct signals in European precipitation and 
temperature (e.g., Masato et al., 2011). Figure 4.1 (top) depicts the annual mean frequency of 
blocking center locations in each gridpoint (2.5° × 2.5°), as well as the seasonal frequency of 
blocking centers for each considered sector (bottom). It must remain clear that the main goal of 
classifying blocks into ATL and EUR types is to assess how the precipitation responses depend on 
the blocking location. Thus, this distinction between ATL and EUR blocks is purely based on their 
location, and does not necessarily involve different physical/dynamical processes in their 
lifecycles.

Bottom: Seasonal frequencies of block ing center location in each sector during 1950–2007 (in

Before evaluating the regional impacts of blocking on the IP precipitation, it is important to briefly 
characterize the atmospheric circulation signatures associated with regional blocking occurrence. 
Figure 4.2 shows the composite of Z500 anomalies for blocking days in each sector and season. 
For both sectors, Z500 positive anomalies are larger in the cold seasons than in the warm seasons. 
The largest anomalies are associated with ATL blocking. In this region, summer blocks display a 
northward extension of subtropical wave-breaking systems near the Azores high. Regional 
blocking is also associated to negative Z500 anomalies in some of the surrounding areas, being 
more evident during ATL blocks and in colder seasons, but less pronounced than the positive ones. 
These negative anomalies display different intensity and location for ATL and EUR blocks, which 
suggest different impacts on precipitation, thus supporting the classification in blocking sectors

adopted herein. Note that some blocking events may contribute to the composites of both sectors, 
since ATL blocks tend to evolve eastwards towards Europe throughout their lifecycle (Croci-
Maspoli et al., 2007; Barriopedro et al., 2010a). This is supported by similar composites (see 
Supplementary Material – Fig.4.12) performed for blocking subsectors of 15° longitud i na l 
extension within the ATL and EUR regions.

4.1.3 Seasonal impacts of blocking in Iberian precipitation 

With the aim of evaluating the impacts of blocking on the IP precipitation, seasonal composites 
of daily precipitation anomalies were calculated for days with blocking centers in each sector. For 



4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature

this purpose, daily anomaly series of precipitation in each gridpoint were computed, and then 
composited for blocking days of each season and sector. We opted to present the relative anomalies 
in the composites (in percentage relative to the climatological seasonal precipitation during 1950–
2007), as seen in Fig. 4.3. Gridpoints where the climatological seasonal mean total precipitation is 
below 50 mm were discarded, since relative anomalies in dry areas may be misleading. This 
process excludes dryer regions in southern/central IP, where summer rainfall is usually scarce 
(Belo-Pereira et al. 2011), and the relevance of high anomalies would be doubtful. A two-sample 
Smirnov-Kolmogorov test (hereafter KStest) was applied to assess the statistical significance of 
these anomalies (Wilks, 2011).

block ing center days in each considered sector using (and comparing) the low-resolution NCEP/NCAR 
dataset with the high-resolution IBERIA02 dataset. Regions where the anomalies are statistically 
significant at the 5 % level are represented with dots. Anomalies for gridpoints with total seasonal 
precipitation below 50 mm were not considered (grey crosses).

The composites presented in Fig. 4.3 show that, with the exception of summer, the seasonal 
patterns of regional blocking signals in precipitation are reasonably coherent throughout the year, 
particularly for ATL blocks. The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis composites show a consistent positive 
precipitation anomaly in the Mediterranean coast associated with blocking occurrence in both 
sectors. In particular, during winter, the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis displays very minor differe nces 
between the impacts of ATL and EUR blocks. However, the high-resolution IBERIA02 dataset 
reveals specific regional details in these patterns and clear differences between ATL and EUR 
blocks. For example, significant negative precipitation anomalies are found in northwestern 
regions of the IP that cannot be clearly identified using the low-resolution dataset. In summer, the 
NCEP/NCAR reanalysis displays a SW–NE gradient response in precipitation anomalies that is 
absent in the high-resolution dataset. We must bear in mind that most of IP registers low mean 
precipitation values during these months and, consequently, one should refrain from 
overemphasizing summer anomalies. 

Regarding the different impacts that arise from different blocking locations, it is found that for 
most of the year (with the exception made for spring), ATL blocks are associated with increased 
precipitation over wide areas of the IP, while EUR blocks tend to bring more localized positive 
anomalies, particularly in coastal Mediterranean strips. For instance, during autumn, ATL blocks 
lead to above average precipitation in almost the entire peninsula. Taking this example, once again, 
the impact of the different resolutions from the datasets appears very clear, as EUR blocking 
composite for the NCEP/NCAR dataset clearly miss most of the positive autumn precipitat io n 
anomalies that are depicted by the corresponding IBERIA02 composite. 

Taking into account the tendency for eastward blocking migration mentioned above, we have 
also computed the precipitation anomaly composites occurring in the previous 5 days to EUR 
blocks. These composites show a quite similar pattern (see Supplementary Material – Fig. 4.13) to 
the one found for ATL blocking, thus confirming that the transition from the ATL to the EUR 
precipitation composites partially reflects the transient responses to an eastward blocking 
migration and hence, that the precipitation responses to blocking depend on the blocking location. 

With the aim of summarizing the different impacts of regional blocking, we computed annual 
composites of daily precipitation anomalies for each blocking sector. Furthermore, to better 
interpret the blocking signatures we compared them with the corresponding composites obtained 
for days characterized by strong zonal flow, which represents a large-scale atmospheric pattern 
with nearly opposite anomalies to those associated with blocking. This procedure allows assessing 
the linear response in precipitation to opposite zonal flow regimes. For this purpose, we followed 
very simple criteria described in Trigo et al. (2004) to classify strong zonal flow days in the 
Atlantic and European sectors: (1) a given longitude is affected by strong zonal flow conditions if 
the meridional mid-latitude Z500 gradients exceed several empirical thresholds (see Trigo et al., 
2004 for further details); (2) the entire sector is considered to be in strong zonal flow configura t io n 
if at least three adjacent longitudes satisfy (1). The KStest was applied to assess the statistica l 
significance of these anomalies. 

The annual composites of daily precipitation anomalies for regional blocking and strong zonal 
flow conditions are shown in Fig. 4.4. The existence of a negative–positive dipole in precipitat io n

anomalies under blocking action is again evidenced at the annual scale. For both blocking sectors, 
the positive precipitation anomalies found in eastern and southern coastal areas are considerably 
wider in spatial extension and larger in amplitude than the negative anomalies found in 
northwestern IP, which are essentially restricted to ATL blocks. During strong zonal episodes there 
is also a tendency for a northwest-southeast dipole in precipitation anomalies, but with the opposite 
signals to those found during blocking conditions. Strong westerly flows are related with below 
average precipitation in southern and eastern IP, and with near-normal or non-significa nt 
precipitation excess in the northwest. As a consequence, the differences between blocked and zonal 
conditions depict an even more contrasting dipole, which reflects the large relevance that blocking 
episodes wield on rainfall regimes in southern and eastern regions of Iberia, where we once again 
stress that mean annual rainfall totals are much lower than for northwestern sectors (Belo-Pereira 
et al. 2011). 

 
Fig. 4.4 Annual composites of daily precipitation anomalies (%) in the Iberian Peninsula for blocking 
(left column) and strong zonal flow (center column) days in the Atlantic (upper row) and European 
(lower row) sectors. The difference between the regional blocking and strong zonal flow composites is 
presented in the right column. Only statistically significant anomalies at the 5 % level are shown. 
 

As stated above, the high-resolution precipitation data set allows identifying important 
differences between the regional and local precipitation responses associated with ATL and EUR 
blocks that otherwise would be missed in a coarser grid. Thus, during ATL blocks positive 
anomalies cover a wider area than that affected by EUR blocks, and also the locations of the largest 
anomalies are different depending on the considered sector. In particular, during EUR blocks there 
is a particular emphasis on the coastal strip of eastern Spain, while under ATL blocks the highest 



4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature 
 
 

113 
 

anomalies are found further south in eastern Spain, and also in southernmost areas of the IP and 
the Gibraltar area. On the other hand, a sharp northwest-southeast gradient is found for ATL 
blocks, while EUR blocks show a less pronounced gradient, and a slight northward shift of the 
associated maximum of precipitation, as compared to ATL blocks. Also, the deficit of precipitat io n 
in northwest IP is clearly identifiable for blocking located in the ATL sector, but it does not reach 
the 5 % statistical significance level in the EUR composite. The same regional differences are 
observed in the blocking minus strong zonal flow composite difference. 

Another interesting difference between the ATL and EUR composites is their different linear 
response to blocked and zonal flows. Thus, the precipitation response to opposite anomalous 
conditions in the westerly flow over EUR is largely linear, while for the ATL sector there are 
important asymmetries. It should be noticed that part of these results may be due to a larger 
difference between the frequencies of blocked and zonal days for ATL when compared to EUR. 
In particular, the precipitation signals over eastern IP during ATL blocks are much larger than 
those observed during strong zonal flow conditions. This implies that the precipitation regimes of 
these areas are particularly sensitive to blocked conditions. Such asymmetric responses to 
circulation anomalies in the ATL sector are much more difficult to identify when relying on 
composites obtained using the NCEP/NCAR low-resolution dataset, once again reinforcing the 
convenience of the high-resolution dataset. 

 

The impact of blocking events in the precipitation regimes of the eastern and southern sectors of 
IP (Fig. 4.4) coupled with the considerably lower climatological precipitation values observed in 
these regions necessarily imply a considerable contribution of blocking episodes on total yearly 
precipitation therein (solid lines, upper panels Fig. 4.5), which exceeds 10 % in eastern areas of 
the IP. We were also interested in checking if the precipitation anomalies during blocking patterns 
are derived from an equivalent change in the number of rainy days, or from changes in the 
precipitation amount during precipitating days. To address this question, we computed regional 
blocking composites of the anomalous number of days with total precipitation above 1 mm. The 
results (Fig. 4.5, shaded) indicate a large decrease in the number of rainy days over the 
northwestern half IP and much smaller changes elsewhere. The pronounced drop of rainy days in 
northwestern IP (in some areas above 20 %) only impinges a slight decrease in total precipitat io n 
(Fig. 4.4). We argue that this result could be due to blocking mainly inducing light precipitat ing 
days in the NW sector of IP, thus leading to small net changes. The decrease in the number of rainy 
days during blocking situations also affects other large portions of the IP, including regions where 
the precipitation composites showed significant increases in total precipitation. This suggests that 
the precipitation responses to blocking are largely attributable to changing rates of precipitat io n 
rather than to the number of precipitating days, especially in southeastern IP. Naturally, this also 
involves a higher frequency of intense or torrential precipitation days during blocked patterns in 
these regions, as it will be discussed further ahead.

compared with the complete 1950–2007 climatology (in percentage). Solid black  lines represent the 
contribution (in percentage) of the corresponding synoptic pattern to the annual total precipitation. 

 
4.1.4 Synoptic forcing 

Once the impacts of regional anomalous zonal flow conditions on IP precipitation regimes are 
well characterized, it is important to understand the processes that drive them at the synoptic scale. 
As shown in previous works, blocking occurrence induces positive precipitation anomalies in 
several areas of southern Europe, but it does not promote higher values of precipitable water in the 
same areas (e.g., Trigo et al., 2004). Thus, it is mandatory to distinguish processes that enhance 
moisture availability from those that provide the favorable conditions for water condensation. For 
this purpose, we computed anomalous composites (for blocked and strong zonal flow situatio ns) 
of Z500, LI, and IVT (and the corresponding mean horizontal transport of IVT). In this way, we 
were able to compare the distribution of moisture fluxes (throughout the use of the IVT) and 
simultaneously the anomalies in instability (LI). The former is related to moisture availability for 
precipitation and the latter measures whether the environmental conditions are prone to enhance 
condensation of water vapor. The composites have been performed for blocked and zonal days, 
and their difference, as depicted in Fig. 4.6.

in dam, thin black  lines - the thick er line corresponds to the 550 dam isohypse) and mean horizontal 
transport (black  arrows, k g m?1 s?1) for blocking (left panel) days, zonal (middle panel) days and their 
difference (right panel). Upper (lower) row panels correspond to the Atlantic (European) sector 
composites. 
 

The composites of Fig. 4.6 show that during strong zonal conditions there is a corridor of high 
moisture content transport extending towards the British Isles and affecting northwestern IP. This 
moist corridor is zonally elongated towards central Europe during strong zonal flow conditions 
over EUR, as compared to those occurring in ATL. Blocking patterns efficiently obstruct these 
moisture fluxes, which is in good agreement with the rainfall reductions observed in NW IP during 
blocking patterns, but not with the precipitation increases in southeastern IP. However, areas of 
positive LI anomalies are found in the IP during blocking episodes, with a dependence on the 
considered sector. Thus, atmospheric instability tends to be reinforced in western (eastern) IP 
during ATL (EUR) blocking days, in good agreement with the precipitation increases obtained in 
the previous section over southern (eastern) IP. Moreover, the difference between blocked and 
zonal flow composites shows a large increase in atmospheric instability over IP when we shift 
from zonal to blocked flows, despite their common reduction in moisture content at higher 
latitudes. This suggests that moisture availability is not a major limiting factor to explain the 
precipitation responses to anomalous zonal flow conditions over most of the IP. In fact, these 
composites show that the positive precipitation anomalies in south and eastern IP during blocking 
episodes are related with the increment of atmospheric instability in the target areas. 

Additionally, we would like to explore whether the changes in moisture content and instabilit y 
are triggered by specific weather systems. Trigo et al. (2004) already discussed the important role 
played by the southward deflection of the storm-tracks in the European precipitation responses to 
blocking episodes. Thus, taking into account the main synoptic patterns that trigger precipitat io n 



4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature

events in the IP, we next explore changes in their frequency during blocking and strong zonal flow 
episodes for each considered sector. In this regard, we herein distinguish between near-surface 
cyclones and upper-level low-pressure systems such as COLs, both causing negative Z500 
anomalies (as those found over the IP in the blocking minus strong zonal flow composites of Fig. 
4.6). To achieve this, we first looked at the climatological frequency of cyclones and COL in the 
Euro-Atlantic area, as presented in the top panels of Figs. 4.7 and 4.8, respectively. The results 
reflect some well-known facts: (1) the North Atlantic is a preferred region for storm-tracks, with 
northwestern IP being commonly affected by them (Fig. 4.7); (2) the Mediterranean basin (and the 
IP in particular) are the regions in the Euro-Atlantic sector where COL activity is more frequent 
throughout the year (Fig. 4.8). We next check the amplitude and significance of eventual changes 
in their frequency (as compared to climatology) during blocking episodes for both the ATL and 
EUR sectors. We also explore if there is an agreement between cyclonic and COL blocking-related 
tracks and the already mentioned increases in atmospheric instability during these events. 

 

 

The anomalies in cyclone activity (non-stationary near surface systems) show a clear increase in 
most areas close to the IP during ATL blocks (Fig. 4.7, middle left), in contrast with a sharp 
decrease in the UK, where cyclonic activity is almost non-existent during blocking patterns. For 
EUR blocks (Fig. 4.7, middle right) the cyclone frequency decrease is shifted eastwards (over the 
Scandinavia region), in good agreement with the location of the blocking high (Fig. 4.2), but the 
increase in cyclonic activity elsewhere is predominantly non-significant. Note that despite the 
cyclone increase over the IP there is also a reduction in moisture fluxes to the north of the IP during 
blocking conditions (Fig. 4.6), which may explain the decrease in precipitation found in NW IP. 
In this regard, it must also be reminded that a large fraction of the precipitation that occurs in this 
region is related to frontal systems that are linked to cyclone centers located at higher latitudes 
(Trigo et al., 2004) and whose frequency is strongly reduced during blocking situations. This is 
supported by the ATL blocking composites of Figs. 4.6 and 4.7, which show that the maximum 
decrease in cyclonic activity occurs to the north of the corresponding decrease in moisture content. 
Thus, the precipitation deficits in NW IP during ATL blocks can be attributed to a decrease on the 
frequency of efficient Atlantic low-pressure systems affecting high latitudes (and the subsequent 
decrease in moisture fluxes in the vicinity of northwest Iberia).

Concerning changes in COLs activity, results show a significant increase around the Iberian 
Peninsula domain during ATL blocks (over 150 % in some areas) as presented in Fig. 4.8. There 
is also an increase during EUR blocks, but displaced towards Eastern Europe, although still 
appreciable in eastern IP (~50 %). The increase in COL and transient cyclones activity during ATL 
blocks is in fair agreement with the increase found in precipitation and atmospheric instabilit y 
anomalies in southern IP. Regarding the responses found during EUR blocks, there is a slight 
decrease in cyclonic activity close to northeastern Iberia (Fig. 4.7), contrasting with a small 
increase of COL activity in the Mediterranean coast of the IP (Fig. 4.8). This fact suggests that the 
initial stages of COLs - corresponding to troughs located over the region which later develop and 
mature into COLs towards the east—may be the main cause for the significant increases in 
atmospheric instability and precipitation in the area. 

Furthermore, the analysis of Fig. 4.7 (bottom panel) shows that in the IP region the responses in 
cyclone frequency to strong zonal flows are similar for the two sectors (both negative). This fact 
shows that the different precipitation responses to ATL and EUR zonal flows (see Fig. 4.4) are 
likely not related to changes in cyclone paths. On the contrary, the areas of higher reduction in 
COLs shift eastwards from ATL to EUR zonal flows (Fig. 4.8), apparently in better agreement 
with the respective regions of negative precipitation anomalies (Fig. 4.4). Still, we must bear in 
mind that both cyclones and COLs analyses were performed on coarser grids when compared to 
the high-resolution precipitation dataset, thus losing some information about the dependence of 
the precipitation responses on small changes in the location of these synoptic systems. 

 

 

4.1.5 Extreme value analysis 

As stated in the introduction, several areas of the IP are often affected by episodes of torrential 
precipitation, with significant contributions to seasonal totals, and important socio-economic 
impacts. This is particularly true for the eastern coasts of the IP, as the presence of warm 
Mediterranean waters (especially at the end of the summer and the beginning of autumn) fosters 
such precipitation regimes (e.g., García-Herrera et al., 2005a). We must bear in mind the results 
from Sect. 3, where it was evident that the significant increase in rainfall during blocking episodes 
over this region was not a result of an increase in the number of rainy days, thus suggesting a 
higher rate of heavy precipitation episodes during such atmospheric patterns. To check the 
efficiency of regional blocking patterns in promoting extreme rainfall events, we first computed 
the ratio between the frequency of blocking and strong zonal flow days with total precipitat io n 
above the local 90th percentile for the ATL and EUR sectors, as presented in Fig. 4.9.

Fig. 4.9 Extreme precipitation efficiency: quotient between the number of block ing days with daily 
precipitation above the 90th percentile and the number of zonal days with daily precipitation above 
the 90th percentile (in %) in the ATL (left panel) and EUR (right panel) sectors. Quotients above the 
100 % isoline (thick  black  lines) are represented by dark er reddish shading. 
 

Easternmost regions of Spain (for ATL and EUR blocks) and southernmost regions of Spain and 
Portugal (for ATL blocks) have higher ratios of extreme days during blocking episodes, when 
compared to strong zonal flows. The opposite result is found for northwestern IP, where the rainiest 
days are more associated with strong zonal flow patterns. Scrutinizing in further detail these 
different extreme precipitation regimes, we performed an extreme value analysis on the high-
resolution precipitation dataset in order to: (a) identify regions with homogeneous extreme 
precipitation regimes and find the model that better fits to their tailed distributions; (b) analyze the 
contribution of different weather regimes to extreme daily precipitation episodes in these distinct 
sectors. 

Several authors have shown that the Generalized Pareto (GP) Distribution provides adequate fits 
for one-side tailed distributions as the one found for precipitation extremes. The use of this type 
of fit for precipitation extremes is useful to model parameters such as probability maps of specific 
threshold exceedances, or return levels and periods. For example, Vicente-Serrano et al. (2009) 
used this fit to model extreme precipitation events in areas of Spain during different phases of the 
NAO and the Mediterranean Oscillation, and Toreti et al. (2010) characterized extreme winter 
precipitation in Mediterranean coastal sites in association with anomalous atmospheric circulat io n 
patterns. 

When performing an extreme value analysis, we must bear in mind that the sample sizes of 
extreme episodes need to be large enough to provide satisfying fits. This is not the case for all 
considered gridpoints of the dataset, as in some areas heavy precipitation events are particular ly 
rare. Furthermore, adjusting such a large number of local models requires some caution, taking 
into account that the associated errors resulting from each particular fit may eventually lead to 
unreliable results. Hence, the spatial comparison and coherence of such a large number of fits must 



4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature 
 
 

121 
 

be considered carefully. For this reason, we opted to first apply a spatial aggregation scheme, by 
considering four boxes of gridpoints. These boxes (Fig. 4.10) have been defined taking into 
account the different responses in precipitation regimes found in the previous sections, as well as 
areas where extreme events are spatially coherent and often lead to abundant precipitation and 
have more severe impacts. In addition, a fifth test box was defined in central areas of the IP, to 
check the fit in a region with a different regime of precipitation extremes. In order to perform this 
spatial aggregation of the data, it is necessary to check if these sub-domains defined heuristica l ly 
actually represent homogeneous regions in terms of the extreme precipitation distribution. For this 
purpose, we used a methodology based on the L-Moments, where a statistic H1 checks the degree 
of heterogeneity of a region in terms of precipitation extremes (for further details on the 
methodology see Hosking and Wallis, 1997). This test was applied separately to each box by 
considering the gridpoint sub-series containing only rainy days with precipitation above the local 
90t h percentile. For all boxes, the H1 statistic presented values lower than 1, i.e., below the required 
threshold to consider regions as homogeneous (Hosking and Wallis, 1997). Since the defined 
regions are homogenous, for each specific day we considered the absolute maximum of all 
gridpoints inside the box, in order to obtain the precipitation extreme daily series of each box. Such 
a process significantly increases the number of extreme precipitation records, as compared to that 
obtained by considering fits for individual gridpoints. 

 

Fig. 4.10 Boxes defined for the Generalized Pareto fit: northwest (BOXNW); north (BOXN), southwest 
(BOXSW); east (BOXE) and central (BOXC). These boxes were defined tak ing into account the 
precipitation anomaly patterns found in Section 3.1.3, and also the Iberian Peninsula geography and 
socioeconomic factors.

The above mentioned extreme daily series of each box were then used to assess whether the 
frequency of extreme precipitation events in each box and for different weather regimes is large 
enough to perform the extreme value analysis. Table 4.1 presents the number of rainy days with 
precipitation above the 90th percentile, and the frequency of such extremes occurring under 
blocked and zonal days. This exercise also allows analyzing the effectiveness of each considered 
weather pattern on promoting extreme precipitation days in the different areas of the IP. 

 

Table 4.1 Number of extreme rainy days (above 1 mm, with total precipitation above the 90th 
percentile) for each box, and the relative contribution of each considered weather pattern (in 
percentage with respect to the total number of extreme rainy days). 

 
 

As it can be seen from Table 4.1, the sum of extreme days during blocked and zonal patterns 
corresponds to almost half of the total extreme days for any of the considered boxes. In the case 
of BOXNW and BOXN, the contribution of blocking to extreme precipitation days is near 15 %, 
while that of strong zonal flows is around 30 %. In BOXSW and BOXE, these results are reversed, 
in agreement with the overall pattern presented in Fig. 4.9, thus reinforcing the idea that blocking 
favors extreme events in these regions, while strong zonal flows (mainly those occurring over the 
ATL) are more decisive for extreme precipitation in the Atlantic areas of the IP. Regarding BOXC, 
there is a similar contribution of blocked and strong zonal flows, albeit with slightly higher 
percentages of extreme events during blocked patterns, particularly when they are located over the 
European sector. Therefore, the number of extreme precipitation events occurring under blocking 
and zonal flows is large enough to perform an extreme value analysis. 

 

We next explored the theoretical model that better captures the distribution of the extremes daily 
series of each box. This was done by applying different models to the daily series of each 
considered box and constructing L-Moment Ratio diagrams to visually check the convenience of 
each fit (Fig. 4.11). These diagrams clearly point to the GP fit as the most suitable one for our 
extreme precipitation series in all boxes. Besides this visual inspection, we later checked the 
goodness-of-fit of models for each sub-region using the Anderson–Darling test (Wilks, 2011), as 
it will be detailed further ahead.

Fig. 4.11 L-Moment Ratio diagrams for series of precipitation days above the 90th percentile in the 
five considered boxes inside the Iberian Peninsula. Different curves represent different types of 
Extreme Value distributions and grey dots correspond to the observed values in each box. 
 

In order to perform the GP fit (Beirlant et al., 2004) for extreme precipitation events in each box, 
we have followed a scheme similar to the one presented by Vicente-Serrano et al. (2009). Thus, 
we defined discrete blocking and zonal events as sequences of at least 4 days under those particular 
synoptic conditions. While blocked events are more frequent over Europe, zonal patterns are more 
frequent in the ATL sector. The results of this classification indicate that zonal events tend to last 
longer than blocked events (~9 and ~7 days, respectively), and that for both types of events ATL 
patterns persist for slightly longer periods than EUR patterns. Then, once again using the extreme 
daily series of the individual boxes (previously obtained from the daily maxima inside each of 
these sub-regions), we obtained two different new time-series for each box, each one having a 
single precipitation value associated to each specific weather event. These two series are 
comprised by: (1) the maximum daily value of each event (PMAX); (2) the accumulated 
precipitation of each event (PTOT). This has been done in order to perform a temporal declustering 
over sequences of rainy days, and thus to avoid the presence of serial dependence or persistence. 

Next, for each box, we followed a peak-over-threshold approach, by calculating the high 
percentiles of the series of rainy days, and then applying GP fits for the corresponding tails of the 
PTOT and PMAX time-series obtained for both weather patterns (blocked and strong zonal flow 
events). In order to decide the more appropriate percentile threshold, we relied on both graphical 
(probability–probability plots, see Supplementary Material, Fig. 4.14 and Fig. 4.15) and formal 
(Anderson–Darling test) selection techniques. Taking this into account we finally opted for the 



4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature 
 
 

124 
 

90th percentile as a final threshold, and all presented GP fits were performed for the tail series 
based on this threshold. The confidence levels for the fits, as well as their corresponding tail and 
shape parameters are presented in Tables 4.2 and 4.3.

parameter of each GP fit applied to the tailed distribution (above the 90th percentile) of the PMAX 
series of the five considered boxes of gridpoints, during block ing (left columns) and strong zonal events 
(right columns) in the ATL and EUR sectors. 

 
 

Table 4.3 Same as Table 4.2, but for the PTOT time series. 

 
 

Overall, the confidence levels obtained after performing the Anderson–Darling test are high 
(above 90 %), thus giving us confidence on most of the performed fits, and once again reinforc ing 
on the convenience of the GP fit to model precipitation tail distributions. The location parameter 
of the fits illustrates very well the different contribution of distinct weather regimes to extreme 
daily precipitation episodes at the regional scale. Higher values of this parameter are found for 
blocked patterns in southern and eastern areas (BOXE and BOXSW), contrarily to northern regions 
(BOXN, BOXNW and BOXC), where higher values are found for zonal flows. These regional 
differences become clearer when we analyze PTOT, for which the changes on the location 
parameter from blocked to zonal flows are higher, particularly for BOXNW. This is not surprising, 
since: (1) extreme precipitation days in Mediterranean (Atlantic) areas of the IP are strongly linked 
to blocked patterns (strong zonal flows); (2) large sequences of moderate to heavy rainfall are 
frequent in northwest Iberia during strong zonal synoptic conditions; (3) torrential episodes in the 
Mediterranean coasts occur essentially at shorter time scales. We must recall that the mean 
duration of strong zonal flow events is slightly larger than that of blocking events. This is obviously 
important when comparing the probabilities for PTOT, as different mean durations involve 
different expected accumulated values. 

These results confirm the existence of different extreme precipitation regimes between 
northwestern and southeastern sectors of the IP, with the former being related to persistent 



4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature

moderate precipitating events and the latter by short-lived intense episodes. They also demonstrate 
that these regional differences are to a large extent due to different triggering large-scale weather 
regimes (strong zonal flows and blocking patterns, respectively). These distinct atmospheric 
configurations play a very different contribution to the occurrence of extreme events in those 
regions, and although they are both related to anomalies of the zonal flow, they exhibit nearly 
opposite synoptic features and very different persistence signatures, thus shaping regional 
differences in the tailed distributions of precipitating events. 

 

4.1.6 Discussion 

In this work, we made a reassessment of blocking impacts on precipitation regimes over the 
Iberian Peninsula, taking advantage of the recently developed high-resolution datasets for the two 
Iberian countries. The simple comparison between blocking composites obtained using a low-
resolution dataset (NCEP) and the high-resolution dataset (IBERIA02) clearly shows that only the 
latter can represent adequately specific regional impacts. Furthermore, the difference between the 
impacts caused by blocking episodes in different sectors (Atlantic and Europe) is also perfectly 
clear using the high-resolution data. Overall, blocking occurrence induces a negative to positive 
marked dipole in precipitation from northwest to southeast Iberia, with a northeast shift of the 
largest positive anomalies from ATL blocks to EUR blocks. We must recall that the blocking 
structures tend to migrate eastwards in most cases, and hence the regional precipitation responses 
partially reflect blocking impacts at different stages of the blocking lifecycle. 

Increases in precipitation rates above 50 % are found in some regions during blocked synoptic 
patterns. In particular, positive precipitation anomalies extend to most of the IP domain during 
ATL blocks, being larger in southern and southeastern areas of the IP, while during EUR blocks 
they tend to be more restricted to eastern Mediterranean regions. Nevertheless, the relevance of 
blocking on precipitation vanishes as we move towards the northwest. In these regions, the blocked 
patterns only contribute to less than 10 % of the total mean annual precipitation. Nearly opposite 
results are obtained for strong zonal flows. However, there are some important asymmetries in the 
precipitation signals between zonal and blocked patterns, suggesting some non-linear responses to 
changes in the westerly flow. 

The synoptic configurations associated with blocking show negative Z500 anomalies to the south 
of the blocking centers. As a consequence, during blocking situations, storm-tracks tend to be 
deflected southwards, towards the IP domain, explaining part of the precipitation excess found 
over Iberia. Still, this shift is not completely compatible with the blocking-related precipitat io n 
deficits in northwest Iberia. In this case, changes in transport and moisture availability during 
blocking days (involving a reduced efficiency of Atlantic frontal systems located northwards of 
the IP) explain the reduction in rainfall amount. Other important dynamical factors seem to play a 
role in the precipitation responses to blocking over the Mediterranean region. In particular, the 
simultaneous increases in low pressure systems (particularly cut-off lows) affecting the area and 
atmospheric instability help to understand the blocking signatures in precipitation over the 
Mediterranean coast. This important rise in the frequency of cut-off lows in the IP area (particular ly 



4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature 
 
 

126 
 

during ATL blocks) is in agreement with Nieto et al. (2007), which noticed the increase of COL 
activity in the southern flank of Euro-Atlantic blocking systems. This sustains the importance of 
dynamical factors in shaping the precipitation regimes of the IP, especially in the Mediterranean 
areas. Furthermore, the high-resolution dataset reveals substantial differences on the precipitat io n 
responses to blocking over relatively small regions (mainly in the Mediterranean). This indicates 
a major importance of local processes (such as moisture convergence and deep convection) on the 
precipitation regimes of that part of Iberia and calls for further investigation, including the 
relevance and impact of Sea Surface Temperatures, and their connections and feedbacks with the 
particular synoptic patterns that arise from blocking situations. 

On the other hand, we have found that, for most of the IP, the precipitation increases associated 
with blocking are due to changes in precipitation amount rather than changes in the number of 
precipitation days. In fact, despite the overall increase in precipitation under blocking action, there 
is either a concurrent decrease in the number of measurable rainfall days in most of the regions of 
Iberia (more pronounced in NW Iberia) or irrelevant changes in the number of rainy days. This 
fact indicates that rainfall regimes during blocking days are more extreme in southeastern Iberia, 
where the blocking contribution to annual totals is the greatest. The results are supported by the 
existence of a northwest-southeast dipole in the rate of days with extreme precipitation occurring 
under strong zonal flow and blocking. 

Finally, we have performed an Extreme Value Analysis, fitting Generalized Pareto distribut io ns 
to maximum daily precipitation and total accumulated precipitation series for distinct 
homogeneous sub-regions inside the IP during blocking and strong zonal episodes. This approach 
shows that extreme precipitation events during blocking conditions tend to be short-lived (i.e., 
isolated extremes at the daily scale), mainly in the Mediterranean, while zonal events are more 
relevant concerning the total episode accumulated precipitation in northwest Iberia.

4.2 High-resolution Iberian rainfall deficits during ridge 
patterns  

In this section we present additional results on the high-resolution precipitation responses to sub-
tropical ridge episodes. Bearing in mind that some local signatures (particularly during summer 
ridges) are highly dependent on small shifts of the subtropical ridge location (see Section 2.1), here 
results are shown for subtropical ridges occurring within the four 15º longitudinal sectors that can 
impinge a significant impact in Iberia, namely: ATLW (30W-15W), ATLE (15W-0W), EURW (0E-
15E) and EURE (15E-30E). Composites of relative anomalies in daily precipitation (in %) during 
winter and summer ridge days are presented in Fig. 4.16.

Fig. 4.16 Composites of relative anomalies in daily precipitation (in %) for ridge days in the ATLW, 
ATLE, EURW and EURE sectors during winter (upper panels) and summer (lower panels). Only 
statistically significant anomalies at 5% significance level are depicted. 
 

As it can be seen in the upper panels of Fig. 4.16, ridges in both ATL subsectors, as well as in 
EURW result in dramatic decreases in daily precipitation rates. This is crucial for Iberian water 
availability, since most areas strongly depend on winter precipitation, which is the wettest season. 
These results are in good agreement with Santos et al. (2009), who stressed the key role played by 
eastern Atlantic ridges on Iberian drought episodes. Still, this high-resolution grid provides further 
details, which are masked in coarser datasets. For example, during ATLW ridges, the Cantabria 
region and the western Pyrenees have increased rainfall, contrarily to all other areas. This may be 
explained as follows: a ridge located far enough to the west of Iberia still enables northerly moist 
flows towards those mountainous areas, whereas the intense north-south Föhn effect will prevent 
positive precipitation anomalies south of the mountain ranges. For ridges located over Iberia 
(ATLE), decreases are striking over the entire peninsula, with some areas receiving no precipitat io n 
at all. On the other hand, ridges located eastwards (EURE) are sufficiently distant to produce 
smaller impacts on precipitation. 



4. Blocking impacts on Iberian precipitation and temperature 
 
 

130 
 

During summer (Fig. 4.16, lower panels), the overall precipitation reductions are less significa nt 
and not so homogeneous, with larger spatial variability in the regional responses. It should be 
stressed that most areas are quite dry during this season (particularly central and southern sectors 
of the peninsula), and therefore these intense negative anomalies are relatively meaningless. Still, 
it is possible to find some significant localized precipitation increases during summer ATLW  
ridges, as well as in northwestern Iberia during EURW ridges. Nevertheless, the relative ly 
generalized negative impact on precipitation remains dominant in most areas for the majority of 
sub-regional ridge structures occurring in the ATL and EUR sectors, with the largest signal being 
associated to ATLE systems. 

 

4.3 High-resolution Iberian temperature responses to blocks 
and ridges 

Using the blocking and ridge catalogues, a finer scale analysis on high-resolution temperature 
responses over Iberia to those atmospheric patterns has also been performed. Similarly to the high-
resolution Iberian precipitation dataset (IBERIA02), a maximum and minimum temperature 
dataset has been developed by Herrera et al. (2012), at the horizontal resolution of 0.2º x 0.2º. 
However, unlike the precipitation dataset, the temperature dataset is only currently available for 
Spanish meteorological stations. Thus, all results shown in this section do not include the 
Portuguese area of the Iberian Peninsula. 

Composites of winter and summer maximum temperature anomalies during blocking and ridges 
are presented in Fig. 4.17 and Fig. 4.18, respectively. As in the previous section, here we show 
results for the weather systems occurring within the following 15º longitudinal sectors: ATLW, 
ATLE, EURW and EURE. 

On the overall, the anomalies found over Iberia resemble those from the E-OBS dataset (Fig. 
2.12 and Fig. 2.13), with cold temperatures being associated to blocks, and warm temperatures 
prevailing during ridges. Nevertheless, some regional particularities arise, which were not so well 
captured by the sparser E-OBS dataset. For example, there is a region with near normal maximum 
temperatures in the Ebro valley during winter EURW ridges, contrasting with the overall warming 
Iberian response to this pattern. This difference is likely induced by prolonged foggy episodes that 
are frequent in this area, under stable anticyclonic conditions (Cuxart and Jimenez, 2010). On the 
other hand, the largest minimum temperature anomalies during winter ridges tend to occur in some 
mountainous areas, suggesting subsidence and thermal inversion patterns. It should be noted that 
the winter increases in maximum temperature during ridge episodes are larger than those observed 
for minimum temperature, due to reduced cloud cover under stable conditions and thus an increase 
of solar radiation during the day and also the loss of infrared radiation at night. In fact, some 
southwestern areas of Iberia experience slightly below average minimum temperatures during 
ATL ridges. Finally, the impact of the ridge patterns centered over the Iberian Peninsula (ATLW  
and EURE) display a considerable stronger maximum temperature anomaly than the two other 
regional systems (Fig. 4.17).

temperature anomalies (in ºC) for block ing and ridge days in the ATLW,ATLE, EURW and EURE sectors, 
based on the SPAIN02 high-resolution dataset. Only statistically significant anomalies at 5% 
significance level are depicted. 
 

During winter blocking events, the associated decreases in maximum temperature are also larger 
than in minimum temperature, resulting in reduced daily amplitudes, particularly for ATL blocks 
(Fig 4.17). This is in agreement with the concurrent increase in cloud cover and precipitation, as 
shown in Sections 3.1 and 4.1, due to the blocking- induced southerly deviation of the storm-tracks. 
The temperature responses over Iberia during summer blocking (Fig. 4.18) are qualitatively similar 
to the ones found during winter, due to a combination of reduced insolation, and cold advection 
from higher latitudes in the eastern flank of the blocking systems (as previously discussed in 
Section 2.1).

Fig. 4.18 Same as Fig.4.17, but during summer. 
 

As already mentioned in Section 2.1, ridge patterns are often associated with summer extreme 
temperature episodes in southern Europe, including the Iberian Peninsula (Fig. 4.18). Overall, the 
increases in minimum temperature associated to ridges are smaller, resulting in larger amplit udes 
of the daily temperature cycle, which can be explained by radiative heating (see Section 2.1.4). 
The composites of temperature anomalies during summer ridges are striking, being particular ly 
generalized for ATLE and EURW ridges, with most areas experiencing anomalies above +3ºC. The 
temperature responses are particularly notorious in central Spain during ATLE ridges, or 
northeastern Spain during EURW ridges (particularly the Pyrenees), which reach +7ºC.  

 

It is worth noting that anomalies are almost non-existent for ridges occurring in neighbor ing 
sectors to the Iberian peninsula, i.e. EURE and ATLW, thus confirming that the exact location of 
the sub-tropical ridge axis is paramount to determine the areas that experience extremely warm 
conditions (Section 2.1). For example, for ATLW ridges, significant positive anomalies are found

in southern Galicia, but the region of Cantabria and Basque country experiences below average 
temperatures. Although data is unavailable for Portugal, the spatial pattern suggests the occurrence 
of relevant positive anomalies in westernmost Iberia under ATLW ridges.

Summary 

Context and objectives 

This chapter summarizes the main conclusions of the thesis and presents some preliminary results 

of ongoing work, thus providing perspectives for hopefully publishable material. Besides 

temperature and precipitation series, other climate-related phenomena, which are relevant from a 

socio-economic and environmental perspective (such as droughts and wildfires), are conditioned 

by the occurrence of blocking and sub-tropical ridge patterns. In Sections 5.2 and 5.3 additional 

examples of the impacts associated to blocking and ridge patterns are provided, which were 

considered outside the scope of the papers presented in Chapters 2-4. Particular attention is 

devoted to feedback processes between blocking/ridges and droughts, and their mediating role 

during the pre-fire season in the inter-annual variability of burnt areas in the Mediterranean basin. 

Furthermore, and taking into account the: 1) observed changes in Mediterranean droughts and 

drying trends in future projections; 2) previously discussed links between ridges and 

Mediterranean drought variability; 3) lack of studies addressing future changes in sub-tropical 

ridges (as opposed to the abundant literature about future blocking projections), a brief outlook 

and preliminary discussion of recent trends and future changes in sub-tropical ridges is provided 

by using models from the CMIP5 project.  

 

Methods 

The European Fire Database (EFD) is employed to characterize the southern European wildfires 

responses to blocking and ridges. The role played by preceding and immediate blocking/ridges in 

burnt areas is assessed separately by exploring both the pre-fire and the active (summer) fire 

seasons. Due to the pre-conditioning of soil moisture deficits in fire vulnerability, particular 

attention is paid to quantify the links between blocking/ridges and droughts by using the recently 

developed Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The spatial correlation 

coefficients between droughts and atmospheric patterns (at different time scales) are also 

considered, in order to account for the feedbacks between winter-spring droughts and summer 

temperature extremes. Finally, an overview of recent (1950-2012) trends in ridge frequency over 

the Euro-Atlantic sector is performed, in order to explore potential difficulties in thresholds 

calibration for the ridge detection in CMIP5 GCMs. 

 

Results 

Blocking/ridge patterns exert an important effect on wildfire spatial extension at different time 

scales. During the pre-fire wet season, reduced blocking (increased ridge) frequency is associated 

with below average precipitation in southern Europe, thus promoting drought conditions and 

enhancing vegetation fire vulnerability in the following summer. Furthermore, during the fire 

season itself, these atmospheric patterns, and in particular summer ridges, impinge hot and dry 

conditions, which foster fire spread. The solely occurrence of anomalous blocking/ridge activity 

in either the pre-fire or the active fire season is not enough to explain the large inter-annual 

variability of burnt areas, and both conditions are required to account for the worst fire years in 

different southern European countries.  

In the last decades, the frequency of sub-tropical ridges has increased in the Mediterranean areas. 

Future warming climate projections suggest additional increases along with the northward 

expansion of the sub-tropical high-pressure belt. However preliminary analyses reveal some 

limitations of the detection method used for ridges implying  a clear need to develop new 

dynamical detection schemes, rather than methods purely based on anomaly fields, in order to 

increase confidence in future projections of ridge frequencies.

5.1 Conclusions 
 

This thesis has addressed the seasonal impacts of atmospheric blocking in the Euro-Atlantic 

sector, with emphasis on regional and seasonal assessments that have often been overlooked in 

previous studies. Thus, a thorough characterization of blocking occurrence within different 

longitudinal sectors (Atlantic, European and Russian) was performed, prior to a comprehensive 

analysis of the associated climatic impacts of each blocking pattern over Europe, considering in 

particular the impacts on the precipitation and temperature distributions over distinct regional 

sectors. 

The assessment of blocking impacts led to an important conclusion about the necessity to 

distinguish the climatology and impacts of high-latitude blocking from those of sub-tropical ridges. 

In this context, a novel ridge detection scheme was developed in Chapter 2, and a catalogue with 

their occurrence was computed, in order to compare it against the blocking catalogue. While ridges 

are frequent precursors of wave-breaking that may evolve into Omega-type blocks, or Rex-type 

blocks in a later stage, these lower latitude structures do not require a wave-breaking as blockings 

do. More importantly, their dynamical structure, and the fact they are located further south, 

impinge very contrasting (sometimes opposite) conditions over Europe, when compared to blocks.  

Chapter 2 highlights the necessity to distinguish the latitudinal location of geopotential height 

maximum anomalies in order to assess their associated impacts on temperature (Sousa et al., 

2017b). In fact, this allowed to clarify that most summer extreme heat episodes in southern Europe 

and Mediterranean areas should not be attributed to blocking, but rather to ridges, contrarily to 

what previous studies had imprecisely stated. For central and northern areas of the continent, both 

regimes are responsible for warm episodes, as radiative heating and subsidence are enhanced under 

anomalously high geopotential values. Contrarily, during winter, the temperature impacts of 

blocking and ridges are opposite. While blocks (particularly those located in the eastern Atlantic 

and western/central Europe) favor cold winter spells by reinforcing the cold advection through the 

northerly flows established in their eastern flank, winter ridge patterns are associated to above 

average temperatures and mild Atlantic air masses induced by stronger zonal flows.    

A similar dichotomy was applied to the evaluation of the blocking impacts on European 

precipitation regimes in Chapter 3, by separating strong zonal flow and blocking regimes (Sousa 

et al., 2017a). Blocking patterns are associated with a clear north-south dipole consisting in 

negative (positive) precipitation anomalies in northern (southern) European areas. In the overall, 

these precipitation responses are explained by a blocking-induced split of the storm-track around 

its center location, which enhances cyclonic activity in southern Europe. However, increased 

atmospheric instability under such atmospheric configurations is additionally required to explain 

the reported increase in heavy precipitation over Mediterranean areas. During strong zonal flows, 

the precipitation anomaly pattern is essentially reversed, as compared to that of blocks. As ridges 

are associated with a stronger meridional pressure gradient north of their position (and a 

consequent enhancement of the zonal flow at higher latitudes), the precipitation signatures of sub-

tropical ridges are similar to those obtained for strong zonal flow patterns. Thus, an increased 



5. Conclusions and open threads for Future work 
 
 

138 
 

frequency of ridges leads to anomalously dry conditions in southern areas of the considered 

longitudinal sector of occurrence, particularly during winter. Finally, the results also suggest that 

the winter solid precipitation (snow covered soils) responses to blocking and ridges are better 

related to temperature than precipitation anomalies. Thus, while winter blocking occurrence leads 

to below average precipitation in large areas of central and northern Europe, the associated cold 

temperature patterns are in good agreement with the above-average observed responses in snow 

covered soil days over most European areas. On the opposite side, the mild winter conditions 

related to ridge occurrence inhibit snow cover in the European continent.   

The specific responses over the Iberian Peninsula were explored in Chapter 4 by using higher-

resolution datasets (Sousa et al., 2016). The results reveal regional signatures that are missed in 

coarser grids, particularly in what concerns the impact of topography in precipitation, hence 

confirming the need of high-resolution to address the regional and local responses to weather 

regimes. Thus, while blocking (strong zonal flow) is associated with increased (reduced) 

precipitation in most of Iberia, the northwestern tip of the Peninsula receives less (more) 

precipitation, in agreement with a reduced (increased) cyclonic frequency at higher latitudes and 

the resulting frontal activity that reaches this region. Blocking activity plays a crucial role on the 

precipitation regimes and the occurrence of heavy precipitation events in the southern half and the 

Mediterranean shores of Iberia. Regarding ridges, the results show that their impacts are more 

sensitive to the specific location of the sub-tropical ridge. In particular, ridges in the eastern 

Atlantic are strongly linked to the occurrence of dry and warm conditions over large parts of Iberia, 

thus leading to regional extreme summer temperature events. Furthermore, ridges located in the 

15W-15E sector are responsible for generalized winter dry conditions in Iberia, diminishing 

considerably the total annual rainfall observed in the area. 

 

5.2 Open threads for Future work 

The characterization of the specific regional impacts of blocking patterns in primary 

climatological variables, such as temperature and precipitation, provides an appropriate 

background for framing the impacts on other variables and on other background conditions (i.e., 

future climate). Some of these questions correspond to ongoing work, whose preliminary results 

will be included in this section.  

 In particular, Section 5.2.1 is devoted to drought variability, which is strongly dependent on 

anomalous conditions in both temperature and precipitation. As such, the links between 

blocking/ridges and droughts can be framed taking into account the specific temperature (Chapter 

2) and precipitation (Chapter 3) anomaly patterns associated to each regime. The decisive role of 

drought conditions in fire activity allows in turn an assessment of the possible impacts of blocking 

and ridges in wildfire inter-annual variability in southern European countries.  

Droughts and wildfires are issues of special concern in the Mediterranean, which has been 

considered as a climate change hot-spot. Thus, finally, Section 5.2.2 provides an overview of 

recent studies on observed trends and future changes in blocking. To our knowledge, there are not 



5. Conclusions and open threads for Future work

similar assessments for sub-tropical ridges, and hence, a substantial part of this section will focus 

on exploring recent trends in these systems. This will provide a first step to assess the projected 

changes in their occurrence and in the associated impacts, as a way to understand the contribution 

of changes in these weather regimes to the projected drying and warming of the Mediterranean, 

and the resulting threats to water availability (see the future perspectives in Section 5.3). The links 

between fires, drought occurrence, atmospheric circulation and climate change acquire special 

relevance in the Iberian Peninsula, which has been a central topic of this thesis. These questions 

were addressed in two papers developed during the PhD. within the scope of the European project 

FUME (Sousa et al., 2015; Trigo et al., 2013b). While they are considered outside the main scope 

of this thesis, their information is relevant for the ongoing work and the future perspectives, and 

hence, they have been included in the Annex. 

 

5.2.1 The feedbacks between blocking, droughts and wildfires 

Wildfire inter-annual and intra-annual variability in the Mediterranean area has been widely 

explored in recent decades (e.g. Pereira et al., 2005; Gudmundsson et al., 2014; Turco et al., 2017). 

It is well known that pre-conditioning (pre-fire season) may enhance vegetation stress, while the 

meteorological conditions during the peak of the fire season are the main trigger for fire ignitions 

(Pereira et al. 2013; Trigo et al., 2013b; Sousa et al., 2015; Gouveia et al., 2016; Amraoui et al., 

2015). The links between climate and fire are often analyzed under the intermediate fire-

productivity hypothesis (Pausas and Bradstock, 2006; Pausas and Paula, 2012), which suggests 

that fire risk oscillates between two minima, one dominated by high aridity conditions, under 

which fire spread is mostly limited by the fuel amount (Sousa et al., 2015a), and another 

characterized by low aridity, where fuels are abundant and fires are mainly limited by the soil 

moisture content (Ruffault et al., 2016; Turco et al., 2017). In fuel-limited ecosystems, antecedent 

wet conditions may regulate the fuel amount and its structure, while in relatively wet ecosystems, 

droughts and hot spells can influence dryness (Pausas and Paula, 2012).  

On the overall, in Mediterranean climates, the vulnerability to very large wildfires is well related 

with drought occurrence (Gouveia et al., 2016). As water availability in most of these areas is 

highly reliant on the rainfall amount accumulated during winter and spring, below average 

precipitation in the wet season is often related with vegetation stress in the warmer months 

(Pellizzaro et al., 2007; Gouveia et al., 2012; Turco et al., 2017). However, wetter than average 

late spring conditions following dry winters can trigger a rapid biomass growth in certain 

Mediterranean areas, such as western Iberia, also enhancing forest vulnerability in the case of a 

following dry and hot summer (Pereira et al., 2013). As such, Mediterranean-type climates can be 

considered “intermediate” ecosystems, where both soil moisture and fuel amount can play a role 

in shaping fire regimes (Pausas and Paula, 2012: Gudmunsson et al., 2014; Turco et al., 2017). 

In this context, we explore the links between blocking/ridge occurrence and wildfires in several 

southern European countries, using the European Fire Database (EFD – Camia et al., 2014), a 

database which assembles records for individual fire events from 21 countries of the European 

Union. The fire database covers slightly varying periods for each country spanning between the 



5. Conclusions and open threads for Future work

early 1980s and early 2010s. These links should be considered for different time-lags and temporal 

scales, as these atmospheric patterns may play an important role in extreme summer temperature 

conditions (as shown in Chapter 2), as well as in soil moisture pre-conditioning (i.e., drought 

conditions). 

To characterize drought conditions in Europe, the Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index 

(SPEI) developed by Vicente-Serrano et al. (2010) was employed. This is a multiscalar drought 

index based on climatic data (precipitation and temperature), which can be used for determining 

the onset, duration and magnitude of drought with respect to normal conditions in a variety of 

natural and managed systems such as crops, ecosystems, rivers, water resources, etc. It is available 

on a monthly basis with a horizontal resolution of 0.5º x 0.5º, and for different time-scales, 

spanning between 1 and 24 months. Here, the 6-month time-scale was considered, thus the SPEI 

index for May, at the end of spring (representing the accumulated hydrological imbalance through 

the winter and spring) was compared against the anomalous occurrence of blocking and ridges in 

the previous months. Figure 5.1 shows the correlation between the May SPEI for each gridpoint 

and the anomalous frequency of blocks/ridges during January-May in the three 30º longitudinal 

sectors.

The correlation coefficients are in relative good agreement with the previously discussed 

precipitation anomalies found for blocking (Section 3.1) and ridges (Section 3.3). The former

conditions in southern Europe, while the latter shows a reversed meridional dipole in SPEI. 

Focusing on southern European areas, ridges are the main precursor of drought conditions (and of 

the subsequent incremented vegetation stress) in the pre-fire season (Fig. 5.1, lower panels). These 

links show the leading role of anomalous precipitation patterns during the colder and usually wetter 

months in modulating drought conditions towards late spring and early summer. This assessment 

only accounts for the pre-conditioning of the large-scale circulation in the fire season vulnerability 

(i.e., the potential for severe summer wildfires). However, the actual fire activity is also dependent 

on the occurrence of a following hot summer, which in turn can be also associated to concurrent 

anomalies in the frequency of blocking/ridges, as shown in Chapter 2.  

To further check this dual role of precedent and current atmospheric patterns in the fire season 

itself, correlation coefficients were also computed between summer burnt areas in southern 

European countries (Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece) and: 1) the anomalous frequency of 

blocking/ridge patterns between January and May (the pre-fire season); 2) anomalous frequency 

of blocking/ridge patterns between June and September (the fire season). These results are shown 

in Tables 5.1 and 5.2, respectively.

 Results show some statistically significant correlations (at the 5% significance level), 

particularly for anomalous patterns during the fire season. For example, a significant correlation 

is found between summer ATL ridges and fires in Portugal, as expected from the anomalous 

temperature responses during such episodes (Section 2.1). However, in the overall, previous and 

contemporary meteorological conditions alone do not explain a large fraction of the burnt area 

variability. In this sense, and besides non-meteorological factors (such as land-use, fire prevention 

and suppression measures), it is possible to hypothesize that the role of the atmospheric circulation 



5. Conclusions and open threads for Future work 
 
 

142 
 

patterns in wildfires will maximize when both the anomalous frequencies of weather regimes 

during and before the fire season are considered simultaneously. This should help to explain a 

cumulative process which begins with winter and early spring atmospheric patterns promoting dry 

conditions, followed by summer synoptic conditions favoring regional warm temperatures, and 

thus fire ignitions. As a future work, this could be achieved by considering the conditional 

probability of fire activity subject to: 1) blocking/ridges in the previous season alone; 2) 

blocking/ridges in the fire season itself; 3) blocking/ridges in both seasons. Such analysis would 

also allow testing different combinations of weather regimes and seasons (e.g., less blocks in 

winter-spring and more ridges in summer). 

In this context, it is worth noticing that several authors have described the feedback between 

winter-spring soil dryness in transitional climatic regions and the enhancement of European 

summer heat episodes (e.g., Fischer et al. 2007; Vautard et al. 2007, Seneviratne et al., 2010). In 

addition, Quesada et al. (2012) reported that winter-spring dryness precedes European heatwaves 

only if anticyclonic conditions occur in summer, thus stressing the key role of summer high-

pressure systems. As a consequence, one should expect an enhanced summer fire risk if both 

conditions (preceding soil moisture deficits and summer high-pressure anomalies) are 

simultaneously met. To address this question, we computed the composites of late spring (May) 

SPEI and June-September Z500 anomalies for the most severe wildfire years (in terms of total 

burnt area) of each country (Fig. 5.2).

As it can be seen, there is an overall spatial agreement between the affected countries (in terms 

of burnt area) and both late spring soil moisture deficits (SPEI) and positive summer Z500 

anomalies, although with a number of regional nuances. Overall, it is reasonable to conclude that 

the worst fire seasons were accompanied by both preceding droughts and concurrent anticyclonic 

conditions in summer. However, it is important to acknowledge that these spatial patterns do not 

always occur over the considered country. For example, for the most severe fire years in Portugal, 

the summer high-pressure conditions and the preceding dryness occur over a large area of western 

and southwestern Europe. This may be explained by the findings of Vautard et al. (2007), who 

reported that winter soil moisture deficits in southern Europe tend to propagate towards central 

Europe throughout the following spring and summer. To check this hypothesis, we computed the 

composited monthly evolution of the SPEI index for the same set of severe years of each country 

(Fig. 5.3).

expansion of drought conditions along the western sectors of Europe from winter to summer. 



5. Conclusions and open threads for Future work 
 
 

144 
 

However, it should be stressed that the outstanding 2003 year (in terms of heatwaves and wildfire 

occurrence) could induce biases in the composite due to its outlier nature. In the remaining cases, 

the pattern does not show such a northward expansion, but a localized aggravation of the drought 

conditions throughout late spring and summer. In all the cases, the SPEI anomalies are observed 

since spring, being collocated with the following summer Z500 anomalies shown in Fig. 5.2. These 

results suggest a possible feedback of the drought conditions on the atmospheric circulation (e.g., 

Fischer and Schär 2009), highlighting the need for further investigation of this soil-atmosphere 

coupling. In summary, while an anomalous occurrence of blocking/ridges before and during the 

fire season influences fire vulnerability in southern Europe, they are not necessarily a sufficient 

condition. In most cases, a winter-spring soil moisture deficit pre-conditioning (strongly linked 

with reduced blocking and/or enhanced ridges) and the occurrence of summer ridges are both 

required to trigger wildfires. While these results may provide some prospects on developing useful 

seasonal predictions of wildfire occurrence, particular caution must be taken concerning their 

representativeness due to the exploratory nature of this work.     

 

5.2.2 Future scenarios of blocking variability in the 21st century 

In recent decades, General Circulation Models (GCM) have improved their capacity to reproduce 

global and regional climate variability (Flato et al., 2013), as well as observed meteorological 

fields, with ever increasing skill scores under weather forecast mode (Magnussen and Källen. 

2013). However, their relatively weak ability to reproduce the inception and duration of blocking 

patterns has been an undermining caveat through different generations of GCMs (D’Andrea et al., 

1998; Scaife et al. 2010; Davini and D’Andrea, 2016). Taking into account the crucial impact of 

atmospheric blocking in the European climate, a good representation of its phenomenology in 

GCMs is required in order to increase confidence in future projections (Hoskins, 2013). The 

blocking underrepresentation in GCMs is particularly pronounced in the Euro-Atlantic sector, with 

different definitions and detection methods (e.g. anomalies versus flow reversal) being able to 

provide different quantitative results (e.g., Barriopedro et al. 2010b). In addition, Scaife et al. 

(2010) or Vial and Osborn (2012) attributed a large proportion of the diagnosed blocking errors to 

biases in the mean climate, particularly in the meridional gradient of the geopotential height fields. 

More recently, Davini and D’Andrea (2016) made a thorough inter-comparison between 

generations of models in the last 20 years. These authors show that, despite an overall improvement 

in GCMs, few advances have been made in blocking representation in the Euro-Atlantic sector. 

This latter work also corroborates findings from other authors (e.g. Berckmans et al. 2013, 

Matsueda et al., 2009; Anstey et al., 2013), which show that high-resolution models reduce the 

underestimation of blocking frequency, with the increase in the horizontal and vertical resolutions 

both playing an important role. Also recently, Pithan et al. (2016) suggested that the representation 

of large scale features such as jet-streams, blockings or storm-tracks can be improved by refining 

parameterizations of low-level drag.  

Concerning future projections, and despite a number of discrepancies, there is some agreement 

on a decreasing trend of blocking frequency in the North Atlantic under increasing Greenhouse 

Gases Concentrations (e.g., Barnes et al. 2012; Dunn-Sigouin and Son, 2013), accompanied by a 



5. Conclusions and open threads for Future work 
 
 

145 
 

small increase in central/eastern Europe and western Russia, suggesting a northeastward migration 

of blocking patterns (e.g. Sillman et al., 2009; de Vries et al., 2013). Other authors report an 

increase in prolonged blocks in the eastern Atlantic, particularly during winter (e.g. Mokhov et al. 

2014). In agreement with these authors, Ruti et al. (2014) reported an association between longer 

blocking episodes and anthropogenic forcing. 

Conversely, there have been no exhaustive studies regarding the projected changes in sub-

tropical ridges, at least for the Euro-Atlantic sector. Kent et al. (2011) examined the representation 

of the Australian sub-tropical ridge in CMIP3 models, and projected an increase in its intensity in 

the 21st century, with an extension of its influence towards higher latitudes, thus aggravating 

drought episodes in the area. These results are in agreement with the overall positive projected 

trends in geopotential heights at such latitudes associated to the expansion of the Hadley cell (Lu 

et al., 2007). 

Before exploring future changes, we analyze recent trends in the frequencies of sub-tropical 

ridges and high-latitude blocking over the Euro-Atlantic sector during the observational record. In 

Figs. 5.4 and 5.5, the time series of blocks and ridges frequencies occurring in each of the three 

considered longitudinal sectors (ATL, EUR and RUS) and the associated linear trends are depicted. 

This analysis was undertaken for the calibration period (1950.2012) and using the NCEP/NCAR 

reanalysis.

Fig. 5.5 Same as Fig. 5.4, but for summer. 

 

The analysis suggests a marked increase in the frequency of sub-tropical ridges in all sectors 

throughout the reference period (1950-2012). On the contrary, blocking frequencies have remained 

relatively stable, with only a slight decreasing frequency in winter EUR blocks (Fig. 5.4, upper 

panel, red line). This indicates more frequent and persistent northwards extensions of the sub-

tropical high pressure belt, in good agreement with the aforementioned projections for the 21st 

century. Taking into account the temperature and precipitation impacts of ridges presented in 

Chapters 2 and 3, these results suggest a potential link between the warming and drying 

Mediterranean climate in the turning of the 20th century and the more frequent occurrence of ridge 

patterns. 

In order to obtain a preliminary insight into future projections of sub-tropical ridges, a set of 

GCMs from the CMIP5 project (which are frequently referenced in recent literature) was used 

(BCC, CanESM2, EC-Earth, GFDL, IPSL, MPI, MRI and NorESM1), considering the RCP4.5 

and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. As stated in Chapter 1, the analysis of future projections using 

anomaly-based detection methods is hampered by the definition of a baseline period and a 

threshold criterion, due to the presence of a constantly changing climatology (e.g., Barriopedro et 

al. 2010b). In order to quantify this potential effect, the 30-year running evolution of the Z500 

median and the 80th percentile was computed in all boxes considered for the ridge detection (see 

Section 2.3). Figs. 5.6 and 5.7 show these changes between 1950 and 2100, for winter and summer, 

respectively.

Fig. 5.6 Z500 median (upper panel) and 80th percentile (lower panel) in the southern (upper lines) and 

northern (lower lines) boxes defined for ridge detection in the ATL (blue), EUR (red) and RUS (green) 

sectors. Thick lines represent the mean of all models and scenarios, while thin dashed lines represent 

the RCP8.5 (upper dashed lines) and RCP4.5 (lower dashed lines) separately. The thick dashed black 

lines left of the vertical line represent the values for the 1950-2012 period of the NCEP/NCAR 

reanalysis dataset. 

 

The results indicate steady positive trends for both boxes throughout the entire period and for all 

scenarios. Summer increases (Fig. 5.7) in the median and 80th percentiles of Z500 are more 

marked, especially in the last decades of the 21st century and for the southern boxes, where ridges 

are detected. Winter changes (Fig. 5.6) are smaller, but once again larger for the 80th percentile 

than for the median. The Z500 increases at lower latitudes are in agreement with the northward 

expansion of the sub-tropical high pressure belt expected in a warming climate (Lu et al., 2007). 

In spite of this, from a dynamical perspective, the generalized Z500 increases do not necessarily 

involve a rise in the frequency of ridges or blocks. In fact, as mentioned before, blocking structures 

detected using a flow-reversal scheme actually show future declining trends. As far as ridges’ 

detection is concerned, and considering that the approach based purely on anomalies does not 

require a wave-breaking, the projected changes in Z500 may relate to: 1) a generalized northward 

migration of the sub-tropical high pressure belt and/or; 2) an actual increase in the number of ridge 

structures.

Fig. 5.7 Same as Fig. 5.6 but for summer. 

 

Taking into account the non-dynamical nature of our approach, this disentanglement cannot be 

achieved in such a framework. In order to deal with these Z500 trends, one may consider time-

varying thresholds in the ridge detection scheme by using moving reference climatological periods 

(as shown in Figs. 5.6 and 5.7). However, the results of this approach do not reveal consistent 

trends in the frequencies/locations of ridges (not shown) among the considered models, neither 

between scenarios or different sectors. Furthermore, a similar approach, but considering a fixed 

threshold (1950-2012) for ridge detection, resulted in exaggerated increases by the late 21st century 

(above 70%). In this sense, we conclude that at least from an anomaly-based detection scheme, no 

further considerations about future projections of ridges may be made with confidence. Thus, there 

is a need for a dynamical approach in the ridge detection, such as latitudinal/longitudinal Z500 

gradients (similar to those developed for blocking detection) in order to consider future projections 

with a higher level of reliability.

5.3 Perspectives 

The estimation of uncertainties in decadal predictability and long-term future climate projections 

has been widely debated in the literature, particularly at the regional scale. Natural climate 

variability imposes inherent limitations to climate predictability and consequently to adaptation 

guidance (Deser et al., 2012). In this context, Shepherd (2014) stresses the distinct roles played by 

thermodynamic and dynamical changes in future climate projections. Whereas the confidence in 

changes controlled by thermodynamics is high, the same is not valid for circulation dynamics, 

which exert a strong control on regional climates. As a consequence, projections of meteorological 

fields that are strongly dependent on atmospheric circulation (e.g., precipitation) display large 

spread, as a consequence of different types of uncertainty (model, scenario, internal variability). 

Low-frequency internal variability and the sensitivity of the circulation response to model errors 

and climatic forcings are the main sources of uncertainty. The work by Horton et al. (2015) 

indicates that even though a significant portion of the observed changes in extreme temperatures 

results from regional and global-scale thermodynamic changes, changes in the frequency, 

persistence and duration of regional circulation patterns, including European blocking, acquire 

high relevance to explain recent changes at regional scales. Also, the rapid warming of the Arctic 

region (twice as fast as the global average) is happening at a pace greater than that simulated by 

climate models. The possible link between this Arctic amplification and an increase of extreme 

mid-latitude weather events (including both cold winters and summer heatwaves), as discussed by 

Cohen et al. (2014) and Comou et al. (2015), stresses the need to better understand the dynamical 

responses to changes in the external forcings. 

In the context of the uncertainties associated with the large-scale dynamic component, a large 

effort was devoted in this work to disentangle blocking from ridge phenomena, as this will be 

increasingly necessary for modelling purposes. As a consequence, the analysis of future 

projections of both weather regimes, and the associated changes in their impacts, constitute one of 

the most immediate applications of the future work. Since the method developed for ridge 

detection is purely based on anomaly fields, it is necessary to acknowledge its limitation to 

interpret future changes from GCM projections. On the other hand, we are aware that blocking and 

ridge life cycles are not at all detached. In fact, and as described in Chapter 1, they often represent 

different stages of the life cycle of planetary wave-breaking occurrence. As such, the prospect of 

combining blocking and ridge detection schemes into a more unified algorithm capable of 

describing such life cycles constitutes a major line of future work, directly related with the 

achievements of this thesis. 

In another context, and taking into account the substantial blocking impacts reported in this thesis, 

the exploration of the blocking responses to external forcings represents a very tangible topic of 

interest. Various authors have reported links between blocking and remote oceanic patterns (e.g., 

ENSO; http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/blocking/enso/enso_stratification.shtml), 

decadal modes of oceanic variability (e.g., Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; Martinez, 2014) and 

other external forcings (e.g., solar forcing; Barriopedro et al. 2008). Thus, a deeper knowledge of 

such links could represent a huge step in terms of seasonal-to-decadal predictability in extratropical 

latitudes.

In this  work  we developed  projections  for  future  fire regimes  in the  Iberian  Peninsula  using outputs  from
Regional  Climate  Model  (RCM)  from  the  ENSEMBLES  project.  Wildfires  are  the  cause  of  major  ecological
and economic  impacts  in  this  region,  and  the increasing  evidence  of climate  change  consequences  in
this  region  raises  concerns  on  the  future  impacts  of fires  in  the  Iberian  forests  ecosystems.  Our  results
confirm  that  the  inter-annual  variability  of  total  burnt  area  is mainly  controlled  by  meteorological  condi-
tions, in  spite  of the  current  efforts  for fire  control  and  suppression.  We  also  show  that  this  meteorology
dominance  over  fire  activity  is not  only  true  during  the  fire season  itself,  but  also  that  certain  specific  mete-
orological  backgrounds  (such  as prolonged  droughts)  may  enhance  the risk  for  severe  wildfire  episodes  in
some areas.  Based  on  a previous  classification  of  the  Iberian  Peninsula  into  four  distinct  pyro-regions,  we
developed  statistical  models  which  reproduce  about  two  thirds  of the  inter-annual  variability  of  the burnt
area,  using  meteorological  variables  as  predictors  (calibrated  with  data from  the  ERA-Interim  reanaly-
sis).  Specific  models  were  developed  for each  sub-domain,  testing  their  robustness  for  extrapolation
under  climate-change  conditions.  Using  an  ensemble  of  state-of-the-art  RCM  future  climate  scenarios,
we  present  future  BA  projections  considering  two  alternative  techniques  of  statistical  correction  of model
data often  used  in  climate  change  impact  studies:  (1) unbiasing  method;  (2)  delta  change  method.  Our

. Introduction

Wildfires are not a recent hazard in the Iberian Peninsula;
evertheless, it is unquestionable that some of the most dramatic
pisodes have occurred since the turning of the century, partic-
larly in western Iberia. The years of 2003 and 2005 correspond

o landmark fire seasons in the fire history of Portugal, being
esponsible for the highest values of burnt area (hereafter, BA)
ince 1980 (Trigo et al., 2006; Pereira et al., 2011). Likewise, in the

contiguous northwestern Spanish province of Galicia, the year of
2006 was  characterized by a very high number of fires and large
burned area (San-Miguel-Ayanz et al., 2013). It is well known the
important human role on the shaping of fuel availability, which
has a great impact in fire activity in Mediterranean ecosystems
(de la Cueva et al., 2006; Costa et al., 2010; Pausas and Fernández-
Mun?oz, 2012). Some Iberian fire prone areas, such as the eastern
coast of Spain (e.g. Valencia, Murcia, Catalonia) have witnessed a
significant decrease of summer wildfire since the mid-90s, partly
attributable to significant improvements in fire prevention and
suppression schemes (Turco et al., 2013), taken after some of the

worst fire occurrences in the region.

Nonetheless, apart from the anthropogenic influence and in
spite of the fire suppression efforts in the Euro-Mediterranean
areas, meteorological drivers play a key role in modulating the

nter-annual variability of BA (Bedia et al., 2014), which is strongly
ontrolled by summer meteorological conditions (Pereira et al.,
005; Trigo et al., 2006, 2013), specially during drought episodes
Pausas and Fernández-Mun?oz, 2012; Gouveia et al., 2012), and to

 lesser extent by previous precipitation, as antecedent conditions
ffect primary productivity (and hence fuel availability, Koutsias
t al., 2013). In this regard, the recent work by Trigo et al. (2013)
hows that this variability can be fairly well reproduced by sta-
istical models based solely on meteorological variables. Despite
ignificant and costly efforts in prevention and suppression made in
ecent years by national authorities, the recent rise in the frequency
f extreme hot events (Ramos et al., 2011) and drought episodes in
he Iberian area (García-Herrera et al., 2007; Sousa et al., 2011),
as made its toll in scarring Iberian forests, as for instance, during
pisodes such as the mega-heatwave that affected western Europe
n 2003 (Trigo et al., 2006; García-Herrera et al., 2010), most often
elated with the occurrence of large atmospheric blocking episodes
Trigo et al., 2005; Barriopedro et al., 2011). Such episodes lead
o extremely dry atmospheric conditions that favor fire ignitions
ver a vegetation under hydric/hydrological stress and very low
uel moisture content.

The strong meteorological forcing over fire regimes raises seri-
us concerns on the future of the Mediterranean basin forests, as
ost Global and Regional Climate Models (hereafter GCMs and

CMs) project an important warming in these areas (Brands et al.,
011, Ramos et al., 2011; Frias et al., 2012) leading to an increased
re danger potential (Bedia et al., 2013, 2014). Significant changes

n precipitation regimes should also be expected, mainly in monthly
ean precipitation and intra-annual variability, characterized by

ess precipitation outside the winter season, as well as a ten-
ency toward more extreme events (Giorgi and Lionello, 2008;
rgüeso et al., 2012). To address this issue, several authors have
ttempted to explicitly model future BA series based on differ-
nt climate change scenarios (Carvalho et al., 2007; Pereira et al.,
013; Amatulli et al., 2013). Regardless of the method used and the

nherent model uncertainties, all approaches consistently point to
 much higher future BA.

It is widely recognized that RCM outputs cannot be directly
pplied in impact studies due to the biases inherited from the driv-
ng GCM (see e.g. Turco et al., 2013b), as well as those introduced
y the regional climate model (RCM) as a result of different model
rrors and parameterizations (c.f., Christensen et al., 2008; Herrera
t al., 2010). Thus, a validation/calibration process is needed before
sing this data in impact applications. This process requires the
vailability of historical data (or high-resolution reanalysis) to
alibrate the model outputs in a particular region of interest.
esides, climate models present some difficulties in realistically
epresenting intrinsic variability, a fact which may  hamper future
rojections, especially for those variables in which daily scale pro-
esses are dominant. Different bias correction methods have been
roposed and tested in the literature to adjust model biases and/or
aily variability using observations, being the unbiasing and delta
ethods (Déqué, 2007) the most simple and popular ones. On

he one hand, the unbiasing method (hereafter BC) operates by
ust modifying the mean magnitude of the future simulation by
ubtracting the difference of the control simulation and the corre-
ponding control observations (generally on a monthly basis), thus
ot affecting the distributional properties of the simulated series.
n the other hand, the delta change method (henceforth DCM) uses

he control (daily) observations of the target variables as the future
aily baseline, adapting their mean state and variance according to
he projected (monthly) model changes, thus preserving the daily

ariability associated to the observed meteorological variables. This
echnique has been previously applied in the context of wildfire
esearch (Flannigan et al., 2013) although comparative studies of
oth approaches in the framework of wildfire research are lacking
t Meteorology 202 (2015) 11–25

to date. In this study, we investigate both types of model correction
techniques for the estimation of future BA in the Iberian Peninsula.

The aim of this study is the generation of plausible future BA sce-
narios for the Iberian Peninsula in order to ascertain the potential
impacts of climate change on wildfires. To this aim, the following
steps are addressed:

(1) We  analyze the relationships between inter-annual variabil-
ity of observed BA and meteorological conditions, in particular
the meteorological patterns associated with intense wildfire
seasons;

(2) We  develop statistical regression models capable to reproduce
the inter-annual variability of BA series during the 1981–2005
control period, testing them with control simulation data from
a set of state-of-the-art RCMs from the EU-funded project
ENSEMBLES (van der Linden and Mitchell, 2009).

(3) We  assess the uncertainty of the future projections derived
from the bias correction technique by comparing the projected
BA results after using either BC or DCM methods.

The manuscript is structured as follows:
The datasets and methodologies used are presented in Sec-

tion 2 while an outlook at the control period fire climatology of
Iberia and of each sub-domain is performed in Section 3. The links
with meteorology, the development of the statistical model using
observed data, the performance of RCMs simulations for the control
period and the projected future scenarios are presented in Section
4. Finally, the discussion of the obtained results and used methods
are found in Section 5.

2. Data and methods

2.1. Fire data

Portuguese fire data was obtained from the Autoridade Flore-
stal Nacional (Pereira et al., 2011), while Spanish data was  obtained
from the Dirección General de Biodiversidad (Mérida et al., 2007).
Building on both databases, we used the recent joint Iberian wildfire
database (Trigo et al., 2013), encompassing their common period
1981–2005. Monthly BA time series are spatially disaggregated by
(66) Continental administrative regions (hereafter AR), that cor-
respond to (18) Distritos in Portugal, and (48) Provincias in Spain
- (excluding the Atlantic archipelagos). We  also computed the
monthly Normalized Burnt Area (NBA) for each AR, defined as the
quotient between the amount of BA in each AR and the correspond-
ing area of the AR (Fig. 1).

Despite the important inter-annual variability, the northwest-
ern sector of Iberia presents the highest rates of NBA in most years.
Years 1981, 1985, 1989, 1995 and specially 2005 stand out as par-
ticularly severe in this sector, with annual NBA above 25‰ for a
large number of AR. On the other hand, the years of 1991, 1995,
2003 and 2004 were particularly harsh in southwestern regions
of the Peninsula. The Mediterranean area is also prone to some
dramatic wildfire summers, namely before 1995. In contrast with
other regions where summer fires explain most of the annual NBA,
a well defined late winter or early spring fire season is found in the
northernmost areas of Iberia (with similar magnitude compared to
summer months), as shown in Fig. 2. In fact, this earlier peak is
also found in northwest Iberia, but in this case, much smaller in
magnitude when compared to the mean summer NBA. These dif-

ferent fire regimes have also been addressed in a preceding work
(Trigo et al., 2013), where a cluster analysis allowed the identifica-
tion of four spatially homogeneous pyro-regions (Fig. 2): northwest
(NW CLU), southwest (SW CLU), north (N CLU) and east (E CLU).

cale) allows a better characterization of the specific daily weather
onditions in each of the four Iberian sub-regions. Given the high
umber of variables and time resolution (6-hourly) of the reanaly-
is data, we applied a pre-selection procedure based on correlation
nalysis between time series of BA and meteorological variables,
dentifying 12UTC 2m air temperature (hereafter, T), 12UTC 500 hPa
eopotential height (hereafter, Z) and daily precipitation (hereafter,
) as the preferred candidate predictors. Mean sea level pressure
hereafter, MSLP) series were also considered, but only for drawing
ynoptic charts.

.3. Future climate projections

We  used the RCM simulations of the ENSEMBLES project (van
er Linden and Mitchell, 2009). From all available models, we
elected a subset of four RCMs (Table 1) which presented satisfying
esults in the objective evaluation procedure of the RCM perfor-
ance over Portugal and Spain (Soares et al., 2012; Herrera et al.,

010). The RCM simulations cover for a control period (1981–2001)
nd the future scenario simulations extend until 2100 in most
ases, with a horizontal spatial resolution of about 25 km (Chris-
ensen et al., 2010). Since the ERA-Interim training period spans
rom 1981 to 2005, and in order to obtain verification series with
he same length for each RCM, forcing data from the A1B scenar-
os was used during the last four years, completing the small gap
or 2002–2005. These simulations for the control period were used
rstly to compare the performance of RCMs against ERA-Interim

n modeling past BA series, and secondly to calibrate the statisti-
al models before using them to project future scenarios of BA.  In
his study, we have considered the future time slices 2001–2025,
026–2050 and 2051–2075.

.4. Forward stepwise regression models

From the pre-selected pool of potential predictors (see Section
.2), a forward stepwise regression analysis was performed in order
o reproduce BA values for each cluster. This method tests all pos-
ible predictors, maintaining those that explain more variance of
he predictand (BA) time series, following a standard procedure in
tmospheric sciences (Wilks, 2011). During this process, the algo-
ithm tests all combinations of predictors in order to exclude the
edundant ones, thus avoiding the problem of multicollinearity
Alin, 2010; Garg and Tai, 2012; Kraha et al., 2012), which may
amper model interpretability.

The robustness of the statistical models was tested by perform-
ng a 5-fold cross-validation scheme to each cluster’s model (c.f.,
upplementary Material – S1). This validation is crucial as non-
obust models can be highly biased by outliers and, therefore, an
verestimation on the performance metrics would exist. An addi-
ional precautionary step was taken forcing all models to retain

 predictors at most (the most correlated with BA amongst the
redictors chosen by the forward stepwise regression). These two
recautions were taken since the time series are only 25 years

ong (1981–2005), and short training series carry the danger of
verfitting when too many predictors are considered in the model
Hurvich and Tsai, 1989; Hawkins, 2004).

In addition, BA series in E CLU are not homogeneous, presenting
igher values prior to the early 1990s with a peak-point in the year
994, and decreasing significantly afterwards (Fig. 3. See also Turco
t al., 2013), thus requiring the application of a correction factor
aking into account the two periods separately (discussed in Section

.2).

In order to check model performance, we used four measures
f goodness of fit (Wilks, 2011), namely the mean absolute error
MAE), the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (?sp), the adjusted
t Meteorology 202 (2015) 11–25

explained variance (r?2), and the skill score against the climatology
(SS),  being the latter two  metrics given by Eqs. (1) and (2):

r?2 = 1 ? n ? 1
n ? (k + 1) (1 ? r

2) (1)

SS =
RMSE ? RMSEref

RMSEperf ? RMSEref
× 100 (2)

where n is the sample size, k is the number of predictors and r
is the Pearson correlation coefficient. RMSEref is the root mean
square error of the climatology series – a perfect model would have
RMSEperf equal to 0.

Finally, the robustness assessment undertaken also seeks to
ascertain if the linear models developed can be confidently applied
for extrapolation, at least under “moderate” climate change (warm-
ing) conditions. The approach is described in detail in Gutiérrez
et al. (2012), and it is essentially based on working with anomalous
warm historical periods as proxies of future climate change condi-
tions in order to test the ability of the models to reproduce warmer
periods outside the learning space of the model. More specifically,
the warm period is taken out from the training data and used to
test the resulting model (c.f., Supplementary Material S1).

2.5. RCM data biases and distributions

It is widely recognized nowadays that, despite the improved
confidence in regional climate model simulations (Herrera et al.,
2010; Maule et al., 2013; Ehret et al., 2012; Teutschbein and Seibert,
2012), RCMs still reveal some limitations when attempting to rep-
resent present climate (e.g. biases and unreliable variances). In
order to understand the ability of each chosen RCM to reproduce
the present climate in the Iberian domain, a series of procedures
were applied and some statistical metrics were computed, for each
pyro-region of the Iberian Peninsula, and for different model out-
put correction methods. In particular, two different simple bias
correction techniques have been considered (the unbiasing and
delta change methods, BC and DCM, respectively; Déqué, 2007) as
detailed in the following sections.

2.5.1. The unbiasing method
The simplest bias correction procedures consist in removing

the difference between the means and the ratio of the variabil-
ity between observed and simulated time series obtained for the
reference period (Huntingford et al., 2006; Ines and Hansen, 2006).
However, this approach has several caveats: (1) corrections in the
variability will only work well for variables with Gaussian distri-
butions (e.g. temperature, geopotential height) and not for heavily
tailed distributions (e.g. precipitation); (2) the intrinsic daily vari-
ability of each RCM will be kept, meaning that although means and
standard deviations can be controlled, poor reproductions of the
observed daily variability will subsist using this method.

Nevertheless, because this is the most widely used approach
adopted by modelers we decided to maintain this simple bias cor-
rection as a benchmark correction procedure. Taking into account
these factors, the following BC was  applied to the pre-selected
variables (as referred in Section 2.1) to obtain future series of tem-
perature (3), geopotential height (4) and precipitation (5):

Tunbiased(t,m) = TRCMfut(t,m) +
(

TERActl(m) ? TRCMctl(m)
)

(

ZERActl(m) ? ZRCMctl(m)
)

(4)
( )
Punbiased(t,m) = PRCMfut(t,m) + PERActl(m)/PRCMctl(m) (5)
The subscripts RCM and ERA correspond to Regional Climate

Model and ERA-Interim reanalysis, respectively; the subscripts ctl
and fut refer to the control (1981–2005) and any considered future

.5.2. The delta change method
In our statistical models the most important predictors are sam-

led at daily scale, and therefore the poor representation of daily
ariability using the traditional bias correction may  hamper the
esulting BA models. To overcome this drawback, the DCM has
een used in recent years to simulate future meteorological time
eries based on RCM outputs when the daily variability is of crucial
mportance (e.g. Hawkins et al., 2013; Ruiter, 2012). The main dis-
inction in this approach consists in correcting observed time series
n order to adjust them to expected forthcoming changes, rather
han correcting raw RCM output series. This process enables the

onstruction of future time series which preserve observed daily
ariability. Naturally, this approach does not address significant
hanges in the nature of the daily variability regimes, but still, both
ean and variability can be adjusted to obtain the future series.

Jacob et al. [2001]

Once again, changes in the mean are easy to obtain while changes
in the standard deviations are only simple to perform with near
Gaussian distributions. The future time series of temperature and
geopotential height using the DCM are obtained using the following
expressions:

Tdelta(t,m) = TRCMfut(m) +
?TRCMfut (m)

?TRCMctl (m)
(TERActl(t,m) ? TRCMctl(m)) (6)

Zdelta(t,m) = ZRCMfut(m) +
?ZRCMfut (m)

?ZRCMctl (m)
(ZERActl(t,m) ? ZRCMctl(m)) (7)

where the nomenclature of Eqs. (3)–(5) was  adopted and the sym-
bol ? corresponds to the standard deviations for each particular
period.

As stated before, in the case of precipitation, transforming the

standard deviation of the series is not a simple and particularly
effective task, as the precipitation series distribution is heavily one
side tailed. To obtain future series of daily precipitation using the
delta change method we had to perform several steps. The first was

o make a delta change correction to the daily precipitation series
f ERA-Interim, but only rectifying the mean:

delta(t,m) = PERActl(t,m) + ( ¯PRCMfut(m)/ ¯PRCMctl(m)) (8)
This process enables changes in the mean precipitation, but at

his point it totally discards changes in the intra-monthly variability
f the series. To address this issue, rather than trying to correct the
tandard deviations of such a non-Gaussian distribution we opted
o correct the number of dry days. For that purpose, we first calcu-
ated the ratio of future change of dry days for each month in each
CM, and corrected the expected number of future dry days in each
pecific month:

RYdelta(m) = DRYERActl(m) ×
(

¯DRYRCMfut(m)/DRYRCMctl(m)
)

(9)

Once more, all subscripts meaning is the same as in the previ-
us equations. The difference between the expected and observed
umber of dry days in each particular month (D) corresponds to the
umber of lowest precipitation days in each month that is forced to
ave zero precipitation, in order to obtain the expected number of
ry days estimate in each month from (9). Naturally this forcing will
hange the total precipitation of the month, resulting in this value
eing slightly above (below) the expected in the case of removing
adding) dry days to the original series. This excess (lack) of precip-
tation is then equally distributed (removed) from the remaining
ainy days of the month. The resulting series will permit to have
onthly climatologies that present the mean and number of dry

ays, as expected from (8) and (9).

.5.3. The observed-simulated distributions comparison
Model biases for each meteorological variable, month and spa-

ial sub-domain were verified and removed from the series for the
ontrol period (1981–2005). Then, distributions of BA simulated
sing ERA-Interim data and RCM outputs were compared with the
istribution of observed BA series for the control period, in order to

dentify which RCM models simulate better the present fire clima-
ology and may  provide greater confidence when simulating BA for
uture scenarios.

To compare the similarity between time series of meteoro-
ogical variables or BA from two different models or sources, we
heck the agreement between their probability distributions, to
ccount for differences in the mean and in higher order moments.
wo skill scores were used for this purpose: the two-sample
olmogorov–Smirnov test (KSstatistic) and the PDFscore (Brands et al.,
012).

The KSstatistic is a non-parametric test used to check the null
ypothesis that two separate samples come from the same the-
retical distribution. The KSstatistic is defined as follows:

Sstat =
2n

max

i = 1

??F (zi) ? G(zi)
?? (10)

where n is the length of the time-series, F and G are the empir-
cal cumulative frequencies of each time-series, and zi denotes the
th data value of the sorted joined sample. The KSstatistic is bounded
etween 0 and 1, and high distributional similarity is indicated by

ow values. Serial autocorrelation must be addressed when com-
uting the KSstatistic, leading to an effective smaller sample size n*,
btained using the following expression:

? = n 1 ? p1
1 + p1 (11)
here p1 is the lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient.
The PDFscore is a measure of agreement between two  distri-

utions, where the common overlapping of the two probability
ensity functions (PDFs) is calculated. The PDFs are estimated using
t Meteorology 202 (2015) 11–25

a number (N) of equally spaced bins, here defined as by Shimazaki
and Shinomoto (2007). The two  normalized PDFs are then com-
pared as follows to obtain the PDFscore:

PDFscore =
N?

i=1
min

{
f (mi), (g(mi))

}
(12)

where f and g are the relative frequencies of each PDF, and mi is the
corresponding bin index. The PDFscore also spans between 0 and 1,
but contrary to the KSstatistic, a high degree of similarity between
the two  distributions corresponds to a score near 1. In order to
avoid the opposite scale direction of the two considered scores,
the value of 1 minus the KSstatistic (hereafter 1?KSstatistic) will be
presented instead. Thus, in both cases the degree of match between
distributions will always grow from 0 to 1.

3. Understanding the inter-annual variability of burnt
areas

The main drivers of inter-annual variability of burnt areas in
Iberia in the four considered clusters were identified by discrim-
inating the influence of pre-conditioning climatic conditions –
i.e., the accumulated stress on vegetation, and the consequent
susceptibility during the fire season – and the meteorological con-
ditions that foster fire ignition and spread during the fire season
(Trigo et al., 2013). As stated in Section 2.1, there is a very sim-
ilar peak near March in the NW CLU and N CLU, although quite
different in its relative importance on the annual totals. This fact
led us to focus only on the more representative season in terms
of BA activity in each region, for the sake of readability. The
main links between the inter-annual BA variability in each clus-
ter and meteorological forcing are next analyzed, in order to retain
the most relevant variables that correlate with BA series. This
procedure will enable to test and select the sub-set of meteoro-
logical indices which will be used to develop statistical regression
models.

3.1. Links with meteorological indices

The influence of selected meteorological fields (T, Z and P)
over BA series was tested using correlation analysis – performed
at monthly (considering inter-annual anomalies) and daily scales
(considering annual absolute values). For some meteorological
variables monthly anomalies are well correlated with Iberian BA
series (e.g. Pereira et al., 2005), still in some particular cases they
can mask some important daily-scale extreme weather episodes
which trigger large fires, but do not affect significantly the monthly
anomaly (Trigo et al., 2013). To account for these situations, we
computed monthly percentiles for each variable. Then, we cal-
culated monthly time series of the relative frequency of days
exceeding those percentiles. In the case of T and Z – to take into
account the occurrence of extremely hot days – we considered the
90th, 95th and 98th percentiles. In the case of P – with the attention
focused on the sequences of dry days – the application of the same
principle lead to the computation of monthly frequencies of days
where the mean precipitation in the whole cluster area was below
0.5 mm,  1 mm and 2 mm.

We computed the correlations (Pearson’s r) between BA and
monthly time series of anomalies or frequencies of extreme days
for each variable during the fire season months, and also from pre-
vious months (up to 7 months before). The results are shown in
Tables 2 and 3.
Table 2 is restricted to the links between BA and meteorological
conditions during the fire season, revealing favorable conditions
to trigger fire ignition and spread, regardless of the meteorolog-
ical background. As expected, results are dominated by monthly

requencies of high percentile exceedances of T, although frequen-
ies of dry days also grant important correlations in the E CLU and

 CLU. In the N CLU (where the focus is in early spring) the fre-
uency of days with extremely high values of Z is also positively
orrelated with BA,  meteorologically related with anomalous sta-
le, clear sky and dry conditions in March.

Concerning the months prior to the fire season (i.e. meteorolog-
cal background), rather different forcing is found for each cluster
Table 3). In the case of the NW CLU, the summer BA is signifi-
antly associated with above-average temperature in late spring
nd below-average precipitation in January and June, suggesting
hat drier-than-average winters and springs in this wet region
nhance vegetation vulnerability due to hydric stress, making it
ore susceptible to burn in the following summer (Chuvieco et al.,

999).
In the SW CLU, dry and warm conditions in late spring or

arly summer are also related with high values of BA.  But unlike
W CLU, a positive correlation between winter precipitation and

ummer BA series is found. This shows that for this drier region
f Iberia, above-average winter precipitation favors vegetation
rowth enhancing fuel availability in summer (Pereira et al., 2005;

rigo et al., 2013). In the N CLU, the most important meteorological
ackground influence is concentrated in the immediately preced-

ng month (February), when the meteorological variables highly
t Meteorology 202 (2015) 11–25 17

correlated with March BA are quite similar to the ones found in
Table 2, reinforcing the idea that high values of BA in the northern-
most sector of Iberia tend to be related with anomalous persisting
high-pressure systems (blocking episodes) over the region.

For the easternmost region (E CLU), we find three statistically
significant links, two  of them referring to below-average precipi-
tation in spring, which suggests that in this region the persistence
of dry conditions may  also enhance vegetation vulnerability during
the fire season. Nevertheless, the lack of significant links reduces
the prospects of using this type of background meteorological vari-
ables as good proxies for BA predictability in the E CLU. These
results unveil the crucial role of meteorological drivers on BA in
the Iberian Peninsula. This is particularly true for western sec-
tors (NW CLU and SW CLU), where one-predictor truncated models
(not shown), using only the monthly frequencies of days above the
95th and 98th percentiles of T, respectively, explain about 50% of
the inter-annual BA variability in the months of July and August.

3.2. Statistical hindcast models

Following the stepwise predictor selection procedure and the
additional restrictions presented in Section 2.2, the best performing
models obtained for each of the pyro-regions are described by the
following set of equations.

For the NW CLU:

BAJul+Aug = +581000 T pct95Jul+Aug ? 35000 PanomJul+Aug
+ (53300) ? 0.15 BAprev

For the SW CLU:

BAJul+Aug = +1920000 T pct98Jul+Aug

For the N CLU:

BAMar = +133000 (T pct90Mar × Zpct90Feb)

where indices pct90, pct95 and pct98 correspond to monthly fre-
quencies of exceedances for the corresponding percentiles (Section
3.1), while indices&amp;lt;0.5 mm and&amp;lt;1 mm correspond to monthly fre-
quencies of days with precipitation smaller than 0.5 mm and 1 mm,
respectively; anom indices refer to the monthly anomaly; the sym-
bol ? corresponds to an aggravating factor based on the number
of months with a deficit in rainfall; BAprev refers to a weighting of
the area burnt in the previous 3 years; the symbol # denotes a cor-
rection factor due to the existence of a break-point in the series (as
previously discussed in Section 2.4). The aggravation factor based
on the conditions of “accumulation of dry months” was  introduced
to take into account the hydric deficit inherited from antecedent
meteorological conditions.

In Figure 3, the resulting hindcast BA time series (using the ERA-
Interim reanalysis) are compared with the observed BA series for
each of cluster for the control period, including the model perfor-
mance metrics.
significantly better than the simpler persistence approach (Fig. 3).
Furthermore, all models explain more than 50% of the regional BA
reduced variance. This is particularly notable for the NW CLU and

W CLU, where the models are able to adequately reproduce excep-
ional years in terms of BA (2005 and 2003), attaining around a
0% of explained variance. Similar performance was attained in the

 CLU, but in this case the high performance of the models may  be
artially inflated by the nature of the series after 1994 – these were
ll years with very small BA totals, as indicated by the large diver-
ence between r2 and ?sp (being the latter metric insensitive to
he confronted variable magnitudes). Finally, the lowest scores are
ound in the N CLU (focused in March). Yet, some of the most severe
ears (in terms of observed BA in this region) were reproduced by
he model (e.g., 1990, 1997 and 2000). Furthermore, despite the
elatively low scores attained they still represent more than half of
he reduced variance. We  must stress that the values of BA series in
his region are about one order of magnitude below the ones found
n the remaining clusters.

.3. Synoptic forcing during severe wildfire episodes

Taking into account the strong meteorological forcing of BA
escribed in Section 3.2, and in order to distinguish the different
eteorological configurations that favor the occurrence of these

onditions, we computed composites of meteorological fields dur-
ng these extreme days. Composites were computed on the (T, Z
nd MSLP) meteorological fields (Fig. 4), providing an overview
f the typical synoptic patterns related with large fires in each
yro-region. Despite some differences, all four composites present

 common sharp positive T anomaly over most of southwestern
urope, with their maxima (regarding the IP) centered at the cor-
esponding pyro-region.

In the case of March fires in the N CLU, the composite (near
00 days) presents well above average T in all of Europe, asso-
iated to a very large positive anomaly of Z over France, also
xpressed at the surface level. This particular continental block-
ng configuration promotes subsidence over the region, and in
he particular case of northern Spain, brings a marked southerly
ow, with exceptionally dry and warm conditions down slope of
he Cantabrian Range (Foehn winds). Spatial patterns of the com-
osites for the remaining clusters reveal anomalous conditions
ore restricted to southwestern Europe, but with similar mag-

itude in T anomalies in the target areas, also intimately related
ith large positive anomalies of Z and MSLP. The position of the
ositive anomaly of Z fields during July and August and associ-
ted with fires in the E CLU is quite similar to the previously
eferred case, but smaller in magnitude, promoting the advec-
ion of warmer African air over Iberia. Trigo et al. (2013) stated
hat extremely hot days in the Mediterranean fac? ade require a
urface flow from west or northwest in order to cease mild Mediter-
anean breezes. Nevertheless, as seen in Section 3.2, the model for
his cluster suggests a stronger dependence on the lack of pre-
ipitation days during July and August as convective precipitation
n late summer is relatively frequent in the area. The obtained
omposite is highly compatible with the occurrence of prolonged
ry spells in the E CLU. NW CLU and SW CLU exhibit quite simi-

ar synoptic configurations. In both regions, large BA is driven by
xtreme dry and hot days, directly related with the location of
igh pressure systems in the Atlantic region between Iberia and
he British Isles. The main differences between the two  composites
re the tilting of the ridge and the surface pressure configuration.
he positive anomaly of Z is tilted westwards (eastwards) in the
ase of the NW CLU (SW CLU). The spatial location of the high-
st anomaly in T depends on the surface pressure configuration,
ortrayed by the position of the thermally induced low. In both

ases, easterly synoptic flows that attenuate Atlantic breezes are
equired.

The Z anomalies in the composites suggest the existence of
tlantic (continental) blocking in the cases of NW CLU and SW CLU
t Meteorology 202 (2015) 11–25

(N CLU and E CLU). It is rather difficult to classify the type of block-
ing pattern associated (i.e. Omega, Diffluent, etc.) since these maps
do not correspond to a few isolated days, but to composites ran-
ging between 50 and 100 days, depending on the case. This type of
approach naturally smooths meteorological fields as it can capture
different types of blocking events and configurations centered in
similar locations.

4. Future scenarios of burned area

4.1. RCM performance in the control period

The ability of each RCM to reproduce the observed distribu-
tion during the control period (1981–2005) was  based on two
metrics: the PDFscore and the KSstatistic. The validation results for
each individual meteorological variable analysis are presented as
Supplementary Material (S 2). Considering the hindcast models cal-
ibrated with ERA-Interim as the benchmark, the performance of the
considered RCMs modeling BA series for the control period was gen-
erally lower, most likely due to their poor representation of daily
variability (as highlighted in Section 2.3). The SW CLU is the only
region where the ERA-Interim performance on modeling BA series
is slightly overridden by the RCM models. On the contrary, the low-
est RCM performance occurred in the E CLU. The summary of all BA
models performance is summarized in Fig. S5 of the Supplementary
Material.

4.2. Future climate scenarios in Iberia

Before projecting future BA, we  assessed the predicted future
climatologies for the three future 25-year periods in each domain
(Tables 4–7), focusing on the meteorological variables used as pre-
dictors.

Obtained results reveal that in the northwestern sector of Iberia
all models project a rise of 2–3 ?C in T during the months of July
and August, while the standard deviation does not undergo signif-
icant changes (Table 4). These projections imply a larger frequency
of extremely hot days in the future, thus favoring larger BA.  It
was shown that in this pyro-region summer rainfall is also closely
related to BA (Section 3.2) and all RCMs projections suggest a
decrease in summer P (in most models near to 50%) during the 21st
century, particularly after 2050. Likewise, the projected number of
rainy days in the July–August period is projected to decrease nearly
a quarter by most models except for the REGCM3, where changes
in rainfall regimes are not so significant.

A similar sharp continuous increase in 12UTC July and August T
is projected for the SW CLU (about 4 ?C for the 2051–2075 period
according to the HADRM3Q0 and REMO models, Table 5). Values
of the standard deviation for the future T time series remain very
similar to the ones found for the control period. All models except
HADRM3Q0 suggest very few changes in the accumulated P during
February and May  (related to the available biomass in the following
summer) but show a decrease in the number of rainy days, unveil-
ing a drastic change of the precipitation regime, most accentuated
in the case of the HADRM3Q0 model projections (to about one third
in these months).

Concerning the N CLU (Table 6) and focusing on changes in late
winter or early spring climatology, an increase of the mean March
T, especially in the later period (2051–2075) is projected. However,
for the mid-21st century most models present mean values slightly
below the control period and a small increase in the standard devi-

ation, related to an increase in the variability of meteorological
conditions in this region. The exception is the HADRM3Q0 model,
which projects a continuous rise in T (of about 3 ?C during the whole
period) and a decrease in the mean February plus March P, as well

s on the number of rainy days. On the contrary, the HADRM3Q0
odel is the only to predict a decrease in P along with the steep

ise in T in this region of Iberia.
Finally, for the E CLU (Table 7), all RCMs project a continu-

us rise in T. The HADRM3Q0 model shows an increase larger
han 4 ?C, projecting the most accentuated warming trend in Iberia
mong all models analyzed. As in the other cases, no significant
hanges are expected for T standard deviation. The number of rainy
ays is expected to decrease according to all model simulations.
ADRM3Q0’s projections of mean P are almost 50% lower than for

he control period, with an also remarkable decrease in the number
f rainy days (from 37 to 26). The REGCM3 is the only model that
resents a small increase (2 mm)  in mean P, but once again, with
recipitation regimes being less regular, as the number of rainy
ays also decreases (8–14%).

.3. Modeling future fire regimes

Both BC and DCM correction methods were applied to each RCM
nd pyro-region in order to construct future BA series. One fur-
her experiment was performed to increase the number of tested
uture scenarios, consisting in two different methods of estimat-
ng the future predictors: (1) they all are calculated against the
xed 1981–2005 means and percentiles; (2) they are calculated
gainst each correspondent previous 25-year period means and
ercentiles. Naturally, the first method (hereafter, FIX CLIM) will
esult in more drastic trends in future BA series, while the second
ethod (hereafter, MOV  CLIM) will tend to ease those trends. This

econd approach was considered just as a simplistic way to emu-
ate a certain level of gradual adaptation to climatic changes, rather
han assuming that all other non-meteorological variables related
ith fires (vegetation dynamics, human factors, etc.) will remain
nchanged, as a result of the FIX CLIM approach.

The relative changes in the mean BA estimated for each cluster
fter BC (Fig. 5) or the DCM (Fig. 6) are represented by circular
reas, where inner and outer radius correspond to the two  predictor
stimation methods (MOV CLIM and FIX CLIM, respectively). These
hanges in future BA series are framed over axes that represent T

nd P changes during the simulation period, in order to facilitate
heir interpretation. The discussion of the obtained results will be
ocused mainly on the models which presented better scores in
eproducing BA series distribution in the control period.

All models and methods reveal positive trends in future BA in all
regions, but the dispersion amongst projections is quite significant.
As expected, results obtained with the FIX CLIM and MOV  CLIM
methods have important differences, with the latter presenting
lower changes in future mean BA. We  must recall that the pro-
jections in Fig. 5 reflect the intrinsic daily variability of the RCM,
reducing the confidence of model behavior for future scenarios.

In fact, in the NW CLU the projected negative change in P and
positive change T during summer results in a significant increase
in mean BA series. For example, considering the HADRM3Q0 and
REMO models and the FIX CLIM simulations, estimated relative
changes are above 500% (which corresponds to a trend of about
3800 ha year?1) and 400% (about 2800 ha year?1), respectively. The
trends in the MOV  CLIM simulations for these same models are
reduced to less than half, but still more than doubling the present
mean annual BA.  For the N CLU the rises in T drive important posi-
tive changes in BA,  albeit the slight increase in P projected by most
models. The RCM which performed better for this region in the con-
trol period (REGCM3) still projects four times more BA at the end
of the considered future period (300 ha year?1 trend) using the BC.
In the SW CLU, where RCM models performed slightly better than
ERA-Interim during the control period, relatively similar trends
in future BA were found. Using FIX CLIM simulations the rela-
tive changes range between 400% and 600% (3500–4500 ha year?1),
while using the MOV  CLIM simulations these trends decrease dras-
tically to one third. Finally, in the E CLU, we found comparable
trends amongst all models except the HADRM3Q0, which yielded
wildly large results (500% and 1000%), which seem unreliable in
the light of the results presented in Section 4.1. The BA relative
changes projected by the RACMO2 range between 250% and 350%
(ca. 850 ha year?1 and 1300 ha year?1).

Projected BA changes obtained with the DCM correction method
using FIX CLIM and MOV  CLIM experiments are more moder-
ate than in the case of BC. In the NW CLU, the HADRM3Q0
model projects BA changes ranging between 300% and 400%
(1500–2500 ha year?1 trends), while the REMO projects slightly
higher changes. In the N CLU, projections of BA using HADRM3Q0
model simulations are very high and quite different from all other

00% and 500% were found when using the FIX CLIM simulations,
ith a smaller decrease being found for the MOV  CLIM simulations

about half of the relative change projected with FIX CLIM). In the
 CLU, the significant rise in summer T associated with an impor-
ant decrease in summer P and number of rainy days (see Section
.2) may  explain the dramatic rate of change projected for BA,  even
sing the MOV  CLIM simulations. For example, BA projections with
ACMO2 outputs range between 500% and 800%, while with REMO
re between 700% and 900%. A change of 900% would correspond to

 trend of around 3600 ha year?1. These discrepancies found in dif-
erent scenarios, along with the inherent difficulty of constructing a
tatistical model due the presence of a significant break-point in the

ontrol period BA series raises major doubts on the its robustness,
o the results for this pyro-region should be looked cautiously.

Having such a large range of projected future scenarios, we
ecided to construct ensemble series for each cluster. This enables

us not only to summarize the expected trends in each region, but
also to quantify the dispersion amongst projections. A total of eight
projected members for each cluster were considered as a result of
using four RCMs and two bias correction procedures. The FIX CLIM
and MOV  CLIM simulations were considered separately by the two
different shadings in each panel of Fig. 7, having each one of these
simulations 8 members, as stated before.

The clearest outcome from these ensembles is the obvious
tendency of increment in mean annual BA in all Iberian regions,
regardless of the used methodology. As referred before, a more
sharp increase is found when future climatology is compared
directly against the control period (1981–2005). Comparing future
climatologies with moving reference states (lighter shades) natu-

rally brings a certain degree of relieve on the projected BA scenarios.
The Atlantic sector clusters (NW CLU and SW CLU) clearly present
a smaller dispersion amongst projections, a detail which is not par-
ticularly surprising. In fact, since the first stages of the construction

f these statistical models, it was evident that meteorology alone
xplained a larger part of the BA variability in these western clus-
ers. Consequently, the higher level of uncertainty found for future
A projections in the N CLU and E CLU is also not unforeseen. The

arge dispersion found in the upper part of the E CLU and N CLU
s driven by the HADRM3Q0 model, which presents the highest
ises in mean T in almost all areas, and also is the only model which
redicts a decrease in February and March P in northernmost areas.

Even though it is clear that different approaches result in a rela-
ively wide range of severity scenarios, the overall ensemble means
oint to about 2 or 3 three times more BA in most Iberian regions,
xcept for the northern fac? ade where the mean projections change
all slightly above a doubling factor.

. Concluding remarks

Our work has shown that statistical models which use monthly

requencies of exceedances of high percentiles of noon temperature
from the ERA-Interim dataset) as the key predictor can be quite
ffective in representing the inter-annual variability of burnt area
explaining more than two thirds of the variance in most areas).
ge method for future trends estimation.

This is a concise method to represent the most propitious condi-
tions for fire ignition and spread – sequences of abnormally hot
and dry days. Furthermore, these models recall the need to rely
on daily scale data in order to account for these short temporal
scale features, although larger time-scales prove to be sufficient
regarding the meteorological background. These results are partic-
ularly compelling for western areas of Iberia, where meteorology
alone is more crucial on wildfire activity (Trigo et al., 2013), while
in other areas external factors have a larger weight (Bedia et al.,
2014).

The role of atmospheric blocking on wildfire variability (Trigo
et al., 2006) was  scrutinized in each pyro-region, and our com-
posites show that the specific locations of high pressure anomaly
centers establish the direction of surface flows, thus distinguishing
the synoptics that originate inland dry and warm air advection in
each domain. In addition, the occurrence of a meteorological back-
ground marked by prolonged blocking events is directly related

with a higher vegetation stress that arises from prolonged dry spells
(Flannigan et al., 2000; Gedalof et al., 2005; Soja et al., 2007).

Future fire regime projections based on GCM or RCM out-
puts must be carefully considered, as besides the inherent model

ncertainties and projections spread, other confounding factors
xist (mainly anthropogenic, see e.g. King et al., 2013), and also
limate-vegetation feedbacks affecting burned area should be con-
idered (e.g. Krawchuk and Moritz, 2010; Pausas and Paula, 2012).
urthermore, the extent of the feedback on the concentration of
erosols, particulates and black carbon induced by an increased
patial and temporal frequency of wildfires is a quite significant
ssue, particularly on the perturbations which should be consid-
red on climate models (Lavoué et al., 2000; Gillett et al., 2004;
anderson et al., 2006; Hodzic et al., 2007; Sommers et al., 2014).
evertheless, the RCMs performance during our control period
ave us enough confidence to extrapolate them to a warmer period,
uch as expected in the upcoming decades. All our future pro-
ections point toward a significant rise in mean annual BA in all
yro-regions - ensembles future means between 200% and 300% by
075. Carvalho et al. (2007) predicted a much larger increase (near
00%) in BA for mainland Portugal by the end of the 21st century.
uch differences highlight the crucial importance of how the intrin-
ic daily variability in RCMs is managed when constructing future
cenarios. We  feel confident that the delta change method results
s a good and simple alternative to the more conventional unbias-
ng method in order to circumvent the inaccurate representation
f current climate in RCMs, namely at the daily scale. However,
ince the nature of daily variability will also change in the future,
o correction method can completely avoid this problem.

It is evident that as further away from the present climate we  try
o extrapolate, the more weight external factors will have. Surely at
ome point prior to 2075 the influence of these external factors will

vertake the validity of present time models purely based on mete-
rology. In particular, we stress that the incorporation of land-use
hange models in this type of simulations may  be a determinant
actor for extending the validity and confidence of extrapolations

based on model projections, as already discussed by Moss et al.
(2010) and Brovkin et al. (2013). In conclusion, as any other pro-
jections based on RCM data, these trends should be envisaged
carefully, and seen as a tendency based on the current state of fire
prevention, forest management, and projected climate scenarios. In
fact, the main lesson to take from such alarming projections is the
urge for preparing and mitigating changes that seem inevitable in
terms of climate and environment, as current state-of-the-art mod-
eling insists in warming and drying trends in the Mediterranean,
and particularly on the Iberian Peninsula (MARN, 2006; AEMET-IM,
2011; Ramos et al., 2011; Gouveia et al., 2011).

ABSTRACT: This work focuses on the spatial and temporal variability of burnt area (BA) in the entire Iberian Peninsula
(IP) and on the construction of statistical models to reproduce the inter-annual variability. A novel common dataset was
assembled for the whole IP by merging the registered BA from 66 administrative regions of both Portugal and Spain.
We applied a cluster analysis to identify larger regions with similar fire regimes and results point to the existence of four
clusters (Northwestern, Northern, Southwestern and Eastern) whose spatial patterns and seasonal fire regimes are shown to
be related with constraining factors such as topography, vegetation cover and climate conditions. The relationship between
BA at monthly time scale with both long-term climatic pre-conditions and short-term synoptic forcing was assessed using
correlation and regression analysis based on: (1) temperature and precipitation from 2 to 7 months in advance to fire peak
season, (2) synoptic weather patterns derived from 11 distinct Weather Types Classifications (WTC). Different relations
were obtained for each IP region with a relevant link being identified between BA and short-term synoptic forcing for all
clusters, while the relation with long-term climatic preconditioning was relevant for all but one cluster. Stepwise regression
models based on the best climatic and synoptic circulation predictors were developed with cross-validation to avoid over
fitting. The performance of the models varies within IP regions, though models exclusively based on WTC tend to better
reproduce the annual BA time series than those merely based on pre-conditioning climatic information. Nevertheless,
the use of both synoptic and climatic predictors provides the best results, particularly for the two western clusters, with
Pearson correlation coefficient values higher than 0.7. Finally, it is shown that typical synoptic configurations that favour
high values of BA correspond to dry and warm wind flows associated with anti-cyclonic regimes.

1. Introduction

It is widely known that, as a consequence of the Mediter-
ranean type of climate, the southern European countries
(Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece) are partic-
ularly affected by summer fires (Barbosa et al ., 2007;
JRC, 2010). The frequent warm and dry meteorologi-
cal conditions found in summer play an obvious role
in the triggering and spreading of these fires. Moreover,
recent and future trends towards a dryer (Mariotti et al .,
2008; Mariotti, 2010; Sousa et al ., 2011) and warmer
(Giorgi, 2006; Fischer and Scha?r, 2010) Mediterranean
climate will tend to exacerbate the problem. However,
while the prevailing weather conditions play an important
role it must be acknowledged that human contribution is
also significant either in Spain (Valbuena-Caraban?a et al .,

2010) or in Portugal (Costa et al ., 2010). For example, the
widespread abandonment and depopulation of rural areas
in Iberia in the last decades has contributed to an increase
in fuel availability for the ignition and spreading of fires
(Pausas and Vallejo, 1999; Lloret et al ., 2002). This pat-
tern of events is in line with the rest of the Mediterranean
basin, where areas of scarcely relevance for agriculture
were either converted to forest plantations or abandoned
to the natural process of ecological succession, often con-
verted to shrublands and woodlands (Moreno et al ., 1998;
Pausas and Vallejo, 1999). In fact, it should be noticed
that the use of fire as a tool to modify the landscape
has been used on much longer temporal scales through-
out the Holocene in both southern Iberian Peninsula (IP)
(Gil-Romera et al ., 2010) as well as in northern Iberia
(Rubiales et al ., 2008).

Among all northern Mediterranean regions, it must be
stressed that wildfires constitute a major and recurrent
hazard in the IP. Their occurrence is responsible for a
very large amount of burnt area (BA) every year, as well
as for significant human and socio-economical impacts.

For example, during the period 1980 – 2009, the average
annual BA by wildfires in Portugal (Spain) was about
109 000 ha (177 000 ha) (Pereira et al ., 2011a). However,
if we compute the ratio of total BA by the country
total land area, Portugal leads the rank of European
countries most affected by fires, with a ratio up to three
times higher than Italy, the second most fire-affected
country (Pereira et al ., 2011a). Nevertheless spatial
distribution patterns of fire occurrences and BA are
not homogeneous within southern Europe, neither within
each country (JRC, 2010). On the basis of data compiled
between 1985 and 1997 (European Commission, 1998),
northwestern Iberia (Portugal and the Spanish Provinces
of Galicia) is the European region with the largest
percentage of fire occurrences (roughly 50% of total
number of fires), followed by southern Italy (10%) and
the triangle Provence-Tuscany-Corsica (7%) (EC, 1998;
Pereira et al ., 2005). However, one should be careful
because these annual average values hide a remarkable
level of inter-annual variability. For example, focusing
on the burned surface in Portugal between 2003 and
2007, the exceptional summers of 2003 (450 000 ha) and
2005 (380 000 ha), present the highest values of BA since
robust statistics started to be compiled in 1980 (Trigo
et al ., 2006; Pereira et al ., 2011a), contrast with average-
summers like 2004 or 2006 (120 000 and 80 000 ha of BA,
respectively), or even 2007, which represents the second
lowest record with just 30 000 ha of BA (Pereira et al .,
2011a).

The number of fires and their extent in mid-latitude
regions are controlled primarily by natural factors (e.g.
topography, weather conditions and vegetation cover),
by land management practices responsible for anthro-
pogenic ignitions, and also by fire prevention, manage-
ment and suppression efforts. Changes in the frequency
of occurrence of specific atmospheric conditions, which
are favourable to the outbreak and consequent spread-
ing of large wildfires, can help explaining the magnitude
of this inter-annual variability (Viegas and Viegas, 1994;
Pyne et al ., 1996, Kunkel, 2001). In the context of large
fire occurrences in the IP, a number of works has focused
objectively on the role played by meteorological factors,
namely in Portugal (Trigo et al ., 2006; Hoinka et al .,
2009; Carvalho et al ., 2008) and in Spain (Va?zquez and
Moreno, 1993; Pin?ol et al ., 1998; Pausas, 2004; Padilla
and Vega-Garc??a, 2009; Rasilla et al ., 2010; Pausas and
Ferna?ndez-Mun?oz, 2011). Moreover, several works have
proved that Iberian fires are also associated with the
occurrence of anomalous climate in the preceding seasons
(Viegas and Viegas, 1994; Pereira et al ., 2005). However,
a growing number of studies focused on the anthro-
pogenic contribution towards the spatial distribution of
Iberian fires (Ve?lez, 1993, Bad??a et al ., 2002; Lloret
et al ., 2002; Va?zquez et al ., 2002; Cueva et al ., 2006;
Costa et al ., 2010). Among these, one of the most com-
prehensive approaches corresponds to the recent work
of Costa et al . (2010), where the authors focus on the
sensitivity of Portuguese forest fires to climatic, human
activity and landscape. Similarly, in Cueva et al . (2006),

the authors showed the dependence of regional patterns of
forest fires in Spain on numerous human, landscape and
climatic factors that change frequently in time and space.

Despite the amount of studies, there are still issues
to be further addressed in relation to the interactions
between meteorological conditions, vegetation dynamics
and fires. In the Mediterranean region, drought periods
can have strong impacts in vegetation activity (Gou-
veia et al ., 2009), with significant losses of crop yields
(Austin et al ., 1998), decreasing of terrestrial net primary
production (Zhao and Running, 2010) and forest growing
(Mart??nez-Villalta et al ., 2008) and increasing the risk of
forest fires (Pausas, 2004). It is now widely accepted that
changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation is partially
responsible for decreasing precipitation trends and higher
frequency of drought episodes over Iberia (Paredes et al .,
2006; Garc??a-Herrera et al ., 2007). Moreover, such a
trend towards a drier Mediterranean climate is in very
good agreement with state-of-the-art climate change
projections for different future scenarios (Giorgi, 2006).
Finally, other studies have proved that the occurrence of
major droughts in southern Europe during the preceding
winter and spring seasons can enhance the amplitude
of heat waves on the following summer (Seneviratne
et al ., 2006; Fischer et al ., 2007), implying that these
two phenomena (droughts and heat waves) are closely
related.

A number of studies have used remote sensing
imagery-derived datasets over the Mediterranean region
to analyse changes in vegetation activity (Vicente-Serrano
and Heredia-Lacaustra, 2004; Gouveia et al ., 2008),
have determined the impact of droughts (Vicente-Serrano,
2007; Gouveia et al ., 2009) and have monitored plant
recovery after fire (Viedma et al ., 2006, Gouveia et al ,
2010). Several vegetation indices can be used to assess
vegetation dynamics; however, the Normalized Dif-
ference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most widely
employed (Myneni et al ., 1995; Gouveia et al ., 2008).

Pereira et al . (2005) found that the daily synop-
tic variability in Portugal is the most important driver
of favourable local fire-prone weather conditions. Bear-
ing this in mind, atmospheric circulation classifications
become an important potential tool to study the role of
weather in wildfire occurrence in the IP. Furthermore,
impacts on fire activity of large scale circulation pat-
terns in the atmosphere and in the ocean have been used
with the aim of developing short- and long-range forecast
models for wildfire occurrences by several authors. In this
respect, Flannigan et al . (2001) explored the relationship
between Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) and BA
in Canada to build a forecasting model of monthly and
seasonal fire activity. Here, we intend to apply a similar
approach on the specific context of the IP, and to intro-
duce Weather Types Classification (WTC) on a deeper
assessment of fire-season predictability for this region. In
this work, we will be mostly focused on the relationship
between meteorological and BA inter-annual variability,
through the use of summer synoptic circulation and pre-
vious climatological conditions in the entire IP.

MODELLING WILDFIRE ACTIVITY IN IBERIA

WTCs are a recurrent and fairly simple method to
describe atmospheric circulation variability at daily and
sub-daily scale, as they provide discrete characterizations
of the atmospheric conditions. They have been widely
used in several contexts and, as a consequence, a large
variety of classification methods (automated or not) have
been developed with multiple purposes. Here we are con-
sidering the WTCs developed within the framework of
the COST Action 733 — Harmonization and applications
of WTC for European Regions (COST733) catalogue.

The COST733 catalogue comprehends the largest set
of classifications ever assembled for different regions
of Europe. These are based on numerous methods and
meteorological variables and have been applied to sev-
eral spatial domains centred on different European sub-
regions. We intend to make the best use of this catalogue
and perform an objective comparison on the ability of
each classification to explain wildfire variability in the
IP domain. Numerous objective comparisons for the cat-
alogue have been performed on several areas of study,
such as heavy precipitation occurrence (Lupikasza, 2010;
Twardosz, 2010), extreme values of air temperature (Ustr-
nul et al ., 2010), lightning activity (Pineda et al ., 2010),
air pollution (Le?sniok et al ., 2010). Preliminary works
relating WTC with wildfire occurrences have been devel-
oped for Iberia (Rasilla et al ., 2010) and Greece (Kas-
somenos, 2010). However, Rasilla et al . (2010) did not
use WTC from the COST733 catalogue, but rather his
own classifications, based on Principal Components and
Cluster analyses.

Therefore, the main objectives of this work are the
following:

(1) To obtain a novel comprehensive wildfire dataset for
the entire IP and to distinguish fairly independent
regions in terms of BA characteristics and fire regime
for each region;

(2) To provide an interpretation on the spatial distribution
of BA in terms of the topography, climate and
vegetation dynamics in the IP;

(3) To analyse the relationships and dependence of
BA inter-annual variability with previous seasonal
climatological conditions, namely precipitation and
air temperature;

(4) To examine the performance of the different WTC
available from COST733 catalogue as indicators for
the BA inter-annual variability;

(5) To test the ability of simple statistical regres-
sion models to reproduce the inter-annual variabil-
ity of BA, using climatological data and WTC as
predictors.

The rest of this manuscript has the following structure:
the datasets used in this study and the climate of IP are
described in Section 2, while the identification of the most
important spatial regions with identical fire behaviour
was obtained with cluster analysis in Section 3. The links
between BA for each cluster and previous meteorological
fields and/or the frequency of each weather type (WT)

are evaluated in Section 4, while Section 5 provides
a description of the most important WT patterns asso-
ciated with fire occurrences at each cluster previously
identified. Finally, section 6 is devoted to the discussion
of obtained results and to present the conclusions of
this study.

2. Datasets and main characteristics of the study
area

This work relies on three types of data series, namely:
(1) WT catalogues and meteorological variables; (2) BA
in both Iberian countries (Portugal and Spain) and (3)
vegetation index.

2.1. WT catalogues

WTC data was obtained from the COST733 project
(Philipp et al ., 2010) and although available since 1958 it
ends in 2001, which constrains its use to the 22-year long
period (1980 – 2001) to be coincident with fire data. We
only considered classifications with nine categories (in
a total of 11 classifications), and exclusively worked in
the domain D09 that is centred over the IP. This domain
(amongst all available for the catalogue) is represented
in Figure 1, together with all the remaining regional and
pan-European domains. The acronym of the considered
11 classifications is presented in Table I, together with
the climatic elements and main methodological methods
used in their construction.

2.2. A climate characterization of the IP

The climate of the study area is characterized by
using the mean monthly precipitation and temperature
series obtained from long Climatic Research Unit (CRU)
gridded dataset — version TS3.0 at the resolution of
0.5? × 0.5? latitude (Mitchell and Jones, 2005). To assess
the IP climatology within the appropriate context, we
must acknowledge the main physical attributes of the
region, namely the topography and mountain ranges.
These geographical characteristics and the political bor-
ders of the Iberian countries are depicted in Figure 2.

Maps of annual averages of surface temperature and
precipitation in the IP computed for the 1980 – 2005
period using the CRU gridded dataset are shown in
Figure 3. The overall patterns are quite similar to higher
resolution Iberian climate atlas maps of annual average
mean air temperature and precipitation computed for the
1971 – 2000 period (AEMET-IM, 2011) obtained with
observed data from a large number of meteorological
and udometric stations. The annual precipitation in the
IP (Figure 3, top panel) presents a SE – NW gradient,
with higher values in the coastal regions extending
from Lisbon, in central Portugal to Galicia (northwestern
Spain) and also to the northern mountainous regions
(including the Cantabria and Pyrenees) and the lowest
values found in the southern-eastern corner of the IP.

2.3. A fire database for the IP (1980 – 2005)

We have considered BA data from fire occurrences over
Portugal and Spain in order to produce a joint database for
Iberia (and Baleares islands) as these European countries

have long and homogeneous time series of fire data
since 1980 (Barbosa et al ., 2007; JRC, 2010). Portuguese
fire data was obtained from the Autoridade Florestal
Nacional (AFN, 2011), while Spanish data was obtained
from the Direccio?n General de Biodiversidad. Pereira
et al . (2011a) provides a comprehensive description of
the history and characteristics of the Portuguese fire
database for the 1980 – 2005 period. It was found that
during the 1980s the minimum amount of BA was 0.1 ha
(i.e. all fires smaller than 0.1 ha where not considered)
and this threshold has been reduced subsequently, being
currently in the order of 0.0001 ha. These changes
are important as they introduce artificial trends on the
number of fires time series and, consequently, on the
average BA per fire. However, the contribution of all
these very small fires does not change significantly
the annual (or summer) BA (Pereira et al ., 2011a).
The Spanish database has also been analysed in the
recent past (Moreno et al ., 1998) and has been shown
to be increasingly reliable (Carracedo Mart??n et al .,
2009). Although available since 1976, two northern
Spanish regions present significant amounts of missing
data: A?lava (1980 – 1984) and Navarra (1980 – 1984 and
1994 – 2002). These missing values were replaced by the
long-term monthly mean BA in each of these regions,
a procedure with very limited impact as these regions
present mean annual BA values below 0.5 and 0.1% of
their total areas, respectively.

This new Iberian database refers to the common
period of 1980 – 2005 for both countries BA time series.
Monthly BA time series are spatially disaggregated on

of Portugal by Distritos , and in the case of Spain
by Provincias (Figure 4). For both countries, we have

not used the BA observed in the Portuguese (Azores
and Madeira for Portugal) and Spanish (Canary Islands)
Atlantic archipelagos and, in the end, the database spatial
domain covers a total of 66 AR: 18 in Portugal and
48 in Spain. As these AR have considerably different
surface areas, it is not appropriate (for some purposes)
to compare BA directly among them. To circumvent this
problem, besides the absolute amount of BA per region
we have also computed the monthly Normalized Burnt
Area (NBA) for each AR, defined as the quotient between
the amount of BA in each of the AR and the area of the
corresponding AR. Since both these quantities have the
same units, NBA will be presented in permillage. After
this normalization procedure, the monthly and annual
averages for the NBA dataset for each of the 66 AR
were computed. Annual mean NBA values for all the 66
Iberian AR (Figure 4) reveal that the northwestern sector
of Iberia, which includes central and northern Portugal
and northwestern Spain (mostly Galicia and Asturias),
is the most affected by wildfires, presenting averaged
values higher than 20‰. The eastern and northeastern
coastal areas of Spain (Catalunya and Valencia) are also
moderately prone to wildfires (with NBA values between
10 and 20‰ of their total area). Most central and southern
regions of Iberia (except the Algarve region) do not
present significant amounts of annual NBA (below 5‰).
However, it must be acknowledged that this analysis
based on NBA values still presents a caveat, since the
normalization with the total districts/province’s surface
area can induce a bias in the final results. In fact, ARs
have different percentage of vegetated area and some ARs
(e.g. Zaragoza in Spain or Algarve in Portugal) have a
relatively small fraction of forestry surface, albeit highly
concentrated in smaller mountainous sub-domains.

2.4. Vegetation dynamics in IP

NDVI monthly anomalies, with 8 km of spatial resolu-
tion, were obtained from the Global Inventory Modelling

and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) dataset and correspond
to the most complete and longest remote sensing dataset,
covering the entire Mediterranean region, for the period
1982 – 2006 (Tucker et al ., 2005).

Vegetation over the Mediterranean basin and specifi-
cally over the IP presents high diversity, resulting from
climate, landscape, topography and other factors. To iden-
tify the main types of vegetation cover over Iberia, a
cluster analysis of the monthly means of NDVI for the
entire period was performed, using four clusters depicted
in Figure 5 (top panel). These four clusters correspond
approximately to the four main vegetation types over
Iberia. The cluster represented in blue coincides almost
exactly with the extension of the Eurosiberian phytocli-
matic region across the IP (Rivas Mart??nez, 1987), char-
acterized by low temperature and abundant and regular
water supply. The spatial domain of this cluster broadly
corresponds to regions included within the 800 mm iso-
hyets, a threshold traditionally used to delimitate the
‘green’ (Csa, Csb and Cfb on Ko?ppen Classification)
Iberia from the drier Mediterranean regions. Its natu-
ral vegetation is alpine or deciduous forest, currently
composed by pastures and secondary forest plantations
(eucalyptus, pinus) that presents high activity throughout
the entire year, with a maximum in spring (Figure 5, bot-
tom panel), but deeply dependent on water resources. The
cluster represented in yellow groups two different land-
scapes: (1) an ecotone transition (semideciduous forest)
through the southern piedmont of the mountains of north-
ern Spain (Cordillera Canta?brica and Pyrenees) and (2)
the typical Mediterranean sclerophyllous forests (some-
times grazed — dehesas ) across most of the mountains
and plateaus of central and southern IP. This cluster
comprehends large areas of annual (mainly not irrigated)
crops characterized by the overall highest NDVI values
during the entire seasonal cycle and with a maximum in
summer (Figure 5, bottom panel). The cluster represented
in green corresponds to the central areas of both Mesetas

and the Ebro and Guadalquivir basins, besides some spots
along the Mediterranean coast of the IP. These regions
seem to share in common a dominant (in some cases irri-
gated) agricultural activity. This cluster presents lower
vegetation activity (lower NDVI values) than the pre-
vious two, with a maximum during spring, due to the
availability of water during this season — a feature usu-
ally associated to scrublands. The last cluster, plotted in
orange presents very low values of NDVI over the entire
year (Figure 5, bottom panel), corresponding to the typ-
ical regions characterized with very sparse vegetation or
even bare soil. It resembles the most arid environments
of the IP, (Ebro valley, La Mancha, SE Spain), charac-
terized by a stepped-like vegetation (when/where there is
vegetation) as consequence of high summer temperatures
and scarce annual precipitation (below 400 mm).

3. Regionalizing fire regimes in the IP

In the previous section, BA datasets from both Iberian
countries were merged and a preliminary analysis
was performed to obtain the spatially NBA dataset.
These procedures were required before applying the
methodology that aims to objectively identify the
most important fire regimes within the IP. For this

purpose, we performed a Cluster Analysis, using the
K-means algorithm, on the NBA in the 66 considered
AR disposed in a T-mode matrix. We decided to retain
four statistically significant clusters (Figure 6), since
the obtained pattern presents regions with higher spatial
homogeneity in comparison with spatial configurations
attained with a higher number of clusters, as it will
be shown later. Furthermore, this result is concordant
with the defined regionalization defined by Rasilla et al .
(2010), also with four sub-regions, and presents a strong
resemblance with the operative regionalization used by
the Spanish authorities (MARN, 2011).

We must stress that the configuration presented in
Figure 6 does not correspond exactly to the cluster analy-
sis output. A small number (six) of neighbouring Spanish
AR were swapped in order to define a more spatially
homogeneous set of four clusters. These AR are identified
with a small circle in Figure 6 and these changes were
considered valid to perform, as they refer to ARs with
low mean annual values of NBA (usually below 5‰, as
shown in Figure 2). Taking into account the geograph-
ical location of the resulting four clusters, these were
named respectively: northwest (NW_CLU); southwest
(SW_CLU); north (N_CLU) and east (E_CLU).

Figure 6. Spatial extension of the four clusters obtained for the normalized burnt area in the 66 administrative regions (AR) of Iberia. Black
dots identify the AR that originally belonged to different clusters but were reassembled to increase spatial coherence. Legend: blue — northwest

cluster (NW_CLU); yellow — southwest cluster (SW_CLU); green — east cluster (E_CLU); and, magenta — north cluster (N_CLU).

The NW_CLU aggregates the northern half of Portugal
and the extreme northwest of Spain, including most of
the ARs with higher values of mean annual BA. The
SW_CLU represents the southern and interior areas of
Portugal (including Guarda, the AR with the highest
mean annual BA), as well as many ARs of central and
southwestern of Spain. The coastal and pre-coastal ARs
east of Gibraltar correspond to the E_CLU (including
the Baleares islands). Finally, the N_CLU corresponds
to the regions located in the mountainous sectors of
northern Spain (including Asturias, Cantabria and the
Basque Country).

The main purpose of applying this Cluster Analysis
was to identify the Iberian regions with similar temporal
variability. In fact, all four regions shown in Figure 6
have a clear annual cycle of the mean monthly NBA, with
the main differences being found in the amplitude and
timing of the maximum values (Figure 7, top panel). The
NW_CLU clearly represents the AR more affected by
wildfires, with nearly 10‰ of the total area being burned,
on average, every August. The mean peaks of the other
clusters are all below 3‰ of their area. Interestingly,
two of the identified clusters present two maxima, with
the NW_CLU revealing a much larger peak in August
and a smaller one in March. The northernmost areas of
Iberia are concentrated in the N_CLU that presents two
peaks, both comparable in magnitude (relatively small
although), in spring (March) and late summer (Septem-
ber). Finally, the two remaining clusters are characterized
by a single summer maximum in July and in August in
the case of E_CLU and SW_CLU cluster, respectively.

The boxplots of monthly NBA (Figure 7, bottom panel)
also help to characterize the intra-annual evolution of
location (median), dispersion (IQR), range (maximum
minus minimum) and asymmetry characteristics of the
NBA distribution in each cluster. In general, the annual
evolution of location, range and dispersion statistics
present a similar annual cycle of the mean monthly NBA,
with similar ratios between the amplitude and timing of
the maximum values. Only a few number of discrepancies
of that annual cycle are worth to mention, namely: (1)
the median in July is similar than the one in August
for the SW_CLU; (2) secondary maximum values of the
median (the first peak, in late winter and beginning of
spring) occurs in February, and not in March as for
the mean monthly NBA, and is about 75% higher for
N_CLU than for the NW_CLU. The temporal evolution
of the quartile skewness reveals that monthly NBA
distribution is essentially positive skewed, (with a few
exceptions), presenting high intra-annual variability and
smaller values for the western clusters (NW_CLU and
SW_CLU) during summer/fire season and the opposite
behaviour for the other two cluster (except for N_CLU
in June and July).

The spatial patterns of the four NBA clusters and the
correspondent fire regimes are also in good agreement
with topography (Figure 2), climate conditions (Figure 3)
and vegetation dynamics (Figure 5). Actually, the NW_-
CLU corresponds to the relatively low land coastal areas
in the north western Atlantic coast of the IP while the
SW_CLU includes the lowlands in the SW region of the
IP and the large Meseta Central (Figure 2). This central

and high plateau is surrounded by the Cantabrian Moun-
tains (Cordillera Canta?brica) region that corresponds to
the N_CLU and by the Ibe?rico and Penibe?tico systems
which delimits the E_CLU along with the Mediterranean
coasts of Iberia (Figure 2). The climate of these four
regions is also very different and helps to put into per-
spective some characteristics of their vegetation cover
(Figure 5) and fire regime (Figures 6 and 7), namely the

yearly amount of BA, the fire season duration and peak
timing. Besides mean annual precipitation and tempera-
ture spatial patterns (Figure 3), the climate characteriza-
tion of IP requires some knowledge on the intra-annual
temporal and spatial variability, e.g. the typical conditions
during the cold (winter) and warm (summer) seasons.
According to the Iberian Climate Atlas (AEMET-IM,
2011), the winter and summer mean precipitation and

temperature conditions in these four regions are as fol-
lows. The N_CLU and NW_CLU are clearly the wettest
clusters (Figure 3) and that implies a compatible vegeta-
tion cover (blue colour in Figure 5). However, these two
fire regime clusters diverge in terms of their annual tem-
perature. Thus the N_CLU is characterized by wet and
cold winters and by humid and fresh summers (AEMET-
IM, 2011) which supports the fact that this is one of
the regions less affected by wildfires (Figure 7). On the
contrary, the climate (and associated vegetation cover) of
the NW_CLU is the most appropriate for the occurrence
and development of fires during the dry and hot sum-
mer season because these conditions follow the humid
and mild winters (AEMET-IM, 2011). Figure 4 con-
firms (through the NBA spatial pattern) that these are
the most favourable conditions for the occurrence of
wildfires, allowing the existence and development of
live fuels during the wet and mild season (winter and
early spring) and the vegetation stress conditions during
hot and dry seasons (late spring and summer). The two
remaining clusters are associated with drier climates and
mostly non-forested vegetation cover (Figure 5). Climate
in the E_CLU is characterized by dry winters (with small
exceptions in the Pyrenees) and by even dryer and hot
summers (AEMET-IM, 2011). The existence of meteo-
rological favourable dry and hot conditions that promote
the occurrence of wildfires during the summer season
is not supported by the existence of appropriate vegeta-
tion cover, because this arid environment seriously lim-
its the fuels availability (Pausas and Ferna?ndez-Mun?oz,
2011). In fact, the cluster represented in light green in
Figure 5 corresponds to areas with extremely low NDVI
values (Figure 5 bottom panel), which is a typical of
bare soil or very sparse vegetation. In this situation, and
even with meteorological conditions that favour fire igni-
tion, there is a very low probability of having large fire
events/activity. The SW_CLU region is characterized by
extremely hot and dry summers but has a less homo-
geneous climate conditions during the mild and humid
winter, with a gradient of both temperature and precipi-
tation in the NE – SW direction. Vegetation cover in this
area is dominated by sparse vegetation, with a maximum
of vegetation activity in spring (green in Figure 5) and
rain feed crops that mature in late spring and early sum-
mer (yellow in Figure 5).

4. Modelling the inter-annual variability of BA

4.1. The influence of previous climatic conditions

Although fire ignition is most of the times dependent
on human activities (either by accident, negligence or
intentionally) the probability of a fire ignition to grow
into a large and severe event is highly dependent on the
existence of the appropriate meteorological conditions
(Pyne et al ., 1996). Nevertheless, besides the meteoro-
logical conditions at the time of the fire ignition, pre-
vious climatic conditions play a very important role, as
they are directly related to soil dryness and vegetation

hydric stress during the fire season. Some relations have
been identified in specific regions, such as over Portugal
(Pereira et al ., 2005; Trigo et al ., 2006; Hoinka et al .,
2009), where besides the usual link between summer fires
and previous months dryness and warmness, wet months
in mid-spring also reveal to be related to more BA in
the fire season, as they promote the growth of vegetation
which may act as fuel when fires are triggered. However,
the exact nature of these relations between appropriate
previous climatic conditions and BA varies from area to
area and from season to season.

Taking into account the similar fire regime within each
of the four clusters defined in Section 3, and in order
to assess the role of previous climatic conditions on
the inter-annual variability of BA, values of the Pearson
correlation coefficient (R) between BA time series (not
NBA) in each cluster and relevant antecedent climatic
variables (precipitation and temperature) over the region
were computed as a procedure to reduce the dimension-
ality and pre select predictors with greater potential. It
should be noted that BA and NBA present similar sea-
sonal cycles, but the need of using NBA in the previous
section was related with the necessity of performing the
cluster analysis using a more appropriate fire statistic
that facilitates the comparison among clusters (Figure 6)
and the corresponding seasonal evolution (Figure 7). The
CRU-TS3.0 mean monthly precipitation and temperature
dataset were used to compute mean spatial average series
for each cluster domain, i.e. selecting all grid-points coin-
cident with the area of the spatial configuration associated
to each cluster depicted in Figure 6. Instead of using abso-
lute values of climate variables to test their usefulness as
predictors, the developed models will rely on monthly
anomalies time series, computed by removing the long-
term mean from the spatially averaged monthly time
series in each cluster. This procedure does not change the
Pearson correlation coefficient but effectively removes
the annual cycle in order to retain time series of tem-
perature and precipitation anomalies in each of the four
Iberian fire cluster regions. As it was seen in Section 2.3,
each cluster presents a peak of BA at different timings
of the year, or even two peaks during different seasons.
Bearing this in mind, eventual links between BA in those
peak months and the time series of anomalous mete-
orological fields were checked from 2 to 7 months in
advance. For example, in order to study potential previ-
ous climatic influences for the August BA observed in
the NW_CLU, we tested the existence and statistical sig-
nificance of Pearson correlation coefficients between this
variable and the meteorological monthly time series from
January to June. The highest values of R between each
variable and each BA cluster for the considered months
are presented in Table II. No results are presented for
N_CLU, as none of the tested R values were statistically
significant at the 5% level.

These previous climatological variables can integrate
the pool of potential predictors and be used as predictors
in statistical hindcast models of BA (hereafter CLI_mod-
els). The purpose of such relative crude models is not to

develop quasi-operational summer BA models for each
region but simply to assess the contribution potential to
BA predictability based on pre-disposing climatic con-
ditions. For this purpose, a forward stepwise regression
was applied to the temperature and precipitation monthly
anomaly time series, in order to reproduce BA monthly
time series for each cluster. This method tests all pos-
sible predictors and selects the one that explain more
variance of the predictand (BA), and then looks for the
most relevant remaining predictors that surpass a pre-
defined level of statistical significance (here defined as
the 5% level). For the three clusters that present the main
peaks of BA during summer months (e.g. NW_CLU,
SW_CLU and E_CLU), three models were developed
and tested to simulate the BA in (1) July, (2) August
and (3) July + August. In the case of the N_CLU, which
presents two BA peaks (in March and September) models
for those two specific periods were tested. Eventual prob-
lems related to over fitting were mitigated by employ-
ing the always stringent cross-validation scheme, usually
known as the leave-one-out scheme (Wilks, 2006). In this
approach, a single observation from the original sample
is retained for validation, and the remaining observations
are used as training data. Besides, all models were forced
to retain four predictors at most. All these precautionary
steps were taken because the time series are only 22 years
long (1980 – 2001, since WTC data was only available
until 2001), and this implies that using a large number of
predictors could be misleading.

Values of the Pearson correlation coefficient between
observed and modelled (with CLI_models) BA time
series in each cluster for all these cases are summarized
in Figure 8. These results reveal that the role played
by previous climatic conditions diverges for the different
clusters (Figure 8). Winter and spring climatic conditions
play an important role for the very active NW areas.
Although we find modest R values between observed and
modelled BA time series for both July and August BA,
R increases (to about 0.5) and surpasses the statistical
significance level for the July + August BA. Results
obtained for the SW_CLU and E_CLU show that pre-
conditioning climatic predictors appear to be useful for
estimating the BA in August, but not as clearly as

for July. For the N_CLU (not presented in Figure 8)
we did not obtain statistical models for any of the
considered months, as none of the possible previous
climatic predictors were retained by selection method.
This result means that BA in March and September
are not clearly associated to remote previous anomalous
climatic conditions in this cluster.

4.2. Links with WT frequencies

The objective of this section (and the main motivation
of this work) is to assess the performance of the WTC
from the COST733 catalogue over the Iberia region in
what respects to their capacity of discriminating weather
conditions that favour the occurrence of large values of
BA. The focus will be on the conditions in the months
of occurrence of fires, or at the most, the previous one.

Every single day in the study period (1980 – 2001) was
classified in one of the nine specific categories of each
WTC. To make this information operational, monthly
frequencies of each category were computed for all WTC
used in this study. Then, following the same approach
used for the CLI_models, correlation analysis was used
as a pre-selection procedure to identify the WTC most
related with BA time series in each cluster.

The highest values of the Pearson correlation coef-
ficients between time series of BA in each cluster
and monthly frequencies of each WT are presented in
Table III. Taking into account that several classifications
present few significant values of R with BA time series,
the remaining of the analysis was restricted to the five
most promising WTC, namely: LUNDC09, NNWC09,
PCACAC09, PETISCOC09 and WLKC09. This restric-
tion is objective as it is solely based on the magni-
tude of the statistical relationships observed between the
BA in each cluster and the WT frequencies for certain
classifications.

The BA statistical models based on time series of
monthly frequencies of each WT (WTC_models) for
each of the four clusters were developed following the
same approach used to developed the CLI_models (i.e. a
forward stepwise predictor selection procedure, limited to
retain at most four predictors and using cross-validation).
This approach will enable us to distinguish which of the
considered five classifications tend to better reproduce
the appropriate classes of weather conditions that are
related to months with high values of BA in Iberia. At
this stage, the climatic information from previous seasons
was neglected and we are only focused on the WTC
predictors. Aiming to develop the best BA models and
to assess the possible added value of incorporating both
types of information (rather than using only WTC or
only previous meteorological data alone) a third type
of hindcast models (TOT_models) was developed. In
this case, both classes of variables are integrated in
the potential pool of predictors used to construct the
models and the remaining exact same procedures as in
the previous models are carried out.

ber of clusters retained, months to analyse and WTC kept

reason, the darker bar is only visible in the cases where
TOT_models produce better models than WTC_models.
This representation simplifies the comparison between

the performances of all models, the assessment of the
ability of each WTC to describe the BA variability, and
the understanding to what extent (and for each cluster)
previous climatic data improves the results obtained
from WTC predictors-based models. Several major
results emerge from the analysis of Figure 9, namely:

(1) Higher values of R were obtained for both western
sectors of Iberia (NW_CLU and SW_CLU), fact
which suggest that it will be more susceptible to
reconstruct BA series using this type of statistical
models and predictors in these regions;

(2) In general, TOT_models present higher performance
than the corresponding WTC_models and CLI_-
models, which means that the use of both WTC

and previous meteorological conditions as predic-
tors provides an added value in the vast majority of
cases.

For example, in the NW_CLU the value of the Pearson
correlation coefficient for most of the models surpasses
the 5% significance line. In this region, good results
are found for both July and August BA time series.
Nevertheless, the July + August models present the best

performance in NW_CLU (in three of the five tested
WTC). In the SW_CLU, the month which models are
more able to reproduce BA variance varies according
to the considered classifications. TOT_models present
better results than CLI_models but, the main feature is
that the use of WTC as predictors improves substantially
the reconstruction of BA series in July, which was
quite modest when using climatological information only.
Results for August are slightly better but not statistically
significant, showing that the wildfire climatology in
SW_CLU and this month is essentially related to years
with propitious conditions cumulated in previous months.
In the E_CLU August BA models tend to present better
results (in four of the five classifications), while July
models fall below the 5% level of statistical significance.
As no satisfying CLI_models were obtained for the
N_CLU, we find the best TOT_models for this region
to be equivalent to the best WTC_models. In this cluster,
statistically significant BA models were only obtained for
September.

The procedure for statistical validation of the models
is not based solely on the Pearson correlation coefficient.
The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) has also been computed
for all models presented here. We found a good agreement
between the results obtained with the two measures of
goodness of fit, for example, the higher the correlation
coefficients, the lower the MAE between observed and
modelled series (not shown).

Finally, it is not an easy task to rank the best WTC
classifications for any cluster as it depends on the
target month. However, PETISCOC09, WLKC09 and
LUNDC09 can be considered the most satisfying for
NW_CLU. It is also rather difficult to select the best per-
forming classifications in the SW_CLU, but LUNDC09,
PCACAC09 and PETISCOC09 may be considered to
be those that provide the best results on the overall.
The PETISCOC09, LUNDC09 and PCACAC09 classi-
fications present the best results for the E_CLU. For
the N_CLU, the region with the poorest model perfor-
mance, statistically significant models were only found
for September and with the WLKC09, LUNDC09 and
PETISCOC09 WTC.

5. Synoptic analysis

It was shown in the previous section that the statisti-
cal models (TOT_models) which combine prior climatic
information (temperature and precipitation anomalies)
and non-lagged WTC series usually present better perfor-
mance, when reconstructing the inter-annual variability
of BA series of Iberia, particularly in the most affected
western sectors. To have a further understanding on the
role that the latter predictors have on these models, the
mean sea level pressure anomaly composite fields of
the retained classes for each model in each cluster were
analysed in more detail. Once again, taking into account
the considerably large number of models and predictors,
we opted to summarize results in a concise way (Figure

(lower central box) with higher values of BA in each cluster (lower left box) and for specific weather type classifications (lower right box) that

10). The shown composites characterize the typical syn-
optic configurations driving the main surface wind flow
and heat advection that predominate during months with
very high values of BA in each cluster.

The majority of the retained classes correspond to
very similar synoptic configurations, independently of the
WTC. In all cases, and as expected, the composites reveal
atmospheric anti-cyclonic circulation patterns usually
associated with stable and dry conditions. The obtained
spatial configurations foster prevailing warm and dry
winds from inland, rather than moist and cool air
advection from the sea, either from the Atlantic Ocean
or the Mediterranean. The main difference between the
results for each cluster can be found in the location of the
high-pressure region, which induces different directions

of the surface wind flow. This type of circulation
is clearly evident in the composites identified when
analysing the most coastal confined clusters (NW, N and
E). In the NW_CLU of Iberia, we find that hazardous
fire seasons are related to WTs with prevailing winds
from the east or southeast components. The composite
of surface pressure anomaly obtained for the NW_CLU
(Figure 10) is very similar to the spatial pattern obtained
for the sea level air pressure composite for the 10%
highest BA days in Portugal and the corresponding
10% anomaly for the 1980 – 2000 period (Pereira et al .,
2005). The Mediterranean areas that compose the E_CLU
present important fire episodes when the circulation is
essentially from the northwest (Figure 10). Regions from
the N_CLU have fire incidence with dominating southeast

or east winds. In this latter case, and in particular
for coastal areas, it is also quite evident that besides
being an inland wind, it is also a downslope wind from
the Cantabria mountainous region towards the coast,
promoting additional drying and warming of air masses
(Foehn effect). This is also the process that helps to
understand the obtained results for the SW_CLU, where
the anomalous composites point to prevailing winds from
the north or northwest components. It should be reminded
that in this cluster the highest values of the NBA are
found for some ARs of Portugal (namely Guarda, Castelo
Branco and Santare?m), which are located downstream of
the main orographic barriers in that domain. It should also
be kept in mind that this cluster covers a much wider area
of the peninsula (Figure 6), comprehending not only the
referred Portuguese AR but also a large part of central
and southern Spain, where NBA values are generally low.
The wide structure of this cluster may partially explain
the absence of a clearly inland originated wind patterns
in the presented composite.

6. Discussion and conclusions

In this work, a comprehensive and novel wildfire database
for the entire IP was established by merging informa-
tion from both Iberian countries which is essential for
studying spatial and temporal patterns of fire occurrences
and BAs in Iberia. Moreover, such a database can be
useful for further developments on a wider European con-
text. Using this Iberian dataset, we were able to perform
a cluster analysis to distinguish between different sub-
regions with similar monthly fire regimes within the IP.
This analysis proved to be efficient in discriminating four
independent regions, as they differ both on the timing
and intensity of the seasonal peaks of NBA. The analy-
sis of the mean annual cycle of NBA clearly highlights
the western half of Iberia as more prone to large wild-
fire activity, particularly in central and northern areas of
Portugal and northwestern areas of Spain. Paradoxically,
being neither the driest nor the most irregular region in
terms of rainfall in the Iberian context, the exceptional
high frequency of forest fires in NW_CLU denotes the
relevant role of a combination of weather-climate, vegeta-
tion, geographical and human factors upon fire dynamics.
Some northeastern areas of Spain also present relevant
mean annual values of NBA, but generally at a smaller
magnitude than the previous. This fact leads us to pay
particular attention to the results and statistical models
of westernmost clusters. In fact the relatively low values
of NBA found in the other clusters reduce the possi-
bility of a deeper analysis, and increase the danger of
misinterpretation of the results and of the efficiency of
the tested statistical models. As expected, the highest
mean monthly values of NBA area were found in sum-
mer months, as higher temperatures and lower humidity
foster appropriate conditions for fire ignitions. Western-
most regions tend to present higher mean values of NBA

in the month of August, while areas along the Mediter-
ranean basin present a peak in July. Northern areas
(both N_CLU and NW_CLU) have two annual peaks,
one in summer and one in late winter or early spring.
While in the NW_CLU this cold season peak is almost
insignificant when compared to the summer peak, in the
regions around Cantabria and Asturias both peaks are
comparable, although of relatively small amplitude.

The purpose of this study was to undertake an objec-
tive comparison between the ability of different WTC
available from the COST733 project, in terms of discrim-
inating the synoptic conditions that favour large wildfire
activity in Iberia. This was done for classifications with
nine classes, and the procedure includes: (1) correlation
analysis between monthly BA and the monthly frequen-
cies of each WT, used as a predictor pre-selection tool;
followed by a (2) regression analysis to derive statisti-
cal hindcast models of monthly BA (WTC_models) for
all the clusters, and testing their ability to reproduce the
inter-annual variability of the observed series. Similar
approaches were adopted in previous studies in many
different areas (Pereira et al , 2011b). To avoid multi-
colinearity, in ecological modelling studies it is common
to adopt two criteria: (i) pairwise correlation using Spear-
man’s or Pearson’s R correlation coefficient between pre-
dictors lower than given thresholds, e.g. 0.7 (Elith et al .,
2006; Wisz and Guisan, 2009); and (ii) Generalized Vari-
ance Inflation Factor (GVIF) lower than 5 (Neter et al .,
1996). In this study, R between every pair of predictors
was less or equal 0.5, while GVIF computed with SAM
(Rangel et al ., 2010) was always less than 2.

To contextualize this modelling approach, models
based solely on climatic information from the pre-fire
season (CLI_models) were initially developed in order to
compare the results obtained with both models. This pro-
cedure enabled us to distinguish between regions of the IP
where pre-fire season temperature and precipitation play
an important role on the magnitude of the fire season,
and areas where this information has relatively low pre-
dictability value. Summer large wildfire activity is highly
related to previous climatic conditions in the northwestern
sector of Iberia. This result is in agreement with the previ-
ous work by Pereira et al . (2005), which states that spring
conditions are determinant on the propensity for large val-
ues of BA during the warmest months, mainly by (1) the
level of dryness imposed by previous climatic conditions
and (2) the rate of vegetation growth in spring, which
leads to an additional fuel accumulation during summer
extreme warm episodes. We have attempted to use other
variables related with the pre-fire season climate, such
as the Palmer Drought Standardized Index (PDSI), how-
ever, this has not improved the quality of the models,
being rejected during the stepwise regression procedure.

A third set of statistical models was computed using
both referred types of information as potential predictors
(TOT_models). This was done in order to see the
added value of merging WTC and previous climatic
conditions information. It should be stressed that all
models were cross-validated to avoid over fitting. As

expected, in almost all cases, best results were obtained
for the TOT_models. The larger improvements were
found for months and clusters where CLI_models results
were poorer. In northwestern areas, previous climatic
conditions information was already sufficient to produce
quite robust hindcast models. The difference in the
predictability of BA amid different areas is quite evident
in the correlation coefficient and MAE between hindcast
and observed time series. Overall, we found the most
robust statistical hindcast models for the NW_CLU (the
one with the highest mean annual values of NBA), and
the worst performing models in the N_CLU (the one with
the lowest mean annual values of NBA and with two
similar sized peaks in March and September).

There is no clear or consensual result pointing to
one particular WTC that performs better on the purpose
of modelling BA time series in all Iberian regions.
Depending on the considered region and month, the
best performing classification change. However, some
of the tested classifications tend to present the best
results more frequently: PETISCOC09, WLKC09 and
LUNDC09. Each of these WTC presents some of the
most satisfying results in at least two clusters, while other
classifications do not present good performances in none
of the considered regions and months that were analysed
and were therefore discarded from the remaining of the
analysis. In the western sectors of Iberia (NW_CLU and
SW_CLU), several WTC used alone are sufficient to
developed statistical significance models at the 5% level.
In these clusters, the variance of July BA time series
is less explained by previous climatic conditions alone
than in August or July + August BA time series, but
there was a significant gain by introducing current WTC
information. This difference between July and August
models might result from the fact that the ignition of
a fire in the middle of August does not always require
an extreme ‘synoptic forcing’, due to the accumulation
of previous hot and dry spells, while earlier in July
a large fire might require a more intense ‘synoptic
forcing’ to be initiated. In the Mediterranean coastal
areas, BA in July was also difficult to model based
purely on previous climatological conditions, and in this
particular case, the WTC information does not improve
significantly the models — only the BA in August and
in July + August time series can be well reproduced
by these statistical models. A study by Milla?n et al .
(1998) suggests that in this region, early summer fire
activity is highly related to the penetration of sea breezes
inland, during well established warm and dry conditions
in the interior, while in late summer westerly dry and
warm inland flows (Poniente) play a more important
role. This fact may provide some context for the poor
results obtained with the models of BA in July, as sea
breezes occur frequently at the mesoscale (i.e. at a finer
resolution than the considered datasets in this work),
while the Poniente conditions can be well represented
at the synoptic scale. Models for the northernmost
regions present the worst results even when both types
of information are used as predictors, although some

few WTC can present interesting results. Three possible
facts might help to explain such regional discrepancies:
(1) the low performance of the N_CLU and E_CLU
models might result from an insufficient level of spatial
aggregation to solve the climatological and topographical
complexity of both regions; (2) the reliability of the
seasonal models is reduced, as the BA in the NW_CLU
reveals to be a consequence of a large number of ‘small’
fires, while when we move to the southeast most of the
BA rests on a few large forest fires; (3) as a response
of such level of complexity, atmospheric mechanisms
might combine themselves in a nonlinear way, sometimes
reinforcing the total forcing, sometimes weakening it. In
any case, the analysis of those facts is beyond the scope
of this paper.

It was also important to assure that WT predictors
which were retained by the selection method corre-
sponded to synoptic patterns associated with large wild-
fire activity episodes. The composites for the majority of
WTs that were retained as predictors for each cluster cor-
respond to stable conditions, where the specific region is
influenced by warm and dry air masses. The atmospheric
processes that could enhance the susceptibility for large
BA are associated to either the advection of hot and dry
inland air to coastal regions, or diabatic heating and dry-
ing on the downslope side of the mountainous systems.

On the overall, and despite being almost impossible
to identify the WTC more suitable to discriminate BA
in Iberia, it is quite clear that their information is very
useful and valuable enough to develop statistical models
that can explain the variability of BA in this region.
In fact, instead of picking and focusing on one or two
particular classifications a priori , we find a more efficient
type of approach to take them all initially into account,
and use objective criteria and automatic methods to
select the classifications with better performance in each
particular case.

Regionalized scenarios of climate change for Spain
(MARN, 2005; AEMET-IM, 2011) and Portugal show
a sustained warming (Ramos et al ., 2011) and a reduc-
tion of the precipitation (Gouveia et al ., 2011), more
remarkable during spring, outcome of the reduction of
Atlantic storm systems (Lorenzo et al ., 2011). Conse-
quently, the overall increase of the fire risk associated to
a warmer world should be enhanced in western Iberia due
to the long-term reduction of the springtime precipitation.
The good performance of models in this region offers a
promising tool to simulate the BA amount from the out-
puts of the regional climate models. Finally, we must
acknowledge the fact that some of the Iberian regions
characterized in this work might be affected by the exis-
tence of asymmetric trends in BA annual values. In par-
ticular, it has been shown that Spain reveals a negative
trend of BA in the last three decades while Portugal has
not revealed such pattern, being more appropriately char-
acterized by an increasing tendency between the 1980s
and 2000s (Pereira et al ., 2011a).
