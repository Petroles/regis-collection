Resumo 

 

Com a publicação da Directiva Quadro da Água em 2000, Portugal assumiu, 

assim como os restantes Estados Membros da Comunidade Europeia, o compromisso 

de alcançar o bom estado ecológico das suas massas de água superficiais até 2015. 

Contudo, para tal é necessário primeiramente averiguar o estado actual destas mesmas 

massas de água. Tendo por base as metodologias propostas para os rios do Sul de 

Portugal, procedeu-se ao estudo das comunidades de macroinvertebrados bentónicos 

existentes em 13 locais nas bacias hidrográficas de Santo André e Melides. Verificou-se 

que, tal como em outras ribeiras mediterrânicas, os insectos são o grupo predominante, 

com uma elevada densidade de taxa generalistas. A forma como os macroinvertebrados 

bentónicos respondem a diferentes variáveis ambientais permitiu averiguar que a 

concentração de oxigénio dissolvido, a granulometria e a concentração de matéria 

orgânica são factores estruturantes destas comunidades, sendo fundamentais para a 

posterior avaliação do estado ecológico das ribeiras. 

 O Índice Português de Invertebrados do Sul (IPtIs) proposto para a avaliação do 

estado ecológico da maioria dos rios do sul de Portugal foi aplicado aos locais em 

estudo. Os resultados deste índice sugerem que destes treze locais apenas três se 

encontram num estado ecológico considerado bom ou excelente. Para uma avaliação 

ecológica integrada e abrangente aplicaram-se também índices de qualidade do habitat 

fluvial (IHF) e da galeria ripícola (QBR). Uma vez que a criação do índice IPtIs é 

relativamente recente, não foi ainda possível uma ampla aplicação do mesmo de modo a 

verificar a sua eficiência em diferentes tipos de sistemas aquáticos. Como tal, foi 

estudada a responsividade deste índice às pressões identificadas nas bacias em estudo. 

Chegou-se à conclusão que, apesar de este índice ter uma boa responsividade em 

ambientes lóticos, o mesmo não se verifica quando aplicado em ambientes lênticos ou 

com zonas de interface com águas subterrâneas, subestimando nestes a qualidade 

ecológica.

Summary 

 

With the publication of the Water Framework Directive in 2000, Portugal and all 

other Member States of the European Community, assumed the commitment to achieve 

a good ecological status of all water bodies by the year of 2015. The accomplishment of 

this major objective requires the assessment of the current status of all water bodies. 

Benthic macroinvertebrate communities of 13 locations of the Santo André and Melides 

river basins were assessed based on the methods proposed for the Portuguese Southern 

rivers. As in other Mediterranean streams, insects were the predominant group with a 

high density of generalist taxa. Dissolved oxygen concentration, sediment grain-size and 

organic matter concentration were the major environmental variables structuring these 

benthic macroinvertebrate communities. 

The Portuguese multimetric index of the South (IPtIs), proposed for the 

assessment of the ecological status of southern Portuguese rivers was determined for the 

studied locations. The obtained results suggest that only three of these thirteen sites are 

in an ecological status considered good or excellent. Riparian vegetation quality (QBR 

index) and the habitat diversity (IHF index) were also assessed for a broader and 

integrated ecological assessment. The recent proposal of the IPtIs index as an 

assessment method is relatively recent and for that reason a wider use in order to verify 

its responsiveness and, therefore, improve its accuracy was not possible. The 

responsiveness of this index to previously identified pressures in the Melides and Santo 

André river basins was a major objective of this study. Although this index showed a 

predictable response in lotic environments, it did not show a good performance when 

applied to lentic environments and groundwater/surface water interfaces, underestimating 

ecological quality. 

 

 

Key-words: Water Framework Directive, streams, benthic macroinvertebrates, insects, 

IPtIs, ecological status.

General Introduction 

 

 

 

The importance of freshwater resources  

In Southern Europe there are growing pressures that are a result of an intense 

water demand, especially in the summer months, that in association with an irregular 

distribution of precipitation leads to a prediction of occurrence of shortages in water 

supply at the medium and long term.  Although freshwater ecosystems only occupy less 

than 1% of the Earth's surface, they can be considered hotspots since they 

support approximately 10% of all known species and provide goods and services with 

great value to human societies (Strayer and Dudgeon, 2010).  

 

Stream Management and the Water Framework Directive (WFD) 

The WFD (2000/60/EC) establishes basic principles of a sustainable water policy 

in the European Union with the purpose of protection, improvement and restoration of 

surface and groundwaters. The main objective of this framework is to achieve a good 

chemical and ecological status by the year 2015 (European Commission, 2000). 

Ecological status is an expression of the quality of the structure and functioning of aquatic 

ecosystems associated with surface waters, requiring the use of biological elements to 

assess it, namely phytoplankton, aquatic flora, benthic invertebrate fauna, fish fauna.  

The ecological status of stream ecosystems is a result of natural environmental 

conditions and anthropogenic pressures. The greater the intensity of the pressure agents 

in the ecosystem, the greater the difference from its natural state (reference condition) 

(Ippolito et al, 2009).These pressures lead to an elevated loss of biodiversity, having 

Ricciardi et al. (1999) concluded that the extinctions rate in freshwater are much greater 

than in the terrestrial fauna. Over-exploitation, pollution, habitat fragmentation, habitat 

degradation or destruction, introduction of non-indigenous species, changes in current 

flow regime due to damn and water supply withdrawal systems, and land use changes 

are some of the major stressors (Geist, 2011). An increase in scale of threats implies an 

increase in the management effort. Although in the past few years there has been much 

improvement in physico-chemical, biological and ecological assessment, there has been 

little progress in the integrated management of water resources in a way that failed to 

stop deterioration (Verdonschot, 2000). A successful management can only be achieved 

by filling the gap between scientific quality information with collaborative involvement of 

the stakeholders and managers (Barmuta et al., 2011). 

The WFD establishes five different quality classes, namely high, good, moderate, 

poor and bad and requires that Member States classify all water bodies. The 

implementation of monitoring programs will provide a coherent assessment between 



Chapter I

countries aiming at supporting the elaboration of programs of measures to restore water 

bodies below good status.  

The ecological status is obtained by the Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR), which 

represents the deviation of the water body from the reference condition (undisturbed or 

minimally disturbed). The EQR is expressed by a numerical scale between 0 and a value 

slightly above 1, where values near zero stand for bad ecological status and values near 

one for high ecological status (Bernardo et al., 2009).  

The major challenge in Portugal was the lack of historical data for most aquatic 

systems and biomonitoring programs. Adequate ecological quality assessment tools, 

including sampling methods, metrics and biotic indices were not available (Bernardo et 

al., 2009). Therefore, the Portuguese Water Institute (INAG) defined reference conditions 

for each type of river, carried out the selection of metrics responsive to stressors for each 

element of biological quality and established criteria for the classification of ecological 

status for all biological, chemical, physicochemical and hydromorphological components 

(INAG, 2009). 

The WFD brought a change in the monitoring approach of rivers and streams, 

replacing an anthropocentric perspective by an ecocentric perspective, focused on 

ecosystem structure instead of considering water merely as a resource. 

 

Benthic macroinvertebrates as important ecologic indicators 

The WFD requires that the assessment of ecological water quality is integrated 

by a set of biological elements such as fish, aquatic flora and benthic invertebrates to 

assess the ecological water quality.  

In stream systems, benthic macroinvertebrates are one of the biological elements 

most frequently used to assess ecological status. These animals with no backbones 

inhabit the streambed substrate are visible to the naked eye and able to be caught in a 

500 ?m screen (Duan et al., 2009), although this mesh size is not consensual among all 

authors (e.g., De Pauw et al., 2006). This group comprises a wide diversity of species 

belonging to different taxonomic groups, mainly aquatic larval stages of insects, but it 

also includes arthropods, worms and leaches, bivalves and snails, among others. 

Benthic macroinvertebrate communities play a key-role in the food web of stream 

ecosystems, linking producers and top predators (Song et al., 2007). Thus, they are an 

important source of food and energy to higher levels on the food web, mainly 

ichthyofauna but also other vertebrates. A variety of species with different feeding 

strategies, including the consumption of algae and bacteria, or leaves and organic matter 

are considered in this group (Duan et al., 2009). When benthic invertebrates die, they 

decay, leaving behind nutrients that are reused by aquatic plants and other animals in the 

food chain (Duan et al., 2009). 



Chapter I

Macroinvertebrate communities are a key tool for assessing ecological quality 

because disturbances in the ecosystem change the community structure (Pires et al., 

2000). Some major characteristics of these organisms make them good bioindicators: a) 

they are ubiquitous and relatively sedentary; b) they have a great range of taxonomic and 

functional feeding groups (Rosado et al., 2011); c) they have a life cycle long enough to 

provide information about the stress conditions to which they were exposed (Fano et al., 

2003; Duan et al., 2009); d) their high abundance; e) they are easy to sample; f) they 

quickly recolonize the streambed (Lüderitz et al., 2004); g) they show a wide range of 

tolerance levels, because they include a great variety of species; h) they differ in their 

sensitivity to water pollution and can integrate environmental changes in physical, 

chemical, and ecological characteristics of their habitat over time and space (Milbrink, 

1983). Accordingly, these diverse communities are essential to evaluate and help to 

maintain the ecological integrity of streams. 

 

 

Streams of the Santo André and Melides River Basins, a case study 

Santo André and Melides River basins are exposed to a Mediterranean climate. 

This climate can be defined as oceanic temperate, humid and moderately rainy (Cancela 

da Fonseca et al., 1993). Winter is characterized by relatively abundant rainfall, with 

average temperatures relatively low. Summer is dry with low rainfall and high 

temperatures. This characteristics fall into Koppen classification of a humid mesothermic 

climate (Csb) with a warm season not too long and warm (Cancela da Fonseca et al., 

1993). 

Mediterranean streams are physically, chemically, and biologically shaped by 

sequential, predictable, seasonal events of flooding and drying over an annual cycle 

(Gasith and Resh, 1999). The duration of these events affect drought intensity, which 

may range from declines in discharge below average base flow levels, to intermittency, to 

sections drying and, ultimately to stream drought (Boix et al., 2010). These River basins 

are located in Alentejo (Southern Portugal), where the average annual temperature is 

approximately 15,8ºC, with the lowest temperatures registered in December and January 

and the highest values in July, August and September (ARH Alentejo, 2011).The average 

annual precipitation is 523 mm and irregular throughout the year (ERENA, 2005). The 

rainiest period occurs in December and January, accounting for about 40% of annual 

rainfall, and the less rainy season in July and August where the rain fall can be null (ARH 

Alentejo, 2011). Hence, the streams of these basins have a torrential regime with 

abundant flow in winter and very low flow in summer. 

The Santo André River basin has a 60,2 km perimeter and drains a 145 km
2
 area into 

the Santo André Lagoon (DSRH, 2004), while Melides River basin has a draining area of 

65 km
2
 (Freitas et al., 2002; Costa et al., 2003). These lagoons are separated from the 

Atlantic Ocean by sand barriers but occasionally sea water flows over the dunes and 

once a year (March/April) – St. André, or several times Melides – the lagoons are

artificially opened. This procedure assures colonization by marine species during regular 

communication periods between the lagoons and the sea.  

 

Socio-economic context 

Historically, fishing and agriculture are the most important activities that took place in 

the surrounding areas of the Santo André and Melides watersheds, held for more than 

two centuries (Silveira et al., 2006). Nowadays, these two activities are still of high social 

and economic importance. During the last years fishing is the main economic activity in 

Santo André Lagoon; meanwhile, and in spite of some fishing activity locally important, 

rice production is by far the most profitable activity in the Melides area. At the Melides 

lagoon, man-made sea openings are established whenever it is necessary to prevent the 

rising of brackish water and its overwash into the rice fields. Both lagoonal environments 

are also used for recreational purposes. Several economically important fish species 

occur in these lagoons. 10-100 tons of fish are harvested annually in Santo André and 

the eel, Anguilla anguilla, was the only important catch during the last years (Bernardo, 

1990; Costa et al., 2003).  

Eel fisheries at Santo André lagoon involve 30-50 fishermen with small rowboats, 

being the fyke net the main used fishing gear (Silveira et al., 2009). Eels’ fishing in the 

lagoon is of remarkable importance, not only regionally but nationally, with local 

discharges of this species representing more than half the national discharges in some 

years (Silveira et al., 2006). The capture of other species like Dicentrachus labrax or 

Sparus aurata also occurs, but to a lesser extent (Bernardo, 1990). 

Agriculture is currently essentially of subsistence dominated by small family farms, 

with only a small number of farmers producing extensive crops and legumes for sale 

(ICN, 2000). This activity is mostly limited to the surrounding area of the Santo André 

lagoon, especially in the floodplains of Cascalheira and Badoca streams. Cereals crops 

(oat) are the major agriculture production outside the floodplains, complemented with 

pasture. Livestock has some importance in the region with extensive exploitation of cattle, 

goats and sheep (ICN, 2000). A significant number of pig farms are also present in the 

Santo André river basin.  

Tourism is an important economic activity, with greater importance during summer, 

although this activity occurs throughout the year. The lagoon is used as a bathing area 

and also for nautical sports. However this area is most sought after by its natural 

surroundings, especially for hiking and visitation throughout the year (CEZH / RNLSAS, 

2004).  

In Melides, the rice production has a high expression, and these crops occupy the 

entire area surrounding the downstream area of the Melides stream, using its flow during 

the floodplain flooding period. In 2008, 12 rice producers were registered in the floodplain 

of the Melides lagoon,  with a production of 1050 ton, which corresponds to about 7000 

kg / ha, most of the production being sent to 3 milling factories in Alcácer do Sal (Cecílio, 



Chapter I 
 

17 
 

SA), Figueira da Foz (Ernesto Morgado) and Oliveira de Azeméis (Valente Marques) 

(Freitas et al., 2008). Apart from this activity, agriculture is mainly for subsistence, being 

mainly constituted by small family farms. In this watershed, livestock is reduced, with 2 

pig farms, 4 cattle farms and 6 sheep farms reported as extensive to semi-intensive 

systems, in 2006 (Brigada de Fiscalização do Litoral, 2006).  

As in Santo André lagoon, tourism is a major economic activity during summer 

months, mainly because of the beaches, however rural tourism is an additional source of 

income all year round.  

With all these economic and leisure activities, both studied basins have a high 

importance for the region, not only for local residents but also for tourists who visit this 

destinations all year. Different type and intensity of human activities affect biological 

communities in different ways and magnitude. Since the streams drain into the Santo 

André and Melides lagoons it is also important to know the socio-economic activities 

directly attached to these latter. 

 

Aims and importance of this study 

 The growing pressure on our water ecosystems, not only by direct human 

activities, but also by climate change as led to an increasing concern about water 

resource and the associated biodiversity loss that is at stake. Studies on freshwater 

ecosystems have significantly grown in the past few years, and consequently scientific 

literature focusing on this issue (Oertli et al., 2009). However, in Portugal, scientific data 

on macroinvertebrate communities and how they respond to anthropogenic and natural 

stressors is still scarce. Before the WFD implementation process only a few studies on 

benthic macroinvertebrates communities and their responses to stressors were available 

(e.g., Coimbra et al., 1996). Although a great effort was conducted since 2000, 

knowledge on aquatic ecosystems and the achievement of good ecological status of 

Portuguese water bodies until 2015 is still not likely to be accomplished. This thesis was 

developed in the aim of the project GroundScene (PTDC/AAC-AMB/104639/2008), with 

the purpose of contributing to the implementation of the WFD. 

 Thus, the main objectives of this study in the Santo André and Melides River 

basins are: 

 

1. To understand what are the major environmental variables structuring the 

benthic macroinvertebrate communities in these streams ; 

2. To assess the ecological status of these river basins and evaluate the 

adequacy of the available assessment tools.

Abstract: Benthic macroinvertebrate communities and environmental variables of 13 

sites of two nearby small Mediterranean river basins, Santo André and Melides, were 

assessed in one sample occasion in spring using a standardized methodology. A total of 

94 taxa, mostly identified to family level, were recorded. The insects predominate in all 

samples that were mainly characterized by the presence of euribiont groups, such as 

Chironomidae, Amphipoda and Oligochaeta. Non-insecta and eurihaline taxa increase at 

downstream locations. Principal Coordinate analysis (PCO) was used to emphasise 

variation of benthic macroinvertebrate communities and their relationship with 

environmental variables. These variables, mainly dissolved oxygen, grain-size and 

organic matter, greatly determine the structure of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. 

Changes in these variables may favour a higher density of organisms or a higher 

richness of taxa. These are the first results to the knowledge of these poorly understood 

stream ecosystems. 

Key words: stream, River basin, Mediterranean, benthic macroinvertebrates, insecta.

Introduction 

Stream ecology and, in particular, benthic invertebrate communities are mainly 

influenced by substrate quality and heterogeneity (e.g., Beisel et al., 2000), pH, nutrients, 

oxygen and organic matter concentration (e.g., Alba-Tercedor and Sánchez-Ortega, 

1988), but also by hydrological conditions such as water permanence (Bonada et al., 

2006) and geomorphology characteristics such as altitude and slope (Feio et al., 2005). 

Interactions between these multiple factors determine the spatial gradients established in 

freshwater systems. Nevertheless, anthropogenic pressures can modify these spatial 

patterns, since human activities might cause significant changes on stream hydrology 

and physical-chemical characteristics.  

 Benthic macroinvertebrate are one of the most studied biological communities in 

running waters, due to their qualities as bioindicators (Rada and Puljas, 2008). The 

structure of these communities react to a variety of chemical and physical variations, and 

because benthic macroinvertebrates have an intermediate position on the food web, 

natural or manmade shifts have consequences on them, and consequently in ecosystem 

processes.  



Chapter II 

23 
 

The high seasonal variability of stream invertebrates occurring in Mediterranean 

areas is strongly influenced by climatic events. Mediterranean streams have annual and 

inter-annual flow variability with the occurrence of frequent floods and droughts. This high 

variability implies a reorganization of macroinvertebrate communities, as the habitat is 

highly modified, first by the loss of riffles and secondly by the loss of pools (Bonada, 

2003), leading to a reduction in the number of taxa (Graça et al., 2004). Knowledge of 

Mediterranean streams has been improving in recent years (e.g., Bonada et al., 2000; 

Vivas et al., 2002). In Portugal, the study of Mediterranean streams (located in the 

South), led to the conclusion that the communities of benthic macroinvertebrates contain 

a lower taxonomic richness than those found in streams of North and Centre (Graça et 

al., 2004). In Southwest Portugal, few studies have been developed which leads to a lack 

of knowledge of their communities, how they respond to environmental variables and if 

they correspond to those found in other Mediterranean streams. 

Mediterranean streams are physically, chemically, and biologically shaped by 

sequential, predictable, seasonal events of flooding and drying over an annual cycle 

(Gasith and Resh, 1999). This annual cycle leads to abundant flow in winter and very low 

flow in summer, which ultimately can lead to stream drought (Boix et al., 2010). The 

variability of flow is enhanced in small river basins such as Santo André and Melides, 

since the small length of its streams lead to a rapid response to rainfall (Spruill et al., 

2000). 

This study aims to present and examine collected data on the benthic 

macroinvertebrate community’s structure of Santo André and Melides River basin 

streams by determining a) their taxa composition and richness and determine whether 

they correspond those found in other Mediterranean river; b) if the benthic 

macroinvertebrate communities of both River basins are similar; and c) investigate the 

relative contribution of several environmental variables in explaining the observed 

structure variation. 

 

Methods 

Study area 

This study took place in two small river basins, Santo André and Melides River 

basins, included in the Sado and Mira basins Hydrographic Region and under the 

administration of ARH Alentejo (Administration of Alentejo Hydrographic Region). The 

hydrographic regions were defined in the aim of the Water Framework Directive, which 

determines that each Member-State must aggregate river basins into specific 

hydrographic region and assign it to a competent authority (European Commission, 

2000). This normative was implemented by the publication of the Portuguese Water Law 

(Law 58/2005) that establishes hydrographic regions as the planning and water

management divisions. Part of the study area is also included in a protected area, Lagoas 

de Santo André e da Sancha Natural Reserve. 

A total of 13 locations were selected for this study, 7 located at the Melides river 

basin and 6 at the Santo André river basin. Four different locations were selected at the 

Melides stream (RML 1, RML 2, RML 3 and RML 4) and two additional stations were 

located in the tributaries Samoucal (SAM) and Cabo d’Água (CAG) (Figure 2.1.). In the 

Santo André river basin, sampling stations were located at Poço dos Caniços, Badoca, 

Cascalheira and Chaparros streams, these last two with an upstream and a downstream 

station.The Cascalheira and Badoca streams and Poço dos Caniços are included in the 

protected area Lagoas de Santo André e da Sancha Natural Reserve. The studied 

streams depend on the top phreatic aquifer, except for Fonte dos Olhos that drains water 

from the deep carbonate aquifer (Tibor Stigter, pers. comm.).  

This region is influenced by an atmospheric circulation regime that affects all the 

coastline of southern Portugal, associated with the proximity to the Atlantic and the Golf 

Current, and local topographic factors. This is an area characterized by a Mediterranean 

climate with dry to sub-humid typical weather (Cancela da Fonseca et al., 1993).

Sampling 

Sampling took place in spring, May of 2011, as recommended by INAG (2008). 

Several environmental variables were measured in situ with a portable probe (YSI 

600XLM): water temperature (WT – °C), conductivity (Cond – mS/cm), dissolved oxygen 

(DO – mg/L) and total dissolved solids (TDS – g/L). 

Current speed (CS – m/s) was measured with a model 105 Valeport current 

meter. Depth (Dep – m) was also measured. Water samples were collected prior to the 

macroinvertebrate and sediment sampling to avoid bias the results. Five litres of water 

were collected at each site, refrigerated and transported to the certified laboratory of ARH 

Alentejo, for nitrates (NO3 – mg/L), nitrites (NO2 – mg/L), phosphorous (P – mg/L), 

ammonia (NH4 – mg/L) and chlorophyll a (Chl a – µg/L) analysis.  

Sediment samples were collected to estimate total organic content (TOC – %) 

and grain size. TOC was obtained by loss on ignition (480°C during, at least, 12 hours in 

a muffle) after drying samples in the stove at 60°C for 24 hours (Pereira et al., 1997). For 

sediment grain size, samples dried during 48 hours at 60°C, were sieved through 

different mesh sizes (2.00 mm, 0.50 mm, 0.25 mm and 0.063 mm) and each resultant 

fraction weighted.  

Macroinvertebrates were collected with a 30x30 cm kick-net, with a 250 µm mesh 

size, used to kick/sweep representatively major habitat types identified at each sampling 

site during 60 seconds. The overture of the net was placed in the upstream direction to 

ensure that the organisms displaced by the river flow when removing sediments were 

drawn into the net. The same operator collected all macroinvertebrate samples, in order 

to minimize the sampling variability. Samples were fixed in 70% ethanol, transported to 

the laboratory, where they were rinsed using a sieve of 500 ?m mesh size. Each sample 

was sorted in order to separate all individuals; these were counted and identified to the 

family level using a binocular stereomicroscope, with some exceptions (eg., Oligochaeta, 

Nematoda, Ostracoda), according to Tachet et al. (2000). 

 

Data analysis 

  
Mean abundance by sampling time (individuals/60’) was calculated for each 

sampling site. A Hierarchical Cluster Analysis was conducted to identify groups of 

stations, based on the macroinvertebrate abundance data. Data was previously log(x + 1) 

transformed to reduce the influence of the most abundant species over the less 

represented. Resemblance between samples was based on the Bray-Curtis similarity 

coefficient and the group-average linkage method was used to group observations. A 

similarity level of 40% was used to identify groups of stations. A non-parametric test, 

ANOSIM (Analysis of Similarities) was performed to determine if groups of stations 

identified with the Cluster analysis were significantly different (p&lt;0,01). A SIMPER 

(Similarity Percentage Breakdown Procedure) analysis was used to determine the 



Chapter II 

26 
 

similarity level within and between groups and identify which taxa contributed most to 

those similarities/dissimilarities. An n-MDS (non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling - MDS) 

ordination technique was also conducted on presence/absence data of invertebrate 

communities, to identify spatial taxonomic patterns based on the Bray–Curtis similarity 

coefficient. Different symbols were used to identify stations located at Melides and Santo 

André River basins and an ANOSIM test was conducted to determine if there were 

significant taxonomic differences between river basins (p&lt;0,01).  

A Principal Coordinates analysis (PCO was conducted on log(x + 1) transformed 

abundance data of macroinvertebrate communities), using Bray-Curtis similarity as a 

resemblance measure. Spearman correlations of the environmental variables with the 

PCO axes were calculated, to understand the major environmental variables structuring 

the benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Those variables were represented in the 

PCO ordination as vectors. A similar procedure was conducted on presence/absence 

data, to understand the relation between environmental variables and the taxonomic 

patterns. Add-on). All procedures were performed using the PERMANOVA + PRIMER 6 

software package (Clarke and Gorley, 2006).  

Prior to this analysis, grain-size data was processed in the program GRADISTAT 

(Blott and Pye, 2001), a grain size distribution and statistics package for the analysis of 

unconsolidated sediments. Mean grain-sizes were logarithmically calculated in phi (?) 

units, where ?=-log2 d, and d the grain diameter in millimetres (mm), using the Folk and 

Ward graphical method (1957). The phi scale is widely used instead of the millimetre 

scale, since it follows a normal distribution and is more appropriate to statistic analyses 

(Blott and Pye, 2001). The use of this notation implies the use of both positive and 

negative values, since particles larger than 2mm have negative phi units. Thus, more 

negative phi values are associated to coarser sediment. 

 

 

Results 

 In the present study a total of 29959 macroinvertebrate specimens were 

collected, with a density of 1352,513 ind/60’ (804,905 ind/60’ in Melides River basin and 

1991,389 ind/60’ in Santo André River basin). A total of 94 different taxa were identified 

(see appendix), including 11 major taxonomical groups (Mollusca: Bivalvia, Gastropoda; 

Annelida: Oligochaeta; Arthropoda: Crustacea – Amphipoda, Insecta – Coleoptera, 

Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Hemiptera-Heteroptera, Odonata, Plecoptera, Tricoptera – 

Figure 2.2), 52 found in Santo André and 86 in Melides. Diptera was the most 

represented group, due to a predominant occurrence of chironomids through all sampling 

sites, particularly in CAN (Figure 2.3), followed by Amphipoda and Oligochaeta. Insects 

are dominant in these streams, even though non-insect organisms, such as Amphipoda, 

Oligochaeta or Gastropoda, are predominant in several sites such as RML 4, CAS 2, 

OLH and CHA 2. The class Gastropoda has a greater relevance in the Melides river

The cluster analysis of the benthic macroinvertebrates indicated two major 

groups of stations, at a similarity level of 40%, namely group A (OLH, RML 2, CHA 1, 

CHA 2) and group B (CAS 2, BAD, CAG, RML 1, SAM, CAS 1, RML 3, RML 4), with 

location CAN clearly separated from all other stations (Figure 2.4). The ANOSIM 

test showed that groups A and B were significantly different (R=0,469; p&lt;0,01). The 

SIMPER analysis showed an average similarity of 46,94% within group A and indicated 

that Gammaridae (24,55%), Oligochaeta (22,25%) and Chironomidae (21,59%) gave the 

highest contributions). Chironomidae (19,91%) also plays an important role in the 

resemblance within group B, followed by families Baetidae (16,62%) and Simuliidae 

(10,89%) (with an average similarity of 44,65%) (Figure 2.5). These groups exhibit a level 

of dissimilarity of 62,91%, with Baetidae (6,13%), Gammaridae (5,55%) and Simuliidae 

(5,10%) as the taxa that contributed more for this dissimilarity.

MDS ordination of the presence/absence dataset showed a separation of the 

benthic composition between river basins (Figure 2.6), with a stress of 0,18 – stress 

values greater than 0,2 indicate that the plotting is close to random, stress values lower 

than 0,2 indicate a useful two-dimensional image and less than 0,1 corresponds to an 

ideal ordination (Clarke, 1993). There are significant differences between river basins, as 

indicated by the ANOSIM test (R=0,485; p&lt;0,01).

Environmental variables are presented in Table 2.1. CAN sampling site registered 

higher values in six of the thirteen measured variables (TOC, WT, Con, TDS, Chl a and 

P). The same stream had the coarser and finer sediment, in the sites CAS 1 and CAS 2, 

respectively. Besides CAN, CHA 2 also had the higher value of total organic content. 

Higher concentrations of dissolved oxygen occurred in CAG and RML 1 sites. The depth 

of all sites is relatively low, ranging between 0,20m and 1m. Lentic environments with a 

flow so low that was unmeasurable were noticed in CAN, CHA 1, CHA 2 and RML 1. 

Greater concentrations of nitrates and nitrites were found in BAD stream. 

The first two axes of the PCO conducted on density data accounted for 45,3% of 

variance (Figure 2.7). Correlations of environmental variables with the first axis suggest 

dissolved oxygen (0,59), total organic content (0,51) and sediment grain-size (-0,47) as 

the variables most related to the benthic macroinvertebrate community patterns. Higher 

concentrations of dissolved oxygen are more related with the sampling sites of group B, 

and higher concentration of organic matter and finer sediments with group A. The 

relationship between the presence/absence of taxa and the environmental variables 



Chapter II 

31 
 

(Figure 2.8 - the first two axes explain 43% of the variability) emphasize sediment grain-

size and chlorophyll a as the most correlated with the first axis (-0,49 and -0,62, 

respectively). In general, finer sediments characterize Santo André sampling sites while 

Melides sampling sites are characterized by coarser sediments.

Discussion 

Patterns of macroinvertebrate communities are expected to be best explained by 

a combination of numerous environmental variables, although sometimes single variables 

might explain a major part of the observed variation (Wiberg-Larsen et al., 2000). The 

properties of a habitat within an aquatic ecosystem are assumed to determine the types 

of macroinvertebrate communities (Bailey et al., 2004). Insects, amphipods (Crustacea), 

oligochaetes (Annelida) and molluscs were the dominant groups in the study area, 

similarly to what was found in other stream ecosystems (eg. Vivas et al., 2002; Acuñaet 

al., 2005; Maiolini et al., 2006). This higher proportion is due to the fact that this class is 

characterized as highly dispersive (Vinson and Hawkins, 1998) and in case of 

disturbances the recolonization from some other near-by stream, in the same catchment 

or from beyond that, will normally repair damage in a few insect generations’ time (Zwick, 

1992). 

 Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies), Odonata (dragonflies), 

Trichoptera (caddisflies), Coleoptera (riffle beetles), and Diptera (true flies) were the 

orders of Insecta found. As documented in other Mediterranean streams, the dipterans 

were the most abundant group, mostly represented by chironomids (Chironomidae) that 

were present in all sampling sites (e.g., Coimbra et al., 1996; Bonada et al., 2000; Vivas

et al., 2002; Acuña et al., 2005; Chaves et al., 2008). In Mediterranean streams, other 

authors registered a tendency of Diptera predominance followed by Ephemeroptera (eg. 

Coimbra et al., 1996; Pires et al., 2000; Vivas et al., 2002) which is not observed in these 

streams, since the Gammaridae are the second dominant group. This can be explained 

by the location of these two river basins in a low land area, close to the coast, with much 

less areas with a lotic regime, that is preferred by the majority of the Ephemeroptera 

(Gasith and Resh, 1999). The dominance of Gammaridae over other groups occurs 

mainly in RML 4, CAS 2 and CHA 2 sampling sites that are downstream locations. Here, 

one of the common found taxa is Gammarus chevreuxi a highly mobile species that can 

be found in brackish and freshwater (Subida et al., 2009). As it is well known (Maitland, 

1966; Mancinelli, 2012), movements between the lagoons and the streams can be 

considered a possibility for this group of crustaceans. Also, Santo André and Melides 

lagoons are supplied by two aquifers, one shallow and other deep and calcareous, which 

may enhance the occurrence of Gammaridae, known to occur in calcareous waters. 

Although chironomids occur throughout all locations, the density found in CAN 

was extremely high when compared to all other sampling sites (4069,33 ind/60’). 

Chironomids are pioneer species, ubiquitous, highly mobile and resistant to disturbances 

(Acuña et al., 2005). They are known to be little affected by environmental changes and 

promptly recolonize following disturbance (Pires et al., 2000). This is in agreement with 

the highly stressful environment noticed in CAN sampling site, with an intermittent regime, 

strongly affected by salinity variations due to freshwater flooding during a period of the 

year and brackish water flushing events related to the Santo André lagoon level rise in 

other periods. High values of conductivity, temperature, dissolved solids and chlorophyll a 

were registered, which are only sustained by the most tolerant (and generalist) species, 

leading to a low diversity. 

Besides CAN, other conspicuous sampling site is OLH, an artificialized spring 

with a high density of Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Mollusca, Gastropoda). This species is 

found in estuaries, brackish waters and in freshwater systems (Robson, 1923; Boycott, 

1936); initially exclusive of estuarine and brackish waters, it is known to be an invader in 

freshwater ecosystems (Boycott, 1936; Hunter and Warwick, 1957). It is extremely active, 

travelling at speeds up to 3 cm/min (Heywood and Edwards, 1962), prefers sandy 

bottoms (Dorgelo, 1988), constant temperatures and flow (Richards et al., 2001) and has 

a wide tolerance to nutrient enrichment (Alonso and Camargo, 2003). This is consistent 

with the characteristics and concentration of nitrates found in this sampling site. Múrria et 

al. (2008) found a negative relation between P. antipodarum and Chironomidae, which 

may be caused by the movement of this mollusc that displaces chironomids from their 

tubes. This can be an explanation for the lower density of chironomids in this site (as 

generally occurs in Mediterranean streams). 

In general, non-insect taxa were found with a large density in RML 4, CAS 2, 

CHA 2, and OLH. This suggests that these locations have a lower probability of extreme

events, such as droughts. In fact, drought effects are linked to intrinsic characteristics of 

organisms, such as the ability to take refuge, high colonization rates and delayed 

hatching of drought-resistant eggs (Delucchi, 1988). Locations characterized by 

intermittency have a higher percentage of insects since colonization with flying taxa is 

faster and simpler, because their adult forms are not aquatic. As stated by Meyer et al. 

(2003), stream drying requires a high tolerance or specific adaptations of the aquatic 

fauna. Organisms with a full aquatic life-cycle are not able to colonize these locations, 

since the migration is more difficult and time consuming, and one drought event can put 

in jeopardy the whole community. 

Two different groupings were identified when using macroinvertebrate densities 

and presence/absence, indicating that although the Melides and Santo André river basins 

have distinct taxonomic compositions, the dominant taxa show the influence of other 

major habitats characteristics. Groups identified based on the taxa density of individuals 

and their respective taxa, indicate a separation between lotic habitats (group A) and lentic 

locations and with an interface with groundwater (group B). While the first group is 

characterized by the dominance of Gammaridae, Oligochaeta and Chironomidae 

(21,59%), group B has Chironomidae, Baetidae and Simuliidae as major common taxa. 

The PCO results show that higher concentration of dissolved oxygen, lower 

concentrations of total organic content, and coarser grain-size are associated to the 

stations of group B. The opposite is characteristic of group A. A lower velocity flow 

decreases the transport capacity of both inorganic and organic matter, which leads to 

deposition. As these are small streams with riparian gallery, although there is no transport 

of organic material in these locations due to the reduced flow and the reduced autotrophic 

productivity outstanding the shading caused by such gallery, they contribute with a 

significant amount of organic matter, considered therefore allochthonous (Vannote, et 

al.,1980; Allan and Castillo, 2007). The decomposition of that organic matter leads to an 

increased biochemical oxygen demand, due to direct chemical reactions and aerobic 

respiration, with consequent decreasing of dissolved oxygen (Brabec et al., 2004; Allan 

and Castillo, 2007). Though OLH sampling site (group A) does not have a low current 

speed, it has a groundwater interface. Groundwater frequently has very low 

concentrations of dissolved oxygen, but an enriched concentration of carbon dioxide due 

to microbial processing of organic matter as water passes through soil (Allan and Castillo, 

2007). CAN sampling site with an elevated food availability and benthic 

macroinvertebrate density, but low taxa richness is an example of what was pointed out 

by Chaves et al. (2005) in streams of the Mondego River basin, in which invertebrate 

densities were related with food availability (organic matter), while taxa richness was 

highly associated with hydraulic-related parameters controlled by climatic conditions.  

Santo André river basin has a higher density of benthic macroinvertebrates, but a 

lower taxonomic richness when compared to Melides river basin. This suggests that 

Santo André River basin communities are mostly based on generalist and opportunistic

groups of organisms (Dauer et al., 1992). Further, analyses show that Melides taxa are 

constrained by coarser sediments.  As pointed out by several authors, less diverse 

stations were related to finer sediment grain size, especially sands, since size and 

mobility of their particles constrain benthic communities to species capable of penetrating 

the substrate interstices (e.g. Beisel et al., 1998; Pinto and Feio, 2009; Duan et al., 2009). 

Habitats characterized by fine sediment are more homogeneous, which implies less 

habitat diversity and removes much of its potential to accommodate a wider range of 

species. (Vannote et al., 1980; Beisel et al., 1998). 

 

 

Conclusions 

The structure of the communities found in the present study streams is different 

from others recorded in different mediterranean streams. The sampling locations are in 

general, similar in density of the dominant taxa, with a large number of specimens of 

euribionts, tolerant to a large variety of conditions, ubiquitous and pioneers, mostly from 

Chironomidae family of the Diptera order. The sampling sites located downstream had a 

larger percentage of non-insecta with the occurrence of eurihaline families, which migrate 

between the streams and the respective lagoons. Overall, the Melides River basin holds 

a greater taxonomic richness than the Santo André River basin. 

The results obtained show that abiotic factors greatly influence the structure of 

benthic macroinvertebrate communities, with dissolved oxygen, grain-size and organic 

matter constraining these benthic macroinvertebrate communities.

Abstract: The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires the achievement of 

a “good” ecological status of water bodies giving great importance to biological 

components of the ecosystems. Within this framework, a multimetric index for the 

evaluation of ecological quality based on benthic macroinvertebrate communities 

(Portuguese multimetric index of the South, IPtIs) was applied in Santo André and 

Melides River basins. As part of an integrative approach physical-chemical, riparian and 

fluvial habitat qualities were also took into account. It was found that all but three of the 

thirteen sampling sites achieved the goal of the WFD. However, it was also found that 

this index has low responsivity in lentic environments or with groundwater sources what 

may give rise to an underestimation of the ecological quality in these ecosystems. 

 

Key words: IPtIs, macroinvertebrates, ecological quality, stressors. 

 

 

 

Introduction 

Freshwater habitats can be considered hotspots of biodiversity since they provide 

goods and services of great value to human societies in matters of economy, culture, 

leisure, aesthetics, science and education. However, they are also under several human 

pressures due to their use for irrigation, waste disposal, harvest of plants, industries, 

farming, among others. These activities have negative effects, such as loss of 

biodiversity, habitat degradation and fragmentation, flow modification and invasion of 

non-native species. Variations in environmental conditions such as fluctuations in 

temperature, precipitation and nutrients concentrations also cause important changes in 

freshwater ecosystems.  

 Setting environmental objectives for aquatic systems has become a worldwide 

concern and the Water Framework Directive was published in the European Union 

(2000/60/CE) with the objective of protecting and improving the waterbodies’ status, not 

only for human purposes but for maintaining the integrity of these ecosystems “per se”. 

The WFD sets the achievement of good ecological status and good chemical status for 

surface waters by 2015 as its major objectives. The ecological status is understood as 

the expression of the structural and functional quality of aquatic ecosystems associated 

to surface waters (European Commission, 2000). The WFD gives great importance to the 

biological components of the ecosystem, recognizing that chemical water quality alone is 



Chapter III 

43 
 

inadequate to predict or evaluate the overall environment quality or the potential impacts 

of forcing factors at the community and ecosystem levels (Fano et al., 2003; Mistri et al., 

2008). Hence, a chemical approach is associated to an ecological one, which has aquatic 

communities such as benthic macroinvertebrates as resource. The assessment of 

ecological status requires the development of adequate tools, based on the identification 

of surface water types, the definition of type-specific reference conditions, and the 

classification of all water bodies within five ecological quality classes, ranging from high to 

bad (European Commission, 2000). 

 In the case of rivers, the recommended biological elements for ecological status 

classification are: composition, abundance and age distribution of fish fauna; composition 

and abundance of aquatic flora and benthic macroinvertebrates (European Comission, 

2000). Water types were defined in order to define adequate reference conditions for 

areas with similar characteristics, so that ecological status classifications are comparable 

between rivers. In Portugal, the identification of river types was based on the following 

factors: altitude, size of catchment area, latitude, longitude, geology, runoff, slope, 

medium flow, average annual precipitation, coefficient of variation of precipitation, annual 

mean temperature and amplitude (INAG, 2008).  

 Benthic macroinvertebrates are widely used as ecological indicators and several 

metrics are commonly used in Europe, such as: eveness (J), richness, the Shannon-

Weiner diversity (H’), the Belgium Biotic Index (BBI), the Extended Biotic Index (EBI), the 

Danish Stream Fauna Index (DSFI), the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) 

andthe Average Score per Taxa (ASPT) (Morais et al., 2004). The BMWP and ASPT, 

were later adapted to the Iberian Peninsula resulting in the indices IBMWP and IASPT 

(Alba-Tercedor et al., 2002). Shannon-Weiner index, eveness and richness are diversity 

metrics, while BBI, EBI, DSFI, (I)BMWP and (I)ASPT are based on the tolerance or 

sensitiveness of taxa to pollution. These later score each taxonomic group, based on the 

existing knowledge concerning their tolerance to pollution. No specific assessment tools 

were developed to assess the ecological status based on benthic macroinvertebrates in 

Portugal before the implementation of the WFD. Two multimetric indices were recently 

proposed, one applied to the majority of the river types of the Northern region and the 

otheradapted for rivers and streams of the Souther region, the Portuguese multimetric 

index of the North (Índice Português de Invertebrados do Norte), IPtIN, and the 

Portuguese multimetric index of the South (Índice Português de Invertebrados do Sul), 

IPtIs, respectively (INAG, 2009). Metrics that integrate both indices (widely used in 

Europe) allow determining the composition and abundance of benthic macroinvertebrate 

taxa, describe gradients of degradation and discriminate quality classes. The recent 

creation of these indices has not yet allowed their wide use unlike other European indices 

(e.g., IBMWP).These indices have been improved over time to better translate ecological 

quality of the sampled sites. The validation of these new indices requires testing its

applicability to different river and habitat types, in order to assess their accuracy to 

discriminate between disturbed and undisturbed systems and to improve its performance. 

 This study has two main objectives: 

 

a) Assess the ecological quality of the sampling sites; 

b) Evaluate the adequacy of the applied tools. 

 

 

Methodology 

Sampling 

This study was performed in streams of Santo André and Melides River basins 

belonging to the type Small lowland streams of southern Portugal (S1;&amp;lt;=100). The 

sampling methods were the same as indicated in Chapter II. 

 

Data analysis 

 The Portuguese multimetric index of the South (IPtIs) was used to assess the 

ecological status at each sampling site. This index was calculated using the software 

AMIIB@, avalilable at the Portuguese Water Institute website. IPtIs is a multimetric index 

that includes other indices previously developed that integrate information on 

sensitive/tolerant taxa, such as the IBMWP (Iberian Bio-Monitoring Working Party) and 

the IASPT (Index of Average Score per Taxon). IPtIs is calculated as indicated in Table 

3.1. 

 

Table 3.1 – Description of the calculation of IPtIs and included metrics (INAG, 2009).

The final value of the index results from the sum of the weighted metrics. Two 

normalization steps are performed: i) each metric is multiplied by the reference value 

(Tables 3.2); ii) after the quotient between the value obtained and the reference value of 



Chapter III 

45 
 

this type of river (median of the reference condition, 0,99) will be determined (Table 3.3). 

This normalization steps aim at obtaining a final value expressed as Ecological Quality 

Ratios (EQR). The definition of the environmental status from the value of EQR is carried 

out under a set of five classes as in IBMWP and have five colors to distinguish the level 

of disturbance of each sample site (Table 3.4). The Shannon-Weiner diversity and 

eveness were also calculated using the same software in order to perceive if diversity is a 

factor influencing the biotic index. A Hierarchical Cluster Analysis was performed to 

understand which metrics were more correlated to the final result of the biotic index, 

based on a resemblance matrix calculated using Spearman rank correlations between 

metrics.

For the purpose of achieving an integrated approach (as demanded by the WFD), 

several physical and chemical parameters were measured at each site. The riparian 

vegetation quality (QBR index) and the habitat diversity (IHF index) (Jáimez-Cuéllar et al., 

2004) were also determined. The water quality based on physical-chemical parameters 

was achieved according to INAG (2009) for the parameters: dissolved oxygen (O2), 

oxygen saturation rate, ammonium (NH4), nitrates (NO3) and total phosphorus (P). This 

ecological status is obtained by the principle “one out all out” with only two categories for 

the chemical status: Good and Bad (the threshold for the good status is shown in Table 

3.5). 

The QBR index assesses the degree of naturalness of the channel, 

geomorphology and the riparian vegetation cover: degree, structure and quality. This 

index scores highly disturbed sites with values near 0 and natural sites with 100 (Table 

3.6).  

The IHF index evaluates the heterogeneity of the habitat through its physical 

characteristics: hydrological conditions, substrate composition, shading and aquatic 

vegetation. As the QBR index this index scores between 0 and 100, which indicates 

better quality for values near 100 (Table 3.7).

A Principal Coordinates analysis (PCO) included in the Add-on PERMANOVA of 

the PRIMER 6 package (Clarke and Gorley, 2006), was performed using a similarity 

matrix based on the results of metrics calculated by the AMIIB@ program (IPtIs, IASPT, 

IBMWP, Shannon-Wienner diversity index, Evenness index, EPT and EPTCD). 

Similarities were calculated using Bray-Curtis similarity coeficient. To better understand 

the relation betweenenvironmental conditions and the results of the metrics, vectors 

representing the correlations between environmental variables and the PCO axes were 

overlaid in the previous PCO. The parameters used were: the environmental variables 

total organic content, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, depth, total 

dissolved solids, current speed, chlorophyll a, ammonia, nitrites, nitrates, phosphorous, 

grain-size (statistics regarding this were calculated as in Chapter II); QBR and IHF 

indices; and a ratio of non-insect specimens/insect specimens. This last ratio was created 

to understand if intermittency might be related to ecological status, since higher values of 

this ratio indicate a bigger percentage of non-insect specimens, and non-insect species 

are more related to perennial sites. 

Human pressures at each location were assessed and related to the results of 

benthic metrics, to understand their efficiency identifying different levels of human 

pressure. The INSAAR (National Inventory of Water Supply Systems and Wastewaters) 

database (http://insaar.inag.pt/) was used to identify the location of Wastewater 

Treatment Plants (WWTP) and septic tanks, the treatment level, the location of the 

discharge and total population served at each studied stream; the reports of the Brigada 

de Fiscalização do Litoral, (2006) and Erena, (2005), indicated other various pressures 

occurring in the Melides and Santo André river basins as well as field knowledge. 

According to this information, the potential sources of pressure that might affect the 

ecological quality are described in Table 3.8. A rank of pressures was attributed: 0 – 



Chapter III 

48 
 

absent, 1 – low, 2 – moderate, 3 – high and 4 – very high. In the case of the stressor 

“agriculture” the rank was attributed as following: 0 – absent; 1 – family farming; 2 – 

extensive farming; 3 – semi-intensive farming; 4 – rice cultivation/intensive farming. 

Livestock was ranked based on the number of units and animal species: 0 – absent; 1 – 

cattle grazing or sheep farming; 2 – cattle farming plus grazing, or pig farming; 3 – pig 

farming plus cattle grazing; 4 – pig plus cattle farming. Urban pressure was scored as: 0 

– absent; 1 – discharge point at a distance which favours the dispersion and depuration 

of the urban sewage; 2 – effluents with secondary treatment serving less than 2000 

inhabitants; 3 – effluents with secondary treatment serving more than 2000 inhabitants; 4 

– effluents with primary treatment serving more than 2000 habitants and septic tanks 

without secondary treatment. Forestry was based only on presence or absence of 

monoculture tree plantations in the study area, with 0 for absence and 1 for presence.  

This data was correlated to the PCO axes and plotted as vectors over the PCO 

analysis in order to understand how these pressures explain the ecological quality 

determined by benthic metrics.

Results 

 The results of the IPtIs (Table 3.9) indicate that most of the sampling stations are 

considered to have a poor ecological status, with only three of the 13 sites classified as 

good or excellent. Comparing the two river basins, the Santo André River basin does not 

have any sampling site at good ecological status. This means that the three sites with a 

good ecological condition belong to the Melides River basin. The different approaches 

used to estimate the quality of the sampling sites show different classification results. 

Sites CAS 1, CAS 2, CHA 2, OLH, RML 4 and SAM were classified as in a good physical 

– chemical status. Most of the sites present a poor or bad riparian gallery, and only BAD 

was considered to have good QBR. Most sites had a good habitat structured and some 

showed a moderate habitat structure. OLH and RML 3 stations showed a very low 

consistency of classifications obtained with different indices. A poor ecological status and 

a bad quality of the riparian vegetation were identified by IPtIs and QBR, respectively, 

while IHF indicated, a good habitats structure and a good physical-chemical status. RML 

3 showed a good ecological quality, a bad riparian quality, excellent habitat structure and 

a bad physical-chemical status.

The results obtained for the IPtIs metrics are indicated in Table 3.10, showing the 

same tendency for all metrics. Cluster analysis (Figure 3.1) corroborated that relationship 

between metrics, showing a correlation higher than 0,6 between all metrics determined 

by AMIIB@, and a correlation higher than 0,9 between and EPT. In the PCO analysis 

(Figure 3.2) these axes explain 95,7% of the variability between the calculated metrics. A

tendency of all metrics to increase along the first axis is shown, towards the stations with 

a better ecological status.

The results show that finer sediments (the finer the sediment the larger the vector 

GS) are strongly associated with lower quality grades (correlation to the first axis of the 

PCO of -0,66). On the other hand, higher current speeds are associated to better quality 

status (correlation of 0,39). It is perceived that non-insect taxa occur in a 

higherpercentage in locations classified with low quality, which indicates that mostly 

perennial locations are considered by these metrics to have poor ecological status 

(correlation of -0,57 with the first axis). As indicated previously in Table 3.9, the vectors 



Chapter III 

51 
 

corresponding to the indices QBR (correlation of -0,26) and IHF (correlation of 0,31) do 

not follow the trend of the principal index used. QBR follows a trend opposite to the 

ecological quality given by the index based on macroinvertebrates and, although the IHF 

does not fully follow the trend of the latter, has a greater resemblance to these. 

 The vectors reflecting the human pressures existing at each sampling station 

(based on Table 3.8) are strongly related to stations considered to have a moderate 

ecological quality. When comparing the physical-chemical quality with the pressures 

identified in Table 3.8, a correspondence between them is not seen. As an example, RML 

4 and BAD have higher human pressures when compared CAG and CAN and are 

classified in a better ecological status.  

 

 

Discussion 

Based on the results of the methods proposed for Portuguese Southern rivers 

(IPtIs), only three sampling stations located at the Melides river basin fulfil the objective of 

good status, as required by the WFD. These results also indicated that streams of Santo 

André have lower ecological quality, requiring stringer measures to achieve that target 

until 2015. When comparing these classifications with those obtained for the same 

streams under the Management Plan of the Sado and Mira basins Hydrographic Region 

(ARH Alentejo, 2011), some differences can were observed. The streams of Melides, 

Samocal and Badoca were classified as poor and Cascalheira as moderate in the aim of 

the management plan, while this study indicates a better classification, hypothesizing an 

improvement in ecological status along the last two years. However, there is no indication 

of the precise location of the sampling sites and on the biological elements used to obtain 

that classification.  

This study shows that all the metrics included in the index used to evaluate 

ecological quality follow the same trends. The metric more correlated with IPtIs is the 

number of EPT families (cumulative number of families of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, 

Trichoptera). This metric includes sensitive taxa, which decreases with increasing amount 

of urban and livestock pressure (Bonada et al., 2006; Ippolito et al., 2009). However 

these classes also are rheophilic, with preference for fast flowing waters (Bonada, 2003), 

and are known to reside on cobble and gravel sediments (Duan et al., 2009). Therefore, 

the lower number of this metric may not be associated to increased stressors but with 

lower current speeds and finer sediments, especially as it was observed in CAG, CAN, 

CHA 1 and 2, sites considered to have low pressures but with a lentic regimes.

Grain size and current speed are directly related to the habitat regime (lentic or 

lotic) and are, therefore, the most significant natural environmental-gradients affecting the 

classification of ecological quality in these streams, with fine-grained sediments and lentic 

environments associated with lower ecological quality classes. With decreasing current 

velocity finer material, both inorganic and organic can be deposited. Compared with 

homogeneous streambeds, substrata exhibiting a wide range of particle sizes create a 

physically more complex and heterogeneous habitat (Beisel et al., 1998; Voelz and 

McArthur, 2000; Duan et al., 2009). This statement is in agreement with the classification 

of IHF relatively to substrate, once this index gives higher scores to streams with rapids 

and substrate composed by stones, pebbles and gravel (Jáimez-Cuéllar et al., 2004). 

Such environments can provide more suitable conditions for species with different 

requirements, and therefore, support a greater variety of benthic species. It is predictable 

that as sediment becomes mostly composed by sand, there is less available colonization 

area, especially for aquatic insects, once sandy beds are compact and the interstices 

between sand particles are too small for benthic macroinvertebrates to move and live 

within them, also they are unstable and subject to rapid erosion and deposition, leaving 

invertebrates insufficient time to colonize (Duan et al., 2009; Pinto and Feio, 2009). Thus 

they prefer gravel and cobble that generally support a more diverse macroinvertebrate 

community than sand (Nedeau et al., 2003). The diversity of benthic invertebrates is 

directly proportional to the availability of different micro-habitats. This follows the 

assumption of Vannote et al., (1980) which states that stable and homogeneous 

environments have lower diversity, whereas instable and heterogeneous environments 

allow a higher species richness due to a broader range of available conditions.In his way, 

once the IPtIs index favours higher diversity, locations classified as good by it have good 

scores in IHF index. 

The TOC in these streams can be strongly influenced by the input of material 

from the riparian vegetation (leaves, fruits, wood,…) and limiting the entry of light into the 

channels, thus conditioning the existence of environmental gradients transition between 

the river and the adjacent terrestrial vegetation (Pardo et al., 2002). In this case, this fact 

is translated in not only TOC vector being negatively related to ecological quality, but also 

de QBR index in contrary to what was expected. The negative relation of the QBR with 

IPtIs results are explained by the fact that higher QBR scores are mainly encountered in 

lentic environments, which leads to an increasing of organic matter and for that, 

opportunistic species scored poorly in macroinvertebrate ecological indices, such as 

Chironomidae and Oligochaeta.Thus, it appears that the quality of riparian gallery does 

not constrain the community structure of benthic macroinvertebrates, contrary to the 

findings of other authors.Castela et al. (2008), Barquín et al. (2011) 

andCheimonopoulouet al. (2011) found strong relations between the benthic indices and 

QBR, where higher values of QBR would lead to a greater biodiversity of the biological 

communities.

As highlighted in previous studies, a discrepancy between chemical and 

biological measures of water quality was found in this study (Faulkner et al., 2000; Foy et 

al., 2001; Baker et al., 2003). Wenn (2008), explains that while chemical status recovers 

rapidly, ecological status does not recover so rapidly, revealing pollution past episodes 

and / or sporadic. That was a major reason to include an integrated ecological approach 

in the WFD, since chemical indicators are not always representative of the ecological 

status of streams. The abiotic factors evaluated (whether considered or not in the 

chemical quality index) do not give an explanation about the ecological status. Higher 

water temperatures are related with higher conductivities and lower dissolved oxygen 

content (Wetzel, 1993). Since these streams are small and shallow, there is a large 

influence of solar heating in the water temperature and for that a variation throughout the 

day of these parameters so that they will not reflect on the biological communities. The 

ratio non-insect/insect taxa is negatively related to ecological quality, which might be 

explained by the fact that the taxa whose abundance more contribute to this ratio, 

Hydrobiidae and Gammaridae, are not highly scored in the IBMWP index. The low score 

of Hydrobiidae is due to its tolerance to organic pollution, although Gammaridae are 

intolerant to organic pollution, this taxa is not as sensitive as EPT (Paisley et al., 2011). 

Therefore, these low scores in IBMWP are reflected in IPtIs, and this index does not have 

these taxa in special consideration in the other terms of the formula (like EPT or EPTCD).  

Four types of stressors where characterized in these two small river basins: 

agriculture, livestock, urbanization and forestry. However, the forestry occupation does 

not have a pattern that might cause impacts in aquatic ecosystems. The IPtIs index did 

not reflect the pressures gradient identified in the sampling sites. In this case study, 

higher pressures are associated with moderate quality, especially in BAD and RML 4 

sampling sites, although these two sites are considered to have higher human pressures. 

The Badoca sampling site has an important human pressureresulting from urban 

effluents, with a great number of habitants served by the WWTP’s, and from cattle 

grazing. RML 4 has considerable pressures from urban effluents, livestock and rice 

cultivation. This activity occurs in the fields nearby this location and has a seasonal 

impact in this location, since the rice fields drain to the streams in September to dry the 

fields and proceed with the harvest procedures (Freitas et al., 2008). Besides being a 

seasonal pressure, the rice fields drainage occurs downstream to RML 4, so this stressor 

does not have an impact on water quality in the study sites and, consequently on the 

benthic macroinvertebrate community. All the other stressors lead to nutrients increase, 

caused by the effluents discharged directly into the water by the WWTP’s, nutrients 

leaching from nitrogen excreted by animals and nitrogenous fertilizers used in agriculture. 

These pressures might cause eutrophication, especially with NO3 and NO2, but 

concentrations that where measured in the Melides and Santo André streams do not 

exceed the limits established for a good physical-chemical status.

However, undisturbed or slightly disturbed locations are classified as having a 

poor ecological quality. These locations are predominantly lentic and with sediments 

dominated by sand, with the exception of OLH that is dominated by sand but with a lotic 

regime. This station is a particular case, since it has a groundwater interface and the 

habitat was altered in order to create a recreational area that affected the sediment 

characteristics (sediment was transported from the Melides lagoon) and lead to a loss of 

natural characteristics. The benthic macroinvertebrate community of this location was 

dominated by an invasive species, Potamopyrgus antipodarum. This is a species with 

high tolerance to organic pollution and nutrient enrichment (Alonso and Camargo, 2003) 

and it is known to change the structure of communities originally present (Múrria et al., 

2008). 

The differences between lentic and lotic habitats are also emphasized by the 

results obtained at sites RML 2 and 3, which have the same stressors, but the last one 

have a better ecological classification, because the current speed is greater and for that 

the substrate and fluvial habitat (IHF) is more heterogeneous. This considerable increase 

of current between one station and another is due to the existence of a weir between 

them. 

Since the IPtIs index was proposed recently, its efficiency is still very poorly 

known. Yet, studies in other streams in southern Portugal (e.g., Coimbra et al. 1996) also 

indicate that the use of indices such as BMWP or IASPT in lentic conditions is not 

appropriate. With the arrival of the dry season, the river continuum is interrupted giving 

rise to the occurrence of ponds. An increase in temperature and plant detritus occurs in 

those conditions, leading to an increase in salinity due to evaporation and higher nutrients 

concentration. These harsh conditions are similar to those found in polluted sites, causing 

a predominance of tolerant taxa (Coimbra et al., 1996). Pinto et al. (2004), suggest the 

replacementof the metric EPT by EPTO (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Tricoptera and 

Odonata) in Mediterranean streams. The addition of Odonata to the metric compensates 

the absence of Plecoptera in lentic habitats. These are also sensitive to pollution taxa but, 

unlike Plecotera are more abundant and diverse in lentic waters (Bouchard, 2004). 

Generally, this index does not efficiently classifies stations with different 

environmental characteristics, i.e. which have groundwater sources or are lentic. Since 

these lentic environments have sandy bedstream substrates this fact is in agreement with 

Pinto and Feio (2009), which found low efficiency of this index in sandy bedstreams. This 

is also in agreement with the low responsiveness found in other metrics to evaluate lentic 

habitats, as seen above. Withdrawing of the analysis stations with these features, it 

appears that the index IPtIs responds relatively well to the existing pressures, when plied 

in lotc habitats.

Conclusions 

This study indicated that few sampling sites were classified in a good ecological 

status by the IPtIs index, with only three locations presenting good or excellent quality and 

half considered poor. However, the results of the different assessment tools did not 

coincide, hence an ecological assessment integrating these indices should be used, in 

order to better interpret the results obtained with the benthic macroinvertebrate indices, 

since these can be influenced by habitat characteristics. Current speed, sediment grain-

size and TOC seem to influence significantly the classification results since these 

environmental factors constrain the benthic community structure and the taxonomic 

composition at each site. More heterogeneous habitats support a greater diversity of 

organisms. On the other hand, locations with lentic environments have a more 

homogeneous habitat type and are, in general, poorly scored by the IPtIs. Species that 

colonize lentic environments tolerate greater concentrations of TOC and also tolerate 

organic pollution, therefore these species are equally found in lentic or polluted sites. 

Ultimately, we concluded that this index does not respond accurately to stressors when 

the habitat characteristics are different from those that were used to develop the index. 

Under the current definition this index should only be used for lotic habitats, since lentic 

habitats have natural pressures similar to human pressures, confounding the 

interpretation of the results.

Final Remarks 

 

 

The WFD implementation process currently in place at the European Union led to 

a strong increase in the development of monitoring programs, to support the 

assessment of water bodies’ ecological status. Some of the European countries had 

previously developed such programs. However, in Portugal, as in other countries, there 

were no monitoring programs including biological elements. The scarcity of biological 

data on some biological elements and the absence of sampling protocols also 

contributed to delay the implementation of this Directive and the fulfilment of the 

established dead lines. Monitoring programs are currently ongoing, but specific 

characteristics of the Portuguese stream systems constrain the use of the tools 

developed, as it was emphasized by the results of this study. 

 The data compiled in this thesis improves the understanding of benthic 

invertebrate communities in the streams of the Santo André and Melides river basins and 

allows to reach a set of conclusions that were discussed in chapters II and III. The key 

findings are summarized below. 

 

 The studied streams are characterized by communities with a dominance 

of insects over other taxonomical groups. The most common and widespread taxa was 

the Chironomidae family of the Diptera order that are known to be euribiont and tolerant 

to a large variety of conditions. Higher densities were found in Santo André River basin, 

while higher taxonomic diversity was found in Melides. Taxa richness was highly 

associated with hydraulic-related parameters controlled by climatic conditions (current 

speed), while invertebrate abundance was related with food availability (total organic 

content), once an important number or the streams of Santo André watershed were 

considered to be lentic. This is coherent with the ecological status attributed to these 

streams, where the streams in the Melides River basin were the best classified. More 

heterogeneous habitats host a greater diversity of organisms. Thereby, the locations with 

lentic environments, with more homogeneous characteristics were, in general, poorly 

scored by the IPtIs. Species that colonize lentic environments tolerate greater 

concentrations of TOC and also tolerate organic pollution, therefore these species are 

equally found in lentic or polluted sites. Only three of the sampling sites were classified in 

a good ecological status by the IPtIs index, therefore considered to achieve the goal of the 

WFD. Nevertheless, this index does not respond accurately to natural stressors, such as 

habitat characteristics different from those for which the index was developed. Under the 

current definition this index should only be used for lotic habitats, since lentic habitats 

have natural pressures similar to human pressures, confounding the interpretation of the 

results.

Future directions 

 

Biotic interactions, such as competition and predation are likely to have an 

important contribute regulating benthic invertebrate abundance and distribution. Thereby 

it would be important that further studies would take these interactions into account, not 

only within benthic invertebrate communities but also with other communities like fish, for 

instance, that may have considerable effects in benthic communities driven by predation. 

These effects can lead to a misinterpretation of the real ecological status existent. A 

multi-season approach also would be ideal to understand the ecology of these 

Mediterranean streams, how they change throughout the year and how they respond to 

extreme events, once structure of communities change seasonally. 

Finally, rehabilitation measures to improve the ecological status of the lotic 

streams considered not to be with good ecological quality should be taken in order to 

understand how efficient are the assessment tools and, ultimately, to fulfil the goals of the 

WFD by 2015.
