resumo A engenharia de tecidos é um domínio tecnológico emergente em
rápido desenvolvimento que se destina a produzir substitutos viáveis
para a restauração, manutenção ou melhoria da função dos tecidos ou
órgãos humanos. Uma das estratégias mais predominantes em
engenharia de tecidos envolve crescimento celular sobre matrizes de
suporte (scaffolds), biocompatíveis e biodegradáveis. Estas matrizes
devem possuir não só elevadas propriedades mecânicas e vasculares,
mas também uma elevada porosidade. Devido à incompatibilidade
destes dois parâmetros, é necessário desenvolver estratégias de
simulação de forma a obter estruturas optimizadas. A previsão real das
propriedades mecânicas, vasculares e topológicas das matrizes de
suporte, produzidas por técnicas de biofabricação, é muito importante
para as diversas aplicações em engenharia de tecidos. 
A presente dissertação apresenta o estado da arte da engenharia de
tecidos, bem como as técnicas de biofabricação envolvidas na
produção de matrizes de suporte. Para o design optimizado de matrizes
de suporte foi adoptada uma metodologia de design baseada tanto em
métodos de elementos finitos para o cálculo do comportamento
mecânico, vascular e as optimizações topológicas, como em métodos
analíticos para a validação das simulações estruturais utilizando dados
experimentais. Considerando que as matrizes de suporte são estruturas
elementares do tipo LEGO, dois tipos de famílias foram consideradas,
superfícies não periódicas e as superfícies triplas periódicas que
descrevem superfícies naturais. Os objectivos principais desta
dissertação são: i) avaliar as técnicas existentes de engenharia de
tecidos; ii) avaliar as técnicas existentes de biofabricação para a
produção de matrizes de suporte; iii) avaliar o desempenho e
comportamento das matrizes de suporte; iv) implementar uma
metodologia de design de matrizes de suporte em variáveis tais como a
porosidade, geometria e comportamento mecânico e vascular por forma
a auxiliar o processo de design; e por fim, v) validar experimentalmente
a metodologia adoptada.

abstract The design of optimized scaffolds for tissue engineering is a key topic of
research, as the complex macro- and micro- architectures required for a
scaffold depends not only on the mechanical properties, but also on the
physical and molecular queues of the surrounding tissue within the
defect site. Thus, the prediction of optimal features for tissue
engineering scaffolds is very important for its mechanical, vascular or
topological properties. 
The relationship between high scaffold porosity and high mechanical
properties is contradictory, as it becomes even more complex due to the
scaffold degradation process. A scaffold design strategy was developed,
based on the finite element method, to optimise the scaffold design
regarding the mechanical and vascular properties as a function of
porosity. Scaffolds can be considered as a LEGO structure formed by
an association of small elementary units or blocks. In this research
work, two types of family elementary scaffold units were considered:
non-triple periodic minimal surfaces and triple periodic minimal surfaces
that describe natural existing surfaces. The main objectives of this
research work are: i) The evaluation of the Tissue Engineering
methodology and its different strategies; ii) The evaluation of the
existing biofabrication technologies used to produce tissue engineering
scaffolds; iii) The evaluation of the scaffold’s requirements involved in
the scaffold’s design; iv) The development of an integrated design
strategy based on material, porosity, geometry, mechanical and
vascular properties, in order to aid the scaffold design process; and v)
The experimental validation of the adopted design strategy.

Chapter 1 – Introduction 

1. Introduction 

1.1. Tissue Engineering 

 

Since the early years of mankind’s existence, the regeneration of tissues and 

organs has been an issue of dreams, as well as relevant domain for ancient Greek 

Mythology (Dougherty, 2006). According to the Mythology, Prometheus, a Greek 

Titan, disobeyed a direct order from the God Zeus, and for that reason 

Prometheus was chained to a rock in the Caucasus Mountains where his torture 

should take place. Every day, a great eagle would come to Prometheus and eat 

his liver, leaving only at nightfall when the liver would begin to grow back once 

more (Figure 1.1). At daybreak, the eagle would return to the chained Prometheus 

and again attack his body, eating his liver. The daily ritual would repeat itself into 

eternity, or until Zeus decided to relieve Prometheus from his punishment. This 

myth clearly identifies that even in ancient Greece, man wanted to restore tissues 

and organs, which was also reflected on the understanding they had on the ability 

of specific tissues to regenerate.

Today, its incidence in modern medicine is growing with the ageing of the 

population and higher expectations for a better quality of life, together with the 

increasing number of required implants and organ shortage. The loss or failure of 

an organ or tissue is a frequent, devastating, and costly problem in health care. 

Currently, this problem is treated either by transplanting organs from one individual 

to another or performing surgical reconstructions, transferring tissue from one 

location in the human body into the diseased site. The need for substitutes to 

replace or repair tissues or organs due to disease, trauma, or congenital problems 

is overwhelming. Tissue engineering (Figure 1.2) emerged to overcome these 

limitations by creating cell-based substitutes of native tissues (Risbud, 2001; 

Langer and Vacanti, 1993).

technologies (http://ims.postech.ac.kr).

Tissue engineering is a multidisciplinary field focusing on the use of cells and 

engineered materials (Figure 1.3), combining the principles of biology, engineering 

and medicine to create biological substitutes for lost or defective native tissues 

(Eshraghi and Das, 2010; Bártolo et al, 2009a; 2009b; 2008; Gibson, 2005; Tan et 

al, 2005; Vozzi et al, 2003; Risbud, 2001). According to Skalak and Fox (1988), 

tissue engineering can be described as “the application of the principles and 

methods of engineering and life sciences toward the fundamental understanding of 

structure-function relationships in normal and pathological mammalian tissues and 

the development of biological substitutes to restore, maintain, or improve tissue 

and organ functions” (Bártolo et al, 2008). This new research domain emerged as 

a rapidly expanding approach to address the organ shortage problem and 

comprises tissue regeneration, organ substitution and gene therapy (Table 1.1). 

Diseases, such as Parkinson, Alzheimer, osteoporosis, spine injuries or cancer, 

might in the near future be treated with methods aiming at regenerating diseased 

or damaged tissues. An historical overview of this field can be found in a report 

published by the National Science Foundation (2003) of the United States of 

America (USA). Recently, de Bartolo et al (2012) presented a vision of the future 

of this medical domain in 2030.

authors, such as: Bhumiratana and Vunjak-Novakovic (2012), Norrotte et al 

(2009), Bártolo et al (2008), Matsumoto and Mooney (2006), Mistry and Mikos, 

(2005), Fuchs et al (2001), Langer (1997) and Langer and Vacanti (1993) for the 

creation of new tissues:

1. Cell-based strategies, involves the direct in vivo implantation of isolated 

cells or cell substitutes and it is based on cells synthesizing their own 

extracellular matrix (ECM). This approach avoids surgery complications 

allowing replacing only the damaged cells required for a specific function. 

The main limitations include immunological rejection and failure of the 

encapsulated cells. 

 

2. Growth-factor-based strategies, based on the use of growth factors and 

controlled-released systems. Growth factors are proteins secreted by 

several cell types functioning as signalling molecules, promoting cell 

adhesion, proliferation, migration and differentiation (Tessmar and 

Gopferich, 2007; Boontheekul and Mooney, 2003; Rose and Oreffo, 2002). 

The success of this strategy depends on the growth factors and controlled 

released systems. Relevant growth factors for bone regeneration and 

wound healing applications are indicated in Table 1.2.

Gopferich (2007), Boontheekul and Mooney (2003) and Rose and Oreffo (2002).

3. Scaffold-based methods, based on the use of a temporary scaffold, 

provide a substrate for the implanted cells and a physical support for tissue 

formation in an organized way. In this approach, transplanted cells adhere

to the scaffold, proliferate, secrete their own ECM and stimulate new tissue 

formation. This strategy involves either a closed or an open system. In a 

closed system, cells are isolated from the body by a permeable membrane 

that allows exchange of nutrients and wastes, and protects cells from the 

immune response of the body. An open system begins with the in vitro 

culture of cells, which are then seeded onto a scaffold. The cell-matrix 

construct is then implanted into the body. 

 

The cell-seeded temporary scaffold approach is the most widely used strategy for 

tissue engineering (Fuchs et al, 2001). In this approach, living cells are obtained 

from a tissue harvest, from either the patient (auto-graft) or a different person 

(allograft), and cultured in vitro on a three-dimensional biodegradable scaffold to 

obtain a tissue construct suitable for transplantation (Liu and Czernuszka, 2006). 

Scaffolds provide an initial biochemical substrate so that the novel tissue can grow 

until cells produce their own ECM. Therefore, scaffolds not only define the 3D 

space for the formation of new tissues, but also serve as temporary skeletons to 

accommodate and stimulate new tissue growth with appropriate functions (Bártolo 

et al, 2012). This cell-seeded temporary scaffold approach is illustrated in Figure 

1.5.

and patient implantation, adapted from Bártolo et al (2012) and Liu and Czernuszka (2006).

1.1.1. Cells 

 

Therapeutic strategies in tissue engineering involve: 

 

? cellular implantation where cells, derived from an endogenous source 

in the patient or a donor, are either injected into the damaged tissue or 

combined in vitro with a degradable scaffold, and then implanted; 

? tissue regeneration where a scaffold is implanted directly into the 

damaged tissue, stimulates the cells to promote local tissue repair. 

 

Cells used in tissue engineering may be allogeneic, xenogeneic, syngeneic or 

autologous (Fuchs et al, 2001). They should be non-immunogenic, highly 

proliferate, easy to harvest, with a high capacity to differentiate into a variety of cell 

types of specialised functions (Fuchs et al, 2001; Marler et al, 1998). Skeletal 

muscle satellite cells, cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, osteoblasts 

and chondrocytes were used in many tissue engineering applications. An ideal cell 

source for tissue engineering should have the capacity to proliferate and then 

differentiate in vitro, in a manner that can be reproducibly controlled. 

 

The growth and differentiation of many cell types is regulated by four major 

sources of external signalling (Santos et al, 2012), as shown in Figure 1.6: 

 

1. Soluble growth and differentiation factors; 

2. Nature and organization of insoluble and soluble ECM constituents; 

3. Intercellular interactions; 

4. Environmental stress induced by fluid flow and/or mechanical stimuli, as 

well other physical cues (oxygen, tension, pH effects).

1.1.2. Scaffolds 

 

According to Feder-Mengus et al (2008), scaffolds are a porous 3D cell culture 

substrates, which provides a temporary template for cell organization into tissue 

structures, both in vitro and in vivo, as they serve some of the following purposes 

(Billiet et al, 2012; Truscello et al, 2012; Guillotin and Guillemot, 2011; Bártolo et 

al, 2009a; 2009b; 2008; Tan and Teoh, 2007; Liu and Czernuszka, 2006; Kreke et 

al, 2005; Gomes and Reis, 2004; Gross and Rodriguez-Lorenzo, 2004; Leong et 

al, 2003; Kreeger and Shea, 2002; Hutmacher, 2001; Kim and Mooney, 2001; 

Langer and Vacanti, 1993): 

 

? Serve as an adhesion substrate for cells, allowing cell attachment, 

proliferation and differentiation; 

? Deliver and retain cells and growth factors; 

? Enable diffusion of cell nutrients and oxygen; 

? Provide temporary mechanical and biological environment to the newly 

grown tissue enabling tissue regeneration in an organised way.

An ideal scaffold must satisfy some biological and physical requirements as 

indicated in Table 1.3 (Bártolo et al, 2012; Billiet et al, 2012; Reverchon and 

Cardea, 2012; Vasanthan et al, 2012; Bártolo et al, 2009a; 2009b; 2008; Sanz-

Herrera et al, 2009; Leong et al, 2008). Such properties affect not only cell 

survival, signalling, growth, propagation and reorganization, influencing also cell 

shape modelling and gene expressions (Chen et al, 1997; Mooney et al, 1992). 

 

Table 1.3 – Relationship between scaffold characteristics and the corresponding biological effect

a) Biological requirements 

 

? Biocompatibility is related to the acceptance of an implant by both the 

surrounding tissues and the whole body. The implant should be 

compatible with these tissues in terms of mechanical, chemical, surface 

and pharmacological properties (Ramakrishna et al, 2001; Angelova and 

Hunkeler, 1999). Biocompatibility is also related to the ability of the 

implant material to perform an appropriate host response in a specific 

application (Ramakrishna et al, 2001; Angelova and Hunkeler, 1999). 

In tissue engineering, materials should interact positively with the cells, 

allowing cell attachment, proliferation, differentiation and host 

environment, without eliciting adverse host tissue responses (Kim et al, 

2003b). 

 

? Controlled Degradation Rate – the degradation rate of the scaffold must 

be adjustable in order to match the rate of tissue regeneration. 



Smart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications 

 

 

10 
 

 

? Biodegradability – Scaffolds must degrade into non-toxic products with a 

controlled degradation rate matching the regeneration rate of the native 

tissue. The in vivo degradation process of polymeric scaffolds is 

influenced by different and often conflicting variables, such as those 

related to the material’s structure (i.e., chemical composition, molecular 

weight and molecular weight distribution, crystallinity, morphology, etc.), 

its macroscopic features (i.e., implant shape or size, porous shape, size 

and interconnectivity, etc.) and the environmental conditions (i.e., 

temperature, pH of the medium, presence of enzymes or cells and 

tissues). The chemical degradation of polymers can mainly proceed 

either via degradation by biological agents (enzymes), or hydrolytic 

degradation (hydrolysis) mediated by water, or a combination of both 

effects (Figure 1.7) (Ferreira, 2011). Other degradation processes are 

attributed to other agents, such as super oxides, phagocytic attack or 

even mechanical stress.

Figure 1.7 – SEM images of PCL scaffolds a) before and b) after 25 days of the degradation 

process (Ferreira, 2011). 

 

? Bioactive – Scaffolds should be bioactive, promoting and guiding cell 

proliferation, differentiation and tissue growth. This bioactivity can be 

achieved by adding growth factors and functionalizing the scaffold with 

proteins or adhesion-specific peptide sequences, which often resembles 

the ECM providing appropriate biomolecular signals to the cells (Wei et 

al, 2007; Nathan and Sporn, 1991). 

 

? Appropriate porosity, pore size and pore shape – Generally, a high level 

of porosity is required (&gt; 90%) because it increases the surface area, 

enabling high cell seeding efficiency, migration and proliferation and 

neovascularisation (Sun et al, 2007; Chong and Chang, 2006; 

Beckstead et al, 2005; Karageorgiou and Kaplan, 2005; Miot et al, 2005; 

Woodfield et al, 2005; Martin et al, 2004; Sun et al, 2004a; 2004b; 

Taguchi et al, 2004; Salem et al, 2002; Sherwood et al, 2002; Freyman 

et al, 2001; Zeltinger et al, 2001; Kuboki et al, 1998; Nehrer et al, 1997; 

LeGeros and LeGeros, 1995; Whang et al, 1995). Pore size plays also 

an important role in terms of cell adhesion/migration, vascularisation and 

new tissue ingrowth (Bártolo et al, 2009a; 2009b; Jones et al, 2009; Lee 

et al, 2008; Leong et al, 2008; Bártolo et al; 2008; Rouwkema et al, 

2008; O’Brien et al, 2005; Hollister et al, 2002). Macro-pores (i.e. &gt;50 

µm) are of an appropriate scale to influence tissue function, while micro-

pores (i.e.&amp;lt;50 µm) influence cell function (e.g. cell attachment), as 

mammalian cells typically have 10-20 µm in size. Smaller pores 

enhance cell adhesion and differentiation in vitro, while bigger pores 

promote higher cell adhesion, viability and vascularisation in vivo. If the 

pores are too large, cells will fail to migrate and form networks 

throughout the scaffold. When the pores are too small, its occlusion by 

cells will prevent cellular penetration and matrix elaboration within the 

scaffolds (Rout et al, 1988). Pore interconnectivity (a 100% 

interconnected network of internal channels is required) is also a critical

parameter in terms of cell viability and tissue regeneration. The degree 

of pore interconnectivity directly affects the diffusion of physiological 

nutrients and gases, as well the removal of metabolic waste and by-

products from cells that penetrated into the scaffold (Mikos et al, 1993; 

Vacanti et al, 1988). Table 1.4 presents the ideal scaffold pore sizes for 

different cell types.

b) Mechanical and physical requirements 

 

? Mechanical Strength – Scaffolds are required to withstand both in vitro 

manipulation and stresses in the host tissue environment (Bignon et al, 

2003; Leong et al, 2003; Prendergast and Meulen, 2001; Temenoff and 

Mikos, 2000; Brekke, 1996). In vitro, engineered culture tissue 

constructs should maintain their mechanical properties to preserve the 

required space for cell growth and matrix formation. For in vivo 

applications, it is important that scaffolds mimic as closely as possible 

the mechanical properties of the native tissue in order to provide a 

temporary mechanical support for tissue regeneration, providing 

structural stability to the injured site. Initially, the scaffold must withstand 

all stresses and loads in the host tissue environment, before gradually 

transferring them to the regenerated tissue (Figure 1.8).

Figure 1.8 – Schematic representation of the mechanical contribution of a scaffold as it degrades 

over time, and the mechanical contribution of the new host tissue as it forms in the presence of 

appropriate mechanical loading (adapted from Badylak et al (2009)). 

 

? Adequate surface finish – Cell attachment, the initial step in cell-

biomaterial surface interaction, is closely related to the surface 

properties of biomaterials (Saltzman, 1997), such as morphology, 

hydrophilicity, surface energy and charge (Yang et al, 2002). The 

surface should be conductive to cell growth, promoting cellular 

adhesion, migration and differentiation, so that the resultant tissue is 

comparable to the surrounding native tissue with respect to structure 

and functionality (Morsi et al, 2008). An adequate surface enables a 

good biomechanical coupling between the scaffold and the new and 

host tissue (Mustafa et al, 2005; Cheng and Teoh, 2004; Zhao et al, 

2003; Singhvi et al, 1994). The morphology and the physiochemistry of 

the scaffold’s surface, a material dependent property, are important 

factors that influence cell attachment, migration and intracellular 

signalling in vitro and cell recruitment, as well healing and bonding with 

the cellular host tissue in the tissue-scaffold interface in vivo (McClary et 

al, 2000; Healy et al, 1992). 

Since most biodegradable materials have a hydrophobic polymer 

surface, chemical activation of the polymer substrate becomes critical in

the polymer-bioactive molecule (such as proteins or cells) interaction 

(Safinia et al, 2005). New efforts have been reported to encourage cell 

attachment focusing on mimicking the surface chemistry of autogenous 

ECM (Hynes, 1992). Several methods were developed to modify 

polymer surfaces for improving their wetting characteristics, including 

mechanical, wet chemical and atmospheric treatments, as well low-

pressure plasma and corona discharge (Chen-Yang et al, 2000; Gupta 

et al, 2000; Mutel et al, 2000). Plasma treatment techniques enable the 

introduction of desired functionalities and grafting of polymer chains onto 

the surface, thereby improving the adhesive properties, printability, and 

permeability of polymer surfaces (Yildirim et al, 2008; Berry et al, 2004; 

Grace and Gerenser, 2003; Greene et al, 2003; Tahara et al, 2003; 

Webb et al, 1998; Shelton et al, 1988). Such surface treatments remove 

surface contaminants, roughen the polymer surface, and increase 

surface reactivity by altering the surface energy and charge of the 

material (Safinia et al, 2005). The modified surfaces that undergo 

surface restructuring with time, a disadvantage of polymer surface 

treatments (Yang et al, 2002), due to the mobility of the polymer chain in 

the amorphous regions (Kim et al, 2003a; Murakami et al, 1998), driven 

by the thermodynamic need to lower the overall interfacial energy of the 

system (Koberstein et al, 1998). 

 

? Easily manufactured and sterilised – Implants should be rapidly 

produced with high accuracy and repeatability and easily sterilized by 

exposure to high temperatures, UV light, ?-radiation, plasma, ethylene 

oxide (ETO) gas, or by immersion in a sterilisation agent, remaining 

unaffected by either of these processes (Allan et al, 2001; Fischbach et 

al, 2001). The sterilisation process must not alter the material’s chemical 

composition, which can affect its bioactivity, biocompatibility or 

degradation properties.

1.2. Research Aims 

 

The design of optimised scaffolds for tissue engineering is a key topic of research, 

as the complex macro- and micro- architectures required for a scaffold depends on 

the mechanical properties, physical and molecular queues of the surrounding 

tissue within the defect site. Thus, the prediction of the optimal properties for 

tissue engineering scaffolds is very important, for mechanical, vascular or 

topological properties. 

 

The relationship between high scaffold porosity and high mechanical properties is 

contradictory as it becomes even more complex due to the degradation process of 

the scaffolds. A scaffold design strategy based on the finite element method was 

developed in order to optimise the scaffold design, regarding mechanical and 

vascular properties as a function of porosity. Scaffolds are considered as a LEGO 

structure formed by an association of small elementary units or blocks. In this 

research work, two types of family elementary scaffold units were considered: non-

triple periodic minimal surfaces and triple periodic minimal surfaces that describe 

natural existing surfaces. The main objectives of this research work are: 

 

? The evaluation of the Tissue Engineering methodology and its different 

strategies; 

? The evaluation of the existing biofabrication technologies used to produce 

tissue engineering scaffolds; 

? The evaluation of the scaffold’s requirements involved in the scaffold’s 

design; 

? The development of an integrated design strategy based on material, 

porosity, geometry, mechanical and vascular properties, in order to aid the 

scaffold design process; 

? The experimental validation of the adopted design strategy.

1.3. Thesis Structure 

 

This thesis is structured into 7 chapters as illustrated in Figure 1.9. 

 

 

Figure 1.9 – Flowchart of the topics and objectives that are addressed in the thesis. 

 

The first chapter presents a detailed overview of the tissue engineering field, as 

well the tissue engineering scaffolds. An in depth description of scaffolds, 

regarding its purpose, functionality, biological and physical requirements and 

characteristics, is also presented.

The second chapter comprises a detailed description of advanced scaffold 

fabrication technologies, namely biomanufacturing. Both conventional and additive 

manufacturing technologies are described, highlighting additive manufacturing. 

The processing procedures from CAD data to physical models are also explained. 

Biomanufacturing technologies are grouped into four categories: 

Stereolithographic Processes, Laser Sintering, Extrusion-based and Three-

dimensional printing. Each category is also defined presenting the most relevant 

research activities and their results. 

 

The third chapter describes the state-of-the-art in computational design and 

modelling methodologies of scaffolds for tissue engineering applications, as 

scaffolds can be designed and modelled based on µCT data or surface/solid CAD 

modelling. Several scaffold unit families are presented, namely Non-Triple Periodic 

Minimal Surface and Triple Periodic Minimal Surface geometric models, as well 

the mathematical formulations for the design of Triple Periodic Minimal Surfaces. 

 

The next three chapters correspond to the numerical simulation, evaluation and 

prediction of the scaffold’s behaviour under structural and vascular loading, and its 

topological optimisation. Each chapter presents a detailed state-of-the-art 

description of the influence of the scaffold’s behaviour on the cells with the 

corresponding finite element formulations involved in the simulations. The 

numerical analysis set-up for each simulation is described and the results are then 

presented and discussed for each of the scaffold unit families. Each scaffold’s 

numerical behaviour is evaluated as a function of a design parameter, such as 

pore size, thickness, radius, etc. Each chapter corresponds to a scaffold 

simulation topic: Chapter Four to its structural simulation, Chapter Five to its 

vascular simulation, and Chapter Six to its topological optimisation. 

 

The aim of this chapter is to provide an overall summary of the thesis. It starts with 

a summary and conclusions that can be drawn from the research work carried out. 

Possible future directions for research following on this thesis are also presented.

Chapter 2 – Biofabrication 

2. Biofabrication 

2.1. Introduction 

 

Fabrication techniques to produce 3D scaffolds can be divided into two broad 

categories: conventional techniques and additive technologies (Bártolo et al, 2012; 

Gualandi, 2011; Bártolo et al, 2009a; 2009b; 2008; Hutmacher et al, 2008). 

 

2.2. Conventional Fabrication Techniques 

 

According to Reignier and Huneault (2006), Ho et al (2004), Gomes and Reis 

(2004), Ma (2004), Leong et al (2003) and Yang et al (2001), there are several 

conventional methods to fabricate scaffolds, as follows: 

 

? Solvent casting/salt leaching involves mixing solid impurities, such as 

sieved sodium chloride particles, into a polymer solvent solution, as well 

casting its dispersion to produce a membrane containing polymer and salt 

particles. The salt particles are then leached out with water to yield a 

porous membrane. According to the abovementioned authors, porosity and 

pore size are dependent on salt weight fraction and particle size, pore 

diameters of 100-500 ?m and porosities of 87-91 % were obtained. 

? Phase separation involves dissolving a polymer in a suitable solvent, 

placing it in a mould, and then cooling the mould rapidly until the solvent is 

frozen. The solvent is removed by freeze-drying, leaving behind the 

polymer, a foam with pore sizes of 1-20 ?m in diameter. 

? Foaming is carried out by either dissolving a gas, usually Carbon Dioxide 

(CO2), at elevated pressure or incorporating a chemical blowing agent that 

yields gaseous decomposition products. This process generally leads to 

porous structures not fully interconnected, and produces a skin-core 

structure.

? Gas saturation uses high pressure CO2 to produce macroporous sponges 

at room temperature. Polymeric sponges with large pores (?100 ?m) and 

porosities up to 93% were produced. 

? Electrospinning is a process for generating fine fibres by applying an 

electric field to either droplets of a polymer solution or melt, passing through 

a tip of a fine orifice (Mitchell et al, 2011; Mitchell and Davis; 2011; Greiner 

and Wendorff, 2007), as shown in Figure 2.1. As a consequence of the 

Coulombic electric forces arising from the application of the high voltage, 

this small droplet will be charged and its shape distorted into a cone-like 

geometry (Taylor, 1964). Dependent on the strength of the applied electric 

field together with the solution or melt viscosity, surface tension and 

dielectric properties of the solution, the integrity of the droplet will break 

down and a fine fibre of polymer will be produced and deposited on the 

collector electrode. During the flight, the fibre will be subjected to 

instabilities which extend the fibre and lead to a considerable reduction in 

its diameter (Sin et al, 2001; Reneker et al, 2000). An important feature of 

this technique is the production of fibres with diameters ranging from 10 nm 

(or even smaller) to a few microns, dimensions not generally available using 

other techniques, except at the higher end by melt blowing (Ellison et al. 

2007). 

Dias (2010) used an electrospinning system, developed at the Centre for 

Rapid and Sustainable Product (Figure 2.2), to obtain tissue meshes 

composed of nanoscale fibres for cartilage applications. Polycaprolactone 

fibres were produced under the following processing conditions: applied 

voltage of 12 kV; feed rate between 0.72 and 3.17 ml/h; needle diameter of 

0.6 mm, and distance between tip and collector of 10 cm. Three different 

solvents were also used during this experimental work (acetic acid, 

triethylamine and a mixture of both). Results show that a more homogenous 

mesh is obtained by adding triethylamine to the solvent solution. It can also 

be observed that a non uniform dependence of the mesh quality is obtained 

with an increase in the flow rate. Figure 2.3 illustrates SEM results of PCL 

fibre meshes with different flow rates and solvent concentrations.

These techniques present several limitations as they usually do not enable to 

properly control pore size, pore geometry and spatial distribution of pores, on top 

of almost not allowing to construct internal channels within the scaffold (Yeong et 

al, 2004). Although the shape and size of the pores can vary by changing process 

parameters, the resulting scaffold organisation of pores is random. This can lead 

to pore pathways that are only partially connected following contorted routes, 

which could inhibit the supply of nutrients and the ingrowth of tissue within the 

scaffold. These techniques are labour-intensive processes with long fabrication 

times, usually involving the use of toxic organic solvents, which are severe 

limitations. Using these conventional techniques, it is not possible to produce 

scaffolds enabling the formation of thick 3D tissues, as the cells proliferate only at 

the surface of the produced matrices (Figure 2.4). Conventional techniques are 

limited in terms of reproducibility and repeatability, due to the lack of pore 

interconnectivity that promotes the so-called M&amp;amp;M effect (cells die due to the lack 

of nutrients’ supply and vascularisation). Therefore, additive biofabrication 

processes are considered as viable alternatives to fabricate scaffolds for tissue 

engineering as they offer better control and the ability to actively design the 

porosity and interconnectivity of scaffolds.

2.3. Additive Biomanufacturing 

 

In 2005, Biomanufacturing was defined as “the use of additive technologies, 

biodegradable and biocompatible materials, cells, growth factors, etc., to produce 

biological structures for tissue engineering applications”, during a 

Biomanufacturing Workshop hosted by Tsinghua University at China. More 

recently, during the Spring 2008 Meeting sponsored by the National Science 

Foundation (USA), biomanufacturing was defined as “the design, fabrication, 

assembly and measurement of bio-elements into structures, devices, and 

systems, and their interfacing and integration into / with larger scale structures in 

vivo or in vitro environment such that heterogeneity, scalability and sustainability 

are possible”. 

 

A general overview of the necessary steps to produce scaffolds for tissue 

engineering through biomanufacturing technologies is illustrated in Figure 2.5 

(Bártolo et al, 2012; Bártolo, 2006; Bártolo et al, 2003). The first step is the 

generation of the corresponding computer solid model through one of the currently 

available medical imaging techniques, such as computer tomography, magnetic 

resonance imaging, etc. These imaging methods produce continuous volumetric 

data (voxel-based data), providing the input data for the digital model generation 

(Bártolo, 2006). The model is then tessellated as an STL file (Figure 2.6). The STL 

model is then mathematically sliced into thin layers (sliced model). The data is 

then sent to a biomanufacturing device to produce the biocompatible and 

biodegradable constructs containing or not cells and growth factors.

The STL file format is the standard format for the data input of all types of additive 

manufacturing systems. In this format, 3D models are represented by a number of 

three sided planar facets (triangles), each facet defining part of the external 

surface of the object. 

 

There are two types of STL file formats, the ASCII (American Standard Code for 

Information Interchange) and Binary file formats. The information contained in 

each type of STL file is functionally identical. For each facet, the three vertices and 

the unit normal vector are specified. The format of the data expression is the only 

difference of these two types of file. The structure of an ASCII STL file (Figure 2.7) 

starts with the word solid followed by the name of the file, and ends with the word 

endsolid (Chua et al, 2003; Szilvási-Nagy and Mátyási, 2003). The coordinates of 

the vertices are ordered according to the right hand screw rule, an anti-clockwise 

direction, such as the normal of the facet directed away from the model (Alves and 

Bártolo, 2006).

The generation of the STL representation follows two important rules shown in 

Figure 2.8 (Alves and Bártolo, 2006; Chen et al, 1999), as follows: 

 

? Facet orientation rule: the facets define the surface of the 3D object. The 

orientation of the facet involves the definition of the vertices for each 

triangle in a counter-clockwise order; 

? Adjacency rule: each triangular facet must share two vertices with each of 

its adjacent triangles.

c) A correct triangulation (Alves and Bártolo, 2006).

To assure that the adjacency rule is obeyed, it is necessary to verify the following 

consistency rules (Alves and Bártolo, 2006): 

 

? The number of triangles must be even; 

? The number of edges must be a multiple of three; 

? The number of triangles must be equal to two thirds of the number of 

edges. 

? The number of vertices is given by: 

 

0.5 2 (2.1) 

where V is the number of vertices and T is the number of triangles. 

 

To assure that the set of STL triangles comprises a closed volume, it is necessary 

to verify the Euler’s rule for solids. According to this rule, the definition of a proper 

solid implies that the following equation is verified (Alves and Bártolo, 2006): 

 

2  (2.2) 

with E being the number of edges, H the number of face holes, B the number of 

separate, disjoint bodies and P the number of passages, i.e., holes through the 

entire body. 

 

Triangles generated by triangulation must be equiangular whenever possible to 

avoid thin and long triangles. According to Chen et al (1999), the Delaunay 

triangulation satisfies the equiangularity criterion, expressed in terms of the 

maximum of minimum angles in a triangulation. The max-min angle criterion refers 

to the choice of the diagonal of a quadrilateral, i.e., a pair of triangles maximising 

the minimum of the six interior angles of the triangles, when the quadrilateral is 

strictly convex. The minimum interior angle “bdc”, illustrated in Figure 2.9.a, is 

smaller that the minimum interior angle “bac”, represented in Figure 2.9.b, so the 

second triangulation (Figure 2.9.b) is advantageous. If this strategy is locally 

applied to all edges of each triangle, the resulting triangulation is globally optimal 

(Alves et al, 2012; Chen et al, 1999).

angle (Alves et al, 2012; Alves and Bártolo, 2008; Chen et al, 1999). 

 

The disadvantages of the use of a tessellated representation, as a standard in 

additive manufacturing, are the following ones (Sunil and Pande, 2008): 

 

? It is a first-order approximation of the original CAD model; 

? It is a list of triangles with no topological information; 

? High degree of redundancy: each triangle is individually recorded and 

shared coordinates are duplicated in the file; 

? The user needs to input acceptable cordal tolerance, which is the distance 

between the plane of a triangle and its approximating surface. Increasing 

the number of triangles smoothens the surface, but leads to larger data 

files.

Many CAD systems generate incorrect STL files when the CAD models are very 

complex. Possible errors are non-manifold facets, gaps, incorrect normals, 

overlapping facets, etc (Sunil and Pande, 2008). 

 

Once finished, the STL file must be sliced. Slicing refers to intersecting a CAD 

model with a plane, in order to determine two dimensional contours (Figure 2.10). 

The slicing can be uniform, where the layer thickness is kept constant or adaptive, 

the layer thickness changes based on the surface geometry of the CAD model 

(Kulkarni et al, 2000). 

 

 

Figure 2.10 – Definition of a layer through the intersection between the 3D STL model and a slicing 

plane (Alves and Bártolo, 2006). 

 

Adaptive slicing involves slicing with varying layer thickness. In this strategy, 

surfaces of high curvature are sliced with thinner layer thickness and surfaces of 

low curvature are sliced with thicker layers. Adaptive slicing yields better surface 

quality, as the staircase effect decreases and the variations in the cusp height 

across the layers is minimized. The main advantage of adaptive slicing is that it 

gives the user explicit control over the surface quality (Kulkarni et al, 2000).

2.3.1. Additive Processes 

 

Additive biomanufacturing technologies include different fabrication strategies as 

indicated in Figure 2.11 (Bártolo et al, 2008). 

 

 

Figure 2.11 – Classification of additive technologies. 

 

The main advantages of additive biomanufacturing technologies are both the 

capacity to rapidly produce very complex 3D models and the ability to use various 

raw materials. When combined with clinical imaging data, these fabrication 

techniques can be used to produce constructs customised to the shape of the 

defect or injury. Some processes operate at room temperature, thus allowing for 

cell encapsulation and biomolecule incorporation without significantly affecting its 

viability. In the field of tissue engineering, additive biomanufacturing technologies 

are used to produce scaffolds with customised external shape and predefined 

internal morphology, allowing good control of pore distribution and size (Bártolo et 

al, 2012; Bártolo et al, 2008; Leong et al, 2008; Hutmacher et al, 2007; Bártolo, 

2006; Yeong et al, 2006; 2005; Hutmacher et al, 2004; Tsang and Bhatia, 2004; 

Leong et al, 2003).

(a) Stereolithographic Processes 

 

Stereolithographic processes produce three-dimensional solid objects in a multi-

layer procedure, through the selective photo-initiated cure reaction of a polymer 

(Bártolo and Mitchell, 2003). These processes usually employ two distinct 

methods of irradiation. The first method is the mask-based method in which an 

image is transferred to a liquid polymer by irradiating through a patterned mask. 

The irradiated part of the liquid polymer is then solidified. In the second method, a 

direct writing process using a focused UV beam produces polymer structures 

(Figure 2.12). 

 

 

Figure 2.12 – Stereolithography system. 

 

The direct or laser writing approach consists of a vat containing a photosensitive 

polymer, a moveable platform on which the model is built, a laser to irradiate and 

cure the polymer, and a dynamic mirror system to direct the laser beam over the 

polymer surface “writing” each layer. After drawing a layer, the platform dips into 

the polymer vat, leaving a thin film from which the next layer will be formed. 

 

Mask-based writing systems build models by shining a flood lamp through a mask, 

which lets light pass through it. These systems generally require the generation of 

a lot of masks with precise mask alignments. One solution for this problem is the 

use of a liquid crystal display (LCD), or a digital processing projection system as a 

flexible mask (Figure 2.13).

Figure 2.13 – Mask-based writing system and polyHEMA constructs produced at the Polytechnic 

Institute of Leiria. 

 

Microstereolithography is a relatively recent development, similar to conventional 

stereolithography. However, to get a better resolution, the beam needs to be more 

precisely focused, in order to reduce the spot size to a few micrometres of 

diameter. Several strategies were proposed (Bertsch et al, 2003): constrained 

surface techniques, free surface techniques, and integral processes. Integral 

microstereolithography represents the most recent advancement in this field, 

enabling the solidification of each layer in one irradiation step by projecting the 

corresponding image onto the surface of the photo-polymerisable resin, through 

either a liquid crystal display or a digital micro mirror device. MicroTEC (Germany) 

is one of the few companies producing commercial applications of 

microstereolithography. This technology, known as Rapid Micro Product 

Development (RMPD), uses an excimer laser as a light source that works on a 

vector-by-vector basis. 

 

Currently, a Multimaterial Microstereo-thermal-lithography system is being 

developed at the Centre for Rapid and Sustainable Product Development at the 

Polytechnic Institute of Leiria. This novel process combines both Ultra-Violet and 

Infrared radiation for a single separate or combined radiation of both light sources, 

allowing to process single or multiple materials available in the rotating platform. 

Figure 2.14 illustrates the system being developed.

Figure 2.14 – Multimaterial microstereo-thermal-lithography system (Bártolo, 2011). 

 

All of the abovementioned stereolithographic approaches are based on a single-

photon initiated polymerisation procedure. Two-photon-initiated polymerisation 

curing processes represent a useful stereolithographic alternative strategy to 

produce micro/nanoscale structures by using femtosecond infrared laser without 

photo-masks (Lemercier et al, 2005; Tormen et al, 2004; Kowata and Sun, 2003). 

In this process, the molecule simultaneously absorbs two photons instead of one, 

being excited to higher singlet states. The use of two-photon-initiated 

polymerisation allows a submicron 3D resolution, on top of enabling both a 3D 

fabrication at greater depth and an ultra-fast fabrication. 

 

The photopolymerisation of biomaterials via multiphoton excitation can also 

provide an efficient method of scaffold microfabrication. In this process, the beam 

of an ultra-fast infrared laser is tightly focused into the volume of a photosensitive 

material (Figure 2.15). The polymerisation process can be initiated by non-linear 

absorption within the focal volume. A multiphoton excitation was applied to 

fabricate scaffolds of a wide range of polymers and bulk protein formulations, such 

as collagen, laminin, fibronectin, bovine serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, etc.

Figure 2.15 – The principle of multiphoton polymerisation. 

 

Several groups developed stereolithographic processes for tissue engineering. 

Levy et al (1997) used a direct irradiation stereolithographic process to produce 

hydroxyapatite (HA) ceramic scaffolds for orbital floor prosthesis. A suspension of 

fine HA powder into a UV-photocurable resin was formulated and used as building 

material. The photo-cured resin acts as a binder to hold the HA particles together. 

The resin is then burnt out and the HA powder assembly sintered for 

consolidation. A similar approach was used by Griffith and Halloran (1996) to 

produce ceramic scaffolds using suspensions of alumina, silicon nitride and silica 

particles with a photo-curable resin. The binder was removed by pyrolysis and the 

ceramic structures sintered. 

 

Bryant and Anseth (2001) used a photopolymerisation process to encapsulate 

chondrocytes in poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) hydrogels structures, with thicknesses 

varying from 2 to 8 mm. The hydrogel structures were photo-cured at low light 

intensity (? 10 mW/cm2) during 10 minutes. The chondrocytes encapsulated, in the 

hydrogel structures and cultured in vitro during 6 weeks, remained viable and 

produced cartilaginous tissue. Results suggest that an increase in the hydrogel 

thickness from 2 to 8 mm do not change cell viability and uniformity.

38 
 

Stereolithography is also commonly used to produce a negative replica filled 

typically with ceramic slurries and burnt away during sintering. Chu et al (2001) 

developed a lost-mould technique to produce implants with designed channels and 

connection patterns (Figure 2.16). Stereolithography was used to create epoxy 

moulds, designed from negative image of implants. A highly loaded HA-acrylate 

suspension was cast into the mould. The mould and the acrylic binder were 

removed by pyrolysis, and the HA green scaffold submitted to a sintering process. 

The finest channel size achieved was about 366 ?m, and the range of implant 

porosity between 26% and 52%. 

 

 

Figure 2.16 – Sintered HA scaffolds produced by a lost-mould technique (Chu et al, 2001). 

 

A direct fabrication of biopolymeric scaffolds was also reported by Cooke et al 

(2002). They used a biodegradable resin mixture of diethyl fumarate, 

poly(propylene fumarate) and bisacylphosphine oxide as photoinitiator to produce 

scaffolds for bone ingrowth. 

 

Similarly, Matsuda and Mizutani (2002) developed a photopolymer containing 

biodegradable copolymer of trimethylene carbonate and ?-caprolactone. UV light 

was also used to fabricate hydrogel polymer scaffolds. The main limitation was the 

development of water-soluble components, both functional and photolabile 

(Fischer et al, 2001). 

 

A mask-based writing system can be used to pattern hydrogel structures with high 

resolution. Liu and Bhatia (2002) reported a method where multiple steps of 

micropatterned photopolymerisation processes can be coupled to produce 3D cell 

matrix structures with micro-scale resolution (Figure 2.17).

Lan et al (2009) produced poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF) scaffolds with highly 

interconnected porous structure and a porosity of 65%. The scaffolds were coated 

by applying accelerated biomimetic apatite and arginini-glycine-aspartic acid 

peptide coating to improve cell behaviour. The coated scaffolds were seeded with 

MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts, and their biologic properties were evaluated using an 

MTS assay and histologic staining. Melchels et al (2009) used a resin based on 

poly(D,L-lactide) macromonomers and a non-reactive diluent to produce porous 

scaffolds with gyroid architecture (Figure 2.18). In this work, it was also possible to 

observe that the pre-osteoblasts readily adhered and proliferated well on these 

scaffolds. 

 

 

Figure 2.18 – PDLLA scaffolds with a gyroid architecture built by stereolitography. Scale bars 

represent 500 ?m (Melchels et al, 2009). 

 

The main advantages of stereolithographic processes include the ability to fast 

curing at physiological temperatures. Most commonly used photopolymerisable 

materials for scaffolds include derivatives of polyethylene glycol (PEG) acrylate, 

PEG methacrylate, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and modified polysaccharides 

(Hutmacher et al, 2004). However, the number of materials with the appropriate 

characteristics, in terms of biodegradability, biocompatibility and mechanical 

properties, is still limited.

(b) Powder-bed fusion / Laser Sintering processes 

 

Selective laser sintering (SLS) uses a laser emitting infrared radiation, to 

selectively heat powder material just beyond its melting point (Figure 2.19). The 

laser traces the shape of each cross-section of the model to be built, sintering 

powder in a thin layer. It also supplies energy that not only fuses neighbouring 

powder particles, but also bonds each new layer to those previously sintered. For 

polymeric powders, the sintering process takes place in a sealed heated chamber 

at a temperature near the melting point filled with nitrogen or argon. After each 

layer is solidified, the piston over the model retracts to a new position and a new 

layer of powder is supplied using a mechanical roller. The powder that remains 

unaffected by the laser acts as a natural support for the model, and remains in 

place until the model is complete. An important limitation of SLS is the 

dependence between the pores of the scaffold, the particle size of the powder 

material and the compaction pressure. 

 

 

Figure 2.19 – Selective laser sintering process. 

 

Materials most commonly used in tissue engineering scaffolds by laser sintering 

are biocompatible polymers, such as polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly lactic acid 

(PLA) and biocompatible ceramics. PCL is a bioresorbable polymer used for bone 

and cartilage repair. It is more stable at ambient conditions than PCL, less 

expensive and readily available (Williams et al, 2005).

42 
 

Williams et al (2005) explored the potential of SLS to produce PCL scaffolds for 

the replacement of skeletal tissues. The scaffolds were seeded with bone 

morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) transduced fibroblasts. In vivo results show that 

these scaffolds enhance tissue in-growth, on top of possessing mechanical 

properties within the lower range of trabecular bone. Compressive modulus (52 to 

67 MPa) and yield strength (2.0 to 3.2 MPa) were in the lower range of human 

trabecular bone properties. 

 

Lee and Barlow (1996) coated calcium phosphate powder with polymer, by spray 

drying slurry of particulate and emulsion binder. The coated powder was then 

sintered to fabricate calcium phosphate bone implants. Afterwards, these 

structures were infiltrated with calcium phosphate solution or phosphoric acid-

based inorganic cement in order to increase cell behaviour. 

 

Hao et al (2005) investigated the use of SLS to fabricate HA mixed high density 

polyethylene (HDPE) scaffolds. Different scanning speeds and laser power values 

were considered. HA and HDPE powders with 40 % HA by volume ratio were 

mixed using a high speed blender. Different process parameters resulted in 

different sintered morphologies (Figure 2.20). Results show that for low power or 

high scanning speed the layers were in general not sintered or very fragile.

Zhou et al (2008) studied the use of bio-nano-composite microspheres, consisting 

of carbonated hydroxyapatite (CHAp) nanospheres within a PLLA matrix to 

produce scaffolds (Figure 2.21). PLLA microspheres and PLLA/CHAp 

nanocomposites microspheres were prepared by emulsion techniques. The 

resultant microspheres had a size of 5-30 ?m, suitable for the SLS process. The 

use of PLLA/CHAp nanocomposite microspheres seems to offer a solution to the 

problem of removing the excessive powder from the pores after fabrication.

nanocomposite scaffolds (Zhou et al, 2008). 

 

Popov et al (2004) proposed the concept of Surface Selective Laser Sintering 

(SSLS) technique enabling to extend the range of polymers that can be used for 

scaffold fabrication. Unlike conventional selective laser sintering, where polymer 

has a strong absorption at the laser wavelength, the SSLS process is based on 

melting the particle. This particle is transparent for laser radiation, due to the laser 

beam absorption by a small amount (&lt;0.1 wt%) of biocompatible carbon black 

homogeneously distributed along the polymer surface. This process allows 

preventing significant overheating of the particles internal domains that can lead to 

property change and degradation.

(c) Extrusion-based Processes 

 

The extrusion-based process, commercially known as Fused Deposition Modelling 

(FDM), was developed by Scott Crump (1989). It works on an additive principle by 

laying down material during the construction process in a layer-by-layer fashion. A 

plastic filament unwound from a coil or plastic granules within a chamber, supplies 

the material to an extrusion nozzle that extrudes small struts of thermoplastic 

material to form the part being produced. The extrusion nozzle is heated to melt 

the material. It can be moved in the horizontal direction as the construction 

platform moves vertically. Both the extrusion nozzle and platform is controlled by a 

computer to form the three-dimensional object (Figure 2.22). The material leaves 

the extruder in a liquid form and hardens immediately. The previously formed 

layer, which is the substrate for the next layer, must be maintained at a 

temperature just below the solidification point of the thermoplastic material, to 

assure good interlayer adhesion. 

 

 

Figure 2.22 – Fused Deposition Modelling process. 

 

Extrusion-based processes have been used to successfully produce scaffolds in 

PCL, PP-TCP, PCL-HA, PCL-TCP with resolution of 250 ?m. Some of the major 

limitations of FDM are both the use of filament-based materials and the high heat 

effect on raw material. In order to solve some limitations of the FDM process, such 

as the requirement of precursor filaments or high processing temperatures, some 

alternative processes were developed.

Woodfield et al (2004) used a FDM-like technique, called 3D Fibre Deposition, to 

produce poly(ethylene glycol)-terephthalate-poly(butylenes terephthalate) 

(PEGT/PBT) scaffolds for engineering of articular cartilage (Figure 2.23). By 

varying the co-polymer composition, porosity and pore geometry, scaffolds were 

produced with a range of mechanical properties close to articular cartilage. The 

scaffolds seeded with bovine chondrocytes supported a homogeneous cell 

distribution and subsequent cartilage-like tissue formation.

Drexel University researchers (Wang et al, 2004) developed a variation of FDM 

called Precision Extruding Deposition (PED), for the fabrication of bone tissue 

scaffolds (Figure 2.24). In this process, material in pellet or granule form is fed into 

a chamber where it is liquefied. Pressure from a rotating screw forces the material 

down a chamber and out through a nozzle tip. This process was used by Wang et 

al (2004) to directly fabricate PCL scaffolds, with controlled pore size of 250 ?m 

and designed structural orientations (0º/90º, 0º/120º or combined 0º/120º and 

0º/90º patterns). Proliferation studies were performed using cardiomyoblasts, 

fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. 

 

 

Figure 2.24 – Precision Extruding Deposition System developed by Wei Sun at Drexel University. 

 

In order to eliminate the elevated temperatures required by the extrusion-based 

processes, Xiong et al (2005) at Tsinghua University, developed a process called 

Low-temperature Deposition Manufacturing (LDM) to produce scaffolds at a low 

temperature environment under 0 ºC. The LDM system comprises a multi-nozzle 

extrusion process and a thermally induced phase separation process (Figure 

2.25). The LDM process was used to produce poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) and TCP 

composite scaffolds with BMP growth factor. The scaffolds were implanted into 

rabbit radius and canine radius with large-segmental defects. After 12 weeks, it 

was possible to observe that the rabbit radius defect was successfully repaired 

and the regenerated bone had properties similar to the healthy bone. For the 

canine radius, similar results were observed after 24 weeks (Yan et al, 2003a; 

2003b).

The Centre for Rapid and Sustainable Product Development, Polytechnic Institute 

of Leiria, developed a variation of FDM called BioExtruder (Figure 2.26.a) 

(Almeida et al, 2010; Mateus et al, 2008). It is a highly reproducible and low cost 

system enabling the controlled definition of pores into the scaffold, to modulate 

mechanical strength and molecular diffusion, as well the fabrication of multi-

material scaffolds. It comprises two different deposition systems: one rotational 

system for multi-material deposition acted by a pneumatic mechanism, and 

another one for a single material deposition that uses a screw to assist the 

deposition process (Figures 2.26.b and 2.26.c). A new version of this system, the 

Dual-Bioextruder, comprises a double head extrusion system to process multiple 

materials (Figure 2.27).

Recently, the Centre for Rapid and Sustainable Product Development at the 

Polytechnic Institute of Leiria developed another version of the Bioextruder system 

called BioCell Printing (Figure 2.28). The novel system is composed by four 

separate sections. The first section contemplates the multiple head extrusion 

system where scaffolds are produced. Scaffolds are then sterilised either 

chemically or physically in the second section before the cell seeding in the third 

section. Finally, the cell seeded scaffolds are then cultured in vitro under dynamic 

conditions inside the bioreactor located in the last section.

Bioplotting (Figure 2.29), a technique developed by the Freiburg Materials 

Research Centre and Envisiontec, Germany, uses a pressure-controlled dispenser 

to deposit material into a reactive liquid medium of comparable density. This 

balance of media densities, which allows scaffolds to be created without the need 

of support structures, is a key characteristic of this process. Buoyancy can be 

provided to the plotted material, making strands of material remaining in the 

correct position instead of sacking, due to gravitational effects. Figure 2.30 

illustrates some examples of scaffold structures made by the 3D-Bioplotter 

system. Materials, such as melts of poly(lactides), poly(lactide-co-glycolide), 

poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-valeriate), poly(caprolactone), poly(butylenes 

terephthalate-block-oligoethylene oxide), solutions of agar and gelatine, collagen 

and reactive biosystems involving fibrin formation and polyelectrolyte complexation 

were used by Pfister et al (2004).

Moroni et al (2006) reported a novel strategy to create hollow fibres with controlled 

shell thickness and lumen diameter, organizing them into 3D scaffolds. Hollow 

fibres (Figure 2.31), are made by extrusion of a blend of poly(butylmethacrylate-

methylmethacrylate) (P(BMA/MMA) and poly(ethylene oxideterephtalate)-co-

poly(butylene terephtalate) (PEOT/PBT), using the Bioplotter system. The polymer 

with lower viscosity tends to shift towards the walls during the flow along the 

nozzle of the extruder, due to viscosity differences. The consequent separation of 

the polymers produces a stratification effect. Hollow fibres are produced by 

removing the core polymer through selective dissolution. It was also observed that 

bovine primary articular chondrocytes grow and form ECM, not only in the scaffold 

macropores but also inside the hollow cavities (Figure 2.32). The use of these 

hollow matrices for selective drug release is under investigation.

An alternative process is the Pressure Assisted Microsyringe (PAM) that involves 

the deposition of polymer dissolved in solvent through a syringe (Vozzi et al, 

2003). The thickness of the polymer stream can be varied by changing the syringe 

pressure, solution viscosity, syringe tip diameter and motor speed. A resolution as 

low as 10 ?m was achieved on a 2D structure. 

 

Robocasting (Figure 2.33), also known as direct-write assembly, consists of a 

robotic deposition of highly concentrated colloidal suspensions capable of fully 

supporting their own weight during assembly, due to their viscoelastic properties 

(Miranda et al, 2006). This technique was used to fabricate ?-tricalcium phosphate 

(?-TCP) scaffolds (Saiz et al, 2007; Miranda et al, 2006).

Ang et al (2002) developed a rapid prototyping robotic dispersing (RPBOD) 

system using the same principle of the 3D bio-plotting system to produce chitosan-

HA scaffolds. Solutions of chitosan-HA were extruded into a sodium hydroxide and 

ethanol medium to induce the precipitation of chitosan. The scaffolds were then 

hydrated, frozen and freeze-dried.

(d) Inkjet / Three-dimensional printing processes 

 

Three-dimensional printing (3DP) was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of 

Technology (USA) by Sachs et al (1989). The process deposits a stream of micro-

particles of a binder material over the surface of a powder bed, joining particles 

together where the object is to be formed (Figure 2.34). A piston lowers the 

powder bed, so that a new layer of powder can be spread over the surface of the 

previous layer and then selectively joined to it. Therics Incorporated applied the 

3DP process to tissue engineering and developed the TheriForm process to 

fabricate drug delivery devices and scaffolds. Scaffolds can be tailored by varying 

the printing speed, the flow rate and drop position of the liquid water-based binder. 

3DP operates at room temperature, allowing the use of a wide range of 

biomaterials. 

 

 

Figure 2.34 – 3D Printing process. 

 

Kim et al (1998) employed 3DP with particulate leaching to create porous 

scaffolds, using polylactide-coglycolide (PLGA) powder mixed with salt particles 

and a suitable organic solvent. The salt particles were leached using distilled 

water. Cylindrical scaffolds measuring 8 mm (diameter) by 7 mm (height) with pore 

sizes of 45-150 ?m and 60% porosity, were fabricated. Hepatocytes were 

successful attached to the scaffolds.

The influence of pore size and porosity on cell adhesion and proliferation were 

investigated by Zeltinger et al (2001). Disc shaped poly(L-lactic acid) (L-PLA) 

scaffolds measuring 10 mm (diameter) by 2 mm (height) were produced through 

both 3DP and salt and leaching methods. The scaffolds were produced with two 

different porosities (75% and 90%) and four different pore size distributions (&lt;38, 

38-63, 63-106 and 106-150 ?m), and tested with cell culture using canine dermal 

fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells and microvascular epithelial cells. 

 

Lam et al (2002) developed a blend of starch-based powder containing corn-starch 

(50%), dextran (30%) and gelatine (20%), bounded by printing distilled water. 

Cylindrical scaffolds were produced, measuring 12.5 mm (diameter) by 12.5 mm 

(height), and infiltrated with different amounts of a copolymer solution consisting of 

75% L-PLA and 25% polycaprolactone in dichloromethane to improve their 

mechanical properties. 

 

Leukers et al (2005) produced HA scaffolds with complex internal structures and 

high resolution. MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded on the scaffolds, and cultivated 

under static and dynamic setups. Dynamic cultivation was performed in perfusion 

containers with a flow rate of 18 ?l/min. A histological evaluation was carried out to 

characterise the cell ingrowth process. It was observed that the dynamic 

cultivation method lead to a stronger population compared to the static cultivation 

method. Static cell culture led to multiple cell layers located on the surface of HA 

granules. Dynamic cells culture tends to grow in between the cavities of the 

granules. It was also found that cells proliferated deep into the structure, forming 

close contact to HA granules. 

 

Sachlos et al (2003) used an indirect approach to produce collagen scaffolds with 

complex internal morphologies and macroscopic shapes by using a 3DP sacrificial 

mould. A dispersion of collagen was cast into the mould and frozen. The mould 

was then dissolved with ethanol, and the collagen scaffold was dried with liquid 

carbon dioxide. Further research by Taboas et al (2003), Limpanuphap and Derby

(2002) and Park et al (1998), also exploited the capabilities of 3DP for tissue 

engineering. 

 

Ink-jet printing systems were used to print both aqueous solutions onto supports 

and cell within a scaffold (Saunders et al, 2004; Pardo et al, 2003). During the 

droplet formation process, the liquid material experiences shear rates close to 104 

s-1, and similar strains occurs during the impact (Saunders et al, 2004). Therefore, 

cells in suspension are subjected to large stresses and deformation. Nevertheless, 

ink-jet printing is a viable method for cell deposition and patterning (Saunders et 

al, 2004). Boland et al (2007) explored a cell and organ printing fabrication 

strategy to print cells and proteins within 3D hydrogel structures. Several 

examples of printed tissues, such as contractile cardiac hybrids, were developed. 

Alginate hydrogels were used as support structures. As indicated in Figure 2.35, 

endothelial cell attachment was observed. Filopodia can be seen at the leading 

edge of the cell, and lamellapodia at the trailing edge, suggesting cell migration 

into pores. It was postulated that local variation in the mechanical compliance of 

alginate structures induces cells to attach to the areas with greatest stiffness or 

highest stress. Since endothelial cells are also known to grow well on surfaces, it 

is not surprising to observe cell attachment on the inner surfaces of the alginate 

pores. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism of cell attachment to alginate structures 

is still unknown and requires further research. 

 

Similar procedures were used by Mironov et al (2003) and Yan et al (2003b), that 

developed the concept of cell printing (Figure 2.36). This process prints gels, 

single cells and cell aggregates offering a possible solution for organ printing. An 

analogous process, called Alginate-based Rapid Prototyping, was developed at 

the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria (Figure 2.37). This process produces alginate 

solid structures, by extruding a solution of sodium alginate, mixed with a solution 

of calcium chloride, providing a temporary support for the seeded cells in culture 

(Bártolo, 2006; Bártolo et al, 2004). Alginate is an anionic copolymer composed of 

homopolymeric regions of 1,4-linked ?-D-mannuronic (M blocks) and ?-L-guluronic 

acid (G blocks), interspersed with regions of alternating structure. Gelation occurs

when divalent ions take part in the interchain ionic binding between G-blocks in the 

polymer chain, giving rise to a three dimensional network (Figure 2.38). Such 

binding zones between the G-blocks are often referred to as “egg boxes”. These 

ions act as cross-linkers stabilising alginate chains to form a gel structure, which 

contains cross-linked chains spread with more freely movable chains that bind and 

entrap large quantities of water. The gelification process is characterised by a re-

organisation of the gel network, accompanied by the expulsion of water. Gels 

containing M-rich alginate are softer and more fragile, and may also have lower 

porosity, due to the lower binding strength between the polymer chains and to the 

higher flexibility of the molecules. The gelification process is highly dependent 

upon diffusion of gelification ions into the polymer network. Trasmittancy, swelling 

and viscoelasticity of alginate structures are highly affected by the M/G ratio.

(e) Advantages and Disadvantages of Additive Manufacturing 

 

Additive biomanufacturing has been established as a viable set of processes to 

produce three-dimensional scaffolds of various materials, including polymers, 

hydrogels and ceramics. These technologies have a great potential, offering a high 

degree of freedom for tissue engineering for either the design of scaffolds (pore 

size, pore geometry, orientation, interconnectivity, etc.) or its fabrication. Scaffold 

fabrication, using these techniques, allows the possibility of indirectly controlling 

macroscopic properties, such as the bulk mechanical properties and the 

permeability for nutrient transport considerations. Several materials can also be 

used, enabling the production of both soft and hard scaffolds. These 

characteristics can enhance the fabrication of biomimetic scaffolds, functionally 

graded scaffolds and scaffolds for complex biomechanical applications. The 

emergence of these technologies in tissue engineering also increases the need for 

adaptation of the existing standards. Future developments will possibly lead to 

establishing additive biomanufacturing as a key tool for tissue reconstruction and 

regeneration. 

 

Scaffold porosity, pore and filament size achieved by additive biomanufacturing 

techniques, are listed in Table 2.1.The main advantages and limitations of additive 

biomanufacturing scaffolds for tissue engineering applications are indicated in 

Table 2.2. Table 2.3 shows the achieved mechanical properties of some 

biomanufactured scaffolds.

Chapter 3 – Scaffold Design 

3. Scaffold Design 

 

3.1. Computational Design in Tissue Engineering 

 

A temporary three-dimensional scaffold mimicking the physiological functions of 

the native ECM is vital for maintaining the cells’ ability to express their native 

differentiated phenotypes. An optimal scaffold design will promote cell proliferation 

and cell-specific matrix production that would eventually take over the supporting 

role of the degrading scaffold (Leong et al, 2008). In addition to comply with the 

listed biological and physical requirements (see Section 1.1.2), an optimum 

scaffold must also have functional and anatomical requirements, similar to the 

functional gradient of the host tissue or organ. The external geometry and size of 

the scaffold must be the same of the natural tissue, in order to anchor the scaffold 

onto the defected location (Leong et al, 2008; Sun et al, 2005). 

 

In the past years, several tools have been developed to support the design of 

scaffolds for tissue engineering, such as the Computer-Aided Tissue Engineering 

(CATE) developed by Sun et al (2004a; 2004b; Sun and Lal; 2002) and the 

Computer Aided System for Tissue Scaffolds (CASTS) developed by Naing et al 

(2008; 2005). These computational tools (Figure 3.1) integrate different routines 

and systems to support both the design and fabrication of scaffolds. The Centre 

for Rapid and Sustainable Product Development developed a computational tool 

called Expert System for Medical Applications (ESYSMA) enabling the selection of 

appropriate materials for medical applications (Moura et al, 2010). Figure 3.1 

explains how the most relevant advanced engineering systems can be integrated 

in order to aid the design and fabrication process for tissue engineering scaffolds. 

These systems integrate several tools and systems ranging from the design to 

engineering to the biomanufacturing of the structures, to optimize scaffold’s 

performance.

60 
 

 

 

Figure 3.1 – Computer Aided Tissue Engineering. 

 

This ESYSMA system (Figure 3.1) is structured into four main levels: 

 

? Level 1: Automatic identification of the appropriated biomaterial for a certain 

application; 

 

? Level 2: Automatic definition of the most appropriate geometry, porosity and 

pore topology of scaffolds for a certain application; 

 
? Level 3: Automatic definition of the growth factor to be used in a certain 

application; 

 
? Level 4: Automatic identification of the manufacturing technology regarding 

or not the encapsulation of cells. 



Smart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications

 

 

61
 

 

The material’s selection for a specific medical application is performed on the 

requirements of the desired material’s performance based on a hierarchical 

knowledge structure, combining Case-Based and Ruled-Based Reasoning. To 

identify the most adequate material, a set of questions and the corresponding 

answers must be carried out concerning issues such as: 

 

? the biodegradability of the material; 

? the permeability to water; 

? its absorption ability; 

? whether it will be in contact with organic fluids; 

? whether it will need to sustain a structural application; 

? whether it has to be environmentally responsive to changes of pH and/or 

temperature, etc. 

 

An extensive database of biomaterials was also developed and integrated into the 

developed system. This computational system can assist in the selection process 

of an appropriate biomaterial for a given medical application.

3.2. Computational Scaffold Modelling 

 

The design of optimised scaffolds for tissue engineering is a key topic of research, 

as the complex macro- and micro- architectures required for a scaffold depends on 

the mechanical properties, physical and molecular queues of the surrounding 

tissue, at the defect site. One way to achieve such hierarchical designs is to create 

a library of unit cells (the scaffold is assumed to be a “Lego” structure), which can 

be assembled through a specific computational tool (Bucklen et al, 2008; Naing et 

al, 2008; Adachi, 2006; Hollister, 2005; Cheah et al, 2004). 

 

The modelling of scaffolds for tissue engineering applications can be grouped into 

four main domains, as illustrated in Figure 3.2: 

 

1. The analytical methods contain empirical relationships between 

structural parameters and mechanical properties. They only provide an 

estimate of the global mechanical properties. 

 

2. In the CAD-based modelling method, the porous structure is 

approximated using a 3D repetition of building blocks (called “unit cells”) of 

simply geometry. The unit cells can be generated by Boolean operations. 

Simple CAD software tools may be used in this process. 

 

3. The CT-based modelling uses an image-based approach, where a 3D 

image of a structure serves as a basis for the mesh generation. 

 
Several existing computational tools that can be used to process medical 

imaging data and obtain the 3D data of the desired anatomic model, such as 

Invesalius, Mimics, 3D-Doctor, Anatomics. 

 

Invesalius is a free medical software used to reconstruct structures of the 

human body. It is based on two-dimensional images, acquired by Computed 

tomography or Magnetic resonance imaging equipments. The software 



Smart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications

 

 

63
 

generates virtual three-dimensional models correspondent to anatomical 

parts of the human body. After reconstructing three-dimensionally the DICOM 

images, the software allows the generation of STL files. These files can then 

be used for additive fabrication. Invesalius was developed at Renato Archer 

Technology of Information Centre (CTI), a research institute of the Brazilian 

Science and Technology Centre. 

 

Mimics is another medical imaging processing software package for 3D 

design and modelling, developed by Materialise NV, Belgium. Mimics 

generates and modifies surface 3D models from stacked image data such as 

Computed Tomography (CT), Confocal Microscopy, Micro CT, and Magnetic 

Resonance Imaging (MRI) through image segmentation. The 3D files are 

represented in the STL format. The most common input format is DICOM, but 

other image formats such as TIFF, JPEG, BMP and Raw are also 

compatible. The output file formats differ, depending on the subsequent 

application: common 3D output formats include STL, VRML, PLY and DXF. 

The 3D files can also be optimized for FEA or CFD, and then exported to 

Abaqus in INP format, to Ansys in INP, CDB and MSH format, to Nastran in 

OUT, NAS and BDF format, and to Comsol in MPHTXT format. The files can 

also be exported in IGES format or as Point Cloud Data for Computer-aided 

design. 

 

4. The Homogenisation theory is a multi-level approach, where the micro-

level model represents the exact micro-architecture of the structure, while the 

macro-level model is a continuum model of the whole structure.

64 
 

 

Figure 3.2 – Modelling Structure of scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. 

 

The CT-based modelling and the Homogenisation theory are very complex 

methods. These two methods need powerful computers in order to undergo the 

modelling and numerical calculations, due to the high number elements within the 

polygon meshes. In order to overcome the existing limitations of these methods, a 

CAD-based modelling strategy was adopted for this research work (Figure 3.3). 

Thus CAD-based modelling approach uses finite element methods for the 

numerical simulation of both the mechanical and vascular behaviour and the 

topological optimisation, as well analytical methods to compare experimental 

results with numerical data.

3.3. Computer Aided Design of Scaffolds (CADS) 

 

The prediction of the effective optimal properties of tissue scaffolds is very 

important for tissue engineering applications, to obtain the mechanical, vascular or 

topological properties. To implement the proposed strategy, already defined in the 

previous Section (3.2), a computational tool was developed, named Computer-

Aided Design of Scaffolds (CADS), enabling to quantify the structural 

heterogeneity, and the mechanical and vascular properties of a scaffold with a 

designed macro and microstructure. 

 

CADS comprises 4 main domains for the modelling, simulation and optimisation of 

scaffolds: 

 

? The first domain concerns the scaffold modelling, where two types of 

scaffold units can be defined, namely non-triple and triple periodic minimal 

surfaces. 

? The second domain regards the biomaterial properties for hard or soft 

tissue applications. In this case, the materials considered can be 

characterized by the ESYSMA material database. After this material 

selection process, the selected material’s properties are introduced in the 

CADS platform for the numerical calculations. 

? The third domain is concerned with the material behaviour. Two analytical 

models are considered, namely linear and non-linear elasticity. 

? The fourth domain corresponds to the type of analysis to be performed: 

mechanical, vascular or topological optimisation. 

 

Figure 3.4 illustrates the four domains and its contents within the CADS software.

3.4. Geometric Scaffold Modelling 

 

In this research work, scaffolds are considered as a LEGO structure formed by an 

association of small elementary units or blocks. Two types of elementary scaffold 

units were considered: 

 

? Non-triple periodic minimal surfaces; 

? Triple periodic minimal surfaces. 

 

3.4.1. Non-Triple Periodic Minimal Surfaces 

 

Figure 3.5 illustrates elementary scaffold units of the so-called “n faces per pore” 

block family, while Figure 3.6 represents elementary scaffold units of the so-called 

“m pores per face” block family. The “n faces per pore” block family are elements 

consisting of 4 pores per face, in which the number of faces per pore varies from 4 

faces per pore “4F”, to 8 faces “8F”, 12 faces “12F” and infinite faces (circular 

pores “CF”). The “m pores per face” block family are elements consisting of 

multiple pores per face within each unit, while maintaining a specific scaffold’s 

porosity.

Scaffold units with rectangular pores were produced in PCL for the mechanical 

evaluation. Rectangular prisms measuring 30 x 30 x 8 mm were initially designed 

with a 0º/90º, using CAD software. Scaffold units were produced using the 

Bioextruder system (see Section 2.7) with different pore sizes. Figure 3.7 shows 

the main design parameters considered, while Table 3.1 indicates the values of 

both design and processing parameters. An example of a PCL unit is illustrated in 

Figure 3.8.

Produced scaffolds were submitted to compression tests. The constructs were cut 

into block-shape specimens characterized by the following dimensions: 5 x 5 x 8 

mm (length ( ) x width ( ) x height ( )). All tests were carried out in dry state at a 

rate of 1 mm/min up to a strain value of 0.5, using an Ingstrom 5566 testing 

system equipped with a 1 KN load cell. Five compression tests were considered 

for each group of design parameters. 1

Development of the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria.

The “apparent” stress was evaluated as the force , measured through the load 

cell divided by the total area of the apparent cross section of the scaffold (

):

while the strain  was defined as the ratio between the scaffold height variation ?  

(i.e. the vertical displacement equal to the cross head displacement) and the 

scaffold initial height : 

 

?

The Figures 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11 illustrate the compressive stress-strain curves 

obtained. The results show that the 3D scaffold’s mechanical behaviour is similar 

to the flexible foam behaviour (Gibson, 2005).

After obtaining the stress-strain curves for each test sample, an average stress-

strain curve was calculated for each pore size. Figures 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11 shows 

average stress-strain curve and its deviation for each pore size. Figure 3.12 shows 

a comparison of all the average stress-strain behaviours obtained for the scaffolds 

tested in this research work.

Once determined the average stress-strain curves for each pore size, the 

compressive bulk modulus and the compressive tensile stress were evaluated. 

The compressive tensile stress corresponds to both the limit value of the scaffold’s 

elastic behaviour and the starting point of the scaffold’s plastic behaviour. The 

Maximum Tensile Stress, which represents the tensile cut-off stress in the 

numerical simulations, was also determined. The obtained data can be observed 

in Table 3.2.

3.4.2. Triple Periodic Minimal Surfaces 

 

Minimal periodic surfaces are the most studied hyperbolic surfaces. If a minimal 

surface has space group symmetry, it is periodic in three independent directions, 

so it is called Triple Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMS) (Qi and Wang, 2009; Jung 

et al, 2007; Wang, 2007; Gandy et al, 2001; Wohlgemuth et al, 2001). 

 

TPMS are also biomimetic surfaces describing several natural shapes, such as 

lyotropic liquid crystals, zeolite sodalite crystal structures, diblock polymers, 

hyperbolic membranes (prolamellar structure of choloroplasts in plants), 

echinoderm plates (interface between the inorganic crystalline and organic 

amorphous matter in the skeleton), cubosomes and certain cell membranes 

(Larsson et al, 2003; Hyde, 1996; Andersson, 1983; Scriven, 1976). 

 

A periodic surface can be defined as: 

 

? cos 2 ? ?  (3.3) 

where  is the location vector in Euclidean space,  is the  lattice vector in 

reciprocal space,  is the magnitude factor,  is the wavelength of periods,  is 

the phase shift, and C is a constant. Specific periodic structures and phases can 

be constructed based on this implicit form (Qi and Wang, 2009; Wang, 2007). 

 

In the case of the TPMS, the Weierstrass formula describes their parametric form 

in the following way:

 (3.4) 

where ? is a complex variable, ? is the so-called Bonnet angle, and R(?) is the 

function that varies for different surfaces. 

 

From a multi-dimensional control parameter space view, the geometric shape of a 

periodic surface is specified by a periodic vector, defined by the following equation 

(Qi and Wang, 2009; Wang, 2007): 

 

? , , ,??  (3.5) 

where: 

 

 

 

?  

are row concatenations of magnitudes, reciprocal lattice matrix, phases, and 

period lengths respectively. 

 

Two types of parametric hyperbolic surfaces are considered: 

 

? Schwartz surfaces; 

? Schoen surfaces. 

 

The effect of two relevant design parameters is also investigated: 

 

? Thickness 

? Radius

Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering 

4. Structural Analysis 

 

4.1. Mechanical Behaviour of Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering 

 

It is well known that tissues grow and remodel in response to changes in 

mechanical forces (Wang and Thampatty, 2006), and a typical example is bone, 

which changes its shape, density, and stiffness when the mechanical loading 

conditions are altered (Turner and Pavalko, 1998; Mullender et al, 2004). Similarly, 

blood vessels remodel themselves in response to altered blood pressure and 

shear stress (Owens, 1996; Williams, 1998). On the other hand, the mechanical 

forces play a fundamental role in the regulation of cell functions, including gene 

induction, protein synthesis, cell growth, death, and differentiation, which are 

essential to maintain tissue homeostasis. Abnormal mechanical loading conditions 

alter cellular function and change the structure and composition of the ECM, 

eventually leading to tissue or organ pathologies such as osteoporosis, 

osteoarthritis, tendinopathy, atherosclerosis, and fibrosis in the bone, cartilage, 

tendon, vessels, heart, lung, and skin (Bag et al, 2004; Borer et al, 2004; Eckes 

and Krieg, 2004; Lammerding et al, 2004; Ingber, 2003; Riley et al, 2002; Ireland 

et al, 2001; Grodzinsky et al, 2000; Chicurel et al, 1998; Ross, 1986). 

 

The mechanical stimulation induced on the cells, to increase their proliferation and 

differentiation or its biological process, which is regulated by mechanical signals, is 

designated as Mechanobiology (Chen et al, 2011). This domain has been 

receiving increasing attention over the recent years (van der Meulen and Huiskes, 

2002; Huiskes et al, 2000). It is believed that biophysical stimulus play a key role 

in regulating the tissue growth and remodelling process of bones (Jacobs et al, 

2010; Kelly and Jacobs, 2010), during the fracture healing process (Kelly and 

Prendergast, 2005; Carter et al, 1988) or the tissue regeneration process in

porous scaffolds (Tsubota et al, 2009; Adachi et al, 2006). A mechano-regulatory 

model can be defined as the mechanical strain and fluid flow that modulates cell 

differentiation, showing considerable potential to capture the growth details of 

various cell phenotypes under different levels of biophysical stimuli (Prendergast 

et al, 1997). Byrne et al (2007) divided this phenomenon into two different levels. 

The first one at the scaffold level, where the mechanical and fluidic fields were 

analysed through a poroelasticity model. The second one at the cellular level, 

where the proliferation and differentiation of MSCs were simulated based on the 

correlation between the levels of mechano-regulatory stimuli and experimental 

data. Mechanical loading not only affects the ECM synthesis of native tissues, but 

also modulates the ECM structure, composition, and mechanical properties of 

tissue engineering constructs (Wang and Thampatty, 2006). 

 

In this research work, the Byrne et al (2007) approach was adopted by considering 

the mechano-regulatory model at the scaffold level, where the mechanical and 

vascular behaviour were analysed. Once the scaffold is seeded and cultured, the 

formation of tissues with desirable properties relies on the scaffold’s mechanical 

properties, both at a macroscopic and microscopic level. Macroscopically, the 

scaffold must bear loads to provide stability to the tissues as they form and fulfil its 

volume maintenance function. At the microscopic level, cell growth and 

differentiation and the ultimate tissue formation are dependent on the mechanical 

input to the cells. Consequently, the scaffold must be able to both withstand 

specific loads and transmit them, in an appropriate manner, to the growing and 

surrounding cells and tissues. The specific mechanical properties of scaffolds that 

were considered in this research work were the elasticity, compressibility and 

tensile strength.

4.2. Constitutive Equations for Structural Analysis 

 

Many natural materials are not fully dense, i.e. they possess internal cavities 

similar to the designed structures considered in this research work. This type of 

design is intentional, since it reduces the structure’s density, and in some cases 

present optimal performance regarding mechanical solicitations (Meyers et al, 

2008). An example of a biological cellular material is cancellous bone, which is 

designed to have a variable density, where regions subjected to higher stresses 

are denser (Meyers et al, 2008). By definition, a cellular solid (Figure 4.1) is made 

up of an interconnected network of solid struts or plates, which form the edges and 

faces of cells (Gibson and Ashby, 1997). According to this definition, polymeric 

and ceramic tissue engineering scaffolds are characterized as cellular structures. 

The stress–strain curve for a cellular solid in compression is characterized by 

different behaviours (Figure 4.2): i) a linear elastic one, corresponding to cell edge 

bending or face stretching; ii) a stress plateau, corresponding to progressive cell 

collapse by elastic buckling, iii) a plastic yielding or brittle crushing, depending on 

the nature of the solid from which the material is made; and iv) a densification one, 

corresponding to the collapse of the cells throughout the material and subsequent 

loading of the cell edges and faces against one another (Gibson, 2005). Figure 4.3 

illustrates the compression stress-strain curve for cancellous bone with three 

different relative densities (Meyers et al, 2008; Gibson and Ashby, 1997).

To investigate the mechanical behaviour of scaffolds, two different mechanical 

behaviours were considered: 

 

? Firstly, a linear elastic behaviour to understand the behaviour of each basic 

scaffold unit; 

? A crushable foam behaviour to simulate the complex stress-strain 

relationship in cellular constructs.

4.2.1. Linear Elastic Behaviour 

 

In this research work, scaffolds are assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic 

with a linear elastic behaviour. From a mathematical view, a linear elastic material 

can be described by the following equation (Humphrey and Delange, 2003; Fung, 

1990): 

 

klijklij eC  ??  (4.1) 

where ij?  is the stress tensor, kle  is the strain tensor, and ijklC  is a tensor of 

elastic constants or moduli, which are independent of stress or strain. 

 

In the case of isotropic materials, Equation 4.1 can be simplified as follows: 

 

ijijxxij ee  2 ???? ??  (4.2) 

with  ?  and ? , being the Lamé constants. 

 

Similarly, the strain tensor for an isotropic linear elastic material is given by the 

following equation:

4.2.2. Crushable Foam Behaviour 

 

The constitutive model for crushable foams, described in this section, is 

considered for the analysis of materials typically used in energy absorption 

structures. The crushable foam plasticity models present the following 

characteristics: 

 

? can be used to model crushable materials other than foams, such as balsa 

wood; 

? are used to model the enhanced ability of a foam material to deform in 

compression, due to cell wall buckling processes. It is assumed that the 

resulting deformation is not instantaneously recoverable, ideally presenting 

a plastic behaviour for short duration events; 

? can be used to model the difference between a foam material's 

compressive strength and its much smaller tensile bearing capacity, 

resulting from the cell wall breakage in tension; 

? must be used in conjunction with the linear elastic material model; 

? can be used when rate-dependent effects are important; 

? are intended to simulate material response under essentially monotonic 

loading. 

 

Two phenomenological constitutive models are presented: 

 

? The volumetric hardening model; 

? The isotropic hardening model. 

 



Smart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications

 

 

87
 

Both models use a yield surface with an elliptical dependence of either the 

deviatoric stress or the pressure stress in the meridional plane. 

 

The volumetric hardening model was developed based on the different response 

foam structures usually experience in compression and tension. In compression 

the ability of the material to deform volumetrically is enhanced by cell wall buckling 

processes, as described by Gibson et al (1982), Gibson and Ashby (1982) and 

Maiti et al (1984). It is assumed that the resulting deformation is not 

instantaneously recoverable, ideally presenting a plastic behaviour for short 

duration events. On the other hand, in tension, cell walls break readily, as a result 

the tensile load bearing capacity of crushable foams may be considerably smaller 

than its compressive load bearing capacity. Under monotonic loading, the 

volumetric hardening model assumes perfectly plastic behaviour for pure shear 

and negative hydrostatic pressure stress states, while hardening takes place for 

positive hydrostatic pressure stress states. 

 

The isotropic hardening model was originally developed for metallic foams by 

Deshpande and Fleck (2000). It assumes symmetric behaviour in tension and 

compression, and the evolution of the yield surface is governed by an equivalent 

plastic strain, contributes for both the volumetric plastic strain and the deviatoric 

plastic strain. 

 

This isotropic foam model crushes one-dimensionally with a Poisson's ratio that is 

essentially zero. The stress–strain behaviour is depicted in Figure 4.4, showing an 

example of unloading from point “a” to the tension cut-off stress at “b”, then 

unloading to point “c”, and finally reloading to point “d”. At point “d” the reloading 

will continue along the loading curve. It is important to use nonzero values for the 

tension cut-off, to prevent the disintegration of the material under small tensile 

loads. For high values of tension cut-off, the behaviour of the material will be 

similar in tension and compression.

Figure 4.4 – Yield stress versus volumetric strain curve for the crushable foam. 

 

For the implementation of this model, it is assumed that the Young's modulus is 

constant and the stress elastic behaviour updated along time, as follows: 

 

?  (4.10) 

 

The magnitudes of the principal values, , 1,3 are then checked, to 

evaluate the yield stress, , is exceeded, and if so they are scaled back to the 

yield surface, as follows: 

 

				 		  (4.11) 

 

After the scale of the principal values, the stress tensor is transformed back into 

the global system. The yield stress is a function of the natural logarithm of the 

relative volume, , i.e., the volumetric strain, as illustrated in Figure 4.4. 

 

The mechanical behaviour of crushable foams is known to be sensitive to the rate 

of straining. This effect can be introduced by either a piecewise linear law or the 

overstress power law model.

The strain rate decomposition 

 

The volume change is decomposed as in the following way: 

 

?  (4.12) 

where  is the ratio of current volume to original volume,  is the elastic 

(recoverable) part of the ratio of current to original foam volume, and  is the 

plastic (non-recoverable) part of the ratio of current to original foam volume. 

 

Volumetric strains are defined as: 

 

ln  

ln  

ln  

(4.13) 

 

Equations 4.12 and 4.13 result in the usual additive strain rate decomposition for 

volumetric strains according to the following equations: 

 

 (4.14) 

 

The model also assumes that the deviatoric strain rate decompose additively, so 

that the total strain rate decomposes as follows: 

 

 (4.15) 

 

Elastic behaviour 

 

Only the linear elastic behaviour can be modelled as follows:

Crushable foam model with volumetric hardening 

 

The volumetric hardening model assumes that the hydrostatic tension strength, , 

remains constant throughout any plastic deformation process. By contrast, the

Hardening 

 

The yield surface intersects the p–axis at  and . It is assumed that  remains 

fixed throughout any plastic deformation process. By contrast, the compressive 

strength, , evolves as a result of compaction (increase in density) or dilation 

(reduction in density) of the material. The evolution of the yield surface can be 

expressed through the evolution of the yield surface size on the hydrostatic stress 

axis, , as a function of the value of volumetric compacting plastic strain,

Poisson's ratio). Thus, the user provides input to the hardening law by specifying 

only the value of the yield stress in uniaxial compression as a function of the 

absolute value of the axial plastic strain. 

 

4.2.3. Summary 

 

In this research work, two constitutive models were considered: 

 

? A linear elastic behaviour model for small deformations within the scaffold’s 

elastic domain; 

? A crushable foam behaviour model, where a linear elastic model was also 

considered for the deformation within the elastic domain, combined with the 

volumetric hardening model for the high deformations within the plastic 

domain. The volumetric hardening model is the most adequate model, as 

the cellular structures considered in this work are polymer based.

4.3. Mechanical Simulations 

 

The main goal for simulating the scaffold mechanical behaviour is to evaluate the 

porosity dependence on both elastic and shear modulus. For the mechanical 

simulations, two types of loads were used. A tensile solicitation was applied to 

both triple periodic and non-triple periodic surfaces. In order to validate the 

proposed approach, a compression solicitation was also applied to non-triple 

periodic surfaces and the obtained results compared with experimental data. The 

mathematical formulation described in this section was implemented in Abaqus 

(Abaqus v6.10 from Simulia). Figure 4.7 illustrates the implemented simulation 

algorithm.

For the numerical computation of the elastic modulus, a uniform displacement in a 

single direction is considered (the X direction), which is equivalent to the strain on 

the same direction (?x), imposed to a face of the block (Face A) (Figure 4.10). The 

opposite face (Face B) of the scaffold unit is constrained and unable to have any 

displacement (Figure 4.10.a). The average reaction force produced on Face B is 

used to determine the elastic modulus, due to the imposed displacement. For the 

numerical evaluation of the shear modulus, a uniform displacement is applied on 

the top of a surface, being the opposite face also unable to have any displacement 

(Figure 4.10.b). Each unit is considered isotropic.

4.4.1. Linear Elastic Simulations 

 

(a) Non-Triple Periodic Minimal Surfaces 

 

The effect of the pore architecture, illustrated by Figures 4.11.a and 4.11.b, show 

the decrease of both the elastic and shear modulus for PCL with the increase of 

porosity. For tensile loads, the findings show that a “4F” unit is the unit with the 

worst performance (below 50% porosity), being the best scaffold unit for higher 

percentages of porosity, as below 50% porosity the circular pore scaffolds are the 

units with better material modulus. For shear solicitations, results show that the 

“4F” unit is the unit with the worst performance, being the “CP” scaffolds the unit 

with better performance.

Another aspect of critical importance is the effect of the number of pores per face 

on the mechanical behaviour of the scaffold. It is possible to observe that the 

scaffold’s modulus increases with the number of pores per face, for each unit, as 

illustrated in Figures 4.12, 4.13 and 4.14

(b) Triple Periodic Minimal Surfaces 

 

The variation of scaffold porosity and elastic modulus, as a function of the surface 

thickness for Schwartz surfaces, are presented in Figures 4.15 and 4.16. Results 

show that the porosity decreases by an increase on the surface thickness, while 

the elastic modulus increases. Figure 4.17 shows a linear dependence between 

the scaffold porosity and the elastic modulus.

Figures 4.18 and 4.19 present the effect of changing the surface radius for 

Schwartz surfaces, on both porosity and elastic modulus. It is possible to observe 

that the porosity decreases by increasing the surface radius till a threshold value, 

from which it starts to increase. The elastic modulus decreases by increasing the 

surface radius.

Figure 4.19 – Schwartz surface: variation of the elastic modulus with the surface radius. 

 

The relationship between porosity and surface radius has a hyperbolic behaviour. 

A similar behaviour was observed regarding the relationship between elastic 

modulus and porosity (Figure 4.20), so we can decrease or increase the elastic 

modulus of the scaffold while maintaining high porosity values, which can offer 

great flexibility regarding scaffold design. High porosity is critical for 

vascularization and tissue ingrowth.

Figures 4.21 to 4.26 present the effect of thickness and surface radius variation for 

Schoen geometries. The porosity decreases by increasing surface thickness, as 

observed in Figure 4.21. Figures 4.22 and 4.23 shows that the elastic modulus 

increases with thickness and decreases with porosity. The effect of changing the 

surface radius (Figure 4.24), shows that the porosity increases by increasing the 

surface radius. In the case of Schoen surfaces, the elastic modulus decreases by 

increasing either the surface radius (Figure 4.25) or the porosity (Figure 4.26).

Figures 4.15 to 4.26 illustrate the scaffold basic unit mechanical behaviour on a 

macro-scale level, regarding porosity and geometric parameters like radius and 

thickness, for both Schwartz and Schoen surfaces. Figure 4.27 illustrates the Von 

Misses tensile stresses and the normal xx?  stress variation, according to the 

node’s geometric “X” position in the scaffold basic unit. Figure 4.27 shows that 

both tensile stresses are similar, which means that the other tensile or shear 

stresses are less significant. It is also possible to observe that the geometric 

transition, from the corner channel to the central sphere, is characterized by a 

decrease on the average tensile stresses, i.e., if cells are seeded on this particular 

scaffold and then placed in a perfusion bioreactor, in the presence of a mechanical 

stimuli, they will tend to differentiate and proliferate in the corner channels, and the 

central sphere correspond to both the largest surface area of the scaffold and the 

high mechanical stimuli/surface ratio.

Figures 4.28 to 4.31 illustrate the tensile stress variation of the scaffold on a micro-

scale level, considering the variation of both the thickness (Figure 4.28 for the 

Schwartz geometry, and Figure 4.30 for the Schoen one) and the radius (Figure 

4.29 for the Schwartz geometry and Figure 4.31 for the Schoen one). 

 

Figure 4.28 shows that, by increasing the thickness in the Schwartz geometries, 

the tensile stresses tend to assume the higher values at the two lateral faces, 

resulting in an uneven tensile stress distribution. The scaffold presents a more 

homogenous tensile distribution for lower thickness values. Regarding the radius 

variation, illustrated in Figure 4.29, there is no significant tensile stress variation 

with the radius increase. 

 

A similar behaviour is observed for the Schoen’s thickness variation. As illustrated 

in Figure 4.30, the Schoen geometries present a more homogenous tensile stress 

for lower thickness values. Regarding the radius variation (Figure 4.31), results 

show that, as the radius increases, a more differentiated tensile stress distribution 

is observed, namely in the central sphere of the Schoen geometry. In this case, 

Schoen geometries with lower radius values present a more optimum mechanical 

distribution for cell differentiation and proliferation.

(c) Summary 

 

From the numerical results, it is possible to observe that the Triple periodic 

minimal surface scaffolds have higher versatility of these structures and better 

mechanical performance for higher levels of porosity. For instance, with the same 

level of porosity, one may define two different Schwartz structures with two levels 

of mechanical behaviour. In other words, they are more advantageous for scaffold 

modelling. Within the triple periodic minimal surfaces, the Schwartz and Schoen 

surfaces have similar mechanical behaviour, in spite of the Schwartz ones that 

present a higher number of geometric variations for both radius and thickness 

variations.

4.4.2. Crushable Foam Simulations 

 

In order to undergo the numerical compressive simulations, in addition to the 

material properties listed in Table 4.1, other properties were introduced along with 

a stress-strain curve of each material. The “Rate sensitivity via damping 

coefficient” is a material parameter that must be defined, in spite of not being 

necessary for the performed simulations. This parameter would only be used in 

the case of impact simulations, which is not the case being investigated.

For simulation purposes, scaffolds were assumed to be rectangular structures with 

the following dimensions: 

 

? length ( ): 2.5 mm; 

? width ( ): 2.5 mm; 

? height ( ): 4.0 mm. 

 

Additionally, it was considered a rigid body attached to the scaffold simulating the 

machine’s clamp (see Figure 4.32). A constant velocity of 0.1667 mm/ms was 

defined for the movement of the rigid block for the compression of the scaffolds. 

This value is 10000 higher than the experimental value (0.00001667 mm/ms). The 

reason for this velocity is related to computational time, as it was not possible to 

undergo the simulations with the real compression velocity.

121
 

The mechanical properties for the rigid body were defined in such a way that the 

rigid body had sufficient strength to perform the scaffold’s compression without 

suffering any kind of deformation. The use of rigid body element is to impose 

deformation on another body tested without suffering deformation. A limit 

dislocation value was also defined for the rigid body. Once it reaches 50 % of the 

scaffold’s height, the compressive simulation is complete as the strain value 

reaches the value of 1. 

 

 

Figure 4.32 – Rigid body for compressive solicitation upon the scaffold. 

 

Scaffolds with three different dimensions of pore sizes were considered (450, 550 

and 650 um). Figure 4.33 illustrates the numerical compressive stress-strain 

behaviours for the different scaffolds. It is possible to observe that as the pore size 

increases, the compressive strengths of the scaffolds decrease.

Figures 4.34 to 4.36 illustrate the obtained numerical stress-strain curves with the 

sigmoid fitted curves, while Figures 4.37 to 4.39 shows the obtained fitted stress-

strain curves with the average experimental stress-strain curves. From the 

obtained curves, it is possible to observe that the densification phenomenon is not 

considered in the numerical calculations, so that the numerical calculations for the 

compressive simulations need to be optimised. From the comparisons of the 

experimental results and the fitted curves, it is possible to observe that the scaffold 

with a pore size of 550 µm presents the most significant deviation, at the end of 

the compression cycle.

Using numerical simulations, it is possible to visualize the compressive testing 

during the calculation time cycle. From these numerical simulations, stress and 

strain plots were obtained at the following time steps of the compressive testing: 

20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 % and 100 %. Figures 4.40, 4.41 and 4.42 illustrate the 

strain behaviour for each scaffold pore size. Figures 4.43, 4.44 and 4.45 illustrate 

the stress behaviour for each scaffold pore size. 

 

Results show that the scaffold with a pore size of 450 µm presents the highest 

densification, presenting the smallest deviation between the numerical and 

experimental stress-strain curves. Regarding the scaffold with a pore size of 550 

µm, since the scaffold’s filaments tend to bulge outwards of the scaffold, which 

results in a structure that presents the lowest densification compared to the other 

scaffolds and the experimental results, that’s why the numerical stress-strain curve 

for the scaffold with a pore size of 550 µm presents the biggest deviation between 

the numerical and experimental stress-strain curves. Regarding the scaffold with a 

pore size of 650 µm, Figures 4.44 and 4.45 illustrate a more balanced 

compression, except in the centre of the scaffold, when compared to the other 

scaffold structures. The three structures tend to bulge outwards when undergoing 

the compressive simulations, the smaller is the bulge phenomenon, the higher is 

the densification, presenting a good agreement between the numerical curves and 

the experimental curves. 

 

In order to optimise the numerical simulations, two aspects need to be addressed. 

One regards the filament’s contact and penetration parameters. The other one 

aspect relates to the mesh elements of the scaffolds. The CAD models present 

100 % symmetry in all three axes, although the obtained meshed body do not 

present 100 % symmetry resulting in an unbalanced bulge phenomenon, during 

the compressive testing. In the case of the meshed elements present 100 % 

symmetry within the meshed body, the densification phenomenon could be more 

significant in all three scaffolds, due to a higher balanced compression process of 

the structures. Nonetheless, due to the complexity of the structures, a mesh with 

100% symmetry is difficult to obtain.

For the crushable foam simulations, the scaffold with a pore size of 450 µm 

presented the best numerical results when compared to the experimental data. In 

order to present a better agreement between the numerical stress-strain curves 

and the experimental ones, the numerical parameters of all three structures need 

to be optimised. Moreover, a symmetric meshed body also needs to be defined.

Chapter 5 – Vascular Analysis of 

Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering 

5. Vascular Analysis 

 

5.1. Vascular Behaviour of Scaffolds in Tissue Engineering 

 

Most tissues in the body rely on blood vessels to supply the individual cells with 

nutrients and oxygen. For a tissue to grow beyond 100-200 µm (the diffusion limit 

of oxygen), new blood-vessel formation is required (Carmeliet and Jain, 2000), 

and this is also true for tissue-engineered constructs. During in vitro culture, larger 

tissue-engineered constructs can be supplied with nutrients, for instance in 

perfusion bioreactors (Janssen et al, 2006; Portner et al, 2005). However, after 

implantation of tissue constructs, the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the implant 

is often limited by diffusion processes that can only supply cells in a proximity of 

100-200 µm from the next capillary. In order for implanted tissues of greater size to 

survive, the tissue has to be vascularised, which means that a capillary network 

capable of delivering nutrients to the cells is formed within the tissue. After 

implantation, blood vessels from the host generally invade the tissue to form such 

a network, in part in response to signals that are secreted by the implanted cells 

as a reaction to hypoxia (Rouwkema et al, 2008). 

 

However, this spontaneous vascular ingrowth is often limited to several tenths of 

micrometres per day (Clark and Clark, 2005), meaning that the time needed for 

complete vascularisation of an implant of several millimetres is in the order of 

weeks. During this time, insufficient vascularisation can lead to nutrient 

deficiencies and/or hypoxia deeper in the tissue. Moreover, nutrient and oxygen 

gradients will be present in the outer regions of the tissue, which could result in 

non-uniform cell differentiation and integration and thus decreased tissue function 

(Malda et al, 2004). 

 



Smart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications 

 

 

136 
 

As an attempt to overcome this issue, Mironov et al (2009) used an additive 

manufacturing technique based on organ printing of tissue spheroids as building 

blocks for the biofabrication of living organs composed of both functional organ 

tissue and an internal branched vascular tree. Closely placed tissue spheroids 

undergo tissue fusion, a process that represents a fundamental biological and 

biophysical principle of developmental biology-inspired directed tissue self-

assembly. It is possible to engineer small segments of an intra-organ branched 

vascular tree by using solid and lumenized vascular tissue spheroids. By using two 

types of spheroids, one for the organ tissue and the other for the vascular tree, 

and with the aid of the tissue fusion process, it is possible to obtain an organ fully 

vascularised. Figure 5.1 represents a roadmap proposed by Mironov et al (2009) 

for the biofabrication of vascularised organs. 

 

Because the speed of vascularisation after implantation is a major problem in 

tissue engineering, the successful use of tissue-engineered constructs is currently 

limited to thin or avascular tissues, such as skin or cartilage, for which post-

implantation neovascularisation from the host is sufficient to meet the demand for 

oxygen and nutrients (Jain et al, 2005). To succeed in the application of tissue 

engineering for bigger tissues, such as bone and muscle, the problem of 

vascularisation has to be solved (Johnson et al, 2007).

5.2. Blood Characteristics 

 

Blood is a specialized bodily fluid composed of a liquid called blood plasma and 

blood cells suspended within the plasma. The blood cells present in blood are red 

blood cells (also called erythrocytes), white blood cells (including both leukocytes 

and lymphocytes) and platelets (also called thrombocytes). Plasma is 

predominantly water containing dissolved proteins, salts and many other 

substances, which amounts up to 55% of blood by volume (Humphrey and 

Delange, 2003). 

 

The most abundant cells in blood are by far red blood cells. These cells contain 

hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein, which facilitates transportation of oxygen 

by reversibly binding to this respiratory gas and greatly increasing its solubility in 

blood. In contrast, carbon dioxide is almost entirely transported extracellularly 

dissolved in plasma as bicarbonate ion. White blood cells help to resist infections 

and parasites, and platelets are important in blood clotting (Humphrey and 

Delange, 2003). 

 

Blood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action 

of the heart. Arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the body tissues and 

venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism produced by 

cells, from the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled. One aspect that must always be 

taken into account is that blood properties vary with factors such as age, gender, 

race and health. All these make it impossible to define a specific value for a certain 

blood property, for instance its density (Humphrey and Delange, 2003). 

 

Blood pressure refers to the force exerted by circulating blood within the walls of 

blood vessels. The pressure of the circulating blood decreases as blood moves 

through arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and veins. Usually, blood pressure refers to 

arterial pressure, i.e., the pressure in the larger arteries, where arteries are the 

blood vessels taking blood away from the heart. Arterial pressure is most

commonly measured via a sphygmomanometer, which uses the height of a 

column of mercury to determine the circulating pressure. Although many modern 

vascular pressure devices no longer use mercury, vascular pressure values are 

still universally reported in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) (Humphrey and 

Delange, 2003). 

 

The systolic arterial pressure is defined as the peak pressure in the arteries, which 

occurs near the beginning of the cardiac cycle, while the diastolic arterial pressure 

is the lowest pressure at the resting phase of the cardiac cycle. The average 

pressure throughout the cardiac cycle is a mean arterial pressure, while the pulse 

pressure reflects the difference between the maximum and minimum pressures 

measured (Humphrey and Delange, 2003). 

 

Typical values for a resting, healthy adult human are approximately 120 mmHg (16 

kPa) systolic and 80 mmHg (11 kPa) diastolic with large individual variations. 

These measures of arterial pressure are not static, but undergo natural variations 

from one heartbeat to another, as well throughout the day in a circadian rhythm. 

They also change in response to stress, nutritional factors, drugs, or disease. 

Hypertension refers to arterial pressure being abnormally high, as opposed to 

hypotension, when it is abnormally low. Blood pressure measurements are the 

most commonly measured physiological parameters along with body temperature 

(Humphrey and Delange, 2003).

5.3. Constitutive Equation of Blood Flow 

 

Blood is not a homogeneous medium mainly consisting of plasma and a 

suspension of red blood cells. White cells, or leukocytes, and platelets present in 

smaller concentrations, play an important role in biochemical processes, like 

immune response, inflammation, and coagulation (Humphrey and Delange, 2003). 

Whole blood has a pseudoplastic flow behaviour (Figure 5.2), characterized by a 

viscosity (resistance to flow) that is lower at higher shear rates than at lower shear 

rates. A pseudoplastic behaviour is also called shear thinning, mainly due to 

particles within the fluid aggregating at low shear rates but "breaking" at higher 

shear rates, which lowers the viscosity (Humphrey and Delange, 2003). Red blood 

cells tend to aggregate at lower shear rates, a phenomenon known as rouleaux 

(Figure 5.3), which depends on the presence of fibrinogen and globulins 

(Humphrey and Delange, 2003). In the limit, as the shear rate goes to zero, the 

blood will tend to further aggregate, eventually leading to a process known as 

clotting, which involves additional mechanisms, including platelet activation and 

the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, an essential component of a clot. As the 

shear rate increases from low, but nonzero values, the rouleaux break up and 

blood behaves like a Newtonian fluid. The latter is often assumed in large arteries 

with a viscosity ?  ~ constant (often cited to be ~ 3.5 cP, or centiPoise) and the 

Navier–Poisson equations to describe most blood flows. Plasma (whole blood 

minus cells) always behaves as a Newtonian fluid, with a viscosity ?  ~ 1.2cP 

(Humphrey and Delange, 2003). In capillaries, which are ~ 5–8 ? m in diameter, 

the red blood cells go through one at a time, with plasma in between. In this case, 

the blood should be treated as a two-phase flow – a solid and a fluid mixture 

(Humphrey and Delange, 2003).

5.4. Scaffold Vascularisation 

 

The architecture and design of a scaffold has a profound effect on the rate of 

vascularisation after implantation (Almeida and Bártolo, 2008; 2007). First, the 

pore size of the scaffold is a critical determinant of blood-vessel ingrowth. Druecke 

et al (2004) showed that vessel ingrowth was significantly faster in scaffolds with 

pores greater than 250 µm than in those with smaller pores. However, it is not only 

the pore size that is important for vascularisation: the interconnectivity of the pores 

is also significant because cell migration, and thus vascularisation, will be inhibited 

if pores are not interconnected, even if the scaffold porosity is high (Laschke et al, 

2006; Karageorgiou and Kaplan, 2005; Yang et al, 2001). 

 

The flow of the biological medium through the scaffold is necessary to provide the 

cells with nutrients and oxygen and flush out the metabolic products (Vossenberg 

et al, 2009). The success of cell attachment to the scaffold depends on the flow 

regime. High flows cause high shear stress (Martin and Vermette, 2005) and 

prevent attachment of cells to the scaffold surface, already attached cells may be 

damaged or hindered in proliferation. Shear stress is also considered as an 

important parameter for in vivo systems. Wang and Tarbell (2000) found by 

experiments for smooth-muscle cells that with increasing shear stress the 

production of prostaglandins increased. The results of Wang and Tarbell (2000) 

indicate that the blood flow rate plays an important role in the signal 

communication system from the blood vessels to the smooth muscle cells. 

 

When designing a scaffold, the shear stress that acts on the fibres of the scaffold 

on which the cells grow must therefore be considered as a design parameter. 

Shear stress is proportional to the velocity gradient and is a function of design 

parameters such as fibre diameter and distance between the fibre centres and 

operational variables such as fluid velocity (Vossenberg et al, 2009).

For in vitro cultures such as in bioreactors, the cells are subjected to a continuous 

fluid flow of nutrients. It has been proven that the fluid flow induces a stress upon 

the cells that are attached to the walls of the scaffolds, namely the wall shear 

stress. Higher values of wall shear stress decrease the cell’s ability to attach to the 

wall of the scaffold, or eventually it also removes the attached cells and may kill 

them when the values are too high. Lower values also don’t offer the necessary 

stimuli that the cells need for a healthy proliferation and/or differentiation. In other 

words, each cell type has its appropriate shear stress value. In the following table, 

shear stresses regarding optimum, critical and death values for several cell types 

are presented. Table 5.1 presents several Shear Stress values that are optimum, 

natural or even lethal for cell cultures within bioreactors.

5.5. Vascular Simulation 

 

The main goal for simulating the scaffold vascular behaviour is to evaluate the 

porosity dependence on both Wall Shear Stress and Shear Stress Rates on the 

surface of the scaffold. These two parameters are the most critical due to the fact 

that they contribute to the cell’s performance regarding their proliferation and 

differentiation along the scaffold structure internally and externally. 

 

If the scaffold is hosted within a biofluid rich environment, the first step is to obtain 

the geometric representation the existing biofluid, in other words, the empty space 

within the scaffold unit (Figure 5.4). Figure 5.5 illustrates the unfilled volumes of 

the scaffold units, which represents the biofluid volume.

Flow simulation enables to study biofluid mass flow, pressure and fluid velocity for 

different scaffold topologies. For simulation purposes, it was considered for the 

biofluid a density of 1080 kg/m3 and a dynamic viscosity of 0.0035 Pa s. The inlet 

and outlet values correspond to a blood pressure flow of 100 mm Hg. The inlet 

and outlet of the biofluid flow within a scaffold is illustrated in Figure 5.6.

5.6. Vascular Results and Discussion 

 

(a) Non-Triple Periodic Minimal Surfaces 

 

Figure 5.7 and 5.8 illustrate the variation of the Shear Strain Rate and Wall Shear 

Stress with the increase of the pore size of the scaffold. For both parameters, the 

scaffolds with “CF” present a sinusoidal behaviour with the increase of the pore 

size of the scaffold, maintaining its average value constant. Regarding the Shear 

Strain Rate, as the pore size increases, the Shear Strain Rate increases initially 

and then decreases (“4F” pores), decreases and then begins to increase (“12F” 

pores), while the “8F” pores also present a sinusoidal behaviour with a higher 

amplitude and higher values compared with the Circular Pores. Regarding the 

Wall Shear Stress, both the “4F” and “12F” pores present an almost linear 

decreasing behaviour, having the “12F” pores higher values of Wall Shear Stress. 

The “8F” pores presents a sinusoidal behaviour with both less amplitude and value 

of Wall Shear Stress compared to the “CF” pores.

Figures 5.9 and 5.10 illustrate a micro-scale analysis of the Shear Strain Rate and 

Wall Shear Stress for the regular geometric scaffolds with the increase of pore 

size. On a micro-scale level, all 4 pore types have a similar behaviour regarding 

the Shear Strain Rate and Wall Shear Stress. Figure 5.9 illustrates the variation of 

the Shear Strain Rate for scaffolds with “8F” pores. Regarding this issue, no 

particular superficial variation is observed, only that the higher values of Shear 

Strain Rate are located on the exterior of the scaffold. The lower values are 

verified in its interior. For the Wall Shear Stress for scaffolds with “4F”, the 

difference in values between the interior and exterior of the scaffold are more 

significant (Figure 5.10). In other words, the cells located on the exterior surface of 

the scaffold have a higher mechanobiological stimulation compared to the cells in 

the interior of the scaffold. This will result in a low cell proliferation and 

differentiation inside the scaffold due to the lack of stimulation.

The scaffold structures that were used for the Crushable Foam Simulations were 

also subjected to vascular simulations. Bearing in mind, that only three geometries 

were analysed, the present data isn’t enough to present a behaviour curve of the 

Shear Strain Rate and Wall Shear Stress as a function of pore size. Therefore only 

a micro analysis was performed on the superficial behaviour of the scaffolds. 

Similarly to the n faces per pore scaffolds, the Shear Strain Rate and Wall Shear 

Stress aren’t homogenous throughout the scaffold, presenting higher values on 

the outer regions of the scaffold compared to the interior regions. 

 

Regarding the pore size variation, the results demonstrate that as the pore size 

increases, lower is the difference in value for the Shear Strain rate and the Wall 

Shear Stress between the outer and inner regions of the scaffold due to the 

decrease in difficulty of the fluid flow to the interior of the scaffold. In this case, for 

the 0/90º lay-down scaffolds, as the pore size increases, so does the vascular 

behaviour of the scaffolds in spite of the decrease in mechanical performance, 

improving the balance between the interior and exterior cellular stimulations. 

Figure 5.11 illustrates the variation of the Shear Strain Rate as the pore size 

increases from 450 µm to 550 µm to 650 µm. Figure 5.12 illustrates the variation 

of the Wall Shear Stress as the pore size increases from 450 µm to 550 µm to 650 

µm.

(b) Triple Periodic Minimal Surfaces 

 

Figures 5.13 and 5.14 illustrate the variation of the Shear Strain Rate variation of 

the Schoen geometry. Figure 5.13 illustrates the variation of the Shear Strain Rate 

due to the increase of thickness while Figure 5.14 illustrates the variation of the 

Shear Strain Rate due to the increase of radius. From the figures, it is possible to 

verify that the Shear Strain Rate decreases with the geometries’ thickness and 

increases with the radius. In this case, it is possible to conclude that the increase 

of thickness lowers the Shear Strain Rate, resulting in a higher probability of 

occurring the rouleaux phenomenon. Regarding the radius variation, the 

probability of occurring the rouleaux phenomenon decreases with the increase of 

radius. The Schwartz geometries have a similar behaviour for the Shear Strain 

Rate. In conclusion, the best geometric option is to work with lower thicknesses 

and higher radius values.

geometry. From the figures illustrated below, it is possible to verify that the Wall 

Shear Stress increases for the Schwartz geometry and decreases for the Schoen 

geometries. The geometric variation regarding the radius variation has a similar 

behaviour for the Wall Shear Stress. In conclusion, once the cell’s shear stress is 

known, it is possible to design the scaffolds with the ideal value so that neither do 

the cells lack the adequate stimuli or are harmed due to the values being to high.

A micro-scale analysis of both geometries was also performed for the vascular 

simulations. Figures 5.17 and 5.18 illustrate the variation of the Shear Strain Rate 

variation of the Schoen geometry. Figure 5.17 illustrates the variation of the Shear 

Strain Rate due to the increase of thickness and Figure 5.18 illustrates the 

variation due to the increase of radius. Both figures illustrate that both geometries 

present a more homogenous Shear Strain Rate variation with lower values. 

 

Figures 5.19 and 5.20 illustrate the variation of the Wall Shear Stress in function of 

the thickness variation of the Schwartz and Schoen geometry respectively. 

Regarding the Wall Shear Stress, the Schoen geometries present a more 

homogenous variation with lower thickness values, for both interior and exterior 

regions of the scaffold. The most significant variation is presented with the 

thickness variation of the Schwartz geometries. The Wall Shear Stress increases 

with the increase of thickness maintaining a homogenous distribution on the 

exterior region of the scaffold. Regarding the interior region of the scaffold, it tends 

to decrease with a homogenous distribution.

(c) Summary 

 

The vascular simulation results demonstrate that the Triple periodic minimal 

surfaces present higher vascular properties when compared to the Non-triple 

periodic surfaces. Results of both geometries show that the Shear Strain Rate 

decreases with the geometries’ thickness and increases with the radius. 

Regarding the Wall Shear Stress, it increases for the Schwartz geometry and 

decreases for the Schoen geometries as the geometries’ thickness increases. The 

geometric variation regarding the radius variation has a similar behaviour for the 

Wall Shear Stress. Results of the variation of the Shear Strain Stress on the 

scaffold’s surface show that both geometries present a more homogenous 

variation with lower geometric values. Regarding the Wall Shear Stress, the 

Schoen geometries present a more homogenous variation with lower thickness 

values. The most significant variation is presented with the thickness variation of 

the Schwartz geometries. The Wall Shear Stress increases with the increase of 

thickness maintaining a homogenous distribution on the scaffold.

Chapter 6 – Topological Optimisation of 

Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering 

6. Topological Optimisation 

 

6.1. Design Optimisation of Scaffolds in Tissue Engineering 

 

The classical problem in engineering design consists in finding the optimum 

geometric configuration of a structure that maximizes a given cost objective 

function with boundary conditions and constraints. Structural optimisation can be 

classified as follows (Lee, 2007; Hsu and Hsu, 2005): 

 

? Size optimisation; 

? Shape optimisation; 

? Topology optimisation. 

 

In size optimisation (Figure 6.1.b), only the cross section of a structure is 

optimised. A typical size feature of a given structure, such as the thickness of a 

beam, is either increased or decreased in order to improve its performance. In 

shape optimisation (Figure 6.1.c), the shape of the structure is obtained by 

changing the shape of the used components with other components of different 

shape, in order to improve a desired variable within a system. In topology 

optimisation (Figure 6.1.d), the shape and connectivity of the domain are both 

design variables.

164 
 

 

Figure 6.1 – Types of engineering optimisations: a) original part b) part after size optimisation c) 

part after shape optimisation and d) part after topological optimisation. 

 

Topology optimisation provides the first design concept of the structure’s materials 

distribution. Its goal is to minimise the structure compliance while satisfying the 

constraints of volume removal. As the structure compliance is twice the strain 

energy, the objective function of minimising structure compliance is equivalent to 

minimising strain energy (Kruijf et al, 2007; Rozvany, 2001). 

 

In spite of several attempts to define optimised scaffolds (Podshivalov et al, 2009; 

2008; Holdstein and Fischer, 2008; Wettergeen et al, 2008; 2005a; 2005b), there 

is no work correlating both porosity and mechanical properties with topological 

information. As described in Chapter 2, scaffolds must be highly porous structures 

but also effective from a mechanical point of view. This is a complex issue, 

fundamental for tissue engineering applications and not yet fully addressed. This 

chapter proposes an optimised strategy to obtain scaffolds with an appropriate 

topology maximizing both porosity and mechanical behaviour. The methodology 

proposed in this chapter is of simple implementation and does not require high 

computational calculation time.

6.2. Topological Optimisation 

 

Topological optimisation, aiming to find the best use of material according to a 

“maximum-stiffness” design, requires neither parameters nor the explicit definition 

of optimisation variables. The objective function is predefined, as are the state 

variables (constrained dependent variables), and the design variables 

(independent variables to be optimised). The topological optimisation problem 

requires the problem definition (material properties, model and loads), the 

objective function (the function to be minimized or maximized), and the state 

variables corresponding to the percentage of material to be removed (Neches and 

Cisilino, 2008; Ansola et al, 2007; Kruijf et al, 2007; Hsu and Hsu, 2005; Bendsøe 

and Sigmund, 2003; Rozvany, 2001; Bendsøe, 1989; Bendsøe and Kikuchi, 

1988). 

 

From a mechanical point of view, the goal of topological optimisation is to minimise 

the total compliance, which is proportional to the strain energy. Figure 6.2 

illustrates the general topology optimisation scheme considered in this work.

The design variables are internal, pseudo-densities that are assigned to each finite 

element in the topological problem. The pseudo-density for each element varies 

from 0 to 1, where 0?i?  represents material to be removed, and 1?i?  represents 

material that should be (Figure 6.3).

The domain ?  is represented as a collection of a finite number of subdomains. This 
is called discretisation of the domain. Each subdomain is called an element and the 

collection of elements is called the finite element mesh. In this case, ? ?x?  was 
discretised by assigning a constant value on each element of the finite element 

model, establishing a suitable piecewise constant function ? ?x*?  to approximate ? ?x?
.

6.3. Topological Results and Discussion 

 

Two different analyses were carried out: 

 

? Topological optimisation of an initial solid block under different constraints; 

? Topological optimisation of an initial solid block with loading and constraint 

surfaces defined based on geometrical information obtained from real 

biological tissues (Bio-surface constrained optimisation of a solid block 

element). 

 

Each block was assumed to be made of PCL (elastic modulus of 400 MPa and 

Poisson’s ratio of 0.33). The optimisation scheme described in the previous 

sections was implemented using the finite element software Ansys. A total number 

100 iterations for each calculation was considered and the convergence tolerance 

parameter for each calculation was assumed to be 1E-4. 

 

(a) Topological optimisation of an initial solid block 

 

A solid cubic block with 5 mm of size was considered. A mesh of 15625 cubic solid 

elements of 0.2 mm of size was used to model the block (Figure 6.4). The 

optimisation goal is to obtain the best material distribution within the geometric 

space that corresponds to the solid block, maximizing the mechanical behaviour of 

the construct based on an imposed porosity value. Different levels of porosity were 

considered (10 % to 90 % with increments of 10). The block element was 

assumed to have a linear elastic behaviour, so strain values of 0.1 were simulated 

by imposing a corresponding displacement according to the strain direction 

considered.

Figure 6.4 – Illustration of the Meshed model of the scaffold. 

 

Based on the strain locations, different optimisation scenarios were considered as 

follows (Figure 6.5): 

 

? Scenario 1: all the edges of the block were constrained (no displacements 

or rotations in the X, Y, Z plane) and the block faces were submitted to 

strains in all directions (?xx, ?yy, ?zz). 

? Scenario 2: all the edges of the block were constrained (no displacements 

or rotations in the X, Y, Z plane) and the faces were submitted to strains in 

two directions (?xx, ?yy), (?xx, ?zz), (?yy, ?zz). 

? Scenario 3: all the edges of the block were constrained (no displacements 

or rotations in the X, Y, Z plane) and the faces were submitted to a strain in 

one direction (?xx, ?yy or ?zz). 

? Scenario 4: all the vertices of the block were constrained (no displacements 

or rotations in the X, Y, Z plane) and the faces were submitted to strains in 

all directions (?xx, ?yy, ?zz). 

? Scenario 5: all the vertices of the block were constrained (no displacements 

or rotations in the X, Y, Z plane) and the faces were submitted to strains in 

two directions (?xx, ?yy), (?xx, ?zz), (?yy, ?zz).

? Scenario 6: all the vertices of the block were constrained (no displacements 

or rotations in the X, Y, Z plane) and the faces were submitted to a strain in 

one direction (?xx, ?yy or ?zz). 

? Scenario 7: all the vertices of the block were constrained (no displacements 

or rotations in the X, Y, Z plane) and the edges were submitted to strains in 

all directions (?xx, ?yy, ?zz). 

? Scenario 8: all the vertices of the block were constrained (no displacements 

or rotations in the X, Y, Z plane) and the edges were submitted to strains in 

two directions (?xx, ?yy), (?xx, ?zz), (?yy, ?zz). 

? Scenario 9: all the vertices of the block were constrained (no displacements 

or rotations in the X, Y, Z plane) and the edges were submitted to a strain in 

one direction (?xx, ?yy or ?zz). 

? Scenario 10: faces were submitted to strains in a single direction (?xx, ?yy or 

?zz) and the remaining faces were constrained. 

? Scenario 11: faces were submitted to strains in two directions (?xx, ?yy), (?xx, 

?zz), (?yy, ?zz) and the remaining faces were constrained. 

? Scenario 12: edges were submitted to strains in a single direction (?xx, ?yy or 

?zz) and the remaining edges were constrained. 

? Scenario 13: edges were submitted to strains in two directions (?xx, ?yy), 

(?xx, ?zz), (?yy, ?zz) and the remaining edges were constrained.

Figures 6.6 and 6.7 illustrate the solution for scenarios 2 and 3. Both scenarios 

only present 2 valid topological solutions for 80 % and 90 % porosity. By 

comparing both, the first scenario presents higher biological performance due to 

its interconnectivity in 2 directions instead of just 1 in the second scenario. 

 

Figures 6.9 and 6.10 illustrate the results for scenarios 9 and 12. These 2 

scenarios present 4 valid topological solutions for 60 %, 70 %, 80 % and 90 % of 

porosity. In this case, scenario 12 presents the best results due to the fact that all 

4 solutions present pore interconnectivity in all 3 directions, when compared to 

scenario 9 which only 3 present pore interconnectivity in all directions. 

 

Figure 6.8 presents 5 valid topological solutions for scenario 8, ranging from 50 % 

to 90 % in porosity. All 5 solutions present pore interconnectivity in all 3 directions. 

 

The scenario 13 is the scenario that presents the highest number valid topological 

solutions (Figure 6.11). In this case, all solutions present pore interconnectivity in 

all 3 directions ranging from 30 % to 90 %. 

 

From the results, it is possible to conclude that the best given topological 

optimised scenario is the 6th, which corresponds to the scenario with constraints 

on the edges in 1 direction and the displacements on the edges but in 2 directions.

(b) Bio-surface constrained optimisation of a solid block element 

 

This approach is based on µCT data of real biological tissues to create the loading 

and constraint surfaces of the scaffold during the topological optimisation process. 

Contrary to the previous case, where all faces of a block were considered as 

admissible loading and constraint surfaces, in this approach only specific regions 

are considered. The goal of this approach is to obtain biomimetic optimised 

elements. In order to perform this kind of optimisation, a trabecular bone region 

was considered. The corresponding STL model is shown in Figure 6.12.a. The 

STL file model obtained from the µCT data was analysed and non-valid triangles 

were removed and errors (overlapping, degenerated triangles, etc.) corrected 

(Figure 6.12.b). Once analysed and corrected, datum plane boundaries were 

created in order to define the scaffold element boundary space (Figure 6.13). The 

following step involves the intersection between the datum planes and the STL 

model to define the loading and constraint curves (Figure 6.14) to define the 

surfaces for optimisation (Figure 6.15). The scaffold block element considered 

indicated in Figure 6.16.

The porosity of the original µCT model within the STL file is 84 %, this was also 

the considered value for simulation purposes. The block element was assumed to 

have a linear elastic behaviour, so strain values of 0.1 were simulated by imposing 

a corresponding displacement according to the strain direction considered (0.2 

mm along both X and Y directions, and 0.184 along the Z direction). A mesh of 

98535 solid tetrahedral elements was considered (Figure 6.17).

The following scenarios were considered (Figures 6.18 and 6.19): 

 

? Scenario 1: specific regions of the block faces were submitted to strains in a 

single direction ?xx and the remaining specific regions were constrained. 

? Scenario 2: specific regions of the block faces were submitted to strains in a 

single direction ?yy and the remaining specific regions were constrained. 

? Scenario 3: specific regions of the block faces were submitted to strains in a 

single direction ?zz and the remaining specific regions were constrained. 

? Scenario 4: specific regions of the block faces were submitted to strains in a

? Scenario 5: specific regions of the block faces were submitted to strains in a 

two directions (?xx, ?zz) and the remaining specific regions were constrained.

Blue regions are constraint. The Gray regions are free of either loading or 

constraint conditions.

After performing the six topological optimisation scenarios for the given objective 

function of 84 % porosity, the following results were obtained. Figures 6.20 and 

6.21 illustrate the topological results for each case study. Figure 6.20 illustrate the 

results according to the variation of the solicitations in each direction, maintaining 

the other two directions constrained. Figure 6.21 illustrates the results according to 

the variation of the constraints in each direction, maintaining the other two 

directions under displacement. 

 

These results permit to conclude that this approach enables to produce more 

biomimetic topologies. The initial external topology of the µCT data, which 

corresponds to a structure of a well-defined mechanical behaviour and porosity 

level is the starting point of an optimisation scheme that enables us to obtain, 

based on a biomimetic external surfaces, constructs with different levels of 

porosity and mechanical properties according to the required applications. The 

goal is not to obtain similar structures as the starting model by instead to use the 

starting configuration to produce novel models with different characteristics.

Chapter 7 – Conclusions and Future 

Works 

7. Conclusions 

 

7.1. Concluding Remarks 

 

Scaffolds are critical elements for tissue engineering applications, as they provide 

the necessary support for tissue regeneration in an organised way. As described 

in Chapter 1, scaffolds should be biocompatible, biodegradable, with appropriate 

porosity, pore structure and pore distribution, on top of presenting both surface 

and structural compatibility. These characteristics are usually difficult to achieve, 

i.e., it is quite difficult to design a construct with both high porosity (a critical 

property for vascularisation purposes) and high mechanical properties. 

 

Design strategies to produce optimized scaffolds represent a critical topic of 

research in the field of tissue engineering. This is an emergent domain covered by 

this research study. 

 

The state-of-the-art in tissue engineering, biofabrication and scaffold design, 

based on numerical simulations to determine optimum scaffold design parameters, 

is fully addressed. The knowledge gathered through this literature review 

(Chapters 1, 2 and 3) was fundamental to develop a computational strategy for 

Computer Aided Design of Scaffolds based on CAD data, the mechanical models, 

and the finite element method, in order to investigate the following issues: the 

mechanical behaviour (Chapter 4), the vascular behaviour (Chapter 5) and to 

optimise the scaffold’s topology (Chapter 6). 

 

Scaffolds can be considered as a LEGO structure formed by an association of 

small elementary units or blocks. Two families of elementary scaffold units were 

considered: i) Non-triple periodic minimal surfaces, and ii) Triple periodic minimal

196 
 

surfaces (Schwartz and Schoen surfaces). Both families of scaffold topologies 

were evaluated as a function of porosity, in terms of mechanical and vascular 

performance. Additionally, all families were experimentally validated from a 

manufacturing view. The use of these different scaffold families enables the 

fabrication of fully interconnected scaffolds through additive biofabrication 

techniques. Non-triple periodic minimal surfaces were evaluated in terms of pore 

topology and pore distribution, while the Triple periodic minimal surfaces were 

evaluated in terms of two geometric design parameters (radius and thickness 

values). 

 

From a mechanical point of view, it is possible to observe that: 

 

? By increasing the porosity, the mechanical properties decrease in a non-

linear way. 

? The influence of the number of pores per face, on the mechanical 

properties of Non-triple periodic minimal surfaces, was also determined. For 

a given level of porosity, by increasing the number of pores per face, the 

mechanical properties increase in a non-linear way. 

? The relationship between porosity and mechanical properties depends on 

the architecture of the pore. Non-triple periodic minimal surfaces that 

present better behaviour are the scaffolds with “CF” pores below a critical 

value of 50 % porosity, and the scaffolds with “4F” pores above 50 % 

porosity. On the other way, the Triple periodic minimal surface scaffolds 

presenting the best results are the ones obtained with the Schwartz 

surfaces. These surfaces, for the same level of porosity and different radius 

values, enable to produce structures either with high mechanical behaviour 

or low mechanical behaviour. 

? A relationship between the geometric parameters (radius and thickness) of 

Triple periodic minimal surfaces and its mechanical properties was obtained 

on a macro-scale level. For both Schwartz and Schoen surfaces, the 

mechanical properties improve with the increase in its thickness in a non-

linear way. Regarding the radius variation for the Schoen surfaces the 



Smart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications

 

 

197
 

mechanical properties decrease in a non-linear way as the radius 

increases. 

? On a micro-scale level, for both Schwartz and Schoen surfaces, the scaffold 

structures present a more homogenous tensile distribution for lower 

thickness values. Regarding the radius variation for Schwartz surfaces, 

there is no significant tensile stress variation with an increase of radius, 

while Schoen geometries present a more homogenous tensile distribution 

for lower radius values. 

? On another level, the Von Misses tensile stresses and the normal xx?  

stress variation, according to the node’s geometric “X” position in the 

Schoen surface, was determined. Results show that both tensile stresses 

are similar, which means that the other tensile or shear stresses are less 

significant. It is also possible to observe that the geometric transition, from 

the corner channel to the central sphere, is characterized by a decrease on 

the average tensile stresses. 

? In order to validate the proposed mechanical simulations, a comparison 

between numerical and experimental data was performed. In this case, a 

crushable foam behaviour was adopted for the numerical simulations. This 

comparison was undertaken for three pore sizes (450 µm, 550 µm and 650 

µm). Results demonstrate that the scaffold with a pore size of 450 µm 

presents the best numerical results when compared to the experimental 

compressive data. The plots from the numerical simulations illustrate that 

an unbalanced meshed body results in an unbalanced bulging 

phenomenon, which influences the densification process. This phenomenon 

can justify the deviations verified between the numerical stress-strain 

curves and the experimental ones. In order to obtain a better agreement 

between the numerical stress-strain curves and the experimental ones, the 

numerical parameters of all three structures need to be optimised and a 

symmetric meshed body needs to be defined.

Two critical parameters were considered in the vascular simulations for both 

scaffold families, the Shear Stress Rate and the Wall Shear Stress. From the 

results, it is possible to observe that: 

 

? For Non-triple periodic minimal surfaces, on a macro-scale level, both 

parameters present a sinusoidal behaviour with the increase of the pore 

size, maintaining its average value constant. 

? For Non-triple periodic minimal surfaces, on a micro-scale level, both 

parameters present a similar behaviour with the increase in pore size, being 

more significant for the Wall Shear Stress. With the increase in the pore 

size, both structures present a more homogenous distribution of values with 

smaller deviations between the highest and lowest values. It is also 

possible to observe that higher values are located on the exterior of the 

scaffold and lower values in its interior. 

? For the scaffold structures with pore sizes of 450 µm, 550 µm and 650 µm, 

both parameters present a similar behaviour. Results demonstrate that as 

the pore size increases, the difference is lower in value for the Shear Strain 

rate, and the Wall Shear Stress between the outer and inner regions of the 

scaffold, due to the decrease in the difficulty of the fluid to flow to the 

interior of the scaffold. 

? For the Shear Strain Rate of Triple periodic minimal surfaces, it is possible 

to observe that the Shear Strain Rate decreases with the geometries’ 

thickness and increases with the radius, for the Schoen surfaces. The 

Schwartz geometries have a similar behaviour for the Shear Strain Rate. In 

conclusion, the best geometric option is the scaffold with lower thickness 

and higher radius values. 

? For the Wall Shear Stress of Triple periodic minimal surfaces, it is possible 

to observe that the Wall Shear Stress increases for the Schwartz geometry 

and decreases for the Schoen geometries, with the increase in thickness. 

The geometric variation regarding the radius variation has a similar 

behaviour compared to the thickness. 



Smart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications

 

 

199
 

? Regarding the Wall Shear Stress of Triple periodic minimal surfaces on a 

micro-scale, the Schoen geometries present a more homogenous variation 

with lower thickness values, for both interior and exterior regions of the 

scaffold. The most significant variation is presented with the thickness 

variation of the Schwartz geometries, so the Wall Shear Stress increases 

with the increase of thickness maintaining a homogenous distribution on the 

exterior region of the scaffold. Regarding the interior region of the scaffold, 

it tends to decrease with a homogenous distribution. 

 

Regarding the topological optimizations, two types of analysis were carried out: 

 

? The topological optimisation of an initial solid block element: 

In this analysis, several scenarios were considered, combining 

loading and constraint conditions on vertices, edges and faces. In 

this case, two types of design models were obtained, invalid and 

valid scaffold models. Design models that present a shell structure or 

non-interconnected designs are considered invalid scaffold models, 

while design models that present interconnectivity in 1, 2 or 3 

directions are considered valid scaffold models. 

From the results, it is possible to conclude that the best topological 

scenario corresponds to a scenario with constraints on the edges in 1 

direction and displacements on the edges in the other 2 directions, 

obtaining 7 valid scaffold design models with interconnectivity in all 3 

directions. 

 

? The bio-surface constrained optimisation of a solid block element: 

The initial external topology of the µCT data, which corresponds to a 

structure of a well-defined mechanical behaviour and porosity level, 

is the starting point of an optimisation scheme that enables to obtain 

constructs with different levels of porosity and mechanical properties, 

according to the required applications, based on biomimetic external

This particular topological optimisation scheme uses the surface 

boundaries to produce novel models with different characteristics, 

which are different from the initial µCT models. This approach 

enables to produce valid biomimetic scaffold topologies for tissue 

engineering applications. 

 

7.2. Future Works 

 

Possible future directions for research following on this thesis can be undertaken 

in two main areas, namely numerical and experimental. 

 

The numerical work that needs further investigation: 

 

? Including viscoelastic behaviour models in the numerical simulations; 

? Introducing degradation models in both the mechanical and vascular 

simulations; 

? Combining both mechanical and vascular simulations in order to obtain a 

more complete understanding of tissue engineering scaffolds for specific 

domains, such as in perfusion bioreactors; 

? Including cellular proliferation and behaviour models allowing numerical 

simulations of both cells and constructs. In this case, the degradation effect 

upon the polymeric and/or ceramic scaffolds should be considered. 

 

The experimental work to be carried out: 

 

? Validate the vascular simulations undertaken in this research work; 

? Undergoing combined experimental mechanical and vascular stimulations 

upon the scaffolds in order to validate the numerical simulations; 

? Develop cellular proliferation and behaviour models to be used in numerical 

simulations.

During this work, new research directions started to be explored and implemented 

at Centre for Rapid and Sustainable Product Development, with support of the 

Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), the Portuguese 

Agency for Innovation (ADI), the Ciencia Y Tecnologia Para El Desarrollo 

(CYTED) and the Marie Curie European Projects (FP7), as stated before. These 

projects are based in the deep understanding achieved during this thesis. 

 

Several questions have been answered through this thesis, but several others 

have been proposed and must be solved in the future by further research studies. 

In other words, a PhD thesis is just another step in one’s academic life in order to 

continue undergoing research and investigation at a different level.
