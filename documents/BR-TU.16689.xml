ABSTRACT 

 

Inter-specific associations of birds are complex social phenomena, frequently detected and often 

stable over time and space. So far, the social structure of these associations has been largely deduced 

from subjective assessments in the field or by counting the number of inter-specific encounters at the 

whole-group level, without considering changes to individual pairwise interactions. Here, we look 

for evidence of non-random association between pairs of bird species, delimit groups of more 

strongly associated species and examine differences in social structure between old growth and 

secondary forest habitat. We used records of bird species detection from mist-netting capture and 

from acoustic recordings to identify pairwise associations that were detected more frequently than 

expected under a null distribution, and compared the strength of these associations between old-

growth and secondary forest Amazonian tropical forest. We also used the pairwise strength 

associations to visualize the social network structure and its changes between habitat types. We 

found many strongly positive interactions between species, but no evidence of repulsion. Network 

analyses revealed several modules of species that broadly agree with the subjective groupings 

described in the ornithological literature. Furthermore, both network structure and association 

strength changed drastically with habitat disturbance, with the formation of a few new associations 

but a general trend towards the breaking of associations between species. Our results show that social 

grouping in birds is real and may be strongly affected by habitat degradation, suggesting that the 

stability of the associations is threatened by anthropogenic disturbance.  

 

Key words: Mixed-species flocks, tropical forest birds, inter-specific interaction, null models, 

networks, pairwise co-detection

Encontra interespecífica não aleatória entre aves de sub-bosque amazônico: qual elas são e como elas 

mudam?   

Resumo 
Os bandos mistos de aves são agregações sociais complexas estáveis durante o tempo e espaço. Até 

hoje, a estrutura social dessas espécies foi descrita a partir de estudos subjetivos de campo ou a partir 

de compilações do número e intensidade das interações a nível de todo o grupo, sem considerar as 

interações par-a-par individualmente. Nossos objetivos foram buscar evidências de associações não-

randômicas entre pares de espécies de aves, delimitar os grupos a partir das espécies com as 

associações mais fortes e verificar se há diferenças na estrutura social entre os habitat de floresta 

primária e secundária. Utilizamos dados de ocorrência das espécies coletados a partir de redes de 

neblina e gravação de vocalizações para identificar pares de espécies que foram co-detectadas mais 

frequentemente do que o esperado a partir do modelo nulo e compararamos a força dessa interação 

entre as florestas tropicais primária e secundária Amazônicas. Nós também utilizamos as associações 

par-a-par para construir as redes de interação social e suas mudanças entre os tipos de habitat. Nós 

encontramos muitas interações positivas fortes entre as espécies, mas nenhuma evidência de 

repulsão. As análises das redes de interação revelaram vários grupos de espécies que corroboram 

com grupos ecológios descritos na literatura. Além disso, tanto a estrutura da rede de interação como 

a força da interação se alteraram drasticamente com a perturbação do habitat, com formação de 

algumas associações novas, mas uma tendência geral para quebra de associações entre as espécies. 

Nossos resultados mostram que as interações sociais entre essas aves podem ser fortemente afetados 

pela degradação do habitat, sugerindo que a estabilidade das interações desenvolvida entre espécies é 

ameaçada pelos distúrbios causados pelo homem.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

Group living in animals can be composed by one species, e.g. a flock of starling (Morse 1977), so 

they are conspecific groups. Living in groups provides several benefits to individual participants 

such as reducing predation risk (e.g. Cresswell and Quinn 2004). However, being with conspecifics 

may be costly, as it can increase resource competition and the risk of exposure to disease and 

parasites (e.g. Altizier et al 2003).  

Joining mixed-species flocks would be an efficient strategy to reduce competition while keeping 

anti-predation benefits (Morse 1977, Sridhar et al 2009, Harrison and Whitehouse 2011).  These 

interspecific groups are found in many taxa, including ungulates (Fitzgibbon 1990), primates 

(Terborgh 1990), fish (Allan and Pitcher 1986), and birds (Moynihan 1962). In tropical forests, there 

are two main interspecific associations among understory Amazonian birds, which are the mixed-

species flocks and the ant-following birds (Bierregaard and Lovejoy 1989, Cohn-Haft et al 1997).  

Ant following birds are aggregated at swarms of army-ants (e.g. Eciton burchelli) (Willis and Oniki 

1978). They are following the ants but do not feed on them. Instead, these birds are capturing prey 

(mainly arthropods) flushed by the flow of ants. Those ants are mainly active during the reproductive 

or ‘nomadic’ period (i.e. fourteen days in each 35 days, Schneirla 1971 in Willis and Oniki 1978), 

which will drive the presence of birds in an area (Willis and Oniki 1978). At swarms, we can find 

birds with two different strategies. There are the species that are exclusively foraging over ant 

swarms, classified as “professional”, and the birds that will wait at the edges of the swarms and 

occasionally forage in the center, categorized as “non-professional” (Oniki 1972, Oniki and Willis 

1972, Willis and Oniki 1978, Harper 1989, Willson 2004).  

Understory mixed-species flocks are groups of insectivorous species that move and forage together 

all day long, and have the particularity to be stable throughout the year in tropical areas (Morse 1970, 

Martinez and Gomez 2013). The association between species results in higher foraging efficiency 

and  reduces predation, as well as increases their fitness (Beauchamps 2004). They consist of 

breeding pairs of six to ten ‘core’ species (i.e. almost exclusively seen in flock), which have together 

a foraging area that includes all their territories (Munn 1985, Jullien and Thiollay 1998). Among 

those ‘core’ species, the Thamnomanes sp. are species that play the role of leader in the Amazon. 

Their role consists of rallying the members of the flocks by emitting loud calls early each morning 



5 
 

that continue throughout the day in order to maintain the cohesion of the group during movements. 

They also give alarm calls when they detect a potential predator, which provides benefits for other 

species that therefore can decrease their vigilance (Munn and Terborgh 1979, Powell 1985). 

Martínez and Zenil (2012) demonstrated the dependence on those warnings for the species that 

attend to flocks. Thamnomanes sp. take the opportunity, that those species will stop foraging after 

emission of an alarm call, to emit false warnings and benefit from the distraction effect to catch prey 

flushed by other birds (Powell 1985). Those behaviors show the different implications of the acoustic 

communication within the flock. During day, the ‘core’ species can be joined by up to 50 species, 

with variation over time in species’ flock attendance (Jullien and Thiollay 1998). Considering this 

difference in ‘attendance’, flock species have been allocated to different categories from ‘core’ to 

‘occasional’ species (see Munn and Terborgh 1979, Jullien and Thiollay 1998 for example of 

classifications). These definitions highlight the complexity of studying mixed-species flocks in the 

field and partly explained that many researchers have relied on an ultimately subjective decision like 

include an individual in the studied group or not.  

Tropical forests are subject to high degrees of habitat degradation, which affect the entire avifauna 

(Bierregaard and Lovejoy 1989). However, whilst the effects of disturbance on non-trophic and 

social interactions in birds are known to exist, they are not sufficiently studied so far at the entire 

group structure scale (Mokross et al 2014). 

Our first objective is to look for non-random associations within both mixed-species flocks and ant-

following birds in undisturbed tropical forests. We then want to be able to delimit sub-groups in old 

growth forest in order to test the validity of species’ traditional categorizations from the 

ornithological literature. The second objective is to use these results to compare with the associations 

and group structure in disturbed forest, and thus be able to highlight any breaking of associations that 

would explain any changes to the group structure of these groups of bird species.

NON-RANDOM INTER-SPECIFIC ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN 

AMAZON UNDERSTORY FOREST BIRDS: WHAT ARE THEY AND 

HOW DO THEY CHANGE? 

 

INTRODUCTION 

 

Living organisms are in constant interaction with their environment and with each other. Among 

these interactions, group living is one of the features adopted across many animal taxa, including 

mammals, fish, and birds (Moynihan 1962, Allan and Pitcher 1986, Terborgh 1990). Groups are 

most commonly composed of animals of one species, but there are many striking cases of inter-

specific association resulting either from the presence of a common resource or from a social 

behavior that pulls animals from different species together (Morse 1970, Moriarty 1977, Powell 

1979). Inter-specific associations of a social nature may reduce competition between individuals 

while increasing foraging success and anti-predation effects (Harrison and Whitehouse 2011, Sridhar 

et al 2009). As important as those ecological interactions may be, they are subject to environmental 

change (Tylianakis et al 2008), and by human activity, mainly via habitat loss (Thiollay 1992, 1999a, 

Stouffer and Bierregaard 1995, Maldonado-Coelho and Marini 2000, Van Houtan et al 2006, 

Knowlton and Graham 2011, Mokross et al 2014).  

In the Amazon tropical rainforests that are the setting of this study one can find two main types of 

inter-specific association between understory forest birds, the social-driven mixed-species flocks 

(Morse 1970) and the resource-driven army-ant-following flocks (Willis and Oniki 1978). Mixed-

species flocks of birds are among the most complex multi-species association of foraging species, 

present in diverse habitat around the world (Harrison and Whitehouse 2011). Historically, these 

interspecific associations of birds have been delimited in two main approaches. The first is 

qualitative, and based on field observations done by experts with recognized authority in the field 

(e.g. Munn and Terborgh 1979, Cohn-Haft et al 1997, Willis and Oniki 1978). The second is 



7 
 

quantitative and results from mathematical analysis of field observations (e.g. Moynihan 1962, 

Jullien and Thiollay 1998). Since field observations are at the root of both approaches, it is important 

to consider two principal difficulties in identifying and following multi-species flocks in the field. 

First, it is very costly; researchers may spend several hundreds of hours following tens of flocks (e.g. 

Moynihan 1962, Mokross et al. 2014). Second, it is difficult to determine which bird is part of a 

flock due mostly to difficulty in delimiting the spatial and temporal extent of the observed 

association. While Moynihan (1962) considered tropical birds to be flocking when they were seen in 

the same tree or bush, others include only species seen moving together throughout periods of 10, 15 

or 30 minutes (Powell 1989, Jullien and Thiollay 1998, Mokross et al. 2014). Given the variety of 

temporal and spatial criteria, it is easy to understand how they can influence perceptions of who 

associates with whom. Indeed, in the Amazon, many species are rarely detected outside of inter-

specific associations, and the detection of mixed-species flocks is usually triggered by the presence 

of Thamnomanes spp. individuals (Munn and Terborgh 1979, Powell 1985). The subsequent step of 

categorizing what species are more or less involved in the association is also problematic. These 

categories usually result from a species-level calculation of flocking propensity, sometimes measured 

as the percentage of all sightings of species that occurred in flocks (Moynihan 1962, Jullien and 

Thiollay 1998). Studies of the impact of habitat degradation on inter-specific associations usually 

allude to changes in the abundance and presence of flocking species (Thiollay 1997, Van Houtan et 

al 2006), but they also use measures of flocking propensity to assess changes from a quantitative 

perspective (Thiollay 1999b, Mokross et al 2014). The main drawback of propensity measures, 

however, is that they miss the opportunity to understanding associations at the pairwise level. That is, 

any re-structuring of inter-specific associations that results in a similar proportion of (unspecified) 

interspecific encounters for each species will be missed by propensity metrics. 

Species interactions in general have for a long time been studied at the entire matrix (or set of 

species) level (Gotelli and McCabe 2002). The analysis of species co-occurrence on islands elicited 



8 
 

much academic debate through the years, starting with Jared Diamond’s studies of bird species co-

occurrence on islands in Southeast Asia (1973, 1975, reviewed in Gotelli and MacCabe 2002). 

Diamond’s study focused largely on the assessment of diffuse competition; thus requiring the 

analysis of co-occurrence patterns among multiple species within an assemblage. Such focus resulted 

in methods aimed at understanding patterns at the level of the entire assemblage regardless of the 

specifics of interaction between any two particular pair of species. One important component of such 

methods is the Null Model approach (synthesis of algorithms and metrics in Gotelli 2000) which 

help quantify the extent to each a particular observed pattern is different from what could be 

expected from chance encounters of species that do not seek to interact with each other. Null models 

have been applied to study possible patterns of co-occurrence in mixed-species bird flocks (Graves 

and Gotelli 1993) and in ant-following flocks of neotropical forest (Pizo and Melo 2010). More 

recent applications suggest examining pairwise co-occurrence associations (Sfenthourakis et al 2006, 

Veech 2006, Gotelli and Ulrich 2010, Pitta et al 2012) with methods that could detect positive, 

negative or random association between two species (Veech 2013, 2014).  

A second, much used approach to understanding inter-specific interactions is the use of social 

network analysis. Network analysis is still based on matrix-level information (Croft et al 2008, 

Farine and Whitehead 2015) and it helps one to visually identify social interaction based on a graph 

representing species by nodes and biological interactions by edges (Wey et al 2008). These networks 

are ideal to understand the structural complexity of biological processes and types of interactions, 

such as mutualism (Guimarães et al 2011). They are also helpful to assess the impact of habitat 

disturbance (Tylianakis et al 2007, Mokross et al 2014) and climate change (Araújo et al 2011) on 

interactions. Different metrics are used to interpret the interactions represented in a network, with 

modularity metrics, usually employed for delimiting subunits of a network (Girvan and Newman 

2002, Newman 2004, 2006).  



9 
 

In order to identify non-random encounters of Amazon understory forest birds and measure their 

change with habitat disturbance, we decided to combine the two methodological approaches of null 

models and network analysis. While doing so, we will focus on pairwise measurements of 

association between species which will enable us to go beyond the whole ensemble view of the inter-

specific interaction. To do so, we create a new pairwise metric of association strength that results 

from the null model analysis and subsequently informs the construction of network graphs. Once 

having a network, we perform a modularity analysis for delimiting groups of interacting species 

above the pairwise approach.  

Perhaps the most striking aspect of our study is that we evaluate the association between species 

through an approach that, at the outset, assumes that such associations might as well not exist. 

Instead of going to the field and sampling animals that we determine to be part of an association, we 

sample animals without regard for their association status and let the data inform us of any patterns 

of co-detection. To strengthen our inference, we sample using two different techniques, automated 

audio recording and mist-netting. The analyses were first carried out separately by sampling 

technique and subsequently joined producing a view of interspecific associations that uses different 

lines of evidence. The results give a robust view of what species are most strongly associated and 

enable an analysis of how the associations play out in different habitat with different levels of 

disturbance.  

 

METHODS 

Study area and sampling design 

This study draws on data collected between 2010 and 2015 at the Biological Dynamics of Forest 

Fragments Project (BDFFP) area, 70 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil (2°30’S 60°W; Fig. 1). 

The area of approximately 300 square kilometers is covered by upland old-growth (OG) and 



10 
 

secondary (SF) tropical rain forest, with an annual rainfall from 1900 to 2500 mm, and a pronounced 

dry season from June to December (Gascon and Bierregard 2001). The BDFFP started as a landscape 

manipulation experiment aimed at understanding the effect of habitat removal and isolation on a 

broad range of organisms and ecological parameters (Bierregaard and Lovejoy 1989). Prior to the 

project onset, in 1979, the area was covered and surrounded by continuous OG forest. Between 1980 

and 1984, three large cattle ranches were established (Stotz and Bierregaard 1989), with pasture 

established in approximately 20% of the area. The ranches were subsequently abandoned and the 

present-day landscape consists almost entirely of forest cover, approximately one fifth of which is 

SF.

(filled circles) and approximate location of the 38 mist-netting sites near Porto Alegre (left circle) and Cabo 

Frio (right circle) camps, Amazonas, Brazil. Sites are distributed through old growth (dark grey) and secondary 

forest (light grey). Pastures are represented in white, while roads, paved and unpaved, appear as continuous and 

dashed lines, respectively. 

 

We based our study on two datasets of understory forest bird detections obtained with two different 

sampling techniques: audio recording and mist-netting. Both the audio recorders and the mist-nets 



11 
 

were placed in the forest understory, but the audio data naturally represents a higher vertical section 

of the forest, as it can record vocalizations of the loudest birds all the way up to the forest canopy. 

Mist-nets extended from the ground level up to 2.5 meters high.  For logistic convenience, recording 

quality, and bird safety, we sampled only during dry season months. Mist net captures took place 

between June 2009 and October 2015 (excluding 2010 and 2012), while audio recording took place 

between June and November 2010. 

The audio dataset comprises 151 sites, 107 in OG and 44 in SF, distributed throughout the study 

area. Sites were sampled for four to six consecutive days each. The autonomous recorders worked 

unassisted for three hours per day per site, starting 40 minutes before sunrise (details in Figueira et al 

2015). Each three-hour recording was randomly subsampled with five, five-minute, non-overlapping 

recording cuts that were subsequently processed in the lab by ornithologists with knowledge of the 

local bird sounds. Each cut produced a list of detected species. Mist-net captures happened over a 

smaller, central portion of the study area covering 38 OG and SF sites. Lines of 4 to 15 mist-nets 

were placed monthly (throughout the dry season of the mist-netting years) at a randomly selected 

subset of sites. The 12-by-3 meter nets were opened from 6 am to 12 pm and checked every 30 

minutes. One mist-net sample consists of one mist-net opened for 30 minutes and has an associated 

species list. 

Study species 

We focus our study on species that have been previously reported to occur in our study area and to 

take part in inter-specific associations. Cohn-Haft et al. (1997) has the most complete list of the 

BDFFP avifauna, updated from Stotz and Bierregaard (1989) and including 394 species. Cohn-Haft 

et al. (1997) also provide qualitative information about abundance, preferred habitat, and sociality 

status of each species. The sociality status is particularly relevant for us, because it lists species as 

foraging in monospecific flocks, mixed-species flocks of the canopy or understory, solitary or in 

pairs, and as part of army-ant following flocks. Of these categories, the mixed-species and the ant-



12 
 

follower flocks comprise inter-specific associations. We therefore built our study species list starting 

from all species that were listed as understory mixed-species or ant-following flock members by 

Cohn-Haft et al. (1997; Table S1). To complete the list, we obtained information from other studies 

of BDFFP birds (Harper 1989, Stouffer and Bierregaard 1995) and from elsewhere in the 

biogeographic region of the Guyana shield (Jullien and Thiollay 1998). As many species classified as 

being part of canopy flocks can spend many hours per day with understory flocks (Munn 1985), we 

also included species described as canopy mixed-species flock members by Cohn-Haft et al. (1997) 

that were reported as occasional understory mixed-species flock members by Jullien &amp;amp; Thiollay 

(1998) and by Munn &amp;amp; Terborgh (1979). In the end, we obtained a list of 37 target species, with 

hypothetical inter-specific associations listed in table S1.  

Data organization 

The data sets resulting from the two sampling techniques were split by habitat (OG or SF), resulting 

in four sub-datasets: OG-audio, OG-capture, SF-audio and SF-capture. Each sub-dataset was 

organized as an observation matrix with i =1 to R rows, and j = 1 to C columns. Each row of the 

capture data represents one 30-minute sample with one mist-net, while each row of the audio data 

represents one five-minute recording cut. Each column represents a species that was detected in the 

corresponding row, either by captured or audio recording. Entry aij of the binary observation 

matrices represents the detection (1) or non-detection (0) of species j in sample i. Summing across 

rows, one obtains Sj, which is the total number of detections of species j across all samples. Once 

having the four observation matrices, we obtained four associated co-detection matrices. Co-

detection matrices listed the observed species as rows and columns and show the number of times 

that each possible species pair was detected in the same (audio or mist-netting) sample.

Quantifying pairwise interspecific associations 

We assess the strength of association between species by measuring the extent to which the observed 

number of co-detections could result from a simulated observation matrix where the distribution of 

detections across samples was independent between species. To do this, we use the fixed-

equiprobable algorithm of Gotelli (2000), where, for every species, the total number of detections per 

(Sj) is fixed but each detection has the same probability of happening on every sample. Under this 

algorithm, the simulated number of species per sample (row total) can vary, but all occasions have 

the same average number of species. Figuratively, this amounts to shuffling detections of each 

species across sites, independently between species. We employed the randomization algorithm 

1,000 times for each sub-dataset, each time simulating one observation and one co-detection matrix. 

The 1,000 simulated co-detection matrices provide one distribution of co-detection for each pairwise 

combination of species. In order to quantify the extent to which species associate more than expected 

under the null model, one only has to look where the observed number of co-detections falls within 

the simulated distribution.  

Our pairwise index of association strength (AS) between two species measures the distance between 

the observed number of co-detections and the mean number of simulated co-detections, in units of 

standard deviation of the simulated distribution. Our AS index provides a better description of 

interspecific association than a raw count of the number of times two species were seen together 

because it accounts for the inevitable fact that species that are detected more often have a higher 

chance of being co-detected with others than species that are rarely detected. Thus, the AS index can 

be used for comparing association strengths between species pairs, between methods and between 

habitats. High AS values mean that the species were detected together more times than expected 

under the null model. Near-zero values indicate that observations are compatible with the null 

expectations. We consider that there is a strong association between two species when AS is greater 

than 2.576 SDs. Under a normal distribution of simulated co-detections, using this threshold value 



14 
 

amounts to a two-tailed test of the null hypothesis of no association between species, using a p-value 

of 0.01.   

Having the results from all pairwise associations, we built association strength matrices for each 

habitat and sampling technique. In order to combine results from the two sampling techniques, we 

simply calculated the arithmetic mean between AS indexes obtained for the same pair under the two 

techniques. When a pair of species was detected by only one of the sampling techniques, we 

considered that technique alone in the combined analysis. In the end, we produced six AS index 

matrices corresponding to OG-audio, OG-capture, OG-combined, SF-audio, SF-capture, and SF-

combined data. 

Visualizing and delimiting groups of interacting species 

Beyond measuring pairwise associations, we wanted to visualize association patterns at the level of 

the whole set of study species. To do so, we built six weighted networks based on the six AS index 

matrices using the software Gephi and the graph layout algorithm ForceAtlas2 (Jacomy et al 2014). 

Each node on a network represents a species and the ‘degree’ of a node, illustrated by its size, 

represents the number of links (or edges) that a species has with all other species. The weighted 

edges connected pairs of species with strong association (AS &gt; 2.576), with edge width representing 

the magnitude of the association. AS values smaller than or equal to 2.576 were not considered in the 

network construction.  

In order to identify groups of species and measure the extent to which a network is 

compartmentalized, we performed a modularity analysis based on the function cluster-louvain from 

the R package igraph (Blondel et al 2008). This analysis returned a network graph showing the 

partition of species in groups and a modularity metric Q that quantifies the extent to which a network 

shows fewer edges than expected under a model of no compartmentalization (Newman 2006). 

Overall, species groups defined by the modularity analysis tended to associate amongst themselves 



15 
 

more strongly than with species from other groups. To quantify this tendency, we calculated the 

average AS values within and between modules, based only on the strong associations. This 

quantification and previous knowledge of species natural history helped us name each module and 

compare our findings with the ornithological expectation compiled in table S1.  

Change in interspecific association between old-growth and secondary-forest habitat  

To study the change in interspecific associations from OG to SF, we computed pairwise differences 

in the number of co-detections in SF and OG, separately for each sampling technique. Positive 

differences denote an increase, and negative differences a decrease in pairwise association from OG 

to SF. Subsequently, in an approach parallel to that used for generating AS values, we simulated 

1000 joint-habitat observation matrices for each technique. Each simulation shuffled each species’ 

detections across samples from both habitats, allowing that a detection from OG might be randomly 

placed in a SF sample. Based on the 1000 simulations, we obtained distributions of SF-OG 

differences and an index of association change (AC) for each pair of species and sampling technique. 

Once having the technique-specific AC values, we averaged them across techniques to obtain a 

combined-data AC matrix. When a AC value is greater than 2.576 we say that the association 

became significantly stronger in SF; conversely, when AC is smaller than -2.576 we say that the 

association became significantly weaker. Combining information on AC and AS indices, we obtain 

the nine possible scenarios for association change listed in Table 2. Broadly, there are three 

increasing and three decreasing scenarios, plus to scenarios of no change and one scenario without 

evaluation. We could only evaluate changes with forest type when the two species of a pairwise 

comparison had sufficient data (&gt; 10 detections) in both habitats for at least one of the observation 

techniques, when this is not the case, Table 2 cells show an ‘NA’ value. The two no-change 

scenarios indicate situations where AS is low (&lt;2.576) in both habitats, with a low AC value 

(denoted by ‘0’) and where AS is high in both habitats with low AC value (‘=’). The three decreasing 

scenarios comprise: a) AS high in both habitats with high negative AC value (‘?’); b) AS high in 



16 
 

OG but smaller than 2.576 in SF with a small negative AC value (‘??’); and c) AS high in OG and 

low in SF with a high negative AC value (‘???’). Similarly, the three increase scenarios are: a) 

high positive AC value with high AS in both OG and SF (‘?’); b) low AS in OG and high AS in SF 

with small positive AC (‘??’); and c) low AS in OG and high AS in SF, with high positive AC 

value.  

RESULTS   

Data overview 

Our recording data consisted of 3,076 five-minute audio samples, 2,178 from OG and 898 from SF. 

The aggregate of all audio samples contained 18,072 detections, 34% of which were detections of 

our target species, corresponding to 4,039 target-species detections in OG and 1,090 in SF. The 

capture data consisted of 65,230 netting samples, 35,755 in OG and 29,475 in SF. These samples 

returned a total of 6,455 individual bird captures, 58% of which were from our target species and 

were split between 2,077 OG and 1,658 SF captures (Table S1). Three of the target species, the 

flycatchers Onychorhynchus coronatus, Terenotriccus erythrurus and Rhynchocyclus olivaceus were 

not sampled ten or more times in OG with at least one of the sampling techniques, so they did not 

fulfill the criterion for inclusion and were dropped from the analysis.  

Group delimitation based on pairwise association in old growth forest 

All 37 target species occurred in OG but only 34 fulfilled the criterion for inclusion in the analysis. 

All 34 showed strong associations with at least one other species but some were detected less than 

ten times with either of the sampling techniques and were excluded from technique-specific analyses. 

Namely, Epinecrophylla gutturalis, Isleria guttata, Dendrocincla merula and Mionectes macconnelli 

had more than ten mist-net captures each, but were audio-recorded less than ten times in the OG 

data. Conversely, Piculus flavigula, Lanio fulvus, Automolus ochrolaemus, Tolmomyias assimilis, 

Sittasomus griseicapillus, Dendrocolaptes certhia, D. picumnus, Hylexetastes perrotii and 



17 
 

Campylorhamphus procurvoides had a sufficient number of audio-recordings but neither had more 

than ten mist-net captures for inclusion in OG capture-data analyses.  

The pairwise analysis of audio samples returned association strengths of -2.49 to 16.32 SDs. There 

were, in all, 117 strong associations in 406 possible associations (26.35%, Table S2). Pairwise 

association strengths from capture data ranged from -0.80 to 23.34 SDs, with 88 strong associations 

in 300 possible associations (29.33%, Table S3). When we combined results from both sampling 

techniques into one triangular matrix of average association strengths, values ranged from -2.49 to 

17.39 SDs, with 132 strong associations over 561 possible associations (25.58%, Table S4). None of 

the negative values were more than 2.576 SDs away from the mean of the null distribution. 

The two networks based on the association strengths for each sampling technique were broadly 

coincident (Fig. S1). The audio-data network partitioned the 29 analyzed species in three modules 

composed of twelve, ten and six species, with a modularity metric of Q = 0.209 (Fig. S1A). The 

same analysis applied to the capture data produced a network with 25 species divided in four groups 

of nine, five, four and seven species. Here, the modularity metric was slightly higher, at Q = 0.237 

(Fig. S1B). There are two sets of species that appear in the same group in both the audio- and the 

capture-data networks. One set, at the center of the networks, is the quintet Thamnomanes 

ardesiacus, T. caesius, Myrmotherula longipennis, M. menetriesii and Tunchiornis ochraceiceps; and 

the second, always clearly separated from the first, is the trio Pithys albifrons, Gymnopithys rufigula 

and Percnostola rufifrons. The combination of audio and capture data into one triangular matrix of 

interaction strengths, offers a single graphical representation of the associations in our data. (Table 

S4, Fig. 2). The modularity analysis of this joint-data network resulted in five modules with a metric 

Q = 0.248. Individual modules contained between five and eight species, with seven to 25 strong 

associations within the module. We designate as ‘core’, the module of eight species with 25 strong 

associations among them and a ratio of 3.13 strong associations per species (Table 1). The core 

module had the highest ratio of strong associations per species and the highest—although extremely 



18 
 

variable—association strengths. The two modules designated as ‘Attendant 1’ and ‘Attendant 2’ had 

higher average association strength within the module than with any other module, as did the Core 

and the ‘Ant Follower’ modules. Nonetheless, the two ‘Attendant’ modules have higher average 

association strength with the ‘Core’ than with any module other than themselves, which justifies 

their name. The ‘Ant follower’ module had the lowest average association strength with the ‘Core’ 

and is composed by species that are well known to forage around moving army-ant swarms. Finally, 

there was only one module whose average association strength within the module was not higher 

than all average association strengths between itself and other modules. We designate this weaker 

module as ‘Unknown’ (Table 1).

Inter-specific associations in the secondary forest  

Twenty-three of our target species crossed the threshold of ten or more detections in secondary forest 

by at least one of the sampling techniques. Among these, eighteen crossed the threshold with audio 

data, eighteen with capture data, and thirteen with both. One third (32.35 %) of the target species 

detected in OG were not detected in SF but 21 of the 23 species detected in SF showed at least one 

strong pairwise association with some other species (Table S7). Microbates collaris and Sittasomus 

griseicapillus did not show strong associations at all, so they were not included in the network 

analysis.  

The pairwise analysis of audio samples returned association strengths of -1.32 to 11.32 SDs. These 

included 34 strong associations over 153 possible associations (22.22%; Table S5). The analysis of 

capture data returned association strengths from -0.99 to 16.07 SDs, with 42 strong associations in 

153 possible associations (27.45%, Table S6). The combination of the two sampling techniques 

returned a slightly lower proportion of strong links (52 / 253 or 20.55%, Table S7) than either 

technique taken in isolation. A few of the combined-data associations were negative, but none had an 

absolute value greater than 2.576 SDs away from the mean of the null distribution. Comparing the 



21 
 

combined results from OG and SF, we see a decrease of nearly one fifth (19.66%) in the proportion 

of strong associations in SF relative to OG. 

As in the OG, the technique-specific network analyses of SF data produced broadly coinciding 

results (Qcapture=0.258, Qsound=0.201, Fig. S2); for simplicity, we focus on the combined-data network 

(Fig. 3). It is noteworthy that even thought the proportion of strong links decreases relative to that in 

OG, the modularity metric goes up, from Q = 0.248 to Q = 0.296. The 21 species were distributed in 

three modules with three to nine species, and three to 21 strong associations per module (Fig. 3, 

Table S7). Some of the SF modules mirror those in OG, with, for example, T. caesius and M. 

menestriesii strongly associated and present in the same group. Likewise, P. albifrons, G. rufigula 

and Willisornis poecillinotus, were once again found together in the same module.

netting data. Eight-letter codes, symbol, symbol size, and edge width as in Fig. 2. Colors represent groups 

formed in the network modularity analysis: SF-Core (Blue), SF-Attendant (Orange), and SF-Ant-follower 

(Green). Species names on the bottom give the composition of each group. 

 



22 
 

The analysis of association strengths within and between SF modules reflects the similarity between 

OG and SF networks (Table S8). Unlike in the OG data, here there is higher average association 

strength within them between modules for all modules, i.e. no ‘Unknown’ group. We again designate 

as ‘Core’, or ‘SF-Core’, the module with the highest average and variability of association strengths. 

Once again, this was the only module with a ratio of more than two strong links per species. Ranking 

the remaining modules in decreasing order of average association to the ‘SF-Core’, the second 

module still had more than one strong link per species and showed a relatively high average 

association with the ‘SF-Core’; we designated this module as ‘SF-Attendant’. Finally, we gave the 

name ‘SF-Ant-follower’ for the last group containing only three ant-following species (Table S8, 

Fig. 3).  

Table 2 summarizes changes in pairwise association strength from OG to SF. It first becomes clear 

that some of the species in the OG network of Figure 2 are not present in the comparison, because 

they were not sufficiently detected in SF. The twenty-three species present in both habitats, 

potentially produced 253 pairwise comparisons; we can only evaluate 223 of these because some 

species pairs did not have sufficient data for both species under one single sampling technique—a 

condition for comparison. In all, 24 (~11%) associations that were strong in OG, were broken (or 

ceased to be strong) in SF. Twenty-two (~10%) were either weaker than expected under the null 

model but still strong, or showed a numerical reduction that was no bigger than expected under the 

null model of no change between habitats. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there were eight 

(&lt;4%) new associations, which were strong in SF but absent in OG, and thirteen (~6%) which were 

already present in OG and increased significantly in SF, or just increased from OG to SF albeit no 

more than predicted by the null model. Finally, seventeen associations were present in both habitats 

without any significant change and 139 were absent in both habitats without significant change. 

Looking within the OG modules, the vast majority of changes are negative, with only two exceptions 



23 
 

for a significant increase in the associations W. poecillinotus - G. rufigula and W. poecillinotus - P. 

albifrons associations, which were already present in the OG habitat.

DISCUSSION 

Our study confirms the existence of strong patterns of interspecific co-detection among Amazon 

understory forest birds. The evidence of interspecific association conveyed by this patterns is 

particularly strong for three main reasons: i) it uses two different observation techniques, ii) it 

accounts for variations in the number of detections across species, and iii) it does not involve any 

subjective decisions by field observers about whether two species are or are not part of the same 

group. AS index values revealed that approximately one fourth of all possible species pairings in old 

growth show strong, non-random association. Moreover, we found no evidence of repulsion, i.e. 

strong negative AS values, suggesting the absence of interference competitive interactions that are 

strong enough to result in inter-specific avoidance among the species in our study. Previous studies 

of interspecific associations in our study region (e.g. Jullien and Thiollay 1998, Mokross et al 2014) 

focused on individual species rather than pairwise interactions, measuring ‘mixed-species flocking 

propensity’ as the proportion of times a species was detected in an observer-defined ‘mixed-species’ 

group out of the total number of detections for that species. With our approach, we can assess inter-

specific association at a pairwise level and combine the pairwise information for all species into a 

representation of interactions among all species in the study set.  

The analysis of the network diagram based on association strengths between species in old-growth 

forest showed two distinct aggregates of species. One, aggregate, the ant-follower species was 

particularly well separated from the other species. The other aggregate, which we termed ‘Core’ 

mixed-species flocking species had a high variance but also a high AS value. Three intermediate 

groups—Attendant 1, Attendant 2, and unknown—were less clearly defined. These groups, resulting 

from the modularity analysis had a modularity metric Q between 0.2 and 0.3. Following Newman 

(2004), Q-values greater than 0.3 suggest the group structure is strong, therefore our network should 

be described as diffuse. Nonetheless, except for a few odd associations (i.e. species not considered 

from the same class based on previous studies), the members of the modules based on the joint-data 



26 
 

network coincide well with traditional categorizations of mixed-species flocks and ant-followers in 

the central amazon (Table S1, Jullien and Thiollay 1998, Harper 1979); which means that our group 

delimitation supports pre-existing ecological expectations.  

In total, sixteen species in our study fell on groups that are coincident with those defined in the 

previous literature. Five species, including Thamnomanes caesius, T. ardesiacus, Myrmotherula 

longipennis, M. menestriesii and Epinecrophylla gutturalis were considered as ‘constant flock 

members’ by Jullien &amp;amp; Thiollay (1998) and were defined as ‘Core’ in our analyses. Two species, 

Xenops minutus and Automulus infuscatus, classified as ‘permanent members’ (less than constant) by  

Jullien &amp;amp; Thiollay (1998), were classified as ‘Attendant 1’ in our study. And likewise, three other 

species—Glyphorynchus spirurus, Mionectes macconelli and Myobius barbatus—that were 

classified as ‘frequent but not permanent members’ by Jullien &amp;amp; Thiollay (1998) appear as 

‘Attendant 2’ in our study. Finally, six species of ant-following birds already classified as such by 

Harper (1979) were isolated from the other species in our analysis and appeared as ‘Ant-followers’ 

in our network division. These last species are generally aggregated at swarm of army ants (Willis 

and Oniki 1978, Harper 1979), so it makes sense to have them here all together in the same module. 

Consequently, we found our group delimitation relevant and consistent with previous expert 

knowledge, using simple co-detection matrices which do not require any a priori decision as to 

whether two species are or are not interacting in the field.  

The analysis of SF data revealed a substantial loss of species and loss of associations among the 

remaining species.  In all, one third of the species studied in OG did not have sufficient data for 

analysis in SF. At the same time, among those species that remained, there was a 20% reduction in 

the number of strong associations. These results agree with the tendency for decreased species 

richness and abundance found in previous analyses of disturbed forest habitat (Thiollay 1997, Lee et 

al 2005, Sodhi et al 2008, Sridhar and Sankar 2008, Mokross et al 2014). Nonetheless, we still found 

many strong associations in SF, revealing that several mixed-species flock members and ant-



27 
 

following birds are still appearing together there more than expected under the null model. Indeed, it 

is striking that even though more connections were lost than formed in the transition from OG to SF, 

the modularity metric Q was slightly higher in SF (QOG = 0.248 and QSF = 0.296), albeit still 

characteristic of a diffuse network. As in the OG, the modularity of the SF network clearly separates 

two sets of mixed-species flocking and ant-following species.  

Looking across all species, there are more than twice as many cases of decreased association (46) 

than of increased association (21; Table 2). If, however, we look at changes in pairwise associations 

within the modules defined based on OG data, all evidence of change is negative, except for two 

pairwise increases among ant-following species. This suggests that, 30 years after the onset of SF 

regrowth, the interaction between mixed-species flocking species may be more seriously disrupted 

than the aggregation of ant-followers around army-ant swarms. We can only speculate about the 

reasons behind the overall reduction in association. Perhaps some changes are due to differences in 

canopy height and vegetation density, which might influence flock attendance due to changes in 

exposure to predators (Thiollay 1997) or in prey availability (Develey and Peres 2000). The 

reduction in resource availability may constrain species to extend their space use and consequently 

reduce their flock attendance. These results support the idea that understory forest bird inter-specific 

associations are fragile and vulnerable to disappearing as a result of habitat disturbance (Mokross et 

al 2014). It is an open question whether the weakening of inter-specific associations has any 

measurable effect on the fitness of the involved species.   

Our study does not refute any previously held belief about interspecific association of Amazon 

understory forest birds, but it improves quantitative detail and robustness of the existing ideas about 

group delimitation and association changes with habitat disturbance. The key methodological choices 

behind this improvement are the use of two different field sampling techniques, and the integration 

of a null model approach with the network representation of pairwise associations. The main 

advantage of combining two sampling techniques 



28 
 

is the potential for reducing technique bias. Audio recording is an efficient approach for sampling 

bird presence across a broad range of vertical positions in dense, low-visibility tropical rainforests 

(Terborgh et al 1990). Furthermore, autonomous audio recording, which we used in this study, 

makes it possible to sample birds without the interference of a human observer (Acevedo and 

Villanueva-Rivera 2006, Brandes 2008). The second technique, mist-net capture, makes it possible to 

detect secretive and non-vocalizing birds (Blake and Loiselle 2001). Mist-nets do span a limited 

portion of the vertical profile of the forest, as they extend up to three meters in height at most. The 

species in our study move in a variety of heights throughout the forest, but with the exception of a 

few mixed-species flocking birds that tend to forage above the mist-net level (e.g. Myrmotherula 

menestriesii, Munn and Terborgh 1979), they tend to concentrate in the understory, within reach of 

the mist-nets.  

Three caveats should be considered when evaluating our methodological choices and constraints. 

First, our data were constrained by broadly non-overlapping spatial distribution of audio recording 

and mist-net samples. This makes it difficult to directly compare the performance of each technique 

without explicitly modeling detection probability; nonetheless, our finding of many similar 

associations under both techniques strengthens our confidence in the findings. It is noteworthy, too, 

that the combined data network showed an increase, albeit a slight one, of the modularity metric (i.e. 

highest Q based on combined data). We conclude that even with difference spatial distribution of the 

sampling effort, the two techniques complement each other in an informative way. 

A second caveat relates to the idea that falling in the same mist-net within a period of 30 minutes or 

calling within 5 minutes within the proximity of a recording device are not undisputable evidence of 

social interaction. This is particularly true when species have coincident and narrow schedules of 

vocal activity. Nonetheless, it is also true that social interaction will necessarily increase the 

probability of calling together or falling in the same net. Species moving as a group will make 

constant contact calls to stay grouped together or warn each other about the proximity of a predator, 



29 
 

a behavior that is well document for core mixed-species flocking species such as Thamnomanes sp. 

(Munn and Terborgh 1979, Martinez and Zenil 2012). Indeed, behavioral ecologists often use the 

‘gambit of the group’ to define animal associations based on spatial proximity (Franks et al 2010). 

We apply this reasoning in our interpretation of co-detection data. Despite its probabilistic nature, the 

use of indirect evidence of interaction is useful for contrasting with previous work, because it does 

not rely on subjective judgment of who is interacting with whom in the field. Whatever patterns we 

identify with our approach are not influenced by prior expectation about social interaction and thus 

fulfill our objective of trying to detect hypothetical associations under the presumption that they do 

not exist. 

The third and final caveat relates to the use of degenerate matrices in our null model algorithms 

(Gotelli 2000, Connor and Simberloff 1983). Degenerate matrices include rows (or columns) that are 

filled with zeros and they may not always be helpful in inferring associations. In our case, however, 

we believe it is more appropriate to use degenerate than non-degenerate matrices. One row of zeros 

in our detection matrices represents an occasion where none of our target species was detected (an 

empty column would represent a species that is never detected). We did not include non-detected 

target species in any of our analysis, but the empty rows (i.e. occasions without detection) represent a 

biologically meaningful situation as it is possible that some nets have no captures or some recordings 

have no vocalizations because the individuals that could possibly be sampled there are concentrated 

elsewhere. That is why we decided to develop our analysis using degenerate observation matrices, a  

decision that finds support in the null model literature (Haefner 1988, Gotelli 2000).  

Mixed-species flocks and ant-follower birds in tropical forest are a real phenomenon of non-random 

associations that can be found either from direct observations in the field or from indirect sampling 

techniques. The groups that we delimited are ecologically meaningful as confirmed by direct 

observations in previous studies. However, the associations between species are not stable when 

faced with habitat disturbance; many of the associations observed in old-growth forest break down in 



30 
 

secondary forest. In addition, some species were detected less or not at all in secondary forest. 

Associations between species are clearly evident from the data, but we know next to nothing about 

the extent to which they influence the fitness of the involved species. Future work should focus on 

developing experimental or creative observation approaches to understand the extent to which the 

associations that we report here are being subject to natural selection.

ANNEXES  

Table S1. Data summary and overview of inter-specific group classifications prior to and including this study. Numerical 

columns show the data summary for audio recordings and mist-net captures. ‘Audio Recordings’ show number of 5-

min tracks where species was detected in old growth (OG) and secondary forest (SF); ‘Mist-net Captures’ show number 

of individual captures. Shading highlights sampling technique and habitat combinations that had fewer then ten 

detections for the corresponding species, these detections were not included in our analyses. The four columns on the 

right show classification of study species in inter-specific groups according to three prior studies and to our own 

classification based on the combination of audio and mist-netting data from the undisturbed old-growth habitat. Species 

are ranked according to the South American Classification Committee list.

†Species that occasionally switch from canopy to understory flocks according to Munn &amp;amp; Terborgh (1979). 

Key for inter-specific group classes: : Harper 1979 - ‘o’=obligate ant-follower, ‘f’=facultative ant-follower; Cohn-Haft et al. 1997 - 
‘c’ = canopy flock member, ‘u’ = understory flock member, ‘a’ = ant-follower s’ = solitary, ‘f’ = in mixed-species aggregations at 

fruiting trees; Jullien &amp;amp; Thiollay 1998 - ‘c’ = constant flock member, ‘p’ = permanent flock member, ‘f’ = frequent but not permanent 

member; This study, based on modularity analysis of combined old growth data network - ‘c’ = core member, ‘a1’ = attendant 1, ‘a2’ 

= attendant 2, ‘u’ = uncertain, ‘af’ = ant-follower, ‘-’ = insufficient data in old growth.

Table S4. Pairwise association strengths and group delimitation based on the combination of recording and capture data from old-growth sites. Groups defined by the modularity 

analysis are outlined in black. NAs are due to a lack of detection of both species with the same method, so it was not possible to measure this association index. Species within 

groups are ranked by phylogeny order.

Fig. S1. Interspecific association network based on the audio recording (A) and mist-net capture (B) data from old-

growth sites. Eight-letter codes indicate species listed in Figure 3. Network nodes are interacting species and are 

represented by circles with size proportional to the number of edges connecting the node species with other species. 

Edge width is proportional to the association strength. The colors represent species groups given by the network 

modularity analysis.

Table S7. Association strengths and group delimitation for secondary forest based on the combination of audio and capture data. Modules are delimited by the black rectangles. 

Species with gray shading were not included in the modularity analysis. We could only analyze species pairs where both species of the pair had ten or more detections for at 

least one of the sampling techniques. When this happened, we wrote ‘NA’ in the corresponding cell and excluded this association from the network analysis. Species within 

groups are ranked according to the South American Classification Committee list.

CLOSING REMARQUES  
 

The results that succeed from this work suggest that we are able to study group structure of social 

associations between understory birds in Amazonian forest from indirect observations. Indeed, we were able 

to find the evidence of non-random inter-specific encounter within bird species based on data collected with 

automated sound recording and mist-netting capture. We found many strong associations between species. 

From those, we were able to delimit groups of species more often associated than by chance with ecological 

meanings. Those groups were confirmed by previous classifications from other studies.  

In addition, our second objective was to be able to observe a change in association with habitat disturbance, 

and that is what we successfully observed. We found that some species were detected less or not at all in 

secondary forest. Also, many of the associations between species observed in old-growth forest breaks down 

in secondary forest; which was a proof of a non-stability of those associations. In the end, our work show 

that social associations between understory Amazonian bird species was highly sensitive to habitat 

disturbance.
