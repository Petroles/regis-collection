As metas que se traçam sem dor e sem sacrifícios, 

Nunca serão saboreadas como aquelas 

 Em que Lutar até ao último segundo,  

É acreditar que sempre se pode ir mais longe. 

Afinal, superarmo-nos a nós próprios é saber que não há limites, 

Que tudo pode acontecer mesmo quando todos à nossa volta 

Nos arrastam contra o precipício.

RESUMO 

 

O Golfo de Cádis encontra-se localizado numa complexa área tectónica a oeste do Estreito 

de Gibraltar, sudoeste da Ibéria e noroeste de Marrocos. Este está posicionado numa área de 

transição entre a falha transformante da Gloria, delineando a fronteira entre as placas Africana e 

Euroasiática, e a parte mais oeste da cintura orogénica Alpina, marcada pelo Arco de Gibraltar. 

O Golfo de Cádis é uma região sismicamente ativa e como tal, pensasse ter sido o epicentro do 

Grande Terramoto de Lisboa, Portugal, de 1755, que atingiu um magnitude de 8.5 a 8.7 na escala 

de Richter. O terramoto originou o maior tsunami decorrido até agora na zona oeste da Europa, 

levando à destruição da cidade de Lisboa. Esta atividade tectónica ocorre no fundo do mar em 

estruturas responsáveis pelo escape de fluidos, como pockmarks (pequenas depressões no fundo 

do mar), cristas diapíricas, carbonate mud mounds e vulcões de lama. Os vulcões de lama são 

estruturas sedimentares localizadas no fundo do mar, criadas pela rápida advecção de fluidos e 

lamas saturadas de metano, provenientes das camadas sobre pressionadas de sedimentos do fundo 

do mar. Estes devido a exalação de fluidos geológicos, permitem a existência de comunidades 

biológicas quimiossintéticas. 

O principal objetivo deste trabalho consiste em compreender a influência das falhas 

SWIM e dos vulcões de lama na distribuição da macrofauna no Golfo de Cádis. Vários passos 

foram realizados de forma a tornar possível a sua concretização, assim como a consulta de artigos 

publicados, onde se recolheram 122 espécies do filo Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda, e 

Echinodermata, o uso da batimetria multifeixe e da refletividade do fundo do mar (backscatter) 

com o intuito de se obter informação espacial detalhada sobre as estruturas em estudo, a 

localização geográfica, a distância das falhas SWIM e a sua associação com os vulcões de lama, 

e a examinação das correntes oceanográficas locais. Das espécies em estudo, 29 são 

quimiotróficas (18 da classe Poliqueta e 11 da classe Bivalvia) e 93 heterotróficas (17 da ordem 

Tanaidacea, 16 da classe Ophiuroidea, 56 da classe Gastropoda e 3 da classe Bivalvia). As 

espécies heterotróficas incluem todos os organismos que obtêm energia para o seu metabolismo 

a partir de fontes de carbono orgânico, em oposição encontram-se as espécies autotróficas que 

fixam o carbono inorgânico usando a luz do sol (fotoautotróficos) ou energia química 

(quimioautotróficos). Os seres quimioautotróficos (neste trabalho denominados de 

quimiotróficos), devido à ausência de luz, são os únicos organismos a habitarem o fundo do mar. 

Estes organismos normalmente vivem em fontes hidrotermais, fontes frias e outros ambientes 

redutores, e podem ser, ou não, simbiontes. As fontes hidrotermais, na sua maioria, estão 

localizadas ao longo do oceano onde fluidos a elevadas temperaturas se libertam do fundo do mar. 

Estas podem ser distinguidas entre dois tipos principais: as fumarolas negras e as brancas. As 

fumarolas negras emitem colunas de fumo quente, por volta dos 370 ºC, e são compostas por 

partículas pretas e finas de sulfureto. Este fluido mistura-se rapidamente com a água de fundo 

(bottom water) rica em oxigénio, resultante da precipitação de grandes quantidades de sulfureto 

e silicato, formando assim as chaminés hidrotermais. No geral, as fumarolas brancas encontram-

se nas margens dos montes e descarga de fluidos, exibindo temperaturas entre os 265 e 300 ºC. 

Devido as suas baixas temperaturas, quando comparadas com as fumarolas negras, as fumarolas 

brancas estão incrustadas de tubos de vermes e outos organismos. As fontes frias são sistemas 

geológico e geoquímico ativos localizados onde o enxofre e o metano reduzido emergem dos 



 

vi 

 

sedimentos do fundo do mar, que se formam devido à migração ascendente de hidrocarbonetos 

dissolvidos e/ou gasosos. As fontes frias ocorrem nas margens passivas e ativas do mundo inteiro 

e apresentam uma grande variação temporal e espacial de fluxo. As suas expressões superficiais 

incluem vulcões de lama, pockmarks, piscinas de água salgada, óleo e infiltrações de asfalto, 

sendo os vulcões de lama e os pockmarks os mais comuns. 

 Os dados utilizados neste trabalho foram compilados a partir da bibliografia mais 

relevante sobre a macrofauna dos vulcões de lama do Golfo de Cádis, incluindo vários artigos 

publicados recentemente (Dworschak and Cunha 2007; Génio et al. 2008, 2013; Hilário and 

Cunha 2008; Rodrigues et al. 2008; Bla?ewicz-Paszkowycz et al. 2011a, 2011b; Oliver et al. 

2011; Rodrigues et al. 2011, 2013). As amostras foram recolhidas utilizando diferentes 

equipamentos (p.e.: Gravity Corer - GC, FLUFO Lander - FLUFO, USNEL Box Corer - USNEL, 

Multi Corer - MUC, Geology Dredge - GD, Kasten Corer - KC, BIGO Lander - BIGO, TV-Grab 

- Gr, Suction Sampler ROV - SUS, Push Corer ROV - PUC, NIOZ Box Corer - NIOZ) 

dependendo do objetivo específico da cada campanha, da natureza geológica do fundo do mar 

amostrado e da disponibilidade de equipamentos do navio.  

No ArcMap, o componente principal do ArcGis (Sistema de Informação Geográfico) foi 

criada uma base de dados geográfica usando-se o ArcCatalog, de nome Biodata, para armazenar 

todos os dados espaciais e tabulares. Os dados foram organizados em layers: Feature Classes e 

Raster Dataset, dando origem aos mapas utilizados ao longo desde trabalho. Todos os mapas 

foram projetados utilizando-se o sistema de coordenadas UTM Zona 29N Datum WGS84. 

No total foram analisadas 122 espécies recolhidas em 105 estações, 18 pertencem à 

família Siboglinidae (filo Annelida, classe Polychaeta), 14 à classe Bivalvia (filo Mollusca), 56 à 

classe Gastropoda (filo Mollusca), 17 à ordem Tanaidacea (filo Arthropoda, Subfilo Crustacea, 

classe Malacostraca), uma à ordem Decapoda (filo Arthropoda, subfilo Crustacea, classe 

Malacostraca) e 16 à classe Ophiuroidea (filo Echinodermata). No Golfo de Cádis, a maior 

concentração de espécies encontra-se a pouca profundidade (200 a 1200 m) e estão 

maioritariamente localizadas nos vulcões de lama. As espécies heterotróficas foram encontradas 

na maioria das estruturas em estudo, com exceção do vulcão de lama Semenovich. Este resultado 

está de acordo com o esperado, uma vez que os organismos heterotróficos apresentam uma 

distribuição global. O número de espécies heterotróficas diminui com o aumento da profundidade, 

possivelmente devido à escasses de alimento. A via nutricional dominante dentro dos organismos 

quimiotróficos é a thiotrophy, o que acontece devido à elevada disponibilidade de enxofre na 

forma de sulfureto ou enxofre nas áreas de infiltração de metano no Golfo de Cádis. As espécies 

metanotróficas apenas se encontram em dois vulcões, Mercator (351 m) e Captain Arutyunov 

(1324 m), o que indica que o sistema biogeoquímico no Golfo de Cádis é possivelmente dominado 

por enxofre. A elevada concentração de espécies quimiotróficas ocorre em vulcões de lama 

localizados nas falhas SWIM 1 e SWIM 2, a uma profundidade superior a 1220 metros, o que 

sugere que estas falhas agem preferencialmente como condutas de fluidos, alimentando essas 

espécies. De uma forma geral, as infiltrações de metano são especialmente comuns e ativas a 

profundidades entre os 500 e os 1000 metros, em que a temperatura e a pressão combinam para 

desestabilizar os hidratos de gás, mas no Golfo de Cádis esta profundidade pode aumentar devido 

à influência da água quente vinda do Mediterrâneo (Mediterranean Outflow Water). A maior 

limitação deste trabalho foi a diferença existente entre o esforço de amostragem, que se 

encontrava entre uma e 19 estações.

ABSTRACT 

The Gulf of Cadiz is located in a complex tectonic area of the North-East Atlantic Ocean, west of 

Gibraltar Strait, offshore SW Iberia and NW Morocco. It straddles across the Africa-Eurasia lithospheric 

plate boundary, defined by the SWIM strike-slip faults, where presently tectonic activity is occurring. 

This tectonic activity is reflected in fluid escape structures on the seabed: pockmarks, diapiric ridges, 

carbonate mud mounds and mud volcanoes. The exhalation of geological fluids allows for the existence 

of biological chemosynthetic communities on the mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz. The main goal 

of this work is to understand the influence of the SWIM faults and mud volcanoes on the distribution of 

macrofauna. This study was based on published records of 122 species of the Phyla Annelida, Mollusca, 

Arthropoda, and Echinodermata, spatial information extracted from detailed swath bathymetry and 

backscatter, geographic localization, distance to the SWIM faults and association to mud volcanoes and 

inspection of the local oceanographic currents. 

 The data used in this work was compiled from the most relevant bibliography on the fauna 

observed in the Gulf of Cadiz mud volcanoes, including several recently published articles (Dworschak 

and Cunha 2007; Génio et al. 2008, 2013; Hilário and Cunha 2008; Rodrigues et al. 2008; Bla?ewicz-

Paszkowycz et al. 2011a, 2011b; Oliver et al. 2011; Rodrigues et al. 2011, 2013). The samples were 

obtained using different gears depending namely on the specific objectives of each campaign, on the 

geological nature of the sampled seafloor, and on the ship equipment availability. 

Using the ArcMap, a comprehensive geodatabase was created using ArcCatalog to store all the 

spatial and tabular data. The data was organized in layers: Feature Classes land Raster Dataset, which 

allowed to create the final maps. In total 122 species were analysed from 105 stations, 18 belong to the 

Family Siboglinidae (Phylum Annelida, Class Polychaeta), 14 to the Class Bivalvia (Phylum Mollusca), 

56 to the Class Gastropoda (Phylum Mollusca), 17 to the Order Tanaidacea (Phylum Arthropoda, Sub-

Phylum Crustacea, Class Malacostraca), one to the Order Decapoda (Phylum Arthropoda, Sub-Phylum 

Crustacea, Class Malacostraca) and 16 to the Class Ophiuroidea (Phylum Echinodermata).  

In general, the higher concentrations of species in the Gulf of Cadiz occur at low depths, from 

200 to 1200 m and are mostly located in the mud volcanoes. The heterotrophic species were found in 

most of the studied features of the Gulf of Cadiz, except in Semenovich MV, as expected, since they 

occur globally. The number of these species decreases with depth probably because the available food 

also becomes scarcer. The thiotrophy is the dominant nutritional pathway of the chemotrophic species. 

It occurs due to the high availability of sulfur in the form of sulfide or sulfur in the methane seepage 

areas of the Gulf of Cadiz. Therefore these species only occur in mud volcanoes, except in Pen Duick 

Escarpment. The methanotrophic species are only located in two mud volcanoes, Mercator (351 m) and 

Captain Arutyunov (1324 m), which indicates that the biogeochemical system in the Gulf of Cadiz is 

probably dominated by sulfur. The highest concentration of chemotrophic species occur in mud 

volcanoes located on the SWIM 1 and SWIM 2 faults at water depths ? 1200 m. Thus suggesting that 

these faults act as preferential fluid conduits, feeding those species. In general, the methane seeps are 

especially common and active at water depths of 500–1000 m, where temperature and pressure combine 

to destabilize gas hydrates (Hester and Brewer, 2009), but in the Gulf of Cadiz this depth may be greater 

owing to the influence of the warmer Mediterranean Outflow Water (Niemann et al. 2006; Sommer et 

al. 2009).

Introduction 

1.1. Motivation and objectives 

The Gulf of Cadiz has been studied extensively since the 1970ies from a geological, 

oceanographic and biological point of view for various reasons, such as: 

- It straddles across the Africa-Eurasia lithospheric plate boundary, defined by the South West 

Iberia Margin (SWIM) strike-slip faults, where the Alpine orogeny terminate; 

- It is the locus of important mega-seismicity, like the 1755 Lisbon earthquake; 

- It is a gulf where various Atlantic currents come together and meet the Mediterranean Outflow 

Water; 

- Biological chemosynthetic communities associated with the exhalation of geological fluids 

have been found in the last two decades, only. 

 

The mud volcanoes in the Gulf the Cadiz have been studied for the past two decades and it has 

been found that they host chemosynthetic species associated with cold seeps that depend on methane 

and sulphate.  The motivation for this work is trying to understand if there is a relationship between the 

geologic substrate, environmental conditions and the distribution of the macrofauna. 

Thus, the main goal of this work is to understand the influence of the SWIM faults and the mud 

volcanoes on the distribution of macrofauna in the Gulf of Cadiz. This study was based on published 

records of 122 species of the Phyla Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda, and Echinodermata, spatial 

information extracted from detailed swath bathymetry and backscatter, geographic localization, distance 

to the SWIM faults and association to mud volcanoes and inspection of the local oceanographic currents.  

In order to achieve this scientific goal the following technical tasks were carried out: 

1. Construction of a database including the compilation of all biological information available 

in published scientific papers; 

2. Using the ArcGIS software as a study tool in order to analyse the spatial distribution 

of macrofauna in the Gulf of Cadiz; 

3. Analyse the macrofauna species distribution according to their metabolic strategy, 

geographic distribution and depth; 

4. Analyse the distribution of the macrofauna as a function of the distance to the SWIM faults 

and to mud volcanoes.

This dissertation is organized in the following sixth chapters: 

First Chapter - Introduction  

The thesis presents an introduction (this chapter) about the fluid circulation and seepage in 

sedimentary basins, the geophysic data, the submarine mud volcanoes, the general context of the Gulf 

of Cadiz and the Trophic Status.  

Second Chapter – Regional Setting 

The second chapter describes the main environmental drivers of the biological assemblages 

studied in this work: the oceanographic circulation in the Gulf of Cadiz and the existence of major right-

lateral strike-slip faults (the so called SWIM faults).  

Third Chapter – Study Areas 

The third chapter presents all study areas within the Gulf of Cadiz in which macrofauna species 

were reported to occur: the El Arraiche Field, the Carbonate Province. The geologic and biologic

of taxa distribution.    

Sixth and Seventh Chapters – Discussion and Conclusion 

The sixth chapter concerns the discussion of the obtained results, and the seventh chapter the 

consequent main conclusions.  

 

1.3. Fluid Circulation and Seepage in Sedimentary Basins 

The chemoautotrophs, because of the absence of light, are the only autotrophic organisms in the 

deep sea (see subchapter 1.7). These organisms usually inhabit hydrothermal vents, cold seeps and 

other reducing environments and can be free-living or symbiotic. Since cold vents are so far the only 

source of crustal fluids exalted into the shallow sediments and to the seafloor in the study area, these 



 

3 

 

systems are have described in more detail as well as the origin of methane, the main energy source for 

chemotrophic species at these depths. 

 

1.3.1. Hot Vents 

The seafloor seepage can be distinguished in two categories, Hot Vents (Hydrothermal Vents) 

and Cold Seeps. Hot Vents, in its majority, are located along the ocean spreading centres where high 

temperature fluids escape from the seafloor (Damm, 1990). Asthenospheric upwelling brings the mantle 

rocks up to the surface. As a result, the lithostatic pressure decreases, allowing adiabatic fusion of part 

of the mantle rocks. The resulting magmatic fluid of this partial fusion (primary magma) feeds the 

oceanic ridges' typical volcanism. This volcanism, drastically, modifies the geothermal gradient. The 

geothermal gradient variation promotes water convention through the oceanic crust rocks (i.e.: Basalts).  

In contact with the oceanic crust rocks, the seawater heats up to 300-400°C and becomes extremely 

corrosive. This hot fluid dissolves the surrounding basaltic rock, leaching out metals and other elements. 

The fluid begins rising rapidly back to the surface due to increased pressure, being responsible for 

the occurrence of fluid seepage at the sea floor (Hot Vents). Two main types of hot venting systems, can 

be distinguish, the black or the white smokers (Figure 1.1 and 1.2). The black smokers emit hot plumes 

(~370ºC) loaded with fine, dark particles of sulphide material. This fluid is quickly mixed with the 

ambient oxic bottom water, resulting in the precipitation of bulk sulphide and silicate minerals, forming 

hydrothermal vent chimneys (Kelley, 2001; Gartman et al. 2014). The white smokers are, in general 

located on the margins of the mounds and discharge fluids exhibiting temperatures between 265 and 

300 °C. Due to their relatively lower temperatures, when compared with the black smokers, the white 

smokers are typically encrusted with worm tubes and other organisms. Their venting fluids are white 

because the white barium and calcium sulphate (BaSO4 + CaSO4) minerals precipitates (Libes, 1992; 

Kelley, 2001).  

 

1.3.2. Cold Seeps 

 Cold seeps form due to upward migration of hydrocarbons, dissolved and/or gaseous (Fischer 

et al. 2012; Sauer et al. 2015). These geologically and geochemically active systems (Omoregie et al. 

2009) are found where reduced sulfur and methane emerge from seafloor sediments (Levin, 2005). They 

occur worldwide (Figure 1.3) at passive and active continental margins and show strong temporal and 

spatial variations in the flux (Fischer et al. 2012; Sauer et al. 2015). The cold seeps surface expressions 

include mud volcanoes, pockmarks, brine pools, oil and asphalt seeps, being the mud volcanoes and 

pockmarks the most common (Petersen and Dubilier, 2009). The Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of Cadiz (the 

most extensive cold seepage area known along the different European margins; Dworschak and Cunha, 

2007; Hilário and Cunha, 2008; Rodrigues et al. 2008), the continental margins of India, the western 

African margin and the Eastern Mediterranean, are examples of passive margins prone of cold seepage 

(Omoregie et al. 2009; Wenau, 2013). These active seafloor systems often host dense and 

diverse microbial and faunal communities fuelled by low temperature fluids (when compared with the 

hot vents) and by gas emissions to the sea floor (Omoregie et al. 2009; Petersen and Dubilier, 2009; 

Wenau, 2013). The typical temperatures of the cold seep are close to the temperature of the bottom sea 

water where they occur.

1.3.3. Methane formation  

In the earth´s crust, the methane is very abundant and it is often found to be related with fluid 

flow features and gas hydrate formation. In seabed sediments there are three possible sources of 

methane: thermogenic, abiogenic and microbial (as specified above). 

Methane seepage occurs when the amount of organic matter contents in the sediments are 

sufficient to allow the generation of high volumes of methane within the sedimentary column and the 

features that facilitate the methane migration towards the seafloor are present. The escape of fluids, such 

as methane from the seafloor is a consistent feature throughout geologic time, as documented by both 

seismic surveys and seepage outcrops (Judd, 2003).

1.3.3.1. Thermogenic Methane 

The thermogenic methane occurs when the organic matter that is not degraded by methanogenic 

microbes within the top 1000 m of the sedimentary column is buried and can be degraded by 

thermocatalystic processes. The organic matter that survives the burial is transformed into amorphous 

organic matter (kerogen), under the influence of increasing temperature and pressure. The kerogen 

undergoes thermal cracking, while burial increases, which leads to the formation of various 

hydrocarbons compounds with solid, liquid and gaseous fractions. The most abundant and mobile 

molecule formed is the methane, since it has the simplest and the smallest molecule size, therefore it is 

the most prone to migrate to the seabed (Judd, 2001). 

 

1.3.3.2. Abiogenic Methane  

Abiogenic methane (or abiotic) is formed by chemical reactions (carbon dioxide reduction; 

Lollar et al. 2002) that do not directly include organic matter (Etiope and Lollar, 2013). The most 

commonly invoked reaction for abiotic hydrocarbons generation is the Fischer–Tropsch type reaction 

that converts CO2 to hydrocarbon gas by reacting it with H2 (Potter et al., 2004; 2013; Cao et al., 2014): 

???2 + (3? + 1)2 ? ???2?+2 + 2??2?                                           Equation 1.1  

 

Methane (CH4) is produced when ? = 1: 

 

              ??2 + 4?2 ? ??4 + 2?2?                                                                  Equation 1.2 

 

The hydrothermal alteration of Fe-rich minerals, at temperatures above 200ºC, is one of the 

possible origins of the H2 required for the reaction (Potter et al. 2004; Tassi et al. 2012). This process 

occur during the magma cooling, during the serpentinizations of ultramafic rocks (e.g. the 

serpentinization of olivine in ultramafic rocks will generate magnetite and H2, which contributed to the 

elevated CH4 and H2 concentrations in hydrothermal fluids venting from submarine ultramafic-hosted 

systems, fumarolic gases of volcanoes and in fluid inclusions in alkaline complexes; Lollar et al. 2002; 

Cao et al., 2014) and more commonly in hydrothermal systems during water-rocks interactions (Lollar 

et al. 2002). 

 

1.3.3.3. Microbial Methane 

The decomposition of organic matter, realized by microbial activity (e.g.: methanogenic 

archaea), at small burial depths under low temperature and pressure conditions, originated the microbial 

methane (Judd, 2001; Moore and Wade, 2013). In the oceans, the most of the organic matter available 

is generated through photosynthesis by primary producers (autotrophs organisms; see subchapter 1.7) 



 

8 

 

and after the dead of the organisms, settles through the water column. The organic matter is oxidized in 

the uppermost oxygen-rich layer of the sedimentary column (the top few millimetres or centimetres of 

the sediments) as long as oxygen is available. In the anoxic environment immediately below the oxygen 

rich zone, oxidation stops and the organic matter is buried and may be decomposed anaerobically. This 

is a very complex process and the final steps of it may be summarized by the following equation 

representing the formaldehyde decomposition into methane and carbon dioxide by the action of 

methanogenic microbes: 

 

2??2? ? ??4 + ??2                                                                                              Equation 1.3 

 

1.3.4. Gas Hydrates  

Gas hydrates are crystalline solids formed from water and hydrocarbon gases under low 

temperature and high-pressure conditions (Figure 1.4; Léon et al. 2009). The water molecules form 

cages containing guest molecules such as methane and other light hydrocarbons (ethane, propane, butane 

and pentane; Grauls, 2001). They are common worldwide in sediments of continental margins at water 

depths exceeding 300 m (Léon et al. 2009). The methane hydrate is the most common hydrate form in 

the marine sediments (Schmidt et al. 2005) but clathrates of carbon dioxide or sulphide may also occur 

(Arvo, 2014). Gas hydrates are considered by the scientific community as the main hydrocarbon source 

for the coming century, as resources account for 50 % of the total organic carbon in the earth or twice 

the conventional fossil fuel energy (Grauls, 2001).

1.4. Geophysical Data 

To pursue the present study, it was mandatory to discuss the different geophysical data and 

methods, such as swath bathymetry, seismic reflection and backscatter, based on which the morphologic 

features of the Gulf of Cadiz were found and described. 

 

1.4.1. Bathymetry 

The swath bathymetry is an important acoustic tool to investigate the seafloor morphology. It 

characterizes the seafloor topography and allows the interpretation of the geomorphology of the 

seafloor. Therefore it is used to identify the mud volcanoes and define the settings where the macrofauna 

occurs. 

 

1.4.2. Seismic Reflection 

The seismic reflection method is based on the fact that the acoustic signals propagates in the 

water column and in the sub-seafloor, and are reflected by interfaces between media with different 

acoustic impedance resultant mainly from differences in density between the two rocks or sediments. 

Seismic reflection data corresponds therefore to an acoustic vertical 2D image of the structure and the 

stratigraphic layers under the seabed. This method depends on the generation and detection of acoustic 

waves that are mechanically generated. When the seismic reflection profiles are of very high resolution 

they may image fluid channels within faults and mud volcanoes allowing a better interpretation of the 

cold seeps systems. 

 

1.4.3. Backscatter 

The backscatter data consist of a measurement of the intensity and characteristics of the echoes 

returns from the sound pulses at the seafloor. The backscatter signal depends on the physical nature of 

the seafloor, the frequency and angle used and orientation of the illuminated surface. Acoustic 

backscatter data are used for classifying seafloor characteristics. A weak return signal (low intensity) 

indicates a soft bottom substrate, while a strong return signal (high intensity) indicates a hard bottom 

substrate. 

Chemosynthetic cold seep communities and authigenic carbonate may cause an acoustic 

impedance and roughness clearly distinct than the surrounding normal seafloor. Therefore, acoustic 

backscatter data (high backscatter) can be used to identify the distribution of potential seeps sites. 

Acoustic anomalies at the sea-floor morphology can be detected with side-scan sonars mounted on 

submersibles, ROVs, or towed vehicles, which can mark the location of gas seeps (e.g.: mud volcanoes 

and pockmarks; Naudts et al. 2008; Orange et al. 2002).

1.5. Submarine Mud Volcanoes 

Submarine Mud Volcanoes (MVs) are sedimentary structures on the seafloor created by the 

rapid advection of fluid and methane-saturated muds from over-pressured sediment layers deep beneath 

the seafloor (Vanneste et al. 2012). They are formed when a mud rich material with clasts and other 

fluids reaches the seafloor, where extrusive features (such as mud flows, craters, gryphons, mud pools 

or salses) are formed. The material extruded from the MVs is composed of a fluidized mixture of 

sediments dominated by clays, liquids and gases that, in general, incorporate rock fragments (e.g.: clasts) 

pulled up from the pierced sedimentary sections (Magalhães, 2007). Although marly clay and salt 

diapirism are considered important in the formation of the MVs, seismic profile analysis and 

geochemical data indicate that mud volcanism in the Gulf of Cadiz is fault-controlled (Nuzzo et al. 

2009; Vanneste et al. 2013), since some of the MVs are located along major WNW-SE and ENE-SW 

trending faults (Pinheiro et al. 2003).  

In general the MVs occur along the world´s oceans (Figure 1.5; Vanneste et al. 2011). Fifty of 

these were confirmed by coring (Medialdea et al. 2009) on the Iberian and Moroccan margins (Pinheiro 

et al. 2003; Vanneste et al. 2013), because on this area we have a relatively thick sedimentary succession 

in which the diagenetic and compaction processes generate significant amount of overpressure and fluids 

(water and hydrocarbons) and in which the tectonic setting with faults promotes the seepage of these 

fluids (Vanneste et al. 2012). They are defined as conical shape positive morphological features in 

relation to the regional morphology, with a central feeder chimney or conduit and extrusive features 

such as mud flows (Cordes et al. 2010; Vanneste et al. 2012). The MVs are in water depths ranging 

from 200 to 4000 m (Cunha et al. 2013), with a diameter between 800 to 4000 m and up to 200 m height 

(Vannest et al. 2011; Vanneste et al. 2013). These MVs show considerable variations in morphology, 

dimension and composition of erupted material and fluids (Pinheiro et al. 2003; Van Rensbergen et al. 

2005b). The MVs situated in the deeper areas of the Gulf of Cadiz are under the influence of deep 

Atlantic water masses, in turn the shallower mud volcanoes are strongly influenced by the Mediterranean 

Outflow Water (Pinheiro et al. 2003; Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b). 

The MVs usually occur in petroliferous regions. Their seepage fluids are mainly solutions 

enriched by hydrocarbon gases (particularly CH4), hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and petroleum 

products and their escape is expressed in the sea floor by positive reliefs such as mounds or cones 

(Stadnitskaia et al. 2006). MVs are active during short periods of time (ranging from hours up to years) 

that intercalate with, in general, longer periods of dormancy that typically vary between hundreds to  

thousands of years (Vanneste et al. 2012). The study of authigenic carbonates is one way to evaluate the 

long-term variation in carbon fluxes, which precipitate from the ascending fluids and are generally well 

preserved in the geological record (Vanneste et al. 2012). In general, gas and fluid seepage activity at 

the MVs is considered to be moderate with advection velocities up to 15 cm yr-1. However the presence 

of methane-derived authigenic carbonates throughout the Gulf of Cadiz suggests several episodes of 

extensive methane seepage in the past (Vanneste et al. 2012). 

The first Mud Volcano was discovered and sampled in Gulf of Cadiz in 1999 (Pinheiro et al. 

2003; Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b) during the Training Through Research (TTR) 9 cruise (Pinheiro et 

al. 2003), of Research Vessel (R/V) Professor Logachev which were carried out within the framework 

of the UNESCO/IOC ‘Floating University’ Programme (Stadnitskaia et al. 2006) and since then have 

been extensively investigated during several research cruises (e.g.: TTR 10, Anastasya, TTR 11, TTR 

11A, Tasyo, Cadipor, TTR 12, GAP, TTR 14, Merian Cruise, Darwin Cruise, TTR 15, TTR 16, TTR

et al. 2007; Ivanov et al. 2010).  

 

1.6. The Gulf of Cadiz – General Context 

The Gulf of Cadiz is a wide marine basin located in a complex tectonic area of the North-East 

Atlantic Ocean, west of Gibraltar Strait, offshore SW Iberia and NW Morocco (Figure 1.6; Navarro et 

al. 2006; Duarte et al. 2009; Rosas et al. 2009; Duarte, 2011; Vanneste et al. 2011). It is positioned on 

the transition area between the Gloria transform fault zone delineating the African-Eurasian plate 

boundary in the Atlantic, and the Western-most part of the Alpine-Mediterranean orogenic belt, marked 

by the Gibraltar (or Betic-Rif) Arc (León et al. 2006; Stadnitskaia et al. 2006; Vanneste et al. 2011). 

The region is seismically active and is thought to host the epicentre of the famous 8.5 to 8.7 (Johnston, 

1996) magnitude 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake that originated a devastating tsunami and decimated 

the city of Lisbon, Portugal (Hensen et al. 2007; Duarte, 2011). It was the largest tsunami ever 

experienced in Western Europe (Zitellini et al. 2009).

During the Late Cretaceous and Tertiary, the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean induced the 

divergence of North America and Eurasia, in parallel with the convergence of Africa and Eurasia 

(Figure 1.7). The African continent was diverted to north causing the progressive closure of oceanic 

basins of the Tethys Ocean and the rapid propagation to west of the Alpine, Betic–Rif orogenic collision 

front in the Gulf of Cadiz, at the same time that the western Mediterranean basin development 

(Maldonado et al. 1999). 

The Gibraltar Arc was formed due the convergence between Africa and Eurasia plates. The 

convergence caused the narrowing of the East-West oceanic corridor between Africa and Iberia and led 

to the collision of the Alboran terrane (that was migrating almost unimpeded towards the Atlantic Ocean, 

in the Middle Miocene) with the SE Iberia and NW Africa (see Figure 1.7 - C; Duarte, 2011). The 

Gibraltar Arc migrated west dragged by the roll back of the subducted Gibraltar oceanic slab. At the 

same time as the Gulf Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (GCAW; a high rugosity sedimentary slope with an 

undulating surface morphology; Gutscher et al. 2008) formed as a consequence of rollback subduction 

of the Tethyan slab beneath Gibraltar (Duarte, 2011; Duarte et al. 2011; see Figure 1.7 - D) on top of 

basement faults (nowadays the SWIM faults). 

According to Duarte et al. 2011, the formation of the SWIM faults can be associated with the 

opening of the Tethys Ocean. The SWIM basement faults were probably inactive during Middle 

Miocene times, although capable of originating a linear-like perturbation in the GCAW surface 

morphology. At the same time, the convergence between Iberia and Africa gradually suffered a 

counterclockwise rotation, shifting from N–S (see Figure 1.7 - B) to near WNW–ESE (see Figure 1.7 

- E). This rotation triggered a dextral strike-slip reactivation of the basement (SWIM) faults (see Figure 

1.7 - F) during a period in which the subduction driving the GCAW growth was slowing down. 

 

1.7. Trophic Status 

 The macrofauna species studied in this work were analysed according to their metabolic 

strategy (chapter 5). Given this criteria and the following detailed explanation such species can be 

classified as autotrophic or heterotrophic. A second level of classification considers the type of 

symbiotic relationship between the deep-sea invertebrate host and its methanotrophic and/or thiotrophic 

bacteria (see below).  

Heterotrophs include all organisms that obtain the energy for their metabolism from organic 

carbon sources in their food (e.g.: all animals, including man, fungi, and many parasitic plants and 

saprophytic angiosperms as well as many microorganisms). In opposition autotrophs fix inorganic 

carbon using sunlight (photoautotrophs) or chemical energy (chemoautotrophs).  

 

1.7.1. Thiotrophy and Methanotrophy 

Symbiotic invertebrates in deep-sea environments derive all or part of their nutrition from microbial 

symbiont metabolism. The organisms that rely partly on chemotrophic nutrition but retain the ability to 



 

15 

 

feed heterotrophically are designated as mixotrophic. Symbiotic associations with thiotrophic or 

methanotrophic bacteria occur in a wide range of animal species that live in reducing environments (e.g.: 

hydrothermal vents, whale falls, sunken wood, cold seeps and sediments; Petersen and Dubilier, 2009). 

In rare cases species harbour both methanotrophic and thiotrophic symbionts, in which case they are 

designated as possessing a dual symbiosis.  

Thiotrophic bacteria can exploit the chemical energy from the oxidation of sulfide or sulfur with 

oxygen or nitrate for their cell metabolism and growth (Grunke et al. 2012) while the methanotrophic 

bacteria utilize methane as a sole carbon and energy source (Hanson et al. 1996). The bivalves with 

sulfide-oxidizing gill symbionts are frequently found in environments that are inhospitable to other 

invertebrates due to a low oxygen (O2) content and the presence of free hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Sulfide-

oxidizing bacteria are involved in symbioses with members of at least five bivalve families, occurring 

intracellularly in Vesicomyidae, Lucinidae, Mytilidae and Solemyidae, and mostly extracellularly in 

Thyasiridae (Rodrigues et al. 2010; Oliver et al. 2011). In addition to the bivalve, others important 

symbiotic seep organisms include siboglinidae polychaetes (vestimentiferan, frenulate and monoliferan 

tubeworms) and sponges (Cladorhizidae).

Regional Setting 

2.1. The oceanographic circulation in the Gulf of Cadiz  

The Atlantic Ocean in Gulf of Cadiz is characterized by three main water masses (Eastern North 

Atlantic Central Water, North Atlantic Deep Water and Mediterranean Outflow Water; Figure 2.1) with 

different characteristics of salinity, temperature, oxygen content and current velocities. Hence, a 

combination of water circulation, chemically reduced habitat and trophic input will determine the 

benthic communities of this region (Blazewicz-Paszkowycz et al. 2011a).  

 

2.1.1. Eastern North Atlantic Central Water  

The North Atlantic Central Water (NACW) is located at the main thermocline of the North 

Atlantic Ocean (Pollard et al. 1996) and is characterized by an almost linear decrease of potential 

temperature (16.0?C to 12.5?C) and salinity (36.25 to 35.50 ‰; Alves et al. 2011) with depth. This body 

of water, in the upper 500 – 1000 m of the ocean (Pollard et al. 1996), is influenced by the mix of several 

waters (Cianca et al. 2009), the Mediterranean Water, the Antarctic Intermediate Water and the Labrador 

Sea Water (Mauritzen et al. 2001). The NACW, in the eastern North Atlantic, is more saline (usually 

by less than 0.1 ‰ at constant temperature) than in the western North Atlantic, due to the influence of 

Mediterranean Water (Pollard et al. 1996; Mauritzen et al. 2001). The Eastern North Atlantic Central 

Waters (ENACW) can be subdivided in two types as an exchange result of water and heat within the 

thermocline (Padin et al. 2011): the eastern North Atlantic central water subtropical (ENACWt) and the 

eastern North Atlantic central water subpolar (ENACWp). The ENACWt range from 12.2 to 18.5 °C 

and from 35.66 to 36.75 ‰ and its origin was located in a front near the Azores. The ENACWp is 

formed at the eastern flank of the North Atlantic Current, approximately north of Cape Finisterre (43ºN) 

and corresponds to water between 4 and 12 °C and between 34.96 and 35.66 ‰ (Bode et al. 2002; Padin 

et al. 2011). Besides the thermohaline differences, ENACWp and ENACWt also show different 

chemical properties due to changes in ventilation rates and remineralization of organic matter. In this 

way, the ENACWt is a nutrient-poor water whereas ENACWp is characterized by high nutrient levels 

mainly due to deep winter MLD (mixed layer depth) in the formation region (Padin et al. 2011).

2.1.2. Mediterranean Outflow Water  

The Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW), results from the exchange of water masses between 

the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean (Mulder et al. 2009), North Atlantic Surface Water (0 – 

100 m) and North Atlantic Central Water (100 – 700 m; Toucanne et al. 2007; Singh et al. 2015). It is 

an energetic, saline (38 ‰) and warm (13 °C) water mass (Figure 2.2; Toucanne et al. 2007; Mulder et 

al. 2009; Bozec et al. 2011; Khélifi et al. 2014) moving from the SE to the NW along the middle slope 

(which is formed by four relatively flat terraces with gradients of less than 0.5°, at average depths of 

500, 675, 750 and 850 m; Figure 2.3) between 500 and 1200 m water depth above the NADW (García 

et al. 2009). This independent strong contour current enters the Gulf of Cadiz at depths of 250 – 300 m 

with a western trend and velocities of up to 250 cm s-1 (García et al. 2009; Mulder et al. 2009). The 

main MOW current divides into two main currents that flow along the seabed at water depths of 300 – 

1400 m, the Mediterranean Upper Water (MU) and the Mediterranean Lower Water (ML; see Figure 

2.1; Mulder et al. 2009).  The MU represents the upper, less dense (salinity is 37.07 ‰), warm (13.7 

°C) core that flows at the base of the upper Spanish and Portuguese continental slopes at depths of 300 

– 600 m. Its average velocity is 0.46 ms-1. The ML constitutes the lower, more saline (salinity is 37.42 

‰) current that forms the main MOW. Its mean temperature is 13.6 °C, is centred between 600 – 1400 

m and its velocity range between 0.2 and 0.3 m s-1 (Mulder et al. 2009). The ML, splits into three minor 

branches (Mulder et al. 2009), the Southern Branch (SB), the Principal Branch (PB) and the Intermediate 

Branch (IB; see Figure 2.1, Garcia et al. 2009), each one of which follows its own deep channel (Mulder 

et al. 2009). They return to join at 8,333º W and leave the Gulf of Cadiz towards the west Iberian margin 

and central north-Atlantic (Garcia et al. 2009).  

 

Figure 2.2 – The temperature and salinity of three masses of water, NACW, MOW and NADW. The 

presence of the MOW, carrying slightly warmer and saltier water is clearly evident in the 600 to 1200 m 
depth range (Hansen et al. 2012).

Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW), and Denmark Straits Overflow Water (DSOW; Van Sebille 

et al. 2011). It is a cold (3 – 8 ºC) and less saline (34.95 – 35.5 ‰) water mass that flows at depths &gt; 

1500 m from the Greenland–Norwegian Sea region towards the south. In the Gulf of Cadiz, the NADW 

is joined by part of the saltier but warmer MOW. This mixture flows southwards down the eastern part 

of the Atlantic Ocean (Knauss, 1978; see Figure 2.1 and 2.2). 

 

 2.2. SWIM Faults  

The morphology of the Gulf of Cadiz is largely controlled by the main tectonic processes in the 

area, namely the thrust faults (reverse faults) accommodated in the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge 

(GCAW) and the wrenching associated to the South West Iberian Margin (SWIM) fault system (Duarte 

et al. 2011). In addition to the accretionary wedge, the thrust faults are also accommodated in other 

structures as the Horseshoe Thrust Fault, the Marquês de Pombal Fault, Gorringe Bank and the Tagus 

Abyssal Plain (although this last one is out of the Gulf of Cadiz strict domain; see Figure 2.4; Rosas et 

al. 2012). 

The SWIM lineaments are faults (the SWIM faults) corresponding to a set of WNW – ESE 

trending, vertical right-lateral strike–slip faults, in agreement to the observation and interpretation of 

several seismic profiles and swath bathymetry that cross cut these features (Rosas et al. 2009; Terrinha 

et al. 2009, Zitellini et al. 2009; Duarte et al. 2011). These lineaments are described by six a hundred-

kilometer long linear bathymetric expression and extend from the easternmost part of the GCAW until 

the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain, south of the Gorringe submarine mountain (Gorringe Bank; see Figure 

2.4; Duarte et al. 2009; Rosas et al. 2012).  

The SWIM Fault Zone is located between the western and eastern ends of two well-established 

plate boundaries, the Gloria Fault and the Rif-Tell fault and forms the southern boundary of the main 

seismically and tectonically active area of the Gulf of Cadiz (Zitellini et al. 2009). The morphologic 

expression of the SWIM faults corresponds to a continuous alignment of seafloor crests and troughs 

(valleys), corresponding to fold crests and fault traces in the Holocene sediments (Zitellini et al. 2009), 

sometimes exhibiting an en echelon geometrical disposition, and commonly punctuated by active mud 

volcanoes within the domain of the Accretionary Wedge. This overall linear morphology is more salient 

both in the Horseshoe Valley and close to the northern part of the GCAW front, where lineaments can 

be followed almost continuously for more than 200 km (Duarte et al. 2011). 



 

22 

 

  

The SWIM 1 fault (see Figure 2.4) exhibits an evident morphological expression in the 

Horseshoe Valley and intersects the wedge deformation front to the north of the Coral Patch Ridge. Its 

continuation to the east is less visible, although punctuated by mud volcanoes (Duarte et al. 2011). This 

fault exceeds 600 km, corresponds to a strike-slip fault and can be followed from the Gorringe bank 

southern flank to the Morocco shelf. In some fault segments to the North of the Coral Patch Ridge is 

possible to identify E-W-striking undulations with maximum lengths of about 8 km. These features 

show an en échelon pattern, which corresponds to oriented folds of the recent sedimentary cover, thus 

allowing the establishing of a dextral strike-slip movement (Rosas et al. 2009).  

The SWIM 2 fault (see Figure 2.4), intercepts a northern segment of the GCAW front in the 

proximity of the Sagres Valley. The morphological expression of the SWIM 2, within the thrust wedge 

to the east, is well marked by a slightly arched trough that splays in the same direction (Duarte et al. 

2011). 

The SWIM 3 fault (see Figure 2.4), characterized by several elongated WNW–ESE ridges, 

troughs and slope breaks, cuts along the southern flank of the Coral Patch Ridge, crosses a small portion 

of the Seine Abyssal Plain to the east and intersects the GCAW deformation front (Duarte et al. 2011).

Study Areas 

The mud volcanoes described in this work are organized in three main areas, according to their 

depth and to their geographic settings: the El Arraiche Mud Volcano Field, the Carbonate Province and 

Deep Mud Volcano Field (Figure 3.1). Within the Carbonate Province several morphological features, 

here designated as “Other Features” and that are not mud volcanoes, are described and discussed because 

they host, or have hosted in the past, seepage-related processes. The geologic and biologic characteristics 

of the described features (mud volcanoes and other morphological features) was based solely on the 

information available from published scientific papers and cruise reports.  

The El Arraiche field encompasses several mud volcanoes (Al Idrissi, Fiúza, Gemini, Mercator, 

Lazarillo de Tornes and Kidd) in the shallow Moroccan margin (200 – 600 m). The Carbonate Province, 

pierced by several mud volcanoes (No Name, Anastasya, Pipoca, Tarsis, Meknès, Student, Ginsburg, 

Yuma, Aveiro, Jesus Baraza, Shouen and Darwin) and other features (Channel West of Gibraltar Strait, 

Vernadsky Ridge, Pen Duick Escarpment, Iberico, Formosa Ridge and Cadiz Channel), corresponds to 

an extensive bathymetric strip (600 – 1200 m) along the Moroccan and Spanish margins. The deep-

water field (1200 – 4000 m), mostly within the Portuguese margin, includes several of the most active 

mud volcanoes in the region (Captain Arutyunov, Sagres, Carlos Ribeiro, Bonjardim, Semenovich and 

Porto; Génio et al. 2013; Figure 3.1 and 3.2).

The average thickness of the sedimentary pile in the study areas is, for the purpose of this work, 

assumed to be of about 10 km. Based on reflection seismic data it is also assumed that the SWIM faults 

are, most probably, sub-vertical faults, however in this work it is considered that the they can have a 

minimum dip angle of 45º. Therefore, any MV located at more than 10 km from the fault surface trace 

will not considered as being related with the fault, and the MVs located at less than 10 km from the fault 

are considered as probably being related or controlled by this fault (Figure 3.3). The SWIM 3 fault was 

not studied here in detail since the Semenovich mud volcano is the only one in the vicinity of this fault 

with reported macrofauna data available. Nevertheless, this MV is at a distance greater than 10 km from 

the SWIM 3 fault, while the other two (so far) known nearby mud volcanoes (e.g.: Soloviev and Carlos 

Teixeira; see Figure 3.1), which are at distances &amp;lt;10 km, lack relevant available macrofauna 

information. 

 

3.1. El Arraiche Field  

In May 2002 the El Arraiche Mud Volcano field was discovered during the TTR 12 cruise in 

the Moroccan Atlantic margin in the Gulf of Cadiz. It is constituted by eight mud volcanoes (Kidd, 

Mercator, Al Idrissi, Fiúza, Don Quichote, Lazarillo de Tornes, Gemini and Adamastor), six of them are 

studied in this project (Figure 3.4). The mud volcanoes have variable size and shape just below the shelf 

edge, at a water depth from 200 to 700 m. Al Idrissi is the largest mud volcano, 255 m high and 5400 m 

in diameter. Don Quichote and Lazarillo de Tornes, are the smallest mud volcanoes, only about 25 m 

high (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005a; Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b). The mud volcanoes are situated 

around the ridges on top of normal faults, which constrain the rotated blocks (Figure 3.5; Van 

Rensbergen et al. 2005b; Wehrman et al. 2011), bound by lystric faults (concave normal fault; Vandorpe 

et al. 2014).

The El Arraiche field is part of a larger cluster of mud volcanoes that lie within the GCAW. On 

regional seismic lines this distinction is clear (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b). The El Arraiche mud 

volcanoes, as other mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz, are long-lived structures thought to be related 

to the episodic migration of hydrocarbons. Its mud volcanic activity is estimated to have started 2.4 Ma 

ago (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b; Wehrman et al. 2011) and occurred in several phases (Vandorpe et 

al. 2014).

3.1.1. Al Idrissi  

The Al Idrissi Mud Volcano (see Figure 3.2 and 3.4) discovered during the Cadipor cruise in 

2002 is the largest and the shallowest mud volcano in El Arraiche mud volcano field, situated just below 

the shelf edge in water depths of about 420 m. It appears to be located on a westward plunging anticline 

flank, visible in the bathymetry and on the seismic data (see Figure 3.6; Van Rensbergen et al. 2005a, 

2005b). The MV is 225 m high, up to 5400 m wide at its base and 1500 m wide at the top, with 197 m 

water depth at the top (Table 3.1; Van Rensbergen et al. 2005a, 2005b). It is almost circular at the base 

and has an eye-shaped crater at the top. The crater is up to 17 m deep at the western side, the eastern 

part is occupied by a central dome-shaped elevation; maximum 42 m above the crater floor and the 

flanks of the mud volcano are dominated by down slope mud flows (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b). 

 

3.1.2. Mercator 

The Mercator Mud Volcano (see Figure 3.2) is an asymmetric mud volcano, about 141 m high 

at the southern side, 90 m high on the northern side and only 51 m high on the eastern side, discovered 

during the Cadipor cruise in 2002. It has a maximum diameter of 2450 m at the base and 1100 m at its 

top, at a water depth of 351 m at the top (see Table 3.1). In this case, the slope is characterized by 

concentric steps rather than radial sediment flow deposits. The crater is very shallow, &amp;lt;2 m, but the 

central dome is large, 38 m and forms the caldera of the mud volcano (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005a, 

2005b; Haffert et al. 2013). The MV is situated on the Moroccan continental margin, on an anticline (an 

antiform fold with oldest rocks at its core) formed by the halokinesis of a salt diapir (Figure 37; Haffert 

et al. 2013).  

The MV is one of the shallowest mud volcanoes and differs significantly from the other mud 

volcanoes by the high chloride enrichment of its pore water (Blazewicz-Paszkowycz et al. 2011a; Oliver 

et al. 2011; Rodrigues et al. 2011). The top of Mercator contains patches of disturbed sediments from 

which gas-venting is occasionally observed. Solitary corals (Caryophyllia sp.), accompanied by 

Cidaridae echinoids and Onuphidae polychaetes (Hyalinoecia tubicola) are abundant at the central area 

of the crater (Blazewicz-Paszkowycz et al. 2011a; Oliver et al. 2011; Rodrigues et al. 2011). Lucinoma 

asapheus was found live only at Mercator MV at a water depth of 358 m (Oliver et al. 2011). The 

widespread presence of authigenic carbonates and also extensive Neptunea and Bathymodiolus 

graveyards, usually within the crater of the mud volcanoes, suggest that this was a very active seepage 

area in the past (Oliver et al. 2011).

3.1.3. Fiúza  

The Fiúza is a conic shaped Mud Volcano (Kenyon et al. 2003) discovered during the Cadipor 

cruise in 2002. It is located at the western termination of the Renard Ridge (see Figure 3.4) and possibly 

at the southern continuation of the collapsed depression that hosts the Mercator mud volcano, but no 

faults could be traced in either direction to its location; in agreement with Van Rensbergen et al. 2005a, 

2005b). The MV has a maximum height of 143 m, 2200 m wide at the base and has a flat top 750 m 

wide with a 27 m high central dome of and maximum 700 m wide, with 393 m water depth at the top of 

the mud volcano (see Table 3.1; Kenyon et al. 2003; Van Rensbergen et al. 2005a, 2005b). It is 



 

31 

 

characterized by a series of concentric rims with high backscatter mud flows extending down the flanks, 

and up to 1300 m from the crater (Figure 3.6; Kenyon et al. 2003).  

 

3.1.4. Gemini  

The Gemini Mud Volcano (see Figure 3.2) discovered during the Cadipor cruise in 2002, occurs 

south of the large fault escarpments at the sea floor that bound the southern flank of the Renard Ridge 

(see Figure 3.4), at a water depth of about 423 m at the top. It consists of two mud volcanoes in one 

large oval-shaped mud cone, separated by an almost NS trending faults (see Figure 3.4; Kenyon et al. 

2003; Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b). The entire mud volcano is up to 252 m high, 4100 m long to 2300 

m wide at the base, the maximum diameter at the top of the eastern part (Gemini East) is 1300 m and 

the maximum diameter of the western part (Gemini West) is 900 m (see Table 3.1). The summits of 

both Gemini East and Gemini West consist of a flat crater area with a central dome of respectively 23 

and 27 m above the flat crater area (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b). The differentiation between the two 

summits is visible, from about 80 m below the top of the mud volcano, as 400 m long and 20 m deep 

creases (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005a). The MV is also characterized by typical concentric rims and 

mud flows. Mud flows are especially large at the western side where they extend about 1800 m down 

the slope (Kenyon et al. 2003).  

 

3.1.5. Lazarillo de Tornes  

The Lazarillo de Tornes Mud Volcano (see Figure 3.2) discovered during the Cadipor 

cruise in 2002, is located at the crest of fault blocks on top of the Renard Ridge, and together 

with Don Quichote Mud Volcano constitutes the smallest mud volcanoes of the field. It is only 

500 m wide and 25 m high, at a water depth of about 494 m (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b; see 

Table 3.1).  

 

3.1.6. Kidd 

The Kidd Mud Volcano (see Figure 3.2) discovered during the TTR 09 cruise in 1999, is situated on 

top of the Vernadsky Ridge with the top of the volcano at a water depth of 502 m. The MV is 

approximately 4000 m in diameter and shows an asymmetrically shaped volcanic edifice, with a steep 

SE slope and a gently sloping NW flank. The base of the MV is at a depth of ca. 500 m and its top is at 

ca. 420 m. It is approximately 4000 m wide and its height is situated between 60 and 160 m. The central 

crater has an approximate diameter of 350 m with several concentric rings, defining its central part (Van 

Rensbergen et al. 2005b; Kenyon et al. 2006; see Table 3.1).

3.2.1. Mud Volcanoes  

3.2.1.1. No Name  

The No Name mud volcano discovered during the TTR 09 cruise in 1999, is located between 

TTR MV and the Pen Duick Escapment area (see Figure 3.2), at a water depth of 598 m. This MV is 

approximately 5000 m in diameter, with 598 m water depth at the top of the mud volcano (Table 3.1; 

Kenyon et al. 2000). 

 

3.2.1.2. Anastasya Area (off Tarsis)  

The Anastasya area is constituted by three mud volcanoes: Anastasya, Pipoca and Tarsis (see 

Figure 3.2 - A).  

The Anastasya mud volcano is the most prominent structure, an 80 m cone-shaped 

mound, 1500 m in diameter with its top at 452 m water depth. The regular cone shape of this mud 

volcano is symmetrical with respect to its slopes. In the centre of the volcano is a small flat-topped, 

dome-like feature (about 350 m in diameter) with steep slopes. The Pipoca mud volcano is 

morphologically similar to Anastasya, it presents a sub-rounded cone shaped feature with a maximum 

diameter of 2100 m, a relief of 97 m and the summit occurs at 536 m water depth. On the southwestern 

slope of this mud volcano can be identified several lobes formed by successive mud flows. The Tarsis 

mud volcano, NW of Pipoca, occurs at 762 m water depth and is a low-relief mound surrounded by a 

ring-shaped moat. Its diameter at the seabed is 900 m and its height is 60 m (Somoza et al. 2003). 

 

3.2.1.3. Meknès  

The Meknès Mud Volcano has a high backscatter central pear shaped crater at a water depth of 

about 650 m and the base is at 710 m. The MV discovered during the TTR 14 cruise in 2004, is located 

on the SWIM 1 fault (see Figure 3.1). It is 60 m high and its width is about 1000 m (see Table 3.1; 

Kenyon et al. 2006; Mhammedi et al. 2008, 2010). According with Mhammedi et al. 2010 the main 

minerals of the MV are carbonates, calcite, dolomite and aragonite. (Kenyon et al. 2006). The crater of 

the Meknès MV is formed by a large number of empty shells of the gastropod Neptunea and green mud 

breccia with scattered clasts (Oliver et al. 2011). 

 



 

34 

 

3.2.1.4. Student  

The student mud volcano was discovery during the TTR 10 cruise in 2000 (Kenyon et al. 2001; 

see Figure 3.2). It is 200 m high and it has a very sharp morphology, with a diameter of about 1700 m 

at its base and 200 m at the top, at a water depth at the top of about 955 m (see Table 3.1). This mud 

volcano is delimited by a well-defined moat, particularly on the westernmost flank, where there are 

small features that are probably carbonate mounds (Akhmetzhanov et al. 2008).  

 

3.2.1.5. Ginsburg  

The Ginsburg Mud Volcano discovered in TTR 09 cruise in 1999 (Kenyon et al. 2000; Kenyon 

et al. 2010; see Figure 3.2 - B), is located in the Western Moroccan Field in the Eastern domain of the 

Olistostrome and is probably one of the largest mud volcanoes in this area (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b; 

Stadnitskaia et al. 2008). This conical shaped MV is over 250 m high, with a diameter of about 3800 m 

at the base and 400 m at the top, (see Table 3.1; Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b; Akhmetzhanov et al. 

2008), at a water depth of about 911 m. 

 

3.2.1.6. Yuma 

The Yuma Mud Volcano (see Figure 3.2) discovered during the TTR 09 in 1999 (Kenyon et al. 

2000) is constituted by a large, approximately 4000 m in diameter, gently domed summit upon which a 

smaller dome is located. It is a conical shaped mud volcano with approximately 250 m high, about 4500 

m wide at the base and 2000 m at the top (Akhmetzhanov et al. 2008). This mud volcano is located in 

the southeastern part of the Gulf of Cadiz, with a bathymetric relief of more than 200 m (Gardner, 2001; 

Murton and Biggs, 2003; Ovsyannikov et al. 2003) at a water depth of about 964 m (see Table 3.1). 

  

3.2.1.7. Aveiro  

The Aveiro Mud Volcano (see Figure 3.2) discovered during the TTR 12 cruise in 2002, is 1500 

m wide and about 80 m high (Kenyon et al. 2003; Ivanov et al. 2010), at a water depth of 1065 m (see 

Table 3.1). Sediment samples were collected and subdivided into three intervals during the TTR 12: the 

upper interval, the middle interval and the lower interval. The upper one, 0 to 4 cm presents brown marl 

with foraminifera. The middle interval, 4 to 91 cm is light gray homogeneous, bioturbated marl with 

foraminifera. The mud breccia is present in the lower interval, up to 0.5 – 1 cm diameter with a clayey 

matrix and a large number of sedimentary rock fragments (Kenyon et al. 2003).  

 



 

35 

 

3.2.1.8. Jesus Baraza 

The Jesus Baraza Mud Volcano (see Figure 3.2) discovered during the TTR 10 cruise in 2010 

(Kenyon et al. 2001) is an asymmetrical hill with an ellipsoidal top (Kenyon, 2003), located on the 

SWIM 2 fault in the Western Moroccan Field (WMF) at a water depth of about 1091 m. The asymmetry 

of the crater area results from the presence of another crater developing about 300 m to the south 

(Kenyon, 2003). The Eastern domain is characterized by mud volcanism and mud diapirism, which are 

structurally controlled (inverse structures within a chaotic body - GCAW) and likely triggered by the 

tectonic forces related to the convergence of the African and the Eurasian plates (Stadnitskaia et al. 

2008). The MV is about 150 m high, the crater is 1600 m long and about 600 m wide (see Table 3.1; 

Kenyon, 2003).  

 

3.2.1.9. Shouen 

Shouen MV is a conical shaped mud volcano located approximately 16 km to the WNW of the 

Yuma MV and about 11 Km to the north of Darwin MV (see Figure 3.2 - B), with water depths at the 

top of 1180 m and high backscatter. It was discovered during the TTR 16 cruise in 2006, and it is 

approximately 150 m high, with a diameter of about 1100 m at its base and 700 m at the top (see Table 

3.1). This crater shows scattered crusts, clasts, small dead colonies of scleractinean coral and numerous 

life traces. During the TTR 16 cruise was observed a few soft corals and pandalidae shrimps, and were 

collected samples that contained some worms (Siboglinidae and other polychaetes), cnidarians 

(Hydrozoa and Scyphozoa) and one bivalve. The Shouen MV has a similar morphology to Darwin MV 

and is also a site of active seepage (Akhmetzhanov et al. 2008).  

 

3.2.1.10. Darwin 

The Darwin Mud Volcano (see Figure 3.2) discovered during the TTR 16 in 2006 

(Akhmetzhanov et al. 2008), is situated on the Moroccan continental margin, at a water depth of 1105 

m. The MV is cone shaped and approximately 50 m in height. In the centre of the crater a patch of 

seafloor approximately 80 m in diameter is covered with a carbonate crust pavement that is broken up 

by a network of fissures. The individual carbonate slabs are up to 10 m in diameter and are often tilted 

creating local escarpments of up to 0.5 m high (see Table 3.1; Vanneste et al. 2012). 

Darwin MV differs from the others in the Carbonate Province area because its crater is 

completely covered by large carbonate slabs and crusts. The fissures among the slabs and depressions 

with scattered crust are filled with abundant shell hash of Bathymodiolus and Neptunea contraria (Génio 

et al. 2008; Blazewicz-Paszkowycz et al. 2011a) and occasionally small clumps of living Bathymodiolus 

mauritanicus (Von Cosel, 2002; Blazewicz-Paszkowycz et al. 2011a; Oliver et al. 2011; Rodrigues et 

al. 2011). Soft corals and other epifauna are occasionally present on the rocks and sediment surface 

(Genio et al. 2008). Discrete AOM hotspots have been observed at the rim of the crater, suggesting a 

relocation of seep activity (Vanreusel et al. 2009).

3.2.2. Other Features  

In this work besides the mud volcanoes, other morphologic features of tectonic origin were also 

studied (e.g.: the Vernadsky Ridge, the Pen Duick Escarpment, the Formosa Ridge). In addition to these, 

whitin and in the vicinity of the MOW channels, abundant macrofauna was observed and also sampled. 

These features include the Iberico mud mound, the Cadiz Channel and the Channel west of Gibraltar. 

 

3.2.2.1. Channel West of Gibraltar Strait 

A large erosive channel is located west of the Camarinal Sill along the Gibraltar Strait exit. This 

channel may be divided into two main zones in agreement with Hernández-Molina et al. 2012: The eastern 

zone (Figure 3.8) is approximately 3000 to 4000 m wide and has a relatively linear WSW trend until 

reaching basement highs. The western zone (see Figure 3.8) of the channel is about 6000 m wide and has 

a sinusoidal shape with a SW trend until 35.770º N and 6.717º W, where it changes its trend towards the 

NW and narrows to approximately 4000 m (Hernández-Molina et al. 2012; 2014). The channel changes to 

a small depression towards NW being delimited by a contourite terrace to the NE and an associated huge 

contourite levee to the SW. In the middle to distal part of the terrace there are other minor channels, 

erosional scour alignments, valleys and depositional features (Hernández-Molina et al. 2012). The MOW 

circulates along this channel being partially responsible for its morphological characteristics (see Figure 

2.1). 

 

3.2.2.2. Vernadsky Ridge 

The Vernadsky Ridge is a sea floor ridge located in the El Arraiche mud volcano field, sub-

parallel to the Renard ridge and has a steep fault escarpmentat their S flank (see Figure 34 and 37; Van 

Rensbergen et al. 2005b; Wehrmann et al. 2011). It is located in water depths of about 700 m and 

stretches to the shelf edge (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005b).  

The total amount of mounds and cold-water coral patches on this northern edge of the Vernadsky 

Ridge can be estimated at 130. The central part of the Vernadsky Ridge consists also of a topographic 

height, providing substrate for the settlement of benthic organisms. At the edges, mound like structures 

are recognized, which can be interpreted as small NW-SE orientated mound patches. They have a similar 

acoustic signature on seismic and sidescan sonar imagery as the mound-like structures at the northern 

edge of the Vernadsky Ridge (Foubert et al. 2008).  



 

37 

 

 

 

3.2.2.3. Pen Duick Escarpment Area 

The Pen Duick Escarpment located within the El Arraiche mud volcano field, represents the 

southeastern branch of the Renard Ridge (Kenyon et al. 2003; Van Rooij et al. 2011; Wehrmann et al. 

2011; Mol et al. 2012) and it is separated from Gemini MV, by 1000 m wide moat feature (see Figure 

3.4; Wehrmann et al. 2011). It represents a NE-SW oriented fault-bounded (normal fault) cliff of 6 km 

length and 80 to 125 m height (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005a; Van Rooij et al. 2011; Wehrmann et al. 

2011) at a water depth of 525 m (Kenyon et al. 2003). Some studies using seismic profiles provide 

evidence for gas accumulation and features related to hydrocarbon (gas) seepage, across the Pen Duick 

Escarpment (Wehrmann et al. 2011).  

On top of the Pen Duick Escarpment 15 cold-water coral mounds were recognized. These 

mounds are conical to elongated features with an average elevation of 15 m above the surrounding 

seabed (e.g.: mound C; Cunha personal communication). The mounds are distributed in a water depth 

of 500 – 600 m and reach up to 60 m in height and about 500 m in diameter at the mound base. The 

corals and the macrofauna located in the mounds are under the influence of the North Atlantic Central 

Water, with a bottom current speed of 10 cm s-1 at 1 m off the seafloor (Mol et al. 2012) and with 

Figure 3.8 – Swath bathymetry at the exit of the Gibraltar Strait (modified from Hernández-Molina et al., 

2014). Red Lines – Delimit Northern and Southern parts of the Channel.

seabottom water temperatures ranging from 10.7 up to 11.8 °C and a salinity range of 35.55 – 35.65 

(Van Rooij et al. 2011; Wehrmann et al. 2011).   

 

3.2.2.4. Iberico 

The Iberico (see Figure 3.2) is an 870 m deep and 165 m tall cone-shaped mud mound. This 

feature is defined by an asymmetric profile with steep slopes of 22º-25º and 12º-15º at its southward and 

northward flank, respectively (Somoza et al. 2003; see Figure 3.2). 

 

3.2.2.5. Formosa Ridge 

The Formosa Ridge (see Figure 3.2) is a diapiric ridge formed by the ascending movement of 

salt/shale deposits of the olistostrome masses or deeper plastic units. The movement of these less dense 

units is likely triggered by the tectonic transpressional setting related to the convergence of the African 

and the Eurasian plates (Magalhães et al. 2012). 

 

3.2.2.6. Cadiz Channel 

The Cadiz Channel is the largest and most important contourite channel. It has a total length of 

110 km and an orientation that varies from SE-NW to NE-SW. This submarine channel is subject to 

high current speeds and erosional processes (Hernández-Molina et al. 2006; see Figure 3.2 and 3.9).

3.3. Deep Field  

3.3.1. Captain Arutyunov 

Captain Arutyunov is a cone-shaped Mud Volcano on a flat basin floor, discovered during the 

TTR 12 cruise in 2002 (Kenyon et al. 2003) at a water depth of 1324 m. This Mud Volcano is about 100 

m high, 2000 m in diameter and has a 300 m wide circular crater at the top (see Table 3.1; Kenyon et 

al. 2003). It is located on one of the major SWIM lineaments (SWIM 2; see Figure 3.2), where the 

thickness of the accretionary prism is greatest (Thiebot and Gutscher, 2006). The Captain Arutynov is 

one of the most active mud volcanos in the Gulf of Cadiz (Niemann et al. 2006; Sommer et al. 2009), 

is categorized as an example of extensive generation and transport of fluids, petroleum and hydrocarbon 

gases from deeply buried sediments (Nuzzo et al. 2009) and is the place where an unusual member of 

the Callianassidae has been found (Dworschak and Cunha, 2007). The most conspicuous animals were 

cidarid echinoids clustered at the centre of the crater. Several samples taken at the top showed that the 

central area is rich in gas hydrates and is densely covered by aggregations of Siboglinum accompanied 

by buried thyasiridae bivalves and patches of abundant polychaetes and tanaidaceans (Dworschak and 

Cunha, 2007).

3.3.2. Sagres 

Sagres Mud Volcano is the shallowest mud volcano discovered on the Portuguese margin (see 

Figure 3.2) during the TTR 17 cruise in 2008, at a water depth of 1554 m. It presents an asymmetric 

structure with a steep flank on the SE and its crater, at a 1630 m water depth, coincides with an area of 

high backscattering. The MV is about 110 m high and 2700 m wide at its base (see Table 3.1), and 

based on the seismic profile it appears to have been controlled by faulting (Ivanov et al. 2010).   

 

3.3.3. Carlos Ribeiro 

The Carlos Ribeiro Mud Volcano discovered during the TTR 10 cruise in 2000 (Kenyon et al. 

2001), is located on the deep Portuguese margin on the lower slope of the accretionary wedge at less 

than 10 km of the SWIM 2 fault, at 2173 m below sea level (Vanneste et al. 2011, 2013; see Figure 

3.2). The MV is circular with a flat-top summit, extending approximately to 80 m in height and 1500 m 

in diameter (see Table 3.1; Pinheiro et al. 2003; Vanneste et al. 2011, 2013). The focus of activity (the 

eye) of the Mud Volcano lies slightly to the north of its centre, and is surrounded by a series of concentric 

ridges which build up the MV (Vanneste et al. 2011, 2013).  

Gas hydrates recovered from the sediment and methane concentrations measured on the Carlos 

Ribeiro mud volcano are some of the highest from the Gulf of Cadiz (Hilário and Cunha, 2008). In spite 

of this, the methane emissions, into the overlying water column, are relatively low (0 – 806 mmol m?2 

yr?1), which has been attributed to low fluid flow velocities (0.4 – 4 cm yr?1) coupled with efficient 

microbial methanotrophy (Vanneste et al. 2013) and as result of the retention of methane in the form of 

hydrates. Fluid flow activity focused at the eye of the MV, gradually decreases towards its periphery 

and shows only modest fluid expulsion activity, when compared to other MVs (Vanneste et al. 2011, 

2013). In the Carlos Ribeiro Mud Volcano the macrofauna is diverse on the flanks, and by contrast, the 

top (2200 m) is almost devoid of macrofauna with the exception of scattered ophiuroids and Bobmarleya 

gadensis, which inhabit small depressions of the seafloor (Hilário and Cunha, 2008). 

 

3.3.4. Bonjardim 

The Bonjardim Mud Volcano is located on the deep Portuguese margin (see Figure 3.2; 

Pinheiro et al. 2003), on SWIM 1 lineament in a water depth of about 3060 m (Pinheiro et al. 2003; Van 

Rensbergen et al. 2005b). This Mud Volcano was discovered during the TTR 10 cruise in 2000 (see 

Table 3.1; Kenyon et al. 2001; Pinheiro et al. 2003) and has approximately 2000 m in diameter and 150 

m in high (Akhmetzhanov et al. 2008) with a sea floor depression at the rim of the cone (Pinheiro et al. 

2003). The crater rim is well developed, enclosing the 800 m wide, very high backscatter crater domain. 

On the southeastern end of the crater there is a small, elevated area about 150 m in diameter. The western 

flank of the Bonjardim mud volcano is cut by a NE-SW slope failure, over 1000 m long that appears to 

be related to a particularly large mud flow (Akhmetzhanov et al. 2008). The characteristic feature of the 

mud breccias from the Bonjardim MV is the presence of very thin cover of pelagic sediments which 

indicates that the sampling sites were located on relatively recent mud flows (Stadnitskaia et al. 2006). 



 

41 

 

3.3.5. Semenovich  

The Semenovich Mud Volcano, located on the deep Portuguese margin (still in the accretionary 

wedge; see Figure 3.1) was discovered during the TTR 15 cruise in 2005 at a water depth of 3200 m 

approximately (Akhmetzhanov et al. 2007; Table 3.1). It is one of the deepest mud volcanoes found in 

the Deep Portuguese Mud Volcano field together with Porto, Bonjardim, Olenin and Carlos Ribeiro. 

This MV is 70 m high, has two craters with high backscatter and sharp rims, and well defined mudflows 

that are more developed to the northwest (Akhmetzhanov et al. 2008). 

 

3.3.6. Porto 

The Porto Mud Volcano is located at the deep Portuguese margin (see Figure 3.1; Blazewicz-

Paszkowycz et al. 2011a), on SWIM 1 lineament, at the rim of the accretionary prism, in a water depth 

of about 3900 m (see Table 3.1; IFM-Geomar, 2006; Cunha et al. 2013). It was discovered during the 

TTR 15 cruise in 2005 (Akhmetzhanov et al. 2007) and has been until now, the deepest mud volcano 

known so far from the Gulf of Cadiz (IFM-Geomar, 2006). The top of the Porto mud volcano is covered 

by a continuous field of clumps of 20 to 50 individuals of Spirobrachia tripeira and an undetermined 

number of adult and juvenile specimens of Polybrachia sp. These clumps are accompanied mainly by 

the frenulate Lamellisabella denticulata, stalked hexactinellid sponges and crinoids (Hilário and Cunha, 

2008).

Chapter 4 

Data and Methods 

The data used in this work was compiled from the most relevant bibliography on the fauna 

observed in the Gulf of Cadiz mud volcanoes, including several recently published articles (Dworschak 

and Cunha 2007; Génio et al. 2008, 2013; Hilário and Cunha 2008; Rodrigues et al. 2008; Bla?ewicz-

Paszkowycz et al. 2011a, 2011b; Oliver et al. 2011; Rodrigues et al. 2011, 2013), which are presented 

in the main matrix of Appendix I – Table 1. The samples were obtained using different gears (e.g.: 

Gravity Corer - GC, FLUFO Lander - FLUFO, USNEL Box Corer - USNEL, Multi Corer - MUC, 

Geology Dredge - GD, Kasten Corer - KC, BIGO Lander - BIGO, TV-Grab - Gr, Suction Sampler ROV 

- SUS, Push Corer ROV - PUC, NIOZ Box Corer – NIOZ; examples shown in Figure 4.1), depending 

namely on the specific objectives of each campaign, on the geological nature of the sampled seafloor, 

and on the ship equipment availability. 

 Using the ArcMap, the main component of the ArcGis (Geographic Information System) 

software, a comprehensive geodatabase was created using ArcCatalog to store all the spatial and tabular 

data (e.g.: biological data, geographic coordinates, depths, cruises, stations, gear, structures and SWIM 

bathymetry). The data was organized in layers: Feature Classes and Raster Dataset, which allowed to 

create the final maps.  All maps produced were projected using UTM Zone 29N coordinated system and 

World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) Datum. 

 

4.1. Spatial analysis with ArcGIS  

ArcGis is a geographic information system software with the ArcMap as the main component. 

The ArcMap is used primarily to view, edit, create, and analyse geospatial data. In this project, the 

ArcMap is used as a geospatial data tool in order to find spatial relationships between geological and 

biological data (as specified above), namely concerning the SWIM faults, the mud volcanoes and the 

bathymetry versus the macrofauna found in the study area, the Gulf of the Cadiz.

4.1.1. Workflow of the ArcMap 

4.1.1.1. Geodatabase 

A personal geodatabase, named BioData, is created using ArcCatalog to store all the spatial and 

tabular data (e.g.: biological data, geographic coordinates, depths, cruises, stations, gear, structures, 

SWIM bathymetry; Figure 4.2). The integration of all data in this format, allows tables correlations and 

several spatial analyses in a very simple and efficient way. 

 

 

 

4.1.1.2. Feature Classes and Raster Dataset  

The Feature Classes (a collection of geographic features with the same geometry type (such as 

point, line, or polygon), attributes, and spatial reference, see ESRI website: http://www.esri.com/) can 

be created through four primary ways, using ArcCatalog or the Catalog window, using the Create 

Feature Class geoprocessing tool (the method used in this project), saving the contents of a map layer 

in ArcMap and converting an external data source into a geodatabase feature class. When creating a 

Figure 4.2 – The main operation performed in ArcMap.

feature class, it is possible to choose whether to create one that stores polygons, lines, points, annotation, 

multipoint, multipatch or dimension features. All feature classes in a feature dataset must use the same 

spatial reference, which is defined when the feature dataset is created. The Raster Dataset represents 

geographic features by dividing the geographical space into discrete square or rectangular cells laid out 

in a grid (e.g.: the SWIM bathymetry used to delimiter the SWIM lineaments). Each cell has a value 

that is used to represent some characteristic of that location (ESRI website: http://www.esri.com/). 

 

4.1.1.3. Join Data and Final Maps  

When the feature classes are defined, it is necessary to compile the data in the same table to 

create the maps.  “Join Data” is a very important step to join all data in the same table (e.g.: heterotrophic 

and chemotrophic species, gears, and stations in the Biology feature class). This allows the selection and 

display of the necessary attributes in the different maps. After the necessary attributes are selected, the 

software superimposes the different layers (Feature Classes and Raster Dataset) and creates the final 

maps (e.g.: Figure 3.1 and 3.2).

Results 

The biological samples studied in this work were taken from 22 mud volcanoes, six from the El 

Arraiche Mud Volcano field, ten from the Carbonate Province and six from the Deep Field, and another 

six features (not mud volcanoes) in the Carbonate Province (see Chapter 3). The features with a high 

level of sampling effort (Table 5.1) are Captain Arutyunov MV (19 stations), Mercator MV (12 stations) 

and Pen Duick Escarpment (ten stations). The type of gear more frequently used to collect the biological 

samples were the TV-Grab (Gr) in thirty stations and the USNEL Box Corer (UB) in sixteen stations 

(see Table 5.1). 

In total 122 species were analysed from 105 stations (Annex I - Table 1), 18 belong to the 

Family Siboglinidae (Phylum Annelida, Class Polychaeta), 14 to the Class Bivalvia (Phylum Mollusca), 

56 to the Class Gastropoda (Phylum Mollusca), 17 to the Order Tanaidacea (Phylum Arthropoda, Sub-

Phylum Crustacea, Class Malacostraca), one to the Order Decapoda (Phylum Arthropoda, Sub-Phylum 

Crustacea, Class Malacostraca) and 16 to the Class Ophiuroidea (Phylum Echinodermata; Table 5.2). 

The Order Decapoda was not analysed like the other taxa since the available published data reports one 

family only (Callianassidae, Genus Vulcanocalliax, Species V. arutyunovi; Annex II – Figure 1) found 

in Captain Arutyunov MV at depths between 1327 and 1339 m. 

The interpretation of the number of species per feature distribution shows that the number of 

chemotrophic species increases with the depth increment (Figure 5.1 - A). Two exceptions can be 

observed, in the El Arraiche Field and in the “Other Features” from the Carbonate Province. Although 

the Mercator MV is located at only 351 m depth, a high number of chemotrophic species (eight species) 

was observed, when compared with other features from the El Arraiche Field, located at the same depth. 

In the “Other Features” no chemotrophic species are observed, with the exception of the Pen Duick 

Escarpment (between 445 and 1275 m), where two thiotrophic species were found. The mud volcanoes 

(red rectangles in the Figure 5.1) that show a higher number of chemotrophic species are located at less 

than 10 km relatively to the SWIM faults, with the exception of the Jesus Baraza MV where only one 

specie was found. The predominant metabolic strategy in all analysed areas (“Other Features”, El 

Arraiche Field, Carbonate Province and Deep Field) is the thiotrophic nutrition. On the other hand, the 

less utilized metabolic strategy is the Dual Symbiosis, only observed in species localized in Darwin MV. 

The distribution of the heterotrophic species (Figure 5.1 - B) shows that the number of taxa 

tends to decrease with depth (76 species in the El Arraiche Field, 60 species in the Carbonate Province, 

36 species in the “Other Features” and 47 species in the Deep Field). Thus, a higher number of these 

species is observed in the El Arraiche Field than in the Deep Field. In both cases the majority of species 

belong to the Class Gastropoda. In the “Other Features” the number of species is lower than expected 

for these depths and also lower than in the Deep Field. In three of the six MV situated at less than 10 

km of the SWIM faults, a high number of heterotrophic organisms can be observed (Meknès, Captain 

Arutyunov and Porto MV).

5.1. Chemotrophic Organisms 

5.1.1. Class Polychaeta 

The Class Polychaeta is represented by 18 species (one family, five genera; see Table 5.2); ten 

of these species occurred in this study only once (singletons), Bobmarleya gadensis (Annex II – Figure 

2, Lamellisabella denticulata, Spirobrachia tripeira (Annex II – Figure 2), Polybrachia sp.2, 

Polybrachia sp.3, Polybrachia Vb, Polybrachia Vc, Siboglinum Ie, Siboglinum sp.1 and Siboglinum 

sp.2. 

Figures 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 show the distribution of the Class Polychaeta in the study area. In 

Figures 5.2 and 5.3 are mapped the distribution of the two genera that are represented by several species: 

- Polybrachia (six species) and Siboglinum (nine species). Figure 5.4 shows the distribution of the 

remaining species of this taxon: Bobmarleya gadensis, Lamellisabella denticulata and Spirobrachia 

tripeira. The majority of species belonging to the genus Polybrachia are located in mud volcanoes from 

the Deep Field (Carlos Ribeiro, Captain Arutyun, Sagres, Bonjardim, Porto and Semenovich). The only 

specie of the Genus Polybrachia found outside the Deep Field is Polybrachia sp.1 (see Figure 5.2) that 

occurs in the Mercator MV. The species belonging to the Genus Siboglinum widespread throughout the 

study area (see Figure 5.3). Finally, the species Bobmarleya gadensis, Lamellisabella denticulata and 

Spirobrachia tripeira are observed only in the Deep Field, being restricted to the Carlos MV 

(Bobmarleya gadensis) and Porto MV (Lamellisabella denticulata and Spirobrachia tripeira), at less 

than 10 km to the SWIM faults (see Figure 5.4).

5.1.2. Class Bivalvia 

The Class Bivalvia is represented by 14 species (ten genera in five families: Mytilidae, 

Solemyidae, Thyasiridae and Vesicomyidae; see Table 5.2; examples shown in Annex II - Figure 3 to 

8), three of these are heterotrophic (Figure 5.13, subchapter 5.2) and 11 chemotrophic (Figure 5.5, 5.6 

and 5.7). Five of these species are singletons, Isorropodon sp. indeterminate, Spinaxinus cf. sentosus, 

Lucinoma asapheus, Mendicula ferruginosa and Thyasira tortuosa. Figures 5.5 and 5.6 show the 

distribution of the two families with more species (Solemyidae and Thyasiridae) and Figure 5.7 shows 

the distribution of the remaining species. The species Acharax gadirae (Annex II – Figure 4) occurs in 

a wide range of depths, 556 to 3860 m, contrasting with the species Solemya (Petrasma) elarraichensis 

(Annex II – Figure 4) that is restricted to lower depths, 358 to 1030 m, in the El Arriche Field, and 

Carbonate Province (see Figure 5.5). The species Spinaxinus cf. sentosus (blue dot; Annex II – Figure 

5) and Thyasira tortuosa (pink dot) only appear once and are both located in the Deep Field. Thyasira 

(Parathyasira) granulosa (green dots) appears in three different features, Shouen MV, Meknès MV 

(Carbonate Province) and Mercator MV (El Arraiche Field) at depths between 350 and 1177 m. The 

specie Thyasira vulcolutre (red dots; Annex II – Figure 3) is located in the Depp Field (Carlos Ribeiro 

MV and Captain Arutyunov) at depths between 1221 and 2200 m. The last specie, Axinulus croulinensis 

was found only in the Mercator Mud Volcano in El Arraiche Field (see Figure 5.6). Finally, the species 

“Bathymodiolus” mauritanicus, Isorropodon megadesmus (Annex II – Figure 6), Isorropodon sp. 

indeterminate (Annex II – Figure 7) and Lucinoma asapheus (Annex II – Figure 5) are present in all 

areas at depths between 358 to 1323 m (see Figure 5.7).

5.2. Heterotrophic Organisms 

5.2.1. Order Tanaidacea 

The Order Tanaidacea is represented by 17 species (13 genera in eight families; see Table 5.2; 

examples shown in Annex II – Figure 9 to 16); four of them are singletons: Pseudosphyrapus, 

Pseudosphyrapus sp. A (Annex II – Figure 16), Sphyrapus meknes (Annex II – Figure 16) and 

Torquella ibérica (Annex II – Figure 11). Figure 5.8 shows the distribution of two Suborders, 

Apseudomorpha and Tanaidomorpha. The Suborder Apseudomorpha (green dots) occurs in a wide 

range of depths, 355 to 3061 m and it is present in all regions of the study area. On the other hand, the 

Suborder Tanaidomorpha (dark blue dots) only occurs in a lower range of depths, 355 to 1345 m, except 

for one specie, Pseudotanais (Pseudotanais) tympanobaculum (Annex II – Figure 13) belonging to the 

family Pseudotanaidae that also occurs deeper (3061 m).

5.2.2. Class Ophiuroidea 

The Class Ophiuroidea is represented by 16 species (ten genera in seven families; see Table 

5.2; examples shown in Annex II – Figure 17 to 21); five of them are singletones, Ophiacantha aristata 

(Annex II – Figure 17), Ophiopristis gadensis (Annex II – Figure 18), Ophiactis abyssicola (Annex 

II – Figure 19), Ophiomusium lymani, and Ophiura (Dictenophiura) carnea. Figure 5.9 shows the 

distribution of the six families, Amphilepididae, Amphiuridae, Ophiacanthidae, Ophiactidae, 

Ophiolepididae and Ophiuridae. These families are located at depths between 230 and 1390 m. The 

family Amphiuridae (blue dots) has a broader distribution, when compared with the other families and 

is present in 15 features (11 mud volcanoes).

5.2.3. Class Gastropoda 

The Class Gastropoda is represented by 56 species (49 genera in 31 families; see Table 5.2; 

examples shown in Annex II - Figure 22); 28 of them are singletons, Alvania electa, Akritogyra sp. A, 

Benthomangelia macra, Cirsonella aff. romettensis, Cerithiopsidae sp. A, cf. Odostomia sp., cf. 

Sahlingia sp. A, Claviscala sp. A, Conoidea sp. A, Drilliola loprestiana, Danilia tinei, Emarginula

Vetigastropoda, that are represented by several species and Figure 5.12 shows the distribution of the 

remaining subclasses: Heterobrachia, Neomphalina and Patellogastropoda. The subclass 

Caenogastropoda (Figure 5.10) has a heterogeneous distribution, it is present in all regions (El Arraiche 

Field, Carbonate Province and Deep Field) and occurs in a wide range of depths, 350 to 3902 m. 

Although the subclass Vetigastropoda (Figure 5.11) is also present in all regions, it is mostly restricted 

to lower depths, 227 to 1390 m, occurring punctually also in Porto MV (3887 to 3902 m). The final map 

shows three subclasses in a lower range of depths, 379 to 1321 m. The subclass Heterobrachia (purple 

dots) has a wider distribution when compared with the other two subclasses, Neomphalina and 

Patellogastropoda.

5.2.4. Class Bivalvia 

The three heterotrophic species belonging to the Class Bivalvia have different distributions (Figure 

5.13). The specie Leptaxinus minutus (green dots) is reported from three mud volcanoes, two in the Cabonate 

Province (Darwin and Yuma) and one in the El Arraiche Field (Mercator), while the specie Mendicula 

ferruginosa (dark blue dot) only appears in one mud volcano (Mercator). The specie Thyasira obsoleta (red 

dots) is reported, mostly from sites located at less than 10 km to the SWIM faults in the Deep Field. The 

exception is the occurrence of Thyasira obsoleta in the Mercator MV. This is the specie with the widest range 

of depths, 353 to 3860 m.

Discussion 

6.1. Strengths and Limitations of the data 

 The biological samples studied in this work were collected during several campaigns in the 

Gulf of Cadiz. The areas were sampled in accordance with the scientific objectives of these campaigns 

and ship operation capabilities, and therefore some features have a higher level of sampling effort 

(Captain Arutyunov MV - 19 stations, Mercator MV - 12 stations and Pen Duick Escarpment - ten 

stations) and others are represented by just one station (e.g.: Lazarillo de Tornes, Vernadsky Ridge, 

Iberico, Student; Table 5.1). The Captain Arutyunov MV has a high level of sampling effort, since it is 

one of the most active mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz (Niemann et al. 2006; Dworschak and Cunha, 

2007; Sommer et al. 2009; Cunha et al., 2013). On the other hand, the Pen Duick Escarpment area was 

extensively sampled during the study of corals in the framework of Microsystems and Moundforce 

projects led by Belgian and Dutch teams (e.g.: Foubert et al. 2008; Van Rooij et al. 2011; Wehrmann et 

al. 2011). The Mercator MV is one of the largest mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz, located at shallow 

depths, which facilitates accessibility and time spent to collect samples. The marked differences between 

the sampling (1 to 19 stations) makes it difficult to proper compare the different sites. The number of 

species increases with the number of stations (see Figure 5.1 and Table 5.1). Only in the ideal situation 

corresponding to a much similar sampling between the different sites, and to a similar identified number 

of specimens of all species, would it be possible to do a thorough detailed analysis of the species 

distribution. 

In the collection of biological samples different gears were used (Chapter 4), which allows 

collecting diversified information, since the different equipment will harvest different types of 

organisms. Again, only in a situation in which the same type of equipment was to be used across the 

whole Gulf of Cadiz, would it be possible and easier to statistically analyse the distribution of species 

collected, and to do a more accurate study. However, on the other hand, this would probably signify a 

considerable lost of information regarding the detected marked diversity of species. 

The species analysed in this work (122 species) are represented by chemotrophic organisms, 18 

belong to the Class Polychaeta (see Figure 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4) and 11 to the Class Bivalvia (see Figure 

5.5, 5.6 and 5.7), and heterotrophic organisms, 17 species belong to the Order Tanaidacea (see Figure 

5.8), 16 to the Class Ophiuroidea (see Figure 5.9), 56 to the Class Gastropoda (see Figure 5.10, 5.11 

and 5.12) and three to the Class Bivalvia (Figure 5.13). Despite the high level of sampling effort and 

the still in progress analysis of all collected organisms in campaigns, the discovery of 52 singletons 

species (43% of the total studied species, mostly in the Class Gastropoda) indicates the necessity of a 

higher level of sampling effort in the future. 

 

6.2. Spatial and Bathymetric Distribution  

The mud volcanoes described in this work were organized in three main areas (see Figure 3.1): 

the El Arraiche Mud Volcano Field (200 - 600 m), the Carbonate Province (600 - 1200 m) and Deep 



 

62 

 

Mud Volcano Field (1200 - 4000 m). Within the Carbonate Province several morphological features, 

here designated by “Other Features” and that are not mud volcanoes, were analysed. 

The El Arraiche Field encompasses a high number of heterotrophic species and a lower number 

of chemotrophic species when compared with the other studied areas in the Gulf of Cadiz (see Figure 

5.1). On the other hand, the Deep Field has a lower number of heterotrophic species and a high number 

of chemotrophic species that rely on the more active fluid emission in this region. It has been found that 

the number of the chemotrophic species increases with depth and the number of the heterotrophic species 

decreases with depth. The exception is the Mercator MV located in the El Arraiche Field, since it has a 

high number of both heterotrophic and chemotrophic organisms. This can express some degree of bias 

due to the high level of sampling effort in this mud volcano as mentioned above. In fact, the level of 

sampling effort was very important for the assessment of biodiversity: the features that were well 

sampled also show a good representation of heterotrophic species but this are not well represented in 

features that were insufficiently sampled. 

Observing the “Other Features” species distribution (see Figure 5.1) the chemotrophic species 

were only found in the Pen Duick Escarpment. In this case however, this is not due to different sampling 

efforts. As a matter of fact the Pen Duic Escarpment is a tectonic feature accommodating fluid and gas 

escape and accumulation in sediments (see decription in subchapter. 3.2.2.3), whereas the remaining 

“Other features” correspond to sedimentary and erosive features, or diapirs, where no methane migration 

and seepage is expected to occur.  

The Deep Field includes several of the most active mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz (Pinheiro 

et al. 2003; Rodrigues et al. 2011; Cunha et al. 2013) and several of them (Captain Arutyunov, Carlos 

Ribeiro, Bonjardim e Porto) are aligned along major crustal strike–slip faults (SWIM faults) associated 

with the African-Eurasian plate boundary (Duarte et al. 2011). As said before this is a place with a high 

number of chemotrophic species and this majority was found in Captain Arutyunov MV, Carlos Ribeiro 

MV, Bonjardim MV and Porto MV (see Figure 5.1). 

In general, the higher concentrations of species in the Gulf of Cadiz occurs at low depths, 200 

to 1200 m (see Figure 5.1, 6.1 and 6.2) and these are mostly located in the mud volcanoes (see Figure 

5.1). Comparing the deepest mud volcanoes: Porto (3900 m), Seemenovich (3200 m), Bonjardim (3060 

m) and Carlos Ribeiro (2173 m) with the shallowest mud volcanoes: Al Idrissi (197 m), Fiúza (393 m), 

Mercator (351 m) and Gemini (423 m), we see that the number of species found in the four deepest and 

four shallowest mud volcanoes is similarly low (except in Mercator MV), suggesting there is not a 

significant influence of the water depth on the number of species (see Figure 5.1). Nevertheless, this 

can also be due to the different sampling effort in the mud volcanoes, since some mud volcanoes have 

a higher sampling effort than others (1 to 12 stations; see Table 5.1). The highest number of 

heterotrophic and chemotrophic species was found in two mud volcanoes, Mercator and Captain 

Arutyunov. Again this can be due to the higher level of sampling effort in these mud volcanoes (12 and 

19 stations, respectively) relatively to the sampling of the remaining mud volcanoes. The highest number 

of chemotrophic species can be also due the location of the Mercator MV, on an anticline formed by the 

halokinesis of a salt diapir. According to Haffert et al. 2013, a direct relation between halokinesis and 

seepage of fluids and gases exists, which has also been frequently documented in other regions (e.g.: 

Gulf of Mexico). The rising diapir fractures the overburden, thereby creating preferential pathways for 

the fluid and gas to escape. The pathways reach very deep and lead along the flanks of the diaper, which 

allows fluids and gases to rise to the surface (Haffert et al. 2013). In turn, the highest number of 

chemotrophic species in the Captain Arutyunov MV can be due to the high concentration of methane 



 

63 

 

near de surface (Hensen et al. 2007), which in Gulf of Cadiz normally occurs between 30 and 80 cm (or 

more) below the seafloor (Niemann et al. 2006; Hensen et al. 2007).  

 

6.3. Metabolic Strategy  

The heterotrophic species were found in most of the studied features of the Gulf of Cadiz (except 

in Semenovich MV; see Figure 5.1), as expected since they occur globally. In this work, the 

heterotrophic species are represented mainly by the Class Gastropoda (see Figure 5.1), although the 

Polychaetes and the Crustaceans are in general the best represented taxonomic groups, in accordance to 

Cunha et al. 2013. The number of these species decreases with depth (see Figure 6.1) probably because 

the available food also becomes scarcer. In relation to the chemotrophic species, the dominant nutritional 

pathway is the thiotrophy (see Figure 5.1), with mixotrophy, methanotrophy emerging as secondary 

strategies (Rodrigues et al. 2013). The thiotrophic species are in symbiosis with thiotrophic bacteria 

whose metabolism depends on the oxidation of sulfide or sulfur with oxygen or nitrate (subchapter 

1.7). It occurs due to the high availability of sulfur in the form of sulfide or sulfur in the methane seepage 

areas of the Gulf of Cadiz. Therefore these species only occur in mud volcanoes (except Pen Duick 

Escarpment; see Figure 5.1). The methanotrophic species are only located in two mud volcanoes, 

Mercator (351 m) and Captain Arutyunov (1324 m), which indicates that the biogeochemical system in 

the Gulf of Cadiz is probably dominated by sulfur (see Figure 5.1).  

The Gulf of Cadiz has a higher number of chemotrophic species when compared with other seep 

locations in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Guinea  (e.g.: Warén and Bouchet, 2009; 

Oliver et al. 2008, 2011), which suggests the Gulf of Cadiz has a favourable nutritional condition for 

chemotrophic species. 

 

6.4. Proximity to the SWIM Faults 

The highest concentration of chemotrophic species occurs in mud volcanoes located on the 

SWIM 1 and SWIM 2 faults at water depths ? 1200 m (see Figure 5.1). This is suggestive of these faults 

acting as preferential fluid conduits, feeding those species. In general, the methane seeps are especially 

common and active at water depths of 500–1000 m, where temperature and pressure combine to 

destabilize gas hydrates (Hester and Brewer, 2009), but in the Gulf of Cadiz this depth may be greater 

due to the influence of the warmer Mediterranean Outflow Water (Niemann et al. 2006; Sommer et al. 

2009).

Conclusions 

The main conclusions of this work can be summarized as follows: 

1- In general, the higher concentrations of species in the Gulf of Cadiz occur at low depths, 

from 200 to 1200 m and are mostly located in the mud volcanoes; 

2- The heterotrophic species were found in most of the studied features of the Gulf of Cadiz, 

except in Semenovich MV, as expected, since they occur globally. The number of these 

species decreases with depth probably because the available food also becomes scarcer; 

3- The thiotrophy is the dominant nutritional pathway of the chemotrophic species. It occurs 

due to the high availability of sulfur in the form of sulfide or sulfur in the methane seepage 

areas of the Gulf of Cadiz. Therefore these species only occur in mud volcanoes, except in 

Pen Duick Escarpment;  

 

4- The methanotrophic species are only located in two mud volcanoes, Mercator (351 m) and 

Captain Arutyunov (1324 m), which indicates that the biogeochemical system in the Gulf 

of Cadiz is probably dominated by sulfur;  

 

5- The highest concentration of chemotrophic species occur in mud volcanoes located on the 

SWIM 1 and SWIM 2 faults at water depths ? 1200 m. Thus suggesting that these faults act 

as preferential fluid conduits, feeding those species. In general, the methane seeps are 

especially common and active at water depths of 500–1000 m, where temperature and 

pressure combine to destabilize gas hydrates (Hester and Brewer, 2009), but in the Gulf of 

Cadiz this depth may be greater due to the influence of the warmer Mediterranean Outflow 

Water (Niemann et al. 2006; Sommer et al. 2009); 

 

6- The main limitation of this work is the difference of sampling effort existing between 

features (one to 19 stations).  

 

7.1. Future Work 

- Complete the data with the same number of stations for all features; 

- Identify the number of specimens in the collected samples for a more detailed statistics analysis; 

- Acquire direct observation of the seafloor for the biologic communities on video; 

- Use the same gear and sampling technique in all features; 

- Collect gas samples at the stations studied in this work.
