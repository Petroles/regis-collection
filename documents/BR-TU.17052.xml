Abstract 

The fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) is distributed in the center and south of 

Europe and has a high genetic and morphological variability. In Portugal there are two subspe-

cies described, S. s. gallaica with a northern and central distribution and S. s crespoi with a 

more restricted distribution in the south. 

Defining the geographical boundaries between populations and subspecies is frequent-

ly difficult because there are often uncertainties on their distribution limits at putative or 

proven contact areas. One approach being increasingly used to detect cryptic geographic 

boundaries between populations is landscape genetics. This is an emerging field that inte-

grates population genetics, landscape ecology and spatial statistics and it aims to provide in-

formation about the interaction between landscape features and microevolutionary processes. 

      I attempted here to determine the geographic distribution and limits of the two aforemen-

tioned subspecies at their putative contact zone in southwest Portugal, using data from mi-

crosatellites and the mitochondrial gene cytochrome-b analysed with landscape genetics tools. 

This approach allowed evaluating if the two subspecies are currently in allopatry and the oc-

currence of gene flow between them. 

       Results show that the two subspecies are separated by a narrow barrier that contains the 

Sado River and imposes a very reduced gene flow, both contemporarily and historically, be-

tween them. Currently, the most important feature of this barrier seems to be the area of 

sandy soil south of the Sado that was part of the riverbed of an extended river in historical 

times. Although both populations show signs that they have been large for some time, S. s. 

crespoi seems to have undergone a population expansion around 18,000 years BP.

Resumo 

A Salamandra salamandra ou Salamandra-de-pintas-amarelas é um urodelo 

pertencente à família Salamandridae, com hábitos nocturnos, sedentários e totalmente 

terrestres, procurando meios aquáticos apenas para se reproduzir. A espécie apresenta uma 

distribuição restrita no território europeu, ocorrendo nas regiões do centro e sul da Europa e 

rareando a norte e leste. É uma espécie altamente variável, do ponto de vista genético, 

morfológico,  coloração e modo de reprodução. Estão descritas pelo menos 14 subespécies das 

quais 10 ocorrem na Península Ibérica ilustrando a importância desta região como refúgio 

durante os períodos glaciares. A Peninsula Ibérica actuou como um dos refúgios glaciares mais 

importantes da Europa. Várias evidências genéticas mostraram uma recente subdivisão deste 

em vários pequenos refúgios, uma vez que diferentes espécies apresentam forte subestrutura 

genética coincidindo com os diferentes refúgios da Peninsula Ibérica.  

Steinfartz et al. (2000) utilizou a região controlo do ADN mitocondrial para analisar a 

diferenciação genética entre populações europeias. Este estudo identificou três linhagens: a 

linhagem A, correspondendo às subespécies S. s. longirostris, S. s crespoi e S. s. morenica, que 

será mais basal e terá divergido há cerca de 2 a 4 milhões de anos das restantes linhagens. A 

linhagem B, com populações do norte de Espanha (S. s. bernardezi) e do sul de Itália (S. s. 

gigliolii) que sugerem que esta linhagem terá tido uma distribuição mais ampla no passado, e a 

linhagem C constituída por uma politomia não resolvida das restantes subespécies.  

Porteriormente García-París et al. (2003) utilizou o gene citocromo-b do ADN 

mitocondrial, para estudar as zonas de contacto entre subespécies na Península Ibérica com 

ênfase nas zonas de presença de populações ovovivíparas e vivíparas . Apesar de terem sido 

utilizadas poucas amostras das subespécies portuguesas, os resultados deste estudo 

corroboraram a existência de diferenciação entre as subespécies S. s. crespoi e S. s. gallaica.  

Em Portugal estão descritas duas subespécies,  S. s. gallaica Seone, 1884 e  S. s crespoi 

Malkamus, 1983. A primeira apresenta uma distribuição ampla por todo o norte e centro do 

país correspondendo à linhagem mais recente identificada em Steinfartz et al. (2000), 

enquanto S. s. crespoi tem distribuição consideravelmente mais restrita, sendo um endemismo 

do Sudoeste de Portugal e é representativa da linhagem mais ancestral.  

Os limites das áreas de distribuição das diferentes subespécies de S. salamandra são 

incertos salientando a necessidade de estudos detalhados a uma escala local para averiguar 

limites geográficos entre subespecies. Um estudo realizado para avaliar a distribuição de uma 

subespécie de Salamandra-de-pintas-amarelas no centro de Espanha  detectou eventos 



 
 

recentes de contacto secundário com outras subespécies. O delineamento de limites 

geográficos em populações e subespécies é frequentemente difícil não só devido  ao problema 

da definição dos limites das espécies mas também por não se conhecerem as fronteiras 

geográficas das mesmas. A detecção de limites genéticos em espécies com distribuição 

contínua e onde populações discretas não são fácilmente definidas pode contribuir para a 

compreensão dos processos que determinaram a sua actual distribuição , como por exemplo a 

existência  de barreiras ao fluxo genético. A genética da paisagem tem, recentemente, sido 

utilizada para a detecção de barreiras geográficas entre populações com distribuição continua.  

Esta disciplina é uma área de investigação emergente que integra fundamentos da genética 

populacional, ecologia da paisagem, e estatística espacial na avaliação do efeito das variáveis 

da paisagem e ambientais na diversidade genética e estrutura populacional. 

Foram utilizados três métodos baseados em inferência bayesiana, correntemente 

utilizados em genética da paisagem, para identificar o limite da distribuição geográfica das 

duas subespécies de salamandra na zona de contacto do Sudoeste de Portugal (S. s. gallaica e 

S. S. crespoi) através do uso de 10 microssatelites já descrito para a espécies.  Os resultados 

mostraram a separação das duas subespécies por uma barreira com cerca de 20km de 

extensão que integra o rio Sado e uma área envolvente predominantemente constituída por 

areias, arenitos e as argilas. Este resultado também foi corroborado  utilizando como marcador 

molecular um fragmento do gene mitocondrial citocromo-b. Porém, para este marcador foi 

utilizado um menor número de amostras, que foram consideradas representativas da 

amostragem total utilizada para os microssatelites, minimizando a redundância de se 

utilizarem  amostras de locais próximos. A rede de haplótipos mostrou dois grupos de 

haplótipos distintos para a subespécie S. s. gallaica na área amostrada  

Apesar de alguns problemas obtidos com os loci de microssatélites utilizados (alelos 

nulos, desvios ao equilibrio de Hardy-Weinberg), foi possivel avaliar a ocorrência de fluxo 

genético entre ambas as subespécies. Com base nos resultados dos dois marcadores e de 

vários programas que avaliam o fluxo genético e identificam indivíduos migrantes, foi possível 

verificar que actualmente o fluxo entre ambas as subespecies é muito baixo.O fluxo genético 

reduzido no passado (detectados 3 migrantes pela análise ADN mitocondrial), parece 

permanecer actualmente (detectados 8 migrantes pelos microssatelites), o que sugere a 

existência de uma barreira forte e persistente na passagem de migrantes entre as duas 

populações. 

Dentro de cada subespécie apenas foi detectada uma população. Com o auxilio dos 

dois tipos de marcadores moleculares foi possível averiguar que ambas as populações têm 



 
 

apresentado ao longo do tempo um elevado efectivo. Contudo, terá ocorrido uma expansão 

recente em S. s. crespoi iniciada à cerca de 18,000 anos atrás. Esta data é coincidente com o 

último máximo glacial sugerindo que após este período a população de S. s. crespoi terá 

expandido a partir de um refugio no sul. 

Os vários métodos utilizados para estimar o tempo de divergência das duas 

populações sugerem que a separação ocorreu no Pleistocénico. O método mais sofisticado, 

que considera qualquer sinal de fluxo genético durante a datação de uma  separação 

populacional, sugere uma estimativa mais recente de aproximadamente à 210,000 anos. 

Evidências sugerem este período como quente e húmido, em que terá ocorrido expansão de 

florestas de Quercus no sudoeste da Ibéria. Para além de na Europa ter ocorrido um  período 

semelhante por volta dos 120,000 de anos atrás, apenas no presente o clima nesta região  é 

tão favorável para a espécie. Um período quente e húmido poderá ter originado uma 

expansão da rede hidrgráfica do  Sado juntamente  e de habitat florestal, facilitado a 

ocorrência de um um maior fluxo genético, que não terá voltado a repetir-se desde então.  

Assim, com uma abordagem utilizada em genética da paisagem mostrou-se que no 

Sudoeste de Portugal as subespécies de Salamandra-de-pintas-amarelas estão separadas por 

uma barreira que integra o rio Sado e uma área envolvente predominantemente constituída 

por areias e arenitos. Para além disso, há evidências de um  fluxo genético histórico e actual 

muito reduzido, tendo ocorrido um último período de contacto àcerca de  210,000 anos. Os 

resultados também evidenciam  que a subespécie endémica do sudoeste de Portugal terá 

iniciado uma expansão àcerca de  18,000, após o último máximo glaciar.

Preliminary note 

This thesis is part of the FCT project “Effects of habitat fragmentation on the popula-

tion structure and connectivity of forest-dwelling species: a comparative landscape genetics 

approach” (FCT PTDC/BIA-BEC/101511/2008). It aims to identify corridors that connect the 

two Natura 2000 sites Cabrela and Costa Sudoeste with a comparative landscape genetics ap-

proach to four highly distinct species of forest-dwelling terrestrial animals. The study species 

are a carnivore (Martes foina), a rodent (Apodemus sylvaticus), an insect (Carabus lusitanicus) 

and an amphibian (Salamandra salamandra). Initially, the main purpose of this thesis was to 

carry out the part of the project on the Salamandra salamandra, but due to the nature of the 

obtained results the subject of the thesis had to be changed.

Introduction 

Salamandra salamandra 

The fire salamander, Salamandra salamandra (Linnaeus, 1758) is a urodele that be-

longs to the family Salamandridae, order Caudata. This species is mainly nocturnal, sedentary 

and completely terrestrial when adult, only search water bodies for reproduction. Live expec-

tancy can reach up to 25 years in the wild, and reproduction typically starts after the fourth 

year (Rebelo &amp;amp; Caetano 1995). Salamanders are active after September until the end of April, 

having an annual activity period of roughly seven months split in two periods: the autumn 

rains of October/November and the late winter/early spring rains of February/March (Rebelo 

&amp;amp; Leclair 2003). Concerning environmental conditions, the species is markedly dependent of 

high relative humidity, absence of wind, and nocturnal temperatures between 4ºC and 14 ºC 

(Rebelo 2008). Salamanders find these conditions in temperate deciduous forests, although 

they may occur in a large variety of habitat types. The species’ habitats range from subalpine 

meadows to Mediterranean scrubland, and even in areas of steppe when these occur close to 

water-courses with shrub cover. Salamanders are very effectively protected against predation 

since they produce a toxin in their parotid glands that repels predators, with the coloured por-

tions of the salamander’s skin being considered a warning signal to their toxicity (Rebelo 

2008). 

Salamandra salamandra is a species with a wide distribution and high morphological 

variability. Consequently, several different subspecies were described across different geo-

graphic regions. The species was historically considered to constitute a polytypic species as-

semblage with 16 subspecies, distributed over three continents, based on the distinctive mor-

phology (Eiselt 1958; Klewen 1991). However, Steinfartz et al. (2000) were able to show, using 

genetic markers, that it was possible to separate the genus Salamandra in six different species 

as supported by previous studies (Joger &amp;amp; Steinfartz 1994; Veith 1994), corresponding to S. 

salamandra, S. algira, S. infraimmaculata, S. corsica, and the previously considered S. atra and 

S. lanzai, each with their associated subspecies. Hence, the 16 subspecies previously consid-

ered within the S. salamandra complex are presently classified in 13 subspecies. The study by 

Steinfartz et al. (2000) suggests the presence of three main lineages within S. salamandra: (A) 

the most ancient, comprising the subspecies S. s longirostris, S. s. morenica and S. s. crespoi, 

that comes out as a reasonably well separated unit from the remaining lineages at about 2 to 4 

million years ago; (B) a second lineage, including populations from northern Spain (S. s. ber-

nardezi) and populations from southern Italy (S. s. gigliolii), inferred to represent the remnant 



3 
 

of a formerly widespread lineage that covered the whole of Central Europe in a previous inter-

glacial period, approximately 500 000 years ago; and (C) a more derived lineage, represented 

by the remaining S. salamandra subspecies as a non-resolved polytomy, which indicates a sin-

gle founder population that only relatively recently has expanded. 

In the Iberian Peninsula this salamander (S. salamandra) is highly diversified and ten 

subspecies are currently recognized (Salvador, 1974; Gasser, 1978; Joger &amp;amp; Steinfartz, 1994; 

Veith, 1994; Steinfartz et al., 2000): S. s. terrestris, S. s. almanzoris, S. s. bejarae, S. s. bernarde-

zi, S. s. fastuosa, S. s. gallaica, S. s. crespoi, S. s. morenica, S. s.  longirostris and S. s.  al-

fredschmidti (described recently in Köhler &amp;amp; Steinfartz 2006). With the exception of the first 

subspecies, they are considered as endemic of the Iberian Peninsula (Salvador &amp;amp; García-París 

2001; Köhler &amp;amp; Steinfartz 2006). It is currently under discussion if the subspecies S. s. longiros-

tris should be regarded as a different species, considering the results of the genetics studies by 

Steinfartz et al. 2000 and García-París et al. 2003. These two studies are important because 

they both show that the genetic lineages identified in the Iberian S. salamandra subspecies do 

not corroborate the nine subspecies that have been described in this geographic area as be-

longing to the polytypic species as described by Eiselt (1958) and Klewen (1991). García-París 

et al. (2003) analysed sequence variation in the mitochondrial gene cytochrome-b (cytb) in 

populations sampled throughout the Iberian Peninsula, and investigated the patterns of haplo-

type diversity within the three contact zones between the two viviparous subspecies (S. s. ber-

nardezi and S. s. fastuosa, which progeny consists of relatively developed small larvae that are 

directly released into streams and ponds) and the ovoviviparous surrounding populations (S. s. 

gallaica and S. s. terrestris). The subspecies S. s. longirostris was found not to belong to the 

same clade that the rest of the Iberian subspecies and the latter were divided into five distinct 

genetic lineages. Like in Steinfartz et al. 2000, S. s. crespoi and S. s. morenica are considered 

within the same lineage, whereas S. s. almanzoris appears as a separated lineage but still with-

in the same clade. A third lineage corresponds to the polytomy of the subspecies S. s. gallaica, 

S. s. terrestris, S. s. bejarae and the ovoviviparous populations of S. s. fastuosa. The other two 

lineages represent the viviparous populations of S. s. fastuosa and S. s. bernardezi. García-París 

et al. (2003) also showed discordances between classifications based on external morphology 

(this is the criteria currently used to recognize subspecies), nuclear DNA (allozyme studies; 

Alcobendas et al. 1996) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data, along two of the three contact 

zones in northern Spain. These discordances are a consequence of hybridization after second-

ary contact of previously isolated lineages (García-París et al. 2003).

The current distribution of mtDNA genetic variation among widespread temperate 

populations of different taxa is subdivided into patches of vicariant allospecies, subspecies, or 

ecotypes. The climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene led to range reductions, population ex-

tinctions, and isolation in southern refugia during glacial periods, followed by postglacial range 

expansions that generated parapatric distributions and secondary contact zones currently ob-

served (e.g. Bernatchez &amp;amp; Wilson 1998; Hewitt 1999; Zamudio &amp;amp; Savage 2003; Gómez &amp;amp; Lunt 

2007). The Iberian Peninsula was one of the most important Pleistocene glacial refugia in the 

European continent (Hewitt 1999; Hewitt 2001). There is growing genetic evidence for recent 

subdivision among multiple refugia since many species display a strong population substruc-

ture within the Iberian glacial refugium, with the reciprocal monophyly of phylogeographic 

lineages suggesting physically-separated histories throughout the Pleistocene. It is this lack of 

admixture between phylogeographic lineages, portrayed by geographically structured clades, 

which points to distinct Pleistocene ‘refugia-within-refugia’ (Gómez &amp;amp; Lunt 2007). Such in-

stances are seen in animals and plants such as Squalius (Brito et al. 1997; Coelho et al. 1998; 

Zardoya &amp;amp; Doadrio 1998), Discoglossus (García-París &amp;amp; Jockusch 1999), Chioglossa lusitanica 

(Alexandrino et al. 2000), Lacerta schreiberi (Paulo et al. 2001; Paulo et al. 2002), Natrix maura 

(Guicking et al. 2008), Oryctolagus cuniculus (Branco et al. 2000; Branco et al. 2002), Arvicola 

sapidus (Centeno-Cuadros et al. 2009), Elona quimperiana (Vialatte et al. 2008), Artemia salina 

(Muñoz et al. 2008), and Quercus (Olalde 2002).  

In Portugal, the fire salamander has a broad distribution but in the south it occurs 

within relatively small habitat patches, being absent in agricultural areas in the Baixo Alentejo 

region due to the lack of tree cover (Rebelo 2008). Climatic and habitat features shape the 

distribution of the two subspecies described in Portugal: S. s. gallaica (Seone, 1884) and S. s 

crespoi (Malkamus, 1983). The first corresponds to the most recent lineage in Steinfartz et al. 

(2000) and has a wider distribution, from the north of Portugal to the Alto Alentejo region. It is 

characterized by smaller adults with a predominantly dark colour, few large rounded yellow 

spots, and the occasional presence of red spots on the flanks and throat. S. s. crespoi belongs 

to the most ancient lineage in Steinfartz et al. (2000) and presents a more restricted distribu-

tion, being a Southern endemism in Portugal. This subspecies is characterized by a dorsal pat-

tern with numerous small and irregular yellow dots that often show an elongated form (Rebelo 

2008; Almeida et al. 2001). Although specimens from Portugal were included in the studies by 

Steinfartz et al. 2000 and García-París et al. 2003, only 2 and 3 individuals were analysed, re-

spectively, from the areas in which the two subspecies may contact. Besides, in one study 

(Steinfartz et al. 2000) a single sample from Alentejo was assigned to S. s. gallaica, whereas in 



5 
 

the other study (Garcia-Paris et al. 2003) a sample from the same region was assigned to S. s. 

crespoi.  

In fact, the limits of the distribution areas of the different S. salamandra subspecies 

remain mostly uncertain, emphasizing the need of more detailed studies at the spatial scale of 

the postulated geographic boundaries between subspecies. Martínez-Solano et al. (2005) car-

ried out a genetic survey, using the gene cytochrome-b and allozymes, on the endangered 

subspecies S. s. almanzoris, which is the subspecies with a more restricted distribution in the 

Iberia Peninsula. They were able to delimit the distribution area of the subspecies, but found 

discordance between the results of the different genetic markers, the coexistence of divergent 

mtDNA haplotypes in two populations, and discordance between external morphology and 

mtDNA haplotypes in different populations. These were suggested to be consequence of re-

cent events of secondary contact between S. s. almanzoris and other subspecies of S. sala-

mandra.  

 

Landscape genetics 

Defining the geographical boundaries between populations and subspecies is fre-

quently difficult because, as with the definition of species limits (but even more so), there are 

often areas of indeterminacy at prospective borders (Rowe &amp;amp; Beebee 2007). The detection of 

genetic boundaries in systems where species are either continuously or patchily distributed, 

and where discrete populations are not easily defined, may help to determine the underlying 

generating processes, such as important historical events (Miller et al. 2006) or current barri-

ers to gene flow (Coulon et al. 2006; Cushman et al. 2006; Safner et al. 2010). One approach 

being increasingly used to detect geographic boundaries between populations is landscape 

genetics (Manel et al. 2003).      

The discipline of landscape genetics is an emerging field that integrates population ge-

netics, landscape ecology and spatial statistics (Manel et al. 2003;  Storfer et al. 2007; 

Holderegger &amp;amp; Wagner 2008) and its original definition states that it aims to provide infor-

mation about the interaction between landscape features and microevolutionary processes 

(gene flow, genetic drift and selection) (Manel et al. 2003). It uses spatially explicit models to 

examine how landscape features affect the spatial distribution of genetic variation (Manel et 

al. 2003; Holderegger &amp;amp; Wagner 2006; Storfer et al. 2007).  

Storfer et al. (2010) reviews the several questions that have been addressed in land-

scape genetics: identification of genetic discontinuities, cryptic population boundaries, and 



6 
 

specific barriers to dispersal (Manni et al. 2004; Funk et al. 2005; Zannèse et al. 2006; Rowe &amp;amp; 

Beebee 2007; Latch et al. 2008; Gilles Guillot 2008), quantifying genetic diversity (Domínguez-

Domínguez et al. 2007; Segelbacher et al. 2008), inferring the effect of landscape change 

(Wagner et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2008), identification of migrants in relation to landscape con-

dition (Wilmer et al. 2008; Janssens et al. 2008), estimation of source-sink dynamics (Lowe et 

al. 2006; Martínez-Solano &amp;amp; González 2008), prediction of spread of disease (Foley et al. 2005; 

Wood et al. 2007; Deter et al. 2008) or invasive species (Lecis et al. 2007), and comparing ob-

served genetic patterns with contemporary and historic landscapes (Orsini et al. 2008; Spear &amp;amp; 

Storfer 2008). Landscape genetics is also useful to study gene flow between populations, sub-

species and species (Fitzpatrick &amp;amp; Shaffer 2007; Fitzpatrick et al. 2008; Dionne et al. 2008; 

Maletzky et al. 2010; Leaché 2011; Bolfíková &amp;amp; Hulva 2011), for instance to assess the pres-

ence of admixture or hybridization in zones of secondary contact. 

The landscape genetics approach does not require an a priori identification of discrete 

populations and considers the individual as the operational unit of analysis within the popula-

tion (Manel et al. 2003; Wright 1931). Landscape genetics usually focuses in relatively small 

spatial scales, where individuals of a study species are mostly closely related; hence its labora-

tory analysis has to rely on highly variable molecular markers that provide enough resolution 

power (Holderegger &amp;amp; Wagner 2008). Currently, two different types of genetic markers are 

dominant in landscape genetics, namely amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and 

single sequence repeats (SSRs), with the latter being the mostly used (Storfer et al. 2010). 

Landscape genetics uses several different methodological tools to identify genetic patterns: 

Wright’s FST, Mantel’s test, spatial autocorrelation, ordination analyses and synthesis maps, 

Bayesian clustering approaches, edge detection methods (Monmonier’s algorithm and Wom-

bling) and other individual-based methods (e.g. Manel et al. 2007; Murphy et al. 2008). 

Two general families of methodologies are currently used to identify boundaries in 

landscape genetics: edge detection methods and Bayesian clustering algorithms (Safner et al. 

2011). Edge detection methods identify areas where changes in variables occur from the anal-

ysis of allele frequency data, using approaches such as the Monmonier’s algorithm 

(Monmonier 1973) and wombling (Womble 1951; Barbujani et al. 1989). Bayesian clustering 

algorithms intend to identify discrete sets of individuals based on the analysis of multilocus 

genotypes (Pritchard et al. 2000; Corander et al. 2003). The softwares that use these algo-

rithms delineate clusters of individuals based on the analysis of individual genotypes, and also 

assign individuals to the identified cluster where their posterior probability is highest. In spatial 

models the probability that two individuals belong to a same cluster is influenced by their geo-



7 
 

graphic distance, whereas geographic proximity is ignored in non-spatial models (Safner et al. 

2011). In a recent comparison, Bayesian spatial clustering algorithms outperformed edge de-

tection methods, although all methods incorrectly detected boundaries in the presence of 

strong patterns of isolation by distance (Safner et al. 2011). 

 

Aims 

With this work I intended to a) determine the geographic distribution and limits of the 

two Portuguese Salamandra salamandra subspecies at the putative contact zone in the 

southwest of the country, using data from the mitochondrial gene cytochrome-b and mi-

crosatellites analysed with landscape genetics tools; b) investigate if the two subspecies are 

currently in allopatry as currently accepted  in Portugal, or if there is evidence of simpatry be-

tween the subspecies; c) evaluate the occurrence of gene flow between the named subspe-

cies;  d) characterize the population genetic diversity of S. salamandra in the study area.

Material and methods  

Tissue samples were collected from 102 adults, using either toe clippings from live an-

imals or muscle material from road kills, and from the tail tips of 116 larvae collected at 69 

different spawning sites, in a total of 216 samples for which the exact GPS coordinates were 

recorded.  Tissue was stored in DMSO-salt solution (Seutin et al. 1991). The DNA was extracted 

using the commercial kit EZNA Tissue DNA kit (Omega Bio-tek, Inc) following the manufactur-

er's instructions. 

 

Microsatellite genotyping and cytochrome-b sequencing  

DNA extracts were screened for 10 microsatellite loci: Sal E2, Sal E6, Sal E7, Sal E8, Sal 

E11, Sal E14, Sal 3, SST-A6II, SST-B11 and SST-C2 (Steinfartz et al. 2004, Hendrix et al. 2010). 

For all loci, the forward primers were labelled with a 5’ fluorescent tail (6-FAM and HEX) for 

visualization. Each 10-µL PCR reaction contained 50-100 ng of genomic DNA, 1× reaction buff-

er, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.5 µM of each primer, 1 µg BSA (Bovine Serum Albu-

min), and 0.75 U of the “hot-start” HotSurf Taq DNA polymerase (StabVida). Thermal cycling 

consisted of a “step down” protocol, with a first part with annealing temperature at 65ºC-60ºC 

(depending of the primer) for 15 cycles followed by a second part with 60ºC-55ºC of annealing 

temperature for 30 cycles. The loci were amplified individually and the PCR products ran in 

sets of two loci on an ABI 310 Capillary Electrophoresis Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). 

Fragments were sized with ROX-500 size standard, collected with GeneScan version 3.1, scored 

with Genemapper version 3.7 (Applied Biosystems), and the binning was performed with TAN-

DEM version 1.08 (Matschiner et al. 2009).  

In Steinfartz et al. 2000 they used a D-loop 738 bp fragment, where it is shown that in 

Salamander species D-loop is not as informative as in mammals since has a low divergence and 

also that the whole mitochondrium DNA seems to have the same substitution rate. While in 

García-París et al. 2003 is used a small fragment (372 bp) of cytochrome-b gene, hence in this 

work it was preferred to use also cytochrome-b gene but new primers were designed to ampli-

fy a longer fragment that would provide more information since it is used fresh samples.  

Amplification and sequencing of 702 base pairs (bp) of the mitochondrial gene cyto-

chrome-b were performed for a subset of 64 samples. The primers forward SALF 5?-

CCTGAAGTAGGAACCAGATG-3? and reverse SALR 5?-TCAAAGCTTACACCAGTCTTGTAAACC-3? 

were designed by aligning complete cytochrome-b sequences available in GenBank for several 



9 
 

species of amphibians. A 20-µL PCR reaction contained 50–200 ng of DNA, 1× reaction buffer, 2 

mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.2 µM of each primer, 2.2 µg BSA, and 1.25 U of SurfTaq 

DNA polymerase (StabVida). PCRs consisted of 35 cycles with a denaturing temperature of 94 

°C (30 sec), annealing temperature at 57 °C (45 sec) and extension at 72 °C (1 min). Double-

stranded amplification products were purified with ExoSAP (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Puri-

fied products were sequenced in both directions using the PCR primers and the Ez-Seq DNA 

sequencing service at Macrogen Inc., Europe. Cytochrome-b sequences were aligned using 

SEQUENCHER version 4.7 (Gene Codes Corporation). 

 

Microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA data analysis  

The software CREATE (Coombs et al. 2008) and PGDSPIDER (version 2.0.0.3, available 

from http://www.cmpg.unibe.ch/software/PGDSpider/) were used to facilitate input file prep-

aration for all the software used for microsatellite and mtDNA data analysis.  

The program ML-RELATE (Kalinowski et al. 2006) was used to calculate maximum like-

lihood estimates of relatedness and the likelihood of four pedigree relationships between each 

pair of individual samples: uncorrelated, half-sibs, full-sibs and parent–offspring. ML-RELATE 

uses maximum likelihood estimates of the frequency of null alleles in all calculations when null 

alleles are present. It calculates the likelihood of each relationship for each pair of individuals 

and generates a matrix of relationships with the highest likelihood, as well as a confidence set 

for the relationship between pairs of individuals such that relationships excluded from the 

confidence set can be ruled out as unlikely. 

To infer the number of populations in the sample set and to assign individual samples 

to these groups, three Bayesian clustering techniques were employed. First, I used the GEN-

ELAND software (version 3.3.0; Guillot et al. 2005b), which has been developed to optimize the 

delineation of subpopulations by incorporating spatial coordinates for each sample into the 

model. I varied K (the prior value for the number of subpopulations) from 1 to 10, using the 

matrix of genotypes, spatial coordinates for each individual (uncertainty was set at 0 as I gave 

a negligibly different coordinate to larvae samples taken from the same pond), and 10,000 

stored MCMC iterations (1,000,000 iterations, thinning of 100) that were run 5 times.  Allele 

frequencies were drawn from the uncorrelated frequency model that uses independent Di-

richlet distributions (Pritchard et al. 2000), as this model has been shown to perform better 

than the alternative model (F-model; (Guillot et al. 2005a). The maximum rate of the Poisson 

process, which controls the number of polygons in the geographical area under study, was set 



10 
 

to 100. This value corresponds to strongly fragmented partitions and weak dependence on the 

spatial organization of populations. In the spatially-explicit GENELAND model, subpopulations 

are assumed to be partitioned, by Voronoi tessellation, into a union of a random number of 

polygons that are randomly assigned to one of K possible spatial clusters (Dupanloup et al. 

2002). In this software the model is of the type free Voronoi tessellation, as the polygons are 

constructed independently of the sampling sites and are developed with basis on a continuous 

Poisson point process. Hence, the maximum number of nuclei within this tessellation was set 

to 300 (3 x maximum rate as suggested by Guillot et al. 2005a).  For all the runs, the posterior 

probability of subpopulation membership was computed for each pixel of the spatial domain 

(100 x 100 pixels), using a burn-in of 200 iterations.  

Second, I used the software BAPS 5.4 (Corander &amp;amp; Marttinen 2006; Corander et al. 

2008), which treats the number of populations as an unknown parameter that is directly in-

ferred from the data set without defining a prior estimate and also uses Voronoi tessellation 

but in this case it is based on discrete sampling sites. For inferring population structure in the 

mitochondrial (cytochrome-b) and nuclear data sets, the individuals were assigned using the 

models “clustering of linked loci” (Corander &amp;amp; Tang 2007) and “spatial clustering of individu-

als”, respectively. The first does not take into account spatial information while the second 

does. The software was run with a predefined maximum of k ranging from 1 to 6 and runs 

were repeated five times in order to check the stability of the results. The same clusters were 

assigned in all independent runs. The admixture analyses were performed based on the results 

of microsatellites mixture clustering, using 500 iterations and a number of 1000 reference in-

dividuals per population, each with 10 reiterations.  

Finally, I used the software STRUCTURE (version 2.3.3; Pritchard et al. 2000) to infer 

genetic structuring by assigning individuals to a number of genetic clusters (k) without prior 

knowledge of their affinities. The software defines clusters within which the loci are at Hardy-

Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and linkage equilibrium. This approach considers all clustering 

solutions to be equally likely and does not consider the geographic coordinates. This infor-

mation can however be used, after the data is processed, as a method to verify subpopulation 

membership in the output generated by the software. The best K is chosen by comparing the 

posterior probabilities for different K values using methods that are not free of some subjectiv-

ity. A typically used method is the one described by Evanno et al. (2005) but, according to 

Waples &amp;amp; Gaggiotti (2006), this method brings little improvement over previous ones. Using 

the options to ignore population affiliation when clustering individuals, assuming independ-

ence among loci and allowing admixture (thereby estimating the proportion of individuals with 



11 
 

ancestry in each cluster), I ran five independent runs of 1,000,000 iterations (following a burn-

in period of 100,000) for each value of k from 1 to 6 (Pritchard et al. 2000).  The online soft-

ware program STRUCTURE HARVESTER (version 0.6.7; Earl &amp;amp; VonHoldt 2011) was used to cal-

culate delta k. 

The subsequent analyses were done considering the clusters that were defined by the-

se Bayesian clustering software programs.  

In order to detect, within each population, genotyping errors due to the presence of 

null alleles, stuttering or large allele dropout, I used the bootstrap approach implemented in 

MICROCHECKER 2.2.3 (Van Oosterhout et al. 2004). Additionally, a maximum-likelihood esti-

mate of the frequency of null alleles was calculated using the software FREENA (Chapuis &amp;amp; 

Estoup 2007), which uses the algorithm of Dempster et al. (1977) and has been shown (Cha-

puis &amp;amp; Estoup 2007) to perform better than the other null allele frequency estimators available 

in MICROCHECKER.  Estimates of FST and Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards’ (1967) genetic distance 

were also calculated using, respectively, the correction methods ENA and INA proposed by 

Chapuis &amp;amp; Estoup (2007), and that have been shown to efficiently correct the positive bias 

induced by the presence of null alleles on these measures and provide accurate calculations in 

presence of null alleles. 

Three-dimensional factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) was performed to visualize 

patterns of differentiation between populations using the GENETIX program (version 4.05.2; 

Belkhir et al. 2004). The result of the FCA represents the relationship between individuals 

based on the detection of the best linear combination of allele frequencies. 

To assess migration, three approaches were used: the BAYESASS software (version 1.3; 

Wilson &amp;amp; Rannala 2003) that estimates current migration rates among populations, the 

USEPOPINFO model in STRUCTURE that uses the sampling locations to test for migrants, and 

the GENECLASS software (version 2.0; Piry et al. 2004) that has the ‘detection of first genera-

tion migrants’ function explicitly designed to identify first generation migrants (Paetkau et al. 

2004). BAYESASS relies on multilocus genotypes and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 

algorithm to estimate proportions of non-migrants as well as the source of migrants for each 

sampling site (Wilson &amp;amp; Rannala 2003). This software is a non-equilibrium Bayesian method 

that does not require data sets to conform to HWE proportions. I performed five independent 

replicate runs of the algorithm for 9,000,000 iterations with 3,000,000 iterations discarded as 

burn-in. Delta values of migration rate (?m), allele frequencies (?p) and inbreeding coefficient 

(?F) were, respectively, ?m = 0.15, ?p = 0.15, and ?F = 0.15, which yielded an average number 



12 
 

of changes in the accepted range. I performed the additional round of admixture clustering 

with STRUCTURE, now indicating the population of origin for each individual and setting the 

prior probability of each individual having pure ancestry from its assigned population at 0.95 

(USEPOPINFO option, MIGRPRIOR = 0.05), and the other parameters as described above. This 

model assumes that most individuals have pure ancestry but that a proportion of individuals 

may also have ancestry from other populations. GENECLASS uses several likelihood-based sta-

tistics, in combination with resampling methods, to calculate the first generation migrant 

probabilities. I used the L= L_home/L_max likelihood computation wherein L_home is the ratio 

of the likelihood of the individual genotype within the population where the individual has 

been sampled and L_max the highest likelihood value among all available population samples 

(Paetkau et al. 2004). To detect the first generation migrants, I used the Bayesian criterion of 

Rannala &amp;amp; Mountain (1997), in combination with the resampling method of Paetkau et al. 

(2004) to determine the critical value of the test statistic beyond which individuals were as-

sumed to be migrants. I selected an alpha level of 0.05 to determine critical values and 10,000 

as the number of simulated individuals. 

MSA (version 4.05; Dieringer &amp;amp; Schlötterer 2003) and GENEPOP (version 4.1, Rousset 

2008) were used to estimate genetic diversity in each obtained cluster as measured by the 

parameters number of alleles per locus (NA), allelic richness (AR), observed (Ho) and unbiased 

expected (He) heterozygosities, and to test for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and for 

linkage disequilibrium (LD) between loci. The HWE was verified testing for a deficiency of het-

erozygotes relative to Hardy–Weinberg expectations for each locus, using the Markov chain 

method for estimating P-values (Guo &amp;amp; Thompson 1992; parameter values of dememorization 

= 50,000,000, number of batches = 100, number of iterations per batch = 1,000,000). The same 

method was used to assess LD (parameter values of dememorization = 100,000,000, number 

of batches = 200, number of iterations per batch = 50,000,000). A sequential Bonferroni cor-

rection (Rice 1989) was used to control for multiple comparisons. 

Spatial structure was examined using a Mantel test, performed with GENALEX (version 

6.0; Peakall &amp;amp; Smouse 2006). The Mantel test was performed between the triangular matrix of 

pairwise geographical distances between individuals and the triangular matrix of pairwise ?st 

values between individuals. 

I used the software BOTTLENECK (version 1.2.02; Piry et al. 1999) to evaluate if there 

were signs of a genetic bottleneck signature in the microsatellite data. In particular, I carried 

out 100,000 replications using the infinite alleles model (IAM) and the stepwise mutation 



13 
 

model (SMM). The sign test compares the number of loci that present a heterozygosity excess 

relatively to the number of such loci expected by chance alone.  

For the analyses of mitochondrial DNA, I used a subset of 64 samples from the total 

sample set (N=203) that attempted to maintain the level of geographic coverage of the total 

sample set while minimising the eventual redundancy of using multiple samples from the same 

sampling sites (the used samples are identified in Appendix table 1). 

The median-joining algorithm in the software NETWORK (version 4.6.0.0; Bandelt et al. 

1999) was used to infer a network of haplotype relationships. Information on the geographic 

distribution of the haplotypes was subsequently added to the network using a colour code to 

represent geographic locations. 

Genetic diversity for the cytochrome-b fragment was measured in each population by 

the number of haplotypes, haplotype diversity (h) and nucleotide diversity (?) as estimated by 

DNASP (version 5.10.01; Librado and Rozas 2009). ARLEQUIN (version 3.5.1.2; Excoffier et al. 

2010) as used to estimate mean population pairwise FST statistics that were computed using 

the model of Tamura and Nei (1993). Significant departures from the null hypothesis (no ge-

netic differentiation) were tested using 10,000 permutations. 

The software ARLEQUIN was also employed to carry out two neutrality tests known for 

their additional ability to detect signatures of historical population expansion. The tests are 

Tajima’s D (Tajima 1989a, 1989b, 1993), which compares the number of segregating sites in 

the sample and a parameter based on the mean number of pairwise differences between hap-

lotypes, and Fu’s FS (Fu 1997), based on the probability of observing k alleles in a sample of a 

given size conditioned on the observed average number of pairwise differences. Also in order 

to test for demographic expansions, statistics based on the mismatch distribution were esti-

mated with ARLEQUIN. The mismatch distribution (MMD) is the observed distribution of pair-

wise differences between pairs of haplotypes. This distribution is usually multimodal in sam-

ples drawn from populations at demographic equilibrium, but it is usually unimodal in popula-

tions having passed through a recent demographic expansion (Rogers &amp;amp; Harpending 1992; 

Slatkin &amp;amp; Hudson 1991), or through a range expansion with high levels of migration between 

neighbouring demes (Ray et al. 2003; Excoffier 2004). The observed distribution of pairwise 

differences was calculated within each population and compared with the expected results 

under a sudden-demographic and a spatial-demographic expansion model. Statistically signifi-

cant differences between observed and simulated expected distributions were evaluated using 

the sum of the square deviations (SSD) and Harpending’s raggedness index (RAG) (Harpending 



14 
 

1994). The time since the expansion began was estimated using the MMD ? (tau, estimator of 

the time since expansion) with ? = 2 n ? TGt, where n is the number of nucleotides of the DNA 

sequence, ? is the substitution rate in mutations per site per year and TGt is the time in gener-

ations (Rogers &amp;amp; Harpending 1992).  

Population divergence time was estimated using the coalescent method described by 

Gaggiotti &amp;amp; Excoffier (2000), also implemented in ARLEQUIN. The method removes the effect 

of bottlenecks and unequal sizes of the derived populations, which can lead to the overestima-

tion of divergence times from genetic distances. Here ? (tau) is also the time estimator from 

genetic distance but its conversion to years before present is done with a slightly different 

formula: ? = 2 n ? T, where n is the number of nucleotides of the DNA sequence, ? is the sub-

stitution rate in mutations per site per year and T is time in years. Divergence time was also 

estimated using a similar equation DA = 2 n ? T in which n is the number of nucleotides of the 

DNA sequence, ? is the substitution rate in mutations per site per year, T is the divergence 

time, and DA is the net number of nucleotide differences between populations (Nei &amp;amp; Li 1979). 

 Population divergence time was also estimated using the software IMA (Hey &amp;amp; Nielsen 

2007), which implements a coalescent-based isolation with migration model and can be ap-

plied to genetic data drawn from a pair of closely related populations or species (Nielsen &amp;amp; 

Wakeley 2001) to infer some demographic parameters: effective population sizes of the pre-

sent and of the ancestor populations, migration rates between the daughter populations, and 

the splitting time (t). The program performs a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation 

with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, in which random samples from the joint posterior 

probability density of the model parameters are generated. To evaluate if the program has run 

for enough time, so that the sample has converged to the true posterior probability distribu-

tion, the effective Sample Size (ESS), which is a measure of the independence of the recorded 

values over the course of the run, should have values greater than 200 for any estimated pa-

rameter. Four replicate simulations were run after the preliminary runs to optimize settings. 

Simulations used 10 Markov chains, with 45 chain swap attempts per step, were run for 50 

million steps with the first 100,000 steps discarded as “burn-in”, and the genealogies were 

sampled every 100 steps. To convert coalescent times to years before present, I used a genera-

tion time of 5 years (Rebelo 2002) and a 0.8% per MYR substitution rate. Steinfartz et al. 

(2000) used this rate value, and stated that in salamanders the substitution rate seems overall 

uniform across the mitochondrial DNA, and studies in other urodeles have used similar rates 

(Tan &amp;amp; Wake 1995; Caccone et al. 1997; Mueller 2006).

Samples were col-

lected between 2008 and 

2010 from road kills, live 

adults, and larvae from 

ponds and small streams. 

During the fieldwork it was 

detected the presence of 

Salamandra salamandra in 

6 new 10 x 10 km UTM 

squares comparing the ac-

tual known distribution 

(Rebelo 2008). The 216 

samples were evaluated 

with the software ML-RELATE to remove all full-sibling and parent-offspring samples that could 

be present in the sampling.  Goldberg &amp;amp; Waits (2010) have shown that the removal of these 

relatives reduces the bias of sampling larvae and improves estimates of population genetic 

parameters in studies of amphibians. The full-siblings in a distance of approximately 1 km were 

removed. Three adults and 10 larvae were excluded, so the data set for subsequent analyses 

concerned 203 samples from 168 different sampling locations (fig. 2). All analyses were done 

with the samples ordered by geographical Y axes of their coordinates and no samples with 

missing data were taken into account. 

All the 10 loci were described as tetranucleotide microsatellite loci (Steinfartz et al. 

2004 and Hendrix et al. 2010), but in the populations analysed here the loci Sal E2 and Sal E11 

behaved like dinucleotide loci in terms of allele bins.  

 All the three software programs used to infer the number of clusters indicated the 

presence of 2 clusters (fig. 1). In GENELAND the samples were consistently assigned to the 

same cluster in all runs, even if the density for the best k was not much higher than 40% (Ap-

pendix fig. 1). In figures 1A and 1B it is visible that all samples were assigned with high proba-

bilities to each cluster and how the two clusters are spatially distributed. BAPS assigned almost 

all samples to the same two clusters that GENELAND detected. Because the spatial clustering 

of individuals (Corander et al. 2008) was used, the output of BAPS gives a spatial representa-

tion of the clustering. This allowed to identify three samples that should be migrants or ad-

mixed individuals (figures 1C and 1D).

STRUCTURE also identified k = 2 (fig. 1E) as best fitting the data, using the method of 

Evanno et al. (2005), but with more admixture that is probably due to the software sensitivity 

when the assumptions are not met (see below). Taking into account the findings of Safner et 

al. (2011), the clustering solution offered by GENELAND was considered the most reliable. The 

geographic boundary between the clusters seems to match with an area south of the River 

Sado in which no fire salamanders could be found despite being prospected several times in 

different times, seasons and years, for both adults and larvae. The distribution map with the 

samples assigned to each of the two clusters is presented in fig. 2. Given that the geographic 

location of the clusters correspond to the areas north and south of the detected boundary 

they are henceforth designated, respectively, as “Northern” (80 individuals) and “Southern” 

(123 individuals). 

After the population genetic structure of the data was identified, the presence of null 

alleles in the analysed microsatellite loci was tested using two methodologies: the algorithm of 

Oosterhout et al. (2004), incorporated in the software MICROCHECKER, and the algorithm of 

Dempster et al. (1977) integrated in the software FREENA. The second estimator was chosen 

because it has been shown to perform better than the other estimators available in MICRO-

CHECKER (Chapuis and Estoup 2007). MICROCHECKER found no evidence for scoring errors due 

to stuttering or large allele dropout, but 

found evidence for null alleles in some of 

the loci.  

Among the 10 analysed loci, only 

two consistently exhibited signs of the 

presence of null alleles with both ap-

proaches and in both clusters (table 1). 

Given the results of MICROCHECKER, the 

Bayesian clustering analyses to infer the 

number of clusters were repeated using 

only the eight loci not showing signs of 

the presence of null alleles, and the re-

sults did not visibly differ from the anal-

yses using the 10 loci (Appendix fig. 1).  Chapuis and Estoup (2007) described a method that 

allows estimating the FST following Weir (1996) and the Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards' (1967) 

genetic distance from microsatellite data sets harbouring null alleles. The corrected FST be-

tween the two clusters was 0.034309 and the uncorrected one was 0.034998, while the cor-

ic distance was 

0.338510 and the 

uncorrected one 

was 0.329332. This 

shows that, despite 

the presence of null 

alleles in two of the 

10 analysed loci, 

analyses using the 

whole data set do 

not seem to be 

much affected by the presence of null alleles, and thus the subsequent analyses were always 

done using all of the 10 loci.  

 Factorial correspondence analysis also identified two clusters (fig. 3) in a three-

dimensional space without a priori information on population structure. The axes 1 to 3 ex-

plain 6.68% of the variation among the two 

clusters and the two clusters appear close 

to each other. The result also indicates that 

some individuals might be genetically ad-

mixed or migrants. 

 The proportion of migrants re-

ceived and given by each cluster was esti-

mated using BAYESASS (table 2). It indicat-

ed low migration rates between clusters and very high migration rates within clusters, results 

that suggest a strong isolation between the two populations.

migrants, but none presented a probability inferior to 0.5 of belonging to the originally as-

signed cluster (fig. 4). Bearing in mind the presence of null allele loci the cut-off value was low-

ered to 0.9, in this way when considering probabilities inferior to 0.9 (Appendix table 1) several 

individuals appear as admixed, which could be a sign of past gene flow 

 GENECLASS identified 10 migrants (Appendix table 1). Considering this result and the 

ones from STRUCTURE and BAPS concerning migrants, it was possible to detect eight migrants 

between the two clusters (represented by filled triangles in the distribution map) that were 

identified by at least two of the three methods. 

Since the presence of null alleles could affect the evaluation of genetic variability in 

each cluster, I used the mean expected heterozygosity (He, Nei 1987) because the presence of 

null alleles has only a limited effect on this statistic (Chapuis &amp;amp; Estoup 2007). Overall, the 10 

loci and both populations showed high genetic variability. 

Correlation between genetic and geographic distances was assessed for each popula-

tion by Mantel tests. For the Northern population it had a p-value of 0.043 and a Pearson cor-

relation coefficient (R) of 0.063, while for the Southern population it had a p-value = 0.01 and 

R = 0.156. Although the null hypothesis of a random genetic distribution of individuals can be 

rejected, the support for isolation-by-distance (IBD) was low to moderate.  

The allele frequency distribution test showed that no shift in distribution could be de-

tected for both populations, which remained in a normal L-shape (Appendix fig. 3), so the mi-

crosatellite data indicates that both populations did not undergo a recent bottleneck.

Mitochondrial DNA 

The median-joining haplotype network based on cytochrome-b sequences of 64 sam-

ples and constructed with the software NETWORK revealed two main groups of haplotypes 

separated by 20 mutations (fig. 5A). The Northern population is mainly characterised by two 

divergent haplotypes separated by 10 mutations and one sample was identified as a migrant in 

the Southern population. In this population, four haplotypes were uncovered and a fifth close-

ly-related haplotype was found in two individuals sampled in the Northern population.  

 BAPS produced similar results (fig. 5B) to the ones given by NETWORK, identifying 3 

clusters: Southern and two clusters within the Northern population. It also detected the same 

three samples as from likely migrants. When comparing these migrant individuals detected 

from cytochrome-b data with the ones detected with microsatellites, only one individual was 

identified as a migrant by both markers. This individual is likely to represent a very recent mi-

gration event. 

Estimates of genetic diversity obtained from the 702 bp cytochrome-b fragment are 

presented in table 4.  Although more samples were analysed in the Southern population, with 

the exception of haplotype diversity, most diversity measures were lower in this population 

than in the Northern population. Mean population pairwise FST between Northern and South-

ern populations was high (0.75115).

The mismatch distribu-

tion computed for the North-

ern population showed, either 

using the sudden expansion 

model (PSSD = 0.1659, PRAG = 

0.3246) or the spatial expan-

sion model (PSSD = 0.4777, PRAG 

= 0.564), that this population is in demographic equilibrium. In the Southern population, the 

PSSD = 0.0759 in the sudden expansion model also suggested demographic equilibrium but the 

PRAG = 0.0145 of the same model and the spatial expansion model (PSSD = 0.0077, PRAG = 0.0132) 

indicate that this population should have undergone a recent demographic expansion.  

Further assessment of past demography was provided by applying the neutrality tests 

Tajima’s (1989) D and Fu’s (1997) FS. For the Northern population, the results of Tajima’s D (D 

= 0.05967, PD = 0.5767) were in agreement with a demographic equilibrium, whereas Fu’s FS (FS 

= -23.49389, PFS = 0.000) was not. For the southern population, past population expansion was 

supported by both tests (D = -2.29332, PD = 0.0013; FS = -26.93731, PFS = 0.000). 

The time since the beginning of this expansion was estimated using the mismatch dis-

tribution approach (Rogers &amp;amp; Harpending 1992) and the sudden and the spatial expansion 

models gave similar ? (tau): 1.053 and 1.052, respectively. This is respectively translated into 

an expansion time at 18,750 years before present (BP) with a 95% confidence interval of 4,274 

– 32,835 years BP and at 18,732 years BP with a 95% confidence interval of 6,695 – 29,879 

years BP. 

The four simulations of the isolation with migration model implemented in IMa pro-

duced similar parameter estimates and distributions, with ESSs exceeding 200 for each esti-

mated parameter. The results of IMa suggest that the Northern and Southern populations 

diverged 208,333 years BP (90% HPD = 103,785 – ?) considering a 0.8% per million years muta-

tion rate and 5 years as generation time. The credibility intervals were recorded as the 90% 

HPD interval, which represents the shortest span that includes 90% of the probability density 

of the parameter, but the upper bound for the credibility interval is not given since it critically 

depends on the assumed prior for the maximum value of t when the curve slowly decreases to 

zero after the mode of t (Johnson et al. 2007; Guillaumet et al. 2008). The approach of Gag-

giotti and Excoffier (2000) estimated the divergence between the Northern and Southern pop-

ulations at 957,975 years BP (? = 10.76). The population pairwise genetic distance DA between

Discussion 

The loci used in this work were chosen from the only two published panels of mi-

crosatellites for Salamandra salamandra (Steinfartz et al. 2004, Hendrix et al. 2010), but they 

presented some problems in the populations studied here in terms of null alleles. I tested oth-

er loci from the same panels but they were discarded because they showed weak amplification 

(Sal 29 and SST-G6) and binning problems likely due to false alleles (Sal23 and Sal E12). These 

difficulties were surprising because Hendrix et al. (2010) tested for the correlation between 

cross-amplification success and genetic distance within the Salamandridae family, and most of 

the used loci in this work had amplification success across species of the genus Salamandra 

(except for SST-C2 and Sal E11). This shows that although cross-amplification tests provide an 

useful preliminary insight of which primers might be employed in different species, there is no 

guarantee that the loci will be problem-free and not show deviations of Hardy-Weinberg equi-

librium (HWE) caused by multiple distinct factors, even when marker transfer is just between 

subspecies of the species in which the microsatellites were isolated. 

The determination of the population genetic structure in the dataset, previous to car-

rying out tests of HWE, linkage disequilibrium (LD) and null alleles, was important to remove 

the Wahlund effect (which was shown to be strong here) before assessing the quality of each 

locus for population genetic analysis. This approach allowed identifying the only loci (two) that 

showed unambiguous and consistent signs of null alleles. 

ML-RELATE was used to detect samples with parent-offspring or full-sibling relation-

ships, so that one of the individuals in each such pair could be removed. The use of this soft-

ware allowed using the data of the two loci with null alleles because it has been shown (Wag-

ner et al. 2006) that the method incorporated in ML-RELATE to deal with null alleles performs 

better than ignoring the presence of null alleles or discarding the affected loci.  

Concerning the three Bayesian clustering methods, to check the impact of the null al-

leles, I repeated all the analyses without the two loci with null alleles identified in both clus-

ters, and overall they gave the same results (Appendix fig. 1).  To assess if the loci with null 

alleles could have an effect in measures of genetic distance and genetic differentiation I ap-

plied the correction method of Chapuis and Estoup (2007) implemented in FREENA. This ap-

proach indicated that the loci with null alleles did not influence significantly those measures 

and, therefore, final analyses were done using the 10 loci.   



24 
 

The three Bayesian clustering algorithms identified two clusters, one in the north of 

the study area that I designated “Northern” and can be associated with S. s. gallaica and the 

other that I designated “Southern” and can be associated with S. s. crespoi. Despite this con-

gruent main result, slight differences were identified between the results of the three meth-

ods. GENELAND did not detect any migrants, BAPS showed some migrants, and STRUCTURE 

indicated some signs of admixture. Previous studies have noted that different clustering algo-

rithms can infer different solutions. For instance, Rowe &amp;amp; Beebee (2007) reported non-

congruent outputs from BAPS, GENELAND, and STRUCTURE, in terms of the estimated number 

of clusters. The results here do not show such level of incongruence between methods most 

likely because of the strong pattern of differentiation between the two subspecies, but it is 

worth noting that the slight differences detected could be due to differences in the underlying 

models, in the statistical estimators, or in the approximations in the algorithms used to com-

pute the estimators. It is important to mention that all the programs use the genetic infor-

mation to ascertain population membership of individuals without assuming predefined popu-

lations, operate by minimizing Hardy–Weinberg and linkage disequilibria, and the assignment 

of each individual genotype to its population of origin is carried out probabilistically using Mar-

kov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The use of MCMC is prone to convergence issues, this is, the 

software outputs might not be in certain cases the exact solution of the mathematical equa-

tions but an approximation which quality remains unknown. 

The two obtained clusters seem separated by a narrow gap of 20Km in width that cor-

responds, approximately, to an area where the Sado River passes plus a belt of sandy soil 

south of it. Results from the analyses of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome-b indicated a simi-

lar partition boundary. Finally, despite repeated and intensive sampling efforts, no individuals 

could be found within the area. The fact that both mtDNA and microsatellites concur in sug-

gesting a very reduced gene flow across the gap indicates that it has been a strong barrier both 

historically and contemporarily. Of all the methods used, only the ordination of individuals 

using the factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) did not show a discrete separation of the 

populations. However, it is known that the FCA may not have the needed resolution power 

when genetic differentiation as measured by FST is low, as is the case here (FST = 0.034). Despite 

strong isolation between populations, FST values can be low if gene flow, albeit very restricted, 

is historically recurrent.   

The low migration rates detected with the software BAYESASS between the two sub-

species are consistent with the hypothesis of a strong barrier separating them. Additionally, 

BAPS only identified three migrants, STRUCTURE (when defining the populations a priori) de-



25 
 

tected few admixed individuals, and GENECLASS found 10 migrants. When considering as mi-

grants only those individuals indicated by two or more software, eight individuals were identi-

fied among the 203 analysed individuals, again consistent with a scenario of reduced gene 

flow. The analyses of mtDNA found three migrants within the 64 surveyed individuals. Of the 

eight migrants detected with microsatellites only four were sequenced for their mtDNA, but 

one individual was identified has migrant by both genetic markers (Appendix table 1). The 

three migrants identified by microsatellites but not by mtDNA are recent but most likely less 

than the individual in which both markers concur. The very low number of migrants in terms of 

mtDNA is evidence for a historically very reduced gene flow. 

The two migrants detected in the Northern population by their mtDNA presented a 

haplotype closely related but distinct of the haplotypes found in all individuals of the Southern 

population, which suggests a different source. I hypothesise that these migrants possibly origi-

nated from a different area, south of the Guadiana River, of the distribution of S. s. crespoi. To 

test this hypothesis it is necessary to study in the future the contact zone of the two Portu-

guese subspecies in southeast Portugal.   

It was detected isolation-by-distance (IBD) patterns in both populations but relatively 

weak as measured by the low correlation coefficients in the Mantel tests. However, it was not 

detected any indication of substructure within each population (Appendix fig. 4), a finding that 

is consistent with the presence of IBD. Possibly, the IBD patterns detected in both populations 

are real but high correlation coefficients in the Mantel tests would only be observed with a 

more numerous and dense sampling from each population. Alternatively, the spatial arrange-

ment of the genetic variation in the populations might be better described by an isolation-by-

resistance (IBR) model which predicts a closer fit of genetic distance with resistance distance 

than with Euclidian geographic distance (McRae 2006). The IBR model attempts to account for 

the effect of habitat heterogeneity in shaping IBD patterns. To test this alternative, in addition 

to an improved sampling it would be necessary to construct a Geographic Information System 

(GIS) for the study area. 

No signs of recent bottlenecks were detected in the microsatellite data from both 

populations. However, a bottleneck was suggested by the mtDNA data for the Southern popu-

lation, which coherently exhibited the lowest nucleotide and haplotype diversities. Support for 

a sudden demographic expansion in the Southern population comes from its unimodal mis-

match distribution and from a small value of the raggedness index (=0.0132). This suggests 

that, although both populations might be large for some time now, S. s. crespoi underwent 



26 
 

previously a expansion from a small population size. The time estimator (tau) of the mismatch 

distribution (MMD) dated this expansion around 18,000 years ago and this date is congruent 

between the two MMD models (sudden expansion and spatial expansion) used. This date is 

compatible with a scenario in which, during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (between 26,500 

and 19,000–20,000 years ago; Clark et al. 2009), S. s. crespoi suffered a severe demographic 

contraction and, after the LGM, the population recovered rapidly with the return of favourable 

climatic conditions.  The support of the data for a spatial expansion of S. s. crespoi after the 

LGM opens the possibility that the present geographic proximity between the two subspecies 

in an almost parapatric distribution, might have been established relatively recently. This 

would be in agreement with the very reduced number of migrants detected between subspe-

cies. Also, around 18,000 years ago almost all of the Portuguese continental shelf was above 

sea level, which allowed the confluence of northern Portuguese rivers (Rodrigues and Dias, 

1989) and one may hypothesize that a similar phenomenon could have happened with the 

southern rivers. Enlarged and connected, the Sado and Guadiana Rivers, even if allowing some 

gene flow northwards, would have bogged down the expansion of S. s. crespoi. After the con-

traction and split of the river basins, the soil characteristics of many of the exposed riverbeds 

created strong barriers to dispersal. It is feasible that this scenario for the contraction and ex-

pansion of S. s. crespoi in southern Portugal has been replayed along the glacial-interglacial 

cycles of the Late Pleistocene. 

The idea of this subspecies to have survived the LGM in a refuge in western Algarve, an 

area known to have been a refuge and a hotspot of evolutionary diversification for several 

taxa (Mesquita et al. 2005, Martinez-Solano et al. 2006, Fritz et al. 2006), would also agree 

with the fact that within this area (Serra de Monchique) the external morphological character-

istics of the individuals are the more conspicuously typical of S. s. crespoi. 

 Three methods were used to estimate the divergence time between the two popula-

tions, as this parameter could provide further valuable insights into their evolutionary history. 

The estimate derived from DA (Nei &amp;amp; Li 1979) was 1.4 million years and the method of Gaggiot-

ti &amp;amp; Excoffier (2000) estimated it around 958,000 years ago. However, it needs to be empha-

sized that the two methods assume complete isolation of the daughter populations after the 

split, so they accommodate poorly instances of recurrent gene flow, as it seems to be the case 

here. In such cases, these methods tend to overestimate population divergence time and their 

results here fall somewhat halfway between the IMa estimate and the phylogenetic dating for 

the divergence of the lineages leading to the subspecies crespoi and gallaica (Steinfartz et al. 

2000). The software IMa belongs to a recent set of programs, based in coalescent genealogies, 



27 
 

which generally are more powerful and robust than the two methods above to infer popula-

tion parameters (Kuhner 2009). In particular, IMa is explicitly designed to take into account 

recurrent gene flow after population split (i.e. the last “moment” in which subpopulations 

were connected by “abundant” gene flow) (e.g. Palsboll et al. 2004). The IMa estimate was 

around 208,000 years BP. 

Due to the stochastic nature of mutation and lineage sorting, estimated divergence 

times from genetic patterns must be considered only as rough approximations of the timing of 

historical events. Factors like the uncertainty on the substitution rate for the DNA region under 

study, unsampled populations, and small sample sizes, increase confidence limits on diver-

gence time estimates. Keeping this in mind, I discuss below possible environmental correla-

tions that could explain the indication by the mtDNA data of genetic connectivity between the 

two subspecies in the study area at around 210,000 years BP. 

Around 220,000-210,000 years BP there is evidence for a period of warm and wet cli-

mate and expansion of Quercus forests in western Iberia (Desprat et al. 2006, Roucoux et al. 

2006), which corresponds to a period of global favourable climate between the oxygen isotope 

stages (OIS) 7c and 7a. Besides a short peak of similar climate around 120,000 years ago, only 

today the climate in Europe is as favourable as at the OIS 7c-7a interval (Tzedakis et al. 1997). 

A warm and wet climate is likely to have led to an enlarged and tributary-rich Sado River that, 

together with an expanded forested habitat, would have facilitated gene flow to levels without 

any parallel since then. The fact that the Guadiana drainage was probably an affluent of the 

Sado River until the end of the Middle Pleistocene (Vidal et al. 1993) offers further support to 

the idea that expanded riverine connections, together with abundant forested land-cover, 

could have allowed substantial genetic exchange between the two subspecies across Alentejo. 

It has been suggested that in amphibians, large rivers, such as Douro and Tagus, pre-

vent dispersal of individuals between distant across river locations (Alexandrino et al. 2000; 

Martinez-Solano 2004). However, although the phylogeography of S. s. gallaica has not been 

examined yet in detail across its whole range, it is possible that this subspecies managed to 

cross these two large rivers. Moreover, although salamander adults seem to have a reduced 

dispersal capacity (Rebelo &amp;amp; Leclair 2003; Schmidt et al. 2007), juveniles or larvae can be 

transported by runoff water or floods) and undergo sweepstake dispersal (possibly across large 

distances). 

The modelling of the distribution of Salamandra salamandra in south Portugal showed 

that a large percentage of the distribution can be explained by the absence of sand, pebbles 



28 
 

and clays (Appendix fig. 5; Simões et al. in prep.). This suggests that the strong barrier detected 

in this study is probably the consequence of the combined effect of the Sado River and the 

area of unsuitable habitat south of it. Presently, it is perhaps this belt of unsuitable habitat of 

sandy soil the most important component of the boundary between the two subspecies in 

southwest Portugal. The very reduced gene flow detected between these populations is inter-

preted as the result of rare and stochastic dispersal events up and down the Sado River. 

 In the near future I pretend to assess some of the hypotheses raised by this study, the 

first using a landscape genetics approach to examine the intraspecific patterns of the fire sal-

amander in Portugal. Among them, the possible migration route across the Guadiana in the 

southeast of the country and, connected with this, the probable absence of the species in cen-

tral Alentejo before it became an agricultural area in the Middle Ages. It will also be important 

to test the isolation-by-resistance hypothesis and correlate the resistance matrix obtained 

from an habitat suitability map with the genetic distance matrix, in order to better understand 

which landscape features and variables influence the genetic structure of the species.

Appendix  
 

 

 
Appendix fig. 1 Bayesian clustering results based on the 8 microsatellite loci without null alleles. A and B: maps of posterior probability 
for each cluster accordingly with GENELAND. These maps are a tessellations analysis representation with the probability that a sample 
belongs to a particular group ranging from low (dark colour) to high (light colour). C and D: results from BAPS; C is a spatial Voronoi 
tessellation representation of the admixture plot (D) in which each bar represents an individual. Northern population represented by 
green and Southern by red.  Another two migrants were detected without the two null alleles loci. E: STRUCTURE plot for the best-
supported k (=2) as inferred with the method of Evanno et al. (2005); each bar represents an individual. Northern population repre-
sented by green and Southern by red.

Appendix table 1 Samples (N), UTM geographic coordinates (X, Y), cluster assigned to each sample by the Bayesian clustering methods and the three programs used to identify the migrants. BAPS 
population assignment to cluster 1 or to cluster 2, to GENECLASS is presented the -log10 (L_home /L_max) and nonmigrant probability (p-value&lt;0.05); and to STRUCTURE is presented q-values 
when using a MIGRPRIOR&lt;0.05. Within each analysis significant values are indicated with dark grey (in STRUCTURE the cut-off is 0.9), migrants identified by two or more programs are indicated 
with light grey. In bold, samples also analysed by mitochondrial DNA. * Migrants only detected by the 8 loci analysis. ** Migrants obtained by mitochondrial DNA analyses.
