ABSTRACT 

This work aims to evaluate the Soy Moratorium, an industry led initiative to curb deforestation 

in the Amazon Biome. Under this agreement, all signatories commit to not buy soybeans 

produced in lands deforested after July 2006. There is no effective evaluation of this program 

and the literature in economics have not addressed the question of whether a market ban could 

reduce deforestation. My main specification is a triple-difference estimate and I find that, unlike 

previous evaluations, the moratorium had no effect to reduce deforestation.  

Keywords: Amazon Biome. Deforestation. Soy Moratorium. Embargo. 

 

  



RESUMO 

Este trabalho tem por objetivo avaliar a Moratória da Soja, uma iniciativa privada para reduzir 

o desmatamento no Bioma Amazônia. Sob esse acordo, todos os signatários se comprometem 

a não comprar a soja produzida em terras que foram desmatadas a partir de julho de 2006. Até 

hoje, não foram feitas boas avaliações desse programa e a literatura de economia desconhece a 

efetividade de embargos a produtos como ferramenta de combate ao desmatamento. A principal 

especificação econométrica deste trabalho consiste numa estimação em diferenças triplas e 

resulta, diferentemente das avaliações anteriores, na avaliação de que a moratória não foi capaz 

de reduzir o desmatamento na Amazônia.

1 INTRODUCTION 

 

 

The Amazon forest is the world’s biggest tropical forest and losing it may have grave effects 

on the South American climate. Nobre (2014) makes a review of the literature on the relation 

between climate and the Amazonian forest cover and describes the forest’s importance to the 

hydrologic cycle of the south-central part of South America. According to the report, “[f]or the 

most deforested portion of the Amazon a progressive delay is already observed in the onset of 

the wet season, which has a profound effect on the agricultural sector”. 

In Brazil, there are many efforts to reduce deforestation and most of them happen under the 

Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (Plano de 

Prevenção e Controle do Desmatamento na Amazônia Legal, PPCDAm), a holistic plan that 

integrates the actions of many government institutions. Some efforts, however, are not 

government led as the PPCDAm. 

One factor that has been seen as an important deforestation driver is the soybean expansion into 

the Amazon Biome (Fearnside (2001), Casa Civil (2004), Watts (2005), Greenpeace (2006)). 

After Greenpeace organizing a protest at the port of one of the main soy exporters in the 

Amazon and releasing a report on the threats posed by the soy expansion into the forest, the 

industry signed an agreement in response to the reputational threat it then faced. Under the Soy 

Moratorium, as it is known, the members of the two biggest buyers’ associations in the Amazon 

Biome committed to not buy any soy produced in areas deforested after July 2006. Although it 

has been seen as a successful initiative to reduce deforestation, many of its evaluations are 

flawed for not using a careful empirical methodology and, therefore, cannot distinguish between 

the moratorium’s and the PPCDAm’s effects1. To address this problem, I estimate the effect of 

the Soy moratorium on annual forest loss using a triple-difference identification strategy. 

The literature points that conservation policies are highly dependent on location targeted 

(Andam et al. (2008); Pfaff et al. (2009)). Also, there is evidence that a market ban may be 

effective to stop the commercialization of the banned good (Schlenker and Villas-Boas (2009), 

Lemieux and Clarke (2009)). This effectiveness, however, depend on the producers’ capacity 

to escape the ban (Lemieux and Clarke (2009), Soares and Chimeli (2011)). Also, a market ban

may as well as have unintended consequences, such as the increase of violence related to the 

now illegal good (Soares and Chimeli (2011)). 

The Soy Moratorium, unlike the previous studied bans, is an industry led initiative and the 

question is if it can be effective even without the coercive power of the State. The Fair Trade 

literature, as presented by Nunn et al. (2014), hints that it can. What raises concern, however, 

is the fact that the firms enforcing the moratorium are the same potentially harmed by it, since 

it could result in higher soy prices. Another reason the agreement may fail is poor land tenure, 

as it makes difficult for proper accountability: if the monitoring can’t correctly identify the 

owner of a non-complying soy plantation, then they won’t fear being excluded from the market. 

My empirical strategy uses the design of the Soy Moratorium monitoring to select treatment 

and control groups. The monitoring focus on lands inside the Amazon Biome and only on the 

states of Mato Grosso, Rondônia and Pará. It also restricts to counties inside those states with 

over 5,000 hectares in soy planted. Therefore, I use non-soy producing counties (those with less 

than 5,000ha in soy planted) to control for soy producing ones (those with at least 5,000ha in 

soy planted) hoping to net out any effect on deforestation caused by other factors occurring 

inside the Amazon Biome, such as the PPCDAm policies. Since this does not net out effects 

due to factors differentially affecting producers and non-producers, I also use the Cerrado 

Biome to control for the Amazon Biome. 

For each county in these groups I use georeferenced data for the Legal Amazon on soy planted 

area to sort them into soy producers and non-soy producers. I also use georeferenced data on 

deforestation to calculate two different measures: deforestation rate, defined as the share of the 

current deforestation increment on the previous year remaining forest and the normalized 

deforestation, defined as the deviation in standard deviations from the time mean of each county 

deforestation increment. I then use these measures in two different specifications: two double-

differences and one triple-difference. One double-difference captures differential effects of the 

PPCDAm policies on each biome while the other captures differential effects on soy producing 

and non-producing counties. The triple-difference captures the causal effect of the Soy 

Moratorium on deforestation. 

Since soy production is mainly concentrated near the biomes’ frontier, I also estimate those 

same equations for three different samples. One includes all counties inside the Amazon Biome 

while the other two exclude non-producing counties inside the Amazon Biome more than 

100km and 10km away, respectively, from producers. 



10 
 

 

My identification assumption is that, on the absence of the agreement, the difference in the 

deforestation measure between soy producing and non-soy producing counties inside the 

Amazon Biome would have followed the same trend as the difference in the deforestation 

measure between soy producing and non-soy producing counties on the Cerrado portion of the 

Legal Amazon. To test it, I test for pre-trends equality in all estimations. I do not reject the 

common pre-trends assumption for the sample of Amazon Biome’s counties within 10km from 

soy producers and, therefore, my results are drawn from it. I find evidence that the Soy 

Moratorium had no effect to reduce deforestation in soy producing counties relative to non-

producers. This result, however, is not robust: in the full sample, the pre-trends estimates’ 

significance is sensitive to functional form. 

I interpret this finding as evidence that either the Soy Moratorium cannot curb deforestation at 

all or that PPCDAm policies are already doing everything the moratorium could have done and 

the agreement cannot contribute any further. This may be due to lack of enforcement or because 

producers are able to escape the moratorium by displacing less lucrative agricultural products 

into native forests and then planting soy on the now vacant land. If, for example, the farmer 

produces both soybeans and cattle, it could expand soy production into the pasturelands and 

displace the cattle to another area, which may need to be deforested prior to the displacement. 

The remainder of this work is organized as follows: in Section 2, I describe the related literature; 

in Section 3, I provide the background on the deforestation in the Amazon at the time of the 

moratorium’s implementation and on the agreement itself; in Section 4, I describe the data used 

and the deforestation measures; in Section 5, I present my empirical strategy and tests for the 

pre-trends assumption, also explaining how I use the moratorium’s monitoring criteria to sort 

counties into treatment and control groups; results are presented in Section 6 and discussed in 

Section 7; Section 8 concludes.

2 RELATED LITERATURE 
 

 

This work is related to the literatures on deforestation policies, labelling and market bans. 

Soybean is a major cash crop in Brazil and the Soy Moratorium acts upon a well-established 

market, where producers are well integrated with the rest of the supply chain. Pfaff (2013) 

makes an overview of studies on policy impacts on deforestation in this kind of setting. In the 

classic land use model, producers decide whether to deforest a land site or to manage the forest 

to maximize expected profits. Factors that affect profits include input and output prices, 

transportation costs and risk of expropriation, in the case of insecure land tenure. The empirical 

evidence on conservation policies of these studies is that they are highly dependent on the 

location targeted: protected areas, for instance, have greater impact the less isolated are the 

lands at which they are instated (Andam et al. (2008); Pfaff et al. (2009)). 

Other studies have shown the role a broader policy, the Action Plan for the Prevention and 

Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (Plano de Prevenção e Controle do 

Desmatamento na Amazônia Legal, PPCDAm), has played on the sharp reduction of 

deforestation in the Legal Amazon. Assunção, Gandour and Rocha (2015) disentangle the 

effects of prices and PPCDAm policies and show that it has saved 56%, from 2005 to 2009, of 

lands that would have been cleared if this plan had not been implemented. Burgess, Costa and 

Olken (2016) use RDD on the Brazilian borders with other seven South American countries, 

where 35% of the Amazon forest is, to show these policies were impactful even on lands where 

the state officials have a difficult access. 

The Soy Moratorium, however, is not one these policies and, to the best of my knowledge, the 

economics literature has not studied yet the effects of a market ban on deforestation. There are 

works, on the other hand, that analyze its effects on different settings and outcomes, such as 

cattle prices (Schlenker and Villas-Boas (2009)) and illegal poaching (Lemieux and Clarke 

(2009)), and they suggest its effectiveness is not assured and can have unintended 

consequences. For instance, Schlenker and Villas-Boas (2009) use a detailed scanner dataset 

from a large U.S. grocery chain and from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to assess the effect 

of two warnings on the mad cow disease: first on the Oprah Winfrey Show and, seven years 

later, by government officials. They document a decrease in beef sales and abnormal price drops 

for future cattle following the warnings. Lemieux and Clarke (2009) shows a positive effect of 

the 1989 ivory sales ban on the African elephant population, intended to stop its fast decline 



12 
 

 

due to illegal poaching, although 37 countries were not able to enforce it and continued to watch 

their elephant population decline. 

Soares and Chimeli (2011) studies the effect on violence of a ban on big leaf mahogany sales 

in Brazil in 2004. They show that homicides rates have increased as consequence of the 

illegalization of this market. They also show that sales had persisted over the time, as sellers 

could mask the mahogany cargoes as “other tropical timber species”. Also, Dell (2014) find a 

positive effect of crackdowns in violence in Mexico after conservative National Action Party’s 

(PAN) candidates have won close elections. The relative increased action to combat drug 

trafficking following these victories have led rival factions to fight over control over territories 

previously occupied by the now weakened incumbent and have also led criminals to fight over 

alternative routes to transport drugs, leading to higher homicides rates where these fights 

occurred. 

The Soy Moratorium, however, is not a government policy, but an agreement between private 

companies. Although state policies can work, could a private initiative also curb deforestation? 

The literature on Fair Trade can help answering this question. Fair Trade certifications are made 

mostly by private association and NGOs and the Moratorium can be seen as a certification on 

an environmental standard. Nunn et al. (2014) provide an overview of studies on Fair Trade 

certifications and concludes that Fair Trade-certified producers do receive higher prices for 

roughly the same amount sold by similar non-certified producers and, although they understand 

that selection evidence is incomplete, they interpret previous results as indicative that the least 

able producers are the most likely to be certified and this imply correlational evidence may 

understate the effects of certification. I interpret this as evidence that consumers do change their 

choices in response to a mechanism to signal a socially responsible product. Nunn et al. (2014) 

also find that producers aiming for environmental certification adopt more environmental 

friendly practices and I interpret this as indicative the environmental certification acts on 

environmental practices the same way Fair Trade certification acts on other producer’s 

practices. Therefore, the fact that the Soy Moratorium is carried out and enforced by private 

companies is not a reason to believe it will not work. What raises concern, however, is that the 

companies enforcing the moratorium are the same potentially harmed by it, since it could result 

in a scarcer or more capital intensive input for them, both possibilities resulting in higher prices. 

Another reason the moratorium could fail is poor land tenure. If clearance can ensure tenure or 

if it can make physically defending the lands easier, farmers will have an incentive to clear and 

occupy forest areas. This is a serious problem in Brazil, where overlapping properties are 



13 
 

 

common: in some states, like Acre, officially registered rural properties sum up to more than 

200% of available lands. Also, if the lands overlap, accountability will be more difficult to 

apply: farmers could plant soybeans on deforested lands if they think the probability of the non-

compliant soy being attributed to them is low enough. Since the annual reports on the 

moratorium’s monitoring does not cite this difficulty, it may not be a real threat to the 

agreement, but these reports are on the monitoring only, never citing the enforcement of the 

agreement. For further reading, Chiavari and Lopes (2016) makes a report on the history and 

present state of Brazilian lands occupation and legislation. 

Therefore, there is enough evidence on the literature that the effect on deforestation of a market 

ban on soybeans is not obvious. In one hand, deforestation policies have been documented to 

work, the moratorium targets economically important and integrated areas, and the fact that it 

is a private agreement does not imply in its failure. On the other hand, the moratorium can be 

ineffective if producers can escape its monitoring by masking their soybeans, exploiting 

loopholes on the agreement, have stronger incentives to plant soy on deforested lands or even 

if the soy buyers do not have the incentive to enforce the moratorium. 

Although I do not know other works on the economics literature to assess the effect of a market 

ban on deforestation, I must acknowledge the work from Gibbs et al. (2015). This paper asks if 

the Soy Moratorium could reduce deforestation on the Amazon Biome but do not control 

adequately for possible confounders. They compare the deforestation evolution inside the 

Amazon Biome with the deforestation evolution in the entire Cerrado and the region known as 

MATOPIBA. Therefore, they are saying that Cerrado regions as far as in the São Paulo state 

are good controls for the Amazon, as well as the new soybean frontier, a region with a possibly 

very different dynamic from the Amazon itself. In particular, they do not control for the 

PPCDAm policies, since none of them are in force in most of the Cerrado, which means their 

result may be due to either the Soy Moratorium or any of the plan’s policies. In this regard, the 

authors argue that “[f]ederal enforcement mechanisms are unlikely to be an effective substitute 

for the [Soy Moratorium] in the near term, because there is no simple way to identify properties 

that are in compliance with the [Forest Code]”. However, even if compliance is not easily 

addressed, the Forest Code is but one of the measures taken to control illegal deforestation and 

Assunção, Gandour and Rocha (2015), as well as Burgess, Costa and Olken (2016), gives 

evidence that PPCDAm is working despite this difficulty. Also, even if the Soy Moratorium 

has a role in reducing deforestation, not all of it is caused by soy: cattle raising, illegal logging 



14 
 

 

and the appropriation of public-owned lands by private actors, a practice known as grilagem, 

are also important drivers and the PPCDAm acts upon all of them (Casa Civil (2004)). 

To disentangle the effects of the moratorium from those of PPCDAm, I use two levels of 

controls: the Cerrado portion of the Legal Amazon to control for the Amazon Biome and the 

soy producing counties to control for the non-producing ones within each biome. Since only 

the counties with at least 5000ha of soy planted are monitored by the Soy Moratorium, in this 

work I define as “soy producers” all counties with at least 5000ha of soy planted. By restricting 

the study area to the Legal Amazon, I eliminate all influence from factors other than the 

PPCDAm outside the Amazon Biome. Comparing this biome with the Cerrado, I control for 

the effects of the plan’s policies since all of them are in force within it but the moratorium is 

not. Since PPCDAm may have had differential effects on the Amazon Biome than on the 

Cerrado2, I compare deforestation outcomes between soy producers and non-soy producers 

within each biome to control for these differences. This way, I hope to select better comparison 

groups and estimate a cleaner effect than Gibbs et al. (2015).

3 BACKGROUND 

3.1 Deforestation in the Amazon  
 

 

From 1991 to 2004, deforestation in the Legal Amazon has grown in almost every year, going 

from 11,030 km² to 27,772 km² (MMA (2017)). By that time, some characteristics of the 

deforestation evolution were emphasized such as its geographic concentration and two of its 

economic drivers. It was identified that most of the deforestation was concentrated along an 

“Arc”, extending from the Acre’s southeast to the Maranhão’s southeast, passing through 

Rondônia, Amazonas’ south, Mato Grosso’s north and Pará’s south (Casa Civil (2004)). In the 

2000-2001 period, nearly 70% of the deforestation in the Legal Amazon occurred in Rondônia, 

Mato Grosso and Pará states. Also, cattle raising and soybean planting were identified as 

important deforestation drivers in the Legal Amazon (Casa Civil (2004)). While cattle raising 

was blamed for 80% all deforestation in the Legal Amazon, a 57% increase in planted area in 

1999-2001 period was seen as a threat to the forest. 

Then, in 2004, the Brazilian government launched the PPCDAm, a holistic plan to decrease the 

deforestation rates. It is an integrative plan in which thirteen Ministries coordinate under the 

Brazilian Chief of Staff, the Brazilian Executive Office’s highest-ranking member. It “sought 

to inhibit forest clearings and promote forest conservation by focusing on three main policy 

efforts: strengthening monitoring and law enforcement; expanding protected territory; and 

adopting a conditional rural credit policy” (Assunção et al. (2015)). 

The creation of DETER (Real Time Detection) system greatly improved the deforestation 

monitoring, since it allowed authorities to detect deforestation occurring in 15-day time 

windows. Previously, they were dependent of voluntary reports of threatened areas, making 

timely location and accessing to deforestation hotspots a difficult task (Assunção et al. (2013)). 

Besides, law has changed to make deforestation a crime punishable by imprisonment and to 

increase the required native vegetation inside every rural property from 35% to 80%. It became 

illegal, then, to deforest more than 20% a private property. Also, the demarcation of over 60 

million hectares of Protected Lands and Indigenous Lands, areas where any deforestation is 

either illegal or heavily restricted, further increased the size of the land unavailable for 

production. 

In 2008, two other major efforts were made: a conditional rural credit policy and the blacklisting 

of some counties for high priority action. Rural credit in Brazil is heavily subsidized and, for 



16 
 

 

all producers inside the Amazon Biome, it became conditional on them to meet certain 

environmental criteria. Also, counties with a recent history of very high deforestation rates were 

blacklisted to be assigned a stronger monitoring and to suffer sanctions. In 2008, 36 counties 

were blacklisted for high priority action, in 2009, seven were added and, in 2011, seven more. 

Although this blacklisting could affect any county inside the Legal Amazon, almost all of the 

blacklisted counties are inside the Amazon Biome. 

 

 

3.2 The Soy Moratorium 
 

 

As we can see in Table 1, soybean farming has been expanding into the Amazon at least since 

2001, with a major increase in 2005, nearly doubling the 2004 planted area. Deforestation as 

well (Figure 1), grew from 2001 to 2005, reaching a peak in 2004, and many blamed the soy 

expansion for this increase (Fearnside (2001), Casa Civil (2004), Watts (2005), Greenpeace 

(2006)). Then, in April 2006, Greenpeace organized protests at a Cargill’s soybean terminal in 

Santarém, Pará, and published the report “Eating up the Amazon”. Cargill is an important soy 

exporter in the Amazon and these actions helped raise international awareness over the claimed 

relation between deforestation and the soybean expansion into the Amazon Biome. In July of 

the same year, the two greatest Amazon’s soybean traders, the Brazilian Association of 

Vegetable Oil Industries (ABIOVE) and the National Association of Cereal Exporters (ANEC) 

(Gibbs et al. (2015)), signed an agreement in response to the reputational risk posed to the 

soybean industry by this increased attention. Under the Soy Moratorium, as it was named, these 

associations pledged to no longer buy soybeans produced in areas of the Amazon Biome 

deforested after July of 2006. It is important to note that, although the agreement officially cites 

the non-commercialization of soy coming from non-compliant areas3(ANEC website), the 

ADM’s website, one of ABIOVE’s associates, clearly states that companies do not 

commercialize soy from non-compliant producers, even if their non-compliant soy is only a 

small fraction of its total production4.

The table shows the evolution of non-compliance to the Soy Moratorium in monitored counties for all 
years in the sample. The moratorium was signed in 2006 but monitoring began only in 2007. In 2008 
Inpe became officially part and leader of the monitoring team. Soy data comes from Gibbs et al. (2015) 
while non-complying area and the number of monitored counties comes from the 2013/2014 harvest 
report. The non-complying percentage is the division of the non-complying area in each year by the 
planted soy area for that same year.

The traders wrote the agreement in cooperation with high profile environmental groups, such 

as Greenpeace and WWF-Brasil, forming the Soybean Working Group (GTS), responsible for 

overseeing its implementation and monitoring. The group was then divided into three 

subgroups: one responsible for farmer education and campaigning, one responsible for 

garnering greater support from businesses, NGOs and the federal government and one 

responsible for the monitoring itself. The first monitoring occurred for the 2007/2008 harvest 

and did not find any non-compliant soy on monitored lands. The company hired, Globalsat 

Monitoramento Agrícola, monitors PRODES polygons within counties which satisfies a few 

criteria, detailed below, and used a combination of aerial surveys and field visits to identify 

land use within each monitored polygon. The criteria used to select which polygons to monitor 

were the following: 

a) The polygon must be located within the Amazon Biome and in the states with significant 

soy acreage: Mato Grosso, Pará and Rondônia; 

b) It must be located outside of protected areas (Conservation Units and Indigenous 

Reserves); 

c) Be larger than 100ha; 

d) It must be in counties with at least 5,000ha of soy in 2006 and in the 2007/2008 crop 

estimate (prepared by ABIOVE); and 

e) The polygon must be wholly or partially contained within the Amazon Biome. 

These criteria remained roughly the same throughout the years: in 2009 criterion “c” changed 

the threshold to 25ha5; criterion “b” included rural settlements also in 2009, only to be dropped 

in 2013; criterion “d” changed in the following years to monitor all counties with at least 

5,000ha planted at the current monitoring year or estimated to cross this threshold on the 

following. Note that the monitoring area overlaps the deforestation “Arc”. 

The most important change in the monitoring process occurred in 2008, when the Brazilian 

Environment Ministry (MMA) officially joined the GTS, making the Space Research Institute 

(INPE) the leader of the efforts to monitor the soybean growth at the areas deforested after the 

cut-off date. Satellite image analysis, then, were used to guide aerial surveys and field visits 

and, eventually, substituted both as its reliability increased to the point of making them 

                                                             
5 From the 4th monitoring on, the criterion was to monitor aggregated polygons, instead of polygons, greater than 
25ha. Aggregated polygons are composed by smaller ones from previous years, e.g., if PRODES registered two 
separate 10ha polygons in previous years and, in the current year, another 10ha between those such that they are 
all adjacent, the three are aggregated to create a single 30ha polygon.

redundant. Since then, year by year, the monitoring has been accusing an increasing number of 

non-compliant soy areas, although it is very small even at its peak6. Part of this increase is due 

to the inclusion of counties in the monitoring group throughout the years. Table 1 also show 

this evolution. 

Originally, the moratorium was a two-year agreement, but it has been renewed annually since 

2008. As of May 9, 2016, the agreement was renewed indefinitely and this shows the 

importance given to the agreement by the government, the environmental groups and the 

soybean buyers and exporters. The confidence on its effectiveness comes mainly from the high 

compliance rate and the reports’ analyses showing a decrease in deforestation rates on the Legal 

Amazon and on monitored counties after 2008. However, I believe the analyses are flawed for 

not considering alternative causes, like PPCDAm policies, and for questionable treatment group 

definitions. 

 

 

4 DATA 
 

 

In this work, I use georeferenced data for deforestation and soy production from Hansen et al. 

(2013) and Gibbs et al. (2015) respectively. 

Hansen et al. (2013) make available georeferenced data for world’s annual tree cover loss. From 

2001 to 2013, it registers for each pixel the first year after 2000 that it lost canopy. Each pixel’s 

resolution is 1 arc-second, which is equivalent to 30m at the Equator, and “tree” is defined as 

all vegetation taller than 5m. I restrict attention to the area within the Legal Amazon, to both 

the Amazon and the Cerrado Biomes7. 

To track the soy farming across the Legal Amazon, I use georeferenced data for soy farming in 

the Amazon biome and crop farming in the Brazilian Cerrado, respectively, taken from Gibbs 

et al (2015). The soy data comes from the analysis of the biome portion of 88 counties with at 

least 1000ha in soy production, comprising the three states of Mato Grosso, Pará and Rondônia. 

                                                             
6 There was only one drop after the study period, however: in 2014 the cut-off date moved from July 2006 to 
July 2008, in accordance with the new Forest Code, and amnesty was given to all deforestation occurred up to 
the new date. 
7 Biomes’ and Legal Amazon treated georeferenced data comes from IBGE and as courtesy of CPI. 



20 
 

 

The GTS (Soy Working Group) monitors only those counties with over 5000ha in soy 

production, meaning this data can capture actions at unmonitored lands. Since 73 counties were 

monitored in the 2013/2014 harvest season, the data contains 15 counties more and provide 

almost 72.000km² of additional area, or 34% of monitored counties’ area. This data also ranges 

from 2001 to 2014. 

Gibbs et al (2015), used machine learning to identify crop farming for the entire Cerrado at 

250m resolution, beginning in 2001 and ending in 2013. The algorithm identified areas of at 

least 1km² of mechanized crop production. It is important to emphasize that I don’t have spatial 

data for soy production at this biome, only for crop farming, which can potentially include any 

crop planted in the region, such as cotton and rice. However, as the authors argue, the 

classification approach targeted the soy growing season and, as they write: 

In much of the soy-producing region of the Amazon and the Cerrado, two and sometimes three crops 
are planted per year, but in nearly all cases one of those crops is soy. Soy is by far the most reliably 
profitable crop produced at large scales; as such, most farmers produce only soybeans during the 
soybean “season” (roughly September to January, with some variation across the regions). 
Commercial silos are also unlikely to accept crops other than soy at the beginning of the year, further 
discouraging production of other crops. Cotton is the only other major crop planted at roughly the 
same time as soy in the Cerrado. However, cotton is typically planted 30-60 days after soybeans 
because of the different end dates of the obligatory “sanitary periods” for the two crops. In regions 
where only one crop per year is typical, soybean is part of most interannual rotational systems at the 
large scales our analysis targeted. 

Therefore, I also assume the most part of the crop raster data is comprised of soy and use the 

crop data as if it was equivalent to soy. 

 

 

4.1 Deforestation Measures 
 

 

Triple-differences estimates’ significance, as well as DD ones, depends on the functional form 

of the outcome variable. Hence, to better assess the effects of the Soy Moratorium, I use two 

deforestation measures: the deforestation rate and the normalized deforestation increment. 

The deforestation rate is defined as the lost fraction of previous year remaining forest. For 

instance, let ?????  be the annual deforestation increment and ????  the total forested area at 

county ? and year ?. The deforestation rate ????  is then defined as 

???? =
?????  

??????
 



21 
 

 

Note that since Hansen’s deforestation data marks a given pixel as either “not deforested since 

2000” or “deforested in ????”, where ???? ranges from 2001 to 2013, I can calculate the 

deforestation rate for all years in the sample. 

The normalized deforestation, in turn, is defined as the deviation from the time mean, in 

standard deviations, of the deforestation increment. Then, if ????????? and ??
???  are the average 

deforestation increment and the standard deviation of the deforestation increment of unit ? 

from 2001 to 2013, the normalized deforestation ????  is defined as 

???? =
????? ? ?????????

??
???  

 

Note that both measures account for variations in the deforestation increment due to different 

unit sizes. 

 

 

5 EMPIRICAL STRATEGY 
 

 

A simple before-after estimate would confound the effects of the Soy Moratorium with the 

effects of PPCDAm policies. Since the moratorium is valid only for the Amazon Biome, I use 

the Cerrado portion of the Legal Amazon as a control group to the Amazon Biome. To eliminate 

differences in deforestation changes due to differences between biomes, I compare, within each 

biome, soy producing counties and non-soy producing ones. Therefore, I make a triple-

difference (DDD) estimate by comparing the double-difference between soy producing and 

non-soy producing counties inside the Amazon Biome with the same double-difference inside 

the Cerrado. 

Soy producer and non-producer definitions are based on the monitoring criteria presented in 

section 3.2, which I modify to better suit my data. In particular, since I have only raster data 

there were no polygons for the deforestation at the Cerrado to classify as producer or non-

producer for all the studied years. Therefore, I define counties, not polygons, as being soy 

producers or non-soy producers and alter the criteria accordingly. For the Amazon Biome, I 

drop criterion “c”, since it only makes sense for polygons and substitute “county” for “polygon” 

in criteria “a” and “e”. I also drop criterion “b”, for my objective is to capture both direct and 



22 
 

 

indirect deforestation caused by the soy expansion. Criterion “d” is then modified to classify as 

soy producing those counties with at least 5,000ha of soy in 2006, when the agreement was 

signed. I adopt these same modified criteria to the Cerrado, except criterion “a”, which I drop 

completely. Then, the criteria for each biome becomes the following: 

1) Amazon Biome 

a) The county must be located within the Amazon Biome and in the states with significant 

soy acreage: Mato Grosso, Pará and Rondônia; 

b) The county must have at least 5000ha of soy in 2006; and 

c) The county must be wholly or partially contained within the Amazon Biome. 

2) Cerrado 

a) The county must have at least 5000ha of soy in 2006; and 

b) The county must be wholly or partially contained within the Cerrado. 

Note that since the Soy Moratorium affects only counties with at least 5000ha of soy, these are 

also the criteria used to assigned counties into treatment and control groups for each biome. 

Although the moratorium is only valid to the Amazon Biome, I assume counties which satisfy 

the criteria for the Cerrado would also be affected by the agreement if it was extended to this 

biome. Hence, in this work, “treated” and “untreated” are synonyms to “soy producer” and 

“non-soy producer” respectively. 

In total, there are 82 soy producing and 691 non-soy producing counties in all Legal Amazon. 

However, 96 of them lies simultaneously on both biomes. Hence, my observation unit is not 

the county, but the county portion contained in each biome. Therefore, a soy producing county 

lying in both biomes generate two observation units, one on the Amazon Biome and the other 

on the Cerrado, both counting as soy producing units. Table 2 shows the number of observation 

units for each biome, sample and category.  

  



23 
 

 

The table shows the number of soy producing and non-producing observation units in 
each sample. Each unit is one “county x biome” combination. Soy producer is defined 
as a county with at least 5000ha in soy planted, according to the criteria presented in 
section 5. The full sample includes all Amazon Biome counties. The 10km and 100km 
samples include all soy producers and all non-producers in a 10km and 100km buffer, 
respectively, from soy producers. Administrative and biome data comes from IBGE. 
Soy data comes from Gibbs et al. (2015). 

Sample Soy Producers Non-producers

Cerrado 65 258

Amazon (Full Sample) 38 508

Amazon (100km Sample) 38 179

Amazon (10km Sample) 38 76

Table 2: Observation units per biome, sample and 

category

 

 

 

 

 

 

From now on, I will simply use “county” as equivalent to the combination “county x biome”. 

For each county, I calculate the three measures defined in the Data section: the deforestation 

rate, deforestation increment’s natural logarithm and the normalized deforestation. The 

treatment group is defined as all the counties satisfying the eligibility criteria described in the 

Background section and the control group is comprised of all counties inside the Amazon 

Biome that do not satisfy them. To further control for differences between soy producing and 

non-soy producing counties, I use the Cerrado as a comparison group to the Amazon Biome, 

also applying the eligibility criteria for its counties. 

To study the effect of the Soy Moratorium, I use two different empirical specifications. Two 

differences-in-differences (DD), one for the Amazon Biome and other for the soy producing 

counties, are used to better understand the dynamics affecting the counties in each of these 

groups. My main specification is a triple-differences estimation with year and county fixed 

effects. Placebos to test the parallel trends assumption are presented at the end of this section. 

  



24 
 

 

5.1 Differences-in-differences equations 
 

 

To better capture the dynamics of deforestation in the Legal Amazon concerning the differences 

between the soy producing counties and the biomes, the first two estimating equations are the 

following DD 

??? = ?? + ?? + ???{? ? ????}?{? ? ????????} +  ???  

 

and 

??? = ?? + ?? + ???{? ? ????}?{? ? ??????} +  ???  

where ???  is the deforestation measure at county ? and year ?, ??  and ?? are the county and 

year fixed effects, ?{? ? ??????} and ?{? ? ????????} indicates if county ? is inside the Amazon 

Biome and if it is a soy producer, ?{? ? ????} indicates the period after the moratorium was signed 

and ???  is the error. The coefficient of interest in both equations is ?? as it captures any change 

in mean ???  after 2006 for each of those groups. 

With equation (1) I try to capture differential effects on soy producing counties relative to non-

producing, such as those of rural credit conditioning for producers inside the Amazon Biome. 

Assunção et al. (2013), finds the credit conditioning affected differently cattle producers credit 

concession and crop producers’. 

Similarly, equation (2) tries to capture differential effects on Amazon counties relative to 

Cerrado ones. The said conditioning is one example but as well as the blacklisting of Legal 

Amazon counties with high deforestation rates. Assunção et al. (2014) shows the priority action 

has reduced the deforestation in the Legal Amazon from 2008 to 2011 by 35%. Assunção et al. 

(2013) also shows that the credit conditioning curbed deforestation in the Amazon Biome. Note 

this is a slight modification to the strategy used by Gibbs et al. (2015): while it compares the 

Amazon Biome with the entire Cerrado, I compare the former only with the Cerrado portion of 

the Legal Amazon. 

Note that neither (1) nor (2) tries to capture causal effects but, if the Soy Moratorium had any 

effect on deforestation, both estimations may give significant estimates for ??. 

  

(1) 

(2) 



25 
 

 

5.2 Triple-differences 
 

 

Using the same definitions as before, my main estimation equation is 

??? = ?? + ?? + ???{? ? ????}?{? ? ??????} + ???{? ? ????}?{? ? ????????} +

???{? ? ????}?{? ? ??????}?{? ? ????????} + ??? 

  

The coefficient of interest is ?? as it captures the change in the mean deforestation, measured 

by ???, in soy producing counties and inside the Amazon Biome after the Soy Moratorium 

began. The identifying assumption needed for ?? to be the causal effect of the Soy Moratorium 

on deforestation is that, on the absence of the agreement, the difference in the deforestation 

measure between soy producing and non-soy producing counties inside the Amazon Biome 

would have followed the same trend as the difference in the deforestation measure between soy 

producing and non-soy producing counties on the Cerrado portion of the Legal Amazon.  

The coefficient ?? nets out any difference in the mean ??? , starting in 2006, due to any change 

other than the Soy Moratorium occurring inside the Amazon Biome. The coefficient ??, on its 

turn, nets out any difference in the mean ??? , starting in 2006, due to changes other than the 

moratorium affecting soy producing counties. If any of the previous DD estimations finds a 

significant effect I expect the coefficients for the Amazon Biome and for soy producing counties 

to lose at least part of their significance if the moratorium was indeed effective. 

Note, however, as we can see in Figure 2, soy farming is concentrated close to the border 

between biomes. Therefore, lands too far away from it may not be good controls for soy 

producing counties. I account for this estimating the triple-differences, as well as both double-

differences, for three different samples inside the Amazon Biome: the Full Sample, the 100km 

Sample and the 10km Sample. The Full Sample includes all counties within the biome. The 

100km sample include all soy producing counties and all non-soy producing that intersect a 

100km buffer around the soy producing ones. The 10km Sample include all soy producing 

counties and all non-soy producing that intersect a 10km buffer around the soy producing ones. 

The Cerrado sample was kept intact and was used alongside each of those samples.

Figure 2 - Soy planted area at each biome in 2006 

 

 

  

The figure shows how the soy production was distributed at the Cerrado portion of the Legal Amazon (within 
the red border), and the Amazon Biome in 2006. Soy data for the Legal Amazon comes from two datasets: one 
contains soy data for the Amazon Biome and the other contains crop data for the Cerrado. The crop data may 
show not only soy, but also cotton and rice. However, since it was collected in the soy growing season and it 
is unlikely that any other crop is extensively produced at the same time, I use crop as if it were composed only 
by soy. Administrative data comes from IBGE and soy and crop data comes from Gibbs et al. (2015). 



27 
 

 

5.3 Testing pre-trend assumptions 
 

 

Before turning to the results, it is useful to see how the specifications fare in tests for the pre-

trend equality in all the three specifications, for both measures and for the main sample, the 

10km sample. The tests for the other samples are in the Appendix (Tables A1 and A2). 

In this test, I use equations (1), (2) and (3) with data ranging from 2001 to 2005 to detect 

possible differences in trends before the Soy Moratorium came into effect. The cutoff year is 

2004 and I test the null hypothesis that trends before 2006 are equal for the treatment and control 

groups. For specifications (1) and (2), the double differences for soy producers and the Amazon 

Biome respectively, this means that ?? should be equal zero and for specification (3), the triple 

differences, ?? should be equal zero. Note that while these tests check for differences in 

deforestation trends in the first two specifications, in specification (3) it checks for different 

trends in the deforestation difference between soy producer counties and non-producers. For 

instance, rejecting the null hypothesis in the triple differences is to say the deforestation 

difference between soy producer counties and non-producers inside the Amazon biome follows 

a different path than the deforestation difference between soy producers and non-producers at 

the Cerrado portion of the Legal Amazon. 

As we can see in Table 3 the tests reject the equal trends hypothesis for specification (1) with 

both measures but do not reject for specifications (2) and (3). This means deforestation in soy 

producing counties were already following a different path than non-producers at the Legal 

Amazon even prior to the Soy Moratorium but deforestation in Amazonian counties had the 

same trend than in those within the Cerrado. Note that even with parallel trends, the double 

difference for the biomes still cannot yield a causal effect for the moratorium, since it does not 

separate its effects from the PPCDAm. Also, the tests find no evidence of differential trends in 

the deforestation differences between soy producers and non-producers at the Amazon biome 

and between producers and non-producers at the Cerrado. Therefore, there are evidence that, in 

this sample, the counties at the Cerrado portion of the Legal Amazon form a good control group 

for the soy producer counties within the Amazon biome and their neighbors.

This table shows the results of the common pre-trend tests for the 10km sample. The data ranges from 
2001 to 2005 and “post” means that year is greater than or equal 2004. The observation unit is the 
combination county x biome and there are 405 of them for all estimations. The specifications are two DD 
and one DDD. The two DD compare the Amazon and the Cerrado biomes and soy producing observation 
units with non-producers respectively. The DDD use the comparison between producing and non-
producing units within the Cerrado as a control to the comparison between producers and non-producers 
within the Amazon Biome. For each specification and measure, I test the null hypothesis that trends before 
2006 are equal and fixed effects are used for year and the “county x biome” combination. Errors are 
clustered by “county x biome” and are shown in parenthesis. Significant estimates indicate pre-trends are 
not equal. Significance levels are (***) 0.01 (**) 0.05 (*) 0.1.

6 RESULTS 
 

 

Here I present the estimates for specifications (1), (2) and (3) for the 10km sample. Results for 

the 100km and the full samples are presented in the Appendix (Tables A3 and A4, respectively). 

As we can see in Table 4 the estimations for the deforestation rate gives negative and significant 

results for both differences-in-differences estimates of ???????? × ???????? and 

???????? × ????????????. This is consistent with the belief the moratorium would have 

the effect to slowdown deforestation in the affected units. However, when we turn to the DDD 

estimates, we see that the coefficient for the agreement is not significant and the other two 

coefficients keep their direction and significance. Since the pre-trends test for this estimation 

did not reject the equal trends hypothesis, I interpret this as evidence the Soy Moratorium had 

no effect to slowdown the deforestation rate and, instead, that something else had a differential 

impact on counties inside the Amazon Biome and on soy producing counties in both biomes. 

This can also be seen on Table 5, which shows the non-parametric estimates for the Soy 

Moratorium: from 2001 to 2012, almost all coefficients, before and after 2006, are zero. 

The results for the normalized deforestation follow a similar pattern, with the coefficients for 

???????? × ??o????? and ???????? × ??????????o? negative and significant for the 

three specifications. The difference, however, is that the coefficient for the moratorium is 

positive and significant. Since the pre-trend test did not reject the equal trends hypothesis for 

this estimation, I interpret this as indicative that the Soy Moratorium has caused an increase in 

deforestation. This can be seen in Table 5, where the coefficient’s mean from 2001 to 2005 is  

-1.5 and, from 2006 to 2012, close to -0.85. 

Although these two results, the zero and the positive effects, are contradictory, both agree with 

the idea that the Soy Moratorium has not helped to reduce deforestation in the Amazon Biome.

As argued before, the Soy Moratorium could fail to reduce deforestation for two reasons: low 

enforcement and the possibility for the producer to avoid its sanctions. 

Table 1 shows that compliance to the agreement has been extremely high throughout the years, 

that is to say that only a small fraction of the soy planted in each year were raised in lands 

deforested after July 2006. But the idea criticized by the present work to the previous 

evaluations is that compliance is not enough evidence to support the claim that the Soy 

Moratorium has curbed deforestation at the studied period. If any other policy to reduce 

deforestation, namely those under the PPCDAm, were effective by the time of the moratorium, 

then compliance could have happened anyway and, as stated before, Assunção et al. (2014), 

Assunção et al. (2015) and Burgess et al. (2016) presents evidence they did work. 

It is important to note, also, that previous evaluations looked only at direct deforestation. 

Therefore, even if the Soy Moratorium had inhibited soybeans into native forests, it may have 

caused indirect deforestation elsewhere. Let’s say there is a producer owning three plots of land: 

one with soy, one with cattle and one with a native forest that could be legally deforested. Under 

the agreement, the producer can be punished if they plant soy into the forest plot, but he could, 

instead, burn down the area, transfer the cattle raising to it and then plant soy into the now 

vacant plot without any punishment, as depicted in Figure 3. Indeed, Rudorff et al. (2011) and 

Brown and Koeppe (2013) points that soy is often not the first crop to be planted in recently 

deforested areas: rice is an alternative, usually to prepare the land to receive soybeans, as well 

as raising cattle if crop prices are too low (Rudorff et al. (2011)). Hence, it is possible that the 

soybean is displacing less lucrative products as a response to the moratorium.

Under the Soy Moratorium, the owner of three plots of lands as depicted at 
the top, in which the forest plot could be legally deforested under the 
Brazilian law, could increase its soy production by deforesting the forest plot, 
transferring the cattle to the now vacant area and then planting soy where the 
cattle was. All of it suffering none of the moratorium’s sanctions.

8 CONCLUSION 
 

 

Many have pointed to the soybean expansion into the Amazon Biome as an important driver of 

its deforestation and to fight it, Greenpeace has pressed the soy industry to halt the production 

inside the biome. In response to the reputational threat, two of the biggest soy buyers’ 

associations has signed the Soy Moratorium. Seen as a successful program, it has been renewed 

annually despite the lack of effective evaluation. 

In this work, I estimate double-differences and triple-differences regressions comparing the 

Amazon Biome to the Cerrado and soy producing counties with non-soy producing to study if 

a market ban on soybeans, and market bans in general, can help reduce deforestation. My results 

suggest the moratorium had no effect to curb deforestation.  

Although only a first approach, this work may be seen as another evidence that a market ban 

may not work if there are forms of escaping its sanctions. Future research may look for another 

strategy such as changing the comparison groups, fining the observation unit from counties to 

pixels and even change the estimating equations. All to avoid possible confounders that were 

not eliminated by the chosen strategy.

This table shows the results of the common pre-trend tests for the 100km sample. The data ranges from 
2001 to 2005 and “post” means that year is greater than or equal 2004. The observation unit is the 
combination county x biome and there are 491 of them for all estimations. The specifications are two DD 
and one DDD. The two DD compare the Amazon and the Cerrado biomes and soy producing units with 
non-producers respectively. The DDD use the comparison between producers and non-producers within 
the Cerrado as a control to the comparison between producers and non-producers within the Amazon 
Biome. For each specification and measure, I test the null hypothesis that trends before 2006 are equal 
and fixed effects are used for year and observation unit. Errors are clustered by “county x biome” and are 
shown in parenthesis. Significant estimates indicate pre-trends are not equal. Significance levels are (***)
