ABSTRACT 

 

DAMASCENO, Flávio Alves, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, August, 2012. 
Compost bedded pack barns system and computational simulation of airflow through 
naturally ventilated reduced model. Advisor: Fernando da Costa Baêta. Co-advisers: Ilda 
de Fátima Ferreira Tinôco and Luiz Fernando Teixeira Albino. 
 

Compost bedded pack (CBP) barns have been receiving increased attention as an 

alternative housing system for dairy cattle due they consist of a roofed open loose resting 

area that is bedded with sawdust  where compost is actively stirred to aerate in order to 

maintain an active composting process. Thus systematic investigation of the main 

management practices of dairy operations utilizing green or kiln dried sawdust in compost 

CBP barns at Kentucky state (USA) has proven to be of environmental and economic 

relevance. The present work has as main objectives: a) Summarization of compost bed 

data, barn dimension data and determination of the major interactive factors in the success 

of bed composting from qualitative and quantitative methods; b) Summarization of 

moisture contents and water holding capacities of the compost bed to determine the 

influence of moisture on successful compost bed operation; c) Development of predictive 

equations for thermal properties of compost as a function of various combinations of 

moisture content, compaction, and particle size; and d) Development of a three-

dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model of compost barn with alternate 

ridge designs and visual demonstration of its impact on air flow through structure. Data for 

this study was collected from 42 CBP barns, distributed throughout the state of Kentucky 

(USA) between October 2010 to March 2011. These data were used to describe the 

building layouts and dimensions, identify barn management practices, and characterize the 

compost bedding material concerning moisture content, WHC, particle size, thermal 

properties, and others parameters. The average herd size found in the study was 90 cows 

and the breeds consisted of Jersey (6.8%), Holstein (72.7%), and mix (20.5%).The average 

CBP barn dimensions were 49.1 m (length) and 21.9 m (width). Majority of these barns 

had feed alleys and driveways; overshot ridge with frequent orientation from NE to SW; 

green sawdust, kiln-dried sawdust, and mixture of both as most common bedding material; 

bedding process and aeration using mechanical tillage at depths lower than 0.25 m; and 

loading of fresh material added every one to five weeks, varying by season, weather 

conditions, barn size, and cow density. Temperatures of bedding compost tended to be 



ix 
 

lower on barns which utilized green sawdust. Average bedding moisture content was found 

to be 59.0% (w.b.) and ranged from 36.2 to 71.8%.  The percentage distributions of mass 

weight in the particle size fractions from the bedding compost materials were very different 

when compared among them. The average finer index (p &amp;lt;0.05) was the highest weight 

percent (30.1%) in the samples studied. WHC increased with increasingly fine particle size. 

The higher bulk density value was 3.6 times that of the lowest bulk density value. In 

general, the thermal conductivity increased with increasing particle size, while thermal 

resistivity decreased with increasing particle size. An increasing trend in the thermal 

conductivity was also observed with the increase in both moisture content and static and 

dynamic compaction degree for all compost material tested. Whereas, an increasing trend 

in the thermal resistivity of bed compost was observed with the decrease in both moisture 

content and static and dynamic compaction degree. Bedding compost always contained 

bacteria, moreover Coliforms count was not present in barns that had a higher compost 

temperature and Coliforms, E. coli, Bacillus and Streptococcus count were higher in the 

barns that showed lower moisture content. The developed barn ventilation CFD model 

provided good agreement with experimental measurements and it was able to identify the 

effect on air flow through structure in a CBP barns with  alternative roof ridge type. The 

CFD models results showed that the best  ridge vent and wind direction in the winter 

weather was observed in the open ridge with chimney (ORC) and West to East, 

respectively.

RESUMO 

 

DAMASCENO, Flávio Alves, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Agosto, 2012. 
Galpões com sistema de cama com compostagem e simulação computacional do fluxo 
do ar através de modelo reduzido naturalmente ventilado. Orientador: Fernando da 
Costa Baêta. Coorientadores: Ilda de Fátima Ferreira Tinôco e Luiz Fernando Teixeira 
Albino. 
 

Galpões com sistema cama em compostagem (CBP) têm recebido maior atenção como um 

sistema de criação alternativo para gado leiteiro por ser constituído de uma área de 

descanso aberta e coberta utilizada como cama serragem onde o composto é ativado e 

aerado por agitação a fim de manter um processo de compostagem ativo. Sendo assim, a 

investigação sistemática das principais práticas de manejo das operações de produção de 

leite empregando-se serragem verde ou seca nos compostos de instalações do tipo CBP no 

estado de Kentucky (USA) tem demonstrado ser de grande interesse econômico e 

ambiental. O presente trabalho teve como objetivos principais: a) Sumarizar os dados do 

composto da cama, dimensão das instalações e determinar os principais fatores interativos 

para o sucesso do composto da cama a partir de métodos qualitativos e quantitativos; b) 

Sumarizar a capacidade de retenção de água do composto da cama (WHC) e comparar dos 

teores de umidade encontrados com a WHC, a fim de determinar a influência da umidade 

sobre o composto da cama; c) Desenvolvimento de equações de previsão para propriedades 

térmicas em composto de cama em função de varias combinações de teor de umidade, 

compactação e tamanho de partícula; e d) Desenvolvimento de um modelo em três 

dimensões em dinâmica de fluídos computacional (CFD) de instalações em compostagem 

com projetos alternativos de cumeeira e demonstração visual do impacto do fluxo do ar 

sobre a estrutura. Dados para realização deste estudo foram coletados em 42 instalações 

CBP, distribuídos através do estado de Kentucky, entre outubro de 2010 e março de 2011. 

Estas informações foram usadas para descrever o esboço e as dimensões das instalações, 

identificar as práticas de manejo e caracterizar o material de compostagem da cama quanto 

ao teor de umidade, capacidade de retenção de água (WHC), tamanho da partícula, 

propriedades térmicas, entre outros parâmetros. A média de tamanho do rebanho 

encontrado nesse estudo foi de 90 vacas com proporção de 6,8% de Jersey, 72,7% de 

Holstein e 20,5% de mistura destas raças. A média das dimensões das camas de 

compostagem foram 49,1 m (comprimento) e 21,9 m (largura). A maioria destas 



xi 
 

instalações tinham corredores de alimentação e acesso de veículos, cumeeiras do tipo 

“overshot” (com um dos lados ultrapassado) e  frequência de orientação de NE para SO, 

serragem verde, seca ou mista como materiais mais comuns da cama, preparo da cama por 

aeração mecânica a profundidade menores do que 0,25 m e carga de material fresco 

adicionado a cada uma ou cinco semanas, variando por estação do ano, condições 

climática, tamanho da instalação e densidade animal. As temperaturas dos compostos das 

camas tenderam ser menores em instalações que utilizaram serragem verde. A umidade 

média do material da cama foi de 59,0% (b.u.), variando de 36,3% a 71,8%. A comparação 

da distribuição percentual do peso (massa) nas fracões de tamanho de partícula revelou que 

esses materiais de compostagem da cama encontrados nas instalações CBP foi muito 

diferentes. Assim, a média do índice de finura (p &amp;lt;0.05) foi a porcentagem de peso mais 

alta (30.1%) nas amostras estudadas. WHC aumentou com o aumento de partículas finas. O 

maior valor de densidade aparente da cama foi 3,6 vezes maior que o menor valor de 

densidade aparente encontrado. Em geral, a condutividade térmica aumentou com aumento 

do tamanho da partícula, enquanto a resistividade térmica diminuiu com o aumento do 

tamanho da partícula. Uma tendência de aumento na condutividade térmica foi ainda 

observada com o aumento no conteúdo de umidade e grau de compactação estática e 

dinâmica para todos os materiais de compostos testados. Por outro lado, uma tendência de 

aumento na resistividade térmica do composto da cama foi observada com a diminuição do 

conteúdo de umidade e do grau de compactação estática e dinâmica. Os materiais da cama 

sempre mostraram presença de bactérias, sendo que as contagens de Coliformes não 

estavam presentes em instalações que possuíam compostos com temperaturas mais 

elevadas e as contagens Coliformes, E. coli, Bacilo e Estreptococos foram maiores nas 

instalações que apresentaram menores teores de umidade. O desenvolvimento do modelo 

em CFD permitiu uma boa concordância com medições experimentais e foi capaz de 

identificar os efeitos do fluxo de ar através da estrutura em instalações CBP com diferentes 

tipos de cumeeiras. Os resultados dos modelos CFD mostraram que a melhor tipo de 

telhado e direção do vento no durante o periodo de inverno foi observado em cumeeira 

aberta com chaminé (ORC) e oeste para leste, respectivamente.

1 - INTRODUCTION 

 

1.1 Summary and justification 

In the late 1980`s, innovative dairy producers in the state of Virginia introduced a new 

variation on the loose-housing dairy system generally referred to as a compost bedded pack 

(CBP) barn. Since then, CBP barns are being used in many states in the United States, 

especially in the Midwest and Northeast, and in other countries such as Japan, China, 

Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Israel, and recently in Brazil. The first CBP barns of 

Kentucky were constructed in 2002. By the end of 2010, CBP barn number had been 

increased to 58 barns. This significant increase was an indicative that a CBP barn may be a 

reasonable, economically feasible alternative type of dairy housing facility for Kentucky 

dairy producers wanting to upgrade or modernize their milking herd facilities. As 

consequence, factors based on dairy producer experiences such as current design, 

management recommendations of manure compost packs, animal behavior, herd health, 

and milk production has been described in some publications (Russelle et al., 2009). 

Additional field observations have also been reported in several U.S. states (Shane et al., 

2010; Barberg et al., 2007; Janni et al., 2007) and specially in Kentucky (Black et al., 

2011a; Black et al., 2011b; Bewley and Taraba, 2009).  

 CBP barn structures generally have a retaining wall that typically surrounds the bed 

and also separates the feed alley from the composted manure pack. The most commonly 

employed bedding material in the composting process is green and dry sawdust or kiln 

dried shavings to maintain a dry bedding surface and to absorb water. However, producers 

often ask whether green sawdust (high moisture sawdust from sawing green wood) is 

harmful or beneficial to the composting bed. The primary difference between green and 

kiln dried sawdust is that green sawdust will not absorb as much water as kiln-dried 

sawdust. All that this implies is that to achieve the same compost bed moisture content, 

more green sawdust will be used than kiln dried sawdust.  

Compost packs produced by composting are tilled or stirred twice daily to incorporate 

the manure, provide a fresh, soft surface, and aerate the pack to encourage aerobic 

microbial activity in the pack (Janni et al., 2007). Compared to windrow composting, CBP 

has a larger surface area to heat generating volume, thus more heat losses. Since the 

temperature is one of the most important CBP operational parameters, the understanding of 



2 
 

the thermal properties and heat balance in compost systems is required to design and 

properly control the composting processes (Ahn et al., 2009; Janni et al., 2007). 

Additionally, the key to maintaining a good working CBP barn include, a structure 

designed with an open ridge and high open side walls, enhanced ventilation, frequent bed 

stirring, optimal moisture in the bedded pack, appropriate biodegradability of the 

bedding/manure bed mixture, and optimal animal density.  

 Therefore, the effectiveness of the composting process is dependent upon the 

environmental conditions as oxygen content, moisture, temperature, amount of organic 

matter, and the size and activity of microbial populations presents within the CBP (Janni et 

al., 2005). Composting increases the bedding temperature which reduces pathogenic 

microbial populations, and decreases bedding moisture by increased drying rate (Black et 

al., 2011a; Barberg at al., 2007). The large numbers of microorganisms and high microbial 

activity in the compost bedding are largely a reflection of manure deposition, bedding 

chemical properties (available C and N), and water contents. Facultative anaerobic bacteria 

also are more numerous in the surface of CBP material and constitute a larger proportion of 

the total microbial population in tilled or stirred compost (NRCS, 2010). Some research 

shows the direct influence of poor environment conditions that could be created within the 

CBP as one of the factors that predispose the development of respiratory diseases in birds 

and pigs (Reece et al., 1980; Sainsbury, 1981; Takai et al., 1983; Menegali et al., 2009), but 

a thorough search of the literature found few studies related to air quality in facilities for 

cattle. 

 A more in-depth study is needed to assess and correlate detailed information regarding 

the building structure, bed management, and compost parameters of these housing systems 

and to determine the most significant factors that achieve CBP success. Thus, the findings 

of this research may be used by current and future compost bedded pack barn managers.

1.2 Dissertation objectives 

The present work will provide a systematic investigation of the main management 

practices of dairy operations utilizing green or kiln dried sawdust in their compost bedded 

pack barns. Four major objectives were established: 

 

1) Summarization of compost bed data, barn dimension data and determination of the 

major interactive factors in the success of bed composting from qualitative and quantitative 

methods; 

 

2) Summarization of moisture contents and water holding capacities of the compost bed 

to determine the influence of moisture on successful compost bed operation; 

 

3) Development of predictive equations for thermal properties of compost as a function 

of various combinations of moisture content, compaction, and particle size; 

 

4) Development of a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model of 

compost barn with alternate ridge designs and visual demonstration of its impact on air 

flow through structure.

2 - LITERATURE REVIEW 

 

2.1. Compost dairy barn system 

For the past several decades, loose housing systems of dairy cattle has given way to 

freestall barns in light of less labor, cleaner cows and reduced bedding costs when 

compared to the conventional straw bedded-pack. Nevertheless, loose housing with 

freestalls can still lead to a high risk of lameness and hock lesion. Since the concrete 

flooring systems are constantly covered with urine and manure, this type system may cause 

digital dermatitis and other hoof disorders (Klaas et al., 2010), especially with inadequate 

positioning of stall hardware, limited area resting space, hard lying surface or insufficient 

bedding (Weary and Taszkun, 2000; Tucker et al., 2004; Dippel et al., 2009). In view of 

this, a new concept in loose housing called compost bedded dairy barn system, commonly 

called compost barns or compost bedded pack barns (CBP), has been gaining attention 

from dairy producers and the scientific community. 

CBP barns are an alternative loose housing system for dairy cows. In CBP barns, cows 

have more freedom of movement and are able to lie down in a more natural manner. In 

theory, this should lead to cows spending more time lying down. However, even as cows 

are standing up, they also spend more time on a softer surface than in concrete alleys 

within freestall barns. Thus, cow welfare and health are important indications of the 

compost bed. Bedding quality can also be decreased as the moisture content increase once 

the cows are directly exposed to the elements constituting of bedding, feces and urine 

resulting in an increase in the bacterial cells counts of both bedding and teats (Zdanowicz 

et al., 2004). But, when CBP barns are properly managed, drier bedding material is present 

and may result in decrease of the milk somatic cell counts (SCC), cleaner cows, increased 

milk production, and reduced lameness. A published example of this was found in 

Minnesota where the percentage of mastitis infection rates in CBP barns was 12% lower 

than in freestall herds (Barberg et al., 2007). 

CBP barns are generating a lot of interest among Kentucky dairy producers who are 

adopting CBP barns as dairy cattle housing at a rapid rate. Kentucky has at least fifty one 

compost barns in operation and some more under construction. Experience with well-

managed CBP barns in Kentucky has generally been positive. Cows are relatively clean, 

very comfortable, have fewer lameness issues, and in most cases has increased milk 



5 
 

production and lower SCC after moving from tie-stall or freestall barns, or pasture based 

systems to a compost barn. 

However, since this is a new system, many questions still remain regarding best 

management practices and key factors for their success. More research is needed on these 

housing systems after assessing the effect of current design and management 

recommendations based on dairy producer experiences. As result, CBP barn 

recommendations can be made for proper design, location, and exceptional management. 

Thus, the keys to maintaining a good working CBP barn should include a structure 

designed with an open ridge and high open side walls, enhanced ventilation, frequent bed 

stirring, optimal moisture in the bedded pack, and optimal animal density (Wagner, 2002) 

in order to provide a healthy, comfortable surface on which cows may be kept to result in 

with a higher quality of life and milk production. 

 

2.1.1. Facility design 

CBP barns are similar in many respects to typical freestall dairy barns (NRAES-76, 

1995; MWPS-7, 2000). Both have feed mangers, feed alleys and waterers. One of the key 

differences is that the freestall and freestall alleys are replaced with a bedded pack area in 

CBP barns which it is aerated at least twice daily.  

CBP barns have a concrete feed alley, a composting bedded pack, a 1.20 m high wall 

surrounds the pack on three sides and one side that separates the pack from the  feed alley. 

The 1.20 m wall the bedded pack and the feed alley has a fence for safety to prevent cows 

from walking over the wall (Endres and Janni, 2009). The wall separating the pack and the 

feed alley has one to four walkways for cows and equipment to access the pack. This wall 

is typically of poured concrete construction. 

A feed alley is located along one long side of the bedded pack. CBP barns can be laid 

out for drive-by feeding, covered feeding, or drive-through feeding with pens on both sides. 

They can also be used with outside feed bunks under roof. The recommended feed alley 

width is 4.25 m because cows eat off one side of the alley and drink from waterers on the 

other side (Gay, 2009). 

The bedded pack area can have a concrete or clay base. The sidewall height for a 

bedded pack is recommended to be higher than that for a freestall barn to accommodate the 

sidewall opening lost due to the manure pack walls. A size 0.91 m or more of eave 



6 
 

overhangs is recommended to minimize the chance of roof runoff and rain being blown 

onto the bedded pack (Janni et al., 2005). Roof gutters will help reduce roof runoff from 

being blown onto the pack. The ground surrounding a compost barn should be sloped to 

minimize rain and snow runoff from entering the barn and wetting the bedded pack (Endres 

and Janni, 2009). Dairy producers in Minnesota have used 4.25 m sidewalls but some 

producers have used 4.90 m for their next barn to provide better access for bedding trucks. 

Walkways, at least 3.05 m to 3.65 m wide, are minimum recommended at each end of the 

wall separating the bedded pack and the feed alley for cow and equipment access to the 

pack area. Long barns will require additional walkways (Endres and Janni, 2009). 

 

2.1.2. Waterers 

Water intake increases during heat stress, and one of the critical factors in managing 

heat stress is to provide adequate access to water. Economy and ruggedness are two criteria 

for selection of  the waterers. Two choices for materials are concrete or plastic. Concrete is 

more rugged for the long term but requires more skill and equipment for forming and 

placing. Plastic can be easy to modify or repaired and economically viable. 

Waterers located closer to the feed alley are easier to inspect from the alley and 

cleaning can be performed more easily. Many CBP barns have the waterers along the 

retaining wall with access from, the feed alley, usually within an indented space . Waterers 

are not located in the bedded pack area to minimize wetting of the pack, to keep cleaner 

waterers, and to avoid having to adjust waterer height as pack depth increases. Ideally, 0.60 

meters of tank perimeter should be provided for each 10 to 20 cows (Brouk et al., 2001). 

 

2.1.3. Lighting 

Lighting in compost barns is similar to that used in freestall barns (MWPS-7, 2000). 

Lighting in CBP barns is desired mainly for the convenience of the operator, for inspecting 

animals and handling dairy cows. Dairy producers, veterinarians, and other animal care 

workers often report easier and better cow observation and care. Cows move more easily 

through uniformly lit entrances and exits.  

Enhanced lighting for the milking herd is profitable (Dahl et al., 1997). The increased 

milk production generates a payback of less than one year considering initial, installation, 



7 
 

operating, and replacement costs of the lights, and the increased feed intake (Chastain and 

Hiatt, 1998). 

Light levels are measured in lux. The power and type of the lamp determines the 

brightness. The height of the lamp above the ground and the lamp spacing determines the 

uniformity and distribution of light (Winchell et al., 1996). Yard lights should therefore be 

located over feed alleys and/or waterers. 

 

2.1.4. CBP barn ventilation and location 

Determining the best CBP barn ventilation system to employ is one of the biggest 

facility related decisions to make it. The ventilation in the CBP barns helps in maintaining 

a healthy and comfortable environment for cows and reduces the effect of environment on 

the structure of the building. The renewal of the air removes cow heat and moisture as well 

as the odor, gases, heat and moisture that the composting pack generates. It is necessary to 

constantly exchange warm, humid air inside the barn for cooler, drier air outside of the 

barn. This exchange must occur regardless of outside temperature or weather conditions. 

A continuous supply of fresh air is necessary whenever animals are closely confined, as 

in CBP barn, in order to maintain animal health and integrity of the building. Evidence of 

inadequate ventilation includes condensation or condensation stains on walls, ceilings and 

structural members, and mainly the presence of foul odors in the barn. Perennial respiratory 

diseases may be another symptom of poor ventilation. Winter barn temperatures should not 

exceed 10°C. If this temperature is often exceeded, inadequate ventilation may be the 

reason (Wells, 2004). 

The rate of ventilation is the air volume changed in a given period of time. The 

ventilation system in dairy barns may be natural or mechanical ventilation (positive or 

negative), or a combination of both (Teye and Hautala, 2008), as seen in Figure 2.1. 

A mechanical ventilating system uses fans to provide air exchange. Both naturally and 

mechanically ventilated buildings need properly sized openings for fresh air to enter and 

exhaust air to exit. Ventilating system control can be accomplished either automatically or 

manually. Mechanical ventilating systems almost always use thermostatic control while 

natural ventilating systems are commonly adjusted manually (MWPS-7, 2000).

2.1.4.1. Natural ventilation in CBP barns 

In a natural ventilating system, the wind and the difference between inside and outside 

temperature moves air through the building. Natural air exchange or building ventilation 

rates are influenced sidewall opening, eave opening, building width, ridge opening, and 

wind speed (Brouk et al., 2001). 

Wind blowing across the open ridge and sidewall and endwall openings, and 

indoor/outdoor temperature differences moves air through the building to provide the air 

exchange. Fresh air enters through eave or sidewall openings, see Figure 2.1c. 

Heat, moisture, and air contaminants exits through the open ridge and downwind 

sidewall opening. Some ventilation occurs even on calm days because warm, moist air rise 

up causing a chimney effect. Large, adjustable or full sidewall openings allow increased air 

movement due to wind in summer. Continuous openings help provide good fresh air 

distribution. 

 
a) Location and Sitting 

The most CBP barns are naturally ventilated, which makes location very important. 

Naturally ventilated barns are located in an open area where summer winds can blow 

through open sidewalls and the ridge in warm weather (Teye, 2008). Building location is 



9 
 

critical for natural ventilation to work well. Buildings on high ground are located where 

trees or structures do not disturb airflow around or through the building.  

Trees, silos, tall growing crops, and other structures can disrupt airflow for a distance 

of 5 to 10 times their height downwind. Thus, naturally ventilated buildings should be 

located at least 25 meters, in any direction, from such obstructions (MWPS-7, 2000). 

 
b) Building Orientation 

The first dairy barn design criteria to be considered are the orientation of the structure. 

Barns with a north-south orientation have a greater internal solar radiation exposure than 

barns with a east-west orientation (Brouk et al., 2001). Moreover, building orientation 

affects natural ventilating system performance. Orient naturally ventilated buildings to 

provide maximum wind exposure, especially for summer winds. Greater and more uniform 

wind driven air exchange occurs when the wind enters through the continuous sidewall or 

eave opening rather than through the smaller end wall. Cross ventilation, from side to side, 

is especially important during warm weather. Orient buildings so prevailing summer winds 

are perpendicular to the ridge openings (MWPS-7, 2000). 

The ideal orientation of the barn allows prevailing summertime winds to intersect the 

barn perpendicular to the sidewalls. When the farmer builds the barn using this orientation, 

the air entering the barn though the sidewall travels the shortest distance possible to exit the 

barn through the opposite sidewall. This improves the rate of air exchange in the barn and 

consequently enhances the environment of the cows. Since winds change direction, winds 

striking the sidewall within 45 degrees of the perpendicular will still result in adequate air 

exchange in most cases. Other factors that can affect barn orientation include future 

expansion, topography, cow flow, and manure flow. Producers should consider all of these 

factors when sitting and orientating their barns. 

 
c) Ventilation Openings 

The primary types of openings used in a naturally ventilated dairy barn are eave, ridge, 

and wall openings (sidewall and endwall). Controlling the size of these openings can 

control the ventilation rate to a great extent. The amount of inlet control needed depends on 

the season of the year and the climate (Chastain, 2000). 

In addition to building width and sidewall height, ridge openings are required. 

Armstrong et al. (1999) observed greater increases in afternoon respiration rates relative to 



10 
 

morning rates when cows were housed in barns with ridge coverings as compared to 

opening ridges. A ridge opening of at least 0.15 m (measured horizontally) should be 

provided for each 9.0 m of building width (Chastain, 2000) and  the bedded pack area or 

other less critical areas should also located under the ridge (Brouk et al., 2001).  

The sidewall opening should be at least 2.50 meters high, continuous the entire length 

of the building. Open sidewalls fully to provide maximum summer ventilation. With large 

sidewall openings, provide a 0.90 to 1.20 meters overhang at the eave to shade and partially 

shield the opening from blowing rain and snow piles and drifts. Ventilation through 

existing buildings can be improved by increasing the amount of open area, but do not 

compromise the structural integrity of the building. Endwall openings can provide 

additional ventilation to supplement sidewall openings in the summer (MWPS-7, 2000). 

The vertical separation between the eave and ridge openings has a significant impact on 

the pressure differences generated by the chimney effect (Chastain, 1987). Therefore, the 

roof slope is an important consideration in the design of a naturally ventilated building 

(Chastain, 2000). Roof slopes of 4/12 to 6/12 works very well in naturally ventilated dairy 

barns. Condensation and high interior summer temperatures are more likely with roof 

slopes less than 4/12 because of reduced air movement. Buildings with roof slopes steeper 

than 6/12 have greater chimney effect but they are generally not needed. Slopes of 3/12 are 

acceptable for open front buildings less than 9.0 m wide (MWPS-7, 2000).  

Determine ventilation rates in naturally ventilated facilities is a task even more difficult 

(Albright, 1990; Zhang et al., 2005). The air flow in CBP barn naturally ventilated is 

irregular and multidirectional, and generally has a very small value to measure accurately. 

Ventilation is also driven by temperature differences between indoor and outdoor 

installation. Therefore, to accurately estimate the natural ventilation is very difficult, 

because the areas of ventilation openings are large and along the entire length of the 

installation or through the ridge vent. Most CBP barns which has ventilation problems are 

resulted from poor design, construction or ventilation operational control system (Seedorf 

et al., 1998). 

  
2.1.4.2. Mechanical ventilation in CBP barns 

There are endless approaches to the mechanical ventilation design in dairy farming. For 

example, the precise number and location of fans required in a building would depend upon 

factors such as the density, construction, utilization and local climatic conditions (Wells, 



11 
 

2004). However, the components of the ventilation system should accommodate winter and 

summer conditions, such as: 

i) A continuous minimum air exchange: This is certainly required to remove the 

moisture constantly created by dairy cows, particularly during the colder, sub-freezing 

months of the year. 

ii) Higher air exchange rates and air velocity across the cows during the hotter summer 

weather to remove excessive heat from the cows. 

 
Mechanical ventilating systems have fans, controls, and air inlets or outlets. A well-

designed system provides greater control over barn temperature and air movement than 

natural ventilation (MWPS-32, 2000). Mechanical ventilation is used to ventilate barns or 

rooms with flat ceilings and buildings that are blocked from good natural ventilation by 

existing buildings and obstructions. 

Fans are the driving force in providing the required air exchange and it must be 

combined with properly sized and distributed fresh air inlets in order to work properly. The 

main criteria for selecting ventilation fans are capacity to provide a good air throw, fan 

size, drive type, and purchase and operating costs. In barns with tight construction and 

continuous, fan location has little effect on air distribution. Fans placed in groups or banks 

at a single location are preferred rather than spacing them out singly at different locations 

(Wells, 2004). Thus, fans should be selected to provide the required air volume for 

different weather conditions based on the number of cows in the barn. 

The minimum ventilation rates for dairy cows are given in Table 2.1. Recommended 

ventilation rates depend primarily upon the total weight of livestock housed in the space to 

be ventilated.

A recent innovation for hot weather cooling in CBP barns is the High Volume Low 

Speed (HVLS) ceiling fan (Figure 2.3). These fan units may be up to 7.2 m in diameter and 

they are operated by a 1 to 2 hp motor (Clarke and House, 2010). While the units are 

expensive to purchase, the payback period falls into the 4 to 5 year range, depending on the 

electricity prices and installation costs at the time. HVLS fans create a higher percentage of 

floor area with fewer dead or low velocity spaces.

Figure 2.2 - High Volume Low Speed (HVLS) ceiling fan (a) and differences before (b) 

and (c) after the installation HVLS in CBP barns. 
 

The Figure 2.2 illustrates a typical dairy herd enclosure in the height of the summer 

months without mechanical circulation. Thereby, before ceiling fans (HVLS) are installed 

(Figure 2.2b), the warm, muggy air sits in the building, which creates uncomfortable 

conditions for the cattle, creating heat stress for the animals, attracting flies, whilst also 

creating uncomfortable working conditions for staff. By installing ceiling fans within the 

enclosure (Figure 2.2c), this provides positive air movement, equalizing the temperature 

levels within the building during the summer for cattle and workers, with better cooling to 

minimize heat stress with the constant air circulation.

2.1.5. Economic considerations 

Numerous economic factors must be considered before deciding to build a CBP barn. 

CBP barns have lower capital costs compared to freestall barns because CBP barns require 

less concrete and stall equipment. In other words, the bedded pack can be built up on clay. 

Furthermore, there is less investment in manure storage structures because the bedded pack 

provides storage (Gay, 2009). 

Bedding costs and availability of bedding materials was by far the major concern 

expressed by the producers. Dairies with more than 200 cows may want to consider an 

alternative bedding to a CBP barn if they plan to use a compost barn for all their cows. A 

large number of cows will produce enough manure to require a significant amount of 

bedding material. In CBP barns, approximately three to four times more bedding is used in 

a CBP barn as in a freestall barn. Alternative bedding options are currently being tested. 

Preliminary results indicate that sawdust is the best option for these types of barn, but 

combinations of sawdust with other materials, such as finely ground soybean or flax straw, 

finely processed corn cobs, or wood chip fines can work relatively well (Endres and Janni, 

2009). 

The building costs ranged widely depending on the amount of on-farm labor utilized 

and amenities added. Labor requirements are similar for both types of barns. Properly 

maintained CBP barns require more daily labor (packs must be stirred twice daily and must 

have dry bedding added). However, less daily labor is required for manure handling. 

Producers should also consider the cost of handling manure. CBP barns reduce the 

amount of manure storage, but producers may need equipment to handle both liquid and 

dry manure. Keep in mind that dry manure can be easier to handle and may not have to be 

applied as frequently (Bewley and Taraba, 2009). 

 

2.2. Compost bedding pack 

2.2.1. Bedding source 

There are two driving factors behind good bedding choices. One is cow comfort, and 

the other is farmer comfort. Both of these objectives have some common and diverging 

areas. Cow comfort is critical because of the importance to both cow and farmer for the 

cow to spend time to lie down and performing the process of rumination. Therefore 

bedding must be comfortable to lie on. Nonabrasive bedding promotes both comfort and 



14 
 

injury reduction. A dry bedding surface is critical at all times both for cow comfort, 

reduction of infection from environmental mastitis organisms and for reduction in pathogen 

growth. Farmer comfort requires low bedding cost, labor efficiency, and the bedding drain 

or dry well to keep cows dry and limit growth of pathogens (Hashemi et al., 2001). 

Besides, drainage of bedding can be considered a negative factor, because regulatory 

agencies requires protection from groundwater contamination. Thus, operation of the bed 

should be below the water holding capacity (WHC). 

Fine wood shavings or sawdust is most commonly used in CBP barns as a bedding 

material (Janni et al., 2005). Wood shavings are preferred over sawdust because the small 

size of sawdust particles can enhance bacterial growth and irritate teat ends. Sawdust 

should be kiln-dried if used as bedding. However, competition for wood products has 

stiffened, driving up the price for wood residue. This calls into question the future cost and 

availability of this bedding. Faced with this uncertainty, producers and researchers have 

explored alternative materials that could work for bedding in CBP barns (Vokey, 2008). 

Some experience indicates that green or wet sawdust is not recommended. Other types of 

bedding may not work satisfactorily, increasing the mastitis risk for dairy cows. 

 
2.2.2. Management of the bedded pack 

Management of the composting bedded-pack is critical to the success of compost barns. 

The minimum space per cow for a CBP barn is recommended to be 6.0 m2 per animal for 

Jersey cows and 7.9 m2 for large breeds (Janni et al., 2007). However, 9.3 m2 or more per 

cow is recommended to prevent overcrowding and compaction of the bedding (Gay, 2009). 

Overcrowding may lead to increased SCC levels, increased bedding needs and potential for 

increased teat injury. The compost pack area is sized to allow all cows to lie down at the 

same time and still have space for a cow to get up to go and eat or drink. It is hypothesized 

that compost pack area per animal depends on the amount of manure and urine added to the 

pack daily. Moreover, more space per animal will reduce the frequency of bedding addition 

as a result of water evaporation rate, as affected by weather conditions and bed 

temperature, that may be comparable to deposition rate from manure and urine. The 

microbial activity and drying need to balance the amount of manure and urine added daily. 

CBP barns have bedding covering the loose housing floor to an initial depth of 0.30 to 

0.60 m. Cows deposit manure and urine onto the bedding when utilizing the CBP barn. 

Sometimes confinement in the barn is continuous between milking sessions. When cows 



15 
 

are in the barn, they have free access to a concrete alley where waterers and the feed bunk 

are installed. While the cows are being milked (two or three times per day), the bedded 

pack is tilled or stirred to incorporate the urine and manure that accumulate between 

milkings and to aerate the bedding material. Tillage is done with a skid steer, small tractor, 

or even an ATV equipped with a variety of tools (field cultivators, harrows, and rototillers 

have been employed), to a depth of 0.20 to 0.40 m. It is proposed that aeration is essential 

to incorporate oxygen for aerobic decomposition and to provide a fresh surface without 

accumulated manure for cows to lie down on after returning from the milking parlor or 

feeding. Some producers are aerating the pack deeper using a chisel plow with 0.40 to 0.45 

m deep, and have observed a reduction in bedding needs and increased pack temperatures 

(Janni et al., 2007). Manure handling on a daily basis takes about the same time or less as 

maintaining a freestall barn. 

Fresh bedding is added when there is moisture build up in the bedding and the cows 

become dirty. Typically this occurs every few weeks. The CBP barn may have increased to 

a depth of 1.0 to 1.2 m when removed after one year. 

 
2.2.3. Composting process in bedded pack 

Composting is the biological decomposition process that occurs under controlled 

aerobic conditions where microorganisms reduces heterogeneous organic matter into more 

stable chemical compounds with the release of heat, water vapour, and carbon dioxide. The 

description of the microorganisms participating in the composting process is complex, 

because the populations and communities change continuously as a function of the 

evolution of temperature, nutrient availability, oxygen concentration, water content and pH 

in the course of composting. The composting processes occur in nature, but systems can be 

designed and managed to enhance and accelerate the process. The by-product of 

composting consists of the biomass of dead and living microorganisms, and undegradable 

raw material besides stable by-products of decomposition (NRCS, 2010). 

Compost, in turn, is the nutrient amendment produced by an aerobic composting 

process as it is viewed in a compost bedded pack which is sufficiently stabilized to 

minimize or eliminate unpleasant odors, substantially reduce viable pathogens, facilitate 

storage, and handling without attracting insects and vectors. However, its complete 

stabilization is not considered practical or desirable because it would consume all the 

slowly degradable organic matter. The degree of stabilization and pathogen destruction 



16 
 

desired in compost depends on the purpose for composting and intended use of the compost 

by-product with a low risk of pathogen contamination. Compost is more stable (less 

microbially degradable), lighter, smaller in volume than raw manure. The finished product 

will need to meet the customer’s or operator’s needs (Goyal et al., 2005; Gajalakshmi and 

Abbasi, 2008). 

In addition to the presence of the needed microorganisms, major factors as nutrients, 

carbon to nitrogen ratio, moisture content, temperature, and aeration are important factors 

to a successful composting process. Characteristics as appearance, texture, and even 

maturity may not be an issue if the compost from a bedded pack is used for land 

application on the farm.   

In a CBP barn, the bed depth from surface that is tilled is called an oxic zone and acts 

like a frequently turned aerobic compost windrow with temperatures rising to the range of 

45 to 60°C when good composting conditions occur. The bottom of the CBP is called an 

anoxic zone and is under an anaerobic decomposition process with little oxygen available. 

No agitation occurs and it becomes compacted with the added overburden of compost, by 

cows and tractor wheels. As would be typical for compacted manure piles, temperature 

rises above ambient, but it is only in the 25 to 40°C range. Figure 2.3 illustrates a CBP 

zones with possible gas pathways and temperature profile. 

 

 

Figure 2.3 - Scheme of CBP zones with possible gas pathways and temperature profile.  

 
As previously mentioned, composting is an aerobic process, meaning it requires large 

amounts of oxygen for the microorganisms to grow. It can be supplied to the compost bed 

by diffusion, wind, natural convection or forced aeration. A minimum oxygen 

concentration of 5% within the pore spaces of the compost is necessary for composting 



17 
 

occurs. If the supply of oxygen is limited, the composting process slows and may turn 

anaerobic, which is a much slower and odorous process with the potential for large N 

nutrient losses through denirification. During the initial stages of this aerobic process, 

oxygen and the easily degradable nutritional components of the raw materials are rapidly 

consumed by the microorganisms (NRCS, 2010). 

Carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K) are the essential and 

primary nutrients required by the microorganisms involved in composting. Microorganisms 

use carbon for both energy and growth, while nitrogen is essential for protein production 

and reproduction. Thus, an appropriate ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C:N ratio) usually 

ensures that the others required nutrients for their survival are present in adequate amounts. 

In this process, the temperature is directly related to the microorganism activity of 

composting and is a good indicator of how the process is going inside the bed (Goyal et al., 

2005; Gajalakshmi and Abbasi, 2008). 

Composting process becomes inhibited when the moisture content is below 40%. Water 

displaces much of the air in the pore spaces of the composting materials when the moisture 

content is above 65%. This limits air movement and leads to anaerobic conditions. Once 

moisture, is over 65%, the rate of decomposition in the anaerobic zone is likely not to be 

high enough to generate mature compost because it is too wet to support rapid bacterial 

activity. Some activity certainly does occurs, however, the material is not uniformly heated 

to the extent necessary to be sold commercially as compost and it would not meet USDA 

Organic Certification requirements for pathogen reduction. In addition, the volume of the 

pack does not increase much during the summer months, as it does in winter, indicating 

that composting is reducing the volume of the bedded pack. If the operator wants to market 

the material as compost after removing it from the barn, it will require further processing 

(NRCS, 2010).  

Oxic zone can be modeled as a semi-continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with 

moisture and fresh organic matter (manure and urine) added by the confined cows and 

intermittently stirred with gases continuously exchanged between atmosphere and CBP 

barn. As the depth of the bed deepens with organic matter, solid material is exiting the base 

of the oxic zone since tillage or mixing is only in the top 0.20 to 0.40 m. Anoxic layer can 

be modeled as a batch reactor with organic matter decomposition occurring producing 

gases that move up to the oxic layer. A transition oxic/anoxic zone lies between these 



18 
 

layers where the oxygen in the gas phase decreases with depth from the bottom of the oxic 

layer to zero concentration at the anoxic layer. The material in this zone could be mixed 

during tillage (Goyal et al., 2005; Gajalakshmi and Abbasi, 2008). 

 
2.2.3.1. Microbiological processes in composting bedded pack 

In a model system, aeration decreases as depth of CBP bed increases in depth and 

causes an oxygen concentration gradient between aerobic surface and anaerobic subsurface 

environments. The CBP system represents a dynamic environment in which spatial 

distribution of microbes and microbial metabolic processes develops. The composting 

process results from the breakdown and stabilization of organic matter, with CO2 evolution 

and H2O evaporation. It is impacted by relatively simple management practices such as 

barn ventilation and circulation and mechanical mixing of the bed. 

Manure deposition provides a steady input of unstable C, organic N (protein and urea), 

and liquid fraction of the animal waste, which starts a cyclical series of microbial 

transformations over time transforming a fraction of this organic matter into inorganic C or 

N (Warner, 1942; Kristensen, 2000; Karthikeyan and Bhandari, 2001; Beffa, 2002; 

Megonigal, 2004; Peigne and Girardin, 2004; Goyal, et al., 2005). Figure 2.4 shows a 

spatial distribution of various microbiological processes in composting bedding.

trace gas formation.

a) Oxic zone:  

Gaseous emissions from the oxic zone during aerobic composting would contain 

emissions of ammonia (NH3) and moisture and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs): carbon 

dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). In aerobic respiration, bacteria and 

fungi use molecular oxygen (O2) to liberate the bulk of the energy (?H) from the organic 

matter that is being decomposed, producing carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into the 

CBP oxic zone.  

CxHyOz   +   O2   ?   CO2   +   H2O   +   ?H 
 
This is the principle fate of mineralized or oxidized organic carbon, occurring first by 

oxygen (O2). This process generates more energy, increasing the temperature of the tilled 

top zone, and consequently inactivates the disease organisms and increases the evaporation 

of moisture (Warner, 1942; Kristensen, 2000; Karthikeyan and Bhandari, 2001; Beffa, 

2002; Megonigal, 2004; Peigne and Girardin, 2004; Goyal, et al., 2005). 

In the manure substrate, nitrogen (N) is present in organic matter as protein or in urine 

in the form of urea (CO(NH2)2). Aerobically, CO(NH2)2 undergoes hydrolysis and it is 

rapidly decomposed  to NH4
+ 

 and CO2 by the intracellular and extracellular urease enzyme 

produced by bacteria present in both feces and soil. NH4
+ 

 and CO2 is also produced from 

the hydrolysis of protein in the organic matter. This process is known as ammonification. 

Controlled by thermodynamic equilibrium, the NH4
+ form is in equilibrium with NH3. This 

equilibrium is pH and temperature dependent. Due to concentration gradients, a fraction of 

NH4
+/NH3 is diffuse in the air-water interface of the manure, and it is partially emitted into 

the air. However, the dominant part of NH4
+/NH3 is either assimilated into microbial matter 

or nitrified to NO3
-.

At the first stage of nitrification, the NH4

+/NH3 fraction is oxidized to NO2
-. In the 

second stage, NO2
- is further oxidized to NO3

-. NO3
- can subsequently be converted into 

nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) and dinitrogen (N2) through denitrification 

(Blackburn, 1988; Robertson et al., 1989; Davidson, 1991; Henry et al., 1999; Maier et al., 

2000; Beffa, 2002; Senga, 2002; Megonigal, 2004). The process by which NO3
- is reduced 



20 
 

to nitrogen gases (N2 or N2O) is normally anaerobic but it can also occur in aerobic 

conditions where anaerobic microzones exist, such as internal spaces of porous organic 

particles. 

 
b) Anoxic Zone: 

The amount of denitrification depends on the availability of NO3
-, on moisture 

saturation, on temperature, and on availability of easily decomposable organic matter. 

Thus, if the bed becomes depleted of O2, some microorganisms can use the oxygen in NO3
- 

as an alternative. During this process, NO3
- is used as electron acceptor by fermentative 

microorganisms able to grow without free oxygen. The metabolic processes occurring 

while NO3
- is used as electron acceptor to form N2O and N2 are equal to those occurring 

with the presence of O2. In addition to N2 formation, N2O, NO and NO2 may be produced 

under not completely anaerobic conditions. 

The lower CBP anoxic layer also shows typical anaerobic gaseous emissions as 

methane (CH4), CO2, and other major gaseous emissions such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) 

and NH3, that moves upward or are absorbed in the oxic zone. Anaerobically, 

carbohydrates and organic acids originating from protein degradation are converted by 

mixed heterotrophic and fermentative bacteria and fungi to acetate (CH3COO
-/CH3COOH) 

and CO2, which in turn are transformed into CH4 by two different microbial pathways in a 

process called methanogenesis.  

CO2   +   H2   ?   CH4 

CH3COOH    ?   CH4   +  CO2 

 

Methanogenesis represents a significant portion of the carbon gas flow in the anaerobic 

zone. CH4 diffusing upward reaches the anoxic/oxic zone and it is consumed by oxidizing 

bacteria in a process known as methanotrophy (Megonigal, 2004). Thus, CH4 is oxidized in 

the presence of O2 so that it diffuses upwards to the oxic zone.  

 
CH4  +  O2   ?   H2O   +  CO2 

 
The same microorganisms that oxidize NH3 can oxidize CH4. This implies that CH4 

could inhibit NH3 oxidation and NH3 could inhibit CH4 oxidation, depending on the 

concentrations. Acidity of the CBP can affect this balance (Maier et al., 2000). 



21 
 

c) Oxic/Anoxic Zone: 

The oxic/anoxic interface of these two layers becomes a zone where organisms can 

potentially produce or decompose similar emission gases. Denitrifiers convert NO3
- to 

gaseous end products (NO, N2O, N2). The final gaseous phase products depend on 

available C and O2 supply. Oxygen level is reduced by microbial oxidation of available 

organic C, which affects the reductive steps controlled by distinct enzymes affected.

N2O is formed as an intermediate and it is available for release to the atmosphere 

through diffusion or during tillage (Warner, 1942; Kristensen, 2000; Karthikeyan and 

Bhandari, 2001; Beffa, 2002; Megonigal, 2004; Peigne and Girardin, 2004; Goyal et al., 

2005; Coyne, 2008). Within the oxic/anoxic environment, an alternative route for the 

conversion and removal of NH3 is possible for which substantially less information is 

known - anaerobic oxidation of NH3 (ANAMOX).

This process has been found at the oxic/anoxic interface, both in an aquatic 

microenvironment (Warner, 1942; Kristensen, 2000; Karthikeyan and Bhandari, 2001; 

Beffa, 2002; Megonigal, 2004; Peigne, and Girardin, 2004; Goyal, et al., 2005) and in 

wastewater treatment (Maier et al., 2000). In natural oxic/anoxic interface of aquatic 

sediment microenvironments where CH4, NO2
- and NO3

- are present, the following 

anaerobic methane oxidations are found (Raghoebarsing et al., 2006).

d) Entire Bed: 

 There are implications that gases, such as H2S, CO2, and CH4 that are formed in the 

anoxic zone and move upward through the CBP zones, can affect the microbial processes 

shown above. H2S emission can block the enzymes of microorganisms that oxidize NH3 to 

NO2
- at the oxic zone and the enzyme that reduces N2O to N2 at the oxic/anoxic interface of 



22 
 

both zone (Joye and Hollibaugh, 1995; Kristensen, 2000; Karthikeyan and Bhandari, 2001; 

Beffa, 2002; Megonigal, 2004; Peigne and Girardin, 2004; Goyal, et al., 2005).  

The enzymatic system for anaerobic NH3 oxidation can also be blocked by H2S effect. 

Because of these blockages, the N2O concentration at the oxic/anoxic interface rises if the 

organisms producing the needed enzyme for its production are present. The NH3 

concentration also rise. The CH4 produced in the anoxic zone it infiltrates the oxic zone and 

compete for the enzyme that oxidizes NH3. It is because the same microorganisms that 

oxidize NH3 can oxidize CH4 (Peigne and Girardin, 2004; Goyal et al., 2005).  

Factors, such as, aeration, moisture, mixing, and substrate supply alter the dynamic 

equilibrium that exists between all these processes. Aeration can increase methanotrophy 

and nitrification process. Poor ventilation or moisture saturation can enhance the capacity 

for menthanogenesis and denitrification. GHG evolution depends in large part on how the 

systems are managed to generate the starting substrates, the rates of the microbial 

processes, and the subsequent transfer of by-products formed between aerobic and 

anaerobic zones (Warner, 1942; Kristensen, 2000; Karthikeyan and Bhandari, 2001; Beffa, 

2002; Megonigal, 2004; Peigne and Girardin, 2004; Goyal et al., 2005). 

Within the oxic layer, it is still possible to have the formation of anoxic zones where 

dense clumps exist (Bewley and Taraba, 2009) and the air diffusion is restricted. The 

tillage sweeps do not produce homogenous aggregates which leads to a second mode by 

which aerobic and anaerobic microbial processes can produce GHGs. Spatial distribution 

of aerobic and anaerobic zones is not simply by depth, but also by location within large 

aggregates that are created in the CBP. 

 

2.2.4. Composting and moisture 

Composting requires sufficient moisture for active microbial activity but not so much 

moisture to hinder aeration. Moisture levels between 50% and 60% are generally 

recommended for the most of composting materials. Urine, wet manure, and moisture from 

microbial activity are the moisture sources in a composting bedded-pack. When moisture is 

too low, the microbes won’t have enough water, and the compost will be too cool, resulting 

in a compost rate that it is too slow. If the moisture level is too high, the pack becomes 

anaerobic (lacking in oxygen). In another words, the rate of microbial decomposition will 

be slow and again, composting and heat generation will also be too slow (Bewley and 

Taraba, 2009). 



23 
 

By stirring the pack, both moisture and manure can be mixed into the composting 

bedded-pack and will aerate the tilled layer. Good ventilation helps dry the freshly turned 

bedded-pack surface to retard bacterial growth on the surface and keep cows cleaner since 

dry bedding does not stick to the teat or leg surfaces. Compost barn owners from 

Minnesota recommend adding fresh bedding when the bedded pack becomes moist enough 

to stick to cows (Janni et al., 2005). 

A wet bedded pack is more vulnerable to compaction. The compaction may be caused 

by the machinery that is used for stirring. Lower ground pressure tillage machinery should 

help reduce media compaction. Compaction in turn reduces air flow and oxygen in the 

bedded pack and thereby the pack can become anaerobic more rapidly. An anaerobic pack 

shows lower temperatures which leads to reduced pathogen kill, and more pest and odor 

problems (Janni et al., 2005; Graves, 1999). 

  
2.2.5. Manure and effluent management 

Management of animal manure and effluent is an integral part of a total dairy producer 

management plan. Changes in agricultural production have led to fewer producers, larger 

average herd sizes, purchase of feed from distant areas, and a much higher concentration of 

animals and production facilities on less land. In some areas livestock operations have 

become concentrated, and non-farm residents have located amongst the farms. These 

features increase the challenge for implementing good manure management plans (MWPS-

7, 2000). 

A manure management system includes: collection, transfer, storage, possible 

treatment, land application, nutrient utilization, and sampling. 

Intensive, more specialized, concentrated animal production systems have altered the 

nutrient cycle and balance between crop production and animal production. Independent of 

operation size, a proper manure management system and plan are essential. A complete 

manure management system has the following goals: a) maintain good animal health and 

milk quality by providing sanitary facilities; b) avoid pollution of soil, groundwater or 

surface water; c) reduce odors and dust; d) control insect and other pest reproduction; e) 

and others (SWIM, 2011). 

Failure to provide adequate manure collection, handling, and storage facilities in 

conjunction with adequate land area for proper application and utilization of manure 

nutrients could adversely affect air, water, and land resources. 



24 
 

CBP barns owners have some strategies for managing the effluent and manure. Some 

producers have added a little of the composted pack to the feed alley to absorb moisture 

(Barberg et al., 2007). The concrete feed alley is scraped at least twice a day. The collected 

manure and bedding is stored in an approved manure storage unit until land applied 

according to a manure management plan.  

Bedded packs should be completely cleaned out each fall and applied to cropland as 

part of a manure management plan (Gay, 2009). CBP barns owners in Minnesota have been 

removing a portion of the pack for land application in Spring, and doing a complete 

cleanout in the Fall. While this works well for manure management, it presents concerns 

for nutrient management, since manure applied in Fall may lose nitrogen over the winter. 

The rationale for Fall cleanout is that the CBP barns owners want maximum manure 

storage over the winter (Barberg et al., 2007). When the material is removed from the barn, 

it can either be land spread as is, or composted further to produce a product suitable for 

horticulture, organic agriculture, and home gardens. As it comes out of the barn, the bedded 

pack material has a high C:N ratio, is high in soluble salts, and has pathogens in it, but it 

works well for meeting the nutrient requirements of field crops (Petzen et al., 2009). 

Compost used as a soil conditioner has the potential to result in higher crop yields and 

reduced erosion (NRAES-54, 1992). 

Care must be taken to avoid disturbing the clay base during clean out and pack stirring 

when the bedded pack is less than 0.30 m deep. Some users recommend starting with 0.45 

to 0.60 m of sawdust to avoid problems. The composting bedded pack is typically cleaned 

out and land applied in the fall after corn silage is harvested. Fall clean out allows time for 

a new pack to accumulate and begin composting before cold weather sets in. Some 

operators remove some of the bedded pack in the spring before fields are planted to make 

sure there is sufficient space for pack accumulation during the summer when cropland is 

not available for manure application. However, if a compost bed is active, particularly 

during the non-winter months, bed depth is reduced by microbial activity, but it can also 

occur due to less bedding used. Going into winter, there may not be a great depth and 

therefore adequate storage is present to get through winter. CBP barns require equipment to 

handle manure as both a solid (the pack) and a slurry (the feed alley manure). This 

increases a producer's investment in equipment (Janni et al., 2007).

2.3. Physical properties of the bedding material 

The physical properties of compost bedding materials play an important role in every 

stage of compost production as well as in the handling and utilization of the end product. 

From the mixing of various feedstock and process monitoring and maintenance, to the 

packaging and shipping of the final product, parameters such as porosity, bulk density, 

particle density, moisture content, water holding capacity and particle size affect the 

optimum composting environment and the design of machinery used in the system to 

promote the aeration of the compost bedding material. 

Although compost can vary and must be carefully tested to determine their exact 

nature, numerous laboratory trials with different products have successfully quantified the 

beneficial effects (CUC, 2003). 

 
2.3.1. Porosity 

Transport of mass and heat in a compost layers is significantly affected by the geometry 

and size distribution of the pores and the composition of the composting material. 

Therefore it is at least necessary to have information about the spatial distribution of 

porosity. Porosity can be calculated from dry matter content, true density of dry matter and 

total bulk density. Dry matter content and true density of dry matter are easily measured in 

the laboratory (Ginkel et al., 1999).  

Porosity is the ratio of the pore space to the total volume occupied by the material and 

the ideal bed porosity is one that provides the greatest surface area for microbial activity 

and the least resistance to airflow through the compost layer. It is determined by the 

particle size, the size gradation of the materials, and the continuity of the air spaces. Larger 

particles and more uniform particles increase porosity (NRAES-54, 1992). 

Porosity greater than 50% causes the compost layer to remain at a low temperature 

because energy loss exceeds heat produced. Too little porosity leads to anaerobic 

conditions and odour generation from too little oxygen occupying the reduced void space. 

The percentage air-filled pore space of composting layer should be in the range of 35% to 

50% (Bernal et al., 2009). 

 
2.3.2. Bulk density 

The bulk density of compost is a measure of the mass of material within a given 

volume and it is important in the determination of initial compost mixtures. The bulk 



26 
 

density determines how much material can be placed at a certain site (Agnew et al., 2003). 

The density of compost also influences the mechanical properties such as strength, 

porosity, and ease of compaction (Agnew and Leonard, 2003). Therefore, knowing the bulk 

density of the material throughout the compost layer is important for aeration, handling, 

and storage requirements. 

However, distinction is made between time dependent and independent processes to 

describe bulk density distribution. The time independent process results from the 

compressibility of composting material. Compressibility is defined as the reciprocal of the 

resistance of the material against mechanical deformation, or more precisely, as the ratio 

between deformation and stress. Due to this property the bulk density is a function of the 

local pressure and therefore depends on the position within in the compost bed (Ginkel et 

al., 1999). 

The time dependent process is defined as the increase of mechanical deformation as a 

function of time under constant pressure conditions (Ginkel et al., 1999). When a 

composting material is spread over the pack area, the initial bulk density distribution is 

only determined by the compressibility of the composting material. However, during the 

process, bulk density and porosity are also influenced by the combined effects of 

subsidence, loss of organic matter due to biological degradation processes and change of 

water content due to transport processes. 

The effect of compaction pressure on bulk density is also studied. It is observed that the 

effect of compaction pressure on bulk density for larger particles is higher in comparison 

with smaller particles, because smaller particles are closely packed leaving less space 

among the particles (Mozammel et al., 2006). 

Parameters that influence the bedding material performance are moisture content, bulk 

density and porosity (Wright and Inglis, 2002). This is relative to green materials that are 

high in water, which would not be suitable for bedding. Dried straw wood and other 

forages would be needed. Thus, increasing bulk density, moisture content and depth of the 

pack can result in decreased permeability, especially for oxygen. If the moisture content in 

the pack increases, particles get wet resulting in reduced strength of the media (Ahn et al., 

2009). This can cause anaerobic condition in the pack which leads to odor, low 

temperatures and emission of nitrogen compounds as well as methane. Materials that 

absorb too much water or urine are not suitable such as bedding material as this high 



27 
 

moisture content can rupture the cell walls which results in additional free water. In 

addition wet bedding also contributes to dirtier cows. 

Soybean straw and chipped pallet material worked well in combination with sawdust in 

the compost bedded pack system. Both materials provided the absorbency and bulk density 

necessary to meet cow comfort and the porosity required to promote an aerobic compost 

process (Petzen et al., 2009). 

 

2.3.3. Particle density 

The accurate quantification of particle density, as a component of bulk density, is 

vitally important for gravimetric compost measurements. For other media such as soil, 

particle density is often assumed to be 2.65 g cm-3, the density of quartz (Brady and Weil, 

2002). However, compost particle density is more inconsistent due to variation in source 

materials. 

Concisely stated, the method employs the submersion of a known mass of compost in 

methanol to determine the volume of the compost solids. While methanol is used because 

of its low density (0.66 g cm-3), the premise of the method remains valid for many other 

low density liquids. The use of a low density liquid causes particles that are normally 

buoyant in water to sink, facilitating an accurate measurement of the compost solids 

volume (Weindorf and Wittie, 2003). 

 

2.3.4. Moisture content 

It is the fraction or percentage of a substance comprised of water. The moisture content 

on a dry basis is the wet weight minus dry weight divided by the dry weight minus the 

container weight. To obtain the moisture content in percent, multiply this ratio by 100 

(Mukhtar et al., 2004). The general procedure involves weighing the wet sample and then 

drying the sample for 24 hours at temperatures of 105°C. The moisture content on a wet 

basis can be calculate using equation 2.1. 

 
Wet weight - Dry weight

Moisture  content (%) = 100
Wet weight - Container weight

?  (2.1) 

 
Methods for determining moisture content on the farm differ in the way that the sample 

is dried. Three common methods include air drying, conventional oven drying and 



28 
 

microwave oven drying. Although the results produced by these methods are less accurate 

than laboratory procedures, they are satisfactory for almost all composting situations 

(NRAES-54, 1992). 

The moisture content of compost affects the bulk density. Moisture content is also 

relevant because it affects compost handling. Compost which is dry can be dusty and 

irritating to the cows and workers, while compost which is wet can become heavy, making 

its application more difficult and transport more expensive. 

The ideal moisture content for composting must therefore be a compromise between 

achieving adequate moisture for the microorganisms to survive and adequate oxygen flow 

to maintain aerobic conditions. The moisture content for composting is generally 

recommended to be in the range of 40 to 60% (Shane et al., 2010; NRAES-54, 1992), and 

can be tested accurately using analytical equipment or approximated using a hand-squeeze 

method. In the hand-squeeze method, a handful of compost material is squeezed firmly 

several times to form a ball. If the ball crumbles or breaks into fragments, the moisture 

content is much less than 40%. If it remains intact after being gently bounced 3-4 times, the 

moisture content is nearly 50%. If the ball texture is slimy water droplets drip from or 

appear on the surface of squeezed bedding, the pack is too wet, the moisture content is 

much higher than 60% (Mukhtar et al., 2004). When the pack is working well, the bedding 

material will appear loose and fluffy, not compacted and chunky (Bewley and Taraba, 

2009). Pack moisture content in the top layer should ideally be monitored weekly to decide 

when clean bedding needs to be added to the pack (Shane et al., 2010) as opposed to when 

the cows are dirty. 

 

2.3.5. Water Holding Capacity 

Water holding capacity (WHC) is the ability of a given volume of compost to hold 

water under one atmosphere of pressure. In another words, WHC is the ability of compost 

to retain moisture against drainage due to gravity. Moisture (manure and urine) is held in 

the spaces, or pores, between compost material particles and thin films around these 

particles. Organic matter and particle size affect the compost ability to retain moisture. 

WHC is measured as a percent of dry weight. 

The WHC provides information on the amount of water that can be absorbed by the 

bedding material. High WHC allows the media to absorb water into the bedding. However, 



29 
 

depending on the cell structure of the media, high water content in the cell can sometimes 

lead to rupture of the cell which results in the media releasing free water (Vokey, 2008). 

This limits the media’s ability to function as a bedding material for longer periods of time. 

Some research have observed that WHC increased with decrease in the particle size of the 

compost media (Changirath et al., 2011). For this reason, one of the functions of the 

bedding material in the CBP barns is to retain moisture. Therefore, if the compost material 

has a high WHC, the ability of dairy producer to dry in the pack can be lower. 

 

2.3.6. Particle size 

Particle size and distribution are critical for balancing the surface area for growth of 

microorganisms and the maintenance of adequate porosity for aeration. The larger the 

particle size, the lower the surface area to mass ratio. So, compost with large particles does 

not decompose adequately because the interior of the particles has difficult accessibility for 

oxygen for aerobic microorganisms (Bernal et al., 1993). However, particles which are too 

small can compact the mass, reducing the porosity and airflow within the compost layer 

will be restricted. A mix of particle sizes creates the most porous layer, see Figure 2.5. 

  

 

Figure 2.5 - Porosity affecting the aeration: (a) Loosely packed - well structured, (b) 
Loosely packed - uniform particle size, (c) Tightly packed - uniform particle 
size, and (d) Tightly packed - mixed particle sizes. (CUC, 2003). 

 
Media particle size distribution is an important factor influencing the bedding moisture 

content, compaction and bulk density. Sawdust serves as a good carbon source and when 

fine materials like sawdust are used as a bedding media. They need to be turned frequently 

in the pack. It has also been suggested that the amount of fine particles in the bedding has 



30 
 

an effect on the bacterial population on the teat ends. Factors such as particle size may be 

more important than simply bacterial counts in the used bedding (CWMI, 2006). The finer 

the media, the more time is required to clean the udder before milking. 

Microbial activity generally occurs on the surface of the organic particles. Therefore, 

decreasing particle size, through its effect of increasing surface area, will encourage 

microbial activity and increase the rate of decomposition. On the other hand, when 

particles are too small and compact, air circulation through the compost layer is inhibited. 

This decreases O2 available to microorganisms within the compost and ultimately 

decreases the rate of microbial activity (NRAES-54, 1992). 

Particle size also affects the availability of carbon and nitrogen. Large wood chips in 

bedding, for example, provide a good bulking agent that helps to ensure aeration through 

the compost layer, but they provide less available carbon per mass than they would have in 

the form of wood shavings or sawdust. 

Handreck (1983) studied the particle size and physical properties of compost media and 

concluded that the fraction smaller than 0.5 mm, and in particular between 0.1 and 0.25 

mm, has the highest influence on porosity and water retention. 

 

2.4. Thermal property of the bedding material 

Compost thermal properties are required in many areas of agriculture engineering, 

agronomy, and animal science. In recent years, considerable effort has gone into 

developing techniques to determine these properties (Abu-Hamdeh, 2003). 

Thermal properties of compost bulking materials affect temperature and biodegradation 

during the composting process. Well determined thermal properties of compost feedstock 

will therefore contribute to practical thermodynamic approaches (Ahn et al., 2006). 

Thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and thermal diffusivity are the three 

important thermal properties regarding heat transfer analysis. These three thermal 

properties can be measured by several methods (Ahn et al., 2009). 

The thermal conductivity is the property that describes the heat transfer capacity within 

the compost material. The specific heat capacity is the amount of energy required to raise 

the compost material one degree Celsius. Thermal diffusivity has been used as an indicator 

for the utility of compost materials as an insulator or heat conductor. In other words, 

thermal diffusivity is the measure of thermal inertia.  



31 
 

Although thermal properties are very important in composting, information on their 

values for various compost materials is lacking. In general, it is difficult to determine the 

thermal properties of moist materials because forced heating during the measurements 

causes internal liquid and/or gas convection. This often results in overestimating the 

thermal properties. The thermal probe method is the most attractive method, because it uses 

relatively simple equipment to determine the thermal properties for moist materials 

(Iwabuchi et al., 1999). 

 

2.4.1. Thermal conductivity 

The thermal conductivity coefficient of a compound medium is often a very complex 

quantity. It is dependent not only on the components themselves, but also on structure, 

composition, density, porosity, water content and temperature (Van Ginkel et al., 1999). 

Certainly in a compost bedding layer, where all these parameters are changing during the 

compost management and process, the only way to obtain reliable values is to measure this 

quantity. Thermal conductivity can be measured by the steady and non-steady state 

(transient heat dissipation) methods (Mohsenin, 1980). 

Transient line heat source methods have been used several years to measure thermal 

conductivity of porous materials, like bedding compost. Typically a probe for this 

measurement consists of a needle with a heater and temperature sensor inside. A current is 

passed through the heater and the temperature of the probe is monitored over time. An 

analysis of the probe temperature is used to determine thermal conductivity. More recently 

the heater and temperature sensor have been placed in separate needles. In the dual probe 

the analysis of the temperature versus time relationship for the separated probes yields 

information on diffusivity and heat capacity as well as conductivity (Bristow et al., 1994). 

 
2.4.2. Specific heat capacity 

The specific heat capacity can be defined as the amount of heat energy required raising 

the temperature by one degree Celsius per unit mass (Incropera and DeWitt, 2001). Several 

researchers studied the behavior of thermal properties with the variation of water content of 

various biological materials and observed that there is a relationship in which the increase 

of water content causes high values of specific heat (Ahn et al., 2009). 

Factors influencing specific heat capacity that can be managed externally include 

moisture content and compost density. Moisture content plays a major role in specific heat 



32 
 

capacity but is the most difficult to manage (Abu-Hamdeh, 2003). Compost management 

affects specific heat capacity by the machinery that is used for stirring (Janni et al., 2005). 

Because of this, the bulk density increases and the porosity of a compost bedding 

decreases. This in turn have a significant effect on specific heat capacity. 

 

2.4.3. Thermal diffusivity 

Several studies have reported two of the thermal properties and obtained the thermal 

diffusivity using the following relationship  (Haug, 1980; Briaud and Chaouch, 1997; 

Bristow, 1998; Abu-Hamdeh, 2001): 

 

p

k
? = 

? C?
 (2.2) 

 
where: ? is the thermal diffusivity (m2/s), k is the thermal conductivity (W/m °C), ? is the 

bulk density (kg m-3) and CP is the specific heat capacity (J/kg °C). 

 

Thermal diffusivity, like thermal conductivity, is a property of the substance. The term 

k · ?-1 · Cp
-1

 appears in many heat conduction problems and is related to the diffusion 

coefficient used in mass transfer analysis or modeling. 

 

2.5. Chemical properties of bedding material 

Since a variety of organic materials can be used to make bedding composts (i.e., rice 

husks, coffee husks, bagasse, paper, peanut shell), it becomes very important to know their 

chemical characteristics, in order to obtain the required chemical characteristics for growth 

media (Zoes et al., 2001).  

Carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) are the primary nutrients 

required by the microorganisms involved in composting. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and 

potassium are also the primary nutrients for plants; so their concentrations also influence 

the value of the compost. 

Many organic materials, including manures and organic materials, contain ample 

quantities of nutrients (Table 2.2). Composts that are derived primarily from wood by-

products have high carbon to nitrogen ratios unless additional nitrogen is added during the 

composting process. Excessive or insufficient carbon or nitrogen is most likely to affect the 



33 
 

composting process. Microorganisms use carbon for both energy and growth while 

nitrogen is essential for essential protein production to the metabolism and reproduction. In 

general, biological organisms need about 25 times more carbon than nitrogen (NRAES-54, 

1992). Therefore, it is important to provide carbon and nitrogen in appropriate proportions. 

The ratio of carbon to nitrogen is referred to as the C:N ratio. 

 
Table 2.2 - Common feedstock and their characteristics 

Feedstock Moisture content (%) C:N Bulk density 
High in Carbon    
Hay 8 - 10 15 - 30 - 
Corn stalks 12 60 - 70 32 
Straw 5 - 20 40 - 150 50 - 400 
Sawdust 20 - 60 200 - 700 350 - 450 
Wood chips - 100 - 500 - 
High in Nitrogen    
Dairy manure 80 5 - 25 1400 
Grass clippings - 15 - 25  

Source: Adapted from NRAES-54 (1992). 

 
A balanced C:N ratio usually ensures that the other required nutrients are present in 

adequate amounts. To calculate the carbon content given C:N and percent nitrogen, solve: 

 
C(%) = N(%) · C:N  (2.3) 

 
Raw materials blended to provide a C:N ratio of 25:1 to 30:1 are ideal for active 

composting, although initial C:N ratios from 20:l up to 40:1 consistently give good 

composting results. For many applications, C:N ratios of even 50:1 and higher are 

acceptable. With C:N ratios below 20:1 the available carbon is fully utilized without 

stabilizing all of the nitrogen. The excess nitrogen may then be lost to the atmosphere as 

ammonia or nitrous oxide and odor can become a problem. Mixes of materials with C:N 

ratios higher than 40:1 require longer composting times for the microorganisms to use the 

excess carbon (NRAES-54, 1992).  

Compost bedded pack manure is an excellent nutrient source to use with zone-till and 

no-till cropping systems. This is because more of the nitrogen is in its stable organic form, 

compared to liquid or fresh (Petzen et al., 2009).

2.6. Biological properties of compost bedding material 

One of the aspects of composting that makes it an attractive alternative to the direct 

application of untreated manure is the high degree of pathogen destruction that is possible 

with a well-managed composting operation. The pathogen content of the compost is 

important because improperly treated compost can be a source of pathogens to the 

environment and, as such, a threat to humans and animals. 

 
2.6.1. Predominant groups 

Pathogenic microorganisms that may be in compost include bacteria, viruses, fungi, 

and parasites. Although parasites and viruses cannot reproduce apart from their host, they 

can often survive for extended periods. If they are not killed during the composting 

process, they can survive until the compost is land applied. At that time, they may infect a 

new host (NRCS, 2010). In the compost process, these species will thrive or fail according 

to their abilities to find a niche in the compost ecosystem (Sales, 2008). Typical species are 

shown in Table 2.3.

2.6.2. Bacteria  

Bacteria are the smallest living organisms and the most numerous in compost. They 

make up 80 to 90% of the billions of microorganisms typically found in a gram of compost. 

Bacteria are responsible for most of the decomposition and heat generation in compost. 

They are the most nutritionally diverse group of compost organisms, using a broad range of 

enzymes to chemically break down a variety of organic materials (CWMI, 2006). 

Among the bacteria, the actinomycetes, and the bacteria (gram negative and positive) 

are most important in the context of composting (Table 2.4), the former as allergens and 

opportunistic pathogens, and the latter as indicators of an insufficient thermohygienization 

(fecal coliforms) and as producers of endotoxins (Beffa, 2002).

importance in composting environments.

Bacterial growth over time can be graphed as cell number versus time. This is called a 

growth curve. The cell number is plotted as the log of the cell number, since it is an 

exponential function. Regardless of the generation time, in a growing culture, the plot of 

the log of cell number versus time gives a characteristic curve (MBS, 1999). This curve 

typically has four distinct phases: lag phase, exponential phase, stationary phase, and death 

phase, see Figure 2.6. 

Many factors affect the generation time of the organism: temperature, pH, oxygen, salt 

concentration and nutrients are some of the common factors that may change in the normal 

environment of bacteria. Due to difficulties in tracking and quantifying the relationships 

between physical factors and bacterial populations, it has not been possible to fully 

understand the ecological processes important in composting. Identifying these 



36 
 

relationships has been complicated by the presence of an uncontrolled bacterial inoculum 

that varies between operations due to variations in material handling, air conditioning, and 

substrate composition (Schloss et al., 2003). Several previous composting studies, though, 

have attempted to quantify bacterial populations using different techniques (Nakasaki et al., 

1985; Strom, 1985).

from MBS, 1999). 

 

2.7. Mathematical modeling 

Mathematical modeling is a method of research that investigates, through 

mathematical problems, phenomena or situations from different areas such as physics, 

chemistry, biology, engineering, and others, consisting in an area of research that is 

essentially interdisciplinary, to make predictions about the situation or problem 

investigated. This set of relations is called a mathematical model of the problem studied. 

The dynamic process used to create and validate such models is called mathematical 

modeling (Bassanezzi, 2002). 

Mathematical modeling has a role to evaluate the interaction between several factors 

allowing a more detailed study in order to predict the processes of interest, and the ideal is 

to formulate a model capable of describing the original study, without the difficulties 

encountered in observations and measurements made during examination of the problem. 

Moreover, the mathematical model is a simplification of the system being studied, and 

cannot predict all the variables present. The resulting prediction may not be accurate or 

reliable. When using f mathematical models, it is necessary to determine the parameters 



37 
 

through empirical experimentation implying the need for several samples (Pereira and 

Machado, 1987). 

Over many years agricultural buildings, such as dairy barns, have become tailored for 

specialized production The need to maintain control over the indoor climate has become 

ever more important so that the requirements of the production system can be continuously 

met. In essence it is necessary to understand the interaction of all climatic variables, 

alongside their contribution to the occupants heat exchange with its surroundings in order 

to predict the micro-climate (Norton et al., 2007). 

Therefore, the thermal environment of a agricultural building is intricately linked with 

ambient conditions. Optimizing and controlling ventilation systems are not elementary 

problems and may require extensive experimentation (Boulard et al., 2002a; Zhang et al., 

2000). Sophisticated techniques that allow efficient and accurate description of the 

dominant phenomena are often required. The mathematical modeling of the interaction 

between the indoor production system, the ventilation system and the outdoor environment 

is thus a necessary requirement. The clear advantages of developing mathematical models 

for agricultural buildings are as follows (Schauberger et al., 2000): 

a) They can quantify the essential needs of the occupant in all parts of ventilated 

buildings and consequently contribute to the development of optimization strategies aimed 

at increasing production performance. 

b) They can be incorporated as part of indoor climate control, as well as to check the 

design values of the ventilation system. 

c) They can combine the spatial and temporal dependent parameters that affect release 

of all pollutants within the building to efficiently calculate time-varying concentrations 

within, and emissions from production systems. 

d) They can quantify different housing systems with alternative manure management 

techniques to achieve a fully integrated control of pollution. 

 
Therefore, agricultural production systems, which are amenable to description through 

the physical laws of fluid motion, heat and mass transfer processes, can be effectively 

modeled so that the benefits of pre-design evaluation, design and optimization strategies 

can be realized (Norton et al., 2007). 

The modeling of ventilation flow in agriculture building can be can be performed 

using the Navier-Stokes equations (Norton et al., 2007). The Navier–Stokes equations 



38 
 

represent the dynamic behavior of a flow regime, both spatially and temporally. These 

equations constitute a micro-model of fluid motion, and require time consuming iterative 

techniques to solve them. Thus, the efficient quantification of ventilation in agricultural 

buildings can be carried with a macro-model based on Bernoulli’s equation. This requires 

some qualifying assumptions so that the model matches the spatial domain of interest, such 

as the flow is not viscous; steady, not rotational; with hydro-static and gravity as the only 

acting external force (Roy et al., 2002). Consequently, much information on the flow is 

lost, including details on the spatial distribution of the airflow patterns, which can lead to 

inaccuracies in the calculated airflow variables (Boulard et al., 2002b). 

According to Mueller and Krause (2007), when sizing ventilation systems there are 

different methods which may be used to obtain an overall view of the heat transfer and 

mass transport phenomena inside the animal production facility, including numerical 

simulation of flow, physical models and measurements on a real scale. 

a) Numerical simulation of flow: from this simulation it is possible to study the 

behavior of fluids in motion. Therefore, it has become very interesting to study these 

phenomena with the advance of faster computer processors and more efficient software. 

Fluid mechanics include, for example, study of either laminar or turbulent fluid and gas 

flow in animal installations. This type of study may present important practical applications 

in the diverse areas of engineering. 

b) Physical models: investigations with physical models offer greater support to the 

numerical simulation of mass flux. The ventilation system as well as the flux of air volume 

may be altered by a simple formula, i.e., the reconstruction of entire elements may be 

performed quite simply in such models. 

c) Another form of evaluating the dispersion behavior of gases coming from animal 

installations is by the utilization of the wind tunnel boundary limit, where in many cases 

these are equipped with air velocity sensors and gas analyzers to measure the variation in 

concentration. 

d) Real scale measurements: are necessary to confirm the numerical and physical 

models in real conditions. A specific problem is the determination of volumetric air flux in 

naturally ventilated animal installations (Mueller and Krause, 2007). 



39 
 

Various studies involving mathematical modeling and computational simulations have 

been developed during experimentation to improve understanding of the processes 

involved in the transfer of heat and mass between animals and their thermal environment. 

 

2.8. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) 

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be defined as a numerical resolution based 

on computational loops and the equations of mass, momentum and energy conservation for 

physical systems (Miranda, 2009). The method works by solving the equations of 

transporting mass and energy and momentum through a process number called difference 

numerical methods. Figure 2.7 illustrates the initial work of the numerical method, which is 

discretize the domain in a number of non-coincident sub-domains forming a grid of small 

elements (or volume control) to which a discrete solution can be obtained. For this, some 

transformations are performed in differential transport equations, defined continuously in 

the domain, in a system of algebraic equations for the discretized Domain (Maliska, 1995). 

 

 

Figure 2.7 - The initial work of the numerical method: discretize the continuous domain 
(Maliska, 1995). 

 

The CFD methodology was initially and widely used in aerospace industry, 

automotive, naval, and nuclear. Recently it has been applied in agricultural engineering. 

The availability of high-performance, low cost computers and with the emergence of CFD 

programs with friendly interfaces, has allowed great advances in the use of this technique 

since the 90's. Moreover, the versatility and generality of the numerical methods for 

simulation of engineering problems, and the relative simplicity of application of these 

techniques are other factors motivating the use of CFD. 

This technique provides precise solutions as well as visualizations of velocity, 

pressures, temperature, turbulence and gas concentrations in the entire space of the animal 



40 
 

installation without various physical scale test models. Results allow that engineers and 

operators to develop new ventilation strategies to meet the standards for air quality (Lee 

and Short, 2000). 

Modeling in CFD is important to predict mass transport in different types of animal 

structures, especially when field measurement of the variables related to the model is 

difficult. In the case of modeling gas emission that eliminate from inside the installations, 

for example NH3, the computational models are based on the NH3 transport process and the 

transport mechanism to the atmosphere (Bjerg et al., 2002). 

Currently, sophisticated commercial CFD programs like CFX (ANSYS CFX 13.0, 

2011), can run on personal computers in the workplace and even at home. Also the costs of 

the required equipment acquisition are getting smaller. Thus, it becomes easier to use 

numerical techniques for solving engineering problems.,  

Undertaking a CFD study demands the use of four predefined environments within the 

software, with each environment representing an equally important section of the modeling 

process. The following provides an introduction to the different modules comprising a CFD 

software package: a) generating geometry and mesh; b) pre-processor; c) solver manager; 

and d) post-processor. 

 
a) Geometry and mesh generator:  

It consist of insertion of problem into CFD code. The embedded information involves: 

i) Definition of geometry and solution domain: This step can be performed in a 

secondary program; CAD (Computer Assisted Drawing) as SOLIDWORKS® or 

Rhinoceros® and then imported by the CFD code, operation commonly performed when 

working with CFX. 

ii) Meshing: consists of discretization of a continuous domain into a set of discrete 

sub-domains, usually called elements. 

Approximately 50% of the time used in a CFD project is to define the geometry and 

mesh generation (Malalasekera and Versteeg, 1995). In CFX, DESIGNMODELER module 

is used to generate or import geometry and CFX-Mesh is used to generate the mesh. 

 
b) Pre-processing:  

The pre-processor of CFD software holds all the mathematical statements attributable 

to the potential success of a modeling exercise and therefore embodies the most important 



41 
 

phase of model definition. The main tasks facing a user in the pre-processing environment 

include problem consideration, geometry creation or import, mesh development, physical 

property set-up, and the implementation of solving techniques and parameters. 

 
c) Solver manager:  

The solver environment, within all commercial CFD software packages, organizes the 

mathematical input from the pre-processor into numerical arrays and solves them by 

iterative methods (Norton et al., 2007). Iterative methods are commonly used to solve a 

whole set of discretized equations so that they may be applied to a single dependent 

variable. Segregated solving techniques, such as Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked 

Equations (SIMPLE) used by most commercial CFD software packages, determine the 

pressure field indirectly by closing the discretized momentum equations with the continuity 

equations in a sequential manner (Patankar and Spalding, 1972). However, as the number 

of cells increase the elliptic nature of the pressure field becomes more profound and the 

convergence rate is inhibited. This has led to the development of multigrid techniques that 

compute velocity and pressure corrections in a simultaneous fashion, thus enhancing 

convergence rates (Ferry, 2002). 

 
d) Post-processor:  

The post-processing environment allows the user to visualize and investigates the 

resulting field solution. Contour, vector and line plots enhance interpretation of results and 

are being progressively fortified in commercial software packages. Some packages also 

allow the export of field data to external modeling programs so that it can be processed 

further (Norton et al., 2007). In CFX, the CFX-POST module is used for post-processing. 

Thus, the complete analysis in CFD is composed of pre-processing, processing and 

post-processing, which includes the procedures and phenomena to adequately analyze the 

configuration of the problem with the solution, monitoring and analysis of results at the end 

of simulation (Rocha, 2012). 

 
2.8.1. ANSYS 

ANSYS is a set of commercial software for numerical solutions in fluid dynamics 

modeling and other physical phenomena with a multidisciplinary approach and the 

possibility of integration with other types of physical simulation technologies, which the 



42 
 

main tools for simulation and analysis of fluids are known by FLUENT and CFX (Xia and 

Sun, 2002). 

 
2.8.2. Governing equations 

The governing equations of fluid flow and heat transfer can be considered as 

mathematical formulations of the laws of conservation which regulate all fluid flows, heat 

transfer and associated phenomena. These laws of conservation describe the rate of 

variation of a desired fluid property as a function of external forces. 

 

a) Conservation of mass: 

The law of conservation of mass states that mass can neither be created or destroyed. 

This is the basis for the continuity equation. It can be represented in Cartesian coordinates 

by the following equation (Rocha, 2012; Hirsch, 2007). 

 

? ? ? ? ? ?z? u? u ? u? = + +  = 0

where,  

t is the time (s); 

? is the density (kg m-3); 

x, y, z are the coordinate direction; 

ux, uy, uz are the velocity in the directions x, y, z respectively. 

 

b) Conservation of momentum: 

The sum of the external forces acting on the fluid particle is equal to its rate of change 

of linear momentum (Rocha, 2012).

c) Conservation of energy: 

The equation for the conservation of the energy is derived from considerations of the 

first law of thermodynamics. The rate of change of energy of a fluid particle is equal to the 

heat addition and the work done on the particle (Rocha, 2012).

2.8.3. Method solution 

Two methodologies are used to solve the system of equations: segregated solver 

solution and coupled solution. The method employs a numerical strategy solution, where 

the equations of conservation of momentum are solved with a estimated pressure, and then 

a correction equation for the pressure is applied. Because of the nature of this methodology 

of correction estimation, a large number of iterations, and a very careful selection of the 

significant parameters affecting the convergence of a numerical parameters are necessary, 

in the case of steady state (Santos, 2008). 

The coupled method, used by CFX, solves the hydrodynamic equations as a single 

system. Figure 2.8 illustrates the general procedure of solution. The solution of equations 

for each set consists of two intensive numerical operations, for each step in time. 

 



44 
 

 

Figure 2.8 - Overall solution strategy of CFX (ANSYS CFX 13.0, 2011). 

 
The iteration time is controlled by a step of physical time, global, or a false time step, 

locally configured to advance the solution for a simulation time in continuous operation. If 

the model is steady state, there is only one interaction of linearization step of virtual time. 

The solution's performance is improved with the use of a technique called Multigrid 

(Brandt, 1977), a process to increase the size of the mesh elements for later iterations. This 

results in a reduction of virtual quality of the spacing of the mesh during the iteration, and 

return to the original mesh obtaining an accurate solution. The use of this technique 

significantly improves the convergence rate. 

The CFX uses a particular implementation of the algebraic Multigrid called correction 

additive (Hutchinson and Raithby, 1986). This approach is ideally suited to the ANSYS 



45 
 

CFX-Solver implementation, because it takes advantage of the fact that the discrete 

equations are representative of the balance of conserved quantities over a control volume. 

The coarse mesh equations can be created by merging the original control volumes to 

create larger ones as shown in Figure 2.9. Figure 2.9 shows the merged coarse control 

volume meshes to be regular, but in general their shape becomes very irregular. 

 

 

Figure 2.9 - Scheme of an algebraic Multigrid method. 

 
2.8.4. Simulation in CFD for animal facilities 

The first studies using livestock installations in CFD were performed by Choi et al. 

(1988), in which a simple geometry was used to represent the animal installation, but 

results showed little precision. Small advances in the development of real solutions were 

made in the next year. Hoff et al. (1992) utilized CFD to model air flow in a rectangular 

shaped installation, in which heat transfer was modeled using a heated floor. Harral and 

Boon (1997) later simulated isothermal flow patterns in a 3D geometric representation of a 

cattle confinement. In following years, more studies were developed for validation of 

animal installations with a focus on the creation of more precise CFD models (Zhang et al., 

2000). Only in recent years have CFD models used for simulation of heat and mass transfer 



46 
 

in a geometric representation become reliable in animal production installations (Van 

Wagenberg et al., 2004). Therefore, more detailed conditions are provided of all 

phenomena that occur when CFD is employed, and dynamic models, together with 

estimates, are provided. 

 
a) Birds:  

Among environmental factors, thermal factors represented by air temperature, relative 

humidity, thermal radiation, and air movement are those which most directly affect the bird 

since they are warm-blooded animals. These environmental variables may have either 

positive of negative effects on bird production. High temperature and high relative 

humidities inside aviculture installations are factors which limit the achievement of optimal 

productivity (Damasceno et al., 2010a). Therefore, the need to maintain the thermal 

environment within an optimal production scale is evident. However, there are few studies 

with CFD which utilize a mass balance and heat transfer inside aviculture facilities. 

Worley and Manbeck (1995) utilized a CFD model to analyze the distribution of 

contaminants in a highly turbulent flow inside an aviculture installation under different 

roofing configurations, whose objective was to obtain a better configuration of air 

circulation to eliminate particulate material.  

Pawar et al. (2007) analyzed the distribution of virus particles which generate diseases 

in aviculture installations, and for this considered an analogy between the diffusion of 

ammonia gas (NH3) and dispersion of virus particles. 

Damasceno et al. (2010b) developed and validated a CFD model to analyze the 

temperature and air velocity distribution inside a common commercial heater used in 

Brazilian poultry production. These authors concluded that the CFD models may be used 

for real time prediction of thermal behavior and velocity distribution (inside the 

combustion chamber for heating), aiding in project improvements. 

Tinôco et al. (2010) used CFD to simulate an aviculture installation with mechanical 

ventilation associated with an evaporative cooling system. In this study the authors 

developed a CFD model to obtain a better understanding of the temperature and air velocity 

distribution inside the aviculture installation. The obtained results showed a good statistical 

correlation with experimental data, which permits its use to address future modifications to 

the installation. 

 



47 
 

b) Cattle: 

The air quality conditions in a cattle confinement are dynamic and change 

continuously. Pollutant gases and excesses of humidity, microorganisms and particulates 

are produced from various sources, such as the floors, walls, feeds, water and air which 

infiltrates the installation. Therefore gas emissions directly depend on atmospheric 

influences which permanently change the conditions. 

Various approaches to solve this problem have been studied. The quantification of 

carbon dioxide as well as mass and heat balances were performed by Van Ouwerkerk and 

Pedersen (1994) according to a method for calculating the concentration difference 

between interior and exterior air to determine the concentration levels.  

Gebremedhin and Wu (2003) utilized predictions based on CFD simulations to aid in 

modeling of the thermal environment in dairy cattle installations. In their study, the Fortran 

computational program was used to calculate all models which were necessary for 

determination of heat and mass transfer on the body of these animals. These authors thus 

used this method together with CFD simulations for heat and mass transfer between 

animals and the environment. 

Gebremedhin and Wu (2005) studied the utilization of CFD simulations for air flux in 

a simple geometric cattle installation with forced ventilation to investigate the heat and 

mass transfer phenomena. They discovered that the total heat loss of an animal is highly 

dependent on its position and orientation for the flow field. For example, a cow positioned 

near the air entrance may lose a total of 710 W in heat, while an animal positioned at the 

other extremity of the installation may lose only 214 W of heat. Figure 2.10 illustrates a 

CFD predicted flow field around cows in a ventilated room.

Norton et al. (2010a) used a CFD model to provide insight into the air mixing 

characteristics in a calf building during wind-driven and wind and buoyancy-influenced 

ventilation. This study found the porosity of the eave opening cladding system heavily 

influenced the mixing of indoor air during wind-driven ventilation, with the low porosity 

cladding significantly enhancing the building’s ventilation efficiency. Figure 2.11 shows 

the simulated air distribution patterns in the calves building. 

 

 

Figure 2.11 - The predicted flow patterns on a vertical plane in the calves building with a 
wind speed of 0.5 m s-1 (Norton et al., 2010a). 

 

c) Swine: 

Production and reproductive performance of swine depend on the employed 

management system, which involves the selected system of breeding, nutrition, and the 

installations themselves. These installations, which demand a large initial investment, are 

constructed in function of the costs and facilities of the caretaker, often neglecting the 

comfort of the animals. Thus, many times the application of CFD models on the 

environment of these animals are directed towards the optimization of environmental 

conditions (Bjerg et al., 2000; Sun et al., 2002; Sun, 2004). These studies may be 

efficiently grouped for modeling of pollutant dispersion and the thermal environment 

inside swine production installations. 

Sun (2004), utilizing CFD models for two and three dimensions, obtained good results 

for the determination of ammonia concentration distributions during summer and winter 

conditions in a commercial High-Rise™ Hog Building (HRHB). 

 

 

 



49 
 

2.9. Reduced models 

The use of reduced models is a widely used tool in engineering, but its use requires a 

clear understanding of the principles governing the relationship between the model and 

prototype. For the behavior of a prototype can be derived from a model is necessary that 

both behave in a qualitatively similar and that a quantitative relationship can be established 

among them (Jentzsch, 2002). 

Reduced models, when examined with certain criteria of similarity, can be substitutes 

for valid systems that, for some reason cannot be studied in full-size prototypes. The scale 

utilization of physical phenomena can be advantageous for four reasons (Schuring, 1977):  

a) When the problem is treated as very complex or unfamiliar, and empirical 

information is necessary for an analytical approach; 

b) Reduced models allow the reduction ratio of the system to facilitate the handling; 

c) Allows a reduction in time required to perform the research; and 

d) Provides a greater understanding of the phenomenon investigated. 

 

The similarity theory is developed by dimensional analysis. Objectives establish the 

necessary relations for the behavior of a prototype and can be determined from 

observations in a model and the relationships between the variables involved in the 

phenomenon, so that the data can be systematized safely (Költzsch and Walden, 1990). 

The high cost involved in building a structure for agricultural research of new 

technologies, such as dairy housing, often do not include the execution of a study due to 

limited resources. In this way, the use of reduced models to study various types of roof 

ridge and effects on natural ventilation in a dairy housing can contribute significantly to 

reducing the cost of research, and allows testing various settings by changing the model at 

a lower cost than in a full-scale prototype. 

The use of reduced building models for animal production are mainly limited by the 

difficulty of performing the tests under production conditions, thus simulating the heat and 

moisture dissipation by the animals must be added to the system. 

The use of scale models to study the behavior of physical phenomena of a system, 

expanded with the development of the theory of similarity from the 19th century. This 

development was due to the need to understand the behavior of physical phenomena 

involved in new technologies generated mainly in the aerospace industry and shipbuilding. 



50 
 

In this way, several models have been proposed to solve field problems and to facilitate the 

understanding of various physical processes, such as air-flow characteristics of a scale 

model chamber (Weller et al., 1970), reduced model to study of alternative ventilation 

systems for a broiler house (Wilson and Bishop, 1974), ridge vent and wind direction 

effects on ventilation characteristics of a model livestock building (Egan and Hellickson, 

1977), algorithm for determining opening effectiveness in natural ventilation by wind 

(Nääs et al., 1998), and others. 

An important factor in making reduced models is the relationship between cost and 

accuracy or quality. If the cost increases with the requirement of accuracy of the model, it 

is necessary to establish the standard that meets the proposed objectives, see Figure 2.12.

and Walden (1990). 

 

2.9.1. Similitude theory 

Many problems in practical engineering, involving heat and mass transport over time, 

can be modeled using solved equations and procedures to describe processes. But a large 

number of problems can be solved only if the mathematical models are related to the 

experimental data (Rocha, 2012). 

A mathematical model describes the behavior of a real-life system in terms of 

mathematical equations. These equations represent the relations between the relevant 

properties of the system under consideration. Parameters that can be influenced by the 

observer are referred to as adjustable. The other parameters act as constants in the model. 

For example, in atmospheric models used in weather forecasting, one is interested in 

properties like temperature and humidity (the dependent variables) as functions of position 



51 
 

and time (the independent variables). Important parameters are then the gravity field and 

the rotational speed of the earth, and these clearly belong to the class of nonadjustable 

parameters. The solution of a mathematical model is known if we can determine the 

relations between dependent and independent variables. Since the solution depends on the 

values of the adjustable parameters, mathematical models are a powerful tool with which to 

determine which values of the adjustable parameters yields specific required behavior. 

The basic considerations of dimensional analysis and similarity theory are also used to 

assist the engineer to understand and correlate the data that were obtained in their study or 

by other researchers. One objective of experimental research is to analyze the systems to 

make them applicable. Thus, the concept of similarity is often used (Vekariya et al., 2011).  

In the process of construction of scientific knowledge, the  models have been used as 

the link between research and theory. In this way, it means that the model productions and 

physical reproductions of the processes, structures, and objects can be accomplished using 

the homology and analogy. In homology, the original and model have the same basic 

physical qualities, and the difference between them is mainly quantitative (Jentzsch, 2002).  

The use of homology results in physically similar models. However, in analogy, the 

original and model have different basic physical qualities, but have in common structural 

and functional characteristics. The use of models results in similar physical analogy 

(Murphy,1950). 

So the prototype and the model are similar when all quantities homologous features 

present a constant relationship between them, in other words, similarity between them are 

constants (Jentzsch, 2002). These constants of similarity (cs) can be set for all magnitudes a 

basic measurement system, such as length, mass, time, temperature (index M = model and 

P = prototype): 

 

Length	 ?	cs   (2.8) 

 

Mass	 ?	cs   (2.9)  

 

Time	 ?	cs   (2.10) 

 

Temperature	 ?	cs?
?

?
  (2.11) 



52 
 

By combining these constants of similarity, one can obtain a variety of products, such 

as widely used dimensionless physical quantities (terms Pi), the Reynolds, Grashof, and 

Prandtl numbers (Jentzsch, 2002).  

 

2.9.2. Buckingham Pi -Theorem 

The Buckingham theorem provides a method for computing sets of dimensionless 

parameters from the given variables, even if the form of the equation is still unknown. 

Thereby, according Murphy (1950), consider a system with variables x1, x2, x3,. . . , xn and 

a function between them: 

 

ƒ(x1, x2, x3, ... , xn) = 0  (2.12) 

 

If k is the number of fundamental dimensions required to describe the n variables, then 

there will be k primary variables and the remaining s = k – n variables can be expressed as 

n – k dimensionless and independent quantities or Pi groups. Thus, the function f can be 

replaced by the function: 

 
ƒ(?1, ? 2, ? 3, ... , ? s) = 0  (2.13) 

 

The previous function can be determined if the term ?1 had a intended dependent 

variable, then: 

?1 = ƒ(?2, ?3, ... , ?s)  (2.14) 

 

Thus, Equation 2.14 is general and can be applied to any other system that is a 

function of these variables, and consequently a particular system called model (index M). 

 

?1M = ƒ(?2M, ?3M, ... , ?sM)  (2.15) 

 

Thus, can one can obtain a prediction equation for ?1 from ?1M through division 

Equation 2.14 by Equation 2.15. 

 



53 
 

? ?
? ?

2 3 s1

1M 2M 3M sM

f ? , ? ,..., ??
=

? f ? , ? ,..., ?
 (2.16) 

 

If the model is designed and operated as follows below: 

 

?2M = ?2  (2.17) 

?3M = ?3 

?sM = ?s 

 

Then, 

 

ƒ(?2, ?3, ... , ?s) = ƒ(?2M, ?3M, ... , ?sM)  (2.18) 

 

And consequently: 

 

?1M = ?1  (2.19) 

 

Equation 2.19 is the prediction equation, which will be valid only if the operating 

conditions and project demands are fulfilled (Murphy, 1950). 

On the other hand, if it is not found that all design criteria and operating conditions 

affecting the prediction equation are not met, then this may change the behavior of the 

model, (Timmons et al, 1978). Thus, the correction of the prediction equation can be made 

by determining predictive factor ?, so (Murphy, 1950): 

 

?1 = ??1M  (2.20) 

 

2.9.3. Models versus prototype 

Performing scale analysis is mathematically straightforward. However, there are 

several issues to consider (Bahrami, 2012): 

a) List of variables that are involved in the phenomenon under investigation: Selection 

of important variables is not a trivial task and requires considerable judgment and 

experience. 



54 
 

b) Reynolds number: generally the prototype has a very large Reynolds number (Re), 

in which case slight variation in Re causes little effect on the behavior of the problem. 

Unfortunately, models are sometimes so small and the Reynolds numbers are large and the 

viscous effects take effect. This situation should be avoided to achieve correct results. 

Solutions to this problem would be to increase the size of the model, or more difficult, to 

change the fluid (change the viscosity of the fluid) to reduce the Re. 

c) After selecting important parameters and determining Pi groups, one should seek to 

achieve similarity between the model tested and the prototype to be designed. In general, 

flow conditions for a model test are completely similar if all relevant dimensionless 

parameters have the same corresponding values for the model and the prototype. Therefore, 

three particular types of similarity can be determined. 

i) Geometric similarity: concerns the length dimension (L) and it must be ensured 

before any model testing can proceed. In general geometrical similarity is established when 

a model and prototype are geometrically similar when all body dimensions in all 3 

coordinates have the same linear scale ratio. 

Figure 2.13 is showing a general example of geometric similarity in model testing. 

 

Figure 2.13 - Geometric similarity in model testing (Bahrami, 2012). 

 

ii) Kinematic similarity: requires that the model and prototype have the same length 

scale ratio and the same time scale ratio; thus the velocity scale ratio will be the same for 

both. 

Length scale equivalence simply implies geometric similarity, but time scale 

equivalence may require additional dynamic considerations such as equivalence of the 

Reynolds and Mach numbers. 

 



55 
 

iii) Dynamic similarity: exists when the model and the prototype have the same length 

scale ratio, time scale ratio, and the force scale (mass scale) ratio. 

Dynamic similarity exists, simultaneously with kinematic similarity, if the model and 

prototype force and pressure coefficients are identical. This is established if:  

- For compressible flow: the model and prototype Reynolds number and Mach number 

and specific heat ratio are correspondingly equal. 

- For incompressible flow:  

With no free surface: model and prototype Reynolds numbers are equal; 

With a free surface: model and prototype Reynolds number, Froude number, and (if 

necessary) Weber number and cavitation number are correspondingly equal. 

 
2.10. Wind tunnel 

Roberts (2001) describes hydrodynamics as the study of how fluids and gases move 

around an object. He further states that the study of hydrodynamics is important in that 

fluid movements help determine the shape and function of many vehicles and building 

structures. 

Konstantin Tsiolkovsky conducted experiments in the study of fluid movement in 1892. 

He developed prototypes of wind tunnels to study and measure aerodynamic concepts. His 

contributions helped lead to the understanding of aerodynamics employed by race car 

drivers, pilots and engineers today (Fitzgerald, 2005). Although CFD have added another 

dimension in testing recently, wind tunnels are still used to familiarize and appreciate 

aerodynamic forces at work. It is essential to recognize fluid properties and changes that 

affect the accuracy throughout the test section (Husainie and Qamar, 2012). 

In general, Agriculture Engineers have used wind tunnels to study mockups and 

prototypes of animal building and food storage structures. They collect data so they can 

design a better structure. They may use a wind tunnel to study the ventilation 

characteristics of a mockup before spending money on a prototype building. They also 

investigate  the characteristics of the building, how the control surfaces react at various air 

velocity and drag characteristics. 

Wind tunnels represent a useful tool to investigate various flow phenomena (Lindgren 

and Johansson, 2002). In another words, the wind tunnel is an installation producing a 

regular and controlled air stream to determine experimentally the conditions of flow and to 

measure distribution of pressures, monitoring the temperature, and other relevant aspects of 



56 
 

the study (Gorecki, 1988). With various features provided by wind tunnels, these results 

can be classified according to the position of construction (vertical or horizontal), the type 

of camera (open or closed) and the fluid velocity (from subsonic to hypersonic). 

Concerning buildings, horizontal models are the most used, due to convenience and 

lower cost of construction. The use of an open or closed chamber will depend on the type 

of study to be performed, as well as the fluid velocity and body size needed to meet the test 

objectives (Barlow et al., 1999). 

There are two basic types of wind tunnels and two basic test-section configurations 

(Rae and Pope, 1984): 

1) Open circuit tunnel: In this type of tunnel the air follows along a straight path from 

the entrance through a contraction to the test section, followed by a diffuser, a fan section, 

and an exhaust of the air. The tunnel may have a test section with  or without solid 

boundaries, see Figure 2.14. 

 

 

Figure 2.14 - Schematic of open return tunnel (Adapted from Mueller, 1989). 

 
An open circuit tunnel has the following advantages and disadvantages (Rae and Pope, 

1984). 

a) Advantages: 

i) Construction cost is less; 

ii) If one intends to run internal combustion engines or if there is flow visualization via 

smoke, there is no purging problem if both inlet and exhaust are open to the atmosphere. 

b) Disadvantages: 

i) If located in a room, depending on the size of the tunnel to the room size, it may 

require extensive screening at the inlet to get high-quality flow. The same may be true if 



57 
 

the inlet and/or exhaust is open to the atmosphere, when wind and cold weather can affect 

operation; 

ii) For a given size and speed the tunnel will require more energy to run. This is usually 

a factor only if used for developmental testing where the tunnel has a high utilization rate; 

iii) In general, a tunnel is nosy. For larger tunnels noise may cause environmental 

problems and limits on hours of operations. 

 
Because of the low initial cost, an open circuit is often ideal for schools and universities 

where a tunnel is required for classroom work and research and high utilization is not 

required. 

 
2) Closed return wind tunnel: This tunnel has a continuous path for the air. The great 

majority of the closed circuit tunnels have a single return (Figure 2.16), although tunnels 

with both double and annular returns have been built. Again, the closed circuit tunnel may 

have either a closed or open test section, and some have been built where it can be run with 

either an open or closed test section. 

 

 

Figure 2.15 - Schematic of closed return wind tunnel (Adapted from Tatman, 2006). 

 

A closed return tunnel has the following advantages and disadvantages (Rae and Pope, 

1984). 

a) Advantages: 

i) Through the use of corner turning vanes and possibly screens, the quality of the flow 

can be easily controlled; 



58 
 

ii) Less energy is required for a given test-section size and velocity; 

iii) Less noise when operating. 

 
b) Disadvantages: 

i) Higher initial cost due to return ducts and corner vanes; 

ii) If used extensively for smoke tests or running of internal combustion engines, there 

must be a way to purge tunnel; 

iii) If tunnel has high utilization, it will be necessary to install an air exchanger or some 

other method of cooling during hot summer months. 

 
The Reynolds number is the basis for the behavior of real systems when  using reduced 

physical models (Fox and McDonald, 1998). A common example is the wind tunnel that is 

used to measure aerodynamic forces in models of wings of airplanes, automobiles, and 

buildings. Thereby, in the ideal case, the model should be tested at the same Reynolds 

number as the full-scale vehicle or building. Typically, for experimental values, the flow is 

laminar when Re &amp;lt;2100, and it is turbulent when Re &gt; 4000 (Fox and McDonald, 1998; 

Incropera and Dewitt, 2001).  

In most wind tunnels, air at atmospheric pressure is used as the fluid. The gases are 

compressible and density varies with temperature and pressure. But in many cases the 

density of air can be considered constant, to assist engineer in calculating accurate results 

(Barlow et al., 1999). 

 
2.10.1. Wind tunnel design 

Wind tunnel design is a complex field involving many fluid mechanics and engineering 

aspects and it is impossible to cover them all in just a few pages. Some books and articles 

have been written about this topic and some references are useful references when 

designing and constructing low-speed wind-tunnels (Bradshaw and Pankhurst, 1964; Rae 

and Pope, 1984). 

There are many types of wind-tunnels and they can be classified by flow speed dividing 

them into four groups (Lindgren and Johansson, 2002): a) Subsonic or low-speed wind-

tunnels; b) Transonic wind-tunnels; c) Supersonic wind-tunnels; d) Hypersonic wind-

tunnels. 



59 
 

There are special-purpose subsonic tunnels, such as spin tunnels, icing tunnels, 

meteorological tunnels, and tunnels designed for the testing of buildings. In this study, a 

subsonic tunnel was built for the evaluation of the air flow in reduced models of CBP 

barns. 

There are some large wind-tunnels used in the auto and aircraft industries. These 

tunnels have test sections that can accommodate full scale vehicles and small aircraft 

(Lindgren and Johansson, 2002). In the medium size tunnels with a test-section area around 

9.3 m2, large amounts of both research and aircraft developmental testing  is accomplished. 

In a smaller size test section, the tunnels are used for research and instructional purposes. 

The size of smaller tunnels is usually determined in the final analysis by the size of the 

room that will house the tunnel. Ideally, the size of a tunnel is determined by its purpose 

(Rae and Pope, 1984). 

 
a) Test section: 

This is the starting point in the design of a wind tunnel. The purpose of  a wind tunnel 

is to provide a uniform and controllable air flow in the test section that passes over the 

model (Rae and Pope, 1984). The test section is the chamber in which measurements and 

observations are made and its shape and size are largely determined by the testing 

requirements.  

The test section should be long enough that flow disturbances resulting from a 

contraction or screens are sufficiently damped before the reaching the test object. However, 

care should be taken not to make this section too long as this will lead to detrimental 

boundary layer growth which can separate when it enters the exit diffuser and create a 

power loss. This can be prevented by slightly enlarging the tunnel or by partially 

obstructing the exit end of the tunnel to create an overpressure which allows the use of 

small vents to control boundary layer growth (Tatman, 2006). 

 
b) Diffuser: 

Diffusers are chambers that slowly expand along their length, allowing fluid pressure to 

increase with decreasing fluid velocity. Angles slightly larger than 5 degrees do increase 

pressure recovery, but can also lead to boundary layer separation and thus flow 

unsteadiness. Exit diffusers are located downstream of the test section and are used to 



60 
 

recover pressure from kinetic motion of the fluid thereby reduced the power required to 

drive the tunnel (Tatman, 2006). 

Wide angle diffusers are located between the fan and the settling chamber and are 

necessary in order to facilitate the use of a beneficial contraction section, but the wide 

angle leads to boundary layer separation which must be controlled with the use of screens. 

 
c) Contractions sections: 

Contractions sections are located between the settling chamber and the test sections and 

serve to both increase mean velocities at the test section inlet and moderate inconsistencies 

in the uniformity of the flow. Large contraction ratios and short contraction lengths are 

generally more desirable as they reduce the power loss across the screens and the thickness 

of boundary layers. Small tunnels typically have contraction ratios between 6 and 9. 

 
d) Fan section: 

Axial fans are popular in open return tunnels, and are almost always found in closed 

return tunnels. In larger tunnels, pre-rotation vanes called stators are commonly positioned 

upstream of the fan, substantially decreasing swirl in the exit flow. Axial fans have a 

relatively limited effective operating range as the reduction it pressure increase through the 

fan as the blades approach stall speeds is far more abrupt than in centrifugal blowers. Care 

must also be given to choosing the proper blade size, shape and spacing in order to prevent 

shock wave production, stalling, and backflow (Wallis, 1983). 

Centrifugal blowers are most often in blower type open return tunnels, though they can 

be used in closed return tunnels if mounted in a corner. Centrifugal blowers have a much 

larger operating range than axial fans with acceptable levels of unsteadiness (Johnson and 

Hancock, 1997). 

 
e) Settling chamber: 

The settling chamber is located between the fan or wide angle diffuser and the 

contraction and contains the honeycombs and screens used to moderate longitudinal 

variations in the flow. Screens in the chamber should be spaced at 0.2 chamber diameters 

apart so that flow disturbed by the first screen can settle before it encounters the second 

(Tatman, 2006). Turbulence in the test section is reduced by the installation of honeycombs 

and screens upstream of the contraction.  



61 
 

Screens reduce the axial turbulence more than lateral turbulence. Screens have a 

relatively large pressure drop in the flow direction, which reduces the higher velocities 

more than the lower, and thus promote a more uniform axial velocity (Rae and Pope, 

1984). 

Honeycombs have a small pressure drops and thus have less effect on axial velocities, 

but owing to their length, they reduce the lateral velocities. The minimum length of a 

honeycomb should be 6 - 8 times the diameter of the hole (Rae and Pope, 1984).  

Both screens and honeycombs reduce lateral and axial turbulence, probably due to an 

exchange in energy along the axis as the turbulence tends toward isotropic turbulence 

downstream. 

 
2.10.2. Flow visualization 

In this field of hydrodynamics science, the flow visualization has been a nebulous 

observation simply because air is invisible. Flow visualization has led to the discovery of 

flow phenomena and has helped in the development of mathematical models for complex 

flow problems. It is also useful in the verification of existing theories, and has been an 

important tool in the development of complicated engineering systems (Mueller, 1989).  

The use of saw dust, tufts, fluorescent dye in oil with black light, and laser beam, are 

some of the methods and materials used to attempt flow visualization. The use of saw dust 

increases the difficulty of maintenance in the wind tunnel and its associated equipment. 

The tuft and oil methods show flow on the surface of the model. The laser beam has not yet 

been perfected as a usable tool for this purpose (Shindo and Brask, 1969).  

Mitchell and Ross (1977), and Ogilvie and Boyd (1984) used a water flume to visualize 

the airflow patterns in naturally ventilated barns while Aynsley et al. (1977) and Simango 

and Schulte (1983) used a neutral buoyancy bubble technique in a wind tunnel. Whatever 

the method used, the substance introduced into the tunnel should be non-corrosive, non-

toxic, and the equipment must be safe to handle. Because of their high initial costs, neither 

of these two techniques was used in this study. Rather, a simple wind tunnel with smoke 

was used to allow qualitative determination of air patterns. 

The smoke tunnel was an important research tool since 1959. The system consists of a 

low-turbulence wind tunnel, smoke-generation and injection apparatuses, and lighting and 

photographic equipment. The arrangement and use of these system components must be 

coordinated to obtain good results (Mueller, 1989).

3 - MATERIAL AND METHODS 

 

3.1. Introduction 

This chapter is divided into four main sections based upon the chronology of the 

investigation: i) Summarize compost bed data, barn dimension data and determine from 

qualitative and quantitative methods major interactive factors in the success of bed 

composting; ii) Summarize bed compost water holding capacities (WHC)  and compare 

moisture contents found with water holding capacity to determine the influence of moisture 

on bed compost; iii) Develop predictive equations for thermal properties of compost as a 

function of at various combinations of moisture content, pressure, and particle size; and iv) 

Develop 3-D CFD model of compost barn with alternate ridge designs and visually 

demonstrate effect on air flow through structure.  

 
3.2. Characterization and description of CBP barns 

3.2.1. Barn facilities measurements 

Data to realization of this study were collected from different CBP barns, distributed 

throughout the state of Kentucky - U.S. (Figure 3.1), between October 2010 to March 

2011. In this way, if a farmer described the barn as a compost bedded pack barn but the 

pack was rarely or never stirred, the barn was not included in any data analysis. Thus, 

forty-two farms participated in the study. 

 

 

Figure 3.1 - CBP barns utilized of this study in Kentucky State. 



63 
 

The barn dimensions were measured using a steel tape measure, surveyor`s tape, level 

rod, and a measuring wheel (Figure 3.2). Roof pitch was determined using a level and 

framing square placed directly on the roof. Two fiberglass ladders were used to allow 

access to roof structures and ventilation fans (Figure 3.3). Digital photography was used 

extensively to document interior and exterior structures and systems to assist in accurate 

creation of the database of barn structure, layout and ventilation details. All information 

was recorded in a notebook.

3.2.2. Environmental measurements 

Air temperature, relative humidity, and air velocity and wind direction were measured 

inside and outside of each barn. At nine locations within a barn, measurements were taken 



64 
 

in the compost pack area at two different heights (0.05 and 1.2 m) one time on the  day of 

the site visit (Figure 3.4). Air temperature and relative humidity were measured using a 

weather meter (accuracy of ±1°C; Kestrel®, model 4000, Sylvan Lake, MI, USA). Air 

velocity was measured using a hot wire anemometer (accuracy of ±0.01 m s-1; Testo®, 

model 425, Sparta, NJ, USA). The air direction was measurement with a weather vane. 

Sampling points (A1 to A9) represent the approximate center of nine grid spaces within the 

manure pack. The grids were established based on post spacing along the pack and 

generally along the center of the pack (Figure 3.5).

surface temperature was measured using two types of sensors. An infrared thermometer 

(accuracy of ± 1°C; Fluke®, model 62, Everett, WA, USA) and a compact thermal camera 

(accuracy of ± 0.1°C; Extech®, Flir i5, Waltham, MA, USA) were used (Figure 3.6). 

Bedding temperature was measured using a thermocouple-based thermometer (0.22 m 

length, accuracy of ± 2.2°C; Fluke Inc., model 87, Everett, WA, USA), see Figure 3.7.

3.2.4. Bedding moisture analysis 

Samples of pack bedding were collected from a mixture of compost of the top (0.10 m) 

in nine different locations inside the barns using plastic bags (Ziploc®, Double Zipper, 

Racine, WI, USA). Samples were collected using an iron hoe with a wooden handle and a 

soil auger (Figure 3.8). The bedding samples were cool on ice upon collection and 

refrigerated when returned to lab at 1.0 ºC.

Bedding compost moisture contents throughout this study were measured by drying at 

105°C for approximately 24 h (Figure 4.9). Moisture content (dry-basis) of bedding 

compost was defined by Equation 4.1 (Sales, 2008; Melo, 2011).

3.3. Physical, chemical, bacterial and thermal properties of compost materials 

3.3.1. Sample preparation and characteristics of materials 

Fresh compost bulking materials were collected from 42 CBP barns in Kentucky 

(Figure 3.1). The bedding compost samples were collected during farms visits between 

mid-October 2010 and early-February 2011. 

Samples of bedding compost were collected from the surface layer (0.10 m deep) in 

nine different locations in the resting area of a CBP barn (Figure 3.5).  Each location is the 

center of a rectangular area of a 3 x 3 m grid that divides the CBP resting area into 9 equal 

areas. Samples were collected using iron hoe and soil auger (Figure 3.8). A 20 liters 

container was filled with incremental quantities of bedding collected from the nine 

location. The bedding compost samples were immediately refrigerated upon return to the 

lab at 1.0 ºC, see Figure 3.10.

3.3.2. Physical properties of compost materials 

Physical analyses including particle size distribution, bulk density, particle density, 

porosity, water holding capacity were performed to characterize the compost materials. 

 

3.3.2.1. Particle size distribution 

As-received compost was allowed to air-dry for 48 hours before the determination of 

the particle size distribution (Figure 3.11a). Dried compost was poured in graduated 

volume cylinders sieved in a sieve shaker (Ro-Tap Model B, W. S. Tyler, Inc., Mentor, 



68 
 

OH, USA) with sieves vertically aligned in series in a decreasing mesh screen opening 

order: 25.00 mm, 8.00 mm, 5.60 mm, 4.75 mm, 2.00 mm and a pan of the bottom (Figure 

3.11b). Compost bedding material was sieved in the shaker for 3 minutes. The amount of 

compost retained by each screen was poured in a beaker and its weight determined.

particle size ranges. 
 

The total compost bedding sample weight (Wtotal) can be assumed as the sum of all 

sieved particle ranges plus bottom pan (Maia, 2010). So, Wtotal is given by Equation 3.2: 

 

W 	W W W W 	W 	W  (3.2) 

 

Where, Wcourse, WR2, WR3, WR4, WR5, and Wfines represent weights of course material, R2, 

R3, R4, R5 and fines (pan), respectively.  

 

Particle weight fractions for ranges 2, 3, 4, and 5 ( , , , and  

respectively) were determined by Equation 3.3: 

F

% 	 # 	 	100 (3.3) 

 

Where, WR# represents the weight for particles sizes of the three ranges.  

 

Compost weight fraction of fines on the pan, (%), were calculated as in Eq. 3.4. 

F % 	 	 	100 (3.4)

Finally, weight particle fractions were estimated as in Equation 3.5.

3.3.2.2. Bulk density, particle density, and porosity 

Compost bulk density was measured by adding 1.6 liters of air-dried compost into a 2.0 

liters graduated volume cylinder (0.05 m height and 0.20 m diameter). The container was 

filled with bedding compost material, and then the material was slightly compacted to 

ensure absence of large void spaces and, then the material was vibrated using a vibrating 

Jigsaw (Black &amp;amp; Deck, Model JS515, MD, USA) for 30 seconds (Figure 3.12). The bulk 

density can be calculated by dividing the weight of the material by the compost filled 

volume of the cylinder (Ahn et al., 2009; Sales, 2008).  

  

 

Figure 3.12 - Cylinder with compost bulking material vibrating. 

 
Compost particle density was determined by pouring 20 g of as-received compost into 

five graduated cylinders and adding a portion of 0.10 liter of methanol (90%) to each 

cylinder up to fill to the 0.10 liter mark (Figure 3.13). The remaining unused methanol 

volume represented the volume of particles in the compost filled cylinder (Sales, 2008).

3.3.2.3. Water holding capacity (WHC)  

The WHC was determined using 30 grams of the as-received compost that was 

saturated with deionized water in a beaker, stirred for 3 minutes and left to rest for 7 

minutes to absorb water. Saturated compost was poured into three Buchner funnels on top 

of Erlenmeyer flasks to drain excess water (Whatman #41 filter paper), covered with 

parafilm, and taken to an environmental chamber at 25ºC and 58% RH, where they drained 

for 12 hours (Figure 3.14). Drained compost was weighed (Wi) and dried (Ws) in a 

convection oven for 24 hours at 105ºC. The water holding capacity (g water/g dry material) 

is calculated as (Ahn et al., 2009):

3.3.3. Thermal property measurement 

Thermal properties were determined with transient heat dissipation device (KD2, 

Decagon, Pullman, WA, USA). The thermal properties, thermal conductivity (k, W/m K) 

and thermal resistivity (rho, °C cm/W), were measured for varying particle size ranges 

(0.00mm &amp;lt;Finer &amp;lt;2.00mm &amp;lt;PS2 &amp;lt;4.75 mm &amp;lt;PS3 &amp;lt;5.60 mm &amp;lt;PS4 &amp;lt;8.00 mm &amp;lt;

Coarser &amp;lt;25.00 mm), water content (30, 45 and 60%), and different static (fluffy material, 

0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 MPa) and dynamic compaction degree (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 

MPa). 

The thermal properties was measured using a handheld device. It consists of a 

handheld controller and sensors made from thin-wall stainless steel tubing with 2.4 mm 

diameter x 100 mm long (see KD2 Pro® Operator`s manual, 2008). This probe was 

inserted into the bedding compost medium.  

First, thermal conductivity and thermal resistivity were measured for all samples in 

different particle size ranges (0.00mm &amp;lt;Finer &amp;lt;2.00mm &amp;lt;PS2 &amp;lt;4.75 mm &amp;lt;PS3 &amp;lt;5.60 

mm &amp;lt;PS4 &amp;lt;8.00 mm &amp;lt;Coarser &amp;lt;25.00 mm), as described earlier (Figure 3.15). 

Wet sample of compost bulking material with different moisture content (30%, 45% 

and 60%) was produced in a concrete mixer that mixed the bedding material with the added 

water for 3 minutes (Figure 3.16a).  The desired moisture contents (30%, 45%, and 60% 

w.b.) was achieved by adding a known water amount for each particle size range’s initial 

moisture contents (Table 3.1). If the initial moisture contents was higher than the selected 

MC, a 50 g of compost was weighed and left to air dry until reaching the target MC.

Different methods used to determined particle density and the amount of water added to 

the compost to reach 30, 45, and 60% (w.b%) moisture content are described in Liberty 

(2002) and Sales (2008).  

A fluffy bedding material was weighed and the PVC cylinder (detailed cylinder 

apparatus description in the following paragraphs) was filled. The PVC cylinder was then 

vibrated using vibrating Jigsaw (Black &amp;amp; Deck, Model JS515, MD, USA) for 60 seconds 

and resulting volumes were measured (Figure 3.16b).

For study of different degrees of compaction, a mechanical pressing device was 

designed and constructed at the shop of the Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering at 

Department of the University of Kentucky. The press device was assembled and located in 

the Agricultural Air Quality Laboratory of the same Department (Figure 3.17). 

 

(a) (b) 
Figure 3.17 - Mechanical pressing device designed (a) and (b) constructed to provide 

different degrees of static and dynamic compaction. 
 

Material compaction was achieved by a mechanical pressing device that was 

developed to pack the sample down in the PVC container. The PVC cylinder had 0.27 m 

height and diameter of 0.15 m. This PVC cylinder had a series of three equally spaced 

(0.075, 0.150, and 0.225 m) holes through the entire height. Pipe flange was used to hold 

the PVC cylinder on the base frame assembly using knurled hold down knobs (see 

Appendix C - Figure 1). The compaction level inside of a PVC cylinder was adjusted using 

a valve and manometer that controlled the air pressure inside of steel cylinder chamber that 

moved the steel piston (Figure 3.18). A Moisture drain valve prevented water condensation 

in the line of air pressure. The pressures applied (0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 MPa) were 

based on studies conducted by van der Tol et al. (2003) and van der Tol et al. (2002). 

The Decagon KD2-Pro (Decagon Devices Inc.) was used to evaluate the thermal 

properties (thermal conductivity and thermal resistivity) associated with type pressure 

applied (static and dynamic pressure). This sensor uses a metal probe (0.0024 m diameter x 

0.100 m long) that heats up the material and then reads the temperature decay as the 

material dissipates the heat to calculate its thermal properties. The probe was used with the 

entire length of the needle embedded inside the compost. Measurements were made by 



75 
 

placing the sensor probe into the three holes over cylinder and recording the measurement 

after one minute, which was the recommended procedure for this sensor. Dynamic pressure 

was applied when varying the opening and closing the air in the valve control (Figure 

3.18b), during 12 times per minute. This range of moisture content (30%, 45%, and 60%) 

was selected to simulate the conditions of the bedded compost found in the field. The 

Decagon KD2-Pro sensor was calibrated by factory and performance verification standards 

were observed during this study.

3.3.4. Chemical properties of the compost bedding material 

Each compost barn pack was subdivided in three equal areas within each of the nine 

spots (Figure 3.5) from which 0.4 liters bedding sample were collected during the visiting. 

The bedding samples were collected from the surface and kept cooled upon collection at 

0°C till it was placed in a -40°C freezer and held for chemical analyses. Sub-samples were 

ground as-is before analysis for Carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), 

calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe). 

The analysis was performed at the Division of Regulatory Services at the University of 

Kentucky. The solid compost was dried in an oven at 75°C for 24 hours, ground to pass a 2 

mm screen, and stored at room temperature prior to analysis. Nitrogen (%) and Carbon (%) 

were determined via combustion. Macro nutrients (P, K, Ca, Mg) and micro nutrients (Zn,

Cu, Mn, and Fe) were extracted by digestion using a combination of HCl and H2SO4 acids. 

The digestate was assayed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrometer for concentration 

determination. The P, K, Ca, Mg and Zn are reported in a weight percent basis and Zn, Cu, 

and Fe in ppm.  

The following section summarizes information collected by a collaborator (Black, 

2012). It is included to give a more details about chemical analysis. 

 

3.3.5. Bedding bacterial of the compost bedding material 

Compost samples were collected from nine equally spaced locations throughout the 

barn described previously (Figure 3.5). Half of a cup was collected from each location, 

thoroughly mixed together, and stored in a -57°C freezer to later be thawed for analysis of 

bacterial content. The samples were sent to three different laboratories for analysis. 

University of Kentucky in Laboratory of Soil analyzed the CBP bedding and fresh bedding 

material for the following pathogens on a wet weight basis: Coliform, E. Coli, 

Staphylococcal species, Streptococcal species, and Bacillus. 

The samples were thawed in a refrigerator. Fifty cubic centimeters (cc) of bedding 

material was measured using a sterile placed into a plastic bag (Ziploc®, Johnson &amp;amp; Son, 

Racine, WI, USA). Two?hundred fifty cc of sterile distilled water was added to the bedding 

material which was mixed and allowed to stand for 10 minutes. The sample was mixed 

again, a liquid sample was removed by pipette and serial 10?fold dilutions were made in 

sterile Brain Heart Infusion broth. Sample dilutions were plated (200 ?L) on colistin 

naladixic acid (CNA) agar (BBL, Sparks, Md.), MacConkey agar (BBL, Sparks, Md.), and 

thallium sulfate?crystal violet?B toxin blood (TKT) agar medium. Colony counts were 

determined for each sample after 24 hours of incubation at 37°C. Bacterial groups were 

identified as coliforms (lactose?positive colonies on MacConkey's agar, which include 

Klebsiella by visual identification), streptococcus species (growth on TKT agar), Bacillus 

species (growth on CNA agar and gram?positive) and coagulase negative staphylococci 

(growth on the CNA agar and catalase activity). Bacteria counts are expressed as colony 

forming units (cfu) / mL of bedding sample. 

The following section summarizes information collected by a collaborator (Black, 

2012). It is included to give a more details about bacterial analysis.

3.4. Study of natural ventilation in reduced model of CBP barn 

3.4.1. Wind tunnel 

A wind tunnel was built to evaluate the effect of air flow through reduced structure 

model (1:16) of CBP barn with alternate ridge designs. The purpose of this wind tunnel 

was to provide a uniform and controllable air flow in the test section that passes over this 

reduced model. This wind tunnel was composed of an air intake, flow straightening section, 

test section, and fan section. All studies were carried out in the wind tunnel of Biosystems 

and Agricultural Engineering at Department of the University of Kentucky.  

The wind tunnel was a low speed open circuit type with dimensions of 3.25 m wide, 

8.85 m length, and a height of 3.15 m (Figure 3.19). The internal dimensions were 3.15 m x 

8.75 m x 3.05 m comprising a total volume of 84.0 m3. Concrete blocks were used on the 

base of the wind tunnel. Two by six wood boards were used to build the framing and sheets 

of plywood were installed  on the internal side of the framing members on the top, bottom 

and both of side walls. Two metal doors were used for access to internal sections of the 

wind tunnel.  

 
Figure 3.19 - Wind tunnel 3D model design is showing placements of (a) windows, (b) 

doors, (c) dampers, and (d) concrete blocks. 
 
The axial fan diameter was approximately 1.22 m and was capable of producing 2.33 

m3 s-1 of airflow at a maximum 380 rpm and against a 10.0 Pa pressure increase. The fan 

section can be easily altered to accommodate smaller fan sizes. Given the 9.60 m2 

cross?section of the wind tunnel, this allows for a maximum mean wind speed of 2.0 m s?1. 

The fan had three cambered blades, also made from sheet metal, and full power 

requirement for fan operation was 0.746 kW (1.0 hp). The fan was set in a custom welded

steel frame that was mounted on a fiber glass box. This fiber glass box was attached to a 

sheet of plywood. Thereafter sixteen metallic clamps pressure were used to hold whole 

structure (fan and fiber glass box) in the end wall (Figure 3.20). 

 

 

Figure 3.20 - View of the fan mounted on the wind tunnel. 

 
This wind tunnel was equipped with four metal dampers (1.52 m x 1.52 m) to control 

the wind speed. The dampers were assembled at air intake of the wind tunnel and were 

controlled by a handle on the outside. The room controls were located adjacent to the test 

section. The dampers were made with stainless steel and were fitted with actuators which 

has a rotation speed of 15s for 0 - 90 degree pivot. 

Turbulence in test section was dampened by the installation of a plastic honeycomb 

plates. This honeycomb plate was placed at 1.77 m down flow from the dampers to 

promote a laminar flow of air. For optimum benefit, the length of honeycomb was 6 times 

of the diameter of the hole (Rae and Pope, 1984). The honeycombs were supported by 

metal frame. This frame was made from aluminum channel  to hold and seal the edges of 

the honeycomb. The channels were secured to one another with rivets. The honeycombs 

slid snuggly into the settling chamber and were attached to the walls on each side.  

This wind tunnel had two clear viewing windows (test section) with different sizes . 

These windows were covered by 2.40 x 1.20 m and 1.10 x 1.20 m, respectively, of 

Plexiglas with 0.003 m thickness. Those windows were placed at 3.60 m and 6.65 m, 

respectively, from the upwind edge of the window. The Plexiglas windows were secured in 

the wind tunnel with screws and silicone to seal and to prevent air infiltration. Care was 

taken to drill holes through the Plexiglas for the screws to prevent cracking. Smoke was 

used to attempted to fix air infiltration problems which arose. The length of the test section 



79 
 

was chosen to be around 2.0 m to be able to get a high enough Reynolds number  (Re &amp;lt;

2100) on a flat plate for anticipated wind tunnel uses. 

Smoke was used primarily for flow visualization and photographs and videos were the 

primary method of data recording. Airflow patterns were visualized using a fog machine 

(power 1190 W, Rosco®, model 1700,  CT, USA) which vaporized Glycerin for a smoke 

source. The smoke tracer was introduced from the generator with a funnel on an end of a 

duct and allowed to entrain smoke with the air using the negative pressure of the wind 

tunnel as draw. Three light boxes, with 300 W incandescent lamps, focused light at three 

different points along the length of the wind tunnel. The bright light combined with the 

black inner surfaces allowed for photographing of air movement by both camera and 

camcorder. 

Airflow patterns were assessed using both air flow visualization and by measuring the 

airspeed along the length of the test section. Airflow visualization allowed for a qualitative 

image of the airflow patterns. 

The final step in constructing of wind tunnel was sealing air leaks using foam sealant. 

Figure 3.21 illustrates the metal dampers, plastic honeycombs, and fog machine used in the 

wind tunnel. 

Further information regarding constructions and calibration of the wind tunnel and 

others details used in this study can be seen in Lopes (2012).

3.5. Reduced model 

3.5.1. Determination of pertinent variables 

Airflow through the roof ridge opening of a building acts essentially as fluid flow 

through an orifice. The flow is governed by viscous forces, inertia forces, gravitational 

forces, buoyancy forces and geometric relationships. Heat transfer from the buildings is 

controlled by fluid flow, fluid properties and building geometry and characteristics. 

Assuming that the same phenomenon governs performance in the reduced model, a list of 

pertinent variables affecting the ventilation characteristics were compiled (Table 3.2) and 

reduced to the basic dimensions of length (L), mass (M), temperature (?), and time (T). The 

selection of pertinent variables was based on the assumptions that fluid flow is 

incompressible, the building atmosphere will be without manure gases and added moisture, 

and there will be significant internal heat source present (heat of compost pack).

According Buckingham Pi Theorem, a group of ten (14 variables minus 4 dimensions) 

independent pi terms (Table 3.3) was derived with the details of the determination shown 

in Appendix D. The relationship among the pi terms for fluid flow and heat transfer can be 

expressed as:

Thus, the function represented by equation 2.13 is: 
 

f ? ,? ,? ,? ,? ,? ,? ,? ,? ,? 0  (3.8) 
 

The terms  and  have the dependent variables necessary to predict heat transfer 

and fluid flow, respectively. According the equations 2.14 and 2.15 showed previously, can 

be determination that (Murphy, 1950; Klin, 1966; Jentzsch, 2002): 

 
? f ? ,? ,? ,? ,?   (3.9)  

? f ? ,? ,? ,? ,? ,? ,? ,?   (3.10) 
 
According Similitude theory, the equations 3.9 and 3.10 can apply to another system 

(using index M) and the function needs to use the same variables and be submitted to the 

same conditions of operation. 

 
? f ? ,? ,? ,? ,?   (3.11)  

? f ? ,? ,? ,? ,? ,? ,? ,?   (3.12) 
 

So, the prediction of equation to  and  from  and  can be calculated using 

the division of equation 3.9 by equation 3.11 and equation 3.10 by equation 3.12, 

respectively:

Equations 3.17 and 3.18 predict of the behavior of heat transfer and fluid flow, 

respectively. Those equations are valid if the criteria of the design and operation conditions 

are acceptable, as showing in Appendix D, according Murphy (1950). 

The design conditions (Table 3.3) must be met if the reduced model is to accurately 

predict conditions quantitatively in prototypes. Design conditions 1 through 5 require the 

model geometric dimensions to be 1 : n (n = 16, the geometric length scale) times the 

prototype geometric dimensions. Design condition 6 through 10 establishes the ratio of 

prototype wind velocity to model wind velocity. Using the same fluid in both the reduced 

model and prototype systems requires the model wind velocity to be n times the prototype 

wind velocity. Details about design conditions can be seen in Appendix D. 

The tests were performed with the airflow in the reduced model geometrically and 

dynamically similar to a full-scale CBP barn. To ensure that similarity of the characteristics 



83 
 

of the air flow in the reduced model and real scale CBP barn, the flow regime, expressed 

by the Reynolds number must be equal in both cases. Therefore:

where, Re is the Reynolds number (dimensionless), L is the characteristic length describing 

the geometry of the flow field (m), ? is the specific mass of the air (kg ?	 m?3); v is the 

velocity of the air (m ? s?1), and ? is the viscosity of the air (N ?	m?2 ? s?1). 

 
While the CFD simulated the real CBP barn and the reduced model, the equations 

(3.20) were used for the similarity of the air speed results. More details in Appendix D. 

 
3.5.2. Reduced model procedure 

One of the conditions of scaling is geometric uniformity which requires that all 

dimensions of the real object should be equally scaled. In this study all dimensions of the 

CBP barn were proportionally reduced with exception of the thickness of the roof. 

Reducing the thickness of the roof would result in a deformation in the shape of the roof 

and hence would change the speed and behavior of the airflow. 

The scale of the model depends on: 

a) The height and width of the test section in the wind tunnel. A model that is too large 

could block the airflow in the tunnel and would be subject to wall effects.  

b) The thickness of the boundary layer. Thereby under natural conditions the CBP barn 

is situated in the boundary layer, the reduced model should also be placed in the boundary 

layer in the wind tunnel.  

 
3.5.2.1. Experimental reduced model 

A reduced model was constructed in accordance with the design conditions and has a 

geometric length scale of 16 for testing. The five ridge vents studies (Appendix E - Figure 

1) were constructed with a 0.057 m ridge outlet corresponding to a 0.913 m opening in the 

prototype. The four wind directions investigated (North, South, East, and West) were to 

represent wind directions found in the field by rotating the model in the wind tunnel. 



84 
 

The reduced model was built using balsa wood and wood glue was used to join pieces. 

Two aluminum plates were used as the roof cover this model. This reduced model had an 

overall width of 1.20 m, length of 1.33 m, high at the ridge of 0.50 m, and the slope of the 

roof was 4:12, so that the scale factor is 1:16. The reduced model is a copy of a CBP barn 

24 (Appendix B - Figures 43 and 44) with 36 dairy cows situated in Kentucky (USA). The 

ventilation openings in the reduced model consisted of a 1.20 m wide ridge opening and 

eave openings of 0.30 m in height. The top of front wall and end wall under the gable were 

made of Plexiglas to accommodate airflow visualization. This reduced model was built on 

a wood table equipped with four wheels. The table has an opening of 0.93 m x 1.33 m and 

aluminum perforated plate was used to covered this opening. This opening was occupying 

80.9% of the floor area that represent the compost pack area. Figure 3.22 is showing the 3D 

model design used in this study. 

 

Figure 3.22 - 3D model design used in this study. Dimensions in meters (m). 

 
3.5.2.2. Heating system 

Eighteen incandescent lights of 40 W each were installed as electrical heaters under the 

perforated plate to simulate the sensible heat of microbial activity in the compost bedding. 

The maximum power flux was ? 560 W m-2 and was controlled by dimmer varying the 

intensity of the lights. Thus, it was varied to maintain the floor (compost area) at 45°C. The 

reduced model floor was maintained at a constant temperature to simulate the heat gains 

from the compost bedding in the occupied zone.  

An insulated box was built below and around the sides of the opening to promote the 

heat transmission only through the perforated plate. The perforated plate was cover with 



85 
 

aluminum sheet and 2.5 kg of sawdust was spread out over the surface. The heating system 

and the reduced model with perforated plate, that was used in this study, see Figure 3.23.

3.5.2.3. Static pressure, airspeed and temperature measurements 

Static pressure was read using two hoses connected with the static pressure sensor 

(Setra Systems Model 265, series 0811) shown in Figure 3.24, which measure static 

pressure from 0 to 62 Pa, with an advertized accuracy of 1%. One hose goes inside the 

wind tunnel, while the other goes outside the wind tunnel. In this way, the sensor could 

provide the difference in pressures from outside and inside the wind tunnel during the tests. 

The tests were run with the static pressure range 0 to 10 Pa.

Airspeed and air temperature were measured using two hot?wire anemometer (accuracy 

of ±0.01 m/s; Testo®, model 425, Sparta, NJ, USA). One sensor was placed at the 

beginning of the working section at 1.00 m height above the floor of the wind tunnel and 

another sensor was placed inside the reduced model using a non-uniform measured grid. 

This non-uniform grid ranged from 0.10 m to 1.20 m horizontally at 0.55 m intervals and 

from the floor to ceiling vertically ranged from 0.02 m to 0.20 m at 0.09 m intervals. The 

locations of the measurement positions used in the experimental analysis are illustrated in 

Figure 3.25. The hot-wire anemometer inside the building was mounted on a frame, which 

allowed the anemometer to be manually moved to each measurement position (see Figure 

3.25) once measurements at each location were complete. The values measured were 

replicated three times. The sampling period was fixed at 10 minutes per collection point. 

The experiments were carried out with two reference airspeeds: 0.1 m s–1 (low wind 

speed) and 1.0 m s–1 (high wind speed). Those airspeeds were selected based on the tunnel 

capacity and the wall opening area of the reduced model in order to achieve the desired 

Reynolds numbers (Re &amp;lt;2100) for laminar airflow around and through the model.

3.6. The CFD model 

3.6.1. CFD representation of the reduced model geometry 

In order to validate the CFD model, a 3D Rhinoceros® design of the experimental 

reduced model was developed and imported into the CFD package. The dimensions of the 

computational model were: length (Y direction) 1.35 m, width (X direction) 1.20 m, eave 

height (Z direction) 0.27 m, and the ridge height 0.48 m. The computational model had a 

total volume of 0.64 m3. With 78.1% of the total compost pack space provided for animal 

occupation and bearing in mind the minimum specification for dairy cows housing at 9.3 

m2/cow (Barberg et al., 2007; Janni et al., 2007). The effect of confined dairy cows on 

airflow was not considered in this CFD model. 

In this study, five different ridge vents were built, subdivided into: (a) Closed ridge - 

CLR, (b) Open ridge - OPR, (c) Open ridge with chimney - ORC, (d) Elevated ridge - 



88 
 

ELR, and (e) Overshot ridge - OVR. The dimensions of the ridge opening were 1.35 m in 

length and 0.057 m wide. The eave openings were also 1.35 m in length and were 0.23 m in 

height (0.31 m2). The total compost pack surface area of the building was 0.877 m2 and 

total area of the side wall openings was 0.077 m2. The modifications in ridge vents were 

adjusted in simulations that examined the influence of different types of the ridge design on 

the ventilation performance. 

The measured values obtained experimentally for an open reduced model of CBP barn 

and subjected to natural ventilation were used to assign the boundary conditions of the 

model (Figure 3.26 and Table 3.4). Two cases (shown in Table 3.4) were tested using four 

building orientation (North, South, West, and East).

3.6.2. Computational modeling 

To improve the CFD accuracy, the study exerted much effort to find the appropriate 

mesh quality and density, and optimum setting condition of wind velocity.  The mesh 

quality is very important to get accurate data and computational convergence. Thus, due to 

the geometric complexity of the reduced model of CBP barn, it was opted to utilize the 

ANSYS ICEM CFD® software for construction of a tetrahedral computational mesh which 

allows for obtaining results with fewer errors (Lee et al., 2007). This software has been 

specifically designed to fulfill the task of automatically generating high quality tetrahedral 

meshes, which are suitable for scientific computing using numerical methods such as finite 

volume methods.  

The tetrahedral volume element is very useful to maintain the high quality of the mesh 

to a region using different forms of complex geometry to be modeled in the region of 

interest. But, it requires more nodes than the mesh elements and results in a hexametrical 

file size and computational time increased (Lee et al., 2007; Katz and Sankaran, 2011). 

When the reduced model and CFD computed results were compared with each other, 

the reduced model and CFD computed airflow distribution at a cross-section plane of the 

reduced model were mainly comparable with each other.  

 
3.6.3. Boundary conditions 

The results obtained by simulation using CFD were compared with the corresponding 

data obtained experimentally in the wind tunnel. In this study, the CFD boundary condition 

was specified as the same as the wind tunnel boundary condition of test section. 

The measured values obtained experimentally in the wind tunnel were used to assign 

the boundary conditions of the model. Thus, it is necessary to provide the initial values of 

variables such as air temperature and velocity, calculate the terms of air temperature and 

velocity for each condition and solve the equations of conservation of energy, mass and 

momentum 

Air flow rates are associated with turbulent flows and, combined with heat transfer 

rates, generate a complex system of coupled equations difficult to resolve. Therefore, the 

CFD technique was utilized to solve the average Navier-Stokes and energy equations, 

determining velocity, temperature and pressure by the finite volumes technique. The model 

for non-isothermal fluid flow is described by equation of mass, continuity, energy and 

species, simplified as follows (Kin et al., 2008).

The Reynolds tensor was modeled using standard k-? model, which evaluates viscosity 

(??) from the ratio between turbulent kinetic energy (k) and dissipation of the turbulent 

kinetic energy (?). The ANSYS CFX® software belongs to the Department of Agricultural 

and Environmental Engineering of the Federal University of Viçosa, and was employed to 

program and simulate the proposed method. The following considerations were assumed: 

(a) steady state, (b) incompressible flow, and (c) turbulent flow. 

Two computational meshes were generated with different refinement levels using the 

CFX Mesh computational program, with the objective of verifying effect of refinement on 

local concentration gradients at the spatial levels. 

 
3.6.4. Statistical analysis methods 

a) Barns measurements, compost management practices, and herd characteristics 

Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles) 

were used to describe individual barn measurements, compost management practices, and 

herd characteristics (Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA).

c) Thermal properties as a function of particle size, moisture content, and compaction 

degree 

Statistical calculations were performed using Sisvar 4.6 (Ferreira, 2003) which is 

developed by the Federal University of Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Average values for 

thermal properties in each particle size, moisture content, and compaction degree ranges 

were generally used for statistical analyses by ANOVA. For each ANOVA, a particle size, 

moisture content, and compaction degree ranges consisted of a treatment. Differences 

between groups were tested by Tukey`s test at significance levels of 5%. 

 
d) Validation of the computational model 

The statistical parameter used to evaluate measured (reduced model) versus simulated 

(CFD model) air velocity and temperature were coefficient of determination (r2) and 

Student's t-test. The r2 values indicate how consistently measured versus predicted values 

follow a best fit line and can range from zero (no correlation) to 1.0 (perfect correlation). 

The data were evaluated in the computer software SigmaPlot®, version 11.0, Systat 

Software®, Inc (Wass, 2009) for statistical analysis and data representation. The p-value 

was fixed at 5% (? &amp;lt;0.05).

4.2. Characterization and description of CBP barns 

4.2.1. Barn structure and layout 

The compost dairy barn measurement and layout information collected included: barn 

and pack dimensions, feed alley dimensions, waterer location and size, fan and light 

description, stock density, sidewall height, as well as other barn specifications. General 

barn characteristics for 42 CBP in Kentucky are shown in Appendix A (Table A.1).  

Type and orientation of ridge, roof structure and type, roof pitch are showing in 

Appendix A (Table A.2). 

Ventilation system, cooling fan number, power, size, number of luminaries, and 

illumination type are listed in Appendix A (Table A.3). 

In general, the first CBP barn was constructed in Kentucky in 2002 and the CBP barn 

number has increased to 58 by the end of 2010. The type of barn construction varied, 

including barn dimensions, type of ridge, ridge orientation, ventilation system, etc.  

CBP barns are a low capital-cost alternative to freestall barns. However, the lower 

initial investment for bedded-pack barns may be offset by higher annual operating costs. 



93 
 

Barn building costs ranged from $8.000,00 to $400.000,00. Barberg et al. (2007) reported 

that the building costs ranged widely depending on the amount of on-farm labor utilized 

and amenities added.  

Barn ventilation rates are influenced building dimensions, orientation of ridge, sidewall 

opening, eave opening, ridge opening, and wind speed. The average compost bedding pack 

barn dimensions and were 49.1 m (length) and 21.9 m (width). The most frequent barn 

length was between 25 to 50 m (45.2%), 33.3% was between 50 to 75 m, 11.9% was higher 

than 75 m, and 9.5% was less than 15 m. The most of frequent barn width was between 15 

to 30 m (61.9%), 19.0% was less than 15 m, 16.7% was 30 to 45 m, 2.4% was higher than 

75 m. The majority of compost bedded pack barn had areas between 500 to 1000 m 

(33.3%). The frequency distribution of compost bedding pack barn area is illustrated in 

Figure 4.1. 

 

 

Figure 4.1 - The frequency distribution of compost bedding pack barns area. 

 
Majority of these barns had feed alleys and driveways. Only 26.2% of the barns, the 

cows had free access to pasture, 9.5% was equipped with cow brush. A feed store and 

anaerobic lagoon was present around these barns in 52.3%. Headlocks was found in 19% of 

the CBP barns. 



94 
 

Cow water intake has a critical effect on her milk productivity and reproductive 

performance since it regulates dry matter intake. A cow must have access to water when 

needed to satisfy this need. Only 19.0% meet recommendations of 0.10 to 0.15 m per cow 

(McFarland et al., 2007). In addition, cows did not have access to water at the barn in 24% 

of the compost bedded pack barns. Cows in over 76.0% of the barns were critically short of 

waterer space which would limit their milk production. 

The recommended feedbunk (stock density) space per cow is 0.03 to 0.06 m / cow 

(Smith and Harner, 2001). It was found that 29% of the compost bedded pack barns met 

this recommendation with an additional 12% exceeding it. Only 31% of the compost 

bedded pack barns had no feedbunks, although most of these had concrete alleyways 

leading to nearby feedbunks. Inadequate bunk space was found at 25% of the compost 

bedded pack barns. Overstocking at the feed bunk increases competition among cows and 

may limit milk production. 

Barn orientation will determine the intensity of solar radiation falling on the walls, 

bedded and feed alley, and roof of the building. Barns oriented are generally an E-W 

orientation in Kentucky, though the recommended orientation is site-specific based upon 

natural wind flows. The typical prevailing winds in Kentucky come from the SW in the 

summer and from the NW in the winter which would suggest the East-West ridge 

orientation as the most effective. The frequency distribution of ridge orientation is listed in 

Figure 4.2. Results show that the most frequent orientation is NE-SW (50.0%) with the 

next highest being NW-SE (45.2%). 

The vertical separation between the eave and ridge openings has a significant impact on 

the pressure differences generated by the chimney effect (Chastain, 2000). Therefore, the 

roof slope is an important consideration in the design of a naturally ventilated building. All 

barns with a gable design are best ventilated with a roof pitch of 3:12 or 4:12 (Smith and 

Harner, 2001). There are 42 measurements since 2 barns were found to have different 

pitches on each side of the ridge and 2 barns were using hoop structure. Most of barns had 

roof pitch of 4:12 (54.8%) and 14.3% had roof pitch of 3:12. Barns with roof pitches higher 

than 4:12 or lower than 3:12 (MWPS-7, 2000), can limit the natural ventilation rate per 

cow.

Figure 4.2 - Frequency distribution of ridge orientation. 

 
Sidewall opening height and eave height are provided to protect the cows from sun, 

rain, and wind, thus helping to maintain proper ventilation and animal comfort. A 3.5m 

sidewall opening is recommended for barns less than 12.2 m wide while a 4.2 m opening 

height is recommended for barns wider than 12.2 m (Graves and Brugger, 1994). 

Frequency distribution of sidewall opening height and eave height for the barns in this 

study are presented in Figure 4.3. Results show that the most frequent sidewall height is 

between 2.0 to 4.0 m (66.7%). In 66.7% of barns, the eave height had more than 4.0 m. 

Some of these barns had low walls on outside perimeter to contain the compost and would 

reduce the effectiveness of the measured eave height. 

A proper eave overhang minimizes the entry of sun, snow, and rain through open 

sidewalls. Gay (2009) recommend eave overhang with 1/3 of the sidewall height. Majority 

of barns (54.8%) had eave overhand less than 1.0 m. In 35.7% of barns had eave overhang 

between 1.0 m and 2.0 m and only 9.5% of barns had eave overhang with 2.0 m or more. 

Figure 4.4 is showing the frequency distribution of eave overhang.

Ridge design affects air movement by removing warm/hot moist air that collects under 

the roof. The design of the ridge can help or inhibit barn ventilation depending on the wind 

velocity and direction relative to the ridge line. Characteristics of the CBP barn ridge are 

showed in Figure 4.5. The primary types of barn ridge found in the compost bedded pack 

barn study were overshot ridges (59%), open ridge with cover (19%), capped ridge (12%), 

open ridge without cover (5%), and hoop structure (5%). 



97 
 

 

Figure 4.5 - Frequency distribution of the CBP barn ridge in Kentucky. 

 
The width of the continuous ridge opening controls air exhausting from the barn. As the 

width of a barn increases, the ridge opening should also increase. Figure 4.6 summarizes 

the ratio of ridge opening to barn width on the compost bedded pack barns visited in 

Kentucky. Figure 4.6 notes the present recommended ridge opening width of 0.07 m / 3.05 

m of barn width with a minimum width requirement of 0.30 m for barns of less than 12.20 

m width. There are two ridge opening values shown in Figure 4.6: a) apparent ridge 

opening (0.02 meters / 3.05 meters of building width) and b) effective ridge opening (0.02 

meters / 3.05 meters of building width). The apparent opening is the ridge opening width as 

seen from inside the barn. The effective opening is the smallest width through which air 

flows to the outside of the barn at the ridge. 

Figure 4.6 indicates the compost barn ridge measurements as a ratio of the ridge 

opening to barn width (meters / 3.05 meters). There were 17% of the barns with no ridge 

opening. Based on the apparent ridge opening, 18% had inadequate ridge opening (&amp;lt;2.5 

0.02 meters / 3.05 meters), while 17% had marginal ridge openings (2.5 to &amp;lt;0.07 meters / 

3.05 meters), and 48% equaled or exceeded the recommended ridge opening. However, 

based on the effective ridge opening, 53% had inadequate ridge opening, while 20% had 

marginal ridge openings, and only 11% equaled or exceeded the recommended ridge 

opening. The large majority of barns had ridge opening restrictions that could cause 

inadequate natural ventilation that can significantly affect cows, particularly under heat 

stress conditions.

The majority of compost bedded pack barns were equipped with box fans (42.8%) for 

circulation, 30.9% using natural ventilation, 23.8% using High Volume Low Speed Fans 

(HVLS) for circulation, and 2.5% Tunnel ventilation (hoop structures). Buildings that will 

use tunnel ventilation require more elaborate ridge openings with some type of closure 

system. In this case, it is recommended to consult a competent designer (Agricultural 

Engineer) who has experience with cattle shelter ventilation for special situations. Most of 

HVLS fans used had diameter of 7.32 m. The average diameter of box fans was 0.98 m, 

ranged from 0.46 m to 1.32 m. 



99 
 

Lighting in compost bedded pack barns was noted at each dairy visited. It was found 

that 41% of compost bedded pack barns didn't have lights. High Intensity Discharge (HID) 

was the most frequent form of light producers used. This was followed by Fluorescent 

(14%), Compact fluorescent (12%), and Incandescent (10%). Total lighting wattage is also 

noted. The light average power used in a barn was 124 W, ranged from 13  to 192 W. 

 
4.2.2. Description of structure and layout in each barn 

Barn 1 was built in October 2010 and cost $60,000 (Appendix A - Table A.1). The 

dimensions of the barn were 51.2 m x 15.2 m, and a 1.48 m high wood sidewall 

surrounding the pack. Waterers was outside of the pack area and the dimensions were 2.4 

m  x 0.8 m. Sidewall was built using seven wood board of 0.05 m x 0.20 m and sidewall 

opening of 3.4 m. The feed alley was away from this barn, and the animals were feed in 

separate of the building. There were no headlocks, see Figure 4.7. Geographic position of 

the Barn 1 were 37° 13' 53'' N of latitude and 86° 20' 20'' W of longitude (Appendix A - 

Table A.2) and ridge orientation of 249° East (E). Wood structure was used to build this 

barn and metal roof was used to covered. The eave height was 4.87 m and eave overhang 

was 1.22 m. The ridge type used was open ridge with cover. Roof pitch measured was 4:12 

and ridge cap had dimensions of 0.51 m x 0.51 m, height of 0.51 m and ridge opening of 

0.38 m. Drawings about Barn 1 can be seen in Appendix B (Figures 1 and 2). Forced 

ventilation system was used with eight box fans (Appendix A - Table A.3). Lamps and cow 

brush were not present this barn. One anaerobic lagoon was used close to the barn.

Figure 4.7 - The main constructive characteristic of CBP barn 1. 
 

Barn 2 was built in March 2008 and cost was $80,000 and including fans was 

$110,000. The dimensions of the barn were 76.3 m x 30.3 m, see Appendix A (Table A.1).

Concrete wall with 0.6 meter high was used around of the perimeter of the barn 2 and wire 

cables were above the wall to prevent cows from falling or jumping out of this building 

(Figure 4.8). The feed alley and waterers were in other building, away from barn 2, but the 

animals had free access. This barn had sidewall opening of 3.48 m. Waterers was located 

along the feed alley. There were no headlocks. A drive-by feed manager was located in

4.2.3. Compost bedding pack management 

The highest percentage (45.2%) of barns are bedded with kiln dried wood shavings or 

sawdust, followed by the green sawdust (42.9%) and the blend of both materials (11.9%). 

Fine, dry wood shavings or sawdust is the ideal material for bedding (Endres, 2009). Most 

of the barns in Kentucky had their compost tilled and aerated to a depth of 0.11 to 0.23 m 

twice a day in the summer and winter time, while cows were at the milking parlor. The 

most often used stirring tool was a chisel plow on a small tractor.   

A large number of farmers cleaned out the pack entirely once a year. In this case, a load 

of clean material (shavings or sawdust) was added after removal of the used bedding to a 

depth 0.30 m in order to start the new pack. Typically, a load of fresh material was added 

every one to five weeks, varying by season, weather conditions, barn size, and cow density. 

Some farmers left about 0.15 m of old material in barn to help initiate microbial activity. 

There were a small number of dairies adding a thin layer of fresh bedding when the bedded 

pack became moist enough for it to stick to the cows body after they rise from lying down 

on the bedded pack. 

The average pack dimensions for the 42 compost barns we studied were 47.7 m (±19.1) 

and 16.1 m (±5.9). The average stock density in this study was 8.9 m2 per cow, ranging 

from 0.8 to 25.8 m2 per cow. The suggested minimum space per cow in these building is 

7.4 m2 per cow (Janni et al., 2007). According to Endres (2009), some producers in 

Minnesota provided 9.4 m2 per cow.  

Temperatures of bedding compost tended to be lower on barns 16, 22, 23, 24, 29, 35, 

36, and 38 which utilized green sawdust rather than kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust 

for bedding (t test, P &gt; 0.05). The temperatures were greater in the areas of the pack that 

were fluffier, that were not heavily soiled or packed by the cows. This observation is 

consistent with the need for oxygen for microbial activity that promotes composting. 

Average bedding moisture content in the top (20 cm) was 59.0% (± 9.0) wet basis 

ranged from 36.2 to 71.8%. Details can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.4). Moisture 

content between 40.0% and 65.0% is generally recommended for composting most 

materials (NRAES-54, 1992). Excessive moisture addition needs to be avoided. The 

moisture content can vary owing to the addition of fresh bedding, weather, and cow density 

in the sampling area (Barbeg et al.. 2007). More details about compost bedding pack 

management in each barn can be seen below.

4.2.3.1. Management practices in each barn 

Barn 1 was bedded with green sawdust (Figure 4.46a). The pack was aerated twice a 

day in the summer and the winter time using a chisel plow (Figure 4.46b), while the cows 

were milked. The pack was aerated to a depth of 0.28 m, which is the recommended depth 

of 0.25 to 0.30 m (Janni et al., 2007). This barn was not cleaned out during the year, the 

pack had dimensions of 41.5 m x 15.3 m. The stock density was 10.0 m2 per cow 

(Appendix A - Table A.1). 

The average bedding temperatures at surface and 0.10 m and 0.20 m depths were 

17.1°C (±1.3), 31.9°C (±10.2), and 35.2°C (±9.4), respectively. Paired t-test statistical 

analysis indicated that the averages for the two depths were different (P &amp;lt;0.05). Details 

can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.4). 

The average bedding moisture was 44.5% (±8.0). The minimum bedding moisture was 

30.7% and the maximum was 56.7% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and third 

quartiles were 40.4% and 49.8%, respectively.  

 

(a) (b) 
Figure 4.46 - Green sawdust (a) and (b) chisel plow used to aeration used in barn 1. 

 
Barn 2 was using green sawdust to bed the pack (Figure 4.47a). This barn used a chisel 

plow on a small tractor (Figure 4.47b) to till the pack twice a day in the summer and the 

winter time, while the cows were milked. The pack was aerated to a depth of 0.40 m. The 

pack dimensions were 53.4 m x 30.3 m and the stock density was 9.3 m2 per cow 

(Appendix A - Table A.1). This barn was cleaned out once a year.  

The average of the pack temperature in the depth 0.1 m [41.5°C (±10.6)] was less than 

the average of the depth 0.2 m [53.4°C (±4.6)], as can been see in Appendix A (Table A.4). 



131 
 

Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that at the 0.05 significance level, the averages for 

the two depths were different. The surface pack temperature measured was 16.5°C (±3.6).  

The average bedding moisture was 49.0% (±7.3), ranging from 38.3% to 61.5% 

(Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and third quartiles were 45.7% and 52.0%, 

respectively. The moisture content in the bedding compost varied upon time since last 

addition of fresh bedding, weather, and stock density in the sampling area.

Figure 4.47 - Green sawdust (a) and (b) the chisel plow used in barn 2. 

 
Barn 3 was bedded with kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust. According Changirath et 

al. (2011), the cows prefer lying on drier and loose bedding (Figure 4.48). The bedded pack 

was stirred twice a day in the summer and winter time, while the cows were being milked. 

Moreover, a small tractor was pulling a chisel plow to promote the aeration. The bedding 

compost was removed from this barn three a year and spread directly in the fields when 

necessary. The pack area had dimensions of 87.8 m x 12.2 m and the stock density was 7.4 

m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). This barn was cleaned out three times per year.  

Averages bedding temperatures at surface, 0.1 m and 0.2 m depths were 16.3°C (±3.8), 

36.2°C (±9.5), and 52.1°C (±4.6), respectively (Appendix A - Table A.4). Paired t-test 

statistical analysis indicated that the averages for the two depths were different (P &amp;lt;0.05).  

The average bedding moisture was 49.1% (±5.8), which is the moisture content, needed 

for composting (NRAES-54, 1992). The minimum and maximum bedding moisture was 

between 43.4% and 58.7%. The first and third quartiles were 46.1% and 54.1%, 

respectively. Details about bedding moisture content as seen in Appendix A (Table A.5).

Barn 4 was bedded with mix material (sawdust mixed with other material as available). 

Tilling was performed once a day in the summer and winter time, using a chisel plow with 

0.45 m shovels (Figure 4.49a). The chisel plow tills to a depth of 0.25 m – 0.38 m. This 

keeps the bedded pack fairly loose, well aerated, and the surface dry. In fact, this bedded 

pack was the driest at surface to 0.25 m depth. During cultivation water vapor was visible, 

indicating a higher temperature of the compost in comparison to the air (Figure 4.49b). 

This barn was not cleaned out during the year. The pack dimensions were 51.5 m x 9.2 m 

and the stock density (5.1 m2 per cow). Details can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.1). 

The average surface temperature measured was 15.5°C (±3.5). The average of the pack 

temperature in the depth 0.1 m and 0.2 m were 41.1°C (±18.7) and 52.4°C (±7.6), 

respectively (Appendix A - Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that these 

two averages were not different (P &amp;lt;0.05). 

The average bedding moisture was 36.2% (±6.3). as can be seen in Appendix A (Table 

A.5). The minimum bedding moisture was 27.8% and the maximum was 44.9%. The first 

and third quartiles were 30.5% and 40.0%, respectively.

Barn 5 was using kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust in the pack (Figure 4.50). This 

bedding material has been widely used in compost dairy barn throughout Minnesota with 

different success (Barberg et al., 2007; Janni et al., 2007; Janni et al., 2005).  Aeration was 

performed once a day in the summer time and three times a day in the winter time, using a 

tractor to pull a chisel plow. The pack was aerated to a depth of 0.23 m. The pack 

dimensions were 42.7 m x 10.7 m. This barn was cleaned out twice a year. The stock 

density (5.3 m2 per cow) was less than suggested minimum (7.4 m2 per cow) by Janni et al. 

(2007). Details can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.1). 

The average bedding temperatures at surface and two depths (0.1 m and 0.2 m) were 

22.2°C (±1.3), 26.0°C (±6.1), and 27.2°C (±6.6), respectively, as can been see in Appendix 

A (Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that the averages for the two 

depths were not different (P &amp;lt;0.05).  

The average bedding moisture was 52.2% (±5.6). The minimum bedding moisture was 

43.7% and the maximum was 61.7%. The first and third quartiles were 47.5% and 55.2%, 

respectively. More details about moisture content of bedding see Appendix A (Table A.5).

Figure 4.50 - Barn 5 was using kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust in the pack. 

 
Barn 6 was bedded with kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust (Figure 4.51a). The 

loosest and driest compost was found in this barn with a fluffy consistency. The pack was 

aerated once a day in the summer time and twice a day in the winter time, while the cows 

were milked, using rotary tiller on a tractor (Figure 4.51b). This barn was not cleaned out. 

The bedded pack had dimensions of 24.4 m x 12.2 m and the stock density was 4.0 m2 per 

cow. Details can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.1).  



134 
 

The surface pack temperature measured was 16.2°C (±3.1). The average of the pack 

temperature in the depth 0.1 m [34.5°C (±15.0)] was high than the average of the depth 0.2 

m [34.0°C (±10.1)], as can been see in Appendix A (Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical 

analysis indicated that these two averages were not different (P &amp;lt;0.05).  

The average bedding moisture was 39.6% (±9.6), which is less than recommended by 

NRAES-54 (1992). The minimum and maximum bedding moisture was between 22.9% 

and 51.8%. The first and third quartiles were 32.0% and 47.1%, respectively. Details about 

bedding moisture content can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.5).

Barn 7 was bedded with kiln dried wood shavings. The pack was mixed twice a day in 

the summer and winter time, using a rotary tiller (Figure 4.52). This barn was cleaned out 

once a year and the pack was aerated to a depth of 0.20 m. This barn had pack dimensions 

of 36.6 m x 12.5 m and the stock density was 11.7 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). 

The average bedding temperatures at surface and two depths (0.1 m and 0.2 m) were 

13.3°C (±4.7), 38.3°C (±6.0), and 42.2°C (±8.6), respectively (Appendix A - Table A.4). 

Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that the averages for the two depths were not 

different (P &amp;lt;0.05).  

The average bedding moisture was 46.0% (±3.2). The minimum bedding moisture was 

40.8% and the maximum was 49.7% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and third 

quartiles were 44.4% and 48.9%, respectively.

Barn 8 was bedded using kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust. This barn was not 

cleaned out a year. The pack was aerated once a day in the summer and winter time using a 

chisel plow (Figure 4.53). The pack was aerated to a depth of 0.25 m. The compost 

appeared relatively wet and did stick to the boots when walking on the surface and small 

lumps of bedding pack material did not smell when broken and rubbed against the palms of 

our hands. According Klaas et al. (2010), this process can indicate absence of anaerobic 

processes. The pack dimensions were 65.9 m x 7.9 m and the stock density was 11.0 m2 per 

cow. Details can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.1). 

Average bedding temperatures at surface and two depths (0.1 m and 0.2 m) were 

17.8°C (±4.1).  24.1°C (±4.8), and 24.4°C (±3.5), respectively (Appendix A - Table A.4). 

Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that the averages for the two depths were not 

different (P &amp;lt;0.05).  

The average bedding moisture was 61.6% (±2.5). The minimum bedding moisture was 

58.2% and the maximum was 65.9% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and third 

quartiles were 59.5% and 63.5%, respectively.

Barn 9 was using sawdust mixed with other material as available. The pack was aerated 

once a day in the summer time and twice a day in the winter time. A tractor was aerating 

the pack using a rotary tiller and a chisel plow (Figure 4.54). This barn was cleaned out 

once a year. The compost pack appeared to be compacted and chunks were seen after 

stirring. Compaction is expected to reduce aeration and microbial activity compared to the 

fluffy loose packs (Janni et al., 2007). The pack dimensions were 76.3 m x 18.5 m and the 

stock density was 13.5 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). 

The surface pack temperature measured was 22.3°C (±11.7). The average of the pack 

temperature in the depth 0.1 m [38.6°C (±13.2)] was less than the average of the depth 0.2 

m [42.5°C (±14.8)], as can been see in Appendix A (Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical 

analysis indicated that these two averages were different (P &amp;lt;0.05). 

The average bedding moisture was 41.9% (±6.6). The minimum bedding moisture was 

33.6% and the maximum was 53.9% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and third 

quartiles were 37.5% and 45.7%, respectively.

Figure 4.54 – Barn 9 was aerated using a chisel plow. 

 
Barn 10 was bedded with kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust (Figure 4.55a). The 

bedded pack was stirred twice a day in the summer and winter time, using a chisel plow 

(Figure 4.55b), while the cows were being milked. The stirring mixes manure and urine on 

the surface into the bedded pack to provide a fresh surface for cows to lie down on the pack 

after milked (Janni et al., 2007). This barn was cleaned out twice a year. The pack 

dimensions were 61.0 m x 30.5 m. Approximately 184 cows were kept in the bedded pack 

that provided a stock density of 10.1 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). 



137 
 

The averages bedding temperatures at surface and 0.1 m and 0.2 m depths were 17.3°C 

(±5.6), 35.6°C (±8.6), and 41.4°C (±11.4), respectively. Paired t-test statistical analysis 

indicated that the averages for the two depths were different (P &amp;lt;0.05). Details can be seen 

in Appendix A (Table A.4). 

The average bedding moisture was 51.7% (±7.3). The minimum and maximum bedding 

moisture was between 38.3% and 64.0%, respectively. The first and third quartiles were 

48.7% and 54.5%, respectively. The average moisture content of bedding in Barn 10 is 

given in Appendix A (Table A.5).

Figure 4.55 - Barn 10 was aerated using a chisel plow. 

 
Barns 11 and 12 were bedded using sawdust mixed with other material as available. 

The wet compost was found in these barns, with mainly slurry consistency and did stick to 

the boots when walking on the surface. The bedding materials were aerated to a depth of 

0.23 m, once a day in the summer and winter time while cows are being milked. A tractor 

was pulling a chisel plow to promote the aeration (Figure 4.56). The bedded packs had the 

same dimensions in both barns of 91.5 m x 15.3 m and the stock density were 9.3 m2 per 

cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). These barns were cleaned out twice a year. 

The average surface temperature measured in CBP barns 11 and 12 were 15.2°C (±2.5) 

and 18.5°C (±12.5), respectively (Appendix A - Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical analysis 

indicated that there were not significant (P &amp;lt;0.05) differences in average temperatures for 

the two depths in Barn 11, but there were significant (P &amp;lt;0.05) differences in average 

temperatures for the two depths in Barn 12.  

The average bedding moisture in Barns 11 and 12 were 61.2% (±2.4) and 60.4% (±2.8), 

respectively. Details can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.5).

Barns 13 and 14 were bedded using kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust (Figure 

4.57a). The compost packs were aerated twice a day in the summer and winter time, using 

rotary tiller (Figure 4.57b). Water vapor was visible during aeration, indicating a higher 

temperature of the compost in comparison to the air. These barns were not cleaned out 

during the year. These barns had the same pack dimensions of 61.0 m x 13.7 m and the 

same stock density of 8.8 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). 

The average surface temperatures measured in Barns 13 and 14 were 11.7°C (±5.3) and 

8.9°C (±1.6), respectively. Details about bedding temperature can be seen in Appendix A 

(Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that in both barns the averages 

temperatures for the two depths of were not different (P &amp;lt;0.05). 

The average bedding moisture in Barn 13 was less [36.2% (±6.3)] than Barn 14 [57.3% 

(±4.3)], ranged from 50.6% to 63.4% in Barn 13 and ranged from 49.8% to 64.0% in Barn 

14 (Appendix A - Table A.5).

Barn 15 was bedded using kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust (Figure 4.58). The 

compost pack was aerated twice a day (summer and winter time), using chisel plow. The 

bedding materials were aerated to a depth of 0.18 m. The bedding compost was cleaned out 

once a year and the bedding compost was spread directly in the fields when necessary. This 

bedding compost was appearing with fluffy consistency. The pack had dimensions of 18.3 

m x 18.3 m and the stock density was 9.3 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1).  

The average surface temperature measured was 17.2°C (±10.2). The average bedding 

temperatures across 0.1 m and 0.2 m depths were 52.3°C (±7.5) and 58.0°C (±10.3), 

respectively. Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that these two averages were 

different (P &amp;lt;0.05). Temperature is directly proportional to the biological activity within 

the composting bedded-pack. Maintaining a temperature of 52°C or more for 3 to 4 days 

favors the destruction of fly larvae and keeping the pack surface dry (Janni et al., 2005). 

Average bedding moisture was 54.7% (±2.7), ranging from 51.0 to 58.6% (Appendix A 

- Table A.5). The first and third quartiles were 53.0% and 56.2%, respectively.

Barn 16 was bedded with green sawdust. The wet compost was found in this barn, with 

mainly slurry consistency. The pack was aerated once a day in the summer and winter time. 

A tractor was pushing a chisel plow (Figure 4.59).  The bedding materials were aerated to a 

depth of 0.20 m, which is less than minimum recommended depth of 0.25 m to 0.30 m 

(Janni et al., 2007). This barn was cleaned out twice a year. The pack had dimensions of 

14.6 m x 10.1 m and the stock density was 7.7 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A1).   

The average bedding temperatures at surface and 0.1 m and 0.2 m depths were 8.9°C 

(±2.9), 23.5°C (±12.6), and 32.1°C (±7.2), respectively. Paired t-test statistical analysis 



140 
 

indicated that at the 0.05 significance level, the averages for the two depths were not 

different (Appendix A - Table A.4).  

The average bedding moisture was 66.5% (±2.2), which is high than the recommended 

for composting of 45% to 60% moisture (NRAES-54, 1992). The minimum bedding 

moisture was 64.3% and the maximum was 70.6% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and 

third quartiles were 64.6% and 67.1%, respectively.

Barn 17 was bedded using kiln dried wood shavings. This barn was cleaned out once a 

year. The pack was aerated twice a day (summer and winter time), using a chisel plow 

(Figure 4.60), and the pack was aerated to a depth of 0.30 m. The compost appeared 

relatively wet and dried fine material was spread out on top of the compost, however, it still 

sticks to the boots, when one was walking on the surface. The pack had dimensions of 37.8 

m x 13.7 m and the stock density was 4.3 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). 

The average bedding temperatures at surface and 0.1 m and 0.2 m depths were 11.7°C 

(±5.0), 37.4°C (±16.6), and 36.6°C (±17.0), respectively (Appendix A - Table A.4). Paired 

t-test statistical analysis indicated that the averages for the two depths were not different (P 

&amp;lt;0.05).  

The average bedding moisture was 56.0% (±4.3), ranged from 50.2% to 62.4% 

(Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and third quartiles were 52.7% and 59.1%, 

respectively.

Barn 18 was using kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust. This package was very wet, 

when walking atop it, the boots were sunk in up to ankles in some spots (Figure 4.61a). The 

bedding material was aerated twice a day in the summer and winter time, using chisel plow 

(Figure 4.61b) while cows are being milked. The bedded pack had dimensions of 61.0 m x 

24.4 m and the stock density was 12.9 m2 per cow. This value is high than suggested 

minimum (7.4 m2 per cow) by Janni et al. (2007). Compost barns will not perform well if 

the cows are overcrowded. Details can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.1). 

The average surface temperature measured was -5.1°C (±3.5). The average of the pack 

temperature in the depth 0.1 m and 0.2 m were 12.3°C (±9.7) and 20.9°C (±10.9), 

respectively (Appendix A - Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that the 

averages for the two depths were different (P &amp;lt;0.05). An anaerobic pack shows lower 

temperatures which leads to reduced pathogen kill and odor problems (Graves, 1999). 

The average bedding moisture was 64.8% (±0.8), which was above NRAES-54 (1992) 

recommended level of 50% to 60%. When moisture is too high, the pack becomes 

anaerobic (lack of oxygen), rate of microbial decomposition will slow, and the composting 

will again be too slow (Bewley and Taraba, 2009). The minimum bedding moisture was 

63.5% and the maximum was 66.0%. The first and third quartiles were 64.2% and 65.6%, 

respectively (Appendix A - Table A.5).

Figure 4.61 - Barn 18 was aerated using chisel plow. 

 
Barn 19 was bedded with Kiln dried wood shavings. This barn was aerated twice a day, 

using chisel plow and rotary tiller on a tractor. During cultivation water vapor was visible, 

indicating a higher temperature of the compost in comparison to the air (Figure 4.62). The 

pack was cleaned out twice a year and had dimensions of 11.6 m x 14.0 m. The stock 

density was 6.7 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). 

The pack surface temperatures [-0.9°C (±3.8)]. The average bedding temperature 

measured at 0.1 m depth [39.7°C (±5.6)] was less than average bedding temperatures 

measured at 0.2 m depth [52.8°C (±3.2)]. Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that the 

averages for the two depths were different (P &amp;lt;0.05).  The average temperature of bedding 

in this barn is given in Appendix A (Table A.4). 

The average bedding moisture was 68.4% (±1.9), as can be seen in Appendix A (Table 

A.5). The minimum bedding moisture was 64.5% and the maximum was 71.0%. The first 

and third quartiles were 68.0% and 69.5%, respectively. A wet bedded pack is more 

vulnerable to compaction.

Barn 20 was bedded with kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust (Figure 4.63). New fresh 

and dried fine material was spread out on top of the compost once a day. The pack was 

aerated once a day. A tractor was used to pull a chisel plow. The bedding materials were 

aerated to a depth of 0.18 m. This barn was cleaned out twice a year. The pack dimensions 

were 22.0 m x 12.0 m and the stock density was 5.3 m2 / cow (Appendix A - Table A.1).  

The averages bedding temperatures at surface and 0.1 m and 0.2 m depths were 23.7°C 

(±1.2), 44.0°C (±12.4), and 45.0°C (±11.6), respectively. Paired t-test statistical analysis 

indicated that at the 0.05 significance level, the averages for the two depths were not 

different (Appendix A - Table A.2). 

The average bedding moisture was 60.3% (±3.3). The minimum and maximum bedding 

moisture was between 53.6% and 63.0%, respectively. The first and third quartiles were 

58.3% and 62.7%, respectively. The average moisture content of bedding in Barn 20 is 

given in Appendix A (Table A.5).

Barn 21 was bedded with kiln dried wood shavings. The compost appeared relatively 

wet and fresh and fine material was spread out on top of the pack once a day. The bedding 

material was aerated to a depth of 0.20 to 0.25 m once a day (summer time) and twice a 

day (winter time) while cows were away at the parlor, using a chisel plow on a small 

tractor (Figure 4.64). This barn was cleaned out once a year. The pack had dimensions of 

36.6 m x 15.3 m. The stock density was 7.9 m2 / cow (Appendix A - Table A.1).  

The surface pack temperature measured was 4.5°C (±2.4). The average of the pack 

temperature in the depth 0.1 m [46.1°C (±32.5)] was less than the average of the depth 0.2 

m [50.2°C (±14.7)], as can been see in Appendix A (Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical 

analysis indicated that these two averages were not different (P &amp;lt;0.05).

The average bedding moisture was 58.8% (±3.3). The minimum bedding moisture was 

55.0% and the maximum was 64.5% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and third 

quartiles were 56.8% and 59.2%, respectively.

Barn 22 was bedded with green sawdust. The loosest and driest compost was found in 

the pack with a fluffy consistency (Figure 4.65). The pack was aerated once a day while the 

cows were milked. A tractor was used to pull the chisel plow. This barn was cleaned out 

twice a year. The bedded pack had dimensions of 61.0 m x 15.3 m and the stock density 

was 10.2 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1).  

The surface pack temperature measured was 6.9°C (±2.7). The average of the pack 

temperature in the depth 0.1 m [28.8°C (±5.4)] was high than the average of the depth 0.2 

m [31.6°C (±3.2)], as can been see in Appendix A (Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical 

analysis indicated that these two averages were different (P &amp;lt;0.05). 

The average bedding moisture was 52.0% (±4.4), ranging from 43.9% to 58.3% 

(Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and third quartiles were 50.0% and 53.9%, 

respectively.

Barn 23 was bedded with green sawdust (Figure 4.66). The bedding compost was 

appearing compacted and wet, with mainly slurry consistency. The pack was aerated once a 

day while the cows were milked. A tractor was used to pull the chisel plow. This barn had 

pack dimensions of 61.0 m x 15.3 m and was cleaned out twice a year.  The stock density 

(25.9 m2 per cow) was high than suggested minimum (7.4 m2 per cow) by Janni et al. 

(2007). Compost barns will not perform well if the cows are overcrowded. 

The average bedding temperatures at surface was 6.0°C (±2.6). Paired t-test statistical 

analysis indicated that at the 0.05 significance level, the averages for the two depths were 

different. When comparing the pack temperature of the two depths, was found that the 

average of the depth 0.1 m was less than the average of the depth 0.2 m (Appendix A - 

Table A.4). The bedding temperatures indicated that the bedding material used for this barn 

was not composting, although the aerated pack was biologically active. 

The average bedding moisture was 67.3% (±1.3), which is high than the recommended 

for composting of 45% to 60% moisture (NRAES-54, 1992). The minimum bedding 

moisture was 65.9% and the maximum was 69.7% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and 

third quartiles were 66.3% and 68.1%, respectively.

Barn 24 was bedded using green sawdust (Figure 4.67).  The pack had dimensions of 

30.5 m x 15.3 m and was cleaned out twice a year. This farmer added some amount of 

fresh media every week. It is common for farmers to have to add more media in the winter 

due to the cold weather inhibiting airflow in the barn thus reducing the drying of the 

surface of the pack (Changirath et al., 2011). The pack was aerated once a day while the 

cows were milked, using a chisel plow. The stock density of this barn was 12.9 m2 per cow 

(Appendix A - Table A.1). 



146 
 

The average bedding temperatures at surface and 0.1 m and 0.2 m depths were 7.2°C 

(±2.5), 15.3°C (±5.5), and 19.8°C (±4.9), respectively (Appendix A - Table A.4). Paired t-

test statistical analysis indicated that the averages for the two depths were different (P &amp;lt;

0.05).  

The average bedding moisture was 64.0% (±1.6), which is high than the recommended 

by NRAES-54 (1992). The minimum bedding moisture was 62.5% and the maximum was 

67.3% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and third quartiles were 62.9% and 64.2%, 

respectively.  

 

 
Figure 4.67 - Fresh media was added every week in Barn 24. 
 

Barn 25 was bedded with kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust. Aerating was done 

twice a day with a chisel plow that turns over the compost 0.20 to 0.25 m below the surface 

(Figure 4.68). This farmer was trying to minimize the aeration to two or three times per 

week or less. The reason given was to lower labor and fuel costs with seeming little benefit 

to the bedded pack through drying or mixing. Fresh media was added to the pack every two 

days as needed to keep the pack dry. The pack had dimensions of 51.2 m x 29.9 m and was 

not cleaned out. The stock density was 9.3 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1).  

The surface pack temperature measured was 7.0°C (±4.2). The average of the pack 

temperature in the depth 0.1 m [17.1°C (±3.5)] was high than the average of the depth 0.2 

m [20.2°C (±2.3)]. as can been see in Appendix A (Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical 

analysis indicated that these two averages were different (P &amp;lt;0.05). 

The average bedding moisture was 61.2% (±2.3). The minimum bedding moisture was 

58.9% and the maximum was 64.5% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and third 

quartiles were 59.4% and 63.8%, respectively.

Barn 26 was bedded with green sawdust. The dimensions of the bedded pack were 61.0 

m x 15.6 m. Approximately 135 cows were kept in the bedded pack that provided a stock 

density of 7.0 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). Aerating was done with a chisel plow 

(Figure 4.69) twice a day in the summer and winter time. Fresh media was added to the 

pack once a week in the winter.  

The average bedding temperatures at surface and two depths (0.1 m and 0.2 m) were 

6.8°C (±4.5), 39.5°C (±11.2), and 39.5°C (±9.8), respectively, as can been see in Appendix 

A (Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that the averages for the two 

depths were not different (P &amp;lt;0.05).  

The average bedding moisture was 57.3% (±2.8). The minimum bedding moisture was

0.20 m. This barn was not cleaned out during the year. The dimension of the bedded pack 

was 36.6 m x 12.2 m. The stock density was 8.6 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1).  

The average surface temperature measured was 18.2°C (±9.1). The average of the pack 

temperature in the depth 0.1 m and 0.2 m were 39.4°C (±23.3) and 43.3°C (±14.7), 

respectively. (Appendix A - Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that these 

two averages were not different (P &amp;lt;0.05). 

The average bedding moisture was 67.8% (±1.3). as can be seen in (Appendix A -

Barn 28 was bedded with green sawdust (Figure 4.71a). This barn had pack dimensions 

of 36.6 m x 15.3 m and was tilling once a day (summer) and twice a day (winter), thereby 

mixing and aerating the pack using chisel plough (Figure 4.71b). This farmer removed the 

bedded pack media from this barn one time per year in summer, and then immediately 

applied it to the fields. The stock density was 7.0 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1).  

The surface pack temperature measured was 9.0°C (±4.2). The average of the pack 

temperature in the depth 0.1 m was less than the average of the depth 0.2 m (Appendix A -

Barn 29 was bedded with green sawdust and the bedded pack had dimensions of 61.0 m 

x 14.6 m (Figure 4.72a). This package was very wet, when walking atop it, the boots were 

sunk in up to ankles in some spots. Tilling was performed once daily (summer and winter) 

using a chisel plow with 0.25 m shovels (Figure 4.72b). The pack appeared to be 

compacted and chunks were seen after stirring. The stock density was 10.0 m2 per cow 

(Appendix A - Table A.1). 

The average surface temperature measured was 5.4°C (±3.4). The average of the pack 

temperature in the depth 0.1 m and 0.2 m were 15.5°C (±6.7) and 18.0°C (±5.6),

Barn 30 was bedded with green sawdust. This barn was not cleaned out during the year. 

Aerating was done with a chisel plow twice a day (summer and winter) when the cows are 

being milked. The depth of the bedding media layer was approximately 0.40 to 0.45 m. The 

wet compost was close to the scrape alley (Figure 4.73). This barn had pack dimensions of 

45.8 m x 18.8 m and the stock density was 8.8 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1).  

The average surface temperature measured was 14.2°C (±9.8). The average of the pack 

temperature in the depth 0.1 m and 0.2 m were 49.2°C (±7.8) and 52.9°C (±4.5), 

respectively (Appendix A - Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that the 

averages for the two depths were different (P &amp;lt;0.05). Details can be seen in Appendix A

Barn 31 was using green sawdust and a load of green sawdust was spread in early in the 

winter. Tilling was done twice a day (summer and winter). A tractor was used to pull a 

chisel plow (Figure 4.74). The depth of the compost media layer was approximately 0.60 

m. The bedded pack had dimensions of 45.8 m x 31.7 m and the stock density was 11.0 m2 

per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). 

The surface pack temperature measured was 11.8°C (±8.4). The average of the pack 

temperature in the depth 0.1 m [32.8°C (±17.2)] was less than the average of the depth 0.2 

m [35.1°C (±13.3)], as can been see in Appendix A (Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical

analysis indicated that at the 0.05 significance level, the averages for the two depths were 

not different. 

The average bedding moisture was 61.7% (±3.7). The minimum bedding moisture was 

56.8% and the maximum was 68.7% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and third

the surface (Figure 4.75b). The dimensions of the bedded pack were 30.5 m x 18.3 m. 

Approximately 47 cows were kept in the bedded pack that provided a stock density of 11.9 

m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1).  

The average surface temperature measured was 6.7°C (±4.4). When comparing the 

pack temperature of the two depths, it was found that the average of the depth 0.1 m was 

less than the average of the depth 0.2 m (Appendix A - Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical 

analysis indicated that the averages for the two depths were different (P &amp;lt;0.05).  

The average bedding moisture was 66.4% (±1.3), which was above NRAES-54 (1992), 

recommended level of 45% to 60%. The minimum bedding moisture was 64.8% and the

Barn 33 was using kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust (Figure 4.76a). The pack was 

aerated twice a day (summer and winter) using chisel plow (Figure 4.76b). The pack was 

not cleaned out. The compost pack appeared to be compacted and chunks were seen after 

stirring. The compost appeared relatively wet and did stick to the boots when walking on 

the surface. The bedded pack had dimensions of 61.0 m x 15.6 m and the stock density was 

10.8 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). 

The surface pack temperature measured was -1.5°C (±16.1). The average of the pack

Barn 34 owner was using kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust for bedding (Figure 

4.77). This barn was stirred at least two time each day (summer and winter) when the cows 



153 
 

are being milked. The pack was aerated 0.35 m depth, however experienced compost barn 

operators suggest that the pack should be stirred to a depth 0.25 m to 0.30 m twice a day 

(Janni et al., 2007). Bedded pack stirring was done using a cultivator attached to the back 

of a tractor. The bedded pack had dimensions of 29.3 m x 11.0 m and the stock density was 

3.0 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). 

The average bedding temperatures at surface and 0.1 m and 0.2 m depths were -0.8°C 

(±3.7), 27.6°C (±29.3), and 23.3°C (±3.9), respectively. Paired t-test statistical analysis 

indicated that the averages for the two depths were not different (P &amp;lt;0.05). The average 

temperature of bedding in this barn is given in Appendix A (Table A.4). 

The average bedding moisture was 68.9% (±2.0), which is high than the recommended 

for composting of 45% to 60% moisture (NRAES-54, 1992). The minimum bedding 

moisture was 66.2% and the maximum was 71.9% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and 

third quartiles were 67.3% and 70.3%, respectively.

Barn 35 was bedded with green sawdust (Figure 4.78a), but it is not recommended to 

start with the compost dairy barn using green sawdust (Crary et al.. 2005). The bedded 

pack was aerated once a day using rotary tiller on a tractor. The rotary tiller was mounted 

in 3 point diggers on the back of a tractor (Figure 4.78b). This farmer initially started with 

0.35 m to 0.40 m depth of green sawdust. The bedded pack had dimensions of 36.6 m x 8.5 

m and the stock density was 10.3 m2 per cow. This barn was cleaned out 2.5 times per year.  

The surface pack temperature measured was -3.5°C (±2.6). The average of the pack 

temperature in the depth 0.1 m was less than the average of the depth 0.2 m. as can be seen 

in Appendix A (Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that these two 

averages were different (P &amp;lt;0.05).

The average bedding moisture measured was 62.6% (±5.6), ranging from 48.7% to 

69.4% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and third quartiles were 62.5% and 64.6%, 

respectively.

Barn 36 was bedded with green sawdust. Aerating was done twice daily with a chisel 

plow that turns over the compost 0.15 m – 0.20 m below the surface. The dimensions of the 

bedded pack were 43.9 m x 14.6 m. The stock density was 6.9 m2 per cow (Appendix A - 

Table A.1). The wet compost was found in this pack, with mainly slurry consistency 

(Figure 5.79). This barn was cleaned out three times per year. Addition of fresh material is 

recommended when the bedded pack becomes moist enough for it to stick to the cows.  

Average bedding temperatures at surface and 0.1 m and 0.2 m depths were 3.3°C 

(±2.5), 15.7°C (±6.4), and 18.2°C (±5.8), respectively (Appendix A - Table 4). Paired t-test 

statistical analysis indicated that the averages for the two depths were different (P &amp;lt;0.05). 

The average bedding moisture [71.8% (±0.8)] was the largest that has been found 

among the farms studied, ranging from 70.8% to 73.3% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The 

first and third quartiles were 71.3% and 71.9%, respectively. Bedding needs to stay dry for 

the benefit of keeping cows clean and somatic cell count (SCC) low.

Barn 37 was bedded with green sawdust. Tilling was done once a day with a chisel 

plow that turns over the compost 0.15 m – 0.20 m below the surface. The same chisel plow 

was used in this barn and Barn 38 (Figure 4.80). A load of green sawdust was added every 

three weeks. In the winter time, fresh green sawdust was necessary to be added more 

frequently. This barn was cleaned out twice a year. Care must be taken when removing the 

bedded pack during clean out, or during pack stirring when the bedded pack is less than 

0.30 m deep, to avoid disturbing the base of the barn (Janni et al., 2005). The pack had 

dimensions of 45.8 m x 10.7 m and the stock density was 10.0 m2 per cow. 

The average surface temperature measured was 4.7°C (±2.9). The average of the pack 

temperature in the depth 0.1 m and 0.2 m were 20.2°C (±15.3) and 25.3°C (±16.6), 

respectively. Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that the averages for the two depths 

were different (P &amp;lt;0.05). Details can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.4) 

The average bedding moisture was 64.3% (±3.5), which was above NRAES-54 (1992) 

recommended level of 45% to 60%. The minimum bedding moisture was 57.0% and the 

maximum was 68.7%. The first and third quartiles were 63.4% and 66.5%, respectively. 

The average moisture content of bedding in this barn is given in Appendix A (Table A.5).

Barn 38 was bedded with green sawdust (Figure 4.81). The compost appeared relatively 

loose and dry and did not stick to the boots when walking on the surface. The bedded pack 

was aerated once a day, at least 0.20 m deep. According to Endres (2009), the bedded pack 

should be aerated twice daily, at least 0.25 m deep, to keep it aerobic and fluffy, hence 

biological activity generates heat and helps dry the pack. This barn was cleaned out twice a 

year and a load of fresh green sawdust was added every three weeks. The pack had 

dimensions of 36.6 m x 21.7 m and the stock density was 15.9 m2 per cow.

The average bedding temperatures at surface was 3.8°C (±2.3). Paired t-test statistical 

analysis indicated that at the 0.05 significance level, the averages for the two depths were 

different. When comparing the pack temperature of the two depths, was found that the 

average of the depth 0.1 m was less than the average of the depth 0.2 m (Appendix A - 

Table A.4).  

The average bedding moisture was 61.7% (±6.4). The minimum bedding moisture was 

50.5% and the maximum was 67.7% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and third 

quartiles were 56.9% and 66.7%, respectively.  

 

 

Figure 4.81 - Barn 38 was bedded with green sawdust. 
 

Barns 39 and 40 were bedded using green sawdust (Figure 4.82a). These barns were 

stirred at least twice a day (summer and winter) when the cows are being milked. The 

packs were aerated 0.18 m depth. Bedded packs stirring were done using a chisel plow 

attached to the back of a tractor (Figure 4.82b). These barns had the same bedded pack 

dimensions of 48.8 m x 22.0 m. The stock density of the barn 39 and 40 were 12.2 m2 per 

cow and 12.6 m2 per cow, respectably. Details can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.1). 

The average surface temperature measured in Barns 11 and 12 were -1.7°C (±4.5) and 

0.0°C (±8.3), respectively. Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that there were 

significant (P &amp;lt;0.05) differences in average temperatures for the two depths in both of 

barns (Appendix A - Table A.4).  

The average bedding moisture in Barns 39 and 40 were 66.5% (±1.0) and 64.6% (±1.7), 

respectively. Details can be seen in Appendix A (Table A.5).

Barn 41 was bedded with kiln dried wood shavings or sawdust. This farmer used chisel 

plow (Figure 4.83) to aeration once a day (summer and winter). The pack was aerated 0.15 

m depth. According to Endres (2009), some producers in Minnesota are aerating the pack 

deeper (about 0.35 – 0.40 m) using a chisel plow type of equipment, and they have 

observed a reduction in bedding needs and increased pack temperatures. Clean bedding 

was added every time the bedded pack became moist enough for it to adhere to the cows 

and a load of fresh material was added every three weeks. The pack had dimensions of 30.5 

m x 15.3 m and the stock density was 5.2 m2 per cow (Appendix A - Table A.1). 

The surface pack temperature measured was -4.0°C (±2.3). The average of the pack 

temperature in the depth 0.1 m [25.2°C (±15.1)] was less than the average of the depth 0.2 

m [30.0°C (±5.9)], as can been see in Appendix A (Table A.4). Paired t-test statistical 

analysis indicated that these two averages were different (P &amp;lt;0.05). 

The average bedding moisture was 70.1% (±2.7), which is high than the recommended 

for composting of 45% to 60% moisture (NRAES-54, 1992). The minimum bedding 

moisture was 65.2% and the maximum was 71.7% (Appendix A - Table A.5). The first and 

third quartiles were 69.1% and 71.7%, respectively.

Barn 42 was bedded with mix material. Tilling was performed twice a day in the 

summer and winter time, using a chisel plow with 0.20 m shovels (Figure 4.84). The chisel 

plow tills to a depth of 0.14 m – 0.18 m. This farmer cleaned out once a year and leave 

about 0.05 m of old material in the barn to help initiate microbial activity. This pack was 

cleaned out one time per year. The bedded pack had dimensions of 53.7 m x 14.9 m and the 

stock density was 8.0 m2 per cow, as can been see in Appendix A (Table A.1). 

The bedding temperatures measured at two depths were 18.2°C (±25.1) and 24.8°C 

(±5.1) and the pack surface temperatures was 0.9°C (±3.5). Paired t-test statistical analysis 

indicated that these two averages were different (P &amp;lt;0.05). 

The average bedding moisture was 69.1% (±1.2). The minimum bedding moisture was 

67.6% and the maximum was 70.7%. The first and third quartiles were 68.3% and 70.2%, 

respectively. More details about Barn 42 are given in Appendix A (Table A.1).

4.2.4. Environment characteristics 

The average temperature gradient (taken at 0.05 m and 1.20 m above the pack) was       

-0.52 °C · m-1 (± 1.0), indicating that there was a reduction of the air temperature along the 

height measurement. Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that at the 0.05 significance 

level, the averages air temperatures for the two heights were different. The average surface 

temperatures on the pack were similar to the average ambient temperature. During the 

winter, the temperature would be the first indicator of changes in bed performance (Taraba 

and Bewley, 2010). Air temperatures tended to be lower inside barns which utilized 

Overshot or Capped ridge, mechanical ventilation system and ridge direction of SW or NW 

(Table 4.1). Building temperatures must remain above freezing most of the time to prevent 

frozen manure in the pack. This type of building requires insulation (curtains) and a 

controlled ventilation system. Most compost packs were warmer than the outdoor air 



159 
 

temperature. This indicates that the packs were heating and microbial activity was 

occurring.  

The average relative humidity gradient in this study was 2.35 % · m-1 (± 0.5). Thus, the 

majority of barns tend to increase relative humidity along the height. Paired t-test statistical 

analysis indicated that the averages relative humidity for the two heights were different (P 

&amp;lt;0.05). In some barns, sawdust bedding was used to keep cattle comfortable and dry in 

higher amounts which increases barn operating costs. 

The average of air velocity gradient was -0.22 m s-1 · m-1 (± 0.3), indicating that the air 

velocity decreased along the height. Paired t-test statistical analysis indicated that at the 

0.05 significance level, the averages air velocity for the two heights were different. Thus, 

during the season of fall and winter in Kentucky, the barn orientation was not ideal for air 

movement since air generally moving along the length meets higher resistance than air 

moving across the building.  Sufficient air exchange is needed in cold weather to remove 

moisture from the pack and extend the time between bedding addition. Overall, the low 

sidewalls of the barns promoted high air velocity across the barns. Air movement through 

the barn should be sufficient to maintain inside temperature only slightly above outside 

temperature in winter and slightly below outside temperature in summer. A considerable 

differences between air velocity indoor and outdoor were observed in barns 1, 5, 6, 11, 12, 

13, 14, 16, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 37, and 38. Buildings and other obstacles (trees, hills, and 

tractors) around of these barns blocked for airflow and results in more high relative 

humidity, as can be seen in Table 4.1. On the other hand, high airflow during the winter 

can reduce the air temperature indoor and the pack temperature. In those conditions, 

windbreaks become very important. In the winter, side curtains can be an important 

investment to reduce barn ventilation and winter winds from extracting too much heat from 

a compost bed (Taraba and Bewley, 2010).

4.2.5. Herd characteristics 

The following section summarizes information collected by a collaborator (Black, 

2012). It is included to give a more full picture of the benefits of this type barn. 

The cow herd size, as reported by the dairymen, was adjusted for breed size and milk 

production. The average herd size on the pack in the study was 89.7 cows, ranging from 19 

to 184 cows and dry cow numbers ranged from 3 to 75 dry cows with an average of 25.1 

dry cows (Figure 4.85). Dry cows were housed on pasture, in a separate or the same area of 

the compost barn as the lactating cows, or in an alternative housing area. Breeds consisted 

of Jersey (6.8%), Holstein (72.7%), and mix (20.5%). Average milk production of cows 

was 27.2 kg per day with a mean fat and protein percentage of 3.85% and 2.35%, 

respectively. 

 

 

Figure 4.85 - Herd size and dry cows number in 42 CBP barns. 

 

4.2.6. Producer Responses 

All producers visited were very satisfied with their compost barns. They observed that 

cows were more comfortable (24.2%) and that this housing system resulted in increased 

cow cleanliness (12.1%), see Table 4.2 below for more details.

However, results of the survey revealed some aspects of the CBP barn producers would 

change. Their main concern was the size or capacity of the barn (25%). Further, many 

producers indicated the need for retaining wall (10%) and curtains (8.3%). Other 

recommended facilities changes are cited in Table 4.3.

The majority of producers were concerned about the supply of bedding. Many 

producers were seeking secure bedding supply (17.7%) and alternative bedding sources 

that will work in the CBP (9.7%). Producer recommendations also included  the 

importance of  maintaining the pack (8.1%), and stirring the pack two times per day or 

more frequently (14.5%), using kiln-dried shavings (9.7%), avoid the use of straw, wheat 

straw, corn fodder, or soybean fodder or pine as a bedding material (9.7%), and 

maintaining the pack by keeping moisture low (8.1%), as can be seen in Table 4.4. Some 

producers (4.8%) reported that touring other barns was an important influence on their 

choice of structure. Producers also reported that they spoke with other producers managing 

a CBP barn, they created their own plans, they reviewed freestall plans and designs, 

economics, and ease of management. Producers learned that using kiln-dried shavings, 

keeping the pack stirred, and avoiding the use of straw in the bedding, would help to 

prevent other mistakes.

4.3. Physical, chemical, and thermal properties of compost materials 

4.3.1. Compost particle size distribution 

Dried compost was sieved to measure the portion of each particle size range (PS2, PS3, 

PS4, and PS5) comprising the total amount. Three samples of each particle size range were 

used to determinate the compost particle size distribution. Particle size distributions on a 

weight basis (for compost from CBP barns using Green sawdust, Kiln-dried shavings or 

sawdust, and Mix compost) are presented in Figures 4.86. 

A comparison of the particle weight fraction distributions content in Figure 4.86 reveals 

that these compost materials from the CBP barns using different bedding compost materials 

are very different. The following percentages and standard deviations were found: in Green 

sawdust, in the particle size ranges together (PS2 + PS3 + PS4 + PS5) comprised 60.95 ± 

10.0% of the total weight, while coarser material represented 3.46 ± 3.4% and finer 

material, 35.60 ± 11.3%. In Kiln-dried shavings or sawdust, the compost particle size 

distribution were 25.44 ± 13.1% (finer material), 25.45 ± 8.5% (PS2), 4.12 ± 1.0% (PS3), 

10.50 ± 3.0% (PS4), 28.1 ± 14.2% (PS5), and 6.32 ± 8.1% (coarser material). In this plot 

(Figure 4.85), the distribution values of Mix materials increased in the order of Finer &amp;lt;PS2 

&amp;lt;PS5 &amp;lt;PS4 &amp;lt;PS3 &amp;lt;Coarser fractions. In CBP barns using Mix compost material, the 

lower and higher compost particle size distribution were 14.38% (Coarser &gt; 25.00 mm) and 

48.66% (Finer &amp;lt;2.00 mm), respectively. 

The analysis of variance between of compost particle ranges from all CBP barns was 

obtained and is shown in Figure 4.87 at the significance level of p &amp;lt;0.05. The Tukey test 

shows that there was a significant difference between average values of compost particle 

ranges. This results indicate that the distribution of mass weight increased in the order of 

Coarser = PS3 &amp;lt;PS4 &amp;lt;PS5 = PS2 &amp;lt;PS2 = Finer. The average finer index expressed as 

weight percent in the samples studied was 30.1%. Details about statistic analysis can be 

seen in Appendix F (Table 1).

4.3.2. Particle density, bulk density, and porosity 

Particle density, bulk density, and porosity of 42 compost bulking material results are 

shown in Table 4.5.  

Particle density of all compost material studied ranged from 0.86 to 1.11 g cm-3 with an 

average of 0.98 g cm-3 and a standard deviation of 0.02 (Table 4.5). Generally, the compost 

materials of CBP barns 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33, 36, 40, 



167 
 

41, and 42 show high particle density (? 1g cm-3) compared with other materials (Table 

4.5). It should be noted that the obtained values are somewhat higher than expected, but 

evaporation of water increase the solids content, particularly with well performing beds or 

high cow density. Cows that spend time in pasture may return soil to bed.  

Results and standard errors of bulk density for compost bed material collected from 

each barn are shown below (Table 4.5). The average bulk density was 0.37 ± 0.02 g cm-3 

with a range of 0.15 to 0.54 g cm-3. Higher bulk density suggests that the compost have less 

pore space and are more compact. The highest bulk density value was 3.6 times that of the 

lower bulk density value. 

The average porosity of the bedding material in all compost barns was 62.65 ± 2.14% 

with a range of 47.43 to 77.32%. In general, the average porosity increased when the bulk 

density decreased, significantly higher porosity was found in Barns 41 (77.32%). The 

variation of average porosity in all compost bulking material was similar to those bulk 

density in the reverse order due to the inverse relationship between bulk density and 

porosity (Table 4.5). So, high bulk density and low porosity might cause poor aeration and 

limiting oxygen concentration uptake by microorganisms and inhibiting microorganisms 

growth.  Previous researchers have reported the optimum and minimum range of porosity 

for aerobic process in compost systems was 85 to 90%, and 30%, respectively (Schulze, 

1962; Rynk, 1992; Nappi and Barberis, 1993).

4.3.3. Water holding capacity 

The water holding capacity (WHC) was evaluated in this study to determine whether 

the beds operated under moisture conditions that would allow drainage of contaminated 

water to compost bed base which could infiltrate into groundwater. Since WHC has very 

important relationship with physical and biological properties of bed compost materials, the 

moisture levels were set based on the WHC to find the real structure and texture conditions 



169 
 

of compost providing aeration and microbial activity. So, WHC was achieved in the first 12 

hours of natural drainage from an initial moisture content greater than the media WHC. 

The values of WHC and moisture content in 42 bed compost materials are illustrated in 

Figure 4.88. The average WHC of all bed compost was at 72.7% on a wet weight basis  

with a range of 53.6 to 79.8%. WHC was lower for bed compost in CBP barn 1 to the other 

materials tested and was able to hold water up to 53.6% w.b. moisture content. As 

expected, the smaller particle size range was able to hold more water (Table 4.5). WHC 

increases with increasingly fine particle size (decreasingly porosity), as can be seen in 

Figure 4.88. Coarse particle size of compost have a lower WHC since they are high in large 

pores subject to free drainage. Fine particle size have a greater occurrence of small pores 

that hold water against free drainage, resulting in a higher WHC values. Therefore, beds 

typically operate under MC conditions that would not allow drainage. Good operating 

range was 40-60% which is below WHC and that groundwater drainage would not occur 

when bed managed properly. 

The present study indicates a positive relationship between WHC and moisture content 

(r = 0.383, P &amp;lt;0.05), see Figure 4.88. Thereby, WHC increased with increasing moisture 

content. Ahn et al. (2008) reported that WHC increased with increasing moisture content 

until certain level. They suggested that moisture promotes aggregation of particles, and 

then decreased porosity. Finally, the lower porosity decreases the WHC.  

The WHC method was adequate to estimate the maximum amount of moisture that 

could be added to the bed compost without the occurrence of adequate drainage or runoff, 

thus avoiding contamination of the soil or water outside the barn.

4.3.4. Chemical properties of composts 

Results related to total nitrogen (N), total carbon (C), and carbon-nitrogen ratio (C:N) 

of each bed compost material are shown in Figure 4.89. Each value is an average of nine 

samples collected as previously described (Figure 3.5). Further results regarding other 

chemical compounds are shown in Appendix A (Table 6). 

The average total C was 42.7 ± 3.8% with a range of 29.8 to 47.1%. One of the major 

constituent of the compost, C, was most abundant (47.1%) in CBP barn 19. Only in the 

barn 9 contain average total C lower than 30.0%. Shane et al. (2010) reported a range total 

C of 12.7 to 20.1% in six compost barns in Minnesota collected in two different depth.   

Thus, the bed composts in Kentucky have not stabilized to the extend in this study. In 

general, many of the beds had not been operating properly, but as a result, the dairy 

producers learned how to improve beds to operate properly. 

The average total N was 1.6% ranged from 0.5 to 2.5%. Shane et al. (2010) reported 

an average total N of 0.76% with a range of 0.61 to 0.89% during the winter. Barberg et al. 

(2007) reported an average total N of 2.54% with a range of 0.57 to 4.22%. Russelle et al. 

(2009) reported average N of 1.12% in eight compost barns in Minnesota. Janni et al. 

(2007) reported an average total N of 0.99% six compost barns in Minnesota. Overall, the 

total N from the 42 bed compost materials tested in the study was similar to those reported 

previously by Barberg et al. (2007) and Shane et al. (2010). Nitrogen level of compost 

material is an important factor in the determination of C:N ratio of the composted material. 

Microorganisms for building up their structure of the body require it (Iqbal et al., 2010).  

The average C:N ratio was 28.5 ± 8.1. The C:N ratio of barn 10 (15.4) was lowest due 

to high nitrogen contents as compared to barn 12 (26.2). In barn 20 had the highest C:N 

ratio (43.9) to the other materials tested. Shane et al. (2010) reported the highest C:N ratio 

found was 26.0 during winter. Barberg et al. (2007) reported an average of 19.5. Russelle et 

al. (2009) reported a range of 11.2 to 20.9. Janni et al. (2007) reported an average C:N ratio 

of 15.5.  For effective composting C:N ratio of the compost should be ranged 20 to 25 

(Diaz et al., 1993). In another words, a C:N ratio below 25:1 may emit ammonia odor, 

which may influence the ammonia levels in the compost barns (Rosen et al., 2000). In 

general, in the present study it was balance enough. However, the barns 1, 3, 6, 9, 10, and 

18 will require an additional source of nitrogen to obtain the optimum bedding compost 

C:N ratio between 20 and 25.

4.3.5. Bacterial analysis of composts 

Figure 4.90 shows the pack bacterial count (Coliform, E. Coli, Staphylococcal, 

Streptococcal, and Bacillus) and the associated moisture content in the bedding compost 

material of 42 CBP barns.  

Bedding compost always contained bacterial, but the variation was large between 

different sampling sites and times. However, Coliforms were not present in Barn 15 that 

had a higher compost temperature (Appendix A - Table 4). Coliforms, E. Coli, Bacillus and 

Streptococcus count were higher in the barn 4 that showed lower moisture content (36.2%). 

The average Coliforms, E. Coli, Streptococcus and Bacillus content in the bedding material 

of barn 4 were 247.5 ± 12.0 cfu/g, 173.0 ± 18.38 cfu/g, 3595.0 ± 148.49 cfu/g, and 1810.0 

± 608.11 cfu/g, respectably. Also, the environmental Staphylococcus were highest in the 

barn 6 that had an average of 2.700 ± 0.00 cfu/g. The present study indicates a inverse 

relationship between moisture content and bacterial counts (Coliforms, r = 0.377, P &amp;lt;0.05; 

E. Coli, r = 0.448, P &amp;lt;0.05;  Bacillus, r = 0.372, P &amp;lt;0.05). There are no significant 

relationships between bacterial counts (Streptococcal and Staphylococcal) with moisture 

content (P &gt; 0.05).

4.3.6. Thermal properties of composts 

4.3.6.1. Thermal properties of composts in different moisture content and compaction 

degree 

The thermal conductivity of unsegregated bed compost materials varied from 0.081 to 

0.625 W m-1 K-1 for Green sawdust, 0.071 to 0.618 W m-1 K-1 for Kiln-dried shavings or 

sawdust, 0.059 to 0.766W m-1 K-1 for Mix, and 0.105 to 0.406 W m-1 K-1 for average of all 

compost material tested, depending upon the moisture content (30, 45, and 60%) and static 

compaction degree (fluffy, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 MPa) within the experimental range of 

the variables. An increasing trend in the thermal conductivity of all compost was also 

observed with the increase in both moisture content and static compaction degree for all 

compost material tested (Figure 4.91). The compost with low moisture content exhibited a 

low thermal conductivity because of the presence of a relatively high fraction of air (a poor 

conductor). The thermal conductivity increased with compaction due to a reduction in the 

void space (Chandrakanthi et al., 2005).  

 

 

 

 



174 
 

a) Thermal Conductivity: 

Multiple regressions analysis for compost materials showed that there is also a linear 

relationship between thermal conductivity (k) and moisture content (MC) and static 

compaction degree (SC) as follows: 

a) Green sawdust: 
kgreen = -0.0619 + 0.311 · SC + 0.478 · MC R

2 = 0.838 (4.1)
 
b) Kiln-dried shavings or sawdust: 

kkiln = -0.0679 + 0.342 · SC + 0.487 · MC R
2 = 0.877 (4.2)

 
c) Mix: 

kMix = -0.0537 + 0.360 · SC + 0.434 · MC R
2 = 0.829 (4.3)

 
d) Average of all compost material: 

kAverage = -0.0612 + 0.338 · SC + 0.467 · MC R
2 = 0.852 (4.4)

 

The response surface presented in Figure 4.91 was almost flat due to the fitted linear 

model, except at high moisture content and high static compaction degree, which showed 

an abrupt increase. The analysis of variance (Table 4.6) indicates a greater effect of the 

static compact degree (high F-value) than that of the moisture content on the thermal 

conductivity for Green sawdust and Kiln. However, the analysis of variance indicates a 

greater effect of the moisture content than that of the static compaction degree on the 

thermal conductivity for Mix. The magnitudes of respective regression coefficients in 

equations 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 also confirmed the results. The models seem adequately 

fitted based on the observation of high F-value as well as high coefficient of determination 

(R2). The models accounted for 83.8% (Green sawdust), 87.7% (Kiln-dried shavings), 

82.9% (Mix), and 85.2% (average of all compost material) variation in the thermal 

conductivity within the experimental range of input variables.  

The maximum differences between measured and estimated values of the thermal 

conductivity were within ± 0.059 W m-1 K-1 (Green sawdust), ± 0.060 W m-1 K-1 (Kiln-

dried shavings), ± 0.066 W m-1 K-1 (Mix), and ± 0.065 W m-1 K-1 (average of all compost 

material) in which define desirable levels of accuracy by the thermal sensor for estimating 

the thermal conductivity (Figure 4.92). 

Figure 4.91 revealed that the thermal conductivity of bed compost also increased with 

increase in moisture content and static compaction degree. The thermal conductivity of leaf 



175 
 

compost increased linearly with increase water content and compaction degree, represented 

by volume fractions of air (Chandrakanthi et al., 2005). Details about statistic analysis can 

be seen in Appendix F.

Thermal conductivity of bed compost materials as a function of moisture content (30, 

45, and 60%) and dynamic compaction degree (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 MPa ) are shown in 

Figure 4.93. Generally, the thermal conductivity increases with increasing moisture content 

and dynamic compaction. Theoretically, these values can be predictable because 

compaction over time has an direct effect, because it increases the bulk density of compost 

by reducing porosity, which increases the thermal conductivity. Thermal conductivity 

showed highest values at 60% of moisture content and 0.4 MPa of dynamic compaction 

degree of Green sawdust (0.643 W m-1 K-1), Kiln-dried shavings or sawdust (0.626 W m-1 

K-1), Mix (0.788 W m-1 K-1), and average of all compost material (0.244 W m-1 K-1).  

Multiple regressions analysis for compost materials showed that there is also a linear 

relationship between thermal conductivity (k) and moisture content (MC) and dynamic 

compaction degree (DC) as follows: 

a) Green sawdust: 
kgreen = -0.131 + 0.269 · DC + 0.689 · MC R

2 = 0.925 (4.5)
 
b) Kiln-dried shavings or sawdust: 

kkiln = -0.127 + 0.271 · DC + 0.680 · MC R
2 = 0.956 (4.6)

 
c) Mix: 

kMix = -0.122 + 0.193 · DC + 0.623 · MC R
2 = 0.934 (4.7)

 
d) Average of all compost material: 

kAverage = -0.123 + 0.274 · DC + 0.664 · MC R
2 = 0.944 (4.8)

 
The analysis of variance indicates a greater effect of the dynamic compact degree (high 

F-value) than that of the moisture content on the thermal conductivity for all material 

tested, see Table 4.7. The magnitudes of respective regression coefficients (R2) in 

equations 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, and 4.8 also confirmed the results. Thermal conductivity presented 

an excellent relationship with moisture content and dynamic compaction degree. To fit the 

curves to the observed data, a linear equation was used (Equations 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, and 4.8). 

This approach is a functional relationship selected purely by their mathematical flexibility 

to fit the experimental data points, being the main advantage that it does not require the 

determination of any additional compost material parameters. Authors in the literature have 

also used these type of equations to relate the compost moisture content and static 

compaction degree with different compost properties (Singh et al., 2007; Ahn et al., 2009). 



179 
 

The models seem adequately fitted based on the observation of high F-value as well as high 

coefficient of determination (R2). The models accounted for 92.5% (Green sawdust), 

95.6% (Kiln-dried shavings or sawdust), 93.4% (Mix), and 94.4% (average of all compost 

material) variation in the thermal conductivity within the experimental range of input 

variables. The maximum differences between measured and estimated values of the 

thermal conductivity were within ± 0.037 W m-1 K-1 (Green sawdust), ± 0.033 W m-1 K-1 

(Kiln-dried shavings or sawdust), ± 0.045 W m-1 K-1 (Mix), and ± 0.036 W m-1 K-1 

(average of all compost material), which is desirable accuracy for estimating the thermal 

conductivity (Figure 4.94). The statistic analysis can be seen in Appendix F.

The analysis of variance between thermal conductivity and moisture content (30, 45, 

and 60%) and static compaction (fluffy, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 MPa) degree for all bed 

compost materials were obtained and are show in Figure 4.95 at the significance level of p 

&amp;lt;0.05. The Tukey test shows that there was a significant difference between average 

values of moisture content and static compaction degree. These results indicate that the 

thermal conductivity  increased as  moisture content decreased in the order of 60% &gt; 45% 

&gt; 30% and thermal conductivity increased with the static compaction degree in order of 0.4 

MPa &gt; 0.3 MPa &gt; 0.2 MPa &gt; 0.1 MPa &gt; 0.0 MPa = fluffy. Details about statistic analysis

b) Thermal resistivity: 

The variations in thermal resistivity of bed compost materials with moisture content 

(30, 45, and 60%) and static compaction degree (fluffy, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 MPa) are 

presented in Figure 4.96. The values of thermal resistivity of Green sawdust, Kiln-dried 

shavings or sawdust, Mix, and average of all compost material varied from 160.0 to 1240.5 

°C cm / W, 161.7 to 1384.3 °C cm / W, 130.6 to 1253.3 °C cm / W, 269.5 to 962.6 °C cm / 

W, respectably, for experimental range of the variables. As depicted in Figure 4.96, an 

increasing trend in the thermal resistivity of bed compost was observed with the decrease in 

both moisture content and static compaction degree.  

Multiple regression analysis showed that there is a linear relationship between 

dependent variable of the thermal resistivity (rho) and the independent variables of 

moisture content (MC) and static compaction degree (SC) as follows: 

a) Green sawdust: 
rhogreen = 1229.382 - 825.693 · SC - 1099.412 · MC R

2 = 0.938 (4.9)
 
b) Kiln-dried shavings or sawdust: 

rhokiln = 1282.485 - 972.177 · SC - 1164.851 · MC R
2 = 0.929 (4.10)

 
c) Mix: 

rhoMix = 1229.610 - 987.615 · SC - 948.268 · MC R
2 = 0.916 (4.11)

 
d) Average of all compost material: 

rhoAverage = 1247.159 - 928.495 · SC - 1070.8 · MC R
2 = 0.932 (4.12)

 

The equations 4.9, 4.10, 4.11, and 4.12 were the first order linear model, so the 

response surface shown in Figure 4.96 were almost flat. 

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) table was constructed to evaluate the individual effect 

of independent variables on the thermal resistivity (Table 4.8). The high F-values of 

regression confirmed the adequacy of the linear fitted model which accounted for 93.8% 

(Green sawdust), 92.9% (Kiln-dried shavings or sawdust), and 91.6% (Mix) variations of 

the thermal resistivity within the experimental range of the studied input variables. 

Comparison showed that the maximum differences between measured and estimated values 

of thermal resistivity were within ± 75.0 °C cm / W, ± 101.3 °C cm / W, ± 111.7 °C cm / 

W, and ± 87.316 °C cm / W which are desirable accuracy for estimating the thermal 

resistivity (Figure 4.97). Details about statistic analysis can be seen in Appendix F. 



184 
 

Comparing F-values of the moisture content and static compaction degree showed that 

the effect of moisture content on the thermal resistivity was higher (high F-value) than the 

effect of static compaction degree (low F-value), see Table 4.8.

Figure 4.98 shows the relationship between thermal resistivity as a function of moisture 

content (30, 45, and 60%) and dynamic compaction (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 MPa) for bed 

compost materials. The values of thermal resistivity of Green sawdust, Kiln-dried shavings 

or sawdust, Mix, and average of all compost material varied from 155.5 to 1092.0 °C cm / 

W, 159.7 to 1097.5 °C cm / W, 126.9 to 1128.6 °C cm / W, and 277.7 to 801.9 °C cm / W 

respectably, depending upon the moisture content and dynamic compaction degree within 

the experimental range of the variables. 

An decreasing trend in the thermal resistivity of compost materials were also observed 

with the increase in moisture content and dynamic compaction degree (Figure 4.98). 

Multiple regression analysis showed that there is also a linear relationship between thermal 

resistivity (rho) and moisture content (MC) and dynamic compaction degree (DC) as 

follows: 

a) Green sawdust: 

rhogreen = 1187.716 - 497.389 · DC - 12.442 · MC R
2 = 0.987 (4.13)

 

b) Kiln-dried shavings or sawdust: 

rhokiln = 1211.623 - 532.158 · DC - 12.924 · MC R
2 = 0.959 (4.14)

 

c) Mix: 

rhoMix = 1205.911 - 566.171 · DC - 11.412 · MC R
2 = 0.979 (4.15)

 

d) Average of all compost material: 

rhoAverage = 1201.750 - 531.906 · DC - 12.259 · MC R
2 = 0.985 (4.16)

 

The estimated values were compared with the measured thermal resistivity values. The 

linear relationship between measured and estimated values (Fig. 4.99) shows high 

correlation for all the materials. The estimated thermal resistivity from equations 4.13, 

4.14, 4.15, and 4.16 depends on the moisture content and dynamic compaction degree of 

the compost materials. These interdependent relationships between thermal resistivity and 

the two measured parameters are presented in Figure 4.99. The maximum difference 

between measured and estimated values of the thermal resistivity were within ±32.1 °C cm 

/ W (Green sawdust), ±68.7 °C cm / W (Kiln-dried shavings or sawdust), ±30.7 °C cm / W 

(Mix), and ±34.7 °C cm / W (average of all compost material), see Figure 4.99. 



188 
 

The analysis of variance (see Table 4.9) indicates a greater effect of the dynamic 

compaction degree (high F-value) than that of the moisture content on the thermal 

resistivity. The magnitudes of respective regression coefficients also confirmed the results 

(Equations 4.13, 4.14, 4.15, and 4.16). The models showed adequately fitted based on the 

observation of high F-value as well as high coefficient of determination (R2). Details about 

statistic analysis can be seen in Appendix F.

obtained at the significance level of p &amp;lt;0.05. The Tukey test shows that there was a 

significant difference between average values of thermal resistivity in different moisture 

content and static compaction degree. This results indicate that the distribution of moisture 

content decreased in the order of 30% &gt; 45% &gt; 60% and the distribution of static 

compaction degree decreased in order of fluffy &amp;lt;0 MPa &amp;lt;0.1 MPa &amp;lt;0.2 MPa &amp;lt;0.3 MPa &amp;lt;

4.3.6.2. Thermal properties of composts in different particle size 

Thermal conductivity and thermal resistivity of granular materials are affected by 

particle contact quality. The number of contacts per particle depend on the packing density, 

particle shape and particle size distribution. Their effects on thermal conductivity and 

thermal resistivity are explored in this section using selected compost materials and the 

thermal needle probe technique (Decagon KD2-Pro sensor).  

Figure 4.103 showed the influence of particle size in the thermal conductivity and 

thermal resistivity for bed compost samples using Green sawdust, Kiln-dried shavings or 

sawdust, and Mix. Thermal conductivity and thermal resistivity were plotted versus particle 

size distribution, just that these two properties were directly observed data. Values of 

thermal properties and thermal resistivity were not measured in samples of coarser material 

because it was not possible to insert the probe of sensor into the sample.  

The thermal conductivity increases with the decrease of particle size, while thermal 

resistivity decreases with the increase of particle size. However, as seen in Figure 4.103, 

the overall thermal conductivity and thermal resistivity varied with each particle size of bed 

compost materials. In general, the thermal conductivity increased with increasing particle 

size, while thermal resistivity decreased with increasing particle size what is the exact 

opposite of what was expected (Yun and Santamarina, 2008; Ahn et al., 2009). This 

behavior can probably be explained by considering the higher moisture retention of larger 

particles once compost materials were air dried at the same time. It could possibly have 

changed the values of the thermal properties. Thus, the effect of particle size on thermal 

conductivity was more pronounced at higher particle size than at lower particle size. 

However, the trend of thermal conductivity as a function of particle size, in some barns, 

was very consistent at particle size below than 4.75 mm. It was also observed that thermal 

conductivity increased drastically with large particle sizes higher than 8.00 mm. 

The effect of particle size on thermal conductivity was more pronounced for the higher 

particle size than at lower particle size. However, the tendency of lower thermal 

conductivity as a function of particle size was very consistent at particle sizes below than 

4.75 mm. It was also observed that thermal conductivity increased drastically (&gt; 85%) with 

large particle sizes higher than 8.00 mm. Thermal resistivity shows a decrease as the 

compost particle size increases after the 4.75 and 5.60 mm range in Mix material (Fig. 

4.103c).   



195 
 

The average values and standard deviation of thermal resistivity for all particle sizes 

were 585.1 ± 117.0°C cm / W (Green sawdust), 600.8 ± 140.8°C cm / W (Kiln-dried 

shavings or sawdust), and 572.4 ± 109.0°C cm / W (Mix), respectively. In a compost 

material with smaller particle sizes, a fraction of the particles form a resistivity pathway, 

which could result in enhanced thermal resistivity. 

The analysis of variance between thermal conductivity and compost particle size 

ranges for all bed compost materials (moisture content ? 30%)  is shown in Figure 4.104.  

The Tukey test with a significance level of p &amp;lt;0.05 was applied. There was significant 

differences between the thermal conductivity and compost particle size. In general, the 

values of thermal conductivity were higher in compost materials with particle sizes larger 

than 8.00 mm.  Details about statistic analysis can be seen in Appendix F (Table 2).  

The thermal conductivity of bed compost materials varied from 0.088 to 0.608 W m?1 

K?1 depending upon the particle size. An increasing trend in the thermal conductivity of 

bed compost materials was also observed with the increase particle size (Figure 4.104), 

which is in general agreement with previous findings of some researchers. Investigations of 

Ahn et al. (2009) showed that the thermal conductivity of 0.03 to 0.05 W m?1 K?1 to dry 

sawdust and 0.03 to 0.06 W m?1 K?1 to dry wood shavings.

Thermal resistivity ranged from 170.2 °C cm / W to 1139.3 °C cm / W with a mean 

value of 590.7 °C cm / W and associated standard deviation of 163.9 °C cm / W. However, 

changes in thermal resistivity depending on the weights of each particle in a bed mixture. 

The analysis of variance between thermal resistivity and particle size ranges for all bed 

compost materials was obtained and show in Figure 4.105 at the significance level of p &amp;lt;

0.05. The Tukey test shows that there was a significant difference between the values of 

thermal resistivity and compost particle size. The values of thermal resistivity for all bed 

compost materials were statistically higher in lower particle size (Finer and PS2). The 

average values of thermal resistivity in particle size between 4.75 and 8.00 mm (PS3 and 

PS4) were statistically similar. This results are already expected due to increased particle 

contact and particle shape effect with the probe of the sensor, thereby increasing the 

resistance of the heat transfer. More Details about statistic analysis, see Appendix F.

4.4. Develop computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of compost barn 

4.4.1. Mesh details 

The most important aspect of the CFD model, as regards its meshing, was the eave and 

ridge openings areas which, in order to resolve the small length scale and sharp gradient in 

the airflow, required a high-resolution mesh. On the other hand, near the top of the 

computational domain, cells could be relatively large. The mesh type is very important for 

accurate CFD calculation. The meshes can be mainly composed of hexahedral and 

tetrahedral volume mesh elements for a 3-D computational domain (Lee et al., 2007). 

Because of the complicated shapes of the CBP barn, a tetrahedral mesh was built in 

commercial ANSYS ICEM CFD® and a test of the different meshes was carried out using 

this software. Various size of tetrahedral meshes were used, and after several levels of 

previously evaluated refinement, no significant differences (p &amp;lt;0.05) in the air velocity 

and air temperature were encountered. Thus, the selected mesh was composed of 162,191 

nodes and 683,222 elements (Figure 4.106). Such a meshing system was found to conform 

easily to the exact boundary of the scale model.

Figure 4.106 - Computational grid mesh detail of the scale model: (a) sidewall and compost 
pack area, (b) external structure, (c) barn model with roof, and (d) the 
volume mesh. 

 

Although designing meshes was very time consuming, it was one of the most important 

procedures to effectively increase the accuracy of CFD results. Unlike the CFD models 

developed for other engineering fields, the natural ventilation study of agricultural 

buildings requires a very big computational domain because a vertically and horizontally 

sufficient area should be secured around the dairy barns. This larger volume needs to be 

enough to for simulating natural air flow. If the distance between the dairy barn  and the 

boundary walls of the computational domain was not sufficiently secured, the faster airflow 

stream could be compared with the natural airflow resulting in unreal airflow around the 

leeward vent opening (Lee et al., 2007). In this study, the size of the CFD domain used 

during the simulations was chosen in order to ensure that the position of the outer 

boundaries did not compromise the CFD solution. 

The computational domain was 2.40 x 2.40 x 1.20 m and the internal measured barn 

model area was 1.20 x 1.33 m. The airflow data in the CBP barn is much more important 

than that of the external area, but the adjacent area of the CBP barn is also very critical to 



200 
 

make a reliable air velocity distribution around the structure. To effectively the total mesh 

numbers, the dense meshes should be located in the CBP barn model and the mesh size had 

to be designed gradually bigger as with distance from the CBP barn. The study also found 

that it was very critical not to make a big and sudden change of mesh size between adjacent 

meshes. It was assumed that the mesh quality including density and shape around the 

external surface of the CBP barn model affected the external airflow and air pressure 

distribution of the CBP barn, which greatly influenced the natural ventilation. Details about 

refinement of the computational tetrahedral mesh can be seen in Figure 4.107.

4.4.2. Validation of reduced model and simulations 

Figures 4.108 to 4.115 shows the values of the average standard errors for the variables 

studied (air velocity and temperature) for all treatments tested (Closed ridge - CLR; Open 

ridge - OPR; Open ridge with chimney - ORC; Elevated ridge - ELR; and Overshot ridge - 

OVR) in each section and three different heights of data collection. 

The simulations were performed to validate the CFD model and showed that the 

average standard errors between the simulated and measured values for air velocity in all 

treatments tested, using an air speed of 0.1 m s-1, wind direction south to north, and three 

different heights, were 0.02 m s-1 (± 0.01), 0.02 m s-1 (± 0.01), 0.01 m s-1 (± 0.01), 0.01 m 

s-1 (± 0.01), and 0.02 m s-1 (± 0.01), respectively. Thus, the average standard errors for air 



201 
 

temperature were 0.22°C (± 0.17), 0.65°C (± 0.74), 0.74°C (± 0.54), 0.08°C (± 0.88), and 

0.82°C (± 0.91), respectively (see Figure 4.108). However, testing the other condition (air 

speed of 1.0 m s-1), the highest the average standard errors between the simulated and 

measured values for air velocity and temperature values were 0.09 m s-1 (± 0.12) and 

0.93°C (± 0.71), respectively, as can be seen in Figure 4.109. 

The highest average standard errors between the simulated and measured values for air 

velocity (0.02 m s-1 ± 0.01) and temperature (0.95°C ± 1.01), using air speed of 0.1 m s-1 

and wind direction of north to south  (perpendicular to ridge) were found in treatment 

ORC, see Figure 4.110. Thus, using the other air speed (1.0 m s-1), the highest average 

standard errors between the simulated and measured values for air velocity and temperature 

were 0.13 m s-1 (± 0.10) and 1.17°C (± 1.12), respectively (see Figure 4.111).  

The average standard error between simulated and measured air velocity and 

temperature, using air speed of 0.1 m s-1and wind direction of east to west were 0.01 m s-1 

with a range from 0.00 to 0.03 m s-1, and 1.13°C with a range from 0.05 to 3.35°C, 

respectively (see Figure 4.112). To other air speed tested (1.0 m s-1), the average standard 

error between simulated and measured air velocity and temperature were 0.23 m s-1 with a 

range from 0.00 to 0.47 m s-1, and 0.85°C with a range from 0.05 to 3.05°C, respectively 

(see Figure 4.113). 

The highest the average standard errors between simulated and measured values were 

0.01 m s-1 (± 0.01) for air velocity and 0.72°C (± 0.58) for temperature, using air speed of 

0.1 m s-1and wind direction of west to east (Figure 4.114). However, using air speed (1.0 m 

s-1), the highest average standard error between simulated and measured variables studied 

were 0.18 m s-1 (± 0.06) and 0.78°C (± 0.37) for these treatments tested (see Figure 4.115).

In general, there is a good fit of the model with coefficients of determinations (R2) of

The variables studied (air velocity and temperature), using air speed of 0.1 m s-1 and 

wind direction of north to south, gave a fair correlation of measured versus simulated 

values with r2 of 0.774, 0.794, 0.915, 0.892, 0.855 (Figure 4.117a) and 0.983, 0.766, 0.729,

air velocities regression for each treatment were 0.8598, 1.1416, 0.9035, 1.0833, and 

0.9332, respectively, see Table 4.12. Good correlations were observed between measured 

and simulated air velocity (R2 of 0.909, 0.949, 0.905, 0.856, and 0.875) and temperature 

(R2 of 0.702, 0.800, 0.701, 0.487, and 0.666) values to air speed of 1.0 m s-1, see Figures

For equations of the estimated variables studied, working with air speed of 0.1 m s-1 and 

wind direction of east to west, analysis linear regression and polynomial were performed 

between the simulated and measured data, where R2 values were 0.433, 0.704, 0.639, 

0.648, and 0.478, respectively, to air velocity (Figure 4.18a) and 0.715, 0.531, 0.815, 

0.631, and 0.766, respectively, to air temperature (Figure 4.18b). More details can be seen 

in Table 4.14 and 4.15. Additionally, using with air speed of 1.0 m s-1 and wind direction of 

east to west, the measurement variable studied were modeled using the linear regression 

and polynomial and good agreements were observed between the measured and simulated 

air velocities and temperatures functions, see Figure 4.18c, Figure 4.18d, and Table 4.15.

Good relationship was observed in the equations adjusted of variables studied measured 

and simulated using air speed of 0.1 m s-1 and wind direction of west to east (Figure 4.19). 

The adjusted equations of air velocity and temperature had lowest R2 of 0.404 and 0.451, 

respectively. Overall, the models performed similarly with the exception of OVR, which 

produced the largest values of air velocity measured. In this treatment, there was a positive 

and linear relationship between the average of measured and simulated air velocity (slope = 

0.5333, R2 = 0.404). Table 4.17 shows models efficiencies for air speed of 1.0 m s-1. The 

results show a good correlation between measured and simulated air velocity and 

temperature at five treatment tested. These are demonstrated by the correlation coefficients 

(R2). In both conditions, these equations showed the linear and angular coefficients 

significant (t test, P &gt; 0.05).

In general, the experimental values of air velocity and temperature obtained in the nine 

points and three high do not significantly differ from those encountered when simulating 

the model with CFD. This is because the R2 values were mostly high than 0.700, indicating 

that the CFD model is capable of predicting real operating conditions of the open scale 

model of CBP barn with natural ventilation. Thus, the results prove to be promising, given 

that the simulated system depends on several variables such as geometric characteristics of 

the reduced model, roughness, temperature of the compost, orientation of the reduced 

model, type of ridge, others. 

The experimental and CFD simulation values of air velocity and temperature obtained 

in nine locations and three different heights are presented in Figures 4.120 to 4.126. 

The mean values and standard deviations of the air velocities measured for each 

treatment tested using air speed of 0.1 m s-1 and wind direction of south to north were 0.07 

m s-1 (±0.04), 0.04  m s-1 (±0.03), 0.06 m s-1 (±0.03), 0.04 m s-1 (±0.03), 0.05 m s-1 (±0.03), 

respectively. However, the values and standard deviations of the air velocities simulated 

were 0.06 m s-1 (±0.04), 0.05 m s-1 (±0.04), 0.07 m s-1 (±0.04), 0.05 m s-1 (±0.04),  0.05 m 

s-1 (±0.04), respectively, see Figure 4.120. The mean values and standard deviations of the 

air temperature measured for each treatment tested were 24.39°C (±1.61), 24.93°C (±2.01), 

24.72°C (±1.79), 24.70°C (±1.88), and 24.94°C (±1.89), respectively. Moreover, the 

highest mean values and standard deviations of the air velocities and temperature measured 

and simulated using air speed of 1.0 m s-1 were 0.75 m s-1 (±0.37) and 0.73 m s-1 (±0.37), 

respectively, and 24.81°C (±2.44) and 24.74°C (±2.00), respectively, see Figure 4.121. 

The highest mean values measured and simulated air velocity, using air speed of 0.1 m 

s-1and wind direction of north to south were 0.06 m s-1 with a range from 0.00 to 0.13 m s-1 

and 0.06 m s-1 with a range from 0.00 to 0.14 m s-1, respectively. In the same study, the 

highest mean values measured and simulated air velocity were 25.26°C with a range from 

23.00 to 30.00°C and 25.27°C with a range from 23.05 to 29.15°C, respectively, see Figure 

4.122. Thus, analyzing the other air speed tested (1.0 m s-1), the highest mean values 

measured and simulated air velocity and temperature were 0.68 m s-1 (±0.43) and 0.68 m s-1 

(±0.39), respectively, and 24.98°C (±2.02) and 24.70°C(±1.86) respectively (Figure 4.123). 

The highest mean values measured and simulated of air velocity and temperature, using 

air speed of 0.1 m s-1and wind direction of east to west, were 0.10 m s-1 (±0.01) and 0.10 m 

s-1 (±0.02), respectively, for air velocity and 23.89°C (±1.57) and 23.55°C (±1.14), 



219 
 

respectively, for temperature (Figure 4.124). However, using air speed of 1.0 m s-1, the 

highest mean values measured and simulated values of variables studied were 0.96 m s-1 (± 

0.23) and 0.99 m s-1 (±0.28), respectively, and 24.16°C (±0.65) and 23.47°C (±1.27), 

respectively, for these treatments tested as shown in Figure 4.125. 

The mean values and standard deviations of the air velocities simulated and observed, 

using air speed of 0.1 m s-1 and wind direction of west to east, were 0.09 m s-1 (±0.02) and 

0.09 m s-1 (±0.02), respectively, resulting in an average absolute deviation of 0.01 ± 0.01 

and an average error of 0.02, respectively (Figure 4.126). The mean values of the air 

temperature simulated and observed were 23.27°C and 23.47°C, respectively, which 

resulted in an average absolute deviation of 0.74 ± 0.13 and 0.69 ± 0.10, respectively and 

an average error of 1.08 and 1.02, respectively. However, the mean values and standard 

deviations of the air velocities simulated and observed, using air speed of 1.0 m s-1 and the 

same wind direction, were 0.94 m s-1 (±0.22) and 0.95 m s-1 (±0.22), respectively, proving 

in an average absolute deviation of 0.01 ± 0.02 and an average error of 0.02, respectively, 

see Figure 4.127. In the same study, the mean values and standard deviations of the air 

temperature simulated and observed were 23.67°C (±1.20) and 23.44°C (±1.12), 

respectively. In this case, the average absolute deviation 0.90 ± 0.27 and 0.73 ± 0.07, 

respectively. 

Given that the absolute average errors calculated between the values of air velocities 

and temperature measured and simulated are very close to or less than 0.41 m s-1 and 

2.29°C, respectively, the accuracy values of the anemometer (±0.01 m s-1) and thermometer 

(±1.0°C) and that the magnitude of these errors would have little influence on the final 

result for the calculation of the variables studied. Thus, the computer models can be 

considered suitable for the proposed use.

4.4.3. Airflow patterns 

Airflow patterns in the reduced models were analyzed using smoke produced by 

vaporized Glycerin. These studies were conducted at a wind velocity of 0.1 and 1.0 m s-1. 

Similar inside airflow distributions were observed in all in simulated and measured five 

ridge type evaluated when compared with CFD model evaluated with the same wind 

directions. Small differences in flow patterns inside reduced model and CFD were 

observed with different ventilation ridge openings. The smoke was visually observed when 

it was passed through the ridge opening. 

 
4.4.4. Computational simulation 

Application of tests with adapted values and calculated variables found in the field 

were performed to exemplify the application of computational models developed for a CBP 

barn equipped with five different ridge types and four wind directions. 

 
4.4.4.1. Applying computational simulation of the reduced model 

The main conditions used to validate the computational model were used in this study. 

However, the values (1.35 x 1.20 x 0.27 m) used in these CFD simulations correspond to 

CBP barn 24, in which the value of air speed and heat flux of the floor (compost area) were 

0.04 m s-1 and 0.1 W m-2 (details about these values calculated can be seen in Appendix E), 

respectively. The values of air temperature used was 6.9°C (see Table 4.18). 

 

Table 4.18 – Boundary conditions utilized in the CFD model 

Case Location Boundary condition Value 

1 
Inlet 

Average air speed 0.04 m s-1 
Air temperature 6.9°C 

Outlet Atmospheric pressure 0 Pa 
Floor Heat flux 0.1 W m-2 

 

The results of the simulations performed by the computational models provide visual 

demonstration of the impact on air flow through structure and information of the effect of 

the air velocity in cooling an area of the floor (compost area), as can be seen in Figures 

4.128 to 4.172. 



229 
 

Such simulations can help engineers and dairy producers in project development and 

management of the CBP barns. Applying various scenarios and  allowing the simulation to 

aid in the understanding the whole system. 

Figures 4.128 to 4.135 shows the simulated air velocity vectors and temperature 

distribution vertically and on the surface of the floor in CBP barn equipped with closed 

ridge (CLR).  

Figures 4.128a and 4.128b showed that the air entered the CBP barn through the ridge 

opening at one side, and then exited through the sidewall opening located at the other side.  

So, the air flow velocity was reduced due to presence of the wall and fences on both side of 

the barn. It resulted in a internal vortex at the center of the feed alley and compost area.  

In the Figure 4.129, one can observe the effect of cooling the compost surface area near 

the alleyway. From the Figure 4.131, the higher surface temperature in the center of the 

compost area (after down flow from wall) is due to a reduced air velocity which results in 

lower cooling in this area. Figures 4.132 to 4.135 shows the simulated results of air 

velocity and surface temperature on the compost area, when predominant winds enter the 

installation at east to west and west to east. At the Figures 4.132 and 4.134, it can be seen 

that there is a considerable variation in the direction of the air velocity vectors. Inside of 

the trusses structure, it can be seen that the main flow tends to turn opposite the main wind 

direction.  

In Figures 4.133 and 4.135, it can be seen observed that the vortex of the airflow 

promoted the worst conditions of air circulation and the surfaces temperature of the 

compost area were higher on the both sides of the barn. 

The air velocity distribution in a vertical plan situated in the center of the barn allows 

us to determine the inside air speed more precisely. Figure 4.136 shows the air velocity 

distribution in a vertical plan situated in the center of the CBP barn equipped with closed 

ridge (CLR) in four wind direction. As evidenced in Figure 4.136, the higher air velocity 

values was observed near to the compost area in east and west winds. However, in the near 

ridge region, both these winds direction failed to perform well with air velocity values 

around 0.1 m s-1. Outside air velocity values were higher in south and north wind 

directions. This aspect coincides with that of other studies performed by Norton et al. 

(2010b), Majdoubi et al. (2009), Lee et al. (2007), and Koenig et al. (1978).

equipped with closed ridge (CLR) in four wind direction. 

 
Figures 4.137 to 4.145 shows the simulated results of CBP barn equipped with open 

ridge (OPR) in four wind direction.  

According to the Figures 4.137 and 4.139, these barns produced higher ridge vent flows 

for the south and north wind directions at wind velocities above 0.07 m s-1. Wind direction 

comparisons indicated that south winds consistently produced the highest ridge vents flows 

(Figure 137a), however the east and west generated lowest ridge vent flows (Figures 

4.141a and 4.143a). Since wind direction had a large influence on ridge vent flow, building 

orientation with respect to wind direction should be considered in the design of naturally 

ventilated, open ridge, assuming the reduced model exhibit similar airflow characteristics.  

Figures 4.141 and 4.143 shown the reduction of air velocity inside the trusses structure. 

It can be seen that the main flow tends to turn opposite the main wind direction. Highest 

values of temperature on the surface of the compost area were observed with wind 

direction of north (Figure 4.140). By comparison, wind direction of east and west shown 

the lowest values of surface temperature on the compost area (Figures 4.142 and 4.144, 

respectively). 

Figure 4.145 shows the air velocity distribution in a vertical plan situated in the centre 

of the CBP barn equipped with open ridge (OPR) in four wind direction. Examination of 

the air velocity inside the barn above the compost area surface, demonstrates that the 

values are very close at 0.2 m height from ground. However, one can remark that the air 

velocity values in south and north winds directions rapid increase at ridge area.

Figure 4.145 - Profile of mean horizontal wind speed in the centre of the CBP barn 
equipped with open ridge (OPR) in four wind direction. 

 
Figures 4.146 to 4.153 shows the simulated results of CBP barn equipped with open 

ridge with chimney (ORC) in four wind direction. Figures 4.146 and 4.148 show 

considerable variation in the direction of the air velocity vectors, and consequently the flow 

is far from being two-dimensional. Near the ridge opening, it can be seen that center of 

turbulence is located above the roof in the right (Figure 4.146a) and left (Figure 4146b) 

side. From the Figure 4.148a, the north wind direction, which produced the highest ridge 

vent flows, also generated high air velocities inside the structure. So, the contour plot of the 

value of the vertical component of wind speed which is also shown in Figures 4.146 and 

4.148 reveals periodic air circulation loops due to buoyancy forces with horizontal axes 

which develop perpendicularly to the wind. 

Distribution of surface temperature on the compost area are represented in Figures 

4.147, 4.149, 4.151, and 4.153. It can be observed that the distribution temperature on the 

compost area in wind direction north (Figure 4.149) is more uniform than east (Figure 

4.151) and west (Figure 4.153). This result can be explained by the fact that the air velocity 

distribution is almost uniform in near entire compost area. In contrast, when the wind 

direction were east and west, the air movement tends to stabilize, generating lower air 

velocity above the compost area. Figure 4.154 shows the air velocity distribution in a 

vertical plan situated in the center of the CBP barn equipped with open ridge with chimney 

(ORC) in four wind direction. The air velocity value above the compost area is lower in 

south and north wind direction due to drag effect of the sidewall and sidewall planks. The 

air velocity values were lower near ridge opening in east and west wind direction.

Figure 4.154 - Profile of mean horizontal wind speed in the centre of the CBP barn 
equipped with open ridge with chimney (ORC) in four wind direction. 

 
Figures 4.155 to 4.162 shows the simulated results of CBP barn equipped with elevated 

ridge (ELR) in four wind direction. The higher ridge vent outlet flow was visualized in 

CBP barn equipped with ELR ridge type using east and west winds direction (Figure 

4.155a and 4.157a). The wind flows up the windward wall surface and above the roof of 

the barns with east and west winds (Figures 4.159a and 4.161a) but hits the roof inside the 

barn with south and north winds (see Figures 4.155a and 4.157a). In addition, a lower 

pressure area is created above the roof in the east and west winds than above the south and 

north winds, thereby generating higher ridge opening flows. 

Figures 4.155b, 4.157b, 4.159b, and 4.161b represents the air temperature distribution 

vertically by convection and Figures 4.156, 4.158, 4.160, and 4.162 shown the temperature 

distribution on the surface of the compost area. The worst uniformity in surface 

temperature was observed in compost area tested with north wind direction (Figures 4.158) 

in relation to other winds direction, which may be due to the fact that air flux over the 

compost area is less uniform. 

Figure 4.163 shows the air velocity distribution in a vertical plan situated in the center 

of the CBP barn equipped with elevated ridge (ELR) in four wind direction.  In general, 

this shows that the average air speed in the space between the top of the compost area and 

the barn roof is approximately half that of the outside wind, for all wind directions. Air 

velocity is much lower inside the barn than outside and its flows through ridge opening 

systematically higher in south and north wind directions.

Figures 4.164 to 4.171 shows a representation of air velocity vectors, and temperature 

distribution vertically and on the surface of the floor when overshot ridge (OVR) was 

equipped in four wind direction, respectably.  

The turbulence of the airflow formed above the roof in simulated barn with south winds 

(Figure 4.164a) is smaller than simulated barn with north winds (Figure 4.166a). Therefore, 

as can be seen in Figures 4.168a and 4.170a, the turbulence zone was situated after barn at 

windward gable wall height in simulated barn with east and west winds. The south and 

north winds direction created the lowest air velocity values differences (Figures 4.164 and 

4.166) and east and west winds produced the highest air velocity values differences 

(Figures 4.168 and 4.170). Airflow enters through both sides the opening wall and owing to 

density differences between the inside and outside air, immediately drops to the floor. This 

airflow then travels toward the center of the building, heating up as it passes over the 

compost area before it eventually rises (see Figures 4.164 and 4.166). A similar observation 

has already been reported by Norton et al. (2010a). 

The highest surface temperature distribution differences on compost area was observed 

in the east and west winds direction (Figures 4.169 and 4.171). The lowest surface 

temperature differences on compost area was generally noted south winds (Figure 4.165). 

Figure 4.172 shows the air velocity distribution in a vertical plan situated in the center 

of the CBP barn equipped with overshot ridge (OVR) in four wind direction. The air 

velocity show approximately the same values at 0.02 m above the compost area for all 

winds direction tested, but values strongly decreases near the ridge opening in the east and 

west winds direction, then increases progressively from the ridge opening.

Overall, one can summarise the complex airflow as follows:  

a) In general, wind direction indicates that air would approximately move along the 

length of the barns as opposed to the width or across the barn. The ridge openings 

noticeably increased the inside air velocities for all the wind directions studied except for 

the east and west direction. However, in this case, low air velocities were observed inside 

the trusses structure and near the ridge opening; 

b) The airflow patterns were visually higher in all ridge openings tested with wind 

direction of south and north. With east and west winds higher airflows were observed in the 

windward ends of the ridge vents than was noted downwind. The airflow patterns for east 

and west winds also showed that inside the trusses structure the air generally flowed in the 

opposite direction of the outside winds. With a south and north wind the inside airflow near 

the trusses structures were generally in the same direction as the outside air. South and 

north winds produced a swirling action inside the all CFD models with most of the air 

exiting from the opening wall. This condition was probably due to a slight difference in the 

outside airflow; 

c) CBP barn model geometry effects the surface temperature difference on compost 

area were visibly significant through the air temperature distribution on the surface of the 

floor inside the CBP barns in the previous figures for all ridge opening tested and direction 

of the wind; and 

d) Air loops fed by buoyancy forces due to the inside air temperature differences 

develop perpendicularly between the top of the compost area and bottom of the roof vent 

openings.

4.4.4.2. Evaluation of the types of ridge vents and wind direction 

Maintaining active composting in a compost bedded pack barn is a real challenge 

during the winter months. It becomes difficult to start or restart a compost bedded pack 

barn in winter with low bacterial activity since heat losses can easily exceed heat 

generated. Because of this, to select the best condition of ventilation in the winter weather 

with reduced cooling of the surface of the bed, the CFD models were evaluated in function 

of five types of ridge vents (CLR, OPR, ORC, ELR, and OVR) and four wind direction 

(North, South, East, and West) to promote greater percentage heated surfaces of the floor. 

The analyzes of variance for variables five types of ridge vents and four wind direction 

in function of percentage of heated floor area are showing in Table 4.19. There is not a 

statistically significant difference (p&gt; 0.05) between types of ridge vents (P = 0.716) and 

wind direction (P = 0.874).

The mean values of percentage of heated floor area in five types of ridge vents and 

four wind direction are showing in Table 4.20. Table 4.20 shows that the highest 

percentage of heated floor of the surface area inside the CFD models were observed in 

treatments ORC and W to E (Tukey test; p &amp;lt;0.05). Type of ridge vent and wind direction 

that promoted greater cooling surface of the floor were the treatments ELR and S to N 

(Tukey test; p &amp;lt;0.05). Details about statistical analysis can be seen in Appendix F (Table 

20).

Once CFD modeling returns results based on temperature variations of the total area in 

function of the composting area size into barns, highest heating and wind direction 

percentage can probably be a indicative where the composting process will be occurring 

with better efficiency or, in other words, what kind of ridge opening will be better to 

maintain ideal microbiological conditions in terms of aeration and temperature with range 

of 45 a 60°C, as described early. These results showed that the best ridge vent and wind 

direction in the winter weather was observed in the open ridge with chimney (ORC) and 

West to East, respectively. Therefore, open ridge with chimney (ORC) positioned from 

West to East can possibly be the best barn design with better efficiency among those barns 

who were studied.

5 - CONCLUSION 

The following conclusions were drawn based on the experimental study of 42 compost 

bedded pack (CBP) barns in Kentucky: 

 
a) Overall, dairies producers visited in Kentucky were very satisfied with their compost 

barns. They observed that cows were more comfortable and that this housing system 

resulted in increased cow cleanliness. The compost bedding pack (CBP) barns in 

Kentucky of this study had a variety of building designs. Majority of these barns had 

feed alleys and driveways. Most frequent barn orientation was NE to SW.  The primary 

types of barn ridge found in the barns were overshot ridges. Most of barns had roof pitch 

of 4:12. The majority of barns was equipped with box fans. Air temperatures tended to 

be lower indoor the barns which utilized overshot or capped ridge, forced ventilation 

system and ridge direction of SW or NW. The average relative humidity in this study 

was approximately 65.0%. In general, wind direction was approximately transverse to 

the barns length direction and the air velocity was 1.0 m s-1. In addition, air quality and 

possible dust issues in compost dairy barns need to be evaluated. 

 
b) The bedding materials more used in the CBP barns was kild-dried sawdust. However, 

most dairies producers preferred to use green sawdust rather than the kild-dried sawdust, 

because this material was harmful or beneficial to the composting bed. Moreover, green 

sawdust was not absorb as much water as kiln-dried sawdust. Pack temperatures 

indicated that some of the bedding materials were not able to support microbial activity 

and produce heat. Average Pack moisture content was 59.0% (± 9.0) wet basis. Our 

observations indicate moisture content should be between 40-60%. Most of the barns in 

Kentucky had their compost aerated to a depth below 0.25 m, twice a day in the summer 

and winter time, while cows were away at the parlor, most often using a chisel plow on a 

small tractor. Bedding management is critical to encourage microbial activity, minimize 

pathogen exposure, and maintain cow cleanliness. Further research is necessary 

regarding the effect of different climatic conditions on the composting processes. 

 
c) A comparison of the particle weight fraction distributions content reveals that these 

bedding compost materials found in CBP barns are very different. The results indicated 

that the distribution of mass weight increased in the order of Coarser to Finer. The 



258 
 

average finer index expressed as weight percent in the samples studied was 30.1%, 

implying excessive water retention and low aeration.  

 
d) Generally, some compost bedding materials showed high particle density (? 1g cm-3) 

compared with other materials. Indeed, these values were higher than expected, but can 

likely be tied to the presence of carbonates and other inorganic media such as soil 

particles contained within the compost samples. The higher bulk density value was 3.6 

times that of the lower bulk density value. This investigation also showed that porosity 

is potentially dependent (reverse order) on bulk density although the statistical 

significance of this relation was high. 

 
e) Water Holding Capacity (WHC) increases with increasingly fine particle size. Coarse 

particle size of compost have a lower WHC since they are high in large pores subject to 

free drainage. Fine particle size have a greater occurrence of small pores that hold water 

against free drainage, resulting in a higher WHC values. In this study, WHC increased 

with increasing moisture content until certain level. Therefore, compost bedding 

material with good physical and chemical properties helps to increase the WHC of 

bedding compost, reduces natural drainage and runoff of the moisture (urine and faeces) 

through surface of compost, and consequently improves their moisture content. Further 

research is needed to investigate the influence of moisture content measurement on the 

determination of WHC. 

 
f)  Pack chemical characteristics were almost similar to all bedding materials. Thus, many 

dairy producers can use the bedding compost to fertilizer their crop fields and avoid 

over-applying nutrients and reduce water pollution. Bedding compost always contained 

bacterial, but the variation was large between different sampling sites and times. 

However, Coliforms was not present in barns that had a higher compost temperature. 

Coliforms, E. Coli, Bacillus and Streptococcus count were higher in the barns that 

showed lower moisture content.  

 
g) Generally, the thermal conductivity increased with increasing particle size, while 

thermal resistivity decreased with increasing particle size. This behavior can probably 

be explained by considering the higher moisture retention of larger particles once 

compost materials were air dried at the same time. It could possibly have changed the 



259 
 

values of the thermal properties. Thus, the tendency thermal conductivity as a function 

of particle size was very consistent at particle size below than 4.75 mm and  thermal 

resistivity showed an pronounced decrease in compost particle size between 4.75 and 

5.60 mm. Thus, results above indicate that the thermal properties are strongly dependent 

on particle size.  However, further studies should be carried out to confirm their positive 

effects. 

 
h) In the present study, an increasing trend in the thermal conductivity of all compost 

materials was also observed with the increase in both moisture content and static and 

dynamic compaction degree for all compost material tested. In contrast, an increasing 

trend in the thermal resistivity of bed compost was observed with the decrease in both 

moisture content and static and dynamic compaction degree. The first order regression 

models developed in this study represent the relationship of degree of moisture content 

and static and dynamic compaction versus thermal conductivity and thermal resistivity 

as well. The resulting thermal properties of compost bedding materials can be used to 

develop heat transfer models for the design of more optimal temperature control in 

compost bedding pack systems. 

 
i)  A 3-D CFD model was established to graphically show the air velocity and temperature 

distribution in a CBP barns using different ridge vents opening with natural ventilation. 

The developed model provided good agreement with experimental measurements and it 

was able to identify the impact on air flow through structure in a CBP barns. To date 

most published works on CFD simulation for dairy building have been 2-D, and only 

ventilation has been modeled with 3-D CFD. We hope this developed model can 

contribute to the optimum design for CBP barn construction. It should also provide 

guidelines for modifying existing CBP barns towards more uniform and optimum 

temperature and air movement distribution, thus increasing air quality and cow comfort. 

Research employing this model or other models with similar characteristics is needed to 

simulate more accurately the effect on air flow through structure in CBP barns with 

dairy cows. These results showed that the best ridge vent and wind direction in the 

winter weather was ORC positioned from West to East can possibly be the best barn 

design with better efficiency among those barns who were studied.

Determination of ? groups 

The number of dimensional parameter is n and r is the number of primary dimensions. 

So, dimensional parameter is n = 14 and primary dimensions is k = 4. Using four selected 

repeating variable (l , v , T , and	? ) which together must contain L, M, T, and ?. 

Therefore, n - k = 10 ? groups, forming the dimensionless groups are obtained: 

 

Number of physical quantities: n = 14 

Number of basic dimensions: k = 4 

Pi term number: n – k = 10

D.2 - The dimensionless groups found 

D.2.1 - Reynolds number (Re): 

? ?	 ?	l ? v ? ? 1/R   

 

The Reynolds number (Re) expresses the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces, 

defined by Re = V L ?
-1 = V L ? ?-1. 

 
Where, V: velocity of the fluid, (m s-1); L: dimension, (m); ?: kinematic viscosity, (m2 s-1); 

?: dynamic viscosity, (kg m-1 s-1); and ?: density of the fluid, (kg m-3). 

 
D.2.2 - Eckert number (Ec): 

? c ? v ? T 1/E    

 



374 
 

The Eckert number (Ec) is used to calculate flow. It is expresses the relationship 

between a flow`s kinetic energy and enthalpy, thus is used to characterize dissipation. It is 

defined as E
	?	?

kinect energy/enthalpy. 

 
where, Cp: specific heat of the fluid, (J kg

-1 K-1); and ?t: temperature difference of the flow, 

(K). 

 
D.2.3 - Prandtl number (Pr): 

?	
? ? c ? k  = Pr 

 
Prandtl number (Pr) is the ratio of momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity) to 

thermal diffusivity. The Pr is defined as: 

Pr = 
?

?
 = 

Viscous diffusion rate

Thermal diffusion rate
 = 

Cp ?	?

k
  

 
where, ?: thermal diffusivity, (m2 s-1); and k: thermal conductivity, (W m-1 K-1). 

 
D.2.4 - Peclet number (Pe): 

?	 ? c 	? v ? l ? k R ? P   

 

Peclet number (Pe) is the ratio between the rates of heat transfer by conduction and 

advection, defined by V ? L ? ? R ? P . 

 
D.2.5 - Grashof  number (Gr): 

?	 	?	 	?	 	?	 	 	

	
G ? ? 	  

 

The Grashof number is a dimensionless quantity used in analyzing the velocity 

distribution in free convection systems. In the systems encountered most commonly in 

CBP barns, free convection is the natural tendency of the wind (air movement) to migrate 

due to some driving force. In free convection, the driving force is a buoyancy force caused 

by a temperature gradient, as the fluid would be at rest in the absence of temperature 

variations. The Grashof number is analogous to the Reynolds number in forced convection.  

 



375 
 

D.2.6 - Nusselt  number (Nu): 

	 	h 	? 	l	 ? 	k Nu 	

 

A dimensionless number used in the study of forced convection which gives a measure 

of the ratio of the total heat transfer to conductive heat transfer, and is equal to the heat 

transfer coefficient times a characteristic length divided by the thermal conductivity. 

 
D.3 - Calculate of air speed and floor surface temperature to the full model 

a) Air speed in the full model: 

Re Re

Then,

So, scale used in this reduce model was 1:16,

V  =

According Table 4.1, the air speed found in the Barn 24, which was used as a base to 

build the reduced model, was 0.7 m s-1. Then, 

 
V 0.7	m	s /	16 

V 	0.04	m	s  

 
b) Temperature of the floor in the full model: 

Using the Pi terms found in Appendix - Table C.2: 

? Q ? l ? v ? ?

Q ? l ? v ? ? Q ? l ? v ? ?   

? ?   

Then, 

Q ? l ? v Q ? l ? v   

lmodel = 1.35 m (Figure 3.22); 

vw model  = 0.04 m s
-1 

lfull = 21.6 m 

vw model  = 0.7 m s
-1 (Table 4.1) 

 
So, using these values in the equation above: 

 
Q ? 1.35 ? 0.04 Q ? 21.6 ? 0.7   

Q 7.97 ? 10 ? Q   

 
Calculating the heat flux in the compost area: 

i) Average temperatures: floor surface (Ts), compost at 0.2 m deep (Tc), and the 

environment (Tair): 

Ts = 7.2°C = 280.35 K ? Appendix - Table A.4 ? Barn 24; 

Tair = 6.9°C = 280.05 K ? Table 4.1? Barn 24; 

 
ii) Properties of the mean air temperature (Values in Appendix - Table D.3): 

Variable Value Unit (S.I) 

? 1.2613 kg m-3 

? 1.39 ·10-5 m2 s-1 

k 0.024626 W m?1 K?1

L 21.6 m 

Pr 0.718  

 

G g ? ? ? T T ? L ? ?   

G 5.46 ? 10   

 



377 
 

For calculating the Nusselt number (Nu) of equation (D.2.6), is recommended by 

McAdams (1954) using the equation (D.2.7) for Gr &gt; 109 where the heat transfer 

coefficient is independent of the length (L). 

N 0.13 ? Gr ? Pr / 951.4 (E.1) 

Then, the coefficients of heat transfer is: 
 

h
k	?	

L
1.08 W	m-2 K?1 

 

The heat transfer in the full scale CBP barn is: 

Qfull = h · A · ?T 

Qfull = 106.8 W 

 

So, 

Q 7.97 ? 10 ? Q   
 

The value of heat flux (q"model)  is:
