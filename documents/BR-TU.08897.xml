RESUMO 

Cinética de dessorção e especiação de Zn, Pb and Cd em um solo contaminado por 

atividades de mineração e tratado com calcita, fosfato, biocarvão e biossólido 

Áreas de mineração produzem grandes quantidades de resíduos que são importantes 

fontes de elementos potencialmente tóxicos (EPT), tais como os metais pesados. Esses EPTs 

podem contaminar o meio ambiente e causar sérias ameaças ao ecossistema e à saúde humana. A 

remediação in-situ pela adição de condicionadores é alternativa eficiente para a imobilização de 

contaminantes e para redução dos riscos associados a esses poluentes. Fosfato, calcita e compostos 

orgânicos são os condicionadores mais utilizadas para remediação in-situ. Neste estudo foi 

avaliado o efeito da aplicação de condicionadores na cinética de dessorção e especiação de Zn, Cd 

e Pb em um solo contaminado por atividades de mineração. O solo foi coletado em uma área 

desativada de mineração de Zn, localizada na cidade de Vazante, MG. A solo contaminado foi 

incubado com fosfato, carbonato de cálcio, biocarvão ou biossólido. A cinética de dessorção foi 

avaliada pelo método fluxo constante com a solução de Mehlich-3. A especiação foi realizada por 

espectroscopia de absorção de raios-x (XAS) e extração sequencial, enquanto a análise absorção de 

raios-x próxima da borda (XANES) foi realizada para Pb e Zn. Também realizamos o mapeamento 

por ?-XRF (microfluorescência de raios-x) e em alguns pontos no mapa realizamos a especiação 

por ?-XANES do Zn no solo tratado com fosfato. Foi também conduzido um experimento com 

colunas para avaliar a lixiviação de Zn, Pb e Cd no solo tratado com fosfato. A adição de fosfato 

afetou as espécies de Zn. No entanto, algumas espécies de Zn que foram formadas e assim podem 

ser mobilizadas com mais facilidade. O Zn foi mais facilmente mobilizado na maior taxa de 

fosfato, provavelmente devido à diminuição do pH. Os tratamentos com biossólido, biocarvão e 

calcita não alteraram as espécies de Zn. No entanto, em algumas doses, a dessorção de Zn 

diminuiu, enquanto o teor de Zn aumentou na fração recalcitrante. As principais espécies no solo 

sem alterações foram a bentonita Pb e a anglesita. O solo corrigido com calcita diminuiu a cinética 

de dessorção do Pb e aumentou o Pb extraído na fração residual, o que pode ser devido à formação 

de piromorfita. Os solos tratados com biossólido e com biocarvão aumentaram o teor de Pb 

associado à matéria orgânica e diminuíram na fração residual. Nestes tratamentos parte das 

espécies de Pb presentes neste solo foi transformada em Pb ligado a citrato. Essas alterações 

orgânicas aumentaram substancialmente a cinética de dessorção do Pb em todas as doses 

adicionadas. Os tratamentos com biocarvão e com biossólido foram efetivos para diminuir a 

dessorção de Cd. Nestas alterações orgânicas o Cd associado à matéria orgânica aumentou. Os 

tratamentos com fosfato e calcita também aumentaram o teor de Cd na fração orgânica. Essas 

alterações inorgânicas também foram eficazes para diminuir a cinética de dessorção do Cd.

ABSTRACT 

Desorption kinetics and speciation of Zn, Pb and Cd in a soil contaminated by mining 

activities amended with limestone, phosphate, biochar and biosolids 

Mining areas produce large amounts of waste that are important sources of potentially 

toxic elements (PTE), such as heavy metals. These PTEs can contaminate the environment and 

cause serious threats to the ecosystem and human health. The in-situ remediation by the addition of 

amendments is an efficient alternative for the immobilization of contaminants and for reduction of 

the risks associated with these pollutants. Phosphate, lime, and organic compounds are the most 

used amendments for in-situ remediation. We evaluated the effect of rates of amendments in 

desorption kinetics and speciation of Zn, Cd, and Pb in a soil contaminated by mining activities. 

The soil was collected in a disabled Zn mining area in the city of Vazante, state of Minas Gerais, 

Brazil. The contaminated soil was incubated with either phosphate, or calcium carbonate, or 

biochar, or biosolid. Desorption kinetics was evaluated by the "stirred-flow" method that consists of 

a constant flow with a Mehlich-3 solution. The speciation was performed by X-ray absorption 

spectroscopy (XAS) and sequential extraction. The analysis with synchrotron radiation X-ray 

absorption near the edge (XANES) was performed for Pb and Zn. We also performed a mapping by 

?-XRF (micro X-ray fluorescence) and in some spots on the map we performed the speciation by ?-

XANES for Zn in the soil amended with phosphate. An experiment with columns was carried out 

with samples from the soil amended with phosphate to evaluate leaching of Zn, Pb, and Cd. The 

treatment with phosphate affected the species of Zn. However, some Zn species that were formed 

and can be mobilized most easily. Zn was more easily mobilized in the highest rate of phosphate 

probably because of the decrease of the pH. The treatments with biosolid, biochar and calcite did 

not change Zn species. However, in some rates, Zn desorption decreased while Zn contents 

increased in the recalcitrant fraction. The main species in the unamended soil was Pb-bentonite and 

anglesite. The soil amended with calcite and pyromorphite decreased the desorption kinetics of Pb 

and increased the Pb extracted in the residual fraction, and this could be due to formation of 

pyromorphite. The soil amended with biosolid and biochar increased the Pb extracted in the organic 

fraction and decreased in the residual fraction. In these treatments part of the species of Pb present 

on this soil was transformed in Pb-citrate. The addition of biochar and biosolid increased the 

desorption kinetics of Pb in all rates applied. The treatment with either biochar or biosolid was 

effective to decrease the Cd desorption. In these organic amendments, the content of Cd associated 

to organic matter (OM)increased. The treatments with phosphate and calcite also increased the Cd 

associated to OM extracted in the F3. These inorganic amendments were effective to decrease the 

desorption kinetics of Cd.

1 INTRODUCTION 

Activities of mining and processing of metals are of important because it ensures the 

production of raw material for the manufacture of goods which are indispensable for the man 

and provide many other benefits to society and the development of the country. However, the 

environmental damage they cause can be large, thus posing a serious threat to ecosystems and 

human health. These activities have resulted in a generation of high amount of waste, which is 

a great source of trace elements, such as cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn), and 

consequently, may cause a substantial environmental contamination (Alloway, 2013). 

The metals/pollutants can enter the human body through ingestion, inhalation, dermal 

contact, which represents a considerable threat to humans (Bi et al., 2006; Pelfrêne et al., 

2011). Adverse environmental impacts of contaminated mining areas include the risk to 

human health, the phytotoxicity, contamination of water and soil and the ecotoxicity (Anju; 

Banerjee, 2010). In response, the development of technologies to remediate heavy metals 

contaminated soils has been encouraged (Gray et al., 2006). 

Techniques for remediation of soils based on the excavation and the deposition on the 

landfill are highly effective in reducing the risk, but they are very expensive (Basta; 

Mcgowen, 2004). Furthermore, the engineering technologies are often invasive and do not 

allow natural recovery of the environment (Lombi et al., 2002). Innovative and low-cost 

techniques are required for decontamination of soils. A promising technology is the 

stabilization in situ of heavy metals in soil by the addition of amendments, such as phosphates 

(Baker et al., 2014; Sanderson et al., 2015) alkaline materials (Ok et al., 2010; Basta et al., 

2004), biochars (Puga et al., 2016; Abdelhafez et al., 2014) and organic compounds 

(Ahumada et al., 2014; Sindhu et al., 2016). 

In situ stabilization of metals is based on the reduction of metal mobility and 

availability, either by precipitation or by increased sorption (Lee et al., 2009). The use of soil 

amendments may decrease the solubility of metals and reduce their harmful effects on 

microorganisms, plants, aquatic organisms and humans (Lombi et al., 2002). 

Possible mechanisms to explain the increase in retention and/or immobilization of 

metals, in the presence of P, include (i) the formation of phosphate of metals, which are low 

soluble precipitates in soils (Crannell et al., 2000), (ii) increase in negative net charge (Peres-

Novo et al., 2009) and availability of surface phosphate groups in which metals can associate 

to form ternary complex (Guilherme; Anderson, 1998). Phosphorus is able to neutralize 

completely or partially or even reverse the positive charge prevalent on the surface of Fe and 

Al hydroxides in acidic soils (Lima et al., 2000). 



14 

 

 

 

The addition of alkaline compounds such as calcium carbonate increases the retention 

of metals in soils due to the increase in pH and has a great influence on the solubility of 

metals (Adriano, 2001). A high soil pH may precipitate the metals as hydroxides, phosphates, 

and carbonates and also promote the formation of quite stable metal-organic complexes 

(Kabata, 2011). However, precipitates formed due to the application of calcium carbonate can 

be easily dissolved and released into the soil solution. Carbonates of Pb can be easily 

dissolved by organic acids released by the rhizosphere of plants, easily extracted by acidic 

solutions and easily dissolved in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals (Essington, 

2005). 

Organic materials such as organic fertilizer and biochar can immobilize the metals by 

means of adsorption, complexation, and precipitation reactions. This occurs because of: (i) the 

increase of cationic exchange capacity (CEC) of the soils that promotes the increase of 

adsorption of metals, and (ii) the formation of insoluble and soluble complex with the organic 

constituents because of high affinity for heavy metals by functional groups of the organic 

compounds (Bolan et al., 2014). 

One of the objectives of the addition of amendments is to reduce the leaching of 

metals in the soil profile, thus decreasing the risks of contamination of groundwater. A 

leaching study in columns can give us important information about the potential of 

remediators in decreasing the leaching of metals. This study is necessary to evaluate the 

immobilization and to evaluate if the treatment has reduced or increased concentrations of 

metals in the leachate. Houben et al. (2012) evaluated the leaching of heavy metals in a 

Technosol in an urban area from Liège, eastern Belgium, and observed that the addition of 

calcium carbonate reduced the concentrations in the leachate in 88% for Cd, 98% for Zn and 

57% for Pb.  

The speciation of metals in contaminated soils is an important tool for development 

and understanding of processes and reaction mechanisms that control the transport of 

nutrients and contaminants. By knowing the species present in soil, it is possible to obtain 

information on which phases control the bioavailability of metals and their kinetics of release 

(Sparks, 2014). 

The distribution of heavy metals in soil fractions may be evaluated by indirect 

methods, such as the sequential extraction. However, direct methods of determination based 

on the spectroscopy absorption of X-rays have been developed. Methods of analysis spectral 

features of X-rays provide information about the dispersion of the elements and contribute to 



15 

 

identify the phases of mineral in the soils, for obtaining the mechanisms of sorption on a 

molecular level and the speciation of atomic structure site (Lombi and Susini, 2009). Such 

methods guarantee the selectivity and sensitivity of the local structure of a wide variety of 

elements, a high spatial resolution, and limit of detection and a simple preparation of the 

sample, which makes this method the most accurate in the study of the composition of 

contaminants in soils (Nevidomskaya et al., 2015). 

The X-ray absorption near the edge (XANES) and the X-ray absorption fine structure 

(EXAFS) are spectroscopic techniques that provide essential information about the forms of 

heavy metals in the soil (Manceau et al., 2002). XANES is used to assist in the study of the 

electronic structure of substances, the determination of the symmetry and the energy of 

molecular orbitals vague in molecules (Soldatov, 2008). This method can provide information 

about the degree of oxidation and the symmetry of its sphere of coordination (Singh and 

Graefe, 2010). The absorption of X-rays is widely used in the speciation of metals in soils 

after addition of amendments (Baker et al., 2012, 2014; Montenegro et al., 2015; Sanderson et 

al., 2015).  

The integration of studies of kinetics, leaching, and speciation provide important 

information about which chemical processes (precipitation, complexation, a formation of 

complexes of the internal or external sphere) will occur with metals present in the soil after 

the addition of amendments. With this information, one can create new strategies for 

remediation in situ of contaminated soil, thereby minimizing its mobility and bioavailability.

2 ORGANIC AND INORGANIC AMENDMENTS ON THE SPECIATION AND 

DESORPTION KINETICS OF ZINC FROM MINE-WASTE IMPACTED 

TROPICAL SOIL  

Abstract 

Mining activities play an important role in business endeavors in the Brazilian economy.  

However, they may generate several environmental problems such as soil pollution. Zinc (Zn) is an 

element essential to plants and humans, but it can also be toxic to human beings, plants, animals, 

and microorganisms in high concentrations. The in-situ stabilization of heavy metals by the addition 

of amendments may be an effective and cost-effective strategy to decrease the risks associated with 

such heavy metals. The soil utilized in our study was collected from a deactivated mining area 

located in Vazante, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil and was amended with rates of phosphate, 

calcite, biochar, and biosolids to immobilize the Zn on the soil. After the addition of these 

amendments, the soil was incubated for 60 days with deionized water at 70% of maximum water 

retention. The soil was chemically and mineralogically characterized, and we performed sequential 

extraction, desorption kinetics and speciation using synchrotron-based techniques, such as µ-

XANES, µ-XRF, and bulk XANES. The soil amended with phosphate was the only one that had 

different species of Zn identified by using linear combination fitting. In the course of these 

treatments gahnite, Zn-LDH, Zn3(PO4), ZnO were identified by bulk XANES, while Zn-

ferrihydrite, Zn-montmorillonite and Scholzite were also identified by µ-XANES. The best fit 

combination for bulk XANES were standards for all other treatments including Zn-montmorillonite, 

Zn-kerolite, Zn-ferrihydrite and gahnite, and these species were also identified by the µ-XANES. 

The soil amended with phosphate had total correlation and partial correlation with Ni, Co, Fe, Cr, 

Mn, Si, P, Cd, Pb and Cd, while the unamended soil had correlation with Cu, Pb, Fe and Si. 

Excluding the highest rate of P, the quarter rate and half rate which decreased the desorption 

kinetics of Zn. Calcite and the organic amendments (biochar and biosolids) were also effective in 

reducing the Zn desorption kinetics.

2.1 Introduction 

More than 2,647 mining areas in Brazil account for almost 5% of the Brazilian Gross 

Domestic Product and 20% of total jobs.1 Mining and smelting activities, however, are 

projected to generate 11.4 million metric tons of waste between 2010 and 2030.1 In 2014, 

Brazil produced 170 kiloton of Zn, which is about 1.5% of world production.2 Part of this 

production is from mining areas in the Vazante region, located in the state of Minas Gerais,3 

home to one of the major known deposits of non-sulfide zinc in the world.4 

Mining wastes typically present a high content of potentially toxic elements such as zinc 

(Zn), lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) that are usually found on the surface of soils.5 Once 

mobilized in soils, these elements can be transferred to groundwater and plants, and present a 

potential threat to threaten human health.6 Although Zn is an element essential to the 

metabolism of plants and animals,7 in excess it can lead to toxicity.

Most soils from the humid tropics are particularly unique because they are highly 

weathered (e.g., Oxisols) and rich in Fe, Al, and Mn (hydr)oxide minerals that have 

predominantly pH-dependent surface charge.8 These (hydr)oxide minerals immobilize heavy-

metal cations such as Zn2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+ at high pH (&gt; 7),9 and oxyanions such as H2AsO4
- 

and HSeO3
- at low pH (&amp;lt;7).10 Mine soils usually present pH values near to 7.11 However, this 

value can decrease over time due to high precipitation and temperature, thereby increasing the 

availability of toxic trace elements.8 Brazil has the potential to increase soil contamination by 

zinc and other metals as a result of different processes, such as fertilizer application and 

smelter and mining activities.12 New strategies are necessary to reduce the risks associated 

with these heavy metals because the utilization of techniques based on excavation and 

deposition at landfills becomes unfeasible.  

Innovative and cost-effective techniques are required for the decontamination of soils. A 

promising technology is the in situ stabilization of heavy metals by the addition of 

amendments such as phosphate,13,14 alkaline materials,15,16 biochar,17,18 and organic 

compounds.19,20 These amendments are reported to reduce the environmental risks associated 

with heavy metals in soils by the formation of low soluble salts or precipitates, and increased 

sorption.21 Understanding the chemical environment of heavy metals in the soils is an 

important step towards a rational use of the amendments, which can optimize the effects of 

such treatments. Synchrotron radiation techniques such as X-ray fluorescence microanalysis 

(Micro-XRF) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) are the best 

techniques to know the metal speciation and their possible associations in complex 

environmental media due to their selectivity of elements studied and due to their high 

resolution. These techniques  are state-of-art tools that can probe Zn local atomic structure in 

soils, minerals and sediments.22–25 

In this study we aimed to characterize Zn desorption and speciation from a mine-

waste affected Brazilian soil. Zinc speciation and desorption kinetics were investigated before 

and after the addition of the following amendments: NH4H2PO4, CaCO3, Biochar, and 

Biosolid. We used the synchrotron-based Micro-XRF and XANES, stirred-flow kinetic 

approach, and sequential extraction. The information provided in this study will be important 

to creating new strategies for in-situ stabilization of Zn in tropical soils impacted by mine-

waste.

2.2 Materials and Methods 

2.2.1 Soil Sampling and Characterization 

Soil samples of a Technosol were collected from the surface layer (0-20 cm) of a Zn 

mining area located in Vazante, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil (close to geographic 

coordinates (17o59’11’’S, 46o54’27”W). The soil was air dried at room temperature and 

passed through a 2-mm sieve for further analysis. Soil organic C content was determined with 

a Shimadzu TOC-5000. The pseudo-total concentrations of Cd, Pb and Zn in the soil sample 

were extracted according to the EPA3051a method (1:3 HCl/HNO3, v/v)
26 and quantified by 

inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Other chemical 

analyses (exchangeable ions and pH) followed the methods of Ingram and Anderson.27 XRD 

was performed in the bulk soil, the clay, sand, and silt fractions. We also performed XRD in 

the clay fraction after both concentrating the iron oxides with 5 M NaOH, 28 and applying 

treatment with sodium dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB) for removing the free iron 

oxides.29 More information about the XRD procedure can be found in the Supporting 

Information Available section. 

 

2.2.2 Production and Characterization of Biochar and Biosolid 

The biochar was produced from sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) straw with 

pyrolysis at 450oC. Detailed information about the production and characterization are 

described in Feola Conz et al.30. The biosolid was produced from the composting of wood 

chips (eucalyptus) and sewage sludge. The composting took place in aerated rows for 60 days 

and was sieved through a mesh with 36 mm2 holes. In the composting process, about 2% of 

dolomitic limestone was added to the sludge. The sewage sludge was collected at a sewage 

treatment station located in Jundiai, in the state of São Paulo, Brazil and was composed, for 

the most part, of domestic rather than industrial sludge. The pH of biosolid was determined in 

water extracts (1:5 v/v), CEC was determined as described by Sparks31 and organic C content 

was determined by the Walkley and Black method. The total concentration of Cd, Pb, Zn, P, 

K, Ca and Mg in the biochar and biosolid were determined following the EPA3051a method.26  

 



22 

 

 

 

2.2.3 Amendments and Incubation Time 

The soil was amended individually in triplicate with biochar, biosolid, calcite 

(CaCO3), and ammonium phosphate monobasic (NH4H2PO4). Phosphorus (P) was applied 

evenly to the soil at 0 (control), 0.5 (quarter rate), 1 (half rate), and 2:1 (full rate) molar ratio 

of P as related to the sum of Pb, Cd, and Zn. These rates were based on the stoichiometric 

(P:M =3:5) form of the following precipitate M5(PO4)3OH (M= sum of Zn, Pb and Cd).
32

 

Treatment with calcium carbonate (CaCO3) was based on the formation of metal-carbonate 

precipitates, with general formula [MCO3], where M=Mtotal(Zn+Pb+Cd).
16 M:CO3 (full rate) molar 

ratio of 0.5:1 (half rate) and 0.25:1 (quarter rate) were also utilized. The biochar was applied 

at the rates of 2.5, 5.0, and 10%,33 and biosolid at 5, 10, and 20% relative to the mass of soil.20 

The amendments were homogenized with the soil through mixing and incubated in the lab 

with deionized water at 25±2oC for 60 days at 70% of the maximum water retention capacity. 

Water was added every three days based on the mass loss of water to maintain this degree of 

humidity. 

 

2.2.4 Bulk XANES 

Zn-K edge XANES analysis was carried out on the samples that received the highest 

rate of each treatment at the XAFS2 beamline at the LNLS (Brazilian Synchrotron Light 

Laboratory), located in Campinas, in the state of São Paulo. The measurements were 

performed in transmission mode using a Si (111) double crystal monochromator. Energy 

calibration was performed using a Zn metal foil positioned between the second and the third 

ionization chamber. The soil samples were ground and 150 mg was pressed down to 5 mm 

diameter pellets, 1.3 cm2 in size. Three XANES spectra were collected per sample and the 

spectra were acquired across the energy range of -130 to 340 eV relative to the Zn-K edge 

energy at 9659 eV. These spectra were energy calibrated, aligned, merged, and normalized 

using the Athena program within the IFEFFIT package. Linear combination fitting (LCF) 

analysis were carried out across an energy range of -20 to 80 eV relative to E0 using the 

method developed by Manceau et al.34 to deconvolute different Zn species present and their 

relative contributions to the observed Zn spectrum (Figure S3). Additional information about 

the bulk XANES procedure and standards (Table S2) utilized for the LCF analysis are in the 

Supporting Information Available Section below. 



23 

 

2.2.5 Micro-XRF and Micro-XANES Measurements. 

Micro-XRF imaging and spectroscopy were performed on the phosphate-amended and 

unamended soil sample that was air-dried, ground, and prepared as thin sections of ~20 µm 

thickness. For the P-amended soil we used sub-micron resolution X-ray (SRX) Beamline (5-

ID) of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) at Brookhaven National 

Laboratory, located in Upton, New York, USA.  A focused spot of 1 µm x 0.7 µm controlled 

by Kirkpatrick?Baez mirrors and Si (111) horizontal double-crystal monochromator crystals 

were used at this beamline.   

Micro-XRF analysis was carried out using an incident beam energy of 15 keV and the 

fluorescence signals were received by a three-element Si drift detector. The map plotted a 120 

µm x 120 µm area of the sample, using a step size of 1 µm and a 1 s acquisition time. The µ-

XRF mapping technique was used to image the distribution of Zn, Si, P, Ca, Fe, Al, Mg, K, 

Pb, Mn, Cu and Ni. For the unamended soil, the analyses were completed using µ-XRF and 

µ-XANES at the D09B-XRF Beamline at the LNLS.  

A focused 20 µm diameter spot size controlled by a KB mirror system and Si (111) 

crystal monochromator were used. Micro-XRF analysis was carried out using an incident 

beam energy of 15keV and the fluorescence signals were measured by a silicon drift detector 

(SDD; AXAS-A, KETEK GmbH, Germany). The map was plotted across a 4,000 x 3,000 µm 

area of sample, using a step size of 30 µm and 0.3 sec acquisition time. The µ-XRF mapping 

technique was used to image the distribution of Zn, Fe and Si.  

Zinc K-edge µ-XANES were collected from ten and then three additional Zn spots 

across the µ-XRF map in the P-amended soil and un-amended soil, respectively. Five XANES 

spectra were collected per sample and were acquired across the energy range of -100 to 200 

eV relative to the Zn-K edge energy at 9659 eV. These spectra were energy calibrated, 

aligned, merged, and normalized using the Athena program in the IFEFFIT package. LCF 

analysis was carried out across an energy range of -20 to 80 eV and -20 to 40 eV relative to 

E0 for the P-amended and unamended soil, respectively. The fit results were obtained using 

the Manceau approach described above for bulk XANES. Additional information about µ-

XANES procedure and standards (Table S2) utilized for the LCF analysis are in the 

Supporting Information Available section below. 

 



24 

 

 

 

2.2.6 Statistical Analyses of µ-XRF Images 

Natural log-transformed µ-XRF intensity data normalized to the incoming X-ray 

intensity (I0) was used to develop a statistical relationship between Zn and other matrix 

elements (Ca, Cr, Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Cd, P, Cu, Si). Pearson correlation and also partial 

correlation analyses were done to remove the effects of other confounding variables. All 

statistical analyses were carried out using the R statistical software package (version 3.2.3). 

Correlations were considered significant where ? = 0.05. 

 

2.2.7 Desorption Experiments 

Zinc desorption kinetics were carried out using a stirred-flow reactor equipped with a 

piston displacement pump designed for use in an HPLC system (Figure S7 in SI). A 12 mL 

stirred-flow chamber was used in these experiments to which 0.2 g of&amp;lt;2 mm sieved of each 

amended soil samples were added.  Mehlich-3 solution (0.2M CH3COOH + 

0.25M NH4NO3 + 0.013M HNO3 + 0.015M NH4F + 0.001M EDTA) solution was the 

desorption agent. The use of Mehlich-3 has been reported to estimate the heavy metals 

availability for plants35 and to estimate your bioaccessibility.36 A 25-mm diameter cellulose 

filter membrane with a 0.45 µm pore size was used in the reaction chamber. The solution 

flowed through the chamber at a rate of 1 mL min-1 and the suspension in the reaction 

chamber was stirred at 300 rpm. The effluent was collected from the reactor at 2 min intervals 

over a period of 2 h, and Zn concentration was determined by ICP-OES. The desorption 

kinetic of Zn was calculated according to Yin et al.37 and plotted in cumulative Zn desorption 

percentages. 

 

2.2.8 Sequential Fractionation Procedures 

The sequential fractions of the humid tropical soils were determined following the 

procedure developed by Silveira et al.38. The original method numbers seven fractions, but in 

the present study we extracted the following sequentially with 0.1 M CaCl2 for readily 

exchangeable (F1); 1 M NaOAC (pH 5) for carbonates forms (F2); NaOCl (pH 8.5) for 

organic-matter bound (F3); 0.2M oxalic acid + 0.2M NH4 oxalate (pH 3) for iron-oxides 



25 

 

bound (F4); and the residual (F5) was obtained after digestion following the EPA3051a 

method 26. The Zn concentration in each fraction was quantified by ICP-OES. 

 

2.3 Results 

2.3.1 Soil, Biochar, and Biosolid Characteristics 

Soils from the mining area were considered hazardous because the concentrations of 

Zn, Pb, and Cd in these soils exceeded the intervention values adopted by the state of São 

Paulo for industrial or residential areas, which were 10,000 mg kg-1,of Zn, 4,400 mg kg-1 of 

Pb, and 14.0 mg kg-1 of Cd 39 (Table 1; Table S1 in SI).

The unamended soil sample had a pH of 8.3, but the addition of the amendments 

decreased the pH by up to two units, particularly for the samples amended with P. Soil C 

contents increased by 5.3 fold when amended with biochar and 1.9 fold when amended with 

biosolid. The XRD indicated the presence of Goethite (?-FeO(OH)), Hematite (Fe2O3) , 

Kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4), Gibbsite (Al(OH)3, Muscovite (KAl3Si3O10(OH)2), Clinochlore

Quartz (SiO2) (Figure S1 in SI). The organic amendments had a high pH and high CEC 

(Table 2). The biochar had 4.3 times more carbon than biosolids, whereas biosolids had a 

higher concentration of macronutrients (P, Mg, Ca,) and trace elements (Cd, Pb, Zn) than 

biochar.

2.3.2 Zinc Speciation and Elemental Distribution 

2.3.2.1 Bulk-XANES Analysis 

Zinc K-edge XANES spectra for the control (unamended) soil samples from mining 

area and after treatments were nearly identical, except for the P-amended samples (Figure 1). 

Consistent with the XANES spectra, LCF results also showed similar fits for all treatments, 

except for the P-amended samples (Table 3). When the P amended samples were excluded, 

the best fit combination of standards for all other treatments included 26-30% Zn-

montmorillonite, 40-41% Zn-kerolite (Zn2.1Mg0.9Si4O10(OH)2.nH2O), 18-24% Zn-ferrihydrite, 

and 10-14% Gahnite (ZnAl2O4). The treatment with P had a fit with Gahnite (20%), Zn-LDH 

(Zn Layered double hydroxides) (16%), Zn3(PO4)2 (49%), and ZnO (15%).

2.3.2.2 Micro-XRF Maps, Statistical Analyses of µ-XRF images and µ -XANES 

The µ-XRF images in the P-amended soil showed the spatial distribution of Zn, Si, P, 

Ca, Fe, Al, Mg, K, Pb, Mn, Cu, and Ni (Figure 2). Zinc was co-localized with Fe, Si, Al, Mg 

and Ni, and the P was co-localized with Cu, Zn, Ni, Fe, and Ca. Similarly, the hotspot of Pb 

and Mn were co-localized, but its spatial distribution was different from Zn. The two hotspots 

from Zn (spot 10 and 4 on the XRF map) also co-localized with two hotspots of Ni. In our 

study, Zn had strong significant correlation with Ni (r = 0.62), Co (r = 56), Fe (r = 53), and Cr 

(r = 51) (Table S3 in SI). However, the partial correlation analysis carried out to remove the 

confounding effects of other elements had highest correlation with Ni (r’ = 0.56), Mn (r’ = 

0.38), and Pb (r’ = -0.29). The partial correlation coefficients decreased when compared to the 

Pearson correlation coefficient, implying the dependent spatial relationship between Zn and 

Ni, Co, Fe, and Cr on other co-localized elements present. The µ-XRF image in the 

unamended soil showed the spatial distribution of Zn, Cu and Si (Figure S3 in SI). Zn had 

significant (p &amp;lt;0.05) correlation with Cu (r = 19), Pb (r = 2.0), Si (r = 8.0), and Fe (r = 2.0) 

(Table S4 in SI), whereas partial correlation had significant correlation only with Cu (r = 20) 

and Si (r = 9.0).

Micro-XANES spectra of the un-amended soil collected from three spots confirmed 

the predominance of fit with Zn-montmorillonite (41-59%) followed by Gahnite (21-41%) 

(Table S5 in SI). Spots 1 and 2 had a fit with Zn-ferrihydrite (10-16%) and only spot 1 had a 

fit with Zn-kerolite (20%). These data agreed with the LCF performed in the bulk XANES, 

where the same species were identified (Table 3). 

Micro-XANES spectra in the P-amended soil collected from ten spots showed 

variations (Fig. 2). However, the merge of these ten spectra was very similar to the spectra of 

the bulk XANES (Figure S2 in SI). Considering the size of the microprobe beam (10 µm2) 

and bulk beam (107 µm2), 10 µ-XANES spectra represented only 0.0001% of the lateral 

sample area irradiated by the bulk beam. This result shows that the µ-XANES can be 

representative of the bulk XANES analyses and has the advantage of being able to identify 

species that cannot be deconvolved using bulk XANES. 

 The best-fit combination of standards for all ten spots included 8-35% Zn3(PO4)2, 

19-35% Scholzite (CaZn2(PO4)2•2(H2O)), 21-40% Gahnite, 23-100% Zn-LDH, 8-30% Zn-

montmorillonite, 20-24% Zn-ferrihydrite (Table 4), whereas bulk XANES fit results did not 

show any fit with the standards of Scholzite and Zn-montmorillonite. However, the Zn-

montmorillonite standard had a significant fit in the µ-XANES and bulk XANES results of 

the unamended soil. The greater proportion of gahnite in the fit was found in two “hot spots” 

(spots 9 and 10), consistent with results obtained by Kirpichtchikova et al.40

2.3.3 Desorption Kinetics 

Stirred-flow desorption experiments were conducted using Melich-3 solution to 

assess the bioavailable of Zn in each treatment with different rates. To compare the desorption 

behavior of treatments and their rates, the amount of Zn desorbed was normalized to the total 

soil Zn concentration and plotted as a function of time (Figure 3; Figure S5 in SI). For each 

treatment receiving a higher rate, the amount of Zn desorbed after 2 h ranged between 21 to 

18 % for biosolid and biochar, respectively. During the initial time of desorption, the P-

amended soil had the highest desorption, and the calcite amended soil had the lowest. The soil 

amended with lower rates of calcite and P desorbed less Zn after 2h compared to the higher 

rates. For the treatments with biochar and biosolid the rates that desorbed less Zn were the 5% 

and 10% respectively.

calcite biochar and biosolid. 

 

2.3.4 Sequential Extraction 

The P-amended soil was the only one with detectable amounts of Zn in F1 extracted 

with 0.1 M CaCl2 and increased the Zn in the F2 (extracted with 1M NaOAC (pH 5)) (Figure 

4; Figure S6 in SI). Similarly, the treatments with calcite and biosolid also had increased Zn 

extracted in the F2 in a number of their lower rates (Figure S5 in SI). Except for the treatment 



31 

 

with calcite, all the treatments increased Zn in the F3 extracted with 5% NaOCl (pH 8.5). The 

soil amended with biosolid increased the Zn extracted in the F4, but the treatment with P 

decreased it. In the F5, extracted with HNO3 + HCl, the treatments reduced the amount of Zn 

extracted, except for the soil amended with calcite. In general, the soil amended with P 

increased the Zn extracted in the initial fractions (F1, F2 and F3) and decreased in the most 

recalcitrant fractions (F4 and F5). The treatments with organic compounds (biochar and 

biosolid) increased the extracted Zn in F3 and F4 and decreased in F5. The higher rate of 

calcite did not differ (p &amp;lt;0.05) from the control. However, the lower rates increased the Zn in 

F2 and F5 and reduced it in F4.

2.4 Discussion 

The city of Vazante has one of the major non-sulfide zinc deposits in the world,3,4 

with Hemimorphite and Willemite having been previously reported in this region.41 However, 

the LCF results did not show any fit with these minerals in our soil samples which may be 



32 

 

 

 

explained by the formation of Zn pedogenic (soil-formed) species, including Zn in the 

structure of goethite, Zn sorbed to Fe and Mn oxides and Zn-bearing phyllosilicates-type 

precipitates.24 A number of authors have reported that Zn released by the weathering of 

mining, smelting or foundry emissions can be precipitated and sorbed/complexed.40,42,43 

The bulk Zn K-edge XANES spectrum for the unamended soil indicated Zn-kerolite 

(40% of total Zn) and Zn-montmorillonite (26%) as major components, whereas Zn-

montmorillonite had a predominant fit in the spots analyzed by µ-XANES. Zinc can form 

mononuclear inner-sphere complex at the edges of montmorillonite layers at low [Si]aq around 

70µM and precipitates epitaxially as kerolite at relevant geochemical systems with 

concentrations around 500 µM.44 Schuwirth et al.45 investigated the speciation of Zn in 

different layers in a soil at a former tailings pond of a Zn/Pb/Ag ore mine in the northern 

Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany and observed that in the superficial layer (4 to 6 cm) the Zn 

species was predominantly in the form of Zn adsorbed on montmorillonite and Zn-rich 

phyllosilicates. 

Zn-kerolite has been identified in many soils and sediments and is derived from the 

in-situ weathering of primary minerals.24,40,46–48 The prevalence of the Zn-montmorillonite 

standard in the fit is consistent with the presence of Zn2+ adsorbed on this secondary mineral, 

which was identified by XRD analysis in our soil sample (Figure S1 in SI). Zinc may be 

incorporated or sorbed on the octahedral sheet or a hydroxy-Al sheet in the interlayer region 

in the phyllosilicates.49 The other species identified in the unamended soil were Zn-

ferrihydrite (24%) and Gahnite (10%).  

Zn-ferrihydrite is usually detected with phyllosilicates and frequently occurs as a 

background species in soil matrices.50,51 Similarly, Gahnite which is a primary mineral formed 

mainly in metamorphic high temperature50 environments was identified in soils impacted by 

the dust of smelting activities,42,46 and acid mine drainage sites.50 The positive correlation and 

partial correlation with Fe, Si are further evidence of the presence of Zn associated with 

phyllosilicates and ferrihydrite that were identified in the unamended soil. Kirpichtchikova et 

al. 40 investigated the speciation of Zn in a soil from Pierrelaye plain, a 1,200 ha truck farming 

area located about 30 km northwest of Paris, France in an area of urban and industrial 

suburbia. This site was irrigated for a hundred years with untreated sewage water from the 

city of Paris. The predominant Zn species identified at this place were Zn- sorbed ferrihydrite, 

Zn phosphate, Zn-kerolite, willemite and gahnite. 



33 

 

The P-amended soil was the only one that affected the bulk XANES spectrum (Figure 

1). This treatment had a fit with ZnO, Zn3(PO4)2, and Zn-LDH. Baker et al.
52 evaluated the 

effect of sources of P, reaction times and distance of the application in the Zn speciation in a 

contaminated soil from an abandoned Pb/Zn smelter near Dearing, KS, USA. The authors 

verified the formation of Zn-P and ZnO (Zincite) due to P application in certain treatments. 

Although our LCF result for the control did not show the fit with Zn-LDH, it could still be 

present in the sample because it is common for Zn-LDH to be identified in soils with pH near 

7 and high concentration of Zn.24,25,47,53. The fit with ZnO is not reasonable because this 

species is more soluble than Zn-kerolite and Zn-montmorillonite.53 However, it could 

probably form due to the decrease in the pH caused by the treatment (Table 1). As pH 

decreases, the solubility of Zn increases.54 In this treatment, we did not observe a fit with Zn-

kerolite, Zn-montmorillonite, and Zn-ferrihydrite. This might be because of the unitability of 

Zn-kerolite under acid conditions,24 the adsorption of Zn on Montmorillonite that occurs 

mainly in the electrostatic form,55 and the adsorption of Zn on Ferrihydrite that is highly pH 

dependent.56 

Micro-XRF and µ-XANES confirmed the formation of Zn-P in the P-amended soil 

(Figure 2; Table 4). In the µ-XRF image, P is co-localized with Zn, and the significant partial 

correlation confirmed this association. Micro-XANES showed that the Zn-P species are 

dominant in most of the spots analyzed. In a number of these spots, we identified Scholzite 

(Zn, Ca-phosphate) which is more stable than Hopeite, but requires Ca to be present for such 

formation.57 In a number of µ-XANES spots we also identified Zn-montmorillonite and Zn-

ferrihydrite, which indicate that these species are present in the amended soil but are not 

sufficiently abundant to be detected by the bulk XANES.  

Nickel, Mn, Pb and Fe had the highest partial correlation in the P-amended soil 

(Table 5). Iron and Mn are the constituents of the soil that have a high affinity for Zn and 

represent two possible reactive surfaces with which Zn may interact in the soil environment25. 

Karna et al.58 found a high positive correlation between Zn and Pb, Fe, and Mn in mine waste 

materials. According to Karna et al.58, Zn and Pb could be adsorbed and co-precipitate with 

Mn and Fe hydr(oxides). Kirpichtchikova et al.40 also reported positive correlation between 

Zn, and Pb with Fe in ferruginous clay particles. However, Kirpichtchikova et al.40 found no 

correlation between Zn and Pb with Fe at spots that had low Fe concentration, suggesting that 

the different regions engendered different Zn and Pb species.  

The Ni “hot spot” (spot 4 on Zn µ-XRF map; Figure 2) was co-localized with the Zn 

“hot spot”. The µ-XANES showed the predominance of Zn-LDH (100%) at this spot where 



34 

 

 

 

Ni and Zn could be precipitated on the mineral surface. Nickel can form a Ni-Al layered 

double hydroxide (LDH) which precipitates upon the reaction of Ni with Montmorillonite, 

Kaolinite, Pyrophyllite and Gibbsite.  

Desorption kinetics and the chemical extraction confirmed the increased availability of 

Zn in the P treated soil that received the highest rate (Figure 3). More Zn was desorbed during 

the initial time of the desorption kinetics, which could be inferred from increased Zn extracted 

in the first fractions (F1, F2, and F3) of the sequential extraction. However, total Zn desorbed 

after 120 min was almost equal to that of the control. The first Zn species to be released may 

be from ZnO and Zn-phosphate followed by Zn-ferrihydrite and Zn-phyllosilicates. 

Kirpichtchikova et al.40 performed an EXAFS with linear combination data before and after 

the chemical extraction with EDTA and observed that Zn-phosphate was entirely and 

selectively dissolved by EDTA. According to Kirpichtchikova et al.40,  the lower extraction 

level measured for Zn was due to the Zn phyllosilicate component, which is less soluble than 

Zn-phosphate and Zn-ferrihydrite.  

Less Zn was desorbed from the samples that received lower rates of P in comparison 

to those that were unamended or received a high rate of P (Figure 3; Figure S5 in SI). This 

shows that P can be effective in the immobilization of Zn, which has also been demonstrated 

by several authors.59,60 The use of the lowest molar ratio, P:M, may be the best option for 

immobilizing Zn in soils with alkaline soil (high pH) and a high concentration of metals. A 

lower P rate will have a lower effect on pH and have less risk of eutrophication of 

groundwater and rivers.

The treatments with calcite, biosolid and biochar had no effect in the speciation 

determined by the bulk XANES (Table 3; Figure 1). However, changes were observed in the 

results of sequential extraction and desorption kinetics. The lowest rate of calcite was 

probably better at immobilizing Zn as it had less Ca competing for binding sites with Zn on 

the montmorillonite. Calcite can decrease the availability of Zn due to the formation of Zn-



35 

 

LDH.61 We observed an increase in Zn in the extraction of the residual fraction, which further 

supports the formation of Zn-LDH. The stability of the Zn-LDH phase has been well 

documented in the literature.23,24,47 

The speciation determined by bulk XANES may not have been effective in detecting 

modifications in the Zn species in the organic treatments. Mamindy-Pajany et al.62 used  

Micro-XRF and Micro-XANES to observe an increase in Zn bonded to organic matter and 

iron oxide in soils amended with biosolids. In our study, the biosolids and biochar increased 

the Zn extracted in the F3 (organic fraction) and in certain of their rates increased the Zn in 

the F4 (iron oxides). In the desorption kinetics, the biochar was more effective in decreasing 

the Zn desorption than biosolid. The greater affinity of biochar might be because of the high 

CEC and specific surface area.63–65 The biochar can increase the buffering capacity of the 

soil,66 and this may also have contributed to decreased Zn desorption. 

 

2.5 Environmental Recommendations 

The organic and inorganic amendments utilized in our experiment had different 

behavior patterns according to the different rates applied. Considering only the highest rate of 

each amendment, the application of P affected the Zn species determined by bulk XANES. 

However, the sequential extraction and desorption kinetics results showed us that Zn species 

such as ZnO could be released easier. Nevertheless, the results from the desorption kinetics 

highlighted that the quarter rate and half rate of P were sufficiently effective to decrease Zn 

desorption. Although our soil was alkaline, the utilization of calcite was effective in 

decreasing Zn desorption on all rates, the quarter rate and half rates being the most effective. 

The organic amendments were also able to reduce the Zn desorption. The rate of 10% of 

biosolid and 5% of biochar were more effective in reducing the Zn desorption than the other 

rates. In general, the highest rate did not seem to be the most effective in immobilizing Zn in 

the soil. This information is very important in helping to develop remediation strategies that 

provide a cost-effective and sustainable solution. 

 

2.6 Supporting Information  

2.6.1 Soil Mineralogical Characterization 

In order to obtain the clay, silt and sand, the sample of the unamended soil was 

dispersed using 0.1 M NAOH. The sand fraction was separated by sieving (2 - 0.05 mm) and 



36 

 

 

 

the clay (&amp;lt;2 ?m) was isolated from the silt (0.05 - 0.002 mm) by repeated siphoning of the 

dispersed material. The XRD analyses were carried out on a computer-controlled X-ray 

diffractometer (Philips PW 1877) with CuK ? radiation (0.1542 nm) - (40 kV and 40 mA) and 

a graphite monochromator. The velocity of the goniometer was 0.02º2? s-1, with a variable 

range between 3 and 60º2?. The data were analyzed by the PANalytical X Pert HighScore 

software program. 

 

2.6.2 Bulk XANES and Micro-XANES 

Bulk XANES and Micro-XANES spectra were acquired across the energy range of -

130 to 340 eV and -100 to 200 respectively, relative to the Zn-K edge energy at 9659 eV. For 

the bulk XANES we used a step size of 4 eV in the pre-edge (-130 to -10); 1 eV across the 

adsorption edge region (-10 to 50) and 4 eV in the post-edge region (50 to 340) with 

acquisition times of 2, 5 and 2 sec, respectively. For the µ-XANES we used a step size of 4 

eV in the pre-edge (-100 to -10); 0.5 across the adsorption edge region (-10 to 50) and 2 eV in 

the post-edge region (50 to 200) with acquisition times of 2, 5 and 2 sec, respectively. The 

backgrounds of the bulk XANES and µ-XANES spectra were corrected using a linear pre-

edge function between -70 to -30 eV and -90 to 30 eV a linear or quadratic function between 

30 to 130 eV and 80 to 150 eV respectively, and a flattening function in the post-edge region 

for normalization was included. 

 

2.6.3 Standards Utilized to Perform the Linear Combination Fitting (LCF) 

The LCF was implemented using standards analyzed by us. On the other hand, in the 

other studies we utilized the spectra measured in different beamlines provided by researchers. 

Table S2 has a list of standards utilized and their references and sources. The standards 

obtained by the Alfa Aesar Company, Zn-montmorillonite and Zn-kaolinite were analyzed at 

XAFS2 beamline at the LNLS (Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory) and followed the 

same setup utilized for the samples. The Zn adsorbed to montmorillonite and kaolinite was 

produced following the method described in Khaokaew et al.2

3 ORGANIC AND INORGANIC AMENDMENTS TO IMOBILIZE LEAD FROM A 

MINE-WASTE IMPACTED SOIL 

 

Abstract 

Lead (Pb) is a heavy metal that may cause several human health problems, such as 

neuromuscular weakness, hearing deficits, and impaired cognitive functions. The Pb present on the 

soils may be leached to groundwater, accumulated by plants and animals and then enter in the food 

chain. Chemical stabilization is an in-situ remediation that uses inexpensive amendments to reduce 

contaminant availability in polluted soil. Rates of phosphate, calcite, biochar, and biosolids were 

evaluated on Pb speciation and mobility. The soil was collected in a Zn mining area located in 

Vazante, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil and was incubated for 60 days with deionized water at 70% 

of the maximum water retention. Chemical and mineralogical characterization, desorption kinetics, 

sequential extraction, leaching columns and speciation using X-ray absorption near edge structure 

(XANES) were performed. Pb adsorbed on bentonite and on anglesite were the predominant species 

in the unamended soil. The treatments with phosphate and calcite transformed part of the Pb species 

to pyromorphite. Conversely, in the soil amended with biochar and biosolids, part of Pb species was 

transformed to Pb adsorbed on citrate and PbCl2 in the biosolids. Biosolids and biochar treatments 

decreased the Pb in the residual fraction and increased it in the fraction associated to organic matter 

(OM) after the addition of biosolids. These organic amendments increased the desorption kinetics of 

Pb in all rates applied. Calcite and phosphate increased the Pb extracted in the residual fraction, thus 

showing that more recalcitrant species, such as pyromorphite, were formed. Calcite and phosphate 

were effective to immobilize Pb and to decrease Pb desorption kinetics. The soil amended with 

phosphate decreased the Pb leached in the experiment with leaching columns.

3.1 Introduction 

Lead (Pb) is one of the most hazardous environmental pollutants that affect biological 

systems through exposure to air, water and food sources1. It is also associated with behavioral 

abnormalities, neuromuscular weakness, hearing deficits, and impaired cognitive functions.2 

In Brazil, Pb exposure has been widely recognized as a significant public health problem in 

recent decades. One example is the region of Santo Amaro (state of Bahia where a lead 

smelter operated for 33 years before closing in 1993. It has been reported that some children 

living close to the former plant have high levels of Pb and Cd in their blood.3 

In situ stabilization of heavy metals in soil using amendments is a promising 

technology to decrease the risks associated with these elements.4,5 This technique is based on 

the reduction of metal availability and mobility, either by precipitation or increased sorption.6 

The soil amendments may decrease the metals solubility and thus reduce the detrimental 

effects on environmental receptors, such as humans, animals, plants and microorganisms, as 



52 

 

 

 

well as water bodies.7 Numerous amendments have been used and tested for in situ 

stabilization of Pb in soils, including alkaline materials5,8,9, phosphate9–11, biochar12–14 and 

biosolids15,16.  

Phosphate compounds increase the immobilization of heavy metals through different 

chemical processes, such as adsorption/substitution by phosphorus (P) compounds, P anion-

induced metal adsorption, and precipitation.17 The soil amended with phosphate may form 

pyromorphite, which is the most stable Pb form in the environment.18 The formation of this 

mineral in a contaminated soil environment reduces Pb bioavailability and improves 

ecosystem health.19 Alkaline materials are also increasingly being accepted as an important 

amendment to reduce the toxicity of heavy metals in soil.17 These materials enhance the 

sorption of heavy metals by increasing the negatively charged sites through reduction in the 

H+ concentration17, with the pH increase resulting in the precipitation of these metals.8  

Biochar has been accepted to be used to immobilize heavy metals in the recent years. 

This amendment may change soil properties such as increasing soil buffering capacity, cation 

exchange capacity (CEC) and soil pH. Biochar may immobilize Pb by electrostatic 

interactions, precipitation and other reactions according to current research.20–22 However, all 

biochar materials may not be suitable for all cases of remediation.17 Feedstock type and 

pyrolysis condition are the main factors influencing sorption behavior of biochars.23 Some 

researchers have revealed that biochar may increase the mobility of some toxic metals in 

soils.17  

Another material that may be a suitable amendment is biosolids, the semi-solid 

residues generated during the treatment of domestic sanitary sewage, providing that it 

contains no appreciable amount of heavy metals.24 This amendment contains an abundant 

amount of nutrients and organic matter that may improve soil biological, physical and 

chemical properties.25 Stabilization of heavy metals by biosolids is achieved through 

complexation adsorption and redox reactions.17 Biosolids has been used to successfully 

restore mine lands for more than 25 years26,27. Despite its beneficial usage, it is necessary to 

be careful with the application of biosolids because it may contain a significant amount of 

heavy metals originated mainly from industrial wastewater. The organic compounds may 

increase the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on the soil solution. The DOC can decrease the 

sorption of Pb onto soil surfaces due to the competition for binding sites or by the formation 

of soluble Pb-organ-complexes.28 



53 

 

Our research aim was to characterize Pb desorption and speciation from a mine-waste 

impacted soil from Brazil. The investigation was conducted using contaminated soil before 

and after the addition of NH4H2PO4, CaCO3, biochar, and biosolids. We used leaching 

column, sequential extraction, stirred-flow kinetic approach and X-ray absorption near edge 

structure (XANES) to evaluate the effect of these amendments in the Pb speciation and 

mobility.  

 

3.2 Materials and Methods 

3.2.1 Soil Characterization 

The soil sample was collected in a deactivated Zn mining area located in Vazante, 

Minas Gerais State, Brazil (coordinates 17o59’11’’S, 46o54’27”W). The soil was collected 

from the surface layer (0-20 cm) and was air dried at room temperature (~25oC) and passed 

through a 2-mm sieve. The content of soil organic carbon was determined with a Shimadzu 

TOC-5000 carbon analyzer. To determine their total (or pseudo-total) concentrations, heavy 

metals in the soil were extracted following the EPA3051a method using a 1:3 HCl/HNO3, v/v 

extraction method29, and the metal contents were quantified by inductively couple plasma 

optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Exchangeable ions and pH analyses followed the 

methods of Ingram and Anderson et al.30. XRD was performed in the clay, silt and sand 

fractions and bulk soil. XRD was also performed in the clay fraction after treatment with 5M 

NaOH31 for concentrating iron oxides and after treatment with sodium dithionite-citrate-

bicarbonate (DCB) for removing the iron oxides.32  Based on the XRD data for different 

fractions and chemical treatments, the composition of the soil was qualitatively identified as 

goethite, hematite, kaolinite, gibbsite, muscovite, clinochlore, montmorillonite, and quartz in 

the non-amended soil (Figure 1).

treatments for remove iron oxides (DCB) and silicates (Oxides). 

 

3.2.2 Biochar and Biosolids Characterization 

Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) straw was used to produce biochar at the 

temperature of pyrolysis of 450 oC. For more details about the production and characterization 

of biochar materials used in the study see Feola Conz et al.33. The biosolids was produced 

using wood chips (eucalyptus) and sewage sludge. It was composted in aerated rows for 60 

days, in this process, about 2% of dolomitic limestone was added and after composted it was 

sieving in mesh with 36 mm2. The sewage sludge was collected at a sewage treatment station 

located in Jundiai, São Paulo, Brazil and was composed in the major part by domestic than 

industrial sludge. The pH of biosolids was determined in water extracts (1:5 v/v), CEC was 

determined following the method described in Sparks34 and organic C amount was determined 

by the Walkley and Black method. The total concentrations of heavy metals (Pb, Zn and Cd) 

and nutrients (P, K, Ca and Mg) in both organic amendments were determined following the 

EPA3051a29 method.

3.2.3 Amendments and Incubation Time 

The soil was amended individually in triplicate with rates of ammonium phosphate 

monobasic (NH4H2PO4), calcite (CaCO3), biochar and biosolids. The soil was amended with 

2.5; 5 and 10% of biochar35 and 5, 10 and 20% of biosolids36. The NH4H2PO4 was applied 

evenly to the soil at 0 (control); 0.5 (quarter rate); 1.0 (half rate) and 2:1 (full rate) molar ratio 

of P to the sum of Pb, Cd and Zn. These rates were based on the stoichiometry (P:M=3:5) 

form of the follow precipitate M5(PO4)3OH (M= sum of Pb, Zn, Cd).
37   The CaCO3 was 

applied evenly to the soil at 0 (control); 0.25 (quarter rate); 0.5 (half rate) and 1:1 (full rate) 

molar ratio of CO3 to the sum of Pb, Cd, and, Zn
5. The amendments were added and mixed 

homogeneously with the soil and incubated with deionized water at 70% of the maximum 

water retention at 25±2oC in the lab for 60 days. To maintain the humidity, water was added 

every 3 days based on the mass loss of water. 

 

3.2.4 Bulk XANES 

The Pb-L3-edge XANES analysis was performed on the samples that received the highest 

rate of each amendment using the Beamline XAFS2 at LNLS (Brazilian Synchrotron Light 

Laboratory) Campinas, Brazil. About 65 mg of each amended soil was ground and mixed 

with 65 mg of boron nitrate for dilution and then pressed as ~5 mm diameter pellets with 1.3 

cm2 of surface area. The Si (111) monochromator energy was calibrated to 13035 eV based 

on the first inflection point in the L3-edge derivative spectra from a Pb foil. Spectra were 

collected in fluorescence mode using a Canberra 15 element Ge solid state detector.  We 

collected 5 spectra for each sample across the energy range of -150 to 200 eV relative to the 

PbL3-edge energy at 13,035 eV, using a step size of 0.5 eV in the pre-edge (-150 to -35), 0.2 

eV across the absorption edge region (-35 to 65) and 1 eV in the post-edge region (65 to 200) 

with 1 sec of acquisition time.  

The XAS scans were aligned, merged and processed using the Athena program, an 

interface to IFEFFIT38,39. The backgrounds of the spectra were corrected using a linear pre-

edge function between -120 and -45 and a linear or quadratic function between 30 and 110 

eV, included a flattening function in the post-edge region for normalization. Linear 

Combination fitting (LCF) analysis was done across -30 to 80 region using the method 

developed by Manceau et al40 to deconvolute different Pb species present and their relative 

contributions to the observed Pb spectrum. 



56 

 

 

 

Reference materials for LCF included Pb complexes of Pb-citrate, Pb-acetate, Pb-

fulvic, Pb-humic and adsorbed on bentonite, birnessite, goethite, ferrihydrite, gibbsite, 

kaolinite and hematite. We also used the following minerals: pyromorphite, galena, litharge, 

cerussite, hydrocerussite, chloropyromorphite, anglesite, hydroxypyromorphite. The 

references of PbO, PbCl2, PbCO3, PbO2, Pb(NO3)2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 

 

3.2.5 Desorption Kinetics 

A Stirred-flow reactor equipped with a piston displacement pump designed for use in 

an HPLC system was used to conduct the Pb desorption kinetics. The mass of the amended 

soils used was 200 mg placed in a 12 mL stirred-flow chamber (Figure 2). A Mehlich-3 

(0.2M CH3COOH + 0.25M NH4NO3 + 0.013M HNO3 + 0.015M NH4F + 0.001M EDTA) 

solution was used as a desorption agent. A 25-mm diameter cellulose filter membrane with a 

0.45 µm pore size was used in the reaction chamber. The suspension in the reactor was stirred 

at 300 rpm and the liquid portion of it was flowed through the filter in the chamber at a rate of 

1 mL min-1. The effluent was collected by a fraction collector at 2 min intervals and the 

concentration of Pb was quantified by ICP-OES. The amount of Pb desorbed was calculated 

according to Yin et al.41 and plotted in cumulative Pb desorption percentages.

3.2.6 Sequential Extraction 

The sequential extraction was performed according to the procedure developed by 

Silveira et al.42 The original method counts on seven fractions, but in the present study we 

extracted sequentially with 0.1 M CaCl2, 1 M NaOAC (pH 5), NaOCl (pH 8.5), and 0.2M 

oxalic acid + 0.2M NH4 oxalate (pH 3); and the residual was digested by EPA3051a method
42 



57 

 

to target Pb in readily exchangeable (F1), carbonate forms (F2), organic-matter bound (F3), 

iron-oxides bound (F4), and residual (F5), respectively. 

 

3.2.7 Leaching Column 

The leaching experiment was conducted using soil from the mine area and amended it 

with different rates of P. Four 5.05-cm diameter (20 cm2 cross sectional area) columns made 

from polycarbonate, washed with acid and rinsed with distilled water were prepared for the 

study.  Twenty-six g of air dried soil was packed at a bulk density of 1.3 g cm-3 (1 cm thick) 

over a 3-cm thick layer of washed sand in each column (Figure 3).  Another 3-cm thick layer 

of washed sand was then packed on top of the soil before placing a cap with an outlet on top. 

Assuming a particle density of 2.65 g cm-3, one pore volume for the soil columns was 

approximately 10.1 cm3. Deionized water, adjusted to pH of 4.3 with 0.001 M HNO3, was 

pumped through the column at a rate of approximately 10 mL/h. We selected this pH based on 

a previous study that determined the chemical characteristics of the rainwater at a 

southeastern part of Brazil43.  A total of 670 pore volumes of the solution was passed through 

each column and the outflow was collected on a fraction collector in 14-15 mL increments. 

We determined the concentration of Pb by ICP-MS and measured the pH in the outflow 

samples to establish breakthrough curves.

3.3 Results 

3.3.1 Soil, Biochar and Biosolids Characterization 

The amount of Pb, Zn and Cd in the soil samples were considered hazardous because 

their concentrations exceeded the intervention values adopted by the Environmental Agency 

of the State of São Paulo44 for residential and industrial areas (Table 1). The treatment with 

phosphate and biosolids reduced the pH by 2 and 0.5 units, respectively. The other 

amendments did not affect the pH. Soil carbon (C) contents were increased more in the 

biochar than biosolids treatment. The highest rate of phosphate increased the exchangeable P 

by almost 100 times and the calcite amendment increased the Ca content by 60 to 90%.

The biochar and biosolids were slightly alkaline and both had a high CEC. The presence 

of heavy metals (Cd, Pb and Zn) were not found in the biochar, whereas biosolids had 

significant amount of Pb and Zn (Table 2). Also, the biosolids had more Ca, Mg and P than 

biochar, and they had almost the same amount of K.

3.3.2 Bulk XANES 

The Pb L3-edge spectra and the LCF-XANES results for the non-amended and 

amended soils are shown in Figure 4 and Table 3, respectively.  The LCF-XANES fitted 

results described the samples data quite well. The primary Pb species in the non-amended soil 

were Pb-bentonite (75%) and Anglesite (PbSO4) (25%) (Table 3). The soil amended with 

phosphate and calcite had an LCF with the same species as the non-amended soil, plus the 

LCF with pyromorphite. The best fit combination for phosphate and calcite amended soil 

were 41-54% Pb-bentonite, 30-16% Anglesite, and 29-30% pyromorphite.  

The formation of pyromorphite due the treatment with phosphate compounds has 

been well documented in the literature.19,45,46 The soil amended with the biochar and biosolids 

also had a fit with Pb-bentonite (66 and 38%, respectively), and the Pb-citrate (22 and 48%, 

respectively). However, the biosolids did not have a fit with anglesite but had a fit with PbCl2 

(14%).The Pb L3-edge XANES spectra of the references that had a fit with our soil samples 

are show in Figure 5.

3.3.3 Desorption Kinetics 

The cumulative Pb desorbed with Mehlich-3 in the non-amended soil (control) and 

the soil amended with rates of phosphate, calcite, biochar, and biosolids are presented in 

Figure 6.  The data indicated a rapid desorption of Pb in the non-amended soil within the first 

30 min. The cumulative desorption at 30min was 6% and after 2 h was 10%. 



61 

 

The inorganic amendments (phosphate and calcite) were efficient in decreasing Pb 

kinetics desorption than organic amendments (biosolids and biochar). The phosphate 

amendment was the most effective treatment to decrease Pb desorption. While the lowest P 

amendment had the lowest desorption (5% after 2 h), the half and full rate were also effective 

in reducing Pb desorption (up to 8% after 2 h).  The calcite amendment was also effective in 

reducing Pb desorption, but without any appreciable difference among calcite rates, with a 

cumulative Pb desorption around 8%. 

The biochar and biosolids amendments were not effective in decreasing the 

desorption kinetics of Pb.  Biosolids increased the desorption of Pb in the early times more 

than biochar. However, both amendments had very similar Pb cumulative desorption after 2 h.

phosphate, calcite biochar and biosolids. 

 

3.3.4 Sequential Extraction 

The sequential extractions of Pb after amendment application with rates of phosphate, 

calcite, biosolids and biochar are given in Figure 7. No exchangeable fraction - F1 - (extracted 



62 

 

 

 

with 0.1 M CaCl2) was detected in both non-amended and amended soils. The soil amended 

with rates of P and the highest rate of calcite and biochar did not release appreciable amounts 

of Pb when extracted with NaOAC (pH 5) (F2 treatment) designed to extract the species 

associated with carbonates. Biochar and biosolids were the only amendments that increased 

the Pb in the F3 treatment (extracted with 5% NaOCl (pH 8.5)) designed to extract species 

associated with organic matter.  

In the non-amended soil and amended with calcite and phosphate, we did not detect a 

measurable amount of Pb in the F3 treatment. In the F4 treatment (extracted with 0.2M oxalic 

acid + 0.2M NH4 oxalate (pH 3)), to extract the Pb bound to iron oxides, all rates of biosolids 

and the half rate and quarter rate of calcite decreased the exchangeable Pb. The biochar did 

not change and the half rate of phosphate decreased the Pb in the F4 treatment. The soil 

amended with rates of calcite and phosphate increased the Pb in the residual fraction (F5) 

while the biochar and biosolids had an opposite effect. 

Sanderson et al 49 evaluated the effect of P in a shooting range soils contaminated by 

Pb and observed by sequential extraction a decrease in the Pb extracted in the F1 

(exchangeable) and an increase in the residual fraction due to P treatment.  A similar outcome 

was reported by Su et al. 48  for P addition to an anthropogenic contaminated soil

oxide, and F5 = residual (most strongly bound). Columns followed by the same letter in each 

fraction do not differ (p &amp;lt;0.05) by Tukey test. 

 

3.3.5 Leaching Column 

The concentration of Pb (µmol) and the pH of the leachate varied as a function of the 

rate of phosphate (Figure 8). The first pore volume of leachate that passed through the column 

started with an acidic pH for all rates of phosphate applied. However, as more water passed 

through the column the pH began to increase before decreasing. The highest rate of P had more 

buffering capacity than the other rates as well as the non-amended soil.

of phosphate applied in the mining soil. 

 

The full rate of P, we detected a low Pb concentration in all collected outflow samples. 

The half rate and quarter rate of P had less buffering capacity than the non-amended soil. These 

phosphate rates had more Pb leached during the initial period of leaching. However, after 150 

pore volumes, these P rates had less Pb leached than the non-amended soil. 

 

3.4 Discussion 

The LCF included the Pb-bentonite (75%), the major species in the non-amended 

soil, followed by Anglesite (25%). The abundance of Pb-bentonite in the LCF is in agreement 

with XRD results (Figure 1). Clay minerals such as montmorillonite can be effective in 

binding heavy metals because they have large specific surface area and high CEC. The 

adsorption of heavy metals in this mineral can occur by outer-sphere adsorption, which occurs 

primarily on the basal planes existing in the interlayer of the clay minerals; and inner-sphere 

adsorption, which occurs at the amphoteric ligand sites existing on the edges of clay 

minerals.47  

Lead ions in bentonite may be incorporated in the positions of the inner-sphere 

complex by replacing some aluminum ions in the octahedral sites.48 Lead adsorbed to 

bentonite and the anglesite may have been formed due to the oxidation of galena that was 

present in the soil environment. The formation of anglesite due to galena oxidation has 

already been well documented in the literature49-50, and its presence in the soil of the Vazante 

region has already been reported.51-52 



65 

 

The LCF in the samples amended with phosphate showed that a substantial part of 

the Pb-bentonite was transformed in pyromorphite with a smaller amount converted to 

anglesite (Table 3). These results are important because pyromorphite (Pb5(PO4)3Cl) has at 

least 44 orders of magnitude smaller solubility than galena (PbS), anglesite (PbSO4), cerrusite 

(PbCO3), and litharge (PbO), which are common Pb minerals in contaminated soils.
53,54 The 

presence of pyromorphite in the amended soil as detected by LCF was expected due to the 

high phosphate exchangeable and the decrease of the pH of the soil (Table 1).  

The formation of pyromorphite is thermodynamically favored when H3PO4
0 and 

H2PO4
- are present; therefore, a lower soil pH is necessary to be established to support the 

conversion of soil Pb to pyromorphite.55 According to Sanderson et al.9 for the pyromorphite 

formation it is necessary to have solubilization of Pb from an existing source and sufficient 

amount of chloride. However, when P and Cl are not in sufficient amount other species such 

as Pb phosphate (Pb3(PO4)2 or PbHPO4) and hydroxylpyromorphite are expected to form.  

The LCF of the soil amended with calcite included Pb-bentonite (54%), Anglesite 

(16%) and Pyromorphite (30%), and the soil amended with phosphate the treatment with 

calcite also had substantial amount of pyromorphite formation (Table 3). This treatment 

resulted in a minor change in pH because our soil was already alkaline. On the other hand, the 

ionic strength of the soil solution increased and favored to increase the exchangeable P (Table 

1) probably because of the competition for binding sites with CO3
2-. However, Pb that was 

adsorbed to the outer-sphere complex may have been desorbed from the bentonite into the soil 

solution because of the excess of Ca2+. Lead can exchange on the basal planes and form inner-

sphere surface complexation at the edge sites on 2:1 phyllosilicate depending on the ionic 

strength and pH.56   High ionic strength inhibits the outer-sphere adsorption of Pb on the basal 

planes of montmorillonite.56 As we previously discussed, the presence of P and Pb in the soil 

solution facilitates the formation of pyromorphite. High pH of the soil may favor the 

precipitation of Pb as phosphate, hydroxides and carbonates, as well.57 

The results of sequential extraction and desorption kinetics give some useful insight 

into the immobilization of Pb in the soil and confirm their effectiveness (Figures 6 and 7). Pb 

extracted in the carbonate fraction decreased and was transferred to the residual fraction, 

indicating the presence of more recalcitrant species that is an evidence of the pyromorphite 

formation. Cao et al.11 also reported a decrease in the Pb extracted in the carbonate fraction 

and an increase in the residual fraction in a soil amended with phosphate. Sanderson et al.58 

evaluated the effect of P in a shooting range soils contaminated by Pb and observed a 

decrease in the Pb extracted in the exchangeable and an increase in the residual fraction due to 



66 

 

 

 

P treatment. A similar outcome was reported by Su et al.59  after P addition in an 

anthropogenic contaminated soil. In the calcite treatment, more Pb was found in the residual 

fractions.  

The immobilization of Pb due the formation of pyromorphite is supported by the 

desorption kinetics results where the desorption of Pb decreased in all rates of phosphate and 

calcite. It is important to note that the rates of calcite did not have an appreciable impact on 

the desorption kinetics. On the other hand, the soil amended with phosphate had different 

amounts of Pb desorbed between the rates applied. This information is important to evaluate 

low-cost remediation strategies. 

The phosphate treatment decreased the pH of the outflow (leachate) initially, but the 

leachate pH began to increase as more water passed through the column before decreasing 

again (Figure 8). The initial decrease of pH probably happened because of the dissociation of 

NH4
+ and H2PO4

- in the solution provided by the NH4H2PO4 that was used as a source of 

phosphate. The pH increased when these components began to be leached.  

The highest rate of P had a higher buffer capacity probably because not all of the 

NH4H2PO4 had reacted with soil. The half rate and quarter rates increased the leaching of Pb 

in the initial leaching probably due to the mineral solubilization. The acidity generated by the 

phosphate may cause the dissolution of the compounds of Fe, Al, Mn, organic matter and 

carbonates.60  The use of soluble P source for amending soils increases the soil dissolved 

organic carbon concentration, thereby increasing Pb mobility.61 Although the half and quarter 

rates resulted in a higher initial leaching, these treatments in long-term may be effective to 

decrease the Pb mobility. Su et al.59 evaluated the effect of the addition of sources of P with 

oxalic acid in different incubation times in a soil contaminated anthropogenically by Pb. The 

authors observed a decrease in the Pb leaching in all treatments with P and less Pb was 

leached in the highest times of incubation. 

Conversely to the inorganic amendments (phosphate and calcite), the organic 

amendments (biochar and biosolids) made the Pb more available in the soil. The effectiveness 

of biochar and biosolids to immobilize Pb in contaminated soil is well documented 62–67. 

These amendments can increase immobilization of heavy metals due to different chemical 

process, such as adsorption, complexation and precipitation.17 However, in our study, these 

amendments increased the desorption kinetics of Pb for all rates of biochar and biosolids, and 

we also verified a decrease in the residual fraction (F5) that is responsible for the most stable 

species in the soil.  



67 

 

Biochar and biosolids had a LCF with Pb-citrate indicating that part of Pb might be 

bound with organic groups. This result agrees with the sequential extraction in which the Pb 

extracted in the fraction 3 (organic matter bound) increased for both treatments. Scheckel et 

al.68 evaluated the effect of amendments on the Pb speciation in a soil contaminated by 

smelter activities. They observed that the treatment with 10% of biosolids decreased the LCF 

with anglesite (32 to 12%) and galena (21 to 0%), and increased the LCF with Pb bound to 

organic matter (37 to 60%). They also reported that the treatment with rock phosphate and 

triple superphosphate used as source of P increased the LCF with Pyromorphite. 

Lead may have been complexed by the soluble organic ligands originating from the 

biochar and biosolids and this may have increased your desorption. Lead has the ability to 

form a complex compound with the dissolved organic carbon.69  The formation of soluble 

complexes with oxygen-containing functional groups of dissolved organic matter can increase 

the mobility of metals like Pb and Cu.70 Strawn and Sparks62 evaluated the kinetic adsorption 

of Pb in a soil in which  organic matter (SOM) was removed. They observed that the soil 

without SOM sorbed more Pb than the untreated soil. The SOM consists of a large polymer, 

and the diffusion to the sites on the interior of the SOM molecule limit the sorption process.62 

 

3.5 Environmental Recommendations  

Application of P and calcite for chemical stabilization of Pb in a contaminated soil 

resulted in a significant formation of pyromorphite. These amendments decreased the 

desorption kinetics and formed more recalcitrant species of Pb. The highest rate of each 

treatment did not always result in more Pb immobilized. Thus, for remediation, a better option 

may be to start with the lowest rate, which may provide a more cost-effective and sustainable 

solution. In our study, biochar and biosolids increased the mobilization of Pb. However, the 

chemical characteristics and the production of these amendments can affect their 

effectiveness. The soil characteristics and the incubation time also should be considered. In 

future studies, it is important to verify the long-term effects of these amendments.

4 RELEASE KINETICS OF CADMIUM IN A MINE-WASTE IMPACTED SOIL 

AMENDED WITH BIOCHAR, PHOSPHATE, CALCITE AND BIOSOLIDS 

 

Abstract 

Cadmium (Cd) is a hazardous heavy metal that may cause several problems in human 

health, and new remediation technologies to decrease its environmental risks are necessary. In situ 

remediation is a promissory and low-cost strategy for immobilizing heavy metals in soil. This 

technique is based on the utilization of soil amendments designed to immobilize heavy metals in 

soil, thus decreasing their risks. In this study, Cd release kinetics (by the stirred flow method) and 

sequential extraction were performed in a soil under forest and in a soil near the forest from a 

mining area as a function of the application of rates of biochar, phosphate, calcite, and biosolids. 

Biochar and biosolids were more effective to decrease the desorption kinetics of Cd in the forest 

soil than in the mine soil. Both treatments increased the Cd associated to organic matter (OM), and 

it suggests that part of the Cd was immobilized on the organic compounds provided by these 

amendments.  The desorption kinetics of Cd in both soils was also decreased in samples amended 

with phosphate. A decrease in the fraction associated to carbonate and an increase in the OM 

fraction were observed, suggesting that the P could increase the negative charge on the organic 

compounds. The leaching column performed in the mine showed that the quarter rate and a half rate 

of P increased the leaching of Cd, while the highest rate decreased Cd leaching when compared 

with the unamended soil. The treatment with calcite was more effective to decreased Cd desorption 

kinetics in the mine soil at the initial times (30 min), while the same was observed in the forest soil 

only at 120 min. In both soils, the Cd associated to OM increased after the addition of calcite as it 

could increase the negative charge on the organic matter. 

Keywords: Desorption kinetics; In-situ remediation of soils; Soil pollution; Sequential 

extraction 
 

4.1 Introduction 

Between 1973 and 2016, the world mine production of Cd increased from 17,200 to 

23,000 tonnages, an increase of ~34%.1,2 The contamination of soil by heavy metals due to 

mining activities is pretty common in different places in the world.3 High Cd contents up to 

360 mg kg-1 have been found in soils at Zn-Pb mine sites.4  In addition to mining activities, 

the soil can have an input of heavy metals by atmospheric deposition of aerosol particles,5 

direct applications of agricultural fertilizers,6 agrichemical7 and organic materials, such as 

biosolids8 and livestock manures.9   

The soil contamination by Cd is a global environmental concern that results in 

ecological hazards and human health and also implies huge economic costs with respect to 

reclamation and restoration.10 Cadmium is a heavy metal that can cause several problems in 

the human health, such as cancer,11 damages on the kidney,12 reproductive system,13 

respiratory system,14 and skeletal system.15 The consumption of crops contaminated by Cd 

correspond with &gt;90% of the human exposure in the general population and most of dietary 

Cd is derived from soil via uptake in main food items, i.e. potatoes or cereals.3 The other 



76 

 

 

 

paths to heavy metals exposure may be direct ingestion or contact with contaminated soil and 

drinking of contaminated ground water.16 

The scientific community is focused to develop of soil remediation technologies 

because of the implications of the contaminated soils on animal and human health.17 

Conventional technologies for soil remediation, i.e., landfilling and excavation, are often 

expansive and environmentally unfeasible, as compared to alternative options. The utilization 

of amendments for metal immobilization/solidification are cost effective and less 

environmentally disruptive.18,19 The advantage of immobilize heavy metals in soil by 

amendments are (i) it is low invasive, (ii) simplicity and rapidity, (iii) relatively inexpensive, 

(iv) small amount of wastes are produced, and (vi) covers a broad spectrum of inorganic 

pollutants.20 

Many amendments, such as phosphate,21 alkaline materials,22 biochar,23 and 

biosolids24 have been used to immobilize Cd in soil and decrease its environmental risks. The 

amendments may immobilize the heavy metals due to adsorption, complexation, and 

precipitation reactions, thus making them unavailable for human and plant uptake and 

leaching to groundwater.25 

Many soil chemical processes are time dependent, and evaluation of desorption 

kinetics is crucial for understanding the mobility and availability of metals in contaminated 

soils after the addition of amendments. By means of kinetics desorption it is possible to 

determine the quantities of metal available with greater and slower speed, as well as the 

content not available, and can, therefore, help in predicting its fate over the time.26–28 For 

example, Ren et al.29 evaluated the desorption kinetics of Cd, Zn, and Pb in a soil from a 

mining area and observed that the desorption of Cd had already reached equilibrium after 

three days of reaction, while Pb and Zn only reached after twelve days. According to Ren et 

al.29 , Cd was associated with low-affinity binding sites, while Pb and Zn were mainly 

associated with more specific forms of binding. 

Our research aim was to evaluate if the addition of phosphate, calcite, biochar, and 

biosolids were able to immobilize the Cd in a mine-waste impacted soil from Brazil. Leaching 

column, sequential extraction, and stirred-flow kinetic approaches were performed to evaluate 

the effect of these amendments on Cd mobility.

4.2 Materials and Methods 

4.2.1 Characterization of Soil, Biochar and Biosolids 

The soil samples were collected from the surface layer (0-20 cm) in a deactivated Zn 

mining area and a forest close to the mining area both located in Vazante Minas Gerais, Brazil 

(close to geographic coordinates 17o59’11’’S, 46o54’27” W). The samples were air dried at 

room temperature (~25oC) and passed through a 2-mm sieve. The content of soil organic 

carbon was determined with a Shimadzu TOC-5000 carbon analyzer. The total concentration 

of heavy metals in the soils were extracted following the EPA3051a30 method using a 1:3 

HCl/HNO3, and the metal contents were quantified by inductive couple plasma optical 

emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The content of exchangeable ions and pH analyses 

followed the methods of Ingram and Anderson.31 

The chemical characteristics of the biochar and biosolids are in the Table 1. The 

biochar was produced using sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) straw at the temperature of 

pyrolysis of 450 oC. For more information about the production and characterization of 

biochar see Feola Conz et al.32. The biosolids was produced from the composting of wood 

chips (eucalyptus) and sewage sludge. The composting took place in aerated rows for 60 days 

and was sieving in mesh with 36 mm2 holes. In the composting process, about 2% of 

dolomitic limestone was added to the sludge. The sewage sludge was collected at a sewage 

treatment station located in Jundiai, São Paulo, Brazil and was composed in the major part by 

domestic than industrial sludge. The pH of biosolids was determined in water extracts (1:5 

v/v), CEC was determined following the method described by Sparks33 and the organic C 

content was determined by the Walkley and Black method. The metal (Cd, Zn and Pb) and 

nutrients (P, K, Ca and Mg) concentration in the biochar and biosolids were determined 

following the EPA3051a30 method. 

 

4.2.2 Amendments and Incubation Time 

In triplicate the soils were amended individually with rates of ammonium phosphate 

monobasic (NH4H2PO4), calcite (CaCO3), biochar and biosolids. The soils were amended 

with 2.5; 5 and 10% of biochar34 and 5, 10 and 20% of biosolids.35 The rate of NH4H2PO4 and 

CaCO3 were estimated by the concentration of Cd, Zn and Pb in the soil and was designed to 

promote the precipitation of stable forms. The NH4H2PO4 was applied evenly to the soil at 0 



78 

 

 

 

(control); 0.5 (quarter rate); 1.0 (half rate) and 2:1 (full rate) molar ratio of P to the sum of Cd, 

Zn and Pb. These rates were based on the stoichiometry (P:M =3:5) form of the follow 

precipitate M5(PO4)3OH (M= sum of Zn, Pb and Cd).
36 Calcite (CaCO3) was applied evenly 

to the soil at 0 (control); 0.25 (quarter rate); 0.5 (half rate) and 1:1 (full rate) molar ratio of 

CaCO3 to the sum of Cd, Zn and Pb.
37 The amendments were added and mixed 

homogeneously with the soil and incubated with deionized water at 70% of the maximum 

water retention at 25±2oC in the lab for 60 days. To maintain the humidity, water was added 

every 3 days based on the mass loss of water. 

 

4.2.3 Desorption Kinetics 

The desorption kinetics of Cd was performed using a stirred-flow reactor equipped 

with a pistol displacement pump designed for use in a HPLC system. The stirred-flow 

chamber was 12 mL of volume and 200 mg of mass of amended soil was used to perform the 

desorption (Figure 1). The solution used was Mehlich-3 (0.2M CH3COOH + 

0.25M NH4NO3 + 0.013M HNO3 + 0.015M NH4F + 0.001M EDTA) as a desorption agent. In 

the reactor chamber was used a 25-mm diameter cellulose filter membrane with 0.45 µm pore 

size. The suspension in the reactor was stirred at 300 rpm and the liquid portion of it was 

flowed through the filter in the chamber at a rate of 1 mL min-1. The effluent was collected by 

a fraction collector at 2 min intervals and the concentration of Cd was quantified by ICP-OES. 

The amount of Cd desorbed was calculated according to Yin et al.38 and plotted in cumulative 

Cd desorption percentages.

4.2.4 Sequential Extraction 

The sequential extraction of the amended soils was done according to the procedure 

developed by Silveira et al.39. The original method counts on seven fractions, but the in 

present study we extracted sequentially with 0.1 M CaCl2 for readily exchangeable (F1); 1 M 

NaOAC (pH 5) for carbonates forms (F2); NaOCl (pH 8.5) for organic-matter bound (F3); 

0.2M oxalic acid + 0.2M NH4 oxalate (pH 3) for iron-oxides bound (F4); the residual (F5) 

was determined by digestion according to EPA3051a method using a 1:3 HCl/HNO3
30

 . The 

Cd in each fraction was quantified by ICP-OES. 

 

4.2.5 Leaching Column 

The leaching experiment was conducted using only the soil from the mine area 

amended it with different rates of P. For this study, we used four 5.05-cm diameter (20 cm2 

cross sectional area) columns made from polycarbonate that was previously washed with acid 

and rinsed with distilled water. Twenty-six g of air-dried soil was packed at a bulk density of 

1.3 g cm-3 (1 cm thick) between a 3-cm thick layer of washed sand on the top and on the 

bottom (Figure 2). One pore volume for the soil columns was approximately 10.1 cm3, 

assuming a particle density of 2.65 g cm-3. Deionized water, adjusted to pH of 4.3 with 0.001 

M HNO3, was pumped through the column at a rate of approximately 10 mL h
-1. The pH of 

the solution was based on a previous study that determined the chemical characteristics of the 

rainwater at a southeastern part of Brazil.40 A total of 670 pore volumes of the solution was 

passed through each column and the outflow was collected on a fraction collector in 14-15 

mL increments. We determined the concentration of Cd by ICP-MS and measured the pH in 

the outflow samples to establish breakthrough curves.

4.3 Results and Discussion 

4.3.1 Effects of the Amendments on the Soil Properties  

The concentration of Cd, Zn and Cd in the non-amended and amended soils were 

considered hazardous because their amount exceeded the intervention values adopted by the 

Environmental Agency of the State of São Paulo (Brazil)41 for residential and industrial areas 

(Table 1 and 2). However, the amendments did not affect the heavy metal concentration but 

affected the others chemical properties of the soils.  

The treatment with rates of P decreased the pH and increased the exchangeable P of 

the soils. These changes, were more evident in the mine soil because the amount of P applied 

was higher. According to Sposito42 ammonium-based fertilizers can result in soil 

acidification. The phosphoric acid released by P fertilizers also could decrease the soil pH.43 

The decreasing in the pH due to MAP application already was reported in the literature.44 

Calcite treatment caused a slight increase in the soil pH and also increased the amount of Ca 

exchangeable. The calcite increases the pH due to the neutralization of H+ by the OH- released 

in the reaction of the calcite on the soil (equation 1, 2 and 3).

Both organic amendments (biochar and biosolids) increased the amount of C on the 

soils. Biochar had ~4.5 times more C than biosolids. Although the biochar and biosolids were 

alkaline (Table 3) they had different behavior on the pH in the soil from the forest and from 

mine area. The Biochar decreased the pH of the forest soil and did not have a significant 

effect on the mine soil. On the other hand, biosolids increased a little the pH of the forest and 

decreased the pH of the mine probably because your pH was smaller than mine soil. The pH 

may decreased due to the oxidation of C to form acidic carboxyl groups.45 The forest soil 

probably had more microbial activities and it could favor the biochar degradation resulting in 

the decreasing the soil pH. The application of biochar in soil increase the microbial population 

and microbial activity in soils46,47 and biochar may accelerate the decomposition of soil native 

C by improving microbial populations. 48,49

4.3.2 Effects of the Amendments in the Immobilization of Cadmium 

4.3.2.1 Phosphate 

The behavior of Cd differed among the rates of P and soils. The results of desorption 

kinetics, sequential extraction, and leaching columns are presented in Fig 3 to 7. The results 

of desorption kinetics showed us that the desorption of Cd decreased due to rates of 

Phosphate. This decrease was more pronounced in the first 30 min for the mine soil whereas 

the forest soil was after 120 min (Figure 3 and 4). In the first 30 minutes, the amount of Cd 

desorbed in the mine soil ranged from 9.2 to 8.3% for rates of P, while the untreated soil was 

11.5%. However, this difference decreased after 120 minutes for some rates of P.  

At 120 min, the amount desorbed in the forest soil ranged from 9.8 to 8.1% for rates 

of P while it was 9.5% in the untreated soil. The efficiency of phosphate compounds to 

immobilize Cd in soils is well documented in the literature.37,50,51. Basta et al.37 investigated 

the effect of P in the immobilization of Cd in a soil collected in a smelter site in Northeastern 

Oklahoma, USA. They observed a reduction of 53% and 94% on the elution of Cd due to the 

treatment with rock phosphate and diammonium phosphate, respectively. Based on the use of 

geochemical computer speciation modeling, Basta et al.37 concluded that the Cd phosphate 

was the most probable solid phase formed after diammonium phosphate treatment.  

Phosphate increase the immobilization in soils through various chemical process such 

as direct adsorption/substitution by P compounds, P anion-induced metal adsorption and 

precipitation.52 The P may improve the soil negative surface charge, and it increases Cd 

sorption.53 Adhikori and Singh54 suggested the following sorption mechanisms resulted from 

P application: (i) precipitation of Cd as Cd3(PO4)2, (ii) sorption of Cd-P complexes, (iii) 

surface complex formation of Cd onto sorbed P, and (iv) P-induced Cd sorption. Cadmium 

phosphate [Cd3(PO4)2] may control Cd solubility in soils before immobilization treatments.

Figure 3. Cumulative Cd desorption (%) Mehlich-3 in the mining area amended with 

phosphate, calcite, biochar and biosolids in different rates. 

 

Cadmium in the forest soil was distributed almost 100% in the F4 (bounded to iron 

oxides) while the most part the mine soil was in the F2 (carbonate forms) and F3 (organic 

matter bound) (Figure 5 and 6). The treatment with rates of P did not have a significant effect 

(p &amp;lt;0.05) in the forest, but this treatment decreased the Cd in the F2 and increased in the F3 

in the mine soil. The increase of the Cd in the F3 could be due to the increase in the negative 

charge in the minerals or organic compounds.  

The adsorption of specifically ligands such as H2PO4
- and HPO4

2- in strongly 

weathered and variable charge soils can induce Cd (II) adsorption through increased negative 

surface charge.56,57 On the other hand, Wang et al.58 evaluated the effectiveness of 

amendments to immobilize heavy metals in a contaminated soil form a crop land in the 

vicinity of a galvanized factory in Fuyang district, China, and observed that the soil amended 

with triple superphosphate increased the Cd bound to iron-manganese oxides fraction and 

decreased in the exchangeable fraction. The different results were probably because of 

differences in the sequential extraction methods, the sources of contamination, the soil 

characteristics and the source of P used as amendments. 



84 

 

 

 

 

Figure 4. Cumulative Cd desorption after extraction with Mehlich-3 solution in the forest 

amended with phosphate, calcite, biochar and biosolids ate different rates. 

 

The amount of Cd in the leached increased in the quarter rate and half rate of P 

(Figure 7). However, the full rate leached less Cd than unamended soil. The reduction of Cd 

adsorption in presence of P in soils is attributed to the formation of Cd-P complexes in 

solution.59 The pH of the leached in the all rates of P started around 6.5 and increased until 7.4 

when more water passed through the column. The low pH in the initial leaching was probably 

due to the dissociation of NH4
+ and H2PO4

- in the solution provided by the NH4H2PO4 used as 

a source of P. Fertilizers with high NH4
+ amounts reduce the soil pH42 and may increase the 

content of Cd on the soil solution.53 The treatments that the faster pH decreases were the same 

with the highest Cd releases. In other words, the rate of quarter of P decreased more the pH 

and increased Cd release in comparison with the other rates. The increase of Cd concentration 

on the solution could be associated with the decrease in the soil pH and presumably with the 

desorption of Cd from exchange sites on soil colloids.60 

 



85 

 

4.3.2.2 Calcite  

Calcite was more effective to immobilize Cd in the forest soil than in the mine soil. In 

the mine soil the rates of calcite decreased the Cd release in the initials times (0 to 30 min) 

(Figure 3). In the first 30 min the cumulative desorption in the mine soil amended with rates 

of calcite ranged from 9.3 to 10.7%, while in the unamended soil it was 11.5%. However, 

after 120 min, the cumulative desorption of the amended soil was bigger or equal the 

unamended soil. The amount desorbed was 15.2, 16.1, 15.5 and, 15.2% for the full rate, half 

rate, quarter rate and unamended soil, respectively. The decrease of the release of Cd during 

the first 30 min could be due to the buffering capacity caused by the calcite. Considering that 

the mine soil was already alkaline (Table 3), this favored so that calcite remained without 

reacting on the soil.  

The treatment with calcite increased the Cd extracted in the F3 (organic matter 

bound) (Figure 5). The other fractions did not have significant changes. Calcite reduces the 

H+ concentration and increase the negative charges sites52, and this could increase the 

adsorption of Cd in the organic matter. Soil organic matter is one of the most important soil 

components controlling the heavy metal adsorption and desorption in the soil. It has two 

important binding sites that are carboxylic and phenolic groups that controlling metal binding, 

and each type of binding site formed through various combinations of those two types of sites 

have distinct thermodynamic properties, such as the proton and metal binding constants.62–

64Organic matter of the soil sorb the Cd at negatively charged carboxylic and phenolic groups 

or directly with these and other groups forming monodentate or multidentate bonding 

(chelation).61

matter associated. F4 = oxide, and F5 = residual (most strongly bound). Columns followed by 

the same letter do not differ at 0.05 (Tukey test). 

 

The amount of Cd released during all the time (0 to 120 min) in the forest soil was 

smaller in all rates of calcite compared to the unamended soil (Figure 4). The cumulative 

desorption after 120 min was 6.9, 6.4, 6.5 and 9.6% for the full rate, half rate, quarter rate and 

unamended soil, respectively. The decreasing in the Cd desorption in this soil amended with 

rates of calcite probably occurred due to the increase in the pH. This soil attribute is the most 

dominant factor influencing Cd sorption in soils.65,66  

The increase in the pH increase the negative surface charge in the iron oxides, 

organic matter and phyllosilicates.67 Cd decreased in the F4 (iron oxides bound) and increased 

in the F3 (organic matter bound) (Figure 6), and this could happen because the pH increased 

the negative charge in the organic matter and favored the Cd bound as discussed before.

same letter do not differ at 0.05 (Tukey test). 

 

4.3.2.3 Biosolids  

The treatment with biosolids was effective to immobilize Cd in both soils (Figure 3 

and 4). However, the effectiveness was more evident in the forest soil than in the mine soil. In 

the first 30 min, the amount of Cd desorbed in the mine soil ranged from 10.8 to 9.4% while it 

was 11.5% in the unamended soil. After 120 min the amount desorbed was 16.1, 14.1, 15.3 

and 15.2% for the 5%, 10%, 20%, and unamended soil, respectively. This showed that 

biosolids was effective to reduce the amount released in the initial times (30 min) but with a 

higher time of desorption (120 min) they were pretty similar to the unamended soil. On the 

other hand, the forest soil amended with rates of biosolids was effective to decrease Cd 

desorption in all time (0 to 120 min). The cumulative desorption after 120 min was 6.5, 7.6, 

8.3 and 9.6% for the 5%, 10%, 20% and unamended soil, respectively.  



88 

 

 

 

The biosolids increased the amount of Cd extracted in the F3 (organic matter bound) 

for both soils (Figure 5 and 6). Nevertheless, in the forest soil, the Cd in the F3 increased 70% 

for the rate of 20% whereas this increase was only 10% in the mine soil. These results 

indicate that the biosolids increased the Cd bounded to organic compounds on the soil due to 

organic matter present in this amendment. The biosolids contains significant quantities of 

organic matter and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus.68–70 Also, the organic matter 

from biosolids may increase the pH, cation exchange capacity and sorption sites might affect 

sorption of heavy metals in soils.71–73   

The forest soil had an increase in the pH due the biosolids application. This also may 

help to increase the immobilization of Cd. The biosolids also could increase the DOC on the 

soil and form Cd-DOC. These organic compounds may decrease, increase or have no effect 

on Cd sorption.61

of phosphate applied in the mine soil. 

 

4.3.2.4 Biochar 

The results of desorption kinetics and sequential extraction varied between the rates 

of biochar applied (Figure 3 to 6). As biosolids, the biochar was more effective to reduce the 

Cd release in the forest soil than mine soil. The cumulative desorption in the first 30 min for 

the mine soil was 10.3, 8.7, 11.0 and 11.5% for the rate of 2.5%, 5%, 10% and unamended 

soil, respectively (Figure 3). For the forest soil, the cumulative desorption was 6.1, 5.1, 3.9 

and 5.9 for the rate of 2.5%, 5%, 10% and unamended soil, respectively (Figure 4). In the 



89 

 

mine soil the cumulative Cd desorbed after 120 min was 15.7, 15.4, 14.5 and 15.2 for the rate 

of 2.5%, 5%, 10% and unamended soil, respectively, while for the forest soil, the cumulative 

desorption was 10.1, 8.0, 7.2 and 9.6% for the rates of 2.5%, 5%, 10% and unamended soil, 

respectively.  

In the forest, the rate of 5% and 10% had a smaller cumulative desorption after 120 

and only the rate of 2.5% had a higher release in comparison with the unamended soil. But, 

for the mine soil, only the rate of 10% had a smaller cumulative desorption of Cd after 120 

min. Puga et al.74 evaluated the effect of rates of biochar in a soil from a Zn mining area in 

Vazante. They also utilized biochar produced from sugar cane straw but different temperature 

of pyrolysis (700 oC) and incubation time (120 days). The authors74 observed a linear 

reduction of the available Cd in soil extracted by EDTA due to the rates (1.5, 3.0 and 5.0%, 

w/w) of biochar applied. The immobilization of Cd by the biochar application have previously 

been reported.23,75–77 

The treatment with biochar in both soils decreased the Cd in the F4 (iron oxides 

bound) and increased in the F3 (organic matter bound) (Figure 5 and 6). The biochar 

increased the amount of C in both soils, and that is in agreement with the results of the 

sequential extraction where the amount of Cd in the F3 (organic matter bound) increased. 

Curiously, Wang et al.58 did not observe increase in the Cd extracted in the organic matter 

fraction in a soil amended with pine biochar, but found a decrease in the exchangeable 

fraction. However, in their soil, almost 60% of the Cd was extracted in the exchangeable 

fraction, while in our soils they were between 10 for the mine soil and 0% for the forest soil. 

This shows that the species of Cd present in their soil probably were different from ours. 

Another explanation for these differences is that they incubated the soil only for 5 days, 

whereas we used 60 days, and probably the biochar did not have enough time to react with the 

soil. The chemical characteristics of the soil and biochar also could have influenced these 

differences.   

Feedstock type and pyrolysis condition are the main factors influencing the sorption 

behavior of biochars.78 Biochar has a high carbon content,79 stable physical and chemical 

properties and large specific surface area with good adsorption capacity for heavy metals and 

ions.58 Biochar may have high sorption ability from three reasons: (i) electrostatic interactions 

negatively charged carbon surface and metal cations; (ii) ionic exchange between ionizable 

protons at the surface of acidic carbon and metal cations and (iii) sorptive interaction 

involving delocalized electrons of carbon.80

4.4 Summary and Conclusions 

Some amendments were effective to immobilize Cd in the soil from mining area and 

adjacent forest. In the mining soil amended with phosphate, the desorption kinetics of Cd 

decreased more in the initial times (30 min) and the half rate and quarter rate of phosphate 

were more effective to decrease the desorption after 120 min of cumulative desorption. For 

the forest soil, the half rate and quarter rate of phosphate also were most effective to decrease 

Cd desorption. The results of sequential did not show different between the Cd extracted in 

each fraction for the forest soil. On the other hand, in the soil from mining area, the Cd 

contents decreased in the carbonate forms and increased in the organic matter bound forms. 

This is an evidence that the treatment with phosphate may have increased the negative charge 

in the organic matter, thus favoring the Cd bound and decreasing its desorption. Cd also may 

have precipitated with stable phosphate species.  The half rate and the quarter rate of 

phosphate leached more Cd in the mining soil than the unamended soil. The amount leached 

followed the pH of the leached solution, indicating that this attribute may control Cd 

desorption. The increase in Cd leached in the half rate and quarter rate could be attributed to 

the formation of Cd-P complexes in the solution. 

Calcite was more effective to reduce the cumulative Cd desorption in the forest than 

in the mine soil. In the mining soil, this treatment decreased the cumulative Cd desorbed in 

the first 30 min and was almost equal to the unamended soil after 120 min.  In the forest soil, 

all rates of calcite had less cumulative desorption of Cd than in the unamended soil after 120 

min. In both soils, the Cd extracted in the F3 (organic matter bound) increased, and it shows 

that addition of calcite increased the pH and increased the negative charges site on the organic 

matter. The calcite also could increase the buffering capacity in the mining soil because this 

soil already was alkaline. 

The organic amendments (biochar and biosolids) were effective to decrease the 

amount of Cd desorbed in the kinetics experiment. However, the decrease in the Cd 

desorption was more pronounced in the forest than in the mine soil. In the mine soil the rate 

of 2.5 and 5% of biochar decreased the cumulative desorption in the initial time (30 min). 

However, after 120 min, the desorption was almost equal to the unamended soil. The same 

behavior was observed for the rate of 5 and 10% of biosolids. On the other hand, in the forest 

soil, except for the rate of 2.5% of biochar, the rates of biochar and biosolids decreased the 

cumulative desorption of Cd than unamended soil. Both amendments increased the Cd 



91 

 

extracted in the F3 (organic matter bound), and these results indicate that Cd was probably 

adsorbed on the organic matter compounds provided by the biochar and biosolids.

5 FINAL REMARKS 

 

The soil amendments had different behaviors in the immobilization of Zn, Pb, and Cd 

in soils. In general, phosphate was effective to decrease Zn, Pb, and Cd desorption. The 

decrease in Pb desorption was probably due to the formation of pyromorphite that was 

identified by the bulk XANES. The full rate of P increased Zn desorption probably because of 

the decrease in the pH thus causing the formation of ZnO (identified by the µ-XANES and 

bulk XANES) that is more soluble than the other species identified, such as Zn-kerolite. After 

phosphate addition, most parts of Zn species was changed to Zn-P. On the other hand, the 

quarter rate and the half rate were effective to decrease Zn desorption, suggesting either the 

formation of more stable species such as Zn-P or the adsorption to the soil constituents. 

Phosphate also was more effective to decrease Cd desorption in the half rate and quarter rate, 

thus suggesting the formation of Cd-P species, or due to an increase in the negative charge in 

the surface of mineral or organic compounds.  

Calcite was effective to increase Zn, Pb, and Cd immobilization in the soil. Even 

though we did not observe differences in Zn species by the bulk XANES, the results of 

desorption kinetics showed that calcite decreased Zn desorption in all rates applied, but the 

quarter rate and half rate were most effective. The LCF of the Pb in the soil amended with 

calcite showed that some species (Pb-bentonite and anglesite) were changed to pyromorphite. 

All rates of calcite desorbed almost the same amount of Pb. Calcite decreased the Cd 

desorption kinetics in the initial times in the mining soil, and the full rate was the most 

effective, while all rates desorbed almost the same amount of Cd in the forest soil. The 

sequential extraction suggested that part of Cd was immobilized on the organic matter as a 

result of the calcite treatment. 

Biochar was effective to decrease Zn desorption and was more effective in the rate of 

5%. No differences were observed in the Zn bulk XANES spectra but, in the sequential 

extraction experiment, Zn increased in the F3 (organic matter- OM associated) and F4 (iron 

oxides associated) fractions, which suggests that these two fractions could have immobilized 

the element. Biochar increased the desorption kinetics of Pb in all rates utilized. Part of Pb 

species was modified to Pb-citrate, and this species could have caused the increase of Pb 

mobility. The results of sequential extraction showed an increase in the Pb extracted in the 

OM fraction, which is evidence that Pb could have associated with organic compounds. 

Different from Pb, the desorption kinetics of Cd decreased due to biochar applications, and

the results of sequential extraction suggested that Cd could have been immobilized on the 

organic matter. 

Biosolids also decreased Zn desorption and was most effective in the rate of 10%. As 

occurred with biochar, no differences were found in the bulk XANES spectra of this 

treatment, but the sequential extraction showed an increase in the Zn associated to OM (F3). 

Biosolids increased Pb desorption in all rates. By LCF we identified Pb-citrate and PbCl2 that 

could have been responsible for increasing Pb mobility. Biosolids also decreased the 

desorption kinetics of Cd for the mining and forest soil, and caused an increase in the Cd 

extracted in the OM fraction, thus suggesting that Cd was immobilized by organic 

compounds, as occurred with biochar. 

The combination of synchrotron-based techniques, desorption kinetics and sequential 

extraction are powerful tools to evaluate the behavior of heavy metals in contaminated soils 

after the addition of amendments. Our results will may help to develop an/or improve modern 

and effective strategies to remediate mine waste contaminated soils. The heavy metals had 

different behaviors as affected by the addition of amendments. An interesting result is that the 

half rate and quarter rate were more effective to decrease the mobility of heavy metals than 

the full rate in some treatments, and this information is important to create some more cost-

effective and sustainable solutions. 

Future researches may focus on the effect of the mixing effect of different 

amendments. Soils contaminated with multiple elements such ours may need to be remediated 

with different amendments because one amendment could immobilize one element and 

mobilize another one. The effect of incubation time and other sources of amendments should 

also be detailed in future researches.
