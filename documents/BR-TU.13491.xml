ABSTRACT
Introduction: Abdominal palpation and ultrasound findings among patients from an endemic 
area for schistosomiasis in Brazil who had been followed up for 27 years were compared. 
Methods: In 2004, 411 patients from Brejo do Espírito Santo, in the State of Bahia, were 
selected for the present investigation after giving their written informed consent. Based on 
clinical data, they were divided into three groups: 41 patients with evidence of liver fibrosis in 
2004 (Group 1); 102 patients with evidence of liver fibrosis in the past (1976-1989) but not 
in 2004 (Group 2); and 268 patients without evidence of liver fibrosis at any time during the 
27-year follow-up (Group 3). All of the patients underwent abdominal ultrasound in which 
the examiner did not know the result from the clinical examination. The data were stored in a 
database. Results: The prevalence of periportal fibrosis on ultrasound was 82.9%, 56.9% and 
13.4% in Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In the presence of hard, nodular liver or prominent 
left lobe and a hard palpable spleen, ultrasound revealed periportal fibrosis in 70.9%. However, 
periportal fibrosis was diagnosed using ultrasound in 25.4% of the patients in the absence of 
clinical evidence of liver involvement. Thus, ultrasound diagnosed periportal fibrosis 3.1 times 
more frequently than clinical examination did. Conclusions: Although clinical examination 
is important in evaluating morbidity due to Manson’s schistosomiasis in endemic areas, 
ultrasound is more accurate in diagnosing liver involvement and periportal fibrosis. 
Key-words: Schistosomiasis. Abdominal ultrasound. Clinical examination. Periportal fibrosis.

RESUMO
Introdução: Neste estudo, se comparou os achados da palpação abdominal e do ultrassom 
em pacientes de área endêmica de esquistossomose que foram acompanhados por 27 anos no 
Brasil. Métodos: Em 2004, 411 pacientes de Brejo do Espírito Santo, no estado da Bahia, após 
consentimento informado e por escrito foram selecionados para o presente estudo. Baseando-se no 
exame clínico eles foram divididos em 3 grupos: 41 (Grupo 1) com evidência de fibrose hepática 
no ano de 2004; 102 (Grupo 2) com evidência de fibrose hepática no passado (1976-1989) mas 
não em 2004; e 268 (Grupo 3) sem evidência de fibrose hepática em 27 anos de seguimento. 
Todos foram submetidos a exame ultrassonográfico do abdome em que o examinador não sabia 
o resultado do exame clínico. Os dados foram armazenados em banco de dados. Resultados: 
A prevalência de fibrose periportal ao ultrassom foi de 82,9%, 56,9% e 13,4% nos Grupos 1, 2 e 
3, respectivamente. Na presença de fígado duro, nodular ou lobo esquerdo proeminente e baço 
palpável duro, o ultra-som revelou fibrose periportal em 70,9%. Porém, fibrose periportal foi 
diagnosticada através do ultrassom em 25,4% dos pacientes, na ausência de evidência clínica 
de envolvimento hepático. Assim, o ultrassom diagnosticou fibrose periportal 3,1 vezes mais 
frequentemente que o exame clínico. Conclusões: O exame clínico tem importância na avaliação 
da morbidade da esquistossomose mansônica em áreas endêmicas, mas o ultrassom mostra-se 
mais preciso quando se pretende diagnosticar o envolvimento hepático e a fibrose periportal.

Periportal fibrosis, first described by Symmers 
in 19041, can produce portal hypertension and the 
formation of gastroesophageal varices. Rupture of 
these varices causes digestive hemorrhage, the most 
frequent and feared complication of hepatosplenic 
Manson’s schistosomiasis. The hepatosplenic form is 
the usual clinical counterpart of periportal fibrosis. 
In clinical-epidemiological studies conducted in 
endemic areas, morbidity used to be evaluated only 
on the basis of physical examination of the abdomen. 
However, there is no consensus about the clinical 
parameters of the liver and spleen that should be 
considered in the evaluation. Hepatomegaly and 
splenomegaly have no uniform definition. The limit 
for determining that an increase in liver volume has 
occurred remains a debatable issue. 

Some investigators consider hepatomegaly to be 
present when the organ exceeds the costal margin 
by 5cm along the sternal line or by 4cm along the 
midclavicular line2. Others accept enlargement to be 
present if the liver is palpable 2cm below the costal 
margin3 or simply if the liver is palpable4, without 
mentioning whether this organ is palpable at rest or 
during inspiration. Yet other investigators attribute 
more importance to liver characteristics such as hard 
consistency, presence of nodules on the liver surface 
or prominence of the left lobe5. Regarding the spleen, 
palpability would be sufficient for some physicians6-8, 
whereas others believe that the spleen should be 
palpable at the costal margin or beyond it9. Thus, 
the diagnosis of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis varies 
according to the different criteria mentioned.

The routine use of abdominal ultrasound 
examination has been of great help in studying 
schistosomiasis because it enables identification 
of periportal fibrosis10-14. It also provides other 
important information such as sound evidence 
of portal hypertension and can measure or better 
estimate organ sizes15-18.

RESULTS

METHODS

The present study was designed to compare clinical and 
abdominal ultrasound findings in order to determine: a) whether 
clinical alterations suggestive of liver and/or spleen involvement 
in schistosomiasis are confirmed by ultrasound; b) the association 
between periportal fibrosis and other ultrasound findings; and c) the 
agreement between organ sizes measured by clinical examination 
and by ultrasound. 

Study population 
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Brejo do Espírito Santo 

in 2004, a rural community in the municipality of Santa Maria da 
Vitória, Bahia; this area does not present malaria transmission but 
is considered hyperendemic for schistosomiasis. A total of 3,766 
people have been followed up since 1976 by means of clinical and 
fecal examinations (Kato-Katz technique)19, and control measures 
have been implemented. 

Physical examination
The same methodology for clinical evaluation was used on all 

occasions. The right hepatic lobe was examined on the anterior 
axillary line and the left lobe on the line through the xiphoid 
appendix. If it exceeded the costal margin, it was measured in 
centimeters. When the liver was palpable, it was determined whether 
its consistency was flaccid (lip consistency), slightly hardened (nose 
tip consistency) or hard (bone consistency), and whether its surface 
was smooth or nodular. Prominence of the left lobe was defined 
when this lobe was clearly larger than the right lobe5. The spleen was 
palpated and measured under the costal margin and its consistency 
was determined. We defined splenomegaly as present only when 
the spleen was palpable below the left costal margin. The following 
clinical forms were described: hepatointestinal (palpable liver), 
hepatointestinal with advanced hepatic lesions (at least one of the 
following: hard, nodular or prominent left liver lobe), hepatosplenic 
(hepatointestinal with advanced liver lesions plus splenomegaly) and 
postsurgical hepatosplenic (histologically proven periportal fibrosis 
confirmed during surgery)9.

Patients with hepatosplenic or hepatointestinal schistosomiasis 
with advanced hepatic lesions were assumed to have periportal 
fibrosis and therefore severe clinical disease9. Regarding hepatosplenic 
patients who under went surgery, only those with hard and/or 
nodular liver and/or prominent left lobe were assumed to have liver 
fibrosis. 

Based on clinical examinations performed by one of us (AP) 
just before the field visit of the present study (2004), the patients 
who were invited to participate in this study were divided into three 
groups: 41 patients with clinical evidence of liver disease (Group 1); 
102 patients with evidence of liver disease in the past (1976-1989) 
but not in 2004 (Group 2); and 268 patients without evidence of liver 
disease at any time during the 27-year follow-up (Group 3). 

Abdominal ultrasound 
The abdominal ultrasound examination was performed using 

a GE LOGIQ 100 instrument with a convex 3.5 MHz transducer. 
We used indicators of periportal fibrosis proposed by the Niamey 
Working Group (Niamey-Belo Horizonte classification)20,21. In 
accordance with this protocol, periportal fibrosis was classified 
in degrees (incipient, possible, probable, definite, advanced and 

advanced with portal hypertension). The following other parameters 
were also evaluated: hepatic contours, left lobe hypertrophy, right 
lobe atrophy, splenomegaly and thickening of the gallbladder wall. 
The measurements (walls of the intrahepatic portal branches, caliber 
of the portal vein, left lobe, right lobe and spleen) were adjusted for 
the patient's height16.

Statistical analysis
 The data were analyzed using the SPSS program for Windows 

(Version 10.0; Copyright® SPSS Inc., 1989-1999). After performing 
descriptive analysis of normality and homogeneity of variance, the 
data were analyzed using the Student's t, Pearson and McNemar chi-
square tests. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated. The kappa 
(k) concordance index was using as an estimate of reproducibility. 
In all cases, the null hypothesis was rejected when a was less than 
5% (p &amp;lt;0.05).

Etical
All clinical, laborator y and ultrasound examinations were 

performed following a masked protocol. The study protocol was 
approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the University of 
the Triângulo Mineiro, Federal University of Minas Gerais and the 
Brazilian National Research Ethics Committee (CONEP).

A total of 411 patients were studied (199 men and 212 women). 
The mean ages in years for groups 1, 2 and 3 were: 50.3 ± 12.6, 
50.5 ± 12.9 and 39.8 ± 20.5, respectively. Group 3 volunteers were 
significantly younger than the individuals in groups 1 and 2. 

Table 1 shows that, from 1976 to 2004, there were marked 
decreases in the prevalence of S. mansoni infection and in the parasitic 
load, as well as a significant decrease in the proportion of patients 
with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. 

In Group 1, eight (19.5%) patients had hepatointestinal 
schistosomiasis with advanced liver lesions and 33 (80.5%) had 
hepatosplenic disease. Among the latter, 11 (33.3%) had undergone 
splenectomy. The clinical findings are summarized in Table 2.

Abdominal ultrasound
Periportal fibrosis was detected in 128 (31.1%) out of the 411 

participants. Most of the patients with severe fibrosis were in Group 
1 (Figure 1). The mean ages for patients with and without fibrosis 
were 52 and 34 years respectively (p &amp;lt;0.01). There was no gender 
difference. 

The liver and spleen sizes of the different groups are presented in 
Table 3. Ultrasound showed irregular hepatic contours in 11 patients 
(3%) and gallbladder wall thickening in 114 (29.2%). 

Concordance between clinical and abdominal ultrasound 
examination 

There was no relation between palpable right (192/266) or 
left (153/228) liver lobes and periportal fibrosis on ultrasound. 
Periportal fibrosis was present in 50 (36.8%) of the 136 patients 
with a non-palpable right lobe, and in 74 (27.8%) of the 266 with a 
palpable right liver lobe. Hence, periportal fibrosis was more frequent 
when the right liver lobe was non-palpable (p = 0.001). 

There was a statistically significant association between presence 
of a palpable left liver lobe and periportal fibrosis (p = 0.001), and

this finding was more apparent in Group 1. Eleven (78.6%) out of the 
14 patients with a hardened liver, 32 (66.7%) out of the 46 patients 
with a slightly hardened liver and 46 (19.7%) out of the 233 patients 
with a flaccid liver had periportal fibrosis on ultrasound. Periportal 
fibrosis was also found in seven (87.5%) out of the eight patients with 
nodular liver and in 78 (27.6%) out of the 283 patients with smooth 
liver surface. Periportal fibrosis was detected in 19 (70.4%) out of 
the 27 patients with a prominent left lobe and in 107 (28.5%) out of 
the 375 patients without a prominent left lobe. All these differences 
were statistically significant (p=0.001). These associations were not 
observed with portal hypertension.

Periportal fibrosis was present in 61 (24.2%) out of the 252 
patients with a non-palpable spleen, and in 24 (22.9%) of the 105 
patients with a spleen that was only palpable during deep inspiration. 
Interestingly, 16 (72.7%) out of the 22 patients presenting enlarged 
spleen had periportal fibrosis (p&lt;0.004) and portal hypertension 
(p&lt;0.004). A hardened spleen was also associated with periportal 
fibrosis (16 out of 17 patients) and portal hypertension (14 out of 
17 patients) (p&lt;0.001). 

In Group 1, 34/41 (82.9%) showed periportal fibrosis on 
ultrasound, and among them, 23 (67.7%) had portal hypertension. 
In Group 2, 58/102 (56.9%) had periportal fibrosis, and 18 (31%) 
had portal hypertension. In Group 3, 36/269 (13.4%) had periportal 
fibrosis and three (8.3%) had portal hypertension (Figure 1). Groups 
2 and 3 were pooled together and compared with Group 1, and this 
showed that periportal fibrosis was significantly higher in Group 1 
(p&lt;0.001).  

Compar ison bet ween other ultrasound f indings and 
periportal fibrosis 

Thirty-seven (66.1%) out of the 56 patients with right liver lobe 
atrophy had periportal fibrosis, as opposed to 89 (25.5%) out of the 
349 patients with normal right liver lobe (p &amp;lt;0.0001). This was not 
observed for the left liver lobe. 

Twenty-three (60.5%) out of the 38 patients with splenomegaly 
diagnosed using ultrasound had periportal fibrosis, as opposed to 84 (24.1%) 
out of the 348 without splenomegaly (p &amp;lt;0.001). Splenomegaly was 
also associated with portal hypertension (Table 3).

Irregular hepatic contours and thickening of the gallbladder wall 
were associated with periportal fibrosis (Table 3). A good agreement 
was found between gallbladder wall thickening and periportal fibrosis 
(kappa = 0.8).

Comparison of liver and spleen size determined on clinical 
examination and ultrasound 

Twenty-eight (50.9%) out of the 55 patients who had right 
liver lobe atrophy on ultrasound had a palpable liver. Conversely, 
50 (30.5%) out of the 164 patients with an enlarged left lobe on 
ultrasound had a non-palpable left liver lobe. 

Among the 125 patients with a palpable spleen, ultrasound 
confirmed the presence of splenomegaly in 31 (24.8%). On the 
other hand, six (15.8%) out of the 38 patients with splenomegaly 
on ultrasound had a non-palpable spleen. 

DISCUSSION

Palpable right liver lobe and palpable spleen are not good indicators of 
periportal fibrosis in field-based work. Among the cases of a prominent, 
hard nodular palpable liver, ultrasound revealed periportal fibrosis in 
70.9%. It is worth noting that periportal fibrosis occurred in 25.4% of 
the patients without clinical evidence of liver involvement. In addition, 
ultrasound diagnosed periportal fibrosis 3.1 times more frequently than 
clinical examination would suggest. Even in the cases with severe periportal 
fibrosis on ultrasound, with or without portal hypertension, ultrasound 
diagnosed 2.1 times more cases than clinical examination did. 

Regarding the size of the right liver lobe, there was more fibrosis when 
this lobe was non-palpable and even more when the lobe was found to 
be atrophic by ultrasound, as has been previously reported2, 11.

With reference to the size of the left hepatic lobe, Houston et al22 
obser ved that hepatomegaly showed high specificity (94%),  
but low (28%) sensitivity as a fibrosis marker. It is common 
knowledge that the liver size decreases with increasing degree of 
fibrosis15, 22-24. Doehring-Schwedtsfeger et al25 found no relationship 
between liver size and periportal fibrosis on ultrasound. In the present 
study, the association between left liver lobe beyond the costal margin 
and periportal fibrosis was important only for Group 1, when the left

lobe was also prominent. Thus, we do not think that increased left 
lobe size alone is a good clinical marker of hepatic fibrosis. When 
analyzing left lobe hypertrophy on ultrasound, Cerri et al11 and 
Kardorff et al2 detected correlation with portal fibrosis, a finding that 
was not confirmed in our study.

A distinction should be made between small and large spleen sizes. 
Only in individuals with large spleens has a relationship with liver fibrosis 
been found. Thus, in endemic areas, the importance of small palpable 
spleens is uncertain; it may or may not be related to schistosomiasis 
(initial stages of the disease). Other causes of splenomegaly should be 
investigated, as reported by Lambertucci et al26.

In our study, we also detected a relationship between clinical 
splenomegaly and the WHO fibrosis patterns25,27-32. In addition, 
patients with severe periportal fibrosis without splenomegaly were 
also found30,33. Splenomegaly diagnosed using ultrasound was related 
both to the presence of the WHO patterns and of periportal fibrosis, 
as already described11,20.

The liver was found by ultrasound to have irregular contours in 
individuals who had current or past clinical evidence suggestive of 
periportal fibrosis. However, the absence of irregular contours did 
not rule out periportal fibrosis. Their presence, as well as gallbladder 
wall thickening, correlated with periportal fibrosis but not with portal 
hypertension. This finding has been reported before 2,14,20,25. In one 
study, the finding of gallbladder wall thickening was also suggestive 
of non-reversal of liver fibrosis31.

No agreement was found between ultrasound and clinical 
examination regarding organ size, as already reported 34. One 
advantage of the Niamey–Belo Horizonte protocol is the adjustment 
of the measurements to the patients’ height21. Nonetheless, we 
occasionally still detected periportal thickening or dilatation of the 
portal vein in individuals with no qualitative signs of fibrosis on 
ultrasound (WHO patterns). 

Although ultrasound is superior to clinical examination for 
detection of periportal fibrosis, it does not allow evaluation of 
important data such as liver and spleen consistency. On the other 
hand, the subjectivity of clinical examination was unexpectedly 
demonstrated in the present study: the prevalence of hepatointestinal 
schistosomiasis with advanced liver disease increased from 4% in 
1976 to 14.8% in 1980 and that of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis from 
8% to 10.7% (Table 1). After a careful investigation, it was noted that 
a different physician was responsible for the clinical examination in 
the study area in 1980.

Brejo do Espírito Santo has not been a hyperendemic area for 
schistosomiasis since the implementation of control measures, which 
started in 1976. The current clinical and ultrasound findings, many 
of them slight and some in a regression phase, represent the sequelae 
from lesions that previously were severe. These were established in the 
past when S. mansoni transmission was high. The implementation of 
effective measures has changed the disease profile in this area, along 
with the emergence of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. However, it 
is important to emphasize that severe disease persists even after 
achieving a good control of transmission31.

In conclusion, although clinical examination is still important in 
evaluating morbidity due to Manson’s schistosomiasis in endemic 
areas, ultrasound is more accurate in diagnosing liver involvement 
and periportal thickening.
