Acknowledgements

I would to express my great appreciation to my advisor Professor Ilson C. A. da Silveira.

His insatiable hunger for knowledge and perfection allowed me to gather an invaluable expe-

rience and skill from these two years of MsC at the Instituto Oceanografico of Universidade

of Sao Paulo. Although he not always agreed, but always supported my final decisions.

I would also like to offer my special thanks to my coadvisor Professor Paulo H. R. Calil

from the Instituto de Oceanografia (IO) of Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG),

whose help not only allowed me to achieve the MsC program, but also perfected my critical

thinking as a way to draw better conclusions on my recent scientific career. His blunt, yet

clear advisement was, in a way, reflected on this work.

I am also particularly grateful for the assistance given by Prossefor Pedro Peixoto of

Instituto de Matematica e Estatistica (IME) of USP. His advanced mathematical knowledge

helped me develop the model given in this dissertation. There is not a doubt that without his

help this model would not have achieve my expectations. I also hope we are able to maintain

future work relationship.

I also wish to acknowledge the help provided by Professor Wandrey Watanabe, Master

Iury Souza, Vadim Harlamov, Dante Napolitano, Master Dalton Sasaki, that not only pro-

vided me with sanity checks, but also indubitably were part of the work performed in this

dissertation. Their knowledge upon various subjects also gave me a sense humility.

I express my gratitude aswell to my classmates and coleagues, Felipe Vilela, Pedro Walfir

Souza Filho, Caique Dias Luko, Caue Zimberger Lazaneo, Laura Sobral Verona, Marina

Noro, and Paula Birocchi. These friends surely helped me to relief the stress by also sharing

their most stressfull moments in the academia. So I feel as we traverse alongside these

moments.

My also deep thanks to the professors who broaden my skills through their lectures: Pro-

fessor Olga Sato, Professor Belmiro Castro, and Professor Paulo Polito. Their hard working

lectures and pursuit for a better quality education is something that I will ever hold true.

I would also like to thank my newly made friends from São Paulo: Renato Guimarães,

Mateus Cortezi, Matheus Chuqui, Giulia Campos, and Pedro Marone were part of my mem-

ories while experiencing this new universe called São Paulo. To them I hold my most heartfelt

thank you.

Lastly, I would like to thank the following projects and companies. The Coordenação de

Aperfeiçoamento Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) for funding my research in one of the

state-of-the-art latin american universities and also the project Rede de Estudos da Corrente

do Brasil na Margem Continental Sudeste-Sul (REMARSUL), that provided our laboratory

the necessary infracstructure for this work to be possible.

Thank you all and have a good night.

Abstract

Oceanic Gyres are the most conspicuous features in the Earth’s ocean. They are ubiqui-

tous to each basin and hemisphere. In the Atlantic Ocean, there is an uncanny symmetry

between the North and South Atlantic Subtropical Gyres. Focusing on their poleward limits,

we can think of them as virtually perfect analogues. However, while the North Atlantic Cur-

rent has been extensively studied, the South Atlantic Current (SAC) still has been very little

investigated and its knowledge presents crucial gaps on understanding it ocean’s mesoscale

variability and climate. Very little studies attempted so far to describe the SAC characteristics

in terms of water mass properties and volume transports. In addition, there is the presence

of recently described Saint Helen Current (StHC), which can be considered as the South

Atlantic analogue of the Azores Current. The StHC has its formation tied with the Brazil

Current (BC) retroflection. The SAC, on the other hand, is originated at the Brazil-Malvinas

Confluence (BMC), and flows crossing zonally the Atlantic Basin. However, the presence

of the northern branch of Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACCn) (without an analogue in the

northern hemisphere) brought a few additional challenges to studying the SAC. The ACCn

can be thought as the Malvinas Current (MC) Extension, which exits the BMC region via

the southern flank of the Zapíola Rise. In this work, we revisit the descriptive oceanogra-

phy of the SAC system with newly developed climatologies (WOA13 and ARMOR3D) and

seek to unravel the pattern associated with the current in the Southern limb of the region.

Recent literature mentions that there is an important interplay between this three zonal jets

as the cross the South Atlantic. However, only kinematics arguments were used to pinpoint

this interplay so far. Hence, we opted to employ a statistical correlation method involving

temperature, salinity and density vertical profiles (and consequently, T-S curves as well).

We also computed volume transport values for the whole zonal domain across the South



xv

Atlantic Subtropical Gyre southern limb. In particular, at the longitude that it reaches the

Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the major portion of the SAC veers south and merge almost completely

with the ACCn. Its smaller northern the StHC. Near the eastern ocean border of the South

Atlantic Ocean, the SAC-ACCn as well as a portion of the StHC traverse into the Indian

Ocean. The combined analysis of geostrophic streamfunction fields and the temperature-

density correlation diagrams do not show sufficient evidence for the StHC being an inde-

pendent current, and not a branch of the SAC. Since there is also no study regarding the

dynamics of the SAC we also constructed a linear QG instability model aiming to evaluate

the current system mesoscale activity. We then analyzed the mesoscale activity of the SAC,

and discovered that SAC is unstable throughout the whole path domain towards Africa. This

instabilities, however, are found to be not as vigorous as the ACC. We also identify a shift

in mesoscale vorticity wave regime as the SAC crosses the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. We found

it to be less unstable than at the western side. We, however, could not identify the type of

instabilities associated with the current. Therefore, we propose as sequential future work to

further pursue investigation on the mesoscale dynamics of the ACCn-SAC-StHC system.

Resumo

Os Giros Oceânicos são os aspectos mais notáveis dos oceano. Eles são ubíquos em to-

dos os hemisférios e bacias oceânicas. No Atlântico, por exemplo, existe uma clara simetria

entre os giros subtropicais do Atlântico norte e sul. Nos seus limites mais polar, pode-

mos pensar neles como análogos perfeitos. Entretanto, enquanto a Corrente do Atlântico

Norte foi extensamente estudado, a Corrente do Atlântico Sul ainda tem sido muito pouco

investigada deixando lacunas cruciais no conhecimento no entendimento do clima e vari-

abilidade de mesoscala nos oceanos. Pouquíssimos estudos foram realizados até agora a

fim de descrever a CAS e suas características nos tópicos relacionados às propriedades

das massas de água transporte de voluma. Ademais, há a presença de um corrente re-

centemente descrita, cunhada de Corrente de Santa Helena (CStH) que pode considerada,

tal qual a Corrente do Atlântico Sul, uma análoga da Corrente dos Açores. A CStH possui

sua formação atrelada à Corrente do Brasil (CB). A CAS, por sua vez, origina-se na con-

fluência Brasil-Malvinas e escoa atravessando zonalmente a bacia do Atlântico. Entretanto,

a presença do ramo norte da Corrente Circumpolar Antártica (CCAn) (sem um análogo no

hemisfério norte) trouxe desafios adicionais ao estudo da CAS. A CCAn pode ser pensada

como uma extensão da Corrente das Malvinas (CM), a qual sai da região da confluência

via o flanco sul da Elevação de Zapiola. Nesse trabalho, revisitamo a oceanografia des-

critiva do sistema CAS com novas climatologias desenvolvidas (WOA13 e ARMOR3D) e

procuramos desvendar o padrão associado à corrente no membro sul da região. Estudos

recentes apontam uma importante interação entre os três jatos zonais enquanto atravessam

o Atlântico Sul. Somente argumentos cinemáticos, entretanto, foram utilizados para identi-

ficar essa interação. Consequentemente, optamos em empregar um método de correlação



xvii

estatística envolvendo perfis verticais de temperatura, salinidade e densidade(e, logo, cur-

vas T-S). Nós também calculamos o transporte de volume para todo o domínio zonal através

do ramo sul do Giro Subtropical do Atlântico Norte. Em particular, na longitude que alcança

a Cadeia Meso-Atlântica, a maior porção da CAS desvia-se para o sul e dilui-se quanse que

por completo à CCAn. Próxima à borda este do Oceano Atlântico Sul, tanto a CAS-CCAn

como uma parte da CStH atravessam em direção ao Oceano Índico. A análise combi-

nada dos campos de função de corrente geostróficos e pelos diagramas de correlação de

temperatura-densidade não mostra evidências suficientes para que a CStH seja consider-

ada uma corrente independente e não um ramo da CAS. Além disso, já que não há estudos

relacionados a dinâmica da CAS, nós tambémconstruímos um modelo de instabilidade QG

a fim de avaliar a atividade de mesoscala do sistema de correntes. Analisamos essa ativi-

dade da CAS e descobrimos que ela é instável durante todo o seu percurso em direção

Introduction

1.1 Subtropical Gyres in the Atlantic Ocean

Certainly, the most conspicuous basin-wide features of the world ocean are the gyres.

These large-scale eddies are ubiquitous to each basin and hemisphere and can be tropical,

equatorial, subtropical or subpolar. Their vertical extension is about 1000 m, which coincides

with the the base of the permanent pycnocline.

The gyre dynamics was unraveled by a series of seminal articles from the late 40’s and

early 50’s of the XIX Century (Sverdrup, 1947; Stommel, 1948; Munk, 1950). The gyres are

primarily forced by large-scale winds, or more specifically, by the wind stress curl. The zero

curl bands, which extends zonally throughout the ocean basins, delimit the gyre meridional

extension. Most of the gyre domain is forced directly by the wind, while the northern and

southern borders consist of free geostrophic currents (Sverdrup, 1947). The exception is

the gyre western boundary, which present narrow, stronger currents explained by continuity

and by the east-west angular velocity of the near-spherical Planet Earth (Stommel, 1948).

The so-called Sverdrup theory allow us to compute the locked, meridionally-organized

gyre cells merely from meteorological data centers, which excludes the western boundary

currents. Of course, no other forcing than winds is considered in this calculation. Figure 1.1

exihibits the pattern observed in the Atlantic Ocean, focusing in the northern hemisphere. It

is clear that the largest cell is the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre.

However, the thermohaline component of the ocean circulation introduces a richer and

stratified vertical structure to the ocean gyres and, therefore, allows the gyre cells to ex-

change mass with the neighboring ones. Therefore, we can restate the affirmation in the

drup transport computed from the COADS surface meteorological fields. From

Mayer and Weisberg (1993).

first paragraph in more complete form: the ocean gyres are primarily mechanically forced by

winds and modified by the meridional overturning circulation (MOC).

The observed structure of the subtropical gyres of the Atlantic Ocean is sketched in Fig-

ure 1.2. The North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre is formed by North Equatorial Current (NEC)

in the south, the Gulf Stream in the western boundary, the North Atlantic Current (NAC) and

the Azores Current (AzC) in the north and, the Portugal Current (PtC) and the Canary Cur-

rent (CaC) closing the gyre in the eastern boundary. In the South Atlantic, the anticyclonic

subtropical gyre is traditionally considered as composed by the South Atlantic Current (SAC)

in the south, the Benguela Current (BeC) in the east, the South Equatorial Current (SEC) in

the north and, the Brazil Current (BC) bordering the western boundary.

Chapter 1. Introduction 4

Focusing on the poleward limit of the subtropical gyres in the Atlantic, we might think

the NAC and SAC as perfect analogues for the North and South Atlantic Subtropical Gyres

(NASG and SASG), respectively. But, is this assessment correct? The NAC has already

been extensively studied in both its characteristics and dynamics (Mann, 1967; Richardson,

1983; Krauss, 1986; Bower and von Appen, 2008). The recent review presented by Talley

(2011) indicates that only a minor part of the NAC veers south to feed the CaC directly.

About a third of its transport forms the PtC, which adds (does not add) volume to the CaC

during the boreal spring-summer (autumn-winter). The other two thirds flows to the Nordic

Seas. It is the AzC which primarily feeds the NEC.

The dynamics of the NAC is characterized by strong topographic control, which leads to

finite amplitude meandering and a trifurcation of the NAC jet downstream. Mesoscale sta-

tionary eddies (Figure 1.3) are related to the Newfoundland Rise, Newfoundland Seamounts

and the Flemming Cap (Krauss, 1986; Rossby, 1996). The southnermost eddy is a perma-

nent anticyclonic feature discovered by Mann (1967), known as the Mann Eddy, while the

others seem to be recurrent and persistent only for months at a time.

On the other hand, few articles have attempted so far to describe the SAC character-

istics in terms of water mass properties and volume transports. Juliano and Alves (2007)

challenged the traditional SASG pattern presented in Figure 1.2. These authors suggested

there is also an analogue to the AzC in the South Atlantic and named it the Saint Helena

Current (StHC). For the dynamical investigation of the SAC, the literature was also found to

be scarce. In the next section, we present a review on the descriptive oceanography of the

SAC and discuss the contradictions among the works.

1.2 The SAC Description

The original description of the SAC was made by Stramma and Peterson (1990) based

on in situ hydrographic data from a collection of historical surveys. They described the cur-

rent as being closely associated with the Subtropical Front (STF), a meridional temperature

discontinuity which separates the SASG from the Antarctic Circunpolar Current (ACC) (Fig.

1.4).

At the formation longitude (45° W), they evaluated a maximum velocity of ? 0.1 ms?1

and a transport 14.1 Sv (1 Sv=106m3s?1, Fig. 1.5). The authors justified the weakness of

the SAC as being caused by the presence of a strong salinity gradient acting in opposition

to the distribution of temperature, and therefore, attenuating the thermal wind as well as rich

mesoscale activity.

The former authors obtained the largest transport value of the SAC at 30° W: 29-37

Sv. They also identified at the same longitude a inflection of the STF southward which



Chapter 1. Introduction 6

FIGURE 1.4: Illustration of the oceanic fronts in the Subtropical South Atlantic:

lar Front; BCF, the Brazil Current Front. Adapted from Stramma and Peterson

(1990).

was not followed by the SAC. Stramma and Peterson (1990) argued that shallow southward

extension of subtropical water overrode subantarctic surface water, but most of the baroclinic

structure of the STF remained north. They also identified what seemed to be a weaker

branch around 200 km further north of the main current.

At the eastern side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAC) (0°), the current is narrower and the

most of the transport is found south of STF reaching values of 8 Sv, while the surface front

has around 9 Sv. Therefore, the total transport was calculated as being 17 Sv. Stramma and

Peterson (1990) then concluded that part of the transport of the SAC turns north to feed the

BeC.

Later, Gordon et al. (1992) studied the eastern side of Atlantic Ocean also through hydro-

graphic data willing to understand the communication between the waters from this ocean

basin to the Indian Ocean. They identified the Brazil-Benguela Subtropical Front (BSAF),

around 5° W. They stated that the band between this front and the Subantarctic Front (SAF)

marked the SAC presence.

According the aforementioned authors, the SAC transports 12 Sv of thermocline water,

and about 6 Sv of this transport turns to the BeC, whilst the rest continues to flow eastward,

passing into the Indian Ocean. SAC carries the same transport for the lower thermocline,

Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW). It is likely, however, that most of the AAIW originated

in the Pacific Ocean with some contribution of the BC. Approximately 4 Sv of this transport

turns to BeC, whilst the rest (8 Sv) flows into the Indian Ocean. The authors also argue that

the transport patterns of the SAC and its role in the interocean exchange has an impact at

the global thermocline circulation.

In contrast, the study by Schmid et al. (2000) identified a transport ranging from 6 Sv

to 26 Sv of AAIW in the SAC (Fig. 1.6). The highest value (26 Sv) was found adjacent to

the western boundary. They also reported a significantly decrease of 19 Sv between 52°

W-41° W. The SAC transport is reduced at lower rates while the current flows eastward. The

authors found values ranging from 19 Sv (38° W) to 16 Sv (30° W) and 6 Sv (1° E). This

faster transport drop, as the authors suggested, may be caused by mesoscale variability

in the region, while the slower drop rates between 38° W and 30° W could be result of the

exchange of waters between SASG and the ACC. They supported this hypothesis by the fact

the trajectories of the floaters suggest an interaction between ACC and SAC. This interaction

seems more evident near 20° W where both currents seem to merge as one.

The more recent study conducted by Juliano and Alves (2007) employed the ?-spiral

port and circulation in Sv. The shaded region represents the 3000m isobath.

method in its linear and nonlinear versions using a T-S climatology built from hydrographic

data gathered from three different data distributions centers (NODC, GTSPP and WOCE’s).

With the absolute geostrophic velocity maps, they claimed to have discovered a new current,

the StHC. The authors chose the South Atlantic island name in analogy with the AzC in the

NASG (see Figure 1.7).

The authors interpreted as the StHC is formed due to the northern retroflection of the

Brazil-Malvinas Confluence (BMC) and as flowing eastward paralleling the SAC at 35° W,

33 ° S (Figure 1.8). At about 20° W, they also identified the interaction between the southern

edge of the SAC with norther part of the ACC. This meridional, very broad jet in Figure 1.9

makes the distinction between the ACC and the SAC rather difficult if only velocity patterns

are examined. As a matter of fact, both Stramma and Peterson (1990) and Schmid et al.

(2000) argued that it is actually the displacement of the STF that caused an interaction

between these latter two currents.

At 5° W, however,Juliano and Alves (2007) detected a slight northward displacement of

the SAC core and gets closer to the StHC (Figure 1.8). This current pattern is in agreement

with Stramma and Peterson (1990)’s findings. From the Greenwhich Meridian to 10° E

(Figure 1.10), the intensified StHC moves slightly in southeast direction, and past 10° E,

it deflects northwestward merging with the BeC. As previously said, the StHC is the main

feeder of BeC with other relevant source being volume flux leaking from the Agulhas Current

Retroflection (AgCR). Richardson (2007) studied the influence of the Agulhas Rings into the

Atlantic Ocean, and he found that the water transported from Indian Ocean by Agulhas Rings

into the South Atlantic might cause a split in the SAC around 5°E.

Rodrigues et al. (2010) employed the Gravest Empiral Mode (GEM) technique on a

quasi-isobaric subsurface float data set to obtain total (i.e., barotropic+baroclinic) mass

transports in SASG poleward limb. They estimated a total SAC transport of 50 Sv at 30° W.

Some 10.3 Sv of those 50 Sv come from BC, while the rest from MC. In that region Stramma

and Peterson (1990) calculated a transport between 30-37 Sv. Across the 0° meridian, the

SAC also carried the same 50 Sv of transport. Since no change was found between 30° W

and 0°meridian, they concluded, therefore, that there was no evidence for recirculation.

In agreement with Richardson (2007), Rodrigues et al. (2010) also found the split at

around 7° W (Fig. 1.11). They suggested that the reason why earlier studies were not able

to identify this splitting was because of their consideration of baroclinic flow only, which,

from their results, was not visible in their baroclinic component, and therefore these studies

regarded an eastward weakening of the current. Neither Richardson (2007) nor Rodrigues

et al. (2010) cited or referenced the work of Juliano and Alves (2007), since the three articles

entered the review process in their journals at a very close date.

Rodrigues et al. (2010) also found, from their results, that of the 39.7 Sv of the SAC

coming from the MC only 8.7 Sv contribute to the northern branch of the current. The

southern branch either rejoins ACC or flows into the AgCR. Some 4 Sv of these 8.7 Sv

interact also with the AgCR, while the remaining flow, along with the 10.3 Sv of the BC water

and 8.5 Sv of the AgC to feed the BeC (Fig. 1.11).

1.3 Scientific Questions and Hypotheses

A few ambiguities arise from the literature review presented in the previous section re-

garding the SAC. One of those is the actual presence of the StHC as an independent current

and not as a branch of the SAC. Another deals with the assertments of most of the reviewed

works regarding the water masses transported by the zonal jets without presenting the T-S

characteristics of the StHC-SAC-ACC system. Therefore, we formulate the following scien-

tific questions to address those unresolved issues:

1. Is the StHC indeed an independent current fed by the first retroflection of the BC as

claimed by Juliano and Alves (2007) or part of the SAC split into two branches around

7 ° W, as reported by Rodrigues et al. (2010)?

2. Does the water mass composition allow the differentiation between the SAC and the

ACC as well as the indentification of they longitude they merge to exit the Atlantic

Ocean basin?

3. What is the role of the StHC in SASG?

4. Is the SAC current unstable throughout its flow path and does the MAC acts a stabilizer

to the SASG southern limb current system?

In order to attempt to answer these questions, we formulate two hypotheses which will

be guide the current work. The first hypothesis deals with the descriptive aspects of the



Chapter 1. Introduction 13

StHC-SAC-ACC system, while the latter aims to target the yet unexplored dynamics of the

current system.

Hypothesis # 1

The SAC-StHC with the same T-S signature travel zonally along SASG southern limb and

close the subtropical gyre.

Hypothesis # 2

The SAC system undergoes through important zonal changes in their jet configurations as

they cross the South Atlantic basin, which in turn yields different patterns of mesoscale

activity.

1.4 Objectives

1.4.1 General Objective

The main objective of the current work is to revisit the description of the StHC-SAC-ACC

system with newly available data sets as well investigate the instability processes which give

rise to the mesoscale variability in the SASG southern border.

1.4.2 Specific Objectives

• To identify the geostrophic current patterns between 30° S and 60° S using the new T-S

climatologies available;

• To spatial variations of the climatology of the StHC, SAC and ACC through their water

masses structure correlation;

• To construct a climatological volume transport charts using the new climatologies and

compare with historical information;

• To identify the SAC-StHC current intensity and direction variability through daily data;

• To evaluate the SAC stability through a quasi-geostrophic, meridionally-oriented sectional,

linear model.

Study area and Data Sets

2.1 The Study Area

The study area is comprised between 65° S-30° S of latitude, and 70° W-23° E of lon-

gitude (Figure 2.1). Away from the western and eastern continental margins, two main

topographic emerge from the abyssal plain: the Zapiola Rise and the MAC. The former is

a quasi-circular, 250km-radius topographic feature, which height exceeds 1300 m with a

sediment cover of thicker than 3000 mm (Weijer et al., 2015). The Zapiola Rise occupies

the southwestern corner of the Argentine Basin and plays a crucial role in separating most

of the MC from the BC extension flows (Talley, 2011). The more barotropic flow of the MC

extension is diverted to the south contouring the rise and, as seen in Chapter 1, originates

the so-called northern branch of the ACC centered at about 50° S (Talley, 2011; Tomczak

and Godfrey, 2013). The Zapiola Rise itself is characterized by a permanent barotropic

anticyclonic circulation, which dynamics was unraveled by the Dewar (1998); Miranda et al.

(1999). The MAC within the study area presents a northwest-southeast orientation and rises

more than 2000 m from the ocean floor.



Chapter 2. Study area and Data Sets 15

FIGURE 2.1: Region of Study with etopo data plotted on background.

2.2 Data Sets

In this investigation we employ different hydrographic climatologies as well as altimetric

data to build the large scale patterns of ocean circulationin the southern border of South

Atlantic Subtropical Gyre. Particularly for World Ocean Atlas (WOA) v2 2013 distributed

by United States Oceanographic Data Center (NODC), Archiving, Validation and Interpre-

tation of Satellite Oceanographic Data (AVISO) distributed by the French Center of Spatial

Study (CNES), and ARMOR3D distributed by the French Operational Oceanography Mer-

cator Project.

2.2.1 WOA v2 2013

WOA is a set of objectively analysed 1/4° grid (climatological fields of in-situ temperature

and salinity, among other properties) with 101 vertical levels. According to Boyer et al.

(2013), the TS data have multiple source of measurements: CTDs, Nansen Bottle data,



Chapter 2. Study area and Data Sets 16

MBTs, XBTs, predecessor of profilling floats, ARGO floats, moored buoy data, and drifting

buoy data.

2.2.2 AVISO

The so-called AVISO products produced by CLS Space Oceanography Division are

derived from the SSALTO/Duacs processing integrating data from: HY-2A, Saral/AltiKa,

Cryosat-2, OSTM/Jason-2, Jason-1, Topex/Poseidon, Envisat, GFO, ERS-1&amp;amp;2. This data

set extends from 1993 to 2016. It is provided daily maps of absolute dynamic topographic

(ADT) data at a 1/4 ° grid.

The ADT maps result on the sum of the daily sea level anomaly (SLA) maps and the

mean dynamic topography (MDT). The last MDT released is the CNES-CLS13 combined

gravimetric satellite data (2 years of GOCE, 7 years of GRACE), and 20 years of altimetry

and in-situ data (hydrologic and drifters data).

2.2.3 ARMOR3D

The ARMOR3D data utilizes accurate but sparse in-situ T-S data merged with high res-

olution altimeter and SST data to reconstruct global, instantaneous, 3D thermohaline and

geostrophic velocity fields (Larnicol et al., 2006; Mulet et al., 2012; Guinehut et al., 2012).

According to Larnicol et al. (2006), the ARMOR3D geostrophic velocity fields are constructed

through 3 steps:

1. The SLA and SST satellite observations are projected onto the vertical via a multiple

linear regression method and using covariances deduced from historical observations.

This leads to synthetic fields;

2. The synthetic fields and all available in-situ T/S profiles are combined through an opti-

mal interpolation method. This leads to the ARMOR3D T/S combined fields;

3. The thermal wind equation with a reference level at the surface is used to combine

geostrophic current fields from satellite altimetry with ARMOR3D T/S fields and thus



Chapter 2. Study area and Data Sets 17

to generate the global 3D geostrophic current and geopotential height fields.

The TS and geostrophic velocity data sets are provided weekly since 1993. The vertical

resolution consists of 33 levels, while the horizontal resolution is a 1/4°.

Basic Methodology

The methods to be presented in this chapter are separated in two sections. In the first

section, we present the methods and techniques used to describe the StHC-SAC-ACC sys-

tem (or hereafter SAC system) regarding its T-S characteristics, its sectional vertical distri-

butions and volume transport across the Atlantic Ocean. In the second section, we show the

tools employed to study the current system dynamics, especially in regards to its mesoscale

activity, and energy fluxes.

3.1 Methods of Hydrographic Data Analysis

3.1.1 Dynamic Method

Base on the classical dynamic method we can infer the geostrophic velocity as:

u(p) = ur ?
1

f0

? pr
p

??

?y
dp?, (3.1)

where ur is the reference velocity from a known isobaric level, f0 is the Coriolis param-

eter, p (pr) is the (reference) pressure level, ? is the specific volume anomaly, and y is the

meridional distance coordinate. The reference pressure is usually chosen as the level where

there is a null velocity.

WOA was used to make this estimate from its geopotential anomaly calculated from

the climatological data offered. A fixed level of no motion was chosen to be approximately

3000 dbar (hence, ur is set 0), which is in agreement with Stramma and Peterson (1990)’s

original description of the SAC. The surface geostrophic currents (relative to 3000 dbar)



Chapter 3. Basic Methodology 19

are then compared to surface currents estimated from the AVISO (Archiving, Validation and

Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic Data) altimetry-derived sea surface height.

The transport values for SAC system in the region were calculated by the height gradients

and compared with the literature, using the following equation:

T =

??
R

u dydz,

R = {(y,z) ? R2 : Y0 ? y ? Y1; H0 ? z ? 0}

(3.2)

where u (ms?1) is the zonal velocity; R is the region being integrated; Y0/Y1 is the south/north

most limit of the current; H0 is the reference depth chosen for integrating.

3.1.2 Relative geostrophic velocities from ARMOR3D

For the ARMOR3D, the geostrophic velocity components were also referenced at the

3000 dbar as a way to remove the statistical artifacts produce by its vertical extrapolation.

This data set, first published in 2012, combines sparse in situ temperature and salinity profile

data with satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature data to provide a high spatial and

temporal resolution of 3-D temperature, salinity and absolute geostrophic velocity fields. The

ARMOR3D velocity fields are referenced at the surface by the AVISO dataset. We, however,

observed that probably due to less available TS data to compute the climatology the impo-

sition of the AVISO geostrophic velocities yields to very unrealistic barotropic component in

all zonal jets under investigation in this work. Therefore, in order to avoid this issue and to

allow direct comparison with the WOA geostrophic velocity relative to 3000 dbar, we opt to

compute the ARMOR3D geostrophic field relative to this isobaric level.

3.1.3 T-S-?0 correlation analysis

From the potential temperature (T), salinity (S), and density1 vertical profiles we per-

formed the Pearson Correlation Coefficient at the origin site of SAC (40° S, 40 ° W.)
1We treat as density in fact the deviation of the potential density referenced at the surface as ?0 from the

reference value of 1000 kg m?3. Mathematically we express it as ?0 = ?T (T,S, 0) ? 1000.

where xi, yi are the sample value at specific depth, and x? and y? are the sample mean.

3.1.4 Geostrophic velocities from AVISO

From the downloadable Absolute Dynamic Topography (?) fields from the whole time

series, we computed the average and inferred the geostrophic velocities as being

Since the definition of the streamfunction is: u = ???/?y and v = ??/?x, we can infer it as

3.1.5 Basic Statistics

As auxiliary analysis methods to perform the intercomparison between the data sets, we

employ first and second statistical momenta and tests of normality, such as the t-student

test. Correlation coeficients and normalized roo mean square errors (rms) are used as

figures of statistical merit to compare two fields of the same oceanographic quantity Pinardi

and Robinson (1987). The normalized rms is given by:

RMS =

&amp;lt;(g1 ?g2)2 &gt;

&amp;lt;g22 &gt;
(3.6)

3.2 Linear Instability Analysis

3.2.1 Sectional Mixed Instability Model

In order to evaluate the linear instability properties of the StHC-SAC-ACC system, we fol-

low Kontoyiannis (1997) and construct a quasi-geostrophic (QG) model of a flat-bottomed,



Chapter 3. Basic Methodology 21

stratified ocean on a ?-plane centered at the latitude of the SAC core (see A for algebraic

details). The model solves the Chaney-Stern equation for meridional sections which encom-

pass the latitude range of interest (30° S-60° S) and applied for different longitudes. We

chose the meridians for the model application based upon the results of the jet patterns ob-

tained in the analyses described in the previous section. The longitudes 40°W, 20°W, 10°W,

and 10°E revelead to be the appropriate choices.

The QG potential vorticity equation given in terms of the geostrophic pressure is

(?t + U?x)

{

+ p?xQy = 0 , (3.7)

where U is the basic state zonal velocity, p? is the pressure deviation relative to its basic state

P, N is the Brünt-Väisälä (or stratification) frequency, and Qy is the meridional gradient of

the basic potential vorticity Q defined by

Qy = ? ?Uyy + ?z

(3.8)

The Eq. 3.7 is solved considering rigid lids at the surface and bottom, as well as imposing

an idealized zonal channel to restrain the unstable waves to noninfinite wavelengths. Hence,

the boundary conditions are ???

w = 0 z = 0, H

v = 0 y = 0, W.

(3.9)

where y = 0,W represent the meridional limits of the channel.

We reach the traditional Charney-Stern instability equation for mixed instabilities by as-

suming a solution to Equation 3.7 in the form of

p?(x,y,z,t) = Re[?n(y,z)e
ik(x?cnt)] , (3.10)

where Phi is the nth complex meridional-vertical structure eigenfuction associated with the

nth complex eigenvalue cn, which denotes the complex phase speed of the pressure pertu-

bations.

The eigenvalue problem 3.11 written in its canonical form is simply

(A? Ic?)?? = 0. (3.13)

The method chosen for solving Equation 3.13 is finite difference method. The reader

is refered to Appendix B for the detailed discretization of Equation 3.11. The model pro-

vides us the real phase speed, the growth rate, as wells the pressure perturbation spatial

configuration of the unstable modes.

We limit our calculations to a maximum wavenumber value of 0.1 km?1 which corre-

sponds to five times of the inverse of the average radius of deformation of the area, which is

in agreement with the QG theory (Tulloch et al., 2011).

3.2.2 Local Baroclinic Instability Model

Solving the local instability poblem for the whole region provides an interesting view of

the differences of linear instability properties. This kind of study was conducted by Tulloch

et al. (2011), as well as Gill et al. (1974), Johns (1988), Rocha et al. (2014).

The local instability focus on the potential vorticity reduced by the stretching and ?y

terms. Therefore, only vertical shear instability is solved. The local instability model equa-

tions can be writtern by neglecting the relative vorticity gradient in Equation 3.8, which in

turn becomes:

Q(L)y = ? ?

Chapter 3. Basic Methodology 23

While the governing conservation equation is still Equation 3.7, its boundary conditions is

reduced to:

w = 0 z = 0,H. (3.15)

The solution proposed, therefore, is similar to Equation 3.10, but with the eigenfunction

depending only on the z axis. The Charney-Stern equation written for the local model, then

becomes:

As presented in the seccional model, we consider here only the zonal velocity. Other

authors (such as Smith (2007) and Tulloch et al. (2011)) have included both velocity compo-

nents. We then acknowledge that our results will likely represent an underestimation of the

real growth rates. We again should state we opted for that in order to allow direct comparison

with the seccional model.

3.3 Analysis of Energetics

To analyse the dynamical field of the SAC System we calculated for the AVISO data set

(which is the only data that provides daily outputs) the Mean Kinectic Energy (MKE)

MKE =
1

2
&amp;lt;u2 + v2 &gt; . (3.17)

Its eddy fields were also computed as the Mean Eddy Kinectic Energy (MEKE)

MEKE =
1

2
(&amp;lt;u?2 &gt; + &amp;lt;v?2 &gt;). (3.18)

For both of these physical quantities, we also computed the monthly climatological field for

each six sections of interest (40° W, 30° W, 20° W, 10° W, 0°, 10° E). MKE and MEKE are

expressed in this text in terms of energy per unit of mass (m2s?2). The maps of MEKE

presented were low-pass filtered to remove any variability longer than 120 days in order to

assure that we will examine only mesoscale variation.



Chapter 3. Basic Methodology 24

Finally, we present the standard deviation of the Okubo-Weiss field, which is defined as

W = S2n + S
2
s ??

2, (3.19)

where Sn = ?u/?x??v/?y and Ss = ?v/?x + ?u/?y are the normal and shear components

of strain, and ? = ?v/?x ? ?u/?y is the relative vorticity. Although we miss the leading

dominant term of the equation by taking its standard deviation, we are interested in seeing

the main field variability of vortices.

4.1 Intercomparison between WOA, ARMOR3D and AVISO data

sets

In order to analyse and employ the three datasets interchangeably, we opt to intercom-

pare the three datasets focusing solely on the surface fields. Of course, the intercomparison

of T-S-?0 fields will consist only of analysis of the WOA and the ARMOR3D sets. The surface

velocity ones will encompass the three datasets used in this work.

4.1.1 The surface hydrographic fields

The comparison between the datasets began with WOA and ARMOR3D temperature,

salinity, and density profile (Figure 4.1). From both datasets, it is visible the presence of a

dense, cold-fresh water tongue coming from the MC and conflicting with the less dense and

warmer-saltier water from BC (Figure 4.1 A1; A2; B1; B2). Both datasets also show the

fresh water bulb coming from La Plata River at the South America continental margin.

The largest differences between the datasets, however, arise near the BMC. At the north-

ern/southern branch (39 ° S/ 49° S), ARMOR3D/WOA results in a denser water (Figure

4.2.C). Even though ARMOR3D results in warmer water in both branches (Figure 4.2.A),

WOA results in a slightly more saline water at the southern branch (Figure 4.2.B). The den-

sity, however, does not change excessively between data sets. The average deviation of

ARMOR3D and WOA are 4.521×10?2± 0.181 kg m?3 and 4.994×10?2± 0.1474 kg m?3,

respectively.

Chapter 4. The SAC System Description 27

Although ARMOR3D estimate an approximately 2° C warmer temperature at the South

American shelf (which is the region of the largest temperature difference of the datasets),

most of the temperature of the region is slightly overstimated by WOA at a maximum of 1° C.

Although the average temperature difference is not discrepant, each data set exceeds the

temperature in an average of 0.201 ± 0.211° C and 0.209 ± 0.163° C for ARMOR3D and

WOA, respectively.

FIGURE 4.2: WOA-ARMOR3D difference fields of temperature (A), salinity (B)
and density (C).



Chapter 4. The SAC System Description 28

For the salinity differences, WOA shows at 42° S as small bulb extending eastward

through the midoceanic ridge. However, the largest discrepancy in this property happens

close to the La Plata River where there are higher salinity levels in the ARMOR3D by a

maximum of 10.480 psu and at some parts in the WOA data with a maximum of 4.155

psu. Despite these differences, the average difference of 5.213×10?2± 0.252 psu and

5.603×10?2± 0.179 psu for ARMOR3D and WOA, respectively, can be considered small for

the study region.

The overall spatial average and standard deviation, which can be seen in Table 4.1, imply

that both datasets agree and the largest differences found are localized in regions away from

the study region. This can be futher confirmed by the spatial average and standard deviation

of the fields themselves (Table 4.1 and Figure 4.3.A) which shows that for the temperature,

salinity, and density the difference are in the range of 0.5%, 0.05%, and 0.05%, respectively.

The field histograms of the data sets (Figure 4.3.B) also seem to mostly agree between

themselves.

the data sets (Figure 4.2) and the spatial fields of WOA and ARMOR3D.

?0 (kg m?3) 2.513×10?3± 0.172 26.410 ± 0.750 26.397 ± 0.791

From a zonal gradient perspective of density (Figure 4.4.A3 and Figure 4.4.B3), it can be

seen a similar pattern of steep gradients between both data sets. Two steep gradients are

found at the BMC, which are likely to be the STF and SAF; at the BeC and the La Plata river

there is algo a significant gradient result, and, finally, a wide zonal band gradient extending

from northwest region to the BeC. This feature might likely be associated with StHC. But

again, a few differences may be denoted between the data sets.

At the BMC, WOA seems to result a stronger surface density gradient in what seems to

be the northern and southern branch of the confluence, despite the southern branch being

leaner than ARMOR3D. It is also apparent at the mid oceanic ridge, around 10° W, 45° S, a

more pronounced gradient from WOA.



Chapter 4. The SAC System Description 29

FIGURE 4.3: Spatial average and standard deviation (upper panels) and his-
togram (lower pannels) of temperature (left panels), salinity (middle panels),

and density (right panels) for WOA and ARMOR3D.

Analysing the temperature gradient (Figure 4.4.A1 and Figure 4.4.B1), we observer that

the stronger density gradient at the southern branch of the BMC and at the mid-oceanic

ridge are probably justified by the temperature gradient of WOA being much steeper than the

ARMOR3D results. However, from the salinity gradient (Figure 4.4.A2 and Figure 4.4.B2),

ARMOR3D in general seems to show higher values than WOA, specially at the northern

branch of BMC extending zonally through the SA ocean.

From the literature, the range of isotherms used to define the STF and SAF structures is

approximately 11.5° C-18.5° C and 4° C-8° C, respectively. As these fronts present robust

seasonal temperature variations, for instance the winter and the summer values are 11.5°

C- 15.5° C and 14.5°- 18.5° C, respectively Stramma and Peterson (1990); Stramma (1992);

Belkin and Gordon (1996). To produce an annual climatology map for the fronts only by

using isotherms patterns can be misleading, therefore, we add the temperature gradient

maps to detect the bands at which those fronts occur on a mean climatological sense.

4.1.2 Surface Geostrophic Velocities and Streamfunction

From the geostrophic velocity (Figure 4.5), at the BMC, it can be seen two main jets

flowing eastward at the north and southern branch, which would probably be the SAC and

the northern branch of the ACC, respectively. At the surface level, between the BMC and

the mid-oceanic ridge, both jets flow together making it visually indistinguishable. At this

tectonic feature (10° W) the currents change trajectory getting stapered and consequently

stronger. Past it, they diverge and flows toward the Indian Ocean.

From the SAC flow pattern, at 30° W, it is visible a detachment flowing separately from

the current. This separation is likely resulting in the StHC streaming zonally along with SAC.

However, while ARMOR3D and AVISO results in quite similar information, a few discrepan-

cies from the data are present.

WOA, in general, shows a more coherent flow than the other data sets. At the BMC,

the WOA results in a wider southern branch reaching speeds up to 0.31 m s?1, while at the

northern a maximum speed of 0.15 m s?1, which is in agreement of Stramma and Peterson

(1990). However, ARMOR3D and AVISO shows a maximum speed of 0.6 and 0.7 m s?1 for

the northern branch, and 0.21 and 0.22 m s?1 for the southern branch, respectively. At the

mid oceanic, WOA estimate a maximum speed of 0.25 m s?1, while ARMOR3D and AVISO

0.34 and 0.37 m s?1, respectively.

A similar pattern can be seen in the speed intensity difference between data sets (Figure

4.5.B). The smallest differences are seen in the comparison of ARMOR3D-AVISO (Figure

4.5.B3) reaching a maximum difference of 0.11 m s?1, but an average of 0.01 ± 0.02 m s?1.

WOA-ARMOR3D (Figure 4.5.B1), in contrast, show a maximum 0.49 m s?1, but an average

of 0.02 ± 0.05 m s?1, while WOA-AVISO (Figure 4.5.B2) result in differences up to 0.48 m

s?1 and an average of 0.02 ± 0.06 m s?1.

Most of these differences arise at the MC, where ARMOR3D and AVISO estimate a

higher velocity than WOA, and AVISO estimates, in general, a higher velocity than AR-

MOR3D. Other significant difference happen at the BeC when comparing the datasets with

WOA.

Analysing the current function of the three data sets we removed its mean fields and

calculated the normalized RMS (Table 4.2). AVISO and ARMOR3D are show to be approxi-

mately 30% stronger than the WOA. Although the methodology acquired for each of the sets

are different, the results, however, are similar.

4.2 TS?0 Correlation Maps

Given the conflicting information in literature regarding the STF position, it is possible that

there are also discrepancies between its associated currents. To identify such currents we

opt to perform an alternative methodology aiming to separate the subtropical current from

the subantarctic and polar ones.

At 40° W we identify three main eastward flows: two originated at the BMC and a more

southern one traversing directly from the Passage of Drake. The TS profile curve at each of

the three cores are distinct (Figure 4.6) and we can see that each current carries a different

water mass, and, therefore, present different TS structures. The most evident distinction

between the composition of water masses is the presence of SACW (a long quasi-linear

decrease of TS with depth at around 26.9 kg m?3 ?4) at the SAC origin flow. In contrast, the

other currents do not show a salient temperature variation and are mostly confined at cold

temperatures. It is suggested that these profiles are within the subtropical, subantarctic and

polar vertical structure, for the north (40° S), central (49° S), and south (56° S) profiles.

Since there is a fair distinction among these sites, there is, therefore, a justification to use

the correlation method to visualize the actual position of the SAC. Figures 4.7 and 4.8 shows

the correlation for the temperature, salinity and density parameters. For the temperature, the

band that best correlates with the SAC is within 97%-100%; for the salinity, is the 90%-100%;

and for the density is between 99.5%-100%.

The parameter that best seems to reflect the SAC seems to be the temperature for both

datasets. A main zonal band is visible following zonally from the westward portion of the

SASG southern limb basin to its eastward limit. For both datasets is also seen a strong

temperature correlation within the BMC. East from the mid oceanic ridge the temperature

correlation seems stronger at the northern part of the amalgamate current with a expressive

polarward decrease of correlation, suggesting that the current amalgamate does not mix its

water mass composition.

The salinity structure correlation parameter extends from the westward limit to only 10° W

and also shows a strong correlation close to the antarctic sea divided by a narrow zonal band

of low correlation. This is likely related to the meridional variability of the salinity not being

as expressing as the temperature. Additionally, the correlation SAC correlation significantly

drecreases zonally east of the MAC.

The density correlation parameter does not show any substantial patterns for the SAC.

Just as the salinity, the density does not varies greatly meridionally within the region, and,

therefore, the minimun correlation for the region is 98.5%.

4.2.1 Current Persistence

We delimited the band of occurrence of the subtropical correlation by the SAC and StHC,

subantarctic correlation by the nothern branch of the ACC (ACCn), and polar correlation by

the southern branch of the ACC (ACCs) with the analysis conducted in the previous section.

We now focus on the two subtropical jets direction and persistence. In order to do so we

employ the whole AVISO absolute dynamic topography series and plot a windrose map at

each of the six selected longitudes. The latitudes were chosen to uniquivocally capture the

SAC and StHC jets.

At 40° W we can see that the SAC has a 36% probability of going between southeastward

and northeastward (Figure 4.9). However, it does not have a predominant direction, probably

due to the current still being highly affected by the BMC feature which also makes its speed

over 0.6 ms?1 in most of the eastward directions. In contrast, the StHC is much slower (with

a maximum speed between 0.2-0.4 ms?1) and predominantly southeastward with an almost

41% probability (Figure 4.10). This flow is likely not directly associated with the BMC feature,

but from the first BC retroflection. This has been already argued by Juliano and Alves (2007)

in their original description of the StHC.

At 30° W the SAC is now much weaker (maximum of 0.4-0.5 ms?1) and predominantly

southeastward (with 35% probability). It also has an 18% probability of going northeastward.

However, the StHC flows predominantly between the southeastward and northeastward with

a 42% probability.

Close to the Mid-Oceanic Ridge, at 20° W the SAC is slightly stronger (reaching a max-

imum between 0.2-0.4 ms?1) and with a much more dominant direction (56% mainly east-

ward). This predominant path followed by SAC might be caused due to proximity of the

mid-atlantic ridge or through the influence of ACC current. On the other hand, the StHC

has stronger temperature structure correlation (Figure 4.7 and 4.8) and it also is much more

intense (having comparable speeds to the SAC). Its flow pattern also presents a preferred

direction, with a main eastward flow (with a 47% probability) which might corroborate with

the presence of the ridge system.

At 10° W the SAC-ACC merge into a single flow. Although most of the SAC flows along

with ACC, having a southeastward predominance (around 50%) part of the SAC branches

off (around 15%) and turns northeastward and probably merge into the StHC. This latter



Chapter 4. The SAC System Description 38

W, 30° W, 20° W, 10° W, 0° , 10° E. Isolines represent the streamfunction.

current does not change remarkably east from the Mid Atlantic Ridge. Around 41% the

current has a tendency to flow eastward.

At 0° the SAC still flows along with the ACC. However, the current has now a more notable

direction variability, but it preserves its northeastward tendency of around 41%. Likewise the

StHC has also more variability, but with a preferred southeastward direction (35% proba-

bility). At this latitude the StHC branches off into two nuclei flowing eastward (Figure 4.5).

However, the precise position of the this branching varies slightly from each data set. For this

current, this branching and probably the higher current variability might be in consequence

of the proximity to the AgC influence.

At 10° E the SAC still has a northeast tendency (49% probability) feeding the southern

branch of the StHC. In contrast, this latter current is now absent of a prevailing flow direction

and much more intense than its previous locations, which corroborates our suggestion that

there is significant influence of the AgC in the StHC current.

FIGURE 4.11: AVISO Windrose geostrophic current time series for the north-
ern and southern branch of the StHC at 13° E. Isolines represent the stream-

function.

At 13 ° E we now check the windrose from each branch of the StHC (Figure 4.11). Both

of them reach a maximum over 0.6 ms?1. Climatologically, the northern branch turns north-

westward flowing along the BeC, while the southern branch flows southeastward and flows

along AgC retroflection to the Indian Ocean. Although the latter branch shows preferred

northeastward direction (33%), the northern branch has a higher variability, but still with

45% of it flowing northeastward.

4.2.2 Velocity Vertical Structure and Volume Transports

In this section we will analyse climatologically the vertical section of the speed of both

WOA and ARMOR3D data sets. We will associate this analysis with the density correlation

map computed.

East of the BMC (at 40° W) the SAC is located between 44° S - 35° S as a double nu-

clei jet (Figure 4.12). The transport of these jets are found to be around 32.1/31.6 Sv and

10.1/11.6 Sv for the southern and northern jet, respectively (as found in WOA/ARMOR3D

data). Transport estimates at this site differs little of that found by Stramma and Peterson



Chapter 4. The SAC System Description 41

FIGURE 4.12: Vertical section of WOA (left) and ARMOR3D (right) for 40° W.

(1990) at 45° W (14.1 Sv). We also observe the ACC at between 45° S - 65° S. For the

WOA data set we can estime the whole transport of the ACC as 118.2 Sv. However, the

ARMOR3D data set has the same spatial coverage as the AVISO data set, and, therefore,

there is no information south of 55° S. We can only estimate its transport as probably being

higher than 70.4 Sv. A small eastward flow is present between 35-30° S with a transport of

0.1/0.7 Sv. This flow is probably the precursor of the StHC. It is clear that there is superposi-

tion between the subtropical and subantarctic vertical profile correlation at this region. This

might be accounted for the mix between BC and MC at the BMC.

Away from the BMC (at 35° W) around 1 Sv of the northern flow of the SAC joins the

StHC. In contrast, the southern jet communicates with both its northern flow and the ACC.

At 30° W, the calculated transport for the SAC is of around 59/56.2 Sv, in contrast with

Rodrigues et al. (2010) and Stramma and Peterson (1990), all of whom derived a transport of

about 50 Sv. While for WOA we estimate the transport of the ACC as 90.3 Sv, for ARMOR3D

the transport is at least 65.95 Sv.

At 20° W (Figure 4.13), the SAC southern jet is merged with the ACC, making the latter

increase its transport up to 121.5 Sv (&gt; 92.3 Sv for ARMOR3D) and decreasing the SAC



Chapter 4. The SAC System Description 42

transport down to 19.8/13.0 Sv. Part of the SAC northern flow also merges with the StHC

making the latter current increases its volume transport to around 4.8/7.5 Sv.

FIGURE 4.13: Vertical section of WOA (left) and ARMOR3D (right) for 20° W.

East from the mid-ocean ridge, at 10° W (Figure 4.14), the ACC and most of the northern

jet of the SAC merge and flow in a single intensified flow transporting around 71.7/104.7 Sv.

The ACCs transport a maximum of 28.0 Sv (&gt;16.5 for ARMOR3D). The StHC presents an

even higher transport at this longitude (around 7.9/11.45 Sv) probably from some interaction

between the SAC northern nucleus. There is a narrow and weak remaining SAC flow with a

transport of about 0.6/0.3 Sv close to the SAC-ACC jet. The ACC now transports both water

from subantarctic and subtropical areas (around 45° S).

From the data, at 7° W, we could not detect the presence of a defined SAC split as

indicated by Richardson (2007) and Rodrigues et al. (2010) in any of our data sets. The

latter authors argue that this split only occurs when analysing the barotropic component of

the currents, which it was likely eliminated when referencing both WOA and ARMOR3D to

the 3000 dbar isobaric level. It is important to note, however, that the StHC and a small flow

of the SAC are still present within this region and their location fits with the results portrayed

by these authors.



Chapter 4. The SAC System Description 43

FIGURE 4.14: Vertical section of WOA (left) and ARMOR3D (right) for 10° W.

At the Greenwich Meridian (0° GM), the StHC branches off into two jets. The southern

jet is slightly deeper and receives an input of the SAC-ACC system and transports a volume

of 10.19/15.86 Sv. The northern branch, in contrast, is slightly weaker and transports ap-

proximately 3.4/3.3 Sv. The presence of the SAC is not aparent at this longitude, since most

of the volume this is either at the StHC or the ACC. However, the literature still considers

the presence of the SAC and derive a transport of 19 Sv Rodrigues et al. (2010) and 8 Sv

(Stramma and Peterson, 1990). From our results, we argue that the current actually anal-

ysed by both authors is the southern jet of the StHC. The combined ACC-SAC flow transport

around 51.7/42.1 Sv. While for ARMOR3D, we do not have information south from 51° S, for

WOA we can estimate the whole ACC system transport as 125.1 Sv.

At 10°E (Figure 4.15), we do not observe any remaining jet associated with the SAC,

but rather we observe a robust double-core StHC jet. The southern and northern cores of

the StHC transport a volume of around 9.6/14 Sv and 8.6/6.5 Sv, respectively. While for

the ACC-SAC system we have a transport of 69.1/70.3 Sv, the whole ACC system can be

estimated by WOA as being 98.3 Sv. From this longitude to the eastward limit of the Atlantic

Ocean, we observe a meandering pattern of about 500 km. This possibly may occur due



Chapter 4. The SAC System Description 44

to formation of Lee Waves due to the crossing of the Mid Atlantic Ridge which might be

possible from the results of Scott et al. (2011).

FIGURE 4.15: Vertical section of WOA (left) and ARMOR3D (right) for 10° E.

Close to the eastward limit of the Atlantic Ocean (at 20° E), the southern jet of the

StHC merges with the AgC retroflection and flows into the Indian Ocean with a transport

of 19.1/20.4 Sv. At this longitude, the ACC system transports 121.2 Sv (or at least 70.3 Sv

for ARMOR3D) into Indian Ocean.

4.2.3 Synthesis

We now summarize our results with the most notable findings. Given the similarity be-

tween the two climatological data sets (ARMOR3D and WOA) we opt to synthesize the

results using the average between both.

At the westward edge of the Atlantic Ocean, the SAC is originated from the southern

most part of the BC retroflection as it collides with the MC. At 40° W the SAC presents two

branches (with total maximum transport of around 42 Sv) and still is highly influenced by the

BMC structure. The SAC branches circumvent the northern border of the Zapiola Rise. On



Chapter 4. The SAC System Description 45

the other hand, the MC extension contours the Zapiola Rise on its southern border, and as

it is formed essentially by subpolar waters, it is defined as the ACCn. At about 35 ° S the

StHC is formed from the northernmost portion of BC retroflection feature and presents water

mass characteristics similar to those of southeast Brazil.

From 40° W to 20° W, the SAC feeds both ACCn and StHC, making southern branch of

the SAC merge completely with the ACC. Making the northern branch of the SAC transport-

ing toughly of 15 Sv. As it reaches the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the SAC veers southeastward

and merges almost completely with the ACCn. They then form a broad jet with a transport of

around 80-100 Sv with remarkable changes in water mass properties meridionally. From 10°

W to 10° E, the SAC-ACCn jet presents robust meandering downstream of the ridge in the

climatological fields, which could be accounted by the fact of passing through the mid-ocean

ridge.

In contrast, the StHC at its formation site transports a mere 0.1 SV and is fed by the

northern branch of the SAC across the whole Atlantic Ocean. While it increases notably

its volume transport throughout its path, between 30° W-20° W the SAC feeding is more

vigorous which causes the StHC to reach the mid-oceanic ridge with 5-7.5 Sv. At 0° the

StHC splits into two branches. The southern branch of the StHC follows into the Indian

Ocean with a transport of around 10-14 Sv, while still being fed by the SAC, and the 6.5-8.6

Sv as StHC northern branch closes the SASG.

Both WOA and ARMOR3D data sets roughgly agree in terms ofvolume transport results,

aside from the most southern region (south of 55° S) where ARMOR3D presents no informa-

tion. We summarize this chapter findings by following Rodrigues et al. (2010) (see authors

Figure 11) and building an schematic flow map with the corresponding volume transports

(Figure 4.16).

The SAC System Mesoscale

Dynamics

In this Chapter we analysed the mesoscale dynamics associated with the SAC system

in terms of energetics and quasi-geostrophic instability. The energetics part was computed

from AVISO and discussed the partitioning between the mean kinectic energy (MKE) and

mean eddy kinectic energy (MEKE). The instability analysis aims to address the change in

linear instability properties, such as growth rate and phase speeds of the zonally changing

currents at the southern borders of the subtropical gyre.

5.1 Energetics

5.1.1 Anual Climatological Energetics

In term of energetics the higher kinectic energy are constrained to the SAC and ACC

within the BMC (Figure 5.1). Specially the flow that originates the ACC has the highest MKE

and MEKE. This energy can be seen translated in the Okubo-Weiss parameter field variation

(Figure 5.2).

Away from the BMC, there is a significant drop in MEKE and the standard deviation of

Okubo-Weiss; MKE, however, remains slightly stable up to the MAC. The StHC, in contrast,

acquires MKE as it flows eastward, in spite of that, its eddy energy does not significantly

increase as its OW standard deviation. This increase in kinectic energy occurs due to the

feeding by the SAC, which corroborates the previous results of volume transport (Chapter

4). This drainage, however, does not seem enough to increase its MEKE.



Chapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 48

FIGURE 5.1: AVISO mean total (A) and eddy (B) Kinectic Energy. Isolines
represent the streamfunction.

When both SAC and ACC pass through the MAC, part of their flow merge into a single

intense stream (as described in the previous chapter), this significantly increases both MKE

and MEKE. However, it seems that the ACCs (5° W/55° S) gets more unstable than the

SAC/ACC amalgamate, this increase in MEKE is translated into higher eddy shedding as it

can be seen in OW parameter variation (Figure 5.2). A pool of low MEKE just northward of

the SAC/ACC amalgamate can also be seen. This might occur due to this current merging

leaving a low unstable region.

Although the MKE energy at StHC is not significantly changed as it crosses the MAC,

there is a slight decrease in the MEKE. This slight decrease does not follow from OW data,

as it seems slightly higher west from the MAC. This suggests that the field variability within

AVISO. Isolines represent the streamfunction.

this region was not locally originated, but carried to there somehow. This variability is likely

being originated in the AgC and propagated westward until reaching the StHC domain.

5.1.2 Monthly climatological Energetics

In this section we brothen the analysis carried out in the previous section by examining

the SAC system energetics monthly variations. Figure 5.3 shows that the highest MEKE is

found near the BMC and AgC in all months. It also shows the presence of a higher time

dependent variation of energy on these two locations than the other regions. In addition, it is

possible to see again that to the west of the MAC (at the 40?W, 30?W, 20?W) both MKE and

MEKE decrease (Figure 5.4). This contrasts to what is observed to the east of the MAC: the

SAC keeps its nominal energy until it reaches the AgC.

At the SAC formation site (? 40?W), the MEKE is often higher than the MKE. The highest

eddy energy are between June-August (austral winter) with a maximum of 7×10?2 m2s?2.

The MKE highest values occur during the period of August-January with a maximum of

5.2×10?2 m2s?2. On the other hand, the lowest values of both MEKE and MKE are ob-

served during the period of February-April. MEKE has a minimum of 4.2×10?2 in April, and

MKE 0.1×10?2 in May.



Chapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 50

FIGURE 5.3: Mean Kinetic Energy (MKE) and Mean Eddy Kinetic Energy
(MEKE) monthly climatology. Red line indicates MEKE, while blue line indi-

cates the MKE

At 30° W, we see a notable decrease of both MKE and MEKE, although the MEKE is

still higher than the MKE. At this site, the highest eddy energy are found at May and at the

period from August to December. The maximum energy is of 2.4×10?2 m2s?2 in August.

However, the MKE has its maximum energy in February and March (0.7×10?2 m2s?2 in

March). However, In April we see a decrease of 0.5×10?2 m2s?2. We speculate that the

increase in the maximum MEKE in May is associated with this decrease in MKE. From May

to October we see a constant decrease of MKE which seems to also be associated with the

period of high MEKE.

At 20° W, we see that both MKE and MEKE reaches their lowest values with very little

variations of both. While the maximum MEKE is found in November with 0.9×10?2 m2s?2,

the minimum is found in july with 0.3×10?2 m2s?2. However, the MKE has its maximum in

july with 0.2×10?2 m2s?2 and minimum in December slightly over 0.01×10?2 m2s?2.

In contrast, at 10° W, the MKE and MEKE starts increasing again likely due to the SAC-

ACCn interaction. However, at this site the MKE is slightly over MEKE in the period of



Chapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 51

FIGURE 5.4: Same as Figure 5.3, but for the sections between 30° W and 0°.

october-january where MKE is the highest (with a maximum of 0.9×10?2 m2s?2 in Decem-

ber). The MEKE does not change notably in the period of January-July, but in August it

increases to 0.8×10?2 m2s?2 and decreases until October. From this month to december, it

increases its MEKE along with the MKE.

At the Greenwich Meridian (0°), the MEKE only surpasses the MKE in October. The

MKE shows a paraboloidal shape between January to July, reaching a maximum in April

of 1.0×102 m2s?2. At this month, we also see a minimum of MEKE of 0.4×10?2 m2s?2.

However, in october we see a peak of MEKE of 0.6×10?2 m2s?2, but also a minimum of

MKE of 0.5×10?2 m2s?2.

Near the AgC (10° E), we see a return of the pattern near the BMC. We see again the

MEKE surpassing notably the MKE, but we see less monthly variation of the MKE. The lat-

ter shows maximum peaks at March (0.9×10?2 m2s?2) and August-September (1.1×10?2

m2s?2). Near these peaks, we see a sharp decrease in MEKE from january (4.3×102 m2s?2)

to february (1.9×10?2 m2 ?2) and another decrease from July (5.1×102 m2s?2) to Septem-

ber (1.8×10?2 m2s?2).



Chapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 52

5.1.3 Synthesis

We synthesize the results previoiusly presented in which will be used to supplement the

instability analysis of the next section as follows. The StHC has a remarkable increase in

MKE and MEKE at around 35° W. In Section 4.2.2 we observe that in the vicinities of the

25° W meridian the StHC increases in transport five times due to more heavily feeding by

the SAC. Between 35° W-10° E, its MKE is not notably changed in its path. The current’s

MEKE only slightly increases in the surroudings of the MAC.

The SAC, in contrast, has a high MKE and MEKE associated with its formationsite. The

eddy energy at this region seems to be highly seasonal dependent (higher in winter months).

Eastward from its formation, but west from the MAC, we see a decrease of MEKE, specially

when the current crosses the MAC system. At that site, the absolute values of MKE and

MEKE as well as its seasonal variability are the lowest. The standard deviation of OW also

shows a local low of eddy presence on the MAC for this current.

East of the MAC, where the SAC and ACCn merge (? 10° W), we see an increase of both

MKE and MEKE of the SAC-ACCn and ACCs. We can see in the OW standard deviation

an increase of eddy variability in the region, suggesting that the energy present is enough

to make the currents highly unstable. Near Meteor Rise (5° E) we see another decrease

in MEKE which could suggest the tectonic feature plays an important role on the current

stability and instability since there is a presence of high eddy presence in the region east of

the rise.

5.2 Linear Instability Analysis

In this section we address the problem of linear instability of the SAC system by means

of examining the baroclinic instability phenomenon locally and seeking the SAC system jet

mixed instability properties.

For the first approach, in Section 5.2.1, we follow the guidelines proposed by Smith

(2007) and Tulloch et al. (2011) but employing an adapted version of Johns (1988) 1-D, QG

model, as presented in Section 3.2. For the second approach, in Section 5.2.2, we built

a version of the Kontoyiannis (1997) model using the meridional velocity vertical sections



Chapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 53

obtained in Section 4.2.2 for the six selected longitudes (40° W, 30° W, 20° W, 10° W, 0°,

10° E).

5.2.1 Local Baroclinic Analysis

Figure 5.5 presents the growth rate and phase speed maps of the unstable waves em-

bedded in the SAC system. As it can be observed in the upper panel of Figure 5.5 it is not

surprising to us that the BMC and AgC region do not present extremely high values com-

pared to the South Atlantic Basin interior. We only considered the zonal component of the

velocities and both regions are marked by dominant meridional flow patterns (see Figure

4.5).

Corroborating Smith (2007) and Tulloch et al. (2011), the SASG southern border region

is in overall unstable. Exceptions of stable flow are found (i) over the MAC and Meteor Rise,

and (ii) a sort of near-quiescent flow between 8° W and 8° E at 42° S, east of the location

that the SAC veered south to merge with the ACCn.

At 40° W, it can be can be seen a high growth rate values at 37° S and south of 40° S.

The former latitude maximum growth is centered at the core of the SAC northern branch,

while the latter maxima seems to be related to both SAC and ACCn since it is located in ther

northern edge of the Zapiola Rise (see also Figure 4.7).

East from the MAC, it is notable the presence of a high growth rate spot at the region

where SAC-ACCn merges. This is in accordance with MEKE results, which shows these

regions to present high levels of eddy energy.

It is interesting to note that around 25° W, there is a high growth rate of the StHC which

is the region where the SAC donates volume and momentum to the StHC. This result seems

to correlate with the MEKE map (Figure 5.1). This suggests the StHC is potentially unstable

from its formation site to the eastward edge of the basin. The current instability from 10° W

to 10° E seems to condractict our previous speculation that the tongue of local maximum

values of MEKE (depicted in Figure 5.1) between 10° W to 10° E connects the AgC domain

with the StHC. We do not, however, disregard the possibility of the interplay between both

on the local dynamics of the region.

In terms of phase speeds, most of the unstable waves within the southern SAASG region

propagates eastward. The fastest propagating waves are generated in the southern branch



Chapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 54

Streamlines of the main flow are plotted over the linear model results.

of the BMC. The most unstable mode at the formation site of the SAC shows a propagat-

ing wave of around 1.5×10?1 ms?1. This speed decreases at the MAC and increases to

2.8×10?1 ms?1 as both SAC-ACCn merge. This speed slightly decrease until it reaches

the Indian Ocean. In contrast, the StHC’s waves highest phase speed are found around

35° W of about 0.7×10?1 ms?1 and maintains this celerity across the South Atlantic Ocean.

However, the exception is at the MAC where the model could not model unstable waves of

the StHC.

5.2.2 Seccional Mixed Instability Analysis

In this section, we discuss the mixed instability model analysis following Kontoyiannis

(1997). In the very first part of this section, since the QG model was fully constructed in

house, we validate the results with analytical jet sections.



Chapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 55

Model Validation

In order to validate the validate the model we opt to test barotropic and baroclinic insta-

bility separately. We then formulate a sectional distribution of (i) a jet in an stratified ocean

which is stable baroclinically and unstable barotropically; and (ii) a jet which does not satisfy

the Rayleigh-Kuo instability criterion, but its unstable baroclinically. The general formulation

for the zonal jet and the Brünt-Väisälä frequency seccional distributions are given by:

???
??
u(y,z) = U0(y) F(z)

N2(z) = N20 G(z),

(5.1)

where F(z), and G(z) are the vertical structure functions for N2 and u, respectively. U0(y) is

the horizontal structure function for the jet. The theoretical expressions for F(z), G(z), and

U0(y) are given by:

???????
??????
U0(y) = u0 sech(y/L0)

2 cos(?2?y/Lu)

F(z) = 1/(u1 + u2) (u1e
?z/hu + u2e

?z/hN )

G(z) = e?z/hN

(5.2)

The corresponding values for the barotropically and baroclinically unstable tests, respec-

tively, are presented in Table 5.1.

For the barotropically unstable jet (Figure 5.6.A1), we created an intense (with a core

velocity of 0.16 ms?1) and gaussian shaped structure horizontally, which decreases expo-

nentially with depth and reaches the null velocity at 2600 m depth. Th estratification was

set to have a Brünt-Väisälä seccional distribution constant along the y-axis, and that also

decreases as a simple exponential function with depth. We see that the ambient potential

vorticity meridional gradient (Figure 5.6.B1) just changes of sign horizontally.

Numerically, the profile resolution was of 20 km and 137 m horizontally and vertically,

respectively. The results of the seccional model was confronted with a simple 1D barotropic

model which was run with the same horizontal resolution of the seccional one, i.e. 20 km.

We see that the ambient potential vorticity meridional gradient (Figure 5.6.B1) just basically

changes of sign horizontally. There are indeed very small sign inversions probably due to

numerical round off errors on computing the ambient potential vorticity gradient. Neverthe-

less, the 1D local baroclinic model solved with the same vertical resolution of the seccional

one revealed that the jet is stable.

The comparison between both models for the batrotropic case, shown in Figure 5.7.A1

and 5.7.B1, shows a virtually total agreement between the datasets. The only notable dif-

ference is where between the wavenumber 1.3×10?2 km?1 and 1.4×10?2 km?1. These

difference might be related to the fact that the model might be only an approximate affine

function1.

The results for the calibration test for the baroclinc case, shown in Figure 5.7.B1 and

Figure 5.7.B2, also exhibits a striking similarity between them. However, there are a few

differences worth noticing. At around 5×10?3 km?1, the growth rate curve of the 2D model,

was somewhat lower than that of the 1D model. The model fails to reproduce the 1D re-

sults for wavenumbers lower than 12×10?3 km?1. This suggests that perhaps there are

limitations on the 2D model on estimating the instability properties in the long wave limit.

Model Application to Selected Longitudes

We describe next the application of the 2-D model onto the velocity sections obtained

for the WOA-derived jet configurations. We use the six selected meridional sections: 40° W,

30° W, 20° W, 10° W, 0°, 10° E. After validation, the analysis of the sections from WOA can

a mixed instability model, might not be necessarily the same as the sum of a baroclinic and barotropic model
individually.

be finally performed. The analysis will be limited to a maximum wavenumber of 0.1 km?1 as

explained in section 3.2.1.

1. 40° W

The first section, near the BMC (40° W), between 45° W-34° W, comprises of a cur-

rent of two cores (with maximum velocity of 8×10?2 ms?1 and 7.5×10?2 ms?1), as

described in the Chapter 4, reaching a maximum depth of 3600 m (Figure 5.8). The

northern core has a steeper vertical velocity decay as the southern core, which in itself

might suggest that the former core is more unstable than the latter.

The instability model results indicate a growth rate curves with three distinctive max-

ima. The highest growth rate is at the wavenumber 5.8×10?2 km?1 of about 2.6×10?2



Chapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 58

FIGURE 5.7: Instability results of the uni/bidimensional model for the phase

results.

days?1 slightly higher than the local baroclinically instability result. The phase propa-

gation speed of the fastest growing mode is estimated by the model as 4.4×10?2 ms?1

(Figure 5.9). Using the relation between wavenumber, wavefrequency and the wave

phase speed, we can easily estimate the period of the waves (Figure 5.10). The wave

period of the fastest growth rate is of around 28 days.

We identify, by reconstructing the perturbed meridional velocity vertical profile for the

most unstable mode (V ?max = Re{?maxei?max}), that the unstable meander core is

associated with the northern branch of the SAC (Figure 5.9). The velocity perturbation

structure is confined to 2000 m with a core located at 150 m. The relevant width is

about 75 km only. In other words, the most unstable meander occurs essentially at the

core of the SAC northern branch. However, as the range of unstable ks is long, other

meander patterns and core locations with less degree of instability are possible.

2. 30° W

At this longitude, the SAC still exhibits two cores. Its northern core (between 42° S-37°

S) is more intense than the southern one with maximum velocities of about 9×10?2



Chapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 59

ms?1. The southern core has a maximum velocity of around 7.5×10?1 ms?1. These

cores now have a less pronounced decay as the ones at 40° W.

The most unstable wave at this longitude grows with an approximate rate of 2.6×10?2

days?1, similar to the rate obtained 40° W in terms of not only the rate itself, but also

the most unstable wavenumber at 0.07 km?1. The unstable wave phase speeds are

eastward for the whole computed k range. The model estimates the phase speed for

the fastest growing mode as 8.2×10?2 ms?1.

We see that for the fastest growth rate, the velocity vertical structure is again centered

at the northernmost core with a period of about 12 days. The core of this perturbation

mode is located at 200 m depth while its structure is confined in depth by 1500 m and

width by 121 km. Hence, we observe that despite the basic jet between 40° W and 30°

W retains similar characteristics, the waves at the latter longitude seems to propagate

faster than those at the former.

3. 20° W

Near the west edge of the MAC, the southermost SAC core is almost negligible with a

velocity of about 5.5×10?2 ms?1, while the northernmost core has a velocity of around

7.3×10?2 ms?1. Therefore, the SAC presents a more conventional parabolic jet profile.

The mean jet structure decays faster with depth than the previously analysed section.

The growth curve pattern resembles those of calculated for 40° W and 30° W with

single maximum well defined at the wavenumber of 0.05 km?1. The corresponding

growth rate is 2.4×10?2 days?1. The phase speed regime for the k range of interest

shows eastward propagating waves increasing in speed with decreasing wavelength.

The phase speed of the fastest growing phase meander is 5×10?2 ms?1. The most

unstable wave has a characteristic period of 28 days.

The maximum amplitude of the perturbed meridional velocity is foudn again at the core

of the northern branch with a maximum at 150 m depth and with a vertical structure

confined in the upper 2300 m. The more relevant amplitudes are limited to about 43

km around the v? core.

4. 10° W

FIGURE 5.9: Model instability results (phase speed and growth rate). The
shadowed region represents the domain not analysed

Near the east edge of the MAC, the mean jet configuration of the SAC (located at 40°

S and 38° S) have a vertical velocity of 1×10?2 ms?1 with a very weak vertical decay.

Between 38° S-32° S, the StHC current presents a core 6×10?2 ms?1 with a strong

baroclinic vertical decay and, therefore, a vertical structure confined at the upper 1500

m.

The instability property curves are remarkably different from the more western sections

studied previously. The fastest growth rate is 0.5×10?2 days?1 for the 0.03 km?1

wavenumber. The speed of the propagating wave of the fastest growth rate is westward

of around 3×10?2 ms?1 and a wave period of 21.5 days.

The perturbed velocity pattern exhibits lobes and counterlobes with opposing signs

and are, as in all other cases, centered at the StHC current core. The maximum

absolute v? value is found at 400 m. The depth and width of the meander patter is

found to be 600 m and 67 km, respectively.



Chapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 62

5. 0° W

At this longitude, the StHC core has properties resulting from the merging between the

original StHC and portion of the SAC northern branch (which mainly occurred at 20°

W). Its maximum velocity is about 6×10?2 ms?1. The StHC vertical structure reaches

the ocean floor. The jet presents a clssical parabolic shape with about 666 km.

The modeled growth rate curve increases almost monotonically as a function of the

wavenumber. Therefore, its fastest growth rate within the wavenumber range of interest

was found at 0.1 km?1 (which is the upper bound k chosen for our analysis). The phase

speed curve is virtually a straight line with westward constant values of 0.4×10?2

ms?1. The period of the corresponding fastest growing wave is 165 days.

The instability velocity was found at the southernmost part of the section at the bottom

of the column. This very narrow structure (17 km), has its core located at 2600 m

depth with 1000 m height. As this velocity pattern presents abnormal structure, we

choose to disregard this result in comparison with the previous ones.

6. 10° E

Closer to the AgC retroflection system, the StHC is split into two cores where, as

discussed in section 4.2.3 (Figure. 4.16), its southern branch flows southward, joins

the SAC-ACCn jet, and flows towards the Indian Ocean. The northern branch is the

one to close the SASG.

The growth rate curve of this section resembles a gaussian shape and, therefore, only

one maxima (1.5×10?2 days?1) which corresponds to the wavenumber 0.04 km?1.

The most unstable wave travels eastward with c = 1.9×10?2 ms?1. This unstable

waves has periods of 89 days.

The perturbed velocity profile presents its maximum amplitude at 200 m and extends

down to 3100 m. It presents a width of 262 km and unlike the previous results its

maximum is located in the region in between the two branches.

5.2.3 Discussion and Synthesis

In this section we summarize the mesoscale dynamics of the SAC as having a significant

change throughout its path. The MAC seems to act not only to change the kinematic of the

current system (see Chapter 4), but also its instability. The linear instability properties are

summarized in Tables 5.2 and 5.3.

From the seccional model analysis we observe two clear distinctive regimes: one at west

and another at east of the MAC. West of the MAC the growth rates and phase speeds are,

on average, 2.5×10?2 days?1 and 5.9×10?2 ms?1, respectively. Just east of the MAC (10°

W), growth rates are very slow and velocities are weakly westward in the seccional model

and weakly eastward in the local baroclinic model. Our interpretation is that in this sense

the topographic feature seemed to somehow stabilize the SAC-StHC jet. With the merging

FIGURE 5.11: Velocity vertical structure estimated from model for each sec-
tion for the fastest growth rate.

of part of the SAC with the ACC we see that along with the increase of the MKE we see an

increase of the current instability which is in agreement of the MEKE results.

Closer to the eastern boundaries, the growth rates and phase speeds are 1.7×10?2 and

1.9×10?2, respectively. Although, at 10° E, the instability analysis of the seccional model

shows an instability between both northern southern cores of the StHC, the local instability

model presents a high instability at both northern and southern cores of the jets. This result

could indicate a presence of a significant barotropic instability within this section.

We are not aware of any specific studies regarding the mesoscale dynamics and insta-

bility in the southern border of the SASG to date. The only ones seem to be the global study

focused on local baroclinic instability by Smith (2007) commanded in the previous subsec-

tion. Although they are much faster than the local baroclinic model, which averages around

of 1.6×10?2 days?1, the patterns between both models are roughly similar, i.e. the growth

rates west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge are slightly faster than those at east of it. However,

the values found are still lower than those calculate by Tulloch et al. (2011) in our region for

the Ocean Comprehensible Atlas (OCCA) data set (which is approximately 0.05 days?1).

Although Kontoyiannis (1997) also finds substantially faster growth rates for the Gulf Stream

(around 0.15 days?1), the wavenumber of the fastest growth rate for this current is around

0.025 km?1 which is roughly similar to our region (Figure 5.9). Smith (2007) calculated a

growth rate of 0.16 days?1 for the ACC south of Tasmania and 0.036 days?1 for the Kuroshio

extension which is the most similar instability results as our region.

The unstable wave phase speeds of our seccional model are partly in agreement with our

local baroclinic model results having simulated eastward-propagating waves, but at faster

speeds. Aside from the spurious results of the 0°longitude, the 10° W is the only longitude

that produces opposite wave speed propagation for both models. Hughes (1995) through

altimetry results found that Rossby waves propagating eastward are common in the southern

oceans which is in agreement with our findings for the SAC current. They also found that

within the ACC core Rossby waves propagates eastward, however, away from the core,

Rossby waves propagates westward, which was not identified by our local baroclinic model.

Hughes (1996) argues that propagation of baroclinic Rossby waves are strongly affected

by the mean flow in high latitudes. The author argues that large-scale eastward flows with

speeds greater than those of long Rossby waves advect all of these waves eastward.



Chapter 5. The SAC System Mesoscale Dynamics 66

The perturbation velocity does not greatly changes across sections, except the 10° W

which is a very narrow and shallow jet with the deepest core. Smith (2007) found that the

ACC south of Tasmania presents a v? core of about 1000m depth. On the other hand, the

author reported the Kuroshio extension presented 200m v? maximum velocity, which is in

agreement with our model. A first inspection on the Qy, U, and v? fields of the selected six

longitudinal transects suggests that the SAC system are dominated by baroclinic Phillips-like

instabilities. Indeed, from the results of Tulloch et al. (2011) Charney-type are more common

within low latitudes, which does not seem to be the case for our region.

Chapter 6

Conclusions

In this chapter we conclude our findings and present our interpretation to our hypotheses

estipulated in Section 1.3. To confirm or reject our first hypothesis, we answer the questions

raised in the same section which themselves led to the hypothesis formulated:

1. Is the StHC indeed an independent current fed by the first retroflection of the BC as

claimed by Juliano and Alves (2007) or part of the SAC?

Our results show that there is slight difference between the temperature correlation

of the SAC and StHC. Additionally, it was identified a trivial transport of the StHC at

40° W which only significantly increase east of 30° W. So, the formation of this current

might not be located at the BMC, but rather at the SAC itself. Therefore, our results

do not significantly support the idea of the StHC being an independent current. It is

likely that the StHC is a nothern branch of the SAC (SACn) that travels zonally along

its other branch (SACs).

2. Does the water mass composition allows the differentiation between the SAC and the

ACC as well as the identification of their longitudes as they merge and exit the Atlantic

Ocean basin?

We interpret that the T-S-?0 correlation analysis provided a clear result differentiating

both SAC and ACC. The SAC is easily visible within subtropical correlation structure

as it flows zonally until the MAC. At this site, however, the velocity analysis structure

indicates that the SAC is not distinguishable from the ACCn. Their water mass proper-

ties are transported to Indian Ocean as a broad jet (with a meridional span of 5°). The

ACCn and ACCs jets are easily distinguishable through most of the ocean basin. We



Chapter 6. Conclusions 68

can therefore say that through the water mass composition we can estimate the region

where the waters are most closely correlated with the current, but as they merge we

cannot identify them separately.

3. What is the role of the StHC (SACn) in the SASG southern limb?

The SACn is the branch which indeed closes the SASG. As it approach the eastern

South Atlantic boundary, it also splits in two branches. The southern branches follows

zonally to the Indian Ocean, while the northern veers northeastward along with BeC

closing the gyre. The SACs, however, is fully merged with the ACCn (10° W) and flows

along to the Indian Ocean. Part of this current feeds StHC from its formation to about

10° E.

From the answers provided above, we do not reject our first hypothesis that The SAC-

StHC (SACn-SACs) with the same T-S signature travels zonally along the SASG southern

limb and close the gyre. The T-S-?0 correlation provides a slight distinction between the

SACs-SACn (which should be further investigated), but provides a clear distinction between

these currents and the ACC. Additionally the transport analysis suggest that the location of

the SACn is at the SAC current.

The second hypothesis formulated is related to the instability analysis. To further confirm

or reject our hypothesis, we again turn to answer our question from section 1.3:

1. Is the SAC current unstable throughout its flow path and does the MAC acts a stabilizer

to the SASG southern limb current system?

Yes, we find that, in general, the whole SAC system is unstable throughout the SASG.

From our local baroclinic and seccional mixed model, suplemmented our energetic

analysis, we identify a clear change of instability characteristics and eddy energy. Al-

though, the current at the eastern side of the MAC (10° S) seems more stable than in

the western side, the eddy energy seems to not be affected, suggesting a more com-

plex phenomena involving the unstable zonal jets and AgC rings region. We should

mention that in the vicinities and over the Meteor Rise the current are stable by the

local model simulations and marginally unstable by the mixed seccional model.

We therefore do not reject our second hypothesis of The SAC system undergoes through

important zonal changes in their jet configurations as they cross the South Atlantic basin,



Chapter 6. Conclusions 69

which in turn yields different patterns of mesoscale activity. The SAC does undergoes

through changes as it crosses the Atlantic Ocean. The most relevant differences are found

when the current crosses the MAC, and also through the Meteor Rise. We suspect the

formation of lee waves at the site, but we did not investigated it further.

In order to advance in the understanding of the heat and salt fluxes at southern limb of

the SASG, more in situ observations are needed. In particular, direct velocity profiling on the

SAC system must be carried out. We found only one hydrographic transect from the WOCE

program which crossed the BMC that had LADCP profiles available.

As future work, we aim to conduct further investigation using global model outputs and

satellite altimetry in order to better understand the instability wave and the related eddy

fluxes associated with them. We know that the South Atlantic ocean is probably the last

frontier of the worlds ocean to be unraveled in its role to the world climate.

The Partial Differential Instability

Equation

From the linearized quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity equations:

???
??
Dt(vx ?uy) + ?v = f0wz

Dt? + w??z = 0

(A.1)

where Dt is the total derivative;? is defined as ? = fy; w is the k? component of velocity;

and ? and ?? is the density and its horizontal average. With the hydrostatic equation, and

considering u and v as geostrophic we get:

???
??

[1/(?0f0)][Dt(?2p) + ?px] = f0wz

(1/?0)Dt(?z) + N
2w = 0

(A.2)

where p is pressure; and ?0 is the density from Bousinesq Approximation. The problem will

be established as being zonal with rigid walls with constant depth, rigid lid and no normal

flow along vertical boundaries:

???

w = 0 z = 0, H

v = 0 y = 0, W

(A.3)

From these equation, we assume the fields can be decomposed in its respective average

and an small perturbation:

v(x,y,z,t) = v?(x,y,z,t)

w(x,y,z,t) = w?(x,y,z,t)

(A.4)

where U is defined as U = ?p?y/(?0f0). If we substitute the previous equations (Eq. A.4) in
