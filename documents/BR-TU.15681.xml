SOIL WATER RETENTION AND S INDEX AFTER CROP
ROTATION AND CHISELING(1)

Juliano Carlos Calonego(2) &amp;amp; Ciro Antonio Rosolem(3)

SUMMARY

Soil compaction can be minimized either mechanically or biologically, using
plant species with vigorous root systems.  An experiment was carried out with
soybean (Glycine max) in rotation with triticale (X Triticosecale) and sunflower
(Helianthus annuus) in fall-winter associated with pearl millet (Pennisetum
glaucum), grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) or sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) in
spring.  Crop rotation under no-till was compared with mechanical chiseling.  The
experiment was carried out in Botucatu, São Paulo State, Brazil.  Soil quality was
estimated using the S index and soil water retention curves (in the layers of 0–0.05,
0.075–0.125, 0.15–0.20, 0.275–0.325, and 0.475–0.525 m deep).  Crop rotation and
chiseling improved soil quality, increasing the S index to over 0.035 to a depth of
20 cm in the soil profile.  The improved soil quality, as shown by the S index, makes
the use of mechanical chiseling unnecessary, since after 3 years the soil physical
quality under no-tilled crop rotation and chiseling was similar.

INTRODUCTION

The development of compacted layers in
agricultural areas, caused either by external pressure
of machine or animal traffic (Lima et al., 2004) or by
natural soil particle consolidation (Dias Jr., 2000), has
become a common problem (Andreola et al., 2000;
Spera et al., 2004).  A possibility to improve the soil
structural quality would be the use of crop rotation of
species with vigorous root systems, able to grow
through soil layers with high penetration resistance,
and creating pores through which the next crop roots
can grow (Silva &amp;amp; Rosolem, 2001).  Cover crops are
species planted before or after cash crops to keep
nutrients from leaching, soil from eroding, and land
from being overgrown by weeds.  Important benefits
have been observed in soil structure, both in the short
and long term, when cover crops with voluminous
and aggressive root systems are used (Dias Jr., 2000).

An adequate assessment of the soil physical quality
should include different properties that characterize
the physical environment plants are exposed to (Silva
et al., 1994).  Dexter (2004) considered that the soil
water retention curve (WRC) could be used as an
indicator of soil physical quality, and therefore
proposed the S index.  The S index corresponds to the
angular coefficient (slope of the tangent) at the
inflection point of the retention curve that can be fitted
using the model proposed by van Genuchten (1980).
Several soil properties such as texture, compaction,
organic matter content and root growth were
correlated with the S index, and it was concluded that
S &amp;lt;0.020 indicates soil with high physical restriction,
0.025 &amp;lt;S &amp;lt;0.035 indicates unfavorable and S &gt; 0.035
favorable soil conditions for root growth (Dexter, 2004).
For Andrade &amp;amp; Stone (2009), the threshold of S = 0.045
seems to be appropriate to separate soils with good
structural conditions from degraded soils, while S ?
0.025 identifies soils with complete physical
degradation.  Tormena et al. (2008) and Cavalieri et
al. (2009) also found a direct relationship between
increasing soil density and reduction in S index.
Andrade &amp;amp; Stone (2009) reported a positive correlation
between macroporosity and the S index as well,
independent of the soil texture class, showing that
this is an appropriate indicator of soil physical quality.
Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the
effect of crop rotation of cover crop species in no-till

and chiseling on soil water retention curves and on
the improvement in soil physical quality, as
determined by the S index.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The experiment was carried out in Botucatu, State
of São Paulo, Brazil, from 2003 to 2006, on a clayey
Rhodic Nitosol (FAO, 1990) or “Nitossolo Vermelho”
distroférrico (Embrapa, 2006), in an area (22°49’ S,
48°25’ W; 786 m asl) where soybean/black oat/corn/
triticale had been sown in no-tillage rotation as of 1997.
The climate was classified (Köppen, 1931) as CWa,
i.e, a subtropical, humid climate with dry winters.
The dry season from May to September is well-defined.
Mean rainfall is approximately 1400 mm, the highest
monthly mean temperature is over 22 °C and the
lowest below 18°C.  Before the experiment began in
April 2003, a 1 m deep trench was opened, and a
compacted layer was detected 0.05–0.20 m deep.  The
soil was sampled for chemical (Raij et al., 2001) and
physical analyses (Smith &amp;amp; Mullins, 1991) (Table 1
and Figure 1).  Soil mechanical penetration resistance
(PR) was evaluated throughout the profile using an
electronic penetrograph.

Treatments consisted of the crops triticale (X
Triticosecale Wittmack) and sunflower (Helianthus
annuus) in the fall-winter period, combined with pearl
millet (Pennisetum glaucum L., var. BN-2), forage
sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and sunn
hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) in the spring as cover
crops, and an additional treatment with chiseling, all
of which preceded soybean (Glycine max L., Merrill),
var.  Embrapa 48.  This crop sequence was repeated
from 2003 to 2006.  Mechanical chiseling was carried
out in September 2003 using a chisel plow with seven
shanks set on two bars and spaced 0.60 m from each
other, resulting in an effective 0.30 m between-drill
spacing.  The shanks were inclined forward forming
a 25o angle with an effective action depth of around
0.30 m.  A cylinder was attached to the equipment to
break up the biggest clods and smooth the soil surface
in order to avoid harrowing.  The soil was chiseled on
only one occasion, that is, after harvesting the fall-winter
crops in the first year (September 2003); these plots
were left fallow between the winter and summer crops.

escarificação melhoraram a qualidade do solo, aumentando o índice S acima de 0,035 até
0,20 m no perfil do solo.  Entretanto, a melhoria na qualidade do solo, conforme determinada
por meio do índice S, não justifica o uso de escarificação mecânica, uma vez que as parcelas
sob rotação de culturas em semeadura direta mostraram qualidade física do solo semelhante
após três anos.

SOIL WATER RETENTION AND S INDEX AFTER CROP ROTATION AND CHISELING                   1929

R. Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:1927-1937, 2011

Undisturbed soil was sampled prior to the
experiment (in April 2003) and prior to soybean sowing
in the first and third year of the experiment (before
soybean sowing).  Trenches (0.30 x 0.60 m, depth
0.60 m) were dug and samples collected from the walls
(layers 0–0.05, 0.075–0.125, 0.15–0.20, 0.275–0.325,
and 0.475–0.525 m) using volumetric cylinders (height
0.050 m, internal diameter 0.048 m).  Immediately
after sampling, the cylinders were sealed with plastic
lids.  The characteristic soil water retention curves
(WRC) were determined as proposed by Embrapa
(1997).  Briefly, undisturbed soil samples were placed
on plastic trays with water to saturate.  After
saturation, they were subjected to tensions of 20, 40,
60, 100, 333, 1000, 5000, and 15000 hPa.  A tension
table was used to obtain matric potentials (?m) of
-20,-40 and -60 hPa, and matric potentials of -100,
-333, -1000, -5000, and -15000 hPa were obtained using
a Richards chamber (Klute, 1986).  The amount of
water retained in the soil at each potential was
determined by weighing the samples at the saturation
point and when hydraulic equilibrium was reached.

After the water had been extracted at 15000 hPa,
the sample was weighed and dried at 105 °C for 48 h
in a forced air oven.  Then the dry weight of the
samples was determined.  After obtaining the
gravimetric moisture at each matric potential, the
WRC was determined by fitting the original data to

The experiment was set up in a randomized complete
blocks in a split-plot design with four replications.  Triticale
and sunflower were planted on the main plots.  Sub-
plots were cropped to pearl millet, forage sorghum and
sunn hemp or were mechanicaly chiseled.  Sunflower
rows were spaced 0.51 m, and triticale 0.17 m apart.
Pearl millet, sorghum and sunn hemp rows were spaced
0.17 m apart.  Soybean was planted in rows spaced
0.45 m and fertilized with P and K.  Sunflower and
triticale were not fertilized and the cover crop species
were fertilized at planting with 40 kg ha-1 N (urea).

the function (Equation 1) proposed by van Genuchten
(1980).  The equation considers the matric potential
(?) as independent and the gravimetric moisture (?)
as dependent variable.

? = ?r + ((?s - ?r) / (1 + (??)n)1-1/n) (1)

where ? = soil gravimetric moisture at each matric
potential (kg kg-1); ?r = soil gravimetric moisture at
the matric potential of -15000 hPa (kg kg-1); ?s =
saturated soil gravimetric moisture (kg kg-1); ? =
matric potential (hPa); ?, n = coefficients of the equation.

The S index, i.e., the angular coefficient of the soil
water retention curve, was determined using
equation 2, which is derived from equation 1 as
proposed by Dexter (2004).  The index S modulus was
used to discuss the results.

S = -n(?s - ?r))((2n-1)/(n-1))((1/n)-2) (2)

where S = angular coefficient of the water retention
curve at the inflection point; ?r = soil gravimetric
moisture at the matric potential -15000 hPa (kg kg-1);
?s = saturated soil gravimetric moisture (kg kg-1); n
= coefficient of the water retention curve in the soil
(Equation 1).

The water retention curves were fit using SWRC
software (Dourado Neto et al., 1990) and tested using
the F test (p &amp;lt;0.05) (Tables 2 e 3).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The soil of the experimental area was structurally
degraded in the subsurface below 0.075 m, causing
physical restrictions for root growth in the profile
(Dexter, 2004).  The physical restrictions resulted from
the high penetration resistance (PR), soil bulk density
(BD), and macroporosity below 0.10 m3 m-3 (Table 1),
considered limiting for optimum plant growth, and
the angular coefficient (S) below 0.035 (Figure 1).

The highest soil water retention between
saturation and -60 hPa in the 0–0.05 m layer was
observed after the triticale plus pearl millet treatment
(Figure 2a), at the end of the first year of the
experiment, indicating higher total porosity and
macroporosity (Reichardt &amp;amp; Timm, 2004).  According
to Reeve &amp;amp; Carter (1991), compacted soils are
characterized by lower water retention at low tensions
(0 to 100 hPa), resulting from decreased porosity,
mainly of the macropores, which are filled with
gravitational water at the highest matric potentials
(less negative).  Conversely, an increase in water
retention is usually observed at the lower potentials
(more negative) as result of increased micro porosity,
increasing the capillary water volume.  Therefore, the
water curve of soils with this characteristic has a lower
S index, that is, the angle of the tangent passing
through the inflection point is smaller (Dexter, 2004).

The water retention curve, in the treatment with
triticale and pearl millet, was typical of less compacted
soil in 0–0.05 m (Reichardt &amp;amp; Timm, 2004) and had
the greatest S value, i.e., S = 0.051, similar to the
value of 0.055 obtained by Cavalieri et al. (2009) in
the 0–0.10 m layer in a soil under long-term no-tillage
in Paraná, Brazil.  The only treatment resulting in
an S index lower than 0.035 was sunflower and
sorghum (Figure 3a).  Dexter (2004) concluded that
the S index was directly and indirectly related with
soil organic matter and soil compaction, respectively.
Thus, a higher S index value indicates a better soil
structural quality.

Greater water retention at low tensions was
observed again by the WRC in the triticale plus pearl
millet treatment, in the layer 0.075–0.125 m
(Figure 2b), indicating a greater volume of macropores.
At this depth, when triticale was planted in chiseled
plots, a WRC with characteristics of less compacted
soil was also observed.  Saturated soil moisture was
highest in this treatment, in other words, total porosity
was greatest, water retention at medium and high
tensions lower (over 100 hPa) and the proportion of
micropores decreased.  Another indication of minimized
soil compaction in plots with this treatment was the
lower water retention at the permanent wilting point
(PWP), that is, at the -15000 hPa matric potential.  An
increase in soil bulk density may increase water
retained at the PWP (Cavalieri et al., 2006) because
after exposure to a tension of 15000 hPa, the remaining
soil water is in a thin film, retained by adsorption
(with high energy) around the soil colloids (sheet water).

When the S index was applied to study the soil
structural degradation in the 0.075–0.125 m layer
(Figure 3b), it was observed again that triticale plus
pearl millet or triticale plus chiseling enhanced the
soil physical quality in the very first year of the
experiment, since the S values were highest in these
treatments (0.054 and 0.055, respectively).

In the 0.15–0.20 m soil layer, greater soil
compaction was observed in plots with sunflower plus
sunn hemp, since the water content was lower in
saturated soil (Figure 2c), leading to the lowest S index
value 0.017 (Figure 3c), which was very close to that
observed in the first year of the experiment, S = 0.015
(Table 1).  According to Dexter (2004), S values below
0.020 are associated with very poor soil physical
properties.  On the other hand, growing triticale on
chiseled plots resulted in a typical WRC of less
compacted soils in this layer (Figure 2c).  Although it
did not increase the soil maximum water retention
capacity, this treatment reduced the water retained
in micropores, i..e, in matric potentials below -60 hPa.
Furthermore, in this treatment the lowest soil
moisture was detected at PWP, resulting in a greater
S value (S = 0.040) in the first year (Figure 3c).  For
Dexter (2004), an S value of 0.035 is the minimum
threshold to characterize good soil structure quality.
However, in the tropical soils of Brazil, this condition

would only be met with S values over 0.045 (Andrade
&amp;amp; Stone, 2009).  The higher S value defined by
Andrade &amp;amp; Stone (2009) was related to the narrower
limits for bulk density, macroporosity, total porosity
and the relationship between macro and micropores
for better plant growth assumed by these authors.

In the 0.275–0.325 m layer, the WRC observed under
triticale plus pearl millet (Figure 2c) characterized a

soil with poor structural quality, with the lowest S
value, 0.019 (Figure 3d).  Thus, it can be inferred that
with only one crop of pearl millet in succession to triticale,
i.e , a rotation involving only monocotyledonous
species, the cultivation effect on the soil structure was
limited to the first 0.20 m of the soil profile.

Treatment effects on the WRC were lower in the
0.475–0.525 m soil layer (Figure 2e) and the S values

were generally between 0.031 and 0.035,
characterizing a soil with poor structural quality
(Dexter, 2004).  However, the values were higher than
those determined in the previous year, by the time
the experiment began (S = 0.013), when the soil
structural quality was even worse.  This improvement
may be a result of the better soil management from
the beginning of the experiment.

After three years, ?s was lowest in the 0–0.05 m
layer with chiseling (Figure 4a).  This result may be
related to particle reorganization and consolidation,
occupying the porous space in the absence of root
systems, as argued by Calonego &amp;amp; Rosolem (2008),
based on data from this same experiment.  Leaving
the area fallow accelerates the compaction process
because the absence of plant residues on the surface

allows the rainfall to reach the soil with high energy.
This leads to soil de-structuring and breaking of
aggregates that migrate to the first millimeters below
the surface (1 and 5 mm), where they are inserted
into the porous space, forming a layer with high
penetration resistance (Schaefer et al., 2002).
Furthermore, the absence of roots increases soil
susceptibility to compaction because roots play an
important role in structuring processes by drawing
the particles closer when growing in pores and
releasing exudates that act as cement in the formation
of macroaggregates.  The effect of organic matter on
soil structure also affects water retention dynamics
since it plays an important role in the formation of
stable aggregates, reducing pore space obstruction and
increasing the proportion of macropores.

A decrease in water retention at medium and
high tensions was observed in the 0–0.05 m layer from
year 1 to the end of year 3, (Figures 2a and 4a),
suggesting a decrease in the proportion of small

pores, which are responsible for retaining water with
greater energy.  According to Reichardt &amp;amp; Timm
(2004) a gradual increase in tension results in the
draining of progressively smaller pores so that at
the higher tensions, only very small pores retain
water.

The decrease in water content at the highest tension
(15000 hPa) in the 0–0.05 m layer when cover crops
where grown (Figure 4a) is a clear evidence of soil
structuring and reduced soil compaction.  However,
there was no increase in the volume of plant-available
water (retained at matric potentials between -100 and
-15000 hPa) because there was also a decrease in the
water content retained at field capacity (-10 hPa).
This decrease resulted from an increase in the
macropore volume, reducing capillary water retention,
as similarly reported by Cavalieri et al. (2006).  The
effects of crop rotation and chiseling on soil organic
matter at this site reported by Calonego &amp;amp; Rosolem
(2008) in a previous paper were not significant, varying

less than 10 % among treatments, which is not high
enough to explain the results observed in this paper.

Thus, after three years of field experimentation it
can be inferred that growing cover crops in spring
resulted in a WRC indicating a better structured soil
in the 0–0.05 m layer, as a result of the cumulative
effect of the treatments on soil quality.  However,
effects of crop rotation on soil quality, increasing
soybean yield, can only be observed in the medium
and long term, as stated by Calonego &amp;amp; Rosolem
(2010).  These results were obtained without
considering the fall-winter crop, because S values were
greater in treatments including the spring crops
(Figure 5a), and the S value was highest (S = 0.08) in
triticale plus pearl millet.  Interestingly, greatest root
growth (pearl millet and soybean) was observed in
this soil layer, as discussed by Calonego &amp;amp; Rosolem
(2010).  Further comparisons of WRC showed that in

the first and third year, soil moisture at saturation
was increased by cover crops in the 0.075–0.125 m
layer (Figure 4b).  However, a residual effect of
chiseling was observed in the sunflower plus chiseling
treatment, since water retention was lower between -
60 and -1000 hPa, showing a reduction in the
proportion of micropores.

The treatments triticale plus pearl millet and
sunflower plus chiseling resulted in the best soil
structure in the 0.075–0.125 m layer, reflected by the
high S index (0.053 and 0.051, respectively)
(Figure 5b).  In contrast, S was only lower than 0.035
for triticale plus sorghum, i.e, poor structural quality,
as explained by Dexter (2004).

A residual effect of chiseling on the sunflower plus
chiseling treatment was also observed in the 0.15–
0.20 m layer (Figure 4c).  At this depth, triticale plus
sunn hemp reduced water retention in micropores and

the PWP.  Conversely, sorghum, especially in
succession to triticale, resulted in greater water
retention at medium and high tensions, indicating
greater soil compaction in this layer.  The highest S
index value in this layer (Figure 5c) was obtained
under triticale plus sunn hemp (S = 0.070), and the
lowest for triticale plus sorghum (S = 0.040).

There was lower water retention at tensions over
100 hPa with chiseling in the 0.275–0.325 m layer
(Figure 4d).  This shows a smaller volume of capillary
and hygroscopic water, suggesting that chiseling
effects persisted down to the maximum depth of action
of the equipment, even after three years, because these
results are typical of soils with a lower proportion of
micropores.  Triticale plus chiseling resulted in the
greatest S value, that is, S = 0.041 (Figure 5d).  The

greater effect of chiseling on loosening the soil profile
may be related to the low root colonization in these
layers, which reduces the effects of cover crops on soil
structure.  Furthermore, there is less reorganization
of soil particles in this layer since the loads applied to
the surface are dissipated in the first centimeters of
the profile, in addition to a lower intensity of the
wetting and drying cycles, indicating that the soil
remains moist for a longer time at this depth.

Great similarity was observed among water
retention curves in the 0.475–0.552 m layer
(Figure 4e) probably because the roots had little
influence and chisel plow shanks did not reach this
depth.  In this layer, the S values calculated ranged
from 0.020 to 0.035 (Figure 5e), which according to
Dexter (2004), indicate poor soil physical quality.

CONCLUSIONS

1. Crop rotation and chiseling improved soil
quality, increasing the S index to over 0.035, down to
a depth of 20 cm in the soil profile. However, the
greatest alterations in the soil physical quality were
observed in the 0–0.05 m layer and the lowest S values
were obtained in the treatments with chiseling and
without cover crops.

2. Cropping pearl millet in succession to triticale
improved the soil structural quality to a depth of
0.125 m from the very first year on, but sunn hemp
in succession to triticale improved the physical quality
at a greater depth (0.15 to 0.20 m) after three years.

3. The S values observed after three years did not
justify the use of chiseling since no-tillage cover crops
led to similar soil profile improvements.
