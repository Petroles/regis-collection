ABSTRACT

The Neoproterozoic shoshonitic and mildly alkaline bimodal volcanism of Southernmost Brazil is repre-

sented by rock assemblages associated to sedimentary successions, deposited in strike-slip basins formed

at the post-collisional stages of the Brasilian/Pan-African orogenic cycle. The best-preserved volcano-

sedimentary associations occur in the Camaquã and Campo Alegre Basins, respectively in the Sul-rio-

grandense and Catarinense Shields and are outside the main shear belts or overlying the unaffected base-

ment areas. These basins are characterized by alternation of volcanic cycles and siliciclastic sedimentation

developed dominantly on a continental setting under subaerial conditions. This volcanism and the coeval plu-

tonism evolved from high-K tholeiitic and calc-alkaline to shoshonitic and ended with a silica-saturated sodic

alkaline magmatism, and its evolution were developed during at least 60 Ma. The compositional variation

and evolution of post-collisional magmatism in southern Brazil are interpreted as the result mainly of melting

of a heterogeneous mantle source, which includes garnet-phlogopite-bearing peridotites, veined-peridotites

with abundant hydrated phases, such as amphibole, apatite and phlogopite, and eventually with the addition of

an asthenospheric component. The subduction-related metasomatic character of post-collisional magmatism

mantle sources in southern Brazil is put in evidence by Nb-negative anomalies and isotope features typical

of EM1 sources.

Key words: post-collisional, Neoproterozoic, volcanism, shoshonite, Na-alkaline.

Paleoproterozoic granulitic rocks of the Luiz Alves

Craton (Campo Alegre Basin) and diverse older ig-

neous and metamorphic terrains (Camaquã Basin)

(Fig. 1). These basins are related to the post-col-

lisional stages of the Brasiliano-Pan-African cycle

and are considered as strike-slip basins, although

there are controversies on their classifications and

mechanisms of generation (Almeida et al. 1981,

Brito Neves and Cordani 1991, Chemale Jr. 2000,

Gresse et al. 1996, Paim et al. 2000). The concept

of post-collisional setting assumed in this paper is

taken from Liégeois (1998) and Bonin (2004), as

the complex period which postdates the main col-

lision and can include large movements along tran-

scurrent shear belts, oblique collision, lithosphere

delamination, rifting, subduction of small tectonic

oceanic plates, and strike-slip basin volcanism and

sedimentation.

Important volcanic cycles have been iden-

tified mainly in the Camaquã and Campo Alegre

Basins. In the former three distinct cycles have

been identified (Wildner et al. 2002): (i) the older

volcanic rocks show shoshonitic affinity (Bom

Jardim Group, Hilario Formation), are dominantly

of intermediate composition, with some basic and

acidic occurrences; (ii) shoshonitic rocks are suc-

ceeded by a bimodal sodic mildly alkaline volcan-

ism (Cerro do Bugio Group, Acampamento Velho

Formation), represented mainly by acidic effusive/

explosive episodes and a minor basic pole; (iii) the

youngest volcanic rocks (Guaritas Group, Rodeio

Velho Member) are characterized by basic to inter-

mediate lava-flow deposits of sodic mildly alkaline

to high-K tholeiitic (Fig. 1a). In the Campo Alegre

Basin the volcanic sequence is bimodal, sodic, alka-

line and silica saturated, similar to that observed in

the Camaquã Basin (Fig. 1b).

Petrographic, geochemical and geochronolog-

ical data of Neoproterozoic volcanism in some of

the post-collisional basins of southernmost Brazil

are reviewed and discussed in this paper, in order

to re-evaluate the evolution of post-collisional mag-

matism and its probable sources.

THE CAMAQUÃ AND CAMPO ALEGRE BASINS

The Camaquã Basin shows an evolution charac-

terized by the alternation of depositional intervals,

with accumulation of thick sedimentary and vol-

cano sedimentary sequences and dominantly ero-

sive intervals. During the filling phase volcanic

deposits were formed, alternated with siliciclastic

sedimentation. The sedimentary sequence of the

Camaquã Basin represents an evolution from shal-

low marine to lacustrine-alluvial and desertic set-

tings in a typical continental environment (Paim et

al. 2000). Important volcanic cycles were devel-

oped in this basin (Fig. 1a). Intermediate effusive

deposits, associated to volcaniclastic sequences and

hypabissal bodies, constitute the Hilario Formation,

which presents shoshonitic affinity, and most of it

is included in the Lavras do Sul Shoshonitic Asso-

ciation (Lima and Nardi 1998). It is succeeded by

a bimodal volcanism – Acampamento Velho For-

mation – of silica-saturated-sodic-alkaline affinity,

dominated by an expressive acidic magmatism and

represented mainly by effusive and pyroclastic flow

deposits (Sommer et al. 2005, Wildner et al. 2002,

Almeida et al. 2002). The youngest unit – Rodeio

Velho Member – is constituted mainly by intermedi-

ate to basic lava flows, with transitional or tholeiitic

affinity (Almeida et al. 1997).

The Campo Alegre Basin situated in the north-

east portion of the Santa Catarina State (Fig. 1b),

presents a non-deformed and non-metamorphosed

volcano-sedimentary sequence and a large amount

of granitic intrusions. It lies on Archean granulite

terrains and its formation is probably related to

crustal relaxation due to lithospheric thickening

that occurred during the Brasiliano cycle (Basei et

al. 1992). The basin alternates deposition and ero-

sive episodes in a shallow marine setting, where the

sedimentary sequences were deposited and a sub-

aerial continental setting characterized mainly by

volcanic deposits. The volcanism in this basin is

represented only by one volcanic cycle, the Campo

Alegre Formation (Ebert 1971, Daitx and Carvalho

1980), situated in the intermediate portion of the

basin, and constituted by a bimodal volcanic se-

quence (Waichel et al. 2000).

THE SHOSHONITIC VOLCANISM

The shoshonitic rocks represent the oldest mag-

matic unit in the Camaquã Basin, and includes vol-

canic and plutonic rocks, which are intercalated with

volcanogenic conglomerates and sandy to muddy

deposits related to turbidity flows, that are predom-

inant in the top levels of this stratigraphic unit.

The effusive rocks are represented mostly by

potassic trachybasalts and trachyandesites (shosho-

nites) spatially and temporally associated with mon-

zonitic to quartz-monzonitic and lamprophyric hy-

pabissal rocks, epizonal granitoids and cummulatic

leucodiorites (Lima and Nardi 1998).

Basic volcanic rocks are mostly in the lower

stratigraphic levels, as lava flows or small shallow

intrusions. They are porphyritic olivine (Fo66?68)
basalts with augite (Wo39?43; En44?49; Fs9?15),
labradorite to andesine, and ilmenite, in a matrix

made of andesine to oligoclase, apatite and modi-

fied glass. Intermediate rocks are largely dominant

in the volcanic sequence. They show porphyrytic

and glomeroporphyrytic textures, abundant flow-

oriented labradorite-andesine phenocrysts, and mi-

nor amounts of augite (Wo38?43 En 40?49 Fs 8?20),
olivine (Fo62), Ti-magnetite and apatite, and a ma-

trix constituted by andesine-oligoclase crystallites

and microlites along with glass.

Subordinated subarerial pyroclastic fall and

flow deposits are characterized as lapilli lithic to

crystal tuffs and crystal rich ignimbrites, with pla-

gioclase, K-feldspar and quartz, involved by ash

matrix. Volcaniclastic breccias are common and

occur predominantly intercalated with trachyande-

sitic flows and fall tuffs.

Subvolcanic rocks are monzonites and quartz

monzonites and occur as small intrusions around

the Lavras Granite Complex. These rocks occur in

two different facies: a porphyritic one with phe-

nocrysts of plagioclase (oligoclase-andesine), K-

feldspar and amphibole (magnesium-hornblende),

joined by biotite in more acidic members, and

Ti-magnetite involved by a feldspar-rich ground-

mass, and an equigranular facies represented by

medium-grained rocks with a similar mineralogy.

These shallow intrusions are related to the latest

magmatic stages of the shoshonitic magmatism.

Cumulative leucodiorites occur as metric lenticular

bodies involving the monzonitic rocks. They show

equigranular texture, with strong flow orientation

of plagioclase laths, besides clinopyroxene, mag-

netite and apatite as cumulus crystals, and small

amounts of intercumulus material, mostly actinolite

and chlorite.

Lamprophyre dikes and a lava-dome of sho-

shonitic affinity cut the volcanic sequence. Dykes

are subvertical and generally 1 to 5 m wide, with

typical panidiomorphic and porphyrytic textures

characterized by abundant amphibole phenocrysts

sometimes associated with clinopyroxene, engulfed

by a feldspathic groundmass constituted mainly by

plagioclase. Based mainly on mineralogical and

textural evidence Lima and Nardi (1991) classified

them as spessartitic. Clinopyroxene compositions

vary from diopside to augite, and amphibole compo-

sitions vary from magnesiohastingsite to magnesio-

hornblende. Plagioclase composition ranges from

andesine to albite, with high Sr contents (2,000-

3,000 ppm).

Plutonic rocks include quartz monzodiorites,

quartz monzonites, monzogranites, granodiorites

and syenogranites, with diopside (Wo43 En40 Fs16),

augite (Wo26 En50 Fs24) and magnesium hornblende

in the less differentiated rocks evolving to ferro-

edenite and biotite in the acidic terms. Apatite, zir-

con, allanite, titanite, magnetite and ilmenite are the

most frequent accessory phases. Hydrothermal ac-

tivity is registered by secondary minerals, mainly

chlorite, epidote, sericite, and calcite, and gold-cop-

per-sulphide mineralization.

THE NA-ALKALINE BIMODAL VOLCANISM

The bimodal volcanism represents the extrusive

portion of the voluminous sodic, silica-saturated,

alkaline, granitic magmatism, mostly metalumi-

nous with minor peralkaline components (Nardi

and Bonin 1991). The volcanism occurred under

subaerial conditions and is exposed mainly in vol-

canic plateaus and ridges composed mostly of acidic

lavas and pyroclastic deposits with minor interme-

diate and basic components (Sommer et al. 2005,

Wildner et al. 2002, Almeida et al. 2002). Erup-

tive periods were generally initiated with explosive

episodes and closed by effusive events, which sug-

gests a decrease in volatile activity through the

progress of volcanic eruption, representing a com-

plete volcanic cycle.

Pyroclastic flows are the main volcaniclastic

deposits and are represented by ignimbrites of

comenditic affinity. The proximal and basal facies

are characterized by co-ignimbritic breccias, con-

stituted dominantly by juvenile, cognate and ac-

cidental blocks and lapilli in a tuffaceous matrix.

This facies shows lateral gradational changes to

ignimbrites with abundant lithoclasts and pumice

lapillis, besides K-feldspar and quartz phenoclasts,

separated in two main lithofacies: lenticulites and

crystal-rich deposits, both presenting K-feldspar

and quartz phenoclasts, pumice fragments and

scarce lithoclasts with lapilli-size, in an abundant

vitroclastic tuffaceous matrix. The pyroclastic flow

deposits show evidences of hot, gas-supported em-

placement, such as welding, high-temperature de-

vitrification processes (spherulites, axiolites), litho-

physae, perlitic fractures, gas-escape structures and

vapor-phase crystals, which suggest the deposition

from primary pyroclastic flows, generally restricted

to subaerial settings.

Basic-intermediate rocks are represented by

An Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)



NEOPROTEROZOIC POST-COLLISIONAL MAGMATISM IN SOUTH OF BRAZIL 577

dykes and lavas of hawaiitic and mugearitic com-

position. Dykes show a fine-grained phaneritic tex-

ture with plagioclase, clinopyroxene, ilmenite and

relicts of olivine, and lavas are porphyritic to glom-

eroporphyritic with plagioclase and pyroxene feno-

crysts in a matrix constituted by plagioclase and

pyroxene crystallites and microlites, and glass.

Labradorite (An44?67) is the commonest compo-
sition of plagioclase and clinopyroxene is augite

(Wo39?43,En38?48, Fs12?20) in the dykes and diop-
side (Wo48?49,En28?37, Fs14?23) in the lava flows.

Acidic lava flows and syn-volcanic intrusions

are represented mainly by comenditic rhyolites

and minor trachytes erupted through fracture

zones, where they exhibit a sub-vertical flow fo-

liation, gradating laterally to auto-breccias, lavas

with sub-horizontal flow foliation and massive bod-

ies. Acidic rocks consist of alkali feldspar, usually

microperthite, quartz, zircon, and iron oxides as ac-

cessory phases. They generally show porphyritic

to glomeroporphyritic textures, with low percent-

ages of phenocrysts set in a matrix constituted of a

mosaic of quartz and feldspar microlites and crys-

tallites. Mafic phases are scarce and occur as aci-

culate crystals of amphibole and as rare pyroxene

relicts partially replaced by amphibole and chlorite.

Amphibole in the acidic rocks presents the compo-

sitions of sodic-calcic phase – ferro-winchite, ferro-

barroisite and ferro-richterite, and a calcic one –

ferro-actinolite, which are frequently found in com-

enditic rocks (Strong and Taylor 1984). The microp-

erthitic alkalli feldspar has the composition Or84?98.
However there are scarce homogeneous grains with

a composition close to sanidine (Or41?47). Plagio-
clase has been transformed to albite (An0,5?3). Mi-
crophenocrysts of Ti-magnetite and ilmenite have

compositions similar to those described on peralka-

line rhyolites (Sutherland 1975).

GEOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION

THE SHOSHONITIC MAGMATISM

Basic-intermediate volcanic rocks plot in the tra-

chybasalt and basaltic trachyandesite fields of the

TAS diagram (Fig. 2a) and their potassic character

is indicated by K2O values greater than Na2O-2 (Ta-

ble I), which classify them as potassic trachybasalts

and shoshonites (Le Maitre 2002). They are gener-

ally silica saturated with normative olivine, hypers-

thene and diopside. According to Lima and Nardi

(1998) the Ni, Cr and Co contents in trachybasalts

from LSSA are lower than those typical of primary

magmas.

In the sliding normalization diagram proposed

by Liégeois et al. (1998), the rock association plot

in the shoshonitic field, characterized by high SNY

(=mean [Rb-U-Th-Ta]NYTS) values and low SNX

(=mean [Zr-Ce-Sm-Y-Yb]NYTS) values (Fig 2b).

Incompatible minor and trace elements show

very enriched LILE and LREE ocean island basalts

(OIB) normalized patterns (Fig. 3a), which are char-

acteristic of shoshonitic rocks. Nb is depleted rel-

ative to LREE, which is considered as typical of

magmas produced from sources modified by a pre-

vious subduction-related metasomatism (e.g. Kele-

men et al. 1993). Their low Nb/La and La/Ba ra-

tios are comparable to those reported for orogenic

andesites by Davies and Hawkesworth (1994). HFS

element contents are higher than in oceanic shoshon-

ites, and similar to those reported by Pearce (1983)

for those from continental margin. Y and Yb show

lower contents than OIB (Fig. 3a), which may be

ascribed to the presence of garnet in the residuum

of this magmatism or to equilibration of ascending-

slab melts with garnet peridotites as suggested by

Kelemen et al. (1993). Ce/Sm and Sm/Yb ratios, as

suggested by Davies and Hawkesworth (1994), also

point out to the presence of garnet as a residual phase

in the source of this magmatism. Chondrite normal-

ized REE patterns (Fig. 3b) are characterized by

CeN values close to 100, YbN about 4 and absence

of Eu anomalies; such features are also indicative

of shoshonitic or high-potassium calc-alkaline mag-

mas (Nardi and Lima 2000).

Intermediate and acidic terms keep the same

patterns of incompatible elements relative to OIB

(Fig. 3a). The regularity of REE patterns (Fig. 3b)

observed for basic, intermediate and acidic rocks

suggests their cogeneticity and consequently the

origin of acidic rocks through the differentiation of

basic and intermediate magmas.

Because several authors ascribe a significant

role to lower crust as the source or a significant con-

taminant to shoshonitic magmas, the LSSA rocks

were compared to the lower crust averages calcu-

lated by Wedepohl (1995), in order to evaluate its

petrogenetic involvement. The basic and intermedi-

ate terms show enriched patterns for most elements,

particularly for Ba, Sr and LREE, while Y and Yb

are depleted relative to lower crustal values. It seems

thus, that lower crust is not compositionally suit-

able as a source for shoshonitic magmas or even as

a contaminant capable of explaining the increase of

LILE or HFS element contents. Since plagioclase

is usually an abundant residual phase during crustal

melting, high Sr magmas are not expected, partic-

ularly if low-melt fractions are presumed. Granitic

rocks maintain approximately the same geochemi-

cal trends, with Sr contents too high to be produced

by crustal melting, whereas the enriched patterns for

incompatible LILE would be an evidence of small

melt fractions.

Granitic and rhyolitic rocks are metaluminous,

with typically high Ba and Sr contents and mod-

erate amounts of HFS elements (Table I, Fig. 3).

REE patterns and incompatible trace element sig-

natures show remarkable similarity with interme-

diate and basic shoshonitic rocks, suggesting their

co-geneticity.

Available isotopic data on whole-rock shosho-

nitic samples in the Lavras do Sul region (Gastal and

Lafon 1998) indicate Rb-Sr ages of 608 ± 54 Ma,
87Sr/86Sr initial ratio about 0.7048 and ?Nd values

close to –0.2, which are suggestive of EM1-type

lithospheric mantle sources (Nardi and Lima 2000).

Pb-Pb ages of zircons from monzonitic rocks indi-

cate ages of 601 ± 5 Ma (Gastal and Lafon 2001)
and U-Pb isotopic data in zircons point out an age of

592 ± 5 Ma (Remus et al. 1997) for granitic rocks
of this shoshonitic association.

THE SILICA-SATURATED, SODIC ALKALINE

BIMODAL MAGMATISM

The bimodal volcanism is characterized by a basic-

acidic rock association related to mildly alkaline

series, as displayed on TAS (Le Bas et al. 1986)

diagram, where the compositional trends are situ-

ated close to the limit between subalkaline and sil-

ica saturated alkaline fields (Fig. 2a; Table I). Rhy-

olites of comenditic affinity are predominant in the

volcanic sequence. Basic rocks are mostly hawai-

ites and basalts, whilst mugearitic terms are scarce.

The sodic character is indicated by (Na2O – 2) &gt;

K2O values, in spite of their high loss on ignition

(LOI) values. Two evolutionary trends with con-

trasting Ti-P contents were identified and referred

to as high- and low-Ti-P basalt-rhyolites (Sommer

et al. 2005) (Figs. 2c, 2d). A third compositional

group probably represents the last magmatism in the

Camaquã Basin, still related to the Brasiliano-Pan-

African post-collisional stage, which is referred to

as high-Nb rhyolites (Figs. 2c, 2d, 4b).

The alkaline affinity of this bimodal associa-

tion is observed in the sliding normalization scheme

of Liégeois et al. 1998, where most rocks plot in

the field characterized by high SNX-SNY values

(Fig. 2b).

The less differentiated rocks present relatively

high FeOt/MgO ratios usually observed in tholei-

itic series, which is corroborated by the behavior

of some incompatible elements as Nb, Zr and Y, as

displayed in Meschede’s (1986) diagram (Fig. 4a),

and by the Al2O3 contents, which are similar to

those of continental flood basalts of Paraná Basin

(Piccirillo et al. 1988).

Trace elements of basic rocks are similar to

those of ocean island basalt (OIB), except for the

lower Nb, Ta and P contents and higher Ba values

(Fig. 3c).

A roughly flat normalized REE pattern

is characteristic of the low-Ti-P basic rocks, with

a slight LREE enrichment relative to HREE, with

LaN/YbN ratios around 3, and absence of Eu ano-

maly (Fig. 3d). High-Ti-P types are REE enriched

when compared to low-Ti-P basalts, have higher

LREE/HREE ratios (LaN/YbN close to 10-11) and

slight negative-Eu anomalies.

The basic magmatism lies predominantly in

the within plate field in diagrams using incompatible

elements as observed in figure 4a. They show a tran-

sitional pattern when compared to OIB-normalized

patterns of within-plate tholeiitic and high-K basal-

tic magmas (Pearce 1982, Ewart 1982). This be-

havior is characteristics for basalts of transitional or

moderately alkaline affinity, usually related to con-

tinental rifts or post-collisional settings, as pointed

out by Leat et al. (1986).

The acidic rocks generally have SiO2 values

higher than 70 wt%, and are probably crystallized

from peralkaline liquids; however, due to loss of

alkaline elements during crystallization (Leat et al.

1986) show agpaitic index values close to 1 or even

lower. The originally peralkaline affinity of this

association is corroborated by Zr contents gener-

ally over 300 ppm (Table I). Volcanic rocks with

lower Zr contents – about 150 ppm – and low ag-

paitic index are less abundant and show character-

istics similar to those of subalkaline metaluminous

associations.

Assuming the primary peralkaline character of

rhyolitic magmas, their comenditic affinity is con-

firmed on the FeOt × Al2O3 diagram (MacDon-

ald 1974, Le Maitre 2002) (Fig. 4c). The high-Nb

comendites show more peralkaline compositions

than high and low-Ti acidic rocks, with higher Ta

contents, which are commonly referred to in pan-

telleritic associations (Hildreth 1981). The acidic

rocks have FeOt/(FeOt+MgO) ratios dominantly

higher than 0.9, which are typical of rhyolites as-

sociated to alkaline series (Ewart 1979, 1982).

Trace element patterns of rhyolites normalized

against the ORG values (Pearce et al. 1984.) are

displayed in the figure 3e, where rhyolites show

patterns similar to those found in within plate gra-

nitic rocks, particularly of attenuated continental

lithosphere. Their high Ce/Nb ratios are like those

found in post-orogenic magmatic associations, such

as Snowdon Rhyolites (Leat et al. 1986). The lower

Ce and Sm and, higher Rb and Ta contents, together

with the lower Ce/Nb ratios of high-Nb rhyolites

suggest that this magmatism is related to sources

with less influence of subduction-related metaso-

matism, like the Naivasha Rhyolites, Kenya (Mac-

Donald et al. 1987).

Chondrite-normalized REE patterns (Fig. 3f)

show a slight enrichment of REE in the high-Ti

rhyolites, particularly for LREE, with a LaN/YbN
ratio about 10-12. The high-Nb acidic rocks pres-

ent LaN/YbN ratio close to 1 or 2, larger negative

Eu anomalies and a strong LREE depletion in the

most differentiated liquids, which probably reflect

the presence of LREE-rich minerals, like allanite,

among the fractionated phases or a different source.

In the Y × Nb diagram (Fig. 4d), the sodic
alkaline rocks plot mainly in the field of post-

collisional magmatism, whilst high-Nb rocks oc-

cupy the field closer to that of within-plate associa-

tions. A similar behavior is observed in the Zr × Nb
diagram (Fig. 4e) where the rhyolitic rocks in gen-

eral present Zr/Nb ratios &gt; 10, which indicate that

this magmatism is related to sources modified by

subduction, such as those of post-collisional set-

tings. This kind of magmatic association has been

described in provinces such as Snowdonia, Avoca

and Parys Mountain, within the Southern British

Caledonides (Leat et al. 1986). The high-Nb rocks

show Zr/Nb ratios &amp;lt;10, which is usually related

to anorogenic settings as that of Naivasha volcanic

association, Kenya (MacDonald and Bailey 1973).

Isotopic data obtained from bimodal volcan-

ism supplied ages varying from 549 to 602 Ma. U-

Pb ages within this range were obtained in zircons

from different volcanic types (Siga Jr et al. 1995,

Cordani et al. 1999, Chemale Jr 2000, Sommer et

al. 2005).

FINAL CONSIDERATIONS

The Neoproterozoic shoshonitic and mildly alkaline

bimodal volcanism of Southernmost Brazil is repre-

sented by rock assemblages associated to volcano-

sedimentary successions, deposited in strike-slip

basins formed at the post-collisional stages of the

Brasilian/Pan-African orogenic cycle. The geotec-

tonic setting during this period in southern Brazil can

be envisaged as resultant from the collisional system

associated with the amalgamation of Rio de La Plata,

São Francisco, Congo, Kalahari and Paraná cratons,

as suggested by Brito Neves and Cordani (1991),

leading to the formation of Gondwana superconti-

nent. The influence of collisions related to the Pam-

pean Orogeny (Rapela et al. 1998) in the develop-

ment of Cambrian shear belts in southern Brazil can

not be discarded, particularly for late-transcurrent

events such as that related to the Caçapava Granite

Complex intrusion with age of 550 Ma (Nardi and

Bitencourt 1989). This long period of transcurrent

tectonics with associated strike-slip basin formation

and associated magmatism, related to the consolida-

tion of Gondwana supercontinent, explains the wide

time interval of Brasiliano post-collisional magma-

tism in southern Brazil (650–540 Ma).

The best-preserved volcano-sedimentary asso-

ciations occur in the Camaquã and Campo Alegre

Basins, respectively in the Sul-rio-grandense and

Catarinense Shields and are outside the main shear

belts or overlying the unaffected basement areas.

These basins are characterized by alternation of vol-

canic cycles and siliciclastic sedimentation devel-

oped dominantly on a continental setting under sub-

aerial conditions (Paim et al. 2000, Wildner et al.

2002), associated to coeval plutonism that evolved

from high-K tholeiitic and calc-alkaline to shosho-

nitic and ended with a silica-saturated sodic alkaline

magmatism. Ultrapotassic lamprophyres and silica-

saturated syenitic rocks coeval with the shoshonitic

magmatism were described by Stabel et al. (2001)

and Plá Cid et al. (2003).

The shoshonitic component is represented by

Hilário Volcanism in the Camaquã Basin, while the

alkaline signature is typical of the younger Acampa-

mento Velho and Campo Alegre volcanisms, respec-

tively in the Camaquã and Campo Alegre basins.

The available isotopic data indicate that sho-

shonitic Hilário volcanism occurred between 608

Ma and 592 ± 5 Ma and the bimodal mildly alka-
line magmatism of the Acampamento Velho and

Campo Alegre volcanism between 602 Ma and

549 Ma. These ages are coherent with those found

in the coeval extensional granitic plutonism, indicat-

ing that evolution of shoshonitic and mildly alkaline

bimodal magmatism was developed during at least

60 Ma.

Bimodal volcanism was carried out over Paleo-

proterozoic granulitic complexes or over metamor-

phic terrains with juvenile protoliths and in spite of

these basement differences, volcanic episodes and

facies architecture in the studied basins are similar,

with a predominance of acidic over basic magma-

tism and an less expressive occurrence of intermedi-

ate rocks, mainly trachytic lavas and small syenitic

plutons (Wildner et al. 2002, Waichel et al. 2000).

The bimodal magmatism according to mineralog-

ical, trace and major element data belongs to the

silica-saturated sodic alkaline series and shows high

FeOT/MgO ratios comparable to those of continental

flood basalts. Two magmatic sequences were iden-

tified and referred to as high-Ti-P basalts-rhyolites

and low-Ti-P basalts-rhyolites.

The compositional differences observed in the

high- and low-Ti-P groups are attributed to different

melt fractions from a dominantly lithospheric man-

tle, previously affected by subduction (Wildner et

al. 2002, Sommer et al. 2005).

The volcanic cycles investigated in Neopro-

terozoic basins of southernmost Brazil represent part

of evolutionary sequences that are typical of post-

collisional magmatism. This magmatism marks the

final stages of the post-collisional period and the

exhausting of mantle reservoirs hydrated and meta-

somatized by processes related to a previous sub-

duction. The latest volcanism, characterized by the

high-Nb rhyolites, probably represents an astheno-

spheric contribution and can be interpreted as result

of slab break-off and asthenospheric upwelling as

proposed by Atherton and Ghani (2002).

The post-collisional magmatism evolution

from high-K subalkaline to shoshonitic and eventu-

ally to sodic mildly alkaline observed in southern-

most Brazil (Nardi and Bonin 1991, Bitencourt and

Nardi 1993, 2000, Gastal and Lafon 1998, 2001,

Wildner et al. 2002, Waichel et al. 2000, Som-

mer et al. 2005, Nardi and Lima 2000) is referred

elsewhere as in Snowdonia and Parys Mountain as-

sociations in the British Caledonides (Leat et al.

1986), Devine Canyon Tuff – USA (Greene 1973)

and Miocene post-collisional volcanism of the East-

ern Rif in Morocco (El Bakkali et al. 1998). This

evolution is characterized by development of shear

belts associated to predominantly granitic magma-

tism and strike-slip basins where a typical and vo-

luminous volcanism and associated sedimentation

was developed and preserved, as envisaged by Bonin

(2004) for the evolution of the Alpine Belt since the

end of Variscan orogeny in Europe.

The post-collisional magmatism in southern

Brazil shows some particular features that should

be emphasized: (i) the last post-collisional mag-

matic events are sodic instead of potassic or ultra-

potassic and (ii) the early magmatic stages of mafic

magmatism are dominantly high-K tholeiitic instead

of calc-alkaline (ii) the ultrapotassic lamprophyre-

syenitic magmatism (611 Ma; Plá Cid et al. 2003)

is approximately coeval with the shoshonitic one.

The compositional variation and evolution of post-

collisional magmatism in southern Brazil is inter-

preted as result mainly of melting of a heterogeneous

mantle source, which includes garnet-phlogopite-

bearing peridotites, veined-peridotites with abun-

dant hydrated phases, such as amphibole, apatite

and phlogopite, and eventually with the addition

of an asthenospheric component. Crustal melts are

significative within the major post-collision shear

belts where peraluminous acidic rocks have been

described by several authors (e.g. Bitencourt and

Nardi 1993). The subduction-related metasomatic

character of post-collisional magmatism mantle

sources in southern Brazil is put in evidence by Nb-

negative anomalies and isotope features typical of

EM1 sources.

RESUMO

O vulcanismo neoproterozóico de afinidades shoshonítica

e alcalina sódica saturada em sílica, do sul do Brasil é

representado por uma sucessão de rochas vulcânicas, as-

sociadas com seqüências sedimentares que foram deposi-

tadas em bacias do tipo strike-slip, formadas nos está-

gios pós-colisionais do ciclo orogênico Brasiliano/Pan-

africano. As associações vulcano-sedimentares mais bem

representadas ocorrem nas bacias Camaquã e Campo Ale-

gre, respectivamente nos escudos Sul-rio-grandense e

Catarinense e situam-se fora das principais zonas de cisa-

lhamento ou sobrepondo áreas não afetadas do embasa-

mento. Estas bacias são caracterizadas pela alternância

de ciclos vulcânicos e sedimentação siliciclástica, desen-

volvidos dominantemente sob condições subaéreas em

ambientes continentais. O vulcanismo é associado com

plutonismo, cujo magmatismo evoluiu de afinidades to-

leítica e cálcio-alcalina alto-K, para shoshonítica e, final-

mente, alcalina sódica e saturada em sílica, durante, pelo

menos, 60 Ma. A variação composicional e a evolução do

magmatismo pós-colisional do sul do Brasil são interpre-

tadas como sendo, principalmente, resultado da fusão de

uma fonte mantélica heterogênea, que inclui peridotitos

ricos em granada e flogopita, peridotitos venulados com

abundância em fases hidratadas, tais como anfibólio, apa-

tita e flogopita e, eventualmente, contando com a adição

de um componente astenosférico. A característica metas-

somática relacionada a subducção das fontes mantélicas

deste magmatismo pós-colisional é evidenciada pelas

anomalias negativas de Nb e características isotópicas,

típicas de fontes do tipo EM1.
