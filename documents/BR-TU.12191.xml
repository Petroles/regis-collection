Resumo 
 

 

As ciências demonstraram que o que está em causa não é "salvar o planeta", mas sim 

assegurar a manutenção de um estado favorável do Sistema Terrestre para a humanidade. 

Isso significa que um planeta fora desse estado favorável, não serve como nossa "Casa 

Comum". A realidade é que nosso planeta não é apenas uma área geográfica com 510 

milhões de km2. Se todos os planetas possuem uma área geográfica, apenas a Terra possui 

um sistema intrinsecamente acoplado ao planeta físico, capaz de sustentar a vida tal como 

a conhecemos. Do ponto de vista jurídico, o planeta possui apenas uma existência como 

entidade territorial. Esta visão unidimensional exclui a expressão mais notável e vital da 

natureza - o funcionamento do Sistema da Terrestre como o “software” que suporta a 

vida. O Sistema Terrestre é um bem uno, global e intangível, que não encontra amparo 

na rigidez do atual ordenamento jurídico. O conhecimento científico já identificou os 

indicadores que determinam o estado deste Sistema, os chamados “Limites do Planeta”, 

que definem as balizas que não devemos transgredir para manter o Sistema da Terrestre 

dentro do Espaço de Operação Segura para a Humanidade. Este espaço qualitativo e 

quantitativo de segurança é intangível e não-territorial, e constitui o nosso verdadeiro 

Global Common existente no interior e além de todas as fronteiras. Do seu não 

reconhecimento pelo Direito Internacional, resulta a sua invisibilidade no seio da 

comunidade das nações e dos povos. A sua inexistência jurídica autoriza, pois, o seu uso 

desregulado e a consequente tragédia do nosso bem comum global, reduzido à categoria 

de “externalidade”. 

Já há muito que as ciências jurídicas reconheceram a existência de bens jurídicos 

intangíveis como solução para a proteção de determinados interesses ou bens que se 

tornaram relevantes para as sociedades humanas. O património cultural imaterial da 

UNESCO, o direito de autor, ou o valor intangível das empresas (onde frequentemente o 

valor dos ativos intangíveis é incomparavelmente superior ao valor dos bens tangíveis) 

são alguns exemplos.  

A analogia entre estes objetos de direito intangíveis e o Sistema de Terrestre, pode ser 

crucial não só para representar a funcionalidade global e indivisível do Sistema Terrestre 



 

na comunidade internacional, como para dar visibilidade económica ao valor real dos 

serviços intangíveis realizados pelos ecossistemas na manutenção dos ciclos 

biogeofísicos, cujo valor é incomparavelmente superior ao valor tangível dos 

ecossistemas naturais que os produzem.  

Uma parte significativa do desafio de “Transformar o Mundo” passa pela possibilidade 

de tornarmos o trabalho da biosfera visível na sociedade, nas ações humanas e nas 

transações económicas e financeiras. Atualmente o valor da natureza só se torna visível 

nas transações financeiras através da sua destruição e transformação em matérias-primas, 

como ocorre com a madeira das florestas.  

O objetivo é propor que o estado favorável do Sistema Terrestre característico do 

Período do Holoceno seja reconhecido Património Comum Intangível da Humanidade. O 

objetivo é o de promover este novo bem jurídico global como "plataforma de 

coordenação", onde todas as externalidades positivas e negativas possam ser agregadas e 

contabilizadas. Este novo objeto de governança global coexistirá com os regimes legais 

das soberanias estaduais: um Condomínio Planetário. O condomínio é o único modelo 

jurídico existente que não se limita a uma divisão dos elementos espaciais, mas reconhece 

igualmente a existência de elementos não- espaciais funcionais (ex: eletricidade, água) e 

que por isso é capaz de assegurar uma governação multi-level. 

Se utilizarmos diferentes de tipos de divisão jurídica (funcional e espacial) é possível 

a coexistência pacífica de dois regimes legais sobrepostos, mas articulados, no interior do 

mesmo espaço físico. Com a devida adaptação de escala a teoria que resulta desta solução 

poderia ter profundas implicações na organização jurídica das sociedades humanas nos 

dois horizontes que partilham - a Casa Comum da Humanidade: por um lado as 

jurisdições dos Estados (elementos territoriais) sobre o qual é possível aplicar convenções 

jurídicas de divisão, e por outro, de forma acoplada e sobreposta, a salvaguarda do 

Sistema Terrestre indivisível (elementos não-territoriais). 

O reconhecimento deste bem intangível que nos une a todos numa escala global é 

uma condição estrutural para tornar visíveis os fatores vitais que suportam a vida, e iniciar 

um processo em que a manutenção permanente da Casa Comum não constitui um prejuízo 

para quem realiza benefícios comuns. Esta é uma oportunidade para transformar as 

pessoas e nações em sujeitos de uma humanidade concreta e realizar a transformação 

civilizacional da passagem de uma comunidade de exploradores do Sistema Terrestre, 

para uma comunidade de curadores e gestores do uso da nossa Casa Comum.

Abstract 
 

Science has shown that what is at stake is not “saving the planet”, but rather ensuring 

the continued favourable state of the Earth System for humanity. That means that a planet 

beyond the favourable state cannot serve as our “Common Home”. The reality is that our 

planet is not only a geographical area of 510 million km2. All planets have a geographical 

area, but only Earth has a living system intrinsically coupled to the physical planet, able 

to sustain life just as we know it. From a legal point view, the planet only has an existence 

as a territorial entity. This one-dimensional vision excludes the most remarkable and vital 

expression of nature - the functioning of the Earth System as the software which supports 

life. The Earth System is a single, global and intangible asset, which finds no basis in the 

rigidity of the current legal framework. Scientific knowledge has already identified the 

indicators which determine the state of this System, the so-called “Planetary Boundaries”, 

which cannot be exceeded in order to ensure that the Earth System remains within the 

favourable state -  the Safe Operating Space for Humanity. This qualitative and 

quantitative safe space is intangible and non-territorial, and constitutes our real Global 

Commons, existing within and beyond all borders. Its lack of acknowledgement by 

International Law results in its invisibility within the community of nations and peoples. 

Therefore, its legal non-existence authorises its deregulated use and consequent tragedy 

for our global common asset, reduced to the category of “externality”. 

Legal sciences have long acknowledged the existence of intangible legal assets as a 

solution to protect certain interests or assets which became relevant to human societies. 

UNESCO’s intangible cultural heritage, copyrights, or the intangible value of companies 

(where the value of intangible assets is often exceptionally higher than that of tangible 

assets) are some examples.  

The analogy between these intangible objects of law and the Earth System may be 

crucial not only to represent the global and indivisible functionality of the Earth System 

in the bosom of the international community, but also to lend economic visibility to the 

real value of the intangible services provided by ecosystems and other features of the 

Earth System (e.g., atmospheric and oceanic circulation) in maintaining global 

biogeophysical and biogeochemical cycles, whose value is exceptionally higher than the 

tangible value of the component systems which produce them.  



 

A significant part of the challenge of “Transforming the World” entails the possibility 

of making the work of the Earth System visible in society, human actions, and economic 

and financial transactions. Nowadays, the value of nature only becomes visible in 

financial transactions through its destruction and transformation into raw materials, as 

happens with the timber of forests.  

The objective is to put forward a proposal so that the favourable state of the Earth 

System as a whole, which is represented by the current geological epoch, the Holocene, 

is recognised as Intangible Common Heritage of Humanity. The objective is to promote 

this new global legal asset as a “coordination platform”, where all positive and negative 

externalities can be aggregated and accounted for. This new object of global governance 

will coexist with the legal frameworks of state sovereignties: one Planetary 

Condominium. The condominium is the only existing legal model which is not limited 

to a division of spatial elements, but also recognises the existence of non-spatial 

functional elements (e.g.: electricity, water), and, for that reason, is able to ensure multi-

level governance aimed at maintaining the integrity of the building as an integrated whole. 

If we use different types of legal division (functional and spatial) it is possible to have 

the peaceful coexistence of two overlapping, but coordinated, legal frameworks within 

the same physical space. With the proper scale adjustment, the theory which results from 

this solution could have profound meaning in the legal organisation of human societies 

in the two horizons they share - the Common Home of Humanity: on the one hand, State 

jurisdictions (territorial elements) over which it is possible to apply legal conventions of 

division, and, on the other hand, coupled and overlapping, the safeguarding of the 

indivisible Earth System (non-territorial elements). 

The legal recognition of this intangible asset which unites us all at a global scale is 

a structural condition to lend visibility to the vital factors which sustain life, and to start 

a process in which the permanent maintenance of the Common Home will not be an 

economical loss to those who provide common benefits. This is an opportunity to 

transform peoples and nations into subjects of an actual humanity and to achieve 

civilizational transformation, from a community of Earth System exploiters to a 

community of Common Home curators and managers.

PARTE I 
 

INTRODUÇÃO 
 

 
 
1. Motivação e Justificação para o Tema 

 
 

Podemos afirmar que o período de estudos desta tese prolongou-se de forma continua 

desde 2006. No entanto o motivo seminal deste projeto de construção de uma arquitetura 

jurídica mais adequada ao funcionamento global do Sistema Terrestre teve origem ainda 

anteriormente. Em Novembro de 2002 o acidente do petroleiro Prestige na costa galega 

perto da fronteira portuguesa causou uma enorme maré negra, que se espalhou desde o 

norte de Portugal até Vendée em França. Até aqui, nada de realmente novo ou diferente 

relativamente a outras marés negras que infelizmente ocorreram já um pouco por todo 

mundo. O momento iniciador da construção de um novo conceito,  surge com a primeira 

reação das autoridades espanholas, quando tentam rebocar o petroleiro para as águas 

territoriais portuguesas, como se o petróleo passasse apenas a ser um problema português 

e não continuasse a espalhar-se dois lados da fronteira... Analisando os motivos que estão 

na origem desta disfuncionalidade jurídica entre a realidade ambiental e as construções 

sociais, que levam a confundir as representações humanas com a própria realidade, 

percebi que a origem primária desta disfunção se encontra no direito e que competirá em 

primeira linha às ciência jurídicas encontrar soluções de adaptação entre as formas de 

organização social e o funcionamento do planeta que habitamos e que pertencemos.  

Tendo participado nas ações de limpeza que à época se realizaram no norte de 

Portugal, voltando para casa depois de um longo dia de limpeza e reabilitação de aves 

oleadas, ao abrir a caixa do correio encontrei uma conta de milhares de euros para pagar, 

ao qual estava em anexo um orçamento relativo aos trabalhos de restauração no meu 

condomínio. 



 2 

Percebi então que a maioria desse montante era para o restauro de janelas que estão no 

espaço interior do apartamento dos meus vizinhos da frente. Completamente intrigado, 

comecei a estudar a estrutura legal de um condomínio. Quanto mais eu lia, mais se tornou 

evidente que as referidas janelas não pertenciam ao vizinho que possuía a fração onde as 

janelas estão localizadas, mas eram sim compropriedade de todos os meus vizinhos que 

habitam o condomínio. Todos nós tínhamos não só uma titularidade comum sobre aquela 

janela e vários outros elementos do prédio, bem como a correspondente responsabilidade 

compartilhada pela sua manutenção, uma vez que a inexistência de manutenção destes 

elementos se iria refletir na habitabilidade de todo o prédio. Ao estudar em detalhe a 

construção legal que cercava a minha vida diária, percebi que esta estava cheia de 

significados teóricos e possibilidades que questionavam tudo o que me havia sido 

ensinado na Universidade ... Depois de alguns anos a tentar desvendar a complexidade 

desse modelo, percebi que a solução ali presente, porque tinha surgido como resposta a 

uma necessidade da vida real, nunca tinha sido devidamente dissecada pela doutrina nos 

seus múltiplos significados e dimensões. Como tudo o que não tem explicação é 

complexo, a doutrina espanhola chamara-lhe mesmo propriedade complexa. Hoje cada 

vez tenho mais a certeza de que a ligação que fiz entre a mancha de petróleo que existia 

de forma sobreposta com a linha imaginária que separa as águas territoriais e janela 

comum no interior da casa do meu vizinho, foi o momento em que se colocava em causa 

o paradigma de divisão de sobre o qual se alicerçava a disfunção entre o Sistema Terrestre 

e as sociedades humanas, do qual são parte integrante.  

O processo de investigação começa ainda durante o ano de 2003, dando origem à 

publicação em 2007 do livro, “Condomínio da Terra – Das alterações climáticas a uma 

nova conceção Jurídica do Planeta”, publicado pela Livraria Almedina, Coimbra. Em 

2016 é publicado “SOS Treaty – Save Operating Space Treaty – A New Approach to 

Managing Our Use of the Earth System, pela Cambridge Scholars Publishing, em parceria 

com uma série de autores nacionais e estrangeiros, onde foram publicados de forma 

integral os capítulos 3,4,5 e 7 desta tese. Nesta linha de desenvolvimento do projeto, em 

Setembro de 2017 foi submetida uma proposta ao “Global Challenges Prize 2017: A New 

Shape – Remodelling Global Cooperation, que constitui o Capítulo 6 desta Tese. 

A linha de investigação pluridisciplinar realizada durante estes anos, embora tenha 

dado origem a profundas evoluções na utilização e conjugação de instrumentos e 

consequentemente nas soluções encontradas, não deixou nunca de ter como esqueleto 

base as possibilidades oferecidas pelo modelo do condomínio, que ao fim deste período 



 3 

julgo começar a ser desvendado na sua complexidade, e tornar-se simples e evidente o 

porquê da sua potencialidade. 

 

Percebemos então que: 

 

1) Num condomínio não existe apenas uma divisão do espaço. Existe igualmente uma 

divisão jurídica funcional relativa às funções essenciais:  a estrutura de estabilidade, os 

sistemas de uso comum (água, luz, elevadores...) e os elementos funcionais (escadas, 

telhado, coberturas), que estão sobre o regime de propriedade comum. Quer isto dizer que 

todos elementos que asseguram a habitabilidade e funcionalidade do prédio no seu todo, 

e sobre quais não é possível nenhuma operação jurídica de divisão, nem mesmo abstrata, 

são comuns. Só posteriormente a esta divisão funcional, é que se procedeu à divisão 

jurídica abstrata dos espaços que irão ser objeto de direitos de propriedade privada. 

 

2) Esta divisão funcional, tornava possível que no interior dos espaços sobre o regime de 

propriedade privada, existissem elementos e sistemas e que estavam sobre o regime 

jurídico de propriedade comum. Isto significa, que se utilizarmos diferentes de tipos de 

divisão jurídica (funcional e espacial) é possível assegurar a coexistência pacífica de dois 

regimes legais sobrepostos no interior do mesmo espaço físico. 

 

3) Se acompanharmos esta dupla divisão, por um sistema de contributos diferenciados e 

equitativos entre a cada um dos vizinhos, com o objetivo de assegurar a gestão 

permanente do mesmo prédio materialmente indivisível, é possível harmonizar, conciliar 

e tornar simbioticamente interdependentes os interesses individuais e comuns, 

tendencialmente opostos e conflituantes. 

 

4) Com a devida adaptação de escalas, a teoria que resulta desta solução poderia ter 

profundos significados na organização jurídica das sociedades humanas à escala do 

planeta - a Casa Comum da Humanidade: por um lado o planeta físico, geográfico e 

territorial sobre o qual é possível realizar abstrações jurídicas de divisão, e por outro, de 

forma acoplada e sobreposta, o Sistema Terrestre, uno e intangível, e sobre o qual não é 

possível realizar nenhuma divisão legal nem de forma abstrata.

5) Esta teoria, porque permite uma reconfiguração das relações que se estabelecem em 

torno da posse e uso de um mesmo bem, (em que a propriedade privada pode coexistir 

com a propriedade comum) permite-nos imaginar novas soluções para harmonizar as 

tensões entre o modelo económico que enaltece a divisão, a autonomia e a liberdade 

individuais, com a sempre necessária ação coletiva para assegurar a manutenção do bem 

comum global – Um Sistema Terrestre num estado favorável, e sobre o qual não é 

possível realizar nenhum tipo de divisão. Por outras palavras, o condomínio é um modelo 

de organização da interdependência, uma vez que só na prossecução do interesse comum, 

é possível assegurar o direito de cada um. 

Partindo desta linha de raciocínio, a matriz metodológica foi marcada por sucessivas 

etapas de aproximação estratégica a várias áreas do conhecimento, integrando as duas 

abordagens ideológicas dominantes, que foram até hoje consideradas opostas e 

antagónicas no que diz respeito à estratégia de gestão de bens comuns. Partindo das 

possibilidades abertas pelo modelo do condomínio, este projeto funcionou como uma 

plataforma de encontro de muitas soluções já encontradas. Como afirmam Almeida et.al., 

(2010.10) “A falência das macro narrativas ideológicas, que afirmavam a excecionalidade 

humana (Dunlap et al., 2002), desde o capitalismo ao comunismo, confronta-se com a 

emergência do discurso ecológico. Este discurso reabilita a urgência de uma solidariedade 

intergeracional e a íntima ligação entre a política e a economia, concorrendo para o 

encontro de soluções e de responsabilidades coletivas. Contudo, se as questões ambientais 

globais suscitam soluções globais, ou a concretização de um largo espectro de 

compromissos internacionais, a experiência humana da existência é essencialmente 

fenomenológica e associada às rotinas da vida quotidiana (Berger et al., 1985)”.  

A descoberta e definição Safe Operating Space of Humankind, como espaço 

biogeofísico relativo à estrutura de concentrações biogeoquímicas do Sistema Terrestre, 

e, portanto, como espaço qualitativo não geográfico, possibilita-nos esse salto para o 

global, essa ligação entre o local e global, entre economia e politica nas suas dimensões 

locais e globais. Requer igualmente uma reorientação da perceção do que foi entendido 

até hoje como “Casa Comum da Humanidade”: este espaço intangível, relativo às 

condições biogeofísicas que suportaram o desenvolvimento das sociedades humanas, não 

se refere ao planeta físico ou ao espaço geográfico/político, constituído pela soma das 

diferentes áreas sob jurisdição dos Estados e das áreas remanescentes. O conceito de Casa 

Comum tem subjacente as condições de habitabilidade da Casa na sua totalidade, que 

existem em simultâneo no interior e exterior de todas as soberanias. Neste sentido a Casa 



 5 

Comum da Humanidade não deverá ser entendida como o planeta geográfico de 510 

milhões de km2, mas antes deve ser representada através do favorable well-defined state 

do Sistema Terrestre, relativo ao período geológico do Holoceno. E é esta dimensão 

qualitativa que escapa à abordagem territorial. Em termos geográficos um oceano morto 

e acidificado pode continuar a ser objeto de divisões jurídicas entre soberanias, mas não 

pode servir como suporte da vida marinha e da humanidade no seu todo. Da mesma forma 

um planeta com um estado do Sistema Terrestre indesejável que não é capaz de suportar 

as necessidades ecológicas da espécie humana, também não pode ser considerado como 

nossa Casa Comum. 

Esta dimensão funcional e qualitativa, será então a linha mestra de toda esta 

investigação, que busca nos novos conhecimentos sobre o funcionamento do Sistema 

Terrestre, a base científica sobre a qual se vai aplicar o modelo do condomínio, recorrendo 

sempre a conceitos e institutos jurídicos já construídos, e adaptando-as a esta realidade.  

Por isso, para além das ciências do Sistema Terrestre, integram-se conceitos como 

Património da Humanidade, intangibilidade de objetos jurídicos, direito internacional, 

gestão de bens comuns, economia ecológica, valorização de serviços de ecossistemas, 

métricas e sistemas de contabilidade ecológica e o debate sobre os direitos das futuras 

gerações.  

Na essência iremos procurar construir um objeto de direito que proceda a uma leitura 

mais aproximada da realidade ambiental, propondo-se uma cobertura jurídica 

internacional ao Sistema Terrestre, tornando possível desta forma, distinguir a dimensão 

espacial do planeta (o hardware), do sistema funcional global (Software) que suporta a 

vida na Terra. 

Esta dimensão funcional e qualitativa do sistema terrestre pode ser determinante para 

se encontrarem os fundamentos sobre os quais se pode construir a Casa Comum que o 

Papa Francisco refere na sua Encíclica “Laudato Si”. No seu entender essa Casa Comum 

ainda “não está ainda construída”, quer isso dizer, que a nossa Casa Comum, não será o 

planeta físico ou geográfico, mas sim uma construção humana que potencie a construção 

simultânea de harmonia no interior das sociedades humanas e entre estas o Sistema 

Terrestre. La Cura Della Casa Comune, será então o cuidado na manutenção da estrutura 

de concentrações biogeoquímicas que determinam as condições favoráveis à família 

humana e a todas as espécies que partilham connosco as mesmas necessidades ecológicas. 

Cuidar da Casa, implica criar as condições estruturais prévias para uma ação coletiva 



 6 

global. Por isso a Casa Comum da Humanidade, será construção jurídica baseada na 

ciência. 

 

 

 2. Metodologia e Objetivos gerais e específicos 

a) Objetivos gerais   

 

Assumindo-se a ecologia humana como área de investigação transdisciplinar privilegiada 

para a análise das interações entre os sistemas sociais e sistemas ecológicos, e que nos 

pode proporcionar uma leitura abrangente das mudanças sociais e ambientais que 

resultam dessa interação, iremos proceder a um possível desenho de compatibilização das 

características do funcionamento do Sistema Terrestre com a organização política e social 

da comunidade global humana. Esta abordagem será, na sua essência, realizada através 

da procura de um novo objeto de direito que proceda a uma leitura mais aproximada da 

realidade funcional do Sistema Terrestre, isto é, na busca de elementos de conexão e 

coerência entre o sistema jurídico e o sistema ecológico, especialmente através do recurso 

às recentes descobertas desenvolvidas pelas ciências naturais e à utilização, por analogia, 

aos objetos jurídicos intangíveis e ao modelo do condomínio.  A abordagem escolhida é 

a de estudar e desenvolver a intangibilidade jurídica como eixo norteador capaz de 

traduzir e representar a essa qualidade intangível do bem ambiental global – o estado 

favorável do Sistema Terrestre. Sobre o assunto da intangibilidade jurídica César Garcia 

(2016.15) afirma: “Tamanha mudança somente se torna possível quando se deixa de 

pensar a realidade somente a partir do Direito, para permitir que o próprio Direito seja 

repensado a partir da realidade.” 

Ao desmaterializarmos a natureza através do reconhecimento de Património Comum 

Natural Intangível da Humanidade, ou para ser mais correto, ao aceitarmos que a natureza 

possui elementos não territoriais, poderemos distinguir o espaço soberano onde a 

infraestrutura natural está localizada, dos serviços e funções incorpóreas que presta no 

seio do sistema natural global, abrindo portas à valoração destes serviços imateriais.  

Esta será a base jurídica que permitirá a construção de um sistema de contabilidade 

dos diferentes contributos de cada agente para o sistema natural comum que suporta a 

vida na Terra, e a construção de uma economia onde os ativos intangíveis naturais devem 



 7 

ter um papel central, e que desta forma poderia resultar numa harmonização entre os 

fluxos económicos e os fluxos ecológicos. 

A proposta de pensar a terra como um imenso condomínio, tem como objetivo central 

aproveitar uma ferramenta jurídica já amplamente testada de sobreposição de dois 

regimes legais distintos no interior do mesmo espaço, conciliando desta forma interesses 

individuais e coletivos, fornecendo assim uma base jurídica global que com potencial 

para enquadrar e contextualizar globalmente os interesses individualizados de cada um 

dos Estados com os interesses superiores de toda a Humanidade.  

Esses interesses superiores existem, independentemente de não ser possível identificar 

os sujeitos de direito em relações futuras e incertas. Podemos não identificar em concreto 

os sujeitos, mas sabemos que algumas condições básicas vitais de habitabilidade do 

planeta são necessárias pelo simples facto de virem a ser seres humanos. Na certeza de 

que as gerações futuras possuirão existência em determinado momento histórico, e que 

os direitos humanos não estão ligados a um individuo em particular, mas uma humanidade 

que se alarga para lá da existência individual no espaço e no tempo, propomos representar 

estes interesses através de um património comum natural intangível. Esse será o legado 

da transmissão da Casa Comum, de geração em geração. 

 

 

b) Objetivos específicos 

 

1 – Demonstrar que a gestão do uso do Sistema Terrestre implica a organização de uma 

fruição coletiva à escala global, e que através do modelo do condomínio é possível 

compatibilizar um regime de soberanias territoriais independentes, com a gestão comum 

dos elementos não territoriais.  

2- Demonstrar, que tal como noutras áreas em que o direito se viu obrigado a reconhecer 

juridicamente a existência de bens intangíveis para poder cumprir a sua função 

harmonizadora de relações, é chegado o tempo de o direito reconhecer a existência de um 

bem jurídico intangível global relativo à natureza, como plataforma a partir da qual deve 

montar um esquema regulador das relações entre indivíduos, Estados e comunidades, 

numa escala global.  

 



 8 

3 – Para tal, o direito deve recorrer às últimas evoluções da Ciências do Sistema Terrestre, 

e com base no Safe Operating Space of Humankind, construir um objeto de representação 

intelectual relativamente a uma realidade natural, como bem jurídico intangível que existe 

no interior e exterior de todos os Estados, como pressuposto estrutural da construção de 

uma sociedade sustentável. 

 

4 – Entre os instrumentos jurídicos existentes, aquele que melhor se adequa às 

características do “bem ambiental global” é o Património Comum da Humanidade. Neste 

sentido iremos propor uma evolução do Common Concern of Humankind para o 

reconhecimento do estado favorável do Sistema Terrestre como Património Natural 

Intangível da Humanidade, definindo dessa forma um bem jurídico global autónomo. 

 

5- Usar o novo património natural intangível, como o “território virtual” em torno do qual 

a comunidade humana global se organiza, e onde os interesses das gerações futuras 

poderão estar representados.  

 

6- Usar este novo património intangível como instrumento legal para internalizar as 

chamadas “externalidades económicas”, positivas e negativas. 

 

7- Com base nesta internalização, tornar possível a visibilidade económica destes fatores 

vitais, conectando desta forma os ciclos biogeofísicos com os ciclos económicos. 

 

8 – Com base no novo Património Comum, promover a reativação do Conselho de Tutela 

da Nações Unidas, cujo novo mandato teria como objetivo principal a manutenção do 

espaço de segurança da Humanidade.

Capítulo I 
 
 

 Ecologia Humana – A Ciência do Conhecimento  

 

“Pensar de uma maneira inovadora para poder inovar a própria realidade" 
Viriato Soromenho-Marques (1994:26). 

 

 

1.1. Introdução   

A natureza, sabemo-lo hoje, é não-linear, e como tal traz consigo a ideia de 

multiplicidade, abertura, adaptabilidade, irreversibilidade e complexidade (Brown 1994 

:420). 

Nas primeiras palavras do prefácio da “Introdução ao Pensamento Complexo” Morin 

introduz-nos um pensamento que não abandonamos mais sempre nos confrontamos 

com a palavra complexo: “Pedimos legitimamente ao pensamento que dissipe as brumas 

e as obscuridades, que ponha ordem e clareza no real, que revele as leis que o governam. 

A palavra complexidade só pode exprimir o nosso embaraço, a nossa confusão, a nossa 

incapacidade de definir de maneira simples, de nomear de maneira clara, de pôr ordem 

nas nossas ideias”. Mais à frente afirma: “A palavra complexidade é uma palavra 

problema, não uma palavra solução” (Morin1990: 7). 

Na época em que estas palavras foram escritas, os conhecimentos sobre as instruções 

operacionais intangíveis que determinam a forma como o sistema terrestre se auto-

organiza e regula eram praticamente nulos e sua existência, ainda que num plano 

meramente teórico e conceptual, suscitava autênticos coros de rejeição. A hipótese de 

Gaia – em que James Lovelock (1991) formula pela primeira vez a possibilidade de o 



 10 

Planeta Terra funcionar como um sistema vivo que se auto-regula, foi considerada pela 

Revista Science de 19 de Abril de 1991, uma teoria “anticientífica”, “perigosa”, “pura 

fantasia”.  

Hoje, depois de desvendados os core drivers que determinam o funcionamento do 

Sistema Terrestre, os cientistas do sistema global - os Earth System Scientists - continuam 

a defini-lo como um sistema altamente complexo, por duas ordens de razões: a) por lado 

existem ainda muitas interconexões desconhecidas, b) por outro, relativamente às 

interconexões já conhecidas, os efeitos cascata originados pela introdução de alterações 

nos seus componentes, que não podem ser analisados num modelo simples de causa-

efeito, resultam em efeitos emergentes não conhecidos. Neste nível nenhum fator atua de 

forma isolada, antes pelo contrário, é um sistema onde "tudo depende de tudo" e onde 

“tudo implica com tudo”. Esta tautologia tem na escala global o seu campo perfeito de 

aplicação.  

Mas se para chegar a esta consciência da complexidade e de que "tudo depende de 

tudo", que só agora começa a ser reconhecidamente aceite, teve de se percorrer um "longo 

caminho onde apareceriam em primeiro lugar os limites, as insuficiências e as carências 

do pensamento simplificador, depois as condições nas quais não podemos evitar o desafio 

complexo" (Morin1990:8). Na esteira do pensamento disjuntor cartesiano, construímos 

uma estrutura de organização das sociedades humanas baseada no paradigma no 

conhecimento segmentado, limitativo e isolador de cada área do saber, e que separa e 

oculta tudo o que liga, interage, interconecta, tornando impercetível o erro e as falhas das 

interligações. “Infelizmente, a visão mutiladora e unidimensional paga-se cruelmente nos 

fenómenos humanos: a mutilação corta a carne, deita sangue, espalha sofrimento. A 

incapacidade de conceber a complexidade da realidade antroposocial na sua micro-

dimensão (o ser individual) e na sua macrodimensão (o conjunto planetário da 

Humanidade) conduziu a infinitas tragédias e conduz-nos à tragédia suprema” (Morin 

1990:19). 

O “império dos princípios de disjunção, de redução e de abstração”, cujo conjunto 

Morin chama de “paradigma de simplificação” isolou radicalmente, na opinião de Morin, 

cada um dos três grandes campos do conhecimento científico, relativamente a cada um 

dos outros - a física, a biologia, as ciências do homem. 

Com Hobbes, o paradigma cartesiano invade também o direito e este torna-se numa 

arte de estabelecer limites, de fazer a separação das coisas, de desenhar fronteiras 

abstratas, naturalmente ocultando a realidade então desconhecida do Sistema terrestre, 



 11 

que existe para além da dimensão territorial do planeta e cuja única escala de 

funcionamento é a global. É igualmente sob a visão ainda dominante do paradigma da 

divisão, que emerge um modelo económico que defende que só o regime de propriedade 

privada em associação aos mecanismos de mercado está apto a ultrapassar a inevitável 

“Tragédia dos Bens Comuns” (Hardin 1968), uma vez que nesta linha de raciocínio 

apenas as pessoas com propriedade privada seriam motivadas a proteger suas terras do 

uso desregulado. A todos os níveis os sistemas de conhecimento e de organização social 

foram formatados para definir limites e não partes comuns. A formatação social daqui 

resultante pode-se resumir desta forma: a) tudo o que interliga e ultrapassa fronteiras é 

socialmente invisível; b) pensar global é uma quimera desconectada da realidade social; 

c) representar socialmente o global, uma impossibilidade técnica e categórica.  

Nesta linha de pensamento compreende-se que ainda hoje o que é o comum seja 

apenas o remanescente das divisões operadas pelas soberanias ou pela propriedade 

privada. 

As falhas estruturais resultantes desta ausência de interconexões no próprio sistema 

de conhecimento e do sistema e organização social, deram origem a um processo interno 

de erosão, como sequência lógica da incapacidade destes sistemas em explicarem 

adequadamente a realidade natural e social. O resultado foi o alargamento da “fatalidade” 

da lógica da “Tragédia do Comuns” a uma realidade oculta e “externa” - a escala global. 

As alterações climáticas, como fenómeno mais visível de toda a ameaça ao estado do 

Sistema Terrestre, são uma Tragédia dos Comuns à escala global – a disrupção dos 

mecanismos de suporte da vida - a Tragédia Suprema, nas palavras de Morin.  

No plano jurídico, como plano estrutural da organização das sociedades humanas, esta 

territorial obsession (Taylor 2016:120), tem como expressão máxima a abstração jurídica 

de considerar o planeta apenas num plano unidimensional, onde este corresponde a uma 

área total de 510.000.000 de km2 que foi dividida entre as soberanias e onde os Global 

Commons são apenas os remanescentes destas divisões. Este continua a ser o modelo 

único que determina o ponto a partir do qual todas as realidades são analisadas.  

Como afirma Soromenho-Marques (1994:17) “O homem age antes de saber”. Mas 

quer queiramos ou não, foi esta separação/organização/isolamento que possibilitou 

alcançar uma espantosa rede de informações sobre o mundo, que nos permite agora, quase 

como observadores externos, questionar todo o caminho já realizado.  

Na posse de tantas informações parcelares, podemos agora ambicionar passar da 

informação ao conhecimento do todo e, dar um passo decisivo no percurso civilizacional 



 12 

da humanidade. Para isso, é necessária uma operação, uma conexão entre a complexidade 

objetiva da natureza e a nossa capacidade subjetiva de a representar no nosso sistema 

social.  

É nesta conjuntura que surge a Ecologia Humana, que como próprio nome indica, 

pretende ser um espaço de conhecimento onde as informações provindas de todas as 

ciências, naturais ou humanas, se encontram e de alguma forma formarão um 

conhecimento global e integrado.  

Mas como é evidente, um projeto de construir uma ciência unificadora, num contexto 

social profundamente enraizado em conhecimento espartilhado, não é tarefa fácil. 

Embora seja hoje recorrente a utilização das palavras inter, trans ou multidisciplinaridade, 

a utilização de palavras por si só não significa que esse conhecimento integrado seja uma 

realidade. Em muitos casos, o exercício de nomeação destas palavras corresponde apenas 

a uma proclamação da necessidade de encontrar uma ideia para um problema ainda não 

resolvido, como metodologia que incentive ao diálogo entre pessoas que foram formadas 

em diferentes silos, mas que muitas vezes são incapazes de correr o risco de sair da sua 

área de especialização, da sua zona de segurança e criar um conhecimento 

verdadeiramente integrado. A inter, trans ou multidisciplinaridade nasceram como quase-

conceitos, em que a sua validade atual se encontra como um inegável e necessário projeto 

futuro ainda não realizado. 

No entanto, este dever-ser futuro confronta-se ainda hoje com problemas de afirmação 

relativamente às teias das compartimentações dos saberes estabelecidos, onde o 

“transdisciplinar” não encaixa nos modelos de validação e delimitação existentes. Como 

Iva Pires refere, a Ecologia Humana é uma ciência altamente especializada mantendo, ao 

mesmo tempo, uma visão holística, abrangente e transdisciplinar, condição que a torna 

complexa e mesmo difícil de ser definida (Pires 2011). 

Neste caminho de afirmação para Mcharg (1984: 53) “O principal desafio que se 

coloca à ecologia humana é da capacidade de síntese dos processos físicos, biológicos, 

sociais, económicos e culturais para compreender as pessoas os lugares, observar as 

relações sistémicas e comentá-las”. Quando o projeto em causa tem como objetivo 

interconectar as informações e transformá-las em conhecimento, parece-nos que não 

poderemos fazer depender a sua validação do cabal preenchimento do princípios 

estruturais formais das metodologias científicas herdadas do paradigma da disjunção - 

onde se constatou que “os modos simplificadores do conhecimento mutilam mais do que 



 13 

exprimem as realidades ou fenómenos que relatam, e se torna evidente que produzem 

mais confusão que esclarecimento...”(Morin 1990:7). 

Mas o processo de transformação da informação em conhecimento é um longo 

percurso, que por ser inevitável, começou já a ser feito parcelarmente em várias áreas 

científicas, entre quais, a que consideramos mais evoluída e de maior relevância, será a 

das ciências naturais – as chamadas ciências do Sistema Terrestre - onde a biologia não 

está separada da química, matemática, geologia, paleontologia, climatologia ou da física. 

Os ciclos biogeofísicos globais, pela sua própria formulação, são um sinal evidente da 

unificação dos saberes na única e verdadeira escala em que podemos transformar 

informação em conhecimento – a escala global. Esta evolução inevitável para entender e 

representar o “todo global”, está ainda longe de possuir uma lógica consistente à escala 

das ciências humanas. 

 

 

1.2. Da Terra Incognita às Ciências do Sistema Terrestre 

 

Com a visão do Príncipe Infante D. Henrique foi possível iniciar o processo de 

transformar a Terra incognita (termo utilizado na cartografia dos séculos XV/XVI para 

assinalar as regiões nunca mapeadas ou documentadas) em Terra conhecida. Esta epopeia 

de descoberta culmina de alguma forma com a viagem de Fernão de Magalhães, onde 

pela primeira vez na história se pôde voltar ao ponto de origem sem voltar para trás, e se 

percebeu a forma e os limites físicos da nossa Casa Comum. Sabemos hoje, que este passo 

de gigante na história da perceção que a espécie humana tem do planeta que habita, era 

apenas ao nível do espaço geográfico. 

Depois das “Terra Incognitas” terem desaparecido dos nossos mapas, tivemos que 

esperar até à segunda metade do Século XX para perceber que para além do planeta na 

sua dimensão geográfica, física e palpável, existia um sistema funcional global, cujo o 

modo de funcionamento estava ainda por descobrir. Quando Lovelock percebeu, nos 

finais dos anos 60 do Séc. XX que os CFC’s emitidos para a atmosfera não desapareciam 

no espaço infinito e acumulavam-se nos polos, uma nova realidade se revelou. De passo 

em passo a ciência foi desvendando o nível superior de integração do Sistema Terrestre, 

de interconexões globais de difícil definição.  



 14 

Com o desenvolvimento exponencial das ciências do Sistema Terrestre ocorrido nos 

últimos 25 anos e a evolução das observações da Terra realizadas a partir do espaço, o 

sistema incrivelmente complexo do planeta que habitamos transformou-se numa 

realidade que podemos observar em tempo real, como espectadores externos.  

Ao juntarmos a informação obtida partir do espaço com a informação recolhida a 

partir do solo e do gelo (por exemplo a paleontologia do clima), tornou-se possível 

reconstruir a história da atmosfera e todo o Sistema Terrestre. Ao longo da história do 

nosso planeta, foram muitas as diferentes estruturas de composições químicas da 

atmosfera e dos oceanos, que deram origem a diferentes balanços energéticos e 

equilíbrios termodinâmicos, que por sua vez resultaram em diferentes estados do Sistema 

Terrestre. O acesso a esta informação permitiu-nos a compreender a verdadeira situação 

única que caracterizou o período de estabilidade climática dos últimos 11.700 anos no 

Planeta Terra, o chamado o período geológico do Holoceno. 

Se é a partir de Portugal que saem muitas das naus nas viagens oceânicas dos 

séculos XV e XVI que iniciam o processo de reconhecimento do espaço geográfico global 

da nossa Casa Comum, não deixa de ser interessante o facto de a unificação das ciências 

naturais, e o consequente processo de decifração do funcionamento do sistema terrestre, 

ter ligações com Portugal, como afirma Will Steffen, Executive-Director do IGBP 

(International Geosphere-Biospehere Program) e editor principal do “Global Change and 

the Earth System” de 2004 (considerado ainda hoje o estudo mais abrangente sobre o 

Sistema Terrestre) : “In fact, this rapidly emerging knowledge of the Earth as a single, 

integrated system also has some interesting connections to Portugal. One the first 

conceptualization in the contemporary era of the Earth as a system was by James 

Lovelock, who used the name “Gaia” (name of the Greek Goddess of Earth) for the Earth 

System. This, of course, is the name of the city that sits across the Douro River from Porto, 

and the combination of the twin cities Porto and Gaia formed the basis for the name of 

the country as Portugal. 

Arguably the most influential international scientific body in the development of the 

concept of the Earth System has been the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme 

(IGBP). Interestingly, the most critical meeting of the IGBP Scientific Meeting was held 

in 1999 in Estoril, Portugal1. There the Committee determined the objective, scope and 

work plan for the production of the IGBP synthesis project, which resulted in the book 

                                                
1http://www.igbp.net/download/18.950c2fa1495db7081e131/1416232597277/NL_371999.pdf 



 15 

“Global Change and the Earth System: A Planet Under Pressure”, still one of the best 

syntheses of Earth System science. The Estoril meeting also initiated the planning for the 

2001 Amsterdam Conference, which was the world’s largest global change scientific 

conference up to that time. 

The Estoril meeting also featured an explicit link to Ferdinand Magellan and the age 

of Portuguese exploration. The IGBP Scientific Committee visited the Portuguese 

Academy of Sciences in Lisbon, where the scientists had the fortune to see the original 

navigational maps of Ferdinand Magellan, where for the first time the islands of Japan 

appear on a map in the western world. 

Inspired by this link to the great age of global exploration, the IGBP Chairman Berrien 

Moore III, as he looked out over the Atlantic Ocean from the conference room in Estoril, 

challenged the IGBP scientific community to go out on their own voyage of scientific 

exploration to understand our home planet as a single system – our own life support 

system.  

So, from the perspective of Earth System science, it would be truly fitting for the 

Common Home of Humankind to be located in Portugal, and in Porto in particular”  

Como referido, esta 14ªª reunião Scientific Commitee do IGBP que decorreu entre os 

dias 23 a 27 de Fevereiro de 1999 no Estoril, esteve na origem da evolução do conceito 

avançado por Lovelock, que viria a resultar numa abordagem integrada e pluridisciplinar 

no âmbito das ciências naturais ao Sistema Terrestre como um único todo. Esta evolução 

resultou na prática num processo gradual de unificação das ciências naturais – que estão 

na base e origem das chamadas Ciências dos Sistema Terrestre.  

Na sequencia da reunião do Estoril, e numa parceria do IGBP e de outros programas 

internacionais de mudança global, ficou decidida a realização de uma grande conferência 

em Amsterdão em 2001, que marcou em definitivo a formalização desta unificação 

científica. A conferência produziu a histórica Declaração de Amsterdão sobre Ciência do 

Sistema da Terrestre, que reproduzimos aqui:

The Declaration2 
 
The scientific communities of four international global change research programs - the 

International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), the International Human Dimensions 

Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP), the World Climate Research Programme 

(WCRP) and the international biodiversity programme DIVERSITAS - recognise that, in addition 

to the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever-increasing 

human modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent 

implications for human well-being.  

 

Basic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, 

clean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by 

global change. 

Research carried out over the past decade under the auspices of the four programmes to 

address these concerns has shown that: 

 

• The Earth System behaves as a single, self-regulating system comprised of physical, 
chemical, biological and human components. The interactions and feedbacks between 

the component parts are complex and exhibit multi-scale temporal and spatial 

variability. The understanding of the natural dynamics of the Earth System has 

advanced greatly in recent years and provides a sound basis for evaluating the effects 

and consequences of human-driven change. 

• Human activities are significantly influencing Earth's environment in many ways in 
addition to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Anthropogenic changes to 

Earth's land surface, oceans, coasts and atmosphere and to biological diversity, the 

water cycle and biogeochemical cycles are clearly identifiable beyond natural 

variability. They are equal to some of the great forces of nature in their extent and 

impact. Many are accelerating. Global change is real and is happening now. 

• Global change cannot be understood in terms of a simple cause-effect paradigm. 
Human-driven changes cause multiple effects that cascade through the Earth System 

in complex ways. These effects interact with each other and with local- and regional-

scale changes in multidimensional patterns that are difficult to understand and even 

more difficult to predict. Surprises abound. 

• Earth System dynamics are characterised by critical thresholds and abrupt changes. 
Human activities could inadvertently trigger such changes with severe consequences 

for Earth's environment and inhabitants. The Earth System has operated in different 

states over the last half million years, with abrupt transitions (a decade or less) 

sometimes occurring between them. Human activities have the potential to switch the 

Earth System to alternative modes of operation that may prove irreversible and less

 17 

hospitable to humans and other life. The probability of a human-driven abrupt change 

in Earth's environment has yet to be quantified but is not negligible. 

• In terms of some key environmental parameters, the Earth System has moved well 
outside the range of the natural variability exhibited over the last half million 

years at least. The nature of changes now occurring simultaneously in the Earth 

System, their magnitudes and rates of change are unprecedented. The Earth is 

currently operating in a no-analogue state. 

 

On this basis, the international global change programmes urge governments, public and 

private institutions and people of the world to agree that: 

 

• An ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System 
management are urgently needed.  The accelerating human transformation of the 

Earth's environment is not sustainable. Therefore, the business-as-usual way of 

dealing with the Earth System is not an option. It has to be replaced ¬ as soon as 

possible ¬ by deliberate strategies of good management that sustain the Earth's 

environment while meeting social and economic development objectives. 

• A new system of global environmental science is required. This is beginning to evolve 
from complementary approaches of the international global change research 

programmes and needs strengthening and further development. It will draw strongly 

on the existing and expanding disciplinary base of global change science; integrate 

across disciplines, environment and development issues and the natural and social 

sciences; collaborate across national boundaries on the basis of shared and secure 

infrastructure; intensify efforts to enable the full involvement of developing country 

scientists; and employ the complementary strengths of nations and regions to build 

an efficient international system of global environmental science. 

 

The global change programmes are committed to working closely with other sectors of society 

and across all nations and cultures to meet the challenge of a changing Earth. New partnerships 

are forming among university, industrial and governmental research institutions. Dialogues 

are increasing between the scientific community and policymakers at a number of levels. 

Action is required to formalise, consolidate and strengthen the initiatives being developed. The 

common goal must be to develop the essential knowledge base needed to respond effectively 

and quickly to the great challenge of global change. 

 

A consequência imediata deste marco histórico foi o recente desenvolvimento 

exponencial das Ciências do Sistema Terrestre com a sua abordagem interdisciplinar e 

global, proporcionando-nos informações sobre a natureza e os limites da Época do 



 18 

Holoceno, como o único estado do Sistema da Terra que possui, com certeza, as 

condições ecológicas necessárias para suportar sociedades humanas complexas e 

contemporâneas.  

Com esta nova abordagem global das ciências naturais, ficou claramente demonstrado 

que o grande desafio ambiental será o de manter um estado relativamente estável e 

favorável do Sistema Terrestre.

Esta afirmação significa também que um Planeta com um Sistema Terrestre fora desse 

estado favorável, não serve como nossa “Casa Comum”, o que tem como consequência 

imediata a desterritorialização do bem ambiental e a assunção da escala que vai 

determinar todos os processos locais: a escala global. 

A comunidade científica tentou responder ao desafio de entender e medir este espaço 

qualitativo e quantitativo, não-territorial, intangível e funcional, desenvolvendo o 



 19 

conceito das Planetary Boundaries – os limites do planeta (Planetary Boundaries) 

(Steffen et al., 2015, Rockström et al., 2009). Esses limites são baseados nas propriedades 

intrínsecas do próprio sistema terrestre e que se definem através de uma combinação de 

indicadores (core drivers) que no seu conjunto são as instruções operacionais intangíveis 

que determinam o modo como o Sistema Terrestre se auto-organiza e regula. Por outras 

palavras, este conjunto de indicadores será o “código genético” do funcionamento do 

sistema terrestre que traduz em números as intuições iniciais de Lovelock, descrevendo 

o estado do sistema terrestre, através de um conjunto de limites cientificamente 

estabelecidos que definem um estado do Sistema da Terrestre baseado nos últimos 11.700 

anos – a época do Holoceno - limites que devemos respeitar para manter o Sistema da 

Terrestre nesse estado favorável.

A comunidade científica denominou estado favorável do Sistema Terrestre, como Safe 



 20 

Operating Space of Humankind. Este “espaço” de operação segura para a humanidade é 

global, intangível, totalmente interdependente, indivisível e, portanto, um inultrapassável 

e incontornável bem comum. O conjunto destas características, tornou-se num dos fatores 

que mais desafia uma organização social ainda dominada por uma visão que considera 

que a gestão de bens comuns resulta numa inevitável “Tragédia dos Bens Comuns”. Na 

impossibilidade de dividir o bem, a solução tem sido a de tentar minorar a dimensão da 

tragédia sem, no entanto, se proceder à necessária reorganização interna das relações 

imposta pelo uso compartilhado de um bem finito, indivisível e intangível.  Sabemos hoje 

que existem alternativas e que em determinadas condições a ação coletiva é uma 

possibilidade.  

 

1.3. A Ecologia Humana – Uma nova era no conhecimento? 

 

Ainda que numa fase de consolidação, as ciências do Sistema Terrestre são resultado do 

confronto inevitável entre a segmentação parcelar das informações obtidas pelas várias 

ciências da natureza e o suprassistema da escala global, onde tudo interage e onde nada 

existe de forma isolada. Porque esta subida de escala é uma realidade incontornável para 

que se “dissipe as brumas e as obscuridades, que ponha ordem e clareza no real, que 

revele as leis que o governam” (Morin 1990:7), questionaram-se paradigmas, 

desenvolveram-se novas metodologias e novas formas de pensar para construir um novo 

conhecimento. Aliás sempre que a evolução técnica alarga o campo de visão do 

conhecimento e novas ciências surgem, uma série de novas perguntas e de 

reenquadramentos emergem como consequência natural. Na área das ciências da vida por 

exemplo, os novos conhecimentos deram origem a novos significados éticos. Nunes 

(2002:12) afirma mesmo que, "Uma ética fundada na dignidade humana pressupõe, 

necessariamente, que novos conhecimentos na área das ciências biológicas possam 

questionar axiomas considerados imutáveis, de modo a proporcionar - através de uma 

análise introspetiva permanente - uma mudança gradual da visão antropológica do 

homem”.  

Relativamente à Ecologia, ainda antes de se lhe adicionar a palavra humana, 

Soromenho-Marques (1994:16) já afirmava: “Nessa medida, a ecologia não se limita a 

ser mais uma ciência particular a adicionar a outras ciências a outras ciências particulares. 

No plano epistemológico, ela surge essencialmente como desafio conducente à 



 21 

construção de um novo modelo de unidade das ciências, um novo corpus das ciências 

capaz de refletir ao nível dos métodos de trabalho e investigação essa profunda unidade 

objetiva do homem com todos os outros habitantes deste pequeno, mas magnífico mundo 

planetário.” 

Este exercício de confronto e conexão dos novos conhecimentos das ciências do Sistema 

Terrestre com os velhos axiomas das organizações sociais, será mesmo uma condição 

categórica para aferir a intencionalidade do agir humano, na sua relação com o sistema 

envolvente.  Desta forma, esta aferição prévia será igualmente pressuposto de legitimação 

e validação das construções sociais humanas. 

Daqui resulta que nos parece inevitável que a descodificação dos core drivers que 

determinam o funcionamento do Sistema Terrestre e dos suportes da vida, constituam 

informações que em muito deverão condicionar e moldar os paradigmas até hoje 

construídos e que continuam a ser considerados imutáveis. Um Sistema Terrestre 

interdependente e indivisível, se foi e continua a ser um enorme desafio para as ciências 

naturais, será ainda maior no caso específico das ciências sociais. Pelas suas interligações 

e escala é um desafio à forma de pensar e a tudo o que isso representa. 

A questão coloca-se desde logo porque, como afirma Corraliza (1997:27), a "Crise 

ambiental es una expresion infeliz, ya que más bien se trata de problemas de-la-

humanidad". Se nos lembrarmos também que foi a atividade humana que provocou os 

chamados “problemas ambientais” e que essas alterações ambientais, por sua vez, irão 

interferir na qualidade de vida dessas mesmas pessoas, concluiremos que esses problemas 

são, na verdade, problemas da humanidade.  Portanto, a origem dos problemas há que 

buscá-la na deficiente adaptação das sociedades humanas às circunstâncias que impostas 

pelo meio em que se encontram. Soromenho-Marques (1994:65) vai mais longe e faz a 

síntese: “A Natureza já não é mais do que uma forma diferida do homem falar de si 

próprio, um campo onde se projetam os seus sonhos, a sua desmesura, a sua paixão de 

infinito”. 

Posteriormente, foram as próprias Ciências do Sistema Terrestre, que vieram ao 

encontro desta visão e ainda a tornaram mais integrada. Os problemas do ambiente são 

problemas do homem, uma vez que a espécie humana é parte integral do Sistema 

Terrestre: “The Earth System is defined as the interacting physical, chemical and 

biological processes that cycle materials and energy throughout the system at the 

planetary level. Importantly, humans and our activities are an integral part of the ES 

(Oldfield and Steffen 2004). It is critical for the planetary boundaries framework to 



 22 

recognize that the Earth System is a single complex system that exists in well-defined 

states like all complex systems, the ES exhibits threshold/abrupt change behaviour in 

aspects of atmospheric and oceanic circulation, which, if triggered, would create serious 

risks for human well-being (Steffen 2016:24).” 

O auto-isolamento conceptual da espécie humana relativamente à sua dependência 

sistémica no seio do Sistema Terrestre, será com certeza uns dos maiores erros na história 

das perceções humanas: “A ecologia tradicional, ao se preocupar tanto com os aspectos 

físicos e bioquímicos da natureza, solidificando uma ecologia dos bichos e outra ecologia 

das plantas, deixou de fora um grupo-chave para o entendimento das dinâmicas dos 

ecossistemas: a espécie humana, objeto-sujeito da Ecologia Humana.” (Marques 

2011.86).  É neste contexto que a Ecologia Humana surge com a tarefa de colocar “um 

fim na antítese entre natureza e a sociedade, significando que a natureza não pode ser 

mais percebida fora da sociedade, ou a sociedade fora da natureza, os problemas 

ambientais não são problemas do ambiente que nos rodeia, mas antes inteiramente 

problemas sociais. São uma forma peculiar de problemas sociais, já que apesar de 

representarem problemas para a sociedade, embora parecem ser problemas no ambiente 

(Yearley, 2004:87). 

O projeto de integração dos novos conhecimentos obtidos pelas ciências do Sistema 

Terrestre implica subir ainda mais na escala das interligações, procedendo-se a uma 

conexão entre as ciências sociais e as ciências naturais, tornando o desafio da Ecologia 

Humana verdadeiramente civilizacional.  

A tarefa é tudo menos simples e requer também por parte dos teóricos da Ecologia 

Humana um novo pensamento, que não fique refém das metodologias e sistemas de 

validação construídos sob o paradigma disjuntivo. Desde logo, o problema de definição 

de um objeto científico autónomo deve ab inicio demarcar-se da preocupação da sua 

validação e delimitação relativamente às ciências previamente estabelecidas: “A 

dinâmica da Ecologia Humana em sua base científica tenta, dentro das condições 

propostas, incorporar em si um pouco de cada área, sobretudo na tentativa de 

compreender, analisar e valorar não apenas o homem ou o entorno. A sua essência, na 

verdade, parte da construção de uma base filosófica do espaço-tempo na formação do 

individuo e do coletivo. Por este motivo, não há como negar sua importância, 

especialmente na evolução do conhecimento das ciências “não-tecnológicas”, tornando-

se um marco de visão interdisciplinar, revolucionando a visão académica, sobretudo a 

sociologia e antropologia modernas que viram nas bases da ecologia teórica um novo 



 23 

marco científico como fonte de pesquisa integracionista. Assim, pode-se dizer que a sua 

expressão é fruto de uma relação concreta e de forte interdependência do Antropo, 

decorrente de sua ação direta ou indireta com o meio físico-natural. “(Alvim 2014:23) 

Uma ciência que desde a sua formulação inicial pretende colher saberes de todas as 

outras ciências, que “coloca gente nos ecossistemas e situa-se nas inquietações sobre essa 

relação entre a espécie humana e os ecossistemas.” (Marques 2011:86), que tem como 

ambição fazer pontes e integrar o todo tornando-se a Unifying Science, Bruhn (1974:105), 

tem obviamente um longo percurso a fazer na afirmação de um campo de estudo sobre o 

todo, onde a ausência limitações vai continuar a ser um dos principais obstáculos ao seu 

reconhecimento. Bruhn (1974:119) faz um estudo aprofundado em que tenta distinguir a 

Ecologia Humana das ciências já estabelecidas e dissipar a relutância dos “self-interests” 

dos saberes especializados em aceitarem uma ciência unificadora: “It would appear that 

the major limitation in human ecology becoming a unifying science is the self-interest of 

disciplines and the hence an incomplete conceptualization of man-environment relations. 

There are viable but as yet largely untested schemes for studying and understanding man-

environment relations as a series of interdependent systems. For example, Michaelson 

(1970) states that space has been used as a medium in ecological studies rather than a 

variable with a potential effect of its own. Similarly, environment has been referred to by 

human ecologists as the social environment without regard to how the physical 

environment supports or elicits certain social behavior. When the social and physical 

environments are viewed as interdependent systems, it is possible to examine how 

changes in the state or variables in one system affect the state or variables in the other 

(process). In addition, it is possible to study the coexistence of variables or factors that 

bring about congruence (adaption) or incongruence (maladaptation) as the two systems 

interact. He notes that, since any relations existing between environment and social 

behavior are a function of cultural values and perceptions, it is important to investigate 

the way in which physical, social and cultural variables articulate with each other to 

elicit observed behavior.” 

Na nossa análise, o estudo das inter-relações entre sistemas sociais e Sistema Terrestre, 

que revelam adaptação ou não-adaptação na interação dos dois sistemas, será o fator 

determinante para que seja possível o reconhecimento desse estatuto de overview science, 

no caso de este estudo ser realizado com o objetivo da procura de soluções. Como afirma 

novamente Bruhn (1974.120) “If Human ecology is concerned with the interrelationships 

between man and this environment and with the process that affect changes in these 



 24 

interrelationships, it is apparent that single disciplinary studies of these processes can 

provide only small glimpses of the total ecological complex. While theoretical debates 

among disciplines and reformulations of human ecology are sometimes fruitful, what is 

perhaps most disturbing is that the concepts, principles, and methods of human ecology 

used in geography, anthropology, sociology, and psychology are not so different to justify 

the lack of interdisciplinary studies. While is not popular to advocate such studies in 

universities or to propose that research be more oriented toward reaching solutions to 

current human ecological problems, these appear to be worth serious consideration if 

human ecology is indeed to ever become, in practice, a unifying science.” 

 Se a “necessidade de procurar respostas para compreender as complexas 

interações entre processos sociais, económicos e ecológicos marcou em definitivo o 

carácter interdisciplinar da ecologia humana” (Pires; Craveiro 2010:26), e que levou 

igualmente à “necessidade de produzir conhecimento para compreender a relação do 

homem com o seu ambiente, para responder à interrogação de qual o seu lugar na 

natureza” (Pires; Craveiro 2011:15), estão criados os pressupostos programáticos iniciais 

para que a Ecologia Humana possa ambicionar ser essa ponte instrumental de procura de 

soluções integradas baseadas na investigação pluridisciplinar. 

Se entendermos esta “relação entre homem e o ambiente” na sua devida escala – a 

escala global - colocando a Humanidade no seio do Sistema Terrestre, e se o estudo destas 

relações tiver como finalidade última a procura de soluções para transformar a não–

adaptação do modelo existente em propostas de adaptação, estarão criadas as condições 

necessárias para que a Ecologia Humana possa aspirar a ser reconhecida como uma 

ciência verdadeiramente unificadora per se.   

 

 

1.4. Uma Ecologia Humana à escala do Sistema Terrestre 

 

Se o motivo fundador da ecologia humana surge como um resultado emergente da 

crise de adaptação do homem ao ambiente, era inevitável que esta ciência também 

trilhasse o caminho que as próprias ciências ecológicas trilharam. Nas últimas três 

décadas assistiu-se a uma ênfase nas perspetivas dedutivas, simplificadoras e 

experimentais para estudar a estrutura e a dinâmica dos sistemas ecológicos. As análises 

empíricas tendiam para efetuar manipulações, em pequena escala e no curto prazo, de 



 25 

sistemas relativamente simples, a fim de investigar as interações entre espécies e entre 

organismos e o respetivo ambiente abiótico. Nos anos mais recentes, porém, um número 

crescente de cientistas começou a adotar programas de investigação muito mais 

holísticos. Esta viragem foi produto, numa parte, da necessidade prática de estudar os 

problemas ambientais causados pelos próprios seres humanos e, noutra parte, dos avanços 

conceptuais, metodológicos e tecnológicos registados no estudo do Sistema Terrestre.  

Esta evolução entre a fragmentação e a progressiva aceitação do desafio do complexo, 

já anteriormente identificado por Morin (1999), foi igualmente inevitável neste percurso 

da Ecologia Humana. Depois de uma fase inicial em que o objeto do estudo da Ecologia 

Humana estava centrado na análise do uso e apropriação do espaço por parte das 

comunidades humanas e nas relações decorrentes entre estas comunidades com esse 

espaço local de suporte, desta fase inicial em que não existia uma clara distinção entre o 

objeto desta nova ciência e o trabalho realizado pela Geografia Humana ou pela 

Antropologia, surgiu a necessidade da transição de uma análise centrada no uso e 

apropriação do espaço, para uma análise sistêmica em que o objeto do estudo passou a 

ser constituído pelas relações que as comunidades humanas estabelecem com o ambiente, 

e desta forma consolida-se como campo plurisdisciplinar por excelência. 

Ora, desta evolução da análise das relações com o “território”, para a análise 

sistémica dos “processos económicos e ecológicos”, sustentamos que o fator estrutural da 

afirmação e autonomização da Ecologia Humana passa pela assunção de um processo de 

“desterritorialização” do objeto de estudo. Tendo em conta que estes processos 

ecológicos são na sua essência globais, a escala de estudo terá de se compatibilizar com 

a escala dos processos. Como afirma Mcharg (1984:53) “O principal desafio que se 

coloca à ecologia humana é da capacidade de síntese dos processos físicos, biológicos, 

sociais, económicos e culturais para compreender as pessoas os lugares, observar as 

relações sistémicas e comentá-las”. Iva Pires (2011:25) defende mesmo a perspetiva de 

que a “Ecologia Humana seja pensada como esforço para uma inadiável compatibilidade 

entre Socioesfera e Biosfera”. Se o desafio na Ecologia humana for realizado no contexto 

da escala das relações entre a comunidade global (humanidade) e o meio envolvente (o 

planeta e o sistema terrestre que suporta a vida), independentemente das leituras locais 

parciais que possam ser realizadas, esta abordagem poderá constituir a grande novidade 

que a Ecologia Humana pode trazer ao conhecimento, unificando-o e demarcando-se das 

várias áreas de conhecimento que integra e incorpora. A Ecologia Humana seria assim 

uma ciência que emerge da interação de todas as outras áreas de conhecimento, criando 



 26 

uma nova, que como fenómeno emergente, seria mais do que a mera soma das partes. O 

carácter pluridisciplinar da Ecologia Humana fica bem patente na diversidade de áras 

temáticas das suas publicações indexadas na base de dados SCOPUS onde cerca de 50% 

pertencem à área das ciências sociais e a outra metade está distribuída pelas ciências do 

ambiente, medicina, ciências da terra, ou agricultura, entre as principais (Pires, et al, 

2017). 

A legitimidade de todo e qualquer conhecimento, como demonstram previamente 

Camillieri e Falk (1992), depende do seu poder explicativo para retratar a realidade 

conhecida. A aceitação/afirmação de uma nova ciência, mais do que o resultado de 

teorizações ou tentativas de explicações com o intuito de distinguir e afirmar um novo 

ramo de construção de conhecimento, irá depender dessa capacidade de acuradamente 

descrever os factos e explicar da realidade e não de uma discussão centrada nos 

procedimentos e metodologias aplicadas.  

Se o objetivo último será a própria unificação do conhecimento e a Ecologia Humana 

constitui-se como a ciência mais bem posicionada para desempenhar esta tarefa de 

conectar as informações, talvez seja mesmo necessário assumir a sua não delimitação, até 

porque essa delimitação seria sempre dependente das evoluções realizadas pelas outras 

ciências com que interage. Parece-nos que aceitação desta sua condição instrumento de 

conexões e de construção de sentidos, será mesmo um requisito estrutural para poder 

ambicionar ser esse sistema de pontes e interconexões. Neste sentido, a nova escala de 

trabalho das ciências naturais operada pelas ciências do Sistema Terrestre, parece-nos ser 

uma oportunidade única para evolução das construções sociais e para a afirmação da 

Ecologia Humana, como a ciência da visão integradora que avança na construção de 

novas soluções em função destes novos conhecimentos. 

 “A global solution to the sustainability challenge is thus a prerequisite for living 

sustainably at local and regional scales (Steffen et.at 2011:6)”. Parece-nos ilusória a 

perspetiva de que a soma das atuações locais, poderão resultar numa mudança global. 

Mesmo as abordagens numa escala mais reduzida dependem sempre da sua 

contextualização numa abordagem global integradora, e essa tarefa estará inscrita no 

código genético da Ecologia Humana. 

 

 



 27 

1.5. Uma Ecologia Humana à escala da Humanidade 

 

Depois de um longo percurso de investigação empírica, Elinor Ostrom publica em 

1990 o seu livro seminal “Governing the Commons” onde explora de forma inovadora 

sobre a possibilidade da gestão dos bens comuns não terminar fatalmente numa 

“tragédia”. Tendo por base centenas de estudos realizados um pouco por todo o mundo, 

Ostrom demonstrou que a gestão partilhada de terras, água, florestas ou pescas, quando 

realizada sob a orientação de alguns princípios básicos que identificou, pode resultar num 

sucesso para todos. A demonstração desta possibilidade é de enorme importância e 

alcance uma vez que ela destrona a perspetiva de um modelo económico baseado 

exclusivamente nos livres mecanismos de mercado e propriedade privada, como única 

forma de evitar essa tragédia. Esta visão ainda hoje subscrita pela maioria dos 

economistas, foi na sua essência desenhada e popularizada com um famoso artigo escrito 

por um biólogo, Garret Hardin 1968, intitulado: "A Tragédia dos Bens Comuns". O 

exemplo apresentado, que se tornou já um clássico, é o seguinte: numa situação de uso 

partilhado de um pasto entre vários pastores, nenhum pastor individual irá ter um 

incentivo racional para se auto-limitar no uso do pasto comum. Desta forma, se um dos 

pastores trouxer uma cabeça de gado a mais, os outros pastores irão reagir da mesma 

forma, aumentando igualmente o número individual de cabeças de gado a pastar no 

terreno comum e o resultado será a sobre-exploração do pasto e a tragédia de todos. Esta 

linha de raciocínio implica que só através da divisão e atribuição de propriedade privada 

se poderá ultrapassar a inevitabilidade da tragédia dos comuns, pois apenas as pessoas 

com propriedade privada seriam motivadas a proteger e a auto-limitar o uso das suas 

próprias terras. O resultado final seria que a soma total destes comportamentos 

individuais iria ser benéfica para todos. Acontece que Hardin e todos os seus sucessores 

deturparam o conceito de bens comuns ao considera-lo um regime que apenas pode existir 

num completo livre acesso, que se realiza num cenário de ausência de total regras, onde 

não há limites para a apropriação do recurso, nem uma comunidade definida de usuários. 

“But Hardin and others misrepresent the concept of the commons as an open-access 

regime, operating in a free-for-all scenario where there are no boundaries to the grazing 

land, no rules for managing it, and no community of users. However, a properly managed 

commons has boundaries, rules, monitoring of usage, punishment of free-riders, and 



 28 

social norms. A commons requires that, there be a community willing to act as a steward 

of a resource (Gautam 2016: 270)”. 

O free-for-all scenario, tem constituído a base estrutural que suporta a perspectiva da 

inviabilidade da gestão de bens comuns, e a inexistência de uma alternativa consistente 

ao modelo de privatização, divisão e mecanismos de mercado para evitar a tragédia dos 

bens comuns. Para além deste erro de base, esta análise dominante, tem igualmente 

ocultado o facto de existirem bens sobre os quais não é possível realizar nenhum tipo de 

divisão, nem mesmo abstrata, nomeadamente à escala global, onde a tragédia dos bens 

comuns globais é o sinónimo da Suprema Tragédia. 

Nesta escala, para além da abordagem global ao bem, o qual se tornou possível definir 

a partir do momento em que foi identificado o Safe Operating Space of Humankind, é 

também necessário definir a comunidade de interesses na manutenção do bem comum, 

neste caso o estado favorável do Sistema Terrestre. A construção de um modelo de gestão 

do uso organizado do Sistema Terrestre pressupõe a existência de uma comunidade 

humana (o conjunto planetário da Humanidade) internamente organizada, com o objetivo 

de agir como protetora do Sistema Terrestre. 

Como seres humanos, vivemos simultaneamente em dois tipos diferentes de 

comunidades de interesses: uma ao nível das sociedades nacionais e outra ao nível da 

comunidade global. Mas, ao contrário das comunidades nacionais organizadas em 

territórios, a comunidade global da humanidade não é sujeito de Direito Internacional, 

uma vez que não tem território onde basear uma “existência” organizada como uma 

verdadeira comunidade de interesses comuns. O principio da territorialidade condiciona 

de forma transversal todas as construções sociais humanas e nesta matéria o ponto de 

partida a partir do qual a análise tradicional é feita é que uma comunidade humana 

organizada pressupõe necessariamente a conjugação do elemento território com o 

elemento povo, como suporte originário de onde deriva e delimita da autoridade do poder 

político. 

Acontece que à escala da comunidade humana global o "território" da humanidade é 

o planeta, e esse facto ultrapassa o conceito de autoridade e organização exclusivamente 

fundada num elemento territorial. A humanidade não possui desta forma um substrato de 

lugar do qual derivam consequências jurídicas, e a partir do qual se possa basear a 

organização de comunidade de interesses comuns de longo prazo, distintos e 

complementares dos interesses de curto-prazo do Estados. O próprio Património da 

Humanidade é em si uma ficção jurídica imprecisa, uma vez que a humanidade não pode 



 29 

ser verdadeiramente titular de quaisquer direitos, nem sequer de representação, uma vez 

que não possui qualquer personalidade jurídica (nacional ou internacional). Estes 

problemas são visíveis, por exemplo, na gestão internacionalizada dos fundos Marinhos 

- a chamada Área – prevista pela Convenção das Nações Unidas sobre Direito do Mar 

(CNUDM e também conhecida por Convenção de Montego Bay), onde no seu artigo 

artigos 136º, se afirma “A Área e seus recursos são Património Comum da Humanidade.”  

Este património comum é constituído pelos territórios dos fundos marinhos 

remanescentes das jurisdições marítimas dos estados costeiros, isto é, todas as áreas que 

ficam para além dos limites das zonas económicas exclusivas. A discussão doutrinal sobre 

esta questão é em si reveladora da fragilidade do conceito jurídico de Humanidade e da 

própria ficção jurídica que o próprio Património da Humanidade constitui. A humanidade 

como conceito biológico não encaixa no modelo dogmático-formal da organização 

territorial.  

Embora para alguns autores, como Sadok Belaid (1982:433-39), a qualificação da 

Área como Património Comum da Humanidade traduza o reconhecimento da 

comunidade humana ou mesmo da humanidade como titular de um direito de propriedade 

coletivo, a grande maioria contraria veementemente esta opinião. Este posicionamento 

fundamenta-se com argumentos que recaem no facto da comunidade humana ou a 

humanidade não serem sujeitos de direito, isto é, não só a humanidade não possui 

personalidade jurídica, sendo desta forma insuscetível de ser titular de quaisquer direitos, 

como no facto da própria ideia de um direito de propriedade coletiva não parecer 

adequada à caracterização do Património Comum da Humanidade. Em bom rigor, a 

circunstância dos artigos 136º
 

e 137º aparentemente atribuírem à humanidade a 

titularidade de certos direitos, não parece suficiente para concluir a personalidade 

internacional da humanidade e a inerente titularidade das referidas posições jurídicas. Se 

para alguns a inexistência de normas na CNUDM sobre a questão da personalidade da 

Humanidade só pode significar a sua não personificação internacional e a inerente 

insusceptibilidade de possuir a titularidade de quaisquer direitos face à Área, para outros, 

o que releva é a prática da própria Autoridade que age em nome e no interesse da 

Humanidade, não sendo necessário para tal uma menção formal expressa de que a 

personalidade lhe tenha sido atribuída. 

A consideração da Área como Património Comum da Humanidade só pode ser 

explicada através de uma verdadeira ficção jurídica. Na realidade, não é a Humanidade 

que surge como sujeito de direito internacional, mas sim a Autoridade Internacional dos 



 30 

Fundos Marinhos. Consequentemente, só esta pode ser titular de direitos e estar adstrita 

a obrigações, ainda que ficcionadamente se diga agir como representante da Humanidade.  

Uma certeza, porém, existe: o território submerso que está sob o regime jurídico de 

Património Comum da Humanidade funciona como substrato territorial de um sujeito de 

direito internacional (A Autoridade) pelo que esta se assume como titular de um 

verdadeiro domínio público sobre o referido espaço. Todavia, a titularidade do citado 

espaço confere à Autoridade, simultaneamente, o ónus de gerir e explorar os recursos da 

Área em benefício de toda a Humanidade, tendo sempre em vista a sua conservação para 

as gerações futuras (Fialho et.al 2009:10).  

Por outro lado, a Humanidade é recorrentemente mencionada nos textos dos Tratados 

Internacionais, sem, no entanto, ser clara a forma da sua representação, existência ou 

aptidão para se constituir como titular de direitos. Ora se existe algum comentário que 

possa ser feito quanto à questão da Humanidade é que a própria problemática em si é 

reveladora do paradigma da territorialidade como ponto focal a partir do qual se analisam 

todos os factos do mundo real.  

 Isto é, embora o conjunto humanidade exista de facto, não pode ser titular de direitos, 

mas, no entanto, pode nomear representantes para os exercer através dos Estados... uma 

vez que na “(...) impossibilidade de ser atribuída a representação da Humanidade 

diretamente aos Estados, com a consequente criação de uma entidade internacional, por 

meio da qual os Estados organizam e controlam as atividades da Área. (Fialho et.al 

2009:11)”.  

Perceber o contexto legal existente é então fundamental para perceber a estrutura da 

atual relação Humanidade-Planeta/Sistema Terrestre e as causas estruturais que estão na 

base do modelo “não-adaptado” vigente, bem como na inexistência da uma comunidade 

global organizada com o willing to act, conforme mencionado por Gautam, para ser 

possível a construção de uma ação coletiva. Este contexto será ainda um fator 

determinante para o problema do enquadramento jurídico das gerações futuras e os seus 

potenciais interesses.

1.6. Uma Ecologia Humana trans-temporal 

 

 Outra dimensão a ter em conta na análise da relação entre a comunidade humana e o 

/Sistema Terrestre, será perceber de que forma a organização desta comunidade está 

adaptada, ou não, para acautelar os interesses das gerações futuras. A encruzilhada de 

desafios que se colocam à Ecologia Humana na sua afirmação como ciência integradora, 

estendem-se muito além do desafio científico de construção de uma plataforma de 

conhecimento que integra várias disciplinas. Se anteriormente analisamos o desafio da 

escala do objeto, no sentido de que é inevitável abordar o Sistema Terrestre na sua 

globalidade, e um outro desafio relativo ao sujeito, no sentido de abordar a Humanidade 

como o conjunto de todos os seres humanos, relativamente a este último teremos ainda 

que nos debruçar sobre o desafio temporal, no sentido de perceber em que medida o 

modelo de adaptação pode ou não assegurar um suporte de vida para a continuidade das 

gerações que ainda não nasceram.  

Uma vez que os impactos realizados no estado do Sistema Terrestre são cumulativos e 

a relação entre causas e efeitos implicam necessariamente uma projeção de vínculos para 

o futuro, abre-se uma série de possibilidades distintas de abordagens: a) sob uma ótica 

crítica estritamente jurídica, as relações com as futuras gerações podem ser consideradas 

impossíveis, na medida em que estas ainda não existem, b) sob uma análise económica, 

podem ainda ser desinteressantes, no sentido de nada poderem retribuir aos interesses 

materiais das atuais gerações, c) podem ainda ser considerados apenas deveres meramente 

morais. Finalmente, também é possível identificar uma obrigação de solidariedade com 

as gerações futuras e que ultrapassa a noção egoísta e utilitarista das gerações atuais.  

Para Edith Weiss (1992:5) “There are two relationships that must shape any theory 

of intergenerational equity in the context of our natural environment: our relationship to 

other generations of our own species and our relationship to the natural system of which 

we are a part. The human species is integrally linked with other parts of the natural 

system; we affect and are affected by what happens in the system. We alone among all 

living creatures have the capacity to shape significantly our relationship to the 

environment.” Esta visão pode ainda ser sustentada no regime legal de Património 

Comum da Humanidade, como explica Alexandra Aragão (1997:31): “Da ideia de 

Património Comum da Humanidade, podem-se retirar duas consequências: primeiro, que 

sobre estes recursos existe uma espécie de comunhão, uma sobreposição e um paralelismo 



 32 

de direitos absolutos, cuja finalidade é a satisfação tanto de interesses coletivos como 

individuais; segundo, que as gerações atuais os detêm apenas a título fiduciário. A 

responsabilidade fiduciária das gerações presentes perante as futuras significa que os 

recursos devem ser deixados às futuras gerações, tal como foram encontrados, 

preservando tanto a variedade como a abundância como ainda a qualidade dos bens”.  

Este dever é expresso na teoria da “equidade intergeracional”: “The second 

fundamental relationship is that between different generations of the human species. All 

generations are inherently linked to other generations, past and future, in using the 

common patrimony of Earth. The theory of intergenerational equity stipulates that all 

generations have an equal place in relation to the natural system. There is no basis for 

preferring the present generation over future generations in their use of the planet (Weiss 

1992:6)”. 

Apesar deste princípio da equidade intergeracional se encontrar já previsto em algumas 

Constituições, como é o caso da Constituição Brasileira3 onde as gerações futuras não são 

tidas apenas como interessadas, mas antes consideradas verdadeiros titulares de direitos 

em relação ao desenvolvimento e ao património ambiental, esta “responsabilidade de 

longa-duração” levanta várias dificuldades teorético-dogmáticas e jurídico-dogmáticas 

no recorte de um sujeito de direitos e de relações jurídicas, nebulosamente identificado 

como “gerações futuras”, conforme alerta Gomes Canotilho (2003). Estas dificuldades 

levam alguns autores a acentuar que o que está em causa não será a titularidade de direitos 

futuros, mas sim a inclusão dos interesses das gerações futuras nos princípios materiais 

de atuação político-constitucionalmente relevantes. Outra corrente da doutrina refere-se 

a este direito na esteira de reconhecer um direito ao futuro, ou seja, a uma obrigação 

jurídica de proteção do futuro (Ayala 2004, Freitas, 2012). 

Numa lógica estritamente formal será difícil recortar uma relação jurídica com o 

futuro, no sentido de ser impossível definir com precisão o sujeito dessa relação futura. 

É com base nesta lógica de raciocínio que Wilfred Beckerman (2006) nega a existência 

de direitos ou interesses das futuras gerações, baseando-se em três silogismos: (1) às 

futuras gerações – de pessoas ainda não nascidas – não se pode reconhecer quaisquer 

direitos; (2) qualquer teoria de justiça coerente implica uma atribuição de direitos às 

                                                
3 Constituição da República Federativa do Brasil – Artigo 225º “Todos têm direito ao meio ambiente ecologicamente 
equilibrado, bem de uso comum do povo e essencial à sadia qualidade de vida, impondo-se ao Poder Público e à 
coletividade o dever de defendê-lo e preservá-lo para as presentes e futuras gerações.”  - Centro de Documentação e 
informação, Edições Câmara, Brasília, 2012. 



 33 

pessoas. Portanto, (3) os interesses das futuras gerações não podem ser protegidos ou 

promovidos sob a estrutura de qualquer teoria de justiça.  

Desta questão, em virtude da limitação imposta pelo princípio da representação 

democrática (quem decide é a atual geração) e de que a responsabilidade dos governantes 

que tomam decisões hoje é limitada ao tempo das suas vidas, Carla Amado Gomes (2007) 
defende que a solidariedade entre gerações se trata de um imperativo meramente moral, 

que impende sobre a geração que tem na sua disponibilidade a história, e por isso assume 

responsabilidades perante os vindouros — mas esta obrigação não têm um carácter 

jurídico.?Em conclusão Amado Gomes define (2007:108) “a teoria da solidariedade 

intergeracional, apesar de “emotivamente sugestiva” e “nobre nas suas intenções”, não 

consegue ultrapassar o limiar da obrigação moral, em virtude dos obstáculos práticos 

[ausência de representatividade política (dos interesses) das gerações futuras], jurídicos 

(inexistência de mecanismos de imputação de responsabilidade das gerações futuras 

relativamente às anteriores), científicos (impossibilidade de atestar, com absoluta certeza, 

a inocuidade e irreversibilidade de certas intervenções ambientais), sociais (dificuldades: 

- de travar a introdução de inovações tecnológicas que constituem uma melhoria aos olhos 

da geração presente; - de explicar a necessidade de alteração ou mesmo eliminação de 

hábitos presentes em nome de hipotéticos interesses das gerações futuras) que reveste.”  

São estas dificuldades que levaram John Rawls (2008) a afirmar que nós podemos 

fazer algo para a posteridade, mas ela nada pode fazer por nós. Esta situação é inalterável, 

e por isso a questão da justiça não vem à tona. E é por esta razão que o problema da justiça 

intergeracional coloca à teoria da ética severos senão impossíveis testes. 

Antonio Benjamin (2011) alerta ainda para o facto de as futuras gerações não poderem 

estar fisicamente presentes nos debates legislativos do presente, bem como os milhões de 

espécies existentes no planeta, muitas das quais nem sequer são conhecidas pela Ciência. 

No entanto, mesmo reconhecendo a verdade destes factos, também não podemos negar a 

certeza de que as gerações futuras possuirão existência em determinado momento 

histórico, a não ser que a vida neste planeta fosse extinta de uma única vez, situação na 

qual não restaria oportunidade para alguém beneficiar da herança cultural ou dos recursos 

planetários. Como essa possibilidade não se coloca para já, há que ultrapassar o paradoxo, 

como afirma (Weiss 1992:14): “This paradox assumes the traditional conceptual 

framework of rights as rights of identifiable individuals. But planetary intergenerational 

rights are not in the first instance rights possessed by individuals. They are, instead, 



 34 

generational rights, which must be conceived of in the temporal context of generations. 

Generations hold these rights as groups in relation to other generations - past, present, 

and future. This is consistent with other approaches to rights, including the Islamic 

approach, which treats human rights not only as individual rights, but as "rights of the 

community of believers as a whole.” They can be evaluated by objective criteria and 

indices applied to the planet from one generation to the next. To evaluate whether the 

interests represented in planetary rights are being adequately protected does not depend 

upon knowing the number of kinds of individuals that may ultimately exist in any given 

future generation.” 

Este raciocínio parte de um pressuposto fundamental, o de se reconhecer senão a 

existência das gerações futuras, a certeza de que possuirão existência em determinado 

momento histórico. Seja esse facto visto como mera expectativa, seja como futuro 

naturalmente previsível. Helena Melo (2002:156), entende que vários sentidos têm sido 

atribuídos à expressão gerações futuras, quer abrangendo as crianças já nascidas, quer 

abrangendo apenas os indivíduos, quer abrangendo apenas os indivíduos que nascerão 

num futuro mais ou menos remoto. Se partirmos do conceito de geração como “o conjunto 

dos indivíduos nascidos mais ou mesmo tempo (Malhotra 1998:41), cobrindo cada 

geração um período de aproximadamente vinte e cinco anos, tal significa que nesta 

abordagem não existe uma clara demarcação entre uma geração e a geração 

imediatamente a seguir ou anterior. Há, antes pelo contrário, um continuum de gerações, 

que se sucedem e sobrepõem no tempo. Ainda segundo Malhotra (1998:41) “De acordo 

com esta aceção, os indivíduos futuros são indivíduos que ainda não existem, sendo 

impossível determinar com exatidão quem e quantos serão. Juridicamente são 

concepturos, i.e., nascituros ainda não concebidos cujo o nascimento futuro se prevê 

como possível”. 

As gerações futuras serão assim constituídas pelos indivíduos que existirão num 

determinado período da história da Humanidade, pelos indivíduos humanos futuros. 

Giuliano Pontara (1996:112), entende que “indivíduos futuros” serão “todos aqueles 

indivíduos que relativamente aos indivíduos existentes num determinado período de 

tempo t, existirão de facto depois de t.” Estes indivíduos farão parte da “coletividade ad 

infinitum de todos os seres humanos que sucederão à presente geração que se encontra 

viva” num determinado momento da história. Cada geração será deste modo “um elo 

numa cadeia sem fim de gerações que coletivamente forma uma comunidade, a Família 

da Humanidade” (Agius 1998:7). 



 35 

Aparece deste modo, o conceito de Humanidade como uma comunidade 

intergeracional, que inclui as gerações passadas, presentes e futuras, como uma 

“comunidade de seres que olham para trás e para a frente, que interpreta o passado à luz 

do presente, que vê o futuro como nascido do passado” (Agiu, Kim 1998:15). Se o Direito 

ainda busca um caminho que torne possível enquadrar juridicamente uma comunidade 

que existe no interior de todas as fronteiras e é global, as ciências naturais já encontraram 

o fundamento da unidade biológica da existência real e factual desta comunidade global: 

“toda a pessoa, quer viva hoje ou no futuro, se encontra relacionada genética e 

culturalmente com o resto da comunidade da raça humana” (Santos 2001:68). A 

Humanidade pode assim significar a “totalidade do género humano, o conjunto de todos 

os seres humanos que habitam o planeta” (Santos 2001:68) ao longo das sucessivas 

gerações. É também chegada a hora de fazer coincidir estas realidades naturais com a 

realidade construída, que reconhecendo igualmente a factualidade da existência de povos 

politicamente organizados num determinado território juridicamente delimitado, não 

impliquem necessariamente a ocultação e negação da existência de uma comunidade 

humana global geneticamente e temporalmente ligada.  

Mas apesar do contributo positivo na definição de Humanidade suscitada pela 

evolução das ciências da vida e pela descodificação do genoma humano, os problemas do 

recorte de um sujeito de direitos e de relações jurídicas futuras, mantêm-se. E é 

exatamente ao fugir de conceitos metafísicos, que John Ralws (2008), conforme já visto, 

retoma a discussão do futuro num verdadeiro marco teórico sobre a responsabilidade 

intergeracional. Trata-se de uma teoria que busca o descolamento de qualquer vínculo 

jurídico com o futuro de uma visão metafísica sobre o mesmo, apoiando-se na noção de 

interesses enquanto fatores decisivos para a ação, e a racionalidade como critério de 

justiça. Parte-se assim de um pressuposto temporal elementar, qual seja, o de centrar o 

foco no presente e no raio de ação das gerações vivas, ainda que para gerar efeitos para 

as futuras gerações. Na verdade, como refere Fensterseifer, (2014) as gerações futuras 

nada podem fazer hoje para preservar o ambiente de que vão usufruir, razão pela qual 

toda a responsabilidade (e deveres correspondentes) de preservação da vida e da 

qualidade ambiental para o futuro recai sobre as gerações presentes. 

É neste contexto, com base no princípio da solidariedade intergeracional, em que as 

responsabilidades das gerações humanas presentes respondem perante um critério de 

justiça intergeracional, ou seja, entre gerações humanas distintas, que iremos procurar 



 36 

encontrar um espaço em que a Ecologia Humana possa servir como uma plataforma de 

soluções. 

 

 

1.7. Ecologia Humana – Uma ciência do Antropoceno como 
construtora de sínteses e soluções  

 
O último período interglacial relativo aos últimos 11.700 anos, corresponde a um 

período de estabilidade climática sem qualquer precedente na história do Sistema 

Terrestre. É o chamado período geológico do Holoceno. As alterações que as atividades 

humanas estão a provocar na estrutura biogeofísica do Sistema Terreste correspondente 

a este período, são de tal forma impactantes, que estamos a provocar uma alteração nestas 

condições favoráveis e a dar origem a uma nova era geológica - o chamado 

"Antropoceno"- após o Holoceno. Entre os fatores decisivos estão o grande aumento na 

população humana, produção de metano pelo gado, pesca, o uso de água, alterações no 

uso da terra, a queima de combustíveis fósseis e as emissões de CO2, os plásticos e os 

fertilizantes à base de azoto, estão entre as atividades humanas que contribuem para, entre 

outras coisas, as alterações climáticas, a acidificação dos oceanos e a extinção de grande 

número de espécies, a chamada sexta extinção. A totalidade dessas atividades humanas 

contribuíram para o advento do Antropoceno e são já rastreáveis nos estratos geológicos 

da Terra. 

Os motivos que estão na origem da rutura das condições favoráveis e da consequente 

mudança para uma nova época geológica estão profundamente enraizados num direito 

internacional completamente inadaptado para lidar com a dimensão global dos bens 

comuns. As causas estruturais desta disfuncionalidade jurídica são, em nosso entender, 

essencialmente duas: a) manutenção de uma abordagem estritamente territorialista, em 

que os bens comuns globais são apenas os territórios sobrantes das divisões políticas entre 

os Estados, b) manutenção de um direito económico internacional que considera como 

“externalidades” (positivas ou negativas) as alterações provocadas nos ciclos 

biogeofísicos globais. De referir, que embora numa primeira análise estas causas 

aparentem uma ausência de relação, a consideração destes fatores vitais como 

“externalidades” encontra a sua razão de ser na abordagem territorialista: porque estes 

elementos não-territoriais só podem ser considerados “externos” ao território dos Estados, 



 37 

estes ciclos biogeofísicos são juridicamente irrelevantes e, como resultado desta 

irrelevância são também economicamente invisíveis.   

Os resultados desta inadaptação são uma inexorável caminhada para a tragédia dos 

ciclos biogeofísicos globais, que por sua vez irão dar origem à tragédia dos territórios, da 

organização social e das fundações da vida - a Tragédia Suprema. A consideração de que 

os fatores que afetam os ciclos biogeofísicos globais são “externalidades” relativamente 

aos Estados, e de que tudo o que é global ou trans-temporal, ou é invisível ou 

tecnicamente impossível, são os bloqueios dogmáticos que impedem a mudança 

estrutural como única possibilidade de encontrar um conceito que nos permita uma 

solução.  

Para ultrapassar este bloqueio, para gerir estes desafios de evolução e mudança, 

precisamos de maneiras efetivas de tomar decisões coletivas e de longo prazo que tenham 

em consideração a sobreposição destes ciclos biogeofísicos que existem no interior e 

exterior de todos os Estados, e os interesses de todos os afetados incluindo os interesses 

das futuras gerações. O sistema implementado para gerir estas questões globais - 

incluindo a ONU e as organizações conectadas com as Nações Unidas - está, na sua forma 

atual, refém do sistema estado-cêntrico, sem uma definição e delimitação clara dessa 

tarefa comum de assegurar a manutenção do Sistema Terrestre como um todo, de forma 

autónoma e complementar aos interesses individuais dos Estados. Hoje, estes desafios da 

interdependência são respondidos com o recurso a ferramentas de ontem - negociações 

multilaterais que são suscetíveis a interesses nacionais de curto prazo. Como 

consequência, as ações necessárias não são tomadas ou são tomadas muito tarde, 

enquanto os problemas e os riscos continuam a crescer.  

Como Afirma Anthony Giddens (1999:18), “Estamos a ser empurrados para uma 

ordem global, que devido à sua escala e total interdependência, nem sequer a 

conseguimos compreender ou explicar, mas cujos os efeitos se fazem já sentir. Mas 

ninguém que pretenda progredir neste final de século pode ignorar esta realidade (...). O 

Século XXI será o campo de batalha em que o fundamentalismo se vai defrontar com a 

tolerância cosmopolita.” Esta nova ordem global, é ainda uma desordem. Ainda não é 

conduzida por uma vontade humana coletiva, mas antes emerge de forma anárquica, ao 

acaso, movida por uma mistura de influências. Nesta desordem florescem os 

nacionalismos, os populismos locais como resposta às tendências globalizantes 

desreguladas, e que tornam os velhos Estados-Nação mais fracos, na ilusão de que se 

afirmarem a sua independência fechando as fronteiras, se tornam mais fortes. A 



 38 

possibilidade de sairmos deste ciclo fatal compete em primeiro lugar ao direito, na sua 

dimensão de estrutura organizadora e harmonizadora destas tensões e não no seu papel 

sancionatório. Ainda na esteira de Giddens (1999:24), “Assim, há que admitir que a 

globalização não é um processo simples, é uma rede complexa de processos. E estes 

operam de forma contraditória ou em oposição aberta. Para a maioria das pessoas, a 

globalização é apenas uma “troca” de poder ou de influência, das comunidades locais ou 

das nações para a arena global. (...) Precisamos de reconstruir as instituições que temos, 

ou substituir por outras. Porque a globalização não é um incidente passageiro nas nossas 

vidas. É uma mudança das próprias circunstâncias em que vivemos. Para superar esses 

desafios, teremos que repensar a natureza fragmentada do sistema jurídico internacional”. 

Neste sentido a organização destes interesses comuns necessita de uma autonomização 

que permita a sua gestão permanente por uma entidade independente que aja em nome e 

no interesse de todos, e onde todos estejam devidamente representados. 

No contexto das relações dominantes entre Estados, ainda é visível que em alguns 

dos mecanismos comerciais que fazem parte dos acordos ambientais multilaterais 

(MEAs), demonstram igualmente que o quadro subjacente das relações está ainda 

intimamente ligado ao legado colonial do direito internacional. Com o advento da 

interdependência e do Antropoceno, sabemos hoje que a exportação de problemas 

ambientais do "núcleo" para a "periferia", dos estados desenvolvidos para os países em 

desenvolvimento, não é apenas moralmente censurável, como conduz ao mesmo 

resultado. Por outras palavras, perceber o Antropoceno é interiorizar a globalidade, a 

interdependência e ser capaz de pensar sem fronteiras, percebendo que a origem ou 

localização da atividade humana danosa serve apenas como informação para a construção 

de um sistema de organização da justiça interna, mas que é irrelevante na escala global. 

Esta impossibilidade de “exportar” atividades que provocam danos ou de armazenar 

benefícios, suscitadas pelas interconexões ecológicas e que resultam em 

interdependências políticas e económicas, são os sinais exteriores de algo que nunca 

existiu antes: uma sociedade cosmopolita global. Somos a primeira geração a viver numa 

sociedade, cujos contornos ainda mal conseguimos vislumbrar, e para qual não existe 

ainda um sistema de organização nem à escala da comunidade humana, nem à escala do 

funcionamento global do Sistema Terrestre.  

Como se afirma no relatório Global Commons in the Anthropocene, “The 

Anthropocene is the defining concept of our age. The most significant implication for life 

in the Anthropocene is the urgent need to shift to a new worldview that encompasses the 



 39 

idea of planetary stewardship for the Global Commons, thereby delivering global 

benefits. Effective planetary stewardship can be defined as the sum total of societal and 

individual activities that generate long-lasting prosperity for all and enhance the 

resilience of the Earth system. To achieve this aim will require a shift in worldviews at 

all scales, from local community to nation and from regional to global” (Nakicenovic,N. 

et.al 2016,32-33).  

A  nova era do Antropoceno significa uma nova visão do mundo, onde o pensamento 

em silos desaparece, onde o pensamento global enquadra e orienta as ações locais, onde 

as fronteiras são encaradas apenas como um nível necessário da organização social que 

não é confundível com a realidade global ambiental, onde os fenómenos ambientais e os 

fenómenos sociais se percecionam como interdependentes, encaixa com missão da 

Ecologia Humana como ciência que, pela sua especificidade, pode dar um contributo 

relevante para essa nova forma de olhar o mundo (Pires 2014). O seu grande objetivo 

pretende ser uma contribuição para a construção de uma visão antri-fragmentária do 

mundo unindo e dando sentido à contribuição das ciências especializadas (Steiner e 

Narkus, 2003), procurando conexões entre os saberes que de outra forma ficariam 

segregados (Borden, 2014). 

Só partindo de uma visão global, onde o contacto e interação entre as ciências naturais 

e as ciências sociais é fundamental, é possível construir uma mediação entre as 

capacidades da técnica, o Sistema Terrestre, as nossas intenções e as organizações que as 

sustentam.

 A Natureza Intangível 

 
 
 

 
“Nunca conseguiremos ser donos da nossa própria história, mas é obrigatório que 
encontremos os meios, e temos capacidade para isso, de colocar este nosso mundo 

“desvairado” no rumo certo. (Giddens 1999 p.18) 
 
 
 

 

2.1. O Património Intangível como o fio de Ariadne do Antropoceno 

 

Como explicado anteriormente, a utilização da “territorial obsession” (Taylor 

2016:112) como modelo exclusivo da organização social, é uma narrativa 

manifestamente incompleta e limitadora não só no contexto da complexidade ambiental 

existente, bem como na diversidade das sociedades de hoje. Este modelo territorialista 

que oculta tudo que interliga, interfere e é global, tem tido como resultado a abertura de 

um espaço de livre arbítrio, que marginaliza a própria autoridade do Estado. Isto acontece 

nos mais variados níveis, exigindo uma evolução para uma multi-level governance, que 

vai muito além da governança espacial do território. Neste contexto, a par com a questão 

ambiental, a área que mais se tem destacado pela sua influência e pelo seu poder efetivo, 

é o da globalização financeira. Woodward (2005:46), no seu artigo “territorial trap” 

afirma: “Therefore spaces of places models alone are not sound basis for the development 



 41 

of a generalizable framework of multi-level governance. Space of places models need to 

be complemented by an analysis of non-state spheres of authority understood as “spaces 

of flows” (Choen1998). The spaces of flows perspective recognizes that some spheres of 

authority are deterritorialized meaning that they derive their power and authority from, 

and exercise their power and authority over, functional or social as opposed territorial 

spaces. The strength of this approach is its appreciation of sites and structures of 

governance that cut across, exist within and cascade through territorial levels. The 

problem is that the spaces of flows blueprint ignores or marginalizes structures of power 

and authority grounded in territorial space, so, like space of places model, it represents 

an incomplete narrative on contemporary financial governance. Cohen’s (1998) solution 

to this dilemma is to introduce a fresh concept, “the authoritative domains”, that 

recognizes, reconciles and synthesizes territorial and non-territorial elements of power 

and authority’s territorial and non-territorial elements of power and authority into a single 

overarching governance condominium.” 

A nível ambiental a ocultação social das conexões globais e a inexistência de uma 

governação efetiva dos elementos não-territoriais constituídos pelos ciclos biogeofísicos 

globais (para os quais as atuais tentativas de governação multilateral, têm sido 

manifestamente insuficientes) exigem igualmente uma governação não-territorial.  

Neste sentido, a governação do Antropoceno requer esta abordagem multi-escala, 

onde a governação dos interesses globais e comuns a toda a humanidade, presente e 

futura, coexiste com a governação territorial. E não deixa ser interessante o facto de o 

modelo proposto para uma governação financeira da globalização ser o condomínio, 

como o único modelo jurídico capaz de comportar uma governação multi-level. Estas 

soluções de coexistência apontam para o facto de que o que está em causa não é o “fim-

do-Estado” territorial, mas sim, a sua inevitável evolução. O principal obstáculo a 

ultrapassar é precisamente o atual modelo da “obsessão territorial” como solução única 

de governação. Se partirmos da inevitável factualidade do funcionamento global do 

Sistema Terrestre para a procura de soluções, percebemos que o reenquadramento destas 

barreiras conceptuais jurídicas é possível, e essa é uma condição prévia estrutural para a 

construção de um modelo de organização social adaptado ao funcionamento planeta – 

isto é, é um passo primordial para realização do próprio objetivo da Ecologia Humana.  

A Ecologia Humana, ao colocar a comunidade humana no seio do ecossistema 

global – o Sistema Terrestre – está a confrontar-se com uma série de paradigmas sociais 

consolidados ao longo da história da humanidade. A sua visão holística é em primeiro 



 42 

lugar altamente desafiante para o sistema jurídico, como esquema regulador das relações 

entre indivíduos, Estados e comunidades. Neste sentido, a ecologia humana na sua função 

de síntese dialogante, deverá ter como parceiros estratégicos as ciências do Sistema 

Terrestre e as ciências jurídicas, os quais vão ser essenciais para realizar o trabalho de 

enquadramento teórico prévio, na construção de uma sociedade adaptada ao 

funcionamento do Sistema Terrestre.  

 

2.2. Organizar a fruição coletiva 

 

Embora recente na escala temporal das ciências jurídicas, o direito do ambiente, 

pela sua capacidade de intervir em todas as áreas do agir humano, desde cedo, quer no 

processo da sua conceptualização, quer no processo da sua aplicação, revelou-se 

subversivo e complexo. O carácter difuso e indeterminado do seu objeto, a 

impossibilidade de o conter no interior de uma fronteira administrativa ou política, 

levantou problemas de harmonização com os restantes ordenamentos jurídicos internos 

ou internacionais, sobrepondo as dimensões locais e globais com as estruturas jurídico-

dogmáticas estabelecidas.  

Este desajustamento entre o novo direito e o direito pré-existente deve-se em grande 

medida a esta sobreposição de diferentes tipos de relações humanas em diferentes escalas, 

em que algumas das quais podem ser em parte enquadradas no nível local do Estado, mas 

cujos os efeitos são em grande parte dispersos numa escala global. Isto é, enquanto a 

dimensão do micro-bem ambiental gera relações típicas do Direito Público ou do Direito 

Privado nos termos tradicionais para o Direito, a dimensão do macro-bem ambiental – o 

Sistema Terrestre – deveria gerar um novo tipo de relação jurídica, de natureza global, e 

para a qual não existe um suporte legal nem locus que lhe possa conferir um 

enquadramento jurídico.  

Esta incompatibilidade sistémica entre funcionamento do Sistema Terrestre e modelo 

de divisão territorial existente, não se ficou apenas ao nível do espaço geográfico. 

Aprofundando a disfuncionalidade entre modelos, a crise ambiental questiona ainda não 

só o modelo económico quanto ao objetivo do crescimento ilimitado, como ainda levanta 

a questão da absoluta da necessidade de desenvolver um modelo de prossecução de 

interesses comuns. Ora estas características são altamente desafiadoras para o modelo 

económico existente, onde a solução para a harmonização entre interesses coletivos e 



 43 

interesses privados nos é apresentada através da consideração de que a soma da 

prossecução dos interesses individuais representará a melhor forma da prossecução dos 

interesses comuns. É neste contexto que o “bem ambiente” surge, e que sendo um bem 

global indivisível e inapropriável (embora o seu estado possa ser alterado pelo uso), não 

se presta a uma fruição de troca e alienação, mas sim a uma função de fruição coletiva 

(Colaço Antunes 1998). Isto é, a tarefa de organizar a fruição do ambiente, neste caso o 

macro-bem Sistema Terrestre, não pode ser realizada numa lógica de divisão, propriedade 

privada e mecanismos de mercado desregulados.  

Ora, conscientes desta impossibilidade na escala do Sistema Terrestre, um dos 

desafios mais importantes do Antropoceno será o de anular a antítese existente entre os 

dois nos modelos de governança de bens comuns: a solução clássica de Garret Hardin – 

divisão, direitos de propriedade e mecanismos de mercado para evitar a "Tragédia dos 

Comuns" - e a abordagem de Elinor Ostrom que estabelece as condições estruturais 

necessárias para que gestão coletiva seja possível,  resultando em vantagens mútuas para 

todas os participantes no médio prazo.  

À escala de nosso verdadeiro Global Common -  o Sistema da Terrestre – a utilização 

isolada de uma destas soluções, não é capaz de retratar com precisão todos os factos: 

  

a) As fronteiras políticas das soberanias constituem o suporte estrutural da 

organização social. Neste nível, a solução de divisão de Hardin, parece 

permanecer válida sem nenhuma alternativa visível. 

 

Mas por outro lado… 
 

b) O estado favorável do Sistema Terrestre é um bem intangível global, no qual não 

é possível realizar nenhuma operação de divisão, nem mesmo abstrata. Neste 

contexto, os princípios identificados por Ostrom para a gestão bem-sucedida dos 

bens comuns, podem vir a ser um contributo de excecional relevância para a 

construção de um modelo capaz de assegurar a preservação do estado favorável 

como uma herança que deve ser mantida para usufruto das próximas gerações. 

 

Então o desafio que se coloca ao Direito é em grande medida o da construção das 

condições estruturais necessárias para tornar possível esta fruição coletiva de um bem que 

não é suscetível de apropriação ou divisão, e ao mesmo tempo assegurar a manutenção 



 44 

da divisão política territorial. Só depois desta organização estar realizada, à escala do bem 

em causa - o Sistema Terrestre – será possível que o direito do ambiente se torna efetivo 

– isto é que abandone o seu deficit sistémico de aplicação. Esta desvinculação da vertente 

proprietarista individual, e a assunção da inevitabilidade da abordagem do ambiente como 

“bem comum”, insuscetível de divisão ou de qualquer forma de apropriação individual, 

irá constituir o grande desafio da construção de um modelo social para o Antropoceno. 

Para Amado Gomes (2005:24), “O ambiente é um bem de uma comunidade e a sua 

dimensão coletiva não pode ser perdida de vista. O direito subjetivo indicia uma posição 

egoística, longe da perspetiva solidarista que deve presidir à gestão dos bens ambientais. 

Por isso consideramos que a melhor doutrina é aquela que vê no direito ao ambiente um 

direito-dever de utilização racional dos bens ambientais.(...) O direito ao ambiente, 

constitui desta feita, um bom exemplo de um novo tipo de direitos fundamentais, 

verdadeiros “direitos de solidariedade”, “direitos poligonais” ou “direitos circulares” cujo 

conteúdo é definido pelo interesse comum,(...)”. Ora esta organização implica uma 

análise das relações cruzadas e não raras vezes opostas, que se exercem sobre este bem 

de fruição coletiva à escala da comunidade humana global. A identificação das dinâmicas 

humanas de usos com efeitos negativos e a identificação das dinâmicas naturais que 

realizam benefícios na manutenção do sistema comum, são uma tarefa base para perceber 

os conteúdos destas relações e para poder organizar esta fruição.  

Uma vez que é de todo impossível fazer coincidir a escala do bem “ambiente” com os 

limites dos territórios soberanos dos estados, e que o problema da definição do objeto do 

direito do ambiente pode ser ultrapassado através da definição do Safe Operating Space, 

existem neste momento as condições necessárias para se dar o salto conceptual na 

definição desse “ambiente salubre” como um novo bem jurídico, que só pode ser 

assegurado à escala do Sistema Terrestre. Por consequência, ao ser necessário 

ampliarmos a escala do bem, também a escala da comunidade tem de ser ampliada à 

totalidade de sujeitos que partilham o uso do mesmo sistema, formando desta forma uma 

verdadeira comunidade de interesses comuns. Como consequência da impossibilidade de 

divisão do bem ambiente, o papel da Ecologia Humana como ponte entre as ciências 

naturais e o direito, será o de estudar e propor soluções de auto-organização, no sentido 

de harmonizar as interdependências humanas globais que se estabelecem pela mútua 

dependência relativamente ao uso de um mesmo Sistema Comum.

 2.3. Um sistema jurídico baseado numa visão do mundo obsoleta 

 

No contexto de um percurso histórico em que a existência humana chegou a ser 

formulada como uma realidade exterior e autónoma à natureza e/ou ecossistema global, 

é natural que as construções sociais sejam também um reflexo da história dessas 

mundivisões. Por se tratar de um campo do conhecimento autónomo e fundado em 

princípios e estruturas lógico-formais próprias, as construções jurídicas refletem 

inevitavelmente o posicionamento ontológico do homem no seio da natureza. A valoração 

jurídica do meio ambiente possui uma natureza cultural e por isso tende a expressar uma 

condição ontológica antropocêntrica. “Por outras palavras, o meio ambiente somente foi 

introduzido como suporte fático e, posteriormente, como fato jurídico em virtude de sua 

internalização pela cultura humana, ou seja, pela sua representação lógico-formal em 

normas jurídico-ambientais (Garcia 2016:90).”  

A transmutação do “bem ambiente” de suporte fáctico sobre o qual se exercem 

diferentes formas de apropriação - direitos de soberania, propriedade ou de uso - para a 

consagração como bem jurídico autónomo com valor per si, é o resultado do processo 

histórico da destruição desse próprio “bem ambiente”, que transformou um bem 

abundante e que se pensava infinito, num bem escasso e limitado cuja deterioração 

provoca sérios danos às sociedades humanas e ameaça mesmo a sobrevivência da própria 

espécie. Este será mesmo o motivo que transformou um bem que desde sempre foi 

juridicamente irrelevante como um “valor” humanamente reconhecido. Como explica 

Garcia (2016:88) “A relação do Direito com a realidade, ou seja, do mundo das ideias 

(desdobramento da manifestação cultural e ética humana) com o mundo dos factos, dá-se 

por meio de vínculos previamente estabelecidos ou admitidos pelas normas. Quando 

determinado acontecimento é constatado, a ocorrência de efeitos jurídicos dependerá de 

seu reconhecimento por alguma norma e a correspondente atribuição de consequências 

jurídicas”.  

Para chegarmos ao atual nível de juridicidade, o meio ambiente evoluiu da absoluta 

irrelevância jurídica para a consagração como direito e bem fundamental, tendo invadido 



 46 

um grande número de textos constitucionais por todo mundo. Com uma variedade 

alargada de expressões para traduzir este fenómeno natural complexo, a Constituição 

Portuguesa no seu artigo 66º optou pelo conceito de um “ambiente sadio e ecologicamente 

equilibrado”. Dado o seu carácter sistémico o “bem ambiente” é incompatível com a 

delimitação territorial dos Estados, deu origem a que as definições deste bem usem 

recorrentemente conceitos indeterminados e de delimitação imprecisa. Aliás, a dimensão 

sistémica do bem a proteger foi já percecionada no interior dos próprios Estados, uma vez 

que essa é uma factualidade inultrapassável: “[...] um Estado constitucional ecológico 

pressupõe uma conceção integrada ou integrativa do ambiente e, consequentemente, um 

direito integrado e integrativo do ambiente. [...] o conceito de direito integrado do 

ambiente [...] aponta para a necessidade de uma proteção global e sistemática que não se 

reduza à defesa isolada dos componentes ambientais naturais (ar, luz, água, solo vivo e 

subsolo, flora, fauna) ou dos componentes humanos (paisagem, património cultural e 

construído, poluição), (Gomes Canotilho, 2010:8).”  

O Sistema Terrestre, embora percecionado e vivido diariamente pelos sentidos, foi ao 

longo da história da humanidade um campo fértil para o inexplicável, para o 

desenvolvimento de visões místicas ou conceitos indeterminados. Numa total ausência 

de informação sobre as características do Sistema Terrestre e dos fatores que determinam 

a seu funcionamento, não se conhecendo sequer a existência de um estado favorável e de 

limites para a sua manutenção, o resultado inevitável seria a sua invisibilidade social e a 

sua não consideração como fator essencial à construção de uma organização capaz de 

proteger as fundações da vida. Não só não se conhecia, como a possibilidade de as 

atividades humanas poderem estar a provocar uma mudança neste estado favorável eram 

questões que ultrapassavam os limites hipotéticos do saber e fazer humano. O clima 

estável e o funcionamento regular dos ciclos da vida eram-nos apresentados como dados 

pré-adquiridos e imutáveis.  

Neste cenário, onde o complexo e inexplicável se confunde com o inexistente, o 

místico e o sagrado, não era possível reconhecer este estado favorável como um fator da 

maior relevância, e que pudesse ser definível e internalizado como um valor vital para a 

vida e organização das sociedades humanaa. 

Aceitando a perspetiva do direito como construção humana resultante do processo 

histórico-cultural da nossa espécie, Mosset Iturraspe (1999:303) define bem jurídico 

como “bem é tudo o que pode satisfazer uma necessidade. Um bem jurídico é todo bem 

material ou imaterial – de valor económico ou não – que satisfaz necessidades do 



 47 

homem”.  

Tal condição deve-se à exigência, considerada básica e elementar pela teoria geral do 

direito, de que os factos reconhecidos pelas normas jurídicas possuam relevância para a 

vida humana. Da mesma forma, aquilo que for considerado inexpressivo ou irrelevante, 

é igualmente ignorado pelo Direito. Esta tarefa primordial valorativa, coloca o Direito na 

posição crítica de permanentemente necessitar de se compatibilizar com a evolução do 

conhecimento, procedendo a uma reinterpretação da realidade tendo em conta as suas 

várias dimensões e os novos contextos, evitando ficar preso a distorções cognitivas dos 

seus próprios dogmas. Conscientes da fragilidade de todas as construções humanas e da 

enorme responsabilidade que cabe às ciências jurídicas nesta tarefa de interpretar e 

valorar a realidade conhecida, sabemos que a única forma de corresponder a este desafio 

será de estabelecer um permanente diálogo entre os seus conceitos e o seu modus 

operandi, e a evolução do conhecimento científico e social. Mas nas ciências naturais, 

como nas ciências da vida, todos os avanços são simultaneamente geradores de liberdade 

e de novas responsabilidades: “A aplicação técnica das novas ciências da vida (o conjunto 

das chamadas biotecnologias) alargou, de forma inédita o âmbito do fazer humano; 

podemos dizer que, pela primeira vez, na história da humanidade, o homem dispõe de um 

saber que lhe permite exercer poder sobre a natureza, sobre a vida e sobre a morte, isto é, 

sobre o que antigamente fugia à sua alçada e era considerado fatalidade ou, de um modo 

determinista, uma sequência puramente casual de acontecimentos. 

No entanto, este poder, libertador e gerador de autonomia, tem-se revelado ambíguo e 

perigoso: desencadeia efeitos extremamente benéficos e simultaneamente ações cujas as 

consequências perigosas têm uma dimensão cósmica e muitas vezes irreversível. É 

justamente isto o que nos assusta e inquieta, exigindo-nos pela primeira vez, 

responsabilidade. De facto, tudo o que nos envolve pode, hoje, pela primeira vez, 

depender inteiramente de nós. (Silva, 2002.10)” 

O estudo recente sobre as consequências das ações humanas sobre o ambiente, trouxe-

nos a informação sobre o funcionamento do Sistema Terrestre, e esse “ambiente 

ecologicamente sadio” abandonou a condição de conceito indeterminado de contornos 

espaciais e qualitativos incertos, para se traduzir no espaço intangível de segurança bem 

definido, que não conhece fronteiras. Isto é, hoje conseguimos identificar quais são os 

elementos que determinam o funcionamento do Sistema Terrestre e de que forma e em 

que medida ao alterarmos esses fatores, interferimos no funcionamento do sistema do 

qual somos parte. De facto, hoje, tudo o que nos envolve, desde o próprio genoma da 



 48 

nossa espécie, ao “código genético” do funcionamento do Sistema Terrestre, tudo pode 

realmente depender inteiramente de nós. O facto de termos provocado estas alterações 

aos mecanismos e condições essenciais de suporte da vida, deu-nos acesso a um 

conhecimento que gerou um enorme poder e uma tremenda responsabilidade à ação 

humano no seu todo. 

Esta possibilidade requer por parte do direito do ambiente uma intervenção que 

ultrapassa a sua consideração como “ramo de direito”, e convoca-o para uma evolução 

que seja capaz de representar uma nova mundividência em que os elementos não-

territoriais que asseguram a condições biogeofísicas da vida, estejam no centro em torno 

do quais se regulam as relações que se realizam entre todos os seres humanos, numa 

escala global.  

Ora, como afirma Garcia (2016:89), “A primeira questão a ser enfrentada pelo Direito 

Ambiental é o de identificar seu objeto principal ou centro de tutela. Em que pese ser 

possível apresentar a resposta “meio ambiente” de maneira rápida e lógica, o que se busca, 

verdadeiramente responder é de qual meio ambiente se está efetivamente tratando.” Por 

muito que o bem em causa não se confine às divisões político-administrativas, o carácter 

global, indivisível e interdependente do estado funcional favorável do Sistema Terrestre 

é uma factualidade inultrapassável. Constituindo as fundações da vida como a 

conhecemos até hoje, o seu valor é obviamente vital, inquestionável e incontroverso. É o 

meta-valor, que assegura e suporta as condições de vida na Terra, e da própria espécie 

humana. Neste sentido, como refere o Acórdão de 02/07/1996 Proc. Nª. 483/96 do 

Supremo Tribunal de Justiça: “Repare-se neste pormenor tão simples quanto 

incontroverso: se as condições reais levarem à desarticulação dos meios ambientais que 

permitam, efetivamente viver, o direito à vida não passará de uma abstração teórica de 

curto prazo. (…).“ Ao não abarcar o “bem ambiente” na sua verdadeira escala, o direito 

corre o perigo de ocultar o seu verdadeiro sentido, e o seu dever-ser. Neste acórdão, “o 

nosso Supremo Tribunal de Justiça, realiza a difícil tarefa de organizar (de forma 

estratégica e prudente) a passagem de uma intencionalidade espiritual, um dever-ser 

patente nas normas constitucionais, para um "ser" realizado por esse espírito, e tornar-se 

num promotor efetivo do processo histórico-cultural, apontando o afinamento da 

estratégia de ação, assumindo a dimensão vital do jurídico no seu sentido modelador da 

vida, perante aquela que é considerada como a principal crise com que a humanidade 

alguma vez se defrontou (Magalhães 2005:96).” 



 49 

Esta dimensão qualitativa - the healthiness – do Sistema Terrestre, escapa às 

abordagens jurídico-dogmáticas tradicionais sobre o ambiente, pelo facto de ser 

impossível isolar um determinado ecossistema, região ou país, da qualidade do sistema 

global. Isto é, as principais características do “bem ambiental” são a sua globalidade e 

intangibilidade – o Sistema Terrestre é global e indivisível, e a qualidade do seu estado 

depende da sua estrutura biogeoquímica global, uma vez que esta vai ser determinante no 

funcionamento dos seus fluxos e balanços energéticos – os chamados ciclos 

biogeofísicos. Estas características obrigam a que a proteção do ambiente se alargue à 

proteção de bens intangíveis naturais, e à escala em que o bem existe –  a global.  

Ora, o cumprimento da função modeladora do direito e de concretizar esta passagem 

de um dever-ser de um ambiente “sadio e ecologicamente equilibrado”, para a construção 

de uma sociedade humana adaptada ao funcionamento do Sistema Terrestre e aos seus 

limites, implica uma nova visão do mundo em que esse “bem ambiente” será mais do que 

a soma dos conceitos indeterminados presentes numa alargada quantidade de 

Constituições Estatais e em Tratados Internacionais. O desafio que o Antropoceno coloca 

ao Direito é o de através de um exercício de interdisciplinaridade se tornar numa ciência 

promotora do processo histórico-cultural que leve ao reconhecimento “deste ambiente 

sadio e ecologicamente equilibrado”, como um bem jurídico na sua verdadeira escala – a 

global - e relativamente ao seu verdadeiro sujeito – a comunidade humana na sua 

globalidade.  

A relevância vital do Safe Operating Space for Humankind, é uma factualidade 

inultrapassável. Só que este fenómeno agora conhecido e definido, não é ainda 

socialmente reconhecido por nenhuma norma, nem a realização de benefícios ou danos 

no estado deste bem comum vital é desencadeadora de consequências jurídicas. A 

necessidade da sua internalização por parte da organização das sociedades humanas, 

parece uma evidência. O facto de este bem existir dentro e fora de todas as soberanias, 

não pode ser um obstáculo ao seu reconhecimento como um fenómeno relevante para a 

humanidade. Isto é, a partir do momento em que determinado facto ecológico se torna da 

maior relevância para o ser humano, é natural que esse bem que até ali tenha sido 

considerado irrelevante, seja reconhecido como bem e jurídico.  

Não só o bem jurídico é uma construção puramente humana que existe num processo 

de permanente evolução e aperfeiçoamento histórico, como também lembra Bosselmann 

(2015:61), as construções jurídicas humanas existentes, não são um valor per si: “It may 

be time now to remind ourselves that the law has no intrinsic value, but is a mere human 



 50 

construct intended to govern ourselves in a civilized manner. However, what could be 

more civilized than caring for the conditions that make human life possible in the first 

place. It is here where the concern for the integrity of life as a whole has its place. And it 

is here where a renewed sense of the rule of law must have its beginning.” 

O principio de tudo, da possibilidade da construção de uma civilização humana como 

a que possuímos hoje dependeu destas condições favoráveis intangíveis que hoje 

conseguimos identificar e mensurar. E a partir do momento que os limites do planeta do 

Holoceno são quantificáveis, essa integridade pode ser usada como medida de legalidade 

do agir humano. 

Isto é, o “bem ambiente” estado favorável do Sistema Terrestre, como fenómeno 

natural do mundo real, que anteriormente se aparentava como imutável e infinito cujo o 

fazer humano era incapaz sequer de o atingir ou alterar, passou de juridicamente 

irrelevante e inexistente, à mais valiosa herança recebida pela humanidade da natureza. 

Esse novo bem, resultante de uma valoração enunciada por uma norma jurídica, irá ser 

irradiador de direitos e deveres que deverão constituir a base organizativa do uso regulado 

deste bem comum global, da qual poderá emergir uma nova harmonização das relações 

humanas que agora se alargam ao global. 

 

2.4. A desmaterialização do Bem Ambiental 

 

 

O facto de o estado favorável do Sistema Terrestre ser, como o próprio nome indica, 

um sistema, e como tal ser essencialmente composto por elementos não-territoriais e 

intangíveis, isto é, pelos ciclos biogeofísicos que se dispersam e atravessam todo o 

planeta, não pode constituir um obstáculo intransponível à sua qualificação como 

fenómeno ecológico juridicamente relevante para o ser humano.  

A existência de coisas incorpóreas, há muito que é reconhecida pela cultura humana. 

O conceito de coisa incorpórea e a sua estrutura de definição buscam as suas origens na 

filosofia grega, mais especificamente da escola aristotélica: de facto, Aristóteles diz-nos 

que coisas incorpóreas são aquelas que não podem ser tocadas. O que pode ser percebido 

com os sentidos é um corpus, uma coisa corpórea; o que não pode ser tocado é uma coisa 

incorpórea, apenas percetível através do intelecto. Os juristas romanos seguiram os passos 



 51 

da cultura grega, e classificaram os bens como: res corporales e res incorporales. 

Segundo Mousourakis (2012:121,122) “With respect to the res in nostro patrimonio (or 

res in commercio), a distinction was drawn between corporeal (res corporales) and 

incorporeal thing (res incorporales). The former term referred to things that could be 

touched or perceived by the senses such as a garment, an ox, a table or a house. The term 

res incorporales, on the other hand, denoted intangible things no capable of sensory 

perception that the law recognizes and protect, such a real and personal rights. (…) 

Because incorporeal objects could not be physically seized as required for possession to 

exist, they thus could not be acquired or transferred by any method involving the 

acquisition or transfer of possession.” 

Coisas corpóreas são aquelas que pela sua natureza são dotadas de existência física, 

material, que podem ser tocadas, como um terreno, uma casa, etc... . Por outro lado, coisas 

incorpóreas, são aquelas coisas que embora não possam ser tocadas, possuem uma 

existência abstrata ou ideal, isto é, existem para a lei; como por exemplo, uma herança, 

usufruto ou uma obrigação. Inicialmente, apenas os direitos reais eram considerados res 

incorporales. Posteriormente, como resultado de uma luta liderada pelos dos intelectuais 

do século XVIII, que reivindicavam reconhecimento das “ideias” ou “criações do espírito 

humano”, segundo o principio de que a obra é independente de qualquer fixação ou 

materialização (Ascenção 1992.62), os direitos pessoais foram igualmente reconhecidos 

como coisa incorpórea. O reconhecimento “obra humana” como coisa incorpórea, isto é, 

de que a ideia per si, depois de tomar forma no foro íntimo do autor e de ser exteriorizada 

por qualquer meio de forma que seja possível ser captada pelos sentidos, teve o seu 

reconhecimento como objeto juridicamente relevante em 1710 através da célebre lei do 

copyright da Rainha Ana de Inglaterra. Através desta lei o direito de reprodução, já não 

pertencia em favor dos impressores, mas já em favor dos autores, constituindo 

simultaneamente um direito pessoal do autor e um novo objeto jurídico imaterial. Isto é, 

este normativo legal permitiu estabelecer uma divisão jurídica entre o direito intangível 

do autor e o suporte material em que a obra está gravada, criando desta forma um objeto 

jurídico intangível – a ideia, a criação intelectual do autor. É esta separação, que nos 

permite por exemplo, que ao comprarmos um livro apenas adquiramos a titularidade 

sobre o papel e tinta que constitui o suporte da gravação da obra, e não os sobre os direitos 

relativos à obra que está ali gravada. De juridicamente inexistente até ao início do Século 

XVIII, a ideia intangível do autor, tornou-se, na opinião dos intelectuais da época, na 

“mais sagrada de todas as propriedades”. 



 52 

Estas soluções técnico-jurídicas constituem alguns dos alicerces estruturais em que 

se baseia a nossa organização social. Por exemplo, sem esta separação legal entre a ideia 

intangível de um autor e o suporte tangível onde esta ideia é registada, não teria sido 

possível o desenvolvimento do conhecimento nem sua disseminação em massa. Mas o 

reconhecimento jurídico de objetos intangíveis não se ficou pelo copyright. O património 

cultural imaterial reconhecido através da UNESCO, ou o valor intangível das empresas 

em direito comercial, onde frequentemente o valor dos ativos intangíveis de uma empresa 

são incomparavelmente superiores aos ativos tangíveis, são outros exemplos em que a 

necessidade de organizar o uso de algo ou a relevância dos bens em causa, justificaram a 

busca por novas soluções por parte do direito. Os objetos jurídicos intangíveis foram um 

fator determinante de desenvolvimento e um suporte estrutural crítico na criação da 

civilização em que vivemos hoje.  

A analogia entre esses objetos de direito intangíveis e o Sistema de Terrestre igualmente 

intangível pode também ser crucial para representar e compreender a funcionalidade 

global e indivisível do Sistema da Terrestre na nossa sociedade, bem como o valor real 

dos ecossistemas naturais, onde o valor intangível dos seus serviços para a humanidade é 

incomparavelmente superior ao valor tangível das infraestruturas naturais que produzem 

esses serviços. Atualmente, por exemplo, o valor das florestas que são vitais para a 

manutenção desse estado favorável, das nossas vidas e as futuras gerações só se tornam 

visíveis nas transações financeiras e económicas da sociedade através da destruição e 

transformação dessas florestas em madeira. Na verdade, também na natureza existem 

outros tipos de património para além daqueles que podem ser vistos e tocados. Isto obriga 

a pensar o conceito de capital natural, não apenas como o espaço e as infraestruturas 

ecológicas tangíveis, mas a considerar o seu conjunto, como a soma resultante da 

totalidade da infraestrutura ecológica tangível e da totalidade alterações químicas 

biogeofísicas positivas que constituem os serviços ecológicos globais intangíveis. Feitas 

as contas, tendo em conta o caracter vital destes serviços e a sua escassez, os ativos 

intangíveis naturais terão uma importância muito superior aos proporcionados pelos 

recursos físicos tangíveis na produção de bens e serviços.  

Este processo histórico é da maior importância para percebermos como este processo 

de desmaterialização do objeto do direito foi um fator estrutural de profundo significado 

na construção das sociedades modernas, e como as soluções jurídicas organizativas são 

um fator estrutural dos modelos sociais. 



 53 

 

 
 2.5 A natureza intangível como conexão entre Sistema Social e Sistema 
Terrestre. 
 

Num trabalho recente sobre o Global Commons no Antropoceno (Nakicenovic,N., 

Rockstrom,J., Gaffney,O. 2016), identificam-se alguns biomas críticos como bens 

comuns globais: “The critical biomes (Figura 3) that regulate regional energy flows, 

hydrological flows, and carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles and provide stable 

habitats for living species are under threat. These biomes are interconnected with each 

other – moisture feedback from the Amazon rainforest affects the temperature and 

function of the tropical monsoon system, which in turn may interact with the global 

climate system. Critical biomes play a decisive role in regulating the overall status of the 

life-support system on Earth, that is, how well Earth can support world development. 

Significantly, the resilience of ecosystems, critical biomes, and the biosphere as a whole 

determines the degree of feedback (negative or positive, weak or strong) to the climate 

system, which regulates the degree of global warming, which in turn, generates a direct 

feedback to the biosphere, affecting all ecosystems.”

 55 

Como observamos na figura 3, os critérios que estiveram na base da escolha destes Global 

Commons in the Antropocene tiveram por base um critério qualitativo-funcional, à qual 

acresce a dimensão da quantidade em que estes serviços qualitativos são prestados, 

resultando na definição das infraestruturas ecológicas que possuem maior relevância na 

resiliência do planeta. Isto é, da soma da qualidade e da quantidade dos global ecosystem 

services prestados, resulta a sua classificação como Critical Biomas. No entanto esta 

listagem merece da nossa parte a seguinte análise crítica: 

a) Biodiversidade global – embora seja abordada na ótica da perda total em número 

de espécies, ela não deixa de estar territorialmente vinculada aos Estados onde essas 

espécies e comunidades; habitats e ecossistemas estão localizados. O mesmo também se 

pode referir quanto ao país de origem dos recursos genéticos, isto é, “Country of origin 

of genetic resources – The country which possess those genetic resources in situ 

conditions”, conforme definido no artigo 2º da Convenção da Diversidade Biológica. A 

biodiversidade possui uma existência material que é em grande medida geograficamente 

delimitável, e como tal, reivindicada pelos Estados que exercem a jurisdição sobre os 

territórios onde a biodiversidade está localizada; 

 

b) Os ciclos biogeoquímicos - elementos não-territoriais e intangíveis, com uma 

circulação permanente de caracter global não geograficamente delimitável, e cuja divisão 

jurídica ou apropriação física são impossíveis; 

 

c) Biomas Críticos – vários tipos de infraestruturas ecológicas que prestam esses serviços 

de ecossistema de impacto e interesse global, possuindo dessa forma um valor 

determinante na manutenção e resiliência do Sistema Terrestre (Florestas Tropicais, 

Florestas Boreais, Criosfera), mas que são territorialmente delimitáveis. Nesta listagem 

identifica-se mesmo a sua localização específica, como por exemplo: Amazónia, 

Florestas Tropicais da Ásia do Sul, Florestas Boreais da Europa ou os Glaciares de 

Montanha de todo o mundo.  

 

 Se de um ponto de vista das Ciências do Sistema Terrestre, a identificação destes 

biomas críticos faz todo o sentido, já a sua classificação como Global Commons, merece 

dúvidas da nossa parte. Como conceito jurídico que é, e segundo a própria definição da 

UNEP- “The ‘Global Commons’ refers to resource domains or areas that lie outside of 

the political reach of any one nation State. Thus, international law identifies four global 



 56 

commons namely: The High Seas; the Atmosphere; Antarctica; and, Outer Space. These 

areas have historically been guided by the principle of the common heritage of humankind 

- the open access doctrine or the mare liberum (free sea for everyone) in the case of the 

High Seas. Despite efforts by governments or individuals to establish property rights or 

other forms of control over most natural resources, the Global Commons have remained 

an exception.” 

O critério que fundamenta esta classificação proposta para os Global Commons in 

the Anthopocene não é o particular interesse científico, estético ou natural de um ou outro 

bioma, mas sim a importância qualitativa em termos do impacto que estes biomas críticos 

possuem nos ciclos biogeoquímicos globais e a consequente influência destes nos fluxos 

energéticos, que no conjunto da sua interação são determinantes na manutenção do estado 

favorável do Sistema Terrestre. Ao incluir nesta lista de Global Commons para o 

Antropoceno os ciclos biogeoquímicos, os biomas críticos e a biodiversidade, esta 

proposta mistura no mesmo conceito elementos territoriais ou territorialmente 

delimitáveis com elementos não-territoriais. Como é sabido, do ponto de vista jurídico, e 

de acordo com o principio da territorialidade, não é possível classificar como Global 

Commons parcelas de território que estão sob a jurisdição de um determinado Estado. É 

uma ilusão pensar que um Estado que possua no interior no seu território algum destes 

biomas críticos, vá abdicar da soberania sobre essa parcela de território em favor de um 

regime legal de Global Commons ou Património Comum da Humanidade.  

Reconhecendo a importância determinante destes biomas nos ciclos biogeoquímicos 

globais, a solução passará inevitavelmente pela procura de novos conceitos baseados nos 

conhecimentos científicos entretanto desenvolvidos e que procedem a uma leitura da 

realidade não exclusivamente territorial.  

Sendo certo que todos estes biomas críticos são territorialmente delimitáveis e 

tangíveis, estando sob a jurisdição de um ou mais Estados (com exceção da Antártida e 

do Ártico), e que o motivo desta classificação é a sua contribuição determinante na 

manutenção do estado favorável do Sistema Terrestre, somos obrigados a chegar à 

conclusão de que o que é verdadeiramente comum a toda a humanidade são os 

benefícios(os “global ecosystem services”) realizados por esses biomas nos ciclos 

biogeofísicos globais. Por outras palavras, o que é realmente Global Common nestes 

biomas, são os serviços intangíveis prestados a todo o Sistema da Terrestre, e não a 

infraestrutura natural física em si, que está sob a jurisdição de um ou mais Estados. Quer 

isto dizer que se repudiarmos a tentação materialística e territorialista, e procedermos a 



 57 

uma distinção jurídica entre os serviços intangíveis dos ecossistemas e a infraestrutura  

tangível natural que os realizou, isto é, reconhecendo que a natureza não é apenas o 

conjunto dos bens tangíveis que formam o ecossistema (por exemplo florestas tropicais) 

e o espaço geográfico delimitável e mensurável em hectares, mas também o ativo 

intangível concretizado pelas alterações positivas nos ciclos biogeoquímicos que ali se 

processam, podemos criar uma representação da natureza com uma maior capacidade de 

a retratar e traduzir o seu real valor.  

Dado que estes ciclos existem apenas na escala global, só a criação de um objeto de 

direito intangível global pode representar este fenómeno natural da maior relevância para 

a humanidade – o Sistema Terrestre. Só através do reconhecimento de um objeto legal 

com as mesmas características do “bem ambiental” – global e intangível - poderemos 

ultrapassar este dilema entre a delimitação territorial das sobernais e o funcionamento 

global do Sistema Terrestre.  

A realidade é que o nosso planeta não é apenas uma área geográfica com 510 milhões 

de km2. Na verdade, todos os planetas conhecidos têm uma área geográfica que pode ser 

dimensionada em km2. O que os outros planetas não possuem é um sistema intangível 

acoplado ao planeta físico, capaz de sustentar a vida, tal como a conhecemos. Do ponto 

de vista jurídico, o planeta tem apenas uma existência: a área do território. Essa visão 

unidimensional deixa de fora a expressão mais notável e vital da natureza - o 

funcionamento do Sistema da Terra como um sistema de suporte de vida único e 

complexo. 

Se aceitarmos que a natureza possui igualmente uma dimensão intangível, que o 

Sistema Terrestre é o nosso principal Global Common, e encontramos forma de 

representar esta realidade factual na nossa organização social, reconhecendo-o como bem 

juridicamente relevante do qual deverão emergir consequências jurídicas, novas formas 

de coordenação global podem ser imaginadas. 

Se, tal como nos direitos de autor, em que existe uma separação jurídica entre a obra  

e o suporte físico em que está gravada, procedermos igualmente aqui a uma separação 

legal entre os serviços intangíveis produzidos pela infraestrutura natural tangível que 

forneceu esses serviços, e esses serviços intangíveis se tornassem socialmente visíveis 

num novo objeto legal intangível global, esses serviços passariam a ter sua existência 

reconhecida no novo bem comum global, dessa forma os global Earth System services 

poderiam tornar-se em ativos económicos intangíveis. O sistema usado para capturar na 

escala global todos estes serviços de ecossistema que contribuem para a manutenção dos 



 58 

ciclos biogeofísicos num estado favorável (o património comum intangível global), 

também poderia ser usado para capturar os danos que lhes são infringidos, e dessa forma 

construir um sistema justo de contabilidade. 

Se a esta contabilidade de fluxos positivos e negativos para a manutenção dos ciclos 

biogeofísicos, lhe associarmos um sistema de pagamentos pelas utilizações que 

contribuem para nos afastarmos do espaço de manobra seguro para a humanidade, e de 

compensações pelos benefícios que contribuem para a manutenção deste espaço, 

estaremos a promover a de forma estrutural a construção de uma sociedade sustentável. 

Ao compensar o Estado que tem jurisdição sobre o território onde foi produzido o 

serviço que beneficia o estado do Sistema Terrestre, indiretamente, estamos a promover 

proteção e restauração das infraestruturas naturais, promovendo a equidade e a justiça 

entre os povos e influenciando a governança desses territórios, sem, no entanto, ameaçar 

a soberania dos Estados. 

O reconhecimento de objetos legais intangíveis não é novo nas ciências jurídicas, 

pelo que o trabalho que nos propusemos realizar aponta para a necessidade de atribuirmos 

relevância jurídica à natureza intangível como forma de ultrapassarmos o impasse 

estrutural da não-adaptação da nossa organização social ao funcionamento global do 

Sistema Terrestre, tendo na sua base nos seguintes argumentos: 

 

 

a) Os processos biogeofísicas intangíveis são fenómenos naturais que determinam 

o funcionamento e o estado do Sistema Terreste, os chamados - core drivers - 

neste sentido são absolutamente vitais para toda a humanidade; 

 

b)  Porque mesmo apesar de serem atualmente considerados como 

"externalidades" económicas, o valor dos serviços dos ecossistemas para a 

humanidade é incomparavelmente superior ao valor tangível das infraestruturas 

naturais que os produzem;  

 

c) Porque apesar de serem hoje economicamente invisíveis, a ausência de uma 

provisão regular destes serviços tem como consequência prejuízos económicos 

muito superiores ao custo de provisão;  

 



 59 

d) Hoje possuímos as ferramentas científicas necessárias para definir este bem 

natural intangível global, e o seu estado favorável- o Safe Operating Space for 

Humankind; 

 

e) Porque só através do reconhecimento da sua existência é possível establecer um 

regime legal que organize o seu uso. Essa é também uma condição estrutural 

para ser possíve promover a sua manutenção permanente; 

 

f)  Porque o reconhecimento dos serviços de ecossistema globais produzidos pelas 

infraestruturas ecológicas como ativos intangíveis é a forma de introduzir o 

trabalho da natureza nas nossas sociedades sem necessariamente implicar a 

destruição da infraestrutura natural;  

 

g) Porque o reconhecimento da existência da dimensão intangível da natureza é 

uma condição estrutural para construir equidade e justiça nas relações entre os 

seres humanos à escala global, e de essa forma promover igualmente a 

adaptação da comunidade humana à forma de funcionamento do Sistema 

Terrestre;  

 

h) Porque este reconhecimento é uma condição estrutural para construir uma 

economia de manutenção do Sistema da Terrestre e restauro da nossa Casa 

Comum; 

 

i) A utilização de objetos legais intangíveis no que diz respeito ao Sistema 

Terrestre é crucial para tornar visível o que realmente importa e nos une a todos 

como uma comunidade global de interesses vitais interdependentes e comuns;  

 

j) Porque a construção de uma ficção jurídica relativamente ao “espaço de 

operação segura para a humanidade” como um património comum é também a 

forma de construímos um “território virtual” onde a Humanidade poderá basear 

a sua organização, e onde os interesses das gerações futuras poderão estar 

representados independentemente da existência jurídica das pessoas concretas 

futuras que irão depender da proteção desses interesses.   

 



 60 

 

Esta proposta de construção de um suporte jurídico global relativamente a um 

fenómeno natural ao qual, em nosso entender, deve ser atribuída relevância jurídica, tem 

como objetivo transcrever legalmente a complexidade das conexões entre seres humanos 

que se realizam através do uso do Sistema Terrestre. Com a presença deste novo elemento 

no contexto do Direito Internacional, devem emergir um conjunto de direitos e obrigações 

correspondentes, que obrigam a repensar a relação entre todos os povos do mundo. 

A gestão do uso do Sistema Terrestre implica uma "gestão do sistema" que transcende 

a "gestão-territorial" dos Estados e tem como objetivo principal a responsabilidade pelo 

bem comum de todos, incluindo as gerações futuras e outras formas de vida com as quais 

compartilhamos o planeta.

Chapter 3 

 Global Free Riders ...4 
 
 

“A human being is a part of a whole, called by us universe, a part limited in time 
and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated 
from the rest... a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.” 

 Albert Einstein 
 
 
 

 
3.1. Tragedy Without Territory 

 
It is now widely accepted that climate change is a “tragedy of the commons” on a 

global scale. When a tragedy is occurring simultaneously inside and outside all borders, 

it does not comply with the principle of territoriality of jurisdictions or of norms. It is a 

superimposed common reality in all territories, without having a territory. Also, in the 

dominant view of “territorial obsession”, existing is to have territory. Being global is not 

having territory. The underlying principle is the assumption that everything that goes 

beyond our limits should be considered as external to us – an externality in the words of 

economists. Pollution from an aircraft is an externality for the economy and when 

performed outside the airspace of states, it becomes a case for jurists. 

Based on this vision, one can define common areas where theoretically all of humanity 

becomes sovereign over the international commons (res communis omnium), in which 

the “common” is what is left over (open sea, seabed, Antarctica), the remains of what 

could not be seized. Pureza (1998:26) considers that “the res communis own regime as a 

traditional framework for common international spaces is a sequence rather than an

 62 

antithesis of the national sovereignty principle”. The common is not that by which its 

nature and characteristics is truly common but what remains after appropriation. 

In the confrontation between this one-dimensional simplification of the world and the 

highly complex and deeply interconnected Earth System, we are flooded with more 

questions than answers: Whose tragedy? Where does the responsibility for acting lie? 

Who has the instruments to act for the benefit of all? How can we speak about benefiting 

everyone if humanity, being global, has no territory, a fact that by itself gives rise to its 

legal non-existence? Yet, are there any organized people in a territorial political 

community that do not belong to humanity? If humanity exists materially, and is just one 

single family with a common origin, will it cease to exist just because it doesn’t exist in 

a formally organized political territory? Can the concept of sovereignty exist without the 

prospect of an unlimited temporal projection into the next generations? 

As sophisticated as societies and their technologies can be, the organization of social 

life leads us invariably to the same primary questions: What is mine? What is yours? 

What is common or public, or what doesn't belong to anyone? But the reality is always 

more complex than these simplified operations. To the questions whose simple solutions 

of separation serve as responses, we can add another: What is simultaneously mine, yours 

and everyone’s in an overlapping and symbiotic way? 

As we will see throughout this book, there is no simple answer to this complex 

question, especially if we look at property not only as a form of ownership over something 

but also as an organizing tool of social relations. It is at the crossroads of belonging to all, 

owned by no one where ‘belonging to’ does not have any clear legal definition, and whose 

outcome is often resolved by resorting to res nullius. Kiss (1982:122) came very close to 

the essence of the issue when he asked: “How can a good that belongs to no one be subject 

to a legal regime?” From this paradox, and because legal existence is inextricably linked 

to some form of "ownership", emerges what was classified as the doctrine of “complex 

property”. 

New questions always elicit new answers. However, it is interesting to note that even 

as we surpass the Earth’s borders and launch into the conquest of space, the same classic 

questions invariably arise. Oosterlinck (1996:1), in his article “Tangible and Intangible 

Property in Outer Space”, states: “Property in space is certainly one of the most important 

issues for the future not only in the context of the more classical form of tangible property 

such as minerals but also intangible property such as orbital slots on the geostationary 

orbit, frequencies, etc.” 



 63 

Only with clear and precise legal answers to these primary questions might there 

surface an element of stability, without which the construction of any organization is 

impossible, and therefore the construction of any future. Transferred from one earthly 

reality dominated by territorial and tangible dimensions, we are now involved in a spatial 

reality dominated by apparent emptiness and the intangible. Although within an 

environment that is strange and cannot be 'comprehended' by our senses, the ability to 

explore new resources and carry out activities that open new possibilities on Earth created 

the need to internally organize our relationships concerning the use of these new 

intangible spaces; therefore the classical questions arise again, with new variations. 

The possibility to regulate the use of certain goods involves the ability to first describe, 

measure, locate and name them, and then to classify them. In other words, in order to 

regulate the use of a certain good, we have to have defined it. 

The legitimacy of a theoretical construction always depends on its explanatory 

capacity of reality. In Space, unlike on Earth, the classification of any legal regime should 

take as its starting point the reality of the intrinsic characteristics of the goods and not a 

previous theoretical construction later applied to the goods in question. This process, 

whose initial impulse is the well-known reality, was similar to the approach carried out 

by Roman law, which therefore continues to be used in Space today. According to 

Oosterlinck (1996:2), “Under Roman Law, ‘Res’, or things, are classified into res 

corporals and res incorporales”. It was in the Roman legal system where the “emptiness” 

of space found a concept (res incorporales) to explain the new reality of the areas in 

outer space or langrangian points, orbits including specific slots of certain orbits, 

trajectories and to certain extended frequency spectrum. But even so, “Within res 

corporals a certain number of things are excluded from trade ‘res quarum commercium 

non est’, normally referred to res extra commercium”. That is, there are other features 

regarding the nature of the good itself that makes its trading impossible, and are essential 

elements in the definition of the legal regime. 

This qualitative approach of Roman law differs immediately from the current approach 

of monistic simplification, which is merely spatial/geographic, between the things that 

are within the territory of states and those that are outside the jurisdiction of states. 

For Roman law, the res communis omnium are available to all and cannot be owned 

by anyone, not even by a state; for example, the air, rain and flowing river water, the sea 

and shore. Therefore, the origin of the res communis omnium was not one territorial 



 64 

division, an abstract criterion where the common is only the part remaining after 

appropriations; the good’s intrinsic qualities led to the classification of its legal status. 

It is very interesting to note the distinction between source and resource in the analysis 

of the Roman legal system and the constraints that this distinction imposes on the use and 

exercise of property. In practice, the Romans looked differently upon the issue when 

considering the sea as a whole and when considering its constituents. In the former case, 

they qualified it res communis omnium and the latter res nullius. Or, in more general 

terms, “res communis differs from res nullius in that the source of resources cannot be 

appropriated but the resources themselves are amenable to appropriation. (…) Res nullius 

may be subject to appropriation through effective occupation and the will expressed by 

the (new) owner to exercise ownership (corpore et animo)” (Oosterlinck 1996:2). The 

intrinsic quality of the good and the possibility of its effective possession, to acquire 

ownership, were decisive in the classification of the regime applied to it. 

The “ocean the whole” was the source, which by its very nature was inappropriable, 

and the fish in it one appropriable resource. The fact that it is inappropriable and common 

to all, and therefore global, does not necessarily mean that it doesn’t exist or that some of 

its constituents may be physically appropriable.  

That being said, another crucial problem in defining the use and ownership regime was 

the feature of inexhaustibility.  

These resources were looked at as inexhaustible and their appropriation was 

physically possible and would moreover only be partial, leaving thus the possibility 

to others for future exploitation and use of the sea. Hugo Grotius evokes however, 

though briefly, the possibility that fish could be an exhaustible resource of the sea 

but in his view this would not alter the legal status of the sea as a whole. 

(Oosterlinck 1996:3)  

(…) if it were possible to prohibit any of these things, say for example, fishing, for 

in a way it can be maintained that fish are exhaustible, still it would not be possible 

to prohibit navigation, for the sea would not exhausted by that use. (Grotius 1916) 

Therefore, in summary, we can pose some questions that are central in determining 

property regimes: the possibility to appropriate the good or otherwise; if the good has an 

in- or exhaustible character, or better yet, if the use of the good, without a physical 

appropriation of it, may or may not lead to the exhaustion of it. Throughout the article, 



 65 

the author, using a theoretical analogy between ocean and space, between source and 

resource, analyses the existing legal regime and the options whose, in his opinion, 

performance is still required in the organization of the use of this new frontier where 

natural intangible resources are also limited (as in the spectrum of frequencies or the 

geostationary orbit). As in all areas in which the law has been called into action, a precise 

clarification of the various types of ownership is needed in space too, in order to organize 

the relationships established around the use of sources and resources, which, by being 

exhaustible, cannot be used according to a free-access regime. 

Synthesizing the previous analysis: 

 

1) Roman law distinguishes between the source that is not appropriable and the 

resource that can be physically appropriated; 

2) Grotius analyses the exhaustible or inexhaustible character, which is decisive 

in defining the ownership regime, access or use of the good; 

3) There are some uses of the good, although not corresponding to a physical 

appropriation, that can lead to its exhaustion; and 

4) In the outer space law, intangible property is not only confined to human 

intellectual property.  

 

Based on this summary, we realize that there are also natural intangible resources in 

the Earth System that can be exhausted by some uses, although they can escape our 

senses.  

With climate change and the discovery that a stable climate is not an inexhaustible 

factor, that is, the incorporales biogeophysical conditions that determine the state of the 

Earth System have upper and lower limits and therefore are exhaustible, the “ownership” 

of this resource is not realized through a physical occupation but rather through its use, 

i.e., as a change in the qualitative state of its incorporeal characteristics. 

One should consider the recent period of relative climate stability corresponding to the 

Holocene (the last 11,700 years after the last ice age), which has been the basis for the 

development of human civilizations (the history of the human species corresponds to a 

period of about 200,000 years), as a particularly favourable state of the Earth System for 

our species and for others that share the same ecological conditions. Every time a state, 

company or an individual contributes to a change in the biogeochemical conditions of 

this period of stability, which has benefited all humankind, an “externality” in the natural 



 66 

res incorporales is generated, affecting all other users of this favourable state as less 

resource (considering the stable state of the Earth System as a resource) will be available 

to all agents. 

The biogeochemical conditions that ensure a stable climate and the favourable 

conditions of the Holocene are a natural intangible limited resource on Earth. The 

favourable conditions of the Holocene arose in an evolutionary fashion throughout Earth's 

history and it is through this evolutionary process involving the living part of the planet 

as well as the geophysical that, for example, the relative concentrations of gases have 

remained relatively constant through time. In essence, it is the integration of the 

geophysical properties of the planet with the living biosphere that forms the intangible 

Earth System, a single global system incapable of any legal abstraction of division. 

In the source/resource Roman law perspective of analysis, the source of this favourable 

state was the living biosphere and its interactions with the geophysical components. In 

other words, the sources are the ecological infrastructures, and the resource the 

biogeochemical conditions of the state of the Earth System. 

We have been exploiting a vital resource we did not even know existed; nor did we 

know if it was exhaustible or inexhaustible. The stable climate was, quite simply, a pre-

acquired data. The possibility of it being affected by human activity was a hypothesis that 

did not even arise. The only value we truly recognized was in the sources of this unknown 

global resource, which was the primary activator of their massive destruction (for 

example, more than 80% of the original forests). This is a new situation in regard to its 

possible classification. First, the natural resource is intangible and as such is not 

physically appropriated. Second, this good does not recognize land, air or ocean borders. 

It refers to a specific biochemical structure of the atmosphere and of the oceans, and its 

integration with the geophysical properties of the planet with the living biosphere that 

forms the intangible Earth System. In this respect, taking into account their characteristics 

and the ways in which these res incorporales were being perceived over time, we can 

identify some similar elements in four possible categories: 

 

1) Terra Incognita: The intangible higher level of integration of the Earth 

System, because it was unknown, can be considered a true terra incognita, an 

“unknown space”, traditionally defined as regions never mapped or documented. 

2) Res Nullius:  The change in the biochemical structure at the higher level 

of the Earth System can be considered to have been carried out under the open-



 67 

access regime condition, without rules, and in this sense is a res nullius. A good, 

being a res incorporales and an unknown resource, is not suited to traditional 

effective occupation, that is, a conscious will to ownership (corpore e animo). 

However, its use can lead to its exhaustion. 

3) Terra Nullius: In the Middle Ages, terra nullius was used to define 

unclaimed or unoccupied territories, usually situated between fiefdoms and used 

as dumps for garbage and deposits. Although intangible and non-territorial, the 

fact that pollution legally disappears in the legal inexistence of the Earth System 

allows us to consider it as a no-man's land, as the place to send waste, and 

therefore an externality. 

4) Res Communis Omnium: The Earth System is available to all and cannot 

be appropriated by anyone, not even by a state. When this common property 

extends to all humankind, the goods come to be considered as res omnium. They 

are the common heritage of humankind so all human beings, both the present and 

future generations, have the right to access them in a favourable state. However, 

given its character as an exhaustible resource, it is necessary to create a legal 

framework for both the use and the benefits realized in the common good. 

 

3.2. Legal Black Hole 

 

The “global” is therefore a new reality that is outside the legal frameworks built to 

date. Within existing classifications, although we can find some elements that partially 

adapt to this new reality, there is no legal asset that is simultaneously global and res 

incorporales with the ability to reflect the harmful changes of the biochemical structure 

of this favourable state of the Earth System. In the same manner, there is no way to capture 

or account for the benefits provided by ecosystems in the maintenance of a favourable 

state and enjoyed by all on a global scale. This new reality, already accepted and 

recognized by science and clearly visible from space, still remains invisible to the law. 

If we take as a starting point the current prevailing view that the common is not by its 

nature truly common but what remains after appropriation, and if to this view we join the 

legal invisibility of the higher level of the Earth System as a whole, what remains is not 

a terra incognita but truly an incognita sine terra. 



 68 

Terra incognita was the term used in the 15th and 16th centuries to mark unknown 

land – the regions that had never been mapped or documented. After terra incognita had 

disappeared from our maps and the planet had “become spherical”, where one could go 

back to the point of origin without going backwards, a first major step was taken towards 

realizing the overall unity of the planet at the geographical level of integration. We had, 

however, to wait until almost the end of the 20th century to realize that the planet and its 

operating system had more than a well-defined geographical, physical and palpable 

dimension. A new reality was revealed when we discovered that the gases and substances 

emitted into the atmosphere not only did not disappear in space but were also 

interchanged with the land and the oceans, or that what was released into the sea did not 

disappear into an ocean of infinity. Step by step, science was uncovering the upper level 

of integration of an Earth System with global and complex interconnections that were 

difficult to observe and define. However, despite their intangible and systemic nature, 

these relationships are not an abstract abstraction. Although this higher level of 

integration requires an abstraction to be considered as such and also explained, it is 

nonetheless incredibly obvious, based in res incorporales, that we are talking about a real 

world that everyone and everything is part of. 

According to  Melot &amp;amp; Pélisse (2008) we can say that, the Earth System is still 

considered to be an unidentified legal object –resulting in a large legal black hole through 

which vital positive flows (benefits to the state of the Earth System) and negative flows 

(harm to the state of the Earth System) “disappear” as externalities. If the principle of 

disjunction in natural sciences “hid everything which connects, interacts, and interferes” 

in law, the paradigm of division “made believe that the arbitrary cut of the real was the 

real itself” (Morin 1990:17). The concept of a “system” emphasises the concept of the 

medium, that is, not only the physis as a material basis but also a mediation mechanism 

of biogeochemical cycles and thermodynamics “in which reciprocal interactions inside 

the system between the framework and its processes contribute to the regulation of 

dynamics and the maintenance of their organization, in particular thanks to feedback 

phenomena” (Lévêque 2002:40). This enables a well-defined characteristic functioning 

as a single global complex ecosystem, which in reality is a life- support system for the 

entire biosphere, including humans, on Earth. Of course, the biosphere itself is a critical 

part of the Earth System, fully integrated with the geophysical components of the system 

itself. 



 69 

The legal inexistence of the favourable state of the Earth System as an object of law 

is a structural problem that hides the most vital factors for human life and prevents the 

construction of just and equitable solutions. 

It is this vision that considers as remaining and res nullius everything that does not fit 

the concept of national sovereignty, which turns us into true free riders of the Earth 

System to which we belong and depend on, opening the doors for a collective tragedy. 

 

3.3. The Greatest Market Failure 

 

While it is true that it is materially or legally impossible to deny any human being free 

access to use of the Earth System, the enjoyment of truly common goods without any 

effective rules means that each individual is compelled to indefinitely increase his/her use 

of common resources associated with a particular state of the Earth System (e.g., the 

atmosphere with a particular concentration of constituent gases) because, if one does not 

do it, others will. All users have an incentive to increase their use without concern for the 

impact their actions may have on others (and perhaps themselves), and a disincentive in 

promoting the maintenance and improvement of the common good. 

This is the well-known tragedy of the commons model described by Hardin (1968), in 

which free and unregulated use of a common resource based on the logic of first-come, 

first-served results in a rational actor maximizing individual interest. This places the 

common resource under such pressure that it becomes degraded and eventually exhausted 

as a result of overexploitation, thus the “tragedy”. The dilemma is that if a user retracts 

his/her use and the others do not, the resource will run out in the same way and the user 

will have lost the short-term benefit that was obtained by others. 

The model is now being reproduced on a global scale, with the difference that the good 

(resource) was until recently unknown and not definable. In this global-scale model, each 

state, following its own interest, will not be concerned about limiting pollution or 

maintaining its ecosystems for the purpose of contributing to a well-functioning Earth 

System in a stable and accommodating state, as the good is freely available to be exploited 

by all. As there is no legal status for the global good, everyone uses it as res nullius, 

considering it will provide an endless stream of benefits to everyone, where their use does 

not reduce the potential for use by others (contrary to what is true of the commons). 



 70 

Incidentally, this legal black hole has also been identified by economists in the Stern 

Report: 

Climate change presents a unique challenge for economics: it is the greatest and 

widest-ranging market failure ever seen. The economic analysis must therefore be 

global, deal with long-term horizons, have the economics of risk and uncertainty at 

centre stage, and examine the possibility of major, non-marginal change. (Stern 

2006:11) 

The failure to recognize the existence of the Earth System makes nations unable to 

cope with the challenges on a planetary scale. One consequence is that all the benefits 

from, or damages to, the Earth System are legally non-existent. Without the existence of 

this common good or the identification of what is the good that presents simultaneously 

beyond and within all states but is required to be maintained in good condition for the 

functioning of the Earth System as a whole, we will not be able to turn ourselves into 

stewards of our common home. An Earth System that does not exist is a matricial failure 

and theoretical gap, which prevents filling the void that this recently recognized scientific 

reality requires. 

 

3.4. Global Free Riders... Get It While You Can 

 

At the heart of this problem are deep theoretical concepts that require some prior 

conceptual clarification on the characteristics of property, property rights and underlying 

relations. Since human relations expanded on a global scale through global systemic 

financial, economic and political interconnections (but ignored the biogeophysical 

interconnections that underpin the functioning of the Earth System), it is essential to 

realize how some of these principles of law led to the overexploitation and consequent 

tragedy of the commons. 

The right of private property confers to its owner the power to exclusively use a 

resource, even if such use is rarely done absolutely. This means that, even though an 

owner has full power over something plena in re potestas, meaning the right to use, enjoy 

and abuse a thing, ius utendi, fruendi et abutendi res sua means that he or she is limited 

by the rules of society. 



 71 

Rights to common property are held by groups of individuals, excluding access to the 

resources for all those outside the group, but considering rights and duties regarding the 

use and conservation of the resource. 

The open-access regime (res nullius), the concept of ownerless property, is completely 

non-exclusive, meaning that the access to goods/resources cannot be denied to any 

individual. In these cases, one cannot identify a group of users or owners because the 

available benefits flow to all without any, or almost any, duty regarding the use, 

preservation or maintenance of the resource. 

In economic theory, this inability to exclude any individual’s use of a good led to the 

rise of the free rider (Samuelson 1954) issue, in which any individual can benefit from a 

good without contributing to its production. An individual, following self-interest, will 

not contribute to the costs of the existence and maintenance of a good but will make use 

of its existence since it is available to everyone. The individual benefits from the principle 

of non-exclusion. 

The problem of the tragedy of commons is based on the characteristics of free access 

and the unregulated use of a natural resource, which is limited by nature. Climate change 

is a tragedy of the commons on a global scale, in which this intrinsically common good, 

which was overexploited (a characteristic stable climate of a well-defined state of the 

Earth System), is not only difficult to define and to establish boundaries around but also 

no human being can be excluded from access to it. 

In a situation where either the damage or the benefits are common, without an 

organization of collective use through a system of accounting benefits and harms, 

everyone will act as a global free rider. Therefore, this is a tragedy not of material 

resource exhaustion but of individual occupation of a certain quantity of the 

biogeophysical space of the Earth System, carried out through a change that contributes 

to destabilising the favourable, stable state of the system. In other words, pollution is a 

contribution to a change of a particular state, the healthiness of the Earth System. This 

new form of occupation does not correspond to the traditional concept of territory or a 

physical appropriation of tangible resources; rather the new reality must be recognized 

and conceptualized in order to organize the use of the Earth System. Although a 

subversive perspective of the dominant view today, the indivisible “whole” makes the 

issue of management of common goods (i.e., the Earth System) the basic fundamental 

theoretical question for all discussions on global environmental goods and possible 

alternative ways of building a sustainable society.

3.5. A Long Looking-For Period 

When we look at the pathway traced by science in perspective, the history of 

environmental civil society movements and all the high-level negotiations that have been 

taking place for many decades, we realize that along this route of searching for solutions, 

the vision that the “common” is just the leftovers after appropriation unfortunately 

continues to be the starting point from which reality is framed. However, a great effort 

by the victims of this structural failure is being made and it is imperative to continue this 

standard negotiations track, even accepting that progress in reaching a solution for our 

troubled planet has been too slow. 

Ten years after Rachel Carson published Silent Spring, a book that challenged the idea 

of the supposed capacity of the environment to absorb toxic pollutants such as agriculture 

pesticides, the 1972 United Nations Conference on Human Environment, held in 

Stockholm under the leadership of Maurice Strong, is a decisive mark on the 

sustainability timeline. While the regional pollution situation in Sweden and the 

surrounding Nordic and Central European countries achieved a particular focus, it was 

the first major step at the global level to give environmental issues a high priority. The 

creation of a sustainable development concept, with the view of integrating different 

fields of development, which until that time had been fully separated into a cohesive 

vision solving the environmental versus development dilemma, was a clear breakthrough. 

Limits to Growth, by the Club of Rome, the best-selling environmental book, was 

published in 1972, one year before the oil crisis. The type of analysis, interconnections 

and particularly the results sent a shockwave through both developed and developing 

countries. The conference led to the establishment of numerous national environmental 

protection agencies and, most importantly, the creation of the United Nations 

Environment Programme (UNEP). 

During the 1970s, while relevant international agreements such as the Convention on 

International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES) in 1975 and the 

adoption of the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution in 1979 came 

into effect, the world became acquainted with dramatic global environmental problems, 

including the discovery of the role chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) played in damaging the 

stratospheric ozone layer by Rowland and Molina in 1974, and catastrophes with a 



 73 

symbolic impact that became calls for world action like the 1978 Amoco Cadiz oil spill 

affecting the coast of Brittany in France.  

The ’80s broadened the scope of international action in different areas of the 

environment. The first World Conservation Strategy was released by the International 

Union for Conservation of Nature in 1980 with the significant subtitle: “Living Resource 

Conservation for Sustainable Development”. In the document’s foreword, it states that 

“human beings (…) must come to terms with the reality of resource limitation and the 

carrying capacities of ecosystems, and must take into account the needs of future 

generations”. At the end, the “Towards Sustainable Development” section identifies the 

main agents of habitat destruction as poverty, population pressure, social inequity and the 

terms of trade, and calls for a new international development strategy. While the 

principles were not disruptive at that time, they started to frame a vision for the next 

decades concerning the complex relationships between human beings and nature. 

The concept of the ‘common heritage of mankind’, first mentioned in a 1954 

convention related with the protection of cultural property under armed conflicts and in 

the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, achieved a greater maturity in 1982 within the United 

Nations Law of the Sea Treaty. 

In 1987, the publication of Our Common Future, or the so-called Brundtland Report, 

gave a comprehensive vision of the problems affecting the planet and the need for global 

solutions mostly through the promotion of sustainable development. 

The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de 

Janeiro in 1992 was a real breakthrough. By mobilizing an incredibly larger number of 

stakeholders and high-level representatives from all over the globe before, during, and 

after the conference, the Earth Summit or ECO/92 framed the United Nations as the 

unquestionable international core for further advances on the implementation of solutions 

for a safer planet with a better quality of life. The publication of Agenda 21, the signature 

of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Framework Convention on Climate 

Change, the Rio Declaration plus a statement of non-binding Forest Principles probably 

turned the event into the most important political mark on the sustainable development 

timeline. The parallel non-governmental organization Forum also added a set of 

alternative strategies and visions relevant in the framing of a critical view compared to 

the less ambitious, slow, and sometimes painful negotiation track along the formal venues 

of the United Nations. 



 74 

Throughout the 1990s, two major challenges should be highlighted as crucial steps for 

a better understanding of the international framework concerning sustainable 

development and the most important global long-term problem for humanity that is 

climate change. The beginning of the Conferences of the Parties, after the entry into force 

of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995 

and the further signature of the Kyoto Protocol by 1997, and all the preparatory work for 

the approval of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by 2000, where world 

leaders agreed to a set of time-bound and measurable goals for combating poverty, 

hunger, disease, illiteracy, environmental degradation and discrimination against women, 

to be achieved by 2015. 

In 2000, after a decade of global cross-cultural dialogue on common goals and shared 

values, the Earth Charter was launched. It began as a United Nations initiative but it was 

then developed through the involvement of the global civil society, currently with the 

endorsement of more than 6,000 organizations. The Earth Charter proposes an ethical 

framework for building a just, sustainable and peaceful global society for the 21st century. 

With 16 principles, the Charter emphasises the need to respect and care for the community 

of life along the first four principles, with a statement (principle 2a) that frames a 

relationship between humans and the rest of nature: “Accept that with the right to own, 

manage, and use natural resources comes the duty to prevent environmental harm and to 

protect the rights of people.” 

During the first decade of the 21st century, another paradigm should also be noted – 

the relationship between the intensive work of more than 3,000 experts from the 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change between science and forecasted policy 

scenarios, and all the negotiations towards the mitigation and adaptation to climate 

change, clearly deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize awarded in 2007. 

 

3.6. The Inevitable Global and Multiple Approach 

 

Even admitting that the negotiations pathway will gradually convey better 

approximations of a solution, the structural problem still exists, making inevitable a 

confrontation where “sovereignty defies reality” (Brunnée 1998). This author, in a paper 

about the conflicts between sovereignty and water management and the difficulties of 

international law in dealing with shared resources, states that 



 75 

 My contention is simple: International Water Law, and States, will not meet the 

“challenges of water” until the reality of interdependence is addressed in its full 

complexity. This means that international environmental law and international 

water law must become integrated to treat water for what it is: a component of the 

environment. From this integration, in turn, must emerge a concept of sovereignty 

that reflects rather than defies environmental reality. 

With the knowledge we have today of the Earth System, a division between the water 

component and the other system components is not sound but the statement is still valid 

on the need for sovereignty to reflect the environmental reality. 

It has become obvious that solutions are necessary. Within the political framework 

architecture of existing institutions, we must consider that without a new theoretical 

approach able to support a new global paradigm for the management of the commons 

within an international landscape characterised by the multiplication of territorial units, 

it will be impossible to avoid the effects of a congenital degeneration. 

In this context, the preliminary works concerning the ecological footprint, a first 

quantifiable and integrated analysis at a global scale, date from the beginning of the ’90s 

in the last century. It was more recently, in 2006, that the standardization of this 

instrument has enabled it to evaluate and compare activities, countries and regions 

worldwide. The ecological footprint enables us to measure the human demand on nature 

and evaluate the availability of resources in a constrained world that is becoming more 

and more populated.  

The footprint represents both the asset side through biocapacity, the planet’s renewable 

resources such as biologically productive land areas including our forests, pastures, 

cropland and fisheries, and a demand side, with humanity’s consumption of natural 

resources. 

Upon reaching 2015, the target date of the Millennium Development Goals, the United 

Nations took an important broader step, adopting in this same year the 17 sustainable 

development goals (SDGs). Considered a consequence of the Rio+20 outcome document 

“The Future We Want”, an inclusive and transparent intergovernmental process on SDGs 

opened to all stakeholders, with a view to developing global sustainable development 

goals. Ending poverty and hunger go hand in hand with the need to ensure sustainable 

consumption and production patterns; take urgent action to combat climate change and 

its impacts; conserve and promote a sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine 



 76 

resources; protect, restore and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems; 

sustainably manage forests; combat desertification; and halt and reverse land degradation 

and biodiversity loss. 

Therefore, and with a deep description of the historical application and usefulness of 

tracking sustainable development, new guiding principles for assessment system 

indicators are suggested throughout this book. 

However, the ecological footprint does not account for certain key thresholds within 

our biophysical system, the so-called planetary boundaries (Steffen et al. 2015a; 

Rockström et al. 2009) that correspond to biogeophysical features of the geological period 

in the Holocene. This intangible structure that defines the favourable state of the Earth 

System is referred to by the scientific community as the “safe operating space for 

humanity”, a space without territory, a true natural res incorporales that is simultaneously 

inside and outside all sovereignties, that through the cumulative pressure of humanity 

may drive the Earth System to an undesirable state. 

This new known reality, this true environmental grundnorm, therefore, should be the 

basis for any positive law of general acceptance and reasonableness (Rakhyun &amp;amp; 

Bosselmann 2013). The ULO, unidentified legal object, (Melot &amp;amp; Pélisse 2008), could 

now have a set of parameters and guidelines that define its stability and existence. 

While science is key for evaluating the progress towards a more sustainable planet, the 

daily reality embraces long worldwide negotiations, with thousands of negotiators talking 

(more than defining) a set of policies on multiple dimensions, including the economy, 

society, the environment, and other aspects such as governance. 

Departing from the “current system of nation-state based governance is inadequate for 

tackling such issues as climate change-induced global warming, pandemic diseases and 

other threats to human security and prosperity”2, this book conveys the idea of an Earth 

Condominium model, and a new global trusteeship as a paradigm shift necessary to 

overcome the difficulties the United Nations has had in the last decades to achieve a better 

and planetary outcome concerning different environmental- related matters. Indeed, the 

perception of informed citizens worldwide is that the UN has not been able to deliver the 

necessary commitments, measures and actions to tackle many of the issues agreed on 

within the sustainable development area. However, it is completely unrealistic to rapidly 

change the modus operandi of this planetary institution. Even though we are far from the 

desired goals, one has to recognize that the negotiations have been progressing with some 

relevant achievements. The alternative to bilateral or group country agreements would 



 77 

increase the dictatorship of the will of a few countries, extending the already existing 

unnecessary divisions. 

In fact, the high complexity of the climate change issue makes science and technical 

expertise conveyed through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change almost as 

determinant as political will. 

The extensive accumulation of negotiation knowledge and consensus, including the 

signature of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, with all the accessory mechanisms including the 

clean development mechanism, joint implementation, and emission trading between 

countries, involved a huge process of approval, tracking, and monitoring that is not 

common to other UN conventions. 

The pathway where long-frozen concepts, such as the so-called “firewall” that has 

been dividing countries into two major groups – developed and the developing, which 

have been questioned since greenhouse gas emission targets have had to be applied to a 

much larger number of countries in the post-2020 era, is a paradigm of crucial importance 

that the negotiations are trying to finally overcome. 

The future has to incorporate a combination of strategies, where champion countries 

have to lead the way and engage other countries, and where multilateral negotiations have 

to unfold and at least partially meet the objectives considered necessary for the 

minimization of impacts on humanity and ecosystems. Simultaneously, a new legal 

paradigm where the “commons” are the basis of a new configuration of the relationships 

between the countries is vital, and should be implemented within a medium or long-term 

perspective in a parallel but active process that should start as soon as possible. A 

pragmatic perspective would be the one that takes into account the current real politic but 

at the same time acknowledges the huge theoretical challenge to law to convey a 

favourable state of “healthiness” of the Earth System which it is not restricted to the 

global commons but also spans across areas subject to national jurisdiction (Borg 2007). 

A complementary strategy that does not stop or close the ongoing negotiation 

processes but shifts and integrates them within a new conceptual framework is the 

challenge embraced by this book. Only a truly accepted agreement can be both binding 

and implemented and, therefore, successful.

3.7. The Double Tragedy and Double Challenge 

 

The work of Hardin generated pessimism around the “common”, turning common 

property management into a failure. The failure deepens when even those who genuinely 

care about future sustainability and the common good come to the conclusion that the 

restriction of exploitation of the resource will lead to a comparative economic loss. This 

is an altruistic feeling that will lead to a self-elimination of the agents, resulting from a 

natural selection process. This logic is valid not only for the exploitation of the resource 

but also applies to the benefits that can be realized in maintaining/improving the common 

good. 

In the context of the Earth System, one can designate the current situation as a dual 

tragedy: 

On one hand, the classical tragedy of exploitation embodied in the destabilisation 

of the relatively stable Holocene state of the Earth System by unregulated resource 

exploitation and pollution; 

On the other hand, and using the Roman Source/resource analysis, as no country 

will enjoy just for itself all the benefits provided from its own sources of the 

resource (ecological/geophysical infrastructure) in the state of Earth System 

(common resource), there are no advantages in promoting actions to maintain the 

Earth System in a stable state. As there is no incentive for individual initiatives to 

maintain or improve the sources of common good, in the context of competition 

and legal and economic shortcomings in managing a common resource, it is normal 

to allow the degradation of the sources to sell raw materials or to obtain other 

economic gains, since the vital benefits provided by the sources of the common 

resource are worth zero as they are still shared by all on a global scale. 

The logic of the tragedy of the commons is doubly valid for the exhaustion of the 

resource and for the destruction of the sources of the resource, “the ecological 

infrastructure” that can deliver benefits to all societies. The short-term logic will prevail 

unless structural measures that have the ability to change these initial conditions and 

generate new systemic collaborative effects are implemented. The logic of the tragedy of 

the commons undoubtedly depends on a set of assumptions related to the motivation of 



 79 

people operating under rules governing the use of the common and defining the very 

nature of the resource. 

A pragmatic approach to this dual challenge has to be necessarily innovative. This 

implies a structural intervention in the framework basics of the sovereign international 

system, which allows the benefits achieved in the state of the Earth System, which 

currently economically disappear into a black legal hole, to have economic visibility 

through an accounting system and compensation for the “stewardship of the Earth 

System”. For this structural change to become possible, it is necessary that the global 

benefits made by the “common resource”, which is the Earth System in a favourable state, 

are caught in a global legal instrument. 

 

Figure 4. A comparison of the existing and proposed Earth System 

management regimes 

 

With the work of Elinor Ostrom and the recognition of the Nobel Prize awarded to her, 

the commons are no longer an impossibility. For Ostrom (2010:28) “the crucial factor 

will be a combination of structural features that lead many involved to trust each other, 

and are willing to take joint action that adds value to their own short-term costs because 

both see a long-term benefit for themselves and others, believing that most others will 

comply”. This building of trust and reciprocity, as she claims, requires structural features. 

We argue that the first structural feature in organizing the collective use of a common 

resource is to define the resource to be managed, and to recognize that it has to exist.

Once identified, the natural res incorporales state of the Earth System, although 

physically inappropriable can be managed. Hugo Grotius (1916) however defends an 

exception: If any part of these things is by nature susceptible of occupation, it may 

become the property of the one who occupies it but only in so far as such occupation does 

not affect its common use. 

Ostrom (2010:36) also acknowledged that “it is obviously much easier to build 

solutions for collective action problems related to small-scale resources than for those 

related to a global common good.” Despite the magnitude of the challenge, there is no 

other feasible alternative. This is the approach that we will explore throughout this book.

Chapter 4 

A New Object of Law – Attempt for a Legal Construction 
 

Let’s not pretend that things will change if we keep doing the same things. A crisis can be a real 
blessing to any person, to any nation. For all crises bring progress. Creativity is born from anguish, 
just like the day is born from the dark night. It’s in crisis that inventiveness is born, as well as 
discoveries are made and big strategies are created. He who overcomes crisis, overcomes himself, 
without getting overcome. He who blames his failure on a crisis neglects his own talent and is more 
interested in problems than in solutions. Incompetence is the true crisis. The greatest inconvenience 
of people and nations is the laziness with which they attempt to find the solutions to their problems. 
There’s no challenge without a crisis. Without challenges, life becomes a routine, a slow agony. 
There’s no merit without crisis. It’s in the crisis where we can show the very best in us. Without a 
crisis, any wind becomes a tender touch. To speak about a crisis is to promote it. Not to speak about 
it is to exalt conformism. Let us work hard instead. Let us stop, once and for all, the menacing crisis 
that represents the tragedy of not being willing to overcome it. 

 Albert Einstein 

 

4.1. A Theoretical Gap 

 
According to Nietzsche, "There are no facts, only interpretations". This means that 

knowledge of facts is no substitute for their comprehension. 

The exponential increase in the knowledge about the Earth System does not 

necessarily mean we understand it in all its dimensions, particularly in terms of all the 

consequences this new reality entails. Still, albeit somewhat unconsciously, the increasing 

ability to intervene and change the state of the Earth System as a whole is moving us from 

the role of passive spectators towards actors capable of changing the plot itself. We are 

now in the driving seat (Rockström 2014), but it seems that despite having access to the 

command centre, we don't have a social organization to define who and how to use the 

“central computer” (Matos 2016:28) that would allow us to conduct our own behaviour 

in respect of Spaceship Earth (Fuller 1969). 

If from a technological perspective we are able to overcome and manipulate Spaceship 

Earth at all levels, the crew doesn't have the internal organization that allows collective 



 82 

action to handle its operation. We have never been so vulnerable with respect to the level 

of social organization. 

In nature, where more remains hidden than is revealed, the unexplainable “whole” that 

surrounds us has been delineated by sets of rites, myths, beliefs and concepts that 

established order amongst ideas and name the unnameable: Mother Nature, Mother 

Earth, the Great Machine, goddess Gaia, the law of nature, living space, ecological 

space, life-support system. They are all forms for what we today call the Earth System. 

Throughout the history of science, properties and behaviours of different components 

of the Earth System have been analysed on different physical, material and biological 

levels. However, the higher, more intangible and diffuse levels of interconnection and 

global systemic integration remained in our mental sphere, hidden as the true terra 

incognita. Even if laboratory analyses allow us to interpret the unseen and incorporeal 

character of natural phenomena, a problem arises with the attempt to comprehend them 

on a global scale, integrated within the true system, the “whole”. For example, carbon 

dioxide (CO2) and its role in the biochemical process of photosynthesis are well known, 

but its effects at higher concentrations in the atmosphere and the consequences of its 

interaction with other elements were perceived only recently. Neither the “global” nor the 

“whole” fit in any laboratory or suit the process of delimitation and precision required by 

legal norms. 

First, human activity operates at the lower level of the Earth System (material, 

physical, biological), that is, at the level of exploitation of resources and ecological 

infrastructure. It not only disturbs the dynamics and interdependencies at the level of 

activity but also at a higher level of the Earth System, provoking chemical changes in the 

atmosphere and hydrosphere, initiating a process of manipulation of the pattern of order. 

So, for the first time, anthropogenic impacts affected the Earth System as a whole, 

regardless of whether they happened at only the lower level of the Earth System. The 

unified and interdependent character, and the properties of the global system, began to 

unravel through the feedback from the higher levels of integration of the Earth System. 

That initiated an interpretation of the laws of the “whole” which could not be understood 

from the behaviour of its components only. 

In fact, the ‘whole’ is organized from the molecule up to the biosphere, and at each 

level of integration, characteristics emerge which cannot be analysed based only on 

mechanisms that explain lower levels of integration. This phenomenon, known as 



 83 

emergence, corresponds to the appearance of new characteristics at combined levels 

and which do not exist at the level of its constituting elements. (Filipe, Coelho &amp;amp; 

Ferreira 2007:125) 

The characteristic behaviour of the whole cannot be derived, even in theory, from the 

most complete possible knowledge of the behaviour of its components, whether 

considered individually or in other combined proportions or organizations. 

Emergence can also be seen as a process in which “spontaneous” order is displayed 

from within the system. It is when different elements are allowed to combine, that 

they form patterns and interactions between them. When they lose their established 

rational order, entering into a situation of unstructured chaos, a new structure may 

emerge. (Miller &amp;amp; Swinney 2001:22) 

The Earth System is a complex one within which there are different levels of 

functioning and interaction. The pattern resulting from millennia of slow interactions 

between the various components of the Earth System produced a biochemical structure 

corresponding to a single period of climate stability: the Holocene. This spontaneous 

emergence of an order produced emergent phenomena that contributed equally to the 

consolidation of that pattern of a well-buffered stability that works inside an “envelope 

of natural variability” (Steffen et al. 2004:336). These reciprocal interactions of 

teleconnections, retroactions and feedbacks led to a complex and dialectical system, 

which resulted in a favourable condition for the development of human civilizations. 

The number of such phenomena is immense, and only by an analysis of the 

interconnections on a global scale can we begin to lift the veil of their incredible 

complexity. One of the most interesting phenomena, in that by its domino effect it could 

be a determining factor in maintaining the current state of the Earth System, is the 

transport of dust between the Sahara and Amazon (NASA &amp;amp; Garner 2015). From the 

Sahara desert and, with more intensity, the Bodélé Depression in Chad, an ancient lake 

rockbed composed of dead microorganisms loaded with phosphorus, around 182 million 

tons (the equivalent of 689,290 semi-trucks full) of dust are transported each year by the 

wind, travelling 1,600 miles across the Atlantic, though some drops to the surface or is 

flushed from the sky by rain. 

Near the eastern coast of South America, at longitude 35W, 132 million tons remain 

in the air, and 27.7 million tons (enough to fill 104,908 semi-trucks) fall to the surface 



 84 

over the Amazon basin. It fertilises the basin decisively, maintaining that dense green 

mass, which, in turn, with its 600 billion trees and an extraordinary sophisticated process, 

pumps 20 billion tons of water daily into the atmosphere (larger trees pump about 1000 

litres/day of water), and injects 17 billion cubic metres of water containing a high 

concentration of organic matter into the ocean (one-fifth of all the fresh water that reaches 

the oceans). Amazingly, deserts are crucial to life in the oceans and global climate 

regulation. With this dialectic chain of emergences, we realize the interdependent whole 

of the entire system. In its higher level of integration, as stated by Hongbin Yu,5 “This is 

a small world … we're all connected together”. 

Only recently has visualizing this example become possible, allowing us to 

comprehend the unimaginable potential chain of interconnections and teleconnections on 

which we depend, and that we are influencing by inducing changes in the preconditions 

that maintain the status of the system. 

The changes in some of the initial conditions in the pattern of stability in the system 

corresponding with the Holocene period, for example the increase in CO2 concentrations 

(and consequent changes in heat accumulation, global thermodynamics and feedbacks 

produced by climate change), allowed us to “open the book” on the dynamics and 

interdependencies that occur at the higher level of the Earth System.  

The Great Acceleration3 by the human enterprise started in the middle of the twentieth 

century with an increase in the exploitation of resources and ecological infrastructures – 

“The speeding up of just about everything after the Second World War … sometimes 

called the Great Acceleration… human population has tripled, but the global economy 

and material consumption have grown many times faster” (Hibbard et al. 2006:342). It 

created such fundamental changes in the state and functioning of the Earth System that it 

is designated as the end date for the Holocene period and the start date for the 

Anthropocene. 

The tsunami caused by the changes in the dynamic natural pattern is overwhelming 

the social and economic systems to such an extent that it calls for a questioning and re-

evaluation of many of the fundamental ideas upon which the Great Acceleration was built. 

Although urgent, we have not yet been able to go the required distance from which to 

                                                
5 Hongbin Yu, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Maryland who works at NASA's Goddard Space Flight 
Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is lead author of the study about dust transport, with data collected by a lidar 
instrument on NASA's Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation, or CALIPSO, satellite from 
2007 through 2013.

perform a critical analysis of these facts, their scientific interpretation, and their 

implications for international relations and the social, political and economic realms. 

Although restricted to an academic level, the discussion on the de-territorialised and 

globalised reality in which we now live has created a situation in which everything is 

being questioned. Garcia (2010:15), in her analysis about the fragmentation of the state 

sovereignty, identified many authors who address this issue: 

There are authors who question whether we need to abandon the concept of the 

State (Heiko Faber), those that claim that the Modern State has ceased to exist 

(Wolfgang Reinhold), those who ask “why do we still talk of the State?” (Peter 

Saladin), or those who claim that there is an incompatibility between globalisation 

and sovereign States (Thomas Vesting). There are even those who assert that the 

national State no longer guarantees peace, freedom, security, protection of human 

rights and the environment (Julianne Kokott). 

Ruggie (1993:139) argues that scholars of international relations are not very good ... 

at studying the possibility of fundamental discontinuity in the international system; that 

is, at addressing the question of whether the modern system of States may be yielding in 

some instances to post-modern forms of congaing political space. We lack even an 

adequate vocabulary; and what we cannot describe, we cannot explain. 

In a fully globalised world, connected through biophysical interactions between people 

and nations at social and economic levels, several fundamental premises of the 

Westphalian system of sovereign states have changed. The change is so deep that even 

words, until today unquestionable in the description of these situations, such as the word 

“international”, have become obsolete in the attempt to capture the totality of social 

relations that cross the boundaries of states. 

The growing importance of non-State actors involved in social interactions beyond 

State boundaries, regional and global structures, and the improvement in the efficiency 

of international norms, resulted in terms such as “transnationalism” and “globalism”. 

These new terms are responses to the inadequacy of the term 'international' to depict 

observed empirical phenomena, making the 'international' an unsatisfactory analytical (or 

indeed epistemological) category to describe global society. Thus understood, the 

'international' might be seen as a description of social structures that have lost much of 

their relevance in the wake of increasing de-nationalisation through trans-nationalisation 

or globalisation. (Albert 2007:48)

Disturbances we create in the pattern of Holocene stability, combined with the new 

technologies available, make visible the higher level of integration of the Earth System. 

The awareness of this new reality and the knowledge of the consequences created the new 

globalised context, where everything changes. It is even normal to resort to “problem 

words” (Morin 2007) and not “solution words”, as in the case of the word “complexity”. 

In this sense, several authors resort to “complex sovereignty” (Magalhães 2007:88; Pauly 

&amp;amp; Grande 2007:3) to define what otherwise could not be named in the confrontation 

between evolution of social-ecological reality and the concept of sovereignty. 

Edgar Morin (1990:8) explains in his “complex thought” that “complexity cannot be 

reduced to a single master word, law or simple idea. In other words, the complex cannot 

be reduced to a law or idea of complexity. It cannot be something easy to define, thereby 

taking the place of simplicity”. In other words, calling complexity “complex” does not 

solve the problem with which we are confronted. 

Even on the short human temporal scale, the Great Acceleration was short and recent. 

Its feedbacks carry with them impertinent and subversive questions that pressure the 

existing social system and its assumptions. Answering them implies a radical change in 

theoretical perspectives. 

The facts exist: the Earth System functions as an interdependent “global whole” in the 

way it has always functioned in its different states throughout its history – what does not 

yet exist is a theory able to first represent the world beyond the nation-state and then 

allocate a place to what is the higher level of integration of the Earth System. Since there 

is no interpretation capable of representing this global reality within our system of social 

organization, we continue to act as if that reality does not exist. 

Nietzsche, therefore, is correct in his statement, the point here being that the legitimacy 

of interpretation lies in its capacity to explain reality; in other words, its ability to reflect 

and understand the actual situation in the world. The legitimacy of a discourse resides in 

the explanatory power of reality, so that legitimacy erodes to the extent that its inadequacy 

to reflect the real situation in the world increases. In every area where the discourse of 

sovereignty has lost its ability to accurately portray the facts, it is precisely at the gap 

between theorization of reality and the actual reality of the ecological dynamic of the 

biosphere that this loss of legitimacy becomes clear (Camilleri and Falk 1992). 

Without a theory able to interpret the facts raised by the global and interdependent 

reality of the Earth System, we will continue to live an illusion that tries to fit new facts 

into an old interpretation. 



 87 

In this context, it is no surprise that the majority of reactions to environmental 

disruption caused by the Great Acceleration are limited to interventions in the periphery 

of the social system. We classified this “looking-for period” as the first generation of 

environmental law, with modest intervention in human relationships, that is, we relied on 

long lists of prohibitions without intervening in the primary drivers of the system or 

properly understanding the huge theoretical challenge. 

Even without the scientific information needed to unravel some of the contours of the 

new circumstances that impose themselves on law, Amaral (1994:17) understood the 

structural and systemic nature of the challenge being faced. 

Environmental law is a primary branch of law, born not to regulate the relations 

amongst humans but to try to insert discipline in the relationship between humans 

and nature. ... before the eyes of humanity, a new era has been unravelling, we may 

actually even be entering into a new civilization. ... It is why this new civilization 

has begun to generate its Law – a new type of Law. Environmental Law is not just 

another specialised and technical branch, but requires a whole new philosophy that 

shapes the way we look at Law. 

 

4.2. The Legal Nebula 

 
Defining the outlines of reality upon which to build environmental law is conditioned 

by the possibility of knowing what is to be protected; in other words, by the ability to 

define and delimit the quid to be put under the scope (protection) of the law. 

The transmutation of the “environment” from a slightly relevant social interest into an 

authentic legal good, with a value per se, added a profound new meaning: The 

“environment” shall be protected as a value by itself, and not as it was previously – that 

is, merely the causal path of damage. 

Previously, for law, damage to the environment only existed when it caused damage 

to people or goods. With the new formulation, damage is perceived as disturbance of an 

autonomous and unitary legal interest it allows, immediately, to draw – based on 

axiological ordering of the subject of injury – the distinction between damage to the 

environment as a legal good [ecological damage] and the damage caused to people and 



 88 

property by environmental disturbances (environmental damage, Umweltschäden, 

Milieuschäden). (Cunhal 2002:40) 

The autonomy of the environment as a legal good, with a value per se, is one of the 

major conceptual achievements made along the path of legal protection for the 

environment. Despite several national and international legal systems adopting this 

recognition, during this looking-for period, there was no scientific knowledge available 

that would enable us to understand the facts, the quid, with which jurists were faced. This 

lack of knowledge and the impossibility of defining the environmental good within 

existing paradigms made these new questions impertinent. “The subversive impulse of 

environmental law” was what Canotilho (2009:2) called this structural incompatibility. 

In our view, the subversion of law by the environment is based on three fundamental scale 

preconditions: 

• The global scale of the good intended to be captured under the scope of law, 

and the impossibility of establishing any kind of material or abstract legal 

division of the "environmental good” (geographic scale); 

• The cumulative and intergenerational character of the damages on and benefits 

caused by this “environmental good” (time scale); 

• The restrictive and limiting approach of environmental law towards an 

economic system conceived on unlimited growth on a planet with limited 

resources (economic/ecological scale). 

 

On the way to representing the environment as a legal good, states found they needed 

to capture and create a narrative able to interpret something that had always had a local 

and a global dimension, diffuse and indeterminate. Some states searched the “whole” 

within their own boundaries and eventually arrived at the understanding of the unitary 

character of the environment. Departing from the principle of territoriality of norms and 

political power, it appears that this unitary character referred to a national context, even 

though there was already an empirical perception that this unit referred in fact to the larger 

whole, the global. But due to a lack of legal representation of the true scale of the legal 

good in question, the “environment” had to adapt itself to political borders. 

The attempt to define the global on a local scale quickly became ineffective. In the 

National Environmental Performance Report on Planetary Boundaries of the Swedish 

Environmental Protection Agency (Nykvist, Persson, Moberg, Persson, Cornell, &amp;amp; 



 89 

Rockström 2013:3), it is stated that “Sweden is exposed to environmental impacts from 

other countries which affect Sweden’s ability to achieve these environmental quality 

objectives. At the same time, Swedish consumption and production have an impact on 

environmental performance in other countries”. International organizations such as the 

EU do recognize this global dependency: “Even though we have never used our natural 

resources with so much efficiency as we do at present, we are still degrading our essential 

resources ... in Europe as well as in the rest of the world, and in the environmental field, 

borders do not exist” (SOER 2015). 

These structural genetic defects gave rise to a process of relativism and de-

legitimization of the legal good. The result was a dysfunctional congenital degeneration: 

a) the legal weight of “ecological footprints turned out to be unsupportable by 

the jus utendi, fruendi et abutendi of property and sovereignty (Canotilho 

2009:2); 

b) the cumulative character and global spread of harm over the course of various 

generations, and protection of rights without subjects (namely future 

generations); 

c) the causal link between the acts that harm the systemic character of the 

environmental damage and affect all the Earth System, whose effects only 

reveal themselves much later; 

d) the global dispersion of benefits of ecosystem services; 

e) the idea of polygonal relations extended to a global scale, within a context of 

plural responsibility; 

f) the tipping points resulting from the accumulation of damage caused over the 

course of various generations; 

g) interconnections between different territorial components divided by abstract 

political frontiers; 

h) the imposition of limits and environmental obligations as generators of 

unequal competing conditions on a global scale; and 



 90 

i) the legitimacy problem of instituting legal proceedings, civil society or class 

actions. 

All things considered, there was more than enough reason to reject this first-generation 

branch of environmental law. Incompatibility with the assumptions of the system gave 

rise to a phenomenon which is referred to in specialised literature as Vollzug Defizit, the 

implementation deficit (Hucke &amp;amp; Wollmann 1998), or enforcement deficit. It came to 

characterise environmental law due to a) an exponential proliferation of norms and 

standards; b) the manipulated application with intent to restrict its scope; c) the systemic 

deferral while awaiting regulation; and d) outright failure to apply norms. Prieur 

(187:320) considered it a “diffuse form of deregulation” while Charbonneau (1998) 

speaks of a de-legitimization of environmental law and Carbonnier raises the hypothesis 

of No-Law. 

But as paradoxical as it may seem, even when rejected, this quid referent to a 

healthiness environment did in fact invoke a qualitative change in the fundamental goals 

of states. That is so because it did not cease to represent a value superior to those the law 

aims to protect, both from an individual or collective point of view. 

This deep material foundation, as a vital dimension of life and the human species, is 

not just a constitutionally guaranteed right in about 125 constitutions (Bosselmann 

2016:72); it is even being considered a hypothesis that would lead to the emergence of a 

new type of state, a post-social state (Silva 1989), or a successor to the welfare state, an 

environmental law state (Rangel 1994). 

The entry of the environment into the core fundamental objectives and tasks of the 

states as a collective legal good and/or fundamental right of each individual citizen also 

raised procedural questions of legitimacy in court or when participating in administrative 

procedures. 

Various states (mainly Portuguese-speaking countries), challenged by a reality not 

reflected in their spatial dimension, sought to develop a theory through “problem words” 

that were better able to portray the diluted and diffuse reality that conditioned them. The 

“theory of diffuse interests” at the basis of class action (in Portuguese Ação Popular) 

teaches us that when legal goods are involved, such as the environment, consumption or 

quality of life, "they belong to all of us and can never be allocated exclusively to any 

subject. It means that the diffuse interests include at the same time a collective and 

individual dimension, neither being merely collective, nor merely individual" (Sousa 



 91 

1998). Cappelletti (1975) expresses the other side of the coin: they belong "to everyone 

and no one". 

But the all-encompassing scale of diffuse interests, once again, cannot be limited to a 

single community belonging to a particular state but only to humanity as a collective in 

the trans-spatial dimension, such as “the entire human race, being the combination of all 

human beings that inhabit the planet” (Santos 200:68), and in a trans-temporal dimension, 

in the sense of the collective ad infinitum, including all human beings that will succeed 

the current living generation at a given time (Malhotra 1998:41). Each generation thus 

becomes “a link in an endless chain of generations that collectively forms a community, 

a human family” (Agius 1998:7). This has led to a doctrine that defends the emergence 

of a new subject in international law: humanity; a true “revolution in social and legal 

thought” (Agius 1998:7). 

The combination of the “whole” and “everyone” may be the biggest challenge that the 

law will face in this century. The uncertainty exists not only around the good intended to 

come under the law’s protection but also around the identification of the holders of this 

diffuse good, therefore the nebula broadens to the international dimension. 

The UN General Assembly Resolution 43/53 Protection of Global Climate for Present 

and Future Generations of Mankind of 6 December, 1988, with a combination of lack of 

political will and an absence of suitable concepts to define a fundamental resource, state 

that "climate change on Earth and its adverse effects are a common concern of mankind". 

This solution has roots in concepts such as common interest, global commons, 

intergenerational equity, responsibility or rights, common ecological heritage of 

humankind, life-support system and “the awareness that the problems of ocean space are 

closely interrelated and need to be considered as a whole” (UNCLOS 1982)6. They all 

share the difficulty of defining their form in a precise manner. 

So we arrive at a point where all contradictions and paradoxes of the legal nebula are 

possible, especially when “problem words” blend into “concern words” through 

indeterminate, merely descriptive, neutral and open concepts. It can easily lead to the 

“whole” being synonymous for nothing and nobody. “International law itself was (and to 

a certain extent remains) ill-equipped to address state activities affecting negatively an 

intangible natural resource which spans across and beyond the national territories of 

states” (Borg 2009:1). 

                                                
 



 92 

 

4.3. The “Whole” Problem 

 
The reality of the “whole” disappears in the political map of state boundaries. 

However, if the “whole” exists in a higher level of functioning and integration of the 

Earth System, is it or is it not possible to represent this new reality beyond the states? 

Starting from the first two elements that gave rise to structural incompatibility, 

geographic scale and time scale, which carried with them the subversion introduced into 

the law by the "environment", and recent developments in our knowledge on the 

functioning of the Earth System, we will work on a possible evolution of these still 

embryonic and inefficient formulations of legal concerns from an actual vague and 

indeterminate formula into an operational legal instrument, giving shape to rights and 

duties. 

Expressions such as “life-sustaining systems of the biosphere” (United Nations 1992), 

“conservation of climate as part of the common heritage of mankind” (United Nations 

1988), or that “the problems of the ocean space are closely interrelated and need to be 

considered as a whole” (UNCLOS 1982) presented in different texts of international law 

are themselves attempts to approach the biogeophysical foundations at the basis of the 

emergence of life and the conditions that allowed the development of human civilization. 

It is clear that these merely descriptive concepts are not rooted in a set of criteria that 

offer the possibility of measurement or delimitation that would allow us to define a legal 

object; that is, to define the concept and its amplitude, distinguishing it for all other legal 

goods but also matching the unitary global reality of the “environment”. 

The word system in the term life-sustaining systems of the biosphere points back to the 

empirical idea of a combination of various interrelated and interacting components, out 

of which emerges a whole that is more than the sum of its components. However, this 

reference to general concepts, without proceeding to a description of criteria that could 

be used to delimit a physical space in which the system operates or the mention of an 

indicator that provides us with information on the system state, once again reveals how 

unspecified concepts rule the environmental nebula. 

The phrase conservation of climate as part of the common heritage of mankind, 

although referring to the initial proposal of the Maltese initiative and is included as such 

in the text of this resolution of the UN General Assembly, does not refer to a specific and 



 93 

particular good but rather to a set of interconnected goods that shape a system with a 

specific functionality inherited from Mother Nature. This heritage is the integration of the 

geophysical properties of the planet with the living biosphere that forms a single global 

system as the result of an evolutionary process of interaction. 

Even the expression whole carries with it a systemic idea. It means that, as in the 

preamble of UNCLOS (1982)7 where the necessity to manage “ocean space” is 

recognized, it refers not to the geographical and political space made up by the sum of 

the different areas of state jurisdiction and high seas but rather to the necessity to elaborate 

on problems related to the use of the oceans as a whole, taking into account the ocean 

environment as an integrated fluid ecological system. Though still empirical in nature, 

the perception exists that all these concepts direct us towards the notion of a system. The 

question of how we can build a legal concept relating to a system not tied to any territorial 

delimitation, since in environmental matters the system is global, remains unanswered. 

What are these life-sustaining systems of the biosphere, the biosphere being an object 

that is not confined to any sovereignty, existing both in and outside all sovereignties? We 

can all perceive it intuitively but we cannot touch or appropriate it, even though it is 

profoundly related to and dependent on the physical nature placed under the jurisdiction 

of the different states of the planet. What is ocean space as a whole, which apparently 

transcends every sea, ocean or jurisdiction but does not materialize in a geographical 

dimension? What is this natural heritage that belongs to the time continuum of all 

successive generations, carrying with it interests shared with the unborn, and which 

should not be mixed with the territorial space that belongs to the people amongst whom 

they will be born? 

The first jump into the unknown will focus on both the dysfunctional relationship 

between the reductionist physicist or biological approach of law towards nature and the 

intangible geophysical realities that determine the state and functioning of the Earth 

System. 

It seems to us that the key to establishing order in our interpretation, as we construct 

legal abstractions in regard to nature, lies in the recognition of different analytical levels. 

As Soromenho-Marques (2006:57) observes in relation to the immaterial heritage, “it also 

matters here to avoid reductionism of a physicist or biological nature, we should today 

avoid the repetition of an old debate that ran through the 17th and 18th centuries on the 

                                                
 



 94 

nature of matter, as the Newtonian theory of the Universe was presented. During this 

period, the Cartesians rejected the theory of gravitational force as they considered it 

"miraculous". For them, the category of material force should always be characterised by 

direct transmission through physical contact. We cannot make the same mistake 

concerning the heritage. In fact there exist other types of heritage beyond those that can 

be seen or touched.” 

In this search for the environmental legal good, the law has already had to face realities 

that go beyond our sensory capacity and had the necessity to broaden to the notion of 

system and ecosystem functions, which have already been recognized in some legal 

orders, particularly the European Union (Comissão Europeia, 2000). Although these 

evolutions are attempts to theorize reality and produce a more adequate representation of 

the systemic character of environmental goods, we do not yet have a concept able to 

represent the true scale of these biogeophysical interconnections that extended human 

relations on a global scale. 

We find ourselves in a stalemate. On one hand, if we advance with the search for this 

environmental legal good within the geographical limits of states, we obtain an ecological 

nonsense,5 inevitably amputated and dysfunctional. On the other hand, if we approach the 

Earth System on its true scale of biogeophysical relationships, we will collide with the 

geographic delimitation of sovereignties and the lack of the political and legal existence 

of the entire Earth System, and therefore arrive at a completely dysfunctional relationship 

between the Earth System and the social system. 

The awareness of the different internal dynamic levels of the Earth System and its 

dependence on the core drivers at the origin of a structural pattern that produced a unique 

period of climatic stability in the history of the planet (the Holocene) could determine the 

name and define what kind of environmental legal good we are looking for. It is so that 

the possibility to accurately represent facts and reconstitute, legitimize and thereby make 

sovereignty evolve, as has happened along the course of history, will only become viable 

if we cease to hide the reality of these intangible relations. 

The intangible heritage contributes to the understanding of the critical crossroads 

of contemporary humanity, shedding light on the human condition, and on some of 

the possible paths for their redemption. (Soromenho-Marques 2006:62) 

 



 95 

 

4.4. The Software/Hardware Relation 

 
Defining and delimiting the quid to be placed under the scope of law will require the 

construction of legal abstractions in accordance with the known reality of nature, and 

finding solutions that harmonise representations of nature with those of the social system. 

The fact that the planet, as opposed to many others, is not just a sphere of rocks and 

an atmosphere offers us a solid point of departure for our reflection. Our planet, orbiting 

around the sun at a distance of 149 million kilometres in an orbit called the habitable 

zone,6 created the necessary physical conditions for an active water cycle to exist, which 

includes the three – solid, liquid and gaseous – phases. This water cycle enabled the 

development of an incredibly complex biosphere, forming patterns of organization and 

global integration through combined internal interaction. Together these patterns form a 

meta-system. 

The need to understand this global reality led to an evolution in life sciences, which 

integrated different areas of scientific knowledge, creating a contrast with the reductionist 

tendencies of the Cartesian perspective. This process eventually resulted in the concept 

of the Earth System that came to mean “the suite of interacting physical, chemical, and 

biological global-scale cycles (often called biogeochemical cycles) and energy fluxes 

which provide the conditions necessary for life on the planet” (Oldfield &amp;amp; Steffen 

2004:7). 

Being in dialectical interaction with the biotic and abiotic infrastructures, these 

processes function as a set of intangible operational instructions with properties that 

determine the ways in which the Earth System self-organizes and regulates itself, and can 

be designated as the “programme” of the Earth System. In a brilliant theoretical analogy, 

Soromenho-Marques (2006:59) clarifies the relationship between tangible and intangible 

heritage: "I believe that in an ultramodern analogy, we can read this relationship in the 

same way that software and hardware relate to each other." This analogy could in fact be 

equally valid on revealing the relation between tangible infrastructure (res corporals) of 

the planet and the intangible system (res incorporales) of physical laws, thermodynamics 

or biochemistry, forming in their combination an authentic piece of software containing 

the operational instructions that determine the functioning state of the Earth System. 



 96 

 
Figure 5. The hardware/software relation and the Earth System/planet relation 
 

The Earth System is a very real and constant presence in our lives. However, since we 

cannot see or touch it, it was thought to be infinitely abstract, but, recently, technological 

evolution easily made it visual through images captured from space. It thus became an 

open book that has since dazzled us with its high degree of interaction. 

The feedback we are getting on the state of the system and current technological 

developments are allowing us to read this “book of instructions” across different scientific 

areas. “For the first time in history, humans have knowledge at their disposal to exert a 

power over nature, over life and death, allowing us to gain control over what would 

previously escape our reach, being considered a certain fatality or causal chain of events” 

(Silva 2002:10). 

At the same time, this potential opened up a new field of opportunities and dangers. In 

the case of genetic information, the law was called upon to intervene, imposing rules and 

limits to human-making (bio-law), and information of the human genome was considered 

the heritage of mankind, even though in symbolic meaning only (UNESCO 1997). 

The previous example shows that the recognition of objects of intangible or immaterial 

character is not new to legal sciences. Other examples are cultural heritage, recognized 



 97 

through UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage (UNESCO 2003), the intangible value 

of companies in commercial law and the intellectual property rights and authorship 

through statements that establish the independence between author’s rights and the 

material support of a work. Despite problems of definition and delimitation, the 

importance of the values intended to be protected have always justified the search for new 

solutions. 

According to Olfield and Steffen (2004:7), the Earth System consists of an interactive 

atmosphere, ocean, biosphere, cryosphere, and lithosphere that form together a complete 

and unified system with characteristics defined as follows. 

It deals with a materially closed system that has a primary external energy source, 

the sun. 

• The major dynamic components of the Earth System are a suite of interlinked 

physical, chemical and biological processes that cycle (transport and 

transform) materials and energy in complex dynamic ways within the System. 

The forcings and feedbacks within the System are at least as important to the 

functioning of the System as are the external drivers. 

• Biological/ecological processes are an integral part of the functioning of the Earth 

System, and not just the recipients of changes in the dynamics of a chemical 

system. Living organisms are active participants, not simply passive respondents. 

Human beings, their societies and their activities are an integral component of the 

Earth System, and are not outside forces perturbing an otherwise natural system. 

There are many modes of natural variability and instabilities within the System as 

well as anthropologically driven changes. By definition, both types of variability 

are part of the dynamics of the Earth System. They are often impossible to 

separate completely and they interact in complex and sometimes mutually 

reinforcing ways. 

• Time scales considered in Earth System science vary according to the questions 

being asked. Many global environmental change issues consider time scales of 

decades to a century or two. However, a basic understanding of Earth System 

dynamics demands consideration of much longer time scales in order to capture 

longer-term variability of the System, to understand the fundamental dynamics 

of the System, and to place into context the current suite of rapid global-scale 



 98 

changes occurring within the System. Thus environmental and prognostic 

modelling approaches are both central to Earth System science. 

Now, as we examine this definition of the Earth System and the enumeration of its 

characteristics from the perspective of law, it seems that many of the problems associated 

the definition of legal environmental objects at state level have their origin within these 

characteristics. The same difficulties are faced by international law. These difficulties 

converge in the first two preconditions (geographic scale and time scale) that motivate 

the subversive character of environmental law, as follows: 

• At the state level, the environment was understood as "an autonomous and unitary 

legal good". As such, it became a synonym for diffuse and indefinable, thus 

rendering the protection of this good dysfunctional; 

• At the international level, the compartmentalised approach that considered and 

analysed only the distinct components of the Earth System concealed phenomena 

of interaction and emergence. 

The dysfunction between the current knowledge of the Earth System and the law finds 

support in the post-2015 Development Agenda of the United Nations, and within the 

formulation of the sustainable development goals (SDG). This UN strategy puts an 

emphasis on “the need for a coherent global framework to integrate existing laws that 

would cover these international areas” (UN, 2013). While international treaties and 

conventions relative to global common goods do exist, the United Nations recognizes that 

“the frameworks are fractured, and not comprehensive enough to include modern 

conservation principles or assessments” (Olfield &amp;amp; Steffen 2004:7). 

 

4.5. A Space Without Territory 

 
The concept or the most adequate international law term (Shelton 2009) to describe 

the characteristics outlined by Olfield and Steffen from a legal perspective is the common 

concern of humankind (CCH), which emerged with regard to the climate in the UNGA 

43/53 (1988) resolution (http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/43/a43r053.htm). While 

this concept is still just a phrase or term that should be understood in a broad sense, 



 99 

therefore being inapt to serve as operational or normative support for an international 

environment regime, Dina Shelton knew to appreciate the notable innovation of this term 

and the profound implications of its premises. According to Shelton (2009), the concept 

introduces two fundamental innovations into international law: the first relates to the fact 

that this concept does not make any reference to states; the second being the absence of 

any reference to a geographically delimited area, even though it is associated with other 

concepts such as the global commons areas – the high seas, Antarctica, the seabed and 

outer space – where the common heritage of mankind is applied. “Common concerns are 

different because they are not spatial, belonging to a specific area, but can occur within 

or outside sovereign territory” (Shelton 2009). 

In the opening speech of the second meeting of the Group of Legal Experts to examine 

the concept of the common concern of mankind in relation to global environmental issues 

in Geneva 1991, Mostafa K. Tolba, the director of UNEP at that time, asserted: 

It is very important that the concept of common concern of mankind is further 

elaborated to make its contents and scope understandable and clear; it is also 

important to make sure how this concept can be interpreted in the terms of rights 

and obligations of States in the process of its implementation. It is understandable 

that, since it is a new concept in international law and international relations, it 

will develop further in the near future and its interpretation given today, will evolve. 

 With these statements, the central idea of this concept – that its birth is only its own 

evolution– is retained. It was born as a quasi-concept, as a future project, a proclamation 

of the need to find an idea for an unsolved problem. In other words, since its appearance, 

the common concern is valuable for the novelty it was, and for what it might still be and 

represent. It is certain about 30 years on that the UN resolution on the common concern 

was the way round a possible legal status for the unique nature of climate which is not 

restricted to the global commons but spans also across areas subject to national 

jurisdiction (Borg 2007). The climate continues to be orphaned not of a definition but of 

a legal framework for its existence. In the report of this meeting (UNEP Secretariat, 

1991), it was said: 

During the general discussion on the concept of common concern of mankind, the 

experts reiterated that the concept still has no legal consequences in terms of rights 

and duties. It was stressed that the concept should not infringe the sovereign right 



 100 

of States and, in this context, a point was raised whether it is desirable to narrow 

down the scope of the concept and its application and confine it to global 

environmental issues which may cause significant adverse effects upon the 

environment. It was re-emphasized that the common concern concept was not meant 

to substitute the concept of common heritage. There was a general understanding 

that at the current stage the common concern of mankind may serve as guiding 

principle rather than legal rule. 

He identified the following aspects of the concept of common concern of mankind 

that require further consideration and elaboration by legal experts: 

- Possible implications of the concept for specific obligations in the relevant 

international treaties; 

- Implication for the human right to a healthy environment; 

-Implication with respect to the issues of equitable burden sharing and fair 

compensation. 

Although it is made clear here that the CCH (common concern of humankind) was not 

intended to replace the CHM, the need for this statement and its reinforcement justifies 

and substantiates the deep connection between the two concepts and their common origin. 

By listing the issues that need further consideration, we consider that there is a common 

denominator among the original objectives of the CHM and the future project 

implementation of CCH. 

 Both concepts are the result of the same initial boost of looking for an international 

management regime with the goal of long-term environmental protection through new 

structures of politics and governance beyond states, without infringing the sovereign 

rights of states. For all purposes, the CCH is an embryonic form of the non-territorial 

dimension of the CHM that never came into being, although that was the motivation and 

source of the initial boost. In this sense, the CCH represents a latent new legal theory, a 

united and interdependent global reality seeking its roots in the ancient moral or ethical 

concepts that unify humanity in the nature of the planet it inhabits. 

But, unlike the CHM, which still had some “specific areas of the Earth”, remnants of 

the geographical divisions, to anchor its existence, the global nature and res incorporales 

character of the CCH led to a permanently postponed future. This lack of definition and 



 101 

evolution sine die is matched only by the initial project of Arvid Pardo, which suggests 

that the CHM concept is useful in “organizing new forms international cooperation in 

matters that are not directly related to specific areas of the Earth (…) [including] climate 

and the environment” (Pardo 1989,9–10).7 

The resolution UNGA 43/53 (1988), as Borg (2007) recognizes, “identifies the legal 

status of an ‘intangible’ common resource (climate) that spans the global commons”. It 

is with the absence of a theory capable of representing the intangibility of nature and 

recognizing legally a good that is both inside and outside of all states that we can 

summarize our inability to accurately portray the reality around us. 

 Therefore, expounding on the statements of the experts, the CCH is not really a 

substitute of CHM that was compressed and mutilated to fit the territoriality of the borders 

of states but rather an attempt to fulfil the original objectives of the CHM itself. 

Still, the comments made by Shelton about this quasi-concept may yet prove extremely 

useful in the search of a legal environmental good when the absence of spatial character 

turns into a living space, as paradoxical as that may seem. “The environment is not an 

abstraction but represents a living space, the quality of life and the very health of human 

beings, including generations unborn” (Shelton 2009:2). This statement is in tune with 

space as a concept in the global context as considered by theorists on international 

relations: “Although globalisation theorists differ on whether globalisation marks a 

distinct rupture in modernity, they do agree that the separation of space from place is a 

basic characteristic of modernity that continues but accentuated form under globalising 

processes” (Coleman 2007:95). 

 

4.6. A Safe Space Without Territory 

 
One of the dimensions of complex sovereignty is its openness towards finding new 

concepts able to represent new loci in a transnational or global space. Thereby it presents 

an alternative to the exclusive perspective of space as a territory, distinguishing between 

space with its worldwide operation and place. For Giddens (1990:18),  

The advent of modernity increasingly tears space away from place by fostering 

relations between ‘absent’ others, locationally distant from any given situation of 

face-to-face interaction… What structures the locale is not simply that what is 



 102 

present on the scene; the ‘visible form’ of the local conceals the distant relations 

which determine its nature.  

And for Dirlik (2001:18), “Space in this sense refers to products”. 

This interesting development, where the spatial geographic representation is absorbed 

by the “functional” dimension of life, offers a functional space that is in accordance with 

Shelton's living space as a space system with the function of supporting life. On the other 

hand, the primarily spatial representation of the figure of sovereignty is relaxed, 

particularly when newly emerging forms of political authority are read to entail not only 

a spatial but also a functional reconfiguration. Such emerging forms are also read as the 

increasing importance of functional over spatial understandings of political authority. 

(Albert 2007:53) 

The non-territorial and intangible character of the climate and the function of 

maintaining a stable climate meet this vision of a functional space. This new context is 

still going through a process of assimilation and conceptual adaptation. We should 

emphasise that the living space referred to by Shelton (2009) is not just the climate system 

but the whole life-support system, of which the climate system is just one part. 

To clarify these concepts and introduce some order into our interpretation, we recur 

once again to Olfield and Steffen (2004:7). 

The term climate system is also used in connection with global change, and is 

encompassed within the Earth System. Climate usually refers to the aggregation of all 

components of weather – precipitation, temperature, cloudiness, for example – averaged 

over a long period of time, usually decades, centuries, or longer. The processes which 

contribute to climate comprise the climate system, and they are closely connected to 

biogeochemical cycles. However, there are some important differences between climate 

change and global change: 

• Many important features of biogeochemical cycles can have significant 

impacts on Earth System functioning without any direct change in the 

climate system. Examples include the direct effects of changing 

atmospheric CO2 concentration on carbonate chemistry and hence on 

calcification rates in the ocean and also the sharp depletion of stratospheric 

ozone from the injection of chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere. 



 103 

• Many interactions between biology and chemistry can have profound 

impacts on ecological systems, and hence feedbacks to Earth System 

functioning, without any change in the climate system. Examples include 

the impact of nitrogen deposition on the biological diversity of terrestrial 

ecosystems and the effect of non-climate driven changes in terrestrial and 

marine biosphere emission of trace gases and hence to the chemistry of the 

atmosphere. 

• Human societies and their activities are usually not considered to be a direct 

part of the climate system, although their activities certainly impact on 

important processes in the climate system (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions). 

The scale of the living space underlying the CCH would have to be the whole Earth 

System itself. This means, apart from the various spaces such as climate, biodiversity and 

oceans, we need an integrated and integrating approach. Considering that the UN 

recognizes the lack of a system approach to environmental problems, and that the common 

concern is the only term in international law capable of drawing a systemic reality that 

exists both in and outside of sovereignties, we need to evolve towards a concept that is 

able to define the living space. Although there has already been a consensus over the 

existence of a certain ecological global living space, there was no information available 

to define and delimit it. 

With the exponential development of Earth System sciences in the last 25 years, and 

the evolution of Earth observations from space, much of what was concealed from our 

senses has turned into a reality that we can observe in real time as external spectators. By 

combining all the information of the spatial “big picture” with the information collected 

from the lower level of the system, for example, through climate palaeontology, it has 

become possible to reconstruct a history of the atmosphere and the whole Earth System. 

Knowing the historical behavior of the Earth System is crucial to understanding the value 

of the Holocene to humankind, it could have a central role in the definition of the new 

legal object that lacks protection. 

Over the long course of history of our planet, many different chemical compositions 

of the atmosphere and the oceans have given origin to different levels of heat 

accumulation, energetic equilibrium and states of the Earth System. Knowing the history 

of chemical structures and the different resulting combinations of element interaction 



 104 

allowed us to understand the true unique conditions that characterised the period of 

climatic stability in the last 11,700 years called the Holocene. 

As we have seen in previous chapters, chemical alterations and the destruction of 

ecological infrastructures as a result from the Great Acceleration8 are pushing the Earth 

out of the stable domain of the Holocene – the only state of the Earth System that we 

know for certain is capable of supporting advanced human civilizations – and threatening 

to undermine our prosperity. The scientific community has attempted to respond to the 

challenge of understanding and measuring this living space by developing the concept of 

planetary boundaries (Steffen et al. 2015; Rockström et al. 2009). These boundaries are 

based on the intrinsic “hard-wired” properties of the Earth System itself. They define a 

combination of indicators that describe the state of the Earth System. 

With access to the information in the "software”, we have gained the ability to define 

and measure our living space. The paradoxical system of problem words that defined 

concerns as legal concepts now have a table where the vital factors are properly listed, 

with every factor assigned to a safe zone, with a minimum and maximum that we must 

not transgress. And this is being done on a scale upon which we all truly depend – the 

global scale. So, the living space, an intangible and non-territorial space of the CCH, will 

coincide with this well-defined state of the Holocene, denominated by the scientific 

community as the safe operating space of humankind. 

In conceptual terms, this living space operated by the safe operating space of 

humankind is consistent with the separation performed by international relations theorists 

between space and place. 

If we are able to distinguish the planet, with its 510 million square kilometers, from 

the Earth System and its different possible states, we can start to imagine alternative 

concepts of global coordination, without affecting the constituent elements of 

sovereignty. In fact, within a context of systemic dependency of all sovereignties upon 

the same living space, the separation of this functional and intangible space of life from 

the physical space of the planet and its sovereignties may even be the theoretical 

foundation for the development of solutions. 

This new conception of a safe operating space for humankind should in turn lead to a 

new juridical conception of the Earth System that corresponds better with the new 

scientific knowledge, notwithstanding the uncertainties that will always exist. 

Considering that space technology allowed this intangible nature to become 

perceivable by our senses, and the concept of planetary boundaries offered us the "genetic 



 105 

code" of the functioning of Spaceship Earth, we now have an obligation to organize 

ourselves and learn to steer collectively. In fact, the only thing that is truly within our 

reach is managing and governing ourselves in respect of our interactions with the Earth 

System. The creation of functional spaces without territory, thereby being global, may 

constitute a fixed point, an element of stability, upon which we may base a new approach 

and build an organization. In this sense, the possible construction of a new autonomous 

legal good as a converging point of a looking-for process should focus on the evolution 

of this combination of processes with shared origins and goals, continuing the search for 

the stabilization of a space to be invented. 

 

4.7. From a Space of Concerns to a Heritage 

 
The concept of CHM as a legal one is one of the most revolutionary and radical 

developments in the last 50 years of international law. Since its emergence, it became 

clear that no other concept, notion, principle or doctrine provoked such intense debate 

and controversy as did the possibility of attributing a heritage to both present and future 

humanity. Its revolutionary and subversive character stems from the philosophical 

concept of "humanity", which raises questions over legal regimes of resources that are 

crucial for the maintenance of the living space for and by both present and future 

generations. 

Since the application and implementation of the CHM required critical re-evaluation 

of many principles and doctrines of classical international law, this adverse context 

inevitably resulted in an inadequate implementation9. Put otherwise, the application of 

the model as originally proposed by Arvid Pardo (1976), without the recognition of the 

different existing integration levels of the Earth System (unknown at that time), led to a 

confrontation between an intellectually valid philosophical principle, that recognized the 

ocean as a heritage of mankind and the lower system level where the model of political 

and territorial fragmentation reigns. 

As the current legal order only acknowledged some of the separate and individual 

components of the Earth System and not the healthiness of the system as a whole at its 

higher level, the CHM concept was inevitably pulled towards the only existing lower 

level. At this point, a confrontation became unavoidable. It is true that the oceans possess 

a territorial dimension, but the presence of a functional biochemical dimension that 



 106 

determines their quality is no less of a truth. This dimension, incompatible with the legal 

abstractions of political borders, is inevitably global. 

In geographical terms, a dead and acidified ocean may continue to be the object of 

jurisdictional divisions of sovereign powers but it may not serve as an existing life support 

to marine life and humanity as a whole. It was this functional and qualitative oceanic 

system that Arvid Pardo was referring to when he launched the concept of the heritage of 

mankind in 1967. 

As there was no legal distinction between the system and the place where the system 

would operate, the CHM was limited to existing concepts, imprisoned within the 

territorial dimension of place, becoming confined to leftover parts of state appropriations 

lying outside state borders. 

It was the only possible approach; and in fact, it still is. However, soon enough a 

conflict was revealed between the interests and the territorial claims of states, rendering 

the approach inoperable for goods that cannot be geographically defined, such as the 

climate. This is why the vital good, a stable climate from which humanity has only been 

able to receive the benefits in the last 10,000 years, has so far remained a concern or a 

state of mind, reduced to a narrow concept of atmospheric pollution to be managed on a 

territorial basis. 

Amongst existing legal frameworks, it is difficult to embed and create a non-territory, 

or a territory at global scale with intangible characteristics that escape the existing models 

of physical and biological nature. The only reason the CHM has survived, even though it 

subverts the model of political-territorial fragmentation, is due to the initial formulations 

proving to be philosophically valid and ethically undeniable. Actually, there exists a 

growing understanding that we are at the limits of international law and we need a radical 

advancement, and CHM and its CCH substitutes and ineffective derivatives are concepts 

that could open the door. 

 

 

4.8. Holocene State as a Heritage Protected by Law 

 
The process that gave birth to the period of the Holocene, unique in terms of climatic 

stability in the history of the Earth,10 was a phenomenon of spontaneous emergence from 

the combination of certain elements and their proportions, and which in their reciprocal 



 107 

interactions formed a pattern, giving rise to a combined organizational "order". This 

natural process should be embraced by humanity as one of the greatest gifts it received 

from nature, as it was exactly these conditions that allowed for the development of human 

civilizations and all the species of the planet that share the same ecological needs. 

We are not able to protect this phenomenon of emergence or teleconnections but we 

can protect the biogeophysical structures and processes of the state of the Earth System 

that assure its maintenance. These biogeophysical structures and their internal relative 

concentrations of gases are a gift to humanity that resulted from millions of years of 

interactions at Earth's history scale. These intangible conditions have the highest value 

for humankind. They are a true grundnorm, where other values, already legally protected, 

and a system of organization should establish its locus, its basis of stability. 

According to Rakhyun and Bosselmann (2013:283), 

This context, the planetary boundaries framework, scientifically suggests the 

existence of a foundational environmental principle or grundnorm, which, for the 

purpose of our research, can be defined as a basic norm to bind any governmental 

power. This understanding differs from Kelsen’s definition, and is closer to Kant’s 

argument that any positive law must be grounded in a ‘natural’ norm of general 

acceptance and reasonableness (Vernunft) to prevent pure arbitrariness. The 

existence of an environmental grundnorm, therefore, rests on the assumption that 

respecting planetary boundaries is a dictate of reason (Gebot der Vernunft) and 

general acceptance (allgemeine Gültigkeit). Conceptually, a grundnorm exists 

independently of a legal system, but underpins legal reasoning in the form of an 

inference rule. 

In this sense we can argue that the state of the Earth System corresponding to the 

geological period of the Holocene carries the meaning of heritage as something we need 

to conserve in everyone's interest. It enables the recognition of a new value to be legally 

protected as an international autonomous legal good. “Heritage is one idea. It is a 

philosophical idea, a legal concept, as is something that we need to conserve” (Sobrino 

2012:4). 

The evolution of the international community, the vital value of this state of the Earth 

System and the heritage dimension derived from the need to transmit it to future 

generations enable the recognition of something higher in scale than a concern or an 

interest that should be legally protected as an autonomous legal good. 



 108 

The evolution of a living space “concern” towards a common intangible natural 

heritage of humankind as an authentic autonomous legal good seems a crucial conceptual 

advance for the organization of human relations, which have broadened to a global scale. 

With the scientific “safe operating space”, the legal concept of the living space could have 

a value that can be measured. 

As Sobrino (2012:5) stated,  

I think this idea, to being more than an idea, must institutionalize itself (…) If we 

combine the idea of heritage with the idea of an international authority and place 

relative competences on it – not many are needed, apart from certain ones to 

establish a multilateral framework for action – I think that would resolve many of 

the current tensions. 

The legal concept of heritage can be the locus for that vital good, the living intangible 

space, represented by the safe operating space, and at the same time to be the support for 

a global organization. 

What is certain is that a purely formal legal approach towards the current notion of the 

CHM will exclude the maintenance of this Earth System state within the biogeophysical 

characteristics of the Holocene. The protection of a certain state of the Earth System can 

only be legally framed by proceeding with an axiological and teleological interpretation 

at the basis of the legal consecration of the CHM and its substitute derived concepts. 

Arvid Pardo's vision that gave origin to the concept of CHM involved the perception 

of the “ocean environment as an integrated fluid ecological system” and the concern “that 

continued, unmanaged use of the world’s oceans would become a serious threat to 

international peace and security from the environmental impact of new technologies, the 

militarization of the seafloor and expanding state claims to jurisdiction over large parts 

of the oceans”.11 

To realize these objectives through the legal regime of the CHM involves 

distinguishing the system concept and its intrinsic intangible quality from the territorial 

and geographical approach of already existing legal concepts. But as Taylor &amp;amp; Stroud 

(2012, 19) state, “Arvid Pardo (and others) considered the CHM regime flexible enough 

to adapt to the emerging challenges, the discovery of new resources and values, such as 

scientific research”. 

Departing from this approach, unrealized due to theoretical and practical 

impossibilities at the time, we will try to adjust the initial intentions of the CHM to the 



 109 

current criteria for the intrinsic unit of the Earth System. While the artificial separation 

between oceans, climate and biodiversity may be necessary for reasons of task 

organization, this lower level of operation should not conceal the need for intervention in 

the protection of biogeophysical conditions at the higher-level integration of the Earth 

System. This intervention can be put into practice through application of international 

standards on the quality of the Earth System state realized by the approach of the 

planetary boundaries. 

Nonetheless, it is of interest to understand that all the substitutes and derived concepts 

gravitating around the CHM seek to plant a seed for the development of a normative 

framework that offers alternatives to governing the global common goods, and not only 

the areas and resources beyond its jurisdictions. So, in order for the CHM to become an 

operational/normative concept, its object needed to be deterritorialised and made to 

coincide with the initial concepts and premises formulated by Arvid Pardo. 

The entire range of more or less indeterminate concepts pursue the same unique end, 

the reason for their existence being the absence of instruments that could somehow 

constitute an object of intellectual representation of reality, in this case the Earth System 

as a whole within a state that supports the living space. It is therefore crucial to understand 

in detail the differences between the concept of CHM and the CCH derived from it. Based 

on the proposal of Murillo (2008), we will compare them with recent knowledge 

regarding the safe operating space for humankind and how they may be re-framed so as 

to correspond to recent scientific evolutions.

TERRITORIAL 

SCOPE 

CHM 
Areas beyond national jurisdiction and its 

resources  

CCH 

A wider scope – applied in the intangible higher 

level, both beyond national jurisdiction but also 

within the jurisdiction of states. 

SUBJECT SCOPE 

CHM 
The main focus is related to the geographical areas 

beyond national jurisdiction and its resources.  

CCH 

Focused in functional intangible spaces that are a 

“concern” to humanity as whole. At present, the 

matters are climate change, species in danger and 

conservation of biodiversity. 

The intrinsic intangible ecological quality does not 

exist autonomously on the geographical space. 

Therefore, the CCH continues without a clear and 

precise definition, liable to generate rights and 

duties. 

DISTRIBUTIVE 

SCOPE 

 

CHM Equitable sharing of benefits. 

CCH 
Equitable sharing of burdens – cooperation and 

problem solving. 

 

Figure 6. Differences between Common Heritage of Mankind (CHM) and Common 

Concern of Humankind (CCH)  

 

From the analysis of different perspectives of the approach that considers the Earth 

System as a unique systemic whole with intrinsic limits regarding its state, we are able to 

identify the following advantages and disadvantages. 

 

 

 



 111 

 

 

TERRITORIAL SCOPE 

The CCH offers a more adequate 

response to the characteristics of the 

Earth System both in and outside 

sovereignties. But it has the 

disadvantage of not having a locus, 

unlike the CHM, so it cannot be 

attached to a space on which an 

organization can be built. 

SUBJECT SCOPE 

The CHM carries the advantage of 

being able to delimit the area or 

resource in question, while the CCH has 

a problem with the intangibility of the 

object.  

 

DISTRIBUTIVE SCOPE 

 

From the perspective of the Earth 

System, damages and benefits, caused 

and produced upon the Earth System as 

a whole, are shared.  

 

Figure 7. Comparative Analysis of Common Heritage of Mankind and Common 

Concern of Humankind  

 

In summary, we can say that while one has a locus and does not possess an appropriate 

territorial scope, the other has the appropriate territorial scope but does not have a locus. 

In regard to the distributive scope, the sum of both may adequately address the 

characteristics of globally shared damages and benefits at the level of the Earth System. 

In this sense, the combination of some of the characteristics of both concepts may 

bring the necessary advances in law and international relations with the objective to 

constructing an institutional architecture more adapted to the environmental living space 

in response to a collective concern of humanity. 

 



 112 

4.9. An Evolutional Legal Living Space 

 
Both concepts of living space of the CCH and the safe operating space of humankind 

maintain the common characteristic of being intangible non-territorial spaces regarding 

the biogeochemical conditions of a certain state of the Earth System that supported 

favourable conditions for human life on Earth. However, their origins are different – one 

legal, the other scientific. This primordial nature is found on the level of the meta-heritage 

or constituent heritage (Soromenho-Marques 2006), an intangible natural heritage that is 

the fundamental basis for the intelligibility of all other types of tangible natural heritage 

already known. It is represented by the processes of life or the major circulatory element 

flows, which in a previous analogy was referred to as the software relationship of the 

Earth System. 

As a concept, ‘state’, which is profoundly rooted within territorial space, does not 

include the global software that supports the life system on Earth. The ‘safe operating 

space for humankind’, as the best available integrated piece of scientific information with 

the capacity to elaborate on emerging phenomena in a systemic way, may constitute a 

keystone of this announced evolution. The question then becomes whether this scientific 

instrument is sufficient to represent the multiple realities of the Earth System as a whole 

and in an immutable way. 

Although there is still uncertainty regarding the quantification of limits and the 

existence of planetary limits, they are clear and entirely consistent with the science of 

complex systems. As we cannot “aspire to a immutability of physical biological and 

chemical elements” (Canotilho 1991:123), it will be necessary to operate permanently on 

an evolutionary flexibility. The ecological paradigm is characterised by complex 

processes, which inevitably engender uncertainty. “It is up to the law to transform this 

ecological uncertainty into a social certainty” (Morand 1995:212). 

In this sense, this living space will always be a scientific representation of a dynamic 

system. Therefore, the instrument used for its interpretation will also need to be flexible, 

dynamic and evolving, allowing a dialogue between the human species and the Earth 

System that we are part of. The creation of a new international intangible space, while 

founded in an ever-developing science, will have to be founded on a socially constructed 

"value" that will guarantee its existence independent from scientific evolutions on the 

Earth System. 



 113 

The important thing will be the concept that there is an intangible living space, both in 

and outside sovereignties. Considering present scientific knowledge, this corresponds to 

the safe operating space of the Holocene, but the concrete definition of limits and 

elements to be taken into account within this socially constructed space will evolve along 

the line of continuous, evolutionary and dynamic knowledge on the Earth System. 

Once again, as Morin (1990:8) states, complex thought “has no intent to replace the 

ambition of simple thinking, which is to control and dominate the real. It is a thought 

experiment that is capable of handling the real, and negotiate and enter in dialogue with 

it”. 

The key will be to find an instrument that represents the known reality of the Earth 

System, allowing us to enter in dialogue with it. 

 

 

4.10. Applying CHM to the Earth System 

 
From the initial intentions and derived concepts that evolved from the CHM concept 

will result a new legal object based on the fundamental separation between the res 

incorporales relative to the intangible dimension, qualitative and functional of the Earth 

System (higher level of integration), and the res corporals, referring to the territorial 

spaces (land, oceans and areal space, i.e., the lower level of integration) in which these 

functions and qualities develop. 

In this sense, we advance a proposal for an evolution incorporating the combined 

elements for an axiological interpretation of CHM applied to the Earth System: 

 

• The biogeophysical structure of the Holocene period is part of the international 

common heritage (patrimony) and therefore belongs to all humanity in common. 

This means it cannot be owned, enclosed or disposed of (i.e., appropriated) by any 

state/s or entity. As a commons it can be used, but not owned, either as private or 

common property or via the claim of sovereign rights; 

• The use of the common heritage framework shall be carried out in accordance 

with a system of cooperative management, for the benefit of all humanity (or 

common good). This has been interpreted as creating a type of trust relationship, 

with states acting as trustees for the benefit of all humanity (i.e., for the common 



 114 

good, not for the exclusive benefit of states/private entities) including future 

generations, taking into account the particular needs and interests of developing 

states (intra-generational equity); 

• There exists a permanent sharing of damage and benefits realized over the state 

of the Earth System. It will be necessary to construct an accounting system in 

order to account for the contributions of each state towards the desired state of the 

Earth System, and next develop an equitable system of derived compensations for 

the different uses of the CHM; 

• A global entity should be created with exclusive functions in coordination of 

compensations and the development of projects for the maintenance of this 

common heritage of mankind.

Figure 8. Features of a possible evolution of CHM/CCH to a Common Intangible Natural Heritage of 

Humankind 

 

This possible pathway of the natural heritage, from the “materially and geographically 

definable” to the “immaterial and intangible”, is similar to the consolidation of cultural 

heritage. The importance of cultural heritage was consecrated in UNESCO's Convention 

concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage in 1972, but 30 years 

later it was acknowledged that cultural heritage cannot be limited to what can be seen or 

touched, so immaterial heritage was included in the Convention for the Safeguarding of 

Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2003. 

The time has now come for intangible nature to be recognized as a vital resource for 

all humankind – a common intangible natural heritage of humankind. 

 

 

4.11. Conclusion 

 

It is now recognized in the current doctrine that international law is not yet equipped 

to handle the ecological goods that exist simultaneously in and outside of all states. There 

exists a structural, theoretical flaw in the approach to the global “whole”. This flaw 

extends to the time dimension of the chain of successive human generations. The global 

commons have always been (and continue to be) understood as geographical spaces that 

only exist outside the political borders of states. Likewise, humanity and its future 

generations, despite being repeatedly referred to in international conventions, do not 

possess a legal status that corresponds with an efficient protection. 

The global, diffuse and intangible dimension of a vital good such as a stable climate, 

existing both within and outside all states, with the effects of the damage caused upon it 

extending over several generations, transformed this traditional approach into an 

ecological nonsense. The dysfunctionality of existing legal instruments not only has long 

since been detected but has also been the object of several attempts to build concepts, 

which, however, are soon found to be inoperative, with no legal consequences in terms 

of rights and duties. 



 116 

Alongside the increasing understanding of the functioning of the Earth System, 

together with the possibility to measure its state through the planetary boundaries, a giant 

leap was taken towards the unravelling of the nebula composed of legally vague and 

undefined concepts disseminated in national and international legal texts. International 

Law expressions such as the common concern of mankind, common interest, life-support 

system, intergeneration equity, ecological integrity and sustainable development can now 

be sustained by a pattern of indicators that may be used to translate and delineate the lack 

of legal definitions, opening up new perspectives in the construction of solutions that will 

overcome the dysfunctionality between the ecological reality and the existing legal 

framework. 

These vital factors, translated through these indicators, as they are global and diffuse, 

are still legally non-existent and considered “external” to social organization. They are 

the known economic externalities, either positive (regulating ecosystem services) or 

negative (pollution). 

The concept of the common heritage of mankind has stayed tied to the geographical 

areas of political division between states. Until now, World Heritage has only been 

applied to goods that, despite their outstanding universal value from an aesthetic or 

scientific point of view, are found within the geographical area of a state. 

 These two legal concepts (CHM and WH) will possess a greater potential for 

evolution towards instruments capable of protecting this vital and global good, and their 

sum can cover the geographical area in which the Earth System operates. The World 

Heritage has already made the shift from tangible cultural heritage towards intangible 

cultural heritage. It seems that we can now reproduce this pathway in regard to the natural 

heritage (Aragão 2016). So, being in the possession of a way to represent a favourable 

state of the Earth System through the structure of biogeochemical concentrations that 

remained relatively stable over the last 11,700 years – the Holocene period – we propose 

the recognition of a well-defined state of the Earth System as a world natural intangible 

heritage of mankind. This new natural intangible heritage should be the locus on which 

to construct a system for the management and maintenance of Earth System use. Upon 

establishing rules applying to the use of the Earth System, we are also securing the 

minimum conditions for the dignity of future generations. But before undertaking 

institutional reform, we need a concept that allows for a solution that will fill the gap 

between the theory underlying the organization of international institutions and the reality 

of Earth System dynamics.

This is a structural prerequisite to building the equity and trust needed for collective 

action. In this sense, it will be a structural instrument for the application of human rights.

5.1. Political Impossibility? 

 
In a seminar organized by the Academy of Environmental Law (IUCN), Simone Borg 

(2001) presented a paper with the title “Climate Change as a Common Concern of 

Humankind.” In it he posed two fundamental questions: 

1) Is it necessary to identify the legal status of climate? 

2) Will we gain anything from doing so? 

We have accepted that the good to be put under the protection of the law is not only 

the climate but a well-defined state of the Earth System, as Olfield and Steffen (2004) 

have already demonstrated. Now, it seems to us that any satisfactory attempt to answer 

these questions can only be made if we first answer another question asked by Alexander 

Kiss (1982.121) on the definition of res communis: “Of course, one may question the 

exact meaning of this concept: is it a common sovereignty, a co-ownership, a 

condominium? We must recognize that this question has never been solved in a 

completely satisfactory manner – that is precisely one of the major arguments of the 

advocates of the conception res nullius.” 

This statement redirects the point from the need to recognize a legal status for the 

climate or the Earth System to the real crux of the issue: whether there is a legal 

framework able to receive and integrate a new legal status with respect to a good that is 



 119 

simultaneously inside and outside of all sovereignties. The problem is establishing the 

type of res communis of this new legal good, and that will be decisive in its new legal 

status being, or not, compatible and integrated in the existing legal framework. It is in the 

absence of a clear definition of what a “global common good” is exactly, that is, what is 

the res communis ommnium which is not restricted to the global commons but spans also 

across areas subject to national jurisdiction (Borg 2007), that creates the breeding ground 

in which all uncertainties can germinate. This absence is the epicentre of our legal nebula, 

our confusion, our legal black hole through which the most vital factors for our future 

disappear. Awareness has been growing that the term common concern can only express 

our embarrassment, our incapacity to define in a simple manner, to name in a clear way 

or capture with words a vague terrain of ideas. 

When one states that the common concern was the fall-back solution because there 

was no real political will to build a new legal object, this is only partially correct. In fact, 

without first identifying the legal regime of res communis needed to reconcile the intrinsic 

characteristics of the new legal object with the existing international legal framework, 

even if there had been political will to recognize the existence of a new legal good, the 

result would probably not have been very different from the existent incompatibilities 

that continue to relegate CHM to the ever- smaller remaining parts of jurisdictions, and 

the CCH for a future always postponed. 

A desirable conservation of the Earth System cannot be regulated effectively if it is 

based only on international laws sustained purely on interstate consent and reciprocity. A 

new legal framework must be built that ensures also the protection and promotion of 

common interests by representing the interests of all humankind. Without this, vital 

factors will continue to be perceived as concerns, or will conflict with ecological 

nonsense2 approaches. The question “How can we admit that a good that belongs to no 

one may be governed by a specific law?” (Kiss 1982:122) implies understanding what 

theoretical legal framework is more able to explain and receive this new object of law. If 

the basic statement that the absence of ownership is synonymous with not being governed 

and therefore being a res nullius is correct, how is it possible that a new global legal 

object, called here the favourable state of the Earth System, can come into being and be 

ruled in a context of a fragmented territorial sovereignty without any legal representation 

of a global res communis? 

The remaining ecological space (Rockstrom 2014), scientifically represented by the 

safe operating space for humankind of planetary boundaries and the living space as the 



 120 

non-territorial space of the CCH, “can be considered as a fine-tuned version of the res 

communis status of global natural resources in light of the contemporary developments” 

(Borg 2009:4). This view could also correspond with the problem of res communis 

definition, as reported by Kiss. But perhaps the main response to Borg’s original question 

is the need of the good to belong to someone in order to be ruled and not be a res nullius. 

 

 

5.2. Two Different Levels of the Earth System, Two Different Levels of 
Human Relations 
 
 

If we need to change our relationship with our life-supporting system from exploitation 

to stewardship, humanity has to self-organize within this remaining living space and 

ensure its maintenance in a well-functioning condition. This means that the main task is 

the internal organization between all the users of the same resource on a global scale. This 

fact puts humanity in the unavoidable position of relating internally in two different 

scales. This means that it will be in the way the Earth System is used that the relationships 

between all communities and individuals will be established.  

Like all complex systems, the Earth System has two levels of integration, a lower level 

of component parts and processes and a higher level that constitutes the whole system 

with its emergent properties that cannot be understood or described by simply aggregating 

the component parts up the global level. The first level is related to the geographical area, 

that is, the heterogeneous physical planet with 510 million km2 on which different state 

sovereignties operate and that is also the locus, the hardware of the Earth System. The 

higher level (the Earth System itself) is intangible as it arises from the global 

interconnections and emerging phenomena through which global human relations are 

mediated. This higher level developed in an evolutionary fashion throughout Earth's 

history and it is through this evolutionary process involving the living part of the planet 

as well as the geophysical that, for example, the relative concentrations of gases remain 

relatively constant through time. A key process of the Earth System is self-regulation, 

which consists of feedback loops formed by component parts of the system (both inside 

and outside of all sovereignty and incapable of any legal abstraction of division) that work 

synergistically to keep the system in well-defined states. 



 121 

In essence, it is the integration of the geophysical properties of the planet with the 

living biosphere that forms the intangible Earth System, a single global system incapable 

of any legal abstraction of division. In this sense, the intangible Earth System is an 

authentic law of nature, already described by science and recognized as the "principles" 

that govern the natural phenomena of the system. Humanity, as an integral component of 

the Earth System, is also dependent on those principles, and, as such, humanity is related 

to the Earth System on two distinct levels in equal terms. 

On a lower level, humanity is organized as independent political communities around 

a defined territory. On the higher level, the relationships are established and mediated 

through the use of a single common system, the Earth System, which does not exist 

legally and as a consequence is unmanaged. 

So the main answer to Borg’s initial question has to do with the reconfiguration of 

inter-subjective relations between all users of the same resource. As stated by Filipe et 

al. (2007:84), “It is from the relationships established when carrying out the use of the 

resource that arise concepts as the right to common property or private property”. 

 

5.3. A Heritage to Organize Relations 

 
Since the use of the common resource, called here the favourable state of the Earth 

System is extensive temporally and its effects are intergenerational, it is also through this 

resource that relationships are established between generations past, present and unborn. 

Theory has defined property not only by the individual’s relationship with the inherent 

characteristics of the object but also to include the underlying relationship between the 

owner and all other individuals. According to Hang (2003), the most relevant is the 

relationship between individuals, because property rights are a relationship between 

individuals in relation to a resource, not a relationship between an individual and the 

resource”. Once the use of this limited resource is not exclusive to any "user" and no user 

can exclude access to any other, in global terms we are facing a situation of common 

ownership extended to the scale of all humankind (Res communes ominium). From the 

moment it is discovered that a resource considered inexhaustible is, after all, exhaustible, 

internal relations are equally reconfigured among all users of that resource. For 

Schmid(1995) property rights represent a set of ordered relationships among people 

which define their opportunities, their exposure to the acts of others, their privileges and 



 122 

their responsibilities for resource utilization”. When the resource in question is a res 

incorporales relative to a certain favourable state of the Earth System that everyone 

depends on, all users share the consequences of the acts of others. 

Constructing a system to organize each actor’s privileges and responsibilities 

regarding the use of a resource that belongs to everyone, born and unborn, becomes a 

matter of survival. 

To that extent, the legal recognition of a favourable state of the Earth System as a 

common heritage of mankind should primarily result in a regulatory instrument of 

relationships between individuals, states and communities. That is, if everyone has access 

to the good and its benefits, and no one can be excluded, we will have to answer questions 

like: Who is responsible for maintaining it? and What are the rules for using it (rights and 

duties)? 

The legal absence of the good also corresponds to a social failure, to the res nullius, 

that is, the absence of rules between individuals or states on the use of the good. The 

perceived relevance of the underlying relations of property ownership will be the most 

decisive factor in justifying the need to recognize legally the existence of the Earth 

System, and to give it a patrimonial dimension. 

When we structure global and inter-subjective relations based on the relationships 

established through the use of a common good to which is assigned a value per se, we are 

simultaneously building a system to ensure its maintenance and allowing the construction 

of a larger global justice as they are intrinsically related. 

As a result, the preservation of the new legal good should result from a collective 

action internally organized between the users rather than by a legal obligation. Thereby, 

the new heritage shall be the mediator of a dialectical relationship developed on a global 

scale between social internal relations and the object (Earth System). To that extent, 

planetary boundaries should not be perceived as a new prohibition but as the limits that 

underlie and justify our self-organization. We can even say that the ultimate goal of 

acknowledging this common natural intangible heritage of humankind is the construction 

of a globally organized society around a common heritage, an intangible locus around 

which humankind organizes itself. 

If nothing can exist in pure disorder, the survival of the human species as a whole 

depends on its ability to self-organize. So, it’s at the level of consequences for subjective 

relationships in the internal organization between users of the common resource that the 



 123 

greatest justification for the legal consecration of a well-defined state of the Earth System 

lies. 

If one accepts that the legal recognition of a favourable state of the Earth System is a 

basic structural factor for the organization/regulation of the internal relations of humanity, 

a key question remains unanswered: Will it be possible to conciliate in a symbiotic way 

the existence of one global legal support (the legal status of Earth System) with the 

fragmented territorial sovereignty? Taking as a starting point the two levels of the existing 

relations, we will try to understand which model of res communis is better able to 

accurately portray the facts: "the common sovereignty, co-ownership, the 

condominium?” (Kiss 1982:122). 

 

5.4. Divide to Organize 

Taking as a starting point the unique characteristics of the climate and the Earth 

System as a whole, and the alternatives presented by Kiss (1982), it seems that the 

hypotheses of both common sovereignty and co-ownership imply the maintenance of the 

idea that there is a separation between what is within the borders and the res communis, 

which corresponds with the leftover areas of the division. In this sense, none of these 

models seem to have the necessary characteristics to be able to deal satisfactorily with 

the problem of activities affecting negatively an Intangible Natural Resource, which 

spans across and beyond the national territories of States (Borg 2009). This overlap of 

interests between the private interests of states and the interests of all humanity has an 

inherent condition of interdependence: it is mutually beneficial or mutually destructive. 

The problem of reconciling seemingly opposing interests in a situation of symbiotic 

interdependence is not new to legal sciences, and it was structured through a private law 

figure that defines the situation where a materially indivisible thing, or a thing with a 

unitary structure, belongs to various co-owners where each one has private or exclusive 

rights of ownership over determined fractions and at the same time, are co-owners of the 

parts of the building, which constitutes its common structure. This juridical figure is 

known as a condominium. 

In order for this model to transform a theoretical impossibility into a solution, it was 

necessary to innovate and not be limited by the application of pre-existing forms of 

dominium. Once neither private property nor co-ownership could deal with the 

relationships established through the ownership and use of a materially indivisible 



 124 

building, the condominium was invented. First it accepted the unitary and indivisible 

nature of a building and then built a system that would adapt to this seemingly 

unsurpassable circumstance. It argued against what was previously considered to be 

irrefutable and created a model of ownership that cannot be associated with any other 

form of ownership. As magistrate Luís Hernanz Cano (1998:41) says, Spanish 

jurisprudence has perceived horizontal property as “special property” or “complex 

property”. Its accurate designations are clearly a sign of its complexity: “house by 

storeys”, “condominium of storeys”, “pro indivisio communities”, autonomous fraction”, 

and “community with rights in rem” (Cano 1998: 41). The motive for such complexity is 

the coexistence of apparently contradictory and antagonistic elements, which, if 

considered superficially, may create the supposition that the presence of one implies the 

absence of the other and is hardly translatable in the reductive language of definitions. 

The urgent need for a solution led to one capable of combining within the same 

materially indivisible building a separation that allows several individuals to use the same 

floor as housing. Additionally, it envisages: a) that each individual has a unique right to 

ownership of a fraction of the building, making possible the legal trade of these 

properties; b) the existence of a system of contributions to ensure the maintenance of 

systems of common use (water, electricity, elevators) and the parts that are legally and 

materially impossible to divide (stairs, roof, structure, etc.), which must all be maintained 

in a dependable state. 

The model of the condominium, or complex property, is not a community or an 

arithmetic sum of individual properties. It is something complex that elevates the law to 

the art of reconciling the extremes, of making symbiotically dependent what was 

apparently incompatible (Magalhães 2007:87). 

Although with some nuances, this theoretical model has been used recurrently 

throughout history in international law, in situations of shared rivers, small islands, 

territorial enclaves, territories under dispute and in undefined political situations or even 

at the level of small communities wishing to establish access to certain resources related 

to rural activities. Even the Antarctica Treaty System of 1959 is considered by some as a 

de facto condominium (Glennon 1991), since it is not a sovereign territory (although 

various nations claim parts of its territory as their own) and provides voting authority for 

28 nations to jointly govern the area. In all, 50 countries are part of the “condominium” 

although some consider it a “quasi-condominium” (Hemmings 2014). 



 125 

The use of civil juridical institutes originating from national laws is not new in 

international law. For some authors it is even recommended. Weeramantry (2000:195) 

points out that: 

In view of the speed of progress and of technology, the national laws and 

international law should follow the movement and increase their productive and 

adaptive ability. New concepts and procedures should rapidly be sought to confront 

the new situations, which are a result of technology’s progress. For this effect, 

international law should firstly be aware of all the essential traditions of the 

different civilizations and adopt a multicultural attitude. Numerous principles of 

international law, which will be adopted in the future, may be released from the 

traditional juridical systems existent in the world and through which international 

law may receive its strength and inspiration. 

The change from the soft law to the hard law should be accelerated, thus making 

international law more fit to adapt itself to the needs of our time. National laws will 

take advantage of the norms and of the universal patterns, which will equally 

improve the internal systems. 

In the classical approach, commons management is doomed to the fate of the "tragedy 

of the commons". Hardin’s work transformed a growing pessimism around the 

“commons” into a global scale pessimism, also called by some doctrines as the “tragedy 

of the common heritage of mankind" (Shackelford 2008). It considers “communal 

sovereignty may be seen as a temporary placeholder that exists until technology enables 

occupation of property making it worthwhile for States to assert national sovereignty in 

the oldest traditions of the Westphalian system”. In this view, “establishing property 

rights has been commonly seen in the Western world as the solution to commons 

management; once occupation of a territory is possible, then property rights become 

necessary to catalyze development” (Shackelford 2008:120). This heads to the still-

dominant doctrine that points out as a unique solution the division and privatization of 

the good. However, ecological interdependence has shown that it is necessary to develop 

a new theory to explain phenomena that do not fit in a dichotomous world divided 

between individual/state interests and collective/humanity interests. In an attempt to 

develop legal or economic instruments to involve collective interests, the conditions that 

block a class action or give rise to a conflict are recognized.  



 126 

In his analysis of the strategy of conflict, Schelling (1960), winner of the Nobel Prize 

for Economics and one of the fathers of the theory of games, showed that many social 

interactions can be seen as non-cooperative games that involve both common and 

conflicting interests. In fact, Schelling sought to consolidate the idea that almost any 

problem involving the decisions of more than one person simultaneously contains 

elements of conflict and common interest. It is in the apparent contradiction of the 

symbiotic relationship between individual and collective interests (masterfully defined by 

Kant, “Only in the pursuit of common interests can we guarantee our individual rights)”4 

that we will try to reinterpret the analyses already carried out on the structural paradox of 

these interrelationships, which are exercised in an mutually advantageous form or a failed 

coordination would give rise to high costs for all parties (Filipe et al. 2007). The 

condominium transforms dichotomous dogma into accidental truth, and achieves, without 

denying the classic solution of division, the integration and symbiotic unification with the 

common property. 

The big news is that although the condominium divides in order to organize the 

different tasks and responsibilities, these are carried out not only to define distinct private 

properties but also to distinguish all private properties from parts and systems that are in 

a regime of common ownership. It is precisely through the distinction between different 

types of ownership over the same materially undivided good that this form of “complex 

property” can harmonise the different private and common interests, making this overlap 

of properties perfectly symbiotic. 

Separation is managed through a legal abstraction, allowing the existence, within each 

individual fraction, of elements that appear to be private but are actually common (e.g., 

main walls, structure, exterior walls, roofs, water distribution system, and electricity). 

The operation is not just a mere division of spaces but a division with qualitative and 

functional criteria regarding the intrinsic nature of the different elements in a building. 

The criterion on which this approach is based is that all those constituent and 

functional elements whose lack of maintenance implies damage for all owners of 

individual properties within the building should be integrated into the co-ownership 

regime. That is, common parts are all parts of a building that cannot be materially 

assigned to only one owner, as well as all elements and systems that are decisive for the 

operation and security of the entire building, obliging all to participate in their 

maintenance. 



 127 

Only through a clear identification of what those elements are and what is under 

common ownership is it possible to establish a system that ensures the maintenance of 

the common parts together with the systems and services that are of common interest. In 

other words, only the precise definition of all the elements that are in co-ownership will 

make possible to assign responsibility for the management and maintenance of such 

property, and create a contribution system among all the owners in pursuit of common 

interests. 

The process of this theoretical construction was not a conceptual process that was then 

applied to the good, dividing it arbitrarily. On the contrary, it departed from the unitary 

character of the property, identified the elements that by their nature are essential to 

maintaining the structure and operation of the building, and considered as private all those 

spaces and goods whose individual ownership does not pose a problem to the unitary and 

functional characteristics of the common good. 

This overlap between private interest and communal interests assumes that every 

homeowner simultaneously pursues private property rights on their fraction and co-

ownership of common elements, having the right and obligation to participate in decisions 

concerning the management of common interests. “This duality of rights – private 

ownership and co-ownership of common elements – will definitely mark the unique and 

original character of this legal model. As in all situations where the antitheses touch and 

complement each other, there is a fertile field for searching for appropriate definitions 

and explanations of a reality that is complex” (Magalhães 2007:86). 

Spanish jurisprudence considered it to be an authentic masterpiece of legal 

construction after 1960: 

The ownership of homes by storeys is an institution of a complex nature, whose 

type is the right to ownership, but within it, it constitutes a class detached from the 

traditional ones, and it is useless to search for similarities or partial identity since 

there is no community because of the private elements belonging to various owners; 

nor does servitude help to explain the situation of all the common things, but merely 

determines relations which only exist between the owners of two or more storeys, 

but which affect everyone. 

As Hang (2003) understands, the most relevant is the relationship between individuals. 

More important than any similarity regarding the type of the good or its scale is the 

structure of relationships that arise around the ownership or use of a particular materially 



 128 

indivisible good. In this regard, also in terms of the scale of the Earth System as a whole, 

the most important point to understand is the structure of relationships established 

through the common use of the same global and unitary system, the Earth System, so that 

a legal abstraction cannot divide it. 

Assuming that the ecological problem is not a malfunction of the Earth System but 

rather a poor adaptation of human society to its functioning, it seems to us that the path 

to a possible solution, rather than ideological or techno/scientific choice, should be a 

technical answer in the social sciences with special resort to law. Here we mean law not 

as a system of sanctions and prohibitions but rather in its prior function of organization 

and regulation of human relations but widened to a global scale. 

 

5.5. Divide to Unite 

 All spaces that have become accessible to humans throughout history have been 

subject to their legal definition. The possibility of humanity as a whole to become a 

geological force capable of changing the state of the Earth System requires that the 

intangible non-territorial space, the living space, represented through the core drivers of 

the state of the Earth System, becomes a safe space where its use is subject to order. 

 The problem arises because this new space has a new character, not geographical and 

territorial, distinguishable and therefore completely distinct from all other spaces 

previously discovered, even when compared to space exploration where the existence of 

intangible natural resources is already recognized today. This non-spatial space is not 

external to the planet but part of the Earth System, and is present inside and outside of all 

sovereignty, creating an inextricable link between the activities of states within national 

territory and its effects on climate (...) an unprecedented situation in international law 

(Borg 2007). It is from this overlap that the need for international law innovation (Prieur 

2012) comes, regarding the still- dominant view that represents reality only under an optic 

that what is common to all humankind are the remaining areas of territorial political 

divisions. A clear distinction between this new intangible space and the territorial 

geographical space is only possible through the use of the latest scientific knowledge on 

the functioning of the Earth System as a whole. The possible legal definition of this new 

space and the resulting regulatory order of its use constitute per se a change in the 

conceptual paradigm of the international legal system. This innovation, because it is 

structural, implies a theoretical framework that allows an overlapping of legal regimes 



 129 

between the res corporales concerning the sovereign territorial spaces of states and the 

natural res incorporales concerning the global living space, that is, the qualitative 

dimension of the structure of biogeochemical concentrations of oceans or the atmosphere, 

which are global and impossible to divide by any legal abstraction. 

 It is this overlap between the territorial space of sovereignty and the global intangible 

space of the living space that requires clarification of the type of res communis better able 

to portray the reality where tangible and intangible spaces overlap and affect human 

relations. The fact that the system is common and indivisible, that all people have equal 

access to it and no one is able to exclude any other from using it, is exposed to all others 

by virtue of sharing globally the damages, which in turn also result in very different uses, 

requires us to look at this deep interdependence from a legal perspective. Everything 

becomes even more complex when, for the same reasons, the benefits realized by the 

ecological infrastructure in the state of Earth System are equally shared by all on a global 

scale. 

 The distinction made by the Roman legal system between source and resource can be 

extremely useful in clarifying the structure of the relationships resulting from different 

uses of the common system. As we have already stated, “res communis differs from res 

nullius in that the source of resources cannot be appropriated but the resources 

themselves are amenable to appropriation” (Oosterlinck 1996:2). 

The favourable state of the Earth System resulted from an evolutionary process 

throughout Earth's history involving the interactions between the living biosphere of the 

planet and the geophysical part, that is, the ecological infrastructures are the sources of 

this favourable state, and that allowed the development of human civilization. The 

resource is the favourable intangible structure of biogeochemical concentrations on the 

Earth System. In other words, the resource emerged from the interactions of the sources. 

 Conversely, in this situation, by its very nature, the source is appropriable (the 

ecological infrastructures are under the territorial jurisdiction of states) but not the 

resource, that is, the resource is dispersed all over the planet and its appropriation is 

physically impossible, as is any legal abstraction of division. In this regard, although the 

sources are under state jurisdiction, with territorial jurisdiction over the areas where the 

ecological structures exist, the benefits realized by these structures in the state of Earth 

System (resource) are inevitably common. 

 On the other hand, if all states use the system, all of them have sources that contribute 

to the maintenance of that favourable state. However, the disparity between areas and the 



 130 

performance of different ecosystems on qualitative and quantitative levels generate large 

differences between states with regard to positive contributions to the maintenance of that 

favourable state. If we add to this discrepancy the differences between different uses, we 

fall into a chasm of inequality. 

 This really is a truly new situation in the history of international law, and neither a 

state-centred sovereignty nor communal sovereignty (in an isolated way) can read the 

relationships established through the use of the same indivisible common system. 

The tension generated by the interdependence of benefits and harms shared on a global 

scale in a juxtaposition of interests is a complex equation that requires a complex solution, 

which does not sit well with the simplified concept of geographic territorial division. 

 In terms of buildings, the success of the condominium model was due largely to the 

dual approach of the internal differentiation. It not only used a spatial criterion in order 

to internally distinguish the private spaces of the common spaces but functional criteria, 

even within the private spaces, that identified certain elements which, due to their 

characteristics and functions, impacted the safety and functional units of the building. 

These would have to be regarded as common since, if the maintenance was not provided 

by the private owner, the damages would be collective. By overlapping different legal 

regimes (private and co-ownership) and simultaneous use of spatial and functional 

criteria, it is possible to ensure the autonomy of private property symbiotically with the 

functional unit of the building. This dualistic approach to the internal differentiation of 

complex property in respect of buildings can be summarized as follows: 

 

Buildings: 
 

a) Space division – Division of the spaces between each private fraction and division 

between the sum of all the private fractions and the remaining parts that are 

materially indivisible (we refer here to the stairs, common corridors, roof, 

entrance, etc.). 

b) Functional division – Non-spatial division, whose criteria is the functional 

character of the building components regardless of their location being within or 

outside the private fractions. Technically, these components are materially 

indivisible, and it is not even possible to carry out a legal abstraction for division. 

In these situations, these components with common functions are mixed within 

the private spaces, creating an overlap of legal regimes. Any attempt to materially 



 131 

or legally divide these components would result in the loss of their functionality 

(we refer here to the building support structure, supporting walls, water supply 

systems, drainage, electricity system, communications, etc.). 

If the approach to the legal organization of buildings had stayed purely spatial, all 

components essential to the proper functioning of the building within private fractions 

would be private. That means that the cost of its maintenance would be private but the 

benefits would inevitably be collective. As a result, there would be no maintenance of 

common functional components, which could lead to a collective tragedy. Without 

adequate legal solutions to the factual circumstances of buildings, the towns we know 

today, although technically possible, would be a political impossibility. 

The legal framework of the condominium is a kind of hybrid property; without denying 

the classic solution of division, it allows the integration of separate and independent 

fractions with the functional unit of the entire building in a symbiotic way. Its legitimacy 

was based on its ability to reflect the facts of a complex reality, and to shape the need of 

property, use and maintenance of the good through an equally complex model of overlap 

of the two property regimes. 

 It seems to us that the great innovation was the starting point for the analysis: firstly, 

the functional unit of the building was taken into account through an identification of the 

structural elements ensuring safety and operation, and only after this task had been carried 

out was the space division considered, which enabled goods that are under a regime of 

common ownership to exist within the private spaces. It was through this internal 

differentiation that defining and delimiting different responsibilities, duties and equitable 

contributions to the maintenance and prosecution of common interests were possible. 

This overlap and coordination of the operations of division allowed symbiotically what 

was once a theoretical impossibility. 

The inadequacy of sovereignty to reflect the real situation in the world is apparent in 

its inability to reflect the intrinsic factual features of the Earth System as a whole, treating 

different realities equally. 

 If we adapt scales and perform the same operation on the common home of humanity, 

the planet Earth, we find an almost perfect similarity regarding the type of 

interdependencies established by relations between neighbours who inhabit a materially 

indivisible building with a functional unit. 



 132 

The growing disjunction between the functional domain of biogeophysical 

interconnections and the territorial scope of sovereignty has transformed the classic 

Westphalian approach into an ecological nonsense.2 The necessary evolution for the 

concept of sovereignty lies in its ability to integrate the reality of the existence of a 

borderless global common that is not limited to the remaining areas of sovereignty. And 

from this integration, in turn, must emerge a concept of sovereignty that reflects rather 

than defies environmental reality (Brunnée 1998). If it is true that international commons 

are threatened due to technological progress and increased resource competition, and to 

reach the point where “the international commons must thus evolve to survive” 

(Shackelford 2008:104), it is equally true that all sovereignties are also threatened by the 

"global commons" still being subject to a legal uncertainty and unregulated use, as is the 

case with the Earth System (which includes the climate). 

The solution will inevitably be a legal construction, and therefore the technical choices 

for operationalizing a global response are not different. These choices can result in either 

a global conflict, as a war of all against all, or the creation of a platform of solidarity, a 

forerunner of a globally organized society. 

 A new organization of global neighbourly relations requires an approach with the 

ability to reflect the overlap of these two realities. For this, a dualistic approach on a 

global scale becomes necessary, as it takes into account not only the existing territorial 

division (where global commons are only the remaining areas of sovereignty) but, in an 

overlapped manner, identifies the functional elements responsible for the state of the 

Earth System. 

Accordingly, the corresponding bio-geochemistry structure of the favourable state of 

the Holocene period should be identified as the most important common resource, which 

should be the subject of a legal definition and be covered by a legal system regulating its 

use. 

The Earth condominium would then be the legal representation of a reality in which 

there is a clear overlap and mix between the tangible and intangible dimensions of the 

Earth System. Legally it would be a juxtaposition between the tangible territorial areas of 

the Earth System under the sovereign jurisdiction of states, and the entire intangible 

structure that moves through the atmospheric and oceanic circulation and biogeochemical 

cycles that, together, determine the movement of energy and materials through the Earth 

System, and on which it is impossible to carry out any type of ownership or legal 

abstraction for division, and therefore is truly a common good. 



 133 

Lacking a physical existence but globally dispersed, the intangible elements of the 

Earth System are, albeit on a temporary basis due to their permanent movement, within 

the sovereign space and should be under the regime of an intangible natural common 

heritage of all humankind / or World Heritage. 

 In this juxtaposition between space sovereign jurisdiction and the common system 

should be a model in which the common intangible natural heritage/World Heritage 

represents the functional unit of the Earth System that blends into the airspace and ocean 

spaces of sovereignty but, by referring to a particular favourable structure of 

biogeochemical elements, a different plan of sovereign powers arises, and may be 

summarized as follows. 

 

Planet: 
 

a) Spatial division – Territorial division between autonomous sovereignty and its 

delimitation in regard to all the remaining parts of sovereign jurisdictions (high 

sea, seabed, Antarctica). This is the type of classic territorial division in relation 

to the physical planet of 510 million km2, resulting from the existing geopolitical 

map. This operation of dividing the res corporales includes also all airspace of 

the sovereign States, the water column of the territorial seas and exclusive 

economic zones. 

b) Functional division – Refers to the distinction between tangible components of the 

Earth System (res corporales), where the territorial division between States is 

performed, and the intangible higher level (res incorporales) of the Earth System, 

which refers to the elements that compose the biogeochemical structure of the 

system, both working synergistically to keep the system in well-defined states. 

The higher level is an emerging phenomenon resulting from the interaction and 

integration of the geophysical properties of the planet with the living biosphere, 

which forms the intangible Earth System. It is a single global system incapable of 

any legal abstraction of division, simultaneously inside and outside of all States, 

and therefore it is common to all humanity. 

 

Within each state there exist ecological infrastructures of the living biosphere and 

geophysical elements, which, through the Earth's history, were (and still are) the source 



 134 

of the favourable state of the higher level. In this regard, ecosystems that are located 

within the jurisdiction of states provide global ecological services that are functionally 

common because they are dispersed globally. 

Consequently, the benefits provided by ecological infrastructures inside sovereign 

territories that contribute to the maintenance of this ecological safety space of humanity 

are ecological services of global common interest. That is, as a result of the overlap of 

the common intangible heritage and territorial sovereign spaces on a global scale, it would 

be possible to include in the intangible heritage the benefits that ecosystems perform in 

the state of the common system. 

It is in this overlap between the intangible elements of the Earth System and the 

sovereign rights exercised on the territories where the sources that contribute to the 

maintenance of the living space are located, as well as the human infrastructures that use 

this living space, that will definitively mark the character of this global res communis, 

which mixes sovereign territories with a common system, with benefits and damage that 

are shared globally. 

In this context of interdependence between the interests of all humankind and state 

interests, the proclaimed necessary evolutions of the concepts of CHM, CCH, World 

Heritage global commons, sovereignty and international law will only be viable if they 

carried out in a theoretical context that recognizes, reconciles and synthesizes through a 

res communis the representation of this overlap of interests and the respective legal 

regimes. 

Among the existing models, the only model able to describe this integration and 

overlap of two possible different legal regimes is the condominium. With the already 

proposed legal separation between the territorial dimension of the planet and the 

intangible elements of the Earth System, and through an accounting system to assess the 

inputs and withdrawing of the common intangible heritage, it’s possible to bring 

ecological reality and sovereignty rights closer together, building a global condominium 

where the common interests of humankind are organized in symbiosis with state interests. 

The application of this model on a global scale results in the recognition that the 

international society is neither a community nor an arithmetic sum of sovereignties. It is 

something complex that should elevate the law to the art of reconciling the extremes, of 

making symbiotically dependent what was apparently incompatible. 

Accordingly, we can say that the functional unit could be ensured through the internal 

differentiation of legal regimes between the res corporales and the res incorporales of 



 135 

the Earth System. However, despite a globally organized society having dealt with 

ethical, philosophical and legal arguments, and whose cooperation today is already 

extended to scientific knowledge, to be more than an idea, it will have to be 

institutionalized and an accounting system found that matches the internal unity of the 

system to an internal equity of human relations established through the common use of 

the Earth System. 

 

5.6. Symbiotic Sovereignty 

The concept of sovereignty has its origins in a matrix incompatibility with the unity 

and interactive character of the Earth System. After discovering the conceptual 

disintegration of sovereignty regarding where the concept is applied, old paradigms were 

transformed into paradoxical uncertainties. Its existence is exercised in a contra-natura 

tension, ranging from the reaffirmation of political authority and the dilemma of the 

effective impossibility of sovereignty being free of the ecological interdependencies that 

drive all states to almost the same level of interdependence, regardless of their 

technological or economic development. The language of mutual and binding 

interdependencies is hardly explained by international law. When a reality does not fit 

into our abstractions, the solution is often the simple nomination of the impossibility of 

understanding the problem. This strategy has a double purpose: it not only serves as the 

way of explaining the inexplicable but also serves to create the illusion that the 

designation of the "complex" is a synonym of its clarification. 

Constructing legal abstractions (boundaries) in the lower level of integration of the 

Earth System can lead one to believe that those mental abstractions are reality itself. 

Although we see clouds, rivers and ocean currents crossing all borders, the lack of 

knowledge about Earth System functioning, with all its interconnections and emerging 

phenomena (which give it a characteristic of indivisible unity), was a key factor in the 

construction of this process of mental divisibility. 

The confusion between social abstractions and the systemic reality of the planet soon 

made evident how difficult and serious the consequences of failing to harmonise social 

representations with natural reality are. Making non-existent, for practical matters, all 

reality that does not fit in the divisions that organize our perception of the world created 

a structural difficulty in clearly explaining the contradictions, paradoxes, dilemmas, 

interdependencies and improbabilities that are the origin of life. 



 136 

These are strange and difficult realities not only for law to clarify in all of their 

dimensions but also for natural sciences, which had to find new words and concepts for 

the apparent intrinsic contradictions of relationships that apparently revealed opposites or 

the opportunistic. These relationships of mutual benefit and dependence were called 

symbiotic. In some cases, these relationships of interdependency imply such an intimate 

interrelation among the organisms involved that it becomes mandatory, meaning that both 

symbionts entirely depend on each other for survival. Non-acceptance and non-

harmonisation of these dependencies correspond to mutual self-destruction. 

In fact, the main feature of the interdependence is the inability to pursue any of the 

interests in conflict without simultaneously pursuing, or at least serving partially, the 

apparently opposite interest. Paradoxically, the consequence of the failure of 

coordination is the deepening of the dependence. The global ecological relationships are 

obligate, meaning that the inter-relationship between individual and collective interests 

on any scale, even the global scale, are profoundly intimate and become materially 

mandatory; that is, it becomes a non-derogable interdependence and humanly 

unavailable. When this "law of nature" does not match a socially structured organization, 

it becomes a real political impossibility. At the level of interstate relations, this 

phenomenon manifests itself through the “sovereignty paradox” (Kaul 2013:27), which 

demonstrates that states lose sovereignty through non-cooperation. 

In this field of contradictions and complexities, it is essential to analyse the different 

elements of sovereignty and their interrelationships. Considering that territory is a crucial 

anchor for global or local analysis (Albert 2007), we also need to understand that this is 

not its only dimension. We need to ask: 

a) Which elements of this collective identity lead to the perspective of sacred 

(absolute) sovereignty? 

b) To what extent does this absolute, almost sacred character that underlies the pursuit 

of individual interests of the state to the detriment of global collective interest, actually 

depend on the present and future interest of humankind as a whole? 

 

For Eduardo Lourenço (1999), each people just is, by conceiving and living itself as 

destiny. Symbolically, it means as if it always existed, carrying with itself a promise of 

eternal existence. It is this conviction that delivers to each people and culture (both being 

inseparable) what we call identity. 



 137 

This interesting and profound definition completely ignores the territorial dimension 

of this identity, and without wishing to diminish its importance, it is certain that some 

people exist without territories, and territories without people. Equally interesting is the 

importance of the temporal dimension in the formation of this "conviction" that is 

transformed into identity. The perception of ever having existed and a destiny or promise 

of eternal existence put the projection of the past towards an unlimited future into the 

centre of collective sentiment, offering people that which is called identity. 

In this sense, territory is much more than a merely physical connotation. It is a 

consequence of life in society, so that social relations are essentially projected towards a 

concrete territory and unlimited time. It follows from the above that the sacred character 

of physical territory of a nation-state comes from the operation in a specific space of this 

symbolic dimension projected towards an eternal future. 

If this symbolic projection of an eternal future is only possible in the context of 

interdependence between all people and the mutual dependence of all people upon a 

specific state of the Earth System, then the possibility of a people’s sovereignty will 

require the creation of a common intangible living space where all people can develop 

this “long-term” unlimited temporal projection. Without it, no sovereignty would make 

sense. 

Consequently, there will be two structural requirements for the emergence of any kind 

of community: 

 

• the need for a locus as the stability element for building a political organization; 

• the need for a temporally unlimited projection of each people in a subjective 

dimension. 

 

Therefore, the subjective dimension of identity includes, in its genesis and substance, 

the conviction of an existential possibility temporally extended to the successive chain of 

generations yet unborn. So, we can say that the future healthiness of a certain territorial 

space where the social formation is located is included in the preconditions of 

sovereignty. The global nature of the "environmental good" transforms the scale of the 

future state territory healthiness into the healthiness of the Earth System. Each social 

formation designed in a particular territory is inevitably integrated into the whole human 

family, current and future, and therefore has a mutual and global interdependence. This 

fact transforms the absolute contraposition between autonomous collective interests of 



 138 

humanity and the individual subjective interests of each state into a new context: the 

benefit of each state lies primarily in the implementation of the common interest or, to 

put into a narrower context, at least while the benefit of each state does not jeopardize the 

complex balance that sustains what we call the common interest. And this relationship 

between the territorial sovereignty and the healthiness of the global living space is 

symbiotically necessary. 

 

5.7. From Complex to Symbiotic 

Although inextricably linked, sovereignty is not in essence only territory. It 

simultaneously contains elements that open sovereignty to the global, to future 

generations and to the common interest of all humankind. 

The proof of this is that since the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, the first exception to the 

principle that in international law there is no autonomous existence beyond state-centred 

international relations was the common heritage of mankind. 

The primary exception to this principle is the international commons. In these areas, 

which include the deep international seabed, the Arctic, Antarctica, and outer space, 

concerns over free passage outweighed the great Western powers’ territorial 

ambitions and Grotius’s mare liberum triumphed. As a result, these regions were 

gradually regulated to a greater or lesser extent by the Common Heritage of 

Mankind (CHM) principle, in which theoretically all of humanity became the 

sovereign over the international commons. (Shackelford 2008:2) 

This exception to the principle of territorial division had its origin in a historical 

cultural process based on the ethical perception that there is a common heritage of all 

humanity corresponding to the fundamentals of life and to the renewal cycles of nature, 

which also includes the temporally unlimited projection of each sovereign identity. We 

can state that the CHM has always existed latently on a higher level to the plan put into 

effect. That is, the foundations, the initial booster reason has always been broader than 

simply looking for a legal framework for the remaining parts of the territorial divisions. 

However, because the scientific tools to define and delimit its implementation were 

absent, it was carried out in an amputated form and in an adverse context. But it is not 

because it is not recognized in its true dimension that it ceased to exist and the 

interdependencies allowed themselves to manifest. 



 139 

 Not to recognize and accept these dependencies is to make them paradoxical, complex 

and deeper. 

Humanity, as an integral component of the Earth System, is immersed in a necessary 

symbiotic relationship with the Earth System. The sovereignty is the human manifestation 

of the political organization of peoples exercised within the Earth System. The symbiotic 

relationships include those associations in which one organism lives on another 

(ectosymbiosis) and where one partner lives inside the other (endosymbiosis). 

The exercise of a symbiotic relationship requires coordination of actions mutually 

beneficial for the relationship but because they are mandatory, no coordination gives rise 

to a mutual destruction. 

Regardless of the system of internal self-organization with which humanity regulates, 

organizes and coordinates the use and maintenance of the system in which it operates, it 

is necessary to find a source of political legitimacy to build this process. It can only be 

found in the existing political organization, within states’ political authority. 

The figure of the 'international' represents sovereignty as inextricably linked to a 

given territory. Yet 'international relations' must not be understood as the area of 

politics among States, assuming that within States political authority rests on their 

sovereignty. Rather, seen from the vantage point of political theory, the figure of 

international relations is more: it does offer a powerful solution for a central 

problem of the political, namely the problem to provide a place in which political 

authority ultimately rests, yet at the same time it hides the fact that this 'ultimate' 

place is in reality highly contingent. It is in this sense that the figure of international 

relations allows to combine the political system's inside program of producing the 

legitimacy of political authority with the political system's outside program which 

insinuates that this political authority in need of permanent production and 

reproduction is fixed against its environment (of other loci of political authority). 

(Albert 2007:53) 

This proposed evolution of sovereignty is therefore a natural consequence of an 

attempt to achieve the CCH through the deterritorialisation of CHM/World Heritage. 

Symbiotic sovereignty is the evolution that recognizes, reconciles and synthesizes the 

overlap of the territorial and non-territorial elements of sovereignty that exist 

symbiotically inside of all states in a single overarching governance condominium. 



 140 

In this sense, the evolution of the theoretical concept of sovereignty turns out to be just 

a reconstruction because the issues on which it could potentially be considered a retreat 

in sovereignty actually had never been in the states’ sovereign jurisdiction, because no 

state alone can address this issues. Sovereignty is transformed without losing its essence. 

On the contrary, only by harmonising the interdependent relationship between all 

sovereignties and the Earth System will be possible to perform the non-territorial element 

of each sovereignty. We can argue that this common intangible living space is the 

summation of all the unlimited temporal projections of all the sovereignties, in which 

theoretically all humanity became sovereign over the intangible components of the Earth 

System as the common natural intangible heritage of humankind. 

The absence of the temporally infinite projection confines sovereignty to the territorial 

element. And it would be the emptiness and the absence of any sense. 

We could briefly review some features of symbiotic sovereignty: 

 

1. Symbiotic sovereignty, as opposed to the absolute sovereignty [which incidentally 

has never been more than an ideal] of Westphalia, integrates a knowledge that absolute 

sovereignty did not have about the territory as a "live" system of relations flows of energy 

and matter (including biologically organized matter). 

2. Symbiotic sovereignty does not abolish territorial sovereignty but changes its nature 

and its mode of exercise because it includes in its formula the non-territorial element, 

temporally unlimited, common to all states, which will be the legal basis for building an 

equivalence platform through the accounting of compensations and penalties. 

3. Territorial sovereignty is maintained as part of the symbiotic sovereignty but under 

two principles of conditioning that should be the subject of a binding international regime: 

a) territory uses may not harm the global common Earth System software or, through it, 

cause damage to the territories of the other symbiotic sovereign states; b) uses of the 

territory may not limit the choices of future generations [intergenerational justice]. 

4. Territorial sovereignty, enriched with this restriction of use, is not a minor harm but 

a good to be stimulated. It corresponds to a demonstration of the classical principle of 

subsidiarity. In this light, the territorial sovereignty must be understood as the best way 

for humanity to be able to inhabit the planet sustainably, making it a co-sovereignty. Only 

through many sovereign "properties" (and not a mega-state that would eventually be 

totalitarian) can we care for the Earth, moving from a predatory relation to a synergistic 

relationship. 



 141 

5. In fact, only in the context of this new territorial sovereignty, symbiotically 

transformed, will be possible to find a basis in law for the construction of a system of 

compensations and penalties, which is an incentive for states to produce positive 

externalities (receiving rewards) and reduce the negative externalities (avoiding fines). 

6. The institutional problem of public international law and constitutional law that 

remains open is that of conferring to the United Nations not a part of world government 

but a political, legal, scientific and financial status to allow it to be it the entity that 

coordinates and administers this compensation system, that sets and installs policies that 

stimulate the correction and redefinition of the self-regulatory mechanisms. 

 

5.8. Earth System Stewardship 

 

The structural evolution of the recognition by international law of this legal global 

object would have cascading consequences, of which for the moment we highlight only 

two: 

 

1) The common interest of all present and future humanity (which is coincident with 

the trans-temporal dimension of sovereignty) would exist via their representation in a 

common natural intangible heritage; 

 2) From the moment the intangible Earth System belongs to someone (in this case it 

belongs to all humankind as a res communis omnium), its use should be governed as a 

trust by a specific law. 

 

In other words, it would be possible to discern one of the possible objects of the so-

called global governance. The use of the word governance assumes that the object of the 

act of managing/governing is identified and defined. This definition can either have a 

territorial or a functional scope. In the absence of a defined object and a clear separation 

of powers among the matters that must necessarily be governed globally and the 

articulation/coordination with traditional powers of states, we need to admit the 

unavoidable emergence of modalities of uncoordinated and unregulated use and the 

impossibility of collective action. 

Taking into account the relationship between appropriable sources and inappropriable 

resources dispersed globally, and the fact of the living space being an emerging result 



 142 

from the integration of the geophysical properties of the planet with the living biosphere, 

we can state that the intangible favourable state of the Earth System is a space of 

biogeochemical flows, whose maintenance of a certain structure of concentrations within 

the limits corresponding to the stability period of the Holocene is vital for humanity. 

Recognizing this safe space for humanity as a common natural intangible heritage of 

humankind would allow capturing and accounting intangible flows (positive or negative 

for the state of the common heritage) that all human actors emit in different amounts. 

According to Carl Folke (2011:8), “A significant part of this challenge is to make the 

work of the biosphere visible in society, in human actions and in financial and economic 

transactions”. 

Since most of the benefits provided by sources (ecosystems) are legally nonexistent 

due to their global dispersion, only a comprehensive legal support can give visibility to 

these positive flows. That is, due to the fact of these benefits being global, in order to stop 

them being "externalities" for the economy and instead become visible to society, it is 

necessary to first recognize their legal existence; only then may they be subject to 

valuation. Since all people on a global scale enjoy these benefits, and many of them are 

provided by sources (ecosystems) located in territories under sovereign jurisdiction, the 

state in which the source of positive flows is located should be financially compensated. 

A structural condition for reaching the civilized journey from explorers and exploiters 

to guardians and managers is that the benefits achieved from the state of the Earth System 

do not constitute losses for the societies that perform them. According to the primitive 

accounting economic methods still prevailing, the value of a forest only enters into the 

GDP and becomes visible in the financial and economic transactions of society the day 

that forest is destroyed and turned into “raw material”. 

Changing this formula and assigning an economic / financial value to the ecosystem 

service requires a legal solution that recognizes the social existence (legal) of the benefit. 

Only non-territorial legal support can uphold global benefits, and, as a consequence, 

financial and economic visibility may be possible. The economy cannot consider as a 

credit a benefit that legally does not exist. 

It is no longer about simply controlling polluting emissions; it is necessary to build an 

economy that is able to recover the natural capital that has been destroyed and create a 

permanent system of sources renewal that assures the maintenance of the common 

intangible space within the limits that humanity should not surpass. This system can only 

be achieved on the scale required if the maintenance and reconstruction of the sources do 



 143 

not constitute a cost or loss to the state exercising sovereignty over the territory where 

that source is mainly located. Without an international ecological accounting system, 

where individual contributions and obligations towards the maintenance of the intangible 

common heritage are clearly defined, there will be no recovery and preservation. No one 

would undertake such tasks when the cost of doing so is private but the benefits collective. 

The shift from an economy of exploration of resources and sources to an economy of 

production of common resources implies not only the existence of a common intangible 

heritage on a global scale but also an accounting system of global biogeochemical flows 

in a wider system of international compensation. 

The introduction of benefits in the system of accountancy of ecological flows could 

have a trigger effect in the sense that for the first time the production of common benefits 

could have some individual (state) compensation. 

When communities, regardless of their size, share the use of the same vital goods, they 

are faced with the need to create a system of shared management. As such, it is essential 

to compare the different benefits and the consumption by each of that common resource. 

The common heritage is this intangible space, where accountability should be kept by an 

international institution (UN) with functions of coordination; that is, if we have a system 

of compensation between the different performances of each state on the state of the Earth 

System, each state will try to have the best balance (difference between positive and 

negative inputs) mainly through self-regulation. To achieve that goal, , the condominium 

governance model, as a universal model optimized to manage global flows in a system of 

international compensation, should be guided by the following principles: 

 

No Winners, No Losers Principle 

In a condominium governance model, the one who deserves to receive compensation 

for the benefits provided to the common heritage is not profiting from it. It is just being 

reimbursed for the improvements in the common good enjoyed by everyone. Those who 

contribute to that compensation (through the condominium bodies) are ensuring the 

healthiness of their own territory and protecting the core element of a temporally 

unlimited projection of their own sovereignty. We live in a symbiotic mandatory 

condition where we are all either winners or losers. 



 144 

Common Intangible Living Space 

We could not protect the emergence of a favourable state but we could protect the 

biogeophysical conditions that assure the maintenance of the favourable state of the Earth 

System. 

The remaining ecological space, scientifically represented by the safe operating space 

for humankind of planetary boundaries, which coincides with the living space of the CCH 

concept and also with the non-territorial dimension of the CHM, is the fine-tuned version 

of the res communis well-defined favourable state of the Earth System in light of 

contemporary developments. 

 

Global Condominium 

Global neighbourhood relations are not relationships of power and domination but 

ones resulting from the use of the same indivisible resources. In the Earth condominium, 

all humanity, present and future, becomes co-sovereign over a well-defined favourable 

state of the Earth System: it is a non-spatial CHM. The condominium is the only type of 

res communis with the ability to represent the overlap of autonomous sovereignties over 

a global common good; it is not restricted to the traditional global commons but spans 

across areas subject to national jurisdiction. In a condominium model, the existence of (i) 

an equity criteria to ensure the fair contributions of each co-sovereign and (ii) an 

institutional arrangement with coordination functions for maintaining the functionality of 

the common home of humanity are necessary. 

 

Sources and Resources 

The favourable conditions of the Holocene arose in an evolutionary fashion throughout 

Earth's history and it is through this evolutionary process involving the living part of the 

planet as well as the geophysical hardware that, for example, the relative concentrations 

of gases remain relatively constant throughout time. In essence, it is the integration of the 

geophysical properties of the planet with the living biosphere that forms the intangible 

Earth System. Thereby the source of this favourable state is appropriable (the ecological 



 145 

infrastructures are under the territorial jurisdiction of states) and the resource (the 

favourable state) is inappropriable; that is, the resource disperses all over the planet and 

its appropriation is physically impossible, as is also any legal abstraction of division. 

 

Occupation of the Common Intangible Living Space 

The over-use of the favourable state of the Earth System, although not corresponding 

to a physical appropriation, can lead to the exhaustion of the intangible living space. With 

climate change comes the discovery that a stable climate is not an inexhaustible factor, 

that is, the incorporeal biogeophysical conditions that determine the state of the Earth 

System have upper and lower limits and, therefore, are exhaustible. The occupation of 

this resource is not realized through a physical appropriation but rather through a change 

in the qualitative state of the incorporeal characteristics of the Earth System. This 

occupation of the remaining living space is the result of a chemical change in the 

qualitative state of the intangible space, and affects its common use. 

 

a) Enlargement of the Common Intangible Living Space 

The ecosystem services of global common interest are all the biogeophysical processes 

performed by the ecosystems that contribute to the regulation of the stability of the Earth 

System within the safe operating space. These services, although they originated in 

ecosystems located in territories under the jurisdiction of sovereignty states, are spread 

diffusely in the Earth System and enlarge the remaining living space where all nations 

and citizens of the world operate. 

 

b)  Credits over the Common Intangible Heritage 

The contribution of ecosystem services of global interest to the maintenance of the 

favourable state of the Earth System should generate credit on behalf of the state that 

exercises the sovereignty or sovereign rights over the source of this benefit, that is, the 

ecosystem infrastructure that provided those ecosystem services. 

 

 

 



 146 

c) Debits over the Common Intangible Heritage 

The more chemical, biological and physical processes, resulting from human activity, 

push the Earth System out of the safe operating space, the “less resource” (considering 

the favourable and stable state of the Earth System as a resource) will be available to all 

agents. 

Because these processes contribute to the depreciation of the state of Earth System, 

and correspond to an occupation of the intangible living space, they should generate a 

debit on behalf of the state that exercises the sovereignty or sovereign rights over the 

place where this activity occurs. 

 

d) Standardize to Compare 

It is necessary to build a common standard pattern that represents the positive and 

negative flows of each country on the structure of the Earth System. Conceptually, this 

new metric should be an aggregation of indicators that represents core processes that 

regulate the stability and resilience of the Earth System. Only by placing the various 

benefits in a common metric compatible with its consumption, can we express, to their 

full extent, the relations to be harmonised. This new metric should be based on the best 

available scientific knowledge. 

 

e) Life Intangible Support Unit – LISU 

The common standard pattern could be named LISU (Living Intangible Space Unit) 

and should be an aggregation of PB indicators (“control variables”): stratosphere ozone 

depletion, aerosol loading, climate change, ocean acidification, biogeochemical flows 

(e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus), novel entities, biosphere integrity, "land-system change" and 

"freshwater use". 

 

f) Ecobalance 

The difference between the production of positive biogeochemical flows and the 

emission of negative flows of each state and the impact of it on the maintenance of safe 

operating space of humanity should be the basic equity criteria of contributions for the 

Earth Condominium. The balance between the generation and consumption of LISU’s is 



 147 

the ecobalance. It allows us to realize the status of the relationship of each state with the 

common heritage, and a structural condition for confidence building. 

 

g) Legal Foundations of Contributions and Compensations 

The legal basis of the obligation to contribute to the maintenance of the Earth System’s 

state is the fact that all states use within their sovereign territorial space a good that is 

under a co-sovereignty legal regime. 

The legal foundation of the right to be compensated for having contributed to 

maintaining the intangible living space is that this favourable state of the Earth System is 

under a co-sovereignty legal regime, and is also inside sovereign territorial spaces. All 

the sovereignties will benefit from the enlargement and maintenance of the remaining 

living space. 

 

h)  Agreed Value for each LISU 

Using all the best available economic information about the cost of environmental 

damage and the benefits of ecosystem services, we must construct monetary value for the 

production and consumption of each LISU. This value must be sufficient to stimulate the 

activity of producing positive flows for the common system, and not constitute a financial 

loss for societies that develop those activities. It will be defined through a convention. 

 

i)  An Intermediate Space 

Only by building a global system capable of crossing, in a comparable manner, the 

positive and negative flows can we build an equivalence platform of fairness and 

reciprocity, where all actors can see their interests safeguarded. In the current attempts to 

organize the collective use of Earth System, positive flows to a favourable Earth System 

are not yet part of the accounts. 

It will be an intermediate space between State parties, where each one could 

understand the contributions from all the others and define its own performance strategy 

in relation to the common heritage, taking into account the prediction of other states’ 

behaviour. 

 

 



 148 

j) Coordination Functions 

With the definition of a new object of law and governance, a new or a reconverted 

international organization (UN) should form. It should have the capacity to address the 

Earth System as whole, tackle the sort of challenges we are facing, and assure 

coordination tasks. Such functions should consist of receiving and redistributing the 

contributions of each State party and gather the different interests then negotiate and 

adopt the necessary resolutions. Failed coordination would result in high costs for all 

parties. 

 

k) The Positive Competition 

All parties, depending on internal policies, might improve their balance relative to the 

common heritage through the encouragement of environmental efficiency and the 

preservation or restoration of ecosystems. 

 

l)  Ecological Trust Principle 

The concept that best translates the idea of sustainable use of this common 

intangible heritage by present generations with preservation for future generations in 

mind is the concept of ecological trust. This trust is the juridical figure with the best 

capacity to fit the virtual tri-polar relation established between different generations as an 

object encumbered with the duty to keep within the limits of the favourable state of the 

Holocene. The elements of trust are: 

• Past generations (Trustors); 

• Present generations (Trustees) – but we need a governance mechanism here. 

For example, states acting within tight constraints via a revived trusteeship 

council; also using own sovereign territory in a way that is consistent with 

trustee obligations/responsibilities; 

• Present and future generations (Beneficiaries) – current use rights and 

inheritors, etc. 

 



 149 

5.9. Final Remarks 

As Vandana Shiva (1999) explains, “The ‘global’ in the dominant discourse is the 

political space in which a particular dominant local seeks global control, and frees itself 

of local, national and international restraints”. Therefore, Shiva continues, “the global 

does not represent the universal human interest; (instead) it represents a particular local 

and parochial interest which has been globalised through the scope of its reach”. Although 

humans live in a global political space, they are fundamentally local beings. However, 

they are also creatures who can create a new type of political space which is not global 

or local but is a SHARED political space as an intangible locus, where humanity as a 

whole, present and future, harmonise their different contributions to the common good 

and ensure the necessity of each sovereignty for the unlimited timescale identity. The 

recognition of one global legal support and an accountability of biogeochemical global 

flows in a system of international compensation is a pre-structural-condition for a 

dialogue between present living humans and the unborn. 

 Now we have the access to the central computer of Spaceship Earth, the condominium 

it seems to be the conceptual legal framework for the Anthropocene, where we can get 

inspired to organize our global neighbourhood. And the ecological neighbourhood is not 

a relation of power dominance. It’s a relationship of symbiotic interdependence, where 

the military or economic powers are not the only factors on the game. I believe that the 

common natural intangible heritage of humankind is also the political space of the 

Spaceship Earth Condominium, where we can decide how to conduct our own collective 

action as neighbours.

Earth Global Challenges Prize: A New Shape 
TITLE OF THE ENTRY: CONDOMINIUM: THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE 

COMMON HOME OF HUMANITY 

AUTHOR: PAULO MAGALHÃES IN COLLABORATION WITH ALESSANDRO GALLI, WILL 
STEFFEN, KATE MEYER, LEENA YENGAR, ALEXANDRA ARAGÃO 

 
 
 
6.1. ABSTRACT 

 
 

Planetary Condominium: the legal framework for the Common Home of 
Humanity 
 

One of the most crucial challenges of the Anthropocene is to reconcile the rigid 

dichotomy between two key diverging approaches for the governance of the Commons: 

on one side, the classic view of Hardin calling for division and private property rights as 

the only way to avoid the “Tragedy of the Commons”; on the other, Ostrom’s suggestion 

of coordinated actions for community-based management of common-pool goods and 

resources.   

Both views, at a global scale, have been derived from a society that is territorial, which 

considers “the commons” to be that which is leftover from sovereignty or private 

property. From a legal viewpoint, the Planet has so far been treated as a geographic 

territory divided among States and the remaining territorial global commons. This over 

simplified one-dimensional view leaves out the core expression of nature – the functional 

Earth System as a single, complex life-support system. As such, we argue that the 

favorable Holocene-like state of the Earth System – i.e., the set of interacting physical, 



 151 

chemical, and biological global-scale cycles and energy fluxes that allow life on the planet 

– is humanity’s ultimate global common that is an intangible and legally indivisible good, 

which the science of the Planetary Boundaries (PB) framework clearly defines as the 

“Safe Operating Space for humankind”.  

The global and non-territorial nature of this intangible space coupled with the 

territorial nature of sovereignty and private property require the views of Hardin and 

Ostrom to coexist. 

To achieve this, we propose up-scaling the legal model regulating human interactions 

in condominiums to the global level: A condominium is an object with a unitary structure 

and common functional systems, which belongs to various co-owners; each co-owner has 

private or exclusive rights of ownership over determined fractions (e.g. apartments), 

while sharing ownership over structural elements (e.g., foundation) and functional 

systems (e.g., electricity). This is the only legal model that, using functional and spatial 

legal divisions, allows different legal regimes to coexist within the same physical space.  

We argue that the functional and spatial divisions found in a condominium are almost 

perfectly similar to that of the territorial spaces of the Planet and the functional 

indivisibility of the Earth System. Thus, for the functional and spatial divisions to co-

exist in a Planetary Condominium we propose a) recognizing the legal status of the 

Holocene-like state of the Earth System as a Common Intangible Natural Heritage of 

Humankind, b) using the Condominium framework to solve the overlap between this 

heritage and State’s territorial jurisdictions, and c) using Ostrom’s design principles to 

ensure the maintenance of this Heritage. 

 

The key outcomes expected are:  

 

1. Autonomous legal object of governance, complementary to sovereignties: the 

Intangible Common Heritage of Humankind; 

2. Institutional framework with the mandate to govern the management of the Earth 

System and Global Catastrophic Risks (GCR); 

3. Recognition of the intangible global biogeophysical cycles as part of our heritage, 

allowing positive and negative global “externalities” to be accounted, internalized 

and managed; 

4. New Earth System Accounting Framework based on Planetary Quotas, that can 

represent all scales, from individual and community, to regional or national; 



 152 

5. Economic compensation scheme based on the balance between negative and 

positive “externalities” and incentives to promote an economy that pro-actively 

maintain the Earth System; 

6. System for financing the management/protection of the Commons at the global 

level; 

7. The ultimate recognition and safeguarding of rights of future generations within the 

international legal system.  

 

Like in the Condominium model, the mission of keeping the common systems in a 

functional state should be institutionalized. We propose the revival of the UN Trusteeship 

Council (TC) to host this mission – working under the umbrella of the Security Council 

as per the UN Charter – for four reasons: 1) It is one of the six main UN organs; 2) the 

scope of its mandate is global; 3) its revival would not require drafting a new UN Charter; 

4) its original mission (administer trust-territories) is analogous to that proposed here, i.e., 

trusteeship of non-territorial global commons (Humanity’s Safe Operating Space). The 

revived “Trusteeship Council for the Earth System and the Global Commons” would be 

the place where local actions get global visibility. TC would become the chief forum for 

dealing with GCRs and other trans-national matters.  

In this new role, half of TC would be composed of representatives from UN member-

states and the other half by specially qualified members of civil society nominated by 

each Member-State. A permanent Scientific Commission, elected by the TC, would guide 

the work of the TC by continuously monitoring State appropriation and preservation of 

the Planetary Boundaries. Its composition would be interdisciplinary with experts 

representing PBs, and appointments of Earth Science experts, ecological economists, 

ecological lawyers, and experts in GCRs and social sciences. 

The TC will deliberate on priorities for Global Commons and GCRs, such as: 

strategies for the proactive management of each PB using systems of penalties and 

compensations; rentals for using global commons; and, transaction fees to finance the 

management of the Commons.  

 

The initiatives first actions would be the conceptual breakthrough of recognizing 

global commons spanning across multiple national jurisdictions, as a single legal object. 

By capturing the most important bio-geophysical cycles in the new intangible legal 



 153 

object, it would be possible to integrate Earth System dynamics within economics to 

create the ideal economy where the provision of positive bio-geophysical processes is 

synonymous with economic benefits.  

The Planetary Condominium model details spatial, functional, and temporal 

dimensions to addressing humanity’s defining challenge: to maintain a favorable state of 

the Earth System for the continued success of humankind on this Planet.  

 

The proposed model integrates and builds on several mechanisms that already exist, 

to make tangible, the intangible concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind. This will 

represent a significant evolution on humankind’s civilization journey, from explorers and 

exploiters, to guardians and managers of our Common Home. 

 
 
 
 

6.2. MODEL DESCRIPTION 

 
 

6.2.1. The Planetary Condominium model: the conceptual framework 

for a new global governance. 

 
The Earth System is a single and deeply interconnected whole and needs to be 

represented for its multi-dimensional qualities. Climate change, biodiversity loss, water 

shortage, food security, pandemic diseases, and many other large-scale problems are, 

directly or indirectly, the consequence of the lack of a comprehensive and interactively 

organized governance system. As Kul Gautam (2016:263) best explains it, “Our 

understanding of the Earth System today is vastly ahead of our organizational capacity to 

[…] manage it” and thus “we need to make a quantum jump to a whole new mode of 

managing the Earth System”.  

The favorable Holocene-like state of the Earth System - today identifiable through the 

Planetary Boundaries (PBs) framework, (Steffen et al. 2015; Rockström et al. 2009)  - is 

a global intangible good, which is impossible to legally divide and privatize. This “legal 

indivisibility” has become one of the most daunting challenges for a globalized society 



 154 

that regards the management of common goods as something that inevitably results in a 

"tragedy of the Commons" (Hardin 1968), and which considers the regime of division, 

private property rights and markets mechanisms as the sole way to solve this inevitable 

tragedy. According to Hardin, if placed in a regime of free access to common goods and 

resources, each individual will act independently in the pursuit of self-interest, motivated 

by the goal of maximizing individual benefits, despite the fact that the collective result of 

such individual action is the sub-optimal use of resources and overexploitation of the 

commons that inturn impact everyone. This dominant underlying reasoning continues to 

misrepresent the concept of the commons as an open-access regime, operating in a free-

for-all scenario where there are no boundaries to the usage of a common, no tools for 

monitoring such use or rules for managing it, and no cohesive representation of the 

community of users.  

Elinor Ostrom (1999) pointed out some basic design principles for successful 

commons’ management, and debunked the established paradigm of fatality: a properly 

managed common has boundaries, rules, monitoring of usage, punishment of free-riders, 

and social norms. Moreover, being a “common”, it requires the existence of a community 

willing to act as a steward of its own Common Pool Resources (CPRs).  

A functioning Earth System is indeed humanity’s CPRs: as such, what is at stake is 

not “saving the planet” but rather maintaining the Earth System in that specific state – the 

Holocene-like state – that is acknowledged to be favorable for humankind to thrive. Our 

“home” relies on favorable, life-supporting intangible conditions and therefore a planet 

outside such favorable state cannot serve as our "Common Home”.  

As humans, we live simultaneously in two different types of communities of interests: 

one at the level of national societies and the other at the global community level. But 

unlike the national communities organized in territories, the global community of 

humanity, is something that, having no personality, appears non-existent and therefore, 

cannot be titled with any definitive rights or representation. 

The “territory” of humanity is the planet, and this fact goes beyond the nation-state 

based governance. Humanity hasn’t yet a locus from which it can base an organized 

global stewardship community. 

One of the main results of this incapacity is the basis of another fundamental question 

of regulation and collective control: “How can a good that belongs to no one be subject 

to a legal regime?” (Kiss 1982:122). In other words, is it possible to regulate the use of a 

functioning Holocene-like state of the Earth System if this belongs to no one and doesn’t 



 155 

have any legal recognition within human societies? How can we manage and protect 

something that is intangible, global and not legally defined?  

Until now, the legal non-existence of the intangible functional structure of the Earth 

System has resulted in a model of social organization in which planetary biogeophysical 

processes are "invisible" to the economic processes; they are considered “externalities” 

to our societal organization, despite being key vital factors for humankind. 

The biogeophysical structure of the Earth System throughout the Holocene epoch – 

i.e., the set of interacting physical, chemical, and biological global-scale cycles and 

energy fluxes that provide the conditions for humans to thrive on the planet (Oldfield, F. 

&amp;amp; Steffen 2004), belongs intuitively to all humanity in common. This means that such an 

Earth System structure cannot be owned, enclosed or appropriated by any State or entity. 

“As a commons it can be used, but not owned, either as private or common property or 

via the claim of sovereign rights” (Taylor 2016:117). These characteristics of belonging 

to all but being owned by none do not necessarily prevent the Holocene-like state of the 

Earth System from being used in an organized and regulated way and passed on, unaltered 

or enhanced, to future generations. 

The transmission of a value is the main purpose of the concept of heritage. The 

principle of intergenerational equity and the existence of the ‘right’ of future generations 

to receive and enjoy a functioning global ecological space confer an inheritable dimension 

to the favorable state of the Earth System. As it belongs to all humankind - present and 

future generations - as a common heritage, it should be governed in accordance with some 

basic design principles of successful commons management, along the lines of the 

innovative theories of Ostrom(1999).  

However, the technical obstacle preventing the recognition of the favourable state of 

the Earth System as a heritage - and thus the construction of an adequate management 

system - is the fact that this “intangible natural good” cannot be defined by the traditional 

understanding of the term “global commons”, as it seamlessly overlaps with man-made 

jurisdictional boundaries – the geopolitical boundaries of nation states. This is a novel 

situation for the current model of international law, which is unable to interpret and 

reconcile the intangible functional system of the planet with the tangible sovereignty of 

states. 

Fortunately, the problem of reconciling seemingly opposing interests in a situation of 

symbiotic interdependence is not completely new to legal sciences as an example can be 

found in the legal model of a condominium.  This model defines a situation in which an 



 156 

object with a unitary structure and common functional systems belongs to various co-

owners, where each individual has private or exclusive rights of ownership over 

determined fractions of the object, while at the same time co-owns the structure and 

systems that constitute the object’s common functional elements.  

On further analysis of this legal construction surrounding our daily life, we realize that 

such a model offers boundless possibilities of management while challenging the 

conventional paradigms of international law: 

 

1) Condominiums represent not just a space-based division but also a legal division 

based on structural functions: stability (e.g., foundations), systems of common use 

(e.g., water, electricity, elevators) and functional elements (e.g., stairs, roof, some 

of the windows). All elements that ensure the habitability and safety of the 

building, and on which it is not possible to carry out any legal operation of division 

or aproppriation - not even abstract – are under a legal co-ownership regime.  

2) Within the spaces that are under the legal private property regime, there are 

elements and systems that are also under the legal regime of co-ownership (e.g., 

some structural walls, water system). This means that by using different types of 

legal division (functional and spatial) it is possible to ensure the coexistence of 

different legal regimes, which are usually incompatible, within the same physical 

space. This is the uniqueness of the condominium model. 

3) If we add to this differentiated division a system of equitable contributions from 

each co-owner to ensure a permanent management of the common systems and 

structures, it is possible to harmonize the interdependence between the individual 

property interests and common interests. 

4) The existence of these two legal regimes in the same physical space do not 

compete with each other, nor does common property limit the full power of private 

property; conversely, the existence of a common property, superimposed on 

private property, has the mandate of solely ensuring the maintenance and long-

term functionality of the systems and structures that all individual owners depend 

on.  

 

With a proper adaptation of scales, the legal model of the condominium thus provides 

us with a solution for the legal organization of human societies at the scale of the planet. 



 157 

The legal framework of the Common Home of Humanity is essentially that of a Planetary 

Condominium.  

In such a Planetary Condominium (Magalhães,P. 2007, 2016), the tangible 

geographical planet – on which abstract legal divisions are possible (boundaries) and 

where territorial sovereign powers are exercised – is coupled with the intangible Earth 

System, which constitute the functional structure of the planet, and on which no legal 

division - real or abstract - can be realized. Such a model would allow recognition, at the 

global scale, of a set of interdependencies and relations similar to those existing among 

neighbors who inhabit the same materially indivisible building, and who have an equal, 

vital dependence on the proper functioning of the common functional elements.  

In such a planetary condominium, the apparent limitation of sovereign powers presents 

an opportunity to redefine the meaning and terms of sovereignty, and opens minds to 

creative and innovative means of problem-solving with the inherent understanding that 

the overall long-term functionality of the Earth System needs to be safeguarded.   

 

 

6.2.2. Realizing the Planetary Condominium model 

 

2.1) The Earth System as an autonomous legal object of governance. 

 

When Arvid Pardo formulated the Common Heritage of Mankind (CHM) concept in 

1967, he realized that the characteristics, principles and objectives of CHM did not fit 

within the one-dimensional view of the planet as a sole geographic area. Conscious of 

this, he sought to avoid the limitations of the territorial approach by proposing an ocean 

space treaty that "attempted to show how the common heritage concept could be 

implemented in the marine environment as a whole"(1975,67). Intuitively, the rationale 

of the CHM concept incorporated the idea of interconnectedness and the impossibility for 

the global commons to be solely confined outside national borders, and managed through 

siloed governance models.  

It is only recently that the understanding and measuring of non-territorial, functional 

and intangible “global environment as an integrated whole” has been created by the 

Planetary Boundaries (PBs) concept (Steffen et al. 2015; Rockström et al. 2009) . 



 158 

Based on intrinsic “hard-wired” properties, the PBs define a combination of 

parameters that together describe the state of the Earth System, thus enabling the 

understanding of the role of interacting chemical, biological and physical processes in the 

maintenance of a favourable state for humanity (i.e., the Holocene), as well as the role of 

humankind in pushing the System out of its stable, desirable state. 

Such a definition of the favourable state of the Earth System and its qualitative 

boundaries is what allow us today to identify the object deserving legal protection – i.e., 

the Safe Operating Space – and in making it a new object of law.  

The recognition of objects of intangible character are not new to legal sciences: the 

recognition of intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO, the good will value of companies 

in commercial law or intellectual property rights, are examples of “values” that, despite 

being intangible, received legal recognition and a legal regime to regulate their protection 

and use. An analogy in scale between these intangible objects of law and the intangible 

Earth System is then crucial to understand and recognize the global and indivisible 

functionality of the Earth System for our society. By envisioning a Planetary 

Condominium, with tangible and intangible parts, we are thus defining a global 

autonomous legal good, one that is complementary and can co-exist with the sovereign 

powers of States.  

The intangible favorable state of the Earth System corresponding to the geological 

epoch of the Holocene has an outstanding value for humankind. It is the meta-condition 

for all current life on the planet, and therefore should be represented appropriately in law. 

As such, we present the recognition of the maintenance of a Holocene-like state of the 

Earth System as a Common Intangible Natural Heritage of Humankind. Such a 

conceptual breakthrough is the essential first step for the organization of the global 

community that must be followed by the development of a new legal system for our 

Planetary Condominium. 

  

2.2) Structure, functioning and mandate of the planetary condominium governance 

model. 

 

To institutionalize this newly defined heritage, the mission of the Planetary 

Condominium - to maintain the Earth System in a well-functioning state for the benefit 

of all humanity and the future generations - should be tasked to an independent institution, 



 159 

acting on behalf of all nations. The activities of such an institution should be limited to 

the elements that fall under the regime of “common heritage”.  

Currently, the only relevant institution with global membership and legitimacy to host 

such a mission is the United Nations (Gautam 2016). In order to act upon the whole Earth 

System rather than its individual components through multiple UN agencies, and taking 

into full consideration the known difficulties in amending the UN Charter (Gautam 2016), 

we propose instead, to revive the UN Trusteeship Council (TC) with a mandate to serve 

the mission of humanity’s Common Heritage.  

In the early 1990s, the TC was suspended as it had accomplished its mandate of 

administering trust-territories. A first proposal for a revival of “UN Trusteeship of the 

Global Commons”, advanced in 1994 by the Commission on Global Governance, 

highlighted the need for international trusteeship to be exercised over the management of 

the physical and territorial environment (i.e., the oceans beyond national jurisdiction, 

outer space, and the related environment and life-support systems). This proposal was 

rejected leaving the TC a dormant body which today exists solely on paper.  

The increased urgency of major global challenges and the realization of the inadequacy 

of current governance systems indicate it is time to start thinking beyond the paradigm of 

sovereign nation-states and conventional market mechanisms to broader planetary 

concerns. Building and expanding on the original idea of the Commission on Global 

Governance, we thus propose reviving the TC as a trusteeship for the Earth System and 

the global commons it represents.  

A healthy and stable Earth System is the precursor to all the territorial global 

commons, and a necessity to mitigate all environmental challenges and Global 

Catastrophic Risks (GCRs). A revived ‘Trusteeship Council for the Earth System and the 

Global Commons” would be the chief forum for dealing with the administration of 

existing environmental treaties and the management of global biogeophysical cycles; it 

would define priorities, compensations, incentives and quotas among all users of the 

Common Heritage.  

This will require a permanent capacity for the TC to take decisions, with expeditious 

decision-making processes involving assessing, monitoring, supervising, allocating, 

awarding and arbitrating. As such, the new TC should function as a true manager of global 

biogeophysical cycles with a remit to regulate and sanction, with the goal of assuring 

stable functionality of the system.  



 160 

The TC would be supported by a permanent Scientific Commission, to be elected in a 

TC meeting. Such a committee would guide the work of the TC by continuously 

monitoring appropriation and preservation of the PBs by country. The composition of the 

permanent Scientific Commission would be interdisciplinary with experts representing 

PBs, and additional appointments of Earth Science experts, ecological economists, 

ecological lawyers, and experts in GCRs and social sciences. 

Our proposal is to put GCRs and Earth System management at the same priority level 

as maintaining peace and security – the founding motives of the UN. GCR management 

and mitigation are a question of security, and therefore are a strategic area upon which 

the UN should intervene.  

Alongside the support of the permanent Scientific Commission, the TC shall carry out 

its mission in collaboration with, and under the umbrella of, the UN Security Council 

(SC) -  “in order to ensure prompt and effective action by the United Nations” (Article 

24.1). Such cooperation and complementary functional competences between the TC and 

the SC is already provided for by Article 83.1 of the UN Charter “All functions of the 

United Nations relating to strategic areas, including the approval of the terms of the 

trusteeship agreements and of their alteration or amendment shall be exercised by the 

Security Council” and Article 83.3 “The Security Council shall, subject to the provisions 

of the trusteeship agreements and without prejudice to security considerations, avail itself 

of the assistance of the Trusteeship Council to perform those functions of the United 

Nations under the trusteeship system relating to political, economic, social, and 

educational matters in the strategic areas.”  

In accordance with Article 29, and to complement the role of the TC and the SC, we 

propose that the Security Council establish a new organ – a Global Catastrophic Risks 

Staff Committee (GCRSC) – (similar to the already-existing Military Staff Committee) – 

to advise and assist the SC on all questions related to the implementation of concrete 

actions aimed at avoiding or mitigating Global Catastrophic Risks, and special disasters 

that could cause serious impacts in the state of the Earth System or could impact at least 

10% of world populations.  

The GCR Staff Committee shall consist of 11 members chosen between the TC and 

SC. It is suggested that the GCRSC composition include 2 representatives from TC , 3 

members from the permanent Scientific Commission and the SC to be represented by 6 

Members to ensure equal representation of world geographies. The GCR Staff 



 161 

Committee, with the authorization of the SC and after consultation with appropriate 

regional agencies, may establish regional sub-committees. 

The legal recognition, through the mechanism of a convention, to protect the favorable 

state of the Earth System as a Common Heritage of Mankind, calls for the development 

of a system for its legal interpretation and application. The cornerstone of such a 

convention would be fair and ethical representation and maintenance of the favorable 

state of the Earth System. Such a mechanism, that finds precedence in the United Nations 

Convention on the Law of the Seas, would allow for the arbitration of disputed decisions 

through an autonomous and specialized international Tribunal. 

 

2.3) Coordination platform for the equitable management of the intangible global 

commons 

 

The most effective means to organize global relationships in the context of an 

international system, where everyone has the power to influence and impact all others, is 

through a system that aggregates and gives visibility to the different impacts produced by 

everyone in all the different scales. Rephrasing Ostrom’s words [8], there is a need to 

clearly define who the users of CPRs are, and who have the right to withdraw resource 

units from such CPRs. 

The Common Intangible Heritage will be the platform where the intangible positive 

and negative global “externalities” are captured, internalized, accounted for, and where 

the impacts of each individual, family, business, city, and nation State become visible. 

The proposed global governance mechanism of this intangible heritage will give visibility 

to all individual or collective actions and their intangible outcomes, whether positive or 

negative; as such each effort will not disappear into a global legal vacuum, thus 

empowering each individual to be a steward of the Planet. 

This will incentivize decentralized decision-making, where tasks are to be allocated at 

the lowest possible level as part of a larger nested polycentric governance system, while 

at the same time, providing feedback on the performance. 

Only by clearly accounting for the contributions of each entity will it be possible to 

create a system of compensation, where equity and the social norm of mutual confidence 

could flourish. Further, by addressing the human use and management of the Earth 

System, we firmly believe that the proposed governance model could reduce the 

environmental-related threats to political instability.   



 162 

 

2.4) ESAF: the necessary accounting framework for enabling the implementation of 

the Planetary Condominium   

 

The mechanism for translating the Planetary Condominium’s legal framework into 

action for implementation, requires the construction of a transdisciplinary accounting 

system able to track and manage nation States’ use of the intangible Earth System. To 

this end, we propose the introduction of the “Earth System Accounting Framework” 

(ESAF). This requires transposing the PBs to a set of scalable indicators, applicable at 

any scale of human activity to assign Planetary Quotas (PQs).  

The PBs framework summarises the complex interactions of the Earth System 

functioning in an intelligible way, and highlights the main trends in its state. However, 

the main limitation of PBs is that the trespassing of global thresholds cannot be scaled 

down to the sub-global level (e.g., nation States) nor compared to the specific human 

activities that are causing it. For example, the PB threshold for climate change is the 

concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, with clear difficulties in then assigning 

acceptable CO2 concentrations to each nation State.  

Once fully developed, the ESAF accounting system would be able to: 1) quantify  the 

extent to which socio-economic activities within nation States degrade or enhances the 

“intangible favorable space” of the Earth System from a biophysical viewpoint and 2) 

design an economic compensation scheme for the maintenance of such a favorable Earth 

System state. 

 

 

2.4.1) The Planetary Quotas 

 

There are 8 Planetary Quotas: carbon, non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs), land, 

nitrogen, phosphorus, water, aerosols, and ozone depleting substances (ODPs). The 

complexity of the Earth System and interrelatedness of the PBs is such that there is no 

direct one-to-one conversion from the PBs to PQs. However, together, the PQs represent 

the same safe-operating-space as the PBs and can be divided or allocated to any scale 

from individual and community, to city, regional or national scales (Meyer &amp;amp; Newman, 

upcoming 2018).  



 163 

The basis of the ESAF is that every person has an equal right to our Common Heritage 

and thus a right to benefit from an equal share of the life-supporting function of the Earth 

System. Each nation State will thus be allocated one quota/threshold for each of the 8 PQ, 

based on an equal per capita share. A consumption based environmental accounting 

procedure composed of 8 indicators – similar in their rationale to Footprint-type of 

indicators (Galli 2015) – will then be used to compare each nation State’s use of the global 

commons against the calculated Quotas. The result will be a balance sheet of Earth 

System credits and debits for each of the 8 PQs, indicating to what extent each nation 

State deviates from the quota. For a climatic change PQ, for instance, a biophysical 

threshold (in terms of tonnes of CO2 emitted per person) could be set, which should not 

be exceeded to maintain warming below 1.5 degrees. A carbon-footprint-type indicator 

would then be used to calculate the actual amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere 

by the consumption activities of each nation State’s residents. This would then allow the 

calculation of the deviation (± xx%) of the footprint value from the allocated Quota. A 

similar approach could be deployed for each of the other PQs. 

Overuse or underuse of the Earth System functionalities – in other words trespassing 

or staying within each of the Quotas – will then correspond to a monetary fee that should 

be either paid for or received by countries, depending on whether they contribute to the 

maintenance of or drive perturbations to the Holocene-like state of the Earth System.  

As explained in section 2.4.2, the monetary valuation of such overuse or underuse will 

be estimated by the permanent Scientific Commission of the Trusteeship Council based 

on the true ecological costs of overshoot per unit of each environmental currency (eg. 

$/kgCO2) and the information provided by Earth System sicentists, taking into account 

the scarcity and availability of each of the core drivers of PBs. Earth System credits will 

likewise be compensated using these same rates, thus making the value of the Earth 

System an integral component of our global economy.   

It should finally be noted that, as the Earth System does not trade one environmental 

impact for another – for example, no amount of safeguarded water would compensate for 

excessive GHGs emission in preventing global warming – the ESAF does not envision 

trade-offs among Quotas. Rather it is designed to drive human behaviour such that none 

of the Quotas are exceeded, and therefore the Planetary Boundaries are adhered to. 

We note that there is much controversy over historic contributions to global warming 

and substantial literature on the ethics of different allocation procedures. However, the 

ESAF differs from previous accounting systems in two fundamental ways. Firstly, the 



 164 

PQs go well beyond the only GHGs emission, and the historic impacts of, for example, 

land use, or phosphorous consumption, which have very different global distributions. 

Secondly, its accounting principle is consumption-based rather than production-based. 

Conventional carbon accounting, for instance, assign responsibilities to the producers, 

and poorer nations, which often devote their production activities to export, thus 

assigning relatively high impacts on the Earth Systems to them, compared to their quality 

of life. In the consumption-based accounting system we propose, the embodied impacts 

of goods and services will be carried over and associated with those nation States 

consuming them.  

 

 

2.4.2) Economic compensation scheme 

 

In her book, Ostrom (1990) calls for the need of congruence between appropriation 

and provision rules, indicating that any successful management of the commons requires 

not only rules on the commons’ use or appropriation, but also a permanent system of 

maintenance and restoration to ensure their long-term functionality. 

As such, planetary stewardship implies not only the control and penalization of 

negative impacts on the Earth System (e.g., the perturbation of bio-geophysical cycles), 

but also the provision to acknowledge, reward and incentivize the maintenance or 

improvement of the functional infrastructures that generate Earth System services.   

In the current economic system, economic gains are realized – directly or indirectly – 

through degradation and/or destruction, that is, in the consumption of natural capital. For 

instance, the value of forests, vital for the maintenance of the favourable state of the Earth 

System for our lives and for future generations, only become visible in the financial and 

economic transactions of society when these forests are destroyed and turned into timber. 

As Carl Folke (2011:8) states: "A significant part of this challenge is to make the work 

of the biosphere visible in society, in human actions and in financial and economic 

transactions”. 

When the production of positive processes for maintaining the favourable state is 

synonymous with economic loss, there can be no change in our behaviour to reduce the 

negative impacts nor can there be any investment in realizing benefits to the common 

Heritage. However, if we recognize the favourable state of the Holocene as a legal 

autonomous good, we can capture in this intangible common heritage not only the 



 165 

damages, but also the benefits that contribute to the maintenance of this favourable state. 

By recognizing and capturing the most vital Earth System services, it becomes possible 

to frame the economic processes in the context of global chemical, biological and physical 

processes that support life and human activities, thus modifying economics to become 

consistent with Earth System dynamics.  

The possibility of using this intangible common heritage for making the work of the 

Earth System visible in society, in human actions and in financial and economic 

transactions implies a deep conceptual and structural shift in our economy, transforming 

the current paradigm of individual benefits and collective costs to one in which individual 

benefits are also gained through collective benefits. In a Planetary Condominium set-up, 

in which Common Heritage and State sovereignty co-exist, the pursuit of individual 

interests would become in tune with the interests of all humankind. 

For this to be possible, our proposal is to use the accounting system described above 

in section 2.4.1 as the biophysical basis for an economic compensation scheme in which 

the overuse or underuse of the Earth System will correspond to an annual fee to be either 

paid for or received by nation States, depending on whether they contribute to the 

maintenance or the perturbation of the Holocene-like state of the Earth System.  

Managing the flow of funds - assigning penalty payments and allocating funds to 

countries with positive Earth System balances - would be a key mandate of the TC carried 

out annually. We envision a small proportion of the incoming funds to be used to cover 

administrative expenses of the TC, with the majority of the funds to be used in tackling 

priority emergencies, paying back historical inequalities (in reimbursing those negatively 

affected by the abuse and/or misuse of the commons) and  to cover payments in the 

compensation scheme to maintain (or enhance) key ecosystems and biomes – located 

under or outside the jurisdiction of one or more States – whose services are necessary to 

ensure the functionality of the Holocene-like state of the Earth System, and to invest in 

transitioning to a sustainable future for all. 

With such a system in place, each nation State shall be given full capacity to define its 

own strategy for conserving or restoring its ecosystems, such as investing in technology 

efficiency or other alternatives, or changing or reducing its use of the Earth System, with 

the mandatory goal of achieving its own best balance in relation to the Common Heritage.  

The inclusion of the positive environmental impacts in an accounting system could 

trigger a positive competition for restoring the state of the Earth System. This would 

encourage a major paradigm shift, from an economy rewarding natural resources’ 



 166 

extraction to an economy which fosters innovation, and where preservation and 

production of natural resources and well-functioning ecosystems are economically 

rewarded 

 

6.2.3. Final Remarks:  

 

Although Earth has a specific physical spatial attribute of 510,000 million hectares,  

we are all globally connected through impacts that each of us produce on the intangible 

biogeophysical functioning of the Earth System. This non-spatial interconnected Global 

Community,  has no territory in which it can base a legal existence or a cohesive 

representation of its own interests. But attempts have been made to meet this challenge, 

and valuable and inspiring examples do exist such as, 

- The Antarctica Treaty System of 1959, that is considered by some a de facto 

condominium (Glennon 1991) since it is not a sovereign territory (although 

various nations claim parts of its territory as their own) and provides voting 

authority for 28 nations to jointly govern the area. In all, 50 countries are part of 

the “condominium” although some consider it a “quasi-condominium” 

(Hemmings 2014).  

- Article 136º of the Montego Bay Convention (UNCLOS) states, “The Area  (Sea-

bed) and its resources are the common heritage of mankind”. This Convention 

adopted a concept of humanity that transcends the notion of State, transferring its 

point of reference to the peoples, regardless of their legal subordination to a State. 

Humanity appears as a transcendent reality to the states and to the present 

generations. 

 

Similar to the findings of Nicholas Stern (2007) for the case of global warming, we 

believe the cost of maintaining the Holocene-like state of the Earth System – especially 

if shared by the global community – is likely to be lower than the future cost of today’s 

inaction. We believe that the Planetary Condominium model is an opportunity for nation 

States to realise and successfully manage its relationship and use of the Earth System.  

 The relationship that the Planetary Condominium model effectively operationalizes is 

the environment (or rather a well-functioning, favorable state of the Earth System) that 



 167 

supports society, which then builds the economy. Further, this model details spatial, 

functional, as well as temporal dimensions to addressing humanity’s defining challenge, 

which is to maintain a favourable state of the Earth System for the continued success of 

humankind on this Planet.  

 

Besides the legal conceptual evolution, another uniqueness of the Planetary 

Condominium model is the novel accounting system combined with the renewal of 

existing global management structures that lead to a very different set of motivations and 

barriers to sub-national and State involvement. Consumption based accounting in 

environmental currencies beyond carbon shifts the spread of environmental burdens and 

opportunites. Not every environmental currency carries the historic components inherent 

to carbon accounting. Thus, the proposed mechanism to operationalize the Planetary 

Condominium does not carry the same ethical and political barriers that have been present 

in past global action on climate change. 

 

In conclusion, the model of activties and operations proposed by this Initiative 

constitutes an integrated evolution of experiences in the international management of 

territories and their extention to the management of a “virtual territory” whose existance, 

despite being intangible, cannot be overlooked.  

The approach of the proposed Initiative is more extensive and representative in 

participation and remit. It integrates and builds on several mechanisms that already exist, 

to make tangible, the intangible concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind. This 

Initiative puts the Earth System and its stability in the spotlight, attempting to empower 

it through a legal mandate, to ascertain the continued existance and prosperity of the 

human civilization. It puts human relationship to the Earth System on centre stage to 

devise a mechanism of management and maintenance. In being able to do so, the Initiative 

hopes to opens new avenues and models of solutions to tackle the urgent and trans-

generational global challenges today’s world presents.

6.3. ASSESSMENT CRITERIA 

 
6.3.1. Core Values 

 

The mission of the proposed initiative is to safeguard the favorable state of the Earth 

System as a common heritage of humankind across all sectors and societies, irrespective 

of geo-political jurisdictions. Such a mission envisions, 

ð the creation of a world in which all countries work together to preserve our 

planet’s Safe Operating Space for humans and all living species. 

ð For societies to be driven by a new economic model that prioritize the 

preservation of nature, not its depletion. 

ð the building of an inherent sense of respect and belonging to our Common 

Home – as citizens of planet Earth, enriched by our individual cultural 

diversities.  

To this end our core values are rooted to ensure scientific rigor and evidence based 

activity and response; assign a universally recognized legal existence to the Safe 

Operating Space - the common intangible heritage for all humankind; practice socio-

cultural, economic and political diplomacy; and, create a platform that allows global 

representation and fosters universal participation. 

This would define the construction of an operational mechanism for the monitoring 

and protection of the Safe Operating Space, that is resilient, allows socio-economic 

equity, functions through active dialogues and is transparent, reliable and accountable. 

 

 

6.3.2. Decision-making Capacity 

 

In line with the core values, the decision making process will be based on scientific 

evidence, with legislative clarity and expedited in a transparent, reliable and accountable 

manner.  

Operationally, decision-making involving assessing, monitoring, supervising, 

allocating, awarding and arbitrating is proposed to be undertaken by the revived UN 



 169 

Trusteeship Council for the Earth System and the Global Commons, with a mandate to 

regulate and sanction, with the goal of assuring functionality of the governance model.  

From the perspective of ensuring robust scientific and technical monitoring and 

assessments, the Council’s activity and decision are to be supported by the Permanent 

Scientific Commission comprised of Planetary Boundaries scientists, Earth System 

scientists who study the whole system, ecological economists, ecological lawyers, experts 

in Global Catastrophic Risk and social scientists. The main role of the Commission will 

be to provide an overview of global effects. This includes establishing of the connection 

between scientific information and assigned monetary values, assessments on cultural 

acceptance, community rights and responsibilities, among other decision-making 

parameters requiring trans-disciplinary input.  The trans-disciplinary composition of the 

Permanent Scientific Commission will be mandated to contextualize and frame economic 

processes in the context of global chemical, biological and physical processes that support 

life and human activities, integrating Earth System dynamics and economics - work that 

no market-mechanism is currently able to do. 

The Earth System Accounting Framework (ESAF) and the Planetary Quotas (PQ), 

developed by this scientific commission would aim to offer rigorous administrative 

accountability and transparency in support of the operational regulation and decision-

making processes. Complementary functional competencies and relationship between the 

Trusteeship Council and the UN Security Council, stated through Articles 24.1, 83.1 and 

83.3 of the UN Charter, lends an important degree of administrative surveillance, and 

therefore further reliability and accountability of decisions and actions.  

Further, to complement the roles of the Trusteeship Council and the Permanent 

Scientific Commission, we propose that the Security Council establish a new organ – a 

Global Catastrophic Risks Staff Committee (GCRSC) – (similar to the already-existing 

Military Staff Committee) – to advise and assist the Security Council on all situations 

related to the implementation of concrete actions aimed at avoiding or mitigating Global 

Catastrophic Risks and other disasters that could cause serious impacts to the state of the 

Earth System or could impact at least 10% of world populations. This would further 

bolster prompt action and implementation related decision-making in addressing these 

vital cases.   

 

      



 170 

6.3.3. Effectiveness 

 

Factoring in the sensitivity of the decision-making process and conscious of the fact 

that only structural shifts will lead to systemic effects, this initiative proposes an 

incentives-based system for the production of global public goods, rather than being an 

exclusive coercive legal system of injunctions, whose legitimacy would always be 

questionable and that no sovereign State will accept.  

In this sense, the effectiveness of the proposed initiative draws from:  

ð the communication of its scientific studies and socio-economic 

management structure that will demonstrate and actively work towards 

driving the perception that prioritizing an ongoing, resilient and well-

functioning Earth System does not result in economic loss.  

ð The fact that even though PQs cannot be translated directly back to the PBs 

(as they are also global limits in different indicators that allow the safe-

operating-space to be divided and operationalized), the PB method would 

still be used to assess the global status of Earth System functioning relative 

to a Holocene-like state. The point here is that the true ecological costs of 

overshoot per unit of each environmental currency (e.g. $/kgCO2) can be 

determined. In this way, if everyone participated, the system would 

generate enough money to cover the costs of mitigation/adaptation – and 

that it would be spent for this purpose. This would remove one of the 

barriers that has prevented some from signing global treaties for limiting 

carbon emissions – i.e. the idea that the money contributed may be 

“misused”. 

ð the economic element of the ESAF / Planetary Condominium model, that  

proposes a   financing system that will not only favor investments in natural 

capital and the preservation of critical Earth System functions, but also 

invest to fight extreme poverty by making sure that individual basic needs 

are met. The accounting system will address inequality between poor and 

rich, north and south, as well as rural and urban people. This could also 

contribute towards dealing with the root causes of politically-motivated 

unrest and in extreme cases, violence.  



 171 

ð its programmatic approach, where we choose to organize management of 

the initiative under the auspices of the United Nations as the sole, truly 

global and trans-disciplinary institution relevant and respected by all its 

member nations. We propose to channel the work of the initiative through 

the close and complementary relations between the TC and Security 

Council (SC) already foreseen in UN Charter, and propose the creation of 

a Global Catastrophic Risks Staff Committee by the SC to ensure the 

possibility of prompt and effective action by the United Nations. Thereby, 

we introduce the Earth System management and GCRs at the same level of 

importance as the maintenance of peace and security, which are the 

founding motives of the UN.   

Further, providing visibility to all individual or collective intangible outcomes for each 

action, (positive or negative) would empower each individual to become a steward of the 

Planet. This will incentivize decentralized decision-making where tasks are to be 

allocated at the lowest possible level as part of a larger nested polycentric governance 

system, while at the same time, providing feedback on the efficiency and efficacy of its 

performance. 

 

 

6.3.4. Resources and Financing 

 

Through its work over the past 10 years the initiative already supports a robust and 

growing team of  

ð Scientific and social science expertise 

ð Advisory board of the initiative in its current state 

ð Researchers and academic personnel 

ð Material resource 

In its current operations of building the core features of the initiative, grants and funds 

have been sourced from Portuguese Governmental authorities and through commercial 

consulting partnership contracts. 



 172 

On the international scale, operations would be supported through the inflow of 

penalty costs and environmental levies that will be charged, once the full penalty, 

compensation and stewardship schemes are in place, implemented and regulated. This is 

to be executed under the following mechanism: 

ð Comparing each nation State’s use of the Common Heritage against the 

calculated Quotas. The result will be a balance sheet of Earth System 

credits and debits for each of the 8 PQs, indicating to what extent each 

nation State deviates from its quota. Overuse or underuse of the Earth 

System functionalities – in other words trespassing or staying within each 

of the Quotas – will then correspond to a monetary fee that should be either 

paid for or received by countries, depending on whether they contribute to 

the maintenance or perturbation of the Holocene-like state of the Earth 

System.  

ð There are other possibilities for financing the Planetary Condominium, 

such as the charging of a modest rental or transaction fees that could 

mobilize significant funds. These could include charges on: military 

spending and arms exports, foreign exchange transactions, international 

trade, airline tickets, maritime freight, ocean fishing, sea-bed mining, 

satellite parking spaces, use of electromagnetic spectrum and the internet. 

ð Knowing that humans have already altered the Holocene-like state of the 

Earth System, entered the Anthropocene, transgressed 4 of the 9 PBs, and 

overshot all footprint metrics related to our planetary resources and sinks, 

it is clear that the sum shall begin with costing penalties and 

compensations.  In an ideal world, the success of our initiative will be 

measured by the reduction of penalties and compensations and a rise in the 

stewardship awards, complemented by observations and models suggesting 

restored Earth System stability.  

The basis of the ESAF is that every person has an equal right to our Common Heritage 

and thus a right to benefit from an equal share of the life-supporting function of the Earth 

System. Through the Economic compensation scheme, fairness and equity could be 

achieved in balancing the responsibility between the biggest users of the Earth System 

and those that provide common benefits. 



 173 

 

 

6.3.5.Trust and Insight 

 

The functions that enhance trust in the proposed initiative and its mode of operations 

are: 

ð the inability of the multiple siloed mechanisms that attempt to answer 

globally pervasive challenges 

ð the fact that the initiative will provide a legal mandate to the representation 

of the Earth System in its favorable state in order to represent the interest 

of all humankind in the present and future 

ð the multiple-levels of accountability – the science, the economics, law and 

governance structure.  

ð Operating through the universally recognized body for peace and security- 

the United Nations. 

ð Open access to the science, the practice of the legal framework and all the 

information that constitutes the basis of all decisions in this initiative and 

its governance 

Most importantly, only by clearly accounting for the contributions of each entity will 

it be possible to create a system of compensation, where equity and the social norm of 

mutual confidence could flourish. 

The initiative highlights the valuable insight, based on observations in science and in 

the natural disasters in the world we see today, that intangible systems are equally 

important and worth recognizing and protecting for humankind to thrive. 

Bringing the basis of human survival and enterprise – the favorable, stable Earth 

System- to the forefront is one of the most profound insights of this initiative. This insight 

has no economic worth of its own but when it becomes the core concern of socio-

economic decisions, it would play a pivotal role in resolving and finding solutions to the 

most complex challenges humankind is faced with today and will face in the future. 

The Law of the High Seas and the Sea Bed conventions that exist to protect their 

respective domains have proven that it is possible to build on the effectiveness that these 



 174 

frameworks of governance have shown to expand the mandate of the Earth System as a 

whole. 

 

 

6.3.6. Flexibility 

 

The feedback mechanisms of the initiative’s model, just as the dynamic nature of the 

Earth System itself, creates flexibility in incorporating new findings and perspectives into 

the decision-making system.  The initiative has developed its operational model based on 

the three principles that Dietz et al. [22] listed in 2003 stated as being particularly relevant 

for problems at larger scales: 

ð well-structured dialog involving scientists, resource users and interested 

public;   

ð institutional arrangements must be complex, redundant and nested in many 

layers;  

ð governance should imply mixtures of institutional types.  

 

6.3.7. Protection against the abuse of power 

 

The initiative maintains the stability of the favorable Earth System as its core 

objective. The construction of the regulatory mechanisms and the governance systems 

are hence focused on this core objective and protected as highlighted below:  

ð Just as the Earth System does not trade one environmental impact for 

another the ESAF does not allow trade-offs among Quotas. Rather it is 

designed to drive human behavior such that none of the Quotas are 

exceeded, and therefore the Planetary Boundaries are respected. 

ð The initiative proposes to be embedded within the UN, as the only existing 

institution with the most universal membership and legitimacy, with a 

General Assembly where 193 members-States have a seat, with a majority 

of democratic procedures in almost all of its organs, with an internal 



 175 

separation of powers and competences in different organs, of which one is 

the International Court of Justice.  

 

 

6.3.8. Accountability 

 

The Common Intangible Heritage will be the platform where the intangible positive 

and negative global “externalities” are captured, internalized, accounted for, and where 

the impacts of each individual, family, business, city, and nation State become visible. 

The initiative has installed an accounting system for its scientific work on Earth System 

protection, its framework of economic activity within the initiative and the governance 

structure as highlighted below: 

ð The Earth System does not trade one environmental impact for another – 

for example, no amount of safeguarded water would compensate for 

excessive GHGs emission in preventing global warming – the ESAF will 

not allow trade-offs among Quotas.  

ð The ESAF system is developed to compare each nation State’s use of the 

global commons against the calculated Quotas. The result will be a balance 

sheet of Earth System credits and debits for each of the 8 PQs, indicating 

to what extent each nation State deviate from the quota.  

ð The monetary valuation of such overuse or underuse will be estimated by 

the permanent Scientific Commission of the Trusteeship Council based on 

the natural capital valuation literature and the information provided by 

Earth System scientists, taking into account the scarcity and availability of 

each of the core drivers of PBs. Earth System credits will likewise be 

compensated using these same rates, thus making the valuation of the Earth 

System a transparent process.   

ð Open access to the databases, scientific material and decision-making 

criteria allow further accountability of the processes. 

ð The multi-layered organization, embedded in the most unbiased of global 

organizations- the United Nations - and the trans-disciplinary team that 



 176 

executes the governance system of the initiative is able to self-check and 

regulate the decision-making process to be relevant, impartial, 

representative, fair as well as contestable. 

ð Just as the international Courts have an international tribunal for the law of 

the Sea, the initiative shall work towards the development of an Earth 

System Convention that is protected by a similar jurisdictional system.

SOS TREATY – Safe Operating Space Treaty 
Draft on the 

COVENANT ON THE MANAGEMENT OF EARTH SYSTEM USE. 
“SAFE OPERATING SPACE OF HUMANKIND” 

AS A NATURAL INTANGIBLE COMMON HERITAGE OF HUMANKIND 
 
 
 

7.1. PREAMBLE 

 
 
Considering that: 
 

• All countries are exposed to environmental impacts, positive and/or negative, 

from other countries. Given that knowledge of this reality is still recent and the 

Earth System continues to be used in a non-regulated manner, humanity has now 

reached a point where it is characterized its own life-support system. 

 

• The main structural motive at the origin of this unregulated use is the fact that the 

Earth System does not exist from a legal perspective, and is therefore being used 

as a no-man’s land (res nullius). 

 

 

•  The global commons were always (and continue to be) understood as the mere 

remaining geographical spaces of political division between states. The ecological 

goods that exist in and outside all sovereignties simultaneously currently find no 

legal autonomous existence within the current legal framework. Humanity, as a 

whole, both in the present and the future, corresponds in the same way to this 

juridical inexistence. 

 



 178 

 

• The global, diffuse and intangible dimension of a vital good such as a stable 

climate, effects from the damage to which are sustained over several generations, 

transform this traditional approach into an ecological nonsense. Today’s doctrine 

recognizes that international law contains a structural theoretical error in its 

approach towards global ecological goods and their intergenerational dimension. 

 

 

• Recent developments in Earth System science, which define and describe the 

Earth System as a whole, provide us with insights into the nature and limits of the 

Holocene epoch (the last 11,700 years) – the only state of the Earth System that 

we know with certainty can support advanced human civilizations. 

 

• It is now possible to understand the chemical, biological and physical processes 

of the Earth System that are conducive to maintaining a favourable state for 

humanity (i.e., the Holocene) and those that act to push the Earth System out of a 

stable, desirable state. 

 

• A tipping point is when a system fundamentally changes structure and function, 

tips over and settles into a new stable state. And the prerequisite to do so is that a 

feedback mechanism, which keeps the system tightly in one state, changes 

direction. 

 

 

• This favourable state, which arose in an evolutionary fashion throughout Earth’s 

history, is an “intangible natural limited resource” on Earth. In essence, it is the 

integration of the geophysical properties of the planet with the living biosphere 

that forms the intangible Earth System, a single global system incompatible with 

any legal abstraction of division. With the shift of the biogeophysical structure, 

the system changes fundamentally from one stable and favourable state to another 

stable state. 

 

 



 179 

• With the growing understanding of the Earth System and the recent possibility of 

measuring its state through the definition of planetary boundaries – (Rockström 

et al. 2009; Steffen et al. 2015) – we now have a scientific basis upon which to 

define the Safe Operating Space of the Earth System. 

 

 

• With the ability to quantify and define the desirable state of the Earth System, 

we’ve made a giant step in order to solve the legal vacuum created by the 

indeterminate and vague concepts that have characterized national or international 

legal texts over the last decades. Expressions such as the common concern of 

humankind, the common interest of humankind, the life-support system, 

intergenerational solidarity, ecological integrity and sustainability now have a 

set of indicators and numbers that encircle and delimitate what is global 

sustainability. 

 

 

•  This new knowledge can be instrumental in the architecture of new solutions that 

allow us to overcome the existing dysfunctionality between ecological reality and 

the current legal constructions. 

 

 

• Throughout history, newly discovered spaces became objects of legal definition. 

The knowledge of this intangible and non-territorial Safe Operating Space of the 

Earth System obliges our social institutions to respond to the most recent scientific 

evolutions and build new representations capable of going beyond the reductionist 

legal, physical or biological approach that represents nature merely as a 

geographically delimited space or as a collection of biological species that can 

benefit from legal protection. 

 

 

• To achieve this fundamental shift, we need to be capable of representing the Earth 

System as a whole in international law. To do this in a legal sense, we need to 



 180 

identify the legal status of the Earth System. “How can a good that belongs to no 

one be subject to a legal regime?  (Kiss 1982:122)? 

 

 

• In this sense, the first step to structurally organizing this interdependence is to 

achieve a clear delimitation of the common good/resource to be protected (both 

inside and outside of all sovereignty) and upon which we all depend. Only then 

we have the structural conditions to be possible organize its use in a sustainable 

way. 

 

 

• To make this evolution real, every benefit and/or damage made to the Earth 

System can no longer disappear into a “legal black hole”. Economics calls those 

benefits and/or damages “positive and negative externalities” but they cannot be 

“external” to our societies. 

 

 

• If we are able to identify and measure the core global drivers that define the state 

of the Earth System, we have the necessary conditions to start to manage its use. 

Once it is measured, it can be managed and operationalized. 

 

 

• In the theory of international public domain, it is possible to attribute certain goods 

to interests of the community without changing the rules of jurisdiction, that is, 

without subtracting these goods from the sovereignty of territorial states or from 

the property of other entities. 

 

 

• Today’s institutional architecture does not operate as a governance system capable 

of addressing global challenges and rising above the fragmentation, segmentation 

and incoherence that result in today’s ineffective institutions. 

 

 



 181 

• Before undertaking a practical reform, we need a new approach able to close the 

gap between the theory that underlies the organization of international institutions 

and the reality of Earth System dynamics. 

 

 

• If we are able to create a new legal fiction capable of addressing the intangible 

quality and the non-territorial dimension of the Earth System state, which has a 

dialectical relationship with tangible territories of states but is not confined to any 

state (and therefore cannot be considered a subtraction to a sovereign power of a 

state), we can create a legal object distinguishable from every sovereignty. 

 

 

• The actual legal inexistence leads to the absence of a scheme of contributions or 

responsibilities to ensure both the maintenance and necessary improvements for a 

well-functioning Earth System, and leads to the lack of an administrator (or an 

institution with similar functions) in charge of ensuring its ongoing maintenance 

in a sustainable way. 

 

 

• A legal model for the Anthropocene requires a regulation responsible for ensuring 

the protection and promotion of common interests through the construction of a 

new way that represents the interests of all humankind, both in the present and the 

future. 

 
 
Mindful of the will of the peoples, set out solemnly in the Charter of the United Nations, 

to safeguard the values and principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human 

Rights and all other relevant instruments of international law, 

 

Concerned by the fate of future generations in the face of the vital challenges of this 

century,  

 

Conscious that, at this point in history, the very existence of humankind and its 

environment are threatened, 



 182 

 

Recalling the UNESCO Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generations 

towards Future Generations from 21 October to 12 November 1997, 

 

Bearing in mind that the fate of future generations depends to a great extent on decisions 

and actions taken today, and that present-day problems, including poverty, technological 

and material underdevelopment, unemployment, exclusion, discrimination and threats to 

the environment must be solved in the interests of both present and future generations, 

 

Convinced that there is a moral obligation to formulate behavioural guidelines for the 

present generations within a broad, future-oriented perspective, 

 

TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the need to define and develop the provisions of 

international instruments in relation to the Earth System use… have agreed on the 

following: 

 
 

 
GENERAL DISPOSITIONS 

 
 

 
7.2. PART 1 – OBJECTIVE 

 
ARTICLE 1 

 
Objective 

 
This Draft Covenant provides a legal framework with the aim of transforming our 
common inhabitation of the planet from a system of exploitation to a system of 
stewardship of the Earth System through a process of self-organization to manage its use. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



 183 

7.3. PART 2 – FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES 

 
Conscious that the global and deeply interconnected functioning of the Earth System 
requires new organizational solutions, all parties shall cooperate in a global partnership, 
looking for new pathways to achieve the objective of this covenant by the following 
fundamental principles: 

 

ARTICLE 2 
 

Earth System 
 
The Earth System consists of the interacting physical, chemical and biological processes 
that cycle materials and energy throughout the system at the planetary level. In essence, 
it is the integration of the geophysical properties of the planet with the living biosphere 
that forms the intangible Earth System, a single global system incapable of any legal 
abstraction of division. A key process of the Earth System is self-regulation, which 
consists of feedback loops formed by component parts of the system (both inside and 
outside of all sovereignties), which work synergistically to keep the system within well-
defined states. 
Humans and our activities are an integral part of the Earth System. 
 

 
ARTICLE 3 

 
The Planet and the Earth System 

 
 
Throughout the history of planet Earth, on a geological timescale, the Earth System has 
always existed in a process of permanent transformation. Recent scientific developments 
defined and described the Earth System as a whole, and provided a well-defined 
biogeophysical structure of the Holocene epoch, the only state of the Earth System that 
we know for certain can support advanced human civilizations. 
The recognition that the planet Earth and the Earth System’s state are two distinct 
concepts is a structural prerequisite to enable a global legal approach. 
 
 

ARTICLE 4 
 

The Qualitative State of the Earth System 
 
The Earth System is a single and complex system that exists within the boundaries of 
well-defined states. It’s now possible to understand the chemical, biological and physical 



 184 

processes of the Earth System that are conducive to maintaining a favourable state for 
humanity (i.e., the Holocene) and those that act to push the Earth System out of a stable, 
desirable state. 
 
 

ARTICLE 5 
 

Planetary Boundaries 
 
The Planetary Boundaries (PB) framework provides a scientific basis upon which it is 
possible to define the features of the Safe Operating Zone for humankind, strongly 
oriented towards maintaining a relatively stable state of the Earth System, one that is very 
similar to that of the past 12,000 years (Holocene). From a human perspective, PBs are 
biogeophysical limits that define the state of the Earth System, that exist through the 
identification of control variables and tipping points from which irreversible abrupt global 
changes may occur. 

 
ARTICLE 6 

 
A Limited Resource 

 
The favourable state of the Earth System arose in an evolutionary process involving the 
interactions between the living biosphere as well as the geophysical part. Given that there 
are human activities that cause chemical, biological and physical alterations that are 
conducive to pushing the Earth System out of this desirable state, we can consider that 
this “favourable state” as a vital good exhaustible through its use. In this sense it is “an 
intangible natural limited resource” on Earth. 
 
 

ARTICLE 7 
 

The Source/Resource Relation 
 
From a historical perspective, the favourable state of the Earth System is the result of 
interactions between the living biosphere and the geophysical properties, that is, in this 
sense the ecological infrastructures of biosphere are sources that contributed and still 
contribute to maintain this resource. 
 

 
ARTICLE 8 

 
Remaining Ecological Space on Earth 

 
From the moment we are aware that this favourable biogeophysical structure of the Earth 
System is exhaustible, internal relations are equally reconfigured among all users of that 



 185 

resource. We need rules in order to organize the relations established around the use of 
the remaining ecological space for human development, which, by being exhaustible, 
cannot be used in a free-access regime. 
 

ARTICLE 9 
 

Legal Indivisibility 
 
The Earth System as a single and integrated system cannot be included within any already 
existing legal convention because it is impossible to divide it conceptually, materially, or 
through any legal abstraction. Therefore it must be considered a common resource. 
 

ARTICLE 10 
 

A Common Intangible Space 
 
Once the use of this limited vital good is not exclusive to any “user” and no “user” can 
deny access to any other, in global terms we are facing a situation where all people are 
exposed to the acts of others, creating an interdependence of benefits and harms shared 
on a global scale. 
In this sense its use requires organization amongst users that defines privileges and 
responsibilities. 
 

 
ARTICLE 11 

 
A Primordial Resource 

 
The exceptional stable conditions of the Holocene period, unique in the history of the 
Earth, are a gift that nature has produced for the use of all humanity, today and tomorrow. 
It’s something that due to its indispensable value to life, belongs to all members of the 
whole human race and represents more than the sum of individual interests of states. It is 
a supreme value and primordial resource. 
 
 

ARTICLE 12 
 

The Patrimonial Dimension 
 
The supreme vital value for humanity, the principle of intergenerational equity and the 
existence of the ‘right’ of future generations to receive and enjoy an ecological space that 
supports their survival confers a patrimonial dimension to the Earth System state within 
the limits of a Safe Operation Space, since the transmission of a value is the main purpose 
of the concept of heritage. 
 



 186 

 
 

ARTICLE 13 
 

Common Home of Humanity 
 
A planet in an undesirable state, which is not able to provide for human ecological needs, 
will not serve as our common home. In this sense, the common home of humanity, rather 
than the tangible geographic area of 510 million Km2 of the planet, is an intangible well-
defined state of the Earth System, the “Safe Operating Space” (i.e., a Holocene-like state 
of the Earth System). 
 

 
ARTICLE 14 

 
Intangible Space of Interconnection and Innovation 

 
The evolution of the international community added to recent scientific developments on 
Earth Sciences and the need to address a growing interconnection on global governance 
justify the expansion of the restricted legal contours of the common heritage of 
humankind or the World Heritage to new situations where the survival of the human 
species and life on the planet are at stake. 
 

a) The doctrine considered the common heritage of mankind regime flexible enough 
to adapt to the emerging challenges the discovery of new resources and values, 
such as scientific research; 

b) It is of notable interest to understand that all the substitutes and derived concepts 
gravitating around the common heritage of mankind seek to plant a seed for the 
development of a normative framework as to offer alternatives to govern the 
global common goods, and not only the areas and resources beyond jurisdictions; 

c) World Heritage has already done the course from Material Cultural Heritage to 
Intangible Cultural Heritage. It seems that this same course can now be 
reproduced in relation to Natural Heritage; 

d) The protection of the Earth System as a World Heritage complies with the 
functions of UNESCO as a “laboratory of ideas, standard-setter, clearing house, 
capacity-builder in Member States in UNESCO’s fields of competence, and 
catalyst for international cooperation”. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 



 187 

7.4. PART 3 - PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE INTANGIBLE 

NATURAL SPACE 

 
 

ARTICLE 15 
 

Common Heritage of Humankind and World Heritage Evolution 
 
The Earth System within the limits of a Holocene-like state is a vital primordial resource 
that belongs to all humanity, present and future. By this fact it exists simultaneously inside 
and outside all sovereignties, and demands one theoretical evolution on the Common 
Heritage of Humankind and World Heritage concepts, which finds its expression in the 
provisions of this Treaty. 

 
 

ARTICLE 16 
 

Safe Operating Space for Humankind 
 
The human way to represent this primordial resource is throughout a set of indicators 
within the larger system that regulates the stability of the Earth System. These quantitative 
interconnected boundary levels create the safe operating space for humankind, which 
allow for the delimitation and measurement of a non-territorial common heritage of all 
humankind. These indicators should also function as a standard reference to guide the 
future management of the Earth System use. 
 
 

ARTICLE 17 
 

Just and Fair Operating Space for Humankind 
 
Planetary boundaries are not only a safe space in biophysical terms but could also be used 
to achieve equity, fairness, and a just distribution of the remaining ecological space on 
Earth. 
 
 

ARTICLE 18 
 

Governance System 
 
The planetary boundaries are a truly integrated analysis where all boundaries are 
interconnected, where a critical transition of one boundary could have feedback 



 188 

consequences on the entire system. Therefore, this safe space represents more than the 
sum of the different indicators, and demands governance based on a systemic approach. 
 
 

ARTICLE 19 
 

Equity 
 
State parties have the right to use the Earth System without discrimination of any kind on 
the basis of equality, equity and in accordance with international law and the terms of this 
Treaty. 

 

ARTICLE 20 
 

Accountancy 
 
The common heritage will be this intangible space where accountability should be carried 
out by an international institution (UN) with coordinating functions, that is, if we have a 
system of compensation between the different performances of each state on the Earth 
System state, each state will try to have the best balance (difference between positive and 
negative inputs), mainly through self-regulation. 

 
ARTICLE 21 

 
Common Standard Pattern 

 
For collective action to become possible, some structural conditions are required. One of 
them is the ability to measure and compare each action in regard to the maintenance of 
the favourable state of the Earth System. If equality consists of treating equally what is 
equal and inequality what is unequal, knowing what is equal and what is unequal 
presupposes a fixed point, a standard pattern that only law can offer. 

 

 
ARTICLE 22 

 
International Institutionalization 

 
Taking into account the characteristic of non-exclusion of access to this common vital 
resource on a global scale, the application of fundamental principles of the common 
heritage of humankind to a well-defined state of the Earth System implies that its use 
should be managed in an international and institutionalized form. 



 189 

 

ARTICLE 23 
 

International Regime 
 
State parties adhering to this Agreement hereby undertake to establish an international 
regime, including appropriate procedures, to govern the use of our primordial natural 
resource composed by a relatively stable state of the Earth System, one that is very similar 
to that of the past 12,000 years. This provision shall be implemented in accordance with 
Article 22 of this Agreement. 
 

 
ARTICLE 24 

 
Main Purposes of the International Regime 

 
 

The main purposes of the international regime to be established shall include: 

(a) Ecosystem Services of Global Interest 
 
The Ecosystem Services of Global Common Interest are all the biogeophysical processes 
performed by the ecosystems that contribute to regulating the stability of the Earth System 
within the safe operating space. These services, although originated in ecosystems located 
in territories under the jurisdiction of sovereignty states, are spread diffusely in the Earth 
System, providing benefits to all humankind, thus they are inevitably global and a 
common interest. 
 

(b) Credits over the Common Intangible Heritage 
 
Ecosystem Services of Global Interest are considered all the benefits of the Earth System 
provided by the biosphere. Because they contribute to the maintenance of the state of the 
Earth System within the safe operating space, they generate a credit on behalf of the state 
that exercises sovereignty or sovereign rights over the ecosystem infrastructure that 
provided those ecosystems services. 

(c) Debits over the Common Intangible Heritage 
 
The chemical, biological and physical processes resulting from human activity that are 
conducive to pushing the Earth System out of the safe operating space generate a debit 
on behalf of the state that exercises sovereignty or sovereign rights over the place where 
this activity develops. 
Because they undermine the stability of the Earth System, they constitute a depreciation 
of the common heritage. 



 190 

 
 (d) Common Metric 
 
It is necessary to build a common standard pattern that represents the impacts (positive 
and negative) of each country on the structure and functioning of the Earth System. 
Conceptually, this new metric should be an aggregation of indicators that represent core 
processes that regulate the stability and resilience of the Earth System. This new metric 
should be based on the best available scientific knowledge. 

(e) Life-Support Unit 
 
The common standard pattern could be named “LSU – Life-Support Unit” and should be 
composed of an aggregation of PB indicators (“control variables”): stratosphere ozone 
depletion, aerosol loading, climate change, ocean acidification, biogeochemical flows 
(e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus), novel entities, biosphere integrity, land-system change and 
freshwater use. 

 
(f) EcoBalance 
 

 Ecobalance is the difference between the positive and negative contributions of each 
State party to the maintenance of the Safe Operating Space of Humanity, that is, it is the 
difference between the production and consumption of LSUs. It allows us to realize the 
status of the relationship of each state with the common heritage, and should be the base 
criteria for the building of a system of contributions and compensations for its 
maintenance. 

 

(g) System of Contributions 
 
The basic criteria to establish the contributions of each state for the common heritage are 
the different balances of each country for the maintenance of the Earth System within the 
limits of a Holocene-like state of the planet. All parties, depending on internal policies, 
might improve their balance relative to the common heritage, either through the 
encouragement of environmental efficiency and preservation or restoration of 
ecosystems. 
 
(H) An Intermediate Space 

The new legal fiction of the Earth System should function as an intermediate space 
between State parties, where each state could understand the contributions from all the 
others and define its own performance strategy in relation to the common heritage, taking 
into account the prediction of the behaviour of other State parties. 

 



 191 

(J) Agreed Value for Each LSU 

Using all the best available economic information about costs of environmental damages 
and benefits of ecosystem services, we must construct one monetary value for the 
production and consumption of each LSU. This value will be defined through a 
Convention. 

 

(l) Coordination Functions 

With the definition of a new object of law and governance, a new or a reconverted 
international organization should emerge. It should have the capacity to address the Earth 
System as a whole, tackle the sort of challenges we are facing and assure the coordination 
tasks. It consists of receiving and redistributing the contributions of each State party and 
gathering the different interests in play, negotiating and adopting the necessary 
resolutions. 
 
 
(m) Resilience Priority 

The funds resulting from the accounting system payments should be used for setting 
compensation and restoration agreements with countries that exercise sovereignty on 
priority ecosystems for the maintenance of the stable regulation of the Earth System. 

 
(n) Historical Responsibility in the Use of Common Heritage 

 
The different historical responsibilities are well recognized in the use of this vital heritage 
for humanity. The different negative and positive contributions, the previous lack of 
knowledge about the global and cumulative consequences of the human activities, and 
the recent knowledge of the role of well-determined ecosystems, whose destruction could 
result in abrupt consequences in the regulation of the Earth System, should be 
appropriately weighted in the formulation of correction factors in the redistribution 
system. The common purpose of restoring this heritage within the levels necessary to 
ensure the sustainability of future generations of all the people of the world is a common 
objective to all members of the human species. The past cannot preclude the construction 
of the future.

PARTE II Common Home of Humanity Survey 
 

 
Building the first 3-years institutional strategy together 

 
 
 
8.1. O Projeto  

 
Nascido no Porto em 2007, o projeto Condomínio da Terra teve desde a sua origem o 

objetivo de procurar soluções teóricas e práticas para o problema da inadequação do 

conceito de soberania refletir a realidade global, una e interdependente do Sistema 

Terrestre. Este projeto transformou-se na Casa Comum da Humanidade que hoje é uma 

parceria internacional que junta juristas e cientistas ligados às ciências naturais e sociais 

de todo o mundo no âmbito de uma parceria informal entre o Curso de Doutoramento em 

Ecologia Humana da Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Universidade do Porto, Universidade 

de Coimbra, University of Auckland e o Instituto International de Derecho y Medio 

Ambiente de Madrid, University de Siena (Indicadores ecológicos), Australian National 

University, Planetary Boundaries/Stockholm Resilience Centre (Ciências do Sistema 

Terrestre), University of Curtin in Perth Australia, e o Global Footprint Network 

(Metricas). Foi igualmente iniciada uma colaboração próxima com a ESA - Agência 

Espacial Europeia.  

O resultado desta já longa investigação aponta como origem estrutural da tragédia 

resultante do uso desregulado do Sistema Terrestre, o facto do Sistema Terrestre não 

existir juridicamente, cujo o resultado dá origem a que ser utilizado como res nullius. 

Essa será mesmo a primeira causa estrutural da crise ecológica.  

A motivação aglutinadora desta equipe multidisciplinar de académicos de diferentes 

áreas, foi o reconhecimento de que uma nova abordagem jurídica global é um pressuposto 

para a construção de uma solução que nos permitirá construir a Casa Comum, onde a 

interligação entre direitos humanos e meio ambiente pode encontrar um locus de 

representação social. A visão do papel central do direito e dos juristas nesta missão 

pluridisciplinar, começa a encontrar ecos um pouco por todo o mundo. Na recente 



 204 

Conference Global Pact for the Environment, que teve lugar na Universidade de 

Columbia, Nova York, o Prof. Jeffrey Sachs afirmou: “This initiative for a Global Pact 

for the Environment calls on the world’s leading jurists to help craft an agreement that in 

my view should have two strong bases,” said Sachs. “One is the legal framework rights 

to environmental safety, climate safety, protection of biodiversity, standards of behavior 

and clear methods for protecting those rights. The second should be a clear global 

governance based at the United Nations.” Said Sachs, “We have a UN Security Council 

for War and Peace. We need, in my personal view, a UN Security Council for the 

Environment.” 

 

 

 

8.2. Metodologia da pesquisa 

 

A formação deste grupo de pessoas que suporta neste momento o projeto “Casa 

Comum da Humanidade” não obedeceu a um plano prévio de seleção, antes pelo 

contrário, emergiu de um processo a que poderíamos chamar de seleção natural. Aliás, a 

ter existido alguma seleção, essa terá ocorrido apenas na fase elaboração das listas de 

convidados para oradores. Depois do contacto inicial possibilitado por estes eventos, foi 

no exercício da partilha de pontos de vista e interesses comuns que resultou a formação 

de um grupo pluridisciplinar com origens espalhadas um pouco por todo o mundo, que 

irá em breve dar origem a um grupo formal, a constituição de uma nova pessoa coletiva: 

a Casa Comum da Humanidade. 

Como este processo foi de resultado de processo involuntário, nunca o grupo se 

tinha debruçado sobre o seu próprio processo de formação, tentando perceber qual 

motivação e compreensão detalhada das suas crenças, atitudes, valores e interesses que 

levaram ao encontro destes atores sociais neste contexto social específico. 

No sentido identificar os sentimentos e valores subjacentes que estiveram na base da 

formação espontânea deste grupo, de mapear as disponibilidades e aptidões individuais, 

bem como de perceber as expectativas que cada participante tem relativamente à Casa 

Comum da Humanidade, decidiu-se realizar uma pesquisa qualitativa com os seguintes 

objetivos preliminares: 

 



 205 

• Compreensão preliminar de perceções individuais; 
• Identificar quais os valores comuns e o significado pessoal do projeto; 
• Grau de envolvimento; 
• Questões que estão em todas as mentes. 

 

E os seguintes objetivos específicos: 

 

• Identificação de pontos fracos e pontes fortes do projeto; 

• Averiguar os motivos que levaram ao envolvimento de cada um neste projeto; 

• Conhecer a opinião dos envolvidos sobre o percurso já realizado; 

• Identificar expectativas para fundar a construção de uma estratégia comum; 

• Descobrir fatores que influenciam a perceção externa da Casa Comum da 

Humanidade; 

• Identificar a motivações; 

• Competências e valor que cada um traz ao processo; 
• Da interação construir um sentido para o próprio projeto; 

• Estabelecer uma estratégia institucional de 3 anos. 

 

Para a realização desta pesquisa foi enviado por email um conjunto de questões, cuja 

ordem e redação permaneceram invariáveis para todos os entrevistados, combinando 

perguntas abertas e fechadas, sem limitação de espaço, onde o entrevistado tem a 

possibilidade de desenvolver as suas ideias sobre a questão proposta.  

Uma vez que o “entrevistador” está também envolvido no projeto, e que o seu 

contributo é da maior relevância para interagir com os restantes participantes na obtenção 

dos resultados, ele próprio preencheu o questionário.  

O grupo focal foi selecionado entre os autores do Livro SOS- Treaty, e outros 

elementos provenientes do Steering Committee da Casa Comum da Humanidade. No 

total a pesquisa foi enviada para 24 pessoas (18 membros do Steering Commitee e 6 

membros do Board). No total foram recebidas 11 respostas. As respostas reforçaram as 

convicções já existentes e ajudaram a esclarecer os pontos de vista e os pontos fortes de 

quem respondeu à pesquisa. 

Para isto, criou-se um formulário, que na essência pretendia dar criar uma perceção 

comum relativamente a estes assuntos:  

 



 206 

• Strength 

• Weaknesses 

• Short-term challenges 

• Mid-term challenges 

• Long-term challenges 

• Overall definition of sucess 

• Current responsability 

• Valuable input/potential role

NAME:	Alessandro	Galli	

INSTITUTION:	GFN	and	CHH	

ROLE	IN	THE	CURRENT	ACTIVITIES	OF	CHH:	Board	member,	international	coordinator	(supposedly)	
and	scientific	advisor.		

	

	

Q1.	What	is	the	one	main	reason	for	you/	your	institution	to	support	CHH?	

	

Q2.	What	is	the	most	attractive	feature	of	CHH?	

	

I	support	CHH	as	I	came	to	realize	in	the	past	few	years	that	addressing	sustainability	can	
only	be	possible	if	the	enabling/structural	conditions	that	affect	our	decision	making	process	
is	addressed	first.	My	sense	is	that	our	society	finally	has	most	of	the	scientific	knowledge	
needed	to	understand	the	problem	and	identify	solutions	but	our	governance	and	law	
system	is	completely	unequipped	to	be	able	to	favor	“sustainable	choices”.	So,	we	need	to	
change	the	rule	of	the	game.			

The	idea	of	considering	the	Earth	System	(in	its	functioning	state)	as	a	heritage	of	
mankind,	to	be	legally	protected	and	regulated/managed.	This	feature	has	in	it	2	very	
attractive	–	for	me	–	concepts:		

1)	the	fact	that	it	proposes	a	new	governance	systems	that	goes	beyond	national	
sovereignities	and	divisions	

2)	a	way	to	speak	about	global	common	as	a	positive	(rather	than	negative)	sum	game.

Q3.	What	do	you	think	is/	will	be	your	valuable	input	to	the	establishment	of	CHH?		

	

Q4.	Do	you	see	your	role/	contribution	evolve	in	CHH	from	what	it	is	now	to	what	it	would	be	once	
CHH	is	an	independent	legal	entity?	If	yes,	could	you	explain	this	in	one	sentence?	

	

Q5.	What,	according	to	you,	would	define	the	strength	of	CHH	as	an	organisation?	

	

In	this	initial	phase,	I	aim	to	act	as	the	international	coordinator	of	the	initiative,	thus	
spreading	the	news	about	CHH	and	create	a	network	of	supportive	organizations.	I	also	
plan	to	support	the	initative	as	scientific	advisor	thus	working	on	related	written	
documentation		and	various	project	proposals/applications	

Yes,	In	a	second	phase	of	the	CHH	–	one	CHH	is	an	independent	entity	up	abd	running	–	I	
aim	to	contribute	to	the	work	around	the	development	of	the	ESAF	framework.	I	would	
like	to	work	to	make	the	scientific	case	for	an	Earth	System	Accounting	Framework	and	
after	collaborate	with	various	research	groups	around	the	world	for	its	development.	

	

To	be	credible	scientifically,	legally	and	from	a	diplomatic	viewpoint	to	be	able	to	lead	
the	way	towards	a	complete	re-organization	of	the	world	governance	system	(as	well	as	
to	lead	the	implementation	of	a	related	scientific	research	agenda).		



	

	 3	

Q6.	What,	according	to	you,	would	define	success	of	CHH	in	the	short	term	and	in	the	long-term?	

	

Short	term	success	(1-2	years	from	now):	CHH	is	established	as	an	independent	global	
organization,	has	core	funding	secured	to	operate	for	3-5	years	to	come	and	a	dedicated	
core	staff	of	3	full	time	equivalents.	A	coalition	of	states	is	starting	to	shape	up	(2-3	core	
governments	deeply	and	activelty	engaged)	by	end	of	2018/early	2019.				

Medium	term	success	(3-7	years):	the	global	commons	are	back	in	the	political	agenda	
(not	just	climate	issues)	and	at	the	core	of	civil	society	discussions.	A	coalition	of	states	
(at	least	10	states)	is	established,	which	are	signatory	of	the	CHH	Statutes	and	actively	
lobby	in	favour	of	the	CHH	message/goal.	Sessions	of	the	UN	general	assemly	are	held	to	
start	discussing	the	CHH	governance	framework	and	the	research	needs	to	make	the	
ESAF	real	(I	am	envisioning	a	process	similar	to	the	one	which	led	to	the	idenfitication	
and	agreement	of	the	SDGs	and	associated	indicators).	A	network/coalition	of	research	
institutions	is	created,	to	start	working	on	the	ESAF	proper	development	and	
implementation.			

Long	term	success	(7	to	14	years	from	now):	the	Earth	system	is	recognized	as	a	legal	
object	(i.e.,	CHM)	and	agreement	is	reached	at	UN	level	(or	equivalent	–	should	the	UN	
not	exist	anymore)	over	the	EASF	system.	The	CHH	“goals”	replace	the	SDGs	and	
represent	the	global	post-2030	agenda.

Q7.	What	do	you	see	as	the	single	biggest	challenge	faced	by	CHH	today?	

	

Q8.	What	are	the	three	main	areas	that	CHH	should	focus	on	to	establish	its	integrity	as	an	
independent	globally	reputable	organisation?	

	

Q9.	What	do	you	see	as	the	one	important	CHH	engagement	and/or	achievement	in		

	

	

	

	

Being	perhaps	too	visionary	to	be	acceptable	by	current	government	leaders.	Fundraising	
and	medium-term	financial	stability.		

1)	Scientific	integrity	and	robustness	in	support	of	a	core	legal	construct	

2)	transparency	and	involvment	of	as	many	stakeholder	groups	and	minorities	as	
possible	

3)	Easy	and	effective	communication		

	

2018	CHH	is	established	as	an	independent	global	organization	and	has	core	funding	
secured	to	operate	for	3-5	years	(with	a	dedicated	core	staff	of	3	full	time	equivalents)

Q10.	What,	according	to	you,	would	be	the	challenges	that	are	likely	to	face	CHH	in	the	short-	term	
and	long	term?	

	

	

2020	A	network/coalition	of	research	institutions	has	been	set-up,	to	start	working	on	
the	ESAF	development	and	implementation	

2019	by	early	2019	a	coalition	of	States	is	starting	to	shape	up	with	support	from	2-3	
core	governments	secured	(they	are	signatory	of	the	CHH	Statutes).	

Short	term:	financial	stability/viability	and	acceptance	by	governments	

Long	term:	acceptance	by	governments

NAME:												 Klaus	Bosselmann	

INSTITUTION:		 University	of	Auckland	

ROLE	IN	THE	CURRENT	ACTIVITIES	OF	CHH:		Co-Chair,	Scientific	Advisory	Board	

	

	

Q1.	What	is	the	one	main	reason	for	you/	your	institution	to	support	CHH?	

	

Q2.	What	is	the	most	attractive	feature	of	CHH?	

	

CHH	is	applied	Earth	jurisprudence,	promotes	a	simple	and	sound	idea	and	compliments	

similiar	initiatives	towards	ecological	approaches	to	law	and	governance		I	am	involved	with	

(Ecological	Law	and	Governance	Association,	Planetary	Integrity	Project,	UN	Dialogue	

Harmony	with	Nature,	eco-constitutionalism).	

The	idea	of	Earth	as	a	scientific,	physical,	ecological	and	ethical	whole	is	timely	and	

incraasingly	popular.		It	fits	the	Anthropcene	and	the	growing	concern	for	long-term	and	

truly	“global”	governance.	CHH’s	most	attractive	feature	is	its	interdisciplinary	approach,	

i.e.	from	Earth	scientists	to	environmental	lawyers	and	–	at	least	potentially	–	political	

institutions.	This	makes	CHH	credible.

Q3.	What	do	you	think	is/	will	be	your	valuable	input	to	the	establishment	of	CHH?		

	

Q4.	Do	you	see	your	role/	contribution	evolve	in	CHH	from	what	it	is	now	to	what	it	would	be	once	
CHH	is	an	independent	legal	entity?	If	yes,	could	you	explain	this	in	one	sentence?	

	

Q5.	What,	according	to	you,	would	define	the	strength	of	CHH	as	an	organisation?	

	

Q6.	What,	according	to	you,	would	define	success	of	CHH	in	the	short-term	and	in	the	long-term?	

	

My	expertise	in	approaching	law	and	governance	from	an	ecological	perspective	(rather	

than	the	other	way	round).	The	paradigm	shift	“from	environmental	law	to	ecological	

law”	(Oslo	Manifesto)	has	taken	hold	in	mainstream	environmental	law	and	will,	over	

time,	change	methodology	and	directions	of	decision-making	at	all	levels	(global,	

regional,	national	and	sub-national).	However,	we	are	talking	decades	here,	not	just	

years.	It	is	important	for		CHH	therefore	to	appeal	to	those	interested	in	contextual,	long-

term	decision-making	(global	governance	institutions,	think	tanks,	foundations,	civil	

society	networks,	progressive	governmental	agencies)	rather	than	current	power	centers	

(big	states,	corporate	and	finance	sector).		

I	see	my	role	as	an	advisor	(from	an	social	sciences	and	activists	perspective)	and	

facilitator	between	CHH	and	other	stakeholders	and	intitiatives	(see	above).		

Its	interdisciplinary	approach	and	expertise	as	mentioned.	CHH’s	real	(=political)	strength	

depends	on	finding	strategic	allies:	international	organisations	(e.g.	UNESCO,	EU	

agencies),	global	NGOs	and	individual	governments	or	governmental	agencies.	Finding	

strong	allies	will	be	crucial	for	CHH’s	success.	



	

	 3	

	

Q7.	What	do	you	see	as	the	single	biggest	challenge	faced	by	CHH	today?	

	

The	number	and	significance	of	strategic	allies.	In	the	short-term:	NGOs,	UNESCO,	
Portuguese	government.	In	the	long-term	several	progressive	states	(e.g.	Norway,	
Finland,	Netherlands,	Germany,		Malta,	New	Zealand)	and	UN.	

Funding	is	a	big	challenge.	One	or	two	sponsors	may	be	needed	to	run	a	small	
secretariat,	get	PR	going	and	organize	conferences.	Important	starting-point	is	a	more	
elaborate	website	(showing	partners,	events	and	ways	to	get	involved).	Any	difficulties	
associated	with	funding	are	to	due	to	the	short-term	economic	paradigm	that	most	
funding	isnstitutions	are	caught	up	with,	but	should	not	deter	us	from	trying.	Good	ideas	
take	time.	The	idea	of	Earth	as	a	legal	entity	certainly	takes	time	to	sink	in	and	to	
understand	its	practical	relevance.		This	makes	it	important	to	see	CHH	as	an	educational	
project	rather	than	a	quick	fix	response	to	the	predicament	of	global	environmental	
degradation.

1. Secure	funding	base.	
2. Attract	credible	partners	and	allies	(see	above).	
3. Run	successful	conferences	and	educational	initiatives	(incl	social	media!).	

2018				Conference:	academic,	but	involving	political	
institutions.	Establish	a	small	secretariat.

Q10.	What,	according	to	you,	would	be	the	challenges	that	are	likely	to	face	CHH	in	the	short-	term	
and	long	term?	

Short-term:		securing	a	solid	funding	base	

Long-term:		overcoming	economic	forces	(dominating	the	UN,	EU,	virtually	all	
governments)	that	will	undermine	the	credibility	of	CHH	once	it	becomes	more	
prominent.	Best	remedy:	find	some	credible	partners	(see	above).

INSTITUTION:	European	Spacial	Agency	–	Head	of	the	Coordination	Office	on	Sustainable	
Development	

ROLE	IN	THE	CURRENT	ACTIVITIES	OF	CHH:		Member	Steering	Committee	Board	

	

Q1.	What	is	the	one	main	reason	for	you/	your	institution	to	support	CHH?	

	

	

Q2.	What	is	the	most	attractive	feature	of	CHH?	

	

Being	part	of	the	CHH	comes	with	my	personal	commitment	towards	the	respect,	the	

preservation	and	the	restoration	of	our	space	ship,	planet	Earth.	I	have	always	been	in	favour	

of	an	ecological	humanism.	The	role	of	human	beings,	the	sole	species	that	can	decide	on	its	

extinction,	is	key.	I	strongly	believe	that	something	can	still	be	done	to	help	the	Earth	system	

to	be	revitalised.	It	is	a	matter	of	change		in	mindsets,	a	matter	of	accountability,	a	matter	of	

consciousness	be	it	individual	or	collective	level.	This	consciousness	was	borne	when	humans	

came	into	space.	This	is	also	the	reason	why,	being	part	of	the	European	Space	Agency,	I	can	

bring	space	role	and	tools	into	the	debate	to	support	the	CHH	and	its	actions	towards	the	

Environment.		This	can	also	constitute	a	strong	position	for	Europe	to	show	its	leadership		

and	launch	a	world-wide	cooperation.		

The	most	attractive	feature	of	CHH	is	the	new	vision	concerning	our	space	operating	

system	and	the	solutions	that	can	derive	from	it.	It	perfectly	illustrates	a	new	form	of	

international	cooperation	where,	through	a	network	of	committed		entities	and	

individuals,	the	principle	of	“from	global	to	local”	will	be	turned	into	concrete	policies	

and	actions	in	the	interest	of	the	whole	humankind.	Awareness	actions	for	supporting	

the	promotion	of	the	SOS	Treaty		should	be	deployed	in	all	layers	of	the	society.

Q3.	What	do	you	think	is/	will	be	your	valuable	input	to	the	establishment	of	CHH?		

	

Q4.	Do	you	see	your	role/	contribution	evolve	in	CHH	from	what	it	is	now	to	what	it	would	be	once	
CHH	is	an	independent	legal	entity?	If	yes,	could	you	explain	this	in	one	sentence?	

	

Q5.	What,	according	to	you,	would	define	the	strength	of	CHH	as	an	organisation?	

	

	

Q6.	What,	according	to	you,	would	define	success	of	CHH	in	the	short-term	and	in	the	long-term?	

My	contribution	to	the	establishment	of	the	CHH	is	my	engagement	towards	the	Earth	and	its	

Environment	and	the	way	I	express	it	through	multiple	actions	of	awareness	towards	institutions	

or	the	general	public	(citizens)		in	writing,	talking	or	exchanging	with	them.		I,	in	particular	wrote	

the	introduction	of	the	SOS	Treaty	book.	But	as	a	lawyer	and	sociologist	I	am	always	attentive	to	

the	evolutions	and	trends	in	our	societies	and	try	to	propose	innovative	solutions	for	a	better	

governance.	I	have	been	launching	the	Sustainable	Development	activity	at	ESA	and	was	

considered	as	a	pioneer	in	this	sector,	I	can	help	CHH	founders	and	members	to	be	pioneers		for	

a	new	governance		of	the	Earth	system.	Lastly,	as	a	staff	of	the	European	Space	Agency,	I	have	

many	networks	and	contacts	that	can	be	mobilised	and	used	t	defend	the	CHH		cause.	

Once	the	CHH	will	be	an	independent	legal	entity,	I	imagine	being	more	committed	in	

my	action	as	my	role	will	be	more	defined	and	the	organisation		more		structured.	

The	strength	of	CHH	is	its	diversity,	its	multi-disciplinarity	that	nevertheless	converge	

towards	a	single	objective:	protect	the	Earth	Safe	Operating	System.	An	objective	that	

should	always	federate	and	never	divide.

undertake	actions	at	inter-governmental,	governmental	and	local	levels	and	mobilising

NAME:	Paulo	Magalhães	

INSTITUTION:	Zero/	CHH	

ROLE	IN	THE	CURRENT	ACTIVITIES	OF	CHH:		Chair	of	the	Steering	Committee	Board	

	

	

Q1.	What	is	the	one	main	reason	for	you/	your	institution	to	support	CHH?	

	

Q2.	What	is	the	most	attractive	feature	of	CHH?	

The	most	attractive	feature	of	the	condominium	model	is	the	fact	that	it	makes	possible	the	symbiotic	
harmonization	of	individual	and	collective	interests,	which	was	theoretically	(for	the	economy	and	for	
law	also)	an	impossibility.	The	CHH,	by	making	a	scale	adaptation	of	this	model,	makes	possible	the	
coexistence	of	a	global	common	good	as	a	legally	recognized	common	heritage	(the	favorable	state	of	
the	Terrestrial	System)	in	an	overlapping	way	with	the	existence	of	sovereign	and	independent	states.	
As	a	consequence	of	this	recognition,	the	creation	of	a	fair	system	of	maintenance	and	management	
of	the	use	of	this	global	good	is	inevitable.	
What	seems	to	me	most	attractive,	apart	from	the	global	and	deep	interdisciplinary	approach,	is	this	
apparent	simplicity	of	the	model	and	its	explanatory	capacity	of	reality.	The	fact	that	CHH	it	is	a	legal	
construction	based	on	the	latest	knowledge	of	science	on	the	functioning	of	the	Earth	System,	we	can	
consider	it	a	rational	representation,	but	it	does	not	cease	to	be	equally	grounded	in	the	intuitive	
perception	of	the	existence	of	something	global	from	which	all	the	live	and	human	species	depends,	

The	conviction	that	an	evolutionary	moment	has	arrived,	and	there	is	an	inevitable	and	
structural	shift	in	the	way	how	human	societies	organize	themselves	in	the	context	of	a	
limited	planet	of	which	they	are	part	of.	This	shift	necessarily	requires	a	natural	evolution	
from	the	actual	state-centric	international	system	to	a	new	one	in	which	the	recognition	of	
the	existence	of	a	real	global	common,	which	escape	to	the	territorial	dimension	of	states,	
require	his	recognition	with	the	goal	to	be	managed	as	common	good	on	which	we	all	
depend.	
Because	it	is	not	a	technological	challenge,	discovery	or	conquest,	but	rather	an	intrinsic	
challenge	of	a	human	self-organization,	this	evolution	is	the	greatest	of	the	challenges	for	
which	mankind	has	passed	
CHH	presents	itself	as	a	model	of	the	basic	organization	of	a	condominium,	in	which	the	
existence	of	common	property	is	overlapped	with	private	property,	and	in	this	way,	the	
interdependence	between	common	interests	and	private	interests	is	organized.	I	believe	that	
the	application	of	this	model	on	a	global	scale	has	a	much	greater	ability	to	portray	and	
explain	the	superimposed	reality	between	a	global	and	interdependent	Earth	System,	and	a	
human	society	organized	through	independent	states.	Because	CHH	has	this	capacity,	
because	it's	grounded	in	science	and	the	already	constructed	law,	it	seems	to	me	to	be	a	
viable	and	realistic	utopia.

that	crosses	all	peoples,	cultures,	and	religions	in	all	geographies	of	the	planet.	We	can	consider	it	a	
modern	scientific	and	legal	representation	of	the	previously	inexplicable	"mother	nature".	The	truly	
Common	Heritage	of	Humanity.

Q4.	Do	you	see	your	role/	contribution	evolve	in	CHH	from	what	it	is	now	to	what	it	would	be	once	
CHH	is	an	independent	legal	entity?	If	yes,	could	you	explain	this	in	one	sentence?	

	

Q5.	What,	according	to	you,	would	define	the	strength	of	CHH	as	an	organisation?	

	

To	continue	this	path	of	theoretical	construction	and	construction	of	practical	tools	that	
allow	us	to	concretize	this	evolution,	always	maintaining	the	prudent	doubt	and	the	
humility	of	learning	with	everyone.	

No.	If	everyine	fill	that	my	conribution	still	being	necessary,	I	will	continue	building	the	
home	and	the	concept.	

The	possibility	of	the	Common	Humanity	becoming	not	only	a	focal	point	for	the	exchange	of	
knowledge	between	scientists	of	various	areas	of	knowledge	but	above	all	a	space	of	shelter,	
bond,	and	identity	of	a	global	citizenship,	which	requires	a	Locus	where	to	anchor	the	Its	
existence.	If	Common	House	translates	in	practical	terms	into	a	heritage	that	unites	us	all,	
this	new	entity	can	become	the	space	where	common	interests	are	discussed	and	
developed,	and	where	these	and	future	generations	have	an	identification	and	belonging.

Q7.	What	do	you	see	as	the	single	biggest	challenge	faced	by	CHH	today?	

To	be	able	to	assert	itself	not	only	as	one	among	so	many	proposals	for	a	solution,	but	to	be	
recognized	as	one	that	is	properly	grounded	in	science	and	law,	and	which	has	a	greater	margin	of	
progression	and	ability	to	explain	the	reality	in	which	we	live.	The	one	that	represents	the	claimed	
evolution	and	that	is	scientifically	realistic	and	humanly	viable.

Q2.	What	is	the	most	attractive	feature	of	CHH?	

	

Q3.	What	do	you	think	is/	will	be	your	valuable	input	to	the	establishment	of	CHH?		

CCH	conceptualises	the	problems	we	face	in	a	new	and	compelling	manner.	CCH	has	begun	
the	task	for	framing	ethical,	policy	and	legal	responses	in	a	manner	that	(while	very	
challenging)	has	great	merit	and	therefore	potential.	CCH	helps	us	to	communicate	more	
effectively	and	therefore	to	advocate	as	a	collective.		

The	collective	effort	that	we	are	engaged	in	and	the	fact	that	CCH	has	an	interdisciplinary	
perspective	on	global	ecological	governance.	In	addition,	CCH	is	currently	comprised	of	
people	from	a	range	of	diverse	cultures	–	ie	not	exclusively	Anglo/American.	This	helps	
for	the	exchange	of	ideas	and	perspectives.	

I	think	I	can	best	contribute	to	discussion	about	ethical/legal	concepts	and	their	potential	
develop	policy	and	law.	In	particular,	I	am	able	to	contribute	to	the	integration	of	new	
concepts	of	the	commons	and	commoning,	with	policy	and	law.	My	experience	in	
working	on	climate	change	issues	and	law	of	the	sea	issues	will	also	be	helpful.

Q6.	What,	according	to	you,	would	define	success	of	CHH	in	the	short-term	and	in	the	long-term?	

	

I	think	I	am	best	able	to	help	through	the	communication	of	role	and	work	of	CCH,	and	
through	advocacy.		

Its	ability,	together	with	other	effective	partners	with	long	standing	international	
credibility,	to	communicate	a	clear/inspiring	and	effective	concept	for	global	ecological	
governance.		

Evidence	of	growing	interest	and	support	for	the	ideas	of	CHH.	Partnership	with	
other	organisations	that	are	supportive.	A	regular	and	growing	profile	at	relevant	
international	fora.	Contributions	from	a	growing	array	of	disciplines.	An	evolving	
discourse	about	ecological	responsibilities	at	all	levels:	global,	international,	
regional,	national,	local.	This	would	include	signs	of	moving	beyond	traditional	
legal	and	policy	responses,	and	a	preparedness	to	try	out	novel	concepts,	as	
opportunities	emerge.

Maintaining	momentum	and	energy,	without	exhausting	key	people.	Keeping	faith	as	the	
tasks	of	CHH	require	a	long	term	perspective.	Developing	and	maintaining	political	
support	–	where	necessary	and	helpful.	Ensuring	that	the	mission	of	CHH	remains	
coherent	and	focused.	

I	don’t	feel	that	I	have	the	experience/expertise	to	helpfully	answer	this	question.

Q5.	What,	according	to	you,	would	define	the	strength	of	CHH	as	an	organisation?	

	

Portugal	is	the	first	“state”	to	join	this	mission.	We	hope	we	can	help	either	by	providing	
the	“state”	vision	and	by	joining	other	“states”	to	CHH.

Q7.	What	do	you	see	as	the	single	biggest	challenge	faced	by	CHH	today?	

	

The	position	of	United	States	regarding	climate	change.	This	will	make	global	community	focus	
on	solving	“the	climate	change	issue”	and	bring	less	avalilability	to	“move	forward”.	

Can	be,	in	other	hand,	a	strenght	in	the	future.	

	

In	the	short-term:	

-	the	application	to	the	“Global	Changes	Foundation”	

-	the	ability	to	communicate	the	concept	of	CHH	in	a	way	that	everyones	may	
understand	

	

In	the	long-term:

Q2.	What	is	the	most	attractive	feature	of	CHH?	

	

Q3.	What	do	you	think	is/	will	be	your	valuable	input	to	the	establishment	of	CHH?		

I	am	an	Earth	System	scientist,	so	am	very	interesting	in	a	systems	perspective	of	the	future	

of	the	Earth.	That	is,	what	trajectories	of	the	Earth	System	are	possible	in	the	next	few	

hundreds	or	thousands	of	years,	what	do	they	mean	for	the	future	of	humanity,	and	what	

roles	can	human	societies	play	in	steering	the	future	trajectories	of	the	Earth	System?	In	

short,	what	sort	of	“Common	Home	for	Humanity”	do	we	want,	and	how	do	we	manage	our	

relationship	to	the	rest	of	the	Earth	System	to	ensure	we	achieve	a	common	home	that	we	

want?	

For	the	first	time,	we	have	here	in	CHH	a	concept	and	approach	that	does	NOT	try	to	

downscale	the	Earth	System,	or	break	it	up	into	smaller	components.	It	recognises	the	

Earth	System	AS	A	SINGLE	WHOLE,	a	single	complex	system	that	provides	the	life	support	

system	for	humanity.	This	is	a	profoundly	different	concept	and	approach	to	others	that	

try	to	deal	with	global	environmental	issues	(e.g.,	the	UN	SDGs).

Q6.	What,	according	to	you,	would	define	success	of	CHH	in	the	short-term	and	in	the	long-term?	

	

In	the	short-term,	getting	legal	status	for	the	Earth	System.	This	would	a	huge	achievement,	
and	a	turning	point	in	humanity’s	relationship	with	its	home	planet.	In	the	long	term,	success	
of	the	CHH	would	be	measured	by	its	influence	on	approaches	to	manage	human	activities	to	
respect	and	be	stewards	of	the	Earth	System	and	all	of	its	life.		

	

To	provide	scientific	support	in	terms	of	our	improving	understanding	of	the	dynamics	of	
the	Earth	System,	potential	future	trajectories	of	the	system,	and	the	role	of	human	
activities	in	infuencing	these	trajectories.	Also,	I’m	involved	in	the	further	development	
of	the	planetary	boundaries	approach,	which	provides	a	guidance	system	for	managing	
our	relationship	with	the	Earth	System.	

No,	I	will	continue	to	provide	scientific	support	and	advice.	

The	CHH	could	become	a	focal	point	for	scholars	and	practitioners	from	all	walks	of	life	
who	understand	the	concept	of	the	Earth	System	as	a	single,	complex	system	and	who	
are	committed	to	managing	humanity’s	relationship	(i.e.,	that	is,	managing	us)	to	
maintain	a	stable	and	accommodating	state	of	the	system.

Dealing	with	the	dominant	neo-liberal	economic	paradigm	that	is	destructive	to	life	in	
general	and	is	now	threatening	the	stability	of	the	Earth	System	as	a	whole	(that	is,	our	
current	economic	system	has	already	pushed	the	Earth	System	out	of	the	Holocene	and	
into	the	Anthropocene).	

Be	always	based	on	a	sound	scientific	understanding	of	the	Earth	System.	

Focus	its	initial	activities	on	gaining	legal	recognition	for	the	Earth	System,	which	in	itself	
will	involve	a	tremendous	educational	effort.	

Become	a	global	hub,	in	Porto,	for	reputable	activities	around	the	world	that	have	
common	aims	with	CHH

Q9.	What	do	you	see	as	the	one	important	CHH	engagement	and/or	achievement	in		

	

	

Q10.	What,	according	to	you,	would	be	the	challenges	that	are	likely	to	face	CHH	in	the	short-	term	
and	long	term?	

2018	–	major	conference	in	Porto,	introducing	CHH	to	the	
world		

	

2019	–	submission	of	the	Earth	System	as	common,	
intangible	natural	heritage	to	the	World	Heritage	
Commission	of	UNESCO	(it	may	not	succeed	but	would	a	
tremendous	educational	endeavour).	

2020	–	have	a	spreading	base	of	support,	both	in	human	
resources	and	in	funding,	allowing	many	more	educational	
and	legal	activities	

	

There	is	one	very	big	potential	challenge	–	if	CHH	achieves	much	higher	status	and	
influence	in	international	thinking,	the	dominant	world	power	structures	and	economic	
players	will	come	after	it	and	try	to	discredit	it.	So	we	need	to	think	of	where	risks	and	
threats	lie	as	the	CHH	concept	develops.
