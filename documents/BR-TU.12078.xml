ABSTRACT 

Zeolites are microporous crystalline solids with a regular pore system, which have 

found numerous applications in industrial processes such as oil refining, organic 

synthesis, adsorption and separation. Very small pore size of zeolites (~1 nm) imposes 

diffusional limitations for many catalytic reactions.  The catalytic performance of metal 

zeolite bifunctional catalysts can be improved by creating hierarchical zeolites and by 

controlling localization of metal species within the zeolite crystals. Impregnation is an 

efficient method for the preparation of bi-functional cobalt-zeolite catalysts for the 

direct production of liquid fuels from syngas. In the catalysts prepared via 

impregnation, cobalt occupies the cation exchange positions in the zeolite micropores 

decreasing the number of acid sites available for hydrocarbon isomerization and 

cracking. Isolation of cobalt ions in cationic positions reduces catalyst reducibility, 

makes it difficult to achieve metallic state and decreases the amount available metal 

active sites for Fischer Tropsch synthesis. We found that the presence of Na
+
 instead of 

H
+
 ions in the exchange positions of the large pore Beta zeolite favored deposition of 

cobalt on the external surface of the zeolite, while the acid sites in the zeolite 

micropores were not much affected.  The large pore cobalt Beta zeolite catalyst with 

cobalt species localized on the external surface and high concentration of acid sites in 

the zeolite crystals has showed enhanced catalytic performance in Fischer-Tropsch 

synthesis combined with hydrocarbon isomerization 

Another approach of this thesis has addressed creating hierarchical zeolites with several 

levels of meso- and microporosity using sacrificial templates. Hierarchical zeolites 

synthesized using cobalt containing carbon nanotubes, as sacrificial hard templates 

exhibited higher catalytic activity, lower methane selectivity and higher selectivity to 

isomerized hydrocarbons in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The synthesis strategy based on 



ix 

 

metal carbon nanotubes as sacrificial templates has been extended to other metals such 

as nickel and magnesium. This new approach to the synthesis of metal-zeolite 

composite increases the mesoporosity and improves the catalytic performance in 

hydrogenation of aromatics and anisole acylation.

RESUMO 

As zeólitas são sólidos cristalinos microporosos com um sistema de poros regular que 

têm encontrado inúmeras aplicações em processos industriais, como refino de petróleo, 

síntese orgânica, adsorção e separação. O tamanho muito pequeno dos poros das 

zeólitas (~1 nm) impõe limitações difusionais para muitas reações catalíticas. O 

desempenho catalítico de catalisadores bifuncionais de zeólitas-metal pode ser 

melhorado através da criação de zeólitas hierárquicas e do controle da localização de 

espécies metálicas dentro dos cristais da zeólita. A impregnação é um método eficiente 

para a preparação de catalisadores bifuncionais (cobalto-zeólita) para a produção direta 

de combustíveis líquidos a partir do gás de síntese. Nos catalisadores preparados via 

impregnação, o cobalto ocupa as posições de troca catiônica nos microporos das 

zeólitas, diminuindo o número de sítios ácidos disponíveis para a isomerização e 

fracionamento de hidrocarbonetos. O isolamento de íons cobalto em posições catiônicas 

reduz a redutibilidade do catalisador, dificultando a obtenção do estado metálico e 

diminuindo a quantidade de sítios metálicos ativos disponíveis para a síntese de Fischer 

Tropsch. A presença de íons Na
+
 em vez de H

+
 nas posições de troca da zeólita Beta, 

que apresenta poros grandes, favorece a deposição de cobalto na superfície externa 

dessa zeólita, não afetando os sítios ácidos nos microporos. O catalisador a base de 

cobalto suportado em zeólita hierárquica que apresenta espécies de cobalto localizados 

na superfície externa e possui alta concentração de sítios ácidos nos cristais de zeólita 

mostrou o melhor desempenho catalítico na síntese de Fischer-Tropsch combinada com 

a isomerização de hidrocarbonetos. 

Essa tese também abordou a criação de zeólitas hierárquicas com vários níveis de meso- 

e microporosidade usando agentes estruturais. Foram sintetizadas zeólitas hierárquicas 

utilizando nanotubos de carbono contendo cobalto, uma vez que o uso de templates 



xi 

 

rígidos resultou em maior atividade catalítica, menor seletividade a metano e maior 

seletividade a hidrocarbonetos isomerizados na síntese de Fischer-Tropsch. A síntese 

baseada em nanotubos de carbono impregnando metais como template de sacrifício na 

síntese zeolítica foi estendida a outros metais, como níquel e magnésio. Esta nova 

abordagem para a síntese do compósito metal-zeólita aumenta a mesoporosidade e 

melhora o desempenho catalítico na hidrogenação de aromáticos e acilação de anisol.

RESUMÉ 

Les zéolithes sont des solides cristallins microporeux avec un système de pores 

réguliers, qui ont trouvé de nombreuses applications dans les procédés industriels tels 

que le raffinage du pétrole, la synthèse organique, l'adsorption et la séparation. Une très 

petite taille des pores des zéolithes (~1 nm) impose des limitations diffusionelles pour 

des nombreuses réactions catalytiques. La performance catalytique des catalyseurs 

bifonctionnels à base de zéolites peut être améliorée en créant des zéolithes 

hiérarchisées et en contrôlant la localisation des espèces métalliques. L'imprégnation est 

une méthode efficace pour la préparation de catalyseurs bifonctionnels à base de cobalt-

zéolite pour la production directe de carburants liquides à partir de gaz de synthèse. 

Dans les catalyseurs préparés par imprégnation, le cobalt occupe les sites cationiques 

dans les micropores de zéolite, ce qui diminue le nombre de sites acides disponibles 

pour l'isomérisation et le craquage des hydrocarbures. L'isolement des ions cobalt en 

sites cationiques réduit la réductibilité du catalyseur, rend difficile d’obtenir l’état 

métallique et diminue la quantité de sites actifs métalliques disponibles pour la synthèse 

Fischer Tropsch. Nous avons démontré que la présence des ions Na
+
 au lieu des ions H

+
 

dans les sites cationiques de zéolite favorise le dépôt de cobalt à la surface externe, alors 

que les sites acides dans les micropores de la zéolite sont peu affectés.  

Une autre approche de cette thèse porte sur la synthèse de zéolithes hiérarchisées à 

plusieurs niveaux de méso- et microporosité en utilisant des agents structurants 

sacrificiels. Les zéolithes hiérarchisées synthétisées à l'aide de nanotubes de carbone 

contenant du cobalt présentaient une activité catalytique plus élevée, une sélectivité en 

méthane plus faible et une sélectivité plus importante en hydrocarbures isomérisés dans 

la synthèse Fischer-Tropsch. La stratégie de synthèse fondée sur les nanotubes de 

carbone comme agents structurants a été étendue à d'autres métaux comme le nickel et 



xiii 

 

le magnésium. Cette nouvelle approche à la synthèse de composites métal-zéolite en 

utilisant des nanotubes de métal-carbone comme agents structurants sacrificiels 

augmente la mésoporosité et améliore la performance pour l’hydrogénation 

d’aromatiques et l’acylation d’anisole.

Chapter 1: Introduction 

Heterogeneous catalysis plays an important role in the chemical industry. The 

major challenge in the heterogeneous catalysis is catalyst design with good activity, 

high selectivity and satisfactory stability. For this reason many researchers are looking 

for new approaches to the catalyst design 
[1]

. Use of bifunctional catalysts can 

advantageous for multistage catalytic reactions, because these materials contain both 

metallic sites over  metal nanoparticles and acid sites from support (e.g. metals combine 

with zeolite) 
[2]

. Design of efficient bifunctional catalysts remains however, a major 

challenge. 

Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with uniform micropores with pores size 

smaller than 2 nm. These minerals have been widely used for adsorption, membrane 

separation and in the field of catalysis. The zeolite main properties are ordered 

microporosity and presence of Brönsted and Lewis acid sites. The crystalline framework 

gives zeolites mechanical and high thermal stability, high specific surface area and high 

ion-exchange capacity 
[3–6]

. 

The zeolite properties, mainly their strong acid sites and their thermal stability, 

make them promising materials for catalysis 
[7]

. Zeolite can be used as acid or as  

bifunctional catalysts when a metal has been added to the structure 
[8]

. Conventional 

ways to introduce metals into the zeolites are through impregnation or ion exchange. 

However, this can lead to the neutralization of some acid sites in the zeolites 
[9]

. The 

metal ions introduced by impregnation or ion exchange will probably occupy a cation 

exchange position, decreasing the acid sites available in the zeolite 
[10]

. The number of 

acid sites is extremely important for many catalytic reactions occurring on zeolites. For 

example, the transformation of syngas into branched hydrocarbons is easier when more 

acid sites are available in the bifunctional catalysts. The presence of acid sites favors 



15 

 

hydrocarbon cracking and isomerization. Another issue concerning the location of the 

metal in the support is the difficult reduction of the metal for metallic state, which leads 

to a lower amount of metal active phase. The metal distribution on the outer surface and 

in the micropores of the zeolite is an important parameter, which could affect the 

catalytic performance of metal zeolite composite catalysts 

In addition, conventional zeolites exhibit diffusion limitations in particular, for 

bulky molecules as a result of their small micropores. One of solutions to reduce 

diffusion limitations over zeolite catalysts is synthesis of mesoporous or hierarchical 

zeolites. There are two major ways to create mesoporosity in zeolites, known as top-

down and bottom-up methodologies. The classical top-down methods consist of 

physical and chemical treatments, such as desilication and dealumination 
[11,12]

. This 

approach may cause a broad distribution of mesopores and an instability in the zeolite 

structure because a part of the zeolite will be destructed by removing silicon or 

aluminum. In the bottom-up strategies soft and/or hard templates are used. This 

procedure is performed by introducing solid material, normally a rigid structure, into the 

zeolite gel. Therefore, the zeolite crystallization occurs around the template during the 

hydrothermal treatment and, when the template is removed by combustion or 

dissolution, the mesoporous are created 
[4]

. 

 

1.1 Challenges in the design of bifunctional catalysts and goals of the thesis 

In this literature review, two major challenges have been identified in the design 

metal-zeolite bifunctional catalysts. The first challenge is relevant to the small pore 

sizes of the zeolites, which results in major diffusional limitations. One of the possible 

solutions could be design of hierarchical zeolites with enhanced mesoporosity. The 

second challenge in bifunctional catalysts is relevant to the localization of the metal and 



16 

 

acid sites with the zeolites. It is often considered that the proximity between metallic 

and acid sites is particularly important to obtain enhanced catalytic performance in the 

catalytic reactions requiring bifunctional catalysts. At the same time, localization of 

metal species in the zeolite micropores can be harmful for catalytic performance. It can 

lead to decrease in the zeolite acidity due to the neutralization of acid sites by metal 

cations. Small metal oxide particle size can also result in poor metal reducibility.  

The present PhD thesis focuses on the design of new synthesis strategies for the 

preparation of hierarchical nanocomposites of metal and zeolite and their application in 

catalysis. We suppose that the control of localization of metal nanoparticles within the 

zeolite micro and mesopores can influence on the selectivity of catalytic reactions and 

in particular Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. 

The first goal of this thesis is to optimize the impregnation sequence while 

introducing cobalt ions on the metal localization in zeolite and catalytic performance in 

FT synthesis. Cobalt is introduced by impregnation either to the sodium or proton forms 

of large pore BEA zeolite. Higher reaction rates are observed over the catalysts, which 

did not contain cobalt ions in the cation sites of the zeolite. Lower methane selectivity 

and higher selectivity to isomerized hydrocarbons are observed when cobalt species are 

located on the zeolite outer surface and acid sites inside the zeolite micropores. The 

BEA zeolite has relatively large pores. The situation could be different for ZSM-5 with 

narrow zeolite pores (d= 5.5 Å) and the diffusion limitation in ZSM-5 zeolites can 

become much more severe. The preferential localization of cobalt species on the outer 

surface of ZSM-5 might not be therefore optimal for the enhanced catalytic 

performance. 

The second goal of the thesis is to create hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite using 

carbon nanotubes (CNT) with different diameters as sacrificial template. Our target is to 



17 

 

obtain in a one-pot synthesis composite hierarchical zeolites with cobalt metal particles 

uniformly distributed in the zeolite mesoporous structure. The cobalt zeolite catalysts 

prepared using cobalt carbo nanotubes as secondary templates showed enhanced 

selectivity to iso-paraffins. 

Finally, the third goal of the thesis is to extend the methodology, which involves 

using cobalt CNT as secondary templates to other metals such as nickel (Ni) and 

magnesium (Mg) introduced into the ZSM-5 zeolites. We uncovered three roles of Me-

CNT in the zeolite synthesis. First, they strongly affect the shape of the synthesized 

zeolites, which seem to be replicas of CNT and show distinct fibrous morphology. 

Second, the Me-CNT act as mesoporogen and strongly enhance the zeolite mesoporous 

volume. Finally, zeolite synthesis in the presence of Me-CNT offers the opportunity to 

simultaneously introduce new catalytic functions leading to bifunctional metal-zeolite 

catalysts. The catalysts designed using this methodology were evaluated on model 

reactions such as aromatics hydrogenation by Ni catalyst and anisole acylation for all 

catalysts (Ni, Co and Mg).

Chapter 2:  Literature Review 

This chapter presents a literature review of the main topics discussed throughout 

that thesis such as zeolites, hierarchical zeolites, Lewis and Brönsted acidity, 

bifunctional catalysts, model reactions on acid and metallic sites, Fischer Tropsch 

synthesis. After analysis of the literature, Chapter 2 summarizes challenges for the 

design of new zeolite based catalysts. The goals of this thesis are also defined in this 

chapter. 

 

2.1 Zeolites: structure, porosity, acidity and catalysis 

Zeolites are microporous aluminosilicates with crystalline structure formed by 

AlO4 and SiO4 tetrahedra linked via their edges. The zeolites are important as industrial 

catalysts in petroleum refining (e.g. catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, isomerization, 

alkylation, fuels etc.) and chemical processes such as oxidation of olefins, fragrance 

synthesis 
[13]

. The main synthetic zeolites used in these processes are Mordenite 

Framework Inverted (MFI), Faujasite (FAU) and Beta (BEA). They have been 

commercialized as catalysts 
[14]

.  

Zeolite materials present specific features such as large surface area, high 

thermal stability, high ion-exchange capacity, presence of strong acid sites and shape-

selectivity 
[5]

. However, the structural micropores of zeolite become their disadvantage 

for the mass transfer of bulky molecules causing diffusion limitations for reagents, 

intermediates and products 
[15]

. In the last years, numerous works have been performed 



19 

 

in order to create zeolites with mesopores and to minimize the diffusional 

limitations 
[16]

. 

2.1.1 Structure  

The zeolites are structured in a crystalline form composed of tetrahedron of TO4 

(T is Si or Al in a natural zeolite and can be others elements such as Ga, Ge, Fe, B, P, Ti 

in a synthetic material) connected through oxygen atoms (Figure 2-1) 
[17]

. Zeolite 

structure contains channels and cavities, with the sizes of around 1 nm, which are 

accessible for many molecules 
[18]

. The combination of silicon and oxygen in tetrahedra 

leads to formation of an uncharged solid (SiO2). When the aluminum is incorporated in 

the silica structure, the structure is charged negatively. This fact occurs through the 

Al
3+

 ? Si
4+

 substitution and requires the compensating cations to keep the overall 

framework neutral 
[19]

.  

 
Figure 2-1 Zeolite structure adaptaded from 

[20]
. 

The compensating cations (normally Na
+
 or others alkaline or alkaline earth 

ions) are transmutable ions, attributing this material an ion-exchange capacity, where 

the metal ion could be changed by other cation (e.g. metal, ammonium and quaternary 

ammonium). The zeolite composition can be described by the following empirical 

formula: 

T 

O2 



20 

 

    
                         

where M is a compensating cation with the charge m, x and y are the number of Al and 

Si atoms in the unit cell and n is the number of water molecules. The silicon/aluminum 

(or simply Si/Al) ratio in the framework represents an important characteristics, since it 

determines the acidity and ion-exchange capacity.  

The structure of zeolites involves blocks of 3, 4, 5 and 6 membered rings (MR), 

each MR is linked with nT and O atoms, thus all oxygen atoms are connected with 2 T 

atoms. Thus, a 6 MR contains 12 atoms which can be T atoms or oxygen atoms. 

Zeolites can be classified into three categories according to their porosity: 

- Small pore (8 Membered ring): the pores are constituted of 8 atoms (T or O) and 

the diameter size is between 0.3 to 0.45 nm (e.g. LTA). 

- Medium pore (10 Membered ring): the pores are composed of 10 atoms (T or O) 

and the diameter size is between 0.45 to 0.60 nm (e.g. MFI). 

- Large pore (12 Membered ring): presents 12 atoms (T or O) and the pore 

diameter is between 0.60 to 0.80 nm (e.g. BEA). 

Depending on the pore class (small, medium or large), the zeolite can be used 

for adsorption and in many catalytic reactions. There are several types of zeolites that 

have a wide application on catalytic processes like faujasite (Y), beta (BEA) and MFI 

(ZSM-5), the use in these processes is linked with their properties such as high surface 

area, acidity and thermal stability 
[21,22]

. 

BEA has ring channels with twelve tetrahedra that intersect on three-dimensions 

and different opening size, the first with 5.5 Å x 5.5 Å and two others of 7.6 Å x 6.4 Å 

(Figure 2-2). The range of Si/Al ratio is 10-100, it can reach 150. The greater is the 



21 

 

Si/Al ratio of zeolite, higher is the thermal stability.  The Beta zeolite has relatively 

large micropores, high surface area (600 m²/g), shape selectivity, ion exchange capacity. 

The large micropores of BEA zeolite allow selective absorption of bulky molecules, 

such as aromatic hydrocarbons 
[23]

.  

 

Figure 2-2 Polymorph of BEA zeolite 
[24]

. 

ZSM-5 (MFI zeolite) has a structure formed by unit cells with ten rings of five T 

atoms, which are united by oxygen atoms to a similar chain, thus forming channels 

(Figure 2-3). These channels form a three-dimensional structure of ZSM-5 zeolite. 

ZSM-5 presents also a high ratio of silicon to aluminum (Si/Al&gt;11) 
[25]

. This ratio has 

strong influence on the capacity ion-exchange, that the greater is quantity of aluminum 

in the framework, greater will be the amount of charge-compensating cation 
[26]

.

2.1.2 Porosity and hierarchical zeolites 

Despite many interesting properties, zeolites display difficulties for mass 

transport of chemical compounds, which have the size of the molecules similar to the 

zeolite micropores. The small pores reduce the transport of reagents towards the active 

sites, consequently forming the undesired by-products and coke deposits. This may also 

results in blocking the zeolite micropores and a fast catalyst deactivation and their short 

life-time 
[5,28]

. It is necessary therefore to improve transport properties of the zeolite by 

creating mesopores (according to IUPAC the mesopore sizes vary from 2 to 50 nm) 

(Figure 2-4). 

 

Figure 2-4 Schematic diffusion of reagents and products through the pores ZSM-5 

zeolite (adapted from 
[29]

). 

 

In order to overcome these, numerous efforts have made to synthesize nano-

sized zeolite crystals, extra-large pore zeolites or mesoporous zeolites,  the latter are 

often referred to as hierarchical zeolites 
[30]

. The hierarchical zeolites contain, in 

addition to the well-defined micropore system, mesopores with the diameters in the 

range of 2-50 nm. Different to zeolite micropores, the size, shape and orientation of 

these mesopores are not directly related to the zeolite crystalline structure. Hierarchical 

porous zeolite materials begin to gain space in the research due to their reduced 

diffusion limitation on the reactions and improved accessibility of active sites. The 

zeolite mesopores can also delay catalyst deactivation 
[31]

. Several synthesis strategies 

have been proposed to obtain hierarchical zeolites, which are divided into “top-down” 

Reagent Zeolite Product

diffusion limitation



23 

 

and “bottom-up” (Figure 2-5). The first approach consists in creating a hierarchical 

zeolite starting from already synthetized zeolite. The main techniques used are 

dealumination using acid and desilication using alkaline solutions 
[17]

.  

Dealumination is based on removing Al atoms in the zeolite post-synthesis 

treatment. This method can be realized in two ways. The first way involves chemical 

agents like H4DTA, ammonium fluorosilicate ((NH4)2SiF6) in the liquid-phase and 

silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) in the gas-phase reactions, the dealumination occurs by Al 

leaching. Another way of zeolite dealumination is carried out at high temperature (873-

1073 K) via steaming process. This treatment leads to the hydrolysis of -Si-O-Al- 

bonds. The Al atoms are then detached from original zeolite structure. Beyond, these 

both methods can be used together 
[32]

.  

Desilication is a method well known for creating the secondary porosity in 

zeolites. It involves silicon extraction from zeolite framework using alkaline solutions 

(e.g. NaOH), basically preserving aluminum and the acidic properties 
[5,33–35]

. 

However, by using the “top-down” methodology it is difficult to control the 

creation of uniform mesopores. It might lead to the partial destruction of zeolite 

structure 
[36]

. The “bottom-up” approach is considered more challenging for the 

researchers because it depends on templates and conditions of zeolite synthesis, such as 

hard and soft templating 
[37]

. Both hard and soft templates have been utilized to 

synthetize hierarchical zeolites using the “bottom up” approach. The hard templates 

usually include carbon nanoparticles, nanotubes and polymer beads, while various 

cationic surfactants, organosilane, cationic polymer, and ionic liquids   are considered as 

soft secondary templates. Both hard and soft templates could be removed by 

calcination. There are numerous reports in the literature that address using templates for 

obtaining mesopores in zeolites. Zhang et al. 
[38]

[26]

 used 

organo-functionalized mesoporous silica (MS) as silica source to create the spherical 

self-assemblies of ZSM-5 nanocrystals. Huang et al. 
[39]

 synthesized a hierarchical Beta 

zeolite using a layered silicate precursor (H-kanemite) as silica source. Several 

methodologies, which involve soft and rigid/hard templating for creating hierarchical 

zeolites are described below. 

Double templating is carried out with different types of surfactants (e.g. CTMA, 

CTAB). Those molecules tend to create micelles in aqueous solutions. The surfactant is 

removed by calcination or washing, thereby, forming mesostructure in the solids 
[40, 41]

.  

Rigid or hard templating consists of using hollow or porous solids, which 

incorporate zeolites during their synthesis and create mesopores on their removal. The 

methodology may be described by the following general three steps: (a) a solution 

containing the reagents and zeolite precursors is added into the pores/cavities of the 

template, (b) zeolite crystals are growing within the hard template, (c) the template is 

removed by calcination (organic templates) or dissolution processes (inorganic 

templates). The most usable hard templates are carbonaceous (e.g. carbon nanotubes 

(CNT), carbon fibers) and polymer microspheres (e.g polystyrene) 
[17, 42-43]

.  



25 

 

 

Figure 2-5 Approaches for creating a hierarchical zeolite 
[44]

. 

Because of the presence of mesoporosity, the molecular diffusion is substantially 

improved over hierarchical zeolites. The mesoporosity is able to reduce the molecule 

residence time inside the pores avoiding secondary reactions, increasing lifetime and 

minimizing the catalyst deactivation. Zeolite with large pores can be applied in different 

reactions such as cracking, alkylation, isomerization, oxidation, condensation among 

others 
[45,46]

. Furthermore, another challenge beyond creating mesopores is design of 

bifunctional catalysts by encapsulation of metal nanoparticles in zeolite micro- and 

mesopores. It is believed that the metal confined in the crystals of zeolite can improve 

catalytic performance, activity and stability in Fischer Tropsch synthesis (FTS) and 

other reactions 
[47]

.  

 

2.1.3 Brönsted and Lewis acidities 

Acidity of the zeolites is related to their structure and chemical composition. The 

zeolite acid sites are mostly localized inside their pores. Therefore, zeolite can be used 

in a safer way than sulphuric acid for example, which is a highly corrosive liquid 
[48,49]

. 



26 

 

Catalytic activity of zeolite is often correlated with the number and types of Brönsted 

and Lewis acid sites present in this solid structure 
[32]

. 

The amount and strength of acid sites are affected by Al concentration and 

distribution in the zeolite framework. The zeolite acidity occurs through substitution of 

Si
4+

 atoms with Al
3+

 atoms, which produces a negatively charged structure. This charge 

needs to be compensated, a proton is linked to neighbour oxygen between one Si and 

one Al, forming a hydroxyl group (Si-O(H)-Al), which is responsible for Brönsted 

acidity 
[50]

. Aluminum concentration in the lattice is directly proportional to the 

concentration of acid sites in the zeolites 
[7]

. The formation of Brönsted sites from the 

sodium form of zeolite is presented in Figure 2-6. 

 

Figure 2-6 Formation of Brönsted acid sites in zeolites (adapted from 
[51]

). 

The Lewis acid sites in zeolites are formed during the calcination (&gt;500 ºC) 

owing the dehydroxylation of Brönsted acid sites (Figure 2-7) 
[49]

Lewis acid sites are electron-receptors and are linked to aluminum atoms with 

octahedral coordination located extra framework of the zeolite. They can be also formed 

by low coordinated T atoms inside the zeolite framework. Aluminum extra framework 

species may have different forms like Al
3+

, Al(OH)
2+

, AlO
+
 and exhibit a weak 

Brönsted acidity 
[52]

.  

The nature of acid sites may be characterized by NH3-stepwise temperature-

programed desorption (NH3-STPD), infrared spectrometry (IR) with molecular probes 

(NH3, pyridine, acetonitrile etc), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and 

microcalorimetry among others 
[53, 54]

. Infra-red spectroscopy is a technique most 

commonly used for measuring the acidity in porous solids. Generally, pyridine is used 

as a probe molecule. The pyridine interaction with of Brönsted or Lewis acid sites forms 

adsorbed species with characteristic vibrational frequencies that correlate with the type 

and concentration of acid sites. The quantification of the species may be done by the IR 

peak area integration 
[55- 56]

.

2.1.4 Bifunctional catalysis and catalysts 

The concept of multi-functional catalysis was developed in the 60s of last 

century by Weiss 
[57]

. Bifunctional catalysts are those that present two types of active 

sites. These kinds of catalysts usually have metallic sites, whose function is 

dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and acid sites, whose main function is to conduct acid 

catalyzed reactions (e.g. cracking, isomerization and others) 
[58]

. The components 

responsible for hydro-dehydrogenation may be of several types: (a) transition or noble 

metals with good dispersion such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd) and other, (b) metal 

sulphides and (c) metal oxide such as cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), copper (Cu) 

supported on zeolite. Bifunctional catalysts employed in industrial processes often 

contain Pt, which plays a role in hydrogenation-dehydrogenation. The presence of 

metallic sites in these catalysts is of fundamental importance. They can catalyze  

reactions such as hydrogenation-dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, aromatization and 

hydrocarbon cyclization 
[59-60]

. 

Metallic sites usually catalyze hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions, while 

acid sites catalyze the carbocation rearrangements. There is an association between the 

acid and metallic sites in bifunctional catalysts, which increases catalytic activity and 

product yield. Therefore, a balance and a synergy of the acid and metallic sites in 

bifunctional catalysts is extremely important. It often determines activity, stability and 

product selectivity 
[54, 61]

. The activity and selectivity of catalysts depend on the acid 

support. Generally the reaction rate of isomerization of n-paraffins is limited both by 

catalytic activity of acid support and activity of metal function 
[62,63, 64]

. 

Strength of acid sites and distribution of metal and acid sites are important 

parameters of bifunctional catalysts. In bifunctional catalysis, the kinetic steps of the 

consequent reactions are coupled to each other through the processes of diffusion of 



29 

 

these intermediates from one type of sites to another. The two types of active sites in 

bifunctional catalysts should be as closer as possible for attaining higher catalytic 

activity and selectivity 
[65]

. The metals can be introduced into zeolite by different 

methodologies, the most used is incipient wetness impregnation (IW or IWI), also 

called capillary impregnation or dry impregnation 
[66]

. 

Wet impregnation consists in adding to the catalytic support a solution 

containing metal precursor that filling the zeolite pores followed by drying, 

calcination/reduction steps. This technique is called “incipient wetness impregnation”, 

when the volume of solution is equal or smaller than the total pore volume of the 

support 
[10]

. 

 

2.2 Reactions occurring on metal-zeolite catalysts 

2.2.1 Model reactions on acid sites  

The model reactions are used as tools for characterizing the active basic, acid or 

acid-basic solid supports. Those reactions are summarized in Table 2.1 with some 

examples of zeolite catalysts.

. 

 

Isomerization is a reaction leading to the production of isomers (same molecular 

size, type and atoms number but with different molecular arrangement) 
[74]

. The 

hydrocarbon isomerization is conducted for obtaining branched isomers, because they 

are chemical compounds with a high commercial value. The octane number of the 

branched hydrocarbons is higher than that for linear compounds. 

Olefin isomerization is a fast reaction, while isomerization of paraffins is slower 

and requires very high temperatures. The paraffin isomerization reaction occurs on 

bifunctional catalyst with acid sites for isomerization by carbenium ions produced from 

olefins and metallic sites for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation from paraffins to olefins 

and vice versa. Assuming the classical mechanism, the paraffins dehydrogenate first on 

the metal sites and the protonated olefins are produced over the Brönsted acid sites. 

Carbenium ions rearrangement and ?-scission follows by hydrogenation and 

deprotonation on metal sites towards the paraffins 
[62,75]

. This mechanism can be 

descripting by following steps occurred over bifunctional catalysts 
[8]

: 

(a) Hydrogenation/dehydrogenation over metal sites; 

(b) Protonation/deprotonation on acid sites; 

(c) Proton addition to form alkyl-carbenium ion on acid sites; 

(d) Competitive absorption/desorption of carbenium ion and alkene over acid sites; 

(e) Rearrangement of alkyl-carbenium ion; 

(f) Cracking of alkyl-carbenium ion. 



31 

 

Acid supports of bifunctional catalysts can be amorphous oxides, mixtures of 

oxides (e.g Al2O3, Si2O-Al2O3), zeolite (Y, BEA, ZSM-5), silicoaluminophosphate 

(SAPO-11, SAPO-231), mesoporous materials (MCM-41, AIMCM-41) 
[38,76,77]

. 

Cracking is a reaction, which involves a rupture of the C-C bonds of 

hydrocarbons. It occurs upon acid active sites of solid surfaces after formation of 

carbocations 
[78]

. 

The catalytic cracking of paraffins, like heptane, generally starts with their 

protonation by proton H
+
 of the catalyst, after the formation of a five-ordered 

carbocation, followed protolytic cracking, thereby, forming the first carbenium ions and 

paraffins. The carbenium ions are normally transformed into alkenes, regenerating again 

the acid centers in which they were absorbed. The reaction proceeds through 

isomerization of carbocations. Many different species will suffer ?-scission, producing 

an olefin and a new carbocation 
[79]

. 

Oligomerization is a reaction that forms C-C bonds, yielding hydrocarbons 

which have a higher molecular weight. This reaction is favored at low temperature and 

high pressure. Oligomerization is an exothermic reaction; it causes a reduction in the 

number of molecules. This reaction is promoted by acid catalysts. The formed 

oligomers are cracked mainly at higher reaction temperatures, modifying the cracking 

products distribution 
[80,81]

. 

Friedel-Crafts alkylation and acylation are among the most important reactions 

occurring over zeolites. They synthesize mainly alkyl and ketone aromatics for fine 

chemistry, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, agrochemical industries 
[82]

.  

Alkylation of aromatics involves hydrogen substitution of an aromatic ring with 

alkyl group through interaction of an alkylating agent with the catalyst. The alkyl group 



32 

 

is simultaneously added to the aromatic ring forming a complex ? as an intermediate 

(Figure 2-8) 
[83]

. 

 

Figure 2-8 Friedel-Craft alkylation reaction 
[83]

. 

Acylation reaction implies in the electrophilic substitution of an aromatic 

substrate with acyl, generally an acyl is halide, to form aromatic ketones (Figure 2-9) 

[84]
.  

 

Figure 2-9 General acylation reaction adapted from 
[85]

. 

The catalysts used in both reactions are Lewis acid or Brönsted acid such as 

Al2O4, FeCl3, TiCl4, HCl, HF. However, these catalysts present some disadvantages on 

the environmental disposal like toxicity and corrosion. In view of this, it was necessary 

the development the new solid heterogeneous acid catalysts 
[71, 73, 86, 87]

.  

Wide ranges of acidity, Si/Al ratios and crystalline structure are advantages of 

zeolites over other kinds of superacids materials 
[88]

. Spagnol and co-workers were the 

first to propose application of the BEA zeolite for the acylation of anisole with acetic 

anhydride 
[89]

. Zeolites such as BEA, ZSM-5 and Y 
[85,90–92]

 have been also used for the 

acylation and alkylation reactions 
[93]

2.2.2 Model reactions on metal sites 

Hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions occur on the catalysts that have 

metallic functions (e.g. Pt, Pd, Rh). Metal sites can dehydrogenate saturated reactant 

molecules to alkenes and hydrogenate olefin intermediates desorbed from acid sites 
[78]

. 

Thermodynamically, hydrogenation is likely to occur at low temperatures and 

high pressures, it is highly exothermic and causes a reduction in the number of 

molecules. The hydrogen activation is conducted by metal catalyst and causes a rupture 

of the H-H bond. An example can be seen for hydrogenation reaction of the ethylene 

molecule (Figure 2-10) and toluene (Figure 2-11) 
[94,95]

 . 

 

Figure 2-10 Ethylene hydrogenation reaction 
[96]

. 

The interest to toluene hydrogenation has been increasing because of more strict 

requirements to the quality of diesel fuels as cetane number and the environmental 

legislative rules. Toluene has similar properties but lower toxicity than benzene, for 

these reasons it has been used in many applications replacing benzene. The Figure 2-11 

shows toluene hydrogenation forming methyl-cyclohexane product and the catalytic 

cracking forming cyclohexane and methane as by-products 
[97–100]

.

2.2.3 Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis 

Fischer Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) is a reaction that produces hydrocarbons from 

syngas (CO and H2). The syngas is obtained from coal, natural gas, and biomass and is 

aimed for producing chemicals and fuels (Figure 2-12). FTS produces cleaner fuels and 

allows non-use or minimization of the use of petroleum resources 
[101–103]

. The interest 

to FTS strongly depends on the crude oil prices, which vary cyclically over last decades. 

These days they are approaching 53 $ per barrel according to EIA, 2019.

Fischer Tropsch synthesis includes parallel and consecutive reactions, 

determined according to the operational conditions. Amongst them, the main are: 

Paraffin synthesis: (    )                        

Olefin synthesis:                        

Alcohol synthesis:                       (   )       

Water Gas Shift (WGS):                 

Boudouard reaction (coke):             

Oxidation of metal:                 

In these reactions,   is the carbon number in hydrocarbons and alcohols. Several 

parameters can affect the performance of Fischer Tropsch synthesis, such as 

temperatures, composition of the gas (H2/CO ratio) and type of catalysts.  

There are two types of FT processes: High Temperature Fischer-Tropsch 

(HTFT) and Low Temperature Fischer-Tropsch (LTFT).  The first process (HTFT) 

operates at high temperatures at the range from 320 to 350 ºC and uses iron as catalyst. 

It generates olefins, oxygenates and paraffins of gasoline range. In the LTFT process, 

the reactions are carried out at lower temperatures (220 to 250 ºC) using iron or cobalt 

catalysts. The process produces mainly long-chain linear paraffins. Indeed, the LTFT 

synthesis will produce preferably middle distillates, which are used for formulation of 

diesel fuels 
[61]

. 

The FT reaction mechanism consists of surface polymerization that yields a 

product distribution with different molecular weights, known as Anderson-Schulz-Flory 

(ASF) distribution 
[105]

. The mechanism involves the following steps shown (Figure 

2-13): 

(1)  Reagent adsorption; 



36 

 

(2)  Chain initiation; 

(3)  Chain growth; 

(4)  Chain termination; 

(5)  Products desorption; 

(6)  Readsorption and secondary reactions.

The distribution of hydrocarbon products is described by the ASF distribution 

via Equation 1. 

   
  

(     )
                                                                                                             (1) 

where    is the initiation chain,    is the termination chain and   is the chain-growth 

probability. The chain growth towards olefins and paraffins is usually between 0.77 and 

0.93 
[107]

. The termination probability will be (1-?). The relation between growth chain 

and molar fraction of a hydrocarbon is defined the Equation 2. 

    (   )   
                                                                                              (2) 

where    is a molar fraction of product with a carbon number  . The chain length 

distribution can be predicted by the Schulz-Flory law (Figure 2-14) 
[108]

. 



37 

 

 

Figure 2-14 Hydrocarbons selectivity as ? function 
[108]

. 

Several methods have been proposed for selectivity control in FT synthesis. 

First, catalytic cracking/isomerization of FT hydrocarbons can upgrade the reaction 

products to a specific fuel. Combination of FT synthesis process with hydrocracking 

and isomerization of long chain hydrocarbons restricts the hydrocarbon distribution to a 

more convenient range 
[109]

. The isomerization and cracking of FT hydrocarbons would 

lead to iso-paraffins or diesel fuels constituted by the C10-C20 hydrocarbons. This 

multistage process, however, significantly reduces the efficiency of synthetic fuel 

production.  

An alternative to that multi-stage process would be utilization of bifunctional 

catalysts containing an active FT component, e.g. cobalt (Co) or ruthenium (Ru), and an 

acid catalyst active for cracking and isomerization. The proximity between metal and 

acid sites is an important parameter of the bifunctional catalysts often governing 



38 

 

reaction rate and selectivities. Recently two additional methods for hydrocarbon 

selectivity control were proposed, which involve making use of nanoreactors 
[110]

 and 

microemulsions 
[111]

. In these methods, the carbon chain length is limited by steric and 

diffusion limitations 
[112]

. 

Fischer Tropsch mechanism is still under debates. Some mechanisms were 

proposed to literature which involve carbide, hydroxylcarbene and carbonyl insertion.  

1) Surface carbide is formed firstly by CO and H2 dissociation on metal particles 

supported, forming C1 intermediates (without oxygen atoms). After that, the carbide 

reacts with adsorbed hydrogen, generating intermediates such as CH, CH2 and/or CH3, 

due to hydrogenation of carbon atoms. The chain growth is promoted by the insertion of 

CHx species to CxHy, it is adsorbed into the metal particle. The chain termination is 

followed by: (i) dehydrogenation to olefins, (ii) hydrogenation of CxHy intermediates to 

paraffins or (iii) disproportional growth of CxHy intermediates to paraffins or olefins. 

Methylene (CH2 adsorbed) is often considered the key intermediate specie (Figure 

2-15). 

 

Figure 2-15 Carbene mechanism
 [113]

. 

2) Hydroxycarbene mechanism entailing partial hydrogenation of adsorbed CO to 

adsorbed hydroxycarbene (CHOH) species. Thereafter, it involves a condensation 

reaction of two –CHOH species, with the elimination of water at the same time, forming 

– RCHOH intermediates (Figure 2-15). 



39 

 

This mechanism explains the formation of paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons by OH 

bond elimination. 

3) Carbonyl insertion mechanism is essentially different of two mechanisms previously 

mentioned, because the CO molecule keeps unaltered. The growth of hydrocarbon chain 

occurs through CO insertion into the metal-alkyl bonds (Figure 2-16). 

 

Figure 2-16 Schematic representation of carbonyl insertion 
[113]

. 

Carbonyl insertion mechanism is based on the results obtained with 

organometallic complexes and was proposed for the first time by Pichler and Schulz 

(1970). When catalysts on the basis of ruthenium or iron are used,  this mechanism is 

often supposed to occur 
[114]

.  

 

2.2.4 Catalysts 

The right choice of catalysts for the Fischer Tropsch synthesis is one the most 

important factors in order to obtain high reaction yield. The catalysts must be active, 

selective and stable. If it is possible, they can be regenerated. Several metals can be used 

as catalysts in this reaction, the main are: cobalt (Co), iron (Fe), ruthenium (Ru) and 

nickel (Ni) 
[115]

.  

The iron catalysts normally are used because of their low cost. Besides that, 

these catalysts present a good performance using syngas rich in CO or CO2, because of 

their high activity in the water gas shift reaction. The main disadvantages of iron 

catalysts is lower activity and rapid deactivation by oxidation or sintering 
[116]

.

Ruthenium is the most active catalyst for Fischer Tropsch synthesis, but its high 

cost and limited reserves make it impossible industrial application. 
[117,118]

. 

Cobalt-based catalysts present high activity, stability, C5
+
 hydrocarbons 

selectivity and low activity in the WGS reaction. Cobalt catalysts are used in the low 

temperature process (LTFT- Low Temperature Fischer Tropsch synthesis) for synthesis 

of diesel fuels, whereas at high temperatures they produce a lot of methane (CH4). 

Besides that, these catalysts have high activity in hydrogenation and tend to form 

preferably linear alkanes, undesirable in the gasoline production, one of the main 

products of HTFT process 
[119, 120]

. In the state of the art catalysts, cobalt nanoparticles 

are dispersed on porous supports like Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2, zeolites and others 
[9,121,122]

. 

Higher activity, higher conversion per single pass, higher resistance to deactivation by 

water, lower activity in WGS and lower amount of oxygenate products are main 

advantages that cobalt presents in front of iron-based catalysts.

Chapter 3: Influence of impregnation and ion exchange sequence on metal 

localization, acidity and catalytic performance of cobalt zeolite catalysts in Fischer-

Tropsch synthesis 

 

Paper published in ChemCatChem, October 2018, IF 4.67, Qualis A1. 

 

Abstract: Cobalt distribution between the external surface and micropores and acidity 

of the large pore BEA zeolite were controlled by choosing the sequence of impregnation 

and ion exchange procedures. Higher concentration of ion exchangeable cobalt was 

observed in the catalyst prepared by ion-exchange of the zeolite proton form. The 

presence of Na
+
 instead of H

+
 ions in the exchange positions of zeolite favored 

deposition of cobalt on the external surface. The acid sites in the zeolite micropores can 

be then restored by subsequent ion exchange of sodium with ammonium nitrate and 

calcination. The catalytic performance of the cobalt zeolite catalysts prepared using 

different impregnation and ion exchange procedures was tested in the Fischer-Tropsch 

synthesis. Higher reaction rates were observed over the catalysts, which did not contain 

cobalt ions in the cation sites of the zeolite. Lower methane selectivity, higher 

selectivity to long chain hydrocarbons and high fraction of isomerized products are 

observed when cobalt species are located on the zeolite outer surface and acid sites 

inside the BEA zeolite micropores. 

 

3.1 Introduction 

The depletion of fossil resources and increasing environmental concerns have 

led to the development of new catalytic processes from alternative and renewable 

feedstocks. Natural gas and biomass can be transformed into syngas (CO+H2) by steam 



53 

 

reforming, partial oxidation or gasification. The syngas can be then converted into ultra-

clean fuels over cobalt-based catalysts via Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis 
[1-3]

 FT 

synthesis is a “nontrivial surface polymerization reaction” 
[4]

, with the reaction 

selectivity typically described by very broad Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution 
[1, 5]

. 

Consequently, the major challenge of FT reaction is adjustment of the reaction 

selectivity in order to produce specific hydrocarbon fractions. 

Several methods were proposed for selectivity control in FT synthesis. Some of 

them involve control of hydrocarbon selectivity by steric limitation and diffusion in 

nanoreactors and microemlusions 
[6-8]

. The combination of FT synthesis with 

hydrocracking and isomerization of long-carbon chain hydrocarbons restricts the 

hydrocarbon distribution to a more convenient narrow range 
[9, 10]

. Isomerization and 

cracking of FT hydrocarbons would lead to iso-paraffins or diesel fuels mostly 

constituted by the C10-C20 hydrocarbons. This reaction can be performed over hybrid or 

composite catalysts containing an active FT component, e.g. Co or Ru, and an acid 

catalyst active in cracking and isomerization. 

Because of their high acidity and stability, zeolites have been often proposed as 

most promising catalysts for hydrocarbon cracking and isomerization under FT 

synthesis conditions 
[3, 11]

. Impregnation is an effective method for the preparation of bi-

functional cobalt-zeolite catalysts for the direct production of fuels from syngas 
[12-18]

. 

Note however, that introduction of cobalt ions to the zeolite may result however, in the 

neutralization of the zeolite acid sites. This represents a major drawback of this method. 

Cobalt ions, introduced during impregnation, can occupy cation exchange positions in 

the zeolite micropores decreasing the number of acid sites available for hydrocarbon 

isomerization and cracking. In addition, the isolated Co ions in the cationic positions 

can be very difficult to reduce to metallic state, thus decreasing the amount of available 



54 

 

metal active phase for FT synthesis. Finally, it is known that the diffusion in zeolites is 

strongly affected by the presence of exchange cations inside the micropores 
[19-21]

. The 

metal particles in the narrow zeolite micropores are more susceptible to suffer from 

diffusion limitations due to the small pores of the zeolite in the presence of larger 

compensation cations. The diffusion limitations in the zeolite micropores in particular 

for carbon monoxide would lead to higher methane selectivity 
[22]

. In addition, use of 

larger compensation cations during impregnation can restrain diffusion of Co ions 

inside the zeolite pores during the ion exchange and thus affect cobalt distribution 

between the zeolite external surface and micropores of the zeolite. The diffusion of 

reagents, intermediates and reaction products is usually much faster in the H-from of the 

zeolites and more particularly in the BEA zeolite, which has larger pore diameters 

compared to mordenite and most commonly used ZSM-5 zeolite. It can be also 

expected that HBEA zeolite which has weaker Brönsted acidity 
[13]

 than H-ZSM-5 

might reduce overcracking and exhibit higher selectivity to isomerized hydrocarbons. 

This chapter focuses on the effect of the impregnation sequence while 

introducing cobalt ions on the metal localization in zeolite and catalytic performance in 

FT synthesis. Cobalt was introduced by impregnation either to the sodium or proton 

forms of BEA zeolite. The as-prepared cobalt zeolite catalysts were calcined after the 

impregnation and then submitted to NH4
+
 ion exchange. The Brönsted acidity was 

restored in the zeolite by decomposition of NH4
+
 ions at higher temperature. All 

samples, before and after regeneration of the acid sites, were characterized by a wide 

range of methods and tested in FT synthesis.

3.2 Experimental Section 

Catalyst synthesis 

A commercial NH4BEA zeolite (Zeolyst, CP-814E, Si/Al=12.5) was used for 

preparation of all catalysts. The H
+
 form of the BEA zeolite (HBEA) was obtained via 

calcination of the parent NH4BEA sample at 450 °C for 4 h. The Na
+
 form (NaBEA) 

was prepared by two successive ion exchanges of HBEA with a 2 M NaCl (Janssen 

Chimica, P.A) solution at 80 °C for 1 h (50 mL·gsample
-1

), followed by calcination at 

450 °C for 4 h. Cobalt and platinum were introduced to the HBEA and NaBEA zeolites 

through incipient wetness impregnation by using Co(NO3)2 (2.39 mol L
-1

 solution) 

(Sigma- Aldrich, 98%) and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Sigma-Aldrich) as precursors. The 

amounts of precursors were calculated to obtain 20 wt.% of cobalt and 0.1 wt.% 

platinum in the final samples. After the impregnation, the samples were calcined at 

450 °C for 4 h. The impregnated HBEA and NaBEA are denoted as Co/HBEA and 

Co/NaBEA, respectively. 

The calcined Co/HBEA and Co/NaBEA catalysts were submitted to two 

successive ion exchanges with 2 M NH4NO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) solution at 80 °C 

for 1 h (50 mL•gsample
-1

), followed by calcination at 450 °C for 4 h. The final samples 

after the ion exchange with NH4
+
 and calcination are denoted as CoH/HBEA and 

CoH/NaBEA. 

 

Catalyst characterization 

The calcined samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) by using a 

D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with an energy dispersive type detector and a 

monochromatic CuK? radiation source. The XRD patterns were measured using a step 



56 

 

of 0.02° with an acquisition time of 0.5 s. The average size of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) 

nanoparticles was determined by the Scherrer equation. 

The samples chemical composition was determined by ICP-OES analysis. The 

zeolite samples for the analysis were dissolved a mixture of aqua regia and hydrofluoric 

acid. Quantitative elemental analyses were performed by inductively coupled plasma-

optic emission spectroscopy 720-ES ICP-OES (Agilent) with axially viewing and 

simultaneous CCD detection. The quantitative determination of metal content in the 

catalysts was made based on the analysis of certificated standard solution. The ICP 

ExpertTM software (version 2.0.4) provides the weight percentage of components. 

The textural properties of the samples were determined by N2 physisorption 

using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 apparatus. Prior to the analysis, the samples were 

degassed under vacuum (10 µmHg) at 350 °C for 4 h. The total pore volume (TPV) was 

calculated from the amount of vapor adsorbed at a relative pressure P/P0 = 0.97. The 

catalyst microporous volume (Vmicro) were calculated using the deBoer t-plot method. 

The samples mesoporous volume was calculated as the difference between the total pore 

volume and microporous volume. 

The XPS spectra were taken using a Kratos Axis spectrometer, equipped with an 

aluminum monochromater for a 1486.6 eV source working at 120 W. All spectra were 

recorded under a vacuum of 10-8 Torr and recalibrated afterwards with the binding 

energy of the Al 2p at 74.6 eV. 

The catalyst Brönsted and Lewis acidities were measured using Infrared 

spectroscopy after pyridine adsorption on a Nicolet 8700 apparatus. The samples were 

pretreated under vacuum (10-3 torr) at 450 °C for 2 h. After the pre-treatment, pyridine 

(1.2 mbar) was adsorbed on the sample at room temperature. The samples were then 

heated under vacuum (10-3 torr) at 150 °C and a spectrum was taken at room 



57 

 

temperature. The intensity of the Py-L and Py-H+ peaks at ~ 1455 and 1545 cm
-1

 was 

measured as a function of temperature, and the resulting plots used to compare the 

zeolite acidity. 

Fischer-Tropsch synthesis 

The catalytic performance of the samples was tested in FT synthesis. The 

experiments were performed in a fixed-bed reactor. Prior to testing, the samples were 

reduced in-situ in pure H2 gas flow at 400 °C for 4 h with a temperature ramping rate of 

3 °C/min. After the reactor was cooled down to room temperature, the flow was 

switched to syngas (H2/CO = 2) and the pressure was adjusted to 20 bar. Nitrogen (5% 

of the CO flow) was used as internal standard. The flow was adjusted to obtain GHSV 

of 66 L/gCo.h-1). After achieving the desired pressure, the temperature was 

progressively increased to the reaction temperature, i.e. 250 °C, at the ramping rate of 

3 °C/min. The gaseous reaction products, i.e. up to C5, were analyzed online using gas 

chromatography. The liquid products were condensed under pressure and analyzed off-

line using a Shimatzu 2010-Plus-AF gas chromatograph. 

 

3.3 Results and Discussion 

Catalyst characterization 

The catalyst characterization data are shown in Table 3-1. The H-form of BEA 

zeolite impregnated with cobalt (Co/HBEA) contains 13.7 wt.% of cobalt and only trace 

amounts of sodium. The amount of cobalt added by impregnation to the sodium form of 

the zeolite was almost the same (14.3 wt.%). Note that the Co/NaBEA samples 

contained in addition to cobalt about 1 wt.% of sodium. Subsequent ion exchange of the 

Co/HBEA and Co/NaBEA samples with ammonia nitrate results in decrease in cobalt 

content in the catalysts. The decrease in cobalt content after the ion exchange with 



58 

 

NH4NO3 is more significant in the Co/HBEA catalyst. This suggests that Co/HBEA 

contains a higher fraction of cobalt ion in the zeolite cation positions. Only very slight 

decrease in cobalt content was observed in Co/NaBEA. Most of cobalt seems to be 

present in this catalyst as cobalt oxide clusters rather than isolated cobalt ions in the 

cation sites. The ion exchange with ammonia nitrate leads to a major decrease in the 

concentration of sodium in the Co/NaBEA zeolite.  

The Co3O4 oxide phase was identified in the catalysts using IR, Raman 

spectroscopies and XRD. The IR spectra of the cobalt zeolite catalysts are shown in 

Figure S1 (SI, Supporting Information). They exhibit the peaks at 670 and 555-

600 cm
?1

, which were assigned to the ? (Co–O) vibration modes in Co3O4 
[23]

. Note that 

these bands overlap with the bands at 622, 525 and 468 cm
-1

 related respectively to 

coupled Al-O and Si-O out-of-plane vibrations, Al-O-Si and Si-O-Si bending vibrations 

in zeolite 
[24, 25]

. The broad bands at 1350-1000 cm
-1

 are due to asymmetric Si–O(Si,Al) 

and Al–OH bending vibrations. Figure S2, SI shows the Raman spectra of the catalysts. 

They are also indicative of the presence of the Co3O4 phases. The intense band at 

667 cm
-1

 is attributed to the cobalt octahedral sites (CoO6) 
[23, 26, 27]

. The medium 

intensity bands at 465 and 505 cm
?1

 correspond to the Eg and F2g
(2)

 sites, respectively, 

while the weak band located at 606 cm
?1

 has the F2g
(1)

 symmetry.  

The cobalt oxide crystallite sizes in the calcined samples were estimated from 

broadening of the Co3O4 characteristic XRD peak at 36.8° (2?, Figure S3, SI). All the 

samples showed similar cobalt oxide crystallite size, i.e. between 23-26 nm, once gain 

indicating that the secondary ion exchanges performed with CoH/HBEA and 

CoH/NaBEA had no effect on the size of larger cobalt oxide particles which are most 

probably localized on the external surface of zeolite. Note that XRD might not be 

sensitive to the presence of much smaller cobalt oxide nanoparticles in the zeolite 



59 

 

micropores (&lt;1 nm). Indeed, sub-nanometric clusters of cobalt oxides located inside the 

micropores of BEA zeolites prepared by impregnation were detected by STEM analysis 

in our recent publication 
[22]

. 

The porous volume and surface areas of zeolites significantly decreased after the 

impregnation with cobalt compared to the parent samples. The reduction of the 

mesoporous and microporous volume observed after cobalt impregnation indicates that 

cobalt oxide nanoparticles are localized in both types of the pores. The microporous 

volume decreases by 12% and 18%, respectively, on Co/HBEA and Co/NaBEA. This 

phenomenon can be explained by the presence of Co3O4 inside the zeolite 

crystallites 
[28]

. Higher loss of microporous volume observed on Co/NaBEA can be 

directly linked to the presence of Na
+
 localized in the zeolite micropores. Slower 

diffusion of cobalt ions in the micropores of Na/BEA results in preferential localization 

of cobalt ions in the entrances of the zeolite pores. This could lead to easier blocking of 

the pores of NaBEA zeolite with cobalt species.

After regeneration of the catalyst acidity via ion exchange with NH4
+
 ions and 

calcination, CoH/NaBEA recovered most of the original microporosity, i.e. only 5% 

Vmicro loss. Similarly, after NH4
+
 ion exchange, Co/HBEA recovered a much smaller 

portion of micropore volume. The recovery of the zeolite micropore volume after ion 

exchange with NH4
+
 is linked to the removal of Na

+
 and Co

2+
 exchanged species from 

the zeolite framework. Consequently, more significant recovery of micropore volume 

was observed on CoH/NaBEA. This indicates a lower concentration of sub-nanometric 

cobalt oxide clusters inside of the zeolite micropores of NaBEA compared to the BEA 

zeolite H-form.  

Introduction of cobalt ions to the zeolite also leads to the decrease in the 

mesoporous volume formed by intracrystalline spaces between zeolite crystals. 

Interestingly, different to microporous volume, the subsequent ion exchange does not 

result in the reversible recovery of this volume. This indicates that, for all samples, the 

decrease in mesoporous volume is principally due to the formation of cobalt oxide 

nanoparticles, which are non-soluble in aqueous solutions. These cobalt oxide 

nanoparticles, which form during catalyst calcination are located either in the mesopores 

or on the external surface of zeolite. This decreases interaction between the zeolite 

crystallites and thus mesoporous volume 
[15, 21, 22].

 

The Co 2p XPS spectra (Figure 3-1) show that Co3O4 is the dominant cobalt 

phase in oxidized catalysts. For CoH/HBEA and CoH/NaBEA, the shapes and binding 

energies of the Co2p line ( 

Figure 3-1) at 780 eV and low-intense shake-up satellite structure with spin-

orbital splitting of 15.2 eV were very similar to those of bulk Co3O4 
[29]

. Higher 

intensities of the satellite peaks, a shift of the XPS lines towards the higher energy 



62 

 

region and an increase in spin-orbital splitting observed for the XPS spectra of 

Co/HBEA and Co/NABEA indicate the presence of Co
2+

 ions 
[30, 31]

. 

 

 

Figure 3-1 Co 2p XPS spectra of the calcined cobalt BEA zeolite catalysts. 

 

Indeed, the Co/HBEA and Co/NaBEA samples prepared by impregnation of 

HBEA and NaBEA zeolite contain Co
2+

 ions in the zeolite cationic sites in addition to 

the Co3O4 crystallites. These cations are then removed by ion exchange with ammonium 

nitrate. The XPS Co/Si ratio (Table 3-1) almost does not change after the secondary ion 

exchange, while the cobalt content may decrease more significantly in particular for the 

Co/HBEA catalyst. This suggests that only a very small amount of cobalt is removed by 

ion exchange from the zeolite outer surface. Indeed, cobalt is present in the subsurface 

layers of the zeolite crystals mostly as Co3O4, which is refractory to the ion exchange.

The catalyst acidity was also impacted by the catalyst preparation method (Table 

3-1). Due to the presence of cobalt oxide and cobalt ions in the exchange positions of 

the zeolite, the amount of Lewis acid sites was higher in the impregnated catalysts 

compared to the pristine zeolite 
[32]

. The zeolite Brönsted acidity also depends on the 

presence of the compensation ions inside the zeolite micropores. As expected, in 

Co/NaBEA, the concentration of Br?nsted acid sites was much lower than on other 

samples, due to the neutralization of the protonic sites by sodium. After NH4
+
 exchange 

and calcination, the concentration of Brönsted acid sites significantly increases due to 

the removal of cobalt ions from the cation exchange positions in Co/HBEA and to the 

removal of both cobalt and sodium ions from CoH/NaBEA. Still, the Br?nsted acidity in 

CoH/NaBEA remains slightly lower than in CoH/HBEA. Note that the NH4
+
 ion 

exchange also results in the increase in the micropore volume because of the removal of 

bulky cations from the micropores (Table 3-1).  

 

Figure 3-2 TPR catalyst reduction profiles. 

 

The TPR profiles (Figure 3-2) clearly show that the reducibility of cobalt 

nanoparticles is strongly affected by the presence of sodium ions in the zeolites during 

impregnation. Typically, the reduction of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) to metallic cobalt under 

hydrogen atmosphere occurs in two consecutive steps: Co3O4 ? CoO ? Co 
[33]

.

The two- step reduction is translated into two distinct peaks in the TPR profile. 

According to the stoichiometry, the area of the first peak should be 3 times smaller than 

that of the second. Figure 3-2 suggests that the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO is easier 

when the cobalt was impregnated over the proton form zeolite as the first reduction peak 

in Co/BEA and Co/HBEA is observed at 190 °C instead of 290-310 °C. This effect 

might be explained by hydrogen spillover in the presence of acid sites close to metal 

oxide. In comparison, when the cobalt impregnation is performed over the sodium form 

of BEA zeolite, the cobalt reduction only starts at 310 °C. The first reduction peak 

slightly shifts to 290 °C after the zeolite exchange to acid form which might be 

explained partial hydrogen transfer through zeolite acidity. Interestingly, this 

phenomenon is not observed for the second reduction peak (CoO to Co) with the 

hydrogen consumption peak appearing at the same temperature for all catalysts, i.e. 

around 420-430 °C. Previous reports 
[34, 35]

 suggest negative effect of alkali ions on 

cobalt reducibility. Note that no such effect was observed over Co/NaZSM-5 zeolite 

(Figure 3-2) which is probably due to separate localization of cobalt and sodium 

species. Cobalt is preferentially localized on the zeolite outer surface, while sodium ions 

are located in the cation positions inside the zeolite crystallites.  

Localization of cobalt species in CoH/HBEA and CoH/NaBEA zeolites after 

removal of cobalt ions form the zeolite cation sites is illustrated in Figure 3-3.To 

summarize, the CoH/HBEA and Co/HBEA catalysts prepared by impregnation using 

HBEA contain cobalt as cobalt ions and cobalt oxide nanoparticles both in the pore and 

on the outer surface of the zeolite, while the Co/NaBEA and CoH/Na/BEA mostly 

cobalt oxide particles located on the surface of the zeolite crystallites.

zeolite (b). 

 

Catalytic performance in FT synthesis 

All the catalysts showed significant reaction rate in FT synthesis. No changes in 

the catalyst activity were observed during 100 h of the reaction. Nonetheless, the 

catalyst activity and selectivity were significantly affected by the catalyst preparation 

method (Table 3-2).  

After the NH4
+
 ion exchange and calcination, the activity of the CoH/HBEA 

catalysts increased by 132% compared to Co/HBEA and by 23% when comparing 

CoH/NaBEA to Co/NaBEA.  Higher activity observed on the catalysts after ion 

exchange could be explained by the removal of cobalt and sodium ions from the zeolite 

micropores, higher concentration of zeolite Br?nsted acid sites and easier diffusion of 

reaction intermediates to the acid sites inside the zeolite crystallites. The effect of NH4
+
 

ion exchange and calcination on the catalytic performance is more pronounced for 

Co/HBEA where higher amounts of cobalt ions and cobalt active phase are located 

inside of the micropores. Ion exchange results in the removal of cobalt ions from the 

cation sites and reappearance of Brönsted acid sires. This result also indicates that the 

FT reaction rates are enhanced when cobalt nanoparticles and Br?nsted acid sites are 

located in the proximity

Once again, the catalytic data confirm distinct localization of cobalt and sodium 

species in Co/NaBEA samples. Alkali metal ions were reported 
[34, 35]

 to be poisons for 

conventional supported cobalt FT catalysts. Preferential localization of cobalt on the 

outer surface of NaBEA zeolite and sodium ions inside the zeolite pores leads to very 

weak interaction between cobalt and sodium in Co/NaBEA, very small cobalt poisoning 

and thus, a high catalytic activity of this sample. Similar phenomenon was observed 

early Y-zeolites 
[36]

. In the Y-zeolite, sodium had very small influence of the intrinsic 

activity of cobalt species because of sodium preferential localization in small cages on 

Y-zeolite, while cobalt was mainly present in the mesopores. 

The product selectivities over different cobalt-zeolite catalysts are shown in 

Table 3-2 and Figure 3-4. Significant differences were observed as functions of catalyst 

preparation procedures. The selectivity towards methane was higher, when cobalt was 

impregnated on HBEA when compared to NaBEA, i.e. 22.2% compared to 17.5%. 

HBEA zeolite contained cobalt nanoclusters localized in the zeolite pores where their 

sizes are limited by the the pore diameters. Previously it was shown 
[37]

 that cobalt 

particle size smaller than 6 nm might lead to higher methane selectivity. In addition, 

localization of cobalt nanoparticles into the zeolite micropores in Co/HBEA introduces 

diffusion limitations for carbon monoxide, which results in higher H2/CO ratio in the 

micropores and thus, leads to higher methane selectivity 
[38]

. Higher methane selectivity 

was recently observed 
[22]

 over Co/zeolite catalysts containing cobalt nanoparticles only 

inside the zeolite crystals. The catalysts were prepared by selective extraction of cobalt 

from the zeolite outer surface using heteropolyacids. The Co/NaBEA contains mostly 

cobalt species on the zeolite external surface and was therefore less selective to 

methane.  



67 

 

After the NH4
+
 ion exchange, methane selectivity increases to 29% on 

Co/HBEA, whereas on CoH/NaBEA a slight decrease to 16.1% is observed. Similar 

trends were observed for the C2-C4 hydrocarbon selectivity. Co/HBEA was less 

selective to the C5
+
 hydrocarbons followed by CoH/HBEA, Co/NaBEA and 

CoH/NaBEA, respectively with 48.7, 63.9, 66 and 71.9%. The C2-C4 olefins to paraffins 

ratio (Table 3-2) show slight differences between the samples

The wax composition for each catalyst is presented in Figure 3-5. The presence 

of n-paraffin and isomerized products was observed for all samples. No significant 

differences in the total isomer fraction among the catalysts were observed, with the 

exception of Co/NaBEA where a smaller amount of Br?nsted acid sites (Table 3-1) led 

to lower selectivity to branched hydrocarbons. The catalyst preparation method also 

affects the hydrocarbon chain length in the wax products. On Co/NaBEA, hydrocarbons 

up to 25 carbons were observed, whereas for CoH/HBEA the carbon chain growth was 

limited to 20 carbons. The chain probability growth factor (?) determined by applying 

the ASF distribution model (Table 3-2, Figure 3-5) showed that the samples capacity to 

produce long carbon chain products decreases in the following order: 

Co/NaBEA&gt;Co/HBEA&gt;CoH/NaBEA&gt;CoH/HBEA. The distribution of liquid products 



68 

 

seems to be affected by both localization of metal phase and concentrations of Br?nsted 

acid sites.

Co/NaBEA has lower concentration of Brönsted acid sites, which are neutralized 

by Na
+
, and the metal was mostly located on the external surface of the zeolite. 

Consequently, the hydrocarbons formed on the metal sites on the zeolite outer surface 

were less likely to undergo isomerization and cracking. Higher selectivity to long chain 

hydrocarbons was observed.

On CoH/NaBEA, the metal location is similar to Co/NaBEA. Most of cobalt is 

localized on the zeolite external surface. The zeolite Brönsted acidity was obtained after 

exchange of Na
+
 with NH4

+
 ions and subsequent calcination. Consequently, the 

CoH/NaBEA sample showed improved isomerization and cracking rates compared to 

Co/NaBEA. On Co/HBEA, the metal species are located both on the external surface of 

zeolite and inside the micropores. Some of Brönsted acid sites in Co/HBEA are 

neutralized by cobalt cations. The smaller size of the metal sub-nanometric cobalt 

clusters located in the confined space of the zeolite micropores and, the proximity to the 

acid sites contribute to shorter carbon chain length of the formed products 
[6, 37, 41, 42]

. On 

the one hand, localization of cobalt metal particles inside the zeolite micropores could 

lead to the diffusion limitations in particular for carbon monoxide and would increase 

locally the H2/CO ratio. Higher H2/CO ratio would favor higher selectivity to methane 

and light hydrocarbons. On the other hand, the short diffusion pathway of the paraffins 

produced over cobalt clusters located inside the zeolite framework to the acid sites 

improves isomerization and cracking reactions and leads to the formation of smaller 

carbon chain products. It is important to mention that the higher methane selectivity 

observed on Co/HBEA and CoH/HBEA is directly linked to the FT synthesis, since 

methane formation through ?-scission does not usually occur 
[43]

 and the protolytic 

cracking mechanism is unlikely to occur under the reaction conditions 
[44]

. 

The preferential deposition of cobalt on the BEA zeolite external surface was 

proven to be an effective way to achieve simultaneously high FT reaction rate and lower 

methane selectivity. Removal of cobalt ions from the zeolite micropores by ion 

exchange results in the enhancement of the selectivity to the isomerized long chain 

hydrocarbons over Co/NaBEA zeolite. This catalyst has both high C5
+
 selectivity and 

higher fraction of isomerized hydrocarbons in the wax products. It is important to 



70 

 

mention that Na
+
 ions are not bulky enough to completely stop diffusion of Co

2+
 ions 

inside the micropores during impregnation. Consequently, the use of bulkier ions, e.g. 

K
+
, or direct impregnation after zeolite synthesis before template removal, might be 

possible options to reduce the cobalt ions diffusion inside the framework. The BEA 

zeolite has relatively large pores. The situation could be different for ZSM-5 with 

narrow zeolite pores (d= 5.5 Å) and in particular in the samples with larger zeolite 

crystallites. The diffusion limitation in ZSM-5 zeolites can become much more severe. 

The preferential localization of cobalt species on the outer surface of ZSM-5 might not 

be optimal for the enhanced catalytic performance. 

 

3.4 Conclusion 

The zeolite impregnation procedure and ion exchange sequence have a very 

strong impact on the structure and localization of cobalt species in BEA zeolite and 

catalytic performance in FT synthesis.  Occupation of the zeolite cation exchange sites 

by sodium ions favored deposition of cobalt during impregnation with cobalt nitrate on 

the zeolite external surface. Cobalt deposition on the H-from of BEA zeolite via 

impregnation results in cobalt localization both on the zeolite outer surface and in the 

zeolite micropores. 

Simultaneous deposition of cobalt on the BEA zeolite external surface and in the 

micropores leads to cracking and higher methane selectivities. The sample with the 

metal particles on the external surface and high concentration of Br?nsted acid sites in 

the zeolite micropores, i.e. CoH/NaBEA exhibited lower methane, higher selectivity to 

long chain hydrocarbons and significant yield of isomerized hydrocarbons.

Chapter 4: Direct production of iso-paraffins from syngas over hierarchical 

cobalt-ZSM-5 nanocomposites synthetized using carbon nanotubes as sacrificial 

templates 

 

Paper published in ChemCatChem, February 2018, IF 4.67, Qualis A1 

 

 

Abstract: This paper focuses on the effect of synthesis conditions on the structure of 

cobalt-ZSM-5 zeolites, localization, dispersion and reducibility of cobalt species and 

their catalytic performance in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The zeolite catalysts were 

prepared using carbon nanotubes as sacrificial templates. Addition of pristine carbon 

nanotubes resulted only in a slight increase in the zeolite mesoporosity, while the 

presence of carbon nanotubes impregnated with cobalt drastically modified the zeolite 

morphology and texture. The zeolite mesoporous volume increased by 3-4 times. The 

catalysts prepared using cobalt impregnated carbon nanotubes as templates showed 5-10 

times higher Fischer-Tropsch reaction rates normalized by reducible cobalt compared to 

the catalysts prepared by conventional impregnation. Higher selectivity to isomerized 

branched hydrocarbons on these zeolites was attributed to the enhanced diffusion 

favoring removal of isomerized products and avoiding their cracking. 

 

4.1 Introduction 

The depletion of fossil resources and increasing environmental concerns have 

led to the necessity for the development of new catalytic processes from alternative 

renewable resources. Natural gas and biomass can be transformed into syngas (H2/CO) 

and subsequently by Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis over cobalt-based catalysts into 

middle distillates and waxes 
[1-3]

. FT synthesis is a “nontrivial surface polymerization 



77 

 

reaction 
[4]

, with reaction selectivity typically described by the broad Anderson-Schulz-

Flory distribution (ASF) 
[1, 5]

. Consequently, the major challenge of FT reaction is to 

tune the reaction selectivity to specific hydrocarbon fractions. 

Several methods have been proposed for selectivity control in FT synthesis. 

First, catalytic cracking/isomerization of FT hydrocarbons can upgrade the reaction 

products to a specific fuel. Combination of FT synthesis with hydrocracking and 

isomerization of long chain hydrocarbons restricts the hydrocarbon distribution to a 

more convenient range 
[6]

. The isomerization and cracking of FT hydrocarbons would 

lead to iso-paraffins or diesel fuels constituted by the C10-C20 hydrocarbons. This 

multistage process, however, significantly reduces the efficiency of synthetic fuel 

production.  

An alternative to that multi-stage process would be to utilize bifunctional 

catalysts containing an active FT component, e.g. Co or Ru, and an acid catalyst active 

for cracking and isomerization. The proximity between metal and acid sites is an 

important parameter of the bifunctional catalysts often governing reaction rate and 

selectivities. Recently two additional methods for hydrocarbon selectivity control were 

proposed, which involve making use of nanoreactors 
[7]

 and microemulsions 
[8]

. In these 

methods the carbon chain length is limited by steric and diffusion limitations. 

Zeolites have been often suggested as promising catalysts for hydrocarbon 

cracking and isomerization under the conditions similar to FT synthesis 
[3, 9]

. An FT 

catalyst can be combined with a zeolite through several different methods: in a dual bed 

catalytic reactor with FT catalyst in the first layer followed by zeolite 
[10, 11]

; in hybrid 

catalysts prepared by mixing of FT catalyst and zeolite 
[12-14]

; in the catalysts prepared 

by zeolite impregnation with metal salts 
[13, 15-18]

; and by composite zeolite/metal 

catalysts, for example, core-shell materials 
[19, 20]

. 



78 

 

A significant number of research publications have been dedicated to direct 

synthesis of gasoline and middle distillates over dual bed or hybrid catalysts obtained 

through combination of supported Co catalysts and zeolites 
[10-16, 21-23]

. Different types 

of zeolite frameworks such as ZSM-5, MCM-22, IM-5, ITQ-2, BEA, MOR, and FAU 

with and without addition of noble-metal promoters have been tested and combined 

with FT synthesis catalysts. Still, slow diffusion of long-chain paraffins through zeolite 

pores, in particular on medium-pore zeolites, leads to a preferential participation of the 

acid sites on the zeolite external surface and lower isomerization efficiency 
[22]

.  

Impregnation is another method for the preparation of bi-functional Co-zeolite 

catalysts for direct production of fuels from syngas 
[13, 15-18, 24-26]

. Still, this method 

presents a major drawback that is the neutralization of the zeolite acid sites by cobalt 

ions. Cobalt ions, introduced during impregnation, can occupy cation positions in the 

zeolite framework decreasing the number of acid sites available for hydrocarbon 

isomerization and cracking, while larger cobalt oxide particles can be detected on the 

outer surface of zeolite. Additionally, isolated Co cations in the zeolite framework are 

very difficult to reduce to metallic cobalt. Cobalt species on the zeolite outer surface 

have low dispersion and generate insufficient number of active sites for FT reaction. 

This decreases the amount of active phase for FT synthesis.  

The improvement of zeolite diffusion properties through creating a hierarchical 

porous network has been the subject of extensive research 
[27-30]

. The application of this 

type of materials was proven to be beneficial for the activity and selectivity of several 

catalytic reactions including long-chain paraffin isomerization and cracking combined 

with FT synthesis 
[26, 29-33]

. Several synthesis methodologies, classified as top-down and 

bottom-up have be applied to the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites. A mesoporous 

network can be created directly by partially destroying the zeolite crystal through 



79 

 

desilication 
[27, 34]

 or dealumination 
[35, 36]

. Alternatively, hierarchical zeolites can be 

produced directly during the zeolite synthesis through the use of external templates that 

are sacrificed after zeolite synthesis, e.g. carbon structures 
[28, 37]

 resins 
[38]

 or polymers 

[39]
. It is important to emphasize that cobalt is usually added to the zeolites in the second 

step after hierarchization of the zeolite. 

The goal of this work is to obtain in a one-pot synthesis composite hierarchical 

zeolites with cobalt metal particles uniformly distributed in the zeolite mesoporous 

structure. This has been achieved by using cobalt impregnated carbon nanotubes 

(Co/CNT) as sacrificial templates during the synthesis of ZSM-5 zeolite. Two different 

carbon nanotubes (CNT) with outer diameters of 10-20 nm and 20-40 nm were used to 

induce mesoporosity in ZSM-5. The catalysts were characterized by low-temperature N2 

adsorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed 

reduction (TPR) and FTIR spectroscopy with adsorbed pyridine (Py). The hierarchical 

cobalt-zeolite samples were tested in FT synthesis and their catalytic performance in 

particular relative to synthesis of iso-paraffins was compared with the Co/ZSM-5 

catalysts prepared by conventional impregnation. 

 

4.2 Experimental Section 

Impregnation of carbon nanotubes with cobalt 

Prior to the impregnation, the multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were 

treated with nitric acid to remove all metal contamination. Two different CNT samples 

(Iolitec nanomaterial, 95%) with different diameters, that is, 10-20 nm and 20-40 nm, 

were used. Typically, CNTs (3 g) were pretreated in concentrated HNO3 (68%, 210 mL) 

for 14 h under reflux conditions. After, the samples were filtered, washed with distilled 

water until pH 7, and dried at 100 °C overnight.   



80 

 

Cobalt and platinum were introduced to CNTs by wet impregnation method 

using respectively Co(NO3)2*6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Sigma-

Aldrich) as precursors. Typically,  Co(NO3)2 and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 solution (50 mL) was 

used per gram of CNTs and the precursor amount was estimated to obtain a final 

composition of 20 wt.% Co and 0.1 wt.% Pt. The mixture was submitted to ultrasonic 

treatment for 30 min and dried at 80 °C. The samples were calcined at 400 °C for 4 h 

under a nitrogen atmosphere. 

After the calcination, the samples were treated with H2O2 to restore the 

hydrophilic properties of the CNTs. Typically, 30 mL of 1:1 H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 

35%) and distilled water were added to impregnated CNTs (2.56 g), which was 

sonicated for 30 min and dried at 80 °C.  

 

Synthesis of hierarchical cobalt - ZSM-5 

The ZSM-5 zeolite was synthesized by using the following initial composition of 

the gel: 2.7NaCl:1Al2O3:12.5TPAOH:55.8SiO2:7500H2O. Sodium chloride (0.380 g, 

Janssen Chimica, P.A.), tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (3.0 g, Sigma-Aldrich, 1M in 

H2O), sodium aluminate (0.040 g, Sigma-Aldrich) and distilled water were mixed until 

a clear solution was obtained. Then, Co/CNT (0.3 g) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 

2.8 g, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) were added to the solution. After, the synthesis gel was 

aged for 1 h at room temperature under stirring. The synthesis gel was set inside a 

Teflon-lined autoclave (40 mL) and the zeolite crystallization performed under static 

condition at 170 °C for 24 h. After cooling down, the solid was recovered by filtration 

and washed until neutral pH. The final solid was calcined at 600 °C for 4 h under air. 

Thermogravimetric analysis showed complete decomposition and oxidation of cobalt-

containing carbon nanotubes at temperatures below 400 °C. This suggests that cobalt 



81 

 

zeolite composite catalysts calcined at 600 °C in air did not contain any residual carbon 

species. 

For comparison, zeolite syntheses without addition of CNTs or in the presence 

of CNTs, which did not contain cobalt ions, were performed. The prepared zeolites were 

impregnated with cobalt and platinum precursors in the final catalysts.  

To obtain the zeolite acid form, two successive exchanges using 2 M NH4NO3 

aqueous solution at 80 °C for 1 h (1 g of zeolite per 50 mL of solution) were performed. 

The ammonium form was converted into the protonic form by calcination at 450 °C for 

4 h under air.  

The synthesized samples were denoted as: CoCNT(x)/ZSM-5 for the samples 

synthesized with cobalt and platinum co-impregnated CNTs (x represents the CNT 

diameter used in the synthesis, that is, 10-20 or 20-40 nm); Co(x)/ ZSM-5 for the 

samples synthesized with CNTs and subsequently impregnated with Co and Pt (x 

represents the CNT diameter used in the synthesis, that is, 10-20 nm or 20-40 nm). 

Co/ZSM-5 stands for the zeolite synthetized without addition of CNTs and impregnated 

with the Co and Pt precursors.  

 

Catalyst characterization 

The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) by using a D8 

Advance diffractometer equipped with an energy dispersive type detector and a 

monochromatic CuK? radiation source. The samples were analyzed using a step of 0.02° 

with an acquisition time of 0.5 s. The average size of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) crystallites 

was determined by the Scherrer equation. 

The sample chemical composition was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) 

on a spectrometer M4 TORNADO (Bruker). This instrument is equipped with 2 anodes: 



82 

 

rhodium X-ray tube 50 kV/600 mA (30 W) and a tungsten X-Ray tube 50 kV/700 mA 

(35 W). For sample characterization, the rhodium X-rays with a poly-capillary lens 

enabling excitation of an area of 200 ?m were used. The detector used was a Silicon-

Drift-Detector Si(Li) with&amp;lt;145 eV resolution at 100000 cps (MnK?) and cooled with a 

Peltier cooling (253°K). The measurement was done under vacuum (20 mbar). 

Quantitative analysis was performed using fundamental parameter (FP; standardless).  

The textural properties of the samples were determined by N2 physisorption on a 

Micromeritics ASAP 2000 apparatus. Prior to analysis, the samples were degassed 

under vacuum (10 µmHg) at 350 °C for 4 h. The total pore volume (TPV) was 

calculated from the amount of vapor adsorbed at a relative pressure P/P0 = 0.97. The 

samples surface area was estimated by the BET method, while the micropore volume 

and external surface were calculated using the deBoer t-plot method.  

The catalyst reducibility was studied using temperature-programmed reduction 

(TPR) system with an Autochem II (Micrometrics) apparatus. The samples were 

reduced under a flow of 5% H2 in argon (50 mL min
-1

) and heated up to 800 °C at a rate 

of 5 °C/min. 

Comparative characterization of the acidic OH groups (Brönsted acid sites) and 

Lewis acid sites in solid acids, e.g. zeolites, was carried out using transmittance FTIR 

measurements in the 6000-900 cm
-1

 spectral range utilizing pyridine adsorption for 

monitoring the strength and relative quantities of both Lewis and Brönsted acid sites. 

FTIR transmittance measurements were performed at ~30 °C using self-supported disks 

of studied materials activated at 450 °C for 5 h in vacuum (with the temperature ramp of 

1 
o
C/min). FTIR spectra have been collected using a Thermo iS10 spectrometer at a 4 

cm
-1

 resolution (0.96 cm
-1

 data spacing). The spectra were analyzed and presented 



83 

 

(including integration, differentiation and determination of peak positions) using 

specialized Thermo software, Omnic. Acidic properties of the samples were evaluated 

using temperature programmed desorption of pyridine (Py) monitored 

spectroscopically. An excess of Py was admitted into the transmittance cell at 150 °C, in 

a stepwise manner until no changes were observed in the spectra. The saturated sample 

was then evacuated for 10 min at 150 °C to remove physically adsorbed Py and the 

FTIR spectrum collected. In the transmittance TPD experiments, Py was removed under 

vacuum in a stepwise fashion at 150-450 °C, and the FTIR spectra were obtained at 

each temperature step, every 50 °C. The intensity of the Py-L and Py-H
+
 peaks at ~ 

1455 and 1545 cm
-1 

was measured as a function of temperature, and the resulting plots 

used to compare the effective acidity of the samples. 

The TEM observations of the samples were obtained by using a Tecnai 

instrument equipped with a LaB6 crystal operated at 200 kV. Before the analysis, the 

samples were dispersed by ultrasound in ethanol for 5 min, and a drop of the suspension 

was deposited onto a carbon membrane on a 300 mesh copper grid. The STEM-

HAADF tomographic analysis was carried out on a Jeol 2100F (field emission gun) 

microscope operating at 200 kV by using a spot size of 1.1 Å with a current density of 

0.5 pA Å
-1

. 

 

Catalytic tests 

The catalytic performance of the samples was tested in FT synthesis. The 

experiments were performed in a milli-fixed bed reactor. All the details of the catalytic 

test relevant to mass and heat transfers are given in our earlier publication [53]. No 

significant (&gt;0.5 bar) pressure drop and temperature gradient are observed under the 



84 

 

reaction conditions. Prior to testing, the samples were reduced in situ in pure H2 gas 

flow (3 mL min
-1

) at 400 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 3 °C/min. Then, the reactor 

was cooled down to room temperature, the flow switched to syngas (H2/CO = 2) and the 

pressure adjusted to 20 bar. Nitrogen (5% of the CO flow) was used as internal 

standard. The flow was adjusted to obtain a GHSV of 20-70 L/gCo.h. After achieving the 

desired pressure, the temperature was progressively increased to the reaction 

temperature, i.e. 250 °C, at a rate of 3 °C/min. The reaction was conducted at 250 °C in 

order to create in addition to FT synthesis favorable conditions for secondary reactions 

such as olefin cracking and isomerization. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was 

expressed in cm
3
 gcat

-1
 h

-1
. The units correspond to the volume of syngas, which passed 

through 1 g of catalyst per hour. The gaseous reaction products, i.e. up to the C5 

hydrocarbons were analyzed online using gas-chromatography (GC×FID/TCD, Varian, 

CP-3800). The liquid products were condensed under pressure and analyzed ex situ 

using a Shimadzu 2010-Plus-AF gas-chromatograph.  

 

4.3 Results and Discussion 

Catalyst structure 

The XRD patterns of the synthesized samples are displayed in Figure 4-1. All 

samples present characteristic peaks of MFI zeolite. The presence of CNTs during 

hydrothermal treatment does not affect to any noticeable degree the intensity of the 

XRD peaks. The introduction of cobalt by impregnation or with CNTs during the 

zeolite synthesis led to an overall reduction of the intensity of the zeolite characteristic 

peaks. This was attributed to the effect of “dilution” and lower concentration of MFI 

phase in these samples. The Co3O4 phase was detected using a characteristic peak at 2 ? 

equal to 36.8°in all samples containing cobalt. The particle size of Co3O4 calculated 



85 

 

using the Scherrer equation (Table 4-1) was in all cases between 27 and 44 nm, 

indicating that a large fraction of cobalt is located either in the mesopores or on the 

zeolite external surface. Interestingly, smaller diameter CNTs (10-20 nm) during zeolite 

crystallization led to the formation of smaller Co3O4 particles, i.e. around 30 nm, when 

compared with the synthesis without CNTs or using larger diameter CNTs (20-40 nm).

The catalyst textural properties are listed in Table 4-1. The nitrogen adsorption 

desorption isotherms are displayed in Figure S4 (Supporting information, SI). The 

introduction of CNTs without cobalt in the zeolite synthesis gel did not affect to any 

greater extent the zeolite overall surface area. However, the catalyst porosity undergoes 

significant changes. The mesoporous volume of the zeolites prepared using the 10-

20 nm and 20-40 nm diameter CNTs increased by 50% and 80%, respectively. This 

variation is possibly caused by creating mesoporosity via removal of the CNTs 

incorporated inside the zeolite crystals during crystallization 
[28]

.  

After cobalt impregnation, a significant decrease in the sample surface area and 

pore volume was observed. This decrease was attributed to the presence of Co3O4 which 

can result in a partial plugging of the zeolite pores and “dilution” effect. In all cases, the 

impregnation with cobalt nitrate also caused a decrease in the zeolite microporous 

volume. This suggests that at least a part of cobalt is located inside the zeolite 

framework. The mesoporous volume was however slightly higher in the samples 

synthetized in the presence of CNTs (without cobalt). This seems to confirm partial 

incorporation of CNTs into zeolites during their synthesis and subsequent generation of 

mesoporosity during the CNT combustion.  

The samples synthesized with Co/CNT as templates displayed surface area and 

microporous volume similar to the pure zeolite (Table 4-1), while the mesoporous 

volume was significantly increased. In comparison to the ZSM-5 samples synthesized 

with pristine CNTs, the CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 mesoporous 

volume was, respectively, 185% and 220% higher than that of Co(10-20)/ZSM-5 

and Co(20- 40)/ZSM- 5. 



87 

 

The impact of the CNTs on the zeolite morphology was investigated by TEM 

(Figure 4-2). The zeolite crystallization in the presence of CNTs led to the formation of 

large pores in the zeolite crystals (Figure 4-2A). These pores were formed after 

calcination when the CNTs were removed from the zeolite. The zeolite phase clearly 

displayed imprinting coming from CNTs, which were partially encapsulated inside the 

zeolite crystals during germination 
[26]

. The presence of these regularly shaped pores 

was not observed on zeolites crystallized in the presence of cobalt impregnated CNT 

(Figure 4-2B). In the presence of Co/CNT, the formed zeolite crystals took a less 

regular shape, in agreement with the higher mesopore volumes observed for calcined 

CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 (Table 4-1). Schematically the zeolite 

synthesis process in the presence of Co/CNT is shown in Figure 4-3. Figure 4-2C and 

Figure 4-2D show the formation of a uniform layered material. Importantly, these 

layered structures are only observed when cobalt was present in CNT added to the 

zeolite synthesis mixture. Indeed, the zeolite morphology replicates that of carbon 

nanotubes containing cobalt nanoparticles. 

 

Figure 4-2 TEM images of Co(10-20)/ZSM-5 (A), CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5(B), CoCNT(10-

20)/ZSM-5 high magnification(C) and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 high magnification. 

 

In addition, Figure 4-2C and Figure 4-2D display a large number of small Co3O4 

particles with a diameter between 1 and 5 nm as well as larger particles, i.e. 30-50 nm. 



88 

 

This suggests that the zeolite contains two types of cobalt particles: smaller cobalt 

particles of 1-5 nm are located in the zeolite meso- and micropores, while larger cobalt 

particles of 30-50 nm are situated in the zeolite mesopores and on the outer surface. 

Note that only large Co3O4 crystallites can be detected in the zeolites by XRD, while it 

is impossible to detect by XRD cobalt oxide particles smaller than 5 nm.  

To confirm uniform distribution of cobalt nanoparticles in the zeolite mesopores, 

we conducted additional experiments using the STEM-HAADF electron tomography. 

The typical slices (xy) and (xz) extracted from the 3D volume calculated by tomography 

of the sample CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 prepared using Co/CNT(20-40) as sacrificial template 

(Figure 4-4) show the presence of cobalt nanoparticles inside the mesoporous structure 

of zeolite.  

Thus, the electron microscopy results are clearly indicative of the important role 

of cobalt located on CNTs for directing zeolite synthesis. Cobalt species probably act as 

zeolite nucleation sites for designing mesoporous zeolites with the CNT-type 

morphology (Figure 4-3).

Resulting zeolites replicate carbon nanotube morphology. 

 

The TPR profiles of the catalysts are shown in Figure 4-5. The reduction profiles 

of the impregnated samples were consistent with the two-step Co3O4 reduction to 

metallic Co. Co3O4 is first reduced to CoO which is then reduced to metallic Co, thus 

leading to the formation of two H2 consumption peaks 
[13, 40]

. In the samples prepared by 

impregnation, i.e. Co/ZSM-5, Co(10-20)/ZSM-5 and Co(20-40)/ZSM-5, the characteristic 



89 

 

Co3O4 reduction peaks overlap leading to a broad peak with a “low temperature” 

shoulder corresponding to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO. 

 

Figure 4-4 Results of STEM-HAADF electron tomography analysis of CoCNT(20-

40)ZSM-5 catalyst (3D volume and typical slices showing clearly the presence of cobalt 

nanoparticles inside the zeolite structure). 

 

No peaks at the temperatures higher than 400 °C were observed indicating the 

absence of isolated exchanged cobalt ions or barely reducible cobalt silicates. 

Interestingly, the hydrogen consumption profiles were different in the samples 

synthesized through the germination of zeolite in the presence of Co impregnated CNT. 

The broad TPR peak which occurred at temperatures below 400 °C, can be attributed to 

the reduction of Co3O4 crystallites to CoO and then to metallic Co 
[41, 42]

. The second 

hydrogen consumption peak, observed at 700-730 °C, suggests the presence of a more 

refractory cobalt phase.

The formation of amorphous cobalt silicates or aluminates is a possible 

explanation. Additionally, incorporation of cobalt in the framework structure of the MFI 

zeolite cannot be completely discarded. Indeed, several authors have reported 

incorporation of transition metals, including cobalt, into zeolite framework when this 

metal was present during hydrothermal synthesis 
[43-46]

. The cobalt reducibility and 

acidity data evaluated from pyridine adsorption and FTIR spectroscopy data are given in

The introduction of CNTs or Co/CNT during the hydrothermal synthesis of the 

zeolite caused no significant variations in the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. Significant changes in 

acid properties were observed between the impregnated samples and the ones when the 

Co was present during hydrothermal treatment. All the samples synthesized using cobalt 

nitrate impregnation of the zeolite displayed higher concentration of Lewis acid sites. 

Unsaturated sites in cobalt oxide particles are known to be responsible for the creation 

of Lewis acidity 
[47]

. Therefore, higher concentration of Lewis acid sites in the 

impregnated samples could be related to the higher loading of cobalt oxide in these 

catalysts as shown by TPR (Figure 4-5). Much lower concentration of Co3O4 (18% and 

7% respectively) was detected by TPR in CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-

5. These samples showed lower concentration of Lewis acid sites. Note also that the 

samples synthesized through impregnation showed lower concentration of Brönsted 

acid sites in comparison with the catalysts synthesized in the presence of Co/CNT. The 

synthesis of the zeolite directly in the presence of Co/CNT enables higher total Brönsted 

acid site concentration. The variation of IR intensity of bands attributed to Py 

adsorption on Brönsted and Lewis acid sites is shown in Figure S2 (SI). The zeolites 

synthetized using Co/CNT show a higher effective strength of Brönsted acid sites, 

compared to the samples prepared by impregnation, while the impregnated samples 

have a much higher concentration of stronger Lewis acid sites (Table 4-2). 

 

Catalytic performance in FT synthesis 

The results of the FT catalytic evaluation of the materials are shown in Table 

4-3, Figure 4-6 and Figure S3, SI. FT reaction rate varies between 131 and 

371 mmolCO/h.gCo. The catalytic performance of cobalt zeolite catalysts was tested for 

at least 30 h. No noticeable evolution of catalytic performance was observed under these 



92 

 

conditions. The samples were organized with respect to their activity in the following 

order: Co(10-20)/ZSM-5 &gt;CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5&gt;Co(20-40)/ZSM-5&gt;Co/ZSM-5&gt;CoCNT(20-

40)/ZSM-5. The catalytic performance of cobalt catalysts depends on the density of 

cobalt metallic active sites. Cobalt reducibility is therefore an important parameter.

Whereas the TPR profiles of the samples prepared by impregnation suggest the 

presence of cobalt species reducible at temperatures lower than 450 °C, the TPR 

profiles (Figure 4-5) of the CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 samples 

synthetized using Co/CNT templates show that only a small portion of the cobalt is 

reducible at 400 °C. Consequently, the samples prepared by addition of Co/CNT during 

the zeolite synthesis contain a higher fraction of cobalt silicate or aluminates, which are 

not active for the reaction. Interestingly, when comparing the activity of the catalysts on 



93 

 

the basis of reducible cobalt (Table 4-3), both CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-

40)/ZSM-5 displayed a 5 to 10 times higher FT rate compared to the impregnated 

samples. 

The higher activity per reducible cobalt observed on the samples obtained by 

zeolite germination on Co/CNT can be linked to their enhanced mesoporous structure. 

Cobalt CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 display much higher mesoporous 

volume. During the catalyst preparation, cobalt metal nanoparticles introduced using the 

Co/CNT sacrificial templates are distributed more uniformly within the zeolite 

mesopores than in the catalysts prepared by impregnation. In addition, catalyst 

mesoporosity enhanced in CoCNT/ZSM-5 compared to other cobalt zeolite catalysts 

facilitates diffusion of the reagents and intermediates and removal of the reaction 

products. The cobalt metal nanoparticles size is also known to be an important factor for 

the FT synthesis performance 
[48]

. The average size of cobalt oxide crystallites 

calculated from XRD in all samples was between 27 and 40 nm. In contrast to the 

samples prepared by impregnation, the TEM images of CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and 

CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 (Figure 4-2 and Figure 4-4) clearly show the presence of Co3O4 

particles with the size between 1 and 5 nm. Some of these nanoparticles are probably 

located in the zeolite micropores.  

Table 4-3 also shows hydrocarbon selectivities observed in FT synthesis on 

cobalt–zeolite catalysts for CO conversions in the range of 28 and 42%. Previous 

reports 
[3, 13, 16]

 suggest very small impact of variation of conversion between 30 and 

40% on the reaction selectivity.  The methane selectivity varies between 13 and 37%. 

The samples synthesized by impregnation, i.e. Co/ZSM-5, Co(10-20)/ZSM-5 and Co(20-

40)/ZSM-5, display much higher selectivity towards methane formation when compared 

to CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5. Notably, methane selectivity was 



94 

 

between 1.8 and 2.9 times lower when Co/CNT was present during zeolite synthesis. 

Similarly, the C2-C4 hydrocarbon selectivity was also higher in the samples obtained by 

cobalt impregnation, in particular on Co(20-40)/ZSM-5. Metal particle sizes and their 

location in the zeolite can explain the selectivity towards short carbon-chain products 

and methane observed on the impregnated samples. Indeed, during the impregnation, 

cobalt can diffuse inside the zeolite framework generating small particles, in addition to 

the larger metal particles located on the zeolite external surface. The diffusion 

limitations and smaller metal particles inside the zeolite framework can result in higher 

methane and lower carbon-chain products selectivities 
[7]

. Lower methane selectivity 

observed on the CoCNT/ZSM-5 samples could be also due to partial dissolution of 

extremely small cobalt nanoparticles during zeolite germination around these cobalt 

species. The occurrence of higher diffusion limitations in the impregnated samples is 

also consistent with the higher paraffin to olefin ratio (Table 4-3) observed for the 

impregnated samples. Higher paraffin yields are linked to the higher rate of olefin 

secondary hydrogenation, which are favored when diffusion limitations and olefin 

residence time in the zeolite pores are more significant.

Figure 4-6 Molar distribution of liquid products by carbon number. IsomerTotal 

represents the total amount of isomerized products in the gas fraction. ? represents the 

chain growth coefficient for the ASF distribution. 

 

The liquid product distribution is shown in Figure 4-6, with the respective n-

paraffin and isomer product selectivity. Independently of the synthesis procedure, none 

of the zeolite based catalysts yielded products with more than 25 carbon atoms. Thus, it 

is possible to assert that the zeolite support is responsible for the reduction of the carbon 

chain of the FT products. Note that cobalt catalyst on non-acidic supports at similar 

reaction conditions show formation of long-chain hydrocarbons with up to 50 carbon 

atoms 
[13]

. This phenomenon is reflected by the chain growth probability (?) in the 

Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution. Figure S3, SI clearly shows modification of the 

Anderson-Schulz-Flory plot for CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 which was synthetized using 

Co/CNT as sacrificial templates compared to other catalysts. Under similar reaction 

conditions and on a non-acidic support, e.g. SiO2, ? is commonly around 0.85 for 

cobalt-based catalysts 
[13]

, whereas for the samples in this study the chain growth 

probability was between 0.58 and 0.68.  



96 

 

The catalytic data suggest strong influence of the zeolite on both isomerization 

and cracking. On the one hand, the reaction products over cobalt zeolite composites 

contained significant amounts of isomers because of olefin isomerization on the zeolite 

Brönsted acid sites (Figure 4-5). On other hand, the carbon chain length over the cobalt 

zeolite catalysts was much shorter than on silica-supported counterparts. The reduction 

of the carbon chain growth when using zeolite supports for the FT synthesis is generally 

attributed to the occurrence of cracking reactions over Brönsted acid sites. The long-

chain hydrocarbons resulting from the FT synthesis undergo cracking and isomerization 

on the zeolite acid sites leading to the formation of the shorter branched hydrocarbons. 

Indeed, the presence of isomerized hydrocarbons in the wax was observed for all 

catalysts. The proportion between isomerized products and linear paraffins was largely 

influenced by the catalyst synthesis procedures. Among the impregnated samples, the 

selectivity towards isomerization products was higher on Co/ZSM-5 followed by Co(10-

20)/ZSM-5 and Co(20-40)/ZSM-5, respectively with isomer fractions of 57%, 48%, and 

35%. Interestingly, CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 displayed the highest selectivity towards 

isomerization products, i.e. fraction of branched isomers of 63%. It is important to 

mention that hydrocarbons with a higher isomerization degree are more likely to lead to 

the formation of tertiary carbocations, which however, can undergo ?-scission [49]. 

Moreover, because of longer residence time in the zeolite micropores, the long chain 

hydrocarbons are more likely to undergo cracking 
[50]

. Therefore, lower isomerization 

selectivity observed on the impregnated samples might be linked to a higher cracking 

rate of the long chain hydrocarbons. The higher selectivity to the C2-C4 hydrocarbons, 

and consequent lower C5
+
 hydrocarbon yield, observed for the impregnated samples 

could be due to the cracking of larger molecules.  



97 

 

The occurrence of primary and secondary cracking reactions in zeolite materials 

is often attributed to diffusion limitations 
[51]

. Indeed, a longer residence time of the 

molecules in the vicinity of acid sites increases the probability of hydrocarbons to 

undergo cracking while shorter residence time of long chain hydrocarbons in proximity 

of zeolite acid sites would favor isomerization. The porosity of the impregnated sample 

is mostly constituted by micropores, while CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-

5 have significant mesoporous volume created by the CNT sacrificial templates. The 

diffusion of higher hydrocarbons is therefore enhanced in the CoCNT/ZSM-5 catalysts, 

which reduces their residence time inside the zeolite pores and probability of cracking. 

This suggestion is consistent with higher selectivity to longer carbon chain 

hydrocarbons observed on CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 (Table 4-3). 

Additionally, the higher cracking reaction rate on the impregnated samples would 

explain the lower isomerization selectivity on the impregnated catalysts, since the 

cracking rate of branched hydrocarbons is several orders of magnitude higher 
[52]

 than 

for linear conterparts. On CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5,  the molecules 

produced by FT synthesis can diffuse more easily, owing  to the higher mesoporous 

volume of the samples. Therefore, the cracking reactions rates lessened due to the faster 

diffusion and removal of the isomerized products. This improves isomerization 

selectivity and selectivity toward long-chain hydrocarbons. 

The synthesis of zeolite in the presence of cobalt impregnated CNTs avoids the 

zeolite pore plugging during cobalt impregnation while generating a complementary 

mesoporous structure in the zeolite support. Consequently, the diffusion is improved 

enabling a reduction in the methane and C2-C4 hydrocarbon selectivities. Additionally, 

the liquid products are mainly composed of hydrocarbons up to C20 with a higher degree 

of isomerization. Therefore, the catalysts on the basis of mesoporous zeolites 



98 

 

synthesized using carbon nanotubes with cobalt nanoparticles as sacrificial templates 

are more suitable for the direct production of fuels from syngas than conventional cobalt 

zeolite supported catalysts prepared by impregnation. 

4.4 Conclusion 

The use of cobalt impregnated CNTs as sacrificial template enables direct 

synthesis of cobalt/ZSM-5 mesoporous composite catalysts. The synthesized catalyst 

had significantly higher mesoporous volume when the synthesis was performed in the 

presence of Co/CNT than pristine CNTs. The morphology was also strongly affected by 

the zeolite synthesis method. The samples prepared during zeolite synthesis using the 

Co/CNT sacrificial templates showed clearly expressed layered structure. This indicates 

that the cobalt had an impact on the zeolite germination process. At the same time, the 

final samples had similar Si/Al ratio. The catalysts prepared by impregnated exhibited 

higher concentration of Lewis acid sites, whereas the catalysts prepared using Co/CNT 

showed higher amount of Brönsted acid sites. A significant amount of cobalt silicates 

was observed when cobalt was present during the zeolite synthesis. 

The catalytic performance in FT synthesis was significantly affected by the 

catalyst synthesis procedure. The FT reaction rate normalized by reducible cobalt was 

5-10 times higher over the catalysts prepared using Co/CNT as sacrificial template. The 

higher mesoporous volume of the samples synthesized using Co/CNT during zeolite 

germination allows a faster diffusion of products and reagents, leading to longer chain 

products and a reduction of the cracking reactions while improving the selectivity to 

branched hydrocarbons. 

The originality and major advantage of the developed method are relevant to 

simultaneous creation of zeolite mesoporous structure and introduction of cobalt 



99 

 

nanoparticles within zeolite crystallites. Different to the techniques of post-synthesis 

introduction of cobalt, the method developed in this paper leads to a uniform 

distribution of cobalt nanoparticles within the zeolite mesoporous structure, enhanced 

diffusion and catalytic performance in FT reaction.

Chapter 5: Multifaceted Role of Metal Carbon Nanotube Templates in the 

Synthesis of Hierarchical Zeolite Composite Catalysts 

 

Manuscript submitted for publication 

Abstract: Metal zeolite nanocomposites are extensively used in heterogeneous 

catalysis. Small zeolite pore size and non-uniform distribution of the metal component 

within the zeolite structure heavily reduce the efficiency of these catalysts. In this work, 

we propose a new strategy for the design of hierarchical zeolites with specific shape, 

enhanced mesoporosity and uniform distribution of highly dispersed metals such as 

cobalt, nickel, and magnesium in the zeolite crystals. The strategy involves using metal 

carbon nanotubes as structure directing agents. Multiple roles of the metal carbon 

nanotubes in the zeolite synthesis are uncovered. First, they serve as a replica to create 

zeolite with specific fibrous shape. Second, they fulfill the role of a mesoporogen and 

increase 3-5 times the zeolite secondary porosity. Finally, they operate a vehicle to 

uniformly introduce the metal functions inside the mesoporous zeolites.  Importantly, 

the presence of metals in carbon nanotubes is essential for the enhancement of 

mesoporosity. The catalysts prepared using metal carbon nanotube templates have 

shown enhanced catalytic performance in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydrogenation of 

aromatics and anisole acylation.

5.1 Introduction 

Zeolites are microporous crystalline solids with a regular pore system, which 

have found numerous applications in industrial processes such as oil refining, organic 

synthesis, adsorption and separation.  The zeolite crystal structure determines the size 

and geometry of the micropores. They are very specific for a given type of the zeolite 
[1]

 

and often are comparable with the size of reacting molecules. Smaller and uniform 

pores lead to stronger interaction between the zeolite and reacting molecules and thus, 

introduce geometric, electronic confinement and shape selectivity phenomena for a 

catalytic reaction involving bulky molecules 
[2]

. Zeolites can be tailored to specific 

catalytic applications by controlling Brönsted and Lewis acidity as well as by 

introducing new catalytic functions, including metal cations, clusters, metal oxides, 

organic complexes and enzymes. 

Zeolites in their hydrogen form are considered as acid catalysts, while metal-

containing zeolites are considered as bifunctional catalysts that exhibit complex 

behavior. The concentrations and intrinsic activity of the metal and acid sites, and in 

particular, their localization within the zeolite structure are of utmost importance for the 

catalyst activity, selectivity and stability 
[3-5]

. Ion exchange, impregnation, or 

introduction of a metal precursor to the zeolite synthesis gel have been often used for 

synthesis of metal-zeolite composites. In the metal-zeolite composites, metal can be 

present either in the form of isolated cations in the cationic sites, or in the form of 

tetrahedrally coordinated cations isomorphously substituting silicon or aluminum atoms 

in the zeolite framework, or finally, as small metal or oxide nanoparticles localized 

within the zeolite micro- or mesopores. The distribution of metal component with the 

zeolite is of paramount importance for the resulting catalytic performance. The distance 



110 

 

between metal nanoparticles and acid sites, “site intimacy” 
[6]

, diffusional limitations for 

the intermediates during their transport from one site to another 
[7-10]

 strongly affect the 

performance of many catalytic reactions 

The very small pore size of zeolites (~1 nm) imposes diffusional limitations for 

many catalytic reactions, in particular for those, involving bulky molecules. In order to 

overcome these, numerous efforts have made to synthesize nano-sized zeolite 

crystals 
[11]

, extra-large pore zeolites 
[12]

, or mesoporous zeolites 
[13, 14]

, the latter are 

often referred as hierarchical zeolites. The hierarchical zeolites contain, in addition to 

the well-defined micropore system, mesopores with the diameters in the range of 2-

50 nm 
[15, 16]

. Different to zeolite micropores, the size, shape and orientation of these 

mesopores are not directly related to the zeolite crystalline structure. The methods used 

for the preparation of hierarchical zeolites could be summarized into two main groups. 

(i) Bottom-up methods, where sacrificial templates of desired size and dimensions are 

incorporated into zeolite crystals during the crystallization step. These templates are 

then eliminated by combustion or extraction. (ii) Top-down methods, including post-

synthesis chemical treatment of zeolite crystals leading to the extraction of aluminum 

and silicon atoms and partial dissolution of the zeolite framework. Note that it is usually 

much more difficult to maintain zeolites with good crystallinity and to generate uniform 

mesopores using top-down methods such as steam treatment, acid and alkaline leaching 

[17]
 compared to the bottom-up strategies. 

Both hard 
[18, 19]

 and soft templates 
[20, 21]

 have been utilized to synthetize 

hierarchical zeolites using the bottom up approach. The hard templates usually include 

carbon nanoparticles, nanotubes and polymer beads, while various cationic surfactants, 

organosilane, cationic polymer, and ionic liquids 
[22, 23]

 are considered as soft secondary 



111 

 

templates. Both hard and soft templates could be removed by calcination. Among the 

hard templates, carbon nanotubes (CNT) have attracted particular attention in the 

literature. CNT are very versatile materials 
[24, 25]

 as their properties are strongly affected 

by the presence of hydrophobic or hydrophilic functional groups, metals, oxide and 

other dopants. As a result, the properties of hierarchical zeolites prepared using CNT as 

secondary templates are strongly affected by the features of CNT and zeolite synthesis 

conditions. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been performed to evaluate 

the effect of different metals present in CNT on the zeolite crystallization and 

mesoporosity.  

In this chapter, metal containing CNT (Me-CNT) were applied as secondary 

templates for synthesis of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites. We uncovered at least three 

roles of Me-CNT in the zeolite synthesis. First, they strongly affect the shape of the 

synthesized zeolites, which seem to be replicas of CNT and show distinct fibrous 

texture. Second, the Me-CNT plays a role of mesoporogen and strongly enhance the 

zeolite mesoporous volume. Finally, zeolite synthesis in the presence of Me-CNT offers 

the opportunity to simultaneously introduce new catalytic functions leading to 

bifunctional metal-zeolite catalysts. The introduced metals are then uniformly 

distributed within the zeolite crystals. The presence of metal species in CNT is essential 

to obtain the observed phenomena. Note that only very limited impact on zeolite porous 

structure was observed by using metal-free CNT as secondary hard templates. The 

metal zeolite composites prepared using metal-CNT templates exhibited improved 

catalytic performance in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydrogenation of aromatics and 

anisole acylation with hexanoic acid.

5.2 Experimental 

CNT and their impregnation with metal precursors 

Two multi-wall CNT samples (Iolitec nanomaterial, 95%) with different 

diameters, i.e. 10-20 nm and 20-40 nm, were used. The CNT were pretreated with nitric 

acid to remove all metal contaminations. This treatment also converted CNT into their 

hydrophilic forms. Typically, 3 g of CNT were pretreated in 210 mL of concentrated 

HNO3 (68%) for 14 h under reflux. Next, the samples were filtered, washed with 

distilled water until pH = 7 and dried at 100 ºC overnight.  

Metals were added to CNT via the wet impregnation method using Co(NO3)2 

6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) and Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Sigma-Aldrich), Mg(NO3)2 6H2O (Sigma-

Aldrich) and Ni(NO3)2 6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) as precursors. Co-impregnation with 

platinum was solely used for the preparation of cobalt catalysts. Typically, the precursor 

amount for impregnation was calculated to obtain 20 wt.% of the metal in the final 

catalyst. The mixture was subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 30 min and dried at 

80 °C. The samples were calcined at 400 °C for 4 h under nitrogen atmosphere. 

After calcination in nitrogen, the hydrophilic properties of CNT were partially 

lost. In order to restore the CNT hydrophilicity, the samples were treated with H2O2. 

Typically, 30 mL of 1:1 H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 35%) and distilled water mixture were 

added to 2.56 g of impregnated CNT, sonicated for 30 min and dried at 80 °C. The 

metal supported CNT catalysts are denoted as Metal/CNT(x) (where Metal=Co, Ni or 

Mg) and x is the CNT diameter in nm.  

 

Synthesis of hierarchical metal-ZSM-5 zeolites 



113 

 

The ZSM-5 zeolite was synthesized by using a synthesis gel with the initial 

composition of 2.7NaCl:1Al2O3:12.5TPAOH:55.8SiO2:7500H2O. The synthesis of the 

zeolite was carried out by mixing sodium chloride (0.380 g, Janssen Chimica, P.A.), 

tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (3.0 g, Sigma-Aldrich, 1 M in H2O), sodium 

aluminate (0.040 g, Sigma-Aldrich) and distilled water until a clear solution was 

obtained. Metal/CNT (0.24 g) and tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS, 2.8 g, Sigma-Aldrich, 

99%) were added to the previous solution. Then, the synthesis gel was aged for 1 h at 

room temperature under stirring. The synthesis gel was put inside a Teflon-lined 

autoclave (40 mL). The zeolite crystallization was performed under static condition at 

170 °C for 24 h. After cooling down, the solid was recovered by filtration and washed 

until pH=7 was achieved. The final solid was calcined at 600 °C for 4 h in air. Further 

details relevant to the introduction of cobalt with CNT into ZSM-5 zeolite are available 

elsewhere 
[26]

. 

For comparison, the zeolite syntheses using pure CNT were performed under the 

same conditions using a similar gel composition. The resulting zeolites were then 

impregnated using incipient wetness method with cobalt, nickel and magnesium nitrates 

as precursors.  

In order to obtain the zeolite acid form, two successive exchanges using 2 M 

NH4NO3 aqueous solution at 80 °C for 1 h (1 g of zeolite per 50 mL of solution) were 

performed. The ammonium forms were converted into the protonic forms by calcination 

at 450 °C for 4 h in air. The synthesized samples were denoted as: MetalCNT(x)/ZSM-5 

(where Metal= Co, Ni or Mg) for the samples synthesized using metal impregnated 

CNT (x represents the CNT diameter used in the synthesis, i.e. 10-20 or 20-40 nm) and 

CTN(x)/ZSM-5 for the samples synthesized with pure CNT as secondary templates. 

Metal/ZSM-5 stands for the zeolite synthetized without any secondary template and

conventionally impregnated after its synthesis with a metal nitrate followed by the 

nitrate decomposition via calcination in air at 500 °C. 

 

 

 

Catalyst characterization 

The textural properties of the samples were determined by N2 physisorption on a 

Micromeritics ASAP 2000 apparatus. Prior to the analysis, the samples were degassed 

under vacuum (10 µmHg) at 350 °C for 4 h. The total pore volume (TPV) was 

calculated from the amount of vapor adsorbed at a relative pressure P/P0 = 0.97. The 

sample surface area was estimated by the BET method, while the micropore volume 

was calculated using the deBoer t-plot method.  

The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a D8 advance 

diffractometer equipped with an energy dispersive type detector and a monochromatic 

CuK? radiation source. The samples were analyzed using a step of 0.02° with an 

acquisition time of 0.5 s.  

The sample chemical composition was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) 

using a M4 TORNADO (Bruker) spectrometer. This instrument was equipped with 2 

anodes a rhodium X-ray tube 50 kV/600 mA (30 W) and a tungsten X-Ray tube 50 

kV/700 mA (35 W). For sample characterization, the rhodium X-ray tube with a poly-

capillary lens enabling excitation of an area of 200 ?m was utilised. A Silicon-Drift 

Si(Li) detector with Peltier cooling (253°K) and a resolution&amp;lt;145 eV at 100000 cps 

(Mn K?) was used. The measurements were conducted under vacuum (20 mbar). 

Quantitative analysis was carried out using fundamental parameter (FP) (standardless).  



115 

 

The catalyst reducibility was studied using an Autochem II (Micrometrics) 

temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) system. The samples were reduced under a 

flow of 5 % H2 in argon (50 mL/min) and heated up to 800 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min. The 

catalyst Brönsted and Lewis acidities were monitored by infrared spectroscopy (IR) 

with pyridine adsorption. The IR spectra were recorded using a Thermo iS10 

spectrometer (DTGC detector, 64 scans at 4 cm
-1

 resolution). The samples were 

pretreated under vacuum (10
-
5 Torr) at 450 °C for 5 h. After pre-treatment, pyridine 

was adsorbed on the sample and the sample was then heated under vacuum (10
-5

 Torr) 

at 150 °C. The spectra before and after the Py adsorption were collected at ambient 

temperature. The amounts of Brönsted and Lewis acid sites were calculated using the 

intensity of bands at ~1545 cm
-1

 and ~1455 cm
-1

, respectively. The absorption 

coefficients ?(B)=1.08 for Brönsted acid sites (peak at ~1545 cm
-1

) and 

?(L)=1.71 cm mol
-1

 for Lewis acid sites (peaks at ~1455-1445 cm
-1

) were used for 

quantification of the zeolite acid sites. 

The TEM observations of the samples were obtained by using a Jeol 2100F 

instrument operated at 200 kV. Before the analysis, the samples were dispersed by 

ultrasound in ethanol for 5 min, and a drop of the suspension was deposited onto a 

carbon membrane on a 300 mesh copper grid. The STEM-HAADF tomographic 

analysis was carried out on a Jeol 2100F (field emission gun) microscope operating at 

200 kV by using a spot size of 1.1 Å with a current density of 0.5 pA Å
-1

. Selected Area 

Electron Diffraction (SAED) patterns were recorded using a US1000XP CCD camera 

with an exposure time of 2 s on circular areas of 200 nm diameter. 

 

Catalytic tests 



116 

 

Hydrogenation of aromatics: Toluene or triisopropylbenzene hydrogenations 

were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor. The catalyst (50 mg) was loaded in the stainless-

steel reactor and then activated in a H2 gas flow (10 cm
3
/min, atmospheric pressure) at 

400 C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2 °C/min.  The reactor was cooled below to 50 °C, a 

hydrogen flow with a pressure of 20 bar was introduced into the reactor. The 

temperature was raised at 1 °C/min to the required reaction temperature (250 °C). The 

liquid reagents (toluene or triisopropylbenzene) were injected by pump (PHD ULTRA 

4400, Harvard Apparatus) with a flow rate (0.8 mL/h). The products were collected in a 

cold tap and analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Bruker GC-450) equipped with thermal 

conductivity (TCD) and flame ionization (FID) detectors.  

Fischer Tropsch synthesis: the experiments were performed in a fixed-bed 

reactor. Prior to testing, the samples were reduced in situ in pure H2  flow (3 cm
3
/min) at 

400 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 3°C/min. After the reactor was cooled down to 

room temperature, the flow was switched to syngas (H2/CO = 2) and the pressure 

adjusted to 20 bar. Nitrogen (5% relative to CO) was used as the internal standard. After 

achieving the desired pressure, the temperature was increased to the reaction 

temperature, i.e. 250 °C, at a rate of 3 °C/min. The gas space velocities were adjusted to 

obtain CO conversion of 30-40% for all catalysts. The gaseous reaction products, i.e. up 

to C5, were analyzed on-line using a GC equipped with a FID and a TCD detectors 

(Varian, CP-3800). The remaining products (wax) were condensed under pressure and 

analyzed ex situ on a Shimadzu GC with FID (2010-Plus-AF). 

Anisole acylation: the activity of all catalysts was evaluated in the acylation 

reaction between anisole and hexanoic acid according to the following protocol. The 

catalyst (20 mg) was added to a mixture of anisole (2 g) and hexanoic acid (0.3 g) in a 



117 

 

reflux reactor system. Upon sealing, the tube was heated at 180 °C for 2 h. The products 

were analyzed by gas chromatography. 

 

5.3 Results and Discussion  

The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms for the catalysts prepared by 

impregnation and synthesized using the Me/CNT templates are shown in Figure 5-1.

The ZSM-5 sample displays a type-I isotherm exhibiting a sharp uptake at low 

relative pressure followed by a plateau with a hardly visible hysteresis at P/P0&gt;0.5. This 

type of isotherm is usually observed for microporous materials with textural 

mesoporosity generated by aggregation of small zeolite crystallites. Similar isotherms

shapes were observed for the CNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 samples 

synthetized using pure CNT as secondary hard templates (Figure 5-1a). Table 5-1 shows 

that the addition of pure CNT(10-20) during the ZSM-5 zeolite synthesis results in a slight 

increase in the BET surface area and pore volume. The use of CNT(20-40) during the 

ZSM-5 zeolite synthesis did not change substantially the porous characteristics of the 

zeolite.

The introduction of metals (Co, Mg, Ni) to the zeolite synthesis gel, without 

using CNT as a secondary template, has only a minor effect on the zeolite porosity and 

specific surface area resulting in a decrease in the zeolite pore volume and specific 

surface area (Table 5-1). The difference between the surface area and pore volume of 

the parent zeolite and its counterparts containing metals may be assigned to both, the 

effect of zeolite “dilution” by metals and partial pore blocking by the metal species. 

Only the microporous zeolite volume is affected by impregnation with metals in 

Co/ZSM-5, Ni/ZSM-5 and Mg/ZSM-5 as compared to the parent ZSM-5 zeolite, while 



119 

 

almost no changes are observed in the mesoporous volume. This fact indicates that the 

metal cations are preferentially located in the zeolite micropores, whereas the major part 

of the metal species, e.g. metal oxides, in the case of ZSM-5 is located on the zeolite 

external surface. 

Remarkably, rather different isotherms and textural properties were observed for 

the ZSM-5 zeolites synthetized in the presence of Me/CNT templates. The zeolites 

prepared in the presence of Co/CNT, Ni/CNT and Mg/CNT templates exhibit a 

combination of type I and IV isotherms with a significant N2 uptake at low relative 

pressure and a hysteresis loop at high relative pressure (P/P0 &gt; 0.5, Figure 5-1b-d). 

Adsorption of nitrogen in the range of P/P0 = 0.5 - 1.0 and relevant hysteresis can be 

explained by mesoporosity developed by the presence of cobalt, nickel or magnesium 

oxides supported on CNT. Note that almost no increase in the zeolite mesoporosoity 

was observed when pure CNT(10-20) or CNT(20-40) were used as mesoporous hard 

templates (Table 5-1). Importantly, the presence of metal species on CNT is essential 

for the synthesis of ZSM-5 zeolite with enhanced mesoporous volume. A slight increase 

in the BET surface area was also observed for CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5, NiCNT(10-20)/ZSM-

5 and MgCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5, while the BET surface area slightly decreases when using 

the Me/CNT(20-40) templates. Thus, the most significant effect of using CNT containing 

cobalt, nickel and magnesium is the substantial increase in the mesoporous volume.  

The zeolite mesoporous volume increases 2.5-4 times, when using CoCNT(10-20) and 

Co/CNT(20-40), 4.5-5 times, when using  MgCNT(10-20) and MgCNT(20-40) and 2.2-3 times 



120 

 

for NiCNT(10-20) and NiCNT(20-40) (Table 5-1). Note that the zeolite micropore volume 

(between 0.09-0.13 cm
3
/g) is only slightly affected by CNT supported metals used as 

secondary templates.  

Figure 5-2 displays XRD patterns of all samples included in the present study. 

The characteitic XRD peaks of the MFI structure are observed in all samples, regardless 

of the employed synthesis procedure. No halo peaks, which can be attributed to the 

amorphous phase, have been observed. Note that the presence of metals in the catalysts 

leads to somewhat lower intensity of the zeolite XRD patterns, which is due to the 

dilution of the MFI phase with the metal oxides. In the Co/ZSM-5, CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 

or CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 samples a peak at 36.9 ° which is characteritic to the Co3O4 can 

be observed. The particle size of Co3O4 calculated using the Scherrer equation (Table 5-

1) was 27-44 nm. Such large size suggests that the main fraction of cobalt oxide is 

located either in large mesopores or on the zeolite external surface. The Ni/ZSM-5 

catalyst prepared using impregnation with nickel nitrate showed a very low intense 

XRD peaks at 43.2° attributed to the face-centered cubic phase NiO (JCPDS card no. 

#47-1049). The Ni/CNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 or Ni/CNT(20-40)/ZSM- catalysts prepared using 

Ni/CNT(10-20) and Ni/CNT(20-40) as hard templates did not show any peaks characteristic 

of the nickel oxide phases. No XRD peaks assigned to the Mg-containing phases were 

detected in either Mg/ZSM-5 prepared via aqueous impregnation or in MgCNT(10-

20)/ZSM-5 and MgCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 catalysts prepared using hydrothermal synthesis 

with the Mg/CNT hard template. The absence of XRD peaks attributed to the metal 



121 

 

oxide phases can be explained by smaller metal oxide particle size in the Mg- and Ni-

containing samples, which are below the XRD detection limits. 

 

Figure 5-2 XRD patterns of the metal ZSM-5 catalysts. 

Figure 5-3 shows the TEM images of the Co, Ni and Mg containing ZSM-5 

catalysts prepared using metal-CNT templates. They are very different from those 

usually observed for the conventional ZSM-5 zeolite. The zeolite crystallites obtained in 

the presence of metal CNT templates exhibit a rather irregular fibrous shape leading to 

the development of zeolite mesoporosity. TEM images suggest zeolite crystallization 

over CNT. This shape arises from CNT partially encapsulated inside the zeolite crystals 

during the zeolite synthesis. The synthesized zeolite seems to replicas of Me/CNT. They 

reproduce almost exactly the shape of the secondary templates. Importantly, the 

presence of metal containing CNT seems indispensable for obtaining these fibrous

The presence of zeolite phase in these fibrous structures was further confirmed 

by selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Figure 5-4 displays well defined 

diffraction patterns and clearly indicates zeolite crystalline phase in the areas containing 

a larger quantify of fibrous zeolite replicas of the Me/CNT templates.

STEM-HAADF electron tomography of the CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 sample has 

confirmed localization of metal oxide nanoparticles within the zeolite (Figure 5-5). Co 

nanoparticles have been observed as bright spots with diameter in the range 2-5 nm. 

STEM-HAADF images show that nanoparticles are located inside the pores of 

CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-zeolite. Thus, electron microscopy, electron diffraction and 

tomography in combination with other characterization techniques revealed the 

important role of small metal oxide clusters in CNT for the formation of mesopores in 

zeolite crystals. Note that no noticeable enhancement of the zeolite mesoporosity was 

observed by using metal-free CNT as secondary templates (Table 5-1).

The ZSM-5 zeolite nucleation seems to occur on the metal oxide sites located on 

CNT and results in the hierarchical zeolites with enhanced mesoporosity. The resulting 

zeolite replicates the fibrous shape of CNT. The mesopores are created when CNT are 

removed from the zeolite by calcination. A scheme illustrating the formation of 

hierarchical zeolite during the synthesis utilizing Me/CNT as secondary hard templates 

is shown in Figure 5-6. It is important to emphasize that the stability of metal oxide 

nanoparticles supported on CNT in the basic medium used for zeolite synthesis is 

essential for obtaining hierarchical zeolites with enhanced mesoporosity. Our 

experiments with templates on the basis of iron and copper oxides supported on CNT

did not result in the zeolites with enhanced mesoporosity. This seems to be a 

consequence of the dissolution of iron and copper oxides in basic medium during zeolite 

synthesis.

Cobalt and nickel temperature programed reduction (TPR) profiles are presented 

in Figure 5-7. The reduction patterns of the cobalt zeolite catalysts are consistent with 

the presence of several types of cobalt species and two-step Co3O4 reduction to metallic 

cobalt. Previous reports 
[27-29]

 suggest that Co3O4 is first reduced to CoO at a lower 

temperature, whereas CoO is reduced to metallic Co at higher temperatures (Figure 

5-7a). The Co/ZSM-5 sample with cobalt added by impregnation exhibits a TPR peak at 

280°C with shoulders at 150-220 °C. The shoulders at 150-220 °C in the TPR profile of 

Co/ZSM-5 can be therefore attributed to the reduction of the Co3O4 nanoparticles to 

CoO, while the major TPR peak at 280°C corresponds to the reduction of CoO to 

metallic cobalt. Previously we showed that the ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by 

impregnation contained a large fraction of cobalt oxide nanoparticles on the zeolite 

outer surface. Because of a larger solvating shell, diffusion of multi-charged ions such 

as cobalt or nickel, inside the ZSM-5 micropores can be rather slow

prepared by impregnation, a considerable amount of bivalent metal ions are present on 

the zeolite external surface. The CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 samples 

exhibited two groups of TPR peaks at 150-420 °C and at 600 – 800 °C. Similar to the 

Co/ZSM-5 zeolite, the low temperature peaks are attributed to the reduction of small 

Co3O4 nanoparticles to metallic cobalt via intermediate formation of CoO.  The shift of 

these peaks to higher temperature can be explained by smaller Co3O4 particle sizes 
[31]

 

and their localization inside the zeolite meso- and micropores. In agreement with 

previous studies 
[32, 33]

, the peaks at higher temperature are assigned to cobalt silicates or 

aluminates. These mixed compounds form because of the interaction and chemical 

reactions between the small metal oxide nanoparticles located on CNT and zeolite 

synthetized under the hydrothermal conditions. The TPR data are consistent with the 

suggestions that cobalt species supported on CNT act as nucleation sites in the synthesis 

of the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite.

The reduction profiles of the nickel catalysts prepared by impregnation with 

nickel nitrate and synthetized using Ni/CNT as secondary templates are shown in Figure 

5-7b. They exhibit broad hydrogen consumption peaks in the temperature range from 

350 to 750°C. A single hydrogen consumption peak at about 400°C 
[34, 35]

 is usually 

observed in the TPR profile of bulk NiO. It corresponds to the reduction of NiO to 

metallic nickel. Thus, the low temperature peaks located between 400 and 500°C in the 

TPR profiles of nickel-zeolite catalysts may correspond to the reduction of small NiO 

particles. Note that the Ni/ZSM-5 zeolite prepared by impregnation usually contains a 

significant concentration of NiO on the zeolite outer surface. These NiO nanoparticles 

are detected in Ni/ZSM-5 by XRD (Figure 5-2). Similar to cobalt zeolite 

nanocomposites, the shift of the TPR peaks to a higher temperature can be due to the 

smaller NiO particle size and some diffusional limitations during their reduction arising 

from the localization of these small NiO nanoparticles in the porous material 
[36]

. The 

area of the low temperature TPR peaks between 400° and 500 °C significantly decreases 

for the catalysts prepared using Ni/CNT as secondary templates. This corresponds to the 

decrease in the concentration of the NiO particles on the zeolite outer surface.  The TPR 

profiles of the NiCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and NiCNT(20-40)CNT/ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit low 

intensity peaks at 500-700 °C. High temperature TPR peaks can be attributed to the 

reduction of highly dispersed nickel species 
[37]

 or to the presence of nickel silicate 

(phyllosilicate) species

. In agreement with other characterization methods, the 

TPR results clearly show that introduction of nickel and cobalt species with CNT during 

the zeolite hydrothermal synthesis results to higher metal dispersion. In cobalt catalysts, 

metal nanoparticle localization within zeolite meso- and micropores also leads to the 

formation of mixed compounds between metal oxide, silica or alumina.

The acidity of the metal-zeolite catalysts has been characterized by FTIR using 

adsorption of pyridine (Py) as a probe for Brönsted (BAS) and Lewis acid sites (LAS). 

The FTIR spectra recorded after Py adsorption on the reduced catalysts are displayed in 

Figure 5-8. The pure ZSM-5 zeolite exhibits characteristic bands at ~1545 and 1455-45 

cm

 assigned to the pyridinum ion (PyH

) formed on BAS and to Py adsorbed on LAS 

(which may also include metal ions such as Co
2+

, Ni
2+

 or Mg
2+

), respectively. Py 

adsorbed on both the LAS and BAS also displays a band at 1490 cm
-1

. The 

concentrations of BAS and LAS calculated using the molar absorption coefficients for 

the bands at ~1545 and 1455-45 cm

 are shown in Table 5-1. Impregnation of the ZSM-

5 zeolite with Co
2+

, Ni

 and Mg
2+

 cations leads to a significant decrease in the 

concentration of BAS. The effect is more pronounced for the Mg
2+

 impregnated ZSM-5. 

A much lower concentration of BAS in the impregnated catalysts can be explained by 

the ion exchange of the zeolite bridging OH group protons with the Mg
2+

, Ni
2+

 and Co
2+

 

ions. Small metal oxide clusters can also block some zeolite microporesthus making 

some of BAS inaccessible for Py adsorption. Interestingly, at the same metal content in 

the zeolites, the decrease in the concentration of BAS is less significant, when the 

cations are introduced with the Me/CNT hard templates. This suggests that a significant 

fraction of the metal species added with Me/CNT are probably not localized in the 

cationic zeolite sites but present as small oxide clusters in the zeolite micro- and 

mesopores. This explain a less significant decrease in the number of BAS in the zeolites 

synthetized using the Me/CNT hard templates with the same metal contents.

The number of LAS is considerably higher in all metal containing ZSM-5 as 

compared to their metal-free ZSM-5 counterpart (Table 5-1). The addition of the metals 

results in the generation of news types of Lewis acid sites such as coordinatively 

unsaturated Co
2+

, Ni
2+

 or Mg
2+

 cations.  Some of these cations can occupy zeolite 

cationic sites. Interestingly, a much lower concentration of Lewis acid sites is generated 

in the metal zeolite catalysts prepared using zeolite crystallization in the presence of 

metal CNT secondary templates as compared to the sample prepared by zeolite 

impregnation with nitrates. This can be due to a lower concentration of Co
2+

, Ni
2+

 and 

Mg
2+

 in the cationic sites of the hierarchical zeolites. This also indicates the formation 

of metal oxide clusters and is consistent with a smaller decrease in the number of BAS 

in the zeolites prepared using the Me/CNT hard templates.

Catalytic Performance in Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis, Hydrogenation and Acylation 

Reactions 

The results of catalytic tests of cobalt zeolite catalysts in Fischer-Tropsch 

synthesis are presented in Table 5-2. Hydrocarbons and water were major reaction 

products of carbon monoxide hydrogenation. Extremely small amounts of CO2 were 

observed. By varying GHSV between 20 and 70 L/hgCo, the CO conversion of 30 – 40% 

was obtained for all catalysts. The reaction rate normalized by the amount of cobalt in 

the catalysts slightly increases for CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and decreases in CoCNT(20-

40)/ZSM-5 compared to the Co/ZSM-5 sample prepared by conventional impregnation.  

Note however, that TPR (Figure 5-7a) is indicative of very different cobalt reducibility 

in different samples. The addition of the Co/CNT hard templates during the zeolite 

synthesis results in the formation of barely reducible cobalt silicate or cobalt aluminate 

species, which exhibit TPR peaks at 800-900°C. The peaks at 800-900°C are absent in 

the TPR profiles of Co/ZSM-5. This suggests a low concentration of cobalt silicates or 

aluminates in the Co/ZSM-5 catalyst prepared by impregnation.  Interestingly, the 

activity per reducible cobalt increased 5 – 10 times over CoCNT/ZSM-5 prepared using 

CoCNT as secondary templates in comparison with Co/ZSM-5 prepared by 

impregnation. The methane selectivity varied between 13 – 37%. Previous report 
[40]

 

suggests that the higher methane selectivity over zeolite based catalysts can be due to 

more significant diffusion limitations for carbon monoxide molecules compared to 

hydrogen.  Slower diffusion of CO relative to hydrogen results in the CO deficiency the 

zeolite pores. The resulting higher H2/CO ratio in the narrow zeolite pores leads to a 

higher contribution of methanation reaction and higher methane selectivity.  

Importantly, lower methane selectivity was observed over CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and 

CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 with larger mesoporous volume. These catalysts may have less 



131 

 

significant diffusion limitations compared to mostly microporous Co/ZSM-5, where 

cobalt was added by impregnation. The catalysts prepared using the CoCN5(10-20) and 

CoCNT(20-40) hard templates also exhibit a higher selectivity to the C5
+
 products (around 

74%) as compared to the conventional Co/ZSM-5 catalysts which exhibited C5+ 

selectivity of 48% (Table 5-2).

Nickel catalysts were tested in the toluene and 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene 

hydrogenation (Table 5-2). These reactions were used to evaluate the activity and 

accessibility of nickel metal sites in the hierarchical zeolites. The mesoporosity 

developed in the nickel-zeolite catalysts synthetized in the presence of Ni/CNT 

secondary templates results in a significantly higher hydrogenation rate in both toluene 

and 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene reactions. The reaction rate increases in the order: 

Ni/SZM-5&amp;lt;NiCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5&lt;NiCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5. This is therefore indicative of a 

better nickel dispersion and enhanced accessibility of nickel metallic sites in the zeolites 

prepared using the Ni/CNT hard templates. Noteworthy, the zeolite prepared using 

NiCNT(20-40) with larger CNT diameter exhibited higher reaction rate in both toluene 

and 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene hydrogenation reactions.

Zeolites usually contain significant concentration of acid sites. Acylation of 

anisole with hexanoic acid was selected as a model reaction to characterize the catalytic 

performance of the acid sites on the outer surface and in the mesopores of the 

hierarchical zeolites (Figure 5-9).  

 

Figure 5-9 Acylation of anisole with hexanoic acid results in ortho-methoxy-hexyl-

phenone. 

 

On all catalysts evaluated in the present work, the reaction results in the 

formation of ortho-methoxy-hexyl-phenone with the selectivity higher than 90%, while 

the selectivity to the para-isomer was less than 10%. Only traces of the meta-isomer 

were detected.  Note that the size of the ortho-isomer is much higher than the dimeter of 

micropores in the ZSM-5 zeolite. Higher selectivity to the larger size ortho- methoxy-

hexyl-phenone is consistent with the critical role of the zeolite acid sites on the zeolite 

outer surface and mesopores in this reaction. The hexanoic acid conversion and reaction 

rate are displayed in Table 5-4. For all catalysts, the conversion increases, when 

Me/CNTs were added as hard templates during the zeolite synthesis. The conversion

increases 2-4 times over CoCNT(10-20)/ZSM-5 and CoCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5; 1.3-1.6 times

20)/ZSM-5 and MgCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5 in comparison with their counterparts prepared via 

impregnation. The effect is more pronounced when CNT had a relatively large (20-

40 nm) diameter. The highest conversion was achieved over NiCNT(20-40)/ZSM-5.

Figure 5-10 shows the relation between the conversion of hexanoic acid and the 

number of Brönsted acid sites in the catalysts. Both the concentration of Brönsted acid 

sites and the presence of mesopores created in the ZSM-5 zeolite in the presence of 

metal supported CNT affect the catalytic performance in the anisole acylation. 

Interestingly, at similar concentration of BAS, the higher acylation rates were observed 

for the catalysts with higher mesoporosity. In particular, the CNT diameter is important 

for preparing the metal zeolite catalysts with higher reaction rates. The zeolites with 

larger mesopores obtained using Me/CNT with the diameter of 20-40 nm were the most 

active in this reaction. This suggests a better accessibility of both Brönsted and metal 

sites in the hierarchical ZSM-5 prepared using the Me/CNT templates. Hence, the 



134 

 

strategy for synthesis of hierarchical zeolites using metal supported CNT as secondary 

hard templates seems promising. It produces hierarchical zeolites replicating the shape 

of CNT with enhanced mesoporosity and containing highly dispersed, accessible and 

uniformly distributed metal and acid sites, which will be certainly beneficial for several 

important catalytic reactions.

catalysts prepared by impregnation and using Me/CNT as secondary hard templates. 

 

5.3 Conclusion  

A new synthesis strategy for the preparation of hierarchical zeolites preparation 

has been developed. The zeolite crystallites were prepared under hydrothermal 

conditions in the presence of CNT supported metal nanoparticles used as secondary 

hard templates. The Me/CNT templates play three roles in the synthesis of hierarchical 

zeolite. These templates are at the same time (i) a zeolite synthesis replica, (ii) a 

mesoporogen and (a) a tool to introduce uniformly distributed metal species into 

zeolites. 



135 

 

The metal oxide species seem to be nucleation sites and crystallization modifier 

leading to the fibrous zeolite structures, which largely replicates the CNT. Using 

Me/CNT as templates leads a several-fold increase in the zeolite mesoporous volume. In 

the synthetized zeolites, the dispersed metal species are uniformly distributed within the 

crystallites and mostly present as small metal oxide nanoparticles. The concentration of 

Brönsted acid sites in the zeolites synthetized using Me/CNT as secondary templates is 

higher than in the zeolites with the same amount of metal species prepared via 

impregnation.  

Because of a decrease in the diffusion limitations and uniform distribution of 

metal nanoparticles in the zeolite, the resulting materials have shown improved catalytic 

performance in three catalytic reactions: Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydrogenation of 

aromatics and anisole acylation.

Chapter 6: General Conclusion and Perspectives 

This thesis was performed at “Unité de catalyse et de chimie du solide” (UCCS), 

University of Lille, France, and in the Department of Chemical Engineering, Federal 

University of Rio Grando Do Sul, Brazil in 2016-2019. The main objective of this Ph. 

D. thesis was to design bifunctional catalysts on the basis of metal nanoparticles and 

mesoporous zeolites with the target to enhance their catalytic performance in different 

reactions such as Fischer Tropsch synthesis, toluene and 1, 3, 5 triisoproplybenzene 

hydrogenation and acylation of anisole. The work followed three parallel and 

complementary paths. The first one (Chapter 3) is centered on the study of influence of 

impregnation and ion exchange sequence, in particular on the metal localization, acidity 

of cobalt supported on the large pore BEA zeolite. The second (Chapter 4) is focused on 

the production of iso-paraffins from syngas, more specifically by creating hierarchical 

ZSM-5 zeolite using cobalt CNT as sacrificial template. The third (Chapter 5) is aimed 

on mesoporosity creation of ZSM-5 using different metals like nickel and magnesium 

supported on CNT. 

  

6.1 General Conclusion 

In chapter III, four different catalysts prepared using different ion exchange 

sequence were synthesized: Co/HBEA, CoH/HBEA, Co/NaBEA, CoH/NaBEA. Cobalt 

impregnation on the H-from of BEA results in cobalt localization on the outer surface 

and in the zeolite micropores. The deposition of cobalt on the BEA zeolite external 

surface and in the micropores leads to cracking and higher methane selectivities in FT 

synthesis. The catalyst CoH/NaBEA with the Co species localized on the external 

surface and high concentration of Br?nsted acid sites in the zeolite micropores, showed 



142 

 

lower methane selectivity, higher selectivity to long chain hydrocarbons and significant 

yield of isomerized hydrocarbons. This strategy seems to have several advantages for 

the design of bifunctional catalysts over large pore zeolites.  

In chapter IV, the use of the bifunctional Co/ZSM-5 catalysts enhanced the iso-

paraffin selectivity in FT synthesis. This improvement can be attributed by creation of 

the mesopores in the ZSM-5 zeolite using metal-CNT as templates. The mesoporosity 

increased 3-4 times by introducing Co/CNT during the zeolite synthesis. Besides that, 

when cobalt was impregnated in the CNT and then placed in the synthesis gel, the 

resulting zeolite had higher amount of Brönsted acid sites. This methodology leads to 

more uniform metal distribution on the support and greater proximity between active 

metal sites and acid sites from the zeolite. The catalysts prepared using Co/CNT as 

secondary templates presented an enhanced selectivity to isomerized branched 

hydrocarbons and lower methane selectivity. 

In chapter V, the methodology used to create hierarchical zeolite with metal 

CNT was extended to other metals like Ni and Mg. The deposed metal particles have 

uniform distribution in the crystallites of hierarchical zeolites. Important roles of the 

metal carbon nanotubes in the zeolite synthesis are uncovered. First, Me/CNT serve as a 

replica to create zeolites with specific fibrous morphology. Second, they fulfill the role 

of a mesoporogen and markedly increase the zeolite secondary porosity. Finally, they 

act as a vehicle to uniformly introduce the metal functions inside the mesoporous 

zeolites. The presence of metals in carbon nanotubes is essential for the enhancement of 

mesoporosity. 

This thesis clearly shows that the catalytic performance of metal zeolite composite 

catalysts is a function of zeolite mesoporososity, zeolite pore sizes, zeolite acidity and

localization of metal nanoparticles on the zeolite outer surface or in the zeolite 

micropores. Because of the decrease in the diffusion limitations and uniform 

distribution of metal nanoparticles in the zeolite, the resulting materials have shown 

improved catalytic performance in three catalytic reactions: Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, 

hydrogenation of aromatics and anisole acylation. 

 

6.2 Perspectives 

Thus, efficient control of localization of metal and acid sites within metal zeolite 

composite catalysts is a very useful tool to tune the catalytic performance for many 

catalytic reactions. The results of this thesis allow us to propose new strategies for the 

design of bifunctional catalysts. In particular, two new methodologies can be further 

developed such as  

- Introducing one metal inside the CNT and another metal outside the CNT when 

using Me/CNT as templates for zeolite synthesis. This strategy should reduce formation 

of barely reducible metal silicates with the metal species which are located inside CNT; 

- Microemulsion methodology which might control the size of metal nanoparticles 

deposed inside the micro and mesopores of zeolite and 

- Catalyst deactivation is a major challenge for the design of bifunctional 

catalysts. Though the catalysts developed in these work were stable in lab scale 

experiments, further long duration tests are required to evaluate their stability under 

industrial conditions.
