ABSTRACT 

 

Substantial natural gas quantities have been found in the northern and western area of 

Pennsylvania, raising economic, social and political incentives to keep this gas within the United 

States and to find alternative uses of it besides combustion for energy production. After taking into 

consideration different possible value added products and production routes, the aim of this project 

was defined as simulate and design a production process of polymer grade ethylene and propylene 

from natural gas via methanol-to-olefins route. The overall process consists of three steps: natural 

gas reforming, methanol synthesis and olefins production. The first step is contracted out, while 

the other two steps occur on-site. Synthesis gas from natural gas reforming reacts over 

Cu-ZnO-Al2O3-12.5% CNTs catalyst under 428 ºF and 725 psia to produce methanol with 64% 

conversion and approximately 100% selectivity. Then, methanol reacts over H-SAPO-34 catalysts 

under 710 ºF and 23.9 psia to produce olefins, leading to 98% conversion and a combined 

selectivity of ethylene and propylene of 80%. Production rate of 1.6 million lbs/day of propylene 

and 1.1 million lbs/day of ethylene are found to be achievable. The economic feasibility of the 

design is evaluated and has a total capital investment of $ 343 million. The minimum selling prices 

of ethylene and propylene are calculated to be $ 0.56/lb and $ 0.52/lb, respectively, which undercut 

current market prices, $ 0.65/lb of ethylene and $ 0.61/lb of propylene. 

 

Keywords: Ethylene, propylene, natural gas, feasibility study.

RESUMO 

 

Quantidades consideráveis de gás natural foram recentemente encontradas nas regiões norte 

e oeste da Pensilvânia, aumentndo os incentivos econômicos, sociais e políticos para manter este 

gás natural nos Estados Unidos, bem como encontrar alternativas para seu uso que não somente a 

sua queima para geração de energia. Após considerar diferentes possíveis produtos e rotas de 

produção, definiu-se o objetivo deste trabalho como sendo simular e projetar uma planta para 

produção de etileno e propileno a partir do gás natural através da rota metanol a olefinas. Este 

processo é dividido em três passos: reforma do gás natural, síntese de metanol e posterior conversão 

a olefinas. Decidiu-se que a reforma do gás seria contratada. O gás de síntese da reforma do gás 

natural é então reagido sobre catalisadores Cu-ZnO-Al2O3-12.5% CNTs a temperatura e pressão de 

428 ºF e 725 psia, apresentando conversão de 64% e seletividade de aproximadamente 100% para 

formar metanol. O metanol, então, reage sobre catalisadores H-SAPO-34 a 710 ºF e 23.9 psia com 

conversão de 98%, levando a uma seletividade combinada de etileno e propileno de 80%. Uma 

planta para produção de 1.1 milhão lbs/dia de etileno e 1.6 milhão lbs/dia de propileno é projetada. 

A análise econômica da planta estima um investimento inicial necessário de $ 343 milhões. Os 

preços mínimos de venda calculados são de $ 0.56/lb de etileno e $ 0.52/lb de propileno, abaixo de 

seus respectivos preços atuais de $ 0.65/lb de etileno e $ 0.61/lb de propileno.

1  INTRODUCTION 
 

The United States has abundant natural gas reserves, and recent developments in drilling 

technology have made it possible to extract this gas in large quantities. This is especially relevant 

in the northern and western area of Pennsylvania, where regions with substantial gas quantities 

have been found [1]. This new abundance of natural gas has raised economic, social and political 

incentives to keep this natural gas within the United States boundaries and find alternative uses 

besides combustion for energy production only. 

The economic incentive is that the technology exists to convert natural gas into chemical 

products worth more than the value of the energy obtained from the gas. The profitability of these 

processes is increasing due to recent groundbreaking technologies, such as the discovery of 

efficient catalysts and processes to treat natural gas [2]. The social incentive is that, using natural 

gas as a feedstock to replace oil derived feedstock, the amount of toxins released into the 

environment would be reduced. Natural gas processing does not release dangerous byproducts such 

as benzene, coke or hydrogen fluoride unlike the oil refining processes do. The communities 

located near these potential new sites would not have to worry about dangerous chemicals released 

in the air. The political incentives to retain the natural gas locally and find new ways of processing 

it are based on the desire to rejuvenate the stagnant manufacturing industry in the United States, 

more specifically in Pennsylvania, as well as the willingness of the current political administration 

to financially support developing new manufacturing technologies [3]. Therefore, promising 

success in the field of natural gas conversion technologies could be eligible for government 

funding.   

Given these incentives to look for alternative technologies to process natural gas, this report 

will determine the feasibility of producing a value-added product from natural gas. More 

specifically, in this report the following questions will be addressed:  

x What value-added product is to be produced from natural gas and what chemical 

scheme should be used to obtain it? 

x Is the proposed process technically and economically feasible to obtain the selected 

product from natural gas? 



15 
 

Additionally, considerations in this report will include the determination of an input/output 

structure, as well as a recycle and separation structures to achieve the desired purities for the 

intermediates and final products of the proposed process.  

The remaining content of this report is organized as follows. First, the background provides 

justification for the chosen product as well for the chemical scheme to obtain it from natural gas. 

The main body sections, the conceptual and final designs, and the NPV analysis provide the 

description and economic assessment of the proposed process design. Finally, in the conclusions 

section, the key findings to the overall investigation are provided, according to the goals outlined 

above.  



16 
 

2 BACKGROUND 
 

Before a final design to produce a value added product from natural gas is implemented, 

base technical information needs to be obtained. Information is gathered and decisions are made in 

regard to three main areas:  

x Choice of product based on a market analysis 

x Choice of chemical production route based on analysis of available options 

x Technical information about the selected reaction pathway 

2.1 Market Analysis 
 

Before a value added product from shale gas is chosen, several possible options are 

examined. Some of the potential choices include: 

x Propanol  

x Isopropanol 

x Butanol?  

x Acetone 

x Propylene glycol 

x Polyhydroxyalkanoate 

x Propylene 

Table 2.1 shows the approximated annual global demand for each of these chemicals. 

Table 2.1 - Global market demand for potential produced chemicals. 

Chemical Global market demand 
(billion lbs/year) 

Propanol [4] 0.31 
Isopropanol [5] 4.90 
Butanol [6] 10.00 
Acetone [7] 12.00 
Propylene glycol [8] 3.50 
Polyhydroxyalkanoate [9] 0.02 
Propylene [10] 192.00 

 



17 
 

From this list of seven possible chemicals, propylene is chosen as the product to move 

forward with. The major benefit of propylene is the high global demand. Propylene’s global market 

size is 192 billion lbs/year and demand is expected to increase to over 286 billion lbs/year in the 

next decade [10]. The huge current demand for propylene, along the expected growth of the market, 

allows us to open a large-scale plant without saturating the market and driving down prices to an 

unprofitable level. An additional benefit of the propylene market is the wide range of end products. 

This protects us against the possibility that a market shrinks because there are so many other 

markets to make up for lost demand. End products of propylene derivatives include, but are not 

limited to [11]: 

x Automotive plastics 

x Injection molded plastics- bottle caps, toys, etc. 

x Films and labels 

x Fibers- carpets, clothing, rope 

x Foams 

 

2.2 Chemical Route 
 

After the selection of a product, three possible chemical routes are assessed before one final 

route is selected. The three potential routes are oxidative coupling of methane, methanol to olefins, 

and monohalogenation.  

 

2.2.1 Route 1 – Oxidative Coupling 
 

The first route for the transformation of methane to propylene is an oxidative coupling of 

methane to ethylene using a solid Ca/Sr nanowire catalyst. This reaction proceeds by the following 

stoichiometry:  

2CH4 + O2 ? C2H4 + 2H2O 

This step has a methane conversion of 6% and ethylene selectivity of 40%. Additional 

methane then reacts with the ethylene to form propylene [12]. 



18 
 

C2H4 + CH4 ? C3H6 + H2 

Methane and ethylene react over catalyst SAPO-34, yielding a maximum conversion of 

71.2% and propylene selectivity of 73.3% at 840 °F [13].  

 

2.2.2 Route 2 – Methanol to Olefins (MTO) 
 

The second viable route is the methanol to olefin (MTO) process. This reaction converts 

methane to synthesis gas (syngas), which is converted to methanol and finally propylene. Since the 

overall objective of this project is to design a new value-added chemical production process, the 

well kwon syngas production process, the steam reforming, is decided to be contracted out to an 

outside company. 

In the next step, methanol is produced from syngas according to the following 

stoichiometry.  

CO + 2H2 ? CH3OH 

CO2 + 3H2 ? CH3OH + H2O 

This reaction takes place using a mixture of copper zinc oxide, and alumina as a catalyst. 

Even though carbon dioxide is indispensable for the conversion of the syngas, its conversion is 

quite low [14]. For this reason, the conversion of carbon dioxide will be considered zero. At the 

optimal conditions of 428 ºF and 725 psia, carbon monoxide can achieve conversion up to 64% 

and a selectivity of approximately 100% [14]. 

The third step is the methanol to olefins (MTO) process. This process reacts methanol over 

zeolite catalyst called H-SAPO-34 to produce mostly olefins and water. The reaction can be 

performed under high temperature and low pressures to enhance the production of light olefins. 

The conversion takes place through a complex network of chemical reaction not fully understood 

so far, so stoichiometry and kinetic modelling are not well defined yet. The highest yield of 

propylene occurs at 710 ºF and 23.9 psia. At these operational conditions, the conversion of 

methanol is 98% and the percent yields of propylene, ethylene, butylene, butane, and dimethyl 

ether are 46.5%, 33.5%, 8.5%, 9.5% and 2% in mass respectively [15].  

 



19 
 

2.2.3 Route 3 – Monohalogenation  
 

The final potential chemical route is a two-step mechanism that converts methane to 

propylene via monobromomethane.  

2CH4 + 2HBr + O2 ? 2CH3Br + 2H2O 

3CH3Br ? C3H6 + 3HBr 

The first step uses a CeO2 catalyst and occurs at 1040 ºF. These conditions lead to a 16% 

conversion and 74% selectivity to methyl bromide. The second step is performed at 751 ºF with 

ZSM-5 as a catalyst. The conversion of this step is 95% and the selectivity is 56% to propylene 

[16].  

 

2.2.4 Route Selection 
 

Tables 2.2 and 2.3 compare the conversions and selectivities of the 3 different routes being 

considered. 

Table 2.2 - Comparison of conversions to propylene for each route. 

Step Route 1 [12] [13] Route 2 [14][15] Route 3 [16] 

1 6.0% Contracted Out 16.0% 

2 71.2% 64.0% 95.0% 

3 - 98.0% - 

OVERALL 4.3% 62.7% 15.2% 
 

Table 2.3 - Comparison of selectivities to propylene for each route. 

Step Route 1 [12] [13] Route 2 [14][15] Route 3 [16] 

1 40.0% Contracted Out 74.0% 

2 73.3% 100.0% 56.0% 

3  46.5%  
 



20 
 

Of the three options, route 2 (methanol-to-olefins) is decided to be the best option to proceed 

with due to the fact that it has the highest overall conversion and selectivity to propylene. Besides 

that, step 3 of route 2 produces ethylene as a co-product with a selectivity of 33.5% and it can also 

be sold as a value-added chemical, summing up the selectivity of desired products to 80%. 

 

2.3 Technical Information 
 

Before a final design is completed, base technical information is needed. This information 

is background knowledge of reaction stoichiometry, along with the corresponding conversion and 

selectivity, operating conditions, toxicity, and costs.  

 

2.3.1 Conversion Steps and Operating Conditions  
 

The selected method for production of propylene from methane is the MTO (methanol to 

olefins) process. This process has three steps: conversion of methane synthesis gas (syngas), 

conversion of syngas to methanol, and conversion of methanol to propylene. The reaction 

conditions for each of the steps is given in Table 2.4.

Each step has different operating conditions, which are summarized in Table 2.5.

This information is essential for designing the reactors because it specifies feed conditions. 

Additionally, space time can be possibly used calculate the size of the reactor needed to achieve 

the desired conversions.  

 

2.3.2 Purity 
 

Several different purity levels are possible for propylene production: polymer grade, 

chemical grade, and refinery grade [11]. Because much of the propylene demand is used for 

polypropylene production, polymer grade product 99.5% in mol is desired.   

A secondary byproduct of the reaction is ethylene, which has similar purity options as 

propylene. Due to same reasoning, polymer grade ethylene is decide to be a secondary product.  

This ethylene is 99.9% in mol pure [17]. 

 

2.3.3 Production Rate  
 

The desired production rate of propylene is chosen based on availability of feedstock and 

feasibility of large-scale propylene production. It was decided that the amount of natural gas to be 

processed would be the maximum the contracted out company could process. As informed in the 

syngas contract, found in Attachment A, this value correspond to 0.8% of the gas extracted from 



22 
 

the Marcellus Shale formation, which leads to a natural gas input of 83.2 MMcfd [18]. The ethylene 

and propylene production rate would be 1.16 million lbs/day and 1.61 million lbs/day, respectively. 

To determine if this volume of gas was obtainable, the capacity of current processing 

stations was researched. Blue Racer Midstream in Natrium, WV currently has a capacity of 

200 MMcfd, with the planned addition of another 200 MMcfd.  Blue Racer’s Berne, OH location 

is designed to accommodate three 200 MMcfd cryogenic processing units [19]. These individual 

locations all process 4-6 times our required capacity, so 104 MMcfd was determined to be 

obtainable.   

Additionally the production rate is compared to existing plants to evaluate feasibility. HMC 

Polymers Company Limited has a plant in Thailand with a capacity of 300,000 metric tonnes per 

year [20], or 1.89 million lbs/day. This similar production rate was used as a heuristic to further 

validate the desired production rate 

Producing such a large quantity of product maximize the profit margin per pound and 

reduce the capital cost per pound of product. Because capital costs do not scale directly with 

production capacity, a large capacity is desirable.

2.3.5 Toxicity  
 

In general, the components of this process don´t have high toxicity. No compounds are 

carcinogenic. The major concern is asphyxiation, as the majority of the process gasses are simple 

asphyxiates. Because of this, proper ventilation and monitoring systems are needed for safe 

production. Additionally, many of the chemicals are flammable and can act as explosives under 

certain conditions. To safely operate with exposure to flammable gasses, concentrations should be 

monitored and ignition sources should be eliminated. A detailed toxicity breakdown on each 

component can be found on Appendix A.  

 

2.3.6 Plant Location  
 

One possible location for the proposed propylene plant is Marcus Hook, PA. This location 

is promising because it is home to a Braskem polypropylene plant, which can use our propylene as 

the starting block for their process [26]. This reduces transportation costs and maximizes 

profitability.  

Additionally, the Williams Transco pipeline supplies gas from the Marcellus Shale 

formation to the East Coast region [27]. This pipeline has the capacity to supply the required 

volume of gas to meet our desired production. The availability of gas through this pipeline reduces 

any transportation or delivery costs of the raw materials.

3 CONCEPTUAL PROCESS DESIGN 
 

In order develop a feasibility assessment for a new production process, the chemical industry 

uses a series of steps, followed in this project, that are described in Chapter 2 of [28] and 

summarized in Table 3.1. The very first step of such methodology, step 0, is to conduct all 

necessary preliminary research described in the Background section of this report. The subsequent 

steps of the conceptual process design methodology help to cover all the aspects necessary for any 

successful new process. 

 
Table 3.1 - Conceptual process design steps and their descriptions. 

Design Step Description 

1. Operation mode 
Decides whether the process is batch or 

continuous. 

2. Input/output structure 
Includes the overall chemistry of the process, 

the material balances, and calculation of a 
profit potential. 

3. Recycle structure Evaluates the use of recycle streams. 

4. Initial process flow diagram 
Regards the reactor sequencing, use of some 
equipment such as heat exchangers, pumps 

and compressors 

5. Separation synthesis 
Considers the units necessary to achieve 
desired product purity and separation of 

mixed streams. 

6. Energy integration 
Design for efficient energy use, as well as 

reduction of energy costs and inputs. 

 
 

3.1 Operation Mode 
  

The first heuristic that was used to evaluate the size of the process addressed concerned the 

production rate. A production rate higher than 5,000 metric tons per year would require a 

continuous process and a production less than 5,000 metric tons would require a batch process [28].   



25 
 

The second heuristic addressed taken into consideration was the desired flexibility of the 

process. A batch process is designed to be more flexible than a continuous design because it can 

accommodate many different types of feed materials. The propylene production plant is only 

designed for an input of natural gas and water; therefore, it does not require flexible feed inputs. 

This makes flexibility a non-determining factor in the decision of establishing a reactor mode.   

Taking into account the size heuristic and the lack of flexibility of the process, it was decided 

that the production mode for our conversion process is continuous. 

 

3.2 Input/output Structure 
 
 An overall material balance and a calculation of the potential profit of the conversion 

process at an input/output level are performed. The overall process is represented by a block flow 

diagram shown in Figure 3.1, illustrating the inputs and outputs of the process without including 

any intermediates. 

 

 

Figure 3.1 - Block flow diagram of the entire process on an input/output level. 
 

The input streams consist of the raw material feeds of the production process. The raw 

materials for this process are natural gas and water. The output streams consist of main products 

ethylene and propylene, hydrogen from the syngas contraction, fuel, water, a purge stream and gas 

wastes. Products of this process that will be used for fuel heating operations within the process are 

dimethyl ether, butane, and 1-butene. The waste stream leaving the process is composed of carbon 

dioxide, nitrogen and unreacted syngas.  



26 
 

A material balance was performed for inputs and outputs of the conversion process using the 

stream table given in the syngas contract, which can be found in Attachment A, and conversions 

and selectivities from Error! Reference source not found. 2.4. The results of the calculations of 
the material balance are shown in Error! Reference source not found.3.2. For an input/output 
level analysis, it is assumed that all separation steps are 100% efficient.

A potential profit margin calculation was also performed using the materials market prices 

from Error! Reference source not found.2.6. Utility costs that would be saved by using the fuel 

stream for heating processes during the production are not included in this analysis. A breakdown 

of the potential profit margin can be found in Table 3.3.

Raw Materials

Water [25] 0.0004 - 0,8 

TOTAL   339.8 
 

 The potential profit of the conversion process on an input/output level is approximately 

$ 440 million per year, so the process design can move forward to the next step. 

 

3.3 Recycle Structure  
 

It can be noticed that a lot of hydrogen and carbon monoxide is leaving the process in the gas 

waste stream due to low per pass conversion through the methanol reactor. For this reason, a recycle 

stream will be implemented in Step 2 of the process. Since the recycle stream contains nitrogen 

and carbon dioxide, a purge of 5% of this stream will be implemented to avoid accumulation of 

inert gases. The first and third reactors have high conversions, as shown in Table 2.4, so recycle 

loops are not required. 

Water is another reactant that is being wasted through the process, but since Step 1 is outside 

our plant, the implementation of a recycle stream is not considered. Figure 3.2 show the same 

input/output level BFD, but considering recycle streams. 

 



28 
 

 

Figure 3.2 - Block flow diagram of the process on an input/output level with recycle streams. 
 

3.4 Initial Process Flow Diagram 
 
After recycle stream was implemented, the method of operation and type of reactor for Steps 

2 and 3 were analyzed. Both reactions occur in a gas phase, so a CSTR was eliminated from 

contention. Packed bed reactors were selected as the best for offering high contact area with the 

catalysts.  

After the type of reactor was selected, the method of operation was investigated. Since the 

reactions steps are both exothermic, large temperature changes might occur if the reactors are run 

adiabatically. Simulated on HYSYS, the reactors for Steps 2 and 3 running adiabatically can reach 

temperatures up to 1525 ºF and 1302 ºF, respectively. Because the reaction kinetics and yield are 

functions of temperature, all reactors should be run isothermally to ensure optimal production. For 

the same reason, both reactors are sized as heat exchangers to guarantee they will have enough heat 

transfer area to perform the conversion at a constant temperature. 

The next step in the design process was to create an initial process flow diagram in order to 

size and cost equipment necessary for the preparation of each reactor feed and to operate the 

reactors themselves. The size and cost calculations follow the algorithms described in 

Appendices B of this report. 

The second reaction step of our process, methanol synthesis from syngas, is shown in Figure 

3.3. 



29 
 

 

Figure 3.3 –Syngas-to-methanol reaction section. 
 

The fresh syngas provided by the contractor, stream 101, available at 527 ºF and 265 psia, is 

compressed to the required operating pressure of the syngas to methanol reactor R-1 using 

compressor C-1. The compressed stream, stream 102, now at 946,1 ºF and 727 psia, is then mixed 

with a syngas recycle stream, stream 112, to form stream 103 at 807,4 ºF, which is cooled by the 

heat exchanger E-101 to the temperature of 427,7 ºF. Next, the process stream enters the packed 

bed reactor R-1, which converts 64% of the carbon monoxide in the syngas feed into methanol.  

Note that, before designing the separation step, the conditions of the recycle stream cannot 

be defined, but, to avoid a recalculation report and to make it easier to follow the report, the 

conditions assumed here are the conditions of the stream in the final design. A stream table of this 

reaction section can be found in Table 3.4

3.5 Separation Synthesis 
 

The separation section of the second step of our process can be found in Figure 3.5. 

 

 

Figure 3.5 – Syngas-to-methanol separation section. 

 

The stream exiting the syngas-to-methanol reactor, stream 105, is a gaseous stream 

containing water, methanol, unreacted syngas, and inert gases: nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon 



33 
 

dioxide. A separation section is needed to isolate the unreacted syngas from the desired 

intermediate, methanol, and also to eliminate most of the carbon dioxide in the stream, which would 

contaminate the desired products streams. Since this is an easy gas/liquid separation, the chosen 

unit for this separation is a flash drum, preceded by a turbine, a valve, and a heat exchanger. The 

turbine T-101 decompresses the reactor outlet stream 105 from 725 to 87 psia, which is the lowest 

before condensing methanol, resulting in stream 106. A valve completes the decompressing 

process, reaching 34.8 psia in stream 107. In order to maximize the amount of methanol in the 

liquid stream 113, a heat exchanger cools stream 107 to 19.4 °F before going to the flash drum F-

101, allowing 96.9% of the methanol and less than 0.01% of the carbon dioxide to be in the liquid 

stream 113. The gas stream 109 is 5% purged through stream 110. The remaining stream 111 is 

recompressed back to 725 psia by compressor C-102. A stream table of the syngas-to-methanol 

separation section is shown in Table 3.8

The third step separation section is divided in two parts for easier understanding. The first 

part of this section is represented in Figure 3.6. 

 

 

Figure 3.6 – Primary water and CO2 separations of the methanol-to-olefins separation section. 

 



35 
 

The stream 116 exiting the methanol to olefins reactor is a gaseous stream containing water, 

unreacted methanol, carbon dioxide, inert gases, main products ethylene and propylene, and 

heavier hydrocarbons. The main objective of this separation section is to obtain high purity 

products, polymer grade ethylene and propylene, which are only 99.9 and 99.5% in mol. 

Based on the heuristic that the easiest separation should be performed first, making the 

subsequent separations easier and less expensive [28], a flash drum is chosen to separate the water 

from the process stream. The heater exchanger E-103 is needed to cool down stream 116 from 104 

ºF to the operating conditions of the flash drum F-102, 104 °F and 23.9 psia. This unit removes 

98.1% of the water in the main stream 116, which is then stream 117 with only 0.04% in mol of 

water. Even though this is a small composition, it is not enough to obtain polymer grade ethylene, 

so a second water separation will be performed later in the process. 

The goal of the second separation of this section is to remove 99.8% of the carbon dioxide of 

the process stream 119. This is accomplished by absorption in diglycolamine 0.7% in weight 

aqueous solution, stream 151. This have been already performed in a previous work [29]. Stream 

151 has a flow ratio of 0.25 moles of diglycolamine per mol of carbon dioxide. According to 

HYSYS simulation, this is only possible for one tenth of the mass flow in stream 119, so 10 sets 

of absorbers A-101 and regenerators DC-101 will be used. The absorbers A-101 operate at 29 psia, 

while the regenerators DC-101 operate at 21.8 psia. For this reason, a compressor C-103 is needed 

to raise the pressure of stream 119, resulting in stream 120. This stream flows through the absorber, 

exiting it as stream 121, which is less than 0.0001% in mol of carbon dioxide. Stream 151 remains 

in the regeneration loop.

The reminiscent water in the process stream 121 needs to be 99.9% removed, chosen to be 

done by two separation steps. First, one flash drum F-103 operating at 50 ºF and 29 psia, so stream 

121 is cooled down by heat exchanger E-106, that separates 82.7% of the water, resulting in stream 

122. This stream flows through desiccant beds DB-101 containg AxSorb activated alumina, which 

is already effectively used for this same purpose in other plants. Three vessels are needed, two of 

which operate in series while the third one is regenerating [30]. This separation removes 99.9% of 

the water in the stream, resulting in process stream 126. 

The next separation steps goals are to obtain streams 99.9% in mol of ethylene and 99.5% in 

mol of propylene. This is accomplished by two distillation columns, DC-102 and DC-103. The first 

one operates at 512 psia, as performed in a different work [29], so a compressor C-104 and a heat 

exchanger E-107 are needed before it. This distillation column has 32 stages with the inlet, stream 

128, in the 20th one and a full reflux condenser. A condenser temperature 138.3 ºF is set to obtain 

polymer grade ethylene 99.9% in mol in stream 129. The bottom stream 130 flows through a valve 

that decompresses it to 362.6 psia, the operating pressure of the second distillation column. The 

stream 131 enters the column in the 15th stage of its stages and a total reflux ratio of 6 is used to 

obtain polymer grade propylene 99.5% in mol in stream 132 and a fuel stream in stream 133.

A NPV analysis, as described in Section 4 of this report, is performed and a value of 

$ 277 million is obtained. This value will be compared to the NPV of the heat integrations in order 

to decide whether they are feasible or not. 

 

3.6 Energy Integration 
 

The first step of energy integration is to evaluate which heating and cooling units comprised 

significant portions of the fixed capital investment and total operating costs. This is done with the 

purpose of seeing where money can be saved by using energy generated in the process where 

needed.  

 In addition to evaluating the largest potential economic savings, energy integration 

composite curves are also considered to determine the maximum amount of energy that can be 

recovered. Heat flow and stream temperatures are the limiting factors that determine if integration 

is possible. Streams cannot transfer more heat than they possess and the stream temperatures cannot 

get within a certain approach temperature. If the approach temperature is too small, the heat 

exchanger area increases dramatically and makes the units more expensive and impractical. 

Tables 3.16 and 3.17 show all the heating and cooling duties present in the process and 

Figure 3.8 show their composite curves.

Figure 3.8 – Composite curves of all units with a temperature approach of 10ºC. 

 

Figure 3.8 shows that the total amount of energy that can be possibly integrated is 423 GJ/h. 

Based on the results shown in Tables 3.16 and 3.17, the most beneficial combination is the 

integration of the heat exchanger E-101 with the molten salt heater E-103 because all the available 

heat in E-101 could be transferred to E-103, so extra heat exchangers for make-up heating on the 

stream of E-101 would not be necessary. This can be more easily seen when plotting the composite 

curves of these two heat exchangers alone, which can be found in Figure 3.9.

Figure 3.9 – Composite curves of units E-101 and E-103. 

 
This integration achieves complete cooling of stream 103 to stream 104, thus these streams 

remain unchanged. However, some trim heating needs to be done to stream 113 after integration 

so that it can achieve desired 376,7 ºC. Because of this trim heating, a molten salt heater is still 

needed to heat stream now called 213 from 309 °C to 377 °C, resulting in stream 214.  

Despite the need for trim heating, no additional units are needed and the heat duty of the 

molten salt heater decreases considerably. Both the operating and capital costs are lowered for both 

units as seen in Table 3.18

Heat integration was found to increase to approximately $ 329 million. This analysis can be 

found in section 4 of this report. This design is defined to be the final one, which is shown in 

Figure 3.10, followed by its stream table in Table 3.19.

4 NPV ANALYSIS 
 
The net profit value (NVP) analysis is a discounted technique for the evaluation of 

profitability of a project, which means it takes into account the time value of money. This analysis 

brings future money incomes to the present multiplying them by their respective discount factors, 

considering that a certain amount of money in the future is worth less in present. The methodology 

used in this project is described in chapter 10 of [28]. The expression for the calculation of the NVP 

is: 

??? =  ???? + {?|?, ?, ?}(? ? ??) + {?|?, ?, ?}(?? + ??) 

Where ??? is total capital investment project, ? is the estimated minimum acceptable rate 

of return (MARR), ? is the project lifetime, ? is the annual sales, ?? is the annual manufacturing 

cost of the project, ?? is the salvage value and ?? is the working capital of the project. {?|?, ?, ?} 

is the uniform series present worth factor or present worth of annuity and {?|?, ?, ?} is the single 

payment present worth factor. 

According to Table 9.1 of [28], the discount factors can be expressed as: 

{?|?, ?, ?} =
(1 + ?)? ? 1

?(1 + ?)?
 

{?|?, ?, ?} =
1

(1 + ?)?
 

As suggested by [25], a minimum acceptable rate of return (MARR) of 30% is assumed for 

a project lifetime of 10 years. The discount factor can be then calculated: 

{?|?, ?, ?} = 3.0915 

{?|?, ?, ?} = 0.0725 

 

4.1 Total Capital Investment 
 

The total capital investment of the project is the summation of all the costs associated with 

the building and the startup of the process, being expressed as Equation 9.21 in [28]: 

??? = ???2,3 + ??2,3 + ???1 



 

53 
 

Where ???2,3 is the fixed capital investment of our plant, ??2,3 is the working capital of 

our plant and ???1 is the total capital investment for the syngas contraction. 

The fixed capital investment includes four different types of costs: 

x Direct project expenses, related to the purchase of the equipment, piping, insulation 

and fireproofing, foundations and structural supports, instrumentation and 

installation. 

x Indirect project expense, which includes transportation of equipment and materials 

to the plant site, salaries and benefits to operators during installation, such as 

vacation, sick leave and retirement. 

x Contingency and fee, to cover unforeseen circumstance, for example, storms, 

changes in design or unpredicted price increase. 

x Auxiliary facilities, accounting for purchase of land, excavation, water and sewer 

systems, construction of administration offices, control rooms, storages, etc. 

As suggested in Section 7.3.7 of [28], the direct and indirect costs of our plant can be 

approximated with the summation of the bare module costs of all equipment in our plant. Using 

the grassroots approach, the contingency and fee costs are estimated as 15% and 3% of the direct 

and indirect costs, respectively, while the auxiliary facilities costs are evaluated as 50% of the total 

bare module costs of all equipment if they were under ambient conditions: 

???2,3 = ??? 2,3 + ??? 2,3 + ??? 2,3 

??? 2,3 = 0.18 ??? 2,3 

??? 2,3 = 0.5 ???
0

2,3 

 Where is ??? 2,3 is total bare module costs of equipment, ??? 2,3 is the contingency and fee 

costs, ??? 2,3  is the auxiliary facilities cost and ???
0

2,3  is the total bare module costs of all 

equipment at ambient conditions, all for our plant. 

The bare module costs for all of the units in the production process were summed and 

summarized in Table 4.1. The sizing and costing calculations for the units in the plant are located 

in Appendices B.

TOTAL  119.15 118.61 
 

The auxiliary facilities and the contingency and fee costs were added to obtain the fixed 

capital investment of our plant. Table 4.2 shows each of these costs separately. 

 
Table 4.2 – Breakdown of fixed capital investment of our plant. 

Cost type Value ($ million) 
Total bare module, ??? 2,3 119.15 
Contingency and Fee, ??? 2,3 21.45 
Auxiliary Facilities, ??? 2,3 59.30 

Fixed Capital Investment, ???2,3 199.90 
 

The working capital is the amount of capital required to initiate the plant and to maintain 

the operation for the first months before sales. It is usually used to cover salaries and raw material 

inventories. According to section 9.7.1 of [28], typical values of working capital range from 15 to 

20% of the fixed capital investment. A median value for our plant will be considered in this project: 

??2,3 = 0.175 ???2,3 



 

55 
 

The total fixed capital investment of our plant from Table 8 was added to fixed capital 

investment of the syngas contraction, which can be found on Attachment A, and the working capital 

in order to obtain the total capital investment. Table 4.3 shows how the total capital investment 

was obtained.

4.2 Sales 
 

Besides propylene, ethylene and hydrogen can also be sold as secondary products of this 

plant. Table 4.4 shows the total income breakdown of sales using the mass flows obtained from 

HYSYS.

Hydrogen [23] 0.31 28258 73.58 

Total sales, ?  650.98 
 
 

4.3 Manufacturing Costs 
 

The manufacturing costs are the ones related to the continuous capital used for the operation 

of the plant and can be divided in 3 different types: 



 

56 
 

x Direct costs, associated to the costs of raw material, waste treatment, utilities, operating 

labor, supervisory, maintenance, repairs, operating supplies, laboratory charges, 

patents and royalties. 

x Fixed costs, which accounts for depreciation, local taxes, insurance, fire protection, 

safety services, cafeteria, etc. 

x General expenses, including administration costs, salaries, distribution and selling 

costs, marketing, and research and development. 

Including the manufacturing costs of the syngas contraction, the manufacturing costs of this 

process can be approximated as in Equation 8.2 of [28]: 

?? = 0.28 ???2,3 + 2.73 ??? 2,3 + 1.23 (??? 2,3 + ??? 2,3 + ???) + ??1 

Where is ???2,3 is the fixed capital investment, ??? 2,3 is the cost of operating labor, ??? 2,3 

is the utilities costs, ??? 2,3 is the costs for waste treatment, all of our plant, ??? is the cost of the 

raw materials, and ??1 is the manufacturing costs of the syngas contraction, which can be found 

in Attachment A. Note that the syngas contraction includes the costs of the natural gas reforming, 

but not the natural gas and water themselves. 

The cost of operating labor can be estimated multiplying the number of operators per shift, 

???, by a factor of 4.5 in order to cover all the rotating shifts throughout the year and by the average 

annual salary of an operator of $ 59,580, as described on Section 8.2 of [28]: 

??? 2,3 = ??? 2,3 ? 4.5 ? $ 59,580 
 

??? 2,3 = (6.29 + 31.7 ?2,3
2 + 0.23 ??? 2,3)

0.5
 

Where is ?2,3 is the number of processing steps involving the handling of particulate solid 

and ??? 2,3  is the number of nonparticulate processing steps, including compression, heating, 

cooling, mixing and reaction in our plant. 

In this plant, there is no processing step involving the handling of particulate, but 288 

equipment involving nonparticulate processes, so: 

??? 2,3 = 8 



 

57 
 

??? 2,3 = $ 2.14 ???????/???? 

 

The utilities costs for all of the units in the production process were summed and 

summarized in Table 4.5. The sizing and costing calculations for the units in the plant are located 

in Appendices B.

Since there is no waste to be treated in our plant: 
 

????,? = ? 
 

Table 4.6 shows the total outcome breakdown of raw materials purchase using the mass 

flows obtained from HYSYS.

The manufacturing costs can now be calculated. Using the approximations suggest in Table 

8.2 of [28], Tables 4.7, 4.8 and 4.9 show breakdowns of the direct manufacturing costs, the fixed 

manufacturing costs and the general manufacturing expenses of our plant, respectively. A 

breakdown of the total manufacturing costs of the process can be found in Table 4.10.

4.4 Salvage 
 

The salvage represents the value of the plant at the end of the plant life. Usually, the salvage 

value represents a small fraction of the total capital investment and it is commonly assumed to be 

zero: 

?? = ? 

4.5 NPV Calculation 
 

The NPV calculation can now be performed using the total capital investment, sales, 

manufacturing costs, salvage and working capital values calculated on sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 

4.4 of this report. Table 4.11 shows a breakdown of the NPV calculation components.

Working capital, WC ($ million) 34.98 
 

??? = $ ???. ?? ???????  

 

4.6 Profitability analysis 
 

Some of the economic measures to assess profitability include a comparison of a calculated 

minimum selling price to the actual market price. A minimum selling price was calculated 

multiplying the current selling price of a common reducing factor, ?, among the current prices of 

the valuable products in the process.  This reducing factor is expressed as: 

???? = ? ? ???????? 

???? = ? ? ???????? 

? =
????=0

?
 

Where ???? is the minimum selling price of ethylene, ???? is the minimum selling price of 

propylene, ????????  is the current price of ethylene and ????????  is the current selling price of 

propylene, which can be found in Table , SNPV=0 is the sales value needed in order to obtain a NPV 

of zero and ? is the current design sales value.  

The sales value needed in order to obtain an NPV of zero, ????=0, is calculated using the 

same equation used to calculate NPV: 

0 =  ???? + {?|?, ?, ?}(????=0 ? ??) + {?|?, ?, ?}(?? + ??) 



 

61 
 

Where ??? is total capital investment project, ? is the estimated minimum acceptable rate 

of return (MARR), ? is the project lifetime, ?? is the annual manufacturing cost of the project, 

?? is the salvage value and ?? is the working capital of the project. {?|?, ?, ?} is the uniform 

series present worth factor or present worth of annuity and {?|?, ?, ?} is the single payment present 

worth factor.

5 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

This report has presented a number of important considerations related to the conversion of 

natural gas into value-added products. It is worthy to investigate new ways to process the natural 

gas and find alternative ways to use it and not only as an energy source. Because of the desire to 

rejuvenate the United States’, and more specifically Pennsylvania’s, stagnant manufacturing 

industry and keep this new valuable resource locally.  

The important conclusions from this report are as follows:  

x Propylene are the chemicals chosen for having the best potential profitability and 

marketability.  

x The chemical scheme chosen for the production of propylene is the methanol to olefin 

method (MTO). This method converts methane to synthesis gas, which is then 

converted into methanol and then propylene. As by product, ethylene is produced, 

which is also marketable. 

x The technical feasibility is determined using a simulation software and previous work 

data. 

x The economic feasibility is determined calculating a net present value (NPV), which is 

used to determine a minimum selling value. The minimum selling price of propylene is 

found to be $0.56/lb, compared to the current market price of $0.65/lb. The minimum 

selling price of propylene is found to be $0.52/lb, compared to the current market price 

of $0.61/lb. 

The information on this report could now be used to prove the feasibility for making 

propylene from natural gas. 

Based on the results discussed in this document, we recommend the following:  

x Investigate further the kinetics of the MTO process to explore the possibility of forming 

byproducts with a higher order of carbon than butane.  

x Investigate further the operating conditions and performance of the desiccant beds. This 

may incur a larger compressor duty needed to perform these separation processes, 

which would increase the processes respective capital and operating costs. 



 

63 
 

x Proceed to the next phase of process design.  This includes a more detailed estimation 

of the design with more precise specifications for all utilities, equipment, 

instrumentation, electrical and offsite needs.

APPENDIX A - Toxicity information 
 

Oxygen 

x Toxicity – At atmospheric concentration and pressure, oxygen poses no toxicity 

hazards.  Retinal damage may occur in adults exposed to 100% oxygen for extended periods 

(24 to 48 hours) 

x Processing – Stored in a well-ventilated, secure area and separate from flammables.  All 

gauges valves, regulators, piping and equipment used in oxygen service must be cleaned 

for oxygen service in accordance with compressed gas association pamphlet G-4.1. [31] 

Methane 

x Toxicity - Simple asphyxiate.  Nontoxic but it can reduce the amount of oxygen in the air 

necessary to support life (less than 19.5%). 

x Processing – Never allow any part of the cylinder to exceed 52 ºC.  Provide adequate 

ventilation to prevent accumulation of gas above 1.0% vol. of methane.  The lower 

explosive limit of methane is 5.0% vol.  The threshold planning quantity (TPQ) is 10,000 

lbs [32] 

Water 

x Toxicity- non-corrosive/irritant for skin, non-hazardous for ingestion, does not irritate the 

lungs, and not corrosive to eyes or lungs. 

x Processing – Not a controlled chemical [33] 

Hydrogen 

x Toxicity – simple asphyxiate 

x Processing – flammable (Lower Explosive Limit 4%), threshold planning quantity (TPQ) 

10,000 lbs [34] 

Carbon Monoxide 

x Toxicity – Chronic overexposure causes damage to the central nervous system.  Permissible 

Exposure Limit (50 ppm) [35] 



 

72 
 

x Processing – use in an explosion-proof local exhaust system with sufficient air flow. Carbon 

monoxide is subjected to the Pennsylvania worker and community right-to-know act 

Carbon Dioxide 

x Toxicity – asphyxiate, stimulates respiration and causes respiratory depression. High 

concentrations result in narcosis. 

o 1% vol = increase breathing 
o 2% vol = breathing rate 50% above normal 
o 3% vol = breathing twice normal rate 
o 4-5% vol = breathing four times normal rate 
o 5-10% vol = characteristic sharp odor and very labored breathing 
o 50% - 100% vol – unconsciousness/death 

x Processing – Nonflammable and no significant regulations [36] 

Methanol 

x Toxicity – Mutagenic for mammalian somatic cells, hazardous in case of skin contact 

(irritant), ingestion, or inhalation. May cause blindness if ingested. Eco toxicity in water is 

29400mg/L for 96 hours (fathead minnow). 

x Process – Methyl alcohol Pennsylvania RTK, no smoking [37] 

Propylene 

x Toxicity – asphyxiate, no harm expected from gas, liquid may cause frostbite, chronic 

overexposure produced liver damage. 

x Process – requires annual report of release of toxic chemicals, TPQ is 10,000 lbs, PA – 

worker and community right-to-know act (WCRTK Act). [38]  

Ethylene 

x Toxicity – Simple asphyxiate, on the TSCA inventory of toxic substances control act [39]. 

x Process – requires submission of annual reports of release of toxic chemicals, PA WCRTK 

Act.   

 

 



 

73 
 

Dimethyl Ether 

x Toxicity – Narcotic (affect central nervous system), liquid dimethyl ether causes frostbite, 

vapor may irritate eyes, on the TSCA inventory. 

x Process – TPQ – 10,000lb, not subjected to major regulations [40] 

Propane 

x Toxicity – non-toxic but a simple asphyxiate, on TSCA inventory. 

x Process – Flammable, well ventilated, piping and equipment that can withstand high 

pressure. [41] 

Ethane 

x Toxicity – asphyxiate, repeated or prolonged exposure of the skin may cause dermatitis 

x Process – Flammable, well ventilated, piping and equipment that can withstand high 

pressure. [42]

Operating cost computation (All heat exchanger fluids except for unrefrigerated water) 
 

The operating cost of the heat exchanger is dependent on the amount of heat exchanger 

fluid used to accommodate the required heat duty of the exchanger. The costs associated with the 

use of heat exchanger fluids are located in the [25]. The costs associated with refrigerants are 

located in [28]. 

  
 Operating computation expressions: 

??? = ? ? ? 

 
Symbol names and definitions: 

??? : The operating cost of the heat exchanger 

?: The heat duty of the heat exchanger 

?: The price per unit energy for the operating cost using a specific heat exchanger 

fluid

Operating cost computation (Unrefrigerated water) 

 
 The calculation for the operating cost of using unrefrigerated water as a heat exchanger 

fluid varies from all other heat exchanger fluid operating costs. The following is an example of a 

calculation for the operating cost of heat exchanger unit115 using unrefrigerated water. Figure B5.2 

shows a diagram of the heat exchanger unit E-104 Cond in the process. The operational conditions 

of this unit can be found on Table B5.3.

Memorandum 
 

 
Date: October 15, 2014 
 
To: Team 3 Engineers 
 

Process Engineering Department 
 
From: James E. Maneval and Ryan C. Snyder 
 

Project Supervisors, Process Engineering Department 
 
Subject: Syngas System Design and Cost Estimation 
 
Per the request you delivered, here is an estimate from our syngas facility contractor. Keep in mind 
that this estimate is also at the same level of certainty of other estimates you will make using 
correlations from Turton or the Green Report. Thus, once the design of your entire process is 
completed, you should view these numbers with no more and no less certainty than others you are 
using. More detailed requests may even be possible. 
 
Natural gas to be treated: 
 

• Composition: 0.95 CH4, 0.04 C2H6, 0.005 CO2 and 0.005 N2 
 

• Flow rate needed = 31,000 lbmol/hr 
 
• Requested H2:CO molar ratio = 2:1 

 
On the basis of a 2:1 H2:CO ratio, as requested, this flow rate translates to 330,670 lb/h or 150,300 
kg/h of syngas product to be delivered. This is essentially at the upper end of the production rate 
that our contractor is willing to provide quotes for. If your needs change in excess of this figure, 
please contact us for a re-evaluation. The syngas will be delivered to you at 275 ?C and 18 atm 
while the hydrogen by-product stream will be available at 25 ?C and 2 atm. 
    
Table 1 summarizes the mass flows (in kg/hr) for your syngas production process. Note that in 
addition to the required flow of a natural gas feed stream, there is a corresponding hydrogen by-



 

112 
 

product stream (needed to achieve your specified H2:CO mole ratio) and an associated water input 
stream required as a raw material to generate the syngas per your specification. 
 
 
Table 1: Component mass flows for the production of 150,300 kg/hr of syngas with a 2:1 H2:CO 

mole composition. All flows are in kg/hr.

The cost estimates for this process are provided at two levels. First, the capital investment and 
manufacturing cost required for a Level 3 analysis (the reactor(s) and compressor(s) manufacturing 
and capital costs, only) are given by: 
 

CI = $54,150,000 
 

MC = $50,500,000/year 
 
Second, the capital investment and manufacturing cost for the entire syngas process (Level 3 

analysis plus capital and manufacturing costs associated with separation operations) are given by: 
 

CI = $108,280,000 
 

MC = $126,250,000/year
