Geochemical mapping 
of arsenic in surface waters 
and stream sediments of the 
Quadrilátero Ferrífero, Brazil 

Mapeamento geoquímico do arsênio em 
águas superficiais e sedimentos fluviais
no Quadrilátero Ferrífero, Brasil
Abstract

 A regional study on the arsenic concentration in surface waters and stream sedi-
ments, with a density of one sample every 13 km2, was carried out for the first time in 
the Quadrilátero Ferrífero (Brazil). The region was divided into 3rd order catchment 
basins, in which 512 areas were sampled. The arsenic concentration was determined 
in waters and stream sediments after partial digestion with the aid of ICP-OES. The 
arsenic values found in surface waters ranged from 57.70 to 414 µg.L-1, while for stream 
sediments, arsenic concentrations ranged from 0.63 to 1691 mg.kg-1, and from the 512 
sampling points, 135 (26%) had arsenic concentrations above the limit of detection, 
which was 0.63 mg.kg -1. It was also found that 106 3rd order catchment basins had val-
ues above the third quartile, (5.09 mg.kg-1). The results show that high concentrations 
of this element are strongly related to the presence of Nova Lima rocks that contain 
minerals rich in arsenic. However, the anthropogenic influence in such high concentra-
tions cannot be ruled out, as the region has a history of over 300 years of gold mining.

Resumo

Um estudo regional da concentração do arsênio em águas superficiais e sedi-
mentos fluviais com uma alta densidade de amostragem de uma amostra para cada 
13 km2 foi conduzido pela primeira vez no Quadrilátero Ferrífero (Brasil). A região 
foi dividida em bacias de 3ª ordem, sendo amostrados 512 trechos nessas bacias. A 
concentração de As foi determinada nas águas e nos sedimentos, após digestão par-
cial, com o auxílio de um ICP-OES. Os valores de arsênio encontrados nas águas 
superficiais variaram entre 57.70 e 414 µg.L-1. Já para os sedimentos de corrente, 
as concentrações oscilaram entre 0.63 e 1691 mg.kg-1, sendo que dos 512 pontos de 
amostragem 135 (26%) apresentaram concentrações de arsênio acima do limite de 
detecção, que é de 0,63 mg.kg -1. Também foram encontradas 106 bacias de 3ª ordem 
com valores acima do 3º quartil (5.09 mg.kg-1). Os resultados mostram que as eleva-
das concentrações deste elemento estão fortemente relacionadas com a presença de 
rochas do grupo Nova Lima, que contém minerais ricos em arsênio. Porém, a influ-
ência antrópica na existência destas elevadas concentrações não pode ser descartada, 
já que a região apresenta um histórico de mais de 300 anos de exploração de ouro.

1. Introduction

Arsenic is a trace element, whose 
average concentration in the earth's 
crust has been set to values between 1.0 
(Taylor and McLennan 1995) and 4.8 
ppm (Rudnick and Gao 2003). Its occur-
rence is associated with certain types of 
minerals, mainly arsenopyrite (FeAsS), 
loellingite (FeAs2), realgar (As4S4) and 
arsenian pyrite (FeS2), which can be 
released to waters, soils and sediments 
by oxidation processes of these sulfides, 
and immobilized via adsorption into 
iron, aluminum and manganese oxides/
hydroxides or into clay minerals (De-
schamps et al. 2003). These processes 
occur naturally but can be intensified 
by the action of mining activities, with 
the exposure of large volumes of rocks.

The occurrence of high arsenic 
concentrations in various environmental 
compartments, whether natural or am-
plified by human activities, has become a 
public health problem, greatly increasing 
the concern of society and the scientific 
community regarding human contami-
nation by this element (Fewtrell et al. 
2005; Ravenscroft, 2009). According to 

Reimann et al. (2009), this was the first 
chemical element to be recognized for its 
carcinogenic properties, being used as a 
poison since the times of the Romans. 
The inorganic form is recognized as the 
most harmful to humans, and chronic 
exposure can cause serious metabolic 
problems, including hyperkeratosis, 
skin cancer, lung cancer, nervous sys-
tem disorders, increased frequency of 
miscarriages and other serious diseases 
(Abernathy et al. 1998).

However, the most common form 
of human exposure is through consump-
tion of contaminated water (Matschullat 
et al. 2000; Nordstrom, 2002). Not sur-
prisingly, the interest in arsenic exponen-
tially increased after incidents occurred 
in Bangladesh, West Bengal, India and 
Mexico caused by consumption of con-
taminated ground water extracted from 
aquifers located in arsenic geological 
formations (Matschullat, 2000, Smith et 
al. 2002; Neumann et al. 2010).

Despite dozens of published ar-
ticles, particularly at the end of the last 
century, the anthropogenic contribution 

to the high arsenic concentrations in 
various environmental compartments 
is not well defined, being a source of 
much debate. However, determining the 
natural abundance of arsenic is essential 
not only to support the analysis and 
environmental monitoring, but also to 
support actions to combat pollution (De-
schamps et al. 2003). In this sense, with 
the introduction of new digital mapping 
technologies, geochemical maps have as-
sumed an increasing relevance in recent 
years (Gielen 1998). These georeferenced 
maps allow observing the variation of the 
abundance of some chemical element in 
a specific area, thus contributing to the 
recognition of regions with anomalous 
values and contributing to the identifica-
tion of its main sources, whether natural 
or linked to human activities (Plant et 
al. 2001).

In this context, the present study 
aimed to perform the mapping of arsenic 
concentrations in water and stream sedi-
ments of the Quadrilátero Ferrífero using 
data of 512 sampling points distributed 
over its 7,000 km2.

Study Area
The Quadrilátero Ferrífero

The Quadrilátero Ferrífero is 
one of the richest regions in economic 
minerals in the world, covering an area 
of approximately 7,000 km2, whose 
exploration history dates back to the 
last decades of the seventeenth century. 

The region includes fully or partly 
35 municipalities in the mid region of 
the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil (Figure 
1), with a population of over 4,135,000 
inhabitants (IBGE, 2010). 

Mining is still among the pro-

ductive activities that support the 
region's economy, highlighting the 
current iron exploitation, which con-
tributes with 26.8% of the GDP(Gross 
domestic product) of Minas Gerais  
(IBGE, 2010).

Geochemical mapping of arsenic in surface waters and stream sediments of the Quadrilátero Ferrífero, Brazil

REM: R. Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 68(1), 043-051, jan. mar. | 2015

Five main lithostratigraphic units 
are found in the Quadrilátero Ferrífero 
with ages ranging from the Archean: 
Metamorphic Complex (Noce, 1995; 
Alkmim and Marshak, 1998) and 
Rio das Velhas Supergroup (Alkmim 
and Marshak , 1998), to the Protero-
zoic: Minas Supergroup and Itacolomi 
Group (Dorr II, 1969; Alkmim and 
Marshak, 1998), and occurrences of 
mafic and granitic intrusions of several 
generations (Dorr II, 1969; Marshak 
and Alkmim, 1998). Its richness in min-
eral resources and enormous structural 
and lithological variability directly in-
fluence the distribution and geochemi-
cal characteristics of its waters, soils 
and sediments.

In the Quadrilátero Ferrífero, 

arsenic has a close relationship with 
gold deposits present in minerals such 
as arsenopyrite, löllingite or as an impu-
rity in arsenopyrite (Borba et al. 2000; 
Figueiredo et al. 2006). 

These gold deposits are associated 
with shear zones that cross rocks from 
the Nova Lima Group, base of the Rio 
das Velhas Supergroup, or are located 
at the base of the Minas Supergroup, 
near the contact with the Nova Lima 
Group, in quartz and carbonate veins 
(Borba et al. 2000; Matschullat et al. 
2000; Mello et al. 2006). 

Its genesis is related to hydrother-
mal processes that follow successive 
deformation phases recorded in the 
geologic history of the Quadrilátero 
Ferrífero (Barbosa and Sabaté, 2004)

Although the presence of arse-
nic in waters and sediments of the 
Quadrilátero Ferrífero has been long 
recognized, there are few studies that 
specifically address this issue. 

Table 1 shows a summary of the 
most important studies. As observed, 
the works developed so far have focused 
on only 3 regions of the Quadrilátero 
Ferrífero: in the municipality of Nova 
Lima, the Velhas River Basin; in the 
municipalities of Ouro Preto and 
Mariana, the Carmo River Basin, and 
in the municipality of Santa Barbara, 
the Conceição River Basin. 

On average, these studies relied on 
only 17 water sampling points and 13 
points for the collection of sediments, 
featuring local studies.

 2. Methodology

2.1 - Sampling points
The choice of the sampling points 

was based on methodology proposed 
by Bolviken et al. (1996), with water 
and sediment collection carried out in 

3rd order stretches (Strahler, 1952) of 
catchment basins. In the present work, 
these stretches were determined based 
on the hydrographic map of the region 

on a 1:25,000 scale, provided by the 
Institute of Water Management of the 
State of Minas Gerais (IGAM), totaling 
512 sampling points (Figure 1).

2.2 - Sample collection and treatment
Water samples were collected 

at the center of each stretch, filtered 
with the aid of a cellulose acetate 
membrane (Millipore 0.45 µm) and 
acidified with three drops of nitric acid  
(USEPA, 2001). 

Then, they were sent for reading 
in Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical 
Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES), la-
bel SPECTRO / MODEL Ciros CCD at 
the Laboratory of Geochemistry of the 
Federal University of Ouro Preto, where 
the As concentration was analyzed.

As there is no standard method-
ology for sediment collection aimed 
at geochemical characterization, the 
adopted methodological procedures 

aimed to be as representative as pos-
sible, based on the characteristics of 
stream sediments sampled. 

T hus, nine samples were ob -
tained from each stretch. Thus, three 
subsamples were collected from a 
region of riffles, 3 subsamples from a 
region of pools and 3 subsamples from 
an area of transition between these  
two morphologies. 

For each morphological area, 
samples were collected at the right 
bank, left bank and center of the river, 
and samples collected at the banks were 
collected at a distance of 0.50 m from 
the riverbed. 

Also in the field, the subsamples 

were mixed so as to obtain a repre-
sentative sample of the stretch. After 
complete homogenization, quartering 
was performed to obtain a sample of 
500 g, which was packed in plastic bags, 
according to recommendations of EPA 
(Environmental Protection Agency) 
(USEPA, 2001).

In the laboratory, samples were 
dried under a controlled temperature 
at 40 ± 5°C, crushed, sieved and the 
sieve fraction smaller than 0.063 ?m 
was digested in aqua regia (Calmano 
and Forstner 1996). Once digested, the 
final product was analyzed in ICP-OES, 
where the arsenic content of each sample 
was determined.

2.3 - Statistical processing and map presentation
With the aid of the ArcMap® 9.3 

software and based on the geological 
map of the Quadrilátero Ferrífero on 
a 1:25,000 scale (Lobato et al. 2005), 
the percentage of all lithologies and geo-
logical formations that make up each of 
the 3rd order catchment basins sampled  
was calculated.

With the results, basic statisti-
cal parameters were determined and 
data normality was evaluated by the 
Komolgorov-Smirnov test. 

The methodology defined by Rei-
mann et al. (2005) was used to deter-
mine the background values, with the 
construction of boxplot-type curves and 

cumulative frequency histograms. Based 
on the geochemical analysis results and 
using the ArcMap® 9.3 software, maps 
showing the arsenic concentration in 
waters and stream sediments were con-
structed using a 1:150,000 scale and the 
IDW (inverse distance weight) method 
for interpolation.

3. Results and Discussion
Figures 2 and 3 respectively show 

the geochemical maps with the arsenic 
distribution in waters (Figure 2) and

Geochemical mapping of arsenic in surface waters and stream sediments of the Quadrilátero Ferrífero, Brazil

REM: R. Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 68(1), 043-051, jan. mar. | 2015

The arsenic values in surface water 
ranged from &amp;lt;57.70 to 414 µg. L-1. A num-
ber of 70 sampling points (13.7%), have 
values of arsenic above the quantification 
limit of 57.7 ?g. L-1, which in this case 
was considered as the background value, 
because most of the sample points (86.7%) 
showed concentrations up to this level. As 
surface waters can have arsenic concentra-
tions ranging from 0.5 µg L-1 to more than 
5000 µg L-1, with the most common values 
below 10 µg L-1, and often less than 1 µg 
L-1  (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002), the 
obtained high limit of quantification value 
did not allow a more detailed statistical 
analysis of water samples. However, the 
distribution of points with values above 
the limit of quantification show important 
trends, with waters rich in As occurring 
not only in the Carmo River (Borba et 
al. 2000; Deschamps et al. 2002; Borba 

et al. 2003; Varejão et al. 2011), Velhas 
River (Borba et al. 2000; Matschullat et 
al. 2000; Deschamps et al. 2002; Borba 
et al. 2003, Matschullat et al. 2007) and 
Conceição River basins (Borba et al. 2000; 
Matschullat et al. 2000; Deschamps et al. 
2002; Borba et al. 2003, Matschullat et 
al. 2007), but also in the Paraopeba and 
Piracicaba River basins.

For stream sediments, arsenic con-
centrations ranged from &amp;lt;0.63 to 1691 
mg.kg-1, and from the 512 sampling 
points, 135 (26%) had arsenic concentra-
tions above the limit of quantification, 
which was 0.63 mg.kg -1. It was also found 
that 106 3rd order catchment basins had 
values above 5.09 mg.kg-1, considered the 
background value. These sampling points 
are mostly composed of tributaries of 
the main local rivers, and another 35 in 
rural communities or suburban localities. 

These locations often have low-income 
and low-education populations, which 
are not aware of the risk they are being 
exposed to.

The highest values found in stream 
sediments (between 33 and 1691 mg.kg-1) 
are related to a substratum composed of 
sericite- chlorite-quartz schist, sericite 
schist, carbonaceous schist, quartz-mica-
chlorite schist and chlorite schist, rocks 
that compose the Rio das Velhas Super-
group, Nova Lima Group (Figure 5).

Among the sixteen 3rd order catch-
ment basins with the highest concentra-
tions (101.7 to 1691 mg.kg-1), fourteen 
have an area greater than 60% draining 
on the above mentioned rocks (Table 
2), which indicates a strong relationship 
between the lithological type and the pres-
ence of arsenic in the sediment (Figure 5 
and Table 2).

Analyzing the relationship between 
geology and the arsenic values obtained 
(Table 2), it appears that the basins with 
the highest percentages of rocks from 
the Nova Lima Group had Q3 values far 
greater than any other rock type. When 
considering the rock types outcropping in 
these basins, basins with more than 50% 
of their area on sericite-chlorite-quartz 
schist have 75% of rivers with arsenic 
concentrations up to 48.35 mg.kg -1. On 
the other hand, basins with more than 
60% of their area draining on sericite 
schist and carbonaceous schist showed Q3 
value equal to 62.91 mg.kg-1, and finally, 
rivers that cross basins with over 70% of 
quartz- mica-chlorite schists and chlorite 
schists have Q3 value of 104 mg.kg-1. This 
analysis is particularly interesting when 
these values are compared to data ob-
tained from other lithologies predominat-
ing in the IQ such as itabirites and hema-

tites, dolomites and limestones, gneisses 
and granites, ferruginous quartzites, and 
various types of phyllites, which showed 
significantly lower arsenic concentrations, 
with Q3 values near zero.

Most of the high As concentrations 
found in Quadrilátero Ferrífero, either 
in waters or in stream sediments, are 
derived from rocks rich in this element. 
Confirming this hypothesis, it was found 
that several points considered anomalous 
were within Conservation Units (CUs) or 
Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs), in 
which, theoretically, human interference 
is minimized. Examples are OP 23 (306.2 
mg.kg-1), OP 24 (130 mg.kg-1), OP 30 
(374.1 mg.kg-1) and OP 31 (101.7 mg.kg 
-1), located in the PPA of Cachoeira das 
Andorinhas, and OP 35, OP 36 and OP 
38 that are within the Uaimii forest, which 
have As values in the sediments above 
49.7 mg.kg-1.

According to the map shown in Fig-
ure 5, it appears that most of the anoma-
lies are located within the mid-northern 
region of the IQ, which despite having 
geological substratum rich in arsenic, is 
also characterized as having a high con-
centration of mining companies exploiting 
gold in Nova Lima, Sabará and Caeté, and 
iron in Nova Lima, Ouro Preto, Itabirito, 
Sabará, Santa Barbara and Caeté. Further-
more, much of the Quadrilátero Ferrífero 
region was intensively exploited for the re-
moval of gold between the seventeenth and 
nineteenth centuries, showing evidence of 
extraction processes in this period, includ-
ing mines and waste dumps (Fonseca et al. 
2001). The presence of mining activity for 
the removal of gold, in the current or past 
centuries, can accelerate the availability of 
elements for the environment, including 
As (Ripley et al. 1996; Matschullat et al. 
2007, Espinosa et al. 2009).

4. Conclusions

A regional study on the arsenic con-
centration in surface waters and stream 
sediments, with a robust density of one 
sample every 13 km2, was carried out for 
the first time in Quadrilátero Ferrífero 
(Brazil). This enabled the construction 
of geochemical maps with the spatial 
distribution of this element, not avail-
able so far.

High arsenic concentrations, po-
tentially harmful to human health, 
were found in both waters and stream 

sediments. In the case of waters, values 
greater than 57.70 µg. L-1 were found 
in all three major basins that cross the 
Quadrilátero Ferrífero: Velhas River, 
Doce River and Paraopeba River, and 
this is the first time that such concentra-
tions have been reported in the Parao-
peba River Basin.

In relationship to stream sedi-
ments, one fifth of the sampling points 
showed values above 5.09 mg.kg-1. 
Points whose concentrations were 

above 101 mg.kg-1 occurred in basins 
with 60% or more of their area formed 
by rocks that compose the Nova Lima 
Group, Rio das Velhas Supergroup.

Although data have shown that 
arsenic occurs naturally in the Quadri-
látero Ferrífero, the possibility that hu-
man action has contributed to increase 
these concentrations cannot be ruled out, 
particularly in areas where there are still 
caves and waste dumps from gold mining 
of ancient centuries.
