Resumo 

No início de 2016, a Comissão Europeia impôs, na Zona Euro, o mecanismo 

do bail-in como procedimento padrão para recuperar e resolver os bancos que 

foram enfraquecidos pela crise financeira. Esta nova medida pretende substituir 

a prática do bailout que tem sido apontada como causa da atual crise da dívida 

soberana da Zona Euro. 

Com este trabalho pretende-se analisar esta nova legislação e, 

retrospetivamente, aplicá-la ao Banco Espírito Santo (BES), um banco português 

que foi resolvido a 4 de Agosto de 2014 através de uma medida de separação de 

ativos. Este exercício tem como objetivo compreender em que consiste o 

mecanismo do bail-in, de que modo é feita a sua aplicação e, no caso específico 

do BES analisar quais seriam as diferenças relativamente à resolução que 

efetivamente ocorreu. 

Os resultados encontrados sugerem que a aplicação do mecanismo do bail-in 

ao BES ter-se-ia traduzido, no pior dos casos, numa poupança de cerca de 60% 

para o Estado português. Para além disso, apurou-se que era suficiente que os 

credores do BES suportassem perdas na ordem dos 28% para que não fosse 

necessária qualquer intervenção ao banco.

Abstract 

In the beginning of 2016, the European Commission imposed, in the Eurozone, 

the bail-in mechanism as a standard procedure to recover and resolve banks 

which have been weakened by the financial crisis. This new measure intends to 

replace the bailout practice that has been refered to be associated with the current 

Eurozone sovereign debt crisis.  

The purpose of this paper is to study this new banking legislation and, 

retrospectively, apply it to Banco Espírito Santo (BES), a Portuguese bank which 

was resolved on 4 August 2014 through an asset separation tool. This exercise 

endeavours to understand what the bail-in mechanism is, how it is performed 

and, in the particular case of BES to analyse how it would have been different 

from the resolution that effectively occurred. 

The results suggest that the application of the bail-in mechanism to BES would 

have granted, in the worst case scenario, savings for the Portuguese State of about 

60%. In addition, it was observed that it would have been sufficient that the 

investors of the entity had sustained losses of 28%, in order for the bank not to 

need any intervention. 

 

Keywords: Bail-in; Bank Regulation; Eurozone; Directive for Bank Recovery 

and Resolution; Banco Espírito Santo (BES).

Introduction 

The Great Recession, which evolved from a North American Real Estate crisis 

in 2007, caused the weakening of numerous banks and exposed several 

regulatory failures in the financial system worldwide. This unexpected situation 

required urgent measures to stabilize the whole economic structure and one of 

them was the bailout of banks. 

Governments of several countries – the United States, the United Kingdom, 

Ireland, Greece, Portugal, and more - chose to bailout their distressed financial 

institutions because they feared that the failure of one bank could cause the 

bankruptcy of more – risk of contagion. So, bearing in mind the devastating 

results that a failure of just one bank could cause to the entire financial system, 

and thus to the economy and society, governments aided these institutions by 

guaranteeing their liabilities1, providing impaired asset relief2, restructuring aid 

loans3 and even by recapitalizing these entities4, so that they could restore their 

viability. 

However, this bailout process is associate with two main problems. First, the 

process involves the use of taxpayers' money to repair damages made by banks’ 

poor investments and risky behaviour. This intensifies the idea that financial 

institutions are too big to fail leading to moral hazard - managers of banks will 

                                                
1 Governments commit themselves to pay a failing institution’s debt in case it fails. 
2 Governments take measures to liberate banks from non-performing assets that, by the principle of prudence, had 
to be impaired. 
3 Extension of the maturity of a loan, usually causing a decrease in the value of the instalments, so that the debtor 
is able to pay without defaulting. 
4 Injection of public funds to increase the capital of the bank and thus its solvency.  



 

continue with their irresponsible behaviour of excessive risk taking because the 

burden of their mistakes is allocated to someone else and they do not internalize 

the true value of risk. Therefore, bailing out a bank does not instil discipline in 

the institutions, making them likely to fail again in the future. 

The second problem is that by financing their recovery, the State itself is 

absorbing the banks’ debt and increasing its own, which can lead to a sovereign 

debt crisis, like the one currently being experienced in some European countries. 

To address the moral hazard issue and reduce the public cost of bank failures, 

the European Commission (EC) implemented the Bank Recovery and Resolution 

Directive (BRRD) that, among other measures to create a comprehensive 

recovery and resolution regime, it abolishes the bailout option and enforces the 

bail-in mechanism as a standard procedure to deal with ailing banks across the 

Eurozone. 

To bail-in a bank means to recapitalize it through the write-down5  of liabilities 

and/or their conversion to equity, allowing the institution to continue as a going 

concern 6  and avoiding the disruption of the financial system that would be 

caused by stopping or interrupting its critical services (The European 

Commission, 2014c). In other words, the bail-in tool enshrined in this new 

directive aims to transfer the costs of recovering a bank from taxpayers to 

creditors and shareholders of the institutions, making bank investors and 

managers liable for their actions and consequently more disciplined. 

However, even though this appears to be a fair solution which will only affect 

these institutions’ investors, the fact is that it will influence the entire society. As 

this resolution increases the risks 7  for investors, so does the premium they 

require for their funds, meaning that the banks’ financing costs will rise. If credit 

                                                
5 The understanding that a debt is partially uncollectible and therefore that amount has be considered as a loss. To 
write-off a debt means to consider the entire debt as uncollectible and thus a loss.  
6 “A going concern is a business that functions without the intention or threat of liquidation for the foreseeable 
future, usually regarded as at least within 12 months.” (The European Commission, 2012) 
7 Probability of loss and/or variability of returns (Gup, 2011, p. 26). 



 

institutions intend to keep the spread on their interest rates8, this implies that the 

financing costs for the final consumer will also increase. 

So, besides having the benefit of discipline the banking sector, the bail-in 

resolution tool has the downside of increasing interest rates which may 

consequently decrease consumption and investment in the real economy, 

slowing down economic growth. 

For this is currently an important matter, the purpose of this paper is to 

describe the new legislation and perform a practical example to better explain 

how it works. Therefore, this thesis is divided in two parts, one that describes the 

theory behind the bail-in mechanism and the other that applies it. 

In order to make this exercise more realistic, the practical component will be 

performed, retrospectively, in Banco Espírito Santo, a Portuguese bank which 

was resolved on 4 August 2014 through an asset separation resolution tool. This 

way, besides the application of the bail-in mechanism, it is possible to obtain 

some insights about the differences between this new resolution framework and 

the resolution that effectively occurred. 

A similar work was developed by (Conlon &amp;amp; Cotter, 2014), in which the 

authors applied retrospectively the bail-in tool in European banks which failed 

during the global crisis, analysing the proportion of the liabilities that would 

have been written down to cover for losses. Their empirical findings suggested 

that equity holders and subordinated bond holders would have suffered the 

greatest losses while senior debt holders would have loss significantly less. There 

were no evidences that unsecured depositors would have experience losses. 

Some other papers related to the subject include (Zhou et al., 2012), where the 

authors study the effectiveness and usefulness of the bail-in resolution tool as a 

way to restore the viability of distressed institutions, discuss potential risks and 

                                                
8 Banks profit from this spread which represents the difference between the interest rates provided to their clients 
and the interest rate at which they obtained funding. 



 

propose solutions to mitigate them. In (The European Commission, 2012), 

authors assess the quantitative impact of this tool in the annual EU GDP, having 

concluded that the expected annual net effect will be positive and amount to 

0,34%-0,62% of the EU GDP. 

This paper contributes to the debate by analysing a specific case of a highly 

polemical resolution where individual investors loss their lifetime savings. 

The bail-in exercise on BES, for academic purposes, is going to be based on the 

institution’s financial report from the first semester of 20149. So it would be as if 

the institution was resolved on 1 July 2014. 

Using the disclosed consolidated financial statements of the company, the bail-

in will be applied as if the purpose were to restore the entity’s ability to comply 

with the conditions to continue to carry out its activities (EU Regulation, 2014, 

Article 27).  

This work is structured as follows. Chapter 1 briefly introduces the financial 

system, why it is needed and how it works. Chapter 2 describes the last decade’s 

financial events, namely the financial crisis of 2007, started in the USA and its 

spill overs. Chapter 3 analyses the consequences of the financial crisis in Europe 

to ease the understanding of the regulatory measures set by the European 

Commission to end the current crisis and to prevent future ones. Chapter 4 

focuses specifically in describing the legal framework of the bail-in resolution 

tool and stating its benefits and disadvantages. Finally, Chapter 5 concerns to 

Banco Espírito Santo, why and how it was resolved and how the resolution 

through the bail-in tool would have been implemented.

Chapter 1. The financial system 

It is the financial system’s function to assure a smooth allocation of capital 

between its participants, through a borrowing-lending process that allows the 

supply of capital to equal its demand, at a given interest rate10. This means that 

borrowers in need of capital will be able to obtain funds from those willing to lend.  

To ease the interactions between these agents is the main purpose of financial 

institutions11. In other words, they act as intermediaries, creating a bridge between 

those who have surplus of money (savers) and those who have money shortage 

(borrowers). 

Not all the transfers from borrowers to lenders are made through a financial 

intermediary, however, these institutions are highly specialized and thus reduce the 

risks and searching costs12 for individuals. In this sense, financial institutions are an 

essential pillar in society as they support payment systems, enable individuals to 

save and invest for their future and then channel those savings to support the 

economy, by lending the funds to consumption and investment purposes (The 

European Commission, 2014a). 

Regarding the balance sheet of these institutions, the assets’ side is mostly 

composed by clients’ liabilities – debt and equity securities issued by companies 

and consumers such as stocks, bonds, loans, leases, mortgages -, and the 

                                                
10 Price paid for the use of credit (Gup, 2011, p. 34) 
11 There are numerous institutions that act like financial intermediaries, such as commercial banks, finance companies, 
hedge funds, pension funds, private equity funds, stockbrokers and dealers (Gup, 2011, p. 23). 
12  Searching costs represent the resources spent in the search of the wanted product or service. When a consumer uses 
a specialized intermediary instead of trying to find a direct provider, he is saving money, time and more resources.  



 

 

20 

institutions’ liabilities by the claims that clients and investors hold against them – 

checking accounts, savings deposits and banks’ own debt.  

These institutions create value mostly by investing low risk and high liquidity13 

assets received from their clients - checking accounts and savings deposits - into 

securities with higher risk and lower liquidity, since higher risks provide higher 

potential returns (Gup, 2011, pp. 23-24, 30).  

Due to the nature of their business – a very interconnected system that makes 

profit out of lending short-term against long-term assets -, banks can face liquidity 

shortage (Gup, 2011, pp. 24). This means that, in theory, they have the ability to 

comply with their short-term commitments yet not all at once as they are unable to 

turn their long-term assets into cash quickly. For this reason they operate on the 

basis of public trust and it only takes the loss of confidence in one bank to generate 

financial instability. 

In a simplified manner, if people started doubting of one bank, they would 

withdraw their funds from the institution causing its failure. Consequently, due to 

interconnectedness of the financial system, other banks would also start 

experiencing losses, caused by the write-down of their credits towards the failed 

institution. In turn, depositors of these banks, sensing their difficulties, will also 

withdraw their funds leading to their failure. 

 And the cycle will keep on repeating, with damaging effects not only to the 

financial sector but also to the real economy. This is why it is so important to have 

a transparent banking sector in which the society can trust.

Chapter 2. The financial crisis of 2007/08 and 
its spill-overs 

From 1970 to 2007, the USA’s population had grown from 205 million to 302 

million thus increasing demand for housing. In order to support the lodging of its 

citizens, the U.S. Congress approved measures to facilitate housing acquisition, 

such as interest rate caps. Low interest rates associated with generous commercial 

banks made it easy for anyone to obtain a mortgage regardless of their ability to 

repay – subprime mortgages14 (Gup, 2011, pp. 3-5). 

Banks were lending large amounts of money for two main reasons. First, they 

were being heavily financed by foreign investors and governments – mostly Japan 

and China. And second because they were using an instrument called Mortgage-

Backed Security15 (MBS) that allowed them to negotiate a loan with a client and then 

sell that asset to another financial institution willing to buy. 

The creation of securities like the MBS changed the entire banking system 

business model: initially, banks would generate-and-hold their loans, but the pre-

crisis trend was to originate-and-distribute them (Gup, 2011, p. 40). 

The widespread of MBS incentivized risky behaviour on commercial banks 

because, since they did not need to hold on to the loan, they did not have any 

incentives to verify the debtors’ rating. So banks would provide loans to low rated 

                                                
14 High-risk mortgages loans given to individuals with low credit ratings, and/or high loan-to-value ratios and/or 
debt-to-income ratios above 50 percent (Gup, 2011, p. 7). 
15 The sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market

borrowers and then sell those mortgages in the secondary market, disposing of the 

risk and still get a positive cash flow. 

The buyers of the MBS, uncertain about the solidity of the loans 16, would then 

purchase Credit Default Swaps (CDS) 17  as a way to insure the assets. The CDS 

market rose “from about $6.4 trillion in December 2004 to about $57.9 trillion in 

December 2007” (Gup, 2011, p. 9). 

The financing given to housing purchase also boosted the Real Estate bubble, but 

when the adjustable interest rates of many subprime mortgage loans rose, the 

borrowers lost the ability to comply with their commitments and defaulted.  

As clients defaulted, banks proceeded to foreclosure18 the assets used to secure 

the debt in order to recover some of the invested money. However, the price of the 

residences, which had inflated with the demand, fell sharply as banks 

unsuccessfully tried to sell them back. 

This Real Estate Crisis in the USA rapidly became a worldwide banking problem. 

The MBS had been sold all across the world19, so when the American Real Estate 

bubble burst, banks worldwide started experiencing massive asset impairments 

that could not be offset because they were too leveraged20. 

All of a sudden, international credit institutions were left with large amounts of 

non-performing loans that had to be considered as losses, insurance companies 

were also facing losses covering reimbursements to CDS purchasers, public 

authorities had to inject huge funds into these financial institutions to stabilize the 

                                                
16 There was a considerable asymmetry of information between mortgages creators and MBS purchasers.  
17 A form of insurance or hedge for MBS - if the borrower defaults, the holder of the debt is paid by the insurer (Gup, 
2011, p. 24) 
18 When clients default banks have several ways to try to recover some of their investments: they can prosecute the 
debtor to force the payment, try to restructure the loan in a way that allows him to pay, foreclosure the collateral (sell 
it in the market) or sell the loan at discount to other financial institution. 
19 The international banking markets were too integrated which increased the systemic risk - risk that exist when an 
entire sector is vulnerable to certain types of shocks – and the risk of contagion - the possibility that the consequences 
of a shock in an institution/country could spread to others. 
20 A company gets leverage once it uses debt to acquire assets. When an institution has significantly more debt than 
equity is considered to be highly leveraged and, in case the assets underperform, the company will fail without a 
capital buffer to sustain the loss.

economy as society lost confidence in the solvency and liquidity of the financial 

system (Gup, 2011, p. 26). 

So, what started as an American Real Estate Crisis grew to a banking crisis that 

quickly spread into other market segments and countries (Ackermann, 2008), 

becoming a global financial crisis transmitted to the real economy and resulting in 

a massive contraction of liquidity and credit availability (Gup, 2011, p. 26).

Chapter 3. The European reform 

3.1. The State Aid and the Eurozone debt crisis of 2010/11 

In Europe, between October 2008 and December 2012, Member States provided 

approximately 592 billion € (4.6% of EU 2012 GDP) of capital support to the banking 

sector, as an attempt to contain the crisis (The European Commission, 2013a).  

This unprecedented level of state support, although necessary to quickly stabilize 

the sector and prevent contagion, led to a sovereign debt crisis in Europe causing 

deep economic damages, such as high unemployment and income and wealth loss. 

Moreover, the increase in the public expenditure began a vicious circle between 

banks and the State. As credit institutions were suffering considerable asset 

impairments and dilapidation of their balance sheets, States, confronted with the 

possible insolvency of important banks in the economy, decided to bail them out. 

By financing their recovery using taxpayers’ funds, States deteriorated public 

accounts. This caused an increase in governments’ default risk leading to a 

downgrade in their credit ratings and a consequent raise in their refinancing costs. 

In turn, banks that were exposed to their sovereign’s bonds21 faced losses in those 

assets22 (Gennaioli, Martin, &amp;amp; Rossi, 2014). 

                                                
21 Usually, banks hold government bonds because these are considered very liquid assets, allowing them to perform 
day-to-day activities and to have a buffer of safe assets (Gennaioli, Martin, &amp;amp; Rossi, 2014). 
22 An increase in the risk of an asset causes a decrease in its price. This is considered the discount given to the investor, 
to incentivize him to take the risk. 



 

 

26 

Thus, when a bank is exposed to its own sovereign, any State aid to the financial 

sector will have negative repercussions to both parties. 

In addition to this negative circle, public support to banks also shifts tax payers’ 

contributions away from essential public goods, increases moral hazard in the 

banking industry and causes distortions in the economy, such as competition 

biases23. 

Hence, one of the first reforms in the EU after the beginning of the Crisis was to 

minimize and establish harmonized limits to the State support to credit institutions 

across Member States. These new restrictions were issued in a Banking 

Communication from the EC and took effect on 1 August 2013 (The European 

Commission, 2013b). 

This Communication specified that all the aid has to be approved by the 

Commission and for that to occur the distressed credit institution must present a 

plausible restructuring plan that ensures its long-term viability and that complies 

with the burden-sharing requirements. 

These burden-sharing requirements were created so that aided institutions and 

their investors bear some responsibility for their failure with their own resources 

and by paying an adequate remuneration to public authorities whenever they 

intervene. The burden sharing hierarchy is subsequently described in subchapter 

3.2. and in chapter 4. 

The EC also states that it is important that credit institutions, whether they are 

sound or facing difficulties, adopt measures to minimize the state support that may 

include the replacement of the board and of the executive, the imposition of stricter 

remuneration policies to executives, the reduction of disbursements and the 

increase of fund retention especially when the institution is already ailing (e.g. 

                                                
23 Banks that are given financial aid have competitive advantages compared with their industry’s peers.

dividend retention and avoidance of repurchase of capital instruments) (The 

European Commission, 2013b). 

3.2. The need for a Banking Union and the Single 

Rulebook24 

The crisis unveiled numerous breaches in the financial markets’ legislation and 

supervision. It also showed lack of responsibility, integrity and transparency in the 

financial sector that led to “the evaporation of trust in the market and related 

liquidity squeezes, weak bank balance sheets, high private and public debt levels, 

low interest rates, the recession and weak economic growth prospects” (The 

European Commission, 2014a).  

Even more, during the crisis, the European Union underwent through the 

fragmentation of its internal financial market as different cross-border legislation 

for bank recovery and resolution caused uncertainty and undermined investment 

and cooperation between institutions from different countries. Individual Member 

States applied uncoordinated measures to resolve their own financial issues, 

causing investors to flight to safety (Conlon &amp;amp; Cotter, 2014, 2015). This damaged the 

single currency and the single market for free movement of capitals and led to a 

deficiency of liquidity in the market (EU Regulation, 2014).  

As a result, to reform the sector became a priority for European banking 

authorities in order to provide stability to the economy, stimulate growth and to 

prevent future crises. Yet, these reforms needed to be made at a Eurozone level in 

order to assure consistency across Member States and to guarantee the functioning 

of the internal market. 

                                                
24 This subchapter is based on the European Commission MEMO/1 4/294 - Banking Union: restoring financial stability 
in the Eurozone (The European Commission, 2014c) 



 

 

28 

Therefore the European Commission created the Banking Union (BU) - an 

institutional and legal framework for financial services, mandatory for all Euro Area 

Member States and open for all the EU Members -, to complete the economic and 

monetary union. 

This Banking Union aims to restore the public’s confidence in the financial 

system by making it sounder and more transparent, with greater capital quality and 

quantity, more protection for depositors and enhanced supervision. It is also 

expected that these measures will break the negative relation between banks’ failure 

and the worsening of governments’ fiscal positions by putting the failure’s onus on 

private investors and reducing the moral hazard. 

“The Single Rulebook is the foundation of the Banking Union”, because it 

represents the common framework “covering regulatory and prudential rules for 

credit institutions, financial conglomerates and investment firms” to harmonize the 

European financial system, making it more transparent and integrated (The 

European Commission, 2014a). These are the most basic rules that each bank must 

comply with in order for the BU to work. 

This rulebook establishes three main pillars, each one safeguarding its respective 

legislation: 

? The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) addresses crisis prevention 

through an improved supervisory system with higher capital requirements and 

enhanced depositors’ protection. This mechanism is responsible for the 

enforcement of the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation (CRD IV and 

CRR) and the Deposits Guarantee Schemes (DGS); 

? The Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) focuses on early intervention 

whenever institutions underperform, but they also manage failures if recovery 

procedures are unsuccessful. This mechanism sustains the Bank Recovery and 

Resolution Directive (BRRD); 



 

 

29 

? European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS): the third pillar was proposed 

on 24 November 2015 and has not yet entered in force, however its purpose is to 

replace the national deposits guarantee scheme (DGS) as a way of further 

weakening the link between banks and their national sovereigns (The European 

Commission, 2015). EDIS will be explained in conjunction with the DGS. 

3.2.1. Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)25  

The crisis revealed deficiencies in supervision at a global scale and since 

strengthening regulations without control is worthless, on November 2014, the 

Single Supervisory Mechanism, the first pillar of the Banking Union, was 

implemented. 

The idea behind this mechanism is to create a specialized, independent and 

supranational supervisor that assesses and enforces the compliance of the BU rules, 

in all of its credit institution. This control will ensure that banks become more solid 

and less prone to shocks, preventing future crisis and strengthening the trust in the 

financial system. 

This oversight responsibility was assigned to the European Central Bank (ECB) 

that is now in charge of the direct supervision of the BU’s significant credit 

institutions26, while the remaining banks will continue to be supervised by their 

national competent authorities (NCAs), even though in close coordination with the 

ECB that at any moment may request to directly supervise less significant 

institutions. 

Nevertheless, even in significant credit institutions, supervisory tasks are 

divided between the ECB and the NCAs according to their relative importance. In 

                                                
25 This section is based on the European Commission MEMO/13/780 - Legislative package for banking supervision in 
the Eurozone – frequently asked questions (The European Commission, 2013c) 
26 Banks holding more than €30 billion on assets or – unless the value of its assets is below € 5 billion - that constitute 
more than 20% of their home country’s GDP, or it is one of the three most important institutions in a Member State. 
Currently, there are 123 institutions under the direct supervision of the ECB, which represents almost 82% of the BU 
credit institutions’ assets. 



 

 

30 

fact, some supervisory tasks will remain an exclusive responsibility of the national 

supervisors, like consumers protection, the supervision of payments services and 

daily verifications. 

This integration between the ECB and NCAs not only avoids duplication of work 

but it also allows the exploitation of the best of both institutions: the ECB’s highly 

qualified and specialized human resources and the NCAs’ knowledge of the 

jurisdiction, cultural and organizational characteristics and better understanding of 

the internal banking sector.  

The SSM harmonizes the levels of minimum supervision across the BU, yet the 

supervision of each bank is proportional to its systemic importance, complexity and 

risks.  It is the supervisors’ function – whether it is the ECB or the NCA - to perform 

stress tests to institutions assessing their capability of enduring difficult periods, to 

verify the compliance with the capital requirements, to analyse their systemic risk 

and the strength of their governance. 

Lastly, it is important to mention that considering the possible conflicts of 

interests that could arise within the ECB from concentrating monetary policy and 

supervision duties - as they both influence the interest rate-, the two responsibilities 

were separated and made autonomous. The ECB is also independent from any 

national government, any NCA or market participant, and it only answers to the 

European Parliament (EP) and to the European Council. This enables a consistent 

and unbiased supervision and enforcement of the rules, ensuring the soundness of 

institutions across the BU. 

  



 

 

31 

3.2.1.1. Capital Requirements Directives and Regulation (CRD 

IV and CRR)27  

The CRD IV and CRR aim to prevent the failure of banks and investment firms 

across the BU by making them more resilient. 

Because of the very nature of the banking activity, credit institutions are 

predisposed to be leveraged which is not considered a problem provided that 

institutions insure credit sustainability. However the financial crisis revealed that 

banks did not managed their credits in a sustainable way, since they kept on 

increasing their assets without holding sufficient capital – in quantity and in quality 

- capable of absorbing losses. This revealed insufficient preventive regulation, 

supervision and transparency of the sector at a global scale. 

To prevent future crisis, it is vital that institutions understand the risks they are 

incurring, anticipate possible stress periods and retain enough capital to survive 

them. So the CRD IV and the CRR were created to harmonise “the quality and the 

level of the (credit institutions’) capital base, the availability of the capital base,  

liquidity  management  and  the  effectiveness  of  their  internal  and  corporate 

governance” in the BU (The European Commission, 2013d). 

However, it is important that these regulations are imposed not only in the BU 

but in banks around the world in order to reduce competitive disadvantages and 

prevent regulatory arbitrage that may cause countries with less requirements to be 

more risk taking. This is the reason why the CRD IV and the CRR are based on the 

Basel III, from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) 28 , a 

“comprehensive reform package… (that) aims to improve risk management and 

                                                
27  This section is based on the European Commission MEMO/13/690 - Capital Requirements - CRD IV/CRR – 
Frequently Asked Questions (The European Commission, 2013d). 
28 “The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision provides a forum for regular cooperation on banking supervisory 
matters. Its objective is to enhance understanding of key supervisory issues and improve the quality of banking 
supervision worldwide. The Committee's members come from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, 
European Union, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, the 
Netherlands, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom 
and the United States” (Bank for International Settlements, 2016) 



 

 

32 

governance as well as strengthen banks’ transparency and disclosures”, across all 

of its international members (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2010) . 

This new set of rules is divided into a directive and a regulation. They differ from 

one another since the regulation has immediate effects in all Member States, while 

the directive still has to be transposed to the national law and may be subject to 

changes. Hence, the regulation avoids legal inconsistencies within the Single 

Market, increasing transparency and removing legal uncertainty. 

The CRD IV and CRR have two pillars. Pillar 1 quantifies the ratios of own funds 

an institution must retain according to its risk profile. Pillar 2 establishes that 

institutions themselves must assess their own capital needs. That assessment must 

be reviewed by regulators that can discretionally demand additional capital 

requirements if they consider necessary. Basel III also features Pillar 3 that involves 

a disclosure framework that institutions must fulfil to increase transparency in the 

sector. The main goal of the latter pillar is to allow investors to properly price these 

institutions in the market. 

Pillar 1 (capital, liquidity and leverage requirements) is contemplated in the CRR 

due to importance of harmonizing the required levels. On the other hand, Pillar 2 

(supervision, capital buffers, corporate governance and sanctions) is contemplated 

on CRD because of its discretionary nature “the links with national administrative 

laws are particularly important” in these matters (The European Commission, 

2013d). 

It is important to mention that Pillar 1 eliminates any discretions from Member 

States, to level the banking ground in the EU. However, under Pillar 2, Member 

States can increase the requirements in justifiable cases to cover for other risks, but 

can never decrease the requirements set in the first pillar. 

Institutions are also allowed to hold additional amount of capital, as they wish.  

 



 

 

33 

PILLAR 1 

- Capital requirements 

Regulatory capital is the amount of capital an institution is required to hold 

compared to the amount of assets, to cover for unexpected losses. In the CRR, this 

is called “own funds requirement” and is expressed as a percentage of risk weighted 

assets 29 . In this sense, capital ratio can increase either by increasing the capital 

through recapitalization or by reducing at least one of the components of the RWAs 

– either the value of the assets or their perceived risk (see figure 1). 

The requirements for this regulatory capital are very restrictive and only capital 

that is permanently available to absorb losses is qualified (The European 

Commission, 2013d). Therefore assets like goodwill, deferred tax assets, defined 

benefit pension fund assets and own shares must not be considered as regulatory 

capital since their value may be subject to changes during stressed circumstances.  

Both the CRR and Basel III share the same definition and requirements of capital 

as to internationally harmonize rules.  

There are three different layers of capital defined in the CRR/Basel III. Their 

constitution and ratios are comprised as follows30 (see figure 2): 

? Tier 1 Capital – must be at least 6% of risk-weighted assets at all times. 

? Common Equity Tier 1 – this tier is constituted by eligible capital, share 

premium, eligible reserves and positive retained earnings. To these 

elements is deducted the Goodwill, intangible assets, deferred taxes, 

minority interests, provisions and negative earnings. The CET1 capital 

must be at least 4.5% of risk-weighted assets at all times.  

? Additional Equity Tier 1 – this tier mainly includes eligible instruments 

issued by the institution that were not included in the CET 1 capital, 

                                                
29 The value of the perceived risk of an asset. 
30  This work did not extensively described each tier composition as that was not its main purpose. To better 
comprehend the constitution of each tier read (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2010). 



 

 

34 

such as preferred shares and hybrid instruments accounted for as 

equity. The Additional Tier 1 capital must be at least 1.5% of risk-

weighted assets at all times. 

? Tier 2 Capital – this tier mostly includes eligible subordinated debt and it 

must be at least 2% of risk-weighted assets at all times. 

 

Thus Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital plus Tier 2 Capital) must be at least 8.0% of 

risk-weighted assets at all times (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2010). 

As a rapid increase in capital requirements would affect the amount of loans and 

investments channelled from banks to the economy, conditioning economic growth, 

the conformity with these new rules will be phased-out from 1 January 2014 until 

2022. This extended transition period will allow credit institutions to gradually 

comply in an organic way (The European Commission, 2013d). 

 

- Liquidity requirements 

As formerly mentioned, due to the nature of their business, banks face liquidity 

shortage. However, to own assets that may be easily converted into cash without 

any material loss (Whittlesey, 1945) is important to ensure banks’ stability. 

Thus, the regulatory framework introduces two new liquidity ratios that function 

as a quantitative standard measure for liquidity buffers: the Liquidity Coverage 

Requirement (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Requirement (NSFR).  

The LCR aims at improving the short-term (over a thirty day period) resilience 

of the liquidity risk profile of financial institutions, while the NSFR purpose is to 

ensure that an institution has an acceptable amount of stable funding to support the 

institutions assets and activities over the medium term (over a one year period).  

Because these are new requirements, authorities set an observation period to 

properly calibrate the target values of the ratios as to maximize their effectiveness 

and minimize negative consequences that they can cause to the real economy. 



 

 

35 

These negative impacts to the economy occur via decrease of loans and 

investments provided as banks try to gather enough liquidity. 

 

- Leverage requirements31 

The required leverage ratio corresponds to the proportion of Tier 1 capital a bank 

owns over a measure of non-risk weighted items. If this ratio is considerably low it 

means that the institution has been financing its assets through debt and thus is 

highly leveraged. 

By setting a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio, authorities wish to limit the degree 

to which a bank is leveraging its capital base. Therefore, this measure aims at 

reducing excessive leverage to finance credits and also to level capital with the 

riskiness of the institutions’ assets. 

However, like the liquidity requirements, the leverage ratio is a new regulatory 

tool in the EU that, due to lack of information about its effectiveness and the 

consequences to the economy, was established under the Pillar 2, for discretionary 

use of authorities and institutions, while more information is being gathered. 

 

PILLAR 2 

- Capital buffers 

The CRR establishes five mandatory capital buffers that must be constituted after 

the basic requirements are assured: 

? Capital conservation buffer 

Institutions must retain, in the form of CET1 capital 2.5% of the total of their 

exposures as a capital buffer. This buffer also contemplates increasing capital 

distribution constraints (dividend and bonus payments) as banks experience losses 

and fall behind the 7% minimum CET1 capital requirements. This strategy requires 

                                                
31 This section is based on the European Commission MEMO/14/580 - Leverage Ratio Delegated Act: Frequently Asked 
Questions (The European Commission, 2014f). 



 

 

36 

institutions to hold more quality capital and, during periods of stress, prevents 

them from worsening their balance sheets by distributing capital.  

? Countercyclical buffer 

Buffers tend to be countercyclical – when the cycle is good banks should put aside 

capital so that when there is an economic downturn those savings can be drained. 

This buffer is specifically designed to take into account the macroeconomic 

factors with the purpose of stabilizing credit supply. This means that when the cycle 

is virtuous, credit institutions must constitute this buffer thus restraining the 

availability of credit and preventing it from becoming too cheap and creating a 

bubble. Inversely, when the cycle turns, banks are allowed to use the buffer whether 

it is to absorb losses or to continue lending to the real economy. 

The exact buffer rate will be calculated by NCAs based on a credit-to–GDP 

indicator. A Member State can require this buffer to be up to 2.5% of RWA, 

proportionately to the credit growth and the build-up of its risks. 

This buffer, like the capital conservation buffer, contemplates increasing capital 

distribution constraints if institutions are unable to fulfil the requirements.  

 

? Global systemic institution buffer 

This buffer started taking effect in 1 January 2016 and it is mandatory to banks 

appointed by the responsible authorities as of global systemic importance. The goal 

of this buffer is to decrease moral hazard from these institutions that may consider 

themselves “too big to fail”. The criteria to be considered systemically important 

includes size, cross border activities and interconnectedness - institutions that fulfil 

these standards are required to hold between 1% and 3.5% CET1 of RWAs. The 

Financial Stability Board’s provisional list of 28 G-SIFIs (global systemically 

important financial institutions) includes 14 EU institutions. 

 

 



 

 

37 

? Other systemically important institutions buffer 

This is an optional surcharge –up to 2% of RWAs - which NCAs may demand to 

important domestic institutions. This buffer started taking effect in 1 January 2016 

and must be fulfilled by CET1 capital. 

? Systemic risk buffer 

This is an optional buffer of CET1 Member States may introduce to some or to all 

national financial institutions to cover structural or systemic risks. Buffer rates until 

3% can be freely implemented, however for rates between 3% and 5 % Member 

States must notify the Commission, the EBA, and the ESRB and above the 5% 

threshold Member States need the approval of the Commission. 

 

- Corporate Governance  

The directive aims “at increasing the effectiveness of risk oversight by Boards” 

(The European Commission, 2013d) by incentivizing diversity in its constitution 

thus avoiding “group thinking”, improve risk management and supervision. 

First, institutions should have diversity in the board - different opinions and 

backgrounds to avoid group thinking, achieve higher risk oversight. Secondly, 

remuneration of professional risk takers32 should be designed as to diminish the 

incentives to excessive risk taking. The CRD structured some requirements like 

more than half of the variable remuneration should be given in equity-linked or 

other non-cash instruments and that the variable component of the total 

remuneration cannot exceed 100% of the fixed component and also a substantial 

portion of the variable remuneration component - at least 40% to 60% - should be 

deferred from three to five years. 

In addition, institutions are obliged to disclose their remuneration policy and 

practices for professional risk takers. 

                                                
32 Staff whose professional activity has a material impact in the i nstitution’s risk profile, like senior managers, risk 
takers or staff engaged in control functions. 



 

 

38 

- Ratings 

Capital requirements are calculated based on a percentage of the risk-weighted 

assets, however it is important to understand how the risk is perceived. A rating is 

attributed to the banks’ assets according to their perceived risk. This ranking can be 

assigned by a specialized institution (credit rating agencies - CRA’s) or by the bank 

itself. 

The problem of using CRA’s ratings is that banks do not fully understand the 

risks of a certain asset, which can cause them to be more risk taking. Also, banks’ 

dependency of these agencies is not desirable because CRA’s can make mistakes, as 

it happened in the market of securities in 2007. 

Therefore, the Commission found benefits in the reduction of the dependence on 

these external credit ratings, and is now requiring financial institutions to also 

assess their own assets instead of fully outsource that judgement. It is 

understandable that this procedure demands many resources so the new legislation 

only requires internal credit assessment when possible and especially in portfolios 

that are more exposed to risk. In case the internal assessment is more negative than 

the CARs’, institutions are forced to hold additional capital. 

3.2.1.2. Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGS)33  

The Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGS) was first issued in 1994, even 

though the level of deposit coverage has increased to a uniform amount of 100.000€, 

in 2010. This directive ensures that every Member State has a national DGS with the 

main objective of guaranteeing depositors’ protection as a way of preventing “bank 

runs”, possible contagion to other financial institutions and general distrust in the 

system. 

                                                
33 This section is based on the European Commission MEMO/14/296 - Deposit Guarantee Schemes – Frequently Asked 
Questions (The European Commission, 2014d) and on the European Commission MEMO/15/6153 - A European 
Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) – Frequently Asked Questions (The European Commission, 2015). 

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/bank/guarantee/index_en.htm


 

 

39 

In case a bank fails, each DGS safeguards 100.000 € of the aggregated accounts of 

a depositor, per bank. All individuals and enterprises are covered by the DGS, but 

not financial institutions and national authorities. Deposits in other currencies are 

also covered. 

On 24 November 2015, as a way of further weakening the link between banks 

and their national sovereigns and to increase trust in the system regardless of the 

bank’s location within the Union, the EC proposed the creation of the BU’s third 

pillar, the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) (The European Commission, 

2015). 

According to the Commission’s legislative proposal, the objective is to replace 

the national Deposits Guarantee Schemes, which can be vulnerable to local shocks, 

by a European level fund that is able to provide a uniform degree of insurance 

coverage. 

The EDIS will be managed by the Single Resolution and Deposits Insurance 

Board34 and the European Deposit Insurance Fund (EDIF) will be established in 

three phases. During the first three years of the fund, if a bank fails, the national 

DGS has to first exhaust all its funds before the EDIS can provide any support. In 

the second phase, which lasts four years, the national scheme does not have to be 

exhausted before it is able to access the EDIS, which will progressively support the 

resolution with larger shares of capital. After those seven years, the EDIS will fully 

insure deposits and would cover all liquidity needs and losses in the event of a pay-

out or resolution procedure. 

The EDIF will be financed beforehand by the European banking sector, with the 

target of 0.8% of the covered deposits in the EU (approximately € 43 billion), that 

should be fully collected by 2024. However, in case of disbursements from the fund 

                                                
34 “In the Commission's proposal, this role would be played by the existing Single Resolution Board (SRB), wi th an 
appropriately modified governance structure for its new DGS tasks. The Board would administer the Single 
Resolution Fund (SRF) and the European Deposit Insurance Fund together, thereby creating synergies when 
combining responsibilities for resolution and deposit insurance.” (The European Commission, 2015) 



 

 

40 

before that target is met, banks may be required to make extraordinary 

contributions or there may have to be an extension of the gathering period for four 

more years. These extensions will be carefully computed due to pro-cyclicality and 

deterioration of banks’ situation. 

Each bank will contribute directly to the fund in proportion to its risk exposure, 

as banks that accept more risk are more likely to fail and thus to activate the fund. 

The fund detained by the EDIS is not allowed to be used in the recovery process, 

as it is still unknown whether the institution will endure, and, in case it fails, the 

EDIS would still have to repay depositors. However they can be applied in the 

resolution procedures since the EDIS and the Single Resolution Mechanism share 

one common goal: to ensure the vital functions of the institution, such as payment 

systems and deposit availability. Yet, the Deposit Insurance Fund can only be used 

to resolve a bank when the costs of filling the money gap are less than paying out 

all the ensured deposits. 

3.2.2. Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM)35   

While the idea behind the SSM is to prevent bank failure, the SRM, as the second 

pillar of the BU, is triggered when banks are already facing difficulties. 

This mechanism represents the central institution responsible for applying the 

Bank Recover and Resolution Directive (BRRD), the legal framework in force 

whenever a bank needs to be recovered or has already past the point when recovery 

is possible and resolution is the solution that maximizes society’s welfare. Hence, 

the SRM assures a uniform recovery and resolution procedure that facilitates both 

processes, minimizing costs for taxpayers and to the real economy. 

                                                
35 This section is based on the European Commission MEMO/14/295 - A Single Resolution Mechanism for the Banking 
Union – Frequently Asked Questions (The European Commission, 2014f) 



 

 

41 

The mechanism relies on a fund – Single Resolution Fund (SRF) - administrated 

by a board – Single Resolution Board (SRB). Both elements are financed through 

two different contribution channels by banks in the Banking Union (European 

Commission, 2014f). 

The SRM started being applied in 1 January 2015. However the bail-in resolution 

tool, explained in Chapter 4, only began applying to all outstanding and newly issue 

debt in 1 January 2016 (The European Commission, 2014f). 

3.2.2.1. The Single Resolution Fund (SRF) 

The SRF will be gathered through the contribution of all banks in the BU, and to 

guarantee that these contributions do not have a negative impact on banks’ lending 

capacity to the real economy, they are being collected gradually, over a period of 8 

years, from 1 January 2016 until 2024. 

Similarly to the EDIF, the planned target of the fund is about 1% of the covered 

deposits of the Union, which, should amount approximately to €55 billion (The 

European Commission, 2014e). Thus, every year, the collective contributions should 

be around €6.8 billion (12.5% of the target level), but the fee is not equal between 

banks of the Union. Instead, the payments made by banks are proportional to the 

risk profile of the institution (The European Commission, 2014f). 

Nonetheless, these conditions may change as the banking industry evolves – if 

the value of the secured deposits grows so will the target value of the fund and thus 

of the contributions. Also, the fees for the fund may be extended for four more years, 

to a twelve years total, if eventual disbursements needed exceed half of the target 

size of the fund (The European Commission, 2014e). Furthermore, the managers of 

the fund reserve the right to demand additional financing, whether from the market 

or from the very banking industry. 

The SRB can allow the use of funds from the SRF but simply to cover up to 5% of 

the losses and only after bank’s shareholders and creditors have lost at least 8% of 



 

 

42 

their liabilities. And if, in case of an extraordinary event, these funds are not enough 

to cover the resolution, banks may resort to public support limited by the applicable 

rules on EU State aid (EU Regulation, 2014, Article 27, paragraph 7) (The European 

Commission, 2014e). 

Besides, the resolution fund cannot be used to recapitalise the failing institution, 

“the main use of the resolution funds will be limited to, for example, providing 

loans to a bridge institution, purchasing specific assets of an institution under 

resolution, guarantee certain assets or liabilities of the institution under resolution, 

or in exceptional circumstances – as mentioned above - contributing to loss 

absorption by replacing creditors who would have been bailed in” (The European 

Commission, 2014e). 

3.2.2.2. Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD)36 

The first principle of the BRRD is prevention and preparation - banks and 

authorities across the BU must be prepared for a possible crisis by having the means 

to quickly address early stage problems. To that end, all banks are required to 

prepare a recovery and resolution plan to deal with difficult times. 

The second principle of the directive consist in early intervention (recovery) of 

the institution and, in case that fails, its resolution. 

Early intervention – the process of recovery 

When an institution demonstrates the first signs of difficulties, such as a capital 

shortfall, a recovery and restructuring plan must be created and executed to 

guarantee the stability of the financial system. To implement the plan, a temporary 

administrator could be nominated to assist or replace the management executive. 

                                                
36 This section is based on the European Commission MEMO/14/297 - EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive 
(BRRD): Frequently Asked Questions (The European Commission, 2014e) 



 

 

43 

The initial recovery actions aim to recapitalize the institution, increase cash 

availability and decrease risk exposure. These actions may include “rights issues, a 

voluntary conversion of subordinated debt instruments into equity on the basis of 

a risk-related incentive, liability management exercises37 which should in principle 

be 100% capital generating, sales of capital-generating assets and portfolios, 

securitisation of portfolios in order to generate capital from non-core activities, or 

an earnings retention” (The European Commission, 2014e). 

The mentioned measures all come from the company itself or from the private 

sector. Recovery must first be financed by these means before any recapitalization 

can come from the write-down of shareholders, subordinated creditors or, as a last 

resort to cover the residual capital shortfall, from the public sector. Early 

interventions never require the contribution of senior debtholders, such as 

depositors. 

 

Resolution of the institution 

As previously mentioned, the BRRD offers a standardized path to deal with 

failing banks. 

In principle, fulfilling its role as supervisor, the ECB will be the first to detect a 

failing bank and to decide to resolve it. The Central Bank will immediately report 

the situation to the SRB that will decide the best course of action and prepare the 

resolution process. National authorities will also be involved in the decision and 

implementation process because they have a better understanding of the national 

jurisdiction and of the internal banking sector dynamics. 

The resolution process is initiated when it is the authorities’ belief that despite 

the institution’s attempts to recover in an admissible timeframe they have proven 

                                                
37 Activities that allow the institution to better adjust its level of debt, granting that the amount of assets remains 
above the amount of liabilities. These activities include deleveraging, debt restructuring – extensions on the 
debt terms and renegotiations of the interest rates-, bond redemptions or buybacks, debt equity swaps, and so 
on.

to be insufficient and the company is still failing (EU Regulation, 2014, Article 18). 

Therefore, actions to diminish the negative consequences of a bank failure must be 

taken.  

Yet, the resolution of a bank is a tool that must be used as a last resort because of 

the distortions it will cause in the economy. Authorities facing this decision have to 

choose the perfect moment to intervene because they do not want to interfere so 

soon as to create panic and so late that the resolution will not be efficient. 

Whereas in a solvency procedure of a regular company the main goal is to 

minimize the creditors’ losses, which can take years to solve, in a bank’s resolution 

process, due to the very essence of its industry, the goal is to have a rushed process 

which minimizes contagion, instability and losses for society. Therefore, this 

mechanism is designed to allow decisions to be taken quickly and efficiently, so that 

in 32 hours, usually over the weekend, the process is concluded, reducing the 

distortions to the economy.  

The ideal resolution of a bank is the one that safeguards vital banking operations 

(such as payment systems), protects depositors, client assets and public funds, at 

the same time it minimizes financial instability and destruction of value. Resolution 

authorities must take into consideration the purposes of the resolution, the balance 

sheet of the institution, its value, importance and the time available for the 

procedure as to choose the tool that better fits the situation (EU Regulation, 2014, 

Articles 14 and 22). 

There are four resolution tools (EU Regulation, 2014, Article 22). The first and the 

one that causes less distortion to the financial stability, is to sell all or any part of the 

bank to a purchaser from the private sector that is not a bridge institution – sale of 

business tool-, regardless of the shareholders consent (EU Regulation, 2014, Article 

24). Although preferable, this situation is only feasible if there are interested buyers. 

An example of this strategy is the acquisition of the failing NetBank by the ING 

Group, in 2007.  



 

 

45 

The second option is the bridge bank institution tool that consists in creating a 

bridge bank that absorbs all the essential functions of the bank while the institution 

is either liquidated or sold. The bridge bank is then eventually sold to the private 

sector (EU Regulation, 2014, Article 25). This strategy is usually preferred by the 

shareholders and debtholders because it allows a normal prolonged solvency 

process without affecting the general public. 

Thirdly, the asset separation tool consist in to transfer assets, rights and/or 

liabilities of an institution under resolution or a bridge institution to one or more 

asset management vehicles. Usually, this procedure involves dividing the failing 

institution into two separated ones –- , the “good” and the “bad” bank. The “good” 

bank would hold all of the clean assets while the other would retain all the toxic 

ones (EU Regulation, 2014, Article 26). This was the resolution applied in the 

Portuguese Banco Espírito Santo, which was split into the “good” bank - Novo 

Banco -, and the “bad” one which holds the initial name38. 

Finally, the fourth tool is the bail-in of creditors which started being enforced in 

1 January 2016 and it is going to be described in the next chapter.  

                                                
38 “Where the resolution tools have been used to transfer the systemically important services or viable business of an 
entity to a sound entity such as a private sector purchaser or bridge entity, the residual part of the entity should be 
liquidated” (EU Regulation, 2014, Paragraph 66).

Chapter 4. The bail-in resolution tool 

4.1. The legal framework 

 “An effective resolution regime should minimise the costs of the resolution of a 

failing entity borne by the taxpayers” (EU Regulation, 2014, Paragraph 73), through 

the allocation of those costs to the institutions’ investors. Bail-in is the mechanism 

used for the exercise of the write-down and conversion of liabilities of an institution 

under resolution (EU Regulation, 2014, Article 3, Paragraph 33). Therefore, losses 

are allocated to investors through the application of the bail-in tool. 

This tool is applicable in any resolution procedure, either the objective is to 

resolve the failing entity as a going concern, or to transfer systemically important 

services to a bridge entity or even to divide the institution under the asset separation 

tool framework. Therefore, the writing down and conversion of relevant capital 

instruments can be made on a stand-alone basis 39  or together with any of the 

remaining resolution tools (EU Regulation, 2014, Paragraph 74, Article 21 and 27). 

It is important to distinguish this resolution tool from contingent capital. Even 

though they appear similar, the latter is a security investors can purchase that is 

immediately converted into equity when the bank reaches a certain trigger40. While 

                                                
39  However, this tool can only be applied on a stand-alone basis if there are strong reasons to believe that its 
application, combined with other measures such as business reorganization, restores the entity to financial soundness 
and long-term viability. Any of the remaining resolution tools shall apply, as appropriate, when these conditions are 
not met. (EU Regulation, 2014, Article 27, paragraph 2) 
40 Usually the trigger is a standardized dangerously low level of capital base. 



 

 

48 

the bail-in consists in a mandatory conversion of the credit institution’s liabilities in 

an amount equal to its losses, applied by the resolution authorities when the 

institution is falling (Conlon &amp;amp; Cotter, 2014) 

When the bail-in procedure applies, the write-down or conversion must follow a 

certain order (EU Regulation, 2014, Paragraph 77, Article 17 and 21). Creditors of 

the institution under resolution bear losses after the shareholders in accordance 

with the reverse order of priority of their claims: first any contractual contingent 

capital instruments, then subordinated debt, and finally unsecured senior debt. 

Also creditors of the same class are treated in an equitable manner.  

The write-down or conversion will not apply to insured deposits, liabilities 

backed by assets or collateral, liabilities such as salaries, pensions or taxes or short-

term inter-bank lending. And, in case there is a need to write-down or convert 

uninsured depositors (deposits above the coverage level of 100.000€), depositors 

preference will be applied for deposits held by natural persons and small and 

medium enterprises (SME). 

Despite all, the resolution process obeys to the “no creditor worse off” principle 

which postulates that no creditor “should be worse off under resolution than it 

would have been had the bank been wound up under applicable insolvency law 

proceedings” (European Commission, 2014e). Besides, individuals and enterprises 

that perceive the written-down of their assets as an illegal decision may, through 

legal proceedings, require compensation for damages. 

4.2. The benefits and disadvantages 

Besides the advantages already mentioned as reasons why the EC has decided to 

enforce the bail-in tool, like to end the negative cycle between banks and their 



 

 

49 

sovereigns and to dissolve the moral hazard of companies that believe that they are 

“too big to fail”, there are more benefits. 

The bail-in tool incentivizes investors’ supervision of the bank’s activities since 

now they are directly affected by the entity’s behaviour. So, it is expected that these 

institutions become more disciplined and more moderated when taking risks and 

increasing their leverage, making them more resilient, increasing the financial 

stability which in turn will result in a positive impact for society. 

However, this tool also has disadvantages that cannot be overlooked. As 

investors perceive that it is now riskier to finance credit institutions it is expected 

that banks’ cost of funding will increase by 4.7-15 basis points while non-financial 

firms’ cost of capital should increase by 3.29-10.5 bp (The European Commission, 

2012). 

Yet, even though individuals and SME should expect an increase in their funding 

costs which tends to lead to the reduction of investment, consumption and so of the 

economic growth (Zhou, J., 2012)., the European Commission states that this should 

be seen as a sign of the effectiveness of the reforms that will lead to a safer, more 

transparent and stable financial system (The European Commission, 2014a). 

Another inconvenience of the tool is that all the mentioned reforms may lead to 

an increase in regulatory arbitrage - finding legal ways to get around restrictions 

imposed by laws (Gup, 2011, pp 44). In this way, credit institutions may be 

preparing themselves to restructure their balance sheets as to prevent their 

liabilities from being eligible to be subjected to the bail-in tool, reducing the 

effectiveness of this measure. 

So credit institutions may shift from contracting senior debt, which is now more 

expensive, to hire short-term and secured borrowing at a lower funding cost, thus 

reducing the amount of liabilities eligible for write-down or conversion in the bail-

in process, which may cause the bail-in to be insufficient to restore the institution 

back to being profitable (Zhou, J., 2012). 



 

 

50 

For this reason, the EC is already working on the implementation of the 

minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), expressed as 

a percentage of the total liabilities and own funds of the entity, as a way to ensure 

that the bail-in tool will be effective.  (The European Commission, 2015). 

Another problem with great expression is that this tool is not capable of offsetting 

the contagion risk that arises from one struggling institution. In other words, when 

the bail-in tool is applied in one bank, the write-down of its liabilities will cause 

losses to other financial institutions that are debtholders of the failed one. This 

suggest that the bail-in of one institution may end up shifting risk to other parts of 

the financial sector. Thus, authorities must be aware of the potential effects on the 

balance sheets of other banks when applying the bail-in resolution (Zhou, J., 2012).. 

The final issue with this tool is the ambiguity of the conditions that trigger the 

resolution. Although the SRM discloses some qualitative guidance regarding when 

institutions should be resolved it lacks explicit quantitative measures. This situation 

causes uncertainty to investors, which may require higher funding costs to cover 

the risk, and allows discretion for regulators, leading to legal inconsistencies. 

This matter could be solved with the creation of a trigger linked to the entity’s 

balance sheet ratios, like those applied in contingent capital. This would increase 

transparency and predictability in the procedure and avoid the risk of only applying 

the resolution when the institution is already insolvent (Zhou, J., 2012).

Chapter 5. The bail-in of Banco Espírito Santo 

5.1. What happened to BES?41 

With more than 145 years Banco Espírito Santo (BES) had over 2 million clients 

and ten thousand employees across Portugal and twenty other countries. It was the 

third largest bank in Portugal with a considerable market share and especial focus 

on the institutional financial sector42.  

The institution’s shares were traded at NYSE Euronext Lisbon and its supervisor 

was Banco de Portugal. The products and services it provided included deposit-

taking, lending to the private sector, management of investment funds, brokerage 

services, investment banking services and the selling of life and non-life insurances. 

Besides that, it conducted investments of short, medium and long term in the 

financial and foreign exchange markets as a way to take advantage of price 

fluctuations or to have a return on the available financial resources. 

BES was part of a group, GBES (Grupo Banco Espírito Santo), which in turn is 

held by a much bigger group, GES (Grupo Espiríto Santo). While the holding GBES 

is only constituted by financial institutions, GES also sustains companies in 

                                                
41 This section is based on (Banco Espírito Santo, S.A., 2014) and (Saraiva, 2015). 
42 Regarding to credit to SME BES had a 19% market share in Portugal. 



 

 

52 

diversified businesses - health, tourism, Real Estate, energy, construction, mining 

and others. 

The links inside GES are complex and highly intricate (see figure 3), with 

companies located in different countries and subject to different legislations thus 

hindering supervision and allowing financial reporting discretion. The excessive 

exposure of BES to its group was the main cause of its failure (see Table 3). 

On 30 July 2014, BES presented the first semester’s financial statements where it 

disclosed losses of 3.577 Mil €. This was an unexpected situation since on 10 July the 

bank informed its stakeholders that it estimated losses on the order of 1.500 Mil €, 

that would be completely offset by its 2.100 Mil € capital buffer and still allowing it 

to fulfil the capital requirements43. 

However the capital buffer was not sufficient to compensate the actual losses that 

arose from specific and non-recurring events that occurred during the semester as 

a result from the exposure of BES to its Group, GES. These exceptional events 

included the accounting of impairments44 and provisions45 in the amount of 4.253,5 

Mil €: 2.131 Mil € were constituted as credit provisions, 186 Mil € were considered 

as impairments due to losses in share titles, 94 Mil € due to losses in Real Estate, 25 

Mil € as losses in supplementary capital and 1.818 Mil €as losses in other assets and 

contingencies. If these events had not occurred the net income of the institution 

would have been negative by 255.4 Mil €, which only represents a decrease of 7% 

(17.49 Mil €) comparing to the 2013’s net income (see Table 4 and 5). 

                                                
43 The results of BES reflected acts of harmful management and violations of levels set by BdP for exposure to its own 
group. After its failure the Portuguese Parliament opened a formal investigation to the executive of BES and GES. This 
inquiry was performed by Comissão Parlamentar de Inquérito, a committee composed by parliament deputies, who 
tried to uncover the real and accurate facts in an objective and non-partisan form. However, the purpose of this paper 
is not to find whether this case was or not a case of criminal management but rather to empirically apply the bail -in 
resolution tool. 
44 According to the financial report of the bank, an impairment is created when there is an objective evidence of an 
event that has a negative impact on its recoverable amount and that amount can be reasonably estimated. 
45 According to the financial report of the bank, provisions are created when the Group has a legal liability, likely to 
be executed and which the amount is able to be reasonably estimated. 



 

 

53 

Besides that, GBES was highly exposed to its group’s non-financial companies 

(the entities of GES not integrated on GBES) because of granted loans, guarantees46 

and debt underwriting provided by GBES to GES. The problem was that these non-

financial companies of GES were extremely weakened which forced the constitution 

of a 2 M€ provision to safeguard the exposure in case of default.  

The elevated deficit caused BES’ Common Equity Tier I to decrease to 5.1% (see 

Table 6), thus falling behind the capital requirements requested by the Portuguese 

Central Bank (BdP) by 1.9 p.p.. Consequently, the day after the disclosure of BES’ 

results, the ECB informed BdP and BES that the bank was going to be suspended as 

a counterpart of the Eurosystem, starting on 1 august 2014, due to lack of solvency. 

This would have had as an immediate result the suspension of the bank’s access to 

the Eurosystem’s liquidity and the mandatory return of a credit granted by the 

Eurosystem to the institution, in the amount of 10.000 M€. In practical terms this 

meant that, due to lack of solvency, the bank would have had to suspend its 

activities and enter a liquidation process causing huge systemic risks and financial 

instability. 

Despite that, the Portuguese Central Bank was able to postpone the suspension 

until 4 August under the condition of resolving the bank during the weekend, in 

time for the markets’ opening on Monday. Facing the possibility of one of the largest 

banks in Portugal being liquidated, BdP had no other choice but to resolve BES. 

The resolution measures considered by BdP were, by order, private 

recapitalization, public recapitalization, nationalization, the application of one of 

the resolution tools and finally liquidation47. 

                                                
46 According to the financial report of the bank, financial guarantees are contracts that compel its issuer to compensate 
the other part for losses incurred due to non-compliance of the contractual terms of debt instruments. 
47  It is important to underline that this resolution measure occurred in 2014 whereas the bail -in enforcement began in 
January 2016. 



 

 

54 

The first plan, to recapitalize BES with private capital, was not feasible because 

when the difficult situation of BES was disclosed, the bank was unable to find 

private investors willing to either recapitalize it or acquire it. 

The second and third options, injection of public funds or nationalization of the 

bank, required the intervention of the State. However, since the Crisis 

Communication in 2013, any use of public funds to aid a financial institution in 

distress is subject to the EC’s approval and can only be applied in institutions that 

can prove long term viability and providing that the principle of burden sharing is 

satisfied. 

Thus, these two possible resolutions where not feasible as the EC’s approval 

could not be obtained in the timeframe provided by the ECB for the resolution of 

BES, preventing the State from financing the bank. Besides, to provide financial aid 

was never the Government’s will for there were righter alternatives that would 

better safeguard the taxpayers given that the State had already assumed elevated 

costs in previous bank resolutions. 

The fifth option, liquidation, was going to occur either way with the suspension 

of BES as a counterpart of the Eurosystem. This would have had implied that the 

bank would have had to immediately interrupt its services and activities so that, 

through legal proceedings, all of the entity’s assets would have been sold in order 

to satisfy its creditors. Usually these legal proceedings are long, highly costly and 

cause value destruction. Besides, the Deposits Guarantee Fund would have had to 

be activated to safeguard depositors’ money, which would have had increased the 

costs borne by other financial institutions. This would have spread fear and 

uncertainty across the Portuguese banking sector, damaging the real economy.  

The fourth option included the use of one of the resolution tools covered in 

Chapter 3 – sale of business, bridge bank institution and the asset separation tool. 

In fact, BdP applied the asset separation tool which according to Carlos Costa, 

Governor of BdP, in a hearing to the CPI, was not a destructive measure, but rather 



 

 

55 

a way to preserve the financial stability, for that is the primary duty of BdP. The 

Governor also stated that the adopted solution was the only capable of fixing the 

situation in the short period of time given by the Eurosystem and at the same time 

protect depositors, taxpayers and the financial system. 

This resolution was one of the firsts of its kind in the European Union and it 

involved the creation of a new financial institution, Novo Banco, which would 

absorb BES’ non-toxic assets and liabilities that were not bounded to GES, allowing 

the uninterrupted activity of its services and diminishing inconveniences for its 

customers. In the meantime, BES would enter a judicial liquidation process, 

remaining unable to carry out any banking activity, while all of its assets and 

liabilities, not transferred to Novo Banco, are executed. 

However, this resolution measure required both the intervention of the State and 

of the Resolution Fund because during the establishment of Novo Banco, BdP 

identified a capital shortage of 4.900 Mil €. This deficiency would have to be covered 

by the Portuguese Resolution Fund, gathered by the national banking system, in its 

role of financial sponsor of the resolution measures of credit institutions. Yet the 

Fund had been opened in 2012 and it did not own the means to do so. 

Therefore, the Resolution Fund had to request two loans, one from the 

Portuguese government of 3.900 Mil €48 and another from a syndicate of eight banks 

in the amount of 700 Mil € - the remaining 300 Mil € would be set by the Fund. 

In this sense, the Resolution Fund is the only capital owner of this new institution, 

even though the purpose is to restructure the shareholders’ base with private 

investors and thus reimburse the Fund and consequently its lenders.

5.2. The bail-in exercise 

The purpose of this exercise is to understand in practical terms how the bail-in is 

applied and which are the main differences between its application and the 

resolution procedure that was actually carried out. 

All the data used in this exercise was retrieved from Bankscope49 and from the 

institution’s financial report of the first semester of 2014 (Banco Espírito Santo, S.A., 

2014). The data collected follows the IFRS accounting regulations and represents the 

consolidated statements of the entity thus reflecting assets, liabilities and income 

statements of itself and of its subsidiaries50. The values are expressed in millions of 

euros, except when stated otherwise. 

Since there is no quantitative bail-in trigger defined yet by the competent 

authorities, for the purpose of this analysis and with the data available, it is going 

to be used the entity’s last balance sheet available from the first semester of 2014. 

The methodology will be the subsequent: 

- This exercised was designed so that the debt write down would absorb all 

losses (Loss Absorption) and the conversion into equity would recapitalize the 

entity, allowing it to continue as a going concern (Recapitalization); 

- The write-down or conversion was not applied to secured liabilities, 

liabilities backed by assets or collateral, liabilities such as salaries, pensions or taxes 

or short-term inter-bank lending; 

- The eligible liabilities for bail-in in the exercise are subordinated debt and the 

senior debt; 

                                                
49 https://bankscope.bvdinfo.com/version-201629/home.serv?product=scope2006  
50 Entities controlled by the institution, meaning that is the Group is exposed to modifications in the report ed income 
of these institutions. 

https://bankscope.bvdinfo.com/version-201629/home.serv?product=scope2006


 

 

57 

- The write-down or conversion followed a sequential bail-in model instead of 

a pro-rata one51; 

- The assets were considered stable and so were the risk-weighted assets; 

- The write-down and conversion was applied in accordance to the following 

(DG Internal Market, 2011): 

? Loss absorption (by order): 

a)52 the principal amount of Additional Tier 1 instruments that are liabilities 

and Tier 2 instruments are written-down; 

b) 53  if the write-down in point (a) is less than the required amount, the 

principal amount of subordinated debt that is not Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 

capital is reduced to the extent required; 

c)54 if the total reduction of liabilities in points (a) and (b) is less than the 

required amount, the principal amount of senior debt is reduced to the extent 

required; 

d)55 if the total reduction of liabilities in points (a), (b) and (c) is less than the 

required amount, the Resolution Fund should cover the remaining. 

?  Recapitalization: 

e)56 Since the resolution fund cannot be used for recapitalization purposes 

of a failing institution, all the recapitalization burden will be allocated to the 

debtholders. 

                                                
51 The sequential bail-in implies that the same rank of investors is completely written-down before the next rank can 
experience losses. The pro-rata bail-in model implies that losses are proportionally allocated to all the ranks eligible 
for bail-in. 
52 The write-down of Additional Tier 1 liabilities and Tier 2 instruments in the exercise implied the write-off of all 
subordinated debt eligible for Tier II capital. The amount of the write-off is deducted from the subordinated creditors 
account and credited in the earnings account. 
53  The write-down of the principal amount of subordinated debt in the exercise implied the write-off of all 
subordinated debt non-eligible for Tier II capital. The amount of the write-off is deducted from the subordinated 
creditors account and credited in the earnings account.  
54 The write-down of the principal amount of senior debt in the exercise implied a write-down of senior debt according 
to the assumption (H1, H2, H3). The amount of the write-down is deducted from the senior creditors account and 
credited in the earnings account. 
55  The use of resources from the Resolution Fund to cover the remaining losses is accounted as a debit in the 
institution’s deposit account and credited in the earnings account. 
56 The conversion of senior debt to other instruments is deducted from the senior creditors account and credited in the 
respective account (pref. shares and hybrid capital accounted for as Equity and subordinated debt). 



 

 

58 

 The exercise was performed three times following three different assumptions 

(Table 1): 

- H1 – the bank’s investors (subordinated debtholders and senior 
debtholders) would have had to sustain all the losses and recapitalization 

expenses; 

- H2 – the bank’s investors would have had to sustain all recapitalization 
expenses and the write-down of 8% of their assets, while the Resolution Fund 

would have assumed the remaining losses; 

- H3 – the bank’s investors would have had to sustain all recapitalization 
expenses and half of the losses, while the Resolution Fund assumes the other half.

5.2.1. Loss absorption (LA) 

During the first semester of 2014, BES incurred in losses in the amount of 3.577 Mil 

€. The three hypothesis demonstrate possible solutions, following the procedures 

previously mentioned, for the write-down of liabilities as to absorb this loss. 

In H1, the bank’s investors would have been forced to cover the entire loss. To this 

end, they would have needed to write-down 29% of their assets to cover for the entire 

loss. Subordinated debtors would have been completely written-off, whereas senior 

debt holders would have been written-down by 23%. 

In H2, investors would have been required to write-down only 8% of their assets 

which represents 28% of the total loss - subordinated debtors would have been 

completely written-off, whereas senior debt holders would have been written-down 

by 0.2%. The remaining 72% of the losses would have been allocated to the Resolution 

Fund. 

In fact, under the current framework of the SRM, the SRF is only able cover up to 

5% of the losses after the write-down of 8% of the eligible liabilities. However, the 

exercise was prepared like this to allow a straightforward comparison with the 

resolution that in fact occurred. 

As previously mentioned, the resolution of BES required a recapitalization of 4.900 

Mil €, in NB, by the Portuguese Resolution Fund. If the original resolution would 

have demanded the write-down of 8% of investors’ assets, the fund would have had 

to inject in BES only 53% of what it actually did. 

But to perform a more accurate analysis on the costs incurred by taxpayers it is 

important to examine the financing sources of the fund.

As to achieve the 4.900 Mil € needed, the fund exhausted all of its funds (300 Mil 

€), requested a loan from a syndicate of eight national banks (700 Mil €) and another 

from the Portuguese Government (3.900 Mil €).  

Assuming that the government was the final source of funding, it is possible to 

conclude that the Resolution Fund and the bank syndicate would have had the same 

costs in H2 as they had in the original resolution. However the State would only have 

had to lend 41% of the funds it actually lent. 

In H3, both investors and the RF would have been liable for an equal amount of 

losses. Here, investors would have been written-down by 14% of their assets - 

subordinated debtors would have been completely written-off, whereas senior debt 

holders would have been written-down by 7% -, while the fund would have covered 

the rest of the losses. 

Again, under the current framework of the SRM, the SRF would only cover up to 

5% of the losses. However it is possible to conclude that had this been the resolution 

process chosen investors would have sustained half of the losses and the Resolution 

Fund would have only financed 37% of what it actually did.

Analysing the segmentation of creditors of the fund, it is possible to conclude that 

the Resolution Fund and the bank syndicate would have had the same costs, but the 

State would only have had to lend 20% of the funds it actually lent. 

5.2.2. Recapitalization from senior debtors 

The recapitalization process is common to all the approaches since debtholders, 

under the new regulatory framework of bail-in resolution, are the only ones who can 

recapitalize a failing institution (see Table 7 and 8).  

The conversion of debt into equity cannot be considered as a loss for debtholders 

since the purpose of that conversion is to restore the entity’s viability. In principle, 

debtholders that convert into equity their assets will only face a change in their 

ranking within the institution. 

During the first semester of 2014, BES’ Common Equity Tier I ratio (see Table 4 

and 5) fell behind the capital requirements requested by the Portuguese Central Bank 

(BdP) by 1.9 p.p.. The Tier I and Tier II ratios were also lower than the current EC’s 

requirements of respectively 1.5% and 2%. Considering the risk-weighted assets as 

constant, it is possible to compute the amount of additional preferred shares and 

subordinated debt needed for the bank to meet the basic capital requirements set by 

the supervisors. 

In total, senior debtholders would have needed to convert into equity instruments 

28% of their assets to recapitalize the bank. If this recapitalization would have been 

performed in June 2014, in conjunction with the absorption of the loss, the institution 

would have fulfilled the capital requirements set by the supervisors and probably 

would not have been suspended as a counterpart of the Eurosystem, event that 

triggered its resolution.

5.2.3. Comments on the results 

Assuming that this bail-in exercise would have led to the institution’s long-term 

viability, any of the hypothesis (H1, H2 and H3) would have meant significant less 

costs to taxpayers than the original solution57. Even in the worst case scenario in 

which the Fund would have had to bear 72% of the losses (H2), the State would only 

had to finance 40% of the costs that it actually did. 

Besides, even if the debtholders would have had to cover all the losses, they 

would only have to sustain 28% of losses in their assets. Which can be considered a 

fair price to pay as to assure the financial stability and the viability of the institution. 

Besides, in ailing firms from other sectors, investors bear all the costs of their 

recovery, so it is only reasonable that banks’ investors support some of the costs of 

their financial institutions’ recovery.  

                                                
57 Even though the Portuguese Government aid was a loan, the fact is that the interest rates paid by the Resolution 
Fund do not constitute an earning for taxpayers as the Fund is a public institution (Alves, Peixoto, Simões, &amp;amp; Moitinho, 
2015). In other words, the State lent itself money.

Conclusions 

After the last decade’s financial events, the European Commission has 

introduced several measures to improve supervision and regulation, on a European 

level, in the banking sector. Among those measures, was the enforcement of the 

bail-in tool whenever a financial institution is resolved. 

The purpose of this paper was to describe this new regulation and to demonstrate 

how it could be applied in a real case – BES. Besides, its implementation to this bank 

allowed a comparison with the resolution that was in fact applied. 

The exercise consisted in the write-down and conversion of eligible liabilities so 

that the institution could be restored to viability. There were three possibilities 

considered, the first was to allocate all the burden of the resolution process to the 

institution’s investors, the second was to apply the framework currently in force 

that states that the Resolution Fund can bear some costs of the resolution after 

investors have sustained 8% of losses in their assets. Finally, the third hypothesis 

was that the costs of loss absorption would be divided equally between the 

investors and the Resolution Fund. 

The results of this exercise suggest that the application of the bail-in to BES would 

have granted, in the worst case scenario, savings for the Portuguese State of about 

60%. In addition, it was observed that it would have been sufficient that the 

investors of the entity had sustained losses of 28%, in order for the bank not to need 

an intervention. 



 

 

66 

Of course that there are some limitations to these findings. First, this is an 

academic exercise unable to predict whether the institution could be restored back 

to viability, even if the bail-in was applied. Besides, to complete the resolution 

process the management of BES would have had to be replaced and a restructuring 

and business reorganisation plan would have had to be executed. 

Another setback was the general information provided by BES and Bankscope 

that lacked detailed financial classification of items in the balance sheet. Without 

this discrimination, the bail-in had to be roughly applied without taking in 

consideration aspects like the maturities of certain liabilities or the amount of 

written-off debt that belonged to other Portuguese banks to allow the quantification 

of the contagion. 

Overall, the bail-in tool is a beneficial measure that is going to relieve Member 

States and their taxpayers from the burden of aiding ailing financial institutions, 

and also to increase discipline in the sector. 

A very interesting further investigation on this topic would be to study the 

changes that are occurring in European banks’ balance sheets as a result of the 

reforms in the sector and its influence in the real economy.
