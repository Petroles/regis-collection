RESUMO.- [Efeitos das fontes de cálcio na dieta de 
gatos adultos sobre parâmetros urinários e equilíbrio 
ácido-básico.] O cálcio (Ca) é um macroelemento que 
faz parte da composição mineral da dieta de animais de 
companhia. Este macroelemento é considerado um cátion 
de forte capacidade alcalinizante e, de acordo com a fonte e 
quantidade inclusa, pode aumentar o pH urinário. Os sais de 
cálcio têm diferentes solubilidades e dependendo do ânion ao 
qual o cálcio está associado, pode ser mais ou menos absorvido 
e assim, alterar o pH da urina. O objetivo deste estudo foi 
avaliar os efeitos de duas fontes de cálcio na alcalinização 
do pH urinário, bem como a excreção de eletrólitos urinários

Calcium is a macroelement that is part of the mineral composition of the diet of companion 
animals, and is considered a cation of strong alkalizing power, increasing urinary pH. Calcium 
salts have different solubilities and depending on the anion to which calcium is associated 
with, it can be more or less absorbed, modifying the pH of the urine. The aim of this study 
was to evaluate the efficiency of calcium sources on alkalinization of urinary pH, as well as 
excretion of urinary electrolytes and acid-base balance of adult cats. An extruded diet for cats 
was selected, and had 160mEq/kg of calcium from the sources of either calcium carbonate 
(CaCO3) or calcium gluconate (C12H22CaO14) added. In the control treatment there was no 
addition of calcium sources, resulting in three treatments. Nine adult cats were used, mixed 
breed, in two experimental periods, with six replicates per treatment. Animal average age 
was 4±1.3 years old and average weight was 3.96±0.71kg. The cats remained in metabolic 
cages for an adaptation period of seven days, followed by six days of urine total collection, 
with volume, density, pH and calcium concentration (g/d) measurements. The acid-base 
balance was studied by blood gas analysis of venous blood. The two sources of calcium 
alkalinized the urine (P&lt;0.001). However, calcium gluconate had less alkalinization power 
compared to the calcium carbonate (P&lt;0.05). Urinary calcium was not affected by treatments, 
and represented less than 0.5% of calcium intake. The experiment showed that calcium, 
although an alkaline cation and considered strong influencer of the EB of the diet, cannot 
be evaluated individually, because depending on its associated anion it may have greater or 
lesser influence on cats urine pH.

e o equilíbrio ácido-básico de felinos. Foi selecionada uma 
dieta extrusada para gatos e adicionados 160mEq/kg de 
cálcio das fontes carbonato de cálcio (CaCO3) ou gluconato 
de cálcio (C12H22CaO14). No tratamento controle, não houve 
adição de fontes de cálcio. Foram utilizados nove gatos adultos, 
de raças mistas, em dois períodos experimentais, com seis 
repetições por tratamento. Os animais apresentavam idade 
média de 4,0±1,3 anos e peso corporal médio de 3,96±0,71kg. 
Estes permaneceram em gaiolas metabólicas em período de 
adaptação durante sete dias, seguido de coleta total de urina 
durante seis dias. Nestas amostras foram aferidos o volume, 
densidade, pH e concentração de cálcio (g/d). O equilíbrio 
ácido-básico foi avaliado por hemogasometria em amostras 
de sangue venoso. As duas fontes de cálcio alcalinizaram a 
urina (P&lt;0,001). No entanto, o gluconato de cálcio apresentou 
menor potencial de alcalinização em comparação ao carbonato 
de cálcio (P&lt;0,05). O cálcio urinário não foi afetado pelos 
tratamentos e representou menos de 0,5% da ingestão de 
Ca. O experimento demonstrou que o cálcio, apesar de ser 
um cátion alcalinizante e influenciador do EB da dieta, não 
pode ser avaliado individualmente, porque dependendo do 
ânion associado, pode apresentar maior ou menor influência 
no pH da urina de gatos.

INTRODUCTION
Nutrition, through the manipulation of the electrolytic 
composition modifies the base excess of dietary (BE), which 
is a mEq difference between cations, such as calcium, and 
anions, calculated with predictive equations (Jeremias et 
al. 2013). BE can alter urinary pH (Allen &amp;amp; Kruger 2000), 
and changes in urine pH are, in fact, due to the impact of 
the cations and anions balance on the acid-base state of the 
animals (Pizzorno et al. 2010).

Urolithiasis in dogs and cats has been much studied in 
recent years and management of this disorder is evolving, 
with nutrition being a keystone for the management of 
these animals (Jeremias et al. 2013, Lulich et al. 2016), since 
diet influences urinary pH, and it has a strong influence on 
certain types of urolith formation (Bartges &amp;amp; Callens 2015, 
Bartges 2016).

The cations that most influence urinary pH are calcium 
(Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na) and potassium (K), and 
the anions are phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), and chlorine (Cl) 
(Block 1984). Thus, calcium is part of the mineral composition 
of the diet and is considered a cation of strong alkalizing 
power, increasing urinary pH by altering BE (Dibartola 2006). 
Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is considered a strong dietary 
alkali (Kienzle et al. 1991), however other chemical forms of 
calcium, such as calcium sulfate, present cation-anion balance 
close to zero and may have lower effects on the acid-base 
status of animals.

Kienzle et al. (1991) and Pastoor et al. (1994a) obtained 
discrepant results regarding the action of calcium as a urinary 
alkalinizer. They observed that the addition of CaCO3 raised 
urinary pH, unlike calcium chloride (CaCl2), which acidified the 
pH. The acidifying effect of calcium chloride is due to the fact 
that calcium is less absorbed than chloride and urinary chloride 

excretion decreases the excretion of bicarbonate and increases 
ammonium, acidifying the urinary pH (Pastoor et al. 1994a).

Thus, considering that the effect of calcium on urinary pH 
is apparently influenced by the composition of calcium salts, 
and based on the need for new approaches and adequate 
information on the storage potential of each mineral source 
to make the right decision during cat food formulation, the 
present study evaluated the efficiency of two calcium sources 
on alkalinization of urinary pH, as well as excretion of urinary 
electrolytes and acid-base balance of adult cats.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement. The experiment was conducted at the Laboratory 

of Research on Nutrition and Nutritional Diseases of Dogs and Cats, 
São Paulo State University, Jaboticabal, Brazil, in compliance with 
procedures approved by the Ethics Research Committee for Animal 
Welfare of the College of Agrarian and Veterinary Sciences, São Paulo 
State University (protocol number 017648/11).

Animals and experimental design. Eighteen healthy adult 
mixed-breed cats aged 5±1.4 years and with 3.96±0.71kg of body 
weight. The experiment was conducted with 2 groups and each group 
of 9 cats received three diets in a randomized complete block design 
(3 cats/diet in each group), resulting in 6 cats/diet. The blocking 
factors were body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS) and age. 
About 3.21g Ca/kg (+160mEq/kg) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) 
or calcium gluconate (C12H22CaO14) were added to a dry diet for 
cats with BE around -140mEq/kg. In the control diet, no calcium 
source was added. All diets were pelleted and their nutritional level 
was similar (Table 1), all being within recommendations for adult 
cat maintenance (AAFCO 2008). Calcium sources were added by 
replacing corn starch.

Cats belonged to the same laboratory colony, and their health 
was assessed prior to the beginning of the survey by clinical and 
hematologic examination, as well as by urine analysis. The animals 
were kept in individual stainless steel metabolic cages (90x80x90cm) 
equipped with a system to separate faeces and urine. Cats were fed 
once daily (8h00) and the metabolizable energy (ME) of diets was 
calculated from their chemical composition. The amount of food 
supplied was calculated as 130kcal ME per kg0.4 (NRC 2006). Water 
was provided ad libitum, and food was offered ad libitum until the 
next meal. Food intake was daily measured by weighing offered 
food and refusal amounts.

Urine analysis. Diet adaptation occurred from days 1 to 7, and 
the following 6 days were used for total urine collection, in two 
periods. In the first period (days 8-10), urine was collected twice 
daily in plastic containers with 0.1g of thymol (0.1g per 100mL of 
urine) and kept refrigerated (4°C). Immediately after collection, urine 
volume was measured, as well as urine density with a refractometer 
(model T2-N3, ATAGO CO., LTD, Tokyo, Japan), and pH with a pH meter 
(model DM20, DIGIMED, São Paulo, Brazil). The urine collected in 24h 
was maintained frozen. The urine produced in 72h was mixed and 
evaluated for sodium (mmol/L) and potassium (mmol/L) using an 
ion-selective method (AVL unit - OMNI4, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) 
determined by mercuric thiocyanate methodology (Labtest, Minas 
Gerais, Brazil) followed by spectrophotometry.

In the second period (days 11-13), urine was collected twice 
daily in plastic containers with HCl 6N (2mL per 100mL of urine) 
and kept refrigerated (4°C). This measure has been reported to 
reduce the urinary pH to about 1-2, preventing the formation of 
crystals (Griyth &amp;amp; Dunn (1978). Calcium (mg/dL), phosphorus 
(mg/dL), magnesium (mg/dL) and sulfur (g/L) were measured in

Effect of calcium sources in the diets of adult cats on urinary parameters and acid-base balance

urine produced in 72h. Calcium quantification was analyzed using 
colorimetric method (CPC - cresolphthalein, calcium Liquiform, 
Minas Gerais, Brazil), and magnesium by the colorimetric method 
(Magon sulfonate, magnesium Liquiform, Minas Gerais, Brazil).

Faecal score. Faecal score was always determined by the same 
researcher, according to a scale from 1 to 5, as follows: 1 = watery 
(liquid, can be poured from a container); 2 = soft, unshaped stool 
(assumes the shape of the container); 3 = soft, shaped, and moist 
stool; 4 = firm, shaped, dry stool (remains firm and soft); 5 = hard, 
dry pellets (small, hard masses) (De-Oliveira et al. 2008).

Blood gas analysis. After 13d of diet consumption, 0.5mL of 
venous blood was collected from the medial saphenous vein without 
compression, at 08:00 am (before feeding) and 02:00 pm (six hours 
after feeding). Before blood was collected, the syringe was washed 
out with a heparin solution, leaving the dead-space filled. Blood was 
immediately analyzed for pH, sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, 
partial pressure of carbon dioxide, bicarbonate, base excess and 
osmolality using Omini C Blood Gas Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, 
Indianapolis, USA).

Chemical analysis. Diet samples were analyzed for dry matter 
(DM), crude protein (CP), crude fiber (CF), mineral matter (MM) and 
acid-hydrolyzed fat (AHF) according to AOAC (2006). The samples 
were ground in a cutting mill equipped with 1mm screen and analyzed 
for DM by submitting samples to oven drying; ash by muffle furnace 
incineration; and crude protein CP using the Kjeldahl method. 
Samples were also analyzed for AHF using Soxhlet apparatus, and 
CF using the Weende method (AOAC 2006). Nitrogen-free extract 
(NFE) was calculated by subtracting ash, AHF, CP and CF components 
from DM (NFE = DM-ash-AHF-CP-CF). Minerals were analyzed after 
nitric-perchloric digestion. Phosphorus was measured with the 

spectrophotometer using the vanadate-molybdate method. Calcium, 
potassium, magnesium, chloride, and sodium were measured by 
flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry.

Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed by the statistical software 
SAS (version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, USA), in a randomised 
block design by ANOVA, three treatments in two blocks, and the 
averages of treatments were compared by the SNK test. All analyses 
were performed using GLM module from the Statigraphics plus 
4.1 software. Values of p?0.05 were considered significant.

RESULTS
Cats showed average daily food intake of 14.7±1.5g/kg DM/ BW/d, 
which is considered satisfactory and did not differ among 
groups. The group fed with added calcium gluconate diet 
had lower faecal score (P=0.050) and faecal dry matter 
(P=0.003), and higher venous Na+ (P=0.049) and osmolality 
(P=0.008; Table 2).

Daily urinary volume and urine density were not significantly 
different. Cats fed with diets with added calcium showed 
increased urine pH and the addition of calcium carbonate 
in the diet showed greater effect than calcium gluconate on 
pH, (P&lt;0.001; Table 3).

Cats fed with control diet had increased Na+ excretion 
(P=0.018). The group fed with calcium carbonate diet had 
lower percentage of urinary phosphorus excretion (P=0.044). 
The addition of calcium in either form did not result in increased 
excretion of phosphorus in urine (P=0.233; Table 3).

The correlation between urinary pH and Na+ excretion was 
negative (R2=-0.49, P&lt;0.05). Ca2+ excretion was correlated only 
with the Mg2+ excretion (R2=0.49, P&lt;0.05). Chloride excretion 
(R2=0.79, P&lt;0.001) was highly correlated with K+ excretion, 
as well as K+ to Na+ (R2=0.47, P&lt;0.05; Table 4).

DISCUSSION
Cats fed with diet containing calcium gluconate had lower 
faecal score (P=0.050) compared to cats that received control 
diet and diet with added calcium carbonate, which indicates 
production of faeces with higher moisture content (Table 2). 
Since there was no difference in urinary volume between 
groups, the possible explanation for higher water loss in the 
stool could be the increased osmolality by osmotic active 
glucose from gluconate. Blood gas analysis showed slight 
metabolic acidosis in control and calcium gluconate treatments, 
with pH, HCO3 and BE below normal values (Dibartola 2006), 
probably due to low BE of the control diet. However, deviations 
from normality were minimal and did not differ from calcium 
carbonate values. Ionized calcium was found below normal 
blood gas parameters for adult cats in all experimental diets, 
before and after feeding (Table 2). Hypocalcemia found in 
this study (reference values of iCa: 1.15 to 1.35; Dibartola 
2006), may be explained by the use of heparin in the syringe 
for blood collection.

Na+ and osmolality values were higher (P&lt;0.05) in the 
treatment with calcium gluconate. Hypernatremia could 
have occurred by the presence of impermeable solutes such 
as glucose. Initially, the elevation of blood glucose draws 
intracellular water to the extracellular fluid in order to 
normalise osmolality, with consequent dilution of sodium 
and hyponatremia. Subsequently, there may be development 
of hypernatremia due to osmotic diuresis, which occurs as a

Effect of calcium sources in the diets of adult cats on urinary parameters and acid-base balance

way of removing excess extracellular fluid (Dibartola 2006). 
Cats fed the diet with calcium gluconate showed no increase 
in urine volume, but had faeces with higher moisture content. 
Osmolality, calculated from the Na+, also increased.

Cats fed control the diet had lower calcium intake (P&lt;0.05) 
due to lower calcium concentration in the diet, showing lower 
urinary pH, which is consistent with low dietary BE. Cats fed 
with the diet containing calcium carbonate showed higher 
urinary pH than cats fed with the diet with added calcium 
gluconate (P&lt;0.001), although both groups had ingested 
similar amounts of calcium.

Cats that received the diet with calcium gluconate possibly 
absorbed more Ca2+, but still there was no greater urinary 
Ca2+ excretion. Urine pH was more acidic than in cats fed the 
diet containing calcium carbonate. Diet containing calcium 
carbonate may have had less Ca2+ absorption, but induced higher 
urine alkalinization. This difference in the urine alkalization 
levels is similar to that observed between calcium chloride 
and calcium carbonate reported by Pastoor et al. (1994a). 
The authors observed that urine pH was always lower when 
calcium chloride was added to the diet, while the addition of 
calcium carbonate increased the urine pH. Kienzle et al. (1991) 
observed that the addition of calcium carbonate and calcium 
lactate (C6H10CaO6) increased urine pH, and calcium chloride 
acidified urine pH.

Although calcium is absorbed by the intestinal tract, not 
all is retained in tissues. About 90% of daily Ca2+ intake is 
excreted in faeces, while the remaining is eliminated in urine 
(Guyton &amp;amp; Hall 1996). Despite being a high-power alkalinizing 
cation, its absorption is dependent on the associated anion, 
being more or less absorbed (Allen &amp;amp; Kruger 2000). Renal 
calcium excretion levels in healthy cats are low and seem to 
not be strictly correlated with dietary calcium intake (Zentek 
&amp;amp; Schulz 2004).

Pansu et al. (1993) studied the solubility and intestinal 
transit time limit of calcium absorption in rats. According to 
them, calcium carbonate has low solubility, and is preferably 
absorbed via transcellular in the proximal parts of the intestine, 
when it becomes slightly soluble in higher pH. Salts with 
greater solubility such as calcium gluconate will be soluble at 
higher pH values, which may be absorbed on other portions 
of the intestine, on calcium paracellular pathway, since it is 
considered non-saturable.

Passlack &amp;amp; Zentek (2013) investigated the impact of 
dietary calcium and phosphorus on urine composition of 
cats and demonstrated that increasing dietary calcium and 
phosphorus did not affect urinary mineral concentrations 
and had more influence on PTH levels. An increase in faecal 
calcium was observed, showing that the homeostatic regulatory 
process of calcium metabolism in cats seems to be related 
to the intestinal tract and not to renal excretion. Moreover, 
PTH enhances blood calcium concentration by increasing 
intestinal calcium absorption, reducing the renal calcium 
excretion (Healy et al. 2003).

Jeremias et al. (2013) observed that equations predicting 
base excess of foods tended to overestimate urine pH and 
according to the study, they could have some limitations. 
It is possible that not the entire acid load produced in the 
intermediary metabolism is related to food macroelements, 
because differences in absorption of certain acid and alkaline 
minerals are not taken into account.

Kienzle &amp;amp; Wilms-Eilers (1994) tested diets with ammonium 
chloride (NH4Cl) and observed that it suppresses postprandial 
alkaline tide when combined with calcium carbonate, but 
this effect can be reversed when it is associated with sodium 
carbonate (Na2CO3). Calcium carbonate is not readily soluble 
and therefore, it is absorbed more slowly while sodium 
carbonate is rapidly absorbed, contributing to the postprandial 
alkaline tide.

Lower urinary calcium excretion was also reported by 
Pastoor et al. (1994a), who evaluated the balance of daily Ca2+ 
in cats fed with a diet high in Ca2+ (13g/kg). The percentage 
excreted in urine was approximately 0.59% of Ca2+ consumed 
and faecal percentage was around 98% of Ca2+ consumed, 
similar to findings in the present experiment, which found 
even lower urinary calcium excretion levels.

In the calcium carbonate metabolism in human patients, 
Ca2+ was minimally excreted in the urine, while carbonate 
contributes to the increased potential of bicarbonate buffer, 
demonstrating that carbonate is most likely responsible for 
urine alkalization (Clarkson et al. 1970).

In this study, urinary K+ and Ca2+ excretions were similar 
to concentrations reported by Lulich et al. (2004). However, 
Na+, Mg2+ and P excretions were higher in this experiment 
(Table 3), which may be related to the different amount of 
macrominerals in the diets.

In the control diet, high Na+ and phosphorus excretions 
were observed and pH was negatively correlated with Na+ 
(R2=-0.49, P&lt;0.05; Table 4). This can be explained by the 
acid-base balance, which in an attempt to compensate for 
the metabolic acidosis, increases the excretion of H+ ions, 
which are buffered by HPO4, forming H2PO4, which may be 
excreted as sodium salt (NaH2PO4). Phosphorus excretion 
in the treatment with calcium gluconate was significantly 
higher than in the treatment with calcium carbonate, which 
can also be explained by the buffering of HPO4.

According to Pastoor et al. (1994b), increased Ca2+ 
intake decreased phosphorus and Mg2+ absorption due to 
the formation of insoluble calcium-magnesium-phosphate 
complexes (Brink et al. 1992). In this study, there was no 
difference in urinary Mg2+ excretion, but there was lower 
phosphorus excretion in cats fed with the diet containing 
calcium carbonate. This may have occurred because calcium 
carbonate, due to its lower absorption or reexcretion into 
the intestinal lumen, may have had more time to react with 
phosphorus, generating complexes, which possibly could have 
increased its faecal excretion, concomitantly decreasing its 
urinary excretion. Calcium gluconate, due to its higher and

faster Ca2+ absorption, had less time for reactions and plays a 
different role in urine pH when compared to calcium gluconate.

This study has some limitations that should be considered: 
the major one was the lack of data regarding digestibility 
and faecal excretion of minerals, requiring further studies. 
In addition, Buckley et al. (2011) demonstrated that high water 
intake influences urinary evaluations in cats by increasing the 
urine volume, reducing the urine density. The amount of water 
ingested by cats was not measured in this study. However, no 
significant differences among evaluations mentioned above 
were observed.

CONCLUSIONS
The experiment demonstrated that calcium carbonate 

and gluconate of calcium alkalinized the urine. Calcium 
carbonate has highest potential than calcium gluconate, which 
demonstrates that carbonate also contributes to alkalinization, 
and this action is not exclusive to calcium.

The calcium ion should not be evaluated in isolation, since 
its presence in urine affects the urinary pH variably according 
to the anion forming the different Ca salts.
