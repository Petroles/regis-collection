Ao Doutor Hélder Vila Real um sincero obrigada! Obrigada pela dedicação, ajuda e entusiasmo. 

Por todo o conhecimento que me passaste e pela incansável ajuda, que me fez crescer e me 

tornou uma pessoa mais crítica e mais autonoma. Nunca pensei aprender tanto em tão pouco 

tempo. Espero, sinceremente, que o futuro te traga tudo o que desejas. 

Ao Professor Doutor João Rocha, obrigada pela co-orientação desta tese e por todo o tempo 

despendido. 

Ao Doutor Auturo Álvarez-Bautista, obrigada pela ajuda com a formulação das nanoparticulas e 

introdução em técnicas completamente, humor espanhol e apoio! 

À Unidade de Serviços Analíticos do iBET, um especial agradecimento pelo incansável apoio e 

simpatia que me fez sentir “em casa”.  

À minha família, Mãe, Pai, Irmã, Tios, Avós, Primos, muito obrigada! Pela oportunidade, pelo 

apoio quando decisões dificeis tiveram de ser tomadas e incansável dedicação. Sem vocês nada 

disto faria sentido.  

Às minha amigas cientistas, Carla, Dora, Maria, Shikha, não sei como vos agradecer! Obrigada 

pela força que me deram no ínicio e depois, sem vocês não estaria aqui, assim. Que o futuro se 

revele brilhante para todas, sempre com muita festa! 

Às minha meninas! Obrigada pelos anos que já passaram e que virão. À Ana que, mesmo longe, 

não deixa de fazer parte do meu dia-à-dia e à Carolina, pelas horas de conversa e descontração.  

Aos meus amigos de Coimbra, são a família que lá deixei e a distância não muda isso. Cristina, 

obrigada por tudo continuar na mesma, mesmo estando tudo tão diferente.

Abstract 
 

Diabetes mellitus (DM) represents a world health problem with a current 

estimated prevalence of 415 million people, characterized by an increased glucose blood 

concentration. DM type 1 therapy is based on the subcutaneous administration of 

insulin in accordance to glucose levels, which is associated with patient´s poor 

compliance. Following this, the aim of this project is to produce an insulin delivery 

system sensitive to hyperglycaemia, avoiding the need of glycaemia monitoring while 

promoting a better glucose homeostasis control. 

In this work, a glucose sensitive insulin delivery system started to be developed 

based on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles containing insulin and 

catalase and decorated with glucose oxidase (GOx). The principle for insulin release is 

based on the conversion of glucose into H2O2 whenever glycaemia levels are high; 

afterwards the breakdown of H2O2 into H2O and O2 by catalase leads to an increased 

pressure inside the nanoparticles, causing them to break and to release insulin. 

An initial catalase encapsulation study was conducted. Immobilized catalase was 

not only active but it also showed increased stability in comparison with free catalase. A 

release profile could be observed in response to the presence of H2O2. Furthermore, 

GOx immobilization on PLGA surface was also accomplished and a significant enzymatic 

activity and stability were achieved. Afterwards, insulin and catalase were co-

encapsulated within PLGA nanoparticles and the insulin release pattern was evaluated. 

However, and in contrast with initial results observed for encapsulated catalase, insulin 

release was not triggered by the presence of H2O2. The optimized immobilization 

conditions for catalase are not suitable for insulin delivery probably due to the PLGA 

surface porosity and insulin smaller size in comparison with catalase. 

Future work may include the encapsulation of insulin linked to polyethylene 

glycol (PEG), in order to obtain a larger molecule and by this way avoiding its release 

through PLGA pores and improving the release of insulin.

Resumo 
 

A Diabetes mellitus (DM) é uma doença que atinge cerca de 415 milhões de 

pessoas, caracterizada por um aumento da concentração de glucose sanguínea. A 

terapia da DM tipo 1 é baseada na administração subcutânea de insulina de acordo com 

os níveis de glicémia, o que contribui para a diminuição da qualidade de vida do doente. 

Assim, o objectivo deste projecto é produzir um sistema de veiculação de insulina 

sensível a condições de hiperglicémia, reduzindo a necessidade de monitorização dos 

níveis de glicémia e melhorando o controlo da homeostase da glucose. 

Neste trabalho, iniciou-se o desenvolvimento de um sistema de veiculação de 

insulina sensível à hiperglicémia, usando nanoparticulas de ácido poli láctico/glicólico 

(PLGA) com vista a co-encapsular catalase e insulina e com derivatização à superfície 

com glucose oxidase (GOx). O principio da libertação da insulina baseia-se na conversão 

da glucose em H2O2 quando a glicémia está elevada e por sua vez o H2O2 é cindido em 

H2O e O2 pela catalase, provocando o aumento da pressão dentro das nanopartículas e 

consequentemente, a sua ruptura e a libertação da insulina.  

Inicialmente, a encapsulação da catalase foi estudada e demonstrou-se não só 

que tinha actividade, mas que também que apresentava maior estabilidade do que a 

catalase livre. O seu perfil de libertação foi avaliado em resposta à presença de H2O2. A 

imobilização de GOx à superfície das nanopartículas de PLGA foi conseguida com 

actividade enzimática e estabilidade significativa. Posteriormente, foi realizada a co-

encapsulação de insulina e catalase nas nanoparticulas de PLGA e o perfil de libertação 

da insulina foi avaliado. No entanto, a libertação da insulina não foi influenciada pela 

presença de H2O2. Estes resultados demonstram que as condições óptimas de 

encapsulação da catalase não são as mesmas para a insulina, uma vez que a superfície 

do PLGA é porosa e a insulina tem um tamanho mais pequeno que a catalase.  

No trabalho futuro poder-se-á estudar a encapsulação de insulina ligada a 

polietilenoglicol (PEG), de modo a obter uma molecula maior e a evitar a sua libertação 

através dos poros na superfície do PLGA, melhorando o perfil de libertação da insulina.

1.Introduction 
 

 

 

 

 

1. Diabetes 
 

1.1.Diabetes physiopathology  

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is among the major global health problems, affecting 

approximately 415 million patients worldwide (Federation, 2015). According to recent 

studies, 60 million people suffer from DM in Europe and the disease has a prevalence 

of 13% in Portugal, corresponding to approximately 1 million people (Diabetologia, 

2014;WHO, 2015). The distribution of DM around the world is heterogeneous and its 

increased incidence has a high impact in society. Following this, much attention has 

been given to new approaches in DM diagnosis and therapy (King et al., 1998;Mo et al., 

2014;Veiseh et al., 2015). 

DM is a metabolic disease diagnosed by glucose blood levels higher than 6 

mmol/L (108 mg/dL) during the fasting period and/or glucose blood levels higher than 

7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) 2 hours after food ingestion (WHO, 2006;Veiseh et al., 2015). 

DM is characterized by several symptoms, including: frequent infections, increased urine 

volume, thirst and unexplained weight loss. Drowsiness and coma can occur in severe 

cases. Comorbidities with high impact to patient’s mortality, such as coronary artery 

disease, diabetic retinopathy, member amputation and renal insufficiency, may arise 

due to vascular complications caused by the difficulty to maintain normoglycaemia (Gu 

et al., 2013).  

DM can be divided into type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes. In DM type 1, an 

inefficient insulin production leads to a deregulated glycaemia homeostasis, whereas in 

DM type 2, cells of the Human body lack to respond to endogenous insulin (Mo et al., 



1.Introduction 

2 
 

2014;Veiseh et al., 2015). DM type 1 is an autoimmune disease affecting pancreas, 

characterized by ??cells destruction mediated by immune system T?cells (McCall et al., 

2013). Also known as juvenile diabetes, DM type 1 accounts for 10% of diabetic 

patients and its therapy is based on insulin replacement coupled with a tight glucose 

monitoring (Dabelea, 2009). In contrast, in DM type 2 a gain of insulin resistance 

occurs, mainly associated with obesity and a poor life style and the initial non-insulin 

therapy has the main objective of delaying the disease progression (Veiseh et al., 

2015). The most common cause of new cases of blindness is due to diabetic 

retinopathy, a microvascular disease that affects almost all patients with DM type 1 

and more than 60% of patients with DM type 2 (Fong et al., 2004;Bjornstad et al., 

2015). The third type of DM, called gestational diabetes is characterized by 

hyperglycaemia occurring during pregnancy. This condition may persist in a very low 

frequency after pregnancy and in some cases insulin is used for treatment (Guemes et 

al., 2015). 

 

1.2.Insulin´s physiological action  

In physiological conditions, pancreatic ??cells in Langerhans islets produce 

insulin, a protein hormone responsible for the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid 

metabolism, having the main function of contributing to the homeostasis of glucose. 

This regulation is a vital function since glucose is a primary energy source for the brain 

cells (Stryer et al., 2008). Structurally, human insulin comprises 51 amino acids and has 

a molecular weight of 5808 Da. Insulin is synthesized as preproinsulin by ??cells, 

undergoing several processes before becoming mature insulin which comprises two 

polypeptide chains (A and B) with three disulfide bonds, two of them connecting the 

polypeptide chains (figure 1.1).

In response to high levels of blood glucose, insulin is released by pancreatic cells, 

circulates through the blood stream and binds to insulin receptors located in insulin 

sensitive cells, promoting an increased presence of glucose transporters at the cell 

surface (Stryer et al., 2008). Insulin receptors, mainly located in skeletal muscle, adipose 

tissue and brain cells (figure 1.2), when activated, promote glucose transport from blood 

into cells through major glucose transporter (type 4, GLUT4) recruitment and 

translocation from intracellular vesicles to the cell surface

1.Introduction 

4 
 

Insulin receptor is a dimer and each sub-unit is formed by one ? and one ? chain, 

linked by a single disulfide bond. The ? subunit of this receptor is inside the cell and has 

one transmembrane segment, whereas the ? subunit has an extracellular location. The ? 

subunit consists in a protein tyrosine kinase that catalyses phosphoryl group 

transference from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a tyrosine. A cross-phosphorylation 

performed by the two ? subunits on each other leads to the activation of the receptor 

and initializes a signalling cascade inside the cell with several players, including protein 

kinase B (Akt), mainly associated with metabolic processes (Saltiel et al., 2001;Stryer et 

al., 2008). In response to low insulin levels, insulin is dissociated from its receptor 

interrupting the signalling cascade, promoting GLUT4 recycling back into the cytosol and 

stopping glucose entrance into the cell (Stryer et al., 2008;Mo et al., 2014).  

Insulin pathway is involved in glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism in the 

liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, represented in figure 1.2. While promoting 

glucose transport into cells, insulin is also contributing to glucose storage in the target 

tissues, but its action is much more vast, including: appetite decrease; stimulation of 

glycogen synthesis in muscle and liver; reduction of glucose release, hepatic 

glycogenolysis (glycogen breakdown) and gluconeogenesis (glucose synthesis pathways); 

enhancement of lipogenesis in the liver (fatty acid synthesis) and lipolysis (lipid 

breakdown) inhibition in adipose tissue (Stryer et al., 2008;Matteucci et al., 2015). All 

these mechanisms demonstrate the importance of insulin in the regulation of 

carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. In addition, insulin also decreases autophagy, renal 

sodium excretion and proteolysis (Puigserver et al., 2003;Quan et al., 2013;Bunner et al., 

2014;Mo et al., 2014).  

Insulin action contributes to keep glucose blood levels between 4 and 6 mmol/L 

(72 to 108 mg/dL) (WHO, 2006;Veiseh et al., 2015) and its production follows a pattern 

under physiological conditions. A continuous basal secretion occurs during fasting 

periods and an increased insulin production is induced after food ingestion. At meal 

time, insulin concentration increases leading to a peak after 45-60 minutes and returns 

to basal levels within 2/3 hours after meal. An important aspect of insulin production 

during the night and other prolonged fasting periods is its dependence with other 

factors such as circadian rhythms that contribute to regulate glucose production (Pettus 

et al., 2015).

1.3.Insulinotherapy  

According to the type and the stage of DM, glycaemia levels may need to be regulated 

through insulin therapy. Clinical application of insulin was an important milestone in the 

therapy of DM (figure 1.3), since until then DM therapy was only based in food 

restriction and associated with a poor prognosis (Sanger et al., 1953;Johnson, 

1983;Mayer et al., 2007). Even after insulin isolation, immunogenicity associated with 

insulin of animal origin and low purity were negative aspects that caused poor 

reproducibility of the therapeutic response and patient compliance. Currently, 

recombinant technology is able to synthesize Human insulin and analogues with 

improved stability and prolonged action. The administration of external insulin aims to 

mimic insulin levels, pattern of secretion and distribution, promoting the achievement of 

physiologic glucose blood concentrations. Nevertheless, despite several important 

accomplishments in DM therapy including the isolation of bovine insulin and the 

production of Human insulin, the amount of administrated insulin still needs to be 

regulated according to patient glucose levels monitoring, through multiple daily 

injections. Furthermore, insulin administration is mostly subcutaneous and is associated 

with pain, hypoglycemia episodes and weight gain (Kennedy, 1991;Hanås et al., 

1997;Fonte et al., 2015). Type 1 DM patients make use of a combination of two types of 

insulin in a multiple daily injection scheme including long-acting and rapid-acting insulin 

according to the food ingestion periods, requiring approximately 4 injections per day 

(Tibaldi, 2014;Pettus et al., 2015). Several long-acting insulin formulations, shown on 

table 1-1, are commercial available and provide a slow insulin action, mimicking basal 

insulin levels in fasting periods. In contrast, rapid-acting insulin formulations are able to 

increase insulin levels in a short period of time, which is ideal to control blood glucose 

after meal time. Besides the need of multiple insulin administrations, a major concern in 

the therapy of DM is nocturnal hypoglycemia, a dangerous situation that can occur due 

to small basal insulin increase. Moreover, evening physical exercise appears to be a risk 

factor for nocturnal hypoglycemia (Briscoe et al., 2006;Campbell et al., 2015;Wilson et 

al., 2015).

The advances in recombinant DNA technology allowed new insulin structure 

modifications, such as: substitution, addition or depletion of specific amino acids. These 

modifications helped to optimize insulin pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic 

profiles, including insulin absorption delay, which lead to the commercialization of 

newer long-acting insulin formulations, such as Glargine and Determin (table 1-1). A 

consequence of these formulations with a larger period of action was to provide a more 

flexible administration, increasing patient compliance. However, overnight blood 

glucose control is still a problem in many situations; as well as weight gain (Heinemann 

et al., 2000;Kurtzhals, 2007;Pettus et al., 2015). More recently, ultra-long-acting insulin 

(i.e. degludec, table 1-1) with increased action duration and less pharmacodynamics 

variations and hypoglycemic events represent an interesting alternative enabling only 

one injection per day. Furthermore, conjugation of insulin with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 

(i.e. peglispro) also provides a longer duration of rapid-action insulin, lispro (table 1-1). 

Despite these recent developments concerning insulin formulation, drawbacks of 

conventional injectable insulin stimulate research regarding new administration routes 

and insulin delivery systems. In order to improve patient compliance and mimic 

physiologic insulin response, oral and pulmonary administration routes are seen as 

promising approaches. 

Taking into account patient compliance, oral administration is the most 

attractive. In addition, the possibility of having an intestinal absorbance through oral 

route would allow insulin to reach the liver through portal circulation, which is the first 

target of pancreatic insulin secretion and where a tight glycaemia control occurs. This 

route is closer to what happens in physiological conditions in contrast with 

subcutaneous administration, where only approximately 20% of insulin reaches liver 

(Brown et al., 1979;Gordon Still, 2002;Sonaje et al., 2010). Unfortunately, insulin 

bioavailability is drastically reduced by oral administration due to stomach acidic pH as 

well as due to enzymatic and physical barriers. The acidic pH of stomach and enzymatic 

activity contributes to insulin degradation whereas the gastrointestinal epithelium is 

impermeable to insulin (Chen et al., 2011;Chaturvedi et al., 2013). Following this, several 

strategies have been designed in order to protect insulin native structure, such as: the 

co-delivery with enzyme inhibitors, the use of absorption enhancers and also insulin 

delivery systems (Morishita et al., 1993;Sindhu et al., 2011).

Besides oral administration, pulmonary administration is also an interesting 

approach due to: the large surface area for absorption in the lungs; tiny alveolar 

membrane; and high vascularization, which are important properties to allow efficient 

insulin permeation. On the other hand, insulin raw material is not breathable and the 

size of insulin delivery systems for pulmonary administration must be comprehended 

between 1 and 3 µm not to be exhaled, swallowed or retained in the upper airways 

(Byron, 1990;Klingler et al., 2009). 

Despite the clear advantages of these non-invasive routes, low bioavailability and 

poor therapeutic efficacy are also still two major drawbacks (Hamishehkar et al., 

2010;Mo et al., 2014). In addition, insulin delivery through buccal, nasal and transdermal 

are also seen as alternative routes with potential to overcome currently diabetic therapy 

problems (Fonte et al., 2015).Following this, a more comfortable administration route 

besides the tight blood glucose control without requiring glycaemia monitoring remain 

as two unfulfilled needs in DM therapy in order to promote a better quality of life to DM 

patients. 

 

2. Nanoparticles delivery systems 

 

2.1.Nanoparticles delivery systems – general aspects 

Developed research concerning insulin action and DM disease contributed to a 

comprehensive understanding of therapeutic opportunities and challenges. An ideal 

insulin delivery system should be able to respond autonomously to glucose levels, 

contributing to promote normoglycaemia and to improve patient’s lifestyle and 

compliance. Furthermore, insulin delivery systems based on nanoparticles are 

interesting approaches due to the need of insulin protection against pH and enzymatic 

degradation and due to the possibility of being capable to cross specific barriers such as 

skin and intestinal barrier, increasing insulin bioavailability and promoting a controlled 

release through structural modifications on nanoparticles surface (Ma, 2014;Pandita et 

al., 2015). Examples of insulin encapsulation using different types of delivery systems

are presented in table 1-2 and all referred studies had the purpose to reduce glycaemia 

levels reduction using in vitro and in vivo conditions. 

Nanoparticle delivery systems represent an important approach in the 

therapeutic field of many diseases such as DM, cancer, and inflammatory diseases 

(Pandita et al., 2015). Not only with the purpose to obtain more efficient drug delivery 

systems, nanoparticles have also been explored for the diagnosis of several diseases 

(Kapoor et al., 2015;Pandita et al., 2015;Sadat et al., 2015). Nanoparticles are solid 

structures, typically with 100 nm and with physical, chemical and biological properties 

tuneable according to their constituents and production method (Sharma et al., 2015;Yu 

et al., 2015). A large range of molecules can be incorporated within nanoparticles from 

small drugs to macromolecules, including vaccines. Drug delivery systems may not only 

promote drug delivery to a specific target, but may also allow an improved metabolic 

stability, time of action and a low systemic toxicity (Kanzarkar et al., 2015;Kovalainen et 

al., 2015). Particles surface engineered with antibodies, proteins and other molecules 

may be used to increase selectivity for specific organs and tumours, influencing 

biodistribution and promoting enhanced half-life time in blood (Danhier et al., 

2012;Pandita et al., 2015). Moreover, although many materials are already approved by 

Food and Drug Agency (FDA) and European Medicine Agency (EMA) for drug delivery 

systems in Humans, some toxicity issues such as immunogenicity may be associated with 

nanoparticles showing the importance of in vitro and in vivo toxicity testing. 

Nanoparticles properties including size, shape and surface charge may be fine tuned in 

order to circumvent toxicity issues (Makadia et al., 2011;Shah et al., 2014). Furthermore, 

the scaling-up of these systems and the high cost of nanoparticles are two other 

drawbacks of nanotechnology (Danhier et al., 2012).

An essential aspect for a successful nanoparticle formulation is to have a high 

drug loading (i.e. percentage of loaded amount of drug relative to the total amount of 

nanoparticles) and encapsulation efficiency (EE) (i.e. percentage of loaded amount of 

drug relative to the total amount of drug used for the formulation), with the aim of 

reducing the amount of solids that are administrated and the production costs (Danhier 

et al., 2012), but poor drug loading is a frequent occurring negative condition that need 

be optimized. The most popular method for drug encapsulation is the incorporation of 

the drug during nanoparticles production; but drug adhesion after particle production 

may also be applied. An important parameter during drug encapsulation is the stability 

of the encapsulated molecules during the process in order to avoid aggregation and 

activity loss in the case of the encapsulation of enzymes, for instance. Among other 

characteristics, particle size is a very important one, since it influences cell uptake, 

recognition by the immune system and drug release profile (Owens et al., 2006;Mittal et 

al., 2007). In general, nanoparticles vary in size between 10 and 1000 nm but ideally, 

particles should be smaller than 200 nm to have a prolonged bloodstream circulation 

(Singh et al., 2009;Sharma et al., 2015). 

 

 

2.2.Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based nanoparticles 

 

2.2.1.General aspects 

Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer 

widely used in several kinds of nanoparticles systems, such as: vaccines, protein delivery, 

anti-inflammatory, antibiotic and in anticancer therapy formulations (Horisawa et al., 

2002;Jiang et al., 2005;Choi et al., 2006;Luo et al., 2009;Toti et al., 2011). This polymer is 

available in several molecular weights and copolymer composition, which influences its 

degradation time, particle size and drug encapsulation (Danhier et al., 

2012;Mohammadi-Samani et al., 2015). 

Composed by lactic and glycolic acid, PLGA is associated with a minimal systemic 

toxicity, due to the fact that these monomers, produced by PLGA hydrolysis, can be

found endogenously and may be incorporated in the Krebs cycle (Muthu, 2009). FDA 

and EMA approval for PLGA bioapplication in humans contributed to its popularity and 

extensive study. Its capability to promote drug sustainable release allows a reduced 

frequency of administration, dose and to achieve stable drug levels in blood, leading to 

an increased therapeutic effect and reduced side effects. This sustainable release is 

mainly caused by polymer degradation through two different mechanisms: bulk erosion, 

consisting on a homogeneous and predominant degradation of PLGA; and surface 

erosion that arises in a heterogeneous manner. A low polymer molecular weight 

increases solubility in organic solvent causing a solidification rate decrease which leads 

to more porous and smaller particles (Mu et al., 2003;Mittal et al., 2007;Makadia et al., 

2011). Smaller particles have higher surface area which is good for drug diffusion. Also, 

low polymer concentration and lactic ratio promotes particles with more porous 

structure and an increased hydrophilic nature, respectively (Mu et al., 2003;Yeo et al., 

2004;Doan et al., 2013). A negative aspect of PLGA degradation is the pH reduction of 

the microenvironment which may influence drug stability and release (Sung et al., 

2004;Ding et al., 2008). The degradation and interaction of PLGA products with drug 

molecules contributes to drug decomposition and incomplete drug release (Zolnik et al., 

2007;Makadia et al., 2011). Moreover, burst release, which occurs through fissures and 

pores of the particles, represents one of PLGA pitfalls (Yeo et al., 2004;Hinds et al., 

2005). Despite the fact that the fast release of drug in a burst stage is used in specific 

drug administration strategies, the negative effects brought by burst effect can be 

pharmacologically dangerous and economically inefficient. Molecules adsorbed to the 

nanoparticles surface are also responsible for burst release. Several conditions may be 

fine tuned in order to reduce this effect including the polymer hydrophobicity, polymer 

concentration and amount of drug loaded. High burst effect is associated with 

copolymer PLGA composition since a high glycolic acid content increases water uptake 

from the medium and a fast particles hydration (O'Hagan et al., 1994). High amounts of 

drug loaded are also related to increased values of this effect, probably because of the 

high active principle concentration gradient between the nanoparticles and the medium. 

Associated to adsorbed proteins on particles surface is the creation of water channels on 

nanoparticles structure that promote high burst releases associated to high protein 

loadings (O'Hagan et al., 1994;Yang et al., 2001). Moreover, reduced polymer

concentration promotes internal porosity and high burst effect (Yang et al., 2001;Yeo et 

al., 2004). 

 

2.2.2.Formulation Methods 

Many techniques can be used to produce PLGA-based nanoparticles. According 

to drug properties, several nanoparticles production methods may be used in order to 

achieve the desired drug loading and release. In the emulsification solvent diffusion 

method, PLGA and drug are dissolved in a partially water-miscible solvent such as benzyl 

alcohol, which is then dispersed in a great amount of water. This quantity of water is 

sufficient to cause diffusion of the solvent into the external phase, deposition of the 

polymer around the droplets and nanoparticles formation (Kwon et al., 

2001;Guinebretiere et al., 2002). Moreover, in the emulsification-salting out method, 

used to encapsulate lipophilic molecules, the PLGA dissolved in acetone is emulsified in 

an aqueous solution with a high salt concentration (Reis et al., 2006;Felice et al., 2014). 

In addition, nanoprecipitation consists in the diffusion of a solution containing the drug 

and PLGA into a non-solvent (where both drug and polymer are not dissolved). Polymer 

diffusion into the non-solvent solution produces a rapid polymer precipitation and drug 

encapsulation. This method is primarily used for the encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs 

(Bilati et al., 2005;Felice et al., 2014). 

The most commonly used method for encapsulation within PLGA particles is the 

emulsification-solvent evaporation technique, mainly applied for hydrophobic drugs 

encapsulation. Relatively simple and without needing expensive instruments, in this 

method several parameters need to be tuned such as the kind of organic solvent used, 

temperature and rate of homogenization (Blanco et al., 1998;Katare et al., 2006;Wang, 

2010). Single or double-emulsion-solvent evaporation techniques are based on the 

formation of one or two emulsions using high-speed homogenization or sonication, 

followed by organic solvent evaporation. 

In the single-emulsion technique, the emulsion is produced after dissolving both 

drug and polymer in an organic solvent, the oil (O) phase, which is then emulsified in 

water (oil in water, O/W). The water phase contains water and a surfactant, such as 

poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (Menon et al., 2012;Sadat et al., 2015). The presence of the 



Preparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia 

 

15 
 

surfactant contributes to the emulsion stability and prevents particles aggregation, by 

changing the zeta potential. During sonication or homogenization, nanosized droplets 

are generated and the organic solvent is then allowed to evaporate. 

In order to encapsulate hydrophilic drugs such as: proteins, peptides or nucleic 

acids, a variation of this oil in water (O/W) technique is needed. Hydrophilic drugs 

require a double emulsion W/O/W technique in order to have a first shield of water 

where the drug is dissolved. The W/O/W procedure is produced by a primary water in oil 

(the aqueous solution is dispersed in the organic solution) and a second oil in water 

emulsion (Danhier et al., 2012;Menon et al., 2012;Sadat et al., 2015). The stability of 

these emulsions influences drug encapsulation, with particular emphasis to the first 

emulsion, highly associated with the loss of drug activity (van de Weert et al., 2000). In 

many cases, after solvent evaporation, nanoparticles are collected by centrifugation and 

dried, using procedures such as lyophilisation. Lyophilisation allows long term stability of 

nanoparticles storage at low temperatures; although in some cases nanoparticles are 

preferentially stored in an aqueous solution without undergoing any drying process 

(Abdelwahed et al., 2006;Kasper et al., 2011).  

The common step in all techniques is the production of a first emulsion, whereas 

the second step varies according to the procedure. More stable emulsions produce 

smaller particles, depending on the kind of surfactant used and its concentration (Sahoo 

et al., 2002;Budhian et al., 2007). 

 

 

2.2.3.Protein encapsulation  

Currently, the administration of proteins is mainly based on repeated injections 

through invasive routes, such as subcutaneous and intravenous (Shaji et al., 2008). Many 

efforts have been done to improve protein delivery using nanoscale vehicles, with the 

attempt to protect proteins from enzymatic and hydrolytic degradation, enhance 

bioavailability and protein concentration at the target tissue (Sharma et al., 2015;Yu et 

al., 2015). 

PLGA nanoparticles formulation steps, above highlighted, are critical for protein 

stability. Focusing on W/O/W method, the presence of water/organic solvent interfaces 



1.Introduction 

16 
 

is a huge drawback since it is identified as the major cause of protein unfolding, followed 

by denaturation and aggregation (Qi et al., 2011;Kovalainen et al., 2015). The shear 

stress created by homogenization and sonication also promotes protein aggregation. In 

particular, sonication seems to be more aggressive to protein stability due to local 

temperature extremes and free radical formation. Hydrophobic contacts between 

protein and polymer are also responsible for unfolding and aggregation (Kang et al., 

2001;Wu et al., 2011). All procedure steps are critical and may induce protein 

denaturation and aggregation, but the first emulsion is more detrimental and in many 

cases additives should be added to the first emulsion in order to reduce water/organic 

solvent interfaces and to promote protein stabilization. Addition of bovine serum 

albumin (BSA), gelatin, surfactants and sugars are some examples of excipients used in 

this technique (Morlock et al., 1997;Pérez-Rodriguez et al., 2003;Singhal et al., 2013). 

These additives are able to decrease protein interaction with W/O interface and interact 

specifically with protein surface, promoting the protection of hydrophobic regions, 

which reduces protein denaturation and aggregation (Ye et al., 2010;Fonte et al., 

2012;Ma, 2014). Furthermore, besides bioactivity loss, denatured or aggregated 

proteins may induce toxicity and immunogenicity (Perez et al., 2001;Castellanos et al., 

2002;Ye et al., 2010).  

In the second emulsion, interfacial stress is also responsible for protein unfolding. 

Moreover, during the generation of the second emulsion, water channels between 

internal and external aqueous phases may lead to protein escape from inner droplets, 

increasing interface area and protein denaturation. In the drying step, the removal of 

solvent may also cause denaturation and aggregation of proteins. Following this, many 

processes need to be optimized during polymeric nanoparticles formulation to avoid 

denaturation or aggregation of native proteins, which influences its release and 

therapeutic efficacy (van de Weert et al., 2000;Ye et al., 2010).

3. Enzyme kinetics 

 

3.1.General aspects 

Enzymes are biologic catalysts, capable of increasing the rate of chemical 

reactions by reducing its activation energy. Cellular environment is often unfavourable 

to non-catalysed reactions and many reactions would occur in an unsuitable rate 

without catalysis. Therefore, enzymes provide favourable environments for these 

reactions, being indispensable to life (Lehninger et al., 2008;Stryer et al., 2008). 

Moreover, enzymes are not destroyed during the reaction process, are high specific and 

do not interfere in the chemical equilibrium (Lehninger et al., 2008;Stryer et al., 2008). 

Nearly all enzymes are proteins, generally with a globular structure and one or more 

substrates binding sites. Enzymes activity is determined by its tridimensional structure 

and influenced by several conditions including: pH, temperature, substrate 

concentration and ionic strength (Scopes, 2002). A small part of the tridimensional 

structure is the active site, where substrates bind. This area is responsible for enzymatic 

specificity defined by its charges and shape properties, allowing the binding of a single 

kind of substrate. In accordance to this complementarity, the “lock and key hypothesis” 

was proposed by Fisher in 1894, proposing that only a specific substrate (key) was able 

to bind to a particular active site (lock). Currently, another hypothesis was raised, which 

is based on a slight enzyme shape modification that allows substrate binding (known as 

the “glove-in-hand” model) (Stryer et al., 2008;Robinson, 2015). Enzymatic activity can 

also be dependent on the presence of cofactors, a non-protein component with organic 

(coenzymes) or metal nature. An enzyme without its cofactor is named apoenzyme, 

whereas the complete catalytic structure is the holoenzyme. Additionally, cofactors 

tightly bound to enzymes are known as prosthetic groups (Stryer et al., 2008). 

Enzyme kinetics is the study of reaction rates catalysed by enzymes, which is an 

important tool to characterize enzyme function. During an enzymatic reaction, an 

increase of product amount though time is observed until the reaction reaches an 

equilibrium state. In 1913, Michaelis and Menten proposed the model described by 

equation 1, where E is the enzyme, S is the substrate, P is the product and ES is the 

enzyme-substrate complex. The limiting step of these reactions is the breakdown of the 



1.Introduction 

18 
 

ES complex, which is dependent on the kcat (catalytic constant) and that leads to product 

formation, whereas the first reaction is fast and reversible and in this case dependent on 

the rate constants: k1 and k-1(Michaelis et al., 1913;Lehninger et al., 2008).  

In equation 2, vmax is the maximum initial reaction rate and KM is the Michaelis-

Menten constant. KM is associated with the affinity of the enzyme for a substrate at a 

specific temperature and pH. Small KM is related to high substrate affinity, promoting a 

fast achievement of vmax. The relation between the reaction rate (vO) and the substrate 

concentration [S] is represented in figure 1.4, where vmax is approached asymptotically 

whenever the substrate concentration is high and KM is the substrate concentration 

when the reaction rate is half of vmax. Moreover, whenever the substrate concentration 

is much smaller than KM, the reaction can be reduced to a first order equation where the 

reaction rate is directly proportional to the substrate concentration. However, when the 

substrate concentration is much higher than KM, v0=vmax, a zero order equation can be 

used independently of the substrate concentration(Michaelis et al., 1913;Stryer et al., 

2008).

3.2.Activity assays 

The study of enzyme activity is essential to understand its physiologic functions, 

pathologic importance and even how they can be used in the therapeutic field. The 

enzyme activity is influenced by several conditions such as: temperature, pH, solvents 

and immobilization. A comprehensive study of these parameters allows extrapolation to 

in vivo activity. However, in vitro studies do not mimic the complexity of in vivo 

environment (Scopes, 2002;Robinson, 2015).  

The activity assay can be studied based on substrate consumption or product 

formation and can be performed following the progression of the reaction continuously 

or stopping the reaction at fixed times. In the first case the activity can be followed 

directly by measuring specific parameters, such as: absorbance, pH or fluorescence for 

instance allowing product or substrate quantification. This analysis has the advantage of 

being direct, avoiding operating errors related with the stopping procedure. Moreover, a 

continuous coupled assay can also be performed, where the product of a first reaction is 

used by a second enzyme, leading to a detectable change, generally absorbance. The 

constant rate can be determined in this case if no product inhibition and reversal of 

reaction occurs (Henderson et al., 1992;Purich, 2002;Scopes, 2002). In the non-

continuous assay, an extreme condition such as acidic or alkali pH, extreme 

temperatures or irreversible inhibitors are used to interrupt the reaction and proceed to 

substrate/product quantification (Purich, 2002;Scopes, 2002). 

 

3.3.Catalase 

Catalase was named in 1900 by Loew, after its identification as responsible for 

H2O2 breakdown, however, only 86 years later, Human catalase gene was isolated and 

characterized(Loew, 1900). Despite the difference in the Catalase amino acid sequence 

between different species, some specific amino acids related to enzyme function are 

conserved and allow the general definition of mammalian catalase (Zamocky et al., 

1999). Structurally, mammalian catalase is a homotetramer with a molecular mass (Mw) 

of 225–270 kDa and each subunit comprises a heme group at the active site only 

reachable by small substrates (figure 1.5). In comparison to many other enzymes, 



1.Introduction 

20 
 

catalase is more resistant to pH and thermal changes due to its rigid and stable structure 

(Kirkman et al., 2007). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Physiologically, catalase is an antioxidant enzyme involved in cell protection 

against reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during aerobic respiration, with a 

predominant function of controlling hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration. In order to 

prevent oxidative stress and its destructive effects, catalase and other enzymes such as 

superoxide dismutase and peroxiredoxin have a protective role in aerobic cells, although 

their activity are also found in anaerobic environments (Rocha et al., 1996). Catalase is a 

very efficient enzyme, capable to decompose about 107 million molecules of H2O2 per 

second and its activity is predominant in liver, erythrocytes, kidney and adipose tissue 

(Goyal et al., 2010). Moreover, the catalase capability to break H2O2 into molecular 

oxygen and water (equation 3), without free radicals production is an important aspect 

to avoid cellular death. Despite its relevance in physiological conditions, catalase 

deficiency is mainly a risk factor besides the enzyme deficiency. Catalase deficiency or 

acatalasemia, which refers to an inherited near-total deficiency of its activity, is 

associated to inflammation, inhibition of apoptosis and cancer (Kirkman et al., 

2007;Goth et al., 2013). Furthermore, catalase appears to be related to DM 

development as a result of ? cells damage by H2O2 (Kirkman et al., 2007;Afanas' ev, 

2010).

Due to its physiologic activity, catalase can be used as a therapeutic enzyme in 

order to reduce high ROS levels in several pathologic conditions such as radiation, 

ischemia and tumour progression (Singhal et al., 2013;Huang et al., 2015). The purpose 

of using catalase as a therapeutic agent is challenging. In contrast with some low 

molecular weight antioxidants, such as vitamin C and ascorbate, catalase has a large size 

and its distribution is restricted to certain tissues and organs. This limitation can 

however be an advantage in some diseases, such as cancer. Unique tumour vasculature 

is fenestrated and large size molecules can easily cross, providing a controlled release of 

this enzyme (Ma et al., 2006;Nishikawa et al., 2009). In addition, the in vivo delivery of 

catalase is associated with a fast degradation and limited passage through membranes 

(Nishikawa et al., 2005;Nishikawa et al., 2009). An interesting approach to overcome 

delivery problems is to encapsulate or immobilize catalase on the surface of 

nanoparticles delivery systems (Giovagnoli et al., 2005;Li et al., 2012;Wu et al., 

2013;Vilian et al., 2014). Nevertheless, poor encapsulation efficiency and activity 

retention remain as relevant problems that still need to be solved. 

 

3.4.Glucose Oxidase 

In 1928, Muller discovered Glucose-1-Oxidase (GOx) in Aspergillus niger extracts, 

allowing its DNA sequencing and protein structure determination in the next few 

decades (Kriechbaum et al., 1989;Wohlfahrt et al., 1999). In nature, GOx is produced by 

some fungi and insects. GOx is a glycoprotein, homodimer, composed by two identical 

subunits, each one with 80 kDa, and two flavin adenine dinucleotides (FAD) non-

covalently bound, illustrated on figure 1.6 (Pazur et al., 1965;Wong et al., 2008). The 

FAD coenzyme acts as an electron carrier (Wilson et al., 1992). Also, GOx reaction 

requires an electron acceptor, commonly dissolved oxygen, while the sugar molecule is 

the electron donor (Bohmhammel et al., 1993;Wong et al., 2008). GOx catalyses the 

oxidation of beta-D-glucose to D-gluconolactone and H2O2 (equation 4) and both of this 

products spontaneously break down into gluconic acid and water and oxygen, 

respectively (Wilson et al., 1992;Wong et al., 2008).

An interesting GOx property is its high specificity for glucose. In comparison to 

the reaction rate of glucose (100%), only 2-deoxy-D-glucose, 4-O-methyl-D-glucose and 

6-deoxy-D-glucose suffer oxidation by GOx, but with reaction rates lower than 20% 

(Pazur et al., 1964;Wong et al., 2008). In addition to its specificity, GOx is an enzyme 

with high stability and high turnover. Therefore, many industrial and commercial 

applications use GOx, such as food and healthcare industry. In the alimentary field, it is 

commonly used as preservative and to reduce alcohol wine content, while in the 

healthcare sector it is widely used in biosensors (Wong et al., 2008). Biosensors 

evolution through the last decades was impulsed by DM diagnosis and monitoring. In 

fact, glucose biosensors used by DM patients are based in the use of GOx. In 1962, the 

concept of measuring glucose levels through a biosensor was proposed. Glycaemia was 

firstly measured based on GOx reaction by quantifying oxygen consumption that was 

proportional to glucose concentration. But in order to increase enhance glucose 

monitoring precision, further GOx reaction was explored and in 1974 the first glucose 

biosensor was commercially available and was based on H2O2 detection. Currently, 

glucose monitoring is based on electron transference between GOx and specific 

electrodes (Kirsch et al., 2013;Taguchi et al., 2014).

3.5.Glucose-sensitive systems 

Glucose-sensitive systems are extensively studied with the purpose of insulin 

delivery, taking advantage of a specific response to high glucose levels. Currently, insulin 

release triggered by glucose follows one or both of the two mechanisms: material 

alteration in response to a change of an environmental condition or through a reaction 

exchange of preloaded insulin with glucose (Wu et al., 2013). 

Regarding the first referred mechanism, many authors have been using 

hydrogels, polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles to encapsulate or immobilize GOx and 

to promote a reduction of the pH environment (Traitel et al., 2000;Yoshimoto et al., 

2006;Qi et al., 2009;Wu et al., 2012). Qi et al, 2009 produced an insulin particle coated 

with catalase and GOx multilayer shields that promotes insulin release due to pH 

change. In the presence of GOx, glucose is converted in H2O2 and gluconic acid (equation 

3) that decreases pH environment levels and therefore, increases permeability of GOx 

shell. Reduction of pH levels also increase insulin release since in a more acid pH, insulin 

is more soluble. The addition of catalase to the system is an important aspect since H2O2 

levels produced through GOx reaction can be toxic in vivo causing deactivation of GOx 

(Traitel et al., 2000;Gu et al., 2013;Wu et al., 2013). Gu et al, 2013 described a nano-

network of chitosan and alginate nanoparticles encapsulated with insulin, GOx and 

catalase, capable to release insulin through a pH reduction and nano-networks 

dissociation. These nano-networks compose a macro scale system, which decreases in 

size through dissociation and therefore, insulin release (Gu et al., 2013).  

Moreover, insulin delivery can also be promoted by glucose competitive binding 

to specific proteins, such as concanavalin A (Con A). Yin et al, 2012 reported an insulin 

loaded hydrogel based on Con A and dextran, a polysaccharide composed by D-glucose. 

In this system, free glucose competes with dextran for Con A binding, leading to insulin 

release in the presence of high glucose levels and hydrogel dissociation(Yin et al., 2012). 

Another example of this kind of glucose-sensitive systems is the described by Kim at al, 

2001, where a polymeric-Con A complex is produced. Due to free glucose binding to Con 

A, the complex dissociates and insulin release is achieved (Kim et al., 2001).

4. Objectives  
 

The major goal of this study was to initiate the development of a smart drug 

delivery nanosystem for insulin. This delivery system was aimed to be sensitive to 

hyperglycaemic conditions and capable of maintaining glucose blood concentration 

within physiological values. 

The rationale is based in the ability of GOx to produce H2O2 from glucose, and 

that of catalase to convert H2O2 to O2 as illustrated in fig 1.7. The nanoparticle payload, 

co-encapsulated with catalase, should be released as result of pO2 build-up, and 

consequent pore formation on the nanoparticle surface. 

For sequential optimization, PLGA-based nanoparticles conjugated to GOx and 

encapsulating catalase, were produced by the W/O/W technique and this procedure was 

optimized in order to achieve catalase release in the presence of high glucose levels. 

Later on, insulin was co-encapsulated and the system was tested for the release of 

insulin upon H2O2 stimulus.

1.1.1.Catalase-loaded PLGA nanoparticles 

PLGA nanoparticles (A-D) were prepared as described on table 3-1 by a 

W/O/W double emulsion method. A 2.5 mg/mL catalase solution (dissolved without 

agitation) and 5 mg/mL PLGA in DCM was emulsified using a sonicator (Branson 450D, 

with a 25-500 mL tip) for 10 seconds in an ice bath (20% amplitude). The primary 

emulsion was then added to 60 mL of 2% PVA solution. PVA solution was prepared by 

a slow addition into water while stirring on a magnetic stir plate. Temperature of the 

PVA solution was raised to 85–95°C to completely dissolve PVA, after which it was 

cooled down to room temperature. The second emulsion was emulsified for 1 minute 

in an ice bath using a sonicator (20% amplitude) to produce the W/O/W emulsion. In 

order to evaporate DCM the double emulsion was gently stirred overnight at room 

temperature. To remove large microparticles and aggregates, the emulsion was 

centrifuged for 15 minutes at 82.3xg (Eppendorf 5810R). The supernatant was also 

centrifuged at 12800xg for 40 minutes and washed twice with MilliQ water to remove 

PVA residues and unloaded protein. The obtained nanoparticles were suspended in 10 

mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0).

PLGA nanoparticles were prepared by a W/O/W double emulsion. Insulin (2.5 

mg) and protamine (0.25 mg) were dissolved in a 0.01 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) 

solution and mixed with 2.5 mg/mL catalase solution (in 1% PVA). To produce the first 

emulsion, catalase and insulin solution were emulsified with 5 mg/mL PLGA in DCM 

for 10 seconds in an ice bath using a sonicator (Branson 450D, with a 25-500 mL tip; 

20% amplitude). This first emulsion was then added to 60 mL 2% PVA and emulsified 

by a sonicator for 1 minute in an ice bath (20% amplitude). In order to evaporate DCM 

the double emulsion was gently stirred overnight at room temperature. To remove 

the large microparticles and aggregates, the emulsion was centrifuged for 15 minutes 

at 82.3xg (Eppendorf 5810R). The supernatant was also centrifuged at 12800xg for 40 

minutes and washed twice with MilliQ water to remove PVA residues and unloaded 

proteins. The obtained nanoparticles were suspended in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 

7.0). 

1.2.PLGA nanoparticles functionalization 

A suspension of 10 mg of PLGA nanoparticles in 2 mL of 10 mM phosphate buffer 

pH 7.0 was incubated with 200 mM EDC and 100 mM NHS for 1 hour at room 

temperature with gentle stirring. PLGA activated particles were incubated overnight 

with glucose oxidase (0.8 mg/mL in 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0) in the darkness at 

room temperature. The resultant nanoparticles were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 

8228xg (Eppendorf 5810R), washed twice with MilliQ water and re-suspended in 10 mM 

phosphate buffer (pH 7.0).

1.3.PLGA-nanoparticles drying 

In alternative to nanoparticles storage in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 

nanoparticles were dried through two different processes: 

 

1.3.1.Vacuum concentrator centrifuge (Speedvac) 

After washes, nanoparticles were collected into several 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes 

and dried for 3 hours or overnight using a CentriVap Benchtop Vacuum Concentrator, 

Labconco.  

 

1.3.2.Lyophilisation 

After washes, nanoparticles were collected into 15 mL Falcon tubes and 

lyophilized for 24 hours at -80°C and placed in vacuum at 0.035 mBar using a Labconco 

FreeZone plus 4.5 Liter Cascade Freeze Dry System. 

 

 

2. PLGA nanoparticles physical characterization 

Zeta potential was measured at 25ºC and using disposable folded capillary 

cells after suspending the samples in MilliQ-water. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) 

was used to determine both particle size and size distribution of dilutes samples in 

MilliQ water at 25°C using disposable plastic cuvettes. Malvern Zeta sizer-Nano Z 

instrument was used both to perform DLS experiments and measuring the zeta 

potential. Surface morphology and size was also studied by scanning electron 

microscopy (SEM) using a Hitachi S2400 with Bruker light elements EDS and 

conductive adhesive tapes.

3.1.Encapsulation Efficiency and Loading 

In order to determine encapsulation efficiency and protein loading, 1 mL of 

nanoparticles were centrifuged, supernatant discarded and the pellet was dissolved in 

0.1 mL of DMSO for 1 hour. MilliQ water was added to DMSO till a final DMSO 

concentration of 5%, causing precipitation. PLGA was removed by 10 minutes 

centrifugation at 13800xg (VWR Galaxy 14DH centrifuge) and catalase was quantified in 

the supernatant by Bradford assay (BioRad protein assay, measured at 595 nm 

(SpectraMax Plus 384, Molecular Devices) (Bradford, 1976). The experiment was carried 

out in triplicate. Figure 3.1 shows the standard curve used for catalase quantification.

3.2.Catalase activity 

 

3.2.1.Continuous Method 

Catalase activity was measured by a continuous method. To 1 U/mL catalase 

solution in 500 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0 was added 40 mM of H2O2 at 25°C. H2O2 

consumption was followed at 240 nm using a spectrometer (Ultrospec 3000 UV-Vis, 

Pharmacia Biotech) during the first 2 minutes of the reaction and until 25% of 

reaction extension to avoid enzyme inhibition or inactivation or even excessive 

substrate consumption. Figure 3.2 shows a calibration curve used for the 

quantification of H2O2. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.2.2.Non-continuous Method 

A non-continuous method was used to measure catalase activity after its 

encapsulation within PLGA. Free catalase activity was also measured through this 

non-continuous method in order to optimize the assay conditions. 

Free catalase activity was measured by a non-continuous method using 

different concentrations of catalase (2.5; 5 and 10 U/mL) and substrate (20, 40 and 

80 mM). To 2 mL of catalase solution in 500 mM phosphate buffer (dissolved without 

agitation) at pH 7.0 and 25°C was added a H2O2 solution. From 0 to 4 minutes (every 

30 seconds), the reaction was stopped with a 500 mM pH 2.0 phosphoric acid

solution, after which the H2O2 absorbance was measured at 240 nm using a 

spectrometer (Ultrospec 3000 UV-Vis, Pharmacia Biotech). Initial rates were 

measured within the first 2 minutes and until 25% of reaction extension to avoid 

enzyme inhibition or even excessive substrate consumption, according to the 

literature and previous work. 

To 1 mg/mL of nanoparticles suspension (estimated value) was added 40 mM 

H2O2 and, every 30 seconds in the first 4 minutes, the reaction was stopped using a 

500 mM pH 2.0 phosphoric acid solution. PLGA was removed after centrifugation at 

13800xg (VWR Galaxy 14DH centrifuge) during 10 minutes. Theabsorbance of the 

supernatant was measured at 240 nm (Ultrospec 3000 UV-Vis, Pharmacia Biotech) to 

determinate H2O2 concentration and therefore, its consumption during the first 2 

minutes of reaction. After this assay, activity measurements were corrected in 

accordance to the exact particles mass in 1 mL of suspension. This assay was 

performed at day 0, 1, 5 and 15 after the production of the nanoparticles in order to 

study catalase stability. Figure 3.3 shows a calibration curve used for the 

quantification of H2O2.

In vitro release of encapsulated catalase was performed by suspending PLGA-

catalase nanoparticles in a 10 mM phosphate buffer solution pH 7.4 with H2O2 solution 

(800 mM) at 37º C with gentle stirring. At 0, 4, 8 and 24 hours an aliquot of the

of D-glucose to D-glucono-?-lactone, leading to formation of H2O2 (equation 3). H2O2 

enters in a second reaction involving p-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-aminoantipyrine with 

the formation of a quinoneimine dye complex in the presence of peroxidase 

(chromogenic reagent; equation 4).

5. Insulin study 

 

5.1.Encapsulation Efficiency and Loading 

With the purpose of quantifying insulin encapsulation within PLGA nanoparticles, 

1 mg/mL of nanoparticles suspension in 10 mM phosphate buffer (25°C and pH 7.0) was 

centrifuged 10 minutes at 13800xg (VWR Galaxy 14DH centrifuge), the supernatant was 

removed and the nanoparticles were dissolved in DMSO. MilliQ water was added to a 

final DMSO concentration of 5%, causing PLGA precipitation. After a 10 minutes 

centrifugation at 13800xg (VWR Galaxy 14DH centrifuge), insulin concentration was 

determinate in the supernatant by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC, 

Hitachi/VWR LaChrom ELITE) 

 

5.2.Insulin in vitro release 

In vitro release of insulin was performed, incubating PLGA nanoparticles in 10 

mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 100 µM H2O2 at 37º C with gentle stirring. At 0, 30 

minutes, 1, 2 and 3 hours an aliquot of the suspension was centrifuged during 10 

minutes at 13800xg (VWR Galaxy 14DH centrifuge) and insulin was quantified by HPLC-

UV (Hitachi/VWR LaChrom ELITE). A control was done with PLGA-catalase-insulin 

nanoparticles in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in the absence of H2O2. Figure 3.6

6. HPLC 

 

The quantification of insulin by HPLC was based on an already reported method 

(Wang et al., 2008). Insulin was analysed by reverse phase-HPLC (Hitachi/VWR LaChrom 

ELITE) with a photodiode array detector (DAD, L-2455), using a RP-18 column (Synergi, 

Phenomenex) (150 x 4.60 mm, 5 ?m) maintained at 30ºC. The mobile phase consisted of 

0.1% TFA in water (eluent A) and 0.1% TFA in ACN:water (90:10) (eluent B). A linear 

gradient was preformed from 67% of eluent A till 45%, during 11.5 minutes. The solvent 

flow was 1 mL/min and peaks were detected at 205 nm. The injection volumes were 20 

µL and 80 µL for insulin standard curve and insulin release assay, respectively.

4.Results and Discussion 

 

 

 

 

 

1. Formulation of PLGA-nanoparticles 

 

Nanoparticles were produced based on procedures describe in the recent 

literature (Wang et al., 2008;Chen et al., 2014) by the W/O/W method. The polymer 

selected was PLGA with a 75:25 ratio (75% lactic acid and 25% glycolic acid).  This PLGA 

composition has been widely used to encapsulate proteins, such as catalase and insulin 

(Sun et al., 2010;Chen et al., 2014;Chen et al., 2015) because PLGA with high lactic acid 

content shows slower degradation rates and lead to more hydrophobic particles with 

less water absorption, slower polymer hydrolysis and slower drug release rate (Mittal et 

al., 2007). By contrast, hydrophilic nanoparticles made from PLGA with high glycolic 

content, suffer fast degradation. An important aspect of PLGA 75:25 is its high glass 

transition temperature (Tg). Tg is the temperature at which the transition of a solid to a 

molten state occurs, and, being high, ensures maintenance of polymer solid state during 

storage as well as in physiological conditions. Tg decreases with molecular weight and 

lactic content (Passerini et al., 2001;Kapoor et al., 2015) and, for PLGA 75:25 Tg is 

approximately 45°C.  

A double emulsion method was used for nanoparticle production. DCM was used 

to dissolve the polymer and its complete removal was carried out by overnight 

evaporation.  



4.Results and Discussion 

38 
 

A key aspect in nanoparticle formulation is the use of surfactants. Higher 

concentrations of surfactants are associated with more stable and smaller nanoparticles, 

less aggregation and better physical properties. On the other hand, the risk of toxicity is 

higher and thorough elimination of the surfactant must be through successive washes 

which is an important step after nanoparticles production. In the present work, 2% PVA 

was used to control surface tension and achieve small mean particle size. (Zambaux et 

al., 1998;Sahoo et al., 2002). 

 

 

2. Catalase encapsulation and activity study 

 

The objective of this part of this work was to immobilize catalase within PLGA 

nanoparticles, while maintaining its activity. Catalase encapsulation was based on Chen 

et al, 2014. Before immobilization, the solubilisation of catalase was studied in several 

conditions and its activity was measured to establish the procedure that leads to the 

lowest activity loss. 

 

2.1.Optimization of catalase activity assay 

A reference catalase test was initially established for use in the catalase 

deactivation studies. This reference test sets the specific assay conditions to be later 

used to evaluate catalase activity. Following this, the linear activity interval for the 

substrate and enzyme concentrations was determined.  

The extension of the reaction was studied by continuous monitoring the 

absorbance at 240 nm during 70 minutes (figure 4.1). Catalase concentrations of 1 U/mL 

and 10 U/mL were tested (in 40 mM H2O2 in 500 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.0).

To study catalase activity within nanoparticles, a direct and non-continuous 

method (3.2.2 at Methods) was needed due to the optical density of nanoparticles in 

suspension which interfered with the absorbance at 240 nm. Following this, a non-

continuous method was adopted, where the reaction was stopped and nanoparticles 

were removed by centrifugation, prior to absorbance reading. 

The conditions of the assay were optimized using free catalase in 500 mM 

phosphate buffer to which a diluted H2O2 solution was added. The activity assay 

progressed at 25ºC and pH 7.0. Catalase activity (figure 4.2) was evaluated at different 

enzyme (2.5; 5 and 10 U/mL at 40 mM of H2O2) and substrate concentrations (20, 40 and 

80 mM of H2O2; at 5U/mL of catalase). 

A decrease in the absorbance at 240 nm with time was observed along with H2O2 

consumption by catalase, reflected in a negative slope, as illustrated in figure 4.2 (A and 

C).

Figure 4.2.B shows a linear variation of the catalase activity between 2.5 and 10 

U/mL using 40 mM of H2O2. Figure 4.2.D also shows a proportional variation of catalase 

activity with H2O2 concentration (20–80 mM) at 5 U/mL of catalase. The linear 

dependence observed in figure 4.2.D corresponds to the initial Michaelis-Menten 

kinetics profile bellow the catalase KM (1.1 M) (Ogura, 1955;Haber et al., 1993). 

According to these results, that show a linear dependence of enzyme activity with 

catalase and substrate concentration, the conditions chosen for the reference test were: 

a catalase concentration of  5.0 U/mL and 40 mM of H2O2. 

 

2.2.Catalase solubilisation test 

A catalase solubilisation test was performed in order to find the best conditions 

before immobilization within nanoparticles. Catalase activity was tested in water, 500 

mM of phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and a 10 mM solution of HCl. Phosphate buffer is the

most commonly used solution to dissolve catalase although water is also used in many 

protocols. HCl was ultimately chosen since an acidic pH is required to dissolve insulin in a 

later step of nanoparticle preparation. Catalase activity was evaluated (figure 4.3.A) by 

measuring directly the disappearance of H2O2 at 240 nm using the continuous method 

(3.2.1 at Methods) . 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The activity observed for catalase was 0.346, 0.430 and 0.477 µmol/min when 

the enzyme was dissolved in 10 mM HCl, water and phosphate buffer, respectively. 

Catalase activity is slightly dependent on the type of solution used for reconstitution, 

being lower in 10 mM HCl (pH 2.0) and water than phosphate buffer. Following this,

catalase activity. Three different conditions were tested including the use of: ultrasound 

dissolution during 10 seconds, vortex dissolution during 1 minute or slow dissolution in 

buffer overnight at 10°C without stirring (figure 4.3.B) leading to different activities of: 

0.477, 0.219 and 0.507 µmol/min, respectively. These results demonstrate that the 

dissolution method strongly influences catalase activity, being ultrasounds and overnight 

slow dissolution at 10°C the best options for catalase dissolution in contrast with vortex 

that shows less than half of the activity observed for the two other options. 

The decision was that catalase should be solubilized in 500 mM phosphate buffer 

at pH 7.0, using ultrasounds or overnight slow dissolution at 10°C. 

 

2.3.Catalase immobilization 

 

2.3.1.Process optimization 

The main reason for the use of PLGA-catalase nanoparticles as reported by Chen 

et al, 2014 was is its capacity to only release its cargo in the presence of 100 µM H2O2 

within the first 15 hours. When the aim is to have a controlled drug release in response 

to a specific stimulus, as in this case, minimal cargo release in buffer solution and low 

burst release are two necessary conditions. According to the reported work, catalase 

was encapsulated within PLGA nanoparticles by a two step emulsion (W/O/W) process, 

but in contrast to Chen et al, 2014, nanoparticles were dried overnight by speedvac, 

with the purpose of removing water and consequently increasing stability during storage 

at -20°C (Fonte et al., 2012). Unfortunately, this immobilization method led to a very low 

and almost undetectable catalase activity. 

Following this, several attempts were made in order to overcome this issue, 

including: reducing speedvac drying period to 3 hours, changing buffer for ethanol 

during speedvac drying and lyophilisation. A patented method (Muzykantov et al., 2012) 

was also tested where the first emulsion was produced at subzero temperatures using 

dry ice and acetone bath. The second emulsion and all other steps were reproduced 

following Chen et al, 2014 procedure, but once again disappointing results were 

obtained in respect to the low catalase activity.

In face of these disappointing results a further attempt was made following 

exactly all Chen et al, 2014 protocol conditions, including nanoparticles storage in a 

buffer solution but still, catalase activity was undetectable.  

After several trial and error attempts it was found that producing both the first 

and second emulsions by sonication, allowed maintaining catalase activity, probably due 

to the production of more stable emulsions. The use of this apparently obvious solution 

had been postponed due to the need of spending large quantities of catalase and PLGA 

to produce the first emulsion through this method. An optimization of the sonication 

time was also needed. Some attempts to produce these nanoparticles were made with 

large sonication times (1 minute) according to Chen et al, 2014 protocol, but it caused 

high activity loss. Reducing the primary emulsion sonication time to 10 seconds was 

enough to produce a stable emulsion and retain some catalase activity. In these 

preliminary tests catalase activity was evaluated by a visual observation of the oxygen 

bubbles produced after H2O2 break down. These preliminary tests were important to 

gain some insight on the critical steps during nanoparticle production. Sonication may 

induce protein aggregation and activity loss due to shear stress and high temperatures. 

Because of that, sonication time showed to be a critical step that was optimized in order 

to obtain a stable emulsion with minimal catalase deactivation. 

 

2.3.2.Physical characterization of the nanoparticles produced  
 

After this initial optimization, four different formulations were produced (table 3-

1): 

A.  Formulation A was based on Chen et al, 2014 protocol including the 

above described changes to improve catalase activity. With the purpose to decrease 

catalase inactivation during nanoparticles formulation, glycerol and BSA were two 

additives tested. According to reported work, glycerol stabilizes catalase native structure 

and helps to preserve its activity (Costa et al., 2002). No significant catalase activity 

differences were observed between these two additives, but both increased the activity 

of encapsulated catalase. Following this glycerol was chosen in order to simplify catalase 

quantification that would be difficult with addition of another protein to the system.  



4.Results and Discussion 

44 
 

B.  Formulation B was prepared with catalase and 2.5% glycerol in 1% PVA 

emulsified within PLGA in DCM (first emulsion) (Costa et al., 2002). 

C. The same concentration of 500 mM phosphate buffer was added to 

produce first and second emulsion in formulation C, maintaining osmotic pressure in 

both emulsions and preventing catalase displace from internal to external phase.  

D. Formulation D is a combination of formulation B and C comprising both 

2.5% glycerol to produce the first emulsion and the use of phosphate buffer in both 

emulsions. 

Physical properties of formulations A–D were studied (table 4-1).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Particles average size was between 239 and 459 nm, a mean size above 200 nm, 

which is the appropriate value for therapeutic use (Singh et al., 2009;Sharma et al., 

2015). Both formulations A and B show mean particles sizes similar to those obtained by 

Chen et al, 2014, where a value of 230 nm was obtained. Formulations C and D have a 

larger mean particle size, which appears to be due to the use of phosphate buffer in 

both emulsions. This can be explained by an increased polarity of the second emulsion 

due to the presence of phosphate buffer, which leads to a slower evaporation of DCM 

causing increased coalescence and by this was also an increased particle size (Yang et al., 

2001;Wang, 2010). Moreover, glycerol adsorption on particles surface can also promote 

an enhanced size (Sameti et al., 2003;Fonte et al., 2012). Besides particle size, 

phosphate buffer increases the yield of formulation C, but not formulation D where 

glycerol is also present. 

The polydispersity index for all formulations was also evaluated as this parameter 

gives information about the distribution of the particles size: a more homogeneous 

system has a lower polydispersity value. Polydispersity values range from 0 to 1 and a 

system with a high homogeneous population is characterized by a polydispersity index

above 0.1. Both formulations B and D present the lowest values (0.21 and 0.46, 

respectively), whereas formulation A and C have a polydispersity index of 0.75 and 0.80, 

respectively (Gaumet et al., 2008).  

All nanoparticles have a zeta potential of -2 mV, except formulation D showing -

5.14 mV. The negative surface charge of the PLGA matrix is the cause of these negative 

zeta potential values (Sameti et al., 2003;Fonte et al., 2012). Zeta potential gives 

information about colloidal suspension stability: particles with zeta potential higher than 

+ 30 mV or lower than -30 mV are considered stable colloidal suspensions (Mukherjee et 

al., 2008). For all formulations the value is low, which implies poor stability and high 

aggregation propensity.  

It is important to overcome stability problems in order to decrease nanoparticles 

aggregation and chemical instability during storage, such as: polymer hydrolysis and 

drug interactions. Therefore, the lyophilisation of nanoparticles should be chosen as 

storage method to overcome these instability problems.  

SEM images confirmed spherical shape and nanoparticle small size. Figure 4.4 

shows the difference between the smallest (A) and the largest particles (B). It can also be 

observed that formulation D shows a heterogeneous particle size. In accordance to 

polydispersity index (table 4-1), formulation D has a more homogeneous population 

than formulation A, which contrast with the SEM images. One possible justification for 

this contrary information is the possibility of particle fusion during SEM observation, due 

to high vacuum and electron emission.

2.3.3.Encapsulation efficiency  

The encapsulation efficiency observed is low, not higher than 2.9%, as previously 

observed by Fonte et al, 2015 for the encapsulation of proteins with high lactic acid 

content PLGA (more hydrophobic) due to decreased PLGA-protein interaction and 

consequently poorer protein encapsulation (Fonte et al., 2015). However, in the present 

case this low efficiency may end up being sufficient for the purpose taking into 

consideration the high efficiency of catalase in the decomposition of H2O2. Moreover, 

glycerol presence could have influenced catalase encapsulation due to increased first 

emulsion stability, but the encapsulation efficiency was similar for all formulations (table 

4-1), meaning that the presence of glycerol and phosphate buffer did not influence 

encapsulation. 

 

2.3.4.Activity and stability  

Concerning catalase activity, the main goal of this study was to evaluate the 

advantages of glycerol and 500 mM phosphate buffer addition in order to increase 

catalase stability and activity. Catalase activity was studied at day zero, when the 

nanoparticles were produced and fifteen days after to evaluate stability (figure 4.5).

At day 0, catalase activity of formulations A, B, C and D was 8.1, 14.5, 12.3 and 

12.1 µmol/min, respectively. Nanoparticles formulated using glycerol and phosphate 

buffer in the second emulsion (B, C and D) show higher activity at day 0, when 

comparing with formulation A. In this case, the catalase activity is more than twice 

higher than without using these additives. The results confirm the advantage of using 

glycerol in the first emulsion and phosphate buffer in the second one in order to 

increase the activity of encapsulated catalase contributing to reduce enzymatic 

denaturation and the shear stress (Costa et al., 2002). Another possibility that may 

explain the good results obtained with glycerol, is the presence of larger pores within 

PLGA matrix formed after glycerol washing, that may contribute to reduced restrictions 

for the diffusion of H2O2, increasing the process efficiency (Real, 2010)  

Previous results obtained in our laboratory (unpublished) showed that the 

stability of free catalase was poor, having a half-life time of approximately three days. 

Our expectations were that the immobilization process could increase its stability as 

observed for many other enzymes, including: naringinase, lipase, trypsin and peroxidase 

(Mateo et al., 2007;Real, 2010;Montalvo-Ortiz et al., 2012;Du et al., 2013). As described 

on figure 4.6, increased stability was observed for all the formulations tested in 

comparison to half-life of free catalase (t1/2= 3 days) Formulation A and D shows a half-

life of 7 days, whereas for formulations B and C  it increases up to 9 and 10 days, 

respectively (figure 4.6). These results corroborate the existence of a protective effect of

the immobilization procedure in relation to catalase native structure. This aspect gains 

importance in therapeutic administration, being essential to enzymatic stability under 

physiologic conditions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Great attention was also given to the release profile of catalase. It is desirable 

that the nanoparticles only release their content whenever H2O2 is present. In the 

presence of H2O2, catalase breaks it down into water and oxygen that causes the 

formation of pores and the consequent cargo release from the nanoparticles. Following 

this, it is expected that the release of catalase only occurs in the presence of its 

substrate and that nanoparticles integrity is maintained in its absence. With the purpose 

to evaluate this, PLGA – catalase nanoparticles were incubated in phosphate buffer 

alone or containing H2O2. 

The release profile in the absence of H2O2 is presented in figure 4.7 where all 

formulations show a minimal catalase release that does not increase significantly with 

time. In the first 24 hours, a maximum of 15, 27, 19 and 20% of catalase release was 

achieved in formulations A, B, C and D, respectively. These low values of catalase release 

were constant over 24 hours and can be explained by the release of the catalase 

adsorbed onto the surface of the nanoparticles.

In the presence of H2O2 the release profile of catalase from PLGA nanoparticles 

could be described by the Higuchi model (Higuchi, 1963) as it can be observed on figure 

4.8. Higuchi purposed a mathematical model that describes drug release from a matrix. 

The drug diffusion process is dependent on the square root of time according to 

equation 5, where A is the amount of drug amount released during time t and KH is the 

Higuchi dissolution constant: 

 

? = KH ?  ?
1/2                                                     (5) 

 

The release profile of all formulations studied show a common, and usually 

considered undesirable feature, consisting on an instant catalase release, known as 

burst effect. In this case, burst effect is in fact desirable, meaning that the nanoparticles 

will respond fast to the presence of H2O2. The burst effect may be caused by: low 

stability of the first emulsion, catalase adsorption to particles surface and high porosity. 

Formulation A and B show the lowest initial catalase release value, approximately 

between 24% and 33% whereas formulation C and D have a higher burst effect. 

Formulations C and D showing approximately 45% of catalase release at 0 h were 

selected as the best formulations.

4.Results and Discussion 

50 
 

After the instant catalase release observed for all formulations, more than 50% 

of catalase content was released in the first 24 hours. The maximum amount of catalase 

released from formulations B, C and D were respectively 65, 81 and 85%, whereas 

formulation A shows the lowest catalase release of approximately 50% in the first 24 

hours. This incomplete release occurs probably due to protein-polymer and protein-

protein interactions (Fonte et al., 2012), but also in this case formulations C and D were 

the best showing the highest catalase release. Moreover, these results demonstrate that 

catalase release is triggered by an H2O2 stimulus. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The presence of glycerol and phosphate buffer in the second emulsion is 

favorable for catalase encapsulation, decreasing its inactivation. In addition, the 

presence of these additives positively contributed to the intended release profile of 

catalase, consisting on a fast and high extension release in response to H2O2. Therefore, 

formulation D was selected for next steps of this work.

3. PLGA functionalization with GOx  

 

Formulation D was functionalized with GOx in order to produce nanoparticles 

sensitive to high glucose concentrations. GOx was immobilized on PLGA surface though 

an EDC-NHS crosslink. Enzyme activity, stability and functionalization efficiency was 

studied. 

A previous activity study with free GOx was performed to understand the ideal 

studying conditions using an indirect method that quantifies the produced H2O2 through 

the formation of a quinoneimine dye complex in the presence of peroxidase. GOx 

activity was studied following the reaction of 1.0 to 4.0 mU/mL of enzyme with 30 mM 

of glucose for approximately one hundred minutes (figure 4.9). Further GOx activity 

studies were conducted within forty minutes, ensuring less than 1% reaction extension. 

The absorbance at 520 nm increases with time, after the conversion of the produced 

H2O2 into a quinoneimine dye complex, which is reflected by a positive slope of the 

linear regressions, as illustrated on figure 4.10 (A and C). On Figure 4.10.B is observed a 

linear dependence of the GOx activity with the enzyme concentration between 1.0 and 

4.0 mU/mL of GOx, using 30 mM of glucose. Figure 4.10.D shows a proportional 

variation between GOx activity and glucose concentration (3.0 to 30 mM) at 4.0 mU/mL 

of enzyme.

The immobilization efficiency of GOx in PLGA was low, near 4.2% (table 4-2), and 

this result appears to be in accordance with literature results (Hurkat et al., 2012;Ayd?n, 

2013). According to recent reports, only a certain amount of GOx can bind to the particle 

surface and this is influenced by the pH of the immobilization process. In contrast with 

EDC-NHS protocol parameters, GOx immobilization increases up to 70% at pH 4.0 value, 

while no more than 14% is achieved at pH 6.0. In our case, the immobilization process 

was conducted at pH 7.0, which appear to reduce immobilization to even lower values. 

 

 

 

 

Approximately 0.21 U/mL of immobilized GOx showed an activity of 0.092 

µmol/min with 30 mM of glucose at 25°C and pH 7.0. Taking into account that only 4.2%

of GOx was immobilized, this remaining GOx showed a catalytic efficiency coefficient of 

30.2% when comparing with free GOx. In the case of GOx the diffusion of the substrate 

across the PLGA nanoparticles is not a limiting factor as for catalase but other factors do 

exist such as the possibility of binding of the active site to PLGA which inactivates GOx 

and also due to external diffusional limitations of the substrate (Kazenwadel et al., 

2015).  

The stability of GOx activity after immobilization was studied for fifteen days at 

25°C and pH 7.0. The half-life time of the immobilized GOx was found to be 64 days 

which is similar to the value found for free GOx of 66 days (figure 4.11). In the case of 

GOx, its immobilization at the nanoparticle surface didn’t influence its deactivation 

profile. Free GOx was already very stable (t1/2 = 66 days) when compared to free catalase 

(t1/2 = 3 days). The increased stability observed for encapsulated catalase (t1/2 = 6-10 

days, approximately three fold higher than free catalase) and not for GOx shows the 

importance of the encapsulation process to protect the native state of the enzymes in 

opposition to the functionalization at the nanoparticles surface. Approximately 0.21 

U/mL of immobilized GOx is capable of producing 20 µM of H2O2 from 30 mM of glucose 

in forty minutes. The glucose concentration used (30 mM) is approximately four times 

higher than blood glucose concentration in hyperglycaemic conditions (7.8 mM), which 

could mean that the small H2O2 amount produced could be insufficient to promote 

oxygen production by catalase and causing insulin delivery. Due to pH influence in GOx 

immobilization efficiency, this process has to be tested at lower pH after insulin 

encapsulation process optimization, in order to reach an adequate GOx functionalization 

and H2O2 production.

4. Insulin encapsulation 

 

In order to obtain an insulin delivery system sensitive to glucose as described on 

Figure 1.5, insulin was co-encapsulated with catalase within PLGA. Insulin release profile 

aims to be fast in the presence of H2O2 and minimal in a buffer solution without H2O2. 

The same process used for producing formulation A, was used for producing insulin and 

catalase loaded nanoparticles (formulation AI). The process used for formulation D was 

now used for nanoparticles loaded with insulin (formulation DI). 

The encapsulation efficiency of insulin was 11.3 and 36.4% for formulation AI and 

DI, respectively (table 4-3). This large difference may be due to the high stability of the 

first emulsion in case of formulation DI, where glycerol is present, however it did not 

influence catalase encapsulation (table 4-1).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Insulin release profile was studied in a similar way as for catalase, except for H2O2 

concentration solution and protein quantification method. In detail, the high H2O2 

concentration used in catalase release assay was replaced by 100 µM of H2O2, which is a 

closer value to what may be achieved in endogenous conditions and was already used 

by Chen et al, 2014 to mimic H2O2 concentrations detected in hypoxic tumours. Insulin 

was quantified by HPLC (figure 4.12) instead of using Bradford assay to avoid 

interference from the presence of another protein, catalase, and also a higher precision 

is achieved by HPLC (Wang et al., 2008). Insulin release was analyzed after incubation 

with phosphate buffer with or without H2O2.

As well as for catalase, insulin release profile can be described by Higuchi’s model 

for drug release. Insulin release in formulation AI did not show any differences between 

buffer alone or with H2O2, showing an initial 10% release and approximately 35% after 3 

hours (figure 4.13.A). This burst release of insulin may be caused by the release of 

adsorbed insulin on PLGA surface. In this case, the burst release effect is undesirable, 

but worse than that is the fact that insulin release doesn’t seem to be triggered by H2O2 

but only by diffusion since both release profiles with and without H2O2 are identical. 

Concerning this issue, formulation DI (figure 4.13.B) behaves a little bit better but it also 

shows a similar burst release of 7% and only a slight difference between the insulin 

release profiles in buffer comparing to H2O2 solution starting at 0.5 hours. Based on this 

small difference, further optimization of formulation DI occurred.

At this point, two approaches were selected in order to increase the difference 

already observed between the two insulin release profiles observed for formulation DI 

both with and without H2O2. An increased catalase amount was used in formulation G, 

to increase oxygen production and produce more numerous and bigger porous when 

H2O2 was present. Another strategy was to dry the nanoparticles instead of storing them 

in a buffer solution. By doing this, we aimed to decrease the pore size that for instance 

could be too large in order to avoid insulin leaching. Nanoparticles were dried after 

particles formulation in a speedvac (formulation H) or through lyophilisation/freeze

drying (formulation I). Speedvac is a process to evaporate solvents under vacuum and 

heat, not often used to dry nanoparticles. In contrast, lyophilisation is a widely used 

technique to dry nanoparticles based on removing water from a frozen sample by 

sublimation. This technique is extensively used to promote and increased physical 

stabilization of nanoparticles for a long period of time. Both techniques promote water 

elimination from nanoparticles which can reduce surface pore number and size. 

Comparing formulations DI, G, H and I, formulations DI, H and I, show similar 

values for yield, encapsulation efficiency and loading (table 4-3) reflecting the use of the 

same formulation process except the drying step. Only formulation G shows a lower 

value for insulin encapsulation. One possible explanation for this is the competition 

between insulin and catalase for the entrapment, leading to an insulin entrapment 

decrease due to the higher catalase content. An enhanced catalase amount used during 

encapsulation (formulation G) didn’t however promote a better insulin release in the 

presence of H2O2, probably because the porous polymer structure was maintained 

causing insulin leaching once again (figure 4.14.A).  

In formulation H, mean particle size and zeta potential have similar values to 

formulation D (PLGA-catalase) and formulation DI (PLGA-catalase-insulin), since all these 

formulations are composed by the same constituents. Moreover, catalase was active 

(observable at naked eye) and insulin encapsulation was 31.54% (table 4-2). Insulin 

release was approximately 10% at 0h; increasing to 15% independently of being in the 

presence of H2O2 (figure 4.14.B). In comparison with insulin release profile of 

formulation DI, a reduced insulin release occurs at 1 hour which can be explained by a 

reduced pore size. However, no differences were observed regarding insulin release in 

the presence or absence of H2O2. Although no information was found in literature about 

how speedvac may influence the production of PLGA nanoparticles, the temperature 

inside the speedvac may reach 30°C, which may contribute to catalase deactivation.

Formulation I was freeze dried during 24 hours and its physical properties, insulin 

encapsulation and release profile were compared with formulation H. Both formulations 

H and I show similar insulin encapsulation efficiency: 31.54% and 33.98%, respectively 

(table 4-3). However, insulin release profile was reduced and only a minimal amount of 

insulin, approximately 5%, was released after 1 hour both in buffer and in H2O2 solution 

(figure 4.15). To this result is added the fact that the mean particle size of formulation I 

is 740 nm, highly above the other formulations particles size (table 4-3). Taken together, 

these results indicate particles aggregation that lead to a decreased surface area and

reduced buffer contact/penetration into particles. Therefore, low insulin release is 

achieved. No differences in insulin release in the presence or absence of H2O2 was 

achieved probably due to low catalase activity. A possible explanation for the low 

catalase activity is the lyophilisation process itself, due to the cold shock and ice-water 

interfaces (Shikama et al., 1961;Panyam et al., 2003;Lale et al., 2011). In fact, some 

drawbacks are known for lyophilisation such as aggregation and mechanical stress 

related to alterations of protein stability and release profile (Fonte et al., 2012). 

Moreover, an excessive pore reduction can also be the reason for the minimal insulin 

release observed. Less and more reduced pores decrease H2O2 diffusion through PLGA 

nanoparticles, which decreases oxygen production. Pore size shall be large enough to 

allow H2O2 fast diffusion but not so large that cause insulin leaching. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Both formulation H and I were also studied by SEM (figure 4.16), where glycerol 

presence was found. Glycerol is detected by the presence of a matrix embedding the 

nanoparticles, an aspect that was also observed in recent literature where other 

lyoprotectants were used to prevent particles aggregation and improve stabilization 

during lyophilisation (Fonte et al., 2012;Fonte et al., 2015). Besides glycerol presence in 

both formulations H and I, is possible to observe particle aggregation of formulation H 

and I. Large aggregates in formulation I are in accordance with the high particle mean

size already stated (figure 4.16.B). However, nanoparticles aggregation was also found in 

formulation H (figure 4.16.A) which contrasts with a mean particle size of approximately 

406 nm. This contradictory information can be due to SEM technique conditions, such as 

high vacuum and temperatures that can promote nanoparticles fusion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Comparing the size of insulin and catalase (figure 4.17), insulin is much smaller as 

confirmed by its hydrodynamic radius of 11 Å (Mw = 5 kDa) in relation to catalase with 

50 Å (Mw= 250 kDa) (Hovgaard et al., 1996;Harding, 1999;Brodin et al., 2015). Based on 

this and regarding both catalase and insulin release profiles studied, we can justify the 

fast insulin release observed without H2O2 may be due to its small size. The reduced 

insulin size promotes an easy escape of insulin though the porous PLGA nanoparticles 

structure. To solve this issue in future experiments a larger insulin molecule could be 

used. According to reported work, pegylated insulin hexamers are molecules with an 

increased molecular weight of approximately 300 kDa (Lim et al., 2011). Having an 

insulin molecule with a similar molecular weight as catalase it is expected that insulin 

release profile changes and approaches catalase release profile. Therefore, pegylated 

insulin hexamers should be released only in the presence of H2O2 with a minimal release 

in its absence.

5. Concluding Remarks and Future Perspectives  

 

Optimization of a PLGA nanoparticles formulation containing catalase, insulin and 

GOx was performed, towards the development of a glucose sensitive insulin delivery 

system.  

Catalase was encapsulated in PLGA showing three fold increased stability over 

time comparing to free catalase. A release profile could be observed in response to the 

presence of H2O2. Also, the addition of glycerol and phosphate buffer to the formulation 

was concluded to be more benefic to catalase stability and release. PLGA nanoparticles 

were decorated with GOx and a high enzymatic activity and stability over time were 

achieved. 

PLGA nanoparticles co-encapsulating catalase and insulin were also successfully 

produced. Several attempts to control insulin release were studied, highlighting the 

influence of the formulation process in the particle structure and surface characteristics. 

In contrast to the good results initially observed for the release profile of catalase, 

insulin release was not triggered by the presence of H2O2. Insulin was released from 

PLGA nanoparticles even in the absence of H2O2. It is possible that the optimized 

immobilization conditions for catalase are not suitable for insulin. Most probably the 

PLGA surface porosity is too large to prevent insulin from leaching, since insulin is 

smaller than catalase. 

Further optimization must be conducted with the objective of better 

understanding and controlling insulin leaching and to achieve a formulation where 

insulin release is triggered by the presence of H2O2 only. An approach to overcome rapid 

insulin release from PLGA nanoparticles can be its encapsulation in a more complex 

formulation, such as pegylated insulin hexamers. Pegylated insulin hemaxamer molecule 

(300 kDa) has a similar molecular weight to catalase (250 kDa) and due to that it may 

promote a reduced insulin release from PLGA nanoparticles in non-stimulus conditions.  



Preparation and evaluation of an insulin delivery system sensitive to hyperglycaemia 

 

63 
 

After the production of a PLGA-catalase-insulin system adequate to the 

therapeutic effect, PLGA-catalase-insulin decorated with surface GOx should be studied 

and a possible GOx immobilization optimization shall be further conducted. Based on 

these optimizations, an insulin delivery system sensitive to blood glucose concentrations 

shall be achieved. Finally, in vitro assays to ensure biocompatibility and in vivo studies to 

evaluate bioavailability and therapeutic effect also need to be performed.
