Resumo 

 

A Ria de Aveiro é um sistema lagunar pouco profundo situado na 
costa noroeste portuguesa, separado do mar por uma ilha barreira e está 
ligado ao mar por um canal fixado pelos molhes Norte e Sul. Neste 
trabalho pretende-se estudar as alterações das marés induzidas por 
modificações geomorfológicas entre 1987/88 a 2017, verificando as 
alterações na amplitude e fase dos constituintes de maré: ?2, ?2,  ?4 , ?6  
e ???, durante esse intervalo de tempo. Este trabalho também visa a 
determinação da frequência das sobre-elevações da maré de origem 
meteorológica na Ria de Aveiro, entre 2012 e 2017, determinando quais 
os fatores que mais as influenciam - variação na pressão atmosférica, 
intensidade e direção do vento e precipitação. Os dados utilizados neste 
trabalho foram recolhidos por marégrafos localizados nos principais canais 
da laguna. Foram elaborados gráficos de variação anual da amplitude e da 
fase dos constituintes de maré: ?2, ?2,  ?4 , ?6  e ??? (determinados por 
análise harmónica usando a aplicação T-Tide do Matlab), para estudar a 
sua evolução entre 1987/88 e 2017, permitindo assim, verificar a 
existência de alterações relevantes ao longo do tempo.  Séries anuais da 
maré meteorológica foram determinadas para cada ano entre o período 
de 2012 a 2017, subtraindo ao nível da água medido nos marégrafos a 
previsão da maré astronómica, para se fazer o estudo da distribuição das 
anomalias positivas e negativas em cada estação estudada, e 
compreendendo a relação entre as variáveis meteorológicas e a formação 
da sobre-elevação das marés. Com esta finalidade, foram elaborados 
gráficos da pressão atmosférica, intensidade e direção do vento, 
precipitação, o nível da água medido e com as residuais. A partir dos 
resultados obtidos, verifica-se que, para cada estação, de uma forma geral, 
os valores anuais de amplitude dos constituintes estudados, estão a 
aumentar enquanto a fase está a diminuir. Entre 1987/88 e 2002/03 houve 
um aumento de amplitude nas estações estudadas, sendo esta mudança 
uma consequência do aumento da profundidade dos canais de navegação 
devido às operações de dragagem realizadas em 1998. De 2012 a 2017, e 
após o aumento do molhe Norte, os valores anuais permitem concluir que 
não há variações significativas na amplitude ou fase. Assim, o aumento do 
molhe Norte não produziu mudanças significativas na dinâmica da maré 
na Ria de Aveiro. Através da análise da maré meteorológica, verificou-se 
que as anomalias positivas são mais frequentes do que anomalias 
negativas. Dos diferentes eventos ocorridos entre 2012 e 2017, apenas 
dois influenciaram toda a laguna, tendo sido determinados pelas 
condições meteorológicas adversas verificadas a nível nacional. Os 
restantes apenas ocorreram localmente. Os eventos de anomalias 
negativas ocorreram em menor número. Verificou-se ainda, que os valores 
mais altos do nível da água do mar registados não resultaram da existência 
de marés meteorológicas, mas foram devidos às marés vivas. Portanto, a 
ocorrência conjunta de marés vivas e condições meteorológicas extremas 
será um risco para as zonas envolventes à laguna, já que poderão ficar 
sujeitas a inundações.

Abstract 

 

Ria de Aveiro is a shallow lagoon, located in the Northwest of 
Portugal, separated from the sea by a barrier island, with which is connected 
through an artificial channel fixed by breakwaters. This work aims to study 
the tidal changes induce by geomorphologic modifications occurred in Ria 
de Aveiro between 1987/88 and 2017, analysing the variations on the tidal 
amplitude and phase of tidal constituents: ?2 , ?2,  ?4 , ?6  and ???. This 
work also aims to determine the frequency of storm surge phenomena 
occurrence, between 2012 and 2017, determining which factors influence 
the generation of the storm - variation in atmospheric pressure, intensity 
and direction of the wind and precipitation - and verify the increase of the 
water level in Ria de Aveiro caused by these meteorological events. Data 
were collected on tidal gauges in the main channels of the lagoon. Annual 
amplitude and phase variation graphics of tidal constituents: ?2 , ?2,  ?4 , 
?6  and ??? (which were computed using the T-Tide Matlab package), were 
drawn for the different years. This allowed to observe the annual tidal 
evolution and to verify if there had been any relevant changes during the 
time interval in which the data collection took place.  Annual series of the 
residual meteorological tide were determined for each year between 2012 
and 2017, by subtracting the astronomical predicted tides from the 
measured tidal signal, and to identify the distribution of the positive and 
negative anomalies in each station studied, and find the relationship 
between meteorological variables and the generation of tidal elevations. 
For this purpose, were drawn graphs of the atmospheric pressure, wind 
intensity and direction, precipitation and water level and residual graphs. 
From the results obtained, in general and for each station, the annual 
amplitude values are increasing while the phase is decreasing. Between 
1987/88 and 2002/03 there was an increase in amplitude in the studied 
stations. This change is a consequence of the increase in the depth of the 
navigation channels due to dredging operations in 1998. From 2012 to 2017 
and after the North breakwater extension there are no significant variations 
in tidal amplitude or phase. Thus, the extension of the North breakwater did 
not produce appreciable changes in the tidal dynamics in Ria de Aveiro. By 
the analysis of the meteorological tide was verified that positive anomalies 
are more frequent than negative. From the different events occurring 
between 2012 and 2017, only two positive storm surges influenced the 
entire lagoon, having been generated by adverse meteorological conditions 
verified at national level. The remaining were manifested only locally. The 
events with negative anomalies occurred in a smaller number. From the 
analysis of all the studied events, it was verified that the higher values of the 
level of the sea water did not result from the existence of meteorological 
tides, but from the spring tides. Therefore, the joining of a positive storm 
event at high tide of spring tides will constitute a high risk for the marginal 
areas of the lagoon, which may be flooded.

1. Introduction 
 

1.1. Motivation and Aims 
 

Coastal areas are subject to great natural and anthropogenic pressures. Due to their 

physical characteristics, these areas provide exceptional conditions for biological productivity, as 

well as industry, commercial and urban development. Ria de Aveiro is an example of this, a very 

important area on the Portuguese coast that provides natural conditions for harbour, navigation, 

industry and recreational facilities, but also offers good conditions for agriculture and aquaculture. 

Because of these exceptional conditions, it is a densely populated place that intensifies 

anthropogenic pressures. 

Ria de Aveiro is highly influenced by marine and fluvial interaction (Plecha et al, 2014), being 

a dynamic system strongly dependent on tidal action. The lagoon has been subject to several 

changes, not only caused by nature, which include the effects of storms, winds, tides and sea level 

rise, on the local erosion and deposition, but also by anthropogenic factors, which are generally 

related to fishing, agriculture, tourism and coastal works (Vaz and Dias, 2011). Over the last years 

its geomorphology has undergone changes that will specifically affect their tidal characteristics, 

making these systems more vulnerable to risks of flooding and increasing the salinization of the 

adjacent land, as well as hindering the navigation in the shallow channels. The propagation of tides 

in coastal environments, heavily depends on their morphological configuration (Dias and Picado, 

2011), so a constant motorization of these natural systems is necessary in order to predict the 

consequences caused in their hydrodynamics and thus to intervene with some anticipation, since 

these natural systems are of such socioeconomic importance.  

The extreme meteorological factors are also important in the dynamics of the estuary, as 

these will affect the meteorological tide, which is directly related to atmospheric pressure, wind 

and precipitation, having an impact in the water level elevation, particularly in shallow areas such 

as Ria de Aveiro. At times, these conditions interact in a complex way to increase or decrease the 

water levels significantly above or under predicted tide heights. Storm surges generated through 

these meteorological conditions induce great navigational and other hazards, such as the flooding 

of adjacent land (Ribbat, 2012). Another factor that can cause flooding is the long periods of strong 

winds, which can induce water accumulation on one side of the channels. 

This thesis intends to study the tidal changes induced by geomorphologic modifications 

between 1987/88 and 2017, using the analysis of tidal constituents: ?2  (semi-diurnal lunar tide), 

?2(solar-semi diurnal tide),  ?4  (quadric-diurnal tide), ?6 (hexa-diurnal tide) and ??? (long period 

tide) in several channels of Ria de Aveiro.  

This thesis also aims to determine the frequency of storm surge phenomena occurrence, 

between 2012 and 2017, determining which factors most influence the generation of the storm - 

variation in atmospheric pressure, intensity and direction of the wind and precipitation - and to 

verify the increase in water level in Ria de Aveiro caused by these meteorological events.

1.2. Work Structure 
 

This MSc thesis includes six Chapters. 

Chapter 1 presents the motivation and aims, the structure of this work and the state of the art 

about the problem that is researched. 

 Theoretical concepts about astronomical and meteorological tides is described in Chapter 2. 

In Chapter 3 are described the main characteristics and location of Ria de Aveiro.  

The description of the methodology followed in this work is presented in Chapter 4, including 

the details about the water level and the meteorological data, and also the data processing analyses 

(tidal harmonic and non-tidal components). 

Chapter 5 includes the results and the discussion concerning the tidal components analysed in 

this work – tidal harmonic analysis and meteorological residual analysis. 

Finally, the main conclusions are presented in Chapter 6. 

 

 

1.3. State of the Art 
 

Coastal systems are natural environments of extreme importance, not only because of their 

biological richness, but also because they are places with optimal conditions to accommodate 

infrastructures of various sectors, namely agricultural, port, industrial and recreational, among 

others. Consequently, these coastal systems are constantly suffering with pressures of natural and 

anthropogenic origin. 

The understanding of the evolution of the lagoon systems at several levels, as biological, 

chemical, physical and others, led the scientific community to carry out several studies that later 

resulted in several publications. Ria de Aveiro is an example of this, as can be verified by the large 

number of works on physical processes that have been published over the years, mainly resulting 

from numerical modelling simulations. 

One of the first studies carried out on hydrological characterization of Ria de Aveiro was 

done by Dias et al (1999), where authors concluded that the astronomical tide is the main forcing 

agent driving water circulation in the lagoon. The tide is semidiurnal and the tidal wave propagation 

in the lagoon has the characteristics of a damped progressive wave. The lunar principal, ?2 , and 

the solar principal, ?2, are the main tidal constituents. These authors also showed that Ria de Aveiro 

can be considered as vertically homogeneous, except occasionally when fresh water inflows are 

high, and the upper parts of the lagoon can present vertical stratification.  

Properties of tide and tidal currents in Ria de Aveiro are characterized and discussed by Dias 

et al (2000). These authors showed that tide propagates from the inlet are present in the entire 

lagoon. There is a tidal distortion inside the lagoon and during the propagation the tidal wave 



3 

 

amplitude decrease and the phase lag increases, results also found by Araújo (2005), the author 

compared amplitudes and phases values between 1987/88 and 2002/03. This author also 

determined that until 1987/88 most of the lagoon was flood-dominant, and since then the central 

section of Ria de Aveiro has become ebb-dominant, while the northern and southern sections 

remain flood-dominant. Dias (2011) pointed out that the deepening of the inlet channel and 

surrounding area is one of the main causes for the changes in the characteristics of the tide that 

have been reported by several works about this topic (Dias et al. (1999), Dias et al (2009) and Araújo 

(2005)). 

To evaluate the effects on the Ria de Aveiro hydrodynamics due to changes in several 

natural and anthropogenic factors over the last years, other studies have been carried out. Dias and 

Picado (2011) studied the tidal dynamics changes induced by morphologic anthropogenic and 

natural modifications in channels depth and geometry of Ria de Aveiro. Their results of the model 

used, suggest that the amplitude of the tidal constituents ?2  and ?1 has increased and its phase 

has decreased in response to the increased depth of the inlet channel. When an enlargement of 

the flooded area is assumed, a slight decrease in tidal amplitude and an increase in phase lag are 

observed. The tidal prism at the lagoon mouth has increased from the past to the present and the 

enlargement of the flooded area also increased the tidal prism.  Similar conclusions were presented 

by Picado et al (2011) in relation to the increase of the flooded area. In this work, the authors also 

evaluated the consequences of the mean sea-water rise in the hydrodynamics of the Ria de Aveiro. 

This results in the amplitude increase and a phase decrease, as well as increasing flood and ebb 

currents and in the dominance of ebb (flood) in the central zone (upstream). Lopes et al (2013) also 

studied the changes induced by local morphological modifications in flooding extension, as well as 

in the tidal prism, between 1987 and 2012. These authors concluded that the lagoon deepening 

observed led to a generalized increase in the extension of the lagoon flooded area as well as in the 

tidal prism, making the lagoon more vulnerable to oscillations. 

Recently, Dias (2016a) presented results of investigations carried out mainly using 

numerical modelling techniques. The main objective was to characterise and study the temporal 

evolution of the tide in the Ria de Aveiro, between 1987/88 and 2012, in the context of the 

geomorphological evolution of the lagoon. During this time, a significant amplification of the tidal 

amplitude and its faster propagation along the lagoon main channels was identified. It was 

concluded that the properties of the tide in the Ria de Aveiro near the inlet are strongly dependent 

on the characteristics of the oceanic tide. Therefore, smaller differences are identified in the central 

area of the lagoon, which are larger in the head of the main channels. It was also verified that the 

evolution of the tide in the Ria de Aveiro is extremely influenced by the induced geomorphologic 

changes, both of natural and anthropogenic origin. This results in the increase of the tidal amplitude 

and in the decrease of the phase verified in the last decades, which are in part a consequence of 

the deepening of the inlet channel and the main channels of the lagoon. Another variable studied 

was the increase in the floodable area of the lagoon, that indirectly leads to an increase in the inlet 

channel depth. This responds to the intensification of dominant ebb currents in this zone, which in 

the future may lead to an increase in the tidal amplitude.  

The morphological evolution of the Ria de Aveiro inlet was analysed by Plecha et al (2011), 

since 1987/88, three years after the conclusion of the works for the configuration of the 



4 

 

breakwaters, to 2005. It was found that the inlet channel deepening was motivated by the new 

inlet configuration, which changed the sediment dynamics and the region that surrounds the North 

jetty, putting at risk the stability of this structure. The residual sedimentary fluxes at the entrance 

channel are mostly directed offshores and significantly lower than observed at the nearshore area, 

evidencing the lagoon capacity to export sediments. Also, the impact of the extension on the inlet 

breakwaters (200 meters in 2012) on the hydrodynamics of Ria de Aveiro was studied by Dias and 

Mariano (2011) through a numerical modelling approach. This work shows that the jetty extension 

slightly changes the local hydrodynamic patterns, and may induce modifications in the overall 

lagoon circulation related with the tidal prism decrease found for the main channels. 

Coastal hazards, such as inundation and coastal erosion, caused by natural or 

anthropogenic factors, have been widely studied all over the world due to their harmful 

consequences. The main natural cause of coastal hazards arises from weather extremes, such as 

storm surges and the cycles in ocean-atmospheric response (see level and currents). The 

dependence of this phenomenon on the wind and on the variation of the atmospheric pressure was 

made by Pore (1963), who studied the relation of these two meteorological factors with the 

extratropical storm surges in Atlantic City. It was also defined by this author that meteorological 

tide (storm surge) is the algebraic difference between the observed and the predicted tides, which 

is considered to be the meteorological effect on sea level. 

Ribbat (2012) also related the effect of wind and atmospheric pressure on the formation of 

storm surges in Torres Strait, Australia. This author found that the response of residual sea level to 

barometric pressure is most significant during periods of low pressure systems, but in relation to 

the wind these phenomena depends on the wind speed, direction and duration. This work also 

concluded that the wind would be least influential in these events. 

Overelevation of the tide due to meteorological effects has also been subject of studies in 

Portugal, since it is an important factor for the occurrence of floods, namely in Ria de Aveiro. Tidal 

exchanges are continuous and predictable as they are periodic. However, subtidal process are less 

predictable as they are generated by meteorological forcing. 

Processes affecting the exchanges between lagoons and the adjacent inner continental 

shelf are controlled by tidal and subtidal oscillations. Dias and Fernandes (2006) studied the 

propagation of tidal and subtidal oscillation throughout the access channel of Patos Lagoon (Brazil) 

and the main channels of Ria de Aveiro Lagoon. For Ria de Aveiro, the tidal energy is stronger than 

the subtidal energy, propagating into the far end of channels. The semidiurnal and diurnal tidal 

signals are similarly attenuated, whereas the quarter-diurnal signal is essentially generated inside 

the lagoon. The subtidal energy is usually very low, however the energy is amplified along the 

lagoon channels when associated with sporadic extreme weather events connected with coastal 

sea-level changes or high river discharge. 

Taborda and Dias (1992) analysed storm surge during two storms in February/March 1978, 

and in December 1981, on the Portuguese coast. They characterised these storms using tide gauge 

data (Viana do Castelo, Leixões, Aveiro, Cascais, Lisboa, Tróia, Sines and Lagos) and predicted 

astronomical tide to calculate the meteorological tide, founding a relationship between the surge 



5 

 

levels with the atmospheric pressure variations and the wind speed and suggest that the surge 

levels were mostly related with the local meteorological conditions. 

The work developed by Picado et al (2013) had as principal aim to evaluate the storm surges 

amplitude impact in the hydrodynamics of Ria de Aveiro lagoon, through numerical modelling 

simulations. These authors concluded that the most significant changes occur at the main channels 

head for all return periods analysed (2, 10 and 100 years), revealing that these regions are the most 

vulnerable to marginal flooding. Also, storm surges induced higher velocities and tidal prism in the 

lagoon, increasing the marginal erosion risk, as well as the salinization of the lagoon marginal lands.  

Coastal wave regime is also important, mainly in lagoons such as the Ria de Aveiro, because 

they are exposed to a highly energetic wave climate. Vaz et al (2013) studied the influence of the 

coastal wave regime at the inlet channel dynamics and concluded that although the dominant 

forcing of Ria de Aveiro inlet hydrodynamics is the tide, the sea level and current velocity 

fluctuations depend also on the wave regime. Consequently, the storm events induce important 

waves set-up that may change the inlet hydrodynamics. 

To study the consequences of the extreme sea levels caused by the combination of high 

tides, storm surges and wind-generated waves, was one of the aims of Lopes (2016) Ph.D. Thesis. 

This author analysed the influence of the simultaneous occurrence of high tide and storm surges 

on the risks of flooding, especially when these phenomena occur in neap or spring tide conditions. 

This work concluded that the most intense storm surge events do not always induce extreme sea 

levels, since they depend also on the tidal level. Also, were not found significant evidences that 

climate changes would modify tidal and storm surge levels in the Ria de Aveiro adjacent coast.

2. Theoretical Concepts 
 

As will be discussed in the following theoretical concepts, gravitational forces of the Moon, 

Sun and Earth are the main causes of short-term sea level fluctuations throughout ocean basins, 

known as tidal movements. These movements are termed astronomical tides, because of the forces 

already mentioned. Other stimuli impacting sea level elevation is the meteorological forcing 

(atmospheric pressure, wind stress and precipitation), that in certain conditions interact in a 

complex way to elevate or reduce water levels significantly above or under predicted tidal heights, 

known as storm surges. Any sequence of measurements of sea level elevation will have a tidal 

component (astronomical tide) and a non-tidal component (meteorological tide). 

A review of theoretical concepts about astronomical and meteorological tides is performed 

in this section. 

 

2.1. Astronomical Tides 
 

Since the Earth rotates around its axis, the effects of the interaction between gravitational 

pulling forces of the Moon and the Sun on Earth, and the centrifugal derived from the system 

rotation is responsible for the generation of the astronomical tide. The tide generated force 

(resulting from the interaction between the gravitational force and the centrifugal force) acts 

directly over the ocean, generating waves characterised by a long period. The movements 

originated by these forces are termed as gravitational or astronomical tides. These progress to the 

coast, where, due to the reduction of depth, it is possible to identify them by the regular rise and 

fall of the surface of the sea. This periodic vertical movement of water on the surface of the Earth 

is frequently known as tide. 

The concept of tide can be understood as the sum of many constituents or partial tides, where 

the respective periods correspond to the period of one of the astronomical movement between 

the Earth, the Sun and the Moon. 

Each harmonic constituent can be described mathematically in terms of amplitude and period 

by: 

?(?) = ?? cos(??? ? ?? ) , (2.1) 

where ? is the value of the variable elevation at time ?, ??  is the amplitude of the oscillation, ?? is 

the angular velocity which is related to the period ?? , and ??  is the phase lag relative to some 

defined time zero, and ? is time. The time zero for ??  is often taken as the phase lag on the 

Equilibrium Tide phase at the Greenwich Meridian (Pugh, 2004). The different harmonic 

constituents obtained by the harmonic analysis allows the prediction and determination of tidal 

characteristics. 

A tide is considered ideal if it presents two high tides and two low tides of uneven height 

during a lunar day. However, such scenario does not happen in all places due to changes caused by 



7 

 

different depths, dimensions and shape of the ocean basins. Therefore, tides have different 

characteristics, namely diurnal tide, semidiurnal tide or mixed tide. 

Tidal wave distortions are usually expressed as simple constituents with frequencies that 

are multiple, sums or frequency differences of fundamental harmonic constituents. 

In addition to the diurnal tidal cycle, there is also a fortnight cycle due to the changing 

position of the moon’s relative to earth. When the moon is New or Full, the spring tides occur, with 

an approximate period of two times a month, and are characterized by an increase in tidal range. 

Neap tides, with small tidal range, occur near the time of the first and last lunar quarters, between 

spring tides. 

 

2.2. Meteorological Tides 
 

The sea-level is characterised by having a tidal (astronomical tide) and a non-tidal component 

(meteorological tide). The non-tidal component is the part of the sea level that remains once the 

astronomical tidal component has been removed and is called the residual or meteorological 

residual (Pugh, 1996). 

The general representation of the observed level, ?(?) that varies with time may be written by 

the following equation: 

?(?) = ?0(?) + ?(?) + ?(?) , (2.2) 

 

where ?0(?) is the mean sea level, which changes very slowly with time, ?(?) is the astronomical 

part of the variation and ?(?) is the meteorological surge component.  

From Equation (2.2), the meteorological tide is the difference between the observed and 

the predicted sea levels at a given time ?: 

 

?(?) = ?(?) ? ?0(?) ? ?(?) . (2.3) 

  

The term meteorological tide, or storm surge, is used for the excess sea levels generated 

by a severe storm, produced by meteorological causes (atmospheric pressure gradient and extreme 

near-surface wind stress) (Pugh, 2004). These two meteorological effects, the atmospheric pressure 

gradient and the wind tension parallel to the surface of the sea water, are the main factors 

responsible for the occurrence of over-elevation of the water. However, there are others that when 

occurring simultaneously with those mentioned above, may increase storm surges, such as the 

occurrence of spring tides, an increase of precipitation that drives to an increasing of river flow, and 

the formation of waves due to wind. 

The water movement can be described by hydrodynamic equations, which are defined 

considering a Cartesian coordinate system, with ? and ? axis in the horizontal plane and the ? axis 



8 

 

directed vertically upwards, and zero level for vertical displacements is taken as the long-term mean 

sea-level. The momentum equations are:

where ? is the free surface elevation,  ? and ? are the horizontal velocity components, ? is the

pressure, ??  and ??  are the frictional terms arising from shear stress across horizontal planes and  

? ?is the tide-generating potential.

The velocity components ? and ?, and the transport components ? and ? refer to the tidal 

constituents and the meteorological effects. In coastal waters of limited extent, the direct effects 

of the tide-generating potential, represented by ?,? can be neglected. The components ???  and ???  

are the tangential shearing stress of the wind on the sea surface. ??? and ???  represent the 

components of stress at the bottom (Bowden, 1984). 

As already mentioned, the effect of atmospheric pressure and wind are the main factors 

for the occurrence of a storm surge. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse separately how sea water 

behaves with the variations of these two factors: atmospheric pressure and wind stress.  

 

2.2.1. Atmospheric Pressure Effect - Inverted Barometer Effect 
 

Changes in atmospheric pressure may increase or reduce the sea level height, depending 

on the type of prevailing system. As a result of the inverted barometric effect, low pressure systems 

elevate sea levels, while high pressure systems tend to depress them (Ribbat, 2012). The physical 

behaviour of this barometric effect can be explained considering equation (2.9), neglecting the 

effect related to the term ??? ? ??? , assuming that V = 0 (considering the sides of the channel 

parallel to the ? axis), and consider the variation of ? throughout the channel is smaller compared 

to its length. The equation obtained is: 

 

??

??
= ?

1

??

???

??
 . (2.12) 

 

If the variations ?? (sea level variations) and ??? (local variations of atmospheric pressure) 

are related to a finite and horizontal displacement ??, then equation 2.12 becomes: 

 

?? = ?
1

??
???  , (2.13) 

 

in which the decrease in atmospheric pressure is followed by an increase in sea level height, and 

vice versa (Bowden, 1984). 

An increase in atmospheric pressure of one millibar will produce a theoretical decrease in 

sea water of one centimetre (Pugh, 2004). 



10 

 

2.2.2. Wind Stress Effect 
 

When a storm approaches the coast, the alongshore component of wind stress drives an 

Ekman setup (the net transport of water by the wind occurs at a 90° angle to the right of the wind 

vector in the Northern hemisphere) at the coast located to the right-side of the wind. As an 

important consequence, the coastal region located to the right-side of the storm track usually 

suffers larger storm surge and damages than the coastal region located to the left side (Bertin, 

2016). 

Considering the accumulation of sea water on the Portuguese coast, the entrance of 

seawater into Ria de Aveiro can increase significantly in response to Ekman transport, induced by 

southward winds. Since the tidal wave in the lagoon is forced by the oceanic tide, an increase in 

water level inside the lagoon is observed. 

The surface currents generated by the wind stress behave differently depending on the 

depth of the site being studied. For a wind blowing along a narrow channel of constant depth, the 

steady-state effect of wind drag on the slope of the sea surface is to pile up water up at the 

downwind end and to produce higher sea levels there. This can result from a balance between the 

wind stress and the pressure gradient that opposes it (Pugh, 2004). 

Considering a closed channel at one of its ends, and that the bottom stress is near zero and 

considering a small ? compared to the height of the water column ?, equation (2.9) can be reduced 

to: 

 

??

??
=

???

???
 , (2.14) 

 

Where 
??   

??
 is the slope formed in the sea water due to wind, and ???  the effective tangencial stress 

of the wind on the sea surface (Bowden, 1984). The equation of ???  is: 

 

??? = ?? ?? ?
2  , (2.15) 

 

where ? is the wind speed measured at a given height, usually taken 10 m above the sea surface, 

??  is the density of the air and ??  is a dimensionless drag coefficient (Bowden, 1984).  

 By integrating equation (2.14) through the horizontal length L: 

 

? = ?
???

???
?? =  

???

???
 ?  

?

0
 ,  (2.16) 

 



11 

 

 From the equation (2.16), it can be verified that when the wind blows along a channel the 

effect on the slope of the water, due to its accumulation, will be higher than if the wind blows 

perpendicular to the channel. 

Also, by using equations (2.14) and (2.15), the following is obtained: 

 

????? =
????????  ?? ?????

?????????? ????????
=

???? ?
2

???
 . (2.17) 

 

Formula (2.17) mathematically represents the important fact that the wind effect on sea 

levels increases inversely with the water depth ? (Pugh, 2004). 

A comparison between the elevation generated by the wind stress and by the direct 

atmospheric pressure, estimated by equation (2.13), indicates that for depressions in mid-latitude 

the wind stress effect is usually an order of magnitude higher than the pressure effect (Bowden, 

1984).

3. Study Area: Ria de Aveiro 
 

Ria de Aveiro (Figure 1) is a shallow water coastal lagoon system, located on the northwest 

coast of Portugal (40°38'N, 8°44'W), separated from the sea by an extensive sand bar and 

integrated in the Vouga river basin. It is 45 km long and 10 km wide, covering an area of 89.2 km2 

at a high spring tide, which is reduced to 64.9 km2 in neap tide conditions (Dias, 2001; Lopes et al, 

2010). It has a very irregular and complex geometry, characterised by narrow channels, large areas 

of mud flats and salt marshes. The lagoon has also four main channels: Mira Channel, Ílhavo 

Channel, Espinheiro Channel and S. Jacinto Channel.  

 

Figure  1 – Map of the Ria de Aveiro, with the location of the main channels and freshwater sources. 

 

 The average depth of the lagoon is about one meter, except in the navigation channels 

where dredging operations are frequently carried out. The channel connecting the lagoon with the 



13 

 

Atlantic Ocean has a depth higher than twenty meters and the other navigation channels are about 

seven meters deep. The inlet channel has approximately 1.3 km long and 350 m wide and is fixed 

by the North and South breakwater (Dias at al, 2000, Picado et al, 2011). 

The lagoon receives freshwater from the following rivers: Vouga river (draining in the 

Espinheiro Channel, and representing the main source of freshwater to the lagoon), Antuã river 

(draining in the Laranjo basin, the second most important river), Boco river (draining in the Ílhavo 

Channel), Cáster, Gonde and Fontela rivers (flowing in the S. Jacinto Channel) and various effluents 

flowing into the upstream end of the Mira Channel (Dias, 2001). 

The lagoon hydrodynamics is tidally dominated by the influence of the oceanic tide, which is 

predominantly semidiurnal with a small diurnal pattern (Dias, 2001). The astronomical tidal range 

varies between a maximum of 3.2 m in spring tide and a minimum of 0.6 m in neap tide, with an 

average value of 2 m, whereby the lagoon should be classified as mesotidal (Dias et al, 2000). 

Although infrequent, the meteorological tide can reach a maximum height of ~1 m (Picado et al, 

2013). Concerning tidal asymmetry, until 1987/88 most of the lagoon was flood-dominant (Araújo 

et al, 2008).  Since then, the lagoon is ebb dominant at the mouth and flood dominant at the upper 

part. As the lower lagoon is ebb dominant, there is a tendency to export sediments to the ocean 

(Dias, 2001; Oliveira et al, 2006; Picado et al, 2013). The lagoon can be considered as vertically 

homogeneous, except occasionally when fresh water inflows are high, and the upper parts of the 

lagoon can present vertical stratification (Dias et al, 2000). 

In addition to the oceanic tide and rivers flows, the wind stress also determines the dynamics 

of Ria de Aveiro. The wind action, which can last from a few hours to a few days, may induce slight 

changes on local hydrodynamics. This can happen, especially in shallow areas and wide channels, 

inducing currents, surface waves and mixing processes in the water column (Dias, 2001). 

Anthropogenic action was the dominant factor in the morphological evolution of the lagoon 

in the recent past and also affected directly the natural geomorphological evolution of the lagoon 

(Picado et al, 2011). The most noteworthy human intervention was the creation of an artificial inlet 

in 1808, in response to persistent accretion of the natural inlet, and later the construction of two 

breakwaters (Lopes et al, 2013; Lopes, 2016). The works to extend of the northern breakwater that 

fixes the lagoon entrance, one in 1987 and the other in 2012; the regular dredging activities in the 

inlet channel and in the lagoon main channels, between 1996 and 1999; and the natural destruction 

of great part of the salt pans, due to its lack of preservation, changed the bathymetry and the 

geometry of the lagoon channels (Lopes, 2016). As result, the lagoon became deeper and as 

consequence the tidal wave amplitude increased, and its propagation became faster (Lopes and 

Dias, 2015). These morphological changes induce modifications in the lagoon hydrodynamics.

4. Methodology and Data 
 

The analysis of water level time series recorded by tide gauges is fundamental in 

understanding the Ria de Aveiro tidal dynamics. However, tidal signals are a complex combination 

of the oscillations generated by the gravitational forces of the Moon and the Sun acting on the sea 

water, and irregular oscillations due to atmospheric variability. The separation from non-tidal to 

tidal energy is a crucial component in any analysis of water level time series, especially in coastal 

waters.  

This chapter will describe where and when the sea level and the meteorological data used 

was obtained, as well as the methodologies that were used to analyse them. 

 

4.1. Data Presentation 
 

4.1.1. Sea Level Data 
 

This study was carried out using records by tide gauges located in the main channels of Ria 

de Aveiro, which geographical location is represented in Figures 2 and 3 and in Table 1, in three 

different time intervals: 1987/88, 2002/03 and 2012 to 2017. This allowed to determine the 

possible variations in the tidal characteristics between these periods. 

In 1987/88 and in 2002/03, the sea surface elevation (SSE) used were obtained in the 

context of general surveys carried out by the Instituto Hidrográfico Português and by the University 

of Aveiro, respectively. In these two-time intervals, the data collection was done only during some 

months. Between 2012 and 2017, the data were collected monthly and continuously through tide 

gauges installed along the Ria de Aveiro as part of the monitoring of the North breakwater 

extension, carried out by Administração do Porto de Aveiro (APA), except for several malfunctions 

of the tide gauges at each station, which caused gaps in sea level measurements (Table 7).  

Sea level observations were recorded with a hourly frequency for 1987/88 and 2012, 6 

minutes between 2002 and 2003, and 20 minutes for the years of 2013 to 2017, except for Barra 

station that where sampled every 5 minutes.

4.1.2. Meteorological Data 
 

Wind speed, wind direction and atmospheric pressure data were obtained from the 

weather station located at the University of Aveiro. These data were recorded every 10 minutes for 

consecutive days, from 2012 to 2017, with the exception of January 2013. For this month, the 

meteorological data was acquired in a meteorological station with the coordinates 40.9517°N; 

9.375°W, at 6-hourly time interval. 

 

4.2. Data Processing and Analysis 
 

The SSE data sets were subjected to several data management procedures, as the finding 

and removal of data gaps, interpolation them to have the same sampling period and to fill some 

gaps in short time intervals. In the case of long intervals with lack of values, it was assumed that the 

missing values were zero. Due to several equipment failures, measurements between 2012 and 

2017 were not always continuous. These failures include problems in the operation of the tide 

gauges, but they are also related to changes in the infrastructure on the places where they were 

placed. The stations most affected were Rio Novo and Vista Alegre. The dates with the 

measurement failures are present in Table 7.  

 

4.2.1.  Tidal Harmonic Analysis 
 

A Fourier analysis was first made to identify the frequencies and to measure the relative 

energy in the components responsible for the sea level variation at each tide gauge. This analysis 

allowed to determine which frequencies bands are the dominant and thus to identify the main 

constituents that influence the circulation of water in Ria de Aveiro. After that, a harmonic analysis 

was applied using the T-Tide application of Matlab (Pawlowicz et al, 2002), for the data of each 

station. Also, the amplitude and the phase of the tidal constituents were determined annually 

(corresponding to the total months available for each year, at the different stations). 

Initially, the analysis included seven tidal constituents: ?1, ?1, ?2 , ?2, ?4 , ?6 , and ???, 

where the symbols represent (Bell et al, 2006; Pugh, 2004): 

?1- Principal lunar diurnal tide, with a period of 25.82 hrs. This constituent represents the 

cycle of maximum declination to minimum declination of the Moon;  

?1–Principal lunisolar diurnal tide, with a period of 23.93 hrs, which arises from Sun and 

Moon’s paths over the Equator being at various inclines or declines (angles) to the Equator line; 

?2  – Lunar semi-diurnal tide, which arises from the direct gravitational attraction of Moon 

on Earth’s waters, with a period of 12.42 hrs; 

?2 – Solar semi-diurnal tide, which arises from the direct gravitational attraction of Sun on 

Earth’s waters, with a period of 12.00 hrs;

?4   - Shallow water constituent, generated by the non-linear effects of advection with a 

period of 6.21 hrs. 

?6  - Shallow water constituent, caused by the interaction of the tidal wave with the bottom 

due to the reduced depth, with a period of 4.14 hrs. 

??? – long period tide, with a value of 14.76 days. This period corresponds to the 

difference between the spring tides and the consecutive neap tides; 

Concerning the constituents ?1 and ?1, although they have high frequencies (referred in 

5.1.1) they do not present any relevant tendency towards the aims of this work, as mentioned in 

Fradinho (2014), so they are not showed in this document. Therefore, in the analysis presented in 

this work the other five tidal constituents mentioned (?2 , ?2, ?4 , ?6 and ???) will be included.  

Annual amplitude and phase variation graphics (section 5.1.2) of each harmonic constant 

were made in the different years and for the following stations: Barra, Ponte Varela, Chegado (Cais 

do Bico), Rio Novo, Vagueira and Vista Alegre. This allowed to observe the annual evolution and to 

verify if there had been any relevant changes during the time interval in which the data collection 

took place.  

 

 

4.2.1.1. Form Number Determination 
 

The Form number will be determined in this work for all stations (section 5.2), between 

1987/88 and 2017, using equation: 

 

? =
?1+?1

?2+?2
  (4.1) 

 

where ?1 (Principal lunisolar diurnal), ?1 (Principal lunar diurnal), ?2 (Lunar semi-diurnal) and 

?2 (Solar semi-diurnal tide) correspond to the amplitude of the tidal constituents (Pugh, 2004). 

When the variation of ? is:  

• 0&amp;lt;?&amp;lt;0.25 the tides are considered semidiurnal; 

•  0.25 &amp;lt;?&amp;lt;1.5, mixed - mainly semidiurnal; 

•  1.5 &amp;lt;?&amp;lt;3.0 mixed - mainly diurnal; 

• ? &gt; 3.0 diurnal.

4.2.1.2. Tidal Asymmetry 
 

In section 5.3., tidal asymmetry was determined for all stations. 

One way of determining the type of asymmetry from the phase of the constituents ?2  and 

?4 , is to determine the relative phases of these constituents: 

 

??4 = 2??2 ? ??4   . (4.2) 

where the tidal flow has a flood dominance at 0 ° &amp;lt;?&amp;lt;180 ° and ebb dominance when 180 ° &amp;lt;? 

&lt;360 ° (Friedrichs and Aubrey, 1988).  

The term tidal asymmetry usually refers to the tidal wave distortion when it spreads to shallow 

waters, which may result in periods of unequal flood and ebb (Wang et al, 1999).  

The distortion of the tide as it propagates from the open ocean into the confinement of 

estuaries can be represented by the non-linear growth of compound constituents and harmonica 

of the principal astronomical components (Friedrichs and Aubrey, 1988). 

Due to the overlap of these constituents, the elevation of the free surface of the water and the 

current velocity are distorted from its initial sinusoidal form, giving rise to the asymmetry of the 

tide. For the specific case where the ebb period is higher than that of the flood, the situation is 

called flood-dominant, because the highest velocity is reached in the flood. In the opposite case, it 

is called ebb-dominant (Dias, 2016b). 

Tidal asymmetry often plays a key role in determining sediment transport and deposition/ 

erosion patterns in several tidal dominated estuaries and inlets. The transport of sediments will 

depend on the maximum velocity. That is, if the maximum velocity is that of the ebb, the sediment 

exportation is higher, if it is of the flood, there will be a mean sediment transport to the interior of 

the estuary (Dias, 2016b). 

It is important to know the tidal asymmetry in estuaries mainly due to the fact that the 

navigability of the estuarine channels and the geomorphological evolution will be affected by the 

sediment transport and accumulation. That is, an estuary with flood dominance may be unable to 

effectively exhale the sediments, hindering navigability, while an estuary with ebb dominance may 

maintain a stable configuration. 

The phases of these two constituents (?2  and  ?4) are used because the dominant 

astronomical constituent is ?2 ,  the semi-diurnal lunar tide. Because of ?2   dominance, the most 

significant overtide formed in well-mixed estuaries, like Ria de Aveiro, is ?4 , the first harmonic of 

?2  (Friedrichs and Aubrey, 1988).

4.2.2.  Non-Tidal component (Meteorological Residuals) 
 

Annual series of the residual tide were determined for each year of the period between 

2012 and 2017 by subtracting the astronomical predicted tides from the measured tidal signal, as 

described in equation 2.3.  

Also, standard deviations of the meteorological residual annual series were determined to 

identify storm surge events. According to the criterion proposed by Pugh (1996), the meteorological 

tide events can be identified considering that the residual levels are higher than three times the 

standard deviation (3?) of the residual series (Pugh,1996, Picado et al, 2013). A distinction will be 

made between positive anomalies, whose residual values are higher than 3?, and the negative 

ones, whose values are lower than ?3?. 

It was not taken into consideration in this analysis those time intervals where several values 

were missing (which were due to the lack of values and problems with the malfunction of the tide 

gauge). These time intervals are presented in Table 7 of the Annex.  

To identify the distribution of positive and negative anomalies, in each station studied, and 

understand the relationship between meteorological variables and the generation of tidal 

elevations, graphs of the atmospheric pressure, wind intensity and direction, precipitation and 

water level and residual graphs, were performed, section 5.4. 

 A selection of the obtained events was made to distinguish those that were generated by 

the variations of atmospheric pressure and the wind intensity (storm surge), and those that were 

formed due to other effects, namely the occurrence of spring tides. Of the events considered storm 

surges, were still considered those that formed remotely and that affected all the lagoon, and those 

that were formed locally.

5. Results and Discussion 
 

Pawlowicz et al (2002) show that the separation of tidal and non-tidal energy is a crucial 

component in any analysis of oceanic time series, especially in coastal waters. Based on this 

principle, in this Chapter the results obtained from the analysis of the data collected at six tide 

gauges located in Ria de Aveiro, will be presented and discussed with the aim of studying the 

astronomical tidal changes induced by geomorphological modifications over time and determining 

the frequency and main meteorological drivers of the storm surge phenomena, either remotely 

generated or locally generated. 

 

5.1. Tidal Analysis  
 

5.1.1 Fourier Spectrum 
 

A Fourier analysis was used to identify the frequencies and to measure the relative energy 

of components responsible for the sea level variation at each tide gauge. This analysis allowed to 

determine which are the dominant frequencies band and thus to identify the main constituents 

characterizing the tidal properties in the Ria de Aveiro. Fourier spectra for each gauge is presented 

in Figure 4. 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Figure  4 – Fourier spectra for each gauge sites used in sea-level analysis, from 2012 to 2017. These spectra 

have frequency as their abscissa (x-axis) and power spectral density (PSD), which is a measure of energy, 

as their ordinate (y-axis). 

 

 



22 

 

Through the analysis of the six spectra (Figure 4), were not found high differences between 

the tidal dominant frequencies for each station. In all of them the semi-diurnal frequency processes 

dominated the tidal forcing, followed by the diurnal tidal frequencies. In the region where the 

frequencies are between 10-1 h-1 to 1 h-1, corresponding to the frequencies of the shallow water 

constituents, it is possible to verify that the quarter-diurnal tidal frequencies have the highest 

energy, followed by sixth-diurnal tidal frequencies. The only observable differences between the 

spectra for all stations are related to the frequencies of the long-period constituent, which 

frequency band is smaller in Rio Novo. 

Normally the residual process is less energetic (left-hand side of plots), except in situations 

of extreme weather events, when the meteorological tidal frequencies are amplified (Dias and 

Fernandes, 2006). High energy values at the low frequencies are present in all of spectra because 

they were obtained in a large time interval during which have occurred storm surge events, with 

Rio Novo presenting the highest energy values in this frequency range. This may be related with 

high precipitation and therefore high discharges from Vouga River. 

Dias and Fernandes (2006) studied the energy spectrum for stations located between the 

mouth of the lagoon and throughout the main channels of Ria de Aveiro in 1987 and 1988. They 

also conclude that the main frequencies were semi-diurnal, followed by diurnal and quarter-diurnal 

tidal frequencies at the mouth of the lagoon. The energy spectrum for stations located throughout 

the main channels present similar patterns, although the energy associated with diurnal and semi-

diurnal frequencies is lower. These authors showed that these tidal oscillations are progressively 

attenuated as they propagate landwards. The energy on quarter-diurnal frequencies for these 

stations are higher than at the mouth, indicating that these frequencies are amplified inside the 

lagoon. The reason for this is that as primary tides propagate into shallow water regions, the shape 

of the wave changes and the frictional effects become more pronounced.

5.1.2. Tidal Harmonic Analysis - Amplitude and Phase Analysis  
 

To understand the temporal evolution of each tidal constituent  ?2, ?2 , ?4, ?6 and ???, 

at each tide gauge were analysed between 1987/88 and 2017. 

 

5.1.2.1. Tidal constituent ?? 

 

Figures 5 to 14 present the temporal evolution of the amplitude and phase of the tidal 

constituents studied between 1987 and 2017. 

 

a) Amplitude 

 

Figure  5 – Amplitude of tidal constituent ?? in all tide gauges, from 1987/88 to 2017.  

 

The analysis of the amplitude temporal evolution for the stations (Figure 5) revealed an 

increase of the tidal constituent ?2  between 1987/88 and 2002/03 in all stations. The amplitude 

difference between 2002/03 and 2012 is not significant, although there is a slight increase in all 

stations located throughout the main channels, except in Barra where there is a small decrease. 

From 2012 to 2017, the amplitude does not change significantly, apart from Barra, where a 

decrease between 2012 and 2015 was observed. 

It should be noted that, although there is no data for the year 2002/03 at Ponte Varela, the 

general trend of the other stations will be considered in the discussion of the results. 



24 

 

The amplitude increases from 1987/88 to 2002/03 are of the order of 32.80 cm in Vagueira, 

29.92 cm in Cais do Bico/Chegado, 16.32 cm in Rio Novo, 12.06 cm in Vista Alegre and 3.06 cm in 

Barra. 

 

 

b) Phase 

 

Figure  6 – Phase of tidal constituent ?? in all tide gauges, from 1987/88 to 2017. 

 

Regarding the phase of ?2  constituent (Figure 6), a decrease was found, in all stations over 

time, from 1987/88 to 2002/03. For the time interval from 2002/03 to 2017, the phase does not 

change significantly.  

The decrease of the phase, between 1987/88 and 2002/03, was in the order of 23.88° (49.4 

min) in Vagueira, 18.20° (37.67 min) in Cais de Bico/Chegado, 21.49° (44.48 min) in Rio Novo, 11.28° 

(23.35 min) in Vista Alegre and 0.49° (12.20 min) in Barra. 

Similar results were found by Araújo et al (2008), from 1978/88 to 2002/03, with an 

increase in amplitude and a decrease in phase for the harmonic constituent  ?2 . 

 

 

 



25 

 

5.1.2.2. Tidal constituent ?? 
 

a) Amplitude 
 

 

Figure  7 – Amplitude of tidal constituent ?? in all tide gauges, from 1987/88 to 2017. 

 

 

 

As for the tidal constituent ?2 , is also found to have had a significant increase in amplitude 

of the ?2 constituent in most of the tide gauges from 1987/88 to 2002/03 (Figure 7), apart from 

Cais do Bico/ Chegado, where was a decrease between 1987 to 2003. In the period from 2012 to 

2017, the values practically did not change in Ponte Varela, Cais do Bico/Chegado, Vagueira and 

Vista Alegre. 

From 1987/88 to 2002/03, the amplitude increased 9.53 cm in Rio Novo, 8.08 cm in 

Vagueira, 2.90 cm in Cais do Bico/ Chegado and Vista Alegre and 1.47 cm in Barra. 

 

 



26 

 

b) Phase 

 

Figure  8 - Phase of tidal constituent ?? in all tide gauges, from 1987/88 to 2017. 

 

 

 

Concerning the phase (Figure 8), from 1987/88 to 2002/03 the semidiurnal solar 

constituent decreased in Barra, Rio Novo, Vista Alegre and in Ponte Varela. Featuring a slight 

increase in Cais do Bico/Chegado and Vagueira. For the time interval between 2002/03 and 2017, 

the phase does not change significantly. 

The variations of the phase for this constituent are lower than for the constituent ?2 , being 

approximately 8° (6.4 min) for Rio Novo, Vista Alegre and Barra. For Cais do Bico / Chegado and 

Vagueira the increase was 3° (2.4 min). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



27 

 

The harmonic analysis of the principal tidal constituents (lunar principal, ?2 , and solar 

principal, ?2) is the most relevant for studies of tidal changes due to variations in the 

geomorphology of Ria de Aveiro, since the energy associated with the frequencies of these two 

constituents is the highest, as reported in the analysis of the Fourier spectra, and because their 

amplitude values are the highest in relation to the other constituents studied. 

A general increase in the amplitude and a decrease in the phase for these constituents is a 

consequence of natural and anthropogenic modifications in the Ria de Aveiro. A dredging operation 

took place along the main channels of Ria de Aveiro in 1998. The increase in water depth appears 

to be the most important factor contributing to results found, since the highest variations occurred 

between 1987/88 and 2002/03.  

The slight differences, both in the amplitude and the phase, of these constituents between 

2002/03 and the following years, show that the north jetty extension by 200 m of the north jetty in 

2012, did not cause great changes in the local dynamics of the tide, confirming the numerical 

modelling predictions by Dias and Mariano (2011).

a) Amplitude

Figure  10 - Amplitude of tidal constituent ?? in all tide gauges, from 1987/88 to 2017. 



29 

 

The shallow water tidal constituents, ?4  and ?6 , exhibit the same behaviour for Ponte 

Varela, Cais do Bico/Chegado, Rio Novo and Vista Alegre. There was an increase in tidal amplitude 

from 1987/88 to 2002/03 in these tide gauges and a decrease in Barra and Vagueira (Figures 9 and 

10). 

From 1987/88 to 2002/03, the highest amplitude difference was recorded at Cais do 

Bico/Chegado for both ?4  (2.89 cm) and  ?6  (3.47 cm). Vista Alegre presented the lowest value for 

?4  (1.62 cm) and Rio Novo for ?6 , 0.91 cm. In Vagueira and Barra, there was a decrease from 

1987/88 to 2002/03, which for ?4  was in the order of 8.95 cm and 0.30 cm, and for  ?6  of 0.46 cm 

and 0.27 cm, respectively.  

In general, the amplitude of ?4  and ?6  increases with the increase of ?2 . This trend is 

justified by the transfer of part of the energy from ?2  to the constituents ?4  and ?6 .  Despite this 

trend, there was a decrease in the amplitude of these two constituents in Barra and Vagueira. This 

can be justified by a reduction of the bottom friction due to the increase of the channel depth from 

Barra to Vagueira and specifically in the area where the tide gauges are located, a result of the 

dredging throughout the lagoon in 1998.  

As for the constituents previously studied, between 2012 and 2017 the amplitude did not 

change significantly, except for Rio Novo, which values varied but without any trend. This station is 

influenced by the Vouga river, which represents the main source of freshwater to the lagoon. The 

increase of the flow in certain months of the year can change the values of these two constituents, 

since they are directly dependent on the bottom friction, which is related to the increase of depth.

b) Phase 

 

Figure  11 - Phase of tidal constituent ?? in all tide gauges, from 1987/88 to 2017. 

 

 

Regarding the phase, for the constituents ?4 , from 1987/88 to 2002/03 the phase 

decreased, except for Rio Novo, with the lowest decrease occurring in Cais do Bico/Chegado, 

126.77° (131.2 min) (Figure 11). For the other stations, the decrease was as follows: 71.19° (73.70 

min) for Vagueira, 43.62° (45.15 min) for Vista Alegre and 4.59° (4.75 min) for Barra. As for the 

constituents previously studied, between 2012 and 2017 the amplitude did not change significantly, 

except for Rio Novo, which values varied without any trend. The same pattern was found, for this 

station, for the constituent ?6  (Figure 12). 

 



31 

 

 

Figure  12 - Phase of tidal constituent ?? in all tide gauges, from 1987/88 to 2017. 

 

 

For the constituent ?6 , from 1987/88 to 2002/03, the phase increased in the Cais do 

Bico/Chegado (262.66° which corresponds to 181.24 min), Vagueira (51.80° which corresponds 

to35.74 min) and Rio Novo (259.64° which corresponds to 177.78 min), and decreased in the other 

stations. Between 2012 and 2017 the phase did not change significantly, except for Rio Novo in 

2015, and for Vista Alegre in 2014. This different behaviour may have occurred because during 

these years measurement anomalies occurred, which may have influenced the results obtained, as 

previously mentioned in methodology section.

5.1.2.5. Tidal constituent ??? – Amplitude and Phase 

 

 

Figure  13 - Amplitude of tidal constituent ??? in all tide gauges, from 1987/88 to 2017. 

 

The tidal constituent ??f, represents the variation of the water level in a spring / neap tide 

cycle, results from the interaction between ?2  and ?2. 

According to Figure 13, a decrease in amplitude from 1987/88 to 2002/03 can be observed 

in most stations. The amplitude decreased 10.39 cm in Rio Novo, 7.30 cm in Vagueira, 1.33 cm in 

Vista Alegre, 0.57 cm in Cais do Bico/ Chegado and 1.37 cm in Barra. Between 2012 and 2017, there 

is a trend towards the increase of amplitude of this constituent in most stations, although in some 

intermediate years an opposite trend is found in Barra and Cais do Bico/Chegado. This means that, 

in this last time interval, the amplitude difference between spring and neap tides has been 

increasing. 

 

 



33 

 

 

Figure  14 - Phase of tidal constituent ??? in all tide gauges, from 1987/88 to 2017. 

 

According to Figure 14, there is a phase increase of ??? constituent in the stations Cais do 

Bico/Chegado (4.66° which corresponds to 4.58 hours), Vagueira (18.45° which corresponds to 

18.15 hours) e Vista Alegre (5.97° which corresponds to 7.00 hours), and a decrease in Rio Novo 

(8.69° which corresponds to 8.55 hours) and Barra (20.86° which corresponds to 20.53 hours), from 

1987/88 to 2002/03. In the following years, there is a general trend towards the increase of the 

phase, although in some intermediate years an opposite trend is found.

5.2. Form Factor 
 

In Table 2 is presented the form factor determined for the different stations studied 

between 1987/88 and 2017. The Form number was determined by expression 4.1. 

 

Table 2 – Form Factor values between 1987/88 to 2017.

V. Alegre 0.126 0.123 0.126 0.121 0.141 0.111 0.124 0.108 

 

The values of F obtained along these years did not vary significantly. The results show that 

the tide is predominantly semidiurnal in Ria de Aveiro. There are two high tides and two low tides 

in a period of 12h and 25 minutes, which corresponds to a half of a lunar day.  

 

5.3. Tidal Asymmetry 
 

The relative phase ??4  , was determined for each of the stations from 1987/88 to 2017, 

applying the mathematical expression 4.2.

The results (Table 3) show that all stations located in the channels of the lagoon are flood-

dominating in 1987/88, as already mentioned by Araújo et al (2008).  

From this date onward, it can observe that while the Ponte Varela, Vagueira and Vista 

Alegre stations still remain flood-dominant, which means that the maximum velocity during the 



35 

 

flood is higher than during the ebb and thus the sediment transport is done upstream,  the Rio Novo 

and Chegado stations show ebb dominance, which translates in higher velocity during the ebb 

rather than the flood, and as such the sediment transport is preferentially done downstream which 

increases the erosion in those places. 

The mouth of the lagoon is ebb-dominant between 1987/88 and 2017.  

 

  



36 

 

5.4. Meteorological Tides 
 

The total number of events where the residual value is higher than three times the standard 

deviation,  3?, or less than ?3?, is represented in Table 4, as well as their duration.

standard deviations of the residuals, from 2012 to 2017.

For the identification of meteorological tide events, it was not only considered the 

situations in which the residual values were higher than three times the standard deviation (3?), 

or lower than ?3?, but additionally their duration (Table 4). Also, to know and understand the 

relationship between meteorological variables and the generation of residual elevations, graphs of 

the atmospheric pressure, wind intensity and direction, precipitation and water level and residual 

were performed. 

A selection of the obtained events was made to distinguish those that were generated by 

the variations of atmospheric pressure and the wind intensity, and those that were formed due to 

other effects, namely the occurrence of spring tides. From the different events, a separation 

between the remotely generated and the locally generated events was also performed. 

From the different events occurring between 2012 and 2017, where residual values were 

higher than three times the standard deviation of the annual residuals (positive anomalies), only 

two influenced the entire lagoon (January and December 2013), having been generated by adverse 

meteorological conditions verified at national level. The remainder were manifested only locally in 

October 2012, March 2013, September 2015 and May 2016. 

The events with negative anomalies occurred in a smaller number, emphasizing only that 

they occurred in February and March of 2015. 

 

 

 



37 

 

5.4.1. Analysis of Positive Anomalies 
 

During the year 2013, positive anomalies were recorded in all the stations under study in 

January and December. In October 2012, March 2013, September 2015 and May 2016 were only 

verified local events. 

 

January 2013 
 

Between January 18th and 19th, 2013, Portugal mainland was affected by extreme weather 

conditions. This severe weather, caused by the storm called Gong Storm, affected mainly the centre 

and south of Portugal mainland. The rapid drop in pressure caused wind speed to rise, reaching the 

maximum of “Force 12” on Beaufort scale (0 to 12) in some locations (wind speed between                 

25 ms-1 and 33 ms-1), accompanied by heavy rain (Liberato, 2014). 

Due to the weather conditions generated by this storm, the water level and the residual 

values (higher than three times the standard deviation for this month) were recorded on 19 and 20 

January (Figures 15 and 16).

Figure  16 –Observed water level (m) and residual levels (m) in January 2013, in the stations: 

a) Chegado; b) Rio Novo; c) Vagueira and d) Vista Alegre. 

 

In Rio Novo, the highest SSE and residual values recorded were 4.04 m and 1.26 m, 

respectively. The duration of this event in this area was approximately 31 hours between 19 and 20 

January. In other stations, the storm occurred mainly between January 18 and 19, with the highest 

SSE values of 3.90 m and the residual of 1.00 m in Vagueira, and in this area, the effect of the storm 

was felt for 13 hours. In Vista Alegre, the value that was recorded for the water level was 3.92 m 

and for the residual of 0.98 m, the duration of the event was 10 hours. In the case of Ponte Varela, 

Chegado and Barra, the duration of the storm was 18 hours, with SSE values being: 3.55 m, 3.82 m 

and 3.80 m respectively, and for the residuals of 0.72 m, 0.87 m and   0.66 m. 

One of the effects of the Gong Storm, which was mainly observed on the day 19th, was the 

increase in water level in Ria de Aveiro, as well as in the residual values (Figures 15 and 16).  

 

 



39 

 

The large drop in atmospheric pressure, from 1005 hPa to a minimum pressure of 980 hPa 

24 hours later (Figure 17), the increase of the wind intensity on that same date (Figure 18), that had 

a direction change from SW on day 18th to NW on the 19th [Figure 19 a) and b)] and the large 

precipitation (Figure 20), characterize this storm.

From the mathematical expression 2.13, it is possible to determine the effect of the 

atmospheric pressure in the sea surface elevation. For this variation of pressure corresponds an 

increase of the SSE of about 35.00 cm. Considering the effect of wind, by equation 2.16, the SSE 

may increase by about 11.60 cm considering its effect along the lagoon channels. Another effect 

caused by the wind tension is the accumulation of water at the banks of the channels, especially in 

areas where the wind has perpendicular direction to the banks of the channels. Adding to these 

factors the high value of the precipitation, justifies the values obtained for the SSE and for the 

residuals. On average, the values found for SSE in all stations were 1.00 m higher than the annual 

average for each station.

December 2013 
 

In December, between the 24th and 26th, all stations (except Rio Novo, the tide gauge was 

withdrawn on 24 October 2013), recorded meteorological tides (Figure 21). 

 

                        

                       

Figure  21 - Observed water level (m) and residual levels (m) in December 2013, in the stations: 

a) Barra; b) Ponte Varela; c) Chegado; d) Vagueira and e) Vista Alegre. 

 



42 

 

In Chegado, the highest SSE and residual values were recorded, being 3.79 m and 0.98 m, 

respectively. The duration of this event in this area, in Ponte Varela and Barra was approximately 

22 hours, between 24 and 25 December. In Barra the SSE value was 3.72 m and the residual value 

was 0.56 m. In Ponte Varela, the value of the SSE reached 3.47 m and the residual 1.02 m. In 

Vagueira, SSE values of 3.70 m and 0.48 m were recorded for the residuals, the storm lasted 6 hours. 

At Vista Alegre, SSE values of 3.41 m were found and for residual values of 0.45 m, with the storm 

lasting 12 hours. 

Although there was an increase in water levels in these days (24th and 25th December), at 

all stations, Ponte Varela recorded the highest value between days 23 and 24, for this month. In the 

remaining tide gauges, the highest values of SSE were recorded at dates close to the New Moon – 

spring tides. In Vagueira and Vista Alegre on day 5 (New Moon was on the 3rd day) and on Chegado 

was on day 31 (New Moon occurred on the 31st day). 

 

Once again, this event occurred due to the combination of different meteorological factors: 

a marked decrease in atmospheric pressure (below 1000 hPa) on day 24, Figure 22, an increase in 

wind intensity and duration, with predominant wind direction of W and SW, as it is shown in Figure 

23 a) and b).

Figure  24 - Rainfall (mm/h), December 2013. 

 

By theoretically calculating the values of the rise in water level due to the variation of the 

atmospheric pressure and the action of the wind, using the expressions 2.13 and 2.16, respectively, 

it can see that there are values in the order of 30.00 cm for the variation of the atmospheric 

pressure and 2.60 cm for the wind stress. It was verified that the duration of the wind action was 

high, more than 24 hours, with predominant W direction, the accumulation of water at the banks 

of the channels is a factor to be considered when determining the elevation of the water level, 

especially if the effect of the wind was felt perpendicularly to the margins of the channels than 

along the channels. Adding to these factors, justifies the values obtained for the SSE and for the 

residuals. 

 



44 

 

Local meteorological storm events 
 

In October 2012, March 2013, September 2015 and May 2016 only local generated events 

of meteorological tides were found. 

The Ponte Varela area was the region where most events took place. This may be related 

to local conditions, such as: the width of the channel, which is the largest when compared to the 

rest of the lagoon, with an unobstructed distance over which the wind can blow in a certain 

direction, increasing the size of the water slope on one side of the channel. The mathematical 

equation 2.17, also shows that the smaller the depth of the site, the higher the slope; also, the 

surrounding area is more unprotected, and the absence of high vegetation and/or housing, or other 

infrastructure, makes Ponte Varela a place where wind effects are most felt.  

 

 

October 2012 
 

From the analysis of Figure 25, it was verified that during October 2012 a meteorological 

tide occurred in Ponte Varela. 

 

 

Figure  25 - Observed water level (m) and residual levels (m) in: a) Barra and b)  Ponte Varela: 
October 2012. 

 

One event was recorded between days 25 and 26 lasting 10 hours. The maximum value of 

the SSE was 3.36 m and the residual value was 0.55 m, on the 26th. In Barra meteorological tides 

did not occur during this month. 

 

 



45 

 

A decrease of the atmospheric pressure below 1000 hPa, occurred between the days 25 

and 26 (Figure 26). The intensity and duration of the wind, on days 27 to 28 (Figure 28), was high, 

with predominant direction of ESE on day 25 and NW on day 26 [Figure 27 a) and b)].

46 

 

 

Figure  28 - Wind speed (m/s), October 2012. 

 

With this variation in atmospheric pressure, and wind intensity, using the mathematical 

expressions 2.13 and 2.16, it is possible to verify that theoretically there was an increase in the 

water level of 20.00 cm due to the variation of the atmospheric pressure, but in relation to the wind 

the theoretical value is negligible since the intensity of the wind was not high. As the predominant 

ESE and NW wind, the water accumulation at the margin in this area of the lagoon was probably 

responsible for the values found for SSE and for the residuals.  

Between the days 24 and 25 values of precipitation ranged between 0.50 mmh-1 to            

0.80 mmh-1 (Figure 29). The influence of precipitation could have been felt locally, but the main 

meteorological factors for the formation of this event were the variation of the pressure and the 

wind intensity and duration. 

 

 

Figure  29 – Rainfall (mm/h), October 2012. 

 



47 

 

March 2013 
 

In March 2013, there were values of positive anomalies lasting more than 5 consecutive 

hours for Ponte Varela and Chegado stations (Figure 30). 

 

 

Figure  30 - Observed water level (m) and residual levels (m) in March in the stations:  

a) Barra; b) Ponte Varela and c) Chegado. 

 

The highest SSE and residual values were recorded in Chegado (3.85 m and 0.69 m, 

respectively). The duration of this event in this area was approximately 11 hours, between 5 and 6 

March. In Ponte Varela the SSE value was 3.60 m and the residual value was        0.68 m, the storm 

lasted 18 hours in the same days. In Barra meteorological tides did not occur during this month. 

In this month, the highest SSE in Ponte Varela and Chegado was recorded at the time of 

spring tides (New Moon on March 11th and Full Moon on March 27th). In Ponte Varela, on day 10, a 

value of 3.60 m and in Chegado on day 29, a value of 3.85 m was registered. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



48 

 

A decrease in atmospheric pressure between days 3 and 5, below the 990 hPa (Figure 31) 

and the values for the wind intensity and especially its duration, also between days 6 and 7 (close 

to 11 ms-1) [ figure 32 b)], were the meteorological conditions for the occurrence of meteorological 

tide events on March 4th and 10th.

Theoretically calculating the values of the rise of the SSE due to the variation of the 

atmospheric pressure and the action of the wind, by the expressions 2.13 and 2.16, respectively, 

there are values in the order of 30.00 cm for the variation of the atmospheric pressure and 1.90 cm 

for the wind stress. It was verified that the duration of the wind action was high, more than 24 

hours, with predominant SW direction, and the accumulation of water at the banks of the channels 



49 

 

is a factor to be considered. All these factors together, justifies the values obtained for the SSE and 

for the residuals. 

Precipitation values during 7th day (1.60 mmh-1) (Figure 33), may have influenced locally.

September 2015 
 

From the analysis of Figure 34, it was verified that between 15 and 16 September a 

meteorological tide occurred in Ponte Varela and Rio Novo. 

 

 

 

 

Figure  34 - Observed water level (m) and residual levels (m) in September in the stations:  

a) Barra; b) Ponte Varela and c) Rio Novo. 

 

 

In Rio Novo, SSE and residual values were 3.93 m and 0.46 m, respectively. The duration of 

this event in this area was approximately 6 hours, between 15 and 16 September. In Ponte Varela 

the SSE value was 3.62 m and the residual value was 0.75 m, the storm lasted 15 hours in the same 

days. Although Barra did not verify residual values superior by  3?, there was an increase of that 

values on September 15th (Figure 34).  

 

 

 

 

 



51 

 

During the days 15 and 16, there was a conjugation between high changes in atmospheric 

pressure (Figure 35), in which it dropped to values below 1000 hPa (a decrease of approximately 

20 hPa in 24 hours) and an increase of the wind intensity [Figure 36 b)], reaching values in the order 

of 18 ms-1.

b) 

 

Figure  36 - a) Wind Rose in the days 15th to 16th September 2015. 

b) Wind speed (m/s), September 2015. 

 

With this variation in atmospheric pressure, and wind intensity, using the mathematical 

expressions 2.13 and 2.16, it is possible to verify that theoretically there was an increase in the 

water level of 20.00 cm due to the variation of the atmospheric pressure, and 6.40 cm for the wind 

stress. Another effect caused by the wind tension is the accumulation of water at the banks of the 

channels.  



52 

 

Precipitation had a maximum value of 1.40 mmh-1, on 15th September (Figure 37). 

 

 

Figure  37 - Rainfall (mm/h), September 2015. 

 

In Rio Novo a possible increase of the flow of Vouga River, due to the high precipitation, 

must also be considered. 

Adding to these weather effects, spring tides were also recorded at that time, since New 

Moon was on 13th September, thus raising the water level. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



53 

 

May 2016 

 
 Positive anomalies were recorded in May 2016, in Ponte Varela, Chegado and Vista Alegre 

(Figure 38). 

 

 

Figure  38 - Observed water level (m) and residual levels (m) in May 2016 in the stations: a) 
Barra; b) Ponte Varela; c) Chegado and d) Vista Alegre. 

 

 

In Ponte Varela, the highest SSE and residual values were recorded, 3.86 m and 0.85 m, 

respectively. The duration of this event in this area was approximately 8 hours, at May 8th. In 

Chegado and Vista Alegre the storm lasted 5 hours in the same day and the SSE values were 3.85 m 

and 3.71 m, and the residual value were 0.81 m and 0.52 m, respectively. In Barra meteorological 

tides did not occur during this month. 

The maximum annual SSE values found for the stations of Ponte Varela and Vista Alegre 

were recorded on May 8th, the day on which the storm effects were most felt. It should be noted 



54 

 

that, although there are no residual values above 3? with a duration of 5 hours or more in Rio Novo, 

the annual maximum value is recorded on this date.  

New Moon on May 6th also influenced these values, due to spring tides. 

A decrease in atmospheric pressure to 990 hPa between 7th and 8th May 2016 (Figure 39) 

and the increase of the wind intensity to 9 ms-1 on day 8 [Figure 40 b)], with predominant direction 

of E [Figure 40 a)], were the meteorological factors responsible for the formation of this event.

Theoretically calculating the values of the rise of the SSE due to the variation of the 

atmospheric pressure and the action of the wind, by the expressions 2.13 and 2.16, respectively, 



55 

 

there are values in the order of 20.00 cm for the variation of the atmospheric pressure and 1.30 cm 

for the wind stress. It was verified that the duration of the wind action was high, more than 24 

hours and the accumulation of water at the banks of the channels is a factor to be considered when 

determining the elevation of the water level. Adding these factors, justifies the values obtained for 

the SSE and for the residuals. 

Values close to the 2.00 mmh-1 for rainfall, also during day 8 (Figure 41), could have 

influenced the values of the residuals found in the stations of Ponte Varela, Chegado and Vista 

Alegre.

5.4.2. Analysis of Negative Anomalies 

 
 

Negative anomalies were recorded only in Ponte Varela in the months of February and 

March 2015 (Figures 42 and 43) . 

 

Figure  42 - Observed water level (m) and residual levels (m) in 1st to 28th February in: 

 a)Barra and b) Ponte Varela. 

 

 

Figure  43 - Observed water level (m) and residual levels (m) in 1st to 31st March in: 

a) Barra and b) Ponte Varela. 

 

In Ponte Varela, the surface elevation (SSE) and residual values were 0.77 m and                         

0.49 m, in February 17th. The duration of this event in this area was approximately 12 hours. 



57 

 

In March, two events were recorded, the first between 4th and 5th March and the second 

between 28th and 31st March. The lowest SSE was in March 5th, 0.84 m, but the lowest residual value 

was -0.53 m in 31st de March. The storm lasted 7 hours between the 4th and 5th March, and 12 hours 

between the 28th and 31st March. In Barra meteorological tides did not occur during this month. 

Spring tides occurred on February 18th and March 5th, and this may have influenced the 

occurrence of negative anomalies and the minimum values of water level found in these months. 

In February, between days 16th and 17th, and in March between days 4th and 5th and 

between 28th and 31th, the atmospheric pressure rose to 1035 hPa (Figure 44 and Figure 45). 

 

Figure  44 - Atmospheric pressure (hPa), February 2015. 

 

 

 

Figure  45 - Atmospheric pressure (hPa), March 2015. 

 



58 

 

As already mentioned, an increase in atmospheric pressure of one hPa will produce a 

theoretical decrease in sea water level of one centimetre (Pugh, 2004). At both time intervals 

recorded in February, the water level drop was around 15.00 cm, but in relation to March, the 

highest variation in atmospheric pressure was observed between days 28th and 31st, with a value of 

30 hPa, corresponding to a drop-in water level of approximately 30 cm.  

Regarding the wind intensity in February and March (Figures 46 and 48), ranged between 5 

and 7 ms-1, being the predominant NW direction in February and March 28th to 31st [Figure 47 and 

49 b)]. At March 4th and 5th, the direction of the predominant wind was NE [Figure 49 a)].

under study (Tables 5 and 6), comparing the dates in which these values occurred with the 

occurrence of spring tides.

It has been verified that the highest values found annually happen after the occurrence of 

a Full Moon or a New Moon, with intervals from one to three days, but the lowest values usually 



62 

 

occur one or four days before a Full Moon or a New Moon. In 2016, the highest annual SSE occurred 

in relation to the years under study, except for Vista Alegre, where the highest value was found in 

2014 and for Vagueira that was found in 2017.

Looking at the residual values presented in Table 6, they generally occurred at the same 

time as SSE, that is, the highest values found occurred in days after a spring tide and the lowest in 

the days before. 

Some exceptions were verified: on January 19th, 2013, in the stations of Ponte Varela, 

Vagueira and Vista Alegre, the values of the residuals coincide with the meteorological tide 

occurred on that date; In the same year, on Chegado, the highest value of the residual was on 

December 24th, the date when there was also a meteorological tide; These events were generated 

remotely, their effect being felt throughout the lagoon, which reflected on the results obtained.

6. Conclusions 
 

To study the tidal changes induced by geomorphologic modifications between 1987/88 and 

2017, the variations in the main constituents of tide in Ria de Aveiro, namely the semidiurnal tides 

(?2  and ?2), the shallow water tides ?4  and ?6 , and the fortnightly spring/neap tide cycle (???) 

was studied. 

The semidiurnal tidal constituents, ?2  and ?2, are the most relevant for studies on tide 

changes, due to variations in the geomorphology of Ria de Aveiro, since they are the major 

constituents of the total tidal energy, as reported in the analysis of the Fourier spectra. By analysing 

the amplitude and the tidal phase variation of ?2  and ?2  between 1987/88 and 2002/03, it verified 

that there is an amplitude increase and a decrease of the phase, in all the stations studied.  

Dredging in 1998, which increased the depth of the main navigation channels appears to 

be the most important factor contributing to these results, since the greatest variations occurred 

between 1987/88 and 2002/03. This means that as the main channels become deeper, the tidal 

wave amplitude increases, and its propagation becomes faster. 

From 2002/03 to 2017, the amplitude and phase remained practically constant, showing 

that the extension of the north jetty by 200 m in 2012, did not induce significant changes in the 

dynamics of the tide along the lagoon. 

Although the energy of the shallow water tidal constituents is low, these constituents must 

also be considered, since the bottom friction modifies the propagation of the tidal wave along the 

lagoon channels. In the studied tide gauges, the amplitude of constituents ?4  and ?6  increased 

between 1987/88 and 2002/03. This trend is justified by the transfer of part of the energy from ?2  

to the constituents ?4  and ?6 .  Despite this trend, there was a decrease in the amplitude of these 

two constituents in Barra and Vagueira. This can be justified by a reduction of the bottom friction 

due to the increase of the channel depth from Barra to Vagueira and specifically in the area where 

the tide gauges are located, resulting of dredging operations throughout the lagoon in 1998.  

The phase of the constituent  ?4  decreased in all the stations between 1987/88 and 

2002/03, except for Rio Novo. For the constituent ?6 , from 1987/88 to 2002/03, the phase 

increased in the Cais do Bico/Chegado, Vagueira and Rio Novo and decreased in the other stations. 

Between the years of 2012 and 2017, the amplitude and phase values of the constituents, ?4  and 

?6 , remained practically constant. 

The tidal constituent ??f, represents the variation of the water level in a spring / neap tide 

cycle, and is influenced by ?2  and ?2. A decrease in the amplitude from 1987/88 to 2002/03 can 

be observed in most the studied places, except for Ponte Varela. Between 2012 and 2017 the 

amplitude of this constituent increased in all the tide gauges, which means that in this time interval 

the difference in amplitude between the spring tides and the neap tides has been increasing. 

The increase or decrease of the bottom friction will also change the tidal velocities along 

Ria de Aveiro channels, making the velocity of the flood and ebb tides unequal, giving rise to the 

asymmetry of the tide. This inequality will depend on phases of the ?2  and ?4  constituents. Tidal 



65 

 

asymmetry often plays a key role in determining sediment transport and deposition/erosion 

patterns in several tidal dominated estuaries and inlets.  

The results of this work show that in 1987/88 all stations located in the channels of the 

lagoon are flood-dominant, except for Barra that is ebb-dominant from 1987/88 to 2017. 

 From this date onward, it can see that while the Ponte Varela, Vagueira and Vista Alegre 

stations still remain flood-dominant, which means that the maximum velocity during the flood is 

higher than during the ebb and thus the sediment transport is done upstream, the Rio Novo and 

Chegado stations show ebb dominance, which translates in  higher velocity during the ebb rather 

than the flood, and as such the sediment transport is preferentially done downstream which 

increases the erosion in those places. In Barra was ebb-dominating between 1987/88 and 2017. 

Also, by analysing the values of Form number over these years, the results show that the 

tide is predominantly semidiurnal in all lagoon, between 1987/88 and 2017. There are two high 

tides and two low tides in a period of 12h and 25 minutes, which corresponds to a half of a lunar 

day.  

The frequency of occurrence of storm surge phenomena between 2012 and 2017 was 

determined and the meteorological factors that influenced the generation of meteorological tides 

were studied, among them the variation in atmospheric pressure and wind intensity and direction. 

Through the analysis of the tidal residuals it was verified that positive anomalies are more 

frequent than negative anomalies. From the different events occurring between 2012 and 2017, 

only two positive storm surges influenced the entire lagoon (January and December 2013), having 

been influenced by adverse meteorological conditions verified at national level. The remainder 

were manifested only locally in October 2012, March 2013, September 2015 and May 2016. The 

events with negative anomalies occurred in a smaller number. 

The response of the residual water level to barometric pressure is found to be most 

significant during periods of low pressure systems. The effect of invert barometer is checked, that 

is, a decrease in atmospheric pressure induces an increase in water level and vice-versa. Also, it has 

been found that when the atmospheric pressure decreases or increases in small time intervals 

(approximately 24 hours), the effect is more visible, especially in positive storm surges. Wind is also 

a determining factor, and it has been verified that high intensity and long duration winds affect the 

lagoon. In relation to wind direction, the predominant ones were NW, SW, W and S, the wind 

tension can induce the accumulation of water at the banks of the channels. 

The Ponte Varela area was the place where most locally generated events took place. This 

may be related to local conditions, such as: the width of the channel, which is the largest when 

compared to the rest of the lagoon, with an unobstructed distance over which the wind can blow 

in a certain direction, increasing the size of the water slope on one side of the channel. Additionally, 

the surrounding area is more unprotected, and the absence of high vegetation and /or housing or 

other infrastructure, makes Ponte Varela a place where wind propagation is most felt.  

From the analysis of all the studied events, it was verified that the higher values of the sea 

water level and of residual values did not result from the existence of meteorological tides, but due 

to the spring tides. Exception for the event that occurred between January 18th and 19th, 2013 



66 

 

whose highest values of SSE and residual dues at Vagueira and Vista Alegre stations were recorded 

at that date. 

 Therefore, the interaction of a positive storm event at high tide with a spring tide will be 

risky event, which may influence the occurrence of marginal flooding in the lagoon. 

The existence of tide gauges located along the main channels of the Ria de Aveiro, during 

the time intervals studied, would have helped to analyse the evolution of the tide from the inlet to 

the head of the different channels, and in the study of its variation with the geomorphological 

changes that the lagoon has been suffering over the last years and would have been a plus for this 

thesis. 

The possibility of installing a large number of tide gauges along the channels of the Ria de 

Aveiro will enable a more comprehensive analysis of the various changes that this natural system 

will suffer, either by natural or anthropogenic modifications.
