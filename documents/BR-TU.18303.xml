ABSTRACT 

A common problem in the production of ferromanganese alloys is the lack of knowledge about the 
mineralogical and metallurgical properties of the manganese lump ores. An important quality 
parameter of the lump ores is the decrepitation, which has not been studied adequately yet. This work 
presents physical, chemical and mineralogical characterizations of manganese lump ores from the 
three main Brazilian mines, Azul, Morro da Mina and Urucum, as well as their decrepitation behaviors. 
The samples, after characterization, were separated in three batches, one as received, the second 
after drying at 105°C, and the third after thermal treatment at 200°C. They were then tested for 
decrepitation at the temperature of 700°C for 30 min, with the particle size range kept between 19 and 
6.3mm. The influence of the thermal history was studied together with the influence of the typological 
classifications of the ores, i.e., anhydrous-oxide for Urucum, hydrated-oxide for Azul, silicate-
carbonate for Morro da Mina. A significant difference amongst the decrepitation behaviors was 
observed for the lump ores from Azul, Urucum and Morro da Mina. The oxide ores from Urucum (-
6.3mm = 10%) and Azul (-6.3mm = 6%) present a high susceptibility to decrepitation, whilst the 
silicate-carbonate from Morro da Mina shows no decrepitation. The presence of moisture increased 
the decrepitation intensity of the Azul and Urucum lump ores. The bench-scale thermal treatment 
reduced in more then 60% the decrepitation indexes of both ores. 
 

1 INTRODUCTION 
The manganese lump ores are largely employed as raw material for the production of 
ferromanganese alloys. The mixture of these ores, originated from various mines or even different pits 
in the same mine, are usually defined at the ferroalloy plants according solely to their chemical and 
granulometric characteristics [1]. 
  
A common problem at the operation procedure of metallurgical furnaces in the production of 
ferromanganese alloys is the lack of knowledge about the mineralogical and metallurgical properties 
of the manganese lump ores. In this context, an important quality parameter of the lump ores is the 
decrepitation, which has not been studied adequately yet. The decrepitation, which is the breakage of 
lump ores upon heating, with the production of fine materials, causes efficiency loss of the reduction 
reactors, due to the reduced permeability of the mineral bed. Furthermore, the use of ore mixtures 
with high susceptibility to decrepitation causes less efficiency of heat exchanges and changes on the 
charge´s electric resistivity, leading also to damages to the operation and to the thermal efficiency of 
the reactor [1, 2]. 
 
This is a pioneer work as it studies the decrepitation of various typological categories of Brazilian 
manganese lump ores, as well as the employment of heat treatments aiming at reducing the intensity 
of this phenomenon. This information, combined with a better mineralogical characterization of these 
materials, is of great importance for the definition of technical criteria that can guide the selection of 
ore mixtures from different mines, in addition to the improvement of the process control and 
functionality. 

 
Manganese has great economical significance in Brazil. The three main mines are Urucum, Azul and 
Morro da Mina [1].The mineralogy of manganese ores is varied and complex. Manganese occurs in

more than 300 minerals, but only a few of those have a significant amount of the element and they 
make up the ores of higher values. The manganese ores normally exist as oxides, hydroxides, 
silicates and carbonates. The manganese can have bivalent, trivalent and tetravalent states [2, 3]. 
 
The Urucum manganese mine is located at the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, in the city of Corumba, 
near the Brazilian border with Bolivia. The manganese occurs as an oxide. This manganese mine is 
one of the most important in Brazil, since the beginning of its exploration. It is sedimentary, with the 
deposition of primary manganese oxides. The ore is formed mainly by cryptomelane and pyrolusite[4]. 
Nowadays, the exploited ore is classified in two kinds according to their phosphorus content, the main 
contaminant of this ore. One kind is the Standard (ST) containing more than 0.12% of phosphorus. 
The other is the Low Phosphorus (LP), presenting less than 0.12% of phosphorus. The mine lump 
ores are generated from these two kinds [5]. 
 
The Morro da Mina mine is located in the city of Conselheiro Lafaiete, in the metallurgical region of 
the state of Minas Gerais. The rocks from this mine belong to the Rio das Velhas group, identified as 
a vulcanic-sedimentary sequence of greenstone belt, included in the Iron Quadrangle [5]. The main 
products of Morro da Mina are the carbon-silicates, which present as main constituent minerals: 
rhodochrosite (MnCO3), pyroxmangite (MnSiO3), espessartite (Mn3Al2 (SiO4) 3) and tephroite 
(Mn2SiO4). The silicon-carbonate ore is characterized by its dark grey color; it is compact and fine to 
medium grained. It is commonly found in brownish to pinkish color, in lens and plates that create a 
thin compositional banding [5]. 
  
The Azul manganese mine is the largest producer of manganese ore (oxide) in Latin America, with an 
annual production of 2.5 Mt. The ore produced is directed mainly to the production of ferroalloys and, 
in a smaller scale, to the chemical and batteries industry [5]. 

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Representative samples of lump ore product of the three main Brazilian mines (Morro da Mina (MG), 
Urucum (MS) and Azul (PA)) were selected.  Sampling was performed in each one of those mines, 
selecting a ton of each of the main lump products. Approximately 1,000kg of each sample of lump ore 
was then homogeneized and  quartered. A portion of about 400kg was sampled and classified using 
Tyler mesh sizes of 37.5; 19; 6.3 and 3mm. 

 
The particle size range chosen for the decrepitation tests was 19 to 6.3mm, with an average particle 
size of 12.7mm, therefore ideal for the good performance of submerged arc furnaces. The mass of 
material between 19 and 6.3mm, for each of the ore groups, was again quartered until about 50kg. 

 
The 50kg samples of each of the lump products were divided in order to reserve 10kg for the 
chemical, physical and mineralogical characterization procedures and 40kg for the decrepitation tests. 
The samples were not submitted at any time to operations that could induce internal tensions or 
changes in moisture. 

 
The decrepitation indexes for the lump ores from Morro da Mina, Urucum and Azul mines were 
measured according to the ISO 8731 standard for iron ores as described below, except for the particle 
size range used, comprehended between 19 to 6.3mm. 
 
To determine the decrepitation index, 5kg of each ore, between 19 to 6.3mm, dried at 105oC, was 
quartered in 10 samples of 0.5kg. Each sample was placed in an oven at 700oC with residence time 
of 30 minutes. After this period, each sample was screened at 6.3mm, 3.35mm, 1.18mm and 0.5mm. 
The decrepitation indexes were obtained by the average of percentage mass below each grid. 
 
The influences of moisture and thermal treatment on the ores decrepitation behaviors were 
investigated. Each ore with natural moisture was submitted to the same procedures described above 
without drying. The procedure was also repeated for the three ores, but with a thermal treatment at 
200oC for 48 hours prior to the essay at 700°C.  

 
Figure 1 consists of a flowchart that summarizes the sequence of procedures adopted for the 
characterization study of the decrepitation behavior of manganese lump ores from Urucum, Morro da 
Mina and Azul mines.

The manganese ores studied in this work presented very distinct chemical characteristics. In the 
range between 19 and 6.3mm, the manganese content in the ore from Azul (46.96wt%) is much 
higher than in the others. The sample from Morro da Mina has the lowest manganese content, of 
24.48wt%. The ore from Urucum has an intermediate manganese content of 32.85wt%. The content 
of SiO2 is higher in the ore from Morro da Mina (23.02wt%) than in the others. The SiO2 content in the 
samples from Urucum (2.11wt%) and Azul (3.99wt%) are respectively 20.91 and 19.02 percentual 
points lower than the content in the Morro da Mina ore. 

3.2 Mineralogical Characterization 

Table 2 shows theminerals identified and semi-quantified by the X-ray difraction, in the range between 
19 and 6.3mm of the Azul, Morro da Mina and Urucum manganese ores. 
 
It is noticed that the lump ores of Urucum and Azul mines are mainly composed by oxides, with the 
prevalence of cryptomelane. The ore from Urucum also presents other mineral constituents, such as 
braunite, pyrolusite, hematite, goethite and quartz. Other constituents of Azul ore are todorokite, 
pyrolusite, gibbsite, espessartite, magnetite and N-sutite. It is remarkable that this ore has the largest 
fraction of hydrated minerals. 
 
The lump ore from Morro da Mina is composed mainly by carbonates and silicates, more specifically 
by rhodochrosite and espessartite. The other minerals found are fayalite, ferrosilite, manganosite and 
magnetite, in addition to the amphiboles and pyroxenes. 
 
The prevailing mineral phases in the three lump ore samples studied were identified by optical 
microscopy and by electron microscopy combined with electron microprobe (EDS).  Figure 2 shows a

The data obtained by the BET method on specific surface and porosity are important parameters for 
the understanding of decrepitation, once the vapor pressure, which is originated from the elimination 
of structural water, can be relieved depending on the ore´s pore structure. 
 
According to the data obtained with the BET method, the porosities of the ores studied show large 
differences. The most porous ore is the one from Azul (35.75cm3/kg) followed by Urucum 
(15.56cm3/kg) and then Morro da Mina (3.59cm3/kg). 

3.4 Thermogravimetry  

Figure 5 shows the thermogravimetry curve of the manganese lump ore samples from Azul, Morro da 
Mina and Urucum. Table 4 highlights the losses of mass in relation to the temperature for each of the 
samples. 
 
The mass loss during heating, from room temperature to 280oC, for the samples from Azul, Morro da 
Mina and Urucum is related to moisture loss. The deep mass loss initiated close to 400oC, seen on 
samples from Azul and from Urucum, is related to the beginning of the thermal decomposition of the 
hydrated mineral phases. In the samples from Azul, these phases are the todokorite and n-sutite. In 
the ones from Urucum, the hydrated phase is the goethite present in small amount. 
 
It is thought that the mass loss verified close to 500 oC in the manganese lump ore from Morro da 
Mina is related mainly to the elimination of structural water, which occurs in amphiboles, 
superimposed to the decomposition of some carbonates originated from ion substitution in 
rhodochrosite.

The decomposition of some oxides (cryptomelane and pyrolusite), more specifically the 
transformation from MnO2 into Mn2O3, begins close to 700

oC in the samples from Azul and Urucum. 
The mass variation observed in these samples close to 1000°C is related to the transformation of 
Mn2O3 into Mn3O4. The cryptomelane and pyrolusite probably turn into bixbyite (Mn2O3) between 700 
and 900oC, which together with the braunite begin their decomposition at 950oC, turning into 
hausmannite (Mn3O4). 
 
It is remarkable that the ore from Azul presented the biggest mass loss. This is partly due to its high 
natural moisture and to the number of hydrated phases. The ore from Morro da Mina presented the 
second highest mass loss and lower natural moisture. The most significant variations happened 
between 500 to 800oC and are related to the decomposition of amphiboles and rhodochrosite. The 
Urucum ore presented the lowest mass loss. The main mass variations are related to the 
decomposition of its constituent oxides. 
 

3.5 Decrepitation 

Figure 6 is a comparative graph of the decrepitation indexes (&lt;6.3mm,&amp;lt;3.35mm,&amp;lt;1.18mm,&amp;lt;0.5mm) 
measured from the wet, dry and heat treated manganese lump ore samples from Azul, Morro da Mina 
and Urucum. 
 
It can be noticed that the manganese lump ores from Azul, Morro da Mina and Urucum show distinct 
decrepitation behaviors. Urucum ore has the highest decrepitation index (I-6,3mm = 10%) followed by 
Azul (I-6,3mm = 6%). The decrepitation for Morro da Mina dry ore (I-6,3mm = 0,5%) is negligible. It is also 
noticed that the Urucum ore has the highest standard deviation, indicating a non homogeneous 
decrepitation behavior, with some particles very susceptible to decrepitation but not all.

Figure 6: Comparative graph of the decrepitation indexes of the wet, dry and heat treated 
manganese lump ores from Azul, Morro da Mina and Urucum in the range of 19 to 
6.3mm. 

It is important to observe that the ores with the highest decrepitation indexes are the ones that 
showed some mineralogical phase transformation at test temperature. Azul lump ore has a 
considerable fraction of hydrated minerals and manganese oxides that break down during 
decrepitation tests. The mass loss for the manganese oxide ore from Urucum is the lowest at 700oC 
and it is related mainly to the decomposition of the cryptomelane and pyrolusite. The silicate 
carbonate amphibole ore from Morro da Mina was the only one that did not decrepitate. 
 
One of the reasons for the decrepitation, is the elimination of structural water from the hydrated 
phases during thermal shock. The vapor pressure from the water gathered in ore pores as well as the 
elimination of the alkali originated in the phase transformations could be enough to cause catastrophic 
rupture of particles. The phase transformation experienced by the oxides at 700oC causes volumetric 
contractions, whichyield anisotropy that induces stress in specific regions of the ore particle, leading 
to the formation and propagation of cracks. 
 
It is important to observe that the Azul sample has the largest average diameter and volume of 
micropores, although it shows a higher concentration of hydrated mineral phases if compared to 
Urucum. This could enable a relief of vapor pressure inside ore particles to some extent, decreasing 
its decrepitation. The Urucum ore has a higher concentration of the pyrolusite mineral phase, which 
experiences a considerable reduction in volume when it transforms in bixbyite, and this could cause 
this ore to experience intense decrepitation. Considering this, it is possible that the thermal 
decompositions of manganese oxides are the factor that contributes most to the decrepitation of 
manganese lump ores. 
 
Despite the fact that moisture increased considerably the decrepitation intensity in the manganese 
lump ores from Azul and Urucum, it showed no influence in the ore from Morro da Mina. 
 
It was observed that the wet ores from Azul and Urucum decrepitated more than when dry, therefore 
confirming the moisture as an important parameter in the control of the decrepitation phenomenon of 
manganese ores. In the 6.3mm mesh, wet ores from Azul and Urucum showed an increase of 40 and 
37.5% respectively in their decrepitation indexes. The increase of the standard deviation is also 
remarkable, which risks the reliability and operational control of the process. 

 
A decrease of 33.3 and 60% in the average decrepitation indexes in relation to the dry samples and of 
60 and 75% in relation to wet samples was observed in heat treated ores from Azul and Urucum 
respectively. The decrease in the standard deviation is remarkable, which indicates that the heat

treated samples show a more homogeneous behavior in respect to the decrepitation phenomenon. 
This result presents a possible solution for increasing the control over the production of manganese 
fines in electric reduction furnaces. 
 
In this case, the decrease in decrepitation indexes can be related to the relief of induced tensions 
from the ore particles, originated during mineral processing. The Urucum manganese lump ore 
sample shows higher standard deviations due to presenting the pyrolusite phase in higher content 
than the Azul sample. 

4 CONCLUSIONS 
1. The manganese lump ores from Azul, Urucum and Morro da Mina tested for decrepitation showed 
very distinct chemical characteristics. Some of the physical characteristics of the three manganese 
lump ore samples are very distinct too. These manganese lump ores can be classified in three 
different typological categories according to their mineralogical compositions and based on the 
thermogravimetric tests. Urucum ore is type anhydrous-oxide, Azul is hydrated-oxide and Morro da 
Mina is hydrated-silicate-carbonate. 
 
2. At the thermogravimetric tests, the mass loss of the manganese lump ores from Urucum, Morro da 
Mina and Azul is related to the thermal decomposition of oxides (cryptomelane, pyrolusite e braunite) 
carbonates (rhodochrosite) and of hydrated mineralogical constituents (being the todorokite and 
amphiboles the main ones). The three studied lump ores showed different thermal behavior during 
these tests. 
 
3. There is a significant difference of intensity of the decrepitation phenomenon for the manganese 
lump ores from Azul, Urucum and Morro da Mina: 

• The oxide ores from Urucum (I-6,3mm = 10%) and from Azul (I-6,3mm = 6%) have high 
susceptibility to decrepitation. The carbonate-silicate ore from Morro da Mina does not 
decrepitate. At the studied conditions, the volumetric degradation caused by the thermal 
shock at 700oC is somehow related to the phase transformation occurred during the thermal 
decomposition of the oxides cryptomelane [KMn8O16] and pyrolusite [MnO2]. 

• There are distinct decrepitation behaviors of the three manganese lump ores with natural 
moisture (tests without drying). The moisture increased considerably the decrepitation 
intensity (I-6,3mm) of Azul and Urucum lump ores (from 6% to 10% and from 10% to 16% 
respectively). There was no influence of the moisture on the degradation of Morro da Mina 
lump ore. 

• The heat treatment of 48 hours at 200oC at bench-scale reduced considerably the 
decrepitation indexes to only 4% for both lump ores from Urucum and Azul, a very promising 
result. The standard deviations also decreased, causing a more homogeneous decrepitation 
behavior. 

• No direct relation was observed between decrepitation and BET porosity, however studies on 
total porosity and pore shapes must be done, to investigate the total porosity influence.
