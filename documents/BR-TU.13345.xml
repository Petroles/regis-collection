resumo 
 
 

Os zeólitos têm propriedades únicas, como a porosidade, acidez e 

estabilidade térmica, desejadas quer na investigação académica, quer nas 

aplicações industriais. Neste trabalho foram preparadas amostras do zeólito 

ZSM-5 (Zeolite Socony Mobil–5) com propriedades de acidez distintas, 

nomeadamente o tipo e a força dos centros ácidos, investigadas recorrendo a 

experiências multinucleares 1D e 2D de RMN do estado sólido. As moléculas 

sonda de fósforo apresentam um grande potencial para caracterizar 

detalhadamente as propriedades de acidez destes materiais, por RMN do 

estado sólido. Esta tese apresenta novos resultados, mostrando que a 

interação entre a molécula sonda (TMPO) e os centros ácidos de Brønsted e 

Lewis não resulta em duas regiões distintas do espectro de RMN de

para obter mais informação acerca da interação desta molécula sonda com os 

centros ácidos. Combinando as experiências 1D e 2D de um conjunto de 

zeólitos com propriedades distintas, foi possível obter resultados e refutar ou 

resolver atribuições controversas encontradas na literatura. Neste trabalho 

foram também utilizados cálculos computacionais DFT, usando o método de 

cluster, para investigar a interação entre a molécula sonda e os centros ácidos 

de Brønsted.

abstract 
 

Zeolites have unique properties, such as porosity, acidity and thermal stability, 

desired for a wide range of both academic research and industrial applications. 

In this work, several ZSM-5 zeolite samples (Zeolite Socony Mobil–5) with 

distinct acidic properties, namely acid type and strength, were prepared and 

investigated through multinuclear 1D and 2D NMR experiments. Phosphorous 

containing probes show great potential to achieve a comprehensive 

characterization of zeolite’s acidic features, via solid-state NMR. New results 

presented in this thesis reveal that the interaction of TMPO with Brønsted and 

Lewis acid sites, does not result in two distinct regions in the 
31

P NMR spectra, 

in contrast with literature reports. 2D

P CP-HETCOR experiments were 

used for the first time in TMPO-loaded zeolites to gain more information on the 

interaction of TMPO molecules with the zeolite centers. Combining 1D and 2D 

experiments obtained for a group of ZSM-5 zeolites with tuned acidic 

properties, provided results that refute or solve certain controversial literature 

assignments. Cluster-based DFT computational methods were also used to 

investigate the interaction between TMPO and Brønsted acid sites.

1. Brief Introduction to Solid-State NMR 

1.1. Basic Theory 

Since its first reports in the mid-1940s,
1,2

 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 

became one of the most powerful and used spectroscopic tools in chemistry. Unlike 

solution-state NMR, where the rapid molecular tumbling reduces the isotropic interactions 

(angle depending interactions) giving an easily interpretable NMR spectra, solid-state 

NMR (SSNMR) had less impact at the early stages, due to the complex nature of their 

nuclear spin Hamiltonian in the absence of molecular tumbling.
3
  

Several technological and methodological developments, such as superconducting 

magnets attaining higher magnetic fields, probes able to rotate at higher spinning speeds 

and new pulse sequences, have contributed to overcoming some of the limitations of 

SSNMR, yielding NMR spectra with narrower resonances. Such advances made the 

technique a powerful tool to characterize several types of materials such as polymers, 

organic molecules, porous materials, organometallics, pharmaceuticals, biological systems, 

etc.
4
 

The NMR phenomenon depends on a nucleus intrinsic property, the spin angular 

momentum (I). Nuclei with I?0 are called NMR active nuclei and can be exploited to 

detect NMR signal. A general rule can be used to determinate if a nucleus is NMR active, 

relating the mass number and the number of neutrons (Table 1). The next topics provide an 

overview of nuclear interactions and some of the most common techniques used in 

SSNMR.

1.2. SSNMR Interactions 

NMR interactions can be classified into two different types: external and internal 

interactions. External interactions concern the interaction of one nucleus with an external 

magnetic field, such as the external static magnetic field (B0) or the radiofrequency 

magnetic field (B1). On the other hand, internal interactions are those pertaining the 

nucleus magnetic or electronic environment. These interactions can be approximated by 

the following Hamiltonians.
6
 

 NMR       r                       ( 1 ) 

Where HNMR represent the total Hamiltonian, HZ the largest interaction, called 

Zeeman interaction, Hrf the interaction resulting from applied radio frequency pulses, HCS 

the chemical shift, HD both homo and heteronuclear dipolar couplings, HJ the J-coupling 

and HQ the quadrupole interaction 

Most of the times, the larger spin nuclear interaction is the Zeeman interaction, thus 

most of the times the other interactions are considered as small perturbations to this greater 

interaction. This interaction can be expressed by Equation 2, where ? is the gyromagnetic 

ratio and Iz is the projection of the spin angular momentum along the B0 magnetic field z-

axis.  

   - ?I  0   ( 2 ) 

All the Hamiltonian equations reported in this work are in energy units; although 

both terms o  the equation should be multiplied by Planck’s constant ( ), this will be 

omitted for the sake of simplicity. 

When a nucleus is subjected to an external magnetic field B0, a splitting of energy 

levels, proportional to the magnetic field strength occurs, called Zeeman splitting. The 

equation that defines the energy levels for this splitting (Equation 3) can be obtained from 

the previous equation, and depend on the nuclear spin magnetic quantum number mI, 

where mI= I, I-1, …, -I. 

Em - ? mI 0   ( 3 )

1.2.1. Heteronuclear Dipolar Coupling 

Nuclear spins produce small local magnetic fields that influence neighbor spins 

with different magnitudes, depending on the internuclear distances (rIS) (Equation 4). 

Heteronuclear coupling corresponds to the interaction between two different nuclear spins.  

This interaction is proportional to the product of the gyromagnetic ratios of I and S spins 

(?I and ?S). Iz and Sz are the spin components in the z-axis of the spins I and S, whilst ? is 

the angle between the external magnetic field and the internuclear vector rIS.

1.2.2. Homonuclear Dipolar Coupling 

Unlike heteronuclear coupling, that arises from an interaction between two 

different nuclear spins, homonuclear dipolar coupling refers to an interaction between two 

like spins. The Hamiltonian that describes this interaction (Equation 5), is similar to the 

heteronuclear interaction Hamiltonian, however, an additional term is added referring to 

“ lip- lop” interaction, meaning that the system can now exchange magneti ation through 

energy conserving “ lip- lop” transitions.

The term I

orientation, and I

refers to the opposite effect. It is important to underline that this 

interaction only occurs for like spins with similar resonance frequencies. 

 

1.2.3. Chemical-Shift Anisotropy 

When a molecule is exposed to an external magnetic field B0, both the nuclei and 

the electrons interact with the external field. The interaction of B0 with surrounding 

electrons induces small local magnetic fields, that influence the effective magnetic field 

felt by the nucleus. Thus, the chemical shift can be understood as an interaction between 

the nucleus and the external, mediated by the surrounding electrons.  



4 

 

Generally, molecules possess non-spherical electronic distribution, thus the 

interaction between B0 and the nucleus, mediated by the non-spherical electronic cloud, 

become dependent on the orientation (anisotropic). This interaction has no visible effect on 

liquid state NMR because the randomly and rapid molecular tumbling eliminates the 

interaction. Chemical shift Hamiltonian (Hcs) is divided in two parts (Equation 6), one 

isotropic term and one anisotropic term (orientation dependent), where ?iso is the isotropic 

chemical shi t and ?CSA is the anisotropic chemical shift.

1.2.4. Quadrupolar Interaction 

The interactions discussed above focused on spin-½ nuclei (I = ½), however, most 

of the NMR active isotopes have nuclear spins higher than ½, with 2nI+1 spin states, called 

quadrupolar nuclei. The nuclear spin from these nuclei can be both integer (I = 1, 2, …) or 

half-integer (I    /2, 5/2, …), thus have more spin states more and a larger number of 

possible transitions. Quadrupolar nuclei have a unique nuclear spin interaction, called 

quadrupolar interaction, that often has a much larger magnitude compared to the other 

interactions.
7
 

Quadrupolar nuclei have a non-spherical charge distribution, which creates an 

electric quadrupole moment (Q) that interacts with the local electric-field gradient, which 

gives rise to quadrupolar interaction. The Hamiltonian that describes this interaction is 

quite complex, so a general approach considers only two orientation dependent terms, 

called first- and second-order quadrupole interactions. While the former, can be suppressed 

using magic-angle spinning (MAS), the latter can not be completely suppressed with this 

technique (discussed the topic 1.3.1) and therefore advanced techniques such double 

rotation (DOR), dynamic magic angle spinning (DAS) or multiple-quantum MAS 

(MQMAS) are required to obtain high-resolution spectra with quadrupolar nuclei.

1.3. Solid-State NMR Techniques 

1.3.1. Magic-Angle Spinning 

Magic-angle spinning (MAS) technique consists in rotating the sample holder 

several kHz around an angle ?M = 54.736º with the external magnetic field at which the 

Hamiltonian orientation depend term (3cos
2 
?–1), present on hetero and homonuclear 

dipolar coupling, 1
st
 order quadrupole coupling and CSA, averages to zero. This method 

tries to mimic the effect of rapid and isotropic molecular tumbling, observed in solution  

NMR, giving sharper peaks. At sufficiently low MAS rates the signal produces a manifold 

of spinning sidebands separated by integer multiples of the spinning speed fr equency, 

creating an envelope resembling the static line shape. The discovery of MAS contributed to 

extreme line narrowing of resonances, giving rise to high-resolution SSNMR spectra, 

especially in ½ spins.
7
 

 

1.3.2. Decoupling Techniques 

Both hetero and homonuclear dipolar interactions contribute to peak broadening in 

SSNMR spectroscopy, sometimes resulting in uninterpretable NMR spectra. Continuous-

wave (CW) heteronuclear decoupling was been widely used in I-S spin systems,
8
 where a 

radio frequency field irradiates the nuclei with the higher gyromagnetic ratio, thus 

removing the heteronuclear coupling between the I and S spins. In this technique, the 

decoupling efficiency is in general proportional to the irradiation power amplitude. Even 

though, the heteronuclear dipolar coupling can be removed using the CW approach, more 

sophisticated and efficient methods have been developed, such two-pulse phase 

modulation (TPPM)
9
 and small phase incremental alternation (SPINAL-n)

10
. 

Homonuclear decoupling of nuclei with low gyromagnetic ratio can be obtained 

with MAS, however solid-state samples presenting strong homonuclear dipolar couplings 

between like spins I-I with the high gyromagnetic ratio (e.g. 
1
H) need a different approach. 

These stronger interactions require more elaborated homonuclear decoupling techniques 

combining rotation and multipulse sequences (CRAMPS),
11

 such as WAHUHA
12

 or Lee-

Goldburg
13

 based methods. Technological advances allowed ultra-fast MAS rates (ca. 100 

kHz) that increase greatly the spectral resolution, e.g. in 
1
H MAS NMR.

14,15

1.3.3. Cross Polarization 

Since its first reports, cross polarization (CP) technique became one of the most 

important techniques in SSNMR.
16

 Most of the times this double resonance technique is 

used to enhance the sensitivity of a diluted nucleus (S) by transferring polarization from an 

abundant spin (I), however, CP can be also used to transfer magnetization between two 

abundant spins, e.g. from 
1
H to 

31
P. Most of the S spins that suffer from low sensitivity, 

also have a low gyromagnetic ratio and a long spin-lattice relaxation time, which results in 

time-consuming SSNMR experiments.  Using CP technique, the spectrum can be obtained 

with a considerably shorter experimental time mainly due to two combining advantages: 

the sensitivity enhancement of S spins (e.g., 
13

C,
29

Si) and the shorter spin-lattice relaxation 

time from I spins (e.g., 
1
H), resulting in spectra with lower signal to noise ratio even with 

less acquisition time (Figure 1). Information about the proximity between the I and S spins 

can be obtained from the CPMAS spectrum. In these experiments the magnetization is 

transferred through space, S spins near abundant spins are easily polarized, while those 

furthest require longer contact periods to be polarized.
7
 For this reason, no information 

about the stoichiometry of a system can be readily obtained from the intensity of the 

signals, as shown in Figure 1A where the most intense peak in the single pulse experiment 

becomes one of the less intense peaks in the CPMAS experiment.

Figure 2 illustrates a pulse sequence that can be used in a typical CP experiment, 

with an abundant spin I, trans erring its magneti ation to the diluted spin S. First, a  /2 

pulse is applied at the I channel to bring magnetization to the xy plane. Second, a radio-

frequency irradiation is applied simultaneously to both spins over a period, ?cp, where the 

magnetization is transferred from the abundant to the diluted spin. Then the signal of S 

spin is acquired, while the I spin is subject to heteronuclear decoupling irradiation.

1.3.4. Two-Dimensional NMR Spectroscopy 

Two dimensional (2D) experiments can give new information that helps overcome 

some difficulties or doubts from the analysis of 1D spectra, allowing the increase of 

spectral resolution due to the correlation in the indirect dimension. Although there are 

several 2D experiments in both liquid and solid-state NMR, the basic procedure is the 

same for all these experiments. Figure 3 shows a typical 2D experiment where four time 

periods can be distinguished. In this work 2D CP-Heterocorrelation (CP-HETCOR) 

experiments where used (Section 3.2.1.3), where the first period (Preparation; tp) is a ?/2 

pulse followed by a second period (Evolution; t1), where the magnetization can evolve for 

a period t1 under a specify Hamiltonian, for example under a homonuclear spin 

decoupling Hamiltonian. The 2D experiment result from a combination of several 1D 

experiments where the t1 period is increased (Figure 3). The third period (Mixing, tm), 

depending on the experiment can also be a single or a group of pulses that convert 

coherence into observable magnetization for the last period (Detection; t 2), in this work 

the tm period is a spinlock block where the magnetization is transferred from I to S spins. 



8 

 

In the last period each t1 increment is detected separately, resulting in time-dependent 

signal S(t1,t2).

2. Zeolites Acidity 

2.1. Introduction 

Aluminosilicate zeolites are microporous materials with a three-dimensional 

framework structure and a well-defined channels and pores. These molecular sized pores 

and channels are one of the most differentiating features in zeolites, allowing them to act as 

molecular sieves, adsorbing molecules smaller than the fitting size and excluding 

molecules with larger dimensions. The shape and size of the pores and channels are 

characteristic of each zeolite, for example, the Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (ZSM-5) has 10-

membered pores (used in this work) while the zeolite Y has a 12-membered ring (number 

of oxygens). 

Among a large variety of applications,
18–20

 zeolites had a large impact on 

petrochemical industries due to their acidic characteristics. Most of the studies concerning 

zeolites properties focus on the acidic properties of these materials. Generally, zeolites 

have two types of acid sites (Figure 4), Brønsted (proton donors) and Lewis (electron pair 

acceptors) acid sites.  

 

Figure 4 - Representation of different types of acid sites. a) terminal silanol hydroxyls, b) 

Brønsted acid sites (bridging hydroxyls); c) Lewis acid sites. 

Figure 4 shows the most common sites that can be found in a zeolitic structure. 

Brønsted acidity arises from bridging hydroxyl groups (Figure 4b) and from terminal 

hydroxyls groups (silanol; Si-OH) (Figure 4a), since the latter are very weak Brønsted 

sites, some authors refer to these as non-acidic groups. The formation of Lewis acid sites 

occurs in the dealumination process and is associated with defects in the framework, also 

called extra-framework aluminum (EFAL) species (Figure 4c). The dealumination 

treatment usually removes framework aluminum atoms with thermal dehydroxylation 

forming silanol nests and EFAL species with different structures, e.g., AlO
+
, Al(OH)2

+
, 

AlOH
2+

, AlOOH and Al(OH)3.
21,22

 



10 

 

 

The formation of Brønsted acid sites occurs when a silicon atom is replaced with a 

trivalent aluminum, in a framework containing only tetrahedral SiO4 units (Figure 4) 

bounded by corner-sharing oxygens. When the Si atom is replaced with a trivalent 

aluminum, the framework becomes negatively charged and a cation (e.g. H
+
, Na

+
, K

+
) is 

needed to balance the structure. In their protonated form, zeolites belong to a class of 

materials called solid acid catalysts.
23

 These solid-state catalysts appear as an alternative to 

the highly toxic and corrosive liquid acid catalysts, such H2SO4 and HF, used as 

homogeneous catalysts in petrochemical industry.
24

  

The performance of solid-state acid catalysts depends on their acidic features 

namely, the acid type (Brønsted or Lewis), acidic strength, distribution, accessibility and 

amount of acid sites. Therefore, a complete understanding of these properties is needed to 

design highly efficient solid acid catalysts. Although there is a variety of techniques 

capable of characterizing the acidity of this type of materials, solid-state NMR is the most 

versatile technique as it may, for instance, probe the local defects (catalytic sites) of 

zeolitic structures.
25,26

  

 

2.2. Acidity characterization using Framework Nuclei 

Over the past decades, zeolites have been used as catalysts for hydrocarbons 

transformations, as an alternative to the more toxic and corrosive liquid acid catalysts.
27,28

 

Although is well accepted that zeolites act as catalysts in cracking processes, the 

mechanism and involvement of the acid sites still present many challenges to overcome.  

Zeolites acidity can be characterized by a variety of analytical and spectroscopic 

techniques such microcalorimetry, temperature programmed desorption (TPD),
29,30

 Fourier 

transform infrared (IR),
31,32

 and NMR. Although most of these techniques are well 

described in the literature and can obtain accurate information about the amount, strength 

and type of acid site, other important features such as distribution and location of acid sites 

can be efficiently probed by SSNMR spectroscopy. 

A variety of SSNMR techniques have been applied and developed to study zeolites 

acidity, reflecting the great interest in this topic. The evaluation of zeolitic acidity through 

SSNMR can be made by direct observation of nuclei involved in the acidic groups, such 

1
H, 

29
Si or 

27
Al or through the observation of adsorbed basic probes such as acetone,

33
 



11 

 

pyridine
34,35

 and phosphorous-containing probes.
36–38

 In the next sections, the pros and 

cons of these methods will be briefly reviewed. 

 

2.2.1. 
1
H MAS NMR 

The simplest approach to investigates zeolite acidity is to look directly into the 

acidic protons, using 
1
H MAS NMR. Unlike other zeolites nuclei (e.g., 

29
Si, 

27
Al, 

17
O), 

1
H 

(I=1/2) is a nucleus with a high gyromagnetic ratio and almost a 100% natural abundance, 

thus reflecting a high sensitivity. Unfortunately, 
1
H NMR has a narrow chemical shift 

range (?? ~ 20 ppm), which compromises the spectral resolution when compared to other 

spin-1/2 nuclei such as 
13
  (?? ~ 250 ppm) or 

31
P (?? ~ 650 ppm).

24
  

As shown in Figure 5, some typical groups can be identified in the 
1
H MAS NMR 

spectra of H-form zeolites. 
1
H NMR resonances at lower chemical shifts are usually 

assigned to non-acidic hydroxyls groups (?H: 1.5-2.0 ppm), on the other hand, acidic 

protons have higher 
1
H resonances (?H: 3.6-5.6 ppm). Other minor peaks can also appear, 

for example, disturbed acid sites usually appear at higher chemical shifts (?H &gt; 6 ppm) and 

arise from acidic groups that participate in hydrogen bonds with neighbor oxygens. The 
1
H 

MAS NMR spectra of dealuminated zeolites might also show resonance associated with 

Lewis acid sites (?H: 2.4-3.6 ppm).
39–41

 

 

Figure 5 - Schematic representation of some typical groups in H-form zeolites; (blue) bridging 

hydroxyl, (green) silanol and (red) disturbed bridging hydroxyl group. 



12 

 

In NMR spectroscopy, the surrounding environment has a large influence on 

experimental parameters. Generally, low field peaks (higher chemical shifts) are associated 

with stronger acids, however, the interaction of acidic protons with neighbor oxygens, in 

small pores, lead to higher chemical shifts than those in larger cages.
42

 For instance, the 
1
H 

MAS NMR spectrum of the HY zeolite shows two peaks appearing at 4.2 and 5.2 ppm, 

assigned to bridging hydroxyls in super (larger) cages and sodalite (smaller) cages, 

respectively.
40,41

 

Although this approach is suitable for obtaining preliminary information and a 

well-resolved spectrum with a short acquisition time, detailed information about the acid 

sites features such acid type, strength and distribution are precluded by the poor spectral 

resolution offered by 
1
H MAS NMR spectra. In this work 2D 

1
H-X CP-HETCOR (X = 

29
Si 

or 
31

P) experiments are used to distinguish acidic environments ( sections 4.1.1 and 

4.1.4.1). 

 

2.2.2. 
29

Si MAS NMR 

Silicon is one of the most abundant elements in zeolites and it is involved in 

Brønsted acid groups structure, however, the 
29

Si MAS NMR spectra of zeolites give no 

relevant information about the acidic features. Despite this, the 
29

Si MAS NMR spectra are 

usually used to estimate the Si/Al ratio,
43

 that has an inverse relationship to the amount of 

Brønsted acid sites in the framework. 

The zeolite framework is composed of TO4 groups, where T= Si or Al, connected 

via corner sharing. Silicon atoms are usually labeled according to the number of 

surrounding aluminum atoms Si(nAl), where n = 0, 1, 2,3 or 4 and refers the number of 

aluminum atoms surrounding the SiO4 groups. The 
29

Si MAS NMR spectra of zeolites 

present peaks between -75 and -125 ppm, corresponding to the different Si(nAl) groups.
44

 

The 
29

Si MAS NMR spectrum can be used to estimate the Si/Al ratio, using the peaks 

intensities (Equation 7), where ISi(nAl) is the peak intensity for the Si(nAl) atom,
45

 this 

equation only applies to materials with Si/Al ratios lower than 10.

2.2.3. 
27

Al MAS NMR 

Aluminum atoms in zeolites structure are always associated with the presence of 

acidic sites, both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, depending on the type aluminu m species. 

Therefore, studying the amount and distribution of aluminum atoms (Al siting) in the 

structure is important to understand zeolites acidity. The NMR active aluminum isotope 

(
27

Al), is a half-integer quadrupolar nucleus (I = 5/2) with 100% natural abundance.  

Framework aluminum atoms are tetra-coordinated (AlO4
-
) and as proven by 

Loewenstein, tetrahedral aluminum can not be connected to other tetrahedral aluminum via 

Al-O-Al bonds.
47

 Usually, the spectrum of zeolites without EFAL has one or more peaks 

between 50-65 ppm, assigned to framework tetrahedral aluminum species. Extra-

framework aluminum species appear at lower chemical shifts, depending on their structure; 

octahedral species appear around 0 and 10 ppm and distorted four-coordinated and five-

coordinated species around 30 and 50 ppm.
44,48

 Figure 6 shows the 
27

Al MAS NMR 

spectrum of a hydrated HZSM-5 zeolites dealuminated using strong acidic conditions, that 

can remove some of the framework species, forming EFAL species. The spectrum shows 

both tetrahedral (FAL) and octahedral (EFAL) aluminum species.

27

20 (sample MFI64 see experimental chapter) obtained at a B0 field of 16.4 T, showing both 

FAL and EFAL species. 



14 

 

Under MAS, the second-order quadrupolar interaction is only partially averaged 

out, in some cases, severe line broadening of the 
27

Al central transition may generate the 

so-called “invisible aluminum” species.
49

 This is often the case of EFAL sites with less 

symmetric geometries showing a much larger quadrupolar interaction.
50,51

 In hydrated 

zeolites the water molecules can coordinate to EFAL species, forming more stable species 

with increased symmetry that leads to a decrease of quadrupolar interaction and hence to a 

decrease in “invisible aluminum” species. Yu and coworkers used two-dimensional (2D) 

double-quantum single-quantum (DQ-SQ) MAS techniques to investigate the formation of 

extra framework species in an HY zeolite upon calcination at different temperatures, 500, 

600 and 700 ºC.
52

 In this study, the authors concluded that calcination at 500 ºC yields 

species around 0 ppm (octahedral Al), other species, i.e., distorted four and five-

coordinated, are formed only at higher temperatures.
52

 

 

2.3. Acidity Characterization using Probe Molecules 

Even though some information can be obtained using a direct observation of the 

acidic groups, over the past few years the use of different molecular probes showed 

promising results to obtain a better characterization of the acidic features in zeolites. In 

order to find a suitable molecular probe, it is required that the probe has basic properties 

and interact with zeolite acid sites forming acid-base pairs. This interaction can provide 

additional information into the nature of acid sites, that is almost impossible to obtain with 

the direct observation of the acid sites using SSNMR.   

Over the past few year, several probes molecules have been used to overcome the 

limited spectral resolution from 
1
H MAS NMR and the explore the acidic features of 

different zeolites.
42

 Several studies used 
13

C-labeled acetone to investigate the 
13

C MAS 

NMR spectra of acetone-loaded zeolites.
33,53

 Unfortunately, these 
13

C NMR experiments 

require 
13

C isotopic enrichment to obtain one spectrum in a reasonable time. Other studies 

used amines as probe molecules, such as ammonia, n-butylamine, pyridine and 

methylamine.
42,54

 Nitrogen has two NMR active nuclei, however, both of them have some 

disadvantages, 
14

N is a quadrupolar nucleus (I=1) and 
15

N (I=1/2) has a very low natural 

abundance (0.4 %).
34,55

 

Phosphorous containing probes appeared as an alternative to the above-mentioned 

molecules. These probes were successfully used to obtain information about the acid type 



15 

 

and strength and, when combined with elemental analysis data, information about the 

concentration and distribution can be easily obtained.
24,56

  

Table 2, present the pros and cons from the above-mentioned probes to access a 

specific feature from an acid site. Even though each of these probing nuclei has inherent 

advantages and disadvantages, it seems that 
31

P MAS NMR is the better approach to 

investigate zeolites acidity, thus will be discussed in more detail in the next in the next 

section.

2.3.1. Phosphorous containing probes 

Phosphorous active NMR isotope (
31

P) has 100% natural abundance (
31

P, I=1/2), a 

broad chemical shift range (?? &gt; 650 ppm)
42

 and a large gyromagnetic ratio. The intrinsic 

properties from 
31

P make these probes more desirable than those using that use 
13

C and 
15

N 

NMR.
54

 Two main types of phosphorous containing probes have been used to investigate 

zeolites acidity (Figure 7), trimethylphosphine (TMP) and trialkylphosphine oxides 

(R3PO), being trimethylphosphine oxide (TMPO) the most extensively used, among R3POs 

probes, to investigate not only in zeolites but in solid acids in general.

16 

 

 

Figure 7 - Molecular structure of a) trimethylphosphine and b) trialkylphosphine oxides, where 

R represent an alkyl chain that can have different sizes and shapes. 

Different complexes are formed depending on the type of interaction between 

TMP/TMPO and the acid site (Figure 8),
57

 that can easily lead to the identification of the 

acid type and strength. The interaction of TMP molecules with Lewis acid sites gives rise 

to a broad chemical shift range, between -20 and -60 ppm, thus allowing the determination 

of the relative acidic strength for Lewis acid sites. On the other hand, when adsorbed onto 

Brønsted acid sites (Figure 8B), TMP forms protonated complexes (TMPH
+
) that have a 

narrow chemical shift range, between -2 and -5 ppm, making the identification of Brønsted 

acid strength quite difficult.
24

  

 

Figure 8 - Representation of the interaction between phosphorous-containing probes and acid 

sites a) physisorbed at Brønsted acid site, b) chemisorbed at Brønsted acid site and c) 

chemisorbed at Lewis acid site. 

Although TMP allows an easy identification of the acid type and can distinguish 

between subtle differences in the Lewis acid strength, R3PO probes can differentiate 

between Brønsted and Lewis acid sites and also obtain information about the Brønsted 

acidity strength and the distribution of these acid sites.
42

 In addition, TMP molecules are 

oxidized when exposed to air, making the sample preparation more difficult.
58

 For these 



17 

 

reasons, the following discussion focus on the use of R3PO as probes, more specifically in 

the use of TMPO. 

 

2.3.1.1. Identification of Acid Types 

In the literature is mentioned that TMPO-loaded zeolites have two distinct regions 

in the 
31

P MAS NMR spectrum that can be assigned to the interaction of TMPO either with 

Lewis (ca. 50 ppm) or Brønsted (above 55 ppm) acid sites.
59

 Most of the times, the 

identification of the acid type using TMPO, or other R3PO probes, require sample 

manipulation and two different experiments. The interaction of TMPO with Brønsted acid 

sites, via strong hydrogen bonds, forms TMPOH
+
 complexes that spread along the 

31
P 

NMR spectra according to the acid site strength. On the other hand, the weaker interaction 

between TMPO and the Lewis acid sites can be easily dissociated when exposed to air 

humidity,
60

 where the TMPO molecules are replaced with one water molecules, forming 

weak Brønsted acid sites.
42

 Therefore, peaks related to Lewis acid sites tend to decrease in 

intensity after the sample being exposed to air humidity (Figure 9), thus allowing the 

identification of acid types. 

 

Figure 9 - 
31

P MAS NMR spectra of a TMPO-loaded HZSM-5 zeolite, before (red) and after 

(blue) being exposed to air humidity. 



18 

 

Even though this method allows the differentiation between Lewis and Brønsted 

acid sites, new methods that do not require sample manipulation are preferred. Huang et at. 

used a Lee-Goldburg Cross-polarization (LG-CP) experiment combined with a selective 

pulse targeted to non-acidic protons to remove their effect on CP.
61

 With this experiment 

the authors achieved a selective detection of the desired acid sites in an HY zeolite loaded 

with TMPO. The use of more advanced SSNMR techniques, for example, 2D experiments, 

show a great potential to investigate acidic properties in these systems. 

 

2.3.1.2. Investigate Acidic Strength 

Phosphine oxide molecules, which have a hydrogen bond acceptor (oxygen), can 

interact with the acidic groups, forming different TMPOH
+
 complexes. Slight variations in 

this complexes result in electron density changes around the phosphorous nucleus, thus 

shifting the peaks in the 
31

P spectrum.
62,63

 Stronger Brønsted acid sites give rise to stronger 

hydrogens bond in these complexes and usually yield resonances at higher 
31

P chemical 

shifts.
38

 A theoretical study confirmed the correlation between the interaction of TMPO 

with stronger Brønsted acid sites and the 
31

P resonances at higher chemical shifts,
64

 

suggesting a linear correlation between the 
31

P isotropic chemical shift and the acidic 

strength. In solid acids, the deprotonation energy (DPE) and proton affinity (PA), are 

widely used as a measure of the acid strength. 

 

?P   2. 666( 5.   )-0.  02( 0.020) P   ( 8 ) 

In contrast to what happens with Brønsted acid sites,  TMP is superior to TMPO for 

determinating Lewis acid strength.
24

 To the best of my knowledge, there is no study in 

zeolites, that correlate the probe chemical shift to the Lewis acid site strength. However, a 

theoretical study was able to correlate the Lewis acidic strength to the probe chemical shift, 

in Lewis acid sites models with different metal atoms.
57

 This study presents a linear 

correlation between the 
31

P chemical shift and the binding energy (BE) of TMP complexes 

with different Lewis acids. Qualitative information about the Lewis acidic strength can be 

obtained from this correlation, higher BEs values correspond to stronger Lewis acid site, 

hence a higher 
31

P chemical shift. 

 



19 

 

2.3.1.3. Investigate Distribution of Acid Sites 

Several studies showed that quantitative information about the distribution and 

concentration of acid sites can be obtained by choosing the proper R3PO probe 

molecule.
63,65

 Zhao et al. used TMPO and TBPO to investigate the distribution of acid 

sites.
63

 The smaller kinetic diameter (KD) of TMPO (0.55 nm), that is comparable to the 

size of a 10-membered ring of a ZSM-5 zeolite, and therefore it is capable to access inside 

these pores.
42

 On the other hand, TBPO has a larger KD (0.82 nm), so it is not capable to 

penetrate in the 10-membered ring and access the smaller channels. Since TBPO is too 

bulky to enter the 10-member rings of ZSM-5, the molecules can only interact with 

external acid sites, whereas the smaller TMPO molecules can interact both with the 

external and internal acid sites. Hence, information about the location of the zeolite sites 

can be readily accessible using this approach. 

A typical spectrum from a TMPO-loaded ZSM-5 shows five peaks at 86, 75, 67, 63 

and 53 ppm associated to Brønsted acid sites with different acid strengths.
38,63

 On the other 

hand, the 
31

P NMR spectrum from TBPO adsorbed on an HZSM-5 shows only three 

resonance peaks associated with Brønsted acidity, at 92, 75 and 71 ppm.
63

 One downside 

of this approach is that TBPO and TMPO show resonances at different chemical shifts for 

the interaction in the same acid site. This offset reflects differences in the strength of the 

hydrogen bond between the acidic hydrogen and the probe oxygen.
24

 Wiper et at. 

suggested an alternative using only TMPO to probe external and internal acid site.
60

 In this 

approach an as-synthesized zeolite (before being calcinated), that has the internal surface 

occupied with template molecules is loaded with TMPO, leaving only the external sites 

accessible to TMPO adsorption. 

Another crucial acid site feature, that can have a large influence on the catalytic 

performance, is the distance between acid sites. Grey et al used diphenyldiphosphines 

(Ph2P(CH2)nPPh2 (n = 1, 3 and 6) as probes to investigate the distance between acid sites, 

using 2D double quantum-single quantum (DQ-SQ) NMR.
66

 Using this approach the 

authors were able to probe the proximity of several acid sites.

2.4. Acidity characterization using Computational Methods 

Nowadays, modelling methods are well established and are an essential tool for 

researchers in the study of different types of compounds, materials, reactions and 

spectroscopy. Combining computational and experimental results can be quite useful in the 

study of materials with complex structures and properties. Several computational studies 

about the structure, properties and reactions of zeolites using molecular mechanics and 

dynamics have been done in the past. However, the evolution of computational resources 

and efficiency allowed the use of methods with heavier demands on computer power, such 

as ab initio and semi-empirical calculations.
67–70

 

Quantum mechanics calculations should arise from the result of Schrödinger 

equation; however, no analytical result has been accepted as a solution of this equation for 

a many-electrons system. Since most of the systems used in quantum chemistry 

calculations are multi-electrons systems, some approximations to obtain a result from 

Schrödinger equation are required. Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation,
71,72

 assumes that 

many-electrons systems can be represented as a determinant from the single-electron 

wavefunction from each electron. This approximation, look at electrons as individual 

identities, ignoring the interaction between electrons, which may result in significant 

errors. Post-HF methods such as Møller-Plesset (e.g. MP2 and MP4),
73,74

 are used to 

overcome some limitations from HF calculation. These methods have some corrections to 

HF model, usually introducing electron-electron interactions, that lead to very time 

expensive calculations. 

Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods were developed to overcome some 

limitations of HF method and minimize the computational demand from post-HF methods. 

Unlike wavefunction-based methods where the system representation depends on three 

spatial variables for each electron, DFT calculations take a simpler approach by replacing 

the system wavefunction with an electronic density distribution.
75

 Besides being able to 

decrease the computational demand, this modification can also indirectly introduce 

electron correlations, ignored in simpler approaches. 

A common approach to modulate zeolites acidity uses clusters that mimic a 

Bronsted acid site, instead of using all the zeolite structure.
76–78

 Although some properties 

from the zeolite can be better estimated using periodic boundary calculations (PBC), for 

local properties, such as the zeolite acidity, it is convenient to use the cluster approach, 



21 

 

which can simplify the calculations. In general, it is required a model with at least 8 

tetrahedral (8T) units to obtain an accurate description of the acidic site.
79

 Figure 10 shows 

one 8T and one 49T model that can be used to investigate properties from HZSM-5. Most 

of the times, these models are extracted from crystallographic structures and to preserve 

the structure, that largely influences the properties of the material, the terminal atoms are 

fixed along their crystallographic direction, preserving structural integrity. The cluster 

approach has been successfully applied to investigate the interaction between probe 

molecules and the acid sites.

zeolites acidity and other properties.

3. Materials and Methods 

3.1. Materials 

3.1.1. Zeolites Preparation 

ZSM-5 was synthesized hydrothermally. Sodium aluminate was used as Al source, 

while TEOS or Ludox HS-30 were used as silicon source. Tetrapropyl-ammonium (TPA
+
) 

or n-butylamine (BTA) were used as templates. ZSM-5 samples were done as follow. 0.10 

g of sodium aluminate (54 m/m % Al2O3, 41 m/m % Na2O), 0.68 g of NaF and 0.68 g of 

tetrapropylamine bromide (TPABr, 98 wt%, Aldrich) were dissolved in 16.87 mL of H2O. 

Then 3.13 g of tetrapropylamine hydroxide solution (1 M TPAOH in H2O, Aldrich) was 

added to above solution. Finally, the mixture of 6.47 g of tetraethylorthosilicate (98 wt%, 

Aldrich) and 5.62 g of ethanol was added. The resulting precursor was agitated in a 

covered container for 4 hours and then treated at 180ºC for 3 days without agitation. The 

BTA-ZSM-5 was done as follow. 0.25 g of sodium aluminate and 0.75 g of NaOH were 

dissolved in 63.5 mL of H2O. Then 19.80 g of Ludox HS-30 (30 wt% SiO2) was added to 

above solution with agitation. After 15 minutes, 2.94 g of n-butylamine (BTA) was added. 

The resulting precursor was agitated for 60 minutes and then treated at 180ºC for 4 days 

without agitation.  

The removal of the organic template was carried out at 550ºC 8 h for TPA
+
 samples 

(MFI8 and MFI20), or 700ºC 2 h for BTA sample (MFI64). Ion exchange was carried out 

at ambient temperature. The pre-calcined samples were mixed with 0.17 M (NH4)2SO4 

solution (solution to solid ratio is ca. 40) for proper time, after washing and drying, the 

resulting powder was calcined at 350ºC for 5 h to get H-form products. NH4ZSM-5 and 

NaZSM-5 were prepared by dispersing 0.19 g of calcined ZSM-5 into 10 mL H2O with 

0.11 g of (NH4)2SO4 (or 0.24 g of Na2SO4) at ambient temperature. The Si/Al ratios of all 

studied samples range from 19 to 20, these ratios were obtained using Inductively Coupled 

Plasma (ICP) prior to the NMR analysis. All the samples used in this thesis were 

synthesized by Dr. Zhi Lin.

the ZSM-5 samples used in this work; NP – samples synthesized without template. 

 

 

3.1.2. Zeolites Dehydration 

Around 3,5 g of a zeolite sample was placed in a quartz Schlenk and heated in a 

tubular hoven to 380 °C for 3 hours at a rate of 1 °C per minute under vacuum. After 

cooling down the sample to room temperature the Schlenk tube was sealed and transferred 

immediately to an Ar glove box. The sample was then packed into a MAS rotor and stored 

in the Ar box until needed to the NMR experiments. 

1
H MAS NMR experiments require fully dehydrated samples, for this experiment 

the unloaded samples were placed inside an in-situ MAS rotor loading apparatus (Figure 

11) and degassed in a vacuum line at 10
-2

 Pa and 300 °C for 6 hours.

3.1.3. TMPO Adsorption 

TMPO is often dissolved in a solvent (e.g CH2Cl2) and then adsorbed into the 

materials. However, this procedure can lead to the adsorption of solvent molecules and a 

gas phase adsorption protocol was adapted (Figure 12).
84

 In a typical procedure, 0.3 g of 

TMPO were weighed and transferred to a quartz Schlenk, inside an Ar glove box. After 

being completely sealed the Schlenk is placed in a vacuum line and the samples are dried 

for 2 hours at room temperature. A dried zeolite sample was placed under N2 atmosphere 

and the dried TMPO was transferred to the same Schleck. The mixture was heated in a 

tubular oven to 150 °C for 3.5 hours at a rate of 3 °C per minute, where the last 30 minutes 

were under vacuum. The loaded material was left to cool down to room temperature and 

immediately transferred to the Ar glove box where it was packed into a MAS rotor and 

stored until needed.

experiments performed at B0 = 9.4 T were recorded on a triple-resonance 4 mm Bruker 

MAS probe and at B0= 16.4 T on a triple-resonance 2.5 mm Bruker MAS probe. The 

samples were packed into ZrO2 rotors with Kel-F (4 mm) or Vespel (2.5 mm) caps in the 

B0 fields of 9.4 and 16.4 T, respectively. Spinning rates between 12 and 35 kHz were 

employed to record all the spectra. Chemical shifts are quoted in ppm using the following 

secondary references: solid adamantane (1.85 ppm), aqueous solution of Al(NO3)3 (0 

ppm), solid Q8M8 (-109.68 ppm for the furthest upfield resonance) and solid Na4P2O7 (-

3.2.1.1. Single Pulse Experiments 

1
H single-pulse MAS NMR spectra were acquired at a spinning rate of 15 kHz 

using a 2.   s pulse ( 0°  lip-angle) that corresponds to a radio frequency (rf) field strength 

of ca. 89 kHz. A recycle delay (RD) of 2 s was found to be sufficient and used for all 

samples. 
27

Al single-pulse MAS NMR spectra were acquired at a spinning rate of 14 kHz 

using a quantification pulse of ca. 0. 6  s ( 0°  lip angle) corresponding to a r   ield 

strength of 77 kHz. A RD of 2 s was used. 
29

Si single-pulse MAS NMR spectra were 

acquired at a spinning rate o   2 k   using a 2.6  s pulse ( 0°  lip angle) that corresponds 

to a rf field strength of ca. 42 kHz. A RD of 60 s was used. 
31

P single-pulse excitation 

M S NMR spectra were acquired at a spinning rate o   5 k   using a  .2  s pulse ( 0°

3.2.1.2. Cross-polarization Experiments 

29
Si CPMAS spectra were acquired using a 

1
  2.6  s pulse width ( 0º  lip angle) 

corresponding to a rf field strength of ca. 96 kHz; the CP step was performed using a 

contact time ( T) o   000  s with a 70? 00% R MP shape at the 
1
H channel and a square 

shape pulse of 42 kHz on the 
29

3.2.2. Computational Calculations 

3.2.2.1. Deprotonation Energy Calculations 

The orthorhombic unit cell of a pure silica ZSM-5 has 96 tetrahedral sites (T) and 

12 inequivalent T sites.
86

 Although the distribution of aluminum and the counter balance 

proton remains under discussion, several reports point as preferential sites those in the 

interception between the straight and zig-zag channels of ZSM-5 (Figure 13).
87–89

 

Most of the theoretical studies that investigate the acidity from HZSM-5 clusters 

use the T12 site, according to the numbering of Olson et al.,
90

 as a preferential T site for 

aluminum substitution.
91–93

 The incorporation of one Al atom in the T12 site gives rise to 

four possible centers (C1, C2, C3 and C4) that differ in the location of the counterion (H
+
) 

in neighbor oxygen atoms (O11, O12, O20, O24). 

 

Figure 13 - Representation of ZSM-5 straight channels (left) and zig-zag channels (right. The 

centers C1 (Si8O8Al12), C2 (Si11O11Al12), C3 (Si20O20Al12) and C4 (Si24O24Al12) are 

represented as balls and sticks. 

In solid-state systems, the deprotonation energy (DPE) is often used in theoretical 

studies as measure of Brønsted acidity strength and reflects the energy required to remove 

a proton from the zeolite cluster. DPE can be calculated using Equation 9 where E ZH is the 



29 

 

energy obtained for the protonated cluster and EZ the energy obtained for the unprotonated 

cluster (negatively charged).
94

 

            ( 9 ) 

 

Four 8T clusters, obtained from the crystallographic structure of ZSM-5,
95

 were 

used to investigate the possible Brønsted acid sites and their DPE. The terminal silicon 

atoms were saturated with hydrogen atoms and these terminal groups ( -SiH3) were fixed in 

their crystallographic position to mimic the zeolite structure. In order to find the better 

method to optimize the structure and calculate DPE (best accuracy/calculation demand 

ratio), some widely used DFT functionals, Perdew-Wang 1991 (PW91PW91),
96

 Becke 

Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP),
97,98

 and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE1PBE),
99

 combined with 

the 6-31G(d,p) basis set,
100

 were tested and compared to the more time-consuming method 

MP2. All the calculations were performed using Gaussian 09 Rev. B.01.
101

 

 

3.2.2.2. Calculation of TMPO Adsorption 

In this work, computational calculations followed the methodology used by Z heng 

et al., that uses small clusters with a range of acidic strengths to investigate the adsorption 

of TMPO.
64

 A 8T clusters, mentioned in the section 3.2.2.1, was chosen to investigate th e 

interaction with TMPO. Figure 14 shows the cluster used in our calculations, that was 

chosen among the four possibilities because the acidic proton is placed at the straight 

channel and near the interception with a zig-zag channel. 



30 

 

 

Figure 14 - Representation of two TMPO-loaded ZSM-5 clusters with different Si-H bond 

lengths used in this work, before geometry optimization. 

Kramer et al. found that the acidic strength in a cluster can be tuned by changing 

the length from the cluster terminal Si-H bonds.
102

 In this study, the same methodology 

was used to investigate the interaction between TMPO and the clusters with different 

acidic strengths. The central part from the bare clusters (O3-Si-O(H)-Al-O3) was allowed to 

relax while the terminal -SiH3 groups were fixed in the crystallographic direction and with 

Si-H bond lengths between 1.30 and 2.75 angstroms (Å).  

After geometry optimization, one TMPO molecules was placed at 1.0 Å from the 

acidic proton from each cluster, and the loaded clusters were allowed to relax while 

keeping the terminal groups fixed at the same positions as in the first geometry 

optimization. Zheng et al. used a PW91PW91/6-31G(d,p) method to investigate the 

properties from these loaded clusters.
64

 In this study, two additional combinations of two 

widely used DFT functionals, B3LYP and PBE1PBE, with the same basis set were tested 

instead, to compare the results to those reproduced from the published methodology.
64

 

 

3.2.2.3. Modelling 
31

P NMR 

Several theoretical studies used the cluster approach to investigate the interaction of 

molecules with the acid site from zeolites and obtain NMR data, providing additional 

information to the experimental results.
64,103

 Zheng et al. propose a superacidity threshold 



31 

 

for TMPO-loaded zeolites that can be observed from  
31

P MAS NMR spectra.
64

 The 

optimized structures for the TMPO-loaded zeolites, mentioned in the previous section, 

were used to predict  
31

P chemical shifts. 

Most of the times the NMR calculation step have lower computational demand than 

the geometry optimization, hence this type of calculations used a basis set with moderate 

size for the geometry optimization step and a larger one for the chemical shielding 

calculation. Zheng et al. used the combination HF/TZVP//PW91PW91/6 -31G(d,p) 

(Chemical shifts//Geometry Optimization) to obtain theoretical NMR parameters for the 

TMPO-loaded cluster.
64

 In this study, the same combination was applied in order to 

replicate these published results and other combinations were tested. 

NMR calculations require the use of a reference to obtain the chemical shift; in this 

work we have used two references: TMPO (41 ppm) and H3PO4 (0 ppm). In this study, the 

NMR calculations were performed using the gauge including atomic orbital (GIAO) 

method,
104,105

 as implemented in Gaussian 09 Rev. B.01..
101

 The chemical shifts were 

obtained by using two references, TMPO (41 ppm) and H3PO4 (0 ppm). The chemical shift 

for a given nucleus X (?X) can be obtained with Equation 10,
106

 where ?ref and ?X are the 

absolute chemical shielding obtained from the calculation of the reference compound 

and the nucleus X, respectively, and ?ref stands for the experimental chemical shift. 

Both the reference and the molecule shielding should be calculated using the same 

combination (NMR and geometry optimization).

4. Results and Discussion 

4.1. Solid-state NMR Results 

4.1.1. Characterization of Silicon Environments 

Silicon is one of most abundant elements on the zeolite structure, however, the low 

natural abundance of the NMR active isotope and the narrow chemical shift range from 

silicon atoms onto the zeolitic framework, make the identification of acid sites using 
29

Si 

MAS NMR very difficult. Usually, the 
29

Si MAS NMR spectrum from zeolites is used to 

estimate the Si/Al ratio, however, all the samples used in this study have ratios ca. 20, 

obtained by ICP analysis, thus the Si/Al ratio for these samples can not be obtained from 

the 
29

Si MAS NMR spectra using Equation 7. 

 

Figure 15 - 
29

Si MAS NMR spectra (A and B) and 
29

Si CPMAS NMR (C and D) spectra of 

29
Si-enriched MFI20 sample before (A and B) and after (C and D) TMPO adsorption. 



34 

 

Figure 15 shows the 
29

Si MAS NMR and 
29

Si CPMAS NMR spectra from the 

sample MFI20 (a sodic sample NaZSM-5) before and after adsorption of TMPO probe 

molecules. The spectra show two regions with intense peaks between -108 and -120 ppm, 

with two major 
29

Si resonances around -112 and -115 ppm, and a less intense region 

between -97 and -108 ppm, showing a broad distribution of different silicon sites. As 

shown in the spectra, an additional resonance at ca. 98 ppm appears in the 
29

Si CPMAS 

NMR spectrum (Figure 15D) from the loaded zeolite that should arise from the interaction 

of a TMPO molecule with a Si(1Al) site (Brønsted acid site). This peak is enhanced in the 

CPMAS experiment because the large number of hydrogens from TMPO molecule can 

transfer magnetization to the near silicon atom.  

 Since the 
29

Si MAS NMR spectra of zeolites have a narrow chemical shift range, it 

can be a challenge to assign all the Si(nAl) species, especially in materials with higher 

Si/Al ratios, where the Si(0Al) is predominant. A 2D 
1
H-

29
Si CP-HETCOR NMR 

experiment was performed to assign the Si(nAl) sites. The TMPO-loaded sample was used 

in this experiment to take advantage from the large number of protons in the probe methyl 

groups, that act as an “antenna” that trans er polari ation to the near silicon atoms, via CP. 

The 2D 
1
H-

29
Si CP-HETCOR of the unloaded sample has not afforded enough sensitivity 

to obtain a high-quality spectrum.  The 2D 
1
H-

29
Si CP-HETCOR spectrum (Figure 16) 

shows a broad 
29

Si resonance containing multiple Si(0Al) sites (between -101 and -118 

ppm),
107

 which correlates with the 
1
H resonance at ca. 2.2 ppm, associated with terminal 

silanol protons (Si-OH).
108

 On the other hand, the 
29

Si resonance at -98.7 ppm correlates 

with protons at 4.8 ppm; a typical 
1
H resonance (4.3 ppm) for acidic bridging hydroxyls in 

ZSM-5,
108

 therefore the 
29

Si peak can be assigned to Si(1Al) sites. Since the 2D 
1
H-

29
Si 

CP-HETCOR spectrum of Figure 16 refers to a NaZSM-5 sample, the number of bridging 

hydroxyls is residual; an HZSM-5 zeolite, that has a larger number of acidic protons, 

would have given a stronger 
1
H-

29
Si correlation between this spin pair.

29

correlations of Si(0Al) groups with silanol protons and of Si(1Al) groups and bridging 

hydroxyl protons. 

4.1.2. Characterization of FAL and EFAL species 

27
Al MAS NMR experiments from unloaded zeolites can provide information about 

the type and geometry of the aluminum species, thus allowing the identification of acid 

types. Generally, these spectra have typically three main chemical shift regions around 50, 

30 and 0 ppm, corresponding to tetrahedral framework aluminum (FAL), distorted 

tetrahedra or pentacoordinate EFAL and octahedral EFAL species, respectively.
21

 

However, the low symmetry of EFAL species leads to stronger quadrupolar environments, 

which broadens the 
27

Al NMR signal precluding its observation. These species are often 

known as “invisible” aluminum species,
49

 thus making the identification of Lewis acid 

sites harder. When exposed to humidity, the EFAL species coordinate to the water 

molecules that increase their symmetry giving narrower 
27

Al resonance.
49

 

Over the course of this work, several zeolite samples were prepared with different 

properties to better exploit SSNMR experiments in the study of acid species. The different 

samples prepared are listed in Table 3, which shows what chemical information was 



36 

 

obtained by specific SSNMR methods.  For example, different templates or/and 

counterions were employed. Although many different templates (Figure S1 and S2) were 

used to synthesize HZSM-5 (Table 3), the main focus will be on TPA
+
 and BTA templates. 

The 
27

Al MAS NMR spectra of  MFI64 (BTA) and MFI8 (TPA
+
) zeolite samples (Figure 

17) show a common resonance at around 55 ppm while the 
27

Al spectrum of the former 

sample shows a peak at 0 ppm, generally assigned to FAL and EFAL species,
21,51

 

respectively. 

 

 

Figure 17 - 
27

Al MAS NMR spectra of hydrated ZSM-5 zeolites: dealuminated sample MFI64 

(red) and sample MFI8 (blue). 

The distinct structure of the template molecules (Figure S2) seems to have an 

influence on the type of acids formed in the zeolite samples. Thermogravimetric analysis 

(TGA) results, from several ZSM-5 samples synthesized with different templates, showed 

that the calcination temperature (temperature required to fully remove the template), 

depends on the chosen template (Figure S1). The analysis from TGA results shows that 

ZSM-5 zeolites synthesized with TPA
+
 template require a temperature of 500 ºC, while 

those synthesized with BTA template require a higher temperature of 700 ºC, to fully 



37 

 

remove the template. Other templates such as ETA, IPA and DEA also required higher 

calcination temperatures. In order to increase the amount of EFAL species, the HZSM-5 

sample synthesized with BTA template was subjected to two additional dealumination 

treatments with acetylacetone and a strong solution of HCl (more details in Appendix F). 

The 
27

Al MAS NMR spectra showed no increase of the 6-coordinated Al site (ca. 0 ppm) 

for the sample treated with acetylacetone and a slight increase for the sample treated with 

at strong acidic conditions, meaning that either the acidic treatment removes a small 

amount o  F L atoms or most o  the EF L generated with this treatment are “invisible 

aluminum” species, even when the samples are hydrated (Figure S12). Usually, ZSM-5 

zeolites are quite resistant to dealumination treatments and require strong treatments to 

obtain a large amount EFAL species.

4.1.3. Characterization of Acid Sites using 
1
H MAS NMR 

As mentioned before, 
1
H MAS NMR limitations make it hard to get detailed 

information about the acidic feature of zeolites acid sites. Nonetheless, 
1
H MAS NMR 

measurements have been intensively used in the past to investigate zeolites acidity,
39,108,110–

112
 giving good preliminary information. In this work, one HZSM-5 sample (MFI8) was 

used to investigate zeolites acidity using 
1
H MAS NMR experiments. 

The spectrum from the HZSM-5 zeolite (Figure 18) shows four main resonances 

centered at 1.4, 1.9, 4.1 and 6.4 ppm. As expected, the spectrum shows multiple resonances 

between 1 and 2 ppm, corresponding to non-acidic protons from silanol groups (Si-OH)  at 

the external surface or from framework defects.
41

 Strongly acidic protons appear in the 
1
H 

MAS NMR spectrum of well-dehydrated HZSM-5 typically at 4.3 ppm, which is assigned 

to the bridging hydroxyl group (Si-O(H)-Al), whereas a broader 
1
H resonance at 6.4 ppm 

arises from disturbed bridging hydroxyl groups interacting with neighbor oxygen atoms.
39

 

The 
1
H MAS NMR spectra of the HZSM-5 sample (MFI8) dehydrated at distinct 

conditions showed significant differences (Figure S5). In this work, only the stronger 

dehydration procedure (300 °C for 6h at 10
-2

 Pa) gives rise to the typical 
1
H MAS NMR 

spectrum of a dehydrated HZSM-5 zeolite (Figure 18). In contrast, the 
1
H MAS NMR 

spectra of the HZSM-5 dehydrated with weaker conditions (Figure S5), show a downfield 

shift for the 
1
H resonance, resulting for the rapid exchange between the water protons and 

both the silanol and Brønsted sites protons.

The dashed red curve corresponds to the simulated spectra and the black curves to either 

Lorentzian or a combination of Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. 

Even though several studies used phosphorous probes to investigate zeolites 

acidity, very few reports of 
1
H MAS NMR spectra of TMPO-loaded zeolites can be found 

in the literature.
61

 In this work, the 
1
H MAS NMR spectrum from the TMPO-loaded MFI8 

sample (Figure 19) is used to observe the differences before and after the adsorption of 

TMPO and obtain information that can help in the interpretation of results from the 2D 
1
H-

31
P HETCOR experiments (section 4.1.4.3). The results from Gaussian peaks 

deconvolution revealed five major resonances at 1.8, 1.7, 1.5, 1.4 and 1.3 that arise from 

TMPO methyl groups in distinct chemical environments. The 
1
H chemical shifts at 13.0, 

8.1, 6.8 and 6.0 ppm (Figure 18) are tentatively assigned to 
1
H environments with different 

acid strengths interacting with TMPO. It is important to point that the resonance at 4.3 ppm 

from the TMPO-unloaded zeolite vanished, indicating that all bridging hydroxyls are 

interacting with TMPO molecules.

4.1.4. Characterization of Acid Sites using 
31

P MAS NMR 

Even though TMPO probe molecules have unique characteristics that allow the 

identification of several acidic features from both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, some of 

the assignments found in the literature remain somewhat controversial.
63

 In order to 

address this problem, a combination of materials with different features were prepared and 

loaded with TMPO (Figure 20). As mentioned before, aluminum atoms act as a source of 

acidity in zeolites, both Brønsted and Lewis. In principle, if we can replace, at least, all 

protons from bridging hydroxyls with other non-acidic counterions (e.g. Na
+
 and K

+
), it 

would be possible to remove all the Brønsted acid centers. Usually, zeolites have a low 

amount of Lewis acid centers, that can be enhanced by dealuminating zeolites, a process 

that generates EFAL species by expelling FAL species.

4.1.4.1. One dimensional experiments 

Despite the efforts of several authors, the assignments of 
31

P environments in 

TMPO-loaded zeolites remain to some extent controversial.
42,63,113

 The approach used in 

this work tries to provide additional data about 
31

P MAS NMR spectra of TMPO loaded 

zeolites, using ZSM-5 zeolites with different acidic features. Figure 21 displays the 
31

P 

CPMAS NMR spectra of MFI20 (A; NaZSM-5), MFI8 (B; HZSM-5) and MFI64 (C; 

dealuminated HZSM-5) samples. The 
31

P CPMAS NMR spectrum shows from the 

NaZSM-5 sample shows no 
31

P resonance higher than 60 ppm, which usually indicate the 

absence of Brønsted acid sites.
24,42

 On the other hand, both the 
31

P CPMAS NMR spectra 

of HZSM-5 and the dealuminated samples show resonances higher than 60 ppm. Often this 

region, ?31P &gt; 60 ppm, is assigned to TMPO interacting with distinct strength Brønsted acid 



41 

 

sites, however, this work shows that the interaction of TMPO with Lewis acid sites might 

also generate species resonating at 
31

P chemical shifts higher than 60 ppm.

Eight 
31

P resonances around 54, 48, 43, 41, 37, 35, 30 and 29 ppm, can be 

identified in the deconvoluted 
31

P CPMAS
 
NMR spectrum for the TMPO-loaded MFI20 



42 

 

sample. Based on the results from Zhao et al., the resonance at ca. 29 ppm can be assigned 

to “mobile” TMPO weakly adsorbed on the channel opening or in the intercrystalline 

voids.
63

 Results presented in the next section (section 4.1.4.3) show that this resonance 

arises from TMPO interacting with the zeolite internal surface and not from the interaction 

in intercrystalline voids. The assignment from resonances around 36 ppm remains 

somewhat controversial. Hayashi et al. assigned this resonance to TMPO physisorbed into 

a small site of a silicalite sample (pure silica material analogue to ZSM-5),
114

 refuting the 

assignment made earlier by Rakiewicz et al.,
37

 that assigned the same resonance to an 

interaction between TMPO and a Lewis center. This resonance has considerable less 

relative intensity in the 
31

P NMR spectra from the MFI64 sample (Figure 21C), that have a 

larger amount o  EF L species than both MFI  and MFI20 samples, thus shouldn’t arise 

from TMPO interacting with a Lewis acid site. The resonance at 41 ppm can be easily 

assigned to crystalline TMPO (Figure S4) and the small shoulder at 43 ppm to physisorbed 

TMPO,
37,63

 this latter assignment was assigned with a triple resonance 
1
H/

31
P/

27
Al 

TRAPDOR, that revealed no correlation between this resonance with aluminium atoms.
37

 

Lang et al. also used TMPO to investigate Lewis acidity in several materials,
59

 founding a 

resonance around 48 ppm was consistent along the tested materials. Early reports from 
31

P 

MAS NMR of loaded amorphous silica-alumina samples assigned the peak at around 54 

ppm to TMPO interacting with Lewis centers,
115

 other studies suggested that this 

resonance arises from TMPO interacting with weak Brønsted acid sites.
37,63

 The 

assignment of these latter resonances (48 and 54 ppm) can be quite challenging using only 

1D 
31

P NMR experiments, thus additional 2D 
1
H-

31
P NMR experiments were performed, 

providing more information about these environments (section 4.1.4.4.).  

The 
31

P CPMAS
 
spectrum from the TMPO-loaded MFI8 sample loaded shows 

eight main resonances at 86, 76, 68, 65, 48, 43, 36, 28 ppm and two additional peaks at 75 

and 53 ppm were obtained from peak deconvolution using Gaussian curves (Figure 21B). 

This spectrum produces similar results to those reported by Zhao et al.,
37,63

 with two 

additional resonances around 68 and 36 ppm. As expected, this TMPO -loaded sample has 

31
P resonance at chemical shifts higher than 60 ppm, usually assigned to TMPO interacting 

with Brønsted acid sites with increasing strength, from 60 to 80 ppm.
24,42

 However, several 

results in this work show that the interaction of TMPO with Lewis acid sites might result in 

resonance in this spectral region. Furthermore, the 2D 
1
H-

31
P CP-HETCOR experiments 



43 

 

showed that the Brønsted acidic strength has no proportional correlation with the 
31

P 

chemical shift, detailed discussion in section 4.1.4.4. 

In order to investigate the influence EFAL species (Lewis acid sites) in the 
31

P 

NMR spectra of ZSM-5 zeolites, a dealuminated HZSM-5 zeolite was prepared (MFI64). 

Recently, Zhao et al. reported one 
31

P above 80 ppm that was assigned to TMPO 

interacting with a strong acid center, arising from a Brønsted/Lewis syner gic center.
116

 

Figure 21C shows the 
31

P CPMAS spectrum from the TMPO-loaded MFI64, showing a 

characteristic profile from a TMPO-loaded HZSM-5 sample with an additional peak at 93 

ppm. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first report of a 
31

P resonance higher than 86 

ppm, that was suggested as the threshold for superacidity in TMPO -loaded HZSM-5 

zeolites.
64

 Since this resonance appears only on a sample with a considerable amount of 

EFAL species (Figure 17), is expected that this resonance arises from TMPO interacting 

with these species. Usually, TMPO-loaded zeolites are exposed to humidity, because the 

TMPO interact weakly with Lewis acid sites and are replaced by water molecules, 

resulting in a significant decrease of 
31

P resonance associated with this interaction. Figure 

22 shows 
31

P CPMAS spectrum from the TMPO-loaded MFI64 sample before and after 

being exposed to air overnight. This procedure resulted in an overall decrease in intensity, 

being more evident for the resonance at 75 ppm that before air exposure is the more intense 

peak and after appears only as a shoulder from the resonance at 63 ppm. An important 

result from this experiment is that both resonances at 86 and 93 ppm disappeared 

completely upon sample hydration, which might indicate that these resonances are 

associated with TMPO interacting with Lewis centers. However, the large difference for 

the peak at 75 ppm, usually assigned to TMPO interacting with Brønsted sites, indicates 

that long periods of humidity exposure can affect also the stronger interaction between 

TMPO molecules and the Brønsted acid sites. Hence it is important to find new methods 

that can unambiguously identify the acidic centers that interact with TMPO molecules, like 

those presented in section 4.1.4.4.

4.1.4.3. Assessing Acid Sites Location 

An alternative approach that avoids the use of different molecular probes was used, 

in this work, to discriminate external and internal acid sites.
63

 This approach was suggested 

by Wiper et al.,
60

 and requires one as-synthesized sample and one calcinated sample. 

Before the calcination step the inside volume of a pore is totally occupied with template 

molecules, thus only the external sites are accessible to TMPO molecules. Using this 

approach, it is possible to discriminate internal from external acid sites. 

Figure 23 shows the deconvoluted 
31

P CPMAS spectrum from the as-synthesized 

ZSM-5 zeolite (MFI17), that exhibit that exhibits eight 
31

P resonance at ca. 60, 56, 50, 43, 

41, 37, 35 and ppm that can be assigned to TMPO interacting with the external surface of 

the zeolite. The resonances at 50, 43, 41 and 37 ppm dominate the 
31

P CPMAS NMR 

spectrum of the as-synthesized sample and can be assigned to TMPO interacting with the 



45 

 

external surface of the zeolite. Additional data obtained with this experiment indicates that 

the 
31

P resonances at 43 and 41 ppm previously assigned to physisorbed and crystalline 

TMPO, arise from TMPO at the external surface of the zeolite. Since the resonances at ca. 

60, 56 and 50 ppm only appear in the spectrum of the as-synthesized sample, these can be 

unambiguously assigned to TMPO at the external surface of the material.  

On the other hand, the 
31

P CPMAS NMR spectrum from the calcinated analogue 

material (MFI20, Figure 21B) shows additional peaks at 66, 54, 48 and 29 ppm that can be 

assigned to TMPO adsorbed into internal acid site. This spectrum shows one intense 

resonance at ca. 30 ppm that are faint in the 
31

P CPMAS NMR spectrum from the MFI17 

(material with occupied pores) zeolite, thus can be assigned to TMPO interacting with an 

internal site. In their work, Wiper et al. mentioned that the template molecules leave some 

empty space near the pore opening, allowing the interaction of TMPO molecules with  

some internal acid sites.

and a dealuminated HZSM-5 (Figure 25B) samples. As expected, the most intense cross-

peak in all 2D spectra is the correlation between methyl protons from TMPO, around 1 and 

2 ppm, and the phosphorous nucleus.

47 

 

The results from the 
31

P CPMAS NMR spectrum (Figure 23) from the as-

synthesized sample (blocked pores) revealed the 
31

P resonances that can be assigned to 

TMPO interacting with external sites. However, no information about the specific protons 

involved in the 
1
 ?

31
P polarization can be obtained from the 1D spectrum and therefore 

2D 
1
H-

31
P CP-HETCOR experiments on the pore blocked ZSM-5 were performed. Figure 

24A shows 
31

P resonances at ca. 43 and 37 exhibiting correlations with 
1
H resonances at 

ca. 10.0 and 8.6 ppm, respectively, while the broad 
31

P resonance at 49 ppm correlates with 

protons resonating around 7 ppm. These extremely faint resonances (the external sur face is 

much lower than the internal one) should arise from TMPO near either weak acidic 

protons, such as terminal Si-OH or near template molecules (more detailed discussion 

below). In addition, a faint cross-peak appearing at a 
1
H chemical shift of ca. 14 ppm is 

also correlated with 
31

P resonances at ca. 48, 42 and 39 ppm, which may arise from TMPO 

interacting with Bronsted acid sites as a higher 
1
H deshielding usually reveal the presence 

of stronger acid sites. 

On the other hand, the 2D 
1
H-

31
P CP-HETCOR NMR spectrum of the TMPO-

loaded NaZSM-5 (empty pore) is similar to the 
1
H-

31
P CP-HETCOR spectrum of the pore 

blocked zeolite, except for the resonances at ca. 54 and 29 ppm, that have a significant 

increase in intensity when the template is removed, thus corresponding to internal sites. 

The 31P resonance at ca. show no correlation with a 
1
H environment and thus can be 

assigned to TMPO interacting with a Lewis center. The 
31

P resonances observed in Figure 

24B are likely associated with TMPO interacting at the external surface of the material, 

except for resonances at ca. 29 and 54 ppm.  

The 2D 
1
H-

31
P CP-HETCOR spectrum of a NaZSM-5 zeolite synthesized without 

template (ALM40, Figure S6) shows no 
31

P-
1
H cross peaks ranging from 5 to 11 ppm, in 

contrast to the analogue MFI20 sample. Other zeolites synthesized without template, 

ALM40H (Figure S7) and ALM39H (Figure S8), showed fewer cross peaks, in the 

mentioned range, then the analogue HZSM-5 materials synthesized with template (Figure 

25, S10 and S11). It is possible that the cross peaks in this range arise from TMPO 

interacting with template molecules, however, additional data is required to unambiguously 

assign these peaks.

(dealuminated) samples. This figure shows clearly that when a NaZSM-5 zeolite (Figure

1
H-

31
P CP-HETCOR NMR spectra shows a new set of 

31
P resonances appearing above 60 

ppm associated to Brønsted acidity as shown previously.  Several papers state that, in these 

systems, Brønsted acidity strength is directly correlated with the 
31

P chemical shift and that 

31
P resonances in the ranges of 90-80, 80-70 and 70-60 ppm arise from TMPO interacting 



49 

 

with very strong, strong and weak Brønsted acid sites, respectively.
117

 The 2D 
1
H-

31
P CP-

HETCOR NMR spectrum of MFI8 sample (Figure 25A) exhibits a strongly distributed 

cross-peak covering a range of highly deshielded 
1
H chemical shifts (ca. 12 to 17 ppm) that 

correlate with various 
31

P resonances higher than 60 ppm revealing the proximity between 

TMPO molecules and strong acid centers. It is generally accepted in the literature that 

higher 
31

P and 
1
H chemical shifts are associated to stronger Brønsted acid sites. Analyzing 

the 2D spectra of Figure 25 this is not the case, i.e., we observe that as 
31

P chemical shifts 

are increasing within the  rønsted region (?P &gt; 60 ppm) the 
1
H chemical shifts are 

decreasing. For example, the most deshielded 
31

P resonance at 87 ppm is correlated with a 

1
H resonance ca. 8 ppm while a cross peak between a 

31
P resonance at ca. 48 ppm and a 

1
H 

resonance at ca. 14 ppm. The 2D spectrum reveals correlations between 
31

P resonances 

outside the region of stronger Brønsted sites (?P  &amp;lt;60 ppm) and highly acidic protons. In 

addition, the resonance at 86 ppm, that has been pointed out as the threshold to 

superacidity,
64

 shows no correlation in the 2D  HETCOR spectrum, indicating that this 

resonance can be assigned to TMPO interacting with a Lewis acid center. In fact, only a 

minor shoulder at 87 ppm exhibits a correlation with an intermediate strength Brønsted 

acid site (8 ppm). These new results also reveal the presence of two 
31

P resonances at 86 

and 87 ppm indicating that the former arises from the interaction of TMPO with a strong 

Lewis acid site, while the latter resonance could be associated to an interaction of TMPO 

with a synergic Brønsted/Lewis center.
116

 

As mentioned in the previous topic, the 
31

P CPMAS spectrum from the 

dealuminated sample (MFI64) showed for the first time a resonance at ca. 93 ppm (above 

the superacidity threshold ?P = 86 ppm) for a TMPO-loaded HZSM-5. During this work, 

only the dealuminated sample showed this peak at 93 ppm, which strongly indicates that 

this 
31

P resonance arises from the EFAL species originated during the dealumination 

process. Since the 2D 
1
H-

31
P HETCOR spectrum (Figure 25B) shows no cross-peak 

involving the 
31

P peak at 93 ppm and the acid sites (protons &gt; 5 ppm) this 
31

P resonance 

can be unambiguously assigned to TMPO adsorbed into a Lewis acidic center.

4.2. Computational Results  

4.2.1. Modelling Brønsted sites in HZSM-5 

It is known that DPE converges both with the increase of the cluster and basis set 

size,
118

 thus it is possible to obtain accurate results with moderate size basis sets and 

clusters. In this study, three widely used DFT functional were tested to obtained DPE 

values for the four-possible locations where the balancing H
+
 can be placed, when the T12 

site is replaced with an aluminum atom. Results from this study pointed DPE values 

between 1142 and 1279 kJ mol
-1

, that agree with a previous report around 1200 kJ mol
-1

 

for a larger Al-ZSM-5 cluster (51T) optimized also with a large basis set (6 -

311++G(3df,3pd)).
118

 Several studies investigate the influence of aluminum distribution, 

place where the Si???&gt;Al substitution occurs, in the acidic strength of a cluster.
76,77,119

 The 

results presented in this section show that the H
+
 location can also influence the cluster 

acidic strength. 

As shown in Figure 26 all the DFT functionals and the MP2 methods tested pointed 

the centers C2 (Si11-O11-Al12) and C3 (Si20-O20-Al12) (see section 3.2.2.1.) as the 

weakest and the strongest acid centers, respectively. Most of the times, the calculation 

using MP2 method can obtain high accuracy results with very long calculations times. In 

this system, the DFT calculations using both B3LYP and PBE1PBE functionals gave 

results close to those obtained with the more computational demanding method MP2, with 

the larger difference being 4 kJ?mol
-1

. Thus, DFT calculations will be used in the next 

section because they were almost 20 times faster than using MP2 method. Even though the 

C3 center showed a stronger acidic strength, most of the times the center C1 (Si24-O24-

Al12) is chosen in ZSM-5 cluster, because in it is located at the intersection of the straight 

and zig-zag channels, and is widely accessible to adsorb molecules. Thus, in the next 

calculations this will be the used center. 



51 

 

 

Figure 26 - Comparison between three different DFT functionals and an MP2 method used to 

obtain DPE (kJ?mol-1) values for an 8T ZSM-5 cluster with an Al placed in the T12 site. 

As shown in Table 4, the increase of the Si-H terminal bond, from the bare zeolites, 

leads to an increase of the bridging hydroxyl bond length between 0.969 and 0.981, that 

lies in the range proposed for O-H distance from acid groups in HZSM-5 zeolites.
118,120

 

Furthermore, the elongation of Si-H bonds from SiH3 terminal groups leads to a decrease 

in DPE value, except in the earlier stages, reflecting an increase in acidity strength. DPE 

values between 1218 and 1279 kJ mol
-1

, have been deduced from some experimental 

results for HZSM-5 zeolites,
121,122

 thus it is possible that only clusters with terminal Si-H 

bonds between 1.30 and 1.60 Å represent accurately HZSM-5 acidic sites.  

More accurate computational methods (e.g. MP2) can be used as a reference to 

evaluate the better combination (method + basis set) to investigate Brønsted acidity, 

however, calculations using this methods are very time-consuming and were excluded in 

this work. In addition, the results from DFT calculations, showed values that fall in the 

reported ranges for both DPE and O-H bond length (Table 4).

4.2.2. Modelling TMPO adsorption 

Even though the 2D 
1
H-

31
P CP-HETCOR NMR experiments presented in this work 

offer new insights for the investigation of TMPO interactions, we attempted to confirm 

resonance assignments by means of computational calculations. Zheng et al. used 8T ZSM -

5 clusters with different acidic strengths to investigate the interaction of TMPO with 

Brønsted acid sites.
64

 In this study, the same procedure was followed to try reproducing 

their results. Moreover, the functionals that gave more consistent results in the previous 

section were also tested in these calculations.

Table 5 shows that the inclusion of TMPO molecules results in an elongation of 

bridging hydroxyl bond (OZH). This increase in OZH bond length is accompanied by a 

decrease in the distance between the acid proton and the probe oxygen (HOT), however, 

neither the increase or decrease in O ZH and HOT lengths is linear as a function of the Si-H 

distances. The exchange functionals PBE1PBE and B3LYP showed similar variations for 

both OZH and HOT distances (Figure 27). For these two functionals the OZH distance 

increase slowly from Si-H lengths between 1.3 and 1.5 Å, then increase rapidly as the Si -H 

distance increases from 1.5 to 1.6 Å and then the O ZH increases again slowly until the last 

Si-H bond length (2.75 Å). On the other hand, results obtained with the exchange 

functional PW91PW91 have a distinct behaviour for the initial Si-H distances (Figure 27). 

The computational results show that the increase of Si-H length results in a decrease of the 

distance between the acid proton and the probe molecule (HOT), resulting in the formation 

of a TMPOH
+
 complex, for Si-  ? 2. 5 Å (Figure S3).

4.2.3. Modelling 
31

P NMR 

In this work, the results obtained with 2D SSNMR experiments supported some of 

the assignments made so far, however, some new results contradict other assignments. 

Aiming to reproduce the results reported by Zheng et al.,
64

 the same procedure was 

adopted to calculate the 
31

P NMR resonances for TMPO adsorbed at an 8T cluster with 

tuned acidic strength. This methodology was applied to calculate chemical shielding from 

the TMPO-loaded clusters to solid-state TMPO (41 ppm), that with the reported exchange-

correlation/basis set combination for the calculations of 
31

P chemical shifts (HF/TZVP) 

and geometry optimization (PW91PW91/6-31G(d,p)). The calculated absolute 
31

P 

chemical shielding value for solid TMPO was 407.394 ppm, using the same level of 

theory. 

As shown in Table 6, the results obtained, using the suggested method, showed a 

significant distance from those reported in the literature. This variation may arise from the 

use of a different T site for Al substitution or the use of a different software. A well-

accepted 
31

P NMR reference, phosphoric acid (H3PO4), was used to investigate the 

influence of a different 
31

P NMR reference in these results. Presumably, the NMR 

calculations should give similar results, with either reference. However, the results 

obtained using H3PO4 and TMPO as references showed surprisingly distant results, which 

might indicate a poor description of the phosphorous atom in this TMPO systems, using

this combination. The work of Fedorov et al. showed that relativistic corrections improve 

the agreement between theoretical and experimental

However, this basis set does not take into account the relativist effect present in larger 

elements.

In order to investigate these results, the 
31

P NMR chemical shift of a free TMPO 

molecule was calculated using the same combination, HF/TZVP//PW91PW91/6 -31G(d,p), 

and referenced to H3PO4 (Table 7). The calculation resulted in a 
31

P chemical shift of 3.2 

ppm, that is substantially different from the experimental results for both TMPO in 

solution (36.2 ppm)
124

 and crystalline TMPO (41 ppm). However, some studies reported 

that the calculation of 
31

P chemical shift requires more complex methods and larger basis 

sets.
106,123

 A calculation using more demanding method for the GIAO calculation (MP2) 

with the same basis set and geometry optimization combination, resulted in a chemical 

shift of 1.4 ppm for TMPO when referenced against H3PO4. Thus, it is possible that the 



56 

 

TZVP basis set lack in the representation of the phosphorous atom and its interaction. It is 

thus surprising that many examples in the literature use this combination to calculate 
31

P 

chemical shifts. 

Several combinations have been tested in this work, using different methods (DFT 

and MP2), functionals (PBE1PBE, B3LYP and PW91PW91) and basis sets, to find the 

better combination that can accurately describe the TMPO molecule with a reasonable 

computational cost. As shown in Table 7, even computational demanding methods with 

larger basis sets give rise to 
31

P chemical shifts with a significant difference from those 

observed in NMR experiments for TMPO. These calculations showed also that B3LYP 

functional gives rise to theoretical chemical shifts closer to the experimental values than 

the ones obtained by MP2 calculations, not because it is a suitable level of theory but 

because B3LYP functional leads to an overestimation of the 
31

P chemical shift, as 

discussed in a previous report.
123

 Ideally, the results obtained for both references and 

loaded systems, should be compared with results from gas phase NMR. Unfortunately, 

there is no report of gas state NMR experimental results for TMPO or TMPO -loaded 

zeolites, which can lead to inaccurate results. Most of the times, gas phase calculations can 

give similar results to liquid and solid-state NMR results, however, for polar molecules, 

such as TMPO, this difference is larger and cannot be ignored.
106

 Since none of the 

combinations showed good agreement with experimental results, none of them was applied 

to TMPO-loaded clusters.

5. Conclusions and Future Work 

5.1. Main Conclusions 

The main objective of this work was to obtain new insights into zeolites acidity 

using SSNMR, more precisely the study of acidity using a phosphorous basic probe 

(TMPO). Even though zeolites have been extensively studied in the past, achieving a 

complete characterization of their structure and properties can be quite challenging. In this 

work, a series of 
1
H and 

31
P NMR techniques were employed. In particular, 2D 

1
H-

31
P 

HETCOR NMR experiments were used for the first time to investigate TMPO-loaded 

zeolites. This technique is sensitive to 
31

P···
1
H proximities, providing chemical 

information about the acid sites where the TMPO is adsorbed. In addition, the 2D s pectra 

were also able to differentiate between stronger and weaker Brønsted acid sites. The 

experiments presented in this thesis provide new data that may support or refute some of 

the resonance assignments made earlier. Two results presented in this thesis were 

especially revealing: First, the peak at 86 ppm, that was pointed out as the threshold for 

superacidity,
64

 exhibited a correlation with a 
1
H resonance at an intermediate chemical 

shift of ca. 8 ppm (not typical of a highly acidic proton strongly H -bonded to the TMPO 

base), indicating that this resonance arises from a synergic Brønsted/Lewis acid site;
116

 

Second, dealuminated HZSM-5 zeolites loaded with TMPO, may give 
31

P resonances 

pertaining with the formation of a very strong Lewis acid site, in a region usually assigned 

to strong Brønsted acid sites ( &gt; 80 ppm). 

In this work, a successful strategy was implemented to investigate the acidic 

properties of zeolites, that takes advantage of the influence of the counterions in the 

material acidity, the presence of an organic or inorganic template or chemical 

transformations such as dealumination. Combining this workflow with the 2D experiments 

allows an easy assessment of the influence of these variables through 
31

P SSNMR 

spectroscopy leading to a deeper structural insight of zeolite acidity.

5.2. Future Work 

5.2.1. Future NMR studies in TMPO-loaded zeolites 

In addition to the materials used in this work, another material with the same MFI 

morphology but with a pure silica framework, called silicalite, will be used to gain more 

information about the interaction with TMPO with MFI type materials. Since silicalite has 

none or very low amounts of aluminum atoms, the material framework should lack both 

Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. Combining the results from this material with the 

mentioned along this work will provide a representation of TMPO interactions with 

different frameworks with the same MFI morphology, leading to a better understanding of 

zeolites acidic characterization using trialkylphosphine oxides. 

Some of the dipole-dipole coupling interactions that are averaged-out with MAS 

can be reintroduced using REDOR-like methods, such as TRAPDOR, REAPDOR, etc. 

These recoupling techniques provide information about the interatomic distances, which 

can be used to support or give more insights to the results reported in this work. The 

difference spectrum (S-S0) in 
1
H-

31
P-

27
Al CP-TRAPDOR experiment, with 

27
Al irradiation 

and 
31

P NMR observation, will show only 
31

P resonances from TMPO near aluminum 

atoms, signals that disappear with 
27

Al irradiation. Thus, allowing the identification of 

TMPO molecules adsorbed near aluminum species. 

The distance between FAL and EFAL play a major role in synergic Brønsted/Lewis 

acid centers, this distance can be estimated using a single quantum-double quantum 

experiment (
27

Al SQ-DQ). This experiment can also provide information about the 

formation of the strong Lewis acid centers observed in a dealuminated sample of ZSM-5. 

A similar experiment, 
31

P SQ-DQ NMR, can provide also information about the distance 

between different TMPO molecules and the formation of (TMPO)2H
+
 complexes. 

 

5.2.2. Future Modelling studies in TMPO-loaded zeolites 

The results reported in this work showed that some of the most frequently used 

functionals and basis sets lack in the representation of phosphorous atoms, which leads to 

inaccurate results for the determination of 
31

P chemical shielding. In order to obtain better 

results for the 
31

P chemical shift calculations, two main strategies can be used. First, the 

use of NMR oriented functionals, such as Keal and Tozer (KT2 and KT3),
125

 showed better 

results estimating 
31

P chemical shielding calculations and can be tested in these systems.
123

 



61 

 

Second, a benchmark with several small phosphorous-containing molecules can provide a 

linear scaling that should result in better chemical shift calculations for both TMPO and 

TMPO-loaded systems.
106

  

Several papers report that long-range interactions might play a major role in 

zeolites acidic properties, therefore, larger clusters should be tested to investigate these 

long-range interactions. Since TMPO occupies a large part of the ZSM -5 pores (Figure 

28), it is possible that these small clusters misrepresent the interactions in TMPO-loaded 

zeolites. Using these larger models, the influence of aluminum distribution in the different 

T sites can be tested, which should provide a better way of mimicking the zeolite acidic 

strength than varying the length of terminal bonds in small clusters. The influence of 

EFAL species should also be tested, using large models with EFAL species places near the 

probe molecule. 

Another important aspect that can improve the results for the modelling TMPO interactions 

and the 
31

P NMR for TMPO-loaded systems, is using software that is specially designed 

for modelling solid systems, such as Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).

Appendix F – Dealumination of HZSM-5 

 

The dealumination was done by treating HZSM-5 with acetylacetone or HCl 

solution. 0.16 g acetylacetone were mixed with 0.25 g HZSM-5 powder in a Teflon-lined 

autoclave. The mixture was treated at 75ºC for 5 hours. Then, the mixture was washed with 

ca. 10 mL distilled water and dry at ambient temperature. The dried sample was calcined at 

550ºC for 8 hours with temperature increasing rate of 3ºC per minute. Threefold treatment 

by HCl was done as follows. The mixture (100 ml of 1 N HCl per gram of HZSM-5) was 

treated 80ºC for 1 day, after which the suspension was left to settle. The acid solution was 

decanted, fresh acid solution was added, and the whole procedure was repeated. Finally, 

the suspension was filtrated, and the zeolite was washed thoroughly with water. Samples 

were dried at ambient temperature. Figure S12 shows that the treatment with acetylacetone 

does not increase the amount of EFAL species. On the other hand, the sample subjected to 

strongly acidic conditions increased slightly the amount of EFAL species. Since the 

amount of EFAL species generated with these treatments is low, the sample without any 

dealumination treatment was selected for additional studies.
