ABSTRACT 

Title: Internationalization Strategies of Portuguese Companies to India: comparison between 

three strategies- Águas de Portugal, Efacec and Visabeira 

Author: Diogo Gomes 

Keywords: Strategy; Internationalization; Indian Market; Growth Opportunities. 

 

The present dissertation deals with internationalization strategies from companies in a small 

country developed economy, Portugal, to one of the largest economies in the World, India, 

with the purpose of raise awareness of the vast the vast business opportunities that this 

country can offer to Portuguese enterprises. 

The central research question is: “Do Portuguese companies have the capacity to satisfy the 

necessities of a country like India?”  This investigation analyses three very different options 

of internationalization: Outsourcing, luxury market and Indian social problems, where an in-

depth investigation is made on these segments, followed by a case study of three Portuguese 

companies that are currently exploring, respectively, these internationalization options. 

Besides the economic, political and demographic factors discriminated by the companies as 

being extremely attractive for their expansion, the main conclusion of this investigation is that 

Portuguese enterprises have the capacity to satisfy the needs of a country with the size of 

India, and do not necessarily have to pass through Goa to have success in this vast market. 

Based on the results, personalized recommendations were made to the companies analyzed, as 

well as highlighting other attractive sectors for Portuguese firms.

SUMÁRIO EXECUTIVO 

Title: Internationalization Strategies of Portuguese Companies to India: comparison between 

three strategies- Águas de Portugal, Efacec and Visabeira 

Author: Diogo Gomes 

Keywords: Estratégia; Internacionalização; Mercado Indiano; Oportunidades de crescimento. 

 

A presente dissertação retrata as estratégias de internacionalização de empresas de uma 

pequena economia desenvolvida, Portugal, para uma das maiores economias do Mundo, 

India, com o objetivo de consciencializar as empresas portuguesas sobre as vastas 

oportunidades de negócio que este país pode oferecer. 

Sendo a questão de investigação central “ Será que as empresas portuguesas têm a capacidade 

de satisfazer as necessidades de um país como a India?”, esta investigação analisa três opções 

diferentes de internacionalização: Outsourcing, mercado de luxo e problemas sociais indianos, 

onde uma profunda investigação foi feita nestes segmentos, seguida por um caso de estudo a 

três empresas portuguesas que actualmente estão a explorar, respectivamente, estas opções de 

internacionalização. 

Para além dos factores económicos, políticos e demográficos discriminados pelas empresas 

como sendo extremamente atractivos para a sua expansão, as principais conclusões desta 

investigação são que as empresas portuguesas têm capacidade de satisfazer as necessidades de 

um país com o tamanho da Índia, e que não precisam de “passar” por Goa para terem sucesso 

neste vasto mercado. Com base nos resultados, foram feitas recomendações personalizadas a 

cada empresa, assim como realço outros sectores atraentes para empresas portuguesas.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 

In a World, currently defined by globalization and internationalization, a company that 

doesn’t have these definitions on their vision we can say it suffers from strategic myopia. 

Fortunately, that is not the case of the companies analyzed. Visabeira, one of the biggest civil 

construction companies in Portugal, Águas de Portugal, the leader in water treatment in 

Portugal, and Efacec, a Portuguese company in the energy sector and World leader in 

infrastructure in fast recharging for electrical cars, where three Portuguese companies that saw 

the opportunities that India was offering and took advantage of it. 

India is an odd choice for Portuguese companies to have in their strategic vision when 

struggling with the need/opportunity of internationalization. The differences in the 

development of the two countries, the levels of literacy, the language, the way of doing 

business and especially the cultural differences, make a tough call for Portuguese companies 

to select this country as an internationalization option. But the Indian government is well 

aware of problems like poverty, pollution and living conditions, and is making massive 

investments on these fields and his trying to attract foreign investment to create 

infrastructures to solve this situation, which is getting the attention of several companies. 

Going in further detail, not only getting the attention of companies, India has focused the 

attention of countries, and in January 2017, the Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa and 

other Ministers visited India in a state mission. This trip has opened the door to several 

Portuguese companies to start doing business in India, being one of those cases Águas de 

Portugal. 

Quoting HE the India Ambassador in Portugal, Mrs. K. Nandini Singla, “the bilateral trade 

between the two countries has grown 17% in last fiscal year, reaching more than 800 million 

euros. By itself this is a very good figure, but we can do even better”. 

With these aspects in mind, the present dissertation will highlight three areas on exploration 

in the Indian market, which are the luxury segment, social problems segment, and outsourcing 

segment and then explain how the Portuguese companies analyzed are exploring this 

internationalization options.

1.1. RESEARCH QUESTIONS 

 

What are the factors that attract Portuguese companies to go to India?  

Do Portuguese companies have the capacity to satisfy the needs of a country like India? 

What are the similarities between the paths followed by each the Portuguese companies when 

internationalizing to India? 

 

1.2. ACADEMIC RELEVANCE 

 

For a better understanding of the academic relevance of this investigation, the author would 

like to stress the fact that this is the first study in the field of internationalization strategies of 

Portuguese companies to India. There fewer studies of internationalization to developing 

countries and even rarer to BRIC countries and precisely to India, this dissertation is pioneer. 

Therefore, this investigation has the purpose of being a vital tool for the companies analysed 

as an outdoor vision of their strategic planning and also to create awareness of the potentiality 

of the Indian market to other Portuguese companies, with the desire of changing/restructuring 

their internationalization strategy. 

To conclude, the author hopes that this dissertation might open the possibility of further 

studies, not only about the India market but also investigations of other countries that are also 

economically attractive but are simply neglected because of the lack of knowledge regarding 

that market. 

 

1.3. METHODOLOGY 

 

To have a full and well-developed answer to the research questions proposed, the author will 

use two types of data: primary data and secondary data. 

The primary data is based on personal interviews with managers of each company. The 

meetings had the same structure so that they could be compared, with one part equal to every 

firm and other adapt to each reality. It focused on four questions: Why India; What were the 



3 

 

problems when entering India; what are the daily problems of doing business in India; What 

are the perspectives for the future.   

The secondary data, so that the investigation could have a well-grounded structure, literature 

was revised using Top Journals and Google Scholar. Scientific papers related to 

Globalization, Internationalization strategies and entry modes where deeply investigated.   For 

the contextualization of the Indian market, databases as World Bank and Asian Development 

Bank were used, documents from organizations as Invest India, PIB HUB and Indian 

Embassy in Portugal where analyzed and official websites from the Indian government where 

interpreted. For the examination of the companies, their sites and annual reports where 

scrutinized.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW 

 

This chapter of the dissertation has the purpose of supporting my case study by framing 

relevant topics in the concept of internationalization companies to India. Four theoretical 

concepts are going to be explored in detail, more precisely: Globalization; Internationalization 

Strategies; International Entry Modes; Indian Economy; Emergent economies-Growth of the 

“BRIC.” 

Thus, this section of the emergent economies the author will highlight what makes relevant 

the focus on this economies and what do they to differentiate from other developing countries, 

which should be a part of significant attention by the reader because it will be the link to the 

next topic, where the author will go deep in the focus on India, the economy that the 

companies analyzed have chosen to do their international expansion. 

 

2.1. GLOBALIZATION 

 

For a better framework of the topic of this investigation, it is crucial an understanding of the 

interconnections of all economies in the World. Nowadays, “economic globalization 

constitutes an integration of national economies into the international economy through trade, 

direct foreign investment (by corporations and multinationals), short-term capital flows, 

international flows of workers and humanity generally, and flows of technology” (Bhagwati, 

2004). 

According to several authors (Levitt 1984; Yip 1992; Bartlett and Ghoshal), globalization of 

markets is the most recent and dominant change in the World economy. This phenomenon is 

the combination of several of individual differences, for instance in the domain of technology 

we have: improvements in telecommunications, which enables a faster and adequate 

communication between the firms; improvements in transportation, for example, the 

containers, airplanes, and supertankers provide a more competent movement of products and 

people between the different countries; and developments in the production process, making it 

cost-effective product adaptation, like for example a flexible production system (Axinn and 

Matthyssens, 2002). 



5 

 

Also, the countries have created conditions for this innovation could have more impact on the 

World economy. Axinn and Matthyssens (2002) argued that has been a significant reduction 

on trade barriers among countries with the creation of market agreements like NAFTA and 

MERCOSUR (built on the experience of the EU) and over continued tariff reductions 

negotiated by the GATT, which now has been replaced by the WTO. 

After a clear understanding of what globalization is, we should change our focus to the 

competing perspectives of globalization provided by Ngaire Woods (1998) where he gives 

three different views on globalization, describing then as market-centered, state-centered and 

people-centered. 

The market-centered approach on globalization focuses his target on the expansion of 

capitalism, more precisely on the increasing extent and location of transactions in the World 

economy and on the qualitative changes happening in how firms produce and distribute their 

products and services. This analysis suggests that technological advances and a more efficient 

behavior from multinational enterprises can provide a more structured allocation of resources 

around all globe since capital will move to where is more profitable. Comparably, the price 

mechanism will provide a better organization of production across the planet and so a more 

efficient distribution of products and services. This perception of globalization is in fact quite 

positive because it brings benefits to investors, producers, and consumers (Woods, 2002). 

Thomas Biersteker (1989) in his investigation about the way major institutional players are 

rebuilding their processes of thinking and operating, arguing that globalization is affecting the 

quality of the transactions in all over the World, and not only the quantity. Because of this, a 

new possibility of opportunities and challenges emerge to firms, workers, and consumers 

from all over the planet. 

The second perspective, the state-centered, emphasizes the role where states do in facilitating 

and managing globalization, and also the implications that globalization as in the internal 

market/competition, contrasting with the market-centred approach that predicts continuous 

erosion of the importance from the government policies given by the state (Hirst and 

Thompson, 1996; Wade, 1996). Also, these authors argue that a continuous integration 

between the World economies and the increasing of the welfare of the states is not a recent 

relationship. “Governments have used policies to “buffer” their citizens from the dislocations 

and vulnerabilities of World markets.” By doing this, welfare states have allowed global 



6 

 

integration by avoiding a political answer against the global economy.  This two-level process 

of globalization and welfarism has been called “embedded liberalism” (Ruggie, 1983). 

Last but not least, Wood (2002) presents us the people-centered perspective, stating 

“globalization does not just affect markets and states.” This view focuses on social forces that 

are in the society are caused by globalization and the possibilities for change. The new 

transnational influence on media, music, books, general ideas and value are spreading with 

the purpose of creating a global culture. But, although this seems an easy process, it is wrong 

to think that for instance, western values like democracy and human rights are easy to spread 

in other cultures. According to the author, gives the example that western values might 

disseminate into the Middle East, but this region in the World has built a strong opposition 

against “the West,” and they want to continue to be tied to their national and religious 

identity. This way globalization releases forces that restructure global society but not in a way 

that can be controlled or managed by the booming zones of the industrialized countries. 

In summary, globalization is changing not only what firms, states, and people do, but also 

their identity and preferences are facing some differences. Globalization is restructuring the 

sources of power in World politics as well. States, firms, and other players are losing 

autonomy in some areas, and improving in others. However, states have not seen the 

distribution of power changed. Instead, globalization has reinforced the traditional hierarchy 

among countries, supporting the influence of rules that were pioneer shaping globalization 

and strengthened their ability to control the ongoing impact (Woods, 2002). 

In the next topic, I will provide the theoretical frameworks of the strategies that companies 

choose to embrace their international influence. 

 

2.2. INTERNATIONALIZATION STRATEGIES 

 

First and foremost we need to understand the meaning of “Internationalization Strategy”, as 

being "strategy" the capability of “ understanding and industry structure and dynamics, 

determining the organization’s relative position in that industry, and taking action to either 

change industry’s structure or the organization’s position to improve organizational results” 

(Oliver, 2001). In  "internationalization" we have two views. According to Calof and Beamish 

(1995), they define as “the process of adapting a firm’s operations (strategy, structure, and 



7 

 

resources, etc.) to environments”. But can also be defined internationalization concept by 

connecting the organization theory which explains international joint ventures and the trade 

theory that analyzes the location of the firm’s operation. This approach proposes that 

companies to benefit from asymmetries in capabilities and knowledge, they need to develop 

and expand theirs resource across international markets (Buckley and Casson, 1976). 

One of the assumptions of internationalization is that the firm has a competitive advantage to 

provide the international market with superior products which will be overcome by cost and 

accountability of foreignness (Hansén, 1981; Hymer, 1979; Zaheer, 1995). Once this issue is 

accomplished, Root (1987) says that the reasons for a firm to go international it’s because the 

domestic market is stagnant, and/or the foreign market in increasing faster, with possibilities 

of economies of scales, by increasing the production and reducing cost, or the customers or 

domestic rivals are going abroad. All this process allocates an enormous amount of resources 

that need to be taken into account by a firm, especially the time and money is necessary for 

the internationalization (Root, 1987). 

For a better understanding about Internationalization Strategies, the next category will be 

about theories/models of internationalization, which take into account different assumptions 

and structures, namely: The Uppsala Model; The network model; The resources-based view; 

The OLI framework. 

The Uppsala model assumes a combination of commitment of resources and a gradual 

acquisition of knowledge for international operations (Johanson and Vahlne, 1990). It is the 

increase of knowledge that can make the firm’s impression of market uncertainty decrease, 

which will influence the allocation of resources for the process of internationalization. Thus, 

incremental market knowledge sparks the business to proceed in small but progressive steps 

in the international expansion. 

According to Johanson and Mattsson (1988), the network model is the network activities are a 

valuable source that provides an opportunity for the firm to form relationships, and with that, 

it can access to markets and resources. The business networks a company can build can be 

with different stakeholders, for instance, customers, suppliers and even with competitors. 

Also, the authors explain that there is a definite correlation between firm’s 

internationalization efforts and the number and power of the relationship with all the business 

partners, which result in an approach to markets and resources. 



8 

 

Going now through the product life model presented by Vernon (1966), where the author 

explains the different stages of internationalization that depends only on the firm and the 

product. First, in the introduction stage, the business needs to reach a mature stage on the 

domestic market, being the market where the product was developed. After in the growth 

stage, the export activities start to increase, and the firm begins to invest in the manufacturing 

of his products in countries where exist an expanding demand for the product. By doing this, 

the company can benefit from economies of scale.  The mature stage is reached when the 

foreign market starts being saturated, and the product demand becomes to be standardized, the 

manufacture is moved to the countries where the labor costs are low. In the stage of decline, 

the production and in some cases the demand as well leave the industrial nation goes the 

country that initial was where the original innovation as begun (Vernon, 1966; McKiernan, 

1992). 

The resource-based view (RBV) states that firms follow the path of internationalization for 

reasons associated with a cluster of resources that managers can use to create value 

(Wenerfelt, 1984). This resources need to be valuable, rare, difficult to imitate by the 

competitors and have no substitutes ( also known as VRIN attributes), which should result in 

a long-term competitive advantage (Prahalad and Hamel, 1990).A firm’s assets consist of all 

tangible and intangible resources, human and nonhuman, which a company has and with them 

enables to create and implement value-enhancing strategies (Wernerfelt, 1995), with an 

especial detail for the intangible resources like human capital and experience that allows to 

develop in terms of incoming production factors and the creation of competitive advantage. 

The last but not least the eclectic model (also referred as the OLI framework) which analyse 

foreign investment activities by ownership advantages (firm’s resources and capabilities, such 

as international experience), location advantages (production factors in a specific country, for 

instance the market potential) and internalization advantages (Dunning, 1980). In more detail, 

this last point relays on foreign firm’s capacity to coordinate and manage all activities 

internally (Dunning, 1981). 

Although these models give us some knowledge about the internationalization process, some 

authors stated that these theories aren’t always suitable to apply when we are trying to explain 

the new internationalization processes. For instance, regarding the Uppsala Model, Madsen 

and Servais (1997) give a lot of importance to the role of the networks, and the UM does 

consider this variable for the internationalization process. They defended that firms cannot be 



9 

 

analyzed separately and the level of internationalization of the company depends on intensity, 

degree, and extent of relationship in the network with their foreign partners. 

But the knowledge of the four models mentioned will allow us to have a complete view of the 

internationalization process of the companies in the study to India. 

 

2.3. ENTRY MODES 

 

Among the several explanations of a firm entry mode in a foreign country, it can be defined as 

“a structural agreement that allows a firm to implement its product market strategy in a host 

country either by carrying out only the marketing operations (i. e., via export modes), or both 

production and marketing operations there…” (Shama and Erramilli, 2004). In other 

investigations on entry modes connected of the international activity of a firm, it includes 

reviews of the choices and consequences of the entry modes, as well the global ownership 

levels (Sharma and Erramilli,2004; Canabal and White, 2008; Hollesen et al.,2011). 

There are a considerable number of theories and surveys on the entry modes with the purpose 

of explaining the foreign entry mode decisions (Canabal and White, 2008). Agawal and 

Ramaswami (1992) illustrate that entry mode alternatives commit four factors: resources, 

control, risk, and profit. Also the authors and based on the relation of these variables we can 

have the following entry modes: Exporting is the lowest level of entry mode, which requires a 

small commitment of resources and a low risk/ return proving an excellent operational 

control, which fundamental for market seeking firms strategies. In contrast, the solo venture 

mode needs high allocation of resources, meaning that the risk is also going to be high and so 

the control increases too. The joint venture option relatively less resource commitment and 

thus the power, risk and return correlates with the equity participation of the firm. Lastly, the 

licensing mode provides the least control to the licensing business and so the allocation of 

resources also increases. Is also to understand that the variables control and resources/risk are 

positively correlated, once one enhances the other even grows (Agawal and Ramaswami, 

1992). 

According to Ulrich, Hollonsen and Boyd (2014), firms among five possibilities of entry 

modes respecting the level of control, from low to high, being them direct sales, online sales, 

agents/distributors, joint ventures/strategic alliances and wholly-owned subsidiaries to the 



10 

 

BRIC economies, they found out firms prefer low commitment modes when entering this 

markets.  The authors state the agent/distributor is the most popular solution in Brazil and 

Russia, while direct sales to the customers are as popular in India and China, although the 

subsidiary option is a much more valuable entry mode in China compared to other countries. 

This choice of firms choosing low commitment modes when entering the BRIC economies 

it’s not just because they want to reduce market risk, but it’s much more with the purpose of 

building a long-term business network and sustaining the developed relationships with the 

agents and distributors of the BRIC countries. 

Buckley and Casson (1998) also defined entry mode strategy, with a more practical approach. 

The necessary method is to determine the set of all possible market entry strategies, to 

measure the profitability of each, and to identify the most profitable strategy. The following 

issues define the dimensions of the plan set: 1- Where production is located; 2- whether 

production is owned by the entrant; 3- whether the distribution is owned by the entrant; 4- 

whether the distribution is outright, or shared through an International Joint Venture; and 5- 

Whether ownership is obtained through greenfield investment or acquisition. 

 

2.4. EMERGING ECONOMIES- “BRIC” COUNTRIES 

 

In 2001, the acronym BRIC was present by Goldman Sachs (O’Neill, 2001) that stands for the 

countries Brazil, Russia, India, and China and according to the study, this four represent the 

developing countries that will have the biggest economies by the year of 2050. Some 

information we should take into account about is that the BRIC’s population account 

represents more than 40 percent of the World’s population, yet “only” more or less 20 percent 

of the World’s GDP (Wilson, 2003). 

The BRIC countries are quite happy with this status, and for the last couple of years, they 

have organized summits to create common strategies and to have more weight and power on 

the global agenda. All these four countries after the financial crisis in 2008-2009 have 

emerged undamaged and reasonably quickly (Aloui, 2011). 

Although these countries are categorized as a group, among themselves, they have very little 

in common. According to Wilson (2003), India and China are manufacturing-based 



11 

 

economies and big importers, while Brazil and Russia are significant exporters of natural 

resources. 

Going even more in-depth on the differences among the BRIC countries, China is in the lead 

compared to Russia, India, and Brazil regarding growth rate. This phenomenon is related in 

large extent to China’s early focus on focus on ambitious infrastructure projects. Russia is the 

odd one among the BRIC’s; its characteristics are entirely different from the others. While the 

remaining three all had a demographic boom, counting on a young population for innovation, 

Russia has an aging population, and the birth rate is decreasing. His economic success is 

firmly connected to its gas and oil reserves (Ulrich, Hollensen and Boyd, 2014). Brazil is the 

only country that capacity to provide all elements, for instance, manufactured services and 

natural resources supplying (Wilson, 2003). 

In the most recent study from Goldman Sachs (2010), they predict that China is going to 

surpass the USA’s GDP in 2030 and by 2050, India is going to be the second biggest 

economy in the World. Also by 2030, the combined GDP of the BRIC would be more 

significant than the GDP of the G-7 countries. 

According to Crespo (2007), foreign direct investment in developing economies has been 

viewed over the years as a relevant factor contributing to the development and economic 

growth. Developing countries can attract more FDI because of their economic growth and 

investment-friendly policies (Khondoker, 2007). Focusing on the research of Agrawal (2015), 

there is a definite correlation between economic growth and foreign direct investment in 

BRIC economies, where various policies to attract inward FDI could become unnecessary, 

which means that the focus should be to encourage potential sources to sustain economic 

development. 

So concluding, the economic factors are more significant than institutional and political in 

BRIC economies, more precisely market size that is measured in the GDP when attracting 

foreign direct investment, concerning Jadhav (2012). The author states trade openness is also 

positively related to inward FDI and natural resources availability has an adverse effect on 

inward FDI, which means that foreign investment is not motivated by resources-seeking 

purpose in BRIC economies. 

In the next chapter there will be the continuation of the study regarding this subject of 

economic growth and development, but concentrating the focus in India, the economy chosen

by Visabeira, Águas de Portugal and Efacec to expand their influence and where they decide 

to invest.

3. MARKET CONTEXT- INDIA 

 

For a better understanding of the strategic vision chosen by VisaBeira, Águas de Portugal, and 

Efacec, the author understood it was critical an examination of this yet unusual country for 

Portuguese companies to internationalize, that is India. 

With this said, this chapter is going to be divided into three parts: “Overview of India”; “How 

does the USA and Europe see India” and “How does Portugal see India.” This last topic is 

also going to be divided in two, “Luxury market” and “India Social Problems,” where the 

author highlights the importance of these two segments because they are the ones that the 

companies analyzed want to fit in. 

 

3.1. OVERVIEW OF THE INDIAN MARKET 

 

Till recent years, India was not seen as an economic power as we know it today.  It was only 

after the publication of “India’s Rising Growth Potential” by Tushar Poddar and Eva Yi 

(2007) and then “EM Equity in Two Decades: A Changing Landscape” by Goldman Sachs 

(2010) where the incredible influence that the World’s biggest democracy, with more than 

1.364 billion of people (World Bank, 2016) and a GDP of about 2.264 trillion US Dollars 

(World Bank, 2016), started to be seen by more developed countries as the economic and 

political power it is and by the opportunities it presents to the World economy.  

A glimpse of the “recent” past, after independence in 1947, India implemented protectionism 

laws and state-interventionism policies which tied up the economy with strict regulations, 

damaging the economic freedom and trade (Poddar and Yi, 2007). The result of these 

measures was a low grow GDP (appendix 1) for several decades.  Facing this problem, in 

1991 the government started implementing economic reforms, were gradually removed 

obstacles to economic freedom and allow India to catch up, steadily being again included in 

the global economy.  With this opening to the exterior, “since 2003, India has been one of the 

fastest-growing major economies, leading to rapid increases in per capita income, demand, 

and integration with the global economy.” (Poddar and Yi, 2007) 



14 

 

Currently, the country is seen as very appealing to major players for strategic investments 

because of India’s vast range of industries, expenditures approach, and a supportive 

government and especially with a huge and young population (appendix 2 and 3), which is a 

high driver for demand and an excellent source of the labor force. 

This south Asian nation with the capital in New Delhi is divided into 29 States and 7 Unions 

totalizing 2,973,190 square km of land and has as the head of the government Mr. Narendra 

Modi, prime Minister since May 26, 2014, and he has been pointed out has  one of the biggest 

responsible for India’s current growth. 

Focusing now on the economic factors, India has emerged as the economy with the most 

prominent growth rate in the World as we can see in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 

and is predicted to be one of the top economic players in the World in the next 10-15 years, 

and by 2050 even being the second most significant World economy, right after China (Moe 

et al., 2010). According to the World Bank (2016), India has a GDP growth of 7.9% in 2015, 

is expected an increase of 6.8% in 2016 and till 2020 is predicted a growth above 7% 

(appendix 2). This is one of the biggest economic indicators to attract FDI. (Jadhav, 2012; 

Ulrich et al., 2014; Agrawal, 2015) The gross value added regarding the composition by 

sector is divided in the following way 2016-2017 PE: Services- 51.5%; Industry-31.1%; and 

Agriculture-17.4%.The Balance of Payments, also an economic factor that attracts FDI 

(Jadhav, 2012) (appendix 7), is contrary with the exports of goods and services being 443 

Billion US Dollars (appendix 6) and the imports reaching almost 530 Billion US Dollars 

(World Bank, 2015) (appendix 5). This deficit is also seen as a decisive factor for investors, 

and so, since 2000 the foreign direct investment has totalized around 400 Billion US Dollars 

(World Bank) and registers the highest number ever in 2016, reaching almost 45 Billion US 

Dollars (World Bank) (appendix 8). Facing this, the sectors that most attracted FDI were the 

service sector (18%), construction development (7%), computer software and hardware (8%), 

telecommunications (7%), automobile (5%), drugs and pharmaceuticals (4%), chemical (4%), 

trading (4%), power (3%) and hotel and tourism (3%). 

For the future, India and the Asian Development Bank are establishing a strategy for 2018-

2022, with the purpose of creating a stronger middle class and achieving a sustainable 

economic growth. This approach will focus on three main pillars. The first one will develop 

economic competitiveness by creating better and more jobs for better and more qualified 

people through an expanding infrastructure network for transport and energy alongside 

economic agglomerates.  The second Pillar will improve the infrastructure in lagging regions 



15 

 

that need them for systems and social services, especially in rural areas with the target of 

rising agricultural productivity and decrease rural-urban income gap. The last Pillar will 

promote the renewable resource use in projects designing so that the negative impacts of the 

global warming can be mitigated. 

 

3.2. HOW DOES THE USA AND EUROPE SEE INDIA 

 

Europe and the United States of America are two of most prominent export partners of India 

with the USA responsible for 16% and Europe for nearly 20% Also, this two together 

correspond to around 27% of FDI in India, since April 2000 till June 2017. US responsible for 

6 % and the European Union for 21% (focusing on the leading countries: 

UK,7%,Netherland,6%, Germany,3%, Cyprus,3%, France, 2% and a small note for Portugal 

that represents 0.02%, which is around 76 million US Dollars) (appendix 9). 

The reason for this fact is that companies in the areas mentioned above outsource some part of 

their business line to India, mainly for reasons related with the cheap labor (Kobitzsch et al., 

2001; Liu and Trefler, 2008; Flecker, 2015). For instance, the minimum wage in India is 

around 60 US Dollars per month (June 2017) which allows the companies to cut cost and 

have more competitive prices.  

Although the labor cost is an excellent factor for outsourcing, there are others that also have a 

vast weigh in this decision, as the access to knowledge and availability of labor (Flecker, 

2015). The rise of the outsourcing in India brought something new, where for the first time 

educated US workers are competing with also educated but lower-paid foreign workers 

(Kobitzsch et al., 2001). Other advantages are cost saving that is the result of the economies 

of scale and corporates can restructure themselves by concentrating on their core business and 

outsource service providers and intermediaries (Flecker, 2015). This was the case of European 

companies that relocated their work to India where they found quickly the resources in need 

or to carry out projects at all (Flecker and Kirschenhofer, 2002). 

But this phenomenon is also part of the Indian government strategy that aims to enlarge the 

number of jobs by creating a World-class infrastructure and establishing economic corridors, 

because the manufacturing sector can create more jobs per unit of output than services sector 



16 

 

and one the objectives of the government is to reduce the unemployment rate (Asian 

Development Bank). 

Make in India, as they call it, was introduced by the prime Minister at 15 of August 2014, 

where he said: “I want to tell the people of the whole World: Come, make in India. Come and 

manufacture in India. Go and sell in any country of the World, but manufacture here. We have 

the skill, talent, discipline and the desire to do something. We want to give the World an 

opportunity that come make in India”. The program targets 25 sectors, that include: 

automobiles, aviation, chemicals, IT &amp;amp; BPM, pharmaceuticals, construction, defense 

manufacturing, electrical machinery, food processing, textiles and garments, ports, leather, 

media and entertainment, wellness, mining, tourism and hospitality, railways, automobile 

components, renewable energy, biotechnology, space, thermal power, roads and highways and 

electronics systems.  The incentives are provided by the central government like subsidizing 

projects from companies that invest more than 1 Billion INR (almost 15.5 million US Dollars) 

in 15%, export incentives like contract drawback or contract exception schemes and 

incentives for particular areas and sectors, and also incentives from the states government that 

are different in every state, but some examples of the incentives are the exemption of the land 

acquisition, refund or waiver of taxes or companies do not need to pay electricity. This way 

the investment is facilitated, innovation is encouraged and labor skills are developed, uniting 

the conditions to achieve the primary objective of this initiative that is to attract foreign 

investment and empower India’s manufacturing sector. According to the Asian Development 

Bank, this project has the purpose of increasing the contribution of manufacturing from 16.5% 

of GDP in 2016 to 25% by 2022. 

Having a critical view on this matter, the creation of jobs in the manufacture sector is not a 

long-term solution for India.  Analyzing only in the short term, what this program can do it’s 

incredible, since it gives the opportunity for people to move from the agriculture to the 

industrial sector, where the salaries are better paid, and gives the chance of unemployed 

people to have a salary. But what happens, and its one concern of Invest India, is that in the 

value chain of the final product, only a small part of the value stays in India, where the big 

part goes to the developed countries. This will create two problems: first, the deficit of the 

balance of payments will continue to increase and second, this will not enable the creation of 

a stronger middle class. Efforts have been made by Invest India that companies give better 

working conditions to the workers, especially give better salaries so that employees can 

develop more consumption habits.

3.3. HOW DOES PORTUGAL SEE INDIA 

 

Even though Portugal is in Europe, the way Portuguese companies see the Indian market is 

not in the same way as other companies. By not having a strong manufacturing field, 

compared of course with other European countries and also the USA, Portugal targets his 

focus in niche markets, for instance, the luxury market, and in social problems where 

Portuguese companies have the knowledge to help India solve them. 

Starting with the luxury market, even though India is placed in the seventh position in the 

raking of countries with highest GDP (World Bank, 2016) India is also divided into several 

states where the wealth is not equally distributed. For a better understanding about the 

distribution of wealth among Indian people, the Global Wealth Report (2017) creates a 

hierarchy where we will only focus on the millionaires that have their wealth bigger than 1 

million US Dollars and the ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWI), which their wealth is 

bigger than 30 million US Dollars. According to this study, an UHNWI in India owns more 

than three houses. 

In India, there are around 264300 millionaires in 2016, where 6740 are UHNWI. This last 

group witnessed a growth of 12% and in the next decade is predicted to increase by 150%. 

This means that in 2026, India is going to be the third country with more UHNWI in the 

World, right after USA and China. 

The top four Indian cities with more millionaires in 2016 were Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, 

and Kolkata. Mumbai its city with more rich people, where itself accounts for 1340 UHNWI, 

which is almost the double than Delhi (680) has, which earns the second place, followed by 

Kolkata (280) and Hyderabad (260). The rise of UHNWI is these cities’ regarding 2015 was 

also incredible, reaching values between 10% and 15%. Even these four cities account for 

33% of all millionaires in India, again with Mumbai on the top with 46000 people, followed 

by Delhi (22700), Kolkata (9600) and Hyderabad (9000). 

Even though it doesn’t appear in the study, the author selected Bangalore to close the top five 

wealthiest Indian cities. According to City Momentum Index 2017, Bangalore is the World’s 

fast-changing city and regarding UHNWI, the growth between 2015 and 2016 it was 15%( the 

same has Hyderabad). The so-called Indian Silicon Valley has attracted a vast number of 

World’s technology firms, as well as a significant number of successful national start-ups, by 

creating conditions for them to establish there. 



18 

 

Now focusing on the social problems, India has one the most prominent GDP’s in the World, 

but the GDP per capita in one of the lowest, which is almost 1700 US Dollars (World Bank, 

2016). There has been done a lot of progress to reduce the poverty rate in the last two 

decades, where the rate decreases from 45.9% in 1993 to 38.2% in 2004 and 21.2% in 2011 

(World Bank, 2016) . Even though we see a considerable reduction, in absolute numbers this 

means that in 2011 around 268 million people were living with less than 1.90 US Dollars per 

day (World Bank 2016). 

Although we see a decrease in the poverty levels, a large proportion of the population it 

continues exposed to any economic collapse. Also, the poverty level is not equal spread in all 

states: for instance, about 54% of poor Indian people live in five low-income states (Bihar, 

Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh) (Asian Development Bank, 2016). 

Another point we should take into account his the economic effort in environment and climate 

change matters. Air pollution, cropland degradation, and insufficient water supply are critical 

contributors estimated to cost about 5.7% of the GDP a year (World Bank, 2013). The access 

to fresh water is a severe problem since only 3% of the World’s clean water it’s in Indian 

Territory while accounting with 16% of the World’s population. The water resources are 

extremely contaminated, where most of the rivers are terribly polluted by uncontrolled 

discharge of garbage and industrial outflow (Mukherji et al., 2012). 

The Indian government is fully aware of this problems, and  in the United Nations Sustainable 

Summit 2015 they target these issues. In fact, most of the national government’s flagship 

programs have the purpose of solving them, supervised by a strict attention by the state and 

local governments regarding the planning, budgeting, developing implementation and 

monitoring systems on these programs. 

The areas where they are focusing their attention are considered priority areas to achieve 

sustainable growth in the long term. The areas identified are Smart Cities- development of 

100 smart cities that can provide infrastructure and intelligent solutions like efficient energy 

systems, environment-friendly public transportation and green building that can save energy. 

The purpose of this is by 2030 the urban share of GDP increases to 75%; Atal Mission for 

Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation- The plan is to build infrastructure to the biggest 500 

cities and towns that can provide clean water supply, proper sewerage systems and 

management, stormwater drains and adequate public transportation. The government wants 

this project to be complete by 2019; Clean India Mission- The purpose is to increase access to 



19 

 

sanitation services in rural and urban areas so that by 2019 there exists 0% open defecation in 

urban areas; Revitalized power sector- this program aims to provide full access to electricity 

at affordable, by repair the financial health of energy distribution companies. The objective is 

by 2018 every rural area has voltage and by 2019 24x7 power for everyone; Skill India- Aims 

to increase the skills of about 400 million people by 2022. Another project that also has a 

huge impact is the cleaning of the Ganges River to allow competent abatement of pollution so 

that the stream can recover. (Asian Development Bank, 2016) 

To conclude, we clearly see the enormous effort of the Indian government to provide 

sustainable conditions that give dignity to his population. But they also know the lack of 

internal knowledge that exists in the country, so they want to attract foreign companies to help 

them solve these problems.

4. CASE STUDIES 

 

The following chapter is going to analyze Efacec, Visabeira and Águas de Portugal strategy in 

the in the Indian Market. It will be divided into three parts: Outsourcing Strategy; Indian 

Social Problems Strategy; Luxury Strategy. 

For a better understanding for the reader of the approach of each market segment, the author 

decided to separate Vista Alegre Atlantis (one of the companies that belong to Visabeira 

Indústria) from Visabeira Global (appendix 12). Even though they belong to the same 

company and their internationalization strategy is correlated, their target group is different and 

so the way they position themselves also differ. 

 

4.1. OUTSOURCING- EFACEC 

 

Founded in 1948, Efacec is a B2B company in the energy, engineering and mobility sector. 

By being present in more than 60 countries, in 2016 the company had profits of 431.5 million 

€. The core business of the company is divided into three areas: Systems, batteries, and 

products. 

In 2007, Efacec was losing competitiveness to other European companies in the sector and 

was struggling to win it back. The company had to develop a strategy to solve this, otherwise, 

they could go bankrupt. Since increasing the prices of the products wasn’t a solution, because 

their clients could quickly change to the cheaper products of the competitors, Efacec had to 

move the production facility from Portugal to another country for two reasons: to lower the 

costs and to have a fast and reliable resource of the materials required for the final product. 

There were certain countries that fulfill these requirements, for instance, Western Europe 

countries, Turkey and India. But the increase of inflation and labor cost in the European and 

the political instability in Turkey put aside this two options. Adding to this, in 2007 there was 

a state mission by the Portuguese president, something that helped Efacec in the 

internationalization process to India. 

To expand for this new country, also because of the high bureaucracy and the difficulty of 

finding a green-field,  Efacec did a partnership with a local company in the sector, and they 



21 

 

created two companies, both of them with equal control share for Efacec and the local 

business. One of the companies was for outsourcing the products in need by Efacec and 

would be controlled by Efacec, and the other was to sell the products, that were produced in 

the other company, in India that was going to be managed by the local partner. But this wasn’t 

a good strategy. The company responsible for commercializing the products wasn’t efficient 

in doing it, and part of the justification was because the Efacec product wasn’t adequate for 

the Indian market, being considered a premium product.  Facing this management problem, in 

2013, Efacec decided to change the strategy and acquire the totality of the outsourcing 

company, and in exchange, they sold their share of the commercialization company to the 

local partner. In 2013, was born Efacec India Private Limited, a company 100% Efacec only 

with the purpose of producing Efacec products. 

Efacec faces several problems of having a solo company in India. The quality of the final 

work is one of those. Indian patterns of quality, and also regulation, are significantly lower 

than Portuguese ones, demanding by the company a huge resources allocation in giving 

formation to their employees that currently are 120 Indian people. Even with this matter, is 

still cost efficient having a factory in India, since in average the producing a product in India 

the costs are 30% lower than producing it in Portugal, with some of the products reaching 

50% in cost advantage. Another problem is the Portuguese people Efacec has allocated to 

India because of the difficulty of managing their expectations regarding living abroad as an 

expatriate. The third issue is the tax system in India, that since the begin of the year of 2017 

there was a meaningful tax reform that substituted a huge group of indirect taxes, taxes that 

used to differentiate products from services and weren’t the same in different states, to only 

one tax called GST- Goods and Services Tax.  

The strategy for 2020 is divided in two parts: first to increase the production of the Indian 

company and second to improve the features of the products. Even though Efacec India 

corresponds 30% to 40% of Efacec total production, the company wants to increase this 

percentage to 60% to 70% in order to become more competitive. Also, the company has a 

problem with the customization of the final product to some countries. For instance, there are 

countries where the final product it goes directly from India, like Morocco, and others the 

products need to go to Portugal to be customized and then go to the last destination, like 

Australia. By doing all of this in India, the company would save resources and lower the 

costs. 

 



22 

 

4.2. LUXURY MARKET- VISTA ALEGRE ATLANTIS 

 

Being one of the oldest and most known companies in Portugal, Vista Alegre was founded in 

1824, and this group produces porcelains for a premium segment. In 2001 the company 

merged with Atlantis, a company that produces crystals, creating Vista Alegre Atlantis. In 

2009, the company was bought by Visabeira, and both companies started sharing their 

internationalization strategy. VAA has a physic presence in 13 countries, and itself has made 

profits in 2016 were 75.4 million €. 

With the state visit of 2017, it was official that Vista Alegre Atlantis was going to expand to 

India. With an already well-developed analysis of the Indian luxury market, VAA found out a 

large segment in absolute numbers of people with high demand for their products, and so they 

used the state visit to do a partnership with a local player and together they created Shree 

Sharda Vista Alegre, with an equal share for both members. 

The barriers to enter India where diluted by having a local partner, but this also created some 

problems. One of those is the differences of rhythms of work of the two cultures is too 

different, being the Indian one much slower. For instance, the first physical store in Delhi 

should have been opened in September 2017, but because of Indian partner took more time 

than agreed to make internal decisions, the store will only open to the public in December 

2017. 

Since this is still a recent expansion, the company yet didn’t have the opportunity to prove the 

value of the Indian market, but the strategy is extremely ambitious. VAA has different plans 

to reach the general public and the HoReCa channel. In the B2C approach, VAA wants to 

open more physical shops in strategic cities, where the potential clients live. In the B2B 

segment, the company intends to rely on the website, with strong marketing campaign behind 

it. VAA will use the social media to reach their consumers. Also, Word-of-Mouth is a 

valuable tool, since the company is addressing a niche market, the people in this segment 

know each other and so far is the most effective marketing tool. A more long-term strategy, 

VAA is using India to enter in other Asian countries, but first, the company wants to grow 

strong and in a sustainable way in India and then address other destinations. 

 

 



23 

 

4.3. INDIAN SOCIAL PROBLEMS- ADP AND VISABEIRA 

 

Águas de Portugal was founded in 1993, and their core business is water treatment. Adp is 

present in 9 countries and by offering services of water supply and sanitation services 

management, operation and maintenance of infrastructures, planning and investment 

management, strategic studies and training and capacity building, the company reached more 

than 8 million of people all over the World and achieved profits of 646,1 million € in 2016. 

Until this year, 2017, India wasn’t on the plans of AdP for internationalization destination. 

The strategy was to continue to develop in countries where they on-going projects especially 

in Angola and Mozambique, two countries that have a high demand for the services that AdP 

provides and a significant support from the local government. 

But in January, there was organized a state visit to India where the Portuguese prime Minister 

and other Ministers travelled together with around thirty managers of Portuguese companies, 

and Águas de Portugal was also in the visit represented by Alexandra Serra, manager director 

of Águas de Portugal Internacional SA, and other managers. In this visit, they had the 

opportunity to see several social problems that India faces, but also to know the significant 

amount of projects develop by the central government with the purpose of solving those 

problems. After encountering this considerable demand for AdP services, when the managers 

return to Portugal, there was a new mindset with the objective to reorganize the 

internationalization strategy of the company. 

Going a little bit deeper on the reasons that sparkled the choice of this new country for 

expansion, the main factors that had a huge influence on the internationalization decision 

were the demographic and political factor.  Starting with the demographic, with a big 

population that India has, there are a lot of needs to be satisfied, and some of those are the 

access to clean water and proper sanitation services, two of the most significant problems 

India faces. To solve these issues, the government developed state-funded programs, called 

flagships programs, to target these issues, but because of lack of knowledge and skills, they 

also need foreign partners to address this matter. Two of the flagship programs that got AdP’s 

attention was the Smart Cities Mission that was the purpose of renewal the biggest 100 cities 

so that they can offer a better quality of life and be sustainable, and the National Mission for 

Clean Ganga that is a plan to cleaning in a sustainable way the Ganges river. The political 

factor is not only the increase relationships between Portugal and India, with the creation of 



24 

 

the Indian Visa Gold for Indian people that invest in Portugal, but also the Europe and India 

that under the agreement of India-EU Water Partnership, the European Union will help India 

on the cleaning ganger river mission. 

Being India a country with an enormous demand for AdP services, the company wants to 

provide all his services, but only in the long term. So far, the company is targeting very low-

risk operations by focusing on the task of technical assistance. The strategy to do these 

operations was first to create partnerships with local partners and second to focus in the state 

of Goa, where now the company has signed a protocol to work in two priority areas that 

belong to the smart cities program. Also, AdP is applying for an entirely subsidized by the 

European Union program called Call 2020, that has the purpose of helping in the cleaning the 

Ganges River operation. 

Águas de Portugal didn’t find many barriers when trying to enter India since almost all of the 

obstacles were diluted by the contacts they made during the state mission and by the 

partnership with the local partner, but there are some problems of being in this country. The 

first one is that Indian people have a different speed of doing tasks, comparing to Portuguese 

people, which doesn’t allow AdP to be as efficient as they wanted to. Another factor is the 

fact EU subsidizes some programs in India for water treatment, making it a highly 

competitive market since other European companies in the water treatment sector also want to 

take advantage of these programs. 

For the future, the company still doesn’t have a structured long-term strategy regarding India, 

part of it because it’s still a recent expansion and they are still checking expectations. So far 

they want to win the Call of the Ganges River and be successful in the two pilot projects in 

Goa so that they can increase their influence in this state. 

In the same segment selected by the author, Visabeira also fulfills social problems that India 

people face. Founded is 1980, Visabeira is one of the biggest companies in the civil sector in 

Portugal with services related to telecommunication, energy, technology, and construction. 

Visabeira closed the year of 2016 with profits of 601 million €, with 3.5 million € being from 

transactions with India. 

Being dynamics and aggressiveness two words that characterize Visabeira, the company is 

always looking for new countries to expand their influence. Together with this, in 2007 there 

was a Portuguese state mission to India, one of the countries already targeted by the internal 

department of internationalization as one country with high demand for Visabeira services 



25 

 

and with tremendous potential to do business, and so the company also joined the state 

mission to India. 

In this visit, Visabeira did several contacts that allow the company to do a partnership with 

Aditya Birla Group, an Indian multinational with several subsidiaries in the civil construction 

sector,  and together they created a joint venture called Birla Visabeira Private Limited, a 

company 50% Visabeira and 50% Birla Group. This is also part of the strategy of Visabeira 

when facing risky markets. While in Europe they have firms 100% Visabeira, in developing 

countries like Angola and Mozambique, and now India, they do a partnership with a local 

partner, something quite “easy” for Visabeira since they a broad curriculum of collaboration 

with a lot of European telecommunication companies. 

The Birla Visabeira Private Limited focus on telecommunication projects, especially in 

installing and doing maintenance of optical fiber cables. Recently, Visabeira started doing 

consulting projects in this field since the optical fiber technology is well developed in 

Portugal, but it’s quite new in India. 

But by doing business in India, two problems emerge on this fact. The first is the Indian group 

gives a lot of trust in the people of Visabeira, and not on the institution itself. This is a huge 

concern because in some cases a small problem that with the European companies could be 

clarified by an email, in India sometimes it requires to Visabeira managers to travel there to 

solve it. The second is also something that concerns AdP in their regular basis activities. By 

Portuguese and Indian people having different rhythms of work, it is complicated to 

harmonize everything and manage the expectations of everyone. The most common problem 

is with public contests is that when published, the company stresses to try to fulfill the 

requirements to win it, and then sometimes the contests are postponed to time periods where 

there are no longer are attractive to Visabeira, making them wasting resources unnecessarily. 

In the future, Visabeira wants to continue to grow alongside his partnership and is developing 

a new strategy where the company will be connected to every part of the value chain in 

optical fiber infrastructures, where they will do the planning, construction, and maintenance 

of all projects they operate in. Example of that is the construction of an optical fiber 

backbone, which is an infrastructure of many fiber optic cables that together increase the 

capacity of the system, which will have more than 1000 km. Once constructed, the purpose is 

to rent it to telecommunication companies. Also, Visabeira is studying the possibility to 

expand to other Asian countries, for instance, China and Indonesia, but this is only part of a 



26 

 

long-term strategy, and first they want to strengthen themselves in India’s market. To 

conclude, since Águas de Portugal and Visabeira are complementary companies, once the two 

companies have more influence in the Indian market, they want to create a partnership of 

Portuguese companies where AdP does the planning of a water treatment infrastructure and 

them Visabeira will construct it.

5. CONCLUSIONS 

 

This section of the dissertation will be divided into two parts. The first part will be based on 

the investigation that has been done in the chapters 3 and 4. This section will answer the 

research questions proposed, focusing on the main points discovered during the analyses of 

the Indian market and the strategy of the Portuguese companies to address that market. The 

author will also make some recommendations to the companies, based on the information 

gathered during the investigation. 

The second part is going to focus on other business opportunities that were not genuinely 

analyzed in this investigation and also in the openings provided particularly by the state of 

Goa, because of the historical proximity that it has with Portugal. 

 

5.1. FINDINGS 

 

5.1.1. WHAT ARE THE FACTORS THAT ATTRACT PORTUGUESE COMPANIES 

TO GO TO INDIA? 

 

As suggested by the literature review and them confirmed by the interviews with the 

managers of the companies, the economic factors, and the political factors have a huge weigh 

on the choice of India. Since 2003 we have observed an incredible GDP growth with an 

average of 8.3% per year, due to the economic reforms that the Indian Government have 

implemented with the flagship programs, as example Make in India, Smart Cities program, 

Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, Clean India Mission, Revitalize 

Power Sector program and Skill India. These were the primary drivers allowing India to 

attract 45 billion US Dollars in 2016 in foreign investment, position the country in the eighth 

position of the countries with highest FDI in the World.  

Also, the demographic indicators have an impact on the decision of the companies, contrarily 

of what was found in the literature. It seems like the fact that India has a population of more 

than 1.3 billion people, where around two thirds in with age between 15 and 35, it represents a 

significant factor seem is this fact that makes the government invest such substantial amounts 



28 

 

of money the programs already mentioned. As said by the managers, it’s not a factor that 

makes them go to India, by itself not enough for the internationalization process, but together 

with the economic and political factors, it helps in differentiating India  from other previously 

consider countries. 

 

5.1.2. DO PORTUGUESE COMPANIESHAVE THE CAPACITY TO SATISFY THE 

NEEDS OF A COUNTRY LIKE INDIA? 

 

Unlikely to what the author thought at the beginning of this investigation, the answer to this 

question is yes. Compared to his European competitors, the Portuguese companies have a low 

manufacture industry in the country and the labor costs in Portugal are also smaller, meaning 

that the need for outsourcing is reduced.  That’s why there was a focus on the other two 

market possibilities, Indian social problems, and luxury markets, where Portugal was 

companies capable of fulfilling this needs. The truth is that, for the three different options of 

internationalization, there are three successful cases of internationalization for each option. 

Vista Alegre Atlantis is positioned themselves carefully in the luxury market with the 

porcelains, Visabeira and Águas de Portugal is targeting the Indian social problems in the 

infrastructure necessities and the water treatment sector respectively and, against the odds, 

Efacec has a factory in India to do outsource of part of their products with the purpose of 

lower their costs and remain competitive when facing their European competitors. 

This represents an incredible change in the mindset of the managers since in this three so 

different market segments there are respectively three Portuguese companies that are 

embracing this opportunity and taking advantages out of it, whether is by increasing the 

profits or reducing the cost. In this dissertation, it is proved that Portuguese companies are at 

the same level with European companies when trying to enter the Indian Market.

5.1.3. WHAT ARE THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE PATHS FOLLOWED BY 

EACH PORTUGUESE COMPANY WHEN INTERNATIONALIZING TO 

INDIA? 

 

When comparing the path and strategies of the three companies analyzed, even though their 

core business is in different sectors and also the markets they approach isn’t the same, we can 

see some aspects that are similar between them, such as: 

State Mission to India: In 2007, 2013 and 2017 there was a state visit to India, and is also the 

years where Efacec, Visabeira, and Águas de Portugal, respectively, internationalize to India. 

At a first sign it might seem just a coincidence, but according to the managers of each 

company, these visits have facilitated the expansion of the three companies. As the companies 

where represented in each visit, respectively, by internal managers it enabled to make contacts 

and to celebrate contracts, which without the all-state visit atmosphere it would be very 

difficult, not to say nearly impossible; 

50/50 partnerships: The creation of a new company, 50% of the Portuguese company, 50 % 

of a local partner in the sector, is something we see in the three strategies. Even Efacec that 

has a factory 100% of the company, in the beginning, it started with a partnership. This a 

necessary procedure, otherwise the complication with the bureaucracy with the entry in India 

would just create several problems and also would not allow the company to position 

themselves as they want to, being quickly annihilated by the local competitors.  

Starting with low-risk operations: Even though the companies know the incredible 

opportunities India has to offer and also the advantages they take from it, they know that a 

wrong step might compromise all the process of being successful in India. That why they 

choose to do smaller operations, both in cost and profits so that they can create trust in that 

market. Only after that, the companies can start target more challenging projects were also the 

advantages are higher. 

Problems with the rhythm of work: Having Indian people a different way and speed of 

work comparing to Portuguese ones, it makes difficult to conjugate expectations by both 

parts. This represents the biggest problem that the Portuguese companies face, making them 

articulate extra costs to confront this issue, both in time and in money. 

Increase influence in India: Is part of the long-term strategy of the three companies to 

increase their projects in India. Vista Alegre wants to expand to other cities, Águas de 



30 

 

Portugal intends to win the Call of the Ganges River, Visabeira wants to construct the 1000 

km fiber optical backbone, and Efacec wants to increase their factory to produce even more 

products in there. The companies are well aware of the possibilities of the India market, and 

they want to take the maximum leverage they can get from it. 

 

 

5.2. RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

Based on the profound investigation done to the Indian Market in the dissertation and the 

understanding of the strategy of the companies in India, the author decided to conjugate the 

knowledge acquired in these two sections of the investigation to formulate personalized 

recommendations to each company. 

Starting with Vista Alegre Atlantis, since is part of the strategy to expand to other cities and 

their target group is the 1% wealthiest people in India, and considering VAA has already a 

shop in Delhi, the author suggest the company to go to Mumbai, where most of the Indian 

richest people live by far when comparing to other cities in India. After increasing their 

influence in Mumbai, VAA should expand, in this order, to Hyderabad, Kolkata and 

Bangalore, the cities that complete the top five of the richest cities in India. 

For Visabeira and Águas de Portugal, the author advises the companies to analyze carefully 

the Mission of Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation and Clean India Mission, two 

programs that are in the water treatment sector that requires the construction of enormous 

infrastructure, where the partnership between the two companies can be successful. 

Last but not least, according to Efacec’s managers, the company doesn’t belong to the 

program Make in India, thus foregoing the opportunity of getting tax benefits and government 

support that would allow the company to be more cost efficient. As such, the suggestion of 

the author would be for the company to enter in the program since Efacec is the perfect 

example of the companies according to Prime Minister Mondi, when in the presentation of 

this program he said “ Go and sell in any country of the World but manufacture here (India)”.

5.3. GOA STATE- AN OPTION RATHER THAN A PATH 

 

The reason for this topic appears in the conclusion is because the author would like demystify 

the relation between Portugal and Goa as the only way for Portuguese companies enter in the 

India market. The false common sense exists because Goa is historical connect to Portugal 

and this Indian state is considered a mix of the two cultures. As the author analyzed, only Adp 

is present in Goa but is already targeting bigger projects, for the cleaning of the Gangues 

River. The other two companies don’t have any business in Goa and don’t plan to have, 

meaning that a Portuguese company can have success in India without “pass” through Goa. 

But even though these facts, two reasons made the author discriminate this particular state: 

the first is the huge efforts already made between the governments of the two countries to 

provide help for the internalization process in this state, more specifically the Indian Embassy 

in Portugal and Portugal India Business HUB, an organization that helps Portuguese 

companies go to India and vice versa and has offices in Lisbon and Goa, being this the state 

where they can provide a better service. 

Goa is one of the smallest states in India with about 1.5 million people, but with a GDP of 8 

billion us Dollars, being one of the states with biggest GDP per capita in India. In this western 

state there are two sectors are extremely attractive for Portuguese companies: Tourism and 

Pharmaceutical sector. 

A quick overview on these sectors, the tourism is the largest segment in services sector in 

Goa. It is considered a paradise for tourism and that’s why it attracted 680683 tourists in 

2016, getting the state on the top 10 of India that attract more tourists. The pharmaceutical 

sector is extremely appealing as Portuguese companies carry out a lot of research in the field, 

and India already attracts a large number of pharmaceutical companies due to increased 

research opportunities, as well as the provision of government incentives through the program 

“Pharma Vision 2020” by the government’s Department of Pharmaceuticals. All these 

initiatives provide partnership and growth opportunities for Portuguese research companies to 

expand into India. 

 

 

  



32 

 

5.4. INDIA BEYOND THE STUDIED FRONTIERS 

 

As a result of the investigation in the last months about the Indian market, and also as 

discriminated by the Indian Embassy, several sectors outside the scope of this dissertation 

were identified as extremely attractive for Portuguese companies to explore, but were not  

analysed in depth as currently there aren’t any National enterprises operating in such sectors. 

The sectors in question are: Defence sector, where around 370 Portuguese companies of 

defence technology have huge opportunities in the Indian market; Energy sector, where 

Portugal is the World leader in renewable wind energy; Footwear sector, where shoes moulds 

have a huge demand; agriculture sector, where food processing technology in very advance; 

and Information technology sector, where there focus in the two countries artificial 

intelligence, algorithms and online platforms. 

The exploration of the sectors listed above can lead to a win-win scenario for both countries. 

 

5.5. LIMITATION AND FUTURE RESEARCH 

 

Throughout months of research and hard work, the author was able to provide some 

significant conclusions, thanks to transparency of the companies interviewed and the 

organizations involved. 

But, through the process, there were a couple of limitations that don’t allow the investigation 

to reach a unique truth if Portuguese companies can satisfy the necessities of the Indian 

market. The first is the small sample of companies interviewed that do business in India, what 

does not grant an equal pattern in other companies. The second is the briefness of the 

expansion of some of the companies investigated, which at this stage do not own financial 

evidence of the success of the strategy proposed. 

Also not forgetting the way of the interview was taken and how the questions where 

structured might have misguided the interviewee on his answer and not answering of what the 

author really wanted. 

Despite all of this, the author suggests for future investigations the continuation of this study, 

by focusing in other relevant areas and sectors and can also be economically interesting for 



33 

 

Portuguese companies, for instance the energy sector, in more detail the renewable energy 

sector and the tourism sector. Also the author would like to see a new analysis on the 

companies investigated, but in a 5 years’ timeline with the purpose of confirming the 

expectations of the current strategy.

“The products produced in India are final 

and intermediary products at the same time. 

For some countries the product is ready to 

be transport to his final destination, others 

the product needs to come to Portugal to be 

personalized and them be transported to his 

final destination. For the future, we want to 

do these changes in India in order to be 

more cost efficient”
