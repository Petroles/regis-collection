We present results of electrical conductivity profiles obtained with inductive electromagnetic
geophysical method in Santa Marta archaeological site, Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil. This site is
a sambaqui (shell mound), in which several human occupation remains are found during pre-colonial
period such as buried lithic and bone artifacts, fire-place, etc. Most of these mounds include as well many
human burials, which, in many cases, point to funerary ritual as a main agency for mound building. A set
of profiles of apparent electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility was acquired in two sites
aiming the identification of geophysical anomalies with potential interest for excavation. To enhance
conductivity data, we applied an effective procedure to remove topographical effects in the apparent
conductivity measurements, which are rather conditioned by the presence of a variable water table
depth or conductive sediment layer. A linear dependence among conductivity values and the site
elevation provided a simple linear model to remove the influence of topography. Corrected electric
conductivity maps substantially improved the definition of anomalies, many of them rather subtle in raw
data images. Corrected maps also show a better adherence with magnetic susceptibility maps, both of
them identifying archaeological structures of interest: a well-structured fire-place and a concentration of
ceramic fragments.

1. Introduction

Technological advance in the last decades has propitiated
a realizable increase of applied geophysical works to archaeological
studies. The use of shallow geophysics has effectively contributed
with no destructive actions in modern archaeological studies, by
identifying favorable places for excavation in reduced time and costs
(Conyers and Goodman, 1997). Among geophysical methods with
applications in archaeology, inductive electromagnetic and GPR
methods are highlighted due to their robustness and functionality in
data acquisition and interpretation (Conyers, 2004; Reynolds, 1997).

Inductive electromagnetic methods have found many applica-
tions such as, archaeology (Tabbagh, 1986; Bevan, 1991; Dalan,
1991; Clay, 2001; Gomes, 2003; Venter et al., 2006; Rodrigues et al.,
inpress), precise agriculture (Corwin and Lesch, 2003; Oliveira
et al., 2005), mapping of metallic piping (Borges and Porsani, 2003;
: þ55 11 30915034.

Carpenter and Deignan, 1993; Cisar et al., 1993; Maclean et al., 1991;
McNeill, 1980), and soil salinity (Bennett and George, 1995; Tri-
antafilis et al., 2000), among others. Theoretical basis to this
method can be found in (Keller and Frischknecht, 1966; McNeill,
1980; Telford et al., 1990).

There are various geophysical equipments that by using induc-
tive electromagnetic method principles, such as EM31, EM34,
EM38, EM61 (Geonics, Instruments), among other instruments. In
this work, EM38 equipment was used (Geonics, 1998). The mapping
by using EM38 equipment provides the spatial variation of the soil
electrical conductivity, and magnetic susceptibility. The equipment
possesses two coils spaced of 1 m, working with 14.6 kHz of
frequency, and it could be employed through two acquisition ways:
Vertical Magnetic Dipole – VMD – that allows investigating up to
1.5 m of depth, and Horizontal Magnetic Dipole – HMD – that
allows investigating up to 0.75 m of depth (McNeill, 1980). As
electrical conductivity as magnetic susceptibility derive of a rela-
tion between primary and secondary electromagnetic fields, seeing
that electrical conductivity correspond to a quadrature component

(imaginary part) and magnetic susceptibility correspond to a phase
(real part) of these fields.

According to McNeill (1980), the ratio between secondary
magnetic (HS) and primary magnetic (HP) field is linearly propor-
tional to electric conductivity (s) of mean, being expressed by:

s ¼
4

um0s
2

?
HS
HP

?
q

(1)

where ‘‘u’’ is angular frequency (u ¼ 2pf), ‘‘m0’’ is magnetic
permeability of vacuum, ‘‘s’’ is the space between sensors (trans-
miter-Tx and receiver-Rx), and ‘‘q’’ denote a part in quadrature of
these field. On the other hand, magnetic susceptibility (cm) values
are obtained with equipment in vertical magnetic dipole – VMD –
mode by the means of conductivity measurements accomplished in
soil surface (sVMD0 ), and in 1.5 m of height (s

VMD
1;5 ), whose

measurement difference is given by:

Ds ¼ sVMD0 ? s
VMD
1;5 (2)

Thus, magnetic susceptibility (cm) value could be obtained by
expression:

cm ¼ 58 ? 10
?6Ds (3)

In this work we show that irregularities in terrain surface
meaningfully distort the conductivity maps, even hiding anomalies
with archaeological structures. Topography disturbance, however,
seems to be cast in a very predicable way: higher the elevation,
lower its apparent conductivity. At least for the studied sites, this
simple behavior can be associated to the distance of sensor
regarding a shallow water table. Since EM38 signal is focused to
about 0.5 m depth (VMD mode) (McNeill, 1980), its signal response
in depressions is to a large extent conditioned by conductive
saturated zone. Otherwise, in elevations, its response reflects the
low conductivity values usually found in vadose zone. In the middle
of such limiting heights, a smooth variation in apparent conduc-
tivity is observed, and conductivity maps exhibit a regional pattern,
higher correlated with site relief.

In the study of contaminated sites, a practical procedure was
proposed to remove such regional effect from EM31 and EM34 data
(Monier-Williams et al., 1990). This article shows that the depen-
dence among electric conductivity values and site elevation
provided a linear model to remove the topography influence. This
procedure is applied here intending to enhance the response from
archaeological targets that in some cases were note clearly distin-
guished. Despite good results in contaminated areas, there are no
records in scientific literature about removal of topographic effects
in measures of electrical conductivity carried out with inductive
electromagnetic method applied in study of archaeological sites up
to now.

This simple predicable variation are associated to underground
conductivity, for example conductive sediment layers, and the
variation in water table depth that usually follow the topography,
seems to be a main factor conditioning the electromagnetic
induction response, with capacity for even hiding small variations
produced by archaeological targets. In this article it is presented an
effective methodology that removes the influence of topography in
electrical conductivity data obtained by inductive electromagnetic
methods, and it shows two examples of application in archaeo-
logical site studies.

2. Santa Marta archaeological site

Santa Marta sambaqui archaeological site is located at Jaguaruna
region, in Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil (Fig. 1). Sambaqui is
a guarani (Brazilian native language) word meaning: Tamba? – shells
and Qui – conic mound, or shell mound. These sambaquis are
constituted by a high variation in volume and morphology, pre-
senting a distribution and concentration pattern defined by sedi-
ments. According to DeBlasis et al. (1998), these structures were
built by inhabitants that lived in south of Brazil during pre-colonial
period, about 6000 years before present.

Sambaquis (as already said, it is an original word from native
Tupi language, literally meaning ‘‘shell mounds’’ or concheiros) are
archaeological mounded sites distributed all over Brazilian coast,
mainly at ecologically patchy areas involving brackish waters,
mangrove and forests such as lagoon, bay and coastal island areas.
These sites present different sizes, achieving impressive dimen-
sions especially at southern coast of Santa Catarina, where they
may reach up to 70 m height and 500 m width. In general, they
exhibit heterogeneous stratigraphic sequences differently
composed, mostly thicker shell layers irregularly intercalated with
smaller dark strata richly composed of organic materials, including
abundant funerary structures in specific areas. In fact, several
burials are reported in most sambaqui descriptions, disposed ritu-
ally in specially prepared places, frequently accompanied of arti-
facts, food offerings and fire-place (DeBlasis et al., 2007; Gaspar
et al., 2008).

The application of geophysical surveying methods to these
mounds aims a quicker, larger, and non-destructive understanding
of underlying structures as well as the identification of punctual
features such as fire-place and burials without intensive digging,
consequently contributing to preservation of prehistoric Brazilian
heritage. It is expected such structures generate resistive anomalies

and of low magnetic susceptibility values, once there were not
relates of metallic artifacts to this civilization. However, some
structures could provoke anomalies values of high electrical
conductivity, and magnetic susceptibility as paleo-fires that present
remaining magnetization. This magnetization can be caused by
freezing of Earth magnetic field in ferromagnetic minerals present
in rock fragments during the burnt processes.

3. Data acquisition and treatment

Two areas of Santa Marta archaeological site – grid-1
(25 m ? 10 m), and grid-2 (20 m ? 5 m) – have been investigated. In
grid-1, measurements were done along 11 parallel inductive elec-
tromagnetic profiles, and in grid-2, along 6 lines. In both areas the
lines were orientated from south to north direction. Lines were
regularly separate of 1 m, and measurements were done along line
in 0.5 m of interval.

Measurements were carried out with EM38 equipment in VMD
mode (Fig. 2) for a deeper investigation depth. During data acqui-
sition, a base point was set for further drift correction. This proce-
dure is necessary to guarantee a good data quality, by avoiding
conductivity variations caused by changes in the equipment
temperature (Sudduth et al., 2001).
Fig. 4. Relation between apparent electric conductivity in terms of topographic vari-
ation to grid-1.
Terrain elevation was measured with a Leica TCR305 infra-red
total station, by taking random measurements along lines. Approx-
imately one measurement per square meter was taken. Elevation
model errors were below some few millimeters.

Topographic variation effect in the apparent electric conduc-
tivity measurement by using inductive electromagnetic method is
illustrated in Fig. 3. According to this conceptual model when
sensors (Tx and Rx) are put at a topographic lower part (h) they are
close to conductive sediments or water table (conductors), so
electric conductivity measurement values are higher. This fact

happens due to higher sensor proximity with saturated sediments
that are more conductive than background one, provoking an
increasing in induction of electrical current (Is) in the conductor,
increasing measured electrical conductivity values measured by
equipment. On the other hand, where topography is higher (H),
conductive sediments or the water level is kept distant of sensors so
the conductivity reading by equipment is lower. In other words,
more distant sensors are from saturated sediments in subsurfaces,
lower electrical current induction in the conductor will be, it
means, electrical conductivity influence in conductor will be lower;
so electrical magnetic field intensity is attenuated by mean,
decreasing electrical conductivity values measured by equipment
(McNeill, 1980).
Fig. 8. Map of apparent electric conductivity (raw dat
The relation between topographical variation and apparent
conductivity measurements in grid-1 and grid-2 are presented in
Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. Fig. 4 was elaborated starting from a set
of 561 points of apparent conductivity to grid-1 area, and Fig. 5 was
elaborated starting from a set of 246 conductivity values to grid-2.
Note there is a well defined linear data trend for both areas. This
fact clearly indicates data suffer influence of topographical varia-
tion. Thus, they can be corrected. On the other hand, magnetic
susceptibility (equation 3) does not possess any relation with
topographical variation, it means, with proximity of saturated
sediments, because it only depends on the amount of magnetic
minerals presented in material, so it does not need correction.

To analyze the dependence of conductivity values with elevation,
electromagnetic induction and topographic data were interpolated
on a regular same size mesh. This task was necessary because both
data sets have no coincident reading points. Conductivity and
magnetic susceptibility data were acquired along regular S-N profiles
but elevation heights were randomly acquired, only guaranteeing
a suitable data density. That occasion, data were adjusted for regular
mesh with coincident points, and maps were elaborated. With data
adjustment in regular grids, effect of temperature drift was reduced
by the means of procedure described by Sudduth et al. (2001).
Subsequently, apparent conductivity and magnetic susceptibility
maps were elaborated. It is important to note these procedures are
usually applied in processing grid data and they are not effective in
removing elevation influence. Following procedures to remove
topographical effect in conductivity data are shown.

In order to correct elevation effect, we applied the following
equation (Monier-Williams et al., 1990):

Cðx; yÞ ¼ 20,log10

"
sapðx;yÞ
sapðbacÞ

#
(4)

where C (x,y) is electrical conductivity value normalized in decibel
(dB) at position (x,y), sap(x,y) is apparent conductivity, and sap(bac) is
background electrical conductivity. In this work, the reduction of
topographic effect in apparent conductivity measure was done
through its normalization by apparent mean background conduc-
tivity value obtained from all data set measurement for grid-1 and
grid-2. The mean conductivity value of background obtained for
a) overlapped to topographic variation to grid-1.

grid-1 was 15.04 mS/m, and for grid-2 was 6.83 mS/m. Mean
conductivity of background used in this work is due to this measure
be statistical robust (Barbetta, 2002).

Since there are relation linear trend between electric conductivity
and topographic variation, and electric conductivity values of
background, also called ‘‘regional conductivity’’ can be determined,
so topography influence can be corrected. Figs. 6 and 7 shows
normalized apparent conductivity measurements in terms
of topographic variation to grid-1 and grid-2, respectively. Note
to grid-1 straight line equation of better adjust is done by
(y ¼?4.6705x þ 450.72), and to grid-2 straight line equation is done
by (y¼?1.4272x þ 138.38). In such a way, final apparent conduc-
tivity ‘‘y’’, without topographical influence, was calculated by these
equations whose topographical values are replaced in ‘‘x’’. This
correction allows enhancing the obtained apparent conductivity
anomalies with inductive electromagnetic method before masked
for topographical variation influence.

4. Analysis of results

4.1. Grid-1

Fig. 8 shows apparent electric conductivity data overlapped to
the topographical variation for grid-1. As it can be observed in the
figure, topography influence in conductivity values is clear. This
effect is enough evident, it means, the place where a low topo-
graphical exists apparent electric conductivity value is raised; on
the other hand, in places topographically higher, electric conduc-
tivity values are low.

Fig. 9 shows raw data apparent conductivity map (a), background
conductivity map (b), residual conductivity map (c), as well as the
magnetic susceptibility map (d). Residual conductivity map corre-
sponds to apparent conductivity map corrected for topographical
effect obtained from subtraction of measured conductivity map by
apparent background map. Residual map shows as negative as
positive conductivity values. Negative values indicate it is less than
regional conductivity, and positive more. Although negative
conductivity values do not have physical meaning, these values were
included by bearing in they are referenced to a particular background
value. In this sense, conductivity anomaly is distinguished, and not
true physical property value. With magnetic susceptibility data
integration we have elements to better understand these residual
anomalies; therefore we prove the presence of this anomaly for
apparent conductivity residues and magnetic susceptibility.

Apparent corrected conductivity clearly evidences a conduc-
tivity anomaly (C1) that before topographic correction was not
clearly observed. Note that information about magnetic suscepti-
bility allowed defining a significant magnetic anomaly (M1), which
matches with observed conductivity anomaly positioning. The
other two conductivity anomalies observed in Fig. 9c (position
x ¼ 9 m, y ¼ 16 m, and 19 m) are less relevant because there are not
correspondence with magnetic susceptibility data. As a conse-
quence, they were not indicated as potential archeological targets.

Archaeologists’ team from Universidade de Sa?o Paulo, leaded by
DeBlasis, has accomplished archeological excavation in study areas,
taking as base results obtained in this research. As excavation result

a fire-place was found in grid-1 area (Fig. 10) corresponding to
conductivity anomalies (C1), and magnetic susceptibility (M1).

4.2. Grid-2

Fig. 11 shows apparent conductivity data in relation to topo-
graphical variation for grid-2. In such area it is observed topo-
graphical effect is not so clear in relation to previous area, this could

ence or conductive sediments, probably deeper.

raw data (a), the map of background apparent electric conductivity

Fig. 12b. Then, the effect of topographical correction for this
anomaly was not so significant. Information about magnetic
susceptibility for grid-2 also defined the existence of a strong
magnetic anomaly (M2).

In grid-2 area a concentration of ceramic material (Fig. 13) cor-
responding to conductivity (C2) and magnetic susceptibility (M2)
anomalies was found. Geophysical results obtained in here were
fundamental to time optimization, and involved resources with
drilling steps. Archaeological researches are in progress, and their
excavated archaeological material samples were sent for dating.
5. Conclusions

Correction of topography effect in apparent electric conductivity
data through its normalization by background conductivity mean
was effective for the two study areas located in sambaqui archae-
ological site from Santa Marta, Santa Catarina state, Brazil. Electric
conductivity anomalies were enhanced by improving possibilities
of success in archaeological excavation. This procedure could be
used to enhance masked archaeological anomalies by influence of
topographical variation.

Geophysical anomalies of electric conductivity corrected from
topography and magnetic susceptibility for both grid-1 and grid-2
study areas emphasized the identification of two areas with high
archaeological potentials. These results that orientate archaeolog-
ical excavations allow exposing a fire-place in grid-1 area, and
a concentration of ceramic materials in grid-2 area.
