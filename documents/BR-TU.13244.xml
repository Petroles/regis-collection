Abstract

Tick-borne pathogens affect a wide range of vertebrate hosts. To identify tick-borne pathogens among dogs from 
Campo Grande, MS, Brazil testing seropositive for Leishmania infantum (syn. L. chagasi), a serological and molecular 
study was conducted to detect Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma platys and Babesia vogeli in 60 serum and spleen samples. A 
confirmatory diagnosis of L. infantum based on serological and molecular assays was also performed, as was sequence 
alignment and phylogenetic analysis to assess the identity of the parasite species infecting these animals. IgG antibodies 
to Ehrlichia spp., B. vogeli and L. infantum were found, respectively, in 39 (65%), 49 (81.6%) and 60 (100%) of 
the sampled dogs. Twenty-seven (45%), fifty-four (90%), fifty-three (88.3%), two (3.3%) and one (1.6%) dog were 
positive, respectively, for E. canis, Leishmania spp., Leishmania donovani complex, Babesia sp. and Anaplasma sp. in 
PCR assays. After sequencing, the amplicons showed 99% of identity with E. canis, B. vogeli, A. platys and Leishmania 
chagasi isolates. The findings of this study indicate that L. infantum-seropositive dogs from Campo Grande are exposed 
to multiple tick-borne pathogens, which should therefore be included in the differential diagnosis of dogs with clinical 
suspicion of leishmaniasis.

Keywords: Ehrlichia canis, Babesia vogeli, Anaplasma platys, Leishmania infantum, dogs, co-infection.

Introduction

Tick-borne pathogens are emerging agents responsible for 
diseases in both humans and animals worldwide (SHAW et al., 
2001). Ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis and babesiosis are tick-borne 
diseases of worldwide occurrence in dogs, whose main vector is 
the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus (DAGNONE et al., 
2003; NAKAGHI et al., 2008; OLIVEIRA et al., 2008). Dogs 
can be infected by several agents of the Anaplasmataceae family 
(DUMLER et al., 2001), such as Ehrlichia canis, Ehrlichia ewingii, 
Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Anaplasma platys, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, 
Neorickettsia risticii (INOKUMA et al., 2001) and N. helminthoeca 
(HEADLEY et al., 2006).

Ehrlichia canis is a common pathogen among domestic dogs 
in Brazil, and is considered primarily responsible for canine 
monocytic ehrlichiosis (NAKAGHI et al., 2008; DAGNONE et al., 
2009). Clinical manifestations of the disease include fever, 
weight loss, anorexia, bleeding disorders and lymphadenopathy 
(CASTRO  et  al., 2004; NAKAGHI  et  al., 2008). Anaplasma 
platys, a bacterium that parasitizes platelets, causing canine cyclic 
thrombocytopenia (COHN, 2003), has also been reported in 
dogs in Brazil (DAGNONE  et  al., 2009). Furthermore, A. 
phagocytophilum also has been detected molecularly in dogs in the 
state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (SANTOS et al., 2011). Although 
dogs infected with A. platys and A. phagocytophilum usually present 
mild symptoms or are asymptomatic (HARRUS  et  al., 1997; 
KOHN et al., 2008; RAR; GOLOVLJOVA, 2011), some cases 
may be serious or fatal, particularly when co-infections are involved 
(DANTAS-TORRES, 2008). The confirmation of the occurrence 
of E. ewingii (OLIVEIRA et al., 2009) and A. phagocytophilum 
(SANTOS et al., 2011) in dogs from Minas Gerais and Rio de 
Janeiro, respectively, showed that other Anaplasmataceae agents 
circulate among dogs in Brazil, although the vector tick species 
involved in these transmission routes remains unknown.

Babesiosis, which is caused by intraerythrocytic protozoa of the 
genus Babesia sp., is an emerging disease transmitted to humans 
and animals by ticks (IRWIN, 2009). In Brazil, apart from a single 
report of B. gibsoni in a dog in the state of Paraná (TRAPP et al., 
2006), dogs are more often parasitized by B. vogeli (PASSOS et al., 
2005; FURUTA et al., 2009). Clinical manifestations of canine 
babesiosis are characterized by fever, lethargy, anorexia, jaundice, 
pale mucous membranes, splenomegaly, and weight loss. The 
prognosis for diseases caused by piroplasm species is usually good, 
except when the disease is caused by B. rossi and B. gibsoni (IRWIN, 
2009; SOLANO-GALLEGO; BANETH, 2011).

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), an infectious disease that affects 
both humans and animals, is caused by protozoan parasites of 
the genus Leishmania, such as Leishmania (Leishmania) donovani 
and Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum. The latter is endemic in 
the New World in regions extending from the southern United 
States to northern Argentina, including Brazil (KUHLS et al., 
2011). The diagnosis of VL has proved to be problematic, mainly 
because of the wide variety of non-specific clinical symptoms, 
including a broad spectrum of presentations (BLAVIER et al., 
2001). The immunosuppression observed in VL may promote the 
occurrence of co-infections with other agents such as Ehrlichia, 

Babesia, Dirofilaria, Toxoplasma and Neospora in endemic regions 
(FEITOSA et al., 2000; PAULAN et al., 2013). On the other 
hand, a primary infection with tick-borne agents is likely to 
be a contributing factor to the establishment of canine VL, as 
was shown for ehrlichiosis in a longitudinal study of naturally 
exposed naïve dogs (MEKUZAS et al., 2009). The present study 
aimed to verify the occurrence of E. canis, A. platys and B. vogeli 
among L. infantum-seropositive dogs from Campo Grande in the 
Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), using serological and 
molecular techniques.

Materials and Methods

Between June 2011 and March 2012, serum and spleen samples 
were collected from 60 L. infantum-seropositive dogs from the 
Center for Zoonosis Control (CZC) of Campo Grande, Mato 
Grosso do Sul and subjected to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA). Blood samples for the serological tests were drawn 
from each dog by cephalic venipuncture and stored without 
anticoagulant (EDTA). During necropsy, fragments of spleen 
were collected aseptically and stored in absolute ethanol for DNA 
extraction. Additionally, serological and molecular assays were 
performed for a confirmatory diagnosis of L. infantum.

A Leishmania sp. strain isolated in Araçatuba, São Paulo, 
Brazil, characterized as donovani complex, probably L. infantum, 
using molecular techniques described by Cortes et al., (2004), was 
used in this study. The parasites were maintained on RPMI-1640 
medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) supplemented with 
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Canyon 
City, USA) at 25 °C and were used to prepare the crude antigens 
for IFAT and ELISA.

The ELISA method employed here was described in detail by 
Oliveira et al. (2008). Briefly, 100 mL of crude Leishmania sp. 
antigen diluted in 0.05M sodium carbonate-bicarbonate buffer 
(pH 9.6) was added to each well on ELISA plates (Nunclon TM 
surface; Nunc, Denmark) and 5mg mL protein concentration was 
used. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the plates were washed 
three times with 0.05% PBS Tween-20. The plates were blocked 
with 200 mL containing 6% skim milk for 2 hours at 37 °C to 
reduce nonspecific binding. The blocking agent was removed, 
and individual dog serum diluted (1:400) in PBS Tween-20 
with 5% skim milk added to each well, followed by incubation 
for 90 minutes at 37 °C and washing as described above. One 
hundred mL of alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-dog IgG 
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) diluted at 1: 4.000 in PBS 
Tween-20 with 5% normal rabbit serum was added to each well, 
followed by incubation for 90 minutes at 37 °C. The plates were 
washed and the substrate (p-nitrophenyl phosphate) diluted in 
diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.8, was added. Absorbance at 405 nm 
was read after 45 minutes of incubation at room temperature, using 
an ELISA reader (Dynex Technologies, USA). The discriminating 
absorbance value (cut-off) was determined as being 2.5 times the 
mean absorbance value of the negative control.

Ehrlichia spp. antigen was obtained from E. canis (Jaboticabal 
strain)-infected DH82 cells maintained in culture in the 
Immunoparasitology Laboratory of UNESP at Jaboticabal, São

Detection of tick-borne pathogens in dogs from Mato Grosso do Sul

Paulo (AGUIAR et al., 2007). Babesia spp. antigen was prepared 
by intravenous inoculation of B. vogeli (Jaboticabal strain) into a 
splenectomized three month-old dog negative for hemoparasites 
by PCR and serology (FURUTA et al., 2009). Giemsa-stained 
blood smears were examined microscopically twice daily day for 
the presence of parasites. After peak parasitemia was observed on 
the fifth day after inoculation, infected blood was collected with 
Alsever’s solution (113.7 mM glucose, 27.2 mM sodium citrate, 
71.8 mM sodium chloride).

Slides containing air-dried fixed B. vogeli trophozoite-
infected blood, E. canis-infected DH82 cells and Leishmania 
sp. promastigotes were tested by IFAT (Indirect Fluorescent 
Antibody Test), as described previously (FURUTA et al., 2009; 
NAKAGHI et al., 2008; OLIVEIRA et al., 2008). Antigen slides 
were removed from storage (?20 °C) and allowed to thaw at room 
temperature for 30 min. Ten microliters of twofold dilutions of 
sera (cut-off of 1:64 for Ehrlichia spp., 1:40 for B. vogeli and 1:40 
for L. infantum) were placed in wells on antigen slides. Canine sera 
known to be positive for E. canis, B. vogeli and L. infantum were 
obtained from symptomatic dogs with ehrlichiosis, babesiosis and 
leishmaniasis treated in the Governador Laudo Natel Veterinary 
Hospital of UNESP at Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil, and used as positive 
control. Negative control serum samples were obtained from dogs 
(unexposed to these agents, according to negative PCR and IFAT 
results) that were kept at the kennel of the Department of Veterinary 
Pathology of UNESP at Jaboticabal. Slides were incubated at 37 °C 
in a moist chamber for 45 min, washed 3 times in PBS (pH 7.2) 
for 5 min, and air dried at room temperature. FITC-labeled 
anti-dog IgG conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich?, St. Louis, MO, USA) 

was diluted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (dilution 
of 1:32) and added to each well. These slides were incubated again 
at 37 °C, washed 3 times in PBS, then in distilled water, and air 
dried at room temperature. Next, coverslips were placed on the 
slides, which were examined under a fluorescence microscope.

DNA was extracted from spleen fragments using the 
QIAamp DNA Blood and Tissue Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, 
California, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Each sample of extracted DNA was used as a template in 25 µL 
of reaction mixture containing 10x PCR buffer, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 
0.2 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTPs) mixture, and 
1.5 U Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, 
USA) with 0.5 µM of genus specific primers for Ehrlichia spp. 
(16S  rRNA  gene) (MURPHY  et  al., 1998), Anaplasma spp. 
(16S  rRNA gene) (MASSUNG  et  al., 1998), Babesia spp. 
(18S  rRNA  gene) (CARRET  et  al., 1999), Leishmania spp. 
(kinetoplast DNA) (MICHALSKY et al., 2002) and L. donovani 
complex (CORTES et al., 2004) (Table 1). Positive controls of 
E.  canis and B. vogeli DNA samples were obtained from dogs 
infected experimentally with Jaboticabal strains of E. canis 
(CASTRO et al., 2004) and B. vogeli (FURUTA et al., 2009), 
respectively. A. platys DNA positive control was obtained from a 
dog from Campo Grande, MS naturally infected with A. platys 
(DAGNONE et al., 2009). L. infantum DNA positive control was 
obtained from parasites maintained in culture. Ultrapure sterile 
water was used as negative control. To prevent PCR contamination, 
the DNA extraction, reaction setup, PCR amplification and 
electrophoresis were performed in separate rooms. The reaction 
products were purified using a Silica Bead DNA Gel Extraction

Kit (Fermentas?, São Paulo, SP, Brazil). Purified amplified DNA 
fragments were subjected in-house to sequence confirmation in an 
automatic sequencer (ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer - Applied 
Biosystem/ Perkin Elmer) and used for subsequent phylogenetic 
analysis. Phylogenetic reconstructions were based on DNA sequence 
alignment of positive samples. Consensus sequences were obtained 
by analyzing the sense and antisense sequences using the CAP3 
program (http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgibin/MobylePortal/portal.py). 
Comparisons were made with sequences deposited in GenBank 
using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST).

Results

IgG antibodies to Ehrlichia spp., B. vogeli and L. infantum 
were found, respectively, in 39 (65%), 49 (81.6%) and 60 (100%) 
sampled dogs. IFAT titers ranged from 40 to 5120 for B. vogeli, 
64 to 2048 for Ehrlichia spp. and 40 to 20480 for L. infantum. 
Thirty-four dogs (56.6%) showed antibodies to Ehrlichia spp., 
B. vogeli, and L. infantum; 6 (10%) dogs were seronegative for 
Ehrlichia spp. and B. vogeli, but seropositive for L. infantum. 
Five (8.3%) dogs were seropositive only for Ehrlichia spp. and 
L. infantum; 15 (25%) were seropositive only for B. vogeli and 
L. infantum, and six (10%) dogs were only seropositive for 
L. infantum (Table 2).

Twenty-seven (45%) dogs were positive for E. canis nPCR, 
54 (90%) for Leishmania spp. PCR, 53 (88.3%) for L. donovani 
complex PCR, two (3.3%) for Babesia spp. PCR and only one 
dog (1.6%) for Anaplasma spp. nPCR. All 27 E. canis-nPCR 
positive dogs showed antibodies to the agent; 12 (30.7%) out of 
39 Ehrlichia spp -seropositive dogs did not test positive in the 
nPCR assay. Twenty-one (35%) out of 60 sampled dogs were 
negative for both Ehrlichia spp -IFAT and nPCR. Twenty-three 
(38.3%) dogs were positive for both E. canis and Leishmania spp. 
PCR assays, and 22 (36.6%) for E. canis and L. donovani complex 
PCR assays (Table 2).

Only one dog was positive for both B. vogeli-IFAT and 
PCR, showing a low titer (40) in IFAT. One dog was positive in 
PCR but negative in IFAT for B. vogeli. Forty-eight (80%) dogs 
tested positive for B. vogeli only in IFAT. Ten (16.6%) dogs were 
negative for both B. vogeli-IFAT and PCR. One dog (1.6%) was 

positive for E. canis nPCR and Babesia spp. PCR, respectively, 
and one animal (1.6%) tested positive in the Leishmania spp., 
L. donovani complex and Babesia spp. PCR assays. One (1.6%) 
dog tested positive in all Anaplasma spp. nPCR, Leishmania spp. 
and L. donovani complex PCR assays, and showed antibodies for 
both B. vogeli and L. infantum (Table 2).

Fifty-three dogs (88.3%) tested positive in L. infantum IFAT 
and Leishmania spp. and L. donovani complex PCR assays. Only 
one dog was positive for Leishmania spp. PCR and negative for 
L. donovani complex PCR. All 54 Leishmania-PCR positive dogs 
showed antibodies to this agent; 6 (10%) and 7 (11.6%) out of 60 
L. infantum-seropositive dogs did not test positive in Leishmania 
spp. and L. donovani complex PCR assays, respectively (Table 2).

After sequencing, amplicons obtained in the E. canis nPCR 
(358 pb) showed 99% of identity with sequences of E. canis found 
in dogs from the Philippines (JX893523), Japan (AB723712) and 
Taiwan (GU810149) by BLAST analysis. An amplicon obtained 
after Anaplasma spp. nPCR (546 pb) showed 99% of identity 
with sequences of A. platys found in dogs from the Philippines 
(JQ894779), Croatia (JQ396431) and Malaysia (JF683610). 
Amplicons obtained in Babesia spp. PCR (400 pb) showed 99% of 
identity with sequences of B. vogeli found in dogs from Colombia 
(JN368081), China (HM590440) and Venezuela (DQ297390). 
Amplicons obtained in L. donovani complex PCR (447pb) showed 
99% of identity with the complete sequence of Leishmania infantum 
(syn. L. chagasi) (AF169138, AF103741, AF169139). Ehrlichia 
canis and A. platys strain Campo Grande-MS 16S rRNA partial 
sequence, B. vogeli strain Campo Grande-MS 18S rRNA partial 
sequences, and L. infantum strain Campo Grande-MS kinetoplast 
DNA partial sequence were deposited in GenBank database 
under access numbers KC989958, KC989957, KC989959 and 
KF695386 respectively.

Discussion

This study demonstrated the occurrence of E. canis, A. platys 
and B. vogeli in L. infantum-seropositive dogs from Campo 
Grande, MS, by molecular and serological techniques. L. infantum 
IFAT confirmed the results of the ELISA test conducted at 
the CZC. On the other hand, only 54 (90%) of the animals

Detection of tick-borne pathogens in dogs from Mato Grosso do Sul

tested positive in the Leishmania spp. PCR assay and 53 in the 
L. donovani complex PCR assay. Although Brazil’s Ministry of Health 
recommends serological assays for the diagnosis of L. infantum 
(BRASIL, 2003), cross-reactivity between Trypanosoma cruzi 
and Leishmania braziliensis-infected patients is well documented 
in the serodiagnosis of leishmaniasis (VEXENAT  et  al., 1996; 
LUCIANO et al., 2009). In our study, cross-reactivity between 
dog serum samples positive to T. cruzi and L. braziliensis could not 
be discarded, since the occurrence of T. cruzi and L. braziliensis 
among dogs is documented in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul 
(POMPILIO et al., 2005; SAVANI et al., 2009; SOUZA et al., 
2009; CORVALAN et al., 2011). One dog that tested positive 
in the Leishmania spp. PCR assay but negative in the PCR assay 
for L. donovani complex could be infected by other Leishmania 
spp. species, i.e., L. braziliensis or L. amazonensis, which have 
been reported previously in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul 
(DORVAL et al., 2006; CORVALAN et al., 2011).

There are a few reports about the occurrence of Babesia spp. 
in dogs from Campo Grande, MS, which are based only on the 
observation of piroplasms in blood smears (SALGADO, 2006). 
Serology is a useful tool for the diagnosis of reservoir hosts for 
Babesia spp., because the parasitemia in dogs naturally infected 
with B. vogeli is usually low (FURUTA et al., 2009). Although 
the molecular detection of B. vogeli in the present study was low 
(3.3%), the overall seroprevalence was 81.6%, suggesting a previous 
exposure to this agent. PCR is considered a highly sensitive and 
specific technique, but its sensitivity is low when samples are 
collected from naturally asymptomatic Babesia-infected dogs 
in the chronic phase of the disease (BOOZER; MACINTIRE, 
2003), when low fluctuations in parasitemia are observed (IRWIN, 
2009). In our study, the presence of dogs seropositive to B. vogeli 
showing negative results for Babesia spp. PCR suggests the 
occurrence of subclinical or chronic phase of the disease in these 
animals. On the other hand, these same dogs could have been 
exposed to B. vogeli previously, maintaining detectable antibody 
levels. After sequencing, the Babesia spp. found in dogs from 
Campo Grande showed 99% of identity with B. vogeli, which 
has already been found in dogs in the Brazilian states of Minas 
Gerais (PASSOS et al., 2005; COSTA-JÚNIOR et al., 2009), 
Pernambuco (RAMOS et al., 2010), Goiás (DUARTE et al., 2011) 
and Mato Grosso (SPOLIDORIO et al., 2011). Serological surveys 
revealed that the prevalence of antibodies to B. vogeli in dogs in 
Brazil ranged from 28.7% (COSTA-JÚNIOR  et  al., 2009) to 
46.4% (VIEIRA et al., 2013). Also, B. gibsoni has been detected 
in dogs in the state of Paraná (TRAPP et al., 2006).

Although the presence of E. canis DNA has already been 
detected in dogs in Campo Grande (DAGNONE et al., 2009), 
the present work showed a high occurrence of seropositive (65%) 
and PCR-positive animals (45%), indicating that this agent 
is widespread among dogs in this city. Thirty percent of dogs 
seropositive to E. canis were negative in the PCR assay, suggesting 
that these animals could be in the subclinical or chronic phase 
of the disease or that they were previously exposed to E. canis. 
Ehrlichia canis is a widespread tick-borne agent of dogs in Brazil 
and has been molecularly detected in several states, e.g., São 
Paulo (NAKAGHI et al., 2008; DAGNONE et al., 2009), Rio 
de Janeiro (MACIEIRA et al., 2005), Paraná (DAGNONE et al., 

2003), Bahia (CARVALHO et al., 2008), Mato Grosso do Sul 
(DAGNONE  et  al., 2009) and Paraíba (TANIKAWA  et  al., 
2013). Antibodies to E. canis have also been detected in almost all 
Brazilian states, with the prevalence of exposure in dogs ranging 
from 4.8% (SAITO  et  al., 2008) to 73% (NAKAGHI  et  al., 
2008). Although E. canis DNA has been detected in humans 
in Venezuela (PEREZ  et  al., 2006; UNVER  et  al., 2001), the 
importance of the parasite as a zoonotic agent remains unknown.

Anaplasma platys has been molecularly detected in dogs in the 
states of from Mato Grosso do Sul (DAGNONE et al., 2009), São 
Paulo (DAGNONE et al., 2009), Pernambuco (RAMOS et al., 
2010) and Paraná (SILVA et al., 2012). The percentage of A. platys 
positive samples by PCR assay in our study (1.6%) was lower than 
that found by Dagnone et al. (2009) (45%) in dogs of Campo 
Grande, MS, probably because all the dogs sampled in the earlier 
study showed clinical signs of tick-borne diseases and the presence 
of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in leucocytes and platelets. 
PCR has shown higher sensitivity in dogs sampled in the acute 
phase of the disease caused by A. platys (DAGNONE et al., 2009).

The occurrence of co-positivity in PCR for B. vogeli and 
E. canis in one dog, and the evidence of exposure to both agents 
(seropositivity for E. canis and B. vogeli in 56.6% of the sampled 
dogs) suggest the transmission of both agents by the same tick 
vector. Cases of co-infection by B. vogeli, E. canis and A. platys 
are frequently found due to the common tick vector of Brazilian 
dogs, R. sanguineus (DAGNONE et al., 2003; NAKAGHI et al., 
2008; OLIVEIRA  et  al., 2008), which can transmit all three 
agents (DANTAS-TORRES, 2008). Moreover, the environmental 
conditions may have contributed to the animals’ exposure to the 
agents, since they lived in the same location (CZC). Studies are 
much needed on the interaction of tick-borne agents and Leishmania 
parasites in the establishment and course of the disease.

In conclusion, this paper described a study of the molecular 
detection of E. canis, A. platys and B. vogeli in L. infantum-
seropositive dogs from Campo Grande, MS. These pathogens should 
be included in the differential diagnosis of dogs with compatible 
clinical signs and hematological abnormalities suggestive of tick-
borne diseases in Campo Grande, MS.
