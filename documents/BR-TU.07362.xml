PEAT-FORMING ENVIRONMENT OF PERMIAN COAL SEAMS FROM THE
FAXINAL COALFIELD (PARANÁ BASIN) IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL, BASED ON

PALYNOLOGY AND PALAEOBOTANY

ABSTRACT – Coal seams from the Faxinal coalfield (Rio Bonito Formation, Lower Permian of Paraná Basin) are
compositionally distinct from other South Brazilian coal palynofloras. The dominance of bisaccate and striate pollen
grains such as Alisporites, Scheuringipollenites, Limitisporites, Vesicaspora and Protohaploxypinus in the palynofloras
reflect a peat-forming plant community composed namely of glossopterids, cordaites and conifers. Subordinate trilete
spores derived from lycopsids, sphenopsids and filicopsids (e.g. Lundbladispora, Punctatisporites, Granulatisporites,
Leiotriletes, Deltoidospora, Calamospora) are less abundant, occurring in variable proportions. Algae-like elements,
commonly found in south Brazilian coal palynofloras (Portalites, Tetraporina, Brazilea and Quadrisporites), are scarce
and Botryococcus was not recorded. This palynological feature as well as the record of abundant woody tissues, cuticles
and other phyterals is quite different from palynoassemblages identified in other southernmost Brazilian coal seams.
The dominance of woody seed plants in the Faxinal peat-forming vegetation, low proportion of pteridophytic plants
and scarcity of algal elements suggest a different peat-forming environment for the Faxinal coal seams compared to other
coals from Brazil that have been studied. By integration of palynological and macrofossil data with available sequence
stratigraphical studies on the coal-bearing strata in south Brazilian Paraná Basin, a landscape unit has been outlined, that
is different from that proposed for the Candiota coalfield. Faxinal coals were interpreted to have accumulated in inland
coastal plain mires, linked to delta fluvial settings, at relatively high sea-level, but under low marine influence.

Key words: Coal palynofloras, peat-forming flora, palaeoecology, Faxinal coalfield, landscape unit, Paraná Basin,
Brazil.

RESUMO – A palinoflora dos carvões da jazida do Faxinal (Formação Rio Bonito, Permiano Inferior, bacia do Paraná)
caracteriza-se por uma composição palinológica distinta daquelas reconhecidas para outros carvões do sul do Brasil. O
predomínio de grãos de pólen bissacados e estriados, como Alisporites, Limitisporites, Scheuringipollenites, Vesicaspora
e Protohaploxypinus reflete a presença de uma vegetação formadora das turfeiras constituída principalmente por
glossopterídeas, cordaites e coníferas. Esporos triletes derivados de licófitas, esfenófitas e filicófitas, abundantes na
maioria das palinofloras dos carvões sul-brasileiros, como Lundbladispora, Punctatisporites, Granulatisporites,
Leiotriletes, Calamospora, Deltoidospora, Cristatisporites e Vallatisporites, ocorrem em baixa proporção. Representantes
do grupo das algas (Botryococcus) e elementos incertae sedis ou acritarcas, comumente identificados nos carvões da
Bacia do Paraná (Portalites, Tetraporina, Brazilea e Quadrisporites), ocorrem em baixíssima frequência. Estas características
palinológicas, associadas à identificação de abundantes fragmentos de lenho, cutículas e outros fiterais relacionados a
glossopterídeas e cordaites, evidenciam significativa diferença na composição da vegetação formadora das turfeiras,
provavelmente originada por mudanças nas condições do paleoambiente. A partir da integração dos dados microflorísticos,
megaflorísticos e paleoecológicos com modelos deposicionais já definidos para sucessões de carvão no sul da Bacia do
Paraná com base em estratigrafia de seqüências, foi reconstruída, de modo tentativo, a unidade de paisagem condicionadora
da acumulação da turfa geradora dos carvões de Faxinal. A unidade de paisagem proposta, diferente daquela indicada para
a jazida de Candiota, é relacionada a áreas mais internas de planície costeira, vinculada à sistema fluvio-deltaico, em nível
relativo de mar alto, porém com influência marinha menos marcada.

INTRODUCTION

Many depositional models of coal formation have been
described in the literature (Stach et al., 1982; McCabe, 1987;
Diessel, 1992; DiMichele &amp;amp; Phillips, 1994; Nowak &amp;amp; Górecka-
Nowak, 1999) often using different kinds of data for the
reconstruction of the original environment. Coal petrography,
palynology, palaeobotany, organic geochemistry, and
sequence stratigraphy are usually the main methods used to
define the features of coal depositional environments. The
palynological composition of coals has been widely applied
to characterize the peat-forming environment, considering
that pollen and spores overwhelmingly derive from the
peatforming flora and thus reflect the compositional changes
that occurred during peat accumulation.

Considering that vegetation is very sensitive to slight
environmental changes, reflected in palaeofloristic
composition, the association of palynological studies with
palaeofloristic data can provide important information on the
ecological preferences of different plant groups, original
edaphic conditions, and mire hydrology, as well as changes
in these variables during the interval of peat formation (Smith,
1962). On the other hand, the interpretation of miospore
succession within coals is based on the assumption that the
miospore-forming plants are autocthonous or

hypoautocthonous and represent a local population of parent
plants.

The most important studies on the peat-forming
vegetation of the South Brazilian coals (Figure 1) were those
of Marques-Toigo &amp;amp; Corrêa da Silva (1984), Guerra-Sommer
et al. (1991) and Corrêa da Silva (1991) which integrated
palynology, palaeobotany and coal petrography in an attempt
to define the main organic constituents of the coals. Their
results demonstrated that these coals have characteristics
that are indicative of an origin in limno-telmatic moors, where
pteridophytic herbaceous and arborescent plant material
accumulated after some transport, promoting
hypoautochthonous coal seams.

On the other hand, sequence stratigraphical studies
applied to the main coal-bearing strata in southernmost Brazil
(Paraná Basin) demonstrated that whereas some coal seams
were predominantly originated in fluvial settings, the most
important coal beds derived from a lagoon-barrier system
linked with a third-order transgressive systems tract,
subdivided into four parasequences sets, each set
representing a major transgressive pulse in the sedimentary
history of the basin (Holz, 1998; Holz &amp;amp; Vieira, 2001; Holz &amp;amp;
Kalkreuth, 2004).

Palynological studies conducted on the most important
coal-bearing strata in the southern Paraná Basin, mainly those

of Ybert (1975), Burjack (1978), Dias-Fabrício (1981), Bortoluzzi
et al. (1980), Cazzulo-Klepzig et al. (1982), Corrêa da Silva et
al. (1984), Marques-Toigo et al. (1984), Picarelli et al. (1987),
Araújo et al. (1985) and Meyer (1999), demonstrated, in a
general way, the presence of rich and diversified palynofloras,
dominated by spores derived from herbaceous and
arborescent lycopsids. Gymnosperm pollen grains appeared
as subordinate components in the palynofloras. In addition,

for the majority of the palynoassemblages, organic-walled
palynomorphs of doubtful botanical affinity related to
algaelike elements or acritarchs were commonly recorded
together with fragments of Botryococcus braunii.

Although this type of palynoassemblage has been
identified for the majority of South Brazilian coals, some
compositional differences, however, have been noted for a
few coal seams, mainly in terms of the relative abundances of
the most important taxa.

Cazzulo-Klepzig (2002) outlined a hypothetical
reconstruction for the landscapes of peat-forming
environments related to the most important coal seams in the
southern Paraná Basin. This study was based on the
composition of the palynofloras, botanical affinity of spores
and pollen grains, habit of the parent plants, environmental
conditions favorable for the growth of the vegetation,
quantitative changes in the palynological content among
distinct coal beds, and the range of tolerance to changes in
salinity shown by algae and algae-like elements. The author
emphasized, however, that although palynology and
palaeobotany are very useful tools for environmental
reconstruction, the limitations of these methods should be
taken into account (e.g.: Di Michele &amp;amp; Phillips, 1994).

For the Candiota coal seams, which represent the most
economically valuable coals in Rio Grande do Sul State (Figure
1), Cazzulo-Klepzig et al. (2005) outlined a tentative
palaeoreconstruction of the peat-forming environment of the
two most important coal seams (lower and upper Candiota
coal seams). For a paleoenvironmental interpretation,
sequence stratigraphical information (Holz, 1988; Holz &amp;amp;
Vieira, 2001; Holz &amp;amp; Kalkreuth, 2004) was integrated with the
palynological and paleobotanical data.

Two distinct scenarios were delineated, related
respectively to high sea-level conditions and low sea-level
conditions. The peats accumulated in paralic conditions,
specifically a lagoon-barrier system, and were influenced by
episodic sea-water floods (Figure 2). Although the lowland
coastal mires could be sporadically flooded, they were
isolated from direct marine influence by a barrier island,
precluding major marine ingressions. Meyer (1999) recorded
the presence of Navifusa and Cymatiosphaera in the Lower
Candiota coal palynofloras and expanded the
paleoenvironmental interpretation for the coal formation.

Focusing on the Charqueadas coalfield, Cazzulo-Klepzig
et al. (1993) noted the strong compositional similarity between
the palynofloras identified and the Candiota coal
palynofloras. The detected changes in the plant-communities
among the distinct coal seams, reflecting palynofloristic
content, were caused by changes in the peat-forming
environment. A palaeoreconstruction of the changing
environment formation was tentatively outlined, characterized
by lateral and vertical organic facies.

For the Faxinal coalfield, the focus of this paper (Figure
1), Guerra-Sommer et al. (1983) provide the only palynological
studies on the coal seams and document, from preliminary
analyses, the palynological content of the coals. These
authors mentioned the presence of spores derived from

Figure 2. Lithostratigraphic profile of the Faxinal coal succession

arborescent lycopsids (Lundbladispora) together with rare
gymnospermous pollen grains (Potonieisporites), although
illustrations of the diagnostic forms were not coincident with
the list of the palynotaxa identified. In addition to miospores,
abundant and wellpreserved woody fragments and epidermal
remains (cuticles) were identified as belonging to
gymnosperms. In a tonstein layer interbedded in the
uppermost coal seam, a rich compressed megaflora
represented by leaves, branches and reproductive structures
of glossopterids as well as leaves of cordaites, sometimes
preserved as foliar tuffs, was also recorded (Guerra-Sommer,
1983, 1988). Results from analyses of the glossopterid
epidermal remains indicate xeromorphic patterns. This author
emphasized that remains of cordaites, despite being
abundantly represented in the Faxinal megaflora, essentially
in the tonstein, are poorly represented in other South Brazilian
antracophylic floras.

Together with the pteridophytic spores, Dias &amp;amp; Guerra-
Sommer (1994) mentioned for these palynofloras a
significant amount of Maculatasporites minimus and
Maculatasporites gondwanensis, considered by some
authors as related to fungi, and abundant pollen grains with
botanical affinity with gymnosperms, mainly cordaites,
conifers and glossopterids. This palynological composition,
very similar to that found in the coal seams, is not a common
characteristic of the South Brazilian coal palynofloras.
Results from petrographic and geochemical analyses
(Guerra-Sommer et al., 1983) have indicated a significant
amount of woody plant material, suggesting growth of the
peat-forming vegetation in a telmatic environment (forest
moor).

Based on petrological analyses of the Faxinal coals, Henz
(1986) defined the organic matter as derived from woody
material, mainly represented by vitrinite, with subordinate
exinite and inertinite constituents, which were accumulated
in a telmatic environment (forest moor or peat-forming forest
vegetation sensu Hacquebard &amp;amp; Donaldson, 1969). The
maceral composition of coals indicated reducing conditions
and a shallow water table.

Data from sequence stratigraphical studies of the Faxinal
coal-bearing sequenceare very important for a
paleoecological interpretation, but to date have not been
published.

The present study takes into account the peculiar
composition of the palynofloras, reflecting a different type
of peat-forming vegetation than that of other well
recognized coal palynofloras from the Paraná Basin. This
study was also modulated in order to provide an accurate
p a l y n o l o g i c a l  r e v i s i o n  a i m e d  a t  r e v i e w i n g  a n d
characterizing qualitatively and quantitatively the
palynofloristic content as well as defining the peat-forming
plant-communities related to the Faxinal coal seams.
Additional objectives were to interpret the environmental
conditions of peat-accumulation and to reconstruct
tentatively the landscape under which Faxinal peats
accumulated and differed from the other known Brazilian
coals.

GEOLOGICAL SETTING

The Paraná Basin is a large intracratonic basin, located in
the central-east part of the South American Platform, covering
a surface area of about 1,700,000 km2. According to Milani et
al. (1998) the basin comprises six stratigraphic
megasequences bounded by interregional unconformities.
The Carboniferous-Early Triassic megasequence includes the
major coal-bearing strata related to isolated coalfields
cropping out from the southernmost part of Rio Grande do
Sul State through Santa Catarina State, to the northern portion
of Paraná State (Figure 1). The overall transgressive trend at
the top of Itararé Group, the basal sedimentary unit in the
study area, is essentially represented by marine deposits and
points to a relative rise in sea level rise that was later
interrupted during the Rio Bonito deposition. Coal
occurrences are historically assigned to the Rio Bonito
Formation, a fluvial to marine sandstone and shale- rich
lithostratigraphic unit of Early Permian age.

The Faxinal coalfield is located in Guaíba city (UTM N665,5;
E432,7). Prior stratigraphical and sedimentological studies (Paim
et al., 1983; Piccoli et al., 1983) linked the depositional
conditions to the presence of alluvial fans that blocked the
fluvial sedimentation creating favorable areas for organic matter
accumulation. Applying sequence stratigraphy methods, Holz
et al. (2000) and Holz &amp;amp; Kalkreuth (2004) developed a model
for palaeoenvironmental evolution of the coal-bearing strata
of the South Brazilian coalfields. In this model, the most
economically important coal seams occur within the transgressive
tract of Sequence 2 as part of a barrier-lagoon system.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

For the present study, samples were collected from three
coal beds in the Faxinal coal-bearing strata, as indicated in
the columnar profile (Figure 2:  P1, P2 and P3). Extraction of
the palynomorphs from samples was carried out using a
routine process developed at the Geological Survey of Canada
(GSC). Samples were processed in Schulze’s solution (65%
nitric acid, HNO3) saturated with potassium chloride (KClO3),
and neutralized in potassium hydroxide (KOH), enabling the
rapid maceration of palynomorphs. Only samples from coal
seams 1 and 2 were taken for the study. Palynomorphs from
coal seam 3 were poorly preserved.

A visual count of a minimum of 200 miospores was
undertaken to determine the relative proportions of miospore
taxa. Palynological slides are stored at the Department of
Geology of the Geological Survey of Canada.

Assignments of dispersed spores and pollen grains to their
respective parent-plant groups, such as lycopsids, ferns,
sphenopsids, glossopterids, cordaites and conifers, were based
on compilations of Balme (1995) and Quadros et al. (1995).
Paleoecological interpretation for the other organic-walled
palynomorphs followed mainly concepts adopted by Tiwari et
al. (1994), Batten &amp;amp; Grenfell (1996), Guy-Ohlson (1992),
Cazzulo-Klepzig (2001), and accurate criteria of other authors
to infer the paleoecology of Botryococcus mentioned below.

PALYNOLOGY

There is strong similarity in the palynological results from
the main coal seams analysed, with a dominance of bisaccate
pollen grains produced by arborescent vegetation, with the
following species: Alisporites australis,
Scheuringipollenites medius, S. minimus, Limitisporites
rectus and Vesicaspora wilsonii. Within this group,
Scheuringipollenites and Alisporites are the most abundant
bisaccate pollen found (more than 55%). These pollen grains
reflect the remarkable presence of glossopterids in the ancient
vegetation (Gould &amp;amp; Delevoryas, 1977).

Monosaccate forms are common (around 12%) and show
a low species diversity being represented by only three
species: Cannanoropollis korbaensis, Potoniesporites
braziliensis, and Plicatipollenites malabarensis. Among
these, Cannanoropollis is proportionally the most abundant
in the assemblage. The number of monosaccate genera
identified in the palynoflora indicates that the cordaites also
constituted an important component in the
palaeoplantcommunities.

Striate pollen grains, reflecting the presence of conifers
(more than 12%) are indicated by the record of distinct species
of Protohaploxypinus, mainly Protohaploxypinus limpidus,
Protohaploxypinus hartii, and Protohaploxypinus spp.

The number of trilete spores is relatively low and
represents only a small proportion of the miospore fraction
(around 17%), which is the opposite of the palynological
content in the majority of other South Brazilian coals. The
most common spores are derived from sphenopsids and
filicopsids (around 10%): Calamospora sahariana,
Calamospora plicata, Convolutispora candiotensis,
Deltoidospora directa, Granulatisporites, Granulatisporites
micronodosus, Leiotriletes virkki, Punctatisporites gretensis
and Murospora torifera. The genus Lundbladispora, the
most abundant spore in South Brazilian coals, is rare (3%).
Palynological studies of the tonstein interlayered in the
uppermost coal seam indicated a strong similarity between
the two palynofloras.

Organic-walled palynomorphs of uncertain botanical
affinity (incertae sedis or acritarchs), commonly found in the
coal palynofloras of the southern Paraná Basin, such as
Portalites, Tetraporina, Brazilea, Quadrisporites and
Maculatasporites, are extremely rare in the Faxinal coals (less
than 2%). Cazzulo-Klepzig (2001) emphasized the
palaeoecological significance of these palynomorphs for
peat-environment reconstruction, particularly their relation
to the gradient from fresh, to brackish, to marine conditions.
The coccal algae Botryococcus, considered as a good
palaeoecological marker, is commonly found in other coal
seams but it was not recorded in the Faxinal coals. This
microalga has been supposed to be more widespread in
lagoonal and lacustrine environments with low salinity (Guy-
Ohlson, 1992), although Botryococcus has been recognized
as having a wider tolerance to salinity compared to other
microfossils (Grice et al., 1998; Zippi, 1998; Vincent &amp;amp; Tyson,
1999; Versteegh et al. 2004).

The palynological content, dominated by pollen derived
from arborescent vegetation, and characterized by a scarcity
of algal forms, demonstrates significant compositional
differences in relation to the coal palynofloras identified in
other South Brazilian coals (Cazzulo-Klepzig, 2002). This
paleofloristic feature, showing a dominance of woody tissues,

tracheids and cuticular fragments was also previously noted
in the petrological analyses of Guerra-Sommer et al. (1983)
and Henz (1986).

These differences could be caused by topological
features or different stages in paleoecological succession
(Cairncross &amp;amp; Caddle, 1998; Glasspool, 2003). In relation to

the parent plants, although it is possible to outline the
probable peat-forming vegetation on the basis of the
palynological composition, it is important to take into
account that whenever the problem of dispersed spores
and pollen is considered, a fossil plant community tends to
be underestimated (Traverse, 1988; Nichols, 1995).
Cairncross &amp;amp; Caddle (1998) and Glasspool (2003) describe
the complex relationship between the proportion of spores
and pollen grains relative to the abundance of their parent
plants, considering that the palynological record may not
provide a true representation of the types and relative
abundance of plants within peat-forming vegetation.
Distinct factors such as differential spore and pollen
production, introduction into the mires of extraneous,
regional pollen grains, and oxidation of the palynological
material, can lead to a misrepresentation of the original mire
vegetation. On the other hand, organic-walled palynomorphs
commonly found in South Brazilian coals, such as algaelike
forms and acritarchs, can be often estimated due to different
preparation methods (a large-mesh size allows small
microfossils to be lost), transport, and potential for
preservation. Figure 3 shows a comparison between the
relative abundance of the most important plant groups
reflected in coal palynofloras of Faxinal and Upper and Lower
Candiota.

PALEOENVIRONMENTAL INTERPRETATION

Different conditions for the peat-formation can be inferred
for the Candiota and Charqueadas coalfields, compared to
those of Faxinal (Cazzulo-Klepzig et al., 1993, 2005).
Considering the peculiar palynological and palaeobotanical
features shown by the coals of Faxinal, the palynofloras,
which are dominated by glossopterids, small cordaites and
conifers, have a low representation of pteridophytic spores,
a small fraction of algae-like forms and absence of
Botryococcus. On the other hand, the abundance of woody
plant material and cuticular fragments belonging to
arborescent plants (mainly cordaites and glossopterids),
found together with palynological assemblages that reflect
the same vegetation (Guerra-Sommer et al., 1983), emphasize
the presence of different peat-forming plant communities in
relation to those recorded for other South Brazilian coal seams.
Although the cordaites, glossopterids and some conifers
have been linked to mesophytic-xerophytic environments,
for the palaeoenvironment interpretation of Faxinal
coalbearing strata, it is important to recognize some of their
palaeoecological features , in order to explain their presence
in areas adjacent to the mire. According to Guerra-Sommer
(1988), the epidermal morphology of the cordaites identified
in the Faxinal coals could represent a mechanism to prevent
dessication or a response to changes in compositional
features of the soil, such as a deficit in N or in chemical
characteristics of the available water in the mires. Such
physiological and morphological features could have
permitted these plants to partition the ecological resources
of the mire.

Cridland &amp;amp; Morris (1963) and Falcon-Lang (2005)
mentioned the very large ecological amplitude of cordaites
and the possibility of these plants representing mangrove
trees. These papers discussed the possibility that the
cordaites occasionally experienced brackish incursions and
adapted to elevated salinity by modification of the rooting
system and leaves and demonstrated that some species grew
in coastal plains. Small cordaites, flourishing in
marineinfluenced coastal habitat, in close proximity to the
brackish sea coast, adapted to periodically submerged
conditions. In the same way, arborescent lycopsids could
also tolerate these palaeoecological features (Habib &amp;amp; Growth,
1967). According to Raymond (1988), some cordaites could
live in lowlands, co-occurring with calamiteans, tree-ferns
and lycopsids, typical of hygrophylous-mesophylous
environments.

According to DiMichele &amp;amp; Aronson (1992), hydraulic
and energetic competition of phothosynthetic and
r e p r o d u c t i v e  a c t i v i t i e s  m a y  h a v e  m a d e  P a l e o z o i c
glossopterids, more vulnerable to fluctuations in water
supply, influencing their occupation of drier areas adjacent
to the mire. Knoll &amp;amp; Niklas (1987) concluded that
xeromorphic structures shown by some glossopterids, as
identified in the Faxinal coal seam (Guerra-Sommer et al.,
1992), can be indicative that they originally grew in higher
lands. In the Permian, they could have migrated to
peatforming environments in lowlands, co-occurring with
lycopsids, ferns and sphenopsids. The high representation
of arborescent glossopterids and cordaites with deciduous
leaves and the relatively low abundance of herbaceous
plants with perennial leaves in the megaflora of Faxinal are
indicative of an hypoauthochtonous taphocenose (Birks &amp;amp;
Birks, 1980). On the other hand, the low compositional
variation of the Faxinal megaflora also reflected in the
palynoflora, could indicate that the habitat in which these
plants grew were intrinsically stressful conditions
(DiMichele et al., 1985).

The Faxinal mire landscape was likely located in a more
inland area than that of Candiota. In Faxinal, coal was formed
in wet forest swamp environments, situated in a marine
influenced lower delta plain setting, presenting favorable
conditions to the development of arborescent vegetation
(Figure 5). This is in opposition to the conditions under which
Candiota and Charqueadas coals formed. The dominance of
arborescent vegetation, low proportion of arborescent
lycopsids and scarce record of algal elements define this
scenario (Figure 6).
