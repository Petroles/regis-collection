GEOLOGICAL CONTROL OF Podocnemis expansa AND
Podocnemis unifilis NESTING AREAS IN RIO JAVAÉS,

BANANAL ISLAND, BRAZIL

Paulo Dias FERREIRA JÚNIOR1 &amp;amp; Paulo de Tarso Amorim CASTRO2

ABSTRACT - The distribution of the nests of Podocnemis expansa (Amazon turtle) and
Podocnemis unifilis (yellow-spotted side neck turtle) along the point bars of the Javaés River in
Bananal Island, demonstrates a clear preference of these chelonians for differentiated geological
environments, in respect to the morphology, grain size or height of the nests in relation to the
level of the river. The topographical distribution and the differences in the grain size of the sedi-
ments that compose the point bars of the river, originated from the multiple sedimentary pro-
cesses, and make possible the creation and separation of different nesting environments. Each
turtle species takes advantage of the place that presents physiographic characteristics appropri-
ate to the hatching success of their eggs. The superposition of the P. expansa and P. unifilis nest
placement areas is rare. The P. expansa nests are concentrated on the central portion of the beaches
where successive depositional sedimentary events produced sandy banks more than 3.3 m above
the river water level. The P. unifilis nests are distributed preferentially in the upstream and down-
stream portions along the point bars where the sandy deposits rarely surpass 1.5 m at the moment
of laying. P. expansa nests located on the beaches of fine to medium sized sand hatch in a mean
of 68 days, while those incubated on beaches of medium to coarse sand size take a mean of 54
days to hatch.

RESUMO - A distribuição das covas de Podocnemis expansa (tartaruga-da-amazônia) e Podocnemis
unifilis (tracajá) ao longo das barras em pontal do rio Javaés na Ilha do Bananal, mostra uma clara
preferência destes quelônios por ambientes geológicos diferenciados, seja em relação à morfologia,
constituição granulométrica ou altura das covas em relação ao nível do rio. A compartimentação
topográfica e as diferenças no tamanho dos sedimentos que compõem as barras em pontal, oriundas
de processos sedimentares múltiplos, possibilita a criação e separação de ambientes de nidificação
distintos. Cada espécie de quelônio se aproveita do local que apresenta características fisiográficas
apropriadas à incubação de seus ovos, sendo rara a superposição das áreas de nidificação de P.
expansa e P. unifilis. As covas de P. expansa concentram-se na porção central das praias onde
sucessivos eventos de deposição produziram bancos arenosos com uma altura superior a 3,3 m
em relação ao nível do rio. As covas de P. unifilis distribuem-se, preferencialmente, nas porções
montante e jusante das barras em pontal onde os depósitos arenosos raramente ultrapassam 1,5
m de altura no momento da desova. Covas de P. expansa localizadas nas praias de areia fina a
média eclodem, em média, em 68 dias ao passo que aquelas incubadas em praias de areia média
a grossa levam, em média, 54 dias para eclodirem.

INTRODUCTION

The Amazon turtle (Podocnemis
expansa) and the “tracajá” (yellow-spotted side
neck turtle, Podocnemis unifilis) are the most
common fresh water chelonians of the
Tocantins-Araguaia basin. These species belong
to the Pelomedusidae family, which has five
species distributed throughout the northern and
central western regions in Brazil (Iverson,
1992). In the Tocantins and Araguaia rivers, the
Amazon turtle’s and the tracajá’s nesting sea-
son extends from June to December.
During this period the level of the main and
tributary rivers fall drastically, exposing the
sandy banks which are used for nest placement.
The geological aspects of these sandy banks,
commonly denominated beaches, vary
along the rivers being controlled by the charac-
teristics of the substratum and hydrological
regime.

The distribution of the P. expansa and
P. unifilis nests along the sandy banks allows
the characterization of environments appropri-
ate to each of the species. In spite of the mor-
phological differences of the sandy banks of
several places, it is possible to recognize geo-
logical conditioning common to the turtle nest-
ing areas (Ferreira Júnior 2003). In general, it
is observed that the P. expansa prefers
the   central part of the beaches, where the
height relative to the river water level surpasses
3.3 m on the date of the laying. The P. unifilis
chooses upstream and downstream the areas
of the beaches, where the sandy deposits usu-
ally are located 1.5 m above the river level,
on the day of the laying. The superposition of
the oviposition areas between these species
is rare.

As P. expansa and P. unifilis present
sexual determination dependent on the incuba-
tion temperature (Alho et al., 1985; Souza
&amp;amp; Vogt, 1994,;Valenzuela et al., 1997) it is
important to know the nesting environment
that, together with the variations of the me-
teorological conditions (i.e. rainfall, exposure to
sunlight and the temperature of the air) will
determine the temperature to which the eggs
will be submitted. The hydric and thermal sur-
roundings of the turtle nests can be influenced
by several environmental and ecological factors,
such as the mineralogical composition (Milton
et al., 1997) and the sediments grain size (Souza

&amp;amp; Vogt, 1994; Ferreira Júnior, 2003), the al-
bedo (Hays et al., 2001), the nest
depth (Burger, 1976; Wilhoft et al., 1983), the
nest placement (Vogt &amp;amp; Bull, 1984; Whitmore
&amp;amp; Dutton, 1985; Horrocks &amp;amp; Scott, 1991;
Hays &amp;amp; Speakman, 1993), the vegetational
cover (Vogt &amp;amp; Bull, 1984; Janzen, 1994;
Janzen &amp;amp; Morjan, 2001) and the date of lay-
ing (Vogt &amp;amp; Bull, 1982; Mrosovsky et al.,
1984).

In this work, the geological characteris-
tics of the P. expansa and P. unifilis nesting areas
in the Javaés River, right margin of the Bananal
Island in the state of Tocantins will be
analyzed. From August 3 to December 15,
2000, we collected information about six
beaches in which had 339 P. expansa and 487
P. unifilis nests were labeled. All of these
beaches can be classified as point bars. Their
sediment grain size concentrates in the sand size
with very low mud content. The mineralogical
composition is basically formed of quartz and
feldspar.

Location and physiographic
aspects of the area

The studied area is located at the mar-
gins of the Javaés River, which is the eastern
border of Bananal Island, the largest fluvial is-
land of the world. The northern part
of the Bananal island forms the National
Park of Araguaia, where the Center of Conser-
vation and Management of Reptiles and Am-
phibians (RAN), an organ linked to the
Brazilian    Institute of Renewable Natural Re-
sources (IBAMA), has a field base that sup-
ports  management, research and protection
activities   for P. expansa and P. unifilis.
(Figure 1) during the   laying, incubation and
hatching season.

The climatic seasonality is remarkable,
with a rainy season going from September to
March and a dry season from April to Sep-
tember. The total annual rain is around 1750
mm (IBAMA, 1995). Due to this rainfall dis-
tribution, the level of the Javaés River has ex-
treme oscillations. During the dry season, the
point bars emerge and they are used by turtles
and birds (black skimmer Rynchops nigra and
larged-billed tern Phaetusa simplex) as nesting
sites. Rainfall close to the riverhead can cause
small and fast rises (“repiquetes”) in the level
of the Javaés and Araguaia rivers.

Because the extensive sandy banks used
by the turtles are located inside the channel,
there is no vegetational cover. The riparian
forest that surrounds the Javaés River
interferes very little in the environment of the
beach. During the hottest part of the day, most
of the nests receive direct sunlight. Few
of them which are located at the limit of the
beach and forest are shaded at the end of the
afternoon.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Six  beaches have been chosen, namely
Canguçu, Jaburu, Comprida, Marreca, Coco
and Murici are located close to the RAN/
IBAMA field base. These beaches have the
largest concentration of P. expansa and P. unifilis
nests in the Araguaia National Park. Searching
for nests is done by members of the research
teams and by the agents of IBAMA. Every
morning the beaches are spanned, looking for
tracks left by the turtles  in previous night. The
tracks are followed until the nests are located
and labeled with numbered sticks.

During the monitoring of the laying sea-
son, it was decided not to label the nests of P.
unifilis in the Marreca and Murici beaches.
Both of them have fine sand and it is hard to
locate nests there, since wind action frequently
obscures the turtle tracks. However, the
Jaburu and Comprida beaches that are also
formed    by fine sand were monitored because
they are  located close to the IBAMA field
base. In this case, the travel time to the beaches
is so short to permit the observation of some
P. unifilis tracks before the wind
obliterates them.

The mapping of the beaches was done
on a scale of 1:1000 using theodolite, compass
and tape measure. This scale allowed the rep-
resentation of the main beach morphology and
channel features, as well as the plotting of all
the turtle nests. The mapping was accom-
plished in the month of October, when the ovi-
position had been finished, in order not to in-
terfere in the laying process. The height of the
nests was measured with the aid of a Kern
level with a precision of 5 mm. The measure-
ments were made in order to define two height
types:

The height on the laying date, which
reflects the topographical conditions found by
the turtles during the oviposition.

The maximum height of the nests, aim-
ing the establishment of a common pattern
among the several beaches, with respect to the
topographical conditions.

The maximum height of the nests was
registered on November 1st, when the Javaés
River reached its lowest depth. On this day,
the Javaés River depth was taken and it al-
lowed comparisons among the heights of the
nests in all the beaches. The level of the Javaés
River was taken daily close to the IBAMA
base from August to December, during the nest
monitoring period.

As the beaches are composed of sedi-
ments, generally poorly selected and disposed
in layers, samples were collected close to the
material that recovers the nests and which was
homogenized during the closing of the nests by
the turtle females. Three hundred and twelve
samples of sediments were submitted to the
granular analysis according to the scale of Folk/
Wentworth (Table 1).

Table 1 – Granulometric fractions used in the analyses of 312 samples of sediments collected in
the nests of P. expansa and P. unifilis. Dimensions are given in mm.

Student’s t-test was used in the analy-
sis of the variations of the height, incubation
duration and depth of the nests between P.
expansa and P. unifilis. Variance analysis
(ANOVA) has been used for determination of
the variations of the incubation duration along
the beaches. Linear regression has been used in

the determination of the grain size influence of
the sediments on the incubation duration.
All statistical analysis was performed accord-
ing   to Zar (1998). Significance has been ac-
cepted at a level of 5%. The data of the mean
will be presented followed ± SD (standard
deviation).

Figure 2 gives the terminology of the
beaches used in this work. Here geomorpho-
logic and topographic criteria were used. The
length of the point bars is measured in its larg-
est extension, parallel to the channel.

The width of the point bars is the maximum
width taken perpendicularly to the channel.
The analysis of the height of the dunes follows
the recommendations of Ashley (1990)
(Table 2).

Figure 2 – Terminology used and features collected in mapping of the Javaés River point bars.
A: Margin or internal part of the point bar, close to the forest. B: External margin of the point
bar in contact with the river. C: The hatched part indicates the high beach points, generated by
the migration and amalgamation of several sandy deposits. There are dunes of small and me-
dium size. The main nesting is by P. expansa. D: Low part of the beach with heights under 1.5
m and normally used as nesting site by the P. unifilis. E: “Boiadouro”, representing the deepest
points of the rivers where the turtles float and wait for the adequate moment to exit for the
nesting. 1: Channel chute bars – sandy deposits with a lobete form. They generally develop in
the downstream portion of the point bar and they constitute one of the highest sites of the
beach. They are used as nesting sites by P. expansa. 2: Abrupt front part constituted by the
amalgamation of several large-sized dunes. This feature is named accretionary dune front by
Ashworth et al. (2000). It divides the beach in two distinct topographical regions. 3: Crest of
a large-sized dune. 4: Crest of a small and medium sized-dune. 5: Temporary ponds generated
in front of the dunes. 6: Trough located in front of the large-sized dunes that connect the deep-
est points of the river to the nesting sites. They are used as access way by P. expansa. 7: Path
covered by P. expansa during the nesting.

RESULTS

All the beaches that were studied in the
Javaés River can be classified as point
bars that, according to Levey (1978) are sedi-
ments deposited along the internal part of the
meander occupying the area of the
channel between    the thalweg and the inferior
limit of    the  floodplain. The dimensions of
the point bars depend on their positioning,

with the   dimensions on the left margin
being smaller than those on the right
margin   (Table 3). The height of the  nests of
P. expansa    approximately indicates the height
of the  beaches. According to the   average val-
ues it can be observed that,   in    the place
chosen   for nesting by P. expansa,   the
beaches   of the  left margin are higher
than the ones of the right margin
(Table 4).

Table 3 – Dimensions of the point bars of the Javaés River used for nesting by P. expansa in the
studied area. The length of the point bar is measured in its largest extension, parallel to the
channel, and the width is taken in the maximum point perpendicularly to the channel (see
Figure 2). The width refers to the extreme point of the beach

There is a minimum required height for
the nesting (Figure 3a). Each species chooses
an area with a suitable height range relative to
the level of the Javaés River in the date of the
laying (t = 25.74, df = 520, p &amp;lt;0.001). The
data suggest that 50% of the nests of P. expansa

are between 250 and 329 cm high at the
date of the laying. This condition excludes the
areas upstream, downstream and close to
the margin of the river. The P. unifilis behavior
is different and the height of 50% of the
nests varies from 48 to 126 cm at the



451Geological control of turtles nesting...

date of the laying. This situation is found
upstream and downstream parts of the beaches
and also in the external portions of the
point bars.

The depth of the nests varies between
the species (t = 77.13, df = 483, p&amp;lt;
0.001). The nests of P. unifilis being shallower
(x = 15.6 ± 1.95 cm, n = 207) than the

ones  of P. expansa (x = 60.4 ± 8.17 cm, n =
278)  (Figure 3b).

The incubation duration – considered
here as the period between the laying
and  the hatchling emergence from the
nest – varies  significantly among the
species (t = 25.19,   df = 331, p &amp;lt;0.001)
(Figure 3c).

For P. expansa there is an outstanding
difference between the incubation
duration along the beaches (F5,265 = 26.94, p&amp;lt;
0.001) (Table 5, Figure 4a). The beaches
of fine   to medium sand size like Jaburu,
Comprida, Marreca and Murici present
an average   incubation duration of 63.5 ± 7.38
days,   while in those of medium to coarse

sand such  as  Canguçu  and    Coco  the
incubation duration is of 54.4 ± 5.05
days.

The incubation duration of P. unifilis
does not vary significantly along the
beaches (F3,58 = 0.92, p = 0,4351) and it has
an average of 79.8 ± 6.43 days (Table 6,
Figure 6).

Possible sources of influence on the
incubation duration show significant differences
between the species. The nest grain size
(F5,265 = 9.05, R

2 = 0.2009, p &amp;lt;0.001) and
the nests height, in the date of the laying
(F1,238 = 84,10, R

2 = 0.2611, p &amp;lt;0.001), as
well as the maximum height registered in
November 1st (F1.238 = 103.82, R

2 = 0.2755,

p &amp;lt;0.001), affected the incubation duration
of P. expansa. They did not show an influence
on P. unifilis incubation time (Table 6).
The depth of the nest affects the incubation
duration of P. unifilis (F1.54 = 5.30, R

2 = 0.0895,
p = 0.0251) and it does not interfere in P.
expansa (F 1.257 = 0.89, R

2 = 0.0025, p =
0.3451).

Table 6 – Linear regression analysis of variables that can affect the incubation duration of
P. expansa and P. unifilis. The grain size refers to the granulometric fractions of medium and
fine sand.

It was possible to delineate two groups
of beaches with different characteristics from
the grain size analysis of samples collected in
the nests of P. expansa (221 samples) and
P. unifilis (92 samples). The Jaburu, Marreca,
Murici, and Comprida beaches present
finer sediments, well selected and concentrated
in the fine and medium sand fractions.
The other group is formed by Canguçu
and Coco beaches where the sediments
are coarse, poorly selected, and they are
distributed in the very coarse, coarse, medium,
and fine sand fractions (Table 7). The content
of mud in all the six beaches is small and
restricted to temporary ponds at the
trough  of the dunes. The maximum volume of
clay registered was 6.08%, the mean being
0.12% ± 0.38.

Data on the monitoring provided
by IBAMA show the distribution of the
nests of P. expansa since the implementation
of the project in 1990. The P. expansa usually
chose the beaches of the right margin
(Figure 5).

The point bars differ not only for their
dimensions and grain size, but each margin
presents its own geological characteristics.
The point bars of the left margin are shorter
and higher than those of the right margin
(Tables 3 and 4). In general, the grain size of
the sediments that compose the beaches of the
right margin is coarse than those of the left

Figure 5 – Number of P. expansa nests per year of each studied beach from 1999 to 2001.



455Geological control of turtles nesting...

Beaches of the left margin

Jaburu Beach

The Jaburu beach historically presents
the smallest number of nesting of P. expansa
(Figure 5); in 2000 only eight nests were regis-
tered. The P. expansa chooses the highest points
in the center of the beach close to the internal
limit of the point bars (Figure 6). The highest
nest is placed on a channel chute bar in the
downstream portion of the beach.

The nests of P. unifilis are predomi-
nantly found in the upstream and downstream
parts of the Jaburu beach. The nests are lo-
cated mainly close to the base of the dunes.
On the nesting date the nests are usually lo-
cated in sand lower than 1.5 m in height (x =
132 ± 100.2 cm). In the center of the beach,
close to the external margin (close to the water
line), the nests of P. unifilis are located where
the height is lower.

Marreca Beach

Channel chute bars with its typical
lobed geometry occur in the downstream por-
tion of the Jaburu and Marreca beaches. The
subsequent part of these bars has bushes, which
helps its fixation. Marreca beach (Figure 7), like
the other point bars of the Javaés River, has
its downstream internal limit formed by a
scarp which is formed by erosion due to sec-
ondary channels flow during the flood period.
Inside these channels the chute bars are de-
velop. It is common to find nests of
P. expansa in the top of the chute bars that
frequently constitute the highest portion of the
point bars. In the Marreca beach four nests of
P. expansa were found in the top of the chute
bars while in the Jaburu beach only two nests
were found.

Murici Beach

Murici beach has a concentration of 26
nests in a small area of about 1 ha (Figure 8).
The upstream and downstream portion of the
Murici beach and the places close to the exter-

nal margin are avoided by the P. expansa, be-
cause the height in these places is very low,
under 1.5 m.

Murici beach presents a pattern of dis-
tribution of chelonian nests similar to Jaburu
and Marreca beaches. There is a continuous in-
crease in the height of the beach towards the
center portion of the point bar in a “slope”
pattern.

In Jaburu, Marreca and Murici beaches
the exit of the P. expansa happens always in
specific points in the troughs of the dunes,
which act as a connection between the deepest
parts of the river and the beaches. The path
followed by the turtles, marked by their tracks,
describes a path upstream as well as down-
stream, with no apparent preferential direction.
P. expansa tracks are not found on the abrupt
margins of the beach, where the declivity is
high.

Beaches of the right margin

Canguçu Beach

Canguçu beach marks the upstream limit
where the nesting of P. expansa in significant
numbers. Above this beach the Javaés River
becomes shallower, frequently less than 30 cm
deep, and the beaches become lower with rare
high elevations points. This fact preclude
P. expansa nestsing. On the other hand, the
P. unifilis is common upstream Canguçu beach,
in spite of being not as abundant as in the
study area.

When the water level of the Javaés River
lowered during the dry season extensive sandy
banks in the center portion of Canguçu beach
emerged. These deposits subdivide the
“boiadouro” (popular denomination of the
deepest points of the rivers where the chelo-
nian await for the adequate moment to exit for
the nesting – Figure 2) in two parts. These
parts are linked by a narrow channel. P. expansa
emerge from “boiadouro” through this channel
to the beach. P. expansa do not nest on the part
of the beach in front of the sandbanks portion
near the “boiadouro”.

459Geological control of turtles nesting...

Canguçu beach can be divided in two
parts (Figure 9). a) Upstream – it is formed
by an extensive area characterized by the curved
line of the point bar. The accretionary dune front
is oriented at a low angle in respect to the chan-
nel direction. It is separated from the down-
stream part by a topographical high area which
had 23 nests of P. expansa, along 32 ha. Dur-
ing the dry season, erosive processes occur in
the upstream portion of the beach where the
curvature of the channel is more pronounced.
As a result of the erosive processes a 1m high
scarp at the external margin of the beach is
formed. This scarp acts as a barrier for the P.
expansa and P. unifilis to exit from water to
beach in this area. b) Downstream – there is a
narrow, long part of the beach, without pro-
nounced topographical high, where the dunes
crests is in high angle with respect to the chan-
nel direction. The height of the beach increases
slowly and gradually towards the internal part
of the point bar. The arrangement of the dunes
in high angle favors the development of sev-
eral access channels in their trough. The nest-
ing of P. expansa take place in the internal
margin of the beach close to the forest. Cocal
channel has the largest number of nests of P.
expansa. It has water only during the high water
season, when the Javaés River winds its way
through its extensive floodplain and creates
alternative paths for water flow (Figure 1). In
this place of about 4 ha, 33 nests of P. expansa
were found. The nests of P. unifilis are distrib-
uted throughout the nesting area and concen-
trate close to the base of the dunes.

Comprida Beach

It can be divided in two parts, due to
the complexity of the deposits and the con-
centration of the nests. A narrow sandy strip,
up to 10 m wide and 250 m long, makes the
connection between the upstream and down-
stream domains, submerged after the beginning
of November (Figure 10). a) Upstream – it is
marked by channel chute bars that apparently
have been deposited through the interaction of
the flow of the Javaés and Riozinho rivers.
Shrub growth stabilizes the sand deposits of
the channel chute bars. There were four P.
expansa nests and only one P. unifilis nest found

in this habitat. b) Downstream – it is a shelf
formed by the migration and overposition of
several dunes with crests in a high angle with
respect to the channel direction. It is a well
marked topographical unevenness. In this place,
in 1999, a large nesting of P. expansa was reg-
istered, with about 120 nests. At the end of
the point bar there are several channel chute
bars that are responsible for the largest heights
registered on the beach.

The P. expansa took advantage of the
countless existing access channels in the trough
of the dunes in order to reach the beach. Fifty-
five nests of P. unifilis are distributed in the
upstream part of this domain, where the height
of the point bar is up to 2 m high. The nests
concentrate mainly at the base of the dunes.
The access to the nesting place is done, fre-
quently, from the channels located in the trough
of these dunes. There is not a specific point
through which a great number of turtles ascend
to the beach.

Coco Beach

It is a large point bar developed in a
meander on the right margin of the Javaés River
(Table 3). It  had the largest number of P.
expansa and P. unifilis nests in 2000 (Figure
11). The upstream portion shows evidence of
recent deposition, emerging for the first time
in 2000. The amalgamation of the deposits is
not verified and as a consequence, the height
of the nests of P. unifilis registered is below 46
± 5.94 cm at the time of the laying (n = 22)
and 108 ± 8.52 cm in November 1st, when the
Javaés River was at its smallest level. Most of
the nests of P. unifilis are located on crest of
the dunes in this area. There are nests close to
the base of the dunes, and not just on the crest
of the dunes  in places where the height of the
beach is higher.

The downstream part is plain, includ-
ing dunes of small size spaced in a high angle
with respect to the direction of the river. Since
amalgamation of the deposits generated by the
migration of the dunes does not happen, the
heights are modest. In this case there is only
one P. unifilis nest. In November the rising of
the Javaés River caused the fast inundation of
almost all the nesting area.

The dunes have the crests oriented obliquely with respect to the 
Javaés River direction. The amalgamation of the deposits takes 
place and, consequently, the height of the beach increases, 
making the nesting of  possible close to the internal 
margin of the bar in the small point of land.

463Geological control of turtles nesting...

In the central part, where the largest
number of nesting of P. expansa happened, the
height of the beach increases gradually down-
stream, without significant steeps. The dunes
are of medium to large size, spaced, with crests
at a high angle with respect to the channel di-
rection, and frequently they cross the beach en-
tirely. The spacing between the dunes is re-
duced in the downstream direction and they
start to migrate one over the other, amalgamat-
ing and increasing the height of the point bar.
A small-vegetated area serves as an obstacle to
the migration of the dunes in the middle of the
beach. The beach is flat in this area. The end
of the area of nesting of P. expansa is marked
by an accretionary dune front, about 200 cm
high. The amalgamation of the deposits has
created a great elevation in this area, whose
crest is almost parallel to the direction of the
channel.

The location of the tracks of P. expansa
indicates that exist is at specific point, close
to the trough of a great dune. The path of the
turtles had a paraboloid shape not only up-
stream but downstream as well. The return did
not occur in a specific point of the channel.
The concentration of exits of the turtle at a
given point can be explained based in the mor-
phology of the beach and in the existing rela-
tionships between the sandy deposits and the
“boiadouro”. Sandy upstream bars, although
immersed to small depths, made the locomo-
tion of P. expansa difficult. The points that
allow the connection between the “boiadouro”
and the beach are restricted and concentrated
in the trough of the dunes, way ahead of the
highest parts of the point bar.

DISCUSSION

Temperature-dependent sex determina-
tion in most species of turtle studied raised at-
tention to the conditions that govern or inter-
act with the substratum, determining the tem-
perature which the eggs undergo during the em-
bryogenesis. According to Charnov &amp;amp; Bull
(1977), Bull (1980), Bulmer &amp;amp; Bull (1982), and
Janzen &amp;amp; Morjan (2001) the sex ratio of the
offspring is governed by two factors: a) ther-
mal sensitivity of the embryo to the sexual de-
termination, b) maternal choice of the thermal

qualities of the nesting place. Janzen &amp;amp; Morjan
(2001) showed that Chrysemys picta use the
same microenvironment in successive nesting,
which is in agreement the theory that the fe-
males can “control” the sex ratio of the off-
spring by the choice of the thermal environ-
mental of the nests.

Several examples show the importance
of the nesting place in the survival and in the
embryonic development of several lizard spe-
cies and turtles. In all cases it seems clear that
the choice of the nesting places is not random
and seeks to match the physiologic character-
istics of the adult females (i.e. size and terres-
trial locomotion agility) and characteristics of
the clutches (i.e. clutch size) to the character-
istics of the environment (hydric and thermal)
that will control the embryogenesis.

For Ewert et al. (1994) the pivotal tem-
perature will have a decisive influence on the
place chosen for the nesting of four fresh wa-
ter species in a same region. Therefore the sex
ratio of the offspring stays balanced, since the
females use places with different thermal char-
acteristics. This would compensate the differ-
ences of the pivotal temperature among the
species.

Burger (1976) has observed that the
temperature of the nests of Malaclemys terra-
pin terrapin depends on the position of the nest
on a sandy dune. Hays et al. (2001) had at-
tributed the thermal variations in the several
environments of the beaches to the albedo dif-
ference. Bodie (2001), in a compilation work,
pointed out that most of the species of fresh
water turtle prefer open and sandy beaches for
the nesting and that they can seek alternative
habitats, such as levees, when their traditional
nesting places are not available. Raising of the
river could put the eggs at risk, as pointed by
Alho &amp;amp; Pádua (1982), for P. expansa and by
Standing et al. (1999), for Emydoidea
blandingi.

Souza &amp;amp; Vogt (1994), while analyzing
P. unifilis in Costa Marques (RO), had indicated
that nests located in sunny places and in sedi-
ments in the coarse size sands (1 to 0.5 mm,
according to these authors’ classification) ex-
periment larger daily temperature fluctuation.
The average temperature of the nests located
in sediments in the coarse size sand is larger



464   Ferreira Júnior &amp;amp; Castro

than that of the nests in fine sand. These au-
thors did not associate the sex ratio of the off-
spring with the grain size of the substratum;
they just suggested that the nests located in
coarse sediments would bias female sex ratio
more than those placed in finer sediments.

The grain size of the substratum where
the nests are placed does not have influence
only on the temperature. For the sea turtle Che-
lonia mydas to makes a nest cavity it is neces-
sary that the place presents humidity or small
roots that give enough cohesion to the substra-
tum in order to prevent the walls from tum-
bling (Bustard &amp;amp; Greenham, 1968). Chelonia
mydas constructs a nest more easily in finer
sand (Mortimer &amp;amp; Carr, 1987). The coarse and
dry sand makes the opening of the nests diffi-
cult, forcing the females to dig several places
before finding an appropriate local.

Hatchling success is influenced strongly
by the nest site for fresh water turtle species
as P. expansa (Alho &amp;amp; Pádua, 1982; Ferreira
Júnior 2003), Emys orbicularis (Servan et al.,
1989), E. blandingii (Standing et al., 1999), and
sea turtle species such as Dermochelys
coriacea (Whitmore &amp;amp; Dutton, 1985),
Eretmochelys imbricata (Horrocks &amp;amp; Scott,
1991) and Caretta caretta (Hays &amp;amp; Speakman,
1993). Beaches with different hatchling success
present larger concentration of nests in the
points where the survival of the offspring is
larger (Horrocks &amp;amp; Scott, 1991; Hays &amp;amp;
Speakman, 1993).

Bragg et al. (2000) compared the nest-
ing locals of different lizards, and the species
with temperature-dependent sex determination
on the (Eublepharis macularius and
Hemitheconyx caudicinctus) preferred places
with intermediate temperatures. On the other
hand, the species Coleonyx mitratus, which
possesses genetic sexual determination, did not
have a preferred place.

In the Javaés River the nesting areas of
P. expansa and P. unifilis show different mor-
phologic aspects. Although both species can
use the same point bar each species chooses
morphologically different places to nest. The
mineralogical constitution is relatively homo-
geneous in all the six beaches and it does not
influence the nest site chosen by individuals
of either the both species, nor does it affect
duration incubation.

The data suggest that the grain size dis-
tribution in and among different beaches affects
significantly the incubation duration of P.
expansa. The P. expansa is selective in the
choice of the nesting places, preferring histori-
cally the beaches constituted by coarse sedi-
ments. Since 1990 (Figure 5) the largest con-
centrations of nests always took place in the
point bars of the right margin. Besides the larger
complexity of the beaches, the grain size sedi-
ments of the right margin are coarse. This fact
indicate a primary control of the geological
aspects on the reproductive biology of P.
expansa.

The incubation duration varies signifi-
cantly among the beaches for P. expansa due
in part to the influenced of grain size of the
sediments (Table 6 and Figure 4a). There are
differences of incubation duration between the
Coco beach, with a mean of 54.2 ± 4.48 days,
and Comprida beach, with a mean of 68.3 ±
7.70 days. The longer incubation duration for
Comprida beach is associated to its finer grain
size sediments. Grain size of the sediments
influences on the incubation time for P. expansa,
but not for P. unifilis (Table 6). Other elements
should be interacting and affecting the embryo-
genesis of P. unifilis.

It is worth highlighting two characteris-
tics that are different for the two species stud-
ied: the height of the nests and the eggshell
type. In accordance with Pritchard &amp;amp; Trebbau
(1984) the eggshell of P. expansa is flexible and
the one of P. unifilis is rigid. For Packard et al.
(1982) eggs with flexible eggshells are more
sensitive to the variations of the hydric envi-
ronment, absorbing water in humid conditions
and becoming dehydrated in dry ones. The
water exchange with the environment is related
to the metabolic rate, affecting the incubation
duration. Eggs with rigid eggshells, as P. unifilis,
present low porosity and little exchange of
water with the environment, being less depen-
dent from the hydric environment. Thus, it
seems that for P. unifilis the rate of embryonic
development and the incubation duration are
not affected by the hydric conditions of the
nests.

The difference in the constitution of the
eggshells of the P. expansa and P. unifilis eggs
(Pritchard &amp;amp; Trebbau, 1984) helps to under-



465Geological control of turtles nesting...

stand the differences found in the microenvi-
ronment in the nests. The rigid eggshell of P.
unifilis makes possible incubation at smaller
depths. Perhaps, this would be possible even
in drier places, because the dehydration of the
eggs is minimized by the small porosity of the
eggshell (Packard et al., 1982). On the other
hand the eggs of P. expansa demand a greater
depth (Figure 3b), since the eggshell does not
supply an adequate protection against the de-
hydration.

The height and the depth of the nests
of P. unifilis and P. expansa should also affect
the microenvironment of the nests (Figure 3a
and 3b). The P. expansa nests are deeper than
the P. unifilis nests (Figure 3b), which in part,
control the distribution of the nests along the
beaches. Wilson (1998) suggests that medium
and large sized turtles, such as P. expansa (Alho
et al., 1985) and Apalone mutica (Plummer et
al. 1994), nesting in open areas to maximize
the exhibition of the nests to the sun, and small
turtles as Kinosternon baurii need the protec-
tion of the vegetation and of the humidity since
they can not dig deep nests and avoid very high
temperatures. Shallow nests are submitted to
large daily oscillations of temperature (Burger,
1976; Thompson, 1988; Wilson, 1998). The
lower depth of the water table and the stem-
ming increase of humidity could minimize the
daily variations of the temperature. The greater
humidity would minimize the influence of the
heat exchange, which is more effective in coarse
and dry sediments than in fine and humid sedi-
ments (Harrison, 1985; Novak &amp;amp; Black, 1985;
Harrison &amp;amp; Morrison, 1993).

The bottom of the clutch of P. expansa
is located at an mean depth of 61 cm (Figure
3b). Algo in oceanic beaches there are not sig-
nificant differences of the sand temperature at
a depth of 60 cm (Mrosovsky et al., 1984). In
spite of the difference between the sea and flu-
vial environments, it is believed that the pro-
file of heat transmission in large depths has a
similar behavior, with daily variations of tem-
perature being small at such depths. A greater
height of the beach is required so that the hu-
midity originated from the water table is in a
range appropriate to the incubation.

Another fact that can be related to the
greater height required by the eggs is the syn-

chronism between the drought of the river and
the nesting behavior of P. expansa. The begin-
ning of the nesting season is associated with
the stabilization of the river in its lowest level
(Alho &amp;amp; Pádua, 1982). The survivorship of late
hatching of some clutches would be influenced
if the rise of the river water level were antici-
pated. In this case, higher areas nesting posi-
tion allows the hatching of most of the nests,
even if the level of the river rises faster
(“repiquetes”). The eggs of P. unifilis, in the
2000 nesting season, begin hatching in the sec-
ond half of October, before water level
began to rise.

The choice of the nest sites is related to
some habitat requirements, such as, the pres-
ence of “boiadouros”, access channels and to-
pographical levels. The morphology of the
beach will bring direct consequences to the dis-
tribution of the nests. Wide and relatively
plain and uniform areas such as the central part
of the Marreca beach (Figure 7) and the up-
stream part of the Canguçu beach present nests
of P. expansa uniformly distributed. The ap-
propriate height for P. expansa is only reached
when the river water flow makes successive
events of migration of the dunes and amalgam-
ation of the dunes. The choice of the central
part of the beaches of the right margin (Figure
9 and 11) explains this aspect. The separation
among the high areas, chosen by P. expansa and
the low parts, selected by P. unifilis in Coco,
Canguçu, Comprida and Murici beaches is clear.

The dimensions and morphology of the
point bars will depend on their positioning and
interaction with the water flow of the channel.
In spite of being smaller, the point bars of the
left margin are higher and its external margins
are more abrupt, which sometimes hinders the
access of the females to the nesting places. A
great elevation of a place alone is not enough
to define the best area for nesting of P. expansa
(Tables 3 and 4). In spite of the smaller heights,
the beaches of the right margin are, historically,
the most used by P. expansa (Figure 1 and 5).

The Javaés River is deep and calm
enough to allow the turtles to rest in the vicin-
ity of the beaches. The Canguçu beach clearly
exemplifies the importance of the
“boiadouros”. The greater concentration of
nests in 1990, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997 (Figure



466   Ferreira Júnior &amp;amp; Castro

5) happened at the Canguçu beach. Nowadays,
the Canguçu beach importance has been reduced
in comparison to Coco and Comprida beaches.
Reports of the field agents that work in the
project since its implantation in 1990 describe
the decrease of the “boiadouro” as a result of
the formation of sandy banks that, even when
submerged, make the navigation in the area dif-
ficult. The smaller nesting of P. expansa in
Canguçu beach is partially attributed to the
decrease of the “boiadouro” area.

The nesting decrease of P. expansa in
Comprida beach in 2000 is not well understood,
since the “boiadouro” is still deep and there is
easy access to the beach without the presence
of sandy banks to difficult the turtles exit. The
beach height remained similar up until last year.
The decrease of more than 120 nests, in 1999,
to only 18 nests in 2000, will only be explained
with the monitoring for couples of years more.

Due to its smaller size and larger mobil-
ity, P. unifilis reach the beaches more easily, fre-
quently using the channels in the trough of
small dunes, which are common along the up-
stream and downstream parts of the point bars
(Figures 9, 10 and 11). Channels of access that
exist in the trough of the dunes make the con-
nection of the “boiadouro” to the highest points
of the beach. Its importance can be verified at
Coco beach, where the exit of P. expansa is con-
centrated at one only point. This fact helps to
understand the high nesting rate in that por-
tion of the point bar. In the other beaches, where
there are several access channels or the mor-
phology of the beach is a ramp-like, there was
not a high concentration of nests at only one
point. The exit of P. expansa happens in only
one point of in the upstream portion of
Canguçu beach close to a submerged sandy bank
that marks the upstream limit of the
“boiadouro”.

Souza &amp;amp; Vogt (1994) attribute the dif-
ferentiation of the nesting areas of these spe-
cies in the beaches, to the fact that the destruc-
tion of the nests of P. unifilis by P. expansa
that nested later. This hypothesis is rejected
for the beaches monitored in the Javaés River,
because besides being very wide, there is not a
superposition of the nesting areas. The distri-
bution of the nests of P. expansa and P. unifilis
shows the influence of the fluvial environment

on the choice of the nesting area. This distri-
bution in separated morphological places
should be considered in the management
projects that frequently use to transfer of nests.
As we could observe, it is not only sufficient
to transfer the nests to high places, above
the earlier rise of the level of the
rivers (“repiquetes”) because at least for the
P. unifilis, proximity with the water table
is required by the turtles at the moment
of the nesting. If we change the environmental
conditions (which means change in thermal
and hydric conditions), we can somehow
induce unforeseen or poorly understood
modifications on the reproductive biology of
turtles.
