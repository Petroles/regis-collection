A sub-bacia hidrográfica do rio Poxim é formada por quatro rios de água doce, Poxim-Açu, 
Poxim-Mirim, Poxim e Pitanga e está situada na porção leste do Estado de Sergipe, Nordeste do 
Brasil. Nesse trabalho foi investigada a distribuição, os fatores que controlam as concentrações e 
o risco de toxicidade para Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, Al e Fe em sedimentos superficiais dos 
quatro rios. A toxicidade foi avaliada usando o Consensus-based Sediment Quality Guidelines for 
freshwater ecosystems. A matriz de Spearman não indicou associação dos metais com a matéria 
orgânica, mas mostrou uma forte correlação com alumínio, moderada com o ferro e fraca com 
o manganês, sugerindo ser as argilas os principais carreadores dos metais para os sedimentos. 
Em todas as amostras as concentrações dos metais ficaram abaixo do TEC (threshold effect 
concentration) indicando que em relação aos metais traço, raramente deve ocorrer efeito adverso 
para a biota aquática. Foi definida uma base geoquímica para a região usando o lítio como elemento 
de referência. Somente em três sítios foram observados enriquecimentos dos metais associados a 
influências antrópicas. Os valores do fator de enriquecimento sugerem uma grande predominância 
nos sedimentos, de metais de origem natural.

The Poxim river hydrographic sub-basin comprises four freshwater rivers, Poxim-Açu, Poxim-
Mirim, Poxim and Pitanga, and is located in the East of Sergipe State, Northeast of Brazil. The 
present work investigates the distribution, the factors controlling concentrations, and toxicity risks of 
the metals Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, Al and Fe, in surface sediments of the four rivers. Toxicity 
was evaluated using the Consensus-based Sediment Quality Guidelines for freshwater ecosystems. 
Spearman correlation analysis did not indicate any association of the metals with organic matter, 
however strong, moderate and weak correlations with aluminium, iron, and manganese, respectively, 
suggested that clay minerals were the main carrier of metals to sediments. Concentrations of 
metals in all samples were below the TEC (threshold effect concentration), indicating that for these 
trace metals adverse effects on aquatic biota should rarely occur. A geochemical baseline for the 
region was defined using lithium as reference element. Metal enrichments due to anthropogenic 
influence were only observed at three sites. At other sites, enrichment factors were indicative of 
a large predominance of naturally occurring metals in the sediments.

Introduction

Aquatic sediments accumulate metals derived from both 
natural processes as well as anthropogenic activities, and 
play a fundamental role in redistribution of these elements 
to water and aquatic biota. The ability to accumulate and 
redistribute chemical species makes sediments extremely 
interesting for the purposes of environmental investigation, 

since they can provide a semi-permanent record of levels of 
contamination.1-3 In order to determine the contamination 
degree of a sediment, it is first necessary to calculate the 
natural component of the total metal concentration, which 
requires determination of the background concentration and 
its natural variation. Various normalization procedures have 
been employed to take account of natural variability, and 
detect and quantify anthropogenic enrichment.4-7

Geochemical normalization consists of establishing 
mathematical correlations between metal concentrations 



Garcia et al. 1335Vol. 20, No. 7, 2009

and the concentration of a reference element, such as 
aluminium, iron or lithium. The reference element must 
be of lithogenic origin, be structurally linked to at least 
one of the main carriers of metals to the sediment, and 
its concentration must not be significantly influenced 
by anthropogenic inputs.3,8 Aluminium has been most 
frequently used for normalization, since it is the main 
component of fine-grained aluminosilicates. However, 
in the case of sediments composed mainly of immature, 
physically abraded material, such as feldspars, aluminium 
has not shown good correlations with metals, since in 
such sediments it is present in similar proportions in both 
fine and coarse fractions. Here, lithium has been found 
to be a better normalizer, since it is associated with the 
same mineralogical components as the trace metals.3,9-10

For uncontaminated sediment samples, correlation plots 
between the metals and the reference element are used 
to generate regression lines representative of the regional 
geochemical baseline.

The total sediment concentration of a metal does not 
provide information concerning its mobility, availability 
or toxicity. Toxicity is dependent on the amount of metal 
available for bioaccumulation (accumulation by biological 
organisms), and it depends on those sediment properties 
that affect its bioavailability. Hence, it is possible for 
sediment to be metal-contaminated (to have a metal 
content higher than the natural background), but not 
manifest any toxic effects, depending on the geochemical 
processes that control the availability of the metal in the 
sediment.11-15

Various sediment quality guidelines (SQG) have been 
developed by North American agencies, for fresh water 
and marine ecosystems. These are used as informal tools, 
to evaluate the extent to which chemical species associated 
with sediments can induce adverse effects in aquatic biota.16-18

Selection of the most appropriate SQG to use in a given 
application is not always straightforward, mainly due to 
the existence of limited recommendations for the use of the 
various guidelines, and the fact that some show differences 
of up to several orders of magnitude in numerical values 
for the same substance. The consensus-based sediment 
quality guidelines for fresh waters were developed in an 
attempt to resolve such difficulties. These were derived for 
28 chemicals (metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, 
polychlorinated biphenyls and pesticides),19 from previously 
published SQGs,20-24 and for each contaminant provide two 
concentrations associated with adverse effects in aquatic 
organisms. The threshold effect concentration (TEC) is 
that below which no adverse effects should occur, and the 
probable effect concentration (PEC) is that above which 
adverse effects may occur frequently. 

This work is the first study of trace metal geochemistry 
in surface sediments of the Poxim River hydrographic 
sub-basin in Sergipe State, Brazil Northeast. Sediment 
samples were analyzed in order to define a regional 
geochemical baseline, to identify any impacted areas, and 
to evaluate possible toxicity based on consensus-based 
SQG reference data. Potential factors controlling the 
distribution and mobility of metals in the sediments were 
also investigated.

Materials and Methods

Study area

The Poxim River hydrographic sub-basin drains an 
area of around 380 km2 and is located in the East of 
Sergipe State between latitudes 10°55’S and 10°45’S, and 
longitudes 37°05’W and 37°22’W. The region includes 
parts of the municipalities of Aracaju, Areia Branca, 
Laranjeiras, Itaporanga d’Ajuda, Nossa Senhora do Socorro 
and São Cristóvão, with a total population of 721,726 
inhabitants.25,26 The River Poxim sub-basin principally 
comprises the Rivers Poxim-Açu, Poxim-Mirim, Poxim and 
Pitanga, along a west-east axis, and is currently responsible 
for around 30% of the water supply to the City of Aracaju, 
the State capital.

The Poxim River comprises the watercourse formed 
by the confluence of the Poxim-Açu and Poxim-Mirim 
Rivers, and near its source is joined by another affluent, 
the Pitanga River. In its final stretches it passes through 
urban areas of the municipalities of São Cristóvão, 
Nossa Senhora do Socorro and Aracaju, where it 
receives in natura effluents from domestic and industrial 
sources.27

Sample collection

Forty-five surface sediment samples were collected 
at fifteen sites in the Poxim River sub-basin (Figure 1), 
during February 2006, using a core sampler with a cellulose 
acetate-butyrate tube. Portions of 5 cm were removed from 
the top of each core, using non-metallic utensils to avoid 
contamination, placed into sealed plastic flasks, and stored 
over ice during transport to the laboratory. In the laboratory, 
the fine fraction (&amp;lt;63 µm) percentage was determined by 
liquid sieving of the sample, drying at 100 oC to constant 
mass, and weighing.

The fine fraction used for metal determination was 
obtained by first drying the samples in a forced-air 
circulation oven at 50 oC for 72 h (to a constant mass), and 
then sieving to separate the &amp;lt;63 µm fraction.

Chemical analysis

For determination of total metal concentrations, samples 
(ca. 0.5 g) were treated in closed Teflon vessels, using 2 mL 
of HNO

3
, 1 mL of HCl and 4 mL of HF, (all concentrated) 

and heating at 140 oC for 2 h. After cooling, the vessels 
were opened and maintained at 210 oC until complete 
dryness was achieved. The residue was dissolved in 10 mL
of 0.5 mol L-1 HCl, and the volume made up to 50 mL. 
The solutions were stored in polyethylene flasks for later 
determination of metals using flame or graphite furnace 
atomic absorption spectrometry.

Reagent blanks were prepared in the same way as 
samples, and three certified sediment standards (LKSD-1 
CCNRP/Canada lake sediment, NCS DC 75304/China river 
sediment, and NCS DC 78301/China marine sediment) 
were analyzed for quality control purposes. Results showed 
no significant contamination in blanks and trace metal 
recoveries from the reference materials were within the 
range 92-106%.

Partial metal concentrations were determined using US 
EPA Method 200.8. Samples (ca. 1 g) were treated in closed 
Teflon vessels using 4 mL of 1:1 HNO

3
 solution and 10 mL 

of 1:5 HCl solution. The mixture was held at 95 oC for 
30 min. Following extraction, samples were filtered using 
quantitative filter paper, transferred to a 50 mL volumetric 
flask, and made up to final volume using ultra-pure water. 
Solutions were stored in polyethylene flasks for later 
determination of metals using flame or graphite furnace 
atomic absorption spectrometry. Three blank solutions 
were prepared in the same way as samples, and analytical 
quality control was achieved by analysis of the certified 
lake sediment standard (LKSD-1 CCNRP/Canada), which 
is also certified for partial extraction. Results showed a trace 
metal recovery in the range 97-103%. Metal concentrations 
were determined using three replicates. 

Total carbon contents of the samples were measured 
using an elemental analyzer (NCHS-O, Flash ES 1112), at 
a combustion temperature of 900 oC. Organic carbon (C

org
)

was calculated as the difference between carbon contents 
measured before and after sample calcinations at 550 oC for 
1 h. The certified lake sediment standard (LKSD-1 CCNRP/
Canada) was used for quality control, with three replicates 
showing a mean recovery of 96.3 ± 4.2%.

Principal components analysis (PCA) and correlation 
coefficient calculations were undertaken using Statistica 
for Windows (v. 6.0).

Results and Discussion

Sediment characteristics and relationships with trace 
metals

Sediment metal concentrations, organic carbon 
contents, and fine fraction (&amp;lt;63 µm) percentages are given 
in Table 1. All samples showed low fine fraction contents, 
with a range of 4.7-19.6% and mean of 11.0 ± 4.1%.

Natural sediment trace element concentrations are 
strongly influenced by the nature of the inorganic material 
resulting from physical and chemical weathering. This 
material is mainly formed from a limited number of silicate 
minerals, such as quartz, feldspar, mica and clay minerals, 
with a smaller contribution from metal oxides and sulfides. 
Clays comprise the finest fractions, and tend to absorb more 
metals, which is why analysis of the fine fraction has been 
used as a means to correct for natural variability of metal 
concentrations.28,29

Fine fraction organic carbon contents varied between 
1.0% and 5.7%, with a mean of 3.0%. The highest value 
was obtained for site 6, at the confluence of the Poxim-Açu 
and Poxim-Mirim Rivers.

Correlation analysis was used to identify potential 
factors controlling the distribution and mobility of metals in 
the sediments. The Spearman correlation matrix obtained is 
provided in Table 2. The trace metals showed no correlation 
with C

org
, indicative of no, or at best weak, association 

between these elements and organic matter in the sediments. 
This is in agreement with the finding that, in non-marine 
sediments, C

org
 is a weaker carrier than the clays and metal 

oxides.30 Strong correlation with aluminium, moderate to 
strong correlation with iron, and weak correlation with 
manganese was observed, demonstrating that inorganic 
carriers were the main factors controlling metal distributions 
in the sediments. The strong correlations between iron and 
aluminium, and between aluminium and the other metals, 
confirm the principal association of iron with the silt-clay 
fraction, and show that the clays were the main carriers of

Brazil.

metals to the sediments. Similar results have been obtained 
for Australian sediments.30

Trace metal distribution and normalization

PCA was applied to the dataset presented in Table 1, in 
order to identify any trends in the spatial distribution of the 
sediments analyzed. This multivariate statistical technique 
has previously been shown to be useful in interpretation of 
aquatic sediment data.31-33 Here each site was considered 
as an object (15 in total), and the measured parameters as 
variables (total of 11). In order to ensure that the relative 
influences of the different variables on the model were 
independent of the units used for each variable, the data 
matrix columns were auto scaled so that the new variable 
possessed a mean of zero and unit variance.

Two principal components were extracted, together 
representing 80.5% of the total variance. Component t

 was 

responsible for 68.6% of the explained variance, and mainly 
comprised Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Ni, Pb, Zn, Al and Fe. Component

 and explained 12.9% of 

the variance. Figure 2 shows the position of each site on the

The PCA separated the sampling sites into three major 
groupings. Group I included sites 7, 8, 9 and 13, Group II 
site 6, and Group III sites 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13 and

more negative part of t

) from Group III (the positive part of 

t

1 &gt; 0.8) were Co, Cr, Li, Ni, Pb, Zn, Al and Fe, whose 
concentrations were higher in sediments from Groups 
I and II. The second component (t

from Groups I and III. The determining variable was C
org

,
with sediment from site 6 presenting a C

org
 concentration 

which was much higher than those obtained for sites in 
Groups II and III. From the PCA diagram, it can therefore 
be concluded that sediments from the Poxim-Açu, 
Poxim-Mirim and Pitanga Rivers (Group III) possessed 
similar chemical characteristics, with the exception of 
site 15, which is in Group II. Sediments from the Poxim 
River (sites 6, 7, 8, 9), and the Pitanga River (site 15), 
were different from the remainder in that they contained 
higher concentrations of trace metals. Sites 7, 8, 9 and 
15 are located in a region strongly influenced by urban 
and industrial discharges, so it is likely that the higher 
values were due to the presence of metals originating from 
anthropogenic activity. Site 6 is located in a flood plain 
region. Such areas are characterized by the accumulation of 
significant quantities of organic matter,34 which can explain 
the high sediment C

org
 concentration obtained for this site, 

which distinguished it from the other Poxim River sites.

In order to identify possible contamination in the 
sediments, trace metal concentrations were normalized 
relative to the concentration of a reference element. 
Sediments from sites 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 
14 were selected as being representative of natural areas. 
Only sites 7, 8 and 15 were excluded, due to their location 

in areas directly influenced by inputs of urban and industrial 
effluents. Identification of the most suitable geochemical 
normalizer for the study area was achieved by determination 
and comparison of the correlation coefficients (R2) and 
significance levels (p) obtained for linear regressions 
between the trace metals and either Al or Li. Results 
(Table 3) confirmed the suitability of the selected reference 
sites and showed that lithium was the better normalizer. 
Higher R2 values reflect the greater ability of lithium to 
explain natural variations in metal concentrations. Despite 
strong correlation between Li and Al (R2 = 0.83, p &amp;lt;0.0001) 
and their co-existence in the silt-clay fraction, Al showed 
only moderate to weak correlations with most of the trace 
metals.

Various studies3,4,9 have shown lithium to be a better 
normalizer than aluminium, for sediments composed mainly 
of geologically younger materials, such as variable grain 
size feldspars. In these sediments, aluminium is present 
in relatively equal proportions in both fine and coarse 
fractions, which results in weak correlation with the trace 
metals. Lithium is here the better normalizer, because it is 
associated with the same mineralogical components as the 
metals, such as primary micas, iron-magnesium minerals, 
and secondary mineral clays, but not with feldspars.9,35

Lithium cannot be used to normalize Mn concentrations 
(a non-significant correlation was obtained between these 
metals), probably because Mn is associated with a different 
geochemical substrate.

Figures 3a to 3f show plots of the concentrations of 
the trace metals against lithium, and linear regression 
lines for the reference sites, 95% confidence intervals, 
and the points corresponding to the areas considered to 
be contaminated (sites 7, 8 and 15). Concentrations inside 
the 95% confidence intervals are considered to be within 
the natural variation, while those outside are assumed to 
be associated with enrichment of the sediment by metal of 
anthropogenic origin. 

Co and Cr (Figures 3a and 3b) showed similar 
distribution patterns, with all sites lying within the 95% 
confidence limits, except site 7, which showed a small 
enrichment of these metals. Ni (Figure3d) evidenced an 
anthropogenic influence at sites 7 and 15. Cu and Zn 
(Figures 3c and 3f) showed concentrations much higher than

the 95% confidence limits at sites 7, 8 and 15, indicating 
strong enrichment of the metals in these sediments. For 
Pb (Figure 3e) all sites lie within the confidence limits, 
except site 8 (which shows strong enrichment). Hence metal 
concentrations in the sediments analyzed can be considered 
to be due to natural origins, except at sites 7, 8 and 15, and 
the regression lines obtained can be used to define the local 
natural geochemical baseline.

Enrichment factors (EF) were calculated to quantify the 
anthropogenic impact, as described in the literature,3 using 
the expression ([metal]/[Li])

sample
/([metal]/[Li])

background
. To 

the some Li concentration, the metal concentration on 
the linear regression line was used as background value 
and concentrations lying on the upper 95% confidence 
limit was used as comparison value. Sediments were 
only considered to be enriched if the EF exceeded 2, due 
to natural mineralogical variability and uncertainty of 
the analytical measurements.30 Calculated EFs (Table 4) 
indicate that sediments from sites 7, 8 and 15 were enriched 
in Co, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn, due to inputs from urban and 
industrial sources. At site 7, enrichment of Co, Ni and Zn 

was moderate (EF &amp;lt;3), while there was strong enrichment 
of Cu (EF &gt; 3). Moderate Pb enrichment was only observed 
for site 8. Cu and Zn were the elements that showed greatest 
enrichment at the three sites. High concentrations of these 
elements have been observed in sediments located close to 
sewage discharges.36,37

The geoaccumulation index (I

a second criterion to identify contaminated sediments 
(Table 5). I

all of the metals analyzed. Sediment from site 7 was in the 
unpolluted to moderately polluted category, with respect to 
Co, Cr, Ni and Zn, and in the moderately polluted category, 
with respect to Cu. For site 8, Pb and Zn were within the 
unpolluted to moderately polluted band, and Cu was in 
the moderately polluted range. At site 15, Cu and Zn were 
in the unpolluted to moderately polluted category. Hence 
it is clear that the results obtained using the EF and I

procedures were in good agreement.

Sediment toxicity

The SQGs have been used as reference tools, to evaluate 
the extent to which metals associated with sediments could 
adversely affect aquatic organisms.16 Development and 
implementation of these guidelines reflects a recognition 
of the importance of contaminated sediments as a possible 
cause of adverse environmental impacts.41 Although 
originally developed for use in North America, the indices 
established in these SQGs have been adopted for assessment 
of contaminant concentrations in sediments from various 
regions of the globe.16,32,42,43

In the absence of toxicological information, the 
consensus-based SQGs, developed for freshwater 
ecosystems, were used in the present study to evaluate 
any possible adverse effects, on aquatic organisms, of 
the metal concentrations measured in the fine fraction of 
surface sediments. 

The &amp;lt;63 µm fractions proved to be the most chemically 
active sediment phase, consisting primarily of clay and 

silt particulates and due to the large specific surface area, 
typically contains higher concentrations of metals.40

In order to allow such assessment of toxicity, based on 
SQG values, the trace metal concentrations were determined 
following extraction using nitric and hydrochloric acids (i.e.
the partial concentrations), which is a procedure compatible 
with that used in the development of the SQG. Table 6 shows 
the concentrations obtained for each metal, together with the 
respective TEC and PEC values. The highest concentrations 
were generally obtained for sites 6-9 and 15, however all 
values were below the TEC, indicating that adverse effects 
on aquatic biota should be unlikely to occur. The value 
nearest to the TEC was obtained for Cu at site 8 (27.9 µg g-1). 
The predictive ability of the TEC achieved 72% for Cr 
and Ni, and 82% for Cu, Pb and Zn. This signifies that the 
probability of the incidence of adverse biological effects at 
concentrations below the TEC is 28% for Cr and Ni, and 
18% for Cu, Pb and Zn. The predictive ability of the PEC 
was 94% for Cd, 92% for Cr and Cu, 91% for Ni, and 90% 
for Pb and Zn. Hence the values of the consensus-based 
PECs for these metals provide a precise basis for prediction 
of toxicity in freshwater sediments.19 It must be emphasized, 
however, that SQGs should be used with caution, as there 
cannot be any guarantee of a complete absence of toxicity at 
concentrations lower than the TECs, or that samples which 
exceed the PECs must necessarily be toxic, particularly 
considering that the SQGs were not specifically developed 
for the biogeochemistry of the region under study. For greater 
assurance, it is important that the results obtained here should 
be validated using toxicity tests.

Conclusions

The distributions, the factors controlling concentrations 
and the toxicity risks of Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, 
Al and Fe were investigated for surface sediments of the 
four rivers forming the Poxim river hydrographic sub-
basin. Correlation analysis showed that inorganic carriers, 
such as clay minerals, were the main factors controlling 
the distribution of trace metals in the sediments. Lithium 
was shown to be a better normalizer than aluminium for 
determination of enrichment factors, and was used to define 
a regional geochemical baseline (RGB) for a majority 
of the metals analyzed. Use of the RGB, together with 
enrichment factors, showed that naturally occurring metals 
predominated in the surface sediment samples studied. 
Nevertheless, sediments from sites located in the most 
urbanized region were found to be enriched in Co, Cr, Cu, 
Ni, Pb and Zn, due to anthropogenic inputs. Sediments from 
the studied sites were classified as unpolluted to moderately 
polluted, according to the geoaccumulation index. I

Metal concentrations in all samples were below 
the threshold effect concentration, established by the 
consensus-based sediment quality guidelines for freshwater 
ecosystems, indicating that adverse effects on aquatic 
biota, due to the presence of these trace metals, should 
rarely occur.
