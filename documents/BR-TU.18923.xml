SUMMARY 

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder that results from a 

dysfunction of insulin secretion (type 1) and/or sensitivity (type 2). Type 1 

and in many cases type 2 diabetic patients require daily insulin injections to 

control blood glucose levels and retard the appearance of diabetes-related 

complications. The liver plays a central role in the context of whole-body 

glucose homoeostasis and fuel management in general. Under physiological 

conditions, insulin is released by the pancreas into the portal vein and 

reaches the liver along with the nutrient flow absorbed in the 

gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Under these conditions, the actions of insulin on 

liver metabolism play a key role in promoting glucose and lipid storage. 

DM is characterized by impairment of these actions resulting in abnormal 

levels of blood glucose and lipids that, if left untreated, provoke widespread 

secondary complications. With current therapies, insulin is delivered 

subcutaneously and this results in a predominantly peripheral uptake, in 

contrast with the physiological release profile. The experimental work 

described on this thesis addressed the pathways for glucose disposal and 

storage in the liver under two experimental settings representing the fasted 

to fed transition and the fed state. The studies were performed in non-

diabetic control rats and in a rat model for type 1 DM, the streptozotocin 

(STZ)-diabetic rat. The delivery of insulin by alternative liver-targeted 

routes was also explored. 

A general introduction is presented in chapter 1. Diabetes and its 

therapy are briefly addressed and the STZ-diabetic rat model for the study 

of type 1 DM is introduced. Hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism are 

overviewed with emphasis to its regulatory aspects, and molecular 

mechanisms of insulin signaling are integrated with the metabolic 

regulation. In the last section of this chapter the use of stable isotope tracers 

for the study of hepatic metabolism is briefly overviewed.  



xxii| 
 

In the studies described in chapter 2, rats were challenged with a 

carbohydrate load after a 24-hour fast and glucose disposal was addressed 

by carbon 13 (13C) and deuterium (2H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 

spectroscopy. One group of animals was given a glucose load and the other 

a mixture consisting of 9 equivalents of glucose and 1 equivalent of 

galactose. Hepatic glycogen was depleted with fasting and increased 8-10 

times after the carbohydrate loads. The gluconeogenic flux dominated both 

glycogen synthesis and endogenous glucose production (EGP). Galactose 

hepatic metabolization resulted in a decreased contribution of load glucose 

to glycogen but apparently had little effect on the clearance of load glucose 

from the blood. 

Chapter 3 presents the glucose challenge study performed in STZ-

diabetic rats after a 24-hour fast. One group of animals was injected insulin 

by the subcutaneous (s.c.) route prior to receiving the glucose load. In 

another group insulin was delivered to the intraperitoneal (i.p.) cavity to 

provide a higher portal/peripheral ratio and target the liver. In a last group, 

rats did not receive any treatment. Glucose disposal was traced by 13C and 
2H NMR methods. There was no net hepatic glycogen synthesis during the 

test, not even in the insulin-treated rats. The untreated STZ-diabetic rats 

showed increased EGP coupled with reduced clearance of load glucose. The 

absolute contribution of EGP to blood glucose in the insulin-treated rats was 

reduced to control levels, regardless of the route of insulin administration. 

Glucose clearance was highly enhanced in the insulin-treated rats even 

when compared to controls. These studies indicate that in the context of a 

glucose challenge, the stimulatory effect of insulin on glucose uptake is 

much higher than its inhibitory effect on EGP. 

The absorptive state was addressed in chapter 4, and hepatic 

metabolism was studied in ad libitum fed STZ-diabetic and non-diabetic 

control rats with the deuterated water (2H2O) tracer approach. In controls, 

net glycogen synthesis during an overnight feeding accounted for one third 

of the hepatic stores and was equally derived from the direct and indirect 

(gluconeogenic) pathways. The amount of glycogen synthesized by diabetic 



|xxiii 

rats was similar to controls in all stages of the disease but the hepatic 

glycogen content was lower 10 and 20 days after the induction by STZ, 

indicating that those animals had higher glycogen turnover rates. There was 

a progressive increase of the indirect pathway contribution to hepatic 

glycogen synthesis from 70% 4 days after diabetes induction to 90% at 10 

and 20 days of the disease. Parallel to the disruption in glycogen synthesis, 

the contribution of gluconeogenesis to EGP was profoundly increased 10 

and 20 days after diabetes induction but not in the earlier stage (4 days). The 

lipogenic pathway was promptly reduced 4 days after the induction of 

diabetes but the hepatic triglyceride (TG) content was similar to controls. 

With the progression of the diabetic condition, the contribution of the 

lipolytic flux increased, resulting in elevated hepatic TG content. 

Chapter 5 describes the insulin replacement experiments in STZ-

diabetic rats. The treatment protocol consisted in two daily injections by the 

s.c. or i.p. route and was carried out for 10 days. Hepatic metabolism was 

then addressed by the 2H2O method under natural feeding conditions. Gene 

expression and enzyme activity assays were also performed in liver samples 

from those rats. With both treatments there was a restoration of the direct 

pathway to glycogen synthesis and of the pathways to EGP. In the i.p.-

treated rats glycogen stores could be recovered to control levels. The 

lipogenic pathway was also enhanced but was still lower than controls in 

both s.c.- and i.p.-treated groups. Despite the improvements on glycogen 

and TG synthesis in the liver, the gluconeogenic and lipolytic fluxes could 

not be efficiently suppressed with the insulin-replacement protocols. 

Chapter 6 explores the use of novel nanoparticle-based delivery 

systems in insulin therapy. Experiments in control rats showed that the 

hypoglycemic response following s.c. injection of insulin was enhanced by 

the use of nanoparticles from poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA), especially 

when ?-cyclodextrin esters with 10 carbon alkyl chains (?-CDC10) were 

present in the formulation. The oral route was also investigated but the 

nanoparticles were ineffective even after coating with an enteric polymer. 

Experiments in STZ-diabetic rats did not demonstrate any benefit of the

nanoparticle formulation relative to a standard insulin solution in terms of 

the hypoglycemic response following the s.c. injection nor in the context of a 

glucose challenge.

RESUMO 

A diabetes mellitus constitui um perturbação metabólica que resulta 

de uma disfunção na secreção (tipo 1) e/ou sensibilidade (tipo 2) à insulin. 

Os doentes do tipo 1, e em muitos casos também do tipo 2, necessitam de 

injecções diárias de insulina para controlar os níveis plasmáticos de glucose 

e retardar o aparecimento de complicações relacionadas com a doença. O 

fígado é um órgão central na regulação da homeostase da glucose e na 

gestão energética em geral. Em condições fisiológicas, a insulina é secretada 

pelo pâncreas para a veia porta e chega ao fígado de forma consertada com 

a absorção de nutrientes no tracto gastrointestinal. Nestas condições, os 

efeitos da insulina no metabolismo hepático são fundamentais para 

promover o armazenamento de glucose e lípidos. A diabetes é caracterizada 

por perturbações nestes efeitos, que se refletem em níveis anormais de 

glucose e lípidos no sangue, os quais, não corrigidos, provocam o 

alastramento de complicações secundárias. Na terapêutica tradicional, a 

insulina é administrada por via subcutânea (s.c.), o que resulta numa 

insulinização predominantemente periférica, por oposição ao perfil de 

libertação fisiológico. O trabalho experimental descrito nesta tese estudou a 

captação e consumo de glucose pelo organismo e seu armazenamento no 

fígado em dois contextos experimentais representando a transição do jejum 

para o estado prandial e o estado prandial propriamente dito. Os ensaios 

foram realizados em ratos controlo e ratos tornados diabéticos por indução 

com estreptozotocina (STZ), um modelo animal para a diabetes tipo 1. 

Foram ainda estudadas vias alternativas para administração de insulina 

direccionada ao fígado. 

O capítulo 1 apresenta uma indrodução geral. A diabetes e o seu 

tratamento são abordados de forma breve e o modelo animal de diabetes 

induzida por STZ é apresentado. O metabolismo hepático da glucose e dos 

lípidos é analizado sendo dado ênfase ao seu controlo e regulação. Aspectos 



xxvi| 
 

moleculares da transdução do sinal da insulina, com relevância para a 

regulação metabólica, são abordados. Por último, a aplicação de substratos 

enriquecidos com isótopos estáveis ao estudo do metabolismo hepático é 

apresentada. 

Nos ensaios descritos no capítulo 2, os ratos receberam uma dose 

massiva de açúcares após 24 horas de jejum e o consumo de glucose foi 

seguido por espectroscopia de ressonância magnética nuclear de carbono 13 

(13C) e deutério (2H). A um grupo de animais foi administrada uma dose de 

glucose e a outro uma mistura que consistiu em 9 equivalentes de glucose e 

1 equivalente de galactose. As reservas de glicogénio no fígado foram 

consumidas no período de jejum e aumentaram 8-10 vezes após a ingestão 

das doses de açúcares. Tanto a produção endógena de glucose como a 

síntese de glicogénio hepático foram dominadas pelo fluxo da 

neoglucogénese. A metabolização hepática da galactose reduziu a 

contribuição da glucose exógena para a síntese de glicogénio mas pouco 

alterou a captação de glucose do sangue. 

O capítulo 3 descreve a prova de tolerância à glucose realizada em 

ratos diabéticos por indução com STZ, após 24 horas de jejum. Um grupo de 

animais recebeu insulina por via s.c. antes da dose de glucose. Num outro 

grupo, a insulina foi injectada na cavidade intraperitoneal (i.p.) para 

aumentar a razão portal/periférica e direccionar a insulina para o fígado. 

Um último grupo não recebeu qualquer tratamento. O consumo de glucose 

foi avaliado por técnicas de RMN de 13C e 2H. Não houve síntese líquida de 

glicogénio no fígado, nem mesmo nos ratos injectados com insulina. Os 

ratos diabéticos que não foram injectados com insulina apresentaram um 

aumento da produção endógena de glucose acompanhado por uma redução 

da captação de glucose plasmática. A contribuição absoluta da produção 

endógena para a glucose plasmática nos ratos diabéticos injectados com 

insulina foi igual à observada nos controlos não diabéticos, 

independentemente da via de administração. O consumo de glucose 

proveniente da dose administrada foi bastante aumentado, mesmo em 

comparação com os controlos. Estes ensaios indicam que, no contexto de 



|xxvii 

uma prova de tolerância à glucose, a acção da insulina é mais notória na 

estimulação da captação de glucose do sangue do que na inibição da 

produção endógena de glucose. 

O estado prandial propriamente dito foi abordado no capítulo 4. 

Ratos controlo e diabéticos por indução com STZ alimentados ad libitum 

foram estudados e o seu metabolismo hepático avaliado pelo método da 

água deuterada (2H2O). Nos ratos controlo, a síntese líquida de glicogénio 

durante uma noite de alimentação representou um terço do conteúdo 

hepático e seguiu as vias directa e indirecta (neoglucogénica) de forma 

equivalente. Os ratos diabéticos sintetizaram uma quantidade de glicogénio 

similar aos controlos em todos os estádios da doença avaliados, mas o 

conteúdo hepático total diminui 10 e 20 dias depois da indução da diabetes, 

significando que nestes casos houve uma maior renovação do glicogénio 

hepático. Verificou-se um domínio progressivo da via indirecta para a 

síntese de glicogénio, que aumentou de 70% 4 dias após a indução da 

diabetes para 90% 10 e 20 dias depois. Paralelamente às alterações no 

metabolismo do glicogénio, a contribuição da neoglucogénese para a 

produção endógena de glucose foi profundamente aumentada 10 e 20 dias 

após a indução de diabetes mas manteve-se igual à dos controlos aos 4 dias 

da doença. A via lipogénica foi imediatamente reduzida 4 dias depois da 

indução da diabetes mas o conteúdo hepático de triglicerídeos manteve-se 

igual ao dos controlos. Com a progressão da doença, a contribuição do fluxo 

lipolítico aumentou, levando ao aumento do conteúdo hepático de 

triglicerídeos. 

O capítulo 5 relata as experiências de reposição da insulina em 

animais diabéticos. O protocolo de tratamento consistiu em duas injecções 

diárias por via s.c. ou i.p. durante 10 dias. O metabolismo hepático foi, 

então, seguido com 2H2O em condições de alimentação ad libitum. Foram 

ainda feitos ensaios de expressão genética e actividades enzimáticas em 

amostras de fígado destes animais. Ambos os tratamentos proporcionaram a 

recuperação das vias de síntese hepática de glicogénio bem como das vias 

para a produção de glucose para valores controlo. Os animais injectados 



xxviii| 
 

com insulina por via i.p. apresentaram níveis de glicogénio no fígado 

semelhantes aos controlos. A via lipogénica também foi potenciada mas 

manteve-se abaixo dos valores dos controlos com ambos os tratamentos. 

Apesar das melhorias na síntese hepática de glicogénio e triglicerídeos, os 

fluxos da neoglucogénese e lipólise não foram suprimidos com os 

protocolos de reposição de insulina. 

O capítulo 6 explora o uso de novas formulações de nanopartículas 

na terapêutica com insulina. As experiências em ratos controlo mostraram 

que a acção hipoglicémica da insulina foi potenciada através do uso de 

nanopartículas de um co-polímero de ácido láctico e glicólico (PLGA), 

mormente com a inclusão de esters da ?-ciclodextrina com cadeias alquílicas 

de 10 carbonos (?-CDC10). A via oral também foi investigada mas a 

formulação não se mostrou eficaz, nem quando as nanopartículas foram 

revestidas com um polímero entérico. Nas experiências em ratos diabéticos 

por indução com STZ não ficou demonstrado qualquer benefício da 

formulação de nanopartículas em relação a uma solução padrão de insulina 

em termos de acção hipoglicémica após administração s.c. nem no contexto 

de uma prova de tolerância à glucose.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

All life forms exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium. Life relies on 

the flux of matter and energy through the cellular metabolic pathways and 

during these processes the balance between nutrient intake and the release 

of excretory products must be maintained (Fell 1997). Several levels of 

control including biochemical, endocrine, physiological, neuronal and 

behavioral are involved in the interplay between energy intake, storage and 

expenditure (Friedman 1995). The liver is a central organ in the context of 

energy balance and fuel management and hence plays an important role in 

whole-body metabolism.  

Glucose is a universal source of energy for cells in the organism. The 

liver is responsible both for glucose production during fasting and its 

disposal and storage in the fed state. Those pathways are connected to the 

processing of other fuels like lipids and proteins in the intricate network of 

whole-body metabolism. Glucose, protein and lipid metabolism are 



2|Chapter 1 
 

regulated, among other factors, by the pancreatic hormone insulin. Diabetes 

melittus (DM) is characterized by a dysfunction of insulin secretion and/or 

sensitivity, which results in metabolic disruptions.  

The following sections address briefly DM pathology and treatment 

as well as an experimental animal model for its study. Hepatic glucose and 

lipid metabolism is overviewed with focus on its regulatory aspects and 

integration with insulin action. Finally, tracer-based approaches to the study 

of these metabolic pathways are generally discussed.  

 

1.1 Diabetes mellitus 

The World Health Organization (WHO) describes DM as “a 

metabolic disorder of multiple etiology characterized by chronic 

hyperglycemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein 

metabolism, resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action or 

both” (WHO 1999). The WHO report from 2006 recommends as diagnosis 

criteria fasting plasma glucose ? 7.0 mM (126 mg/dL) or 2-hour1 plasma 

glucose ? 11.1 mM (200 mg/dL) (WHO 2006).  

The current classification of DM is based on the clinical stages as 

well as the etiology of the disease (WHO 1999). Type 1 DM results from ? 

cell destruction secondary to idiopathic or auto-immune factors; whereas 

type 2 DM may range from predominantly insulin resistance with relative 

insulin deficiency to predominantly insulin deficiency with relative insulin 

resistance. The previous types constitute the basic forms of diabetes and 

while there may be several therapeutic options for type 2 diabetic patients, 

the treatment of type 1 DM relies completely on the administration of 

exogenous insulin. With insulin administration (to type 1 and in some cases 

also type 2 diabetic patients) hyperglycemia is prevented and when a strict 

metabolic control is followed (Atkinson et al. 2001), the diabetes-related

after the ingestion of a 75 g oral glucose load following an overnight fast.

complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, heart disease, among 

others) are delayed, with benefits for the patients’ quality of life.  

 

1.1.1 Insulin therapy and formulation 

Before the discovery of insulin in the 1920s the life span of people 

diagnosed with diabetes was rarely beyond childhood. Although insulin 

doesn’t cure diabetes, its value in the treatment of diabetic patients was 

immediately recognized by the attribution of the Nobel Prize in Physiology 

and Medicine to Banting and Macleod in 1923 for “The discovery of insulin” 

(Nobelprize.org 2010).  

Following the discovery of insulin many advances were made 

concerning its isolation and purification. In the 1980s the technology of 

recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) allowed for the industrial 

production and commercial expansion of human insulin and, in the last 15 

years, modified insulins (with altered amino acid sequences) produced by 

biotechnology engineering techniques resulted in enhanced stability and/or 

modulation of the duration of action (Pillai et al. 2001).  

Despite the huge amount of improvements on insulin therapy, its 

administration often requires multiple daily injections via the subcutaneous 

(s.c.) route. This is unpleasant for the patients, thus compromising their 

compliance to the treatment. Furthermore, delivery by the s.c. route is 

unable to mimic the physiologic portal to peripheral gradient resulting in 

deficient hepatic insulinization. This may limit the metabolic performance of 

insulin-treated diabetic patients compared to that of healthy individuals, 

particularly in the case of hepatic-specific actions such as glycogen kinetics 

(Bischof et al. 2002).  

Presently, research on insulin formulation is focused on exploring 

more patient-friendly routes such as the oral (e.g. Chalasani et al. 2007; 

Damgé et al. 2007; Reis et al. 2008) or pulmonary (e.g. Johansson et al. 2002; 

Aguiar et al. 2004). The oral route has the advantage of delivering insulin to 

the portal vein, resembling the physiological release and appropriately 



4|Chapter 1 
 

targeting the liver. Therefore, effective oral delivery may constitute an 

important strategy for optimizing the metabolic effects of insulin. This can 

be achieved by the use of specialized delivery systems such as nanoparticles 

(explored in chapter 6).  

Alternatively to the insulin supplementation therapy, providing 

diabetic patients with functional ? cells constitutes the ultimate goal of DM 

treatment. Pancreas and isolated islet transplantation has allowed for 

diabetic patients to produce their own insulin (Shapiro et al. 2000; 

Sutherland et al. 1998). In the context of ? cell replacement, the liver is 

commonly used as a surrogate for the pancreatic function. For example, in 

islet transplantation protocols the portal vein is used to graft the ? cells 

(Shapiro et al. 2000). Moreover, with advances in stem cell technology, cells 

in the liver have been reprogrammed to express the ? cell phenotype 

(Aguayo-Mazzucato et al. 2010; Halban et al. 2010; Wagner et al. 2010). In 

addition, using virus as gene delivery vehicles has allowed for the basal 

hepatic insulin expression in diabetic rats and translated into improved 

glycemic control (Dong et al. 2002).  

 

1.1.2 The STZ-diabetic rat as a model for type 1 diabetes 

The diabetogenic action of streptozotocin (STZ) was discovered in 

the 1960s (Junod et al. 1969) and ever since this drug has been widely used 

in the experimental setting to induce diabetes in rodents.  

 In rats, type 1 DM is induced by a single intravenous injection of 

STZ at a dose no lower than 45 mg/kg (Junod et al. 1969). Alternatively, STZ 

can be delivered to the intraperitoneal (i.p.) cavity at a dose no lower than 

50 mg/kg (Szkudelski 2001). Typically, doses of 50-65 mg/kg lead to 

chronic hyperglycemia and higher doses cause severe ketosis and death 

within days (Wei et al. 2003). Additionally, STZ can induce type 2 DM if rats 

are injected a high dose of the drug (~100 mg/kg) in the first days that 

follow birth (Szkudelski 2001). 



Introduction|5 

Structurally, STZ is a nitrosouria derivative with a hexose moiety 

that allows it to enter the cells by the same transporter as glucose. Uptake of 

STZ occurs specifically via the glucose transporter 2 (Glut-2), which is the 

principal glucose transporter in rodent ? cells (Wollheim et al. 2004), and 

this seems to be essential for its toxic action (Hosokawa et al. 2001). In 

addition, STZ is also toxic to other tissues expressing Glut-2, like the liver or 

the kidney, and the damage on extra pancreatic cells may also account for 

the pathology that characterizes the STZ-diabetic rat (Lenzen 2008). 

Several cytotoxicity mechanisms, ultimately leading to cell death, are 

described for the deleterious action of STZ in ? cells. Streptozotocin causes 

direct damage on DNA by alkylation (Bolzán et al. 2002). In addition, STZ 

acts as a nitric oxide donor leading to the production of reactive oxygen 

species that also account for the DNA damage (Szkudelski 2001). Recently, 

another toxicity mechanism has been proposed in which STZ inhibits the 

activity of N-acetyl-?-D-glucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase), the enzyme that 

removes N-acetylglucosamine from proteins, hence contributing to increase 

protein glycosilation in ? cells (Konrad et al. 2001; He et al. 2009). Moreover, 

O-GlcNAcase from pancreatic islets was found to be more sensitive to STZ 

than that from other tissues (Konrad et al. 2001), providing supporting 

evidence for the ? cell selectivity of STZ. 

The STZ-induced type 1 diabetic rat model displays the typical 

symptoms of type 1 DM present in humans (e.g. polyphagia, polydipsia and 

polyuria). Blood glucose levels rapidly increase within hours after the 

administration of a diabetogenic dose of STZ to adult rats, in parallel with a 

decrease in insulin levels (Burcelin et al. 1995). Food and water consumption 

increase in the first days and remain elevated for several weeks while 

weight gain is restrained (Wei et al. 2003). Hence, the STZ-diabetic rat is a 

very popular model for experimental type 1 DM and is used recurrently in 

addressing the pathophysiology of the disease and in characterizing the 

efficacy of antidiabetic interventions (e.g. Ferrannini et al. 1990; Akirav et al. 

2004; Iwasaki et al. 2005; Lo et al. 2006; Suthagar et al. 2009).

1.2 Overview of hepatic glucose and lipid 
metabolism  

Following meal digestion in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), nutrients 

are absorbed to the blood and reach the liver via the portal vein. This event 

is consonant with the release of insulin from the pancreatic ? cells into the 

portal vein, in response to glucose (and also protein and fatty acid) 

stimulation (Utzschneider et al. 2004). Under physiological conditions, the 

liver extracts 50-80% (Radziuk et al. 1994; Utzschneider et al. 2004) of portal 

vein insulin with the remainder reaching the systemic circulation. In the 

liver, insulin suppresses hepatic glucose production, which is active in the 

post absorptive or fasted state, and stimulates pathways for glucose 

disposal and storage as glycogen and lipids. The liver alone accounts for the 

extraction of one third of a glucose load, muscle and fat for another third 

and brain and red blood cells for the remaining third (Cherrington 1999). 

On the other hand, during fasting, the brain takes up about 80% of the 

glucose produced endogenously (Baron et al. 1988).  

 

1.2.1 Glucose disposal and storage 

Figure 1 depicts the fates of glucose in the liver, in the postprandial 

or absorptive state. Glucose enters the hepatocyte through the Glut-2 

transporter, which is primarily expressed in the liver but is also present in 

kidney, intestine and pancreatic ? cells (Nordlie et al. 1999). Other dietary 

sugars like fructose or galactose also enter the liver through this transporter. 

The transport of glucose via Glut-2 is bidirectional; moreover Glut-2 has low 

affinity and high capacity for glucose facilitating both the efflux and uptake 

of glucose in the range of concentrations necessary for glucose homeostasis 

(Nordlie et al. 1999).

hexokinases (I, II and III) it displays low affinity for the substrate. 

Furthermore, GK is not inhibited by physiological concentrations of the 

reaction product, G6P, and this allows the feed-forward activation of 

subsequent disposal fluxes (Agius 2008). In the liver, the control of GK 

activity is dependent in a regulatory protein (GKRP) that acts as an 

inhibitory competitor in regards to glucose (Agius 2008). It is widely 

accepted that under basal conditions of 5.5 mM glucose concentration, GK 

exists sequestered in the nucleus in association with GKRP and that GK is 

released and translocated to the cytosol under high glucose or low fructose 

concentration (Agius et al. 1993; de la Iglesia et al. 1999; Agius 2008). 

Fructose-1-phosphate, whose intrahepatic levels increase in the postprandial 

state, binds to GKRP causing the weakening of its interaction with GK, and 

this results on the release of the active GK (Iynedjian 2009). On the other 

hand, in the postabsorptive state, fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) binds to GKRP 

stimulating its interaction with GK (Iynedjian 2009), which is consequently 

imported back to the nucleus. This way GK degradation is prevented and at 

the same time a large stable pool of the enzyme is conserved for recruitment 

upon refeeding (Newgard 2004).  

Glucose uptake through Glut-2 is coordinated with its 

phosphorilation by GK (Figure 1) resulting in the formation of G6P, which 

can be directed to glycogen synthesis or glycolysis. 

 

1.2.1.1 Glycogen synthesis 

 Glycogen deposition occurs in the liver after a meal. The hepatic 

glycogen stores represent an important source of glucose to be released in 

the fasted state by the liver so that plasma glucose levels remain within the 

physiological range and whole-body energetic demands are fulfilled. Net 

glycogen synthesis results from the interplay between glycogen synthase 

(GS) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) activities. In the biogenesis of 

glycogen, G6P is first converted to glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) by 

phosphogluco isomerase and subsequently to uridine diphosphate glucose 



Introduction|9 

(UDPG) by UDPG pyrophosphorylase. Glycogen synthase then adds 

glucose residues from the UDPG donor to the growing glycogen molecule 

via ?-1,4 bonds. 

The formation of glycogen is intimately related to glucose 

phosphorylation by GK. In fact, glycogen synthesis is sensitive to increases 

in GK activity secondary to glucose-induced translocation of GK (Agius et 

al. 1996). Furthermore, when GK translocates to the cytosol it is directed to 

the plasma membrane in a way that allows the coupling of glucose 

phosphorylation with glycogen synthesis (Jetton et al. 2001). The fact that 

GK overexpression enhances glycogen deposition (O'Doherty et al. 1996; 

Seoane et al. 1999; Morral et al. 2004), further demonstrates the dependence 

of glycogen synthesis on GK. The product of the GK reaction, G6P, is not 

only a precursor to glycogen but also a regulator itself of GS activity. 

Hepatic GS exists in an inactive form in the cytosol and it is activated and 

directed to the periphery of the cell via G6P stimulation (Ferrer et al. 2003). 

The binding of G6P to the phosphorylated (inactive) isoform of GS, causes a 

conformational change that makes it a better substrate for protein 

phosphatases, which then convert the enzyme to the active 

(dephosphorylated) isoform (Villar-Palasi et al. 1997; Ferrer et al. 2003). 

Insulin stimulates GS by increasing the protein phosphatase activity 

(Khandelwal et al. 1977; Newgard et al. 2000). The activity of GP, which 

catalyzes the breakdown of glycogen to G1P molecules, is also regulated by 

phosphorylation in a coordinated fashion with GS, with the 

dephosphorylated isoform being less active than the phosphorylated (Ferrer 

et al. 2003).  

The direct conversion of glucose to glycogen via GK and GS 

coordinated fluxes does not account for the whole of glycogen deposition in 

the absorptive state and a significant contribution from gluconeogenic 

precursors is required for efficient glycogen synthesis to occur (Newgard et 

al. 1983; Katz et al. 1984; Newgard et al. 1984). This latter route is known as 

the indirect pathway, where glucose is initially metabolized to 3-carbon 

intermediates followed by gluconeogenic re-synthesis into hexose 



10|Chapter 1 
 

phosphate (Figure 2). This route also allows non-hexose precursors such as 

glycerol or gluconeogenic amino acids to be converted to glycogen. The 

relative contributions of both pathways depend on the nutritional and 

pathophysiological status of the organism, with the indirect pathway 

contribution to glycogen synthesis increasing with fasting (Shulman et al. 

1990; Hellerstein et al. 1995), type 1 DM (Hwang et al. 1995) or GK deficiency 

(Velho et al. 1996).

1.2.1.2 Glycolysis and lipogenesis 

 Glycolysis refers to the series of cytosolic reactions that break down 

one glucose molecule to two pyruvate molecules. The first step in the 

glycolytic pathway is the highly regulated phosphorylation of glucose to 

G6P by GK, already overviewed. This reaction, together with the conversion 

of F6P to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) catalyzed by phosphofructokinase 

(PFK) and the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate 

catalyzed by pyruvate kinase (PK) constitute the irreversible steps in 

glycolysis. The energy charge of the cell, as well as allosteric and 

transcriptional processes contribute to control the flux thourgh PFK and PK. 

Briefly, PFK and PK are stimulated by insulin, glucose and products from 

its early metabolism, while a high ratio of ATP to adenosine diphosphate 

(ADP) plus adenosine monophosphate decreases the activity of those 

enzymes (Newgard 2004).  

The most important activator of hepatic PFK is fructose-2,6-

bisphosphate (F2,6P2), which is degraded (to F6P and inorganic phosphate) 

and regenerated (from F6P and inorganic phosphate) by the bifunctional 

enzyme, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. In the fed 

state, xylulose-5-phosphate derived from glucose metabolization via the 

pentose phosphate pathway stimulates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that 

dephosphorylates the bifunctional enzyme, favoring its kinase activity and 

the formation of F2,6P2 (Newgard 2004). Experiments in fasted rats showed 

that hepatic levels of F2,6P2 start to increase several hours after glucose 

administration or refeeding, when glycogen stores in the liver are near to 

replenishment (Kuwajima et al. 1984; Kuwajima et al. 1986; Holness et al. 

1988; Jin et al. 2003). Hence, under refeeding circumstances, stimulation of 

the glycolytic flux occurs after that of glycogen synthesis. Moreover, a 

positive correlation was observed between hepatic glycogen levels and the 

lipogenic rate after chow refeeding (Holness et al. 1988). Accordingly, when 

hepatic glycogen is depleted in humans by dietary intervention, excessive 

carbohydrate intake is disposed by high glucose oxidation rates and de novo 

lipid synthesis only after glycogen stores become saturated (Acheson et al. 



12|Chapter 1 
 

1988). On the other hand, under natural feeding conditions, F2,6P2 levels 

rise in parallel with glycogen in the liver (Bois-Joyeux et al. 1986) suggesting 

the sequence of events may not be the same as in refeeding conditions.  

After the glycolytic phase, pyruvate enters the mitochondria and is 

oxidized to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) by pyruvate dehydrogenase 

multienzyme complex (PDH). This reaction links glycolysis to the 

tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) and de novo lipogenesis (DNL). The 

activity of PDH is ruled by posphorylation (inhibition)-dephosphorylation 

(stimulation) mechanisms and inhibited by the end products acetyl-CoA 

and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotine in the reduced form (NADH) 

(Strumi?o 2005). In rats, starvation, DM and low carbohydrate diet result in 

the inactivation of PDH whereas insulin and high carbohydrate loads 

activate PDH (Randle 1998). Furthermore, a decrease in circulating non-

esterified fatty acids (NEFA) is observed under those conditions (high 

insulin, low glucagon). Since the activity of PDH is inhibited by increased 

mitochondrial levels of acetyl-CoA and NADH from NEFA metabolism 

(Randle 1998; Holness et al. 2003), reduced NEFA levels permit more PDH 

flux and a greater potencial for glycolytic acetyl-CoA generation. In rats, the 

decrease in hepatic DNL rate during fasting (decline in insulin and glucose 

levels) is accompanied by a progressive reduction of PDH activity (Holness 

et al. 1990). In contrast, the flux through PDH relative to that of the TCA 

cycle is increased under simultaneous hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia 

conditions (Alves et al. 2011).  

The “first” reaction in the TCA cycle is the condensation of acetyl-

CoA with oxaloacetate (OAA) to yield citrate, catalyzed by citrate synthase. 

Citrate is common to both pathways downstream acetyl-CoA formation. 

Alternatively to following the TCA cycle reactions, citrate can be exported 

to the cytosol where citrate lyase (CL) reconverts it to acetyl-CoA, which can 

be used in DNL, and OAA that returns to the mitochondria in the form of 

either malate or pyruvate. The cytosolic conversion of OAA to malate and 

further to pyruvate requires the sequential activities of malate 

dehydrogenase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotine phosphate (NADP)-



Introduction|13 

malic enzyme. The latter reaction provides the majority of reducing 

equivalentes for DNL in the form of reduced NADP (NADPH). The 

remainder is produced in the pentose phosphate pathway by the activities 

of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and 6-phosphogluconate 

dehydrogenase (6PGDH). 

In addition to glycolytically-derived pyruvate, acetyl-CoA molecules 

for the lipogenic pathway may be produced from amino acid catabolism, 

fatty acid oxidation or acetate from intestinal fermentation. Malonyl 

coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) is formed by the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA 

catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Malonyl-CoA is a physiological 

inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) (Ruderman et al. 1999), 

which transports fatty acids from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix for 

? oxidation. In this way, fatty acids from DNL are directed to esterification 

resulting on the synthesis of triglycerides (TGs).  

In humans, under normal conditions, daily hepatic DNL accounts 

only for a minor fraction of TG synthesis (3-7%) in the liver but this 

contribution is increased (up to 32%) by dietary (e.g. fructose, low fat-high 

carbohydrate diets) or hormonal intervention (e.g. insulin) (Hellerstein et al. 

1996). In rodents, the contribution of DNL to the hepatic TGs ranges from 

5% in 5-hour refed rats (Hellerstein et al. 1991) to 11% in 3-day ad libitum fed 

rats (Delgado et al. 2009a). Other studies report contributions up to 70% 

when the experiment was followed for two weeks, using a different rat 

specie (Lee et al. 2000; Bassilian et al. 2002). 

 

1.2.2 Lipids disposal and storage 

1.2.2.1 Brief overview of lipoprotein metabolism 

Lipids are different from other nutrients since, with the exception of 

short-chain fatty acids, they are not directly delivered to the portal 

circulation upon intestinal absorption. Instead, water-insoluble dietary 

lipids are processed within the enterocyte and packed into chylomicrons 



14|Chapter 1 
 

that are absorbed to the lymphatic circulation prior to reaching the blood. 

Chylomicrons are part of the specialized family of plasma lipid-carriers, 

lipoproteins. These structures are spherical particles composed of a 

hydrophobic core (cholesterol esters and TGs) and a hydrophilic surface 

monolayer of phospholipids, cholesterol and apolipoproteins. Lipoproteins 

with distinct functions and compositions arise from the dynamic crosstalk 

between the liver and peripheral tissues through the bloodstream.  

The main function of chylomicrons is to transport diet-derived TGs 

to the tissues of destiny. After meals, the increase in plasma TGs is largely 

dependent on the chylomicron-TGs, although there is also a contribution 

from very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TGs (Frayn 2002). Chylomicron-

TGs are hydrolyzed by the endothelial enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and 

the resulting fatty acids are taken up by the tissues and stored (adipose 

tissue) or used for oxidation (skeletal muscle). Also by LPL activity, VLDL 

secreted by the liver deliver fatty acids to extra-hepatic tissues. Insulin is a 

potent activator of LPL, stimulating its expression and activity in the 

adipose tissue (Frayn 2002; Vergès 2009). Accordingly, in insulin-deficient 

mice, LPL activity is reduced hampering the storage of fat in adipocytes 

(Pighin et al. 2005). In untreated type 1 diabetic patients, the lack of insulin 

causes hypertriglyceridemia as a consequence of the reduced catabolism of 

TG-rich lipoproteins (Vergès 2009) and the same is observed in insulin-

deficient rats (Iwasaki et al. 2005). 

With the further removal of TGs, VLDL remnant particles are 

converted to the cholesterol-enriched intermediate density lipoproteins and 

low density lipoproteins, which supply cholesterol to essentially all cells. 

Conversely high density lipoproteins (HDL) are responsible for the reverse 

transport of cholesterol to the liver for excretion in the bile. The liver 

secretes these particles as lipid-poor lipoproteins. In the circulation, nascent 

HDL receive phospholipids and apolipoproteins from chylomicrons and 

VLDL, and take up cholesterol and phospholips from the peripheral tissues 

(Vergès 2009).  



Introduction|15 

1.2.2.2 Hepatic TG dynamics and VLDL metabolism 

Besides DNL (see section 1.2.1.2), dietary and lipolytic sources 

contribute to the hepatic TG pool. As chylomicrons travel through the 

bloodstream they become depleted on TGs and the remnant particles are 

cleared from the blood by the liver through receptor-mediated endocytosis. 

Hence, dietary TGs reach the liver associated to the remnant chylomicrons. 

Hepatic lipase hydrolyses TGs from chylomicrons (and also other 

lipoproteins) releasing the fatty acids, which are re-esterified and stored as 

TGs in intra-hepatic lipid droplets (Sparks et al. 2009). 

In addition, fatty acids from adipose tissue lipolysis transported by 

plasma albumin also contribute to the hepatic TG pool. This inflow of NEFA 

is particularly high during fasting and decreases rapidly after meals as a 

result of insulin action on suppressing hormone sensitive lipase in the 

adipose tissue (Frayn 2002). This event, coupled with the stimulation of LPL 

causes the net storage of TGs in the adipocyte in the postprandial state.  

In the liver, TGs are packed along with cholesterol into VLDL and 

secreted to the bloodstream. A rate-limiting step in the formation of VLDL 

is the transfer of TGs to apolipoprotein B (apoB) by the microsomal transfer 

protein (MTP) (Kamagate et al. 2008). Insulin decreases VLDL secretion 

(Huang et al. 2009) by several mechanisms, including a direct inhibition of 

MTP gene expression and apoB synthesis (Sparks et al. 2009) and the 

suppression of NEFA release from adipose tissue as discussed above. 

Hence, and in accordance with the stimulation of DNL and of energy 

storage in general, insulin promotes the accumulation of TGs in the liver 

(Huang et al. 2009). 

 

1.2.3 Glucose production 

In the absence of exogenous glucose, provided by food intake, 

plasma glucose levels are maintained via endogenous glucose production 

(EGP). The liver is the main organ accounting for EGP but the kidney and 



16|Chapter 1 
 

small intestine are also able to produce glucose and release it to the 

bloodstream (Mithieux et al. 2004), although their contribution only becomes 

significant in severe insulinopenic states such as prolonged fasting or 

diabetes (Mithieux et al. 2006). This capacity for glucose output relies on the 

activity of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), the enzyme that catalyzes the 

dephosphorylation of G6P to glucose. 

In the liver, G6P can originate from the release of glucosyl units from 

hepatic glycogen stores (glycogenolysis) or can be synthesized de novo in the 

process of gluconeogenesis. In healthy humans the gluconeogenic 

contribution to EGP increases with fasting from 40-55% in the postprandial 

state to 95% from the 42nd hour of fasting and onward (Chandramouli et al. 

1997; Roden et al. 2001). Parallel to this, hepatic glycogen stores decrease 

linearly in the first hours of fasting (Petersen et al. 1996) and are nearly 

depleted by the 42nd hour (Roden et al. 2001). 

Pathways to glucose production are dependent on substrate and 

hormonal inputs. The fall of glucose levels and the concomitant increase in 

the glucagon/insulin ratio observed in the fasted state translates into an 

increase in glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis (Lefèvre 2004).  

 

1.2.3.1 Glycogenolysis 

As mentioned in section 1.2.1.1, net glycogen storage or breakdown 

depends on the activities of GS and GP. Those enzymes are regulated by 

reciprocal phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms. In catabolic 

states such as fasting or stress, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-

dependent protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates GS, inactivating it and 

conversely phosphorylates phosphorylase kinase that phosphorylates 

(activates) GP (Newgard et al. 2000). In addition, glycogen synthase kinase 3 

(GSK3) is also activated by PKA and contributes to further inactivate GS 

(Jope et al. 2004). 



Introduction|17 

1.2.3.2 Gluconeogenesis 

The regulation of gluconeogenesis mainly occurs at a transcriptional 

level, in accordance with the slow transition from the fed to fasted state 

(Newgard 2004). The first step of gluconeogenesis is the conversion of 

pyruvate to PEP. This step actually involves the activity of two key 

enzymes: pyruvate carboxylase (PC) that generates OAA from pyruvate and 

PEP carboxykinase (PEPCK) that converts OAA to PEP. Under fasting 

conditions, it is the oxidation of fatty acids that fuels this energetically-

expensive conversion and at the same time provides allosteric regulators 

that favor it. Namely, acetyl-CoA stimulates PC and along with NADH and 

ATP (also by-products from the oxidation of fatty acids) inhibit PDH 

(Newgard 2004). Furthermore, the binding of glucagon to its cell receptor 

results in the conversion of ATP to cAMP that acts to stimulate the PEPCK 

gene expression (Gurney et al. 1994; Newgard 2004). The expression of the 

G6Pase gene is also increased by cAMP and, in addition, by variables 

associated with the diabetic condition like hyperglycemia and 

hyperlipidemia (Newgard 2004). The gene expression and activity of FBPase 

are also increased with fasting or insulinopenic diabetes but the underlying 

mechanisms are still unclear (Newgard 2004).  

 

1.3 Molecular aspects of insulin signaling 

 Insulin is a hormone that promotes anabolic processes. In the liver, 

insulin acts to stimulate glucose disposal and storage and inhibit glucose 

production as generally discussed in the previous sections. These effects are 

mediated by changes in enzyme activities or amounts as a consequence of 

the intracellular transduction of insulin’s signal. 

When insulin binds to its transmembrane receptor elicits a 

conformational change that results in the autophosphorylation of the 

receptor, which in turn mediates the phosphorylation of several 

intracellular substrate proteins on tyrosine residues (Garvey 2004). The 



18|Chapter 1 
 

effects of insulin on cell function will depend on the substrate proteins 

involved and on the signaling pathways activated henceforward. Most of 

insulin’s metabolic effects result from a signaling pathway that involves the 

phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins and the 

sequential activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt or 

protein kinase B (Akt/PKB).  

The following section introduces some of the most important 

signaling mechanisms and molecules implicated in insulin’s metabolic 

effects in the liver. 

 

1.3.1 Metabolic effects of insulin signaling in the liver 

In the liver, the PI3K pathway stimulates glycogen synthesis since 

Akt/PKB phosphorylates GSK3, inactivating it and hence stimulating GS 

activity (see also section 1.2.3.1) (Peak et al. 1998; Saltiel et al. 2001; Garvey 

2004).  

Another important hepatic metabolic consequence of the Akt/PKB 

pathway is the phosphorylation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) and the 

consequent export of that transcription factor from the nucleus to the 

cytosol. By this mechanism, the FoxO1-dependent gene expression of 

gluconeogenic enzymes PEPCK and G6Pase is decreased (Foufelle et al. 

2002; Garvey 2004; Postic et al. 2004). In addition, phosphorylation of FoxO1 

as a result of insulin signaling also prevents its interaction with peroxisome 

proliferative activated receptor ? co-activator 1, which is necessary for the 

transcription of the PEPCK and G6Pase genes (Postic et al. 2004). Moreover, 

since the nuclear activity of FoxO1 also accounts for the expression of MTP 

and apoB, insulin inhibition of FoxO1 translates into a decrease of VLDL 

secretion in the liver (Sparks et al. 2009).  

Conversely to the inhibition of FoxO1, insulin induces another 

transcription factor, the sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c 

(SREBP1c) probably also through the PI3K-Akt/PKB signaling pathway 

(Foufelle et al. 2002; Barthel et al. 2003). SREBP1c regulates gene expression 



Introduction|19 

for GK, PK and most lipogenic genes, including the ones for fatty acid 

synthase multienzyme complex (FAS), ACC and CL (Foufelle et al. 2002; 

Garvey 2004). However, SREBP1c activity alone does not account for the 

stimulation of the glycolytic and lipogenic metabolic pathways and, with 

the exception of GK, most of the enzymes involved in those pathways are 

also induced by glucose via the carbohydrate responsive element binding 

protein (ChREBP) (Dentin et al. 2005). Under basal conditions, PKA 

phosphorylates ChREBP retaining it in the cytosol; conversely, under high 

glucose levels, xylulose-5-phosphate-stimulated PP2A dephosphorylates 

ChREBP allowing it to migrate to the nucleus (Towle 2005). 

 

1.4 Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
methods in metabolism 

Metabolic phenotyping is emerging in the post-genomics and 

proteomics era in the context of linking cell metabolism – a fundamental 

parameter of cell function – to the DNA information and transcription 

(Chikayama et al. 2008). A comprehensive metabolic analysis provides an 

integrate profile of the pathophysiological status that results from the 

genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic variability, and is the basis for the 

development of a new field, metabonomics/metabolomics2 (Lindon et al. 

2007; Bain et al. 2009). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a 

powerful and versatile technique for the study of cellular, tissue and whole-

body metabolism. In the context of metabonomics, NMR spectroscopy 

represents a quantitative, non-destructive tool that requires little sample 

preparation for the analysis of complex biological fluids, cells or even intact 

tissues. For such samples, a sizable array of metabolites can be identified 

                                                      
2  These two terms are used interchangeably in the scientific community. In its original 
definition “metabonomics” is the quantitative measurement of the dynamic multiparametric 
metabolic response of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification 
while “metabolomics” is the comprehensive and quantitative analysis of all metabolites in a 
system (Lindon et al. 2007). 



20|Chapter 1 
 

and their concentrations measured from a single proton (1H) NMR 

spectrum. 

Moreover, NMR assessments can be performed in vivo, what 

represents a major breakthrough relative to the previously-established 

invasive approaches that required needle biopsies and catheterization 

(Roden et al. 2001). With in vivo 1H, carbon 13 (13C) and phosphorous 31 

NMR spectroscopy experiments, the metabolic profile of diverse metabolites 

can be determined in several organs includind liver, brain and muscle (e.g. 

Sinha et al. 2002; Goforth et al. 2003; Gruetter et al. 2003; Lanza et al. 2006; 

van Zijl et al. 2007) and followed in longitudinal studies to assess the 

dynamics of metabolite pools. Most interestingly, in the context of hepatic 

carbohydrate metabolism, the quantification of glycogen by in vivo 13C NMR 

spectroscopy is used in combination with tracer-based experiments and 

plasma turnover measurements providing a comprehensive insight into the 

metabolic fluxes (Roden et al. 1996; Bischof et al. 2002; Petersen et al. 2004).  

 

1.4.1 The use of stable isotopes to trace carbohydrate and lipid 

metabolism 

By definition, a metabolic tracer is a substance used to follow the 

biological transformation of an endogenous substrate (tracee). The tracer 

must be metabolically indistinguishable from the tracee but at the same time 

possess a unique property allowing for its detection. In the large majority of 

cases, tracers consist of synthetic substrate molecules where one or more of 

the atoms have been substituted by rare isotopes that can be detected by a 

specific technique. Stable isotopes such as 13C and deuterium (2H) can be 

detected by NMR and mass spectrometry and these approaches have 

largely replaced earlier tracer studies based on their radioactive 

counterparts (carbon 14 and tritium). In addition to being safer, stable 

isotope analytical methods have a key advantage over radioactive tracer 

detection in that they inherently provide positional labeling information. 

Equivalent information may be obtained with radioactive tracers, but it 



Introduction|21 

involves highly tedious carbon-by-carbon degradation of the metabolite of 

interest. 

Isotopic labels at specific positions of any given precursor substrate 

are transferred to metabolic intermediates and products in a highly specific 

manner during the biochemical reactions within the organism. Thus, the 

fate of the labeled precursor is highly predictable depending on the 

metabolic pathway that it transverses. With NMR analysis of the product 

labeling pattern, different metabolic routes can be discriminated and 

measured.  

 

1.4.1.1 [U-13C]glucose as a tracer to glucose and glycogen metabolism 

Glucose kinetics can be addressed by enriching the plasmatic pool 

with [U-13C]glucose. This is easily achieved by supplementing a meal or a 

glucose solution with the tracer or even by delivering it directly to the 

bloodstream in more invasive infusion procedures. When [U-13C]glucose 

enters the disposal pathways, two important events occur to the plasmatic 

pool, (i) it becomes less enriched with the tracer as it is taken up by the cells 

and (ii) other 13C-enriched glucose isotopomers 3  arise from the 

metabolization (or recycling) of the tracer. The relative contribution of each 

isotopomer to the plasma glucose pool can be disclosed by 13C NMR 

spectroscopy and this information provides insight into the dynamics of 

whole-body glucose metabolism, which is sensitive to several 

pathophysiological conditions. 

Uptake of [U-13C]glucose is followed by its metabolization within the 

cells. For example, in the liver, the direct conversion of the tracer into 

glycogen renders [U-13C]UDPG and glycogen composed of [U-13C]glucosyl 

residues. If, on the other hand, glucose follows the glycolytic pathway, this 

results in the formation of two molecules of [U-13C]pyruvate. The glycolytic 

                                                      
3 Contraction of the words isotope and isomer, refers to molecules that differ one from the 
other solely by their isotopic composition. For example, considering the glucose molecule 
and the 13C isotope, each carbon may be 12C or 13C. Since there are 6 carbons in glucose, there 
are 26 = 64 possible isotopomers. 



22|Chapter 1 
 

processing is especially active in peripheral tissues like the muscle, where, 

under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is further converted to lactate by 

lactate dehydrogenase. Lactate from muscle glycolysis then enters the 

bloodstream and is taken up by the liver, where it is reconverted to 

pyruvate that serves as a gluconeogenic substrate for glucose production. 

This sequence of events is named the Cori cycle. As a result of the glucose 

resynthesis from [U-13C]pyruvate, other isotopomers arise. In this process 

there is scrambling of the labeling due to pyruvate recycling (pyruvate ? 

OAA ? PEP ? pyruvate) and racemization at the OAA/fumarate inter-

conversion. In consequence, several possible populations of glucose 

isotopomers from [U-13C]pyruvate can be predicted (Mendes et al. 2006) but 

[1,2-13C2]- and [1,2,3-13C3]glucose account for the majority (Perdigoto et al. 

2003), and the isotopomer analysis is thus much simplified. Moreover, those 

isotopomers can be distinguished from the [U-13C]glucose tracer by analysis 

of the C1 resonance in the 13C NMR spectrum of a glucose derivative 

(method applied in chapters 2 and 3).  

 

1.4.1.2 Deuterated water as a tracer to glucose and glycogen 

metabolism 

Deuterated water (2H2O) is a relatively inexpensive tracer. Upon 

administration it freely distributes within the tissues and rapidly 

equilibrates with total body water, thus allowing to follow whole-body 

metabolism (Murphy 2006). Deuterated water is easily administered both to 

humans and animals by adding it to the common drinking water in tracer 

amounts. Furthermore, 2H2O can be delivered to animals as an i.p. bolus 

that results in a steady state enrichment within 10 minutes (Turner et al. 

2003). Additionally, the subjects may be maintained under 2H2O 

administration for several days, making it suited for assessing metabolism 

both in short and long term studies in diverse experimental settings 

(Murphy 2006).  



Introduction|23 

Glucose-6-phosphate is a common precursor to both glycogen and 

glucose. In the presence of 2H2O, G6P is labeled with 2H in several positions 

due to the incorporation of that isotope from body water in exchange and 

addition reactions of the G6P production pathways. This labeling is 

maintained in the glucose and glycogen molecules. Thus, a given positional 
2H enrichment in glucose or glycogen reflects the reaction accounting for 

incorporation from 2H2O in that position. Moreover, the positional 2H 

enrichment quantitatively reflects its respective reaction if isotopic steady 

state has been achieved (which occurs very fast with 2H2O) and the reaction 

is complete.  

A large body of studies has been performed in the past 15 years 

based on the 2H2O method and equations established by Landau and co-

workers (Landau et al. 1995; Landau et al. 1996). The exchange of protons 

with 2H from the 2H2O at the level of the G6P/F6P keto-enolic equilibrium 

results in the enrichment of G6P with 2H in position 2 (Figure 3). Because 

that isomerization is extensive and essentially complete, the G6P pool is 

enriched with 2H in position 2 regardless of its origin. Hence, 2H labeling of 

position 2 of glucose is assumed to reflect the total EGP, both via 

gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. In fact, in fasting conditions, when 

EGP is the only source of blood glucose, the 2H enrichment in position 2 of 

glucose is essentially that of body water both in humans (Landau et al. 1995; 

Jones et al. 2006a) and rats (Nunes et al. 2009). Likewise, both direct and 

indirect pathway precursors of glycogen become enriched with 2H from 
2H2O in position 2. On the other hand, 2H enrichment from 2H2O in position 

5 of G6P specifically and quantitatively reflects the contribution of 

gluconeogenesis from both pyruvate and glycerol. Incorporation of 2H in 

that position occurs at the level of the triose phosphates isomerization 

(Figure 3).

1.4.1.3 Deuterated water as a tracer to de novo lipogenesis 

Fatty acid biosynthesis, as that of many other endogenous polymers, 

can be measured by mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA). This 

method is based on the mathematics of combinatory probabilities and 

determines the true precursor enrichment by the analysis of the isotope 

distributions on the polymer end-product. For example, plasma VLDL 

isotopomer abundances can be quantified by mass spectrometry following 

the administration of 13C-enriched acetate (Hellerstein et al. 1996) or 2H2O 

(Murphy 2006) and the precursor (intracellular acetyl-CoA) enrichment 

determined by MIDA provides an estimation of hepatic DNL. 

Alternatively, the hepatic pool of acetyl-CoA can be sampled in vivo by the 

administration of a xenobiotic metabolized in the liver by acetylation. This 

strategy was developed by Hellerstein and colleagues (Hellerstein 1991; 

Hellerstein et al. 1991) and reports DNL values comparable with those from 

MIDA analysis.  

In the process of lipid biosynthesis, the incorporation of hydrogens (or 

deuterium) from the body water into the fatty acid molecule may occur 

directly or indirectly, through NADPH in the reduction steps or via the 

labeling of precursor acetyl-CoA. The methyl groups of the fatty acids in 

the TG molecule are derived from acetyl-CoA (Murphy 2006). Hence, a 

simple method for the quantification of DNL consists in determining the 
2H enrichment in the methyl group of TGs (by 2H NMR analysis of hepatic 

lipids) and relate that to the precursor enrichment in the presence of 2H2O 

(Delgado et al. 2009a).

GLUCOSE PRODUCTION AND HEPATIC GLYCOGEN SYNTHESIS 
DURING A CARBOHYDRATE CHALLENGE IN RATS – EFFECT OF 

GALACTOSE 

2.1 Introduction 

The study of hepatic glycogen synthesis by the direct and indirect 

pathways is of central importance in the field of metabolic disorders like 

diabetes or obesity. Those contributions can be resolved in humans by 

supplementing a breakfast meal with 13C-enriched glucose and a xenobiotic 

glucuronide precursor such as paracetamol (Hellerstein et al. 1986; Delgado 

et al. 2009b). The 13C enrichment of UDPG, sampled via the urinary 

glucuronide, relative to that of 13C-enriched plasma glucose provides a 

measure of direct and indirect pathway contributions. Alternatively, the 

enrichment of UDPG position 5 from ingested 2H2O can be used to 

determine direct and indirect pathway contributions to glycogenic flux 

(Jones et al. 2006a). To date, none of these measurements have accounted for 

the effects of galactose that may be present in the breakfast meal. Although 



28|Chapter 2 
 

it may be a minor component of the total meal carbohydrate intake, the fact 

that it is metabolized by liver (while dietary glucose is mostly metabolized 

by peripheral tissues) amplifies its effects on postprandial hepatic 

carbohydrate metabolism. For example, a 300 mL portion of reduced fat 

milk contains about 15 g of lactose or 7.5 g galactose – about 7.5% of the 

total carbohydrate from a typical breakfast meal containing ~100 grams of 

carbohydrate. Galactose aside, the liver accounts for about 20%, or 20 grams 

of glucose absorption from this meal. In this setting, the contribution of 

galactose to total hepatic carbohydrate uptake is 7.5/27.5 g, or 

approximately 27%. 

Galactose is metabolized to common intermediates of glucose 

metabolism via the Leloir pathway as shown in Figure 4 (Hellerstein et al. 

1988; Niewoehner et al. 1990; Niewoehner et al. 1992; Wehrli et al. 2007). 

After galactose phosphorylation to galactose-1-phosphate (Gal1P), 

galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase catalyses the transference of the 

UDP moiety from UDPG to Gal1P, producing UDP-galactose (UDPgal) and 

G1P. UDPgal is then converted to UDPG by UDP-galactose 4-epimerase. 

UDPG may then be converted to glycogen via GS or be metabolized to G1P. 

The extensive equilibration between G1P and G6P coupled to G6Pase 

activity allows the net conversion of galactose to hepatic glucose. 

All tracer measurements of direct and indirect pathway 

contributions to hepatic glycogen synthesis are based on the assumption 

that the labeled G6P precursor of one pathway is diluted by unlabeled G6P 

generated by the other. Thus, glucose tracers are metabolized to G6P via the 

direct pathway and are assumed to be diluted by G6P molecules generated 

by indirect pathway activity so that UDPG enrichment is less than that of 

the glucose precursor. With 2H2O, G6P derived via the indirect pathway is 

enriched in the fifth hydrogen to the same level as body water and this 

enrichment is assumed to be diluted by direct pathway G6P molecules that 

are not enriched in this position. In the presence of galactose, these 

assumptions are no longer valid since the conversion of galactose to UDPG

represents a hitherto undefined capacity for diluting UDPG enrichment 

from either 13C-glucose or 2H2O tracers.

This chapter focuses on the effect of a small fraction of galactose, 

equivalent to that derived from a single glass of milk in a standard breakfast 

meal, on the estimates of direct and indirect pathways using current tracer 

methods. The experimental setting consisted of an oral glucose tolerance 

test (OGTT) performed to fasted rats, including [U-13C]glucose and 2H2O 

tracers. In the galactose experiments, these tracers were accompanied by [1-
13C]galactose so that its conversion to glycogen could be independently 

monitored. Additionally, in the same experiment, the glucose clearance

from the blood could be characterized by resolving the contributions from

2.2 Materials and methods 

2.2.1 Animal studies 

2.2.1.1 Animal housing 

Male Wistar rats (Charles Rivers, Spain) with approximately 8 weeks 

were used. Animals were subjected to a 12 hour light/12 hour dark cycle 

(lights on from 7 am to 7 pm) with free access to a standard chow diet (60% 

carbohydrates, 16% proteins, 3% lipids). At least five days of acclimatization 

were allowed before any intervention was performed on the animals.  

 

2.2.1.2 Animal protocols 

Rats (231 ± 5g) were fasted for 24 hours with free access to water. In 

order to attain proper body water 2H2O enrichment animals were injected 2 

mL of 2H2O in the i.p. cavity at the beginning of the study. Carbohydrate 

loads were also dissolved in 2H2O. A glucose load (2 g/kg, approximately 

2.6 mmol per animal) enriched to 10% with [U-13C]glucose was 

administered to the first group (GLU, N = 6) by oral gavage. The second 

group (GLU+GAL, N = 6) was administered the same dose of carbohydrate 

as glucose-galactose mixture consisting of 9 equivalents of glucose and 1 

equivalent of galactose. The glucose fraction was enriched to 10% with [U-
13C]glucose while the galactose fraction was enriched to 10% with [1-
13C]galactose. After administering the carbohydrate loads, plasma glucose 

was monitored from tail tip samples every 15 minutes until 180 minutes 

with an Accu-check Aviva (Roche, Portugal) glucometer. At 180 minutes, 

animals were anesthetized by injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) in the i.p. 

cavity, the abdominal cavity was opened and ~5 mL of blood was collected 



Effect of galactose during a carbohydrate challenge|31 

from the abdominal aorta. A small blood sample (0.5 mL) was reserved for 

determination of 2H2O body water enrichment and plasma insulin levels. 

The liver was excised and immediately freeze-clamped in liquid nitrogen. In 

order to determine the basal fasting liver glycogen content, 24-hour fasted 

animals (N = 5) were sacrificed without receiving a carbohydrate load. 

 

2.2.2 Metabolite analyses 

Whole blood was immediately treated with ZnSO4 0.15 M (1.5 mL 

per mL of blood) and Ba(OH)2 0.15 M (1.5 mL per mL of blood), centrifuged, 

and glucose on the supernatant extracted by passing through a sequential 

cationic and anionic ion-exchange columns. The effluent was lyophilized 

and glucose was derivatized to monoacetone glucose (MAG) as described 

below. Liver was lyophilized, and then pulverized to a fine powder and 

glycogen extracted by treatment with 30% KOH (8 mL per gram of liver dry 

weight, gdw) at 70ºC for 30 minutes. The mixture was treated with 6% 

Na2SO4 (4 mL per gdw) and 99.9% ethanol (to a final concentration of 70%, 

25 mL per gdw) and glycogen was allowed to precipitate at 4 ºC overnight. 

After centrifugation, the upper liquid phase was discarded and the solid 

residue dried. The residue was resuspended in 50 mM NaCH3COO pH 4.5, 

and 16 units of an aqueous solution of amyloglucosidase from Aspergillus 

niger (Sigma-Aldrich, Portugal) added. The sample was incubated at 55 ºC 

overnight, and then centrifuged and the upper liquid collected and 

lyophilized. Glucose obtained from liver glycogen enzymatic hydrolysis 

was quantified by a standard assay kit (Invitrogen, Spain). The percent 

glycogen synthesized over the experimental period was determined as the 

difference between the quantified glycogen for each animal and the mean 

value determined for the 24-hour fasted controls relative to the quantified 

glycogen. Insulin levels were determined by ELISA enzyme immunoassay 

accordingly with the supplier’s instructions (Mercodia, Sweden).  



32|Chapter 2 
 

2.2.3 Synthesis of the glucose monoacetone derivative 

In order to optimize the signal resolution in the NMR spectra, 

glucose was converted into its monoacetone derivative. Briefly, the dried 

residue either from blood or liver glycogen preparations was suspended in 

10 mL (liver) or 5 mL (blood) acetone with 4% sulphuric acid. Acetone and 

sulphuric acid were enriched with deuterium to 2% as previously described 

(Jones et al. 2006b). The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature 

to yield diacetone glucose. The acetonation reaction was quenched by 

adding 10 mL (liver) or 5 mL (blood) of water and adjusting the pH to 8 

with 1 M NaHCO3. Following acidification of the solution to pH 2.0 with 1 

M HCl, diacetone glucose was hydrolysed to MAG by incubation at 40 ºC 

for 5 hours. The solution pH was then increased to 8 with 1 M NaHCO3 and 

the samples were dried by rotary evaporation under vacuum. MAG in the 

residue was extracted with 4 mL of boiling ethyl acetate. Following 

evaporation of ethyl acetate, the residue was saved in a desiccator until 

NMR analysis.  

 

2.2.4 NMR Spectroscopy 

All spectra were analyzed with the NUTS PC-based NMR spectral 

analysis software (Acorn NMR Inc., USA). The peak areas were quantified 

using the curve fitting or the integration tool and the applied line 

broadening was 0.5 Hz for 1H NMR spectra, 1 Hz for 2H NMR spectra and 

0.2 Hz for 13C NMR spectra. 

 

2.2.4.1 2H NMR analysis of body water  

Body water 2H2O enrichments were determined from plasma by 2H 

NMR as described by Jones et al. (Jones et al. 2001) with adaptations. Briefly, 

10 µL of plasma were mixed with 1 mL of acetone. After centrifugation 0.6 

mL of the supernatant was collected and transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube. 



Effect of galactose during a carbohydrate challenge|33 

2H NMR spectra were obtained at 25 ºC with a 11.7 T Varian Unity 500 

spectrometer (Agilent, USA) equipped with a 5 mm broadband probe with 

the observe coil tuned to 2H. Proton decoupled 2H NMR spectra were 

acquired with a 25° pulse, 4 seconds of acquisition time and 8 seconds of 

pulse delay. The number of scans was 24 and spectra typically looked like 

the one depicted in Figure 5. In order to determine the absolute 2H 

enrichment level of plasma samples a calibration curve was prepared from 

water standards enriched with 99% 2H2O from 1.3% to 3.3% (Figure 6).

enrichment of water standards. The linear regression equation used to determine 
the 2H enrichment level of body water from plasma samples is shown.  

 

2.2.4.2 2H NMR analysis of MAG 

MAG was dissolved in 0.6 mL of 85% (v/v) acetonitrile in dimethyl 

sulfoxide (DMSO) or, alternatively, in 0.2 mL or 0.6 mL of 90% (v/v) 

acetonitrile in water with NaHCO3 (9 mg/mL), accordingly with the probe 

used. Proton-decoupled 2H NMR spectra of MAG samples were obtained at 

50 ºC with two alternative NMR spectrometers, a 11.7 T Varian Unity 500 

equipped with a 5 mm broadband probe and a 14.1 T Varian 600 (Agilent, 

USA) equipped with either a 3 mm or a 5 mm broadband probe. In all cases 

the observe coil was tuned to 2H and fully-relaxed spectra were acquired 

with a 90° pulse and 1.7 seconds of recycling time. The collection time 

ranged from 45 minutes to 12 hours according with sample size. In the 

Varian 600 system, field frequency stability was maintained via the Varian 
1H-Scout acquisition sequence. MAG 2H enrichments were quantified from 

the 2H NMR spectra by measuring the intensity of each signal of the MAG 

hexose moiety relative to the mean intensity of the two intramolecular

methyl reference signals at 1.28 and 1.40 ppm (Jones et al. 2006b). Each 

reference signal represents three equivalent hydrogens enriched to 2.5% 

with 2H (i.e. corresponding to 7.5% enrichment for a single hydrogen site). 

After each acquisition, the solvents were immediately removed by 

evaporation and the dried samples saved until 13C NMR analysis. 

 

2.2.4.3 1H and 13C NMR analyses of MAG 

Samples were dissolved in 0.2 mL of 90% (v/v) acetonitrile-d3 in 

water. Proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra were acquired at 14.1 T with the 

Varian 600 spectrometer equipped with a 3 mm broadband probe. Spectra 

were obtained at 25 ºC. An acquisition time of 2.5 seconds and a pulse delay 

of 0.5 seconds were used and the number of acquisitions ranged from 5,000-

25,000. 1H NMR spectra were obtained in the same spectrometer equipped 

with a 3 mm indirect detection probe. Spectra were obtained at 25 ºC, using 

an acquisition time of 1.5 seconds and a pulse delay of 0.1 second. The 

number of acquisitions ranged from 22 to 512. 

The 13C enrichment level of MAG carbon 1 (13C1) was determined by 
1H NMR analysis of the hydrogen 1 signal (Figure 7). This resonance 

consists of a central doublet, D (from 1H-1H coupling to hydrogen 2 - 3JHH = 

3.8 Hz), representing hydrogens bound to 12C1, and a pair of satellite 

multiplets, SM (from heteronuclear direct 1H-13C coupling to 13C1 – 1JHC = 

184.5 Hz; 1H-1H coupling to hydrogen 2, and long range 1H-13C couplings to 

carbons 2 and 3 - nJHC, n&gt;1), representing hydrogens bound to 13C1. The 13C1 

enrichment level was estimated as the intensity of the SM divided by the 

total resonance intensity i.e. SM + D as follows:

Figure 7 1H NMR spectrum of a MAG sample enriched with 13C1 isotopomers. The 

resonance for position 1 hydrogen is shown, it consists of a central dublet (D) 
representing hydrogens bound to 12C1 and two satellite multiplets (SM) 
representing hydrogens bound to 13C1. The expansion for one of the satellite 
multiplets is also shown. 

 

The fractional contribution of [1-13C]-, [1,2-13C2]-, [1,2,3-13C3]- and [U-
13C]hexose isotopomers to the 13C1 enrichment of MAG was determined 

from analysis of the carbon 1 multiplet signal in the 13C NMR spectrum as 

follows. The 7-line multiplet (Figure 10) can be resolved into a singlet 

component (C1S), representing [1-13C]MAG, a doublet component (C1D) 

representing the sum of [1,2-13C2]- and [1,2,3-13C3]MAG isotopomers, and a 

quartet component (C1Q), representing [U-13C]MAG. The fractional 

contribution of each isotopomer component to the total 13C1 signal (C1 total) 

was calculated by measuring the 13C signal intensity of each component 

relative to that of C1 total. To obtain 13C isotopomer excess enrichments, the 

fractional isotopomer contribution to the 13C1 signal was multiplied by the 

total 13C1 enrichment, as shown below. Since [1-13C]MAG enrichment (but 

not the other isotopomers) has a significant contribution from the 1.1% 

natural abundance 13C, this amount must be subtracted from the estimated 

[1-13C]MAG excess enrichment as shown below.

2.2.5 Metabolic contributions parameters 

The non-hexose precursors or indirect pathway contribution to 

hepatic glycogen synthesis includes Cori cycle intermediates from 

metabolism of the glucose load as well as endogenous gluconeogenic 

precursors. The fractional contribution of non-hexose precursors to 

glycogen synthesis was calculated from the ratio of position 5 enrichment 

relative to that of position 2 (Landau et al. 1997) as shown in Equation 1. The 

balance represents the direct pathway flux from glucose as shown in 

Equation 2. The contribution of gluconeogenesis to plasma glucose was also 

calculated by Equation 1 and the hepatic glycogen’s contribution by 

Equation 2.

Equation 2  
Direct Pathway ?or glycogenolysis? ?%? ?  100 – Non?hexose precursors ?or gluconeogenesis? 

 

Based on the absence of any significant levels of [1-13C]glucose 

isotopomers derived from the metabolism of [U-13C]glucose (Perdigoto et al. 

2003; Mendes et al. 2006; Sena et al. 2007), it was assumed that the 

enrichment levels of [1-13C]MAG derived from glycogen or blood glucose 

reflects the contribution from the [1-13C]galactose tracer in the load.  

From Equation 1 to Equation 6, hepatic glycogen synthesis from 

hexose and non-hexose precursors were resolved as shown in Figure 4. The 

hexose sources are resolved into glucose and galactose precursors while the 

gluconeogenic sources are resolved into recycled or indirect pathway 

carbons derived from the load and endogenous gluconeogenic precursors. 



38|Chapter 2 
 

Since the fraction of galactose in the load was 10% enriched with [1-
13C]galactose, the percent contribution of galactose to total hepatic glycogen 

was estimated as the enrichment level of [1-13C]MAG multiplied by 10 with 

correction for the pre-existing residual unlabeled glycogen fraction (RG), as 

shown in Equation 3. The RG fraction was determined as the amount of 

residual glycogen measured in 24-hour fasted rats divided by the hepatic 

glycogen level at the end of each of the tracer load administrations. As for 

[1-13C]MAG, it was assumed that the enrichment levels of [U-13C]MAG 

derived from glycogen reflect the direct contribution from load glucose. 

Since enrichment of load glucose with [U-13C]glucose was also 10%, its 

contribution to hepatic glycogen was estimated as being 10 times [U-
13C]MAG enrichment, with correction for RG as shown in Equation 4.

The [1,2-13C2]- and [1,2,3-13C3]MAG isotopomer pair are assumed to 

be derived by gluconeogenic recycling of the glucose load via the Cori cycle 

and/or hepatic indirect pathway (Perdigoto et al. 2003; Mendes et al. 2006; 

Sena et al. 2007). In addition to the factor of 10 to account for the 10% [U-
13C]glucose precursor enrichment in the load, these isotopomer levels were 

multiplied by an additional factor of 1.5 to account for dilution at the level 

of the hepatic TCA cycle (Mendes et al. 2006), and corrected for residual 

unlabeled glycogen as shown in Equation 5. Isotopomers arising from 

indirect pathway metabolism of [1-13C]glucose formed via Leloir pathway 

metabolism of [1-13C]galactose were assumed to have negligible 

contributions to glycogen.

The percent contribution of endogenous gluconeogenic sources was 

estimated as the difference between load contribution (Equation 3 to 

Equation 5) and 100 as shown in Equation 6. 
 
Equation 6  
Endogenous gluconeogenic ?%?

Total non-hexose precursors contribution was also determined in an 

alternative way to that calculated by Equation 1 as the sum of endogenous 

gluconeogenic and load indirect contributions: 
 
Equation 7 

Non-hexose precursors ?%? ? Endogenous gluconeogenic ? Load indirect pathway 
 

Plasma glucose consists of glucose absorbed from the GIT (gastric 

glucose) plus glucose from EGP. The latter includes recycling of glucose 

from the load, glucose derived from glycogen, endogenous gluconeogenic 

precursors, and galactose. Except for gastric glucose, all the other sources 

result in 2H enrichment of blood glucose in position 2. It is assumed that (i) 

hepatic G6P/F6P exchange is complete and (ii) there is negligible cycling of 

plasma glucose and hepatic G6P via GK and G6Pase. The contributions of 

load galactose and load glucose (both gastric and recycled) were 

determined similarly to those for hepatic glycogen, as shown in Equation 8 

to Equation 10. Likewise, the contribution of endogenous sources was 

determined as the difference to 100 as shown in Equation 11.

40|Chapter 2 
 

Endogenous sources can be further resolved into gluconeogenesis 

and glycogen by analysis of blood glucose 2H enrichment from 2H2O. The 

H5/H2 ratio corrected for the presence of gastric glucose (not labeled with 
2H) is a measure of the total gluconeogenic contribution to blood glucose 

(Equation 12), which includes that of the recycled load. The balance 

(Equation 13) represents the combined contributions of glycogen and 

galactose, since both originate glucose enriched with 2H in position 2 but 

not 5. The contribution of endogenous gluconeogenic precursors (Equation 

14) was determined by subtracting that of the recycled load (Equation 10) to 

the total gluconeogenesis (Equation 12).

2.2.6 Statistics 

Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). 

Statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student’s t test and 

defined as a p &amp;lt;0.05 except when comparing more than two groups. In that 

case a one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed and 

differences among means determined by Fisher’s least significant difference 

(LSD) test.

2.3 Results  

2.3.1 Plasma glucose levels during the carbohydrate challenge 

Plasma glucose levels over the experimental period are depicted in 

Figure 8. Baseline glycemia was not significantly different between the two 

groups (65 ± 4 mg/dL for animals assigned to the GLU group and 66 ± 5 

mg/dL for animals assigned to the GLU+GAL group). After the 

carbohydrate loads, blood glucose levels increased rapidly, peaking at 30 

minutes (182 ± 8 mg/dL for the GLU group and 169 ± 7 mg/dL for 

GLU+GAL group). Blood glucose levels returned to the normoglycemic 

range 75 minutes past the administration of the carbohydrate loads and at 3 

hours, glycemia was 87 ± 3 mg/dL for the GLU animals and 92 ± 4 mg/dL 

for the GLU+GAL animals (p = n.s.).

under the curve (AUC) for plasma glucose levels. These values were similar 

in both experimental groups. At the end of the experiment, insulin levels for 

the GLU group were 1.1 ± 0.4 µg/L and 2.4 ± 0.4 µg/L for the GLU+GAL 

group (p = 0.05).

(net glycogen synthesis of 53 ± 10 µmol/gdw) and 41 ± 7 µmol of glucosyl

µmol per gram of tissue reported by others for Sprague-Dawley rats 

weighing 100 – 200 g fasted for the same period prior to receiving either the 

same dose of glucose (Jin et al. 2003) or a somewhat lower (1 g/kg) load 

(Niewoehner et al. 1992). Glycogen synthesized during the 3-hour period 

represented 85 ± 4% of the total hepatic content for the GLU group and 83 ± 

2% for the GLU+GAL group, hence the pre-existing residual unlabeled 

glycogen fraction accounted for ~15% of total glycogen for both groups.  

 

2.3.3 2H enrichments 

Animals in both GLU and GLU+GAL groups attained matching 
2H2O body water precursor enrichments (Table 1). This ~2% enrichment 

level, coupled with the rates of glucose production and hepatic glycogen 

synthesis, provided sufficient amounts of 2H in the derivatized glycogen 

and glucose samples to generate 2H NMR spectra with acceptable signal-to-

noise ratios for precise quantification of positional 2H enrichment levels. 

This is illustrated by the representative 2H NMR spectra of Figure 10.

Effect of galactose during a carbohydrate challenge|45 

Position 2 of both glycogen- and blood glucose-derived MAG is 

enriched with 2H from body water via its incorporation in the G6P common 

precursor in the G6P/F6P exchange. In both metabolites the 2H enrichment 

level of position 2 (2H2) was significantly lower than that of body water. 

This is due to the presence of unlabeled hepatic glycogen that was not 

completely depleted during the fasting period in the liver and of glucose 

from the oral load that remains in the blood at the end of the test. In the case 

of blood glucose the dilution effect caused by load glucose can completely 

account for the lower 2H2 enrichment of glucose in both experimental 

groups (see section 2.3.6). However, the dilution from residual glycogen 

doesn’t completely account for the reduced 2H2 enrichments observed in 

hepatic glycogen, especially in the GLU+GAL group (see section 2.3.5). 

Moreover, in the GLU+GAL group the 2H2 enrichment in hepatic glycogen 

tended to be lower (p = 0.06) than that in blood glucose demonstrating that 

the presence of galactose provides an additional dilution of the 2H2 

enrichment in glycogen.  

 

2.3.4 13C enrichments and isotopomer analysis 

The oral glucose or glucose + galactose loads enriched to 10% with 

[U-13C]glucose and [1-13C]galactose provided sufficient 13C enrichment of 

blood glucose and hepatic glycogen to generate 1H and 13C NMR spectra 

with acceptable 13C-signal intensities as shown in Figure 10. Thus, it was 

possible to precisely quantify 13C isotopomers from both [U-13C]glucose and 

[1-13C]galactose precursors. The 13C fractional enrichments and isotopomer 

levels derived by NMR analysis are shown in Table 2. 

Total glycogen 13C1 excess enrichment was not different between 

GLU and GLU+GAL groups, in agreement with the similar net glycogen 

synthesis amounts observed for the two groups by enzymatic 

measurements. The GLU group had no detectable excess enrichment from 

[1-13C]MAG isotopomer, in accordance with previous findings (Perdigoto et 

al. 2003; Mendes et al. 2006; Sena et al. 2007) while the GLU+GAL group had 



46|Chapter 2 
 

significant excess enrichment of [1-13C]MAG, reflecting the direct 

contribution of load galactose to hepatic glycogen. Excess enrichment levels 

of multiply-enriched glucose isotopomers ([1,2-13C2]- + [1,2,3-13C3]- and [U-
13C]MAG), which could not have been derived from [1-13C]galactose and 

therefore reflect only the contribution of load glucose metabolized via 

indirect pathway and/or Cori cycle, were significantly reduced in the 

GLU+GAL compared to GLU group.

The total 13C1 excess enrichment in blood glucose was similar 

between GLU and GLU+GAL groups, indicating that after 3 hours the 

hexose load was cleared from the blood at the same extent in both cases. 

This observation is in agreement with the similar glycemic curves registered 

for the experimental groups throughout the test. Similarly to the 

observations for glycogen-derived MAG, the enrichment levels of the [1-
13C]MAG isotopomer in the GLU group were very close to the natural 

abundance but were significantly higher in the GLU+GAL group. This 

demonstrates that galactose in the load also contributed to blood glucose. 

The excess enrichment levels for the multiply-enriched isotopomers ([1,2-
13C2]- + [1,2,3-13C3]- and [U-13C]MAG) that reflect the contribution of load 

glucose to blood glucose were similar in both groups. 



Effect of galactose during a carbohydrate challenge|47 

2.3.5 Hepatic glycogen synthesis 

For animals that received the simple glucose load, position 2 

enrichment of glycogen was significantly less than that of body water (Table 

1). This is due in part to the presence of residual unlabeled glycogen prior to 

the introduction of 2H2O, as already discussed. When this is taken into 

account, the theoretical enrichment of glycogen position 2 (i.e. assuming 

complete exchange of position 2 hydrogen via G6P/F6P exchange) is ~85 % 

that of body water. The measured enrichment of position 2 was only 73 ± 

5% that of body water indicating that G6P/F6P exchange experienced by 

G6P en route to glycogen was extensive but not complete and/or that this 

group of animals had a higher residual glycogen content compared to the 

group where residual glycogen was determined. For GLU+GAL animals, 

glycogen position 2 enrichment relative to body water was significantly 

lower, amounting to only 58 ± 3% of body water 2H. The incorporation of 

galactose into glycogen via UDPG does not involve exchange of position 2 

hydrogen with body water, thus the lower position 2/body water 

enrichment ratios observed for the GLU+GAL compared to the GLU group 

are consistent with this mechanism.  

From the analysis of 2H and 13C enrichment distributions of hepatic 

glycogen, the principal sources of hepatic glycogen synthesis for GLU and 

GLU+GAL groups were estimated. Conversion of glucose to glycogen via 

both direct and indirect pathways was resolved. Formally, the indirect 

pathway includes intra-hepatic metabolism of glucose to glycogen via 3-

carbon intermediates as well as glucose metabolized via the Cori cycle. The 

Cori cycle can be considered as an indirect pathway where the glycolytic 

phase (glucose ? pyruvate) occurs in peripheral tissues and the 

gluconeogenic phase (pyruvate ? G6P) occurs in the liver. The direct 

pathway involves the conversion of plasma glucose to glycogen via hexose 

intermediates (Figure 4). Glucose absorbed from the oral load as well as 

unlabeled circulating glucose existing prior the carbohydrate administration 

contributes to the direct pathway. In addition to direct and indirect 

contributions of the load carbohydrates, the glycogenic contribution of 



48|Chapter 2 
 

endogenous gluconeogenic precursors that were not derived from glucose 

recycling was also measured.  

For the GLU group, the direct pathway contribution from the load, 

as calculated from the dilution of [U-13C]glucose (Equation 4), accounted for 

less than one-third of all sources, see Table 3, matching the observations 

from Shulman et al. in a similar experimental setting (Shulman et al. 1985). 

The direct pathway contribution estimated by the 2H2O method was in 

excellent good agreement with that estimated by 13C isotopomer analysis 

(Table 4). Indirect pathway flux was dominated by unlabeled endogenous 

gluconeogenic precursors while indirect pathway/Cori cycle metabolism of 

the load glucose were subsidiary contributors as seen by the low abundance 

of [1,2-13C2]- plus [1,2,3-13C3]glucose isotopomers. 

When 10% of the oral glucose load was substituted by galactose, 

there were no significant changes in net glycogen synthesis, but glycogen 

sources were significantly modified. Although representing only 10% of the 

oral carbohydrate load, the galactose contributed about one-quarter of net 

hepatic glycogen synthesis. The 13C NMR analysis of glycogen-derived 

MAG indicates that the conversion of galactose to hepatic glycogen 

displaced contributions from both direct and indirect pathways of load 

glucose, but had no significant effect on the apparent endogenous 

gluconeogenic contribution to glycogen synthesis (Table 3).

2.3.6 Blood glucose sources 

Blood was collected at the end of the experimental period and the 

MAG derivative analysed by 1H, 13C and 2H NMR. Total gluconeogenesis 

(endogenous sources plus load glucose recycling), as estimated from the 

H5/H2 ratio in blood-derived MAG, contributed to 92 ± 4% of EGP in the 

GLU group and 95 ± 2% in the GLU+GAL group. These values were 

corrected for the presence of glucose from gastric absorption in order to 

determine the contributions to the overall blood glucose pool (Table 5).

The 2H enrichment in position 2 of blood glucose relative to the 2H 

enrichment in the body water provides an estimation of the EGP 

contribution to the circulating glucose, assuming that plasma glucose 2H 



50|Chapter 2 
 

enrichment by futile glucose/G6P cycling is negligible. In the GLU group 

this contribution was 75 ± 7%. That EGP accounted for such a large majority 

of plasma glucose under these conditions is surprising, since the glucose 

load would have been expected to suppress hepatic glucose output. In 

comparison, the contribution of the absorbed glucose from the load 

accounted for only 16 ± 1% of post-load plasma glucose (Table 6), which 

consistently adds up to the contribution from EGP to account for the overall 

blood glucose pool. Moreover, this indicates that most of the oral glucose 

load underwent rapid clearance. The presence of significant levels of 

recycled glucose isotopomers indicates that a substantial fraction of the 

cleared glucose was rapidly metabolized via the Cori cycle. Most 

surprisingly, about half of plasma glucose derived from endogenous 

gluconeogenesis that did not involved recycling of the glucose load (Table 

5).

For the animals receiving the carbohydrate mixture, the contribution

enrichment in position 2 relative to the body water was 79 ± 7%, similar to 

the one determined for the GLU group. Gastric glucose accounted for the 

remainder blood glucose with a 13 ± 1% contribution (Table 6). In this group 

of animals, the contribution of recycled glucose and endogenous 

gluconeogenic precursors was essentially the same as in the glucose-fed 



Effect of galactose during a carbohydrate challenge|51 

rats. The combined contributions from glycogen and galactose were similar 

to that of galactose by itself (see Table 5 and Table 6). These observations 

indicate that by 3 hours after the carbohydrate load, galactose that had been 

metabolized to G6P did not contribute significantly to hepatic glucose 

output and plasma glucose levels. 

 

2.4 Discussion 

2.4.1 Effect of galactose on direct and indirect pathway 

estimates with [U-13C]glucose and 2H2O tracers 

In this study, sources of hepatic glycogen synthesis following a load 

of pure glucose were quantified and compared with those following a load 

where 10% of the glucose was replaced by galactose. This proportion of 

galactose and glucose is representative of a breakfast meal containing a 

glass of skimmed milk – a standard source of protein for experimental 

breakfast meals. Given the rapid digestion of lactose and the fact that 

galactose is efficiently extracted and utilized by the liver, any effects of 

dietary galactose on direct/indirect pathway measurements are expected to 

be most pronounced in the initial stages of meal absorption. Interestingly, 

several studies with glucose tracers have shown that direct pathway 

contributions measured immediately after a mixed meal are significantly 

smaller than those measured 4-6 hours later (Shulman et al. 1990; Taylor et 

al. 1996). The study of Taylor et al. documents the presence of milk in the 

meal (Taylor et al. 1996), while the study of Shulman et al. (Shulman et al. 

1990) refers to a “standardized breakfast meal” which typically includes 

milk. By comparison, measurements performed during a glucose load 

infusion also show increases in direct pathway contributions over time 

(Stingl et al. 2006), but these changes are relatively modest when compared 

to those observed with meal studies. The hypothesis set for this study was 

that the uptake and metabolism of galactose from the breakfast meal could 



52|Chapter 2 
 

account for unexpectedly low values of direct pathway fluxes in the early 

stages of absorption.  

The experimental model adopted was able to recapitulate that effect 

by replacing a small fraction of the glucose load with galactose. When the 

direct pathway contribution was measured with [U-13C]glucose, it reported 

a 30% contribution to hepatic glycogen synthesis for animals administered 

with glucose only. For animals that were administered with the 

glucose/galactose mixture, the direct pathway contribution reported by [U-
13C]glucose was significantly reduced by one-third to 20%. Since net 

glycogen accumulation was not significantly different to that of the glucose 

only group, this indicates that galactose competed against the direct 

pathway for glycogen synthesis. In addition, it was found that the indirect 

pathway contribution from load glucose was also reduced by one-third 

(24% to 16%). However, the apparent contribution from unlabeled 

gluconeogenic sources was not significantly altered by galactose 

metabolism. 

With the 2H2O method, the fractional contribution of indirect 

pathway flux to glycogen synthesis was estimated from the ratio of position 

5 enrichment to that of position 2 (H5/H2) and the direct pathway 

contribution is estimated as the balance. Since UDPG derived from 

galactose is not enriched with 2H in any position, this activity will 

systematically dilute all positional 2H enrichments of glycogen hence the 

H5/H2 ratio and direct/indirect pathway estimates based on this value will 

not be modified. In the absence of galactose, the direct pathway contribution 

obtained by this analysis (32%) matched the 30% estimate obtained with [U-
13C]glucose tracer. With galactose present, the observed H5/H2 ratio 

yielded an identical direct pathway contribution (29%) indicating that this 

analysis was insensitive to the contribution of galactose to glycogen 

synthesis. As predicted, the presence of galactose systematically reduced the 
2H enrichment in all positions of glycogen relative to that of body water. 

Assuming that the enrichment in position 2 of glycogen derived from 

glucose metabolism is equivalent to that of body water, then in theory, the 



Effect of galactose during a carbohydrate challenge|53 

difference between the enrichment in position 2 of glycogen and that of the 

body water should correspond to the fraction derived from galactose. 

However, in this experimental setting this analysis has high uncertainty 

since equilibration of UDPG position 2 and body water hydrogens was 

incomplete and the amount of pre-existing unlabeled glycogen could not be 

directly determined. After adjusting for these parameters, the galactose 

contribution was estimated to be 18%, in fair agreement with the 23% 

estimate obtained directly with the [1-13C]galactose tracer.  

 

2.4.2 Dominance of the indirect pathway of glycogen synthesis 

A key finding of this study was that the indirect pathway was the 

dominant source of hepatic glycogen synthesis even after a pure glucose 

load. Both [U-13C]glucose and 2H2O tracers reported a ~70% indirect 

pathway contribution for the animals receiving the glucose only bolus. In a 

similar oral glucose test performed on 24-hour fasted rats, Jin et al. found an 

even higher indirect pathway contribution, accounting for ~90% of post-

load glycogen synthesis (Jin et al. 2003). 

In 24-hour fasted rats, hepatic glycogen is extensively depleted 

(Niewoehner et al. 1992; O'Doherty et al. 2000; Jin et al. 2003) therefore the 

maintenance of plasma glucose levels is almost completely dependent on 

gluconeogenesis. Following oral administration of a large glucose load, 

glucose disposal pathways must be activated while EGP from 

gluconeogenesis needs to be suppressed in order to maintain glucose 

homeostasis. In this setting, the diversion of gluconeogenic G6P flux from 

glucose to glycogen synthesis is a fast and effective means of suppressing 

EGP under these conditions. The observation that a significant fraction of 

synthesized glycogen was derived from endogenous gluconeogenic 

precursors is consistent with this mechanism. Moreover, this flux was 

maintained in the face of competition from galactose suggesting that under 

the conditions of our study, the diversion of gluconeogenic G6P to glycogen 

is somehow prioritized over other glycogenic fluxes. Under normal fasting-



54|Chapter 2 
 

feeding conditions where the transition from negative to positive 

endogenous glucose balance is less abrupt, the gluconeogenic contribution 

to glycogen synthesis is present, but it accounts for a smaller fraction (~50%) 

of hepatic glycogen synthesis (Chapter 4).  

 

2.4.3 Conversion of the hexose load into hepatic glycogen 

For both the glucose and glucose-galactose loads, the synthesis of 

hepatic glycogen represented a very minor fraction of the total carbohydrate 

disposal. For example, out of the 2.6 mmol oral glucose load, only 68 µmol, 

or 2.6%, was converted to glycogen by all (direct plus indirect) pathways. 

With glucose and galactose loads, the fractional hepatic extraction of 

glucose to glycogen synthesis was significantly further reduced to 1.1%, (i.e. 

25 µmol of the 2.3 mmol load, p &amp;lt;0.01 compared to the fraction from 

glucose only load). While the conversion of load galactose (~230 µmol) to 

glycogen was relatively more efficient, it nevertheless accounted for only 

7.4% of the total, amounting to ~15 µmol.  

 

2.4.4 Endogenous glucose production during the carbohydrate 

challenge 

One striking feature about the glucose dynamics during this 

experiment was the high contribution of EGP to plasma glucose levels a 

short time after the administration of a large glucose bolus. This was 

determined by a novel method based on the 2H enrichment level of plasma 

glucose position 2 from 2H2O and is dependent on the assumption that there 

is negligible cycling between plasma glucose and hepatic G6P. When this 

cycle is active, position 2 of plasma glucose can be enriched from 2H2O 

independently of EGP. Glucose/G6P cycling activity has been previously 

measured as an increased rate of [2-3H]glucose turnover relative to that of 

[U-14C]glucose (Dunn et al. 1976). In the 2H2O experiment, glucose/G6P 



Effect of galactose during a carbohydrate challenge|55 

cycling activity would result in unlabeled glucose molecules, including 

those absorbed from the load, being enriched in position 2. This has two 

important and verifiable consequences on the 2H and 13C enrichment data. 

First, the EGP contribution to plasma glucose as measured by position 2 

enrichment from 2H2O would be overestimated while the contribution of 

absorbed glucose would be correspondingly underestimated. Therefore, the 

gastric glucose contribution as directly reported by the 13C tracer would be 

higher than that estimated by the 2H2O method (indeed if all plasma glucose 

underwent glucose/G6P cycling the apparent gastric glucose contribution 

would be zero). In fact, the gastric contribution reported by the [U-
13C]glucose tracer (13-16%) was comparable to the fraction of plasma 

glucose that was not labeled in position 2 from 2H2O (15-21%). The second 

consequence of glucose/G6P futile cycling would be to reduce the plasma 

glucose H5/H2 ratio compared to that of glycogen. Data from this 

experiment show that plasma glucose H5/H2 ratios were higher than those 

of glycogen indicating that there was no preferential enrichment of plasma 

glucose position 2 from 2H2O by glucose/G6P cycling. Based on these 

observations, it is conclude that in comparison to EGP activity, cycling 

between plasma glucose and hepatic G6P did not significantly contribute to 

plasma glucose enrichment from 2H2O.

2H2O 

In these experiments effective glycogen synthesis was accompanied 

by a minor contribution of glycogenolysis to blood glucose. The estimation 

of glycogenolysis relies on the assumption that glucose derived from 

glycogen is enriched with 2H in position 2 but not 5. However, in this 

experiment the majority of glycogen was enriched in both positions 2 and 5, 

reflecting the high contribution from three carbon precursors and as a 

result, the calculations based on the 2H labeling pattern of blood glucose 

may underestimate the actual contribution from GP activity. However, since 



56|Chapter 2 
 

the glycogenolytic contributions were very minor accounting for the 

glycogen precursor pool enriched beforehand does not significantly change 

the overall source contributions to plasma glucose5.     

 

2.5 Conclusions 

This study demonstrates that a relatively low amount of galactose, 

similar to what would be expected from a breakfast meal containing dairy 

products, has a significant effect on direct and indirect pathway estimates 

using current tracer methods. With 13C NMR isotopomer analysis of suitable 
13C-enriched glucose and galactose substrates, the galactose contribution to 

glycogen synthesis may be resolved from those of glucose and non-hexose 

precursors. When this is not possible or practical, galactose should be 

excluded from the dietary carbohydrate load.  

In terms of its overall effects on glucose metabolism and disposal, 

galactose utilization resulted in a decreased contribution of load glucose to 

hepatic glycogen synthesis but it had little effect on the clearance of glucose 

into peripheral tissues. 

 

 

 

 

                                                      
5 For example, considering that 85% of the hepatic glycogen was synthesized during the 3-
hour test and that of this fraction ~70% derived from the indirect pathway (i.e. non-hexose 
precursors), then about 60% of the total hepatic glycogen pool is labeled in both positions 2 
and 5. The contribution of glycogenolysis to the plasma glucose pool corrected by this factor 
yields ~11% compared to the original ~7% estimation.

SOURCES OF BLOOD GLUCOSE AND HEPATIC GLYCOGEN 
SYNTHESIS DURING A GLUCOSE CHALLENGE IN DIABETIC 

RATS – EFFECT OF A SINGLE INSULIN DOSE. 

3.1 Introduction 

In the clinical setting, the OGTT is commonly used to discriminate 

among several pre-diabetic conditions although it is not applied to type 1 

diabetic patients (WHO 2006). Nonetheless, the OGTT is widely used in 

experimental animal models of type 1 DM in the context of evaluating and 

comparing the efficacy of antidiabetic agents. Sometimes, the intravenous or 

the i.p. routes are also used in animals to deliver a glucose load. Generally, 

the aim of the test is to evaluate the glycemic response over time as a 

measure of glucose disposal. The glucose tolerance test represents a very 

straightforward approach for assessing the antidiabetic efficacy of 

pharmacological agents (Marti et al. 2001) or dietary supplementation 

(Akhani et al. 2004; Lo et al. 2006), for example. 



58|Chapter 3 
 

By introducing [U-13C]glucose and 2H2O in tracer amounts during 

the OGTT, load glucose clearance, pathways of glucose production and 

glycogen synthesis can be disclosed (see Chapter 2). Given that 

hyperglycemia in STZ-diabetic rats results in part from deficient glucose 

disposal (Wi et al. 1998) the tracer-enriched OGTT may provide insight on 

the underlying metabolic alterations and how they change with antidiabetic 

intervention. To address those questions the OGTT protocol presented in 

chapter 2 was performed on STZ-diabetic rats and STZ-diabetic rats 

previously injected with a single dose of insulin so that the effect of the drug 

on glucose disposal could be evaluated. Insulin was delivered by two 

different routes, the traditional s.c. route and the i.p. route, which results in 

higher hepatic insulinization (Mason et al. 2002). Hence, it was anticipated 

that any hepatic-specific insulin action in the context of glucose disposal 

would be detected and characterized under this experimental setting. 

 

3.2 Materials and methods 

3.2.1 Animal studies 

3.2.1.1 Animal housing 

As described in section 2.2.1.1. 

 

3.2.1.2 Animal protocols 

Rats (270 ± 3 g) were given a 50-65 mg/kg intra-peritoneal injection 

of STZ (Sigma-Aldrich, Portugal) dissolved in 10 mM citrate buffer pH 4.5 

to induce diabetes. Animals that did not develop hyperglycemia 1 day after 

the injection were given the same dose of STZ the following days up to a 

total of 3 doses. Animals were considered diabetic when glycemia was &gt; 250 

mg/dL. 



Effect of insulin during a glucose challenge in diabetic rats|59 

On the 20th and 21st days following the induction of diabetes, animals 

were fasted for 24 hours and then randomized into three groups. In two of 

the groups, rats were injected insulin (Actrapid®, Novo Nordisk, kindly 

donated by the Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra) at a dose of 5 U/kg 

to the s.c. route (SC, N = 5) or the i.p. route (IP, N = 5). In the other group 

(STZ, N = 5), animals did not receive any injection. Thirty minutes after the 

insulin dose, all animals were administered 2H2O and gavaged a glucose 

load enriched to 10% with [U-13C]glucose and glycemia monitored for a 3-

hours period, as described in section 2.2.1.2. The GLU group in the 

experiment described in chapter 2 was used as non-diabetic control for the 

present experiment. In order to determine the basal fasting liver glycogen 

content a separate group of 24-hour fasted STZ-diabetic animals (N = 5) 

were sacrificed without receiving the glucose load. 

 

3.2.2 Metabolite analyses 

Glucose was extracted from the blood, hepatic glycogen isolated 

hydrolyzed to glucose and quantified, as described section 2.2.2. Glucose 

was converted to MAG as described in section 2.2.3. Exogenous (human) 

insulin levels were determined in the plasma obtained after centrifugation 

of a small blood sample by ELISA enzyme immunoassay (Mercodia, 

Sweden) accordingly with the supplier’s instructions.

3.3 Results 

3.3.1 Induction of diabetes and performance during the OGTT 

Successful induction of diabetes was confirmed 4 days after STZ 

injection by the presence of typical symptoms like hyperglycemia (374 ± 17 

mg/mL), weight loss (weight represented ~80% of the initial), polydepsia 

and polyuria. On day 20, after 24 hours of fasting, the glycemia registered 

for the STZ was significantly higher than that found for control animals 

(Table 7).  

 
Table 7: Glycemia values registered at the beginning and at the end of the oral glucose 
tolerance test (OGTT); area under the curve (AUC) determined for the glycemia profiles in 
Figure 11; exogenous insulin and hepatic glycogen determined at the end of the OGTT. After 
a 24-hour fast STZ-diabetic rats (STZ), STZ-diabetic rats injected a single 5 U/kg insulin dose 
by the subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal (IP) route, and non-diabetic controls (Control) 
were gavaged a 2 g/kg glucose load and sacrificed 3 hours after. Insulin was injected to 30 
minutes before the OGTT. Values not sharing a common superscript letter are significantly 
different; statistical significance was accepted for a p &amp;lt;0.05 determined by one way ANOVA 
with Fisher’s LSD post test. N.D., not determined.

The glycemia variation over the OGTT experiment is depicted in 

Figure 11 and is expressed as percent from initial value (at time t = 0 

minutes). In all groups of animals, after the oral gavage of glucose, glycemia 

increased more than 100% in the first 30 minutes. In the STZ, that increment 

followed for another 30 minutes with the peak occurring at 60 minutes. On 



Effect of insulin during a glucose challenge in diabetic rats|61 

the other hand, in the non-diabetic controls, SC and IP the glycemia for that 

time corresponds to the descending phase of the curve. Moreover, the 

injection of insulin to the diabetic animals translated into an increase of the 

slope of the descending part of the glycemia curve.  

 

 

 
Figure 11 Glycemia profiles (expressed as % from initial value) registered during the 180 

minutes of the oral glucose tolerance test. Experimental groups are as described in 
the legend of Table 7. 

 

Table 7 summarizes the performance of the different experiment 

groups subjected to the OGTT. The overall glycemia response during the 

OGTT was evaluated by determining the AUC corresponding to t0?180. The 

AUC for STZ tended to be higher than that of controls (p &amp;lt;0.1). Both IP and 

SC groups displayed significantly lower AUC than STZ. Furthermore, the 

AUC for IP was similar to that of controls whereas in the SC group it was 

significantly lower. This observation is in agreement with higher peripheral 

glucose uptake in the case of the s.c. route relative to the i.p., in the first half 

of the test, as indicated by the marked decrease in glycemia (Figure 11). 

With time, glycemia for the IP group approached that of the SC and, at the 

end of the test, the glycemia values observed for both the IP and SC groups 

were similar and under the physiological range. On the other hand, by that 

time, non-diabetic controls had recovered from the oral glucose load and

again displayed glycemia within the physiological range, whereas in the 

STZ glycemia remained elevated. Exogenous insulin was quantified from 

the blood collected at the time of sacrifice and there were no significant 

differences between the values detected for IP and SC.  

All groups of STZ-diabetic rats displayed higher levels of hepatic 

glycogen relative to non-diabetic controls. However, contrarily to what was 

observed for controls (see chapter 2, section 2.3.2) after 24 hours of fasting, 

hepatic glycogen content was not nearly depleted in the STZ-diabetic rats, 

amounting to 373 ± 41 µmol/gdw. These values were not changed after the 

OGTT and when insulin was previously injected to the STZ-diabetic rats 

(SC and IP) glycogen levels in the liver were still similar to those of STZ. 

These observations indicate that, for the STZ-diabetic rats, there was no net 

glycogen synthesis in the liver in the context of the OGTT, even in the 

presence of insulin.  

 

3.3.2 13C and 2H metabolite enrichments 

The body water 2H enrichment level was determined from a small 

blood sample and was similar among all groups: 2.04 ± 0.06%, STZ; 1.80 ± 

0.10%, IP; 1.98 ± 0.15%, SC; and 2.01 ± 0.05%, Control. With this level of 

enrichment, the positional 2H enrichments obtained in blood glucose 

allowed for an adequate 2H NMR analysis in non-diabetic controls and STZ 

as shown in Figure 12. In those groups, 2H enrichment of blood glucose-

derived MAG was 1.51 ± 0.13% and 1.52 ± 0.16%, respectively. However, 

because in IP and SC groups little glucose could be extracted from the blood 

due to the hypoglycemia experienced by those animals, the 2H NMR spectra 

obtained in those cases didn’t have a signal to noise ratio adequate for a 

confident analysis.  

The 13C enrichment level at C1 of MAG from blood glucose was 4.35 

± 0.10% in the non-diabetic controls, similar to that determined in the STZ: 

4.62 ± 0.23%. In the diabetic animals injected with insulin prior the OGTT, 

the 13C enrichment levels in C1 of MAG from the blood were significantly 



Effect of insulin during a glucose challenge in diabetic rats|63 

lower than the ones observed for the STZ and control groups: 2.27 ± 0.21%, 

SC; and 2.06 ± 0.25%, IP.

C1 is shown; the central singlet C1S represents [1-13C]MAG, the doublet 
component C1D represents the sum of [1,2-13C2]- and [1,2,3-13C3]MAG

NMR spectra depicts the resonances from H1 to H6S.

to those we determined in the non-diabetic controls (5.50 ± 0.49%). In fact in 

the STZ, IP and SC groups, the 13C1 enrichment level was very close to the 

1.11% natural abundance: 1.40 ± 0.10%, in the STZ; 1.26 ± 0.06%, in the IP 

and 1.34 ± 0.04% in the SC. Hence, in these animals there was no efficient 

glycogen synthesis from the oral glucose load, in perfect agreement with the 

similar hepatic glycogen content prior and after the test as determined by 

the enzymatic measurement. 

 

3.3.3 Sources to blood glucose 

The relative contributions to blood glucose were calculated from the 

equations presented in section 2.2.5 and are shown in Table 8. To determine 

the concentration of glucose derived from each source, the percent 

contribution was multiplied by the glycemia registered at the end of the 

experiment. This analysis is depicted in Figure 13. 

 
Table 8: Percent contributions of various sources to blood glucose 3 hours after the glucose 
tolerance test. Experimental groups are as described in the legend of Table 7. The oral load 
was enriched with 2H2O and [U-13C]glucose tracers. The corresponding equations used to 
derive the source contributions are also indicated. Values not sharing a common superscript 
letter are significantly different; statistical significance was accepted for a p &amp;lt;0.05 determined 
by one way ANOVA with Fisher’s LSD post test. N.D., not detectable.

3.3.3.1 Comparison between Control and STZ 

In the STZ, all the absolute contributions to blood glucose were 

elevated when compared to controls (Figure 13). Hence, both a reduced 



Effect of insulin during a glucose challenge in diabetic rats|65 

clearance of the oral load as well as an increased contribution from 

endogenous sources account for the hyperglycemic state of those animals. 

For this reason, the relative contributions of load glucose (gastric + recycled) 

and endogenous precursors to blood glucose were similar between STZ and 

Control (Table 8). These findings are in line with the observations from 

infusion studies by Wi et al where, one day after a 75 mg/kg STZ injection, 

hyperglycemia was associated with both increased glucose output and 

reduced clearance (Wi et al. 1998). Furthermore, those authors correlated the 

defects in glucose clearance with a decreased uptake of plasma glucose by 

the skeletal muscle. That mechanism also provides a good explanation for 

the present observations of reduced recycled glucose contribution in the 

STZ-diabetic rats since the apearence of recycled glucose relies largely on 

skeletal muscle uptake and metabolism of the parent [U-13C]glucose tracer.

IP groups is shown. For each source, bars not sharing a common letter are 
significantly different; statistical significance was accepted for a p &amp;lt;0.05 
determined by one way ANOVA with Fisher’s LSD post test. 

 

In the STZ, the contribution of EGP to blood glucose, as estimated by 

the 2H enrichment level of glucose position 2 relative to that of the body 

water was 72 ± 6%. This value is consistent with combined contributions of

endogenous precursors and recycled load (78%), determined by analysis of 
13C isotopomer enrichment indicating that the enrichment of position 2 from 
2H2O was representative of net hepatic glucose output rather than futile 

glucose/G6P cycling. Moreover, the contribution of EGP to plasma glucose 

is similar to the 75 ± 7% determined for controls (see chapter 2). Finally, in 

both cases, gluconeogenesis dominated EGP as estimated by the H5/H2 

ratio: 0.89 ± 0.03 for STZ and 0.92 ± 0.04 for Control. 

 

3.3.3.2 Effect of the insulin dose 

Insulin administration to the STZ-diabetic rats in the IP and SC 

groups significantly altered glucose load disposal. In those groups the [U-
13C]glucose isotopomer was no longer detectable in the blood 3 hours after 

the oral gavage (see Figure 12), indicating that almost all of the glucose load 

had been cleared from the circulation. Additionally, the contribution of 

glucose from recycling of the load was significantly reduced relative to both 

STZ and Control groups. These observations, together with the absence of 

net glycogen synthesis in the liver, suggest that glucose may have been 

oxidized or stored as glycogen in the skeletal muscle. 

At the end of the test, more than 90% of blood glucose had derived 

from endogenous sources in the STZ-diabetic rats injected with insulin 

(Table 8). This contribution represented a glucose concentration similar to 

that observed in the non-diabetic controls, indicating that insulin reduced 

the contribution of EGP relative to the STZ-diabetic rats. 

Because of the poor signal to noise ratio that characterized most of 

the 2H NMR MAG spectra from blood glucose in SC and IP groups, the 

relative contributions of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to EGP could 

not be quantified with confidence. Nevertheless, the similar intensities for 

H5 and H2 signals of blood glucose-derived MAG obtained from these 

animals (Figure 12) clearly indicate that gluconeogenesis was the main 

source of EGP in both cases.

3.3.4 Hepatic glycogen synthesis 

Hepatic glycogen synthesis in the setting of the OGTT was fully 

characterized in chapter 2 for the non-diabetic controls. In the case of STZ-

diabetic rats, there was no net glycogen synthesis in the liver. This was 

demonstrated by the similar glycogen content found in the liver of those 

animals before and after the OGTT, in contrast to what was observed for 

non-diabetic controls that had 10 times more glycogen after the test (see 

section 2.3.2). Insulin administration prior to the OGTT had no effect on the 

hepatic glycogen content. Furthermore, the percent 13C excess enrichment 

determined in the glycogen of rats from STZ, IP and SC groups was ~0.2%, 

much lower than the ~4% detected in the non-diabetic controls subjected to 

the same protocol. 

 

3.4 Discussion 

Without food intake blood glucose levels depend on EGP derived 

either from glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis. The gluconeogenic 

contribution increases with the time of fasting. For example, in non-diabetic 

rats after 6 hours of fasting, gluconeogenesis accounts for about two thirds 

of EGP whereas after 24 hours of fasting that contribution represents over 

90% of EGP (Nunes et al. 2009). In the present studies (see also chapter 2) 

hepatic glycogen levels were highly depleted in control rats after the 24-

hour fast, in good agreement with high gluconeogenic activity.  

Unlike controls, the STZ-diabetic rats showed substantial levels of 

glycogen in the liver after the 24-hour fast. This has been previously 

reported by other authors (Friedmann et al. 1963; Ferrannini et al. 1990; 

Peroni et al. 1997). Apparently, these animals did not utilize hepatic 

glycogen stores during fasting, in accordance with the dominance of 

gluconeogenesis over glycogenolysis to EGP both in the post absorptive 

state and after 24 hours of fasting (Peroni et al. 1997). Interestingly, 

Friedmann et al showed that in diabetic rats, hepatic glycogen could be 



68|Chapter 3 
 

depleted by prolonging the fasting period to 48 hours or by glucagon 

treatment and that refeeding after these interventions resulted in efficient 

hepatic glycogen synthesis, although the maximal glycogen levels still 

remain under those of non-diabetic controls (Friedmann et al. 1963).  

As expected, gluconeogenesis also dominated EGP in the diabetic 

animals, contributing to more than 60% of blood glucose at the end of the 

test. This percent contribution was similar to that observed for controls but 

the respective absolute contribution was much higher. In fact, all the 

absolute contributions to blood glucose were increased in the diabetic rats. 

The tracer-enriched OGTT protocol demonstrated that after the 

administration of the oral glucose load to STZ-diabetic rats, the contribution 

of load glucose adds to that from glucose production to account for the 

elevated blood glucose levels observed at the end of the test. These findings 

are in line with elevated EGP (Blondel et al. 1989; Peroni et al. 1997; Wan et 

al. 2000) and reduced glucose clearance (Wi et al. 1998) in the post 

absorptive state in STZ-diabetic rats.  

A single insulin injection prior to the glucose challenge altered the 

glycemia response of the STZ-diabetic rats, resulting in a rapid and 

pronounced decrease of plasma glucose levels. This enhanced glucose 

uptake from circulation resulted from two combined mechanisms. On the 

one hand, insulin reduced the absolute contribution of endogenous sources 

to the plasma glucose pool from the abnormally elevated values in the STZ-

diabetic rats to control levels. In addition, insulin strongly promoted 

glucose clearance. This last action is most probably a consequence of 

peripheral uptake rather than hepatic disposal and storage as no efficient 

glycogen synthesis was detected. The persistent hypoglycemia observed in 

the final minutes of the test is in agreement with the absence of glucagon 

counterregulation to insulin-induced hypoglycemia in the STZ-diabetic rats 

injected with insulin, by opposition to the glucagon response that follows 

normal insulin secretion in non-diabetic rats (Zhou et al. 2004).

3.5 Conclusions 

In STZ-diabetic rats both a deficient glucose clearance in peripheral 

tissues and an excessive glucose production contribute to the hyperglycemic 

state throughout the OGTT experiment. Hepatic glycogen serves as short-

term reservoir for endogenous gluconeognenic flux when fasted controls 

receive an oral glucose load. In this way, EGP may be rapidly suppressed. 

Data from these studies show that this mechanism is inoperative in the STZ-

diabetic rats. Insulin administration to STZ-diabetic rats reduced the 

contribution of EGP to plasma glucose and, most importantly, enhanced 

peripheral glucose disposal; but had no effect on diverting the 

gluconeogenic flux from EGP to hepatic glycogen synthesis during the 

OGTT.

GLUCOSE PRODUCTION AND HEPATIC GLYCOGEN AND LIPID 
SYNTHESIS DURING AD LIBITUM FEEDING CONDITIONS IN 

RATS – EFFECT OF DIABETES 

4.1 Introduction 

In humans, direct and indirect pathway contributions to hepatic 

glycogen are quantified by analysis of plasma glucose and UDP-glucose 

enrichment following infusion of a glucose tracer as part of an intravenous 

glucose load (Hellerstein et al. 1995) with corrections for recycling of the 

labeled carbon (Magnusson et al. 1987). Alternatively, the tracer can also be 

given as part of a meal (Taylor et al. 1996; Bischof et al. 2002) to study the 

pathways of glycogen repletion under normal feeding conditions. This 

approach is poorly suited to study hepatic glycogen synthesis in ad libitum 

fed rats since they tend to feed intermittently over the entire dark period of 

the diurnal cycle (Benavides et al. 1998). While there have been studies of 

glycogen synthesis under artificial substrate delivery conditions such as 

glucose infusion (Katz et al. 1989) or after a glucose load (Newgard et al. 



72|Chapter 4 
 

1983; Shulman et al. 1985) there is no reported measurement of direct and 

indirect pathway activities in rats during their natural feeding routine. Since 

postprandial hepatic glycogen levels are sensitive to dietary composition 

(Gaíva et al. 2003; MacQueen et al. 2007), measurement of direct and indirect 

pathway activities under baseline conditions is essential for evaluating the 

effect of disease or other interventions on these fluxes. 

To quantify hepatic glycogen repletion via direct and indirect 

pathways during ad libitum feeding, the positional 2H-enrichment of hepatic 

glycogen was analyzed following the administration of 2H2O at the 

beginning and throughout the feeding cycle. The contribution of indirect 

pathways of hepatic glycogen synthesis was estimated by the ratio of 

glycogen 2H enrichment in position 5 relative to position 2 (H5/H2), see 

chapter 1. Moreover, the relative contributions of gluconeogenesis and 

glycogenolysis to EGP could also be disclosed by determining the H5/H2 

ratio in blood glucose. 

With the present 2H2O administration protocol it was also possible to 

determine the contribution of DNL to the hepatic TG pool. That fraction was 

determined by analysis the 2H enrichment in the methyl group of the 

hepatic TG relative to that of the body water as reported by Delgado et al. 

(Delgado et al. 2009a).  

The key advantages of this assay are the simplicity of tracer 

administration (no infusion catheters required) and that it can be applied to 

any substrate delivery setting including clamp studies, oral or i.p. glucose 

load and ad libitum feeding. In this study, this method was applied to define 

the effect of STZ-induced diabetes on hepatic pathways for glucose disposal 

and storage as glycogen or TG and also pathways for EGP in ad libitum fed 

rats.

4.2.1 Animal studies  

4.2.1.1 Animal housing 

As described in section 2.2.1.1. 

 

4.2.1.2 Animal protocols 

Rats (245 ± 4 g) were rendered diabetic by STZ injection as described 

in section 3.2.1.2. One group of animals consisted of non-diabetic control 

rats that were not injected with STZ (Control, N = 6). The other 3 groups 

consisted of STZ-diabetic rats studied at day 4 (STZ-4, N = 6), 10 (STZ-10, N 

= 8) or 20 (STZ-20, N = 8) after the induction of the disease. At 7 pm all 

animals received a loading dose of 99% 2H2O in saline by injection into the 

i.p. cavity. Assuming 70% body weight as water, the dose was calculated to 

enrich the body water to 2% or 3%. To maintain body water enrichment, 

their drinking water was enriched to 5% with 2H2O. At 8 am the next 

morning, animals were anesthetized by injection of ketamine (2 mL/kg) in 

the i.p. cavity, the abdominal cavity was opened and ~5 mL of blood were 

collected from the abdominal aorta. A small blood sample (0.5 mL) was 

reserved for determination of 2H2O body water enrichment and plasma 

insulin levels. The liver was excised and immediately freeze-clamped in 

liquid nitrogen.  

A group of control rats (N = 5) was sacrificed at 7 pm without 

receiving the 2H2O tracer and the livers harvested for determining the 

baseline glycogen and TG content.  

 

4.2.2 Metabolite analyses 

Glucose was extracted from the blood, hepatic glycogen isolated, 

hydrolyzed to glucose and quantified and plasma insulin levels quantified 



74|Chapter 4 
 

as described section 2.2.2. Glucose was converted to MAG as described in 

2.2.3. Part of the lyophilized liver powder underwent lipid extraction 

accordingly with the method developed by Folch et al. (Folch et al. 1957). 

Briefly, approximately 1 g of powder was treated with 40 mL of 

chloroform:methanol (2:1, v:v). After centrifugation the liquid phase was 

recovered and 8 mL of NaCl (0.9%) were added, the solutions were 

vigorously mixed, centrifuged and the lower phase collected. Chloroform 

was evaporated under nitrogen flux and the lipid content stored at -20ºC 

until further analysis.  

 

4.2.3 NMR spectroscopy 

As described in sections 2.2.4, 2.2.4.1 and 2.2.4.2 

 

4.2.3.1 1H and 2H analysis of lipids 

Lipid samples were treated as described by Delgado et al (Delgado et 

al. 2009a). Briefly, lipids were dissolved in 0.6 mL of chloroform and 150 µL 

of a pyrazine-d4 solution were added as internal reference standard for 

quantification of hepatic TGs and determination of 2H methyl enrichment 

levels. 1H and 2H NMR spectra were acquired at 25 ºC using the Varian 600 

system equipped with a 5 mm broadband probe. 1H NMR spectra of lipid 

samples consisted of one scan obtained using an acquisition time of 3 

seconds and served for quantification of the hepatic TG content. 2H NMR 

spectra were obtained within 3 to 12 hours (depending on the amount of 

sample and 2H enrichment level) using a 90º pulse, an acquisition time of 5 

seconds and a pulse delay of 2 seconds. The amount of 1H-TG was 

determined by comparing the area of the methyl hydrogens with that of the 

pyrazine hydrogens in the 1H NMR spectrum of each sample and the 

amount of 2H-TG was determined by comparing the areas for those signals 

in the respective 2H NMR spectrum. Hence, the hepatic TG content was 



Hepatic metabolism in ad libitum fed control and diabetic rats |75 

calculated as the sum of 1H- and 2H-TG. The absolute 2H methyl enrichment 

was calculated as follows: 
 

2H methyl enrichment ?
2H?TG

2H?TG ? 1H?TG 
 

This quantification method was tested for linearity using a series of 

palmitic acid standards solutions prepared in chloroform from known 

amounts of [U-2H]palmitic acid so that enrichment levels ranged from 

0.035% to 0.40% (Figure 14).

4.2.4 Metabolic contributions parameters 

The percent contribution of gluconeogenesis to EGP and the indirect

of glycogenolysis to EGP and direct pathway to glycogen were calculated as 

the balance, as shown in Equation 2 (page 37). 

The contribution of newly-synthesized glycogen to the hepatic 

glycogen pool during overnight feeding was calculated from the ratio of 

glycogen position 2 to body water 2H-enrichments. Likewise, the 

contribution of newly synthesized TGs (DNL) to the hepatic TG pool was 

calculated as the ratio of 2H methyl enrichment to body water 2H 

enrichment.

4.3 Results 

4.3.1 Induction of diabetes 

In this study, STZ-diabetic rats were assayed in three early stages of 

the disease. The first stage corresponded to 4 days after STZ injection and 

the other two corresponded to 10 and 20 days. In all of those stages animals 

were profoundly hyperglycemic (Table 9). This observation is in agreement 

with the reduced levels of plasma insulin determined for STZ-10 and STZ-

20. Moreover, the hepatic glycogen content was reduced and the TG levels 

increased with the induction of diabetes by this method, in accordance with 

reports from other authors for SZT-diabetic rodent models (Pighin et al. 

2005; Fernandes et al. 2010). These alterations were observed 10 and 20 days 

after the injection of STZ, but not at 4 days. Hence, 4 days after STZ 

injection, although rats develop hyperglycemia they still have hepatic 

glycogen and TG levels comparable with controls.

4.3.2 Metabolite 2H enrichment levels 

Animals were kept under 2H2O administration overnight (~12 

hours). The body water 2H enrichment level was determined from a plasma 

sample at the end of that period and matched the target values (Table 10). 

For both blood and liver metabolites of interest, 2H NMR spectra with 

sufficient signal to noise for a reliable quantification of 2H excess enrichment 

were obtained (Figure 15 and Figure 17). This includes the hepatic TGs 

obtained for STZ-10 and STZ-20 groups, where the excess 2H enrichment 

levels were very low due to a vastly decreased DNL activity.

4.3.3 Metabolic parameters 

4.3.3.1 Sources of glucose production 

The 2H enrichment of position 2 of blood glucose relative to that of 

body water reflects the contribution of EGP to the circulating glucose. The 

remainder originates from absorption in the GIT. In non-diabetic controls, 

EGP accounted for 40 ± 4% of blood glucose and was similar to that 

determined in all STZ groups. Since STZ animals were hyperglycemic, they 

probably displayed higher rates of EGP coupled with increased food intake 

due to diabetes-related hyperphagia. Interestingly, the contribution of EGP to 

blood glucose in STZ-10 and STZ-20 was significantly higher than that 

observed for STZ-4, 46 ± 2% and 44 ± 5% vs 32 ± 2%, respectively. This likely 

reflects a weaker control (i.e. suppression) of EGP in animals that had been 

diabetic for a longer period. The STZ-10 and STZ-20 groups were additionally 

characterized by a significantly higher gluconeogenenic contribution to EGP 

compared to the STZ-4 group, which presented values comparable with non-

diabetic controls (Figure 16).

4.3.3.2 Hepatic glycogen synthesis 

In order to confirm that, under normal conditions, rats efficiently 

accumulate glycogen in the liver during feeding, hepatic glycogen content 

was quantified in non-diabetic controls at the beginning of the dark phase. 

In that group of animals, glycogen levels were 613 ± 75 µmol/gdw, 

significantly lower than the 907 ± 84 µmol/gdw determined in the morning 

(Table 9). This finding is in line with the circadian rhythm of hepatic 

glycogen, which increases during the dark phase and is consumed during 

the light phase under normal ad libitum feeding conditions (Lanza-Jacoby et 

al. 1986; Benavides et al. 1998). The net glycogen synthesis overnight 

represented about one third of the total hepatic glycogen content 

determined at the beginning of the light phase. This value is in excellent 

agreement with the estimation of glycogen synthesis from the 2H 

enrichment in glycogen position 2 relative to that in body water, which 

reported a 34 ± 7% contribution in controls (Table 11). In the STZ-4 group 

this contribution was similar to controls but it increased significantly in 

STZ-10 and STZ-20, representing in those cases more than half of the 

glycogen. The higher fractional synthesis values detected for the STZ-10 and 

STZ-20 groups are consistent with the smaller glycogen pool observed for 

those animals. In fact, the amount of glycogen synthesized during the 

experiment (total amount of glycogen × 2H2-Glycogen/2H-body water) was 

similar among the several groups.

Despite the fact that the same amount of glycogen was synthesized 

overnight, the pathways for glycogen synthesis in the liver were altered in 

all STZ groups (Figure 18). In the STZ-4 group the indirect pathway was 

increased relative to controls and in STZ-10 and ST-20 groups it completely 

dominated glycogen synthesis in the liver.

4.3.3.3 Hepatic triglycerides and de novo lipogenesis 

Figure 19 depicts a representative 1H NMR spectrum obtained after 

the extraction of hepatic lipids by the Folch method. The resonance at ~0.8 

ppm represents the terminal methyl groups of fatty acid chains (Noula et al. 

2000; Ren et al. 2008) and was used to quantify the hepatic TG content by 

comparison with the internal pyrazine standard. In control rats, the amount 

of hepatic TGs at the beginning of the dark phase was 168 ± 17 µmol/gdw. 

After an overnight feeding the hepatic TG content was 212 ± 22 µmol/gdw 

(Table 9), which is not significantly different from that determined in the 

group of rats sacrificed at the beginning of the dark phase.

During feeding, TGs synthesized de novo are enriched with 2H from 
2H2O whereas those derived from the diet or adipose tissue lipolysis are 

unlabeled and therefore contribute to the dilution of the 2H labeling from 

DNL. To the extent that the hepatic TG pool has not turned over during the 

overnight feeding phase, the presence of unlabeled TGs in the liver prior to 

the administration of 2H2O also contributes to that dilution. The 2H-enriched 

TGs were quantified from analysis of the 2H NMR spectra of hepatic lipids 

(Figure 20).

As shown in Table 12, the contribution of DNL to the hepatic TG 

pool in the STZ-4 group was half of that determined for controls. In STZ-10 

and STZ-20 groups DNL represented no more than 2.5% of the hepatic TG 

pool. These findings indicate that the dietary and/or lipolytic contribution 

to hepatic TGs is increased in all STZ groups especially in the STZ-10 and 

STZ-20, in which the hepatic TG levels were about the double of those 

determined for the other groups (Table 9).

4.4 Discussion 

4.4.1 Addressing the absorptive state 

The circadian rhythm of the organism rules many biological functions. 

In the light cycle of rodents, the dark phase is characterized by high 

locomotive activity and oxygen consumption (Williams et al. 2000; Yamaoka et 

al. 2008) parallel to an increase in insulin levels (Benavides et al. 1998) and food 

and water intakes (Armstrong et al. 1980; Johnson et al. 1990; Benavides et al. 

1998). Perhaps not surprisingly, gene array experiments performed over a 24-

hour period clearly demonstrate that rat liver gene expression oscillates 

accordingly with the light cycle, including the expression of enzymes involved 

in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (Almon et al. 2008). Hence, during 

feeding, pathways for glucose disposal and storage must be favoured against 

glucose production.  

The studies described on this chapter were designed to follow several 

metabolic insulin-dependent pathways during the natural feeding cycle of 

rats. The protocol consisted on keeping the animals under 2H2O 

administration overnight so that pathways for glucose production, hepatic 

glycogen and TG synthesis could be simultaneously traced in one single 

experimental setting by 2H NMR methods. With this methodological approach 

there is no interference with the animals’ natural feeding behaviour and hence 

the data obtained reflect the metabolic performance in the absorptive state 

under ad libitum conditions. The baseline measurements determined in non-

diabetic rats were sensitive to the STZ-induced type 1 DM, making this a 

valuable protocol for addressing the effect of any intervention in the context of 

diabetes.  

 

4.4.2 Sources to blood glucose and hepatic glycogen synthesis 

During the absorptive phase, blood glucose may be derived from 

both dietary absorption and endogenous production. In the present 

experimental setting, assuming the G6P/F6P exchange is complete and 



86|Chapter 4 
 

there is no substancial glucose/G6P cycling, glucose from EGP is enriched 

with 2H in position 2 to the same level as body water and that enrichment is 

diluted by glucose derived from absorption. In the STZ-diabetic rats, the 

relative contributions of EGP and dietary sources to blood glucose were 

similar to those determined for non-diabetic controls, despite much higher 

glycemia values for the STZ-diabetic animals. Insulin deficiency is expected 

to result in higher endogenous contributions to feeding plasma glucose 

levels as a result of impaired EGP suppression. However, STZ-diabetic rats 

also eat more than controls (see also chapter 915, Table 14), due to the 

hyperphagia associated with the lack of hypothalamic insulin and leptin 

signalling (Sindelar et al. 1999; Akirav et al. 2004). This would translate into 

an increased uptake of dietary glucose. Therefore, the observation that EGP 

and dietary contributions to blood glucose levels in the hyperglycemic STZ 

rats were similar to those of normoglycemic controls may be explained by 

systematic increases in both EGP and glucose absorption rates for the STZ-

diabetic rats.  

In the non-diabetic controls, the 2H2O method indicated that 

immediately after an overnight feeding, gluconeogenesis accounts for the 

majority (approximately two thirds) of EGP. This is similar to estimates 

obtained after 6 hours of fasting in the same rat specie and using the same 

methodology as that described in these experiments (Nunes et al. 2009). 

Saadatian et al. report a somewhat lower (~50%) contribution of 

gluconeogenesis to EGP (Saadatian et al. 2000), using mass spectrometry 

methods. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that 

gluconeogenesis is continually active in non-diabetic free-feeding rats and 

does not appreciably change during the fed to fasted transition.  

In control rats only ~30% of the hepatic glycogen was synthesized 

overnight and of that fraction ~50% was enriched with 2H from 2H2O-enriched 

body water in both positions 5 and 2. The 2H2O method relies on the 

assumption that only glucose derived from gluconeogenesis is enriched with 
2H from 2H2O in both positions 5 and 2. But, because under the present 

experimental protocol 15% (30% × 50%) of the total hepatic glycogen was also 



Hepatic metabolism in ad libitum fed control and diabetic rats |87 

enriched with 2H in both positions 5 and 2, the contribution of glycogenolysis 

may be underestimated, but to a minor degree. Applying the 15% correction 

factor yields a 35% (instead of the 30%) contribution of glycogenolysis to EGP. 

Hence, under these circumstances, the 2H2O method is fairly reliable. 

However, in the case of diabetic rats studied 10 and 20 days after STZ 

injection, because of the high glycogen turnover (~60%) and the complete 

dominance of the indirect pathway (~95%), the majority of the glycogenolytic 

contribution to blood glucose is indistinguishable from the gluconeogenic 

contribution because the glucose derived from glycogen is labeled in both 5 

and 2 positions. Furthermore, since the amount of glycogen synthesized 

overnight was apparently the same in all groups, the reduced glycogen levels 

observed in the later stages of STZ-diabetes must be a consequence of 

excessive glycogen breakdown. Taken together, these observations indicate 

that, at least 10 days after induction of diabetes by STZ injection to rats, there 

was extensive glycogen degradation with simultaneous synthesis during the 

absorptive state (i.e. glycogen cycling).  

 

4.4.3 Estimation of de novo lipogenesis 

With the induction of diabetes there was a drastic reduction on the 

DNL contribution to the hepatic TG pool and this was immediately detected 4 

days after STZ injection. These observations are in line with Cohen’s (Cohen 

1987) experiments in perfused livers from control and STZ rats reporting that 

in the latter case the flux through pyruvate carboxylase is increased relative to 

that through pyruvate dehydrogenase resulting, amongst other things, in the 

recruitment of pyruvate into gluconeogenesis, rather than its oxidation to 

acetyl-CoA molecules for lipogenesis. 

The synthesis of TG de novo in the liver was estimated by 2H NMR 

analysis of the hepatic lipid content as the ratio of the 2H-methyl enrichment 

relative to that of body water. Although this estimation provides valuable 

insight on the hepatic lipid kinetics it is not an accurate quantification of the 

contribution of DNL to the hepatic TG content. Ideally, the 2H enrichment in 



88|Chapter 4 
 

the methyl-TG should be compared to that of the precursor acetyl-CoA pool 

but that intermediate is scarce and difficult to isolate. Therefore, a necessary 

simplifying assumption is that the hepatic 2H acetyl-CoA enrichment is 

equivalent to that of body water. It is not know to what extent the acetyl-CoA 

methyl hydrogens directly exchange with those of water in the cellular 

environment, but it is well know that many of the key acetyl-CoA precursors – 

notably pyruvate – exchange extensively (Kuwajima et al. 1986) while others, 

such as fatty acids, involve the direct adition of water hydrogens to the methyl 

group when undergoing ?-oxidation to acetyl-CoA. 

Under feeding conditions, pyruvate is considered to be the main 

source of acetyl-CoA (Cohen 1987) and the incorporation of 2H from body 

water in pyruvate is extensive (Kuwajima et al. 1986) but not necessarily 

complete (Silva et al. 2011). To the extent that the true acetyl-CoA 2H 

enrichment is less than that of body water, DNL contributions to the hepatic 

TG pool are systematically underestimated.  

Another factor affecting the estimations of DNL is the turnover of the 

hepatic TG pool. After 12 hours under 2H2O administration it is possible that 

the TGs did not turn over completely and hence pre-existing TGs may be 

accounting for the dilution of the 2H labelling in addition to the contribution of 

dietary and/or adipose tissue-derived TGs. Nonetheless, the DNL 

contribution determined in this experiment for non-diabetic controls was in 

the range of that found by Delgado et al. after 72 hours of 2H2O administration 

(Delgado et al. 2009a), suggesting the TG pool turned over during the 

overnight 2H2O protocol. In the case of the STZ diabetic rats, TG turnover may 

take longer given the higher hepatic pool.  

 

4.4.4 Progressive metabolic disruption in STZ-diabetes and 

relationship between carbohydrate and lipid metabolism 

Experimental diabetes was induced by injection of STZ in the i.p. 

cavity and rats studied 4, 10 and 20 days afterwards. In all cases, rats were 

profoundly hyperglycemic. This finding is consistent with the rapid 



Hepatic metabolism in ad libitum fed control and diabetic rats |89 

development of diabetic symptoms in the STZ-diabetic rat model (Burcelin 

et al. 1995; Sindelar et al. 1999; Wei et al. 2003). Furthermore, data from this 

study indicate that some metabolic pathways are altered in the first days 

following STZ injection and that those alterations are sustained afterwards. 

For example, at day 4 , the relative pathways to EGP were similar to controls 

and the contributions of the direct pathway to glycogen and DNL to hepatic 

TG – although reduced compred to controls – were not as low as those 

observed for the other STZ groups. In the later stages of diabetes (10 and 20 

days after STZ injection), the complete dominance of gluconeogenesis to 

both glycogen synthesis and glucose production correlates with the 

profound reduction of the lipogenic flux. Moreover, the elevated levels of 

TGs in the livers from 10- and 20-day STZ-diabetic rats suggest adipose 

tissue lipolysis is likely to be the dominant source for hepatic TGs. Among 

other things, the increased abundance of hepatic lipids helps to sustain high 

rates of gluconeogenesis and EGP.  

 

4.5 Conclusions 

The 2H2O protocol for the study of the absorptive phase under natural 

feeding conditions was successfully applied to both non-diabetic controls and 

STZ-diabetic rats. With one single experiment, it identified early alterations in 

hepatic carbohydrate and lipid metabolism following ? cell destruction by 

STZ. Namely, DNL was profoundly reduced as early as 4 days after the 

induction of diabetes. By that time the indirect pathway to glycogen synthesis 

was already increased relative to controls but the contributions of 

glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to blood glucose were normal. In the later 

stages of STZ-diabetes, gluconeogenesis was the major source of both EGP and 

glycogen synthesis. The dominance of the gluconeogenic (indirect) pathway to 

glycogen synthesis and the rapid turnover of the hepatic pool via glycogen 

cycling translated into an extensive enrichment of hepatic glycogen positions 5 

and 2 from 2H2O. This likely resulted in an underestimation of the

glycogenolytic contribution to EGP as determined by the overnight 2H2O 

method.

SYNTHESIS DURING AD LIBITUM FEEDING CONDITIONS IN 

RATS – EFFECT OF INSULIN REPLACEMENT  

5.1 Introduction 

Type 1 diabetic patients have insufficient pancreatic insulin secretion 

and thus must rely on exogenous insulin supply to avoid persistent 

hyperglycemia and related complications. With the conventional s.c. insulin 

treatment the peripheral tissues are the ones that receive most of the insulin 

dose. On the other hand, i.p. insulin administration is able to mimic the 

physiological insulin release, maintaining a portal/peripheral gradient 

concentration with insulin absorption occurring evenly through splanchnic 

and peripheral routes (Radziuk et al. 1994). In fact, under physiological 

conditions, insulin is secreted by the pancreas to the portal vein and the 

liver accounts for the extraction of a 50-80% fraction (Radziuk et al. 1994; 

Utzschneider et al. 2004).  



92|Chapter 5 
 

There are some studies highlighting the relevance of i.p. insulin 

delivery in the context of diabetes treatment. Implanted insulin pumps that 

deliver insulin by i.p. infusion reduce the risk of hyperglycemia, and offer a 

better metabolic control compared with s.c. infusion pumps (Catargi 2004). 

Intraperitoneal insulin has also been administered to diabetic patients with 

end-stage renal disease undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal 

dialysis and this allowed for improving the glycemic control over 

conventional s.c. delivery (Nevalainen et al. 1997).  

Experiments in STZ-diabetic rats have demonstrated the beneficial 

effect of i.p. insulin on reducing glucose production, peripheral 

hyperinsulinemia, and improving glucose disposal relative to s.c. insulin 

(Mason et al. 2000; Wan et al. 2000). However, those studies were performed 

in post-absorptive conditions (after 5-6 hours of fast) and it would be of 

interest to evaluate the effect of i.p. insulin in natural feeding rats. 

During feeding, insulin stimulates the usage of glucose and its 

storage as glycogen and lipids in the liver. This is accomplished by diverse 

mechanisms through changes in enzyme activities and/or expression 

(overviewed in section 1.3.1). Since the liver is the organ targeted with i.p. 

insulin delivery, it can be hypothesized that the hepatic metabolic pathways 

will respond differently to the s.c. or i.p. insulin therapies. This chapter 

describes and discusses the experiments set to test that hypothesis. The 

methodological approach was the same described in chapter 4 to address 

hepatic insulin-dependent metabolic pathways during the absorptive state 

in rats. In addition, gene expression and enzyme activities for some key 

metabolic enzymes involved in those pathways were also assessed. The 

alterations detected in STZ-diabetes were recapitulated and in parallel the 

effect of insulin replacement during a short period was addressed. Insulin 

therapy began two weeks after the induction of diabetes, when the 

pathways for glucose production, hepatic glycogen and lipid synthesis were 

already severely disrupted (see chapter 4).

5.2 Materials and methods 

5.2.1 Animal studies 

5.2.1.1 Animal housing 

As described in section 2.2.1.1. 

 

5.2.1.2 Animal protocols 

Rats (280 ± 2 g) were rendered diabetic by STZ injection as described 

in section 3.2.1.2. Eight days after diabetes induction animals were assigned 

at random into 3 groups: one group of animals was administered a s.c. 

insulin injection at a dose of 15 U/kg twice a day at 8 am and 7 pm (group I-

SC, N = 9); a second group of animals received an i.p. insulin injection at the 

same dose and times as the I-SC group (group I-IP, N = 9); finally, a third 

group of animals received no treatment at all (group D, N = 7). Animals 

were kept under the insulin treatment protocol for 9 or 10 days. Blood 

glucose and TG levels were monitored throughout the experimental period 

with an Accu-check and Accutrend (Roche, Portugal) meters, respectively. 

At the end of the treatment period, 30 minutes after the night insulin 

injection, animals received a loading dose of 99% 2H2O in saline by injection 

into the i.p. cavity and the experiment proceeded as described in section 

4.2.1.2. Animals were sacrificed the next morning. Blood was collected for 

glucose extraction and NMR analysis and a small blood sample was 

reserved for determination of 2H2O enrichment levels, insulin and NEFA in 

the plasma. The liver was excised, immediately freeze-clamped in liquid 

nitrogen. A small liver sample was reserved for enzyme activities assays 

and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the remainder 

lyophilized. Epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT) was collected and 

weighted. 

The control group in the experiments described in chapter 4 was 

used in this study for sake of comparison.

5.2.2 Metabolite analyses 

Glucose was extracted from the blood, hepatic glycogen isolated, 

hydrolyzed to glucose and quantified and plasma insulin levels quantified 

as described section 2.2.2. Exogenous (human) insulin was quantified in the 

plasma as described in 3.2.2. Glucose was converted to MAG as described in 

section 2.2.3. Hepatic lipids were extracted as described in section 4.2.2. 

Plasma NEFA were determined enzymatically with NEFA-HR assay kit 

(Wako chemicals, Germany).

5.2.4 Metabolic contributions parameters 

As described in section 4.2.4. 

 

5.2.5 Enzyme activities assays 

Enzyme activities assays were carried out as previously described 

(Metón et al. 1999; Caseras et al. 2000), with some modifications. Crude 

extracts for assaying enzyme activities were obtained by homogenization of 

the powdered frozen liver (1/5, w/v) using a PTA-7 Polytron (Kinematica 

GmbH, Switzerland) mixer (position 3, 30 seconds), and centrifugation at 

15,800 rcf for 40 minutes at 4 ºC. The homogenization buffer used in the 

assays for PFK, PK, G6PDH and 6PGDH activities consisted of 50 mM 

tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris)-HCl pH 7.5, 4 mM 

ethylenediaminetetracetic acid, 50 mM NaF, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl 

fluoride, 1 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol and 250 mM sucrose. In the 

homogenization buffer used in the assay GK activity 100 mM KCl was also 

included and the crude extract filtered through a 1 mL Sephadex G 25 



Metabolic effects of insulin replacement in ad libitum fed diabetic rats |95 

column after centrifugation. Assays for enzyme activities and total protein 

were adapted for automated measurement using a Cobas Mira S 

spectrophotometric analyzer (Hoffman-La Roche, Switzerland). All enzyme 

assays were carried out at 4 ºC and followed at 340 nm. For determining GK 

activity 5 µL of filtered sample extract were assayed in a final volume of 200 

µL containing 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.75, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 1 

mM NADP, 2.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM glucose and 1 mU/mL 

G6PDH. The reaction was triggered with the addition of 60 mM ATP and 

100 mM or 0.5 mM glucose. The GK activity was determined by subtracting 

the activity measured at 0.5 mM glucose from that measured at 100 mM 

glucose. PFK activity was assayed in a final volume of 200 µL containing 100 

mM Tris HCl pH 8.25, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 0.15 mM NADH, 4 mM 

ammonium sulfate, 12 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM F6P, 30 mM G6P, 

0.675 U/mL fructose bisphosphate aldolase, 5 U/mL triose-phosphate 

isomerase, 2 U/mL glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and 4 µL crude 

extract. The reaction was triggered after addition of 10 mM ATP. The 

specific assay conditions for PK activity were: 250 µL of final volume 

containing 70 mM glycylglycine pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 0.15 

mM NADH, 2.8 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 21 U/mL lactate 

dehydrogenase and 4 µL of sample. ADP (2.5 mM) was added to monitor 

the PK reaction. G6PDH activity was measured using 4 µL sample in a final 

volume of 200 µL containing 77.5 mM imidazole-HCl pH 7.7, 5 mM MgCl2, 

1 mM NADP and 1 mM G6P. The assay conditions for 6PGDH activity 

were: 82.7 mM imidazole-HCl pH 7.7, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM NADP, 2 mM 

6-phosphogluconate and 4 µL crude extract in a final volume of 200 µL. The 

total protein content was determined in Cobas Mira S at 600 nm by the 

Bradford method (Bio-rad, Spain) at room temperature in liver crude 

extracts using bovine serum albumin as a standard. 

 



96|Chapter 5 
 

5.2.6 Real-time PCR 

Total messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was isolated from frozen 

liver samples using the Speedtools Total RNA Extraction Kit (Biotools, 

Spain). Single strand complementary DNA (cDNA) templates for PCR 

amplification were synthesized from 1 µg of total mRNA by incubation with 

moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT) (Promega 

Biotech Iberia SL, Spain) at 37 ºC for 1 hour, accordingly to supplier’s 

instructions. The RT reaction product was diluted 1/20 in milli-Q water and 

real-time quantitative PCR was performed in an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence 

Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Spain) using 0.4 µM of each primer, 

10 µL of SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems, Spain) and 1.6 µL of diluted 

cDNA. The temperature cycle protocol for amplification was: 50 °C for 2 

minutes, 95 °C for 10 minutes, followed by 48 cycles with 95 °C for 15 

seconds and 62 °C for 1 minute. 

The primer pairs used are listed in table 1 and were designed with 

Oligo Explorer 1.2 (Gene Link) except for PEPCK, reproduced from 

(Okamoto et al. 2008) and 18S, reproduced from (Palou et al. 2008). 

Ribosomal subunit 18 was chosen as the housekeeping gene to normalize 

expression levels of targets between different samples. Variations in gene 

expression were calculated by the standard ??Ct method. For all pairs of 

primers linearity was confirmed with consecutive dilutions (from 1/10 to 

1/500) of a cDNA test sample.

5.3 Results 

5.3.1 Induction of diabetes and animals’ performance during 

the insulin treatment protocol 

 Eight days after the injection of STZ, the body weight of the animals 

was significantly reduced to 261 ± 3 g (representing 93% of their initial weight) 

and blood glucose levels ranged from 394 to over 600 mg/dL, indicating the 

successful induction of type 1 DM. This was further confirmed by the reduced 

endogenous insulin levels determined at the end of the experiment for group 

D relative to the healthy controls (Table 14).  

Throughout the experimental follow-up, the animals in group D 

continued to lose weight, while the ones kept under insulin treatment tended 

to gain weight (Figure 21). At the end of the insulin replacement protocol, the 

body weight of untreated diabetic animals was 234 ± 10 g, significantly lower 

than the 288 ± 7 g and the 270 ± 5 g observed for I-SC and I-IP, respectively (p 

= 0.06, I-SC vs I-IP). Furthermore, the weight variation was quantified by the 

AUC in the weight vs time plot (Table 14), and was significantly increased for 

groups I-SC and I-IP relative to group D. Taken together, these observations 

demonstrate the positive effect of insulin on weight gain. Consistent with this 

finding, EWAT also increased with insulin treatment. 

As presented in Table 14, food and water consumption determined at 

the end of the experiment, were sensitive to the diabetic condition and also 

insulin treatment. In non-diabetic controls food consumption was 23 g/day, 

and water intake 35 mL/day, in good agreement with reports from several 

other authors (Havel et al. 1998; Dib 1999; Wei et al. 2003). As expected, 

diabetic animals ate and drank significantly more than controls. Insulin 

replacement decreased food (p &amp;lt;0.05, D vs I-IP and p = 0.06 D vs I-SC) and 

water intakes in the treated diabetic rats, but the observed values were still 

higher than control levels.

Table 14: Biochemical and physiological parameters determined during the insulin replacement study 
in untreated STZ-diabetic rats (D), STZ-diabetic rats treated with insulin by subcutaneous (I-
SC) or intraperitoneal (I-IP) injection twice a day at a dose of 30 U/kg/day and non-diabetic 
controls (C). Glycemia and plasma triglyceride measurements were performed 2 hours after 
the morning insulin injection on the 8th day of insulin treatment. Food and water 
consumption were measured in the last 24 hours prior to the sacrifices. Weight evolution is 
expressed as the area under the curve (AUC) in the weight vs time plots, from days 0 to 10. 
All the other parameters correspond to post mortem measurements. For each parameter, 
values not sharing a common superscript letter are significantly different; statistical 
significance was accepted for a p &amp;lt;0.05 determined by one way ANOVA with Fisher’s LSD 
post test. N. D., not determined, NEFA, non-esterified fatty acids, EWAT, epididimal white 
adipose tissue.  

 

Glycemia determined in the 8th day of the insulin treatment protocol, 2 

hours after the morning dose, was successfully reduced to control values in 

both I-SC and I-IP groups. However, glycemia observed after an overnight 

feeding (i.e. ~12 hours after the night insulin injection) was similar between 

treated and untreated STZ-diabetic rats and was on the hyperglycemic range 

(D, 563 ± 14 mg/dL; I-SC, 525 ± 38 mg/dL; and I-IP, 551 ± 20 mg/dL). 

Nonetheless, exogenous insulin was still detected in the plasma of animals 

from I-SC and I-IP groups in the morning.  

For the animals kept under insulin treatment, plasma TG levels were 

similar to control values whereas the untreated diabetic rats showed

significantly elevated plasma TGs, in agreement with reports from other 

authors (Dong et al. 2002; Mason et al. 2002; Iwasaki et al. 2005). The effect of 

insulin replacement on lowering the plasma TG levels may be a consequence 

of the enhanced chylomicron-TGs clearance by stimulation of LPL in the 

adipose tissue. This is consistent with the accumulation of fat as demonstrated 

by the higher content of EWAT in the insulin-treated diabetic animals relative 

to the untreated ones. In addition, insulin may also contribute to lower plasma 

TGs by inhibiting their hepatic secretion in VLDL. 

 

 
 
Figure 21 Plot of the animals’ body weight as a function of time during the insulin 

replacement period. Eight days after STZ injection, diabetic rats were left 
untreated (D) or injected a 15 U/kg insulin dose twice a day by the subcutaneous 
(I-SC) or intraperitoneal (I-IP) route.  

 

On the other hand, the concentration of NEFA in the plasma was 

similar between non-diabetic controls and untreated STZ-diabetic rats, and 

unlike reports from other authors (Wan et al. 2000; Dong et al. 2002), insulin 

replacement did not cause a reduction of NEFA values. Instead, and 

surprisingly, plasma NEFA concentration increased in the insulin-treated 

groups. This observation can be related to the larger mass of adipose tissue 

those animals presented. Actually, if plasma NEFA concentration is 

normalized for the mass of EWAT, the values for insulin treated rats tend to be 

lower than those for the STZ-diabetic rats.

Metabolic effects of insulin replacement in ad libitum fed diabetic rats |101 

Similarly to the findings from the experiments described in chapter 4, 

hepatic glycogen content was reduced and TG levels increased in the 

untreated diabetic rats relative to controls. Insulin replacement in the I-IP 

group increased glycogen levels back to control values. On the other hand, in 

the I-SC group, although hepatic glycogen content was significantly higher 

than that observed for untreated diabetic rats, it was still lower than control 

levels. In contrast with observations from other authors (Shimomura et al. 

1999), hepatic TG content remained elevated in the diabetic rats receiving the 

insulin replacement treatments. 

 

5.3.2 2H enrichment levels and metabolic parameters  

After the insulin replacement period (9 or 10 days) all the animals 

were administered 2H2O and left to feed ad libitum overnight to trace the 

absorptive metabolism. The accurate body water 2H2O precursor 

enrichment was determined by 2H NMR analysis of plasma samples and 

reached the target value of 2% (Table 15). With these range of values, 

plasma glucose, hepatic glycogen and lipids were also enriched with 2H to 

levels that, coupled with the amount of sample recovered, allowed precise 

analysis by 2H NMR. All the STZ-diabetic rats had comparable 2H2O 

precursor enrichment levels. However, the insulin-treated rats, 2H 

enrichment in position 2 of blood glucose was higher than that of untreated 

STZ-diabetic rats, indicating insulin enhanced glucose turnover. On the 

other hand the 2H2 enrichment in glycogen was lower in the rats 

experiencing the insulin replacement protocol, consistent with the bigger 

hepatic glycogen pool. Insulin increased the absolute 2H enrichment in the 

methyl-TG, indicating a stimulation of the lipogenic pathway and reduction 

of the dietary and/or lipolytic contribution since the hepatic TG content was 

similar among all STZ-diabetic rats.

5.3.2.1 Sources of glucose production 

Deuterium-enriched glucose molecules derive from EGP whereas 

unlabelled ones originate from the diet and subsequent gastrointestinal 

absorption to the blood stream. Hence, the contribution of EGP to blood 

glucose was assessed by the 2H enrichment of position 2 of blood glucose 

relative to that of body water (2H2/2H-BW). In non-diabetic control animals 

EGP accounted for 40 ± 4% of blood glucose. This contribution was similar 

to that observed for group D (44 ± 4%) because in these animals the 

increased food intake is parallel to higher rates of EGP (see discussion in 

chapter 4, section 4.4.2). In the cases where the animals were subjected to the 

insulin treatment protocols, the contribution of EGP to blood glucose was 

significantly higher reaching 73 ± 3% in group I-SC and 71 ± 5% in group I-

IP. The fact that insulin administration by both s.c. and i.p. routes translated 

into a higher contribution of EGP to blood glucose relative to that coming 

from the diet is consistent with the reduction on food intake and thus on the 

contribution of unlabeled dietary glucose. However, apparently, insulin did 

not efficiently reduce the rates of EGP under feeding conditions. 

Figure 22 represents the glycogenolytic and gluconeogenic 

contributions to EGP as determined by 2H NMR analysis of MAG derivative

from blood glucose. The H5/H2 ratio, which reflects the contribution of 

gluconeogenesis, was 0.95 ± 0.03 for the untreated diabetic animals, 

significantly higher than the 0.69 ± 0.04 observed for non-diabetic controls. 

When the STZ-diabetic animals were treated with insulin, the H5/H2 ratio 

was significantly reduced relative to group D and similar to that of healthy 

controls: 0.60 ± 0.03 for group I-SC and 0.62 ± 0.03 for group I-IP.

5.3.2.2 Hepatic glycogen synthesis 

The contribution of glycogen synthesized during the 2H2O 

administration protocol to the total hepatic glycogen pool is reflected in the 
2H enrichment in position 2 of glycogen relative to the body water’s. With 

insulin administration, the 2H2 enrichment in glycogen was significantly 

reduced (Table 15).

of the hepatic glycogen was synthesized overnight, reproducing the 

observations from the experiments described in chapter 4. On the other 

hand, when the STZ-diabetic animals were treated with insulin, only one 

third of the hepatic glycogen was synthesized overnight, similar to the 

findings for the non-diabetic control animals. Because non-diabetic controls 

and insulin treated STZ-diabetic animals have higher glycogen levels the 

amount of glycogen synthesized overnight is actually similar in all groups.

Metabolic effects of insulin replacement in ad libitum fed diabetic rats |105 

The pathways for glycogen synthesis are depicted in Figure 23 and 

were altered by the induction of diabetes with the indirect pathway 

increasing from 54 ± 4% in the non-diabetic controls to 99 ± 1% in the 

untreated STZ-diabetic animals. Insulin treatment restored the 

direct/indirect pathways contributions to control levels with the indirect 

pathway accounting for 47 ± 2% in group I-SC and 49 ± 2% in group I-IP. 

 

5.3.2.3 Hepatic triglycerides and de novo lipogenesis 

In agreement with the observations from the experiments described 

in chapter 4, DNL was significantly reduced in group D when comparing to 

controls but the hepatic TG content was higher. This observation indicates 

that the contribution of dietary and/or lipolytic sources is increased in the 

diabetic rats. Insulin replacement to the diabetic rats significantly increased 

the contribution of DNL to the hepatic TG pool. The observation that the 

hepatic TG content was similar between the untreated and insulin-treated 

diabetic rats implies that the contribution of unlabeled dietary and/or 

lipolytic sources decreased with insulin treatment. Despite the enhancement 

of lipogenic TG synthesis, insulin replacement to diabetic rats did not 

translate into a complete restoration of the TG dynamics in the liver.

5.3.3.1 Enzymes involved in glucose metabolism 

The relative mRNA levels of GK were significantly reduced in the 

STZ-diabetic animals but in both insulin-treated groups (I-SC and I-IP) the 

GK expression was similar to control levels. However, expression of the GK 

gene in the I-SC and I-IP groups was only modestly increased and thus was 

not significantly different from that of untreated diabetics. While the 

expression of the GK gene in the liver was not completely recovered with 

the insulin treatments, GK activity on the other hand, increased significantly 

to levels similar to controls (Table 18). PFK gene expression was similar 

among all study groups and its activity was similar for groups D, I-SC and 

I-IP. Moreover, in all the latter cases PFK activity was significantly lower 

than that measured for group C. The expression of the PK gene was 

significantly reduced in the STZ-diabetic animals but was completely 



Metabolic effects of insulin replacement in ad libitum fed diabetic rats |107 

recovered to control levels in the I-SC and I-IP groups. Accordingly, the PK 

activity was significantly reduced in group D, relative to controls. Both 

insulin treatments resulted in significantly higher PK activities when 

comparing to diabetics, with the PK activity in the I-SC group being 

significantly higher than the one measured for I-IP, but these were however 

still significantly less than activities of controls. 

The hepatic gene expression of G6PDH was similar among all study 

groups. On the other hand, the activities of both G6PDH and 6PGDH were 

altered with diabetes and insulin replacement. In group D, both 

dehydrogenases’ activities were reduced when comparing to controls. 

Insulin replacement by both s.c. and i.p. routes resulted in a significant 

increase of G6PDH and 6PGDH activities, but these were still well below 

control levels.  

Considering the gluconeogenic enzymes in the untreated diabetic 

animals, PEPCK and FBPase gene expression was increased, while the 

expression of G6Pase remained similar to that of non-diabetic controls. 

Insulin treatment did not translate into a reduction on the expression of 

gluconeogenic enzymes. Instead, in the I-SC and I-IP groups, the expression 

of PEPCK, FBPase and G6Pase was similar to that determined for untreated 

diabetic rats.  

 

5.3.3.2 Enzymes involved in lipid metabolism 

The gene expression of CL was reduced in group D and recovered to 

control levels in I-SC and I-IP. This behaviour was also observed for the 

expression of the FAS gene. On the other hand, the ACC1 gene expression 

was similar between diabetics and controls. Insulin treatment resulted in a 

significant increase on the expression of the ACC1 gene in the I-IP group. In 

the I-SC group the ACC1 gene expression was similar to I-IP but not 

statistically different from groups D and C.

The gene expression of CPT1a, the protein that transports fatty acids 

from the cytosol to the mitochondria for ?-oxidation was increased in group 

D relative to controls (p &amp;lt;0.05, unpaired t test). This observation, together 

with the reduced expression of the lipogenic genes CL and FAS suggests 

that the STZ-diabetic animals are experiencing a catabolic state, 

characterized by the oxidation of fatty acids by opposition to their synthesis 

via the lipogenic route. Furthermore, these data are in accordance with the 

upregulation of the gluconeogenic pathway, as determined by the elevated 

PEPCK and FBPase gene expression. In contrast to what was observed for

the regulation of the lipogenic genes expression, the expression of the 

CPT1a transporter did no approach control values with insulin treatment. 

Instead, CPT1a gene expression in the I-SC and I-IP groups was similar to 

that observed for diabetics. 

 

5.3.3.3 Transcription factors 

SREBP1c and ChREBP are two transcription factors involved in 

carbohydrate and lipid metabolism responding to insulin and glucose, 

respectively. While the mRNA levels for ChREBP were similar among all 

study groups, the ones for SREBP1c were significantly reduced in group D: 

With either insulin treatment, SREBP1c gene expression was restored to 

control levels but the observed levels were still not significantly different 

from those of group D. The induction of SREBP1c by insulin is in good 

agreement with the increased expression of the glycolytic and lipogenic 

enzymes in the insulin-treated diabetic rats. 

 

5.4 Discussion 

Chapter 4 established a 2H2O-based protocol for the study of the 

absorptive state. Those experiments pointed out the metabolic disruptions that 

take place with the induction of diabetes by STZ injection in regards to glucose 

production, hepatic glycogen and lipid synthesis. The study described in this 

chapter recapitulated those alterations and assessed the effect of insulin 

replacement on those pathways in two groups of rats receiving treatment for 9 

or 10 days to the i.p. or s.c. route. In addition, modifications on the gene 

expression and activities of several key enzymes were evaluated. Hence, these 

experiments allowed for a comprehensive study of hepatic metabolism by 

measuring the overall metabolic performance with the tracer-based approach 

and disclosing some regulatory aspects of hepatic glucose and lipid 

metabolism by gene expression and enzymology techniques. With these 



110|Chapter 5 
 

methods it was possible to identify the benefits and limitations of the insulin 

replacement protocol adopted. 

 

5.4.1 Alterations underlying the dominance of gluconeogenesis 

in STZ-diabetic rats 

In STZ-diabetic rats, both EGP and glycogen synthesis were dominated 

by the gluconeogenic flux. This was determined by the analysis of plasma 

glucose and hepatic glycogen 2H enrichment profile from 2H2O and confirmed 

by the increased expression of hepatic PEPCK and FBPase. The expression of 

G6Pase, although higher in the case of STZ-diabetic rats, was not statistically 

different from control levels. However, other authors (Hidaka et al. 2002) 

report that, in addition to PEPCK, G6Pase mRNA levels are increased in fed 

STZ-diabetic rats in a similar stage of the disease, relative to non-diabetic 

controls. The finding that in the present experimental setting, PEPCK gene 

expression was highly sensitive to insulinopenic STZ-diabetes (mRNA levels 

in diabetics were 7× higher than in controls) is consistent with the idea that 

insulin has a dominant action on the transcriptional regulation of PEPCK gene 

(Scott et al. 2003; Yabaluri et al. 2010).  

Gluconeogenesis from pyruvate is an energy-expensive pathway that 

is dependent on ATP and NADH. These can be derived from the ?-oxidation 

of fatty acids in mitochondria. High rates of hepatic ?-oxidation are supported 

by the increased expression of the CPT1a transporter and also by the increased 

availability of NEFA as a result of insulin deficiency in the STZ-diabetic rats.  

 

5.4.2 Alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism in STZ-diabetic 

rats 

Insulin deficiency impaired lipid uptake into adipose tissue in the 

STZ-diabetic rats as demonstrated by the reduced EWAT content and the 

elevated plasma TG levels. As a result, TGs not cleared by the adipocytes 



Metabolic effects of insulin replacement in ad libitum fed diabetic rats |111 

accumulated in the liver. The prevalence of hepatic TGs as a consequence of 

abnormal lipid metabolism by the adipose tissue rather than of hepatic de 

novo production was further demonstrated by the down regulation of the 

lipogenic enzymes (CL and FAS) and, consistently, the residual contribution 

of DNL to the hepatic TG pool as estimated by the 2H2O method. In this 

setting, it was anticipated that the NEFA flux from adipose tissue lipolysis 

would be increased, in agreement with the reduced levels of circulating 

insulin. The similar plasma NEFA concentration between diabetics and 

controls may be explained by the highly depleted TG stores in the adipose 

tissue. In accord with this, the EWAT content of diabetic rats represented 

only ~0.3% of the animals’ body weight, compared to the 0.6-1.2% range 

reported for non-diabetic controls (DiGirolamo et al. 1998; Wren et al. 2001; 

Takada et al. 2008).  

 

5.4.3 Metabolic control and limitations of the insulin 

replacement therapy 

Several biochemical and physiological parameters were improved by 

the insulin replacement protocols. For example, there was an increase in the 

animals’ body weight, in similar fashion to what was observed by other 

authors for STZ diabetic rats under a similar twice-daily insulin 

administration protocol (Suthagar et al. 2009) or under continuous insulin 

delivery by the use of infusion pumps (Wan et al. 2000). Likewise the 

deposition of fat in adipose tissue was increased as demonstrated by the 

higher content of EWAT. Moreover, the insulin-treated diabetic rats showed 

an alleviation of the symptoms associated with the disease, such as the 

hyperphagia and polydepsia. 

However, the metabolic evaluation by both the 2H2O tracer approach 

and gene expression and enzyme activities analyses suggests that the insulin 

treatment was in many aspects unable to revert the performance of diabetic 

animals back to that of controls. Insulin was administered as a rapid-acting 

formulation in two equal doses, one at the beginning of the dark phase (7 pm) 



112|Chapter 5 
 

and the other at the beginning of the light phase (8 am). Prior to the 

administration of the morning insulin dose, glycemia was similar to that of 

untreated diabetic rats, in the hyperglycemic range. This indicates that the 

twice-daily insulin injection posology failed to afford normoglycemia 

throughout the complete day course. Under these circumstances, insulin 

action is no longer observed at the beginning of the light phase, in agreement 

with increased gluconeogenesis, fatty oxidation in the liver, and adipose tissue 

lipolysis as discussed below. 

Insulin replacement was able to normalize the relative contributions of 

gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to EGP. This finding is in line with 

reports from studies on controlled type 1 diabetic patients (Bischof et al. 2002). 

However, in the present experiment, the absolute fluxes of glycogenolysis and 

gluconeogenesis must remain elevated even after the treatment of the diabetic 

rats, accounting for the hyperglycemia observed in the morning. The gene 

expression analysis showed that, after an overnight feeding, the gluconeogenic 

enzymes were upregulated, supporting the increased absolute flux of 

gluconeogenesis in the insulin-treated diabetic rats.  

Despite the abnormalities in EGP the glycogenic and lipogenic 

pathways responded efficiently to insulin replacement in the diabetic rats, 

even in face of the incomplete insulinization throughout the day course. The 

restoration of GK gene expression and activity to control levels correlates very 

well with the increase in glycogen content in the liver. This effect is in 

accordance with the enhancement of glycogen synthesis in hepatocytes 

(O'Doherty et al. 1996; Seoane et al. 1999) and diabetic rats (Morral et al. 2004) 

overexpressing GK. In addition, in the diabetic rats, there was a complete 

recovery of the direct pathway flux with both insulin replacement protocols, 

contrarily to the observations for human type 1 diabetic patients that 

underwent intensive long-term insulin therapy where the fraction of glycogen 

synthesized by the indirect pathway remained dominant (Bischof et al. 2002). 

The stimulation of GK gene expression and activities parallel to those 

of PK and to the gene expression of several lipogenic enzymes, supports the 

coupling of glycolytic and DNL fluxes. With insulin treatment, the mRNA 



Metabolic effects of insulin replacement in ad libitum fed diabetic rats |113 

levels of CL, ACC and FAS were increased to control levels or even higher (in 

the case of ACC). The increased gene expression of lipogenic enzymes in 

insulin-treated diabetic rats is in good agreement with the enhancement of 

DNL determined by 2H NMR methods and also with the stimulation of the 

dehydrogenases activities in the pentose phosphate pathway that generate 

NAPDH molecules for DNL.  

Nonetheless, DNL was not completely restored to control levels. In 

part, this was due to an important contribution from adipose tissue lipolysis to 

the hepatic TG pool, consistent with the elevated levels of circulating NEFA in 

the STZ-rats undergoing insulin replacement therapy. With both increased 

contribution from de novo production and adipose tissue lipolysis it was 

surprising that the hepatic TG content did not increase relative to the 

untreated diabetic rats. This finding can only be explained by concurrent 

lipogenesis and ?-oxidation, which is actually supported by CPT1a expression 

levels in the range found for untreated diabetic rats and lower than those of 

controls. Evidence demonstrating the loss of reciprocal regulation between 

DNL and ?-oxidation has been reported in hepatocytes overexpressing wild 

type and malonyl-CoA-insensitive (at a greater extent) CPT1a, even under 

feeding-like conditions of high insulin and high glucose (Akkaoui et al. 2009). 

Moreover the sensitivity of CPT1a to malonyl-CoA is decreased in diabetic 

rats and is only modestly reverted by acute administration of high insulin 

doses (Grantham et al. 1988). The present study provides additional evidence 

that lipogenesis and ?-oxidation may occur simultaneously and furthermore 

insulin replacement may promote the cycling of lipids between those two 

pathways in the diabetic rats. 

 

5.4.4 Relevance of the intraperitoneal route 

Under physiological conditions, the liver receives insulin and nutrients 

by the portal vein during the absorptive phase. In these studies, the i.p. route 

was chosen as a strategy to target insulin to the liver and the absorptive phase 

was addressed after the insulin replacement period. It was anticipated that the 



114|Chapter 5 
 

hepatic metabolic pathways would respond differently to the i.p. and s.c. 

routes of insulin administration. However, most of the effects observed in the 

fed state were independent of the route of administration. The only apparent 

difference was that when insulin was delivered to the i.p. route hepatic 

glycogen synthesis was further enhanced relative to the s.c. route. However, 

this observation was not supported by differently altered gene expression or 

enzyme activity of GK, which exerts high positive control over glycogen 

synthesis (Ferrer et al. 2003). It is possible that the lag phase between the last 

insulin injection and liver harvesting time prevented route-related effects to be 

noticed at the level of enzyme regulation. With continuous insulin diffusion 

pumps, the i.p. route resulted in increased stimulation of GK activity relative 

do s.c. and even non-diabetic controls (Mason et al. 2000). Interestingly, 

another study from the same group reports the activity of lipogenic enzymes 

is enhanced to the same extent by both routes (Mason et al. 2002). Hence, at 

least in the in the absorptive state, portal insulin is more relevant in the 

normalization of glycogen synthesis, probably via GK regulation.  

 

5.5 Conclusions 

Delivering insulin in two daily doses to either the s.c. or i.p. route was 

beneficial to the overall condition of STZ-diabetic rats. Glycolytic and 

lipogenic fluxes in the liver were highly responsive to the treatment but 

gluconeogenesis and lipid degradation could not be normalized, probably as a 

consequence of the insufficient insulinization throughout the whole day. 

Preferential hepatic action could not be clearly demonstrated for the i.p. route 

except for the higher glycogen content in the liver that, nonetheless, was not 

accompanied by other differential improvements.

POLYMERIC NANOPARTICLES FOR INSULIN DELIVERY 

6.1 Introduction 

An important issue regarding the current insulin therapy is that its 

delivery by the s.c. route fails to recapitulate the hormone’s physiological 

release profile, since the portal to peripheral gradient is unmet under those 

circumstances. Oral insulin delivery would mimic the normal secretion of 

insulin because the drug would be largely absorbed to the portal vein. 

However, because of its peptide nature, oral insulin administration is 

hampered. Poor absorption and high enzymatic degradation of peptide and 

protein agents are the main barriers compromising their efficacy by the oral 

route (Pauletti et al. 1996; Uekama et al. 1998; Pinto Reis et al. 2006). Even 

after reaching circulation, these drugs are rapidly cleared from the blood, 

and their presence may also lead to immunological complications (Uekama 

et al. 1998). In this context, nanoparticles arise as specialized delivery 

systems being developed by several research groups with encouraging 



116|Chapter 6 

results in regards to enhancing the oral efficacy of peptide drugs (e.g. 

Allémann et al. 1998; Bilati et al. 2005a; Pinto Reis et al. 2006).  

Nanoparticles are colloidal carriers ranging in size from 10 to 1000 

nm. They are used in drug formulation for facilitating the passage of drugs 

through the biological membranes, protecting drugs against degradation, 

controlling drug release and targeting to specific sites of action. Once in the 

body, nanoparticles are recognized as strange entities, undergo opsonisation 

(coating with opsonin protein) that flags them to phagocyte cells and are 

eventually delivered to organs of the reticuloendothelial system. Unloaded 

biodegradable nanoparticles are mainly taken up by the liver (42 to 80% of 

the administered dose), spleen (0,6 to 2%), lungs (0,7 to 3%) and to a less 

extent by the bone narrow (Allémann et al. 1993). This extensive uptake is 

advantageous when the therapeutic agent is intended to act on those organs 

and can thus be used as means of passive targeting drugs to the liver, for 

example.  

Concerning the above mentioned, a hypothesis can be set that 

physiological/portal delivery of insulin may be achieved by the 

nanoparticle strategy if: (i) the drug is successfully absorbed by the oral 

route; (ii) or passive liver targeting occurs even under the traditional s.c. 

administration. To test this hypothesis, nanoparticles with high insulin 

association were prepared from biodegradable and biocompatible materials 

and assayed for efficacy against the administration of free insulin. In the 

following paragraphs, some methodological considerations regarding the 

materials chosen to develop the nanoparticles are addressed. 

From the wide variety of polymers available for preparing 

nanoparticles, poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) has the advantage of being 

biodegradable.  

Among the various methods available for preparing nanoparticles, 

the nanoprecipitation technique employs mild conditions and is the most 

simple and straightforward. In this procedure a polymer is dissolved in an 

organic medium (typically acetone) and, upon contact of this solution with a 

non-solvent phase (typically water), the polymer immediately suffers 



Nanoparticles for insulin delivery|117 

desolvation resulting in the formation of nanoparticles. In a second step the 

organic solvent is removed by evaporation and the nanoparticles are 

obtained as an aqueous colloidal suspension. The most common way to 

associate drugs to nanoparticles prepared by this methodology is to add the 

drug along with the polymer to the organic solvent. While this is a good 

procedure for hydrophobic molecules, it is not very suited for the 

formulation of hydrophilic compounds, such as insulin. Nonetheless, 

nanoprecipitation has been successfully used to prepare insulin-loaded 

PLGA nanoparticles by dissolving the drug in hydrochloride acid and then 

adding that solution to the polymer-containing acetonic phase (Barichello et 

al. 1999a, 1999b; Cui et al. 2007). Alternatively, Bilati et al using a modified 

nanoprecipitation method have obtained insulin-loaded PLGA 

nanoparticles by dissolving the drug and the polymer in DMSO or N-

methylpyrrolidone (Bilati et al. 2005b). In the authors’ method, the 

nanoparticles are recovered after centrifugation and successive washes with 

distilled water. 

Cyclodextrins (CD) are cyclic oligosaccharides consisting of several 

D-glucopyranose units linked to each other by ?-1,4 bonds (Figure 25A). 

Natural occurring CDs are obtained from the enzymatic breakdown of 

starch by bacterial amylase cyclodextrin-glucosyl-tranferase and the most 

abundant are ?-, ?- and ?-CD, consisting of 6, 7 and 8 glucopyranose 

residues respectively. Cyclodextrins assume a cone shaped form (Figure 

25B) with the polar hydroxyl groups facing the outside, primary hydroxyl 

residues linked to C6 are in the narrowest face while secondary ones linked 

to C2 and C3 are localized on the wider face. These hydroxyl groups can 

suffer chemical modifications and be conjugated with other functional 

groups to alter the physicochemical properties of parent CD. Hence, CD and 

their derivatives cover a wide range of pharmaceutical applications and 

have been largely used in drug delivery as adjuvant to improve drug 

solubility, stability, and bioavailability (Loftsson et al. 2007).

About twenty years ago, new CD derivatives with amphiphilic 

character were synthesized by Zhang and co-workers (Zhang et al. 1991). 

Similar to polymers, these molecules are able to self-assemble into 

nanoparticles by the nanoprecipitation technique. This new amphiphile 

class of CD has extended the pharmaceutical potential of CD to the domain 

of the nanocarrier systems. Several chains can be grafted to the CD parent 

molecule at different positions (Duchêne et al. 1999), and recently, the 

thermolysin catalyzed transesterification of CD with vinyl esters allowed 

the synthetic procedure to be simplified to a quantitative one-step reaction 

(Pedersen et al. 2005; Choisnard et al. 2006).  

This chapter describes the preparation of insulin-loaded 

nanoparticles from PLGA and amphiphilic CD. The aim was to develop a 

new nanoparticle-based carrier for oral and/or s.c. administration of insulin 

that would translate in benefits with respect to the pharmacological 

response. From the most common ?- ?- and ?-CD, the latter is the less toxic 

(Loftsson et al. 2007) and was hence chosen to prepare an amphiphilic 

derivative to be included in the nanoparticle formulation. The amphiphilic 

CD consisted of a ?-CD backbone grafted with C10 chains from vinyl 

decanoate and was synthesized by enzyme catalysis. Insulin was not added 

to the polymer/amphipilic CD-containing solvent but rather to the non-

solvent aqueous phase. Still, good association of insulin to the nanoparticles 

could be observed. The relevance of the nanosystem for insulin delivery in 

vivo, was studied in several experimental settings that aimed to evaluate the 

hypoglycemic response upon oral and s.c. administration to non-diabetic

6.2.1 Synthesis and characterization of amphiphilic 

cyclodextrins 

Parent ?-CD (Roquette, France) was grafted C10 alkyl chains by a 

thermolysin-based catalysis as previously described (Choisnard et al. 2006). 

Briefly, ~1 g of ?-CD dissolved in 7.5 mL of DMSO plus 2.3 mL of vinyl 

decanoate (99%; TCI Europe nv, Interchim, France), were let to react at 45 ºC 

for 8 days in the presence of 1 g of thermolysin (Sigma Aldrich, France) 

previously immobilized in celite. At the end of the reaction, the celite-

thermolysin deposit was eliminated by centrifugation and cyclodextrin 

esters in the supernatant were precipitated by adding 20 mL of 35% (v/v) 

methanol in water. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, the 

product solubilized in tetrahydrofuran and further purified by successive 

acetonitrile precipitation, filtration and re-solubilization in tetrahydrofuran. 

This procedure was repeated three times. Finally the ?-CD capric esters (?-

CDC10) were dissolved in acetone and recovered as a white powder after 

drying under vacuum. MALDI-MS: m/z = 2399.11 (relative intensity, 33%; 

decanoate ?-CD ester with 7 chains + Na+); m/z = 2553,31 (relative intensity, 

100%; decanoate ?-CD ester with 8 chains + Na+); m/z = 2707.48 (relative 

intensity, 54%; decanoate ?-CD ester with 9 chains + Na+); m/z = 2861.66 

(relative intensity, 15%; decanoate ?-CD ester with 10 chains + Na+). 1H

further characterized by heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence 

(HMQC) spectroscopy. 

 

6.2.2 Preparation of nanoparticles suspensions 

Nanoparticles were prepared by nanoprecipitation followed by 

solvent evaporation (Fessi et al. 1992). Typically, 5 mL of acetone containing 

the nanoparticle-forming material was poured over 6.5 mL of a polysorbate 

80 (Montanox® 80, Seppic, France) aqueous solution (0.015% m/v) under 

magnetic stirring, in a closed system thermostatized at 25 ºC. Nanoparticles 

were spontaneously formed, the organic solvent and part of the water were 

removed by evaporation under vacuum and particles were recovered as an 

aqueous colloidal suspension (approximately 5 mL). To prepare insulin-

loaded nanoparticles, 300 µL of an insulin commercial preparation 

(Actrapid®, Novo Nordisk, France) equivalent to 30 U of insulin were 

added to the aqueous phase prior nanoprecipitation to prevent possible 

denaturation resulting from contact with acetone. The organic solutions 

consisted of: (i) 5 mg of PLGA with a lactide-glycolide ratio of 50:50 

(Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany) per mL of acetone; (ii) 1 mg of ?-CDC10 

synthesized as previously described per mL of acetone; (iii) a mixture 

consisting of 5 mg PLGA plus 1 mg of ?-CDC10 per mL of acetone. To 

prepared coated nanoparticles, ethyl acrilate-methacrilic acid copolymer 

(Eudragit® L30D-55 30% aqueous dispersion, Evonik Röhm GmbH, 

Germany) was dissolved in acetone to prepare a 40 mg/mL mother solution 

and 1 mL of this solution was added to the nanoparticle suspension after the 

addition of the organic phase (iii) to the aqueous phase and prior to the 

evaporation of the solvents.

6.2.3 Nanoparticles characterization 

Particle size was determined in triplicate by quasi-elastic light 

scattering (QELS) using a Zetasizer 3000 instrument (10 mW HeNe laser at 

632.8 nm, K7132 correlator, Malvern). Nanosphere samples were diluted in 

distilled water in order to obtained adequate kcount readings for size 

measurements. The analyses took place at 25 ºC, at a reference angle of 90°, 

viscosity of 0.899x10-3 Pa.s, refractive index of 1.330. The polydispersity 

index (PI), which is a dimensionless measure of the broadness of the size 

distribution, and Z-average mean hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) of the 

particles were calculated using a cumulant algorithm with Zetasizer 3000 

software version V. 1.51. Dh was derived from the measured translational 

diffusion coefficient of the particles moving under Brownian motion.  

Morphology of the particles was address by transmission electron 

microscopy (TEM). 

 

6.2.4 Insulin quantification 

Insulin was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography 

(HPLC) with a method adapted from Sarmento et al. (Sarmento et al. 2006) 

as described. The samples were centrifuged at 17,000 rcf for 30 minutes at 20 

ºC. The supernatants were diluted in HCl 0.01 M to a final volume of 2 mL 

and filtered through 0.22 µm polyvinylidene fluoride filters6 prior to HPLC 

analysis. The chromatographic equipment consisted of a Prostar 230 ternary 

solvent delivery module (Agilent, USA) equipped with a reverse phase X-

Terra C-18 column, 5 µm, 4.6 mm × 250 mm (Waters, France) and a 

Interchrom C-18, 5 µm precolumn (Interchim, France) maintained at 31 ºC. 

A Prostar autosampler 400 (Agilent, USA) fitted a 50 µL loop was used for 

injections. Mobile phase A consisted of tri-distilled water with 0.1% 

                                                      
6 These filters were chosen because they display low protein retention by adsorption. Since 
standard insulin solutions used in the preparation of the calibration curve were also 
subjected to the same centrifugation-filtration procedure, any eventual insulin loss during 
the process is accounted for.

trifluoroacetic acid and mobile phase B of acetonitrile with 0.1% 

trifluoroacetic acid. Each analysis was performed over 18 minutes with a 

flow rate of 1 mL/minute, a linear gradient from 70:30 (A:B) to 60:40 (A:B) 

was applied in the first five minutes, the 60:40 (A:B) was maintained for 

another 8 minutes; system returned to the initial conditions in the final 5 

minutes. Insulin was detected at 210 nm with a Varian 9050 variable 

wavelength UV/Vis detector (Agilent, USA) and peak area integrated with 

Star Chromatography Workstation version 5.52 software. A typical 

chromatogram is depicted in Figure 26 and a calibration curve for insulin 

was set to determine insulin concentration in the supernatant (Figure 27).

dilution of Actrapid® in HCl 0.01 M. The peaks were detected at 270 nm and 
correspond to insulin and cresol (included in the commercial preparation) as 
indicated.  

 

Standard solutions were prepared by dilution of the insulin 

commercial formulation in HCl 0.01 M. Insulin Association Efficacy (AE) 

was calculated indirectly as a difference of the amount found in the 

supernatant from the theoretical amount initially added as shown in 

Equation 15. This method was also used to determine the %AE after

A batch of nanoparticles from the PLGA-?-CDC10 blend displaying 

93% AE was used to determine the amount of insulin that could be 

recovered from the formulations. A 200 µL aliquot was diluted 1/20 in HCl 

0.05 M, then 2 mL of this suspension was treated as described for the 

supernatant HPLC analysis and 95% of the theoretical amount of insulin 

added to the formulation could be recovered at the end of the procedure.

6.2.6 Animal procedures 

6.2.6.1 Animal housing 

As described in section 2.2.1.1. 

 

6.2.6.2 Study I. Non-diabetic controls, s.c. route 

Non-diabetic control rats (245 ± 9 g) were fasted overnight prior to 

the experiments and randomized into six groups (N = 5 per group) 

receiving the following treatments: CTRL, no treatment; ACTR, s.c. injection 

of Actrapid® solution in polysorbate 80 (0.015% m/v); PL-I, s.c. injection of 

insulin-loaded nanoparticles from PLGA; PL, s.c. injection of nanoparticles 

from PLGA; CDPL-I, s.c. injection of insulin-loaded nanoparticles from the 

PLGA-?-CDC10 blend; CDPL, s.c. injection of nanoparticles from the PLGA-

?-CDC10 blend. The formulations were administered at an insulin dose of 2.3 

U/kg or equivalent volume of placebo. Glycemia was monitored from the 

tail vein with a glucometer (Accu Check Performa, Roche Diagnostics, 

France) before treatment and henceforward at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours. 

Animals were allowed one week of recovery from this experiment and re-

randomized into groups for the next study. 

 

6.2.6.3 Study II. Non-diabetic controls, oral route 

In this assay animals were fasted overnight and assigned to the 

following groups: CTRL, oral gavage of tap water (N = 6); ACTR, oral 

gavage of Actrapid® solution in polysorbate 80 (0.015% m/v) (N = 8); 

PLCD, oral gavage of nanoparticles from the PLGA-?-CDC10 blend (N = 8); 



Nanoparticles for insulin delivery|125 

PLCD-I, oral gavage of insulin-loaded nanoparticles from the PLGA-?-

CDC10 blend (N = 8). The formulations were administered at an insulin 

dosage of 100 U/kg or equivalent volume of placebo. Glycemia was 

monitored as described in study I, section 6.2.6.2 before treatment and 

henceforward at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 24 hours.  

After reformulation experiments, this assay was applied to a 

separate group of animals (275 ± 3 g) to assess the efficacy of the Eudragit®-

coated nanoparticles. In this case, after an overnight fast, animals received 

an oral dose (100 U/kg) of insulin-loaded Eudragit®-coated nanoparticles 

from the PLGA-?-CDC10 blend (NPL30D-I, N = 8) or alternatively an 

equivalent volume of placebo Eudragit®-coated nanoparticles from the 

PLGA-?-CDC10 blend (NPL30D, N = 8). 

 

6.2.6.4 Study III. STZ-diabetic rats, s.c. route 

Diabetes was induced in a separate group of rats by STZ injection as 

described in section 3.2.1.2. Fifteen days after diabetes induction by STZ 

injection, animals (226 ± 6 g) were fasted overnight and randomized in two 

groups. One group (ACTR, N = 4) received an s.c. injection of an Actrapid® 

solution in polysorbate 80 (0.015% m/v) and the other (CDPL-I, N = 5) was 

injected insulin-loaded nanoparticles from the PLGA-?-CDC10 blend. The 

insulin formulations were administered at a dose of 2.3 U/kg and glycemia 

monitored as described in study I, section 6.2.6.2. 

 

6.2.6.5 Study IV. STZ diabetic rats, OGTT 

Diabetes was induced in a separate group of rats by STZ injection as 

described in section 3.2.1.2. Twenty days after the induction of diabetes, 

animals (190 ± 7 g) were fasted for 24 hours and randomized in three 

groups. In two of the groups, rats were injected with insulin formulations 30 

minutes before the OGTT while another group was not given any injection, 

STZ (N = 5). Insulin was administered at a dose of 5 U/kg as a solution of 



126|Chapter 6 

Actrapid® in polysorbate 80 (0.015% m/v), ACTR (N = 4) or as a suspension 

of insulin-loaded nanoparticles from PLGA-?-CDC10 blend, CDPL-I (N = 4). 

The glucose load was prepared at a dose of 2 g/kg and glycemia was 

monitored over a 3-hour period as described in chapter 2.  

 

6.2.7 Statistics 

As described in section 2.2.6. A two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni 

post tests was used to analyze glycemia profiles. The area above the curve 

(AAC) was calculated by setting a cutoff at 100%.  

 

6.3 Results  

6.3.1 Synthesis of amphiphilic cyclodextrin 

Cyclodextrin esters were obtained by enzymatic synthesis as a 

mixture of over- and under-acylated species with the substitution degree 

ranging from 7 to 10 acylations (m/z, 2399.11–2861.66). The signals in the 

MALDI-MS analysis were separated by 154 mass units, corresponding to 

the molecular mass of the decanoate chain. The most abundant species in 

the mixture was acylated with 8 C10 chains. This profile may represent one 

or more acylations per glucopyranose unit that composes the CD. The 

presence of species with 9 and 10 acylations indicates some glucopyranose 

units were acylated in at least three carbons. Acylation can occur via the 

primary C6 hydroxyl or the secondary C2 and C3 hydroxyls. Enzymatic 

catalysis is reported to lead mainly to acylation in C2 however, the grafting 

of other positions is not to be excluded (Pedersen et al. 2005; Choisnard et al. 

2006). The NMR analyses of the ?-CDC10 product (Figure 28 and Figure 29) 

further clarified the substitution profiles in the mixture, namely in what 

concerns the positions that were attacked during the transesterification 

reaction.

128|Chapter 6 

The H6/C6 correlaction in the HMQC spectrum of the the ?-CDC10 

ester mixture was similar to the one observed for the parent ?-CD. Hence, 

substitution in position 6 is unlikely to have occurred. The most significant 

shift from the parent ?-CD was observed for the H2 resonance, which 

moved downfield from 3.30 to 4.42 ppm, translating in an altered H2/C2 

correlation. This downfield shift is consistent with a strong deshielding 

effect due the ester function in the C2 position. All the other positions 

experienced a modest downfield shift in 1H, which indicates the presence of 

an additional electronegative environment in the vicinity of H3, H4 and H5 

and is consistent with the C2 acylation. Nonetheless, the presence of species 

with 9 and 10 acylations implies that C3 was also acylated at least to some 

extent. The presence of an extra correlation peak at 4.59/70.43 ppm supports 

the presence of species acylated in C3, with the H3 moving downfield from 

3.59 ppm in the parent ?-CD and from 3.78 ppm in the C2 acylated species.

Nanoparticles for insulin delivery|129 

The proposed structure is depicted in Figure 30. This product showed self-

assembly properties compatible with the formation of nanoparticles as 

presented in section 6.3.2. 

 

6.3.2 Nanoparticle preparation and characterization 

Nanoparticles were prepared by the solvent displacement 

procedure. The nanoparticle-forming material was dissolved in acetone and 

upon contact of this organic solution with the aqueous phase nanoparticles 

immediately assembled as a consequence of the desolvation process. This 

observation was verified for all three organic solutions: PLGA (5 mg/mL), 

?-CDC10 (1 mg/mL) and the PLGA-?-CDC10 (5:1 mg/mL) blend. Size 

measurements by QELS (Table 19) confirmed the presence of monodisperse 

particle size distributions in the nano range. Despite the differences on the 

composition of the organic phase, all the uncoated formulations rendered 

nanoparticles of similar sizes. The average mean diameter ranged from 112 

to 126 nm. Moreover, these observations indicate that PLGA and ?-CDC10 

co-nanoprecipitated in formulation from the PLGA-?-CDC10 blend and this 

was further confirmed by TEM photographs (Figure 31) that show spherical 

particles in good agreement with the size measurements by QELS. 

As described in section 6.2.2, insulin-loaded nanoparticles were 

prepared by adding a commercially available insulin formulation 

(Actrapid®) to the system. This formulation consists of an aqueous neutral 

solution of insulin and because its contact with acetone resulted in 

immediate turbidity observed by the naked eye, suggesting the integrity of 

the protein to be compromised, Actrapid® was added to the aqueous phase. 

When the nanoparticles were prepared from ?-CDC10 alone, ~80% of the 

insulin added to the system could be recovered in the aqueous supernatant 

after centrifugation, with less than 20% remaining associated to the particles 

(Table 19). On the other hand, excellent association efficacy (~90%) was 

observed for the PLGA formulation, which was maintained for the PLGA-?-

CDC10 blend (Table 19).

Nanoparticles for insulin delivery|131 

When Eudragit® was added to the preformed nanoparticles there 

was a slight increase in particle size but the monodispersity of the 

population distribution was maintained, supporting the efficient coating of 

the nanoparticles. Moreover, coating seemed to strengthen the interactions 

between insulin and the nanoparticles since the %AE was virtually 100 as a 

result of no insulin being detect in the supernatants after centrifugation of 

the suspensions. 

 

6.3.3 Dilution and release assays 

When the uncoated nanoparticle suspensions were diluted in water, 

the %AE was maintained relative to that initially determined (Figure 32). 

This indicated that the interaction between insulin and the carrier was not 

disrupted upon simple dilution. These results, together with the particle 

size measurements and %AE determinations before dilution suggest that 

both formulations from PLGA and the PLGA-?-CDC10 blend have similar 

characteristics in regards to the interaction with insulin.

With the oral route of administration in mind, studies were 

performed to investigate the release profile of insulin in acidic medium as 

an indication for the possible resistance of the system during the GIT transit. 

As depicted in Figure 33, the coating with Eudragit® improved association 

of insulin to the nanoparticles after HCl treatment. This effect was expected 

since Eudragit® L30D55 is resistant to acid environment, dissolving at a pH 

value superior to 5.5. 

 

 
 
Figure 33 Release studies in HCl 0.1 M, pH 1.2 performed at 37 ºC. Coated (NPL30D-I) and 

uncoated (CDPL-I) insulin-loaded nanoparticles from the PLGA-?-CDC10 blend 
were diluted 1/4 in HCl and insulin released to the medium quantified by HPLC. 

 

6.3.4 Biological activity of the nanoparticle formulations 

Insulin not associated to the particles remains in the aqueous phase 

of the suspensions. Thus, when determining the dosage for administration it 

was taken into consideration the total (free plus nanoparticle-associated) 

amount of insulin present in the suspensions. Since only a residual amount 

of insulin was found in the supernatant fraction of the suspensions, most of 

it being associated to the particles, the in vivo effect of the formulations is 

assumed to be mostly due to the nanoparticle-associated insulin.

6.3.4.1 Subcutaneous administration to non-diabetic rats 

After the overnight fasting period, the glycemia observed for the 

animals was 88 ± 2 mg/dL. Figure 34 shows the glycemia profiles 

(expressed as percent from the initial value) for all experimental groups 

following the injection of insulin or placebo formulations.  

 

 
 
Figure 34 Glycemia profiles for non-diabetic rats after an overnight fasting. Insulin and 

placebo formulations were administered by the subcutaneous route at time t = 0 
hours at a dose of 5 U/kg or equivalent volume. CTRL, control rats not 
administered with any formulation; PL, rats administered sham nanoparticles 
from PLGA; CDPL, rats administered sham nanoparticles from the PLGA-?-
CDC10 blend; ACTR, rats administered the commercial insulin formulation 
Actrapid®; PL-I, rats administered insulin-loaded nanoparticles form PLGA; 
CDPL-I, rats administered insulin-loaded nanoparticles from the PLGA-?-CDC10 
blend. See text for statistical differences. 

 

Animals that were injected with placebo formulations (PL and CDPL 

groups) presented glycemia profiles similar to controls, maintaining the 

initial blood glucose levels throughout the experimental period with a slight 

initial increment attributed to manipulation-induced stress. This 

observation demonstrates that the formulations per se don’t elicit 

hypoglycemic response. Also the AAC, which is a measure of the overall 

hypoglycemic effect, was similar for controls and placebo (35 ± 21, CTRL; 86

± 17, PL; and 51 ± 16, CDPL), further supporting the lack of pharmacological 

effect of the sham nanoparticles. On the other hand, when insulin 

formulations were administered to the animals, the hypoglycemic effect was 

immediate, overcoming the initial stress-induced raise in glycemia, 

although statistically significant differences were only attained from 0.5 

hours onward. The AAC for all the insulin formulations were significantly 

higher than controls and placebo formulations, as expected. 

When animals were injected with the standard insulin formulation 

(Actrapid®), glycemia decreased progressively until a minimum value (29 ± 

6 mg/dL) observed at time t = 2 hours, and 2 hours later animals had regain 

normoglycemia. Furthermore, the glycemia curve for ACTR group was 

characterized by a peak-like shape with a minimum at t = 2 hours. In 

contrast, for both nanoparticle formulations, the negative peak was 

smoothen and the curves assumed a rounder shape, enlarging the interval 

for the minimum, which in these cases was sustained from t = 0.5 hours 

(corresponding to 45 ± 6 mg/dL, PL-I and 39 ± 3 mg/dL, CDPL-I) to t = 2 

hours (corresponding to 43 ± 5 mg/dL, PL-I and 36 ± 2 mg/dL, CDPL-I). 

These observations suggest both formulations from PLGA and PLGA-?-

CDC10 blend were able to modulate insulin’s hypoglycemic effect that was 

sustained during that interval. These results are in good agreement with 

Barichello et al. experiments, in which the authors observe a similar 

sustentation for the minimum glycemia following the s.c. injection of 

insulin-loaded nanoparticles from PLGA (Barichello et al. 1999b). Moreover, 

it was observed an earlier onset on the hypoglycemic effect for animals 

administered the formulation containing ?-CDC10 along with PLGA (p &amp;lt;

0.01 vs ACTR at t = 0.5 hours) as well as a prolonged effect, still detected 6 

hours past the injection (p &amp;lt;0.05 vs all other groups). Additionally, the AAC 

for CDPL-I was 282 ± 24, significantly higher than that observed for PL-I 

(172 ± 29) and ACTR (199 ± 22) groups. On the other hand, the AAC for PL-I 

was not statistically different from that of ACTR.

6.3.4.2 Oral administration to non-diabetic rats 

Data from the s.c. administration assay support the inclusion of the 

?-CDC10 in the nanoparticle core as a means to enhance insulin’s biological 

effect. The next step was to investigate whether that formulation would 

prove beneficial in the oral administration of insulin. As depicted in Figure 

35, following the oral administration of the CDPL-I formulation to overnight 

fasted rats, no hypoglycemic effect was observed. In fact, all the test groups 

showed similar glycemic profiles throughout the experimental period 

maintaining a constant glycemia. Hence, the nanoparticle formulation was 

unable to protect insulin through the GIT.

Reformulation studies led to the coating of nanoparticles from the

acid, which is specific for enteric delivery. Upon oral administration of the

6.3.4.3 Subcutaneous administration to STZ-diabetic rats 

Since the CDPL-I formulation improved insulin’s hypoglycemic 

effect when delivered to the s.c. route in non-diabetic control rats, it was 

then evaluated the effect on an animal model of type 1 DM, the STZ-diabetic 

rat. After an overnight fast the glycemia for STZ-diabetic rats was 224 ± 27 

mg/dL, significantly higher than that observed for the non-diabetic rats in 

study I. Upon the injection of the commercial insulin formulation, glycemia 

decreased progressively but, unlike the observations for the non-diabetic 

controls that could rapidly recover from the insulin-induce hypoglycemia, 

this lowering effect was sustained up until t = 4 hours. As discussed in 

chapter 3, this is probably due to the lack of appropriate glucagon response 

in the diabetic rats (Zhou et al. 2004). When the animals received the 

nanoparticle formulation instead of Actrapid®, there were no significant

6.3.4.4 Oral glucose tolerance test in STZ-diabetic rats 

The performance during the OGTT is an indicator of the glucose 

disposal capacity. This test was performed in STZ-diabetic rats to establish 

the effect of insulin formulations under those circumstances. Insulin 

injection prior to the OGTT successfully prevented the raise in glycemia 

observed for the STZ-diabetic rats not injected with the hormone (Figure 

38). This effect was independent of the formulation. In fact, the AUC 

determined for ACTR (116 ± 10) was similar to that of CDPL-I (98 ± 12) and 

both were significantly lower than that of STZ-diabetic animals (339 ± 51).  

At the beginning of the study, glycemia values after 24 hours of 

fasting were 252 ± 29 mg/dL for the STZ-diabetic rats, significantly higher 

than those observed for non-diabetic controls (65 ± 4 mg/dL, see chapter 2).

groups. For the animals in the latter groups, glycemia descended to 53 ± 10 

mg/dL and 94 ± 27 mg/dL, respectively (p = n.s.). The range observed for 

the animals injected with the commercial insulin formulation was under 

that observed for non-diabetic controls in chapter 2 (86 ± 3 mg/dL, p &amp;lt;0.01). 

This difficulty of STZ-diabetic rats to recover from insulin-induced 

hypoglycemia had already been observed in the studies described in 

chapter 3. Interestingly, the STZ-diabetic rats administered the nanoparticle 

formulation displayed a glycemia value within the physiological range at 

the end of the test. This effect may be related with the sustained release of 

insulin to the blood and is in good agreement with the observations from 

study I.

6.4 Discussion 

6.4.1 Formulation considerations 

This chapter presented the formulation development study for 

improving insulin delivery by the use of alternative delivery systems. A 

novel formulation for insulin delivery was obtained by combining two 

strategies in the pharmaceutical technology field: the use of polymeric 

nanoparticles and modified cyclodextrins. An important achievement of this 

work was the preparation of nanoparticles from two different materials 

with the ability to self-assemble individually. The nanoprecipitation 

technique allowed for both the PLGA polymer and the amphiphilic CD 

derivative ?-CDC10 to co-nanoprecipitate and form mixed nanoparticles. 

This system presented excellent association of insulin, which was due to the 

presence of the polymer in the matrix of the nanoparticle.  

 

6.4.2 Biological relevance for the inclusion of ?-CDC10 in the 

insulin nanoparticles 

The biological relevance of polymeric (from PLGA only) and mixed 

(from the PLGA-?-CDC10 blend) formulations was first investigated in non-

diabetic controls. Those assays showed that both the nanoparticle 

formulations were able to modulate insulin action towards a more sustained 

hypoglycemic response in contrast with the peak observed when insulin 

was administered as a simple solution. This effect may result from a 

progressive release of insulin associated to the particles and/or a 

progressive absorption of the particles from the subcutaneous region to the 

blood stream. Following s.c. administration, nanoparticles and drugs are 

subjected to an absorption barrier eventually reaching systemic circulation 

via the blood capillaries or lymph vessels. Polymeric (Owens III et al. 2006) 

and CD esters-based (Gèze et al. 2007) nanoparticles accumulate mainly in 

liver and spleen upon intravenous injection. On the other hand, studies with 

solid lipid nanoparticles (Reddy et al. 2005) indicate that, in the case of s.c. 



140|Chapter 6 

injection, deposition of nanoparticles in the administration site is 

responsible for delaying and lowering tissue accumulation. In this 

experiment it could be observed a rapid hypoglycemic effect following the 

subcutaneous administration of the insulin-loaded nanoparticles, which is 

consistent with progressive release of the drug from the carrier to the blood, 

with the latter remaining at the administration site, similarly to the reports 

from studies with solid lipid nanoparticles. On the other hand, the late effect 

detected at 6 hours could be attributed to insulin released from 

nanoparticles that reach the blood after a delayed absorption. It is possible 

that the presence of ?-CDC10 in the formulation promoted the passage of the 

nanoparticles to the blood allowing for the 6th hour-effect to be noted for 

this system and not for the one prepared from PLGA alone. Since many CD 

derivatives are used in drug delivery as means to promote drug absorption 

(Sharma et al. 2005) it can be hypothesized that the CD esters in the 

nanoparticles may act as absorption enhancers.  

 

6.4.3 Insulin-carrier interactions and the oral delivery 

The excellent association of insulin to the nanoparticles was not 

compromised when the formulations were diluted in water, under those 

circumstances ~90% of the amount added to the system remain associated 

to the carrier. However, upon the s.c. injection of the nanoparticle 

formulations to non-diabetic rats, most of the biological effect was observed 

in the first 2 hours, suggesting the interactions between insulin and the 

nanoparticle carrier are easily broken in vivo resulting in the fast (although 

sustained) release of the drug from the carrier. When insulin was added to a 

pre-formulated suspension of sham nanoparticles the resulting association 

efficacy was similar to that observed when the nanoparticles were prepared 

in the presence of insulin. Taken together these observations support 

adsorption interactions between insulin and hydrophilic PLGA to be the 

major forces accounting for the drug’s association to the nanoparticle 

system. This behavior most probably is a consequence of the 



Nanoparticles for insulin delivery|141 

nanoprecipitation method, which employs very mild conditions. In other 

words, nanoparticles fail to afford a sufficient protection of the drug 

because the adsorption interactions accounting for insulin’s association to 

the carrier can be easily disrupted in vivo. Moreover, the weak nature of the 

insulin-carrier interaction is in perfect agreement with the lack of efficacy 

upon oral administration of the nanoparticles.  

On the other hand, there are some reports on the efficient delivery of 

insulin by the oral route by means of PLGA-based particles. For example, 

Cui et al. prepared insulin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles by nanoprecipitation 

and afforded to avoid the initial burst effect (i.e. the rapid release of insulin) 

by including a cellulose derivative for enteric coating in the formulation 

(Cui et al. 2007). Alternatively, Naha et al. report that microparticles 

prepared by the double emulsion method coated with Eudragit® effectively 

deliver insulin to the oral route (Naha et al. 2008). The coating strategy was 

also pursued in the studies described in this chapter. Eudragit® L30D55 was 

used as enteric coating but, despite the reduction on insulin release in acidic 

medium in vitro, the coated formulations did not translate into any 

hypoglycemic effect upon oral administration. Manufacture aspects such as 

the method of nanoparticle preparation or the amount of polymers in the 

system may be preventing the oral efficacy of the formulation, relative to 

the experiments from Cui et al. and Naha et al. above mentioned. However, 

increasing the PLGA concentration or the amount of coating material 

compromised the formation of nanoparticles by the method described in 

this chapter. 

 

6.4.4 Effect of insulin nanoparticles in the STZ-diabetic rat 

When the mixed nanoparticles from PLGA and ?-CDC10 were tested 

in STZ-diabetic rats, no differences could be observed when comparing its 

effect with that of the commercial insulin formulation. In the STZ-diabetic 

rat, the hypoglycemic period following insulin injection was longer than 

that observed in non-diabetic controls. These animals take more time to 



142|Chapter 6 

recover from insulin-induced hypoglycemia because of the lack of 

appropriate glucagon response to hypoglycemia (Zhou et al. 2004; Cui et al. 

2007). In their studies, Zhou et al. demonstrate that for normal glucagon 

secretion to occur both hypoglycemia and a discontinuation of the insulin 

signal to the ? cell (switch off hypothesis) are required (Zhou et al. 2004). 

Hence, because the physiology of the STZ-diabetic rats is quite distinct from 

that of non-diabetics a single insulin injection translates into different 

kinetics in the hypoglycemic response. Thus, the nanoparticle-induced 

sustained and prolonged hypoglycemic response that was observed in the 

case of the non-diabetic controls was probably masked in the STZ-diabetic 

rats due to the already prolonged insulin-induced hypoglycemia.  

The efficacy of the nanoparticles was yet investigated in the context 

of a glucose challenge and again no clear benefits could be attributed to the 

nanoparticle formulation for insulin delivery in STZ-diabetic rats.  

 

6.5 Conclusions 

A novel nanoparticle system for s.c. insulin delivery with high 

insulin association efficacy was successfully prepared form a mixture of 

PLGA and an amphiphilic cyclodextrin derivative (?-CDC10). The biological 

action of insulin could be enhanced by the use of the formulation, especially 

when the cyclodextrin derivative was present. This effect was observed in 

non-diabetic control rats but not in STZ-diabetic animals. The findings from 

these experiments were strongly dependent on the animal model used. 

Because of the altered physiology of the STZ-diabetic rat, modest 

improvements in insulin delivery such as the ones observed in these studies 

may not be detected. 

In drug development, animal studies usually follow an exhaustive 

set of assays that have established an optimized formulation. In these 

studies, animal experiments were moved slightly upstream and re-

formulation was done in accordance with inputs from animal studies. This 



Nanoparticles for insulin delivery|143 

allowed for re-addressing the oral route with the coating approach that 

unfortunately didn’t prove to be effective. Nonetheless, the nanoparticles 

from PLGA and ?-CDC10 promise to be a good carrier for insulin delivery 

and further formulation development should be undertaken aiming to 

strengthen the interaction between insulin and the nanoparticle matrix. For 

example, other preparation method or coating material may be envisaged.

CONCLUDING REMARKS 

Insulin is an absorptive state hormone acting in many target organs 

to promote energy storage. In the liver, insulin stimulates glycogen and 

lipid synthesis and inhibits glucose output after meals. These studies 

addressed postprandial hepatic metabolism in control and diabetic rats. In 

all the experiments, hyperglycemia in diabetic rats was accompanied by 

weight loss, consistent with impairments in glucose disposal and energy 

storage. Tracer-based experiments and NMR spectroscopy methods 

provided insight into the mechanisms underlying the metabolic disruptions 

resulting from the lack of insulin action.  

The transition from fasted to fed state is a rapid event and efficient 

short-term mechanisms must operate to readjust the hepatic metabolic 

fluxes from a positive glucose output to net storage under those 

circumstances. This setting was investigated in the carbohydrate challenge 

experiments described in chapters 2 and 3. In non-diabetic control rats, the 

gluconeogenic flux accounting to maintain EGP during the fasting period 



146?Chapter 7 
 

was diverted to glycogen synthesis and this actually constituted the major 

source of glycogen in the context of the glucose challenge. Direct conversion 

of load glucose contributed to ~30% of the glycogen synthesis but this 

fraction was reduced when other preferential substrate such as galactose 

was present. Hence, hepatic glycogen is a highly dynamic pool that 

constitutes a “first line” response in the recuperation of glucose homeostasis 

after nutritional challenges. Efficient glycogen deposition was parallel to a 

rapid clearence of glucose from the blood, and at the end of the test, EGP 

accounted for the majority (~75%) of plasma glucose in non-diabetic rats. 

This mechanism is necessary to avoid hypoglycemia resulting from a 

continuous glucose uptake from the blood. Under natural feeding 

conditions, with constant glucose provision from food intake, EGP 

contributed to only 40% of plasma glucose. 

Diabetic rats have high rates of EGP essentially due to unrestrained 

gluconeogenesis.  Their hepatic glycogen levels do not fall during fasting 

demonstrating an inability to mobilize hepatic glycogen stores for glucose 

production. Nonetheless, under normal feeding conditions there was a 

significant turnover of hepatic glycogen in the diabetic rats, indicating that a 

futile cycle of glycogen breakdown and synthesis is taking place. In non-

diabetic controls the depletion/replenishment are harmonized with the 

fasting/(re)feeding cycles but that dynamic is no longer observed in the 

diabetics. Without insulin, the hepatic glycogen pool was unresponsive to 

fasting, at least in the 24-hour period. Moreover, it also lost the capacity to 

receive the gluconeogenic flux in response to a glucose load. 

In diabetic rats, inefficient glycogen deposition after a glucose load 

was parallel to elevated EGP and reduced clearance form the blood, 

resulting in persistent hyperglycemia at the end of the 3-hour glucose 

tolerance test. A single insulin dose had no effect on improving glycogen 

synthesis in that context but efficiently controlled the contribution of EGP to 

plasma glucose levels. However, the most striking action of insulin was to 

stimulate peripheral glucose uptake. As a consequence, plasma glucose 



Concluding remarks|147 

levels decreased drastically and the animals were in fact hypoglycemic for 

at least 3-hours after the load. 

After a period of insulin replacement for 10 days, pathways for 

energy storage were enhanced but diabetic animals still experienced 

abnormal catabolic events like high gluconeogenic and lipolytic fluxes 

during feeding. This could be a consequence of insufficient or inappropriate 

insulinization and other therapeutic protocols should be studied to 

determine whether an efficient glycemic control by insulin replacement is 

able to normalize all the metabolic disruptions in diabetic rats. With the 

insulin treatments applied, the pathways for hepatic glycogen synthesis in 

the diabetic rats were restored to control levels but the hepatic glycogen 

content was only completely recovered when insulin was delivered to the 

i.p. route. Thus, targeting insulin to the liver translated into differential 

benefits on the hepatic glycogen storage. TG metabolism was also sensitive 

to insulin replacement, which translated into a reduction of plasma TGs and 

an increase in de novo hepatic TGs. 

In the context of insulin formulation development, animal studies 

are simple and straightforward assays that measure a specific 

pharmacological response, which in the case of insulin typically is the 

hypoglycemic effect. These assays are important in establishing the 

biological interest of a particular formulation and should be integrated with 

formulation re-assessments for optimizing drug delivery. In the 

experimental work of this thesis, a novel nanoparticle formulation for 

insulin delivery was developed and its biological relevance demonstrated in 

a simple animal experimental setting, but those findings were not 

reproduced when a more complex diabetic rat model was studied and 

further formulation development is required. After 

formulation/reformulation studies, animal experiments should include the 

assays for addressing the hepatic metabolic effects of insulin in the 

postabsorptive state to determine whether liver-targeted insulin action can 

be afforded.
