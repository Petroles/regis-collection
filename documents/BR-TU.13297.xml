Resumo 
 
 
 A ‘sonoporação’ é um processo através do qual a permeabilidade de membranas 

celulares é modificada. Esta alteração na membrana leva à formação de poros através dos 

quais pequenas moléculas conseguem passar. Nas últimas decadas, investigação na área 

de viroterapia mediada por ultrassons focalizados, na presença de agentes de contraste, 

designados por ‘micro bolhas’, provou que este tratamento poderia ser uma boa 

alternativa para o tratamento de tumores. As terapias em estudo incluem estratégias tais 

como o recurso a vírus oncolíticos que têm afinidade para tecidos inflamados e que por 

activação do sistema imunitário causam a sua destruição – estes vírus são conhecidos em 

viroterapia como ‘vírus suicidas’.  

 Aplicações com vírus oncolíticos encontram no processo de sonoporação uma 

forma de aumentar/facilitar a entrada de conteúdo viral para o interior das células 

cancerígenas mas existem ainda muitos problemas a ultrapassar em termos de eficiência 

e segurança para que estes tratamentos possam ser utilizados em meio clínico. A 

toxicidade da ‘terapia viral’ é um dos maiores problemas associados e com o intuito de 

minimizar este problema, foi desenvolvida uma nova técnica designada por ‘Isolated 

Limb Perfusion’ (ILP). Esta técnica tem por base o isolamento de vasos sanguíneos que 

irrigam a região do tumor, normalmente aplicada nos membros superiores ou inferiores, 

isolando o membro da circulação sistémica através de um torniquete. A técnica ILP vai 

ser usada neste projecto em ratos da linhagem Brown Norwegian, nos quais serão 

implantadas células cancerígenas (linha de células de fibrosarcoma BN175) nos membros 

inferiores. 

 Um fibrosarcoma/sarcoma é um tumor maligno dos tecidos moles que 

normalmente se desenvolve nos membros inferiores. Os tratamentos para este tipo de 

cancro incluem uma cirurgia extremamente invasiva com possibilidade de remoção do

membro para garantir a sobrevivência do doente e que é normalmente combinada com 

radioterapia.  

 Posto isto, é muito importante que se promova a investigação neste tipo de terapias 

de forma a tornar os tratamentos menos invasivos. Com este objectivo, este projecto é um 

estudo piloto com fundamento num estudo de Pencavel et al., com o título “Isolated limb 

perfusion with melphalan, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and oncolytic vaccinia virus 

improves tumour targeting and prolongs survival in a rat model of advanced extremity 

sarcoma”, publicado em 2015 em International Journal of Cancer. Assim, o propósito 

deste estudo é adicionar ‘ultrassons focalizados’ a esta terapia combinada para verificar 

se i) há um aumento da entrada e replicação do vírus de forma a aumentar a eficiência do 

tratamento e ii) se existe a possibilidade de evitar o uso de um factor de necrose tumoral 

(TNF-?) para reduzir a toxicidade do tratamento. Este factor, pretence a um grupo de 

citocinas capaz de provocar a morte de células tumorais e que possuem uma vasta gama 

de acções pró-inflamatórias sendo altamente tóxico quando em circulação sistémica. 

 A distribuição de vírus mediada por ultrassons oferece uma oportunidade para a 

realização de terapia direccionada não-invasiva em órgãos internos específicos. Para isto, 

a sonoporação envolve o uso de micro bolhas que são injectadas na corrente sanguínea 

em conjunto com os restantes agentes químicos e os vírus. Quando estas micro bolhas são 

expostas aos feixes de ultrassons focalizados, a uma dada frequência, estas expandem-se 

e contraem com rapidez. Se as micro bolhas estiverem próximas de uma membrana 

celular, a sua deformação ou fragmentação física aumenta a porosidade da membrana 

celular. O mecanismo exacto envolvido ainda não é completamente compreendido, mas 

é associado a cavitação acústica que pode ser estável ou instável. A cavitação estável 

ocorre quando as bolhas oscilam por sucessivas compressões e descompressões mas 

permanecem intactas. Por outro lado, a cavitação instável ocorre quando são usadas 

amplitudes de alta pressão, conduzindo ao colapso das bolhas. 

 Os principais objectivos deste projecto piloto são estudar a distribuição do vírus 

nos tumores e quantificar o número de particulas virais com capacidade de se replicarem. 

Isto é conseguido através de ensaios químicos como qPCR (quantitative real-time 

Polymerase Chain Reaction), Plaque Assay (para quantificar a presença de vírus) e 

Imunofluorescência. Este processo vai incluir experiências in vitro com a linha de células 

BN175, inicialmente para testar o efeito da utilização de (i) ultrassons focalizados (ii) 

micro bolhas e (iii) ultrassons focalizados e micro bolhas.

 As experiências in vitro vão incluir o estudo do efeito de diferentes parâmetros 

físicos tais como: o valor de pressão in situ causado pela propagação da onda de som; a 

quantidade de tempo em que os ultrassons são emitidos durante um determinado tempo 

de exposição (Duty Cycle); a frequência de repetição do pulso de ultrassom; o tempo de 

exposição e a concentração de micro bolhas na solução a ser testada. O objectivo da 

variação destes parâmetros, que é feita com base na literatura, tem como objectivo 

promover a cavitação instável e ao mesmo tempo evitar que isto cause a morte das células 

cancerígenas para garantir que os vírus poderão vir a atravessar a membrana de células 

viáveis. A partir dos resultados encontrados através das experiências in vitro, serão 

escolhidos os melhores parâmetros a utilizar in vivo para determinar se uma terapia que 

combina ultrassons focalizados,  Melphalan, TNF-? e Vírus da Varíola (geneticamente 

modicado para uma ‘versão’ menos infecciosa) será uma potencial forma de 

tratamento/cura de tumores, de forma menos invasiva. 

 Para realizar as experiências in vitro, foi realizada uma calibração dos 

equipamentos a utilizar, nomeadamente dos transdutores, para garantir que todos os 

‘outputs’ são conhecidos (com uma incerteza de 10% associada). Além disto, foi 

realizado um estudo para perceber quais são os valores de pressão que favorecem a 

cavitação inercial para poder associar os resultados à presença ou ausência de cavitação 

inercial, de acordo com os parâmetros utilizados. Os testes in vitro mostraram que valores 

de pressão superiores a 0.9 MPa, para valores fixos de frequência de repetição do pulso 

de 100 Hz, um feixe com 40 ciclos e uma exposição de 0.5 s, reduzem a viabilidade das 

células em cerca de 80%. A variação dos restantes parâmetros parece não ter muita 

influência a nível da viabilidade celular. Os resultados in vivo não permitem concluir 

acerca do aumento da eficiência do tratamento pois os níveis de pressão in situ utilizados 

parecem ser nocivos ou para as partículas virais ou para as células – mais experiências 

serão necessárias para tirar conclusões in vivo.

Abstract 

 
 

 The phenomenon by which ultrasound may transiently alter the structure of the 

cellular membrane, and thus allowing enhanced uptake of low and high molecular weight 

molecules into the cell is defined as Sonoporation. In gene therapy, the main goal is to 

increase the delivery efficiency of exogenous nucleic acid to a site-specific target. For 

gene transfer using sonoporation, the biophysical effects involved include cavitation, 

radiation pressure, and microstreaming - the shear forces present near the microbubbles. 

The acoustic pressures required to destroy microbubbles lie in the diagnostic range, and 

if these are too high or last too long, undesirable levels of cell killing will occur, resulting 

in poor DNA transfer.  

 There is the need to develop a new treatment for a soft tissue tumor defined as 

fibrosarcoma which is a malignant tumor that usually develops in the legs and whose 

treatment involves a wide excision, usually combined with radiation therapy. This project 

is a pilot study in which Focused Ultrasound and Microbubbles is added to a combined 

therapy including Melphalan, TNF-? and Vaccinia Virus to try to enhance the efficacy 

and reduce the toxicity of the treatment. The main goals of this pilot project are to study 

tumor virus distribution and then to quantify the number of viral particles in the tumors 

using appropriate assays (e.g. qPCR, Plaque Assay, Immunofluorescence). This involves 

in vitro experiments with BN175 rat sarcoma line, initially to test a combination therapy 

with the virus in the presence or absence of (i) focused ultrasound (ii) microbubble and 

(iii) focused ultrasound and microbubbles.  

 The physical parameters to be optimised are peak rarefactional focal pressures, 

duty cycle, pulse repetition frequency, exposure duration and microbubble concentration. 

 In vitro results suggest that once inertial cavitation starts, the viability of BN175

cells decreases and this effect is higher in the presence of microbubbles. In vivo 

experiments in Brown Norwegian rats should help to determine the effectiveness of the 

combined therapy using Focused Ultrasound in the presence of Microbubbles, Melphalan, 

TNF-? and Vaccinia Virus using the technique of Isolated Limb Perfusion but the results 

suggest that the use of Focused Ultrasound and Microbubbles might be killing the virus. 

Although, the results from qPCR analysis and viral plaque assays are not enough to 

confirm this theory and the histochemical analysis failed.

MPa. No cavitation was detected, because no exposure was made. Therefore in this case 

the whole trace represents off-time noise of the entire PCD detection system. The graph 

title shows that this was exposure number one, with data acquired on Ch0 of the DAQ 

system. Average noise is 0.730 ± 0.0941 mV, and highest noise is  ~0.8 mV. .............. 83

1.  Introduction 
 

 

  Chapter by Chapter Overview 
 

 

1.1.1. Chapter 1 – Introduction to Transducers Calibration 

 

 The Introductory part of this thesis is divided in sections such as i) “Motivation 

and Background”, in which there is a brief description of the main concepts and of the 

project itself, ii) Hypothesis and Thesis Aim”, where the hypothesis is that Focused 

UltraSound (FUS) in the presence of MicroBubbles (MB) enhances the activity of 

oncolytic virotherapy delivered during Isolated Limb Perfusion (ILP) through several 

mechanisms which include direct anti-tumour activity and enhancement of the activity of 

melphalan/TNF-? and increased intratumoural delivery of oncolytic viruses. For this, the 

FUS fields to be used will be characterised using well established techniques. In vivo 

experiments will be made in Brown Norwegian Rats implanted with fibrosarcoma cells 

(BN175 cell line) and then an overview on, iii) Virotherapy for Cancer, iv) Focused 

Ultrasound in Cancer Therapies, v) Basic Principles of FUS, vi) Cellular interaction

1.1.2. Chapter 2 – Calibration of a Focused Ultrasound Transducer 

and Measurement of Cavitation Thresholds under Different 

Frequencies 

 

 This chapter is divided into two main sections. The first section describes the 

ultrasound beam, its propagation and the processes involved in Transducers Calibration. 

There are three sub-sections for Transducers Calibration: an introduction, then the 

methodology used and finally the results. The second part of this chapter has to do with 

the Measurement of Cavitation Thresholds at three different drive frequencies. A Brief

Review on the topic is the first sub-section and this is followed by the description of the 

Methods and then the Results which are presented paired with the Discussion of the 

Results. 

 

 

1.1.3. Chapter 3 - In Vitro Study on the Effects of Focused Ultrasound 

on BN175 Sarcoma Cell Line 

 

 This chapter focuses on the potential of ultrasound and microbubbles to enhance 

drug delivery by the process of Sonoporation, i.e. the formation of temporary pores in the 

cell membrane, as well as enhanced Endocytosis that have been reported as the main 

biological mechanisms involved. In general, the uptake of drugs or small molecules is 

attributed to ultrasound mediated transient permeabilization of the cell membrane. This 

transient permeabilization can occur due to stable and inertial cavitation events in the 

presence or absence of artificial microbubbles. To confirm this, physical parameters of 

ultrasound such as Peak Negative Pressure (PNP), Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF), 

Duty Cycle (DC) and Duration of Exposure (DE) have been tested at different levels to 

see how this could affect the fibrosarcoma cell line. The Methodoly used is described and 

a Discussion of the Results helps to take some conclusions. 

 

 

1.1.4. Chapter 4 - In Vivo Study on the Development of a Combined 

Treatment for Cancer using Virus and Focused Ultrasound 

 

 The toxicity of viral therapy is a concern and to minimize it, a novel technique 

known as Isolation Limb Perfusion has been developed. This is a chemotherapeutic 

technique using melphalan, Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-?), oncolytic vaccinia 

virus and involving the cannulation of the blood vessels feeding the tumour-bearing 

region and isolation of the limb from the systemic circulation by tourniquet mainly due 

to the severe toxicity of TNF-?. ILP is used in this project, which aims to study the 

combination of ILP and FUS in the presence of microbubbles to increase viral penetration 

of tumour bulk in Brown Norwegian rats transfected with BN175 fibrosarcoma cells. The 

in vivo work is described in Chapter 4 and this includes a short introduction, the 

description of methods and then the presentation of the results and its discussion.  

1.1.5. Chapter 5 - Conclusions and Future Work

 This chapter helps to summarize all the conclusions from the experiments of this 

pilot project but also, contains some important suggestions on what could have been done 

better and what could be done in the future. 

 

 

  Motivation and Background 
 

 Sonoporation is a process by which the permeability of a membrane is changed. 

This alteration in the membrane generates a passage through which small molecules can 

enter. During the last decades, research on focused ultrasound and microbubble mediated 

virotherapy has been carried out and proved to be a good approach to cancer treatment. 

The treatments under research include strategies such as viral transduction of tumour cells 

with ‘suicide genes’, using viral infection to trigger immune-mediated tumour cell death 

and using oncolytic viruses for their direct anti-tumour action.  

 For oncolytic viruses, sonoporation seems to be important to get increased viral 

uptake in cells but the safety and efficiency of the overall process needs to be studied for 

clinical use. The toxicity of viral therapy is a concern and to minimize it, a novel technique 

known as Isolated Limb Perfusion has been developed. This is a chemotherapeutic 

technique involving the cannulation of the blood vessels feeding the tumour-bearing 

region and isolation of the limb from the systemic circulation by tourniquet. ILP will be 

used in this project in Brown Norwegian rats transfected with BN175 Fibrosarcoma cells. 

 A Fibrosarcoma is malignant soft tissue tumor or sarcoma that usually grows in 

the lower extremities of the human body. Treatment for a fibrosarcoma involves a wide 

excision, usually combined with radiation therapy. In severe cases of fibrosarcoma, it 

might be necessary to remove the entire limb to guarantee the survival of the patient.  

 Research must be done to diminish the invasiveness of tumor therapies. This 

project is a pilot study based on a study of Pencavel et al. which is entitled as “Isolated 

limb perfusion with melphalan, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and oncolytic vaccinia virus 

improves tumour targeting and prolongs survival in a rat model of advanced extremity 

sarcoma” that was published in 2015 in the International Journal of Cancer. So, the aim 

is to add Focused Ultrasound to this combined therapy to see i) if there is an increased 

uptake and replication of virus for enhanced efficacy of the treatment and ii) if there is a

31 

possibility to avoid the use of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, which is toxic when in the 

systemic circulation, to reduce the invasiveness of the treatment. 

 The main goals of this pilot project are to study tumor virus distribution and then 

to quantify the number of viral particles in the tumors using appropriate assays (e.g. 

qPCR, Plaque Assay, Immunofluorescence). This will involve in vitro experiments with 

the BN175 rat sarcoma line, initially to test a combination therapy with the virus in the 

presence or absence of (i) focused ultrasound (ii) microbubble and (iii) focused ultrasound 

and microbubbles.  

 The physical parameters to be optimised are peak negative pressures, duty cycle, 

pulse repetition frequency, exposure duration and microbubble concentration. Once a 

range of optimal parameters has been found, these will be applied in in vivo Brown 

Norwegian rats in order to determine if a combined therapy using Focused Ultrasound, 

Melphalan, TNF-? and Vaccinia Virus using the technique of ILP. TNF-? is a cell 

signaling protein (cytokine) involved in systemic inflammation that is also capable of 

induce fever, apoptotic cell death, and inhibit tumorigenesis and viral replication. This 

molecule is mortal in the concentration it is used in this therapy so it will also be studied 

the possibility to avoid this chemotherapeutic agent to reduce the toxicity of the treatment. 

 

 

 

  Contributions 
 

 The hypothesis to be tested was that Focused Ultrasound in the presence of 

microbubbles enhances the efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy delivered during Isolated 

Limb Perfusion through several mechanisms, which include direct anti-tumour activity, 

enhancement of the activity of melphalan/TNF-alpha, and increased intratumoural 

delivery of oncolytic viruses.  

 The following specific research aims were addressed: 

 

1. Characterisation (in vitro and in vivo) of the effects of FUS and MB on standard 

ILP with melphalan/TNF-alpha in rat distal limb sarcoma.  

2. Evaluation of FUS + MB over a range of ultrasound intensities as a means of 

enhancing intratumoural delivery of oncolytic virotherapy during ILP. These 

studies included the evaluation of viral biodistribution using viral plaque assays, 

quantitative PCR, analysis of gene expression and non-invasive imaging 

(bioluminescent and GFP/RFP imaging), – characterisation of the effects of

therapeutic FUS + MB with ILP-delivered oncolytic virotherapy. These studies 

involved the evaluation of the effects of treatment schedule and dose and included 

in vivo (direct measurement, imaging analysis). 

 

 The FUS fields used were characterised using well established techniques and the 

ultrasound parameters investigated were peak negative pressures, duty cycle, Pulse 

repetition frequency, and duration of exposure. These parameters were varied with the 

aim of identifying the conditions that gave the optimal viability for the sarcoma cell line 

used (BN175 cell line).  These were investigated in combination with commercially 

available ultrasound contrast agents (i.e. MB) in an attempt to find the most effective 

exposure.  The mechanisms for any observed effects were studied.  Ultrasonic cavitation 

was monitored, and its influence investigated. 

 The therapeutic efficacy of FUS/MB-assisted oncolytic virotherapy during ILP, 

this was tested in immunocompetent brown Norwegian rats bearing BN175 syngeneic 

tumours.  These models allowed evaluation of effects of the combination therapy on 

locoregional control. 

 

 Virotherapy for Cancer 
 

 The possibility of treating the underlying causes instead of solely its symptoms, 

and thus eliminating disease, is getting closer and closer to reality when we talk about 

cancer. Research is being undertaken in the field of viral based gene delivery systems and 

has already proved to be useful for the treatment of some tumors [1-4].  

 Over the last century, clinicians have already used a spectrum of wild-type viruses 

to treat cancer patients. However this approach was temporarily abandoned not only due 

to adverse biological effects of the virus and to safety of both patients and staff, but also 

because of enthusiasm for the advent of chemotherapy [5]. Over the past decade, research 

in this field has once again been taking place, with several viruses having been evaluated.  

Genetic engineering of viruses to target cancers safely is now a few steps away from 

worldwide clinical application - the first agent is about to be approved for use as a novel 

cancer therapy modality [6, 7].

 The use of oncolytic viruses in oncology is called virotherapy, and nowadays is 

one of the most promising cancer therapy methods. Viral-mediated gene delivery systems 

consist of site-specific delivery of viruses which are modified to be replication-deficient 

outside the target tissue, but which can deliver DNA for expression. In this context, 

viruses can be used as anti-cancer agents which attack malignant cells, while healthy cells 

remain relatively undamaged. Different kinds of viral vector systems are used, including 

retrovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, herpes simpex virus or lentivirus [8]. As 

well as having an anti-cancer effect, oncolytic viruses are also capable of inducing an 

anti-tumour immune response – immunotherapy – which is thought to help in eliminating 

residual cancer cells or in maintaining micrometastases in a state of dormancy [9]. 

 Adenoviral vectors are the most promising and widely used platform for gene 

therapy and virotherapy. However, there have been problems associated with their use 

[10]. The major challenges in adenovirus-mediated cancer gene therapy and virotherapy 

are poor transduction in human tumors, and the existence of immune responses against 

the adenovirus that drastically limit the vector transduction efficiency and the duration of 

transgene expression [11]. In order to avoid these problems, several strategies have been 

proposed, these include the modification of the viral particles to provide increased affinity 

to tumor receptors, and to facilitate binding and replication, and the use of 

immunosuppressive agents to eliminate a possible anti-viral immune response [10-12]. 

Others goals, which focus on treatment efficacy, are to obtain specificity to cancer cells 

(in order to avoid damaging normal cells), and improvement in the means of inducing cell 

death by modifying viral proteins to destroy cancer cells by promotion of viral replication 

in malignant cells but not in normal cells, thus enabling the targeting of metastastic cancer 

cells. A third goal in terms of efficiency is to improve transduction – the delivery of 

therapeutic genes into cancer cells. The overall efficacy of the treatment of tumors with 

viral particles can also be enhanced if combined with methods that help to open the 

membranes of cancer cells [11, 12]. 

 There are tumor specific viral vectors which are equipped with an efficient 

delivery system, and are ready for immediate use in in vivo mouse models, and for testing 

in clinical trials, but still can not be used to treat patients on a regular basis. The therapy 

most used to treat tumours is chemotherapy. It helps to shrink tumors but this is usually 

reversible – the tumors can grow again and become resistant to the treatment. This 

resistance can be reduced if chemotherapy is combined with other treatments which rely 



_______________________________________________________________________

on different mechanisms for attacking and killing cancerous cells. The main problem of 

combined therapies is the toxicity – it must be reduced as much as possible - and special 

attention to other possible safety issues such as environmental shedding, mutation and 

reversion to wildtype virus is necessary [7]. 

 One novel cancer therapy technique under investigation is Isolated Limb 

Perfusion using melphalan, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and oncolytic vaccinia virus. 

Improved tumour targeting has been reported by Pencavel et al [13]in terms of 

transduction route and prolonged survival in a rat model with advanced extremity 

sarcoma . Standard in vitro assays were used to characterise the single and combined 

effect of melphalan, Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-?) and Lister strain vaccinia 

virus (GLV-1h68), which is an attenuated recombinant vaccinia virus (VACV) that 

selectively colonizes established human xenografts, thus inducing their complete 

regression, in BN175 rat sarcoma cells. An orthotopic model of advanced extremity 

sarcoma (a model in which the tumor is localised in the place in the body where it belongs) 

was used to evaluate the survival of animals after receiving ILP with this triple Melphalan, 

TNF-? and Vaccinia Virus therapy . Successful pre-clinical results, in terms of reduced 

tumor growth and increased rat survival, have highlighted the need to develop a treatment 

with increased viral uptake in which invasiveness can be reduced, and where post-

treatment surgery is not needed. In addressing this goal, this project focuses on the study 

of the combination of ILP and FUS in the presence of microbubbles to increase viral 

penetration efficiency of tumour bulk in Brown Norwegian rats transfected with BN175 

fibrosarcoma cells. 

 

  Focused Ultrasound in Cancer Therapies 
 

 A method of improving the specificity and efficiency of any treatment is crucially 

needed.  The difficulty of getting molecules across membranes to reach the cell nucleus, 

for tumour treatment, may potentially be overcome using Focused Ultrasound. It can be 

used to facilitate the transport of molecules into cells by altering their membrane 

permeability. 

 Therapeutic ultrasound is a continuously expanding field and new clinical 

applications are constantly being developed. The term ‘Ultrasound’ (US) is used to

describe sound waves with frequency above the upper limit of the human hearing range 

(&gt;20 kHz). Applications of medical ultrasound can be divided into focused and unfocused 

therapies with devices operating at frequencies from 20 kHz to 5MHz [14, 15]. The 

energy produced by these devices propagates in soft tissue as longitudinal pressure waves, 

interacting with tissue through reflection, scatter and absorption [16, 17]. 

 Major advances have been made in some fields of medical US and one of major 

interest is Focused Ultrasound surgery. In clinical focused ultrasound treatments, US 

energy of frequencies in the range 0.5 – 5 MHz is concentrated into a focal spot of 

millimetric dimensions. The biophysical effects of ultrasound are traditionally separated 

into those of thermal and non-thermal (acoustic streaming and acoustic cavitation) origin 

[18, 19]. However, it may not be completely correct to assume that there is no rise in 

temperature when considering non-thermal effects, because the interaction between tissue 

and ultrasound usually results in energy absorption, and therefore a temperature rise [18]. 

Conversely, acoustic fields which aim to cause heating can also give rise to non-thermal 

effects. 

 Non-thermal mechanisms include: Acoustic Streaming which arises from the loss 

of momentum when the ultrasound hits a target, and provides a driving force capable of 

displacing ions and small molecules; Acoustic cavitation, defined as the interaction 

between sound waves and microscopic gas bubbles within a fluid. The compression and 

rarefaction present in the ultrasound field lead to bubble compression and expansion [20].  

 Focused ultrasound can be used to enhance the ability of a virus to infect cells 

upon arrival at a target, in part, because of the increased blood flow which is the body’s 

biological response to the temperature rise at the focus, but mainly because it can cause a 

temporary change in cell membrane permeability.  Acoustic Cavitation plays an important 

role in this process. 

 

1.5.1. Acoustic Cavitation 
 

 Acoustic cavitation helps to concentrate acoustic energy into small volumes. 

Inertial cavitation can lead to a local rise in temperature of thousands of kelvin, pressures 

of GPa, high local accelerations and shockwaves. Acoustic cavitation thus constitutes a 



_______________________________________________________________________ 
 

_______________________________________________________________________ 
36 

complex multidisciplinary problem, involving a wide range of temporal and spatial 

scales, and is difficult to measure, control, predict, and to scale up. 

 Two types of acoustic cavitation are defined: stable and inertial. Stable cavitation 

occurs when a bubble oscillates steadily in an ultrasonic field, intercepting and re-

radiating energy to the surrounding tissue, causing microstreaming, which can, in turn, 

leads to shear stresses which can damage cells.  This form of cavitation is characterised 

by the emission of harmonics and ultra-harmonics of the drive frequency, which can be 

monitored. Above a certain pressure amplitude threshold, oscillation becomes non-linear 

and the bubbles expand and collapse vigorously resulting in localised acoustic pressures 

of several thousand atmospheres that cause damage to cells in their immediate vicinity- 

this is known as inertial cavitation and is characterized by broadband acoustic emissions 

in addition to the harmonics and ultraharmonics of stable cavitation.  

 Inertial cavitation occurring near a cell boundary can cause transient membrane 

rupture due to shock waves and jetting during microbubble collapse [21]. This effect, also 

known as “sonoporation” , is thought to be a major contributor towards improving 

intracellular drug and gene delivery [22, 23] – see Figure 1.1. Sonoporation is of special 

interest due to its non-invasive nature, and its potential for treating tissues located several 

centimetres deep within the body.

 An ultrasound exposure may be carried out on its own [24] or in the presence of 

gas microbubbles [25]. Microbubbles are stabilised gas bubbles used to increase scatter 

to provide ultrasound imaging contrast, but which can also serve as nuclei for acoustic 

cavitation. The gas filling the bubble provides elasticity to the bubble which in turn 

opposes the resistance to any compression or expansion imposed by the liquid motion. 

This force may put the liquid into motion, so that the bubble constitutes a mass–spring 

system [26]. When excited at large amplitudes, the bubble oscillations can exhibit a non-

linear behaviour.  When the ratio of the linear resonance frequency and the driving 

frequency – f0/f - approaches a rational number n/m, a non-linear resonance can occur 

and the amplitude of the bubble oscillations increases. The 1/1 peak corresponds to the 

linear resonance frequency. Following the accepted terminology, the resonances n/1 are 

called harmonic, the resonances 1/m are sub-harmonic, while the rational ratio n/m gives 

ultra-harmonic resonances [26]. 

 In gene therapy, the combination of gas microbubbles with ultrasound can result 

in greater delivery efficiency than when no microbubbles are present [25, 27] and there 

are differences in the effects produced in the cells when in high or low in situ ultrasound 

pressures are used. The probability of cavitation increases with increasing pressure and 

decreasing frequency. This has been extensively investigated with ultrasound contrast 

agents and microbubbles have been shown to lower the threshold of cavitation [28]. 

 

1.5.2. High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Therapy 
 

 The potential of focused ultrasound to produce localised destruction of deep tissue 

structures has been known since the early 1950s [15]. Focused Ultrasound at intensities 

in the range 102–104W/cm2 is known as High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) [29]. 

In medical HIFU treatments, US energy is focused into a millimeter or even a sub 

millimeter sized focal spot to heat and destroy the targeted tissue, while ideally not 

damaging tissue outside the focal region. When the ultrasonic energy absorption in a focal 

volume is sufficient to raise the temperature above 55ºC for 1s or longer,  proteins are 

denaturated, causing immediate cell death – the volume of dead cells being referred to as 

“lesion” [15, 29]. The two mechanisms believed to be most important for tissue 

destruction are heating and acoustic cavitation [29]. 



_______________________________________________________________________ 
 

_______________________________________________________________________ 
38 

 HIFU was first developed for localised tissue destruction in the brain by Fry et al. 

[30, 31].  Burov, in 1956 [32], was the first to suggest its use for cancer therapy. Early 

use was made of HIFU in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and for a number of 

ophthalmological problems (including the treatment of glaucoma and retinal tears) [15]. 

 The possibility of non-invasive targeting of subcutaneous tissue volumes has 

made HIFU a potential substitute for surgery for liver, bladder, prostate and kidney 

tumors. Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies worldwide 

and hepatic metastases are a common cause of death in cancer patients [14]. This 

technique may not require surgery, anaesthesia or adjuvant cytotoxic drugs, and thus the 

likely side effects are minimal. 

 The preceding description of High Intensity Focused Ultrasound indicates that this 

technique as a powerful tool for fighting malignant cells, but not that it is a means of 

enhancing therapeutic efficiency for drug/viral delivery. However, a combination of 

differents levels of intensity can be used to advantage for this. 

 

 

1.5.3. Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound Therapy 
 

 Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound is associated with intensities below 

approximately 102W/cm2 [29], and its main applications are in bone healing, 

sonothrombolysis, ultrasonic enhancement of drug uptake by sonophoresis and 

sonoporation and gene therapy [15]. 

 The way in which bone repair may be accelerated by ultrasound is still not fully 

understood. Mechanisms that have been proposed are signal transduction, enhancement 

of gene expression, blood flow changes, tissue modelling effects or micro-mechanical 

stresses. In sonothrombolysis, the dissolution of blood clots is mediated by ultrasound, 

both in the absence and in the presence of microbubbles, and the responsible mechanisms 

are suggested to be acoustic cavitation, streaming, and mechanical interaction that affect 

the fibrin mesh, thus allowing disruption and better access for drugs [15].  

 The applications of most interest for this project are the ultrasonic enhancement 

of drug uptake and gene therapy, although this is an area of study that is still poorly 

understood. Sonoporation and gene therapy have similarities since both involve an

39 

alteration in membranes to facilitate the entrance of therapeutic vectors. Sonoporation is 

the term used for the phenomenon by which ultrasound may transiently alter the structure 

of the cellular membrane, and thus allowing enhanced uptake of low and high molecular 

weight molecules into the cell. In gene therapy the main goal is to increase the delivery 

efficiency of exogenous nucleic acid to a site-specific target – the main vehicles being 

studied are viral and non-viral vectors. [15]. 

 For gene transfer using sonoporation, the biophysical effects involved include 

cavitation, radiation pressure, and microstreaming - the shear forces present near the 

microbubbles. [16]. The acoustic pressures required to destroy microbubbles lie in the 

diagnostic range, and if these are too high or last too long, undesirable levels of cell killing 

will occur, resulting in poor DNA transfer [34]. 

 Microbubbles may be added to the blood circulation to aid drug delivery.  These 

lower the threshold for acoustic cavitation and can also be manipulated to be drug carriers. 

 It is possible to encapsulate drugs within the bubbles, they may be incorporated 

either into the shell or inside it in some way, for example using ligands embedded into 

the lipid membrane. It is also possible to construct microbubbles with a multilayered shell 

containing drug [15, 23, 25]. The loaded microbubbles, can be metabolized and 

accumulated within the target volume. Low intensity ultrasound can then destroy them 

locally, releasing the drug. The spatial localisation relies on the ability to confine the 

ultrasound beam to the required target volume [15].  

 There are allways bio-effects associated with ultrasound, but their significance 

depends on the intensity and duration of the exposure. At low intensities, any effect seen 

is likely to be reversible and/or beneficial. On the other hand, at high intensities it is 

possible to destroy tissue by protein denaturation, and this may be really useful in 

oncology [15]. The diagnostic and therapeutic ability of ultrasound turns it into a very 

interesting tool for research and optimisation in the medical field.  

 

 

  Basic Principles of Focused Ultrasound 
 

 Ultrasound is known for its routine use in imaging, and research in this area 

allowed the discovery of powerful potential for therapeutic applications. A range of

biological effects can be induced by ultrasound, each depending on a wide variety of 

physical parameters that may be varied. 

 Focused Ultrasound is gaining rapid clinical acceptance as a treatment modality 

which enables non-invasive tissue heating and ablation for numerous applications.  One 

of the greatest advantages of this technique is the possibility of non-invasivetargeting the 

ultrasound focus deep in the tissue . Focused beams can be used at high power, with the 

source placed either outside the body (for treatment of tumours of, for example, the 

abdomen, breast, uterus, and bone, either for surgery or for enhanced uptake of 

drugs/virus) or in the rectum (for treatment of the prostate), and are designed to treat 

thetarget tissue volume, while leaving tissue in the ultrasound propagation path relatively 

unaffected. A brief description of the principles of operation and physics associated with 

focused ultrasound will be addressed in this chapter. 

 A wave capable of travelling through multiple tissue layers until it reaches the 

target is produced from an ultrasound transducer. At each tissue interface, part of the 

energy carried by the sound wave will be reflected, with the remaining energy being 

transmitted. The amount of transmission at the interface depends primarily on the 

difference in acoustic impedance, Z (defined as the product of density and speed of sound, 

between the two tissue layers) [35]. At interfaces where there is little difference in 

acoustic properties, the transmission coefficient is close to unity. With the exception of 

fat, air and bone, most tissues in the human body have acoustic properties similar to those 

of water. Aqueous media are therefore optimal for coupling ultrasound energy from the 

transducer into the body, and reflections at tissue interfaces are generally weak [35]. 

 Within a tissue layer, an ultrasound beam consists of pressure fluctuations which 

result in frictional heating. Part of the mechanical energy carried by the incident wave is 

thus converted into heat by this viscous absorption, which constitutes the primary 

mechanism for ultrasound-induced hyperthermia [35, 36]. In an inhomogenous medium, 

regions with different acoustic properties will scatter the incident wave in various 

directions, causing a loss of acoustic intensity in the direction of sound propagation. 

 The loss in incident acoustic energy in a medium is characterised by its attenuation 

coefficient, µ, given by the sum of the absorption coefficient ?? and the scattering 

coefficient ??. Following propagation through a distance x in a medium of attenuation 

coefficient µ, the ultrasound intensity, I, is given by ? = ?0?
??? where I0 is the incident

ultrasound intensity at the origin (x=0). For most tissues, the attenuation coefficient is 

related to the ultrasound frequency, f, by a power law of the form ? = ?? ?  where a and 

b are constants specific for each tissue [35].  

 It is this dependency of attenuation on frequency that makes ultrasound 

particularly useful to non-invasive therapies, but which causes some significant 

challenges in optimising the overall treatment procedure. Higher ultrasound frequencies 

give a power-dependent increase of both the absorption and attenuation coefficient. This 

implies a trade off between penetration, associated with low frequencies, and absorption, 

paired with high frequencies. Therefore, the optimal choice of therapeutic ultrasound 

frequency is application-specific, and represents a compromise between treatment depth 

and the desired rate of heating [36].  

 When a large-amplitude single-frequency sound wave propagates through a 

nonlinear medium there is a leakage of energy from the fundamental frequency into its 

higher harmonics. The extent to which such leakage occurs depends on the amplitude of 

the incident wave, on the nonlinearity of the medium and on the distance travelled by the 

wave into the medium. The nonlinear effects become increasingly significant as the depth 

of treatment is increased, or if a region of high intensity happens to be coincident with a 

layer of tissue with significantly different acoustic impedance [35]. 

 Acoustic cavitation, previously discussed in chapter 1.3.1., and classified into 

stable and inertial behaviour, depends on the bubble size compared to the linear resonance 

size at the frequency of insonation, the ultrasound exposure parameters, and on the 

relative contribution of vapour and gas pressures to the total pressure inside the bubbles 

[35]. The presence of bubbles results in a change in the acoustic impedance of the tissue 

volume, yielding larger reflection coefficients at the boundaries of the cavitating region. 

In any given medium, the relative increase in any of these coefficients will depend 

primarily on the bubble number density, the range of bubble sizes and the type of 

cavitation activity being excited [37]. At a given pressure level, the relative contribution 

of nonlinear effects and cavitation depends on the threshold pressure at which cavitation 

occurs, the tissue temperature and the distance over which ultrasound has propagated 

[35]. 

 Most clinical applications of Focused Ultrasound make use these effects occurring 

during the propagation of ultrasound waves. Negative acoustic pressures (~1 to 5 MPa)

and high temperatures caused by HIFU exposures contribute to the formation of gas 

cavities.  Cavitation detection can be performed acoustically by detection of 

subharmonics, harmonics, superharmonics or broadband signals emitted, using e.g, a 

Passive Cavitation Detector (PCD). It is possible to infer the existence of cavitation by 

looking at the images acquired by the imaging device associated with a FUS system, since 

bright spots occurred because of a greater amount of reflected energy. Cavitation can be 

quantified in terms of number of events, or by the amount of released energy (in mV) - 

see figure 1.2.

HIFU transducer, within which thermal damage is expected to occur. Pre-focal peaks are due to pre-focal 
heating in the different tissue layers. In (b), the peak represents, f0, the frequency of the monochromatic wave 
generated by the transducer. As this wave travels through a nonlinear medium, superharmonics leakage occurs 
(c) and the energy of these harmonics is rapidly absorbed and converted to heat. Finally, (c) the detection of 
cavitation results in broadband noise emissions that are readily absorbed and converted into heat (ter Haar, 
G., 2007).

  Cellular interaction mechanisms on therapies 
using Focused Ultrasound 

 

 There is a lack of knowledge about the cellular and molecular biological effects 

of Focused Ultrasound exposures. The cellular and molecular biology of tissues can be 

dramatically altered by mechanical force and stress. As the use of FUS increases in 

clinical applications, there is a need for a better understanding of the cellular and 

molecular consequences of depositing this form of energy in tissues, and of how to 

harness this non-invasive technique for novel therapies.   

 FUS is generally considered to be noninvasive, Some studies have provided some 

insight into the mechanism of action of FUS at sub-cellular and molecular levels. Two 

types of mechanisms of action are involved in FUS: thermal and mechanical in origin – 

as discussed previously in section 1.4.   

 At high intensities, coagulative necrosis is the main mechanism for cell death but 

others, such as apoptosis or cell lysis, may also take place [38]. When there is cell death, 

one particularly interesting effect is the increase in the systemic immune response due to 

exposure by ultrasound. A response to this inflammatory process can result in the increase 

of CD3+ and CD4+ cells – the denditric cells responsible for a systemic immune response 

[39].  

 In contrast to HIFU, where the biological outcome is typically instant cell death, 

low-intensity ultrasound may induce numerous short- and long-term outcomes that may 

be suppressive or proliferative depending on the acoustic exposure parameters [38, 40]. 

Temporary membrane poration may readily be achieved at low intensities (often refered 

to as sonoporation), and it has been tipped as an emerging paradigm for drug/gene 

delivery.  

 In particular, sonoporated cells have been found to exhibit membrane shrinkage 

and intracellular lipid accumulation. Also, compared to normal cells, their DNA synthesis 

kinetics were found to be significantly slowed, and the onset of cell-cycle arrest was 

evident. In some instances, programmed cell death (i.e. apoptosis) may even take place. 

This highlights the need to refine and optimize sonoporation for drug/gene delivery 

purposes in order to maintain cellular viability. On the other hand, this may represent a 

way of inducing cell death that is different to HIFU-based thermal ablation [40].

  State of the Art of Combined Treatments using 
Drugs/Virus and Focused Ultrasound 

 

 Viral agents replicate and induce cell death through mechanisms other than 

apoptosis, e.g. by eliminating cancer stem cells or by being engineered to carry a wide 

variety of transgenes which induce cell death in a number of different ways. These vectors 

may be used safely with other treatment modalities and have a synergistic anti-cancer 

effect which can also be achieved through specific immunological reactions [41]. They 

can increase the potency of multi-modality treatment regimes in an amplified site-specific 

manner which can induce additional specific anti-tumour effects, and thus have the 

potential to target metastases through immunological strategies [41]. 

 There have been several approaches to gene or viral ultrasound-facilitated therapy 

over the last few decades, as the mechanism by which ultrasound enhances gene delivery 

is still not completely understood. Experiments on the effects of ultrasound on in vitro 

gene delivery have been extensively used to determine optimal conditions for use when 

exposing in vivo. Some of the studies in this field, published over the last ten years, are 

described below. 

 Focused Ultrasound is attractive because of its potential in non-invasive surgery 

to provide tumor thermal ablation selectively in the focal volume, leaving surrounding 

healthy tissue unharmed.  The whole process can be guided using ultrasound or magnetic 

resonance imaging. Non-thermal effects such as acoustic cavitation must also be 

considered when talking about focused ultrasound therapy. Lithotripsy was one of the 

first applications of focused ultrasound to be considered. Here, shock waves are used to 

break kidney stones into fragments which the body is able to expel through the urinary 

tract [42]. In lithotripsy treatment, cavitation is thought to be the explanation for the side 

effects, such as haemorrhage, seen in soft tissue. The cavitation threshold has been 

estimated to be in the range of 1.5 to 3.5 MPa when treating human tissue with 0.2 MHz 

pulsed ultrasound [43]. Cavitation thresholds are thought to be higher in vivo because 

tissues and blood circulation in the path traveled by the ultrasound beam cause increased 

sound absorption or scattering [44]. Ways of enhancing cavitation in vivo [45] and in vitro 

[46] by introducing gas bubbles have been studied, and have led to the identification of 

the process of sonoporation which, when combined with shock wave ablation of tumors 

has resulted in DNA transfer [45, 47-49]. However, the use of lithotripsy to achieve DNA

45 

transfer proved to be unsafe due to the potential for enhanced metastasis of malignant 

tumors. Lithotripter shockwaves can enhance metastasis from tumors, and this effect is 

attributable to the cavitation mechanism [50, 51]. 

 The drawbacks of lithotripsy for cancer therapy needed overcoming, and so FUS 

started to be considered as a less harmful technique, which has the same objectives, since 

it provides a means of easily adjusting parameters to promote either thermal or non-

thermal effects. These parameters include transducer frequency, exposure duration, pulse 

length, peak negative pressures in the focal volume, duty cycle and pulse repetition 

frequency. Huber and Pfisterer [34] used focused ultrasound to perform experiments on 

in vivo transfection with plasmid DNA at 1 MPa pressure amplitude. The authors found 

no evidence of increased incidence of metastasis. 

 A study by Miller and Song [52] was designed to investigate the potential for 

simultaneous gene transfer and tumor ablation with cavitation-enhanced FUS using a 

1.55MHz transducer and US image guidance to treat mouse renal carcinoma tumors in 

the presence of microbubbles. Tumors were exposed for up to 0.4 seconds using a range 

of Peak Rarefactional Pressure Amplitudes (PRPA) of 2MPa to 8MPa. Tests were 

performed to assess the influence of the microbubble injection route, burst duration and 

pressure amplitude by reducing exposure duration and using multiple pulses. Evaluated 

both in terms of the subsequent tumor growth and gene transfer, the expression of marker 

plasmids injected into the tumors indicated that tumor growth reduction and gene transfer 

can be achieved with cavitation-enhanced FUS treatment, and that gene transfer tended 

to decrease with increasing exposure duration, or PRPA. The decrease in gene transfer 

might be due to a decrease in cell viability, (the ability of cells to maintain or recover 

viability), which was not investigated.  The way by which cavitation enhanced gene 

delivery is still not clear. 

 Challenged to get closer to an ideal vector system, thus allowing an efficient and 

safer transfection of virus into a target tissue, Meier-Humbert et al. [53] based their 

research on the assumption that DNA is transferred into cells across the plasma membrane 

via ultrasound-induced pores. The authors tried to figure out the size of the pores created 

by ultrasound application and the duration of pore opening. A 2.25 MHz focused 

ultrasound transducer operating at 570kPa was used to expose rat mammary carcinoma 

cells. Good DNA transfection on cells was achieved with a 10s exposure, duty cycle of 

20% and Pulse Repetition Frequency of 100Hz with cell viability assays showing more

46 

than 70% cell survival. The experimental conditions used gave results which showed that 

macromolecules of up to 37 nm were delivered into cells; pores at least as large as 75 nm 

were formed with the opening lasting milliseconds to seconds. 

 The in vitro studies of Rahim et al. [54, 55] investigated individual exposure 

parameters using a system designed to minimise experimental artefacts, and to allow the 

control of many parameters of the US field. They evaluated the targeting ability and 

spatial distribution of gene delivery using focused ultrasound by performing dosimetry in 

the focal plane and in the homogeneous near-field. To study the influence of physical 

parameters [55], a 1MHz-transducer was used and a sinusoidal pulse was generated with 

amplifier input amplitude up to 100 mV, pulse length up to 80 cycles, pulse repetition 

frequency up to 2.5 kHz, duration of exposure up to 60s and microbubble concentration 

varying from 0 to 16% by volume. Both cell viability and gene delivery were tested, and 

the authors concluded that the optimal conditions for gene delivery with minimal impact 

on cell viability were 0.25 MPa peak negative pressure at focus, PRF 1 kHz, 10s exposure, 

40 cycle pulse length and 4% microbubble concentration. In terms of spatial and acoustic 

pressure dependence [54] exposures were performed at optimal conditions in terms of 

PRF, exposure time, pulse length and microbubble concentration, in a range of amplitudes 

from 0.35 to 1.4 MPa peak to peak pressure at the focus.  

 Analysis of gene delivery, cell viability and spatial distribution showed that 

delivery in the focal plane was concentrated around the ultrasound beam axis and that 

transfection efficiency increased as acoustic pressure increased towards the focus, 

reaching a maximum above 1 MPa. Delivery was microbubble dependent, and the cell 

viability was about 80% for the higher spatial average peak to peak pressure (0.88 MPa). 

Based on these results and exposure conditions, and with the aim of evaluating the 

potential for ultrasound/microbubble-mediated retroviral gene delivery, Taylor et al. [56] 

achieved good transfection results at peak-negative acoustic pressure amplitudes of 1.0 

to 1.2 MPa (60 to 80 mV) using an exposure time of 5s and the pulse length of ten cycles 

per pulse. 

 Other in vitro studies have looked at the effect of ultrasound on viral content 

transfection and have been undertaken since, for the success of oncolytic virotherapy of 

solid tumors, it is the efficiency of infection that is important [57, 58]. Clinical trials have 

also been carried out using many viral vectors [59-62] to evaluate the factors that can 

affect infection since solid tumors contain a heterogeneous mixture of tumor and healthy

cells within an extracellular matrix supported by a tortuous vascular network [63]. Leaky 

vasculature and variable blood flow in tumors, lead to poor delivery of nutrients and 

impaired clearance of metabolic breakdown products from the tumor [64], and also make 

drug delivery difficult, because of the limited blood supply compared to normally 

vascularized tissues. Many solid tumors develop regions of hypoxia, which may lead to 

up-regulation of genes that predispose subjects to a more malignant phenotype [65, 66]. 

 A different approach has addressed the question of which transduction route, i.e. 

the path by which DNA is introduced into another cell via a viral vector, would be best 

for plasmid and adenoviral delivery [67]. In their study, Agrawal et al., tested topical, 

intraflap and in vivo intravascular gene delivery using rat Superficial Inferior Epigastric 

(SIE) flaps. The extent of viral transduction through SIE flaps and its duration was 

assessed by non-invasive imaging of luciferase. Intravascular transduced flaps yielded 

the most even distribution of virus but the presence of microbubbles did not result in a 

higher expression of viral vector. Exposure conditions were fixed as follows: frequency 

1MHz, exposure duration 30s, duty cycle approximately 66.7%, PRF of 1 kHz, each pulse 

consisting of 40 cycles of pressure amplitude 1.4 MPa (peak to peak) at the transducer 

focus. 

 Eisenberg et al. [68] completed a study relating hyperthermia and viral killing of 

pancreatic cancer through a heat shock protein pathway, in which a recombinant Herpes 

Simplex virus (NV1066) was cultured with pancreatic cancer cells (Hs700). Cell survival 

and viral growth proved that heating the virus NV1066 with the cell line Hs700 up to 

42 ?C, for 4 hours, increased cell destruction by 80%. Increased viral efficacy was due to 

the presence of a protein (Heat-shock protein 72, Hsp72) which is regulated by thermal 

stimuli and lends cellular protection by inhibiting apoptosis. This protein helps to increase 

viral replication and tumor cell destruction. 

 Quantification of drug distribution is important in order to determine the ability 

of a drug to penetrate tissue within solid tumors. Both in vitro and in vivo techniques have 

been used for quantifying drug distribution. In vitro studies involving cell culture are a 

good way of obtaining optimal parameters for virus infection. Another in vitro study 

involving virus was performed by Shintani et al. [57] using Herpes Simplex virus to infect 

a mixed solution of normal and malignant cells. The effect of ultrasound and 

microbubbles was tested in experiments on different groups (Virus infection only, virus 

infection and microbubbles/ultrasound, and then virus infection with both ultrasound and

microbubbles) in which exposure conditions with a 1 MHz ultrasound transducer were 

varied in terms of ultrasound intensity (up to 2 W/cm2), duty cycle (up to 50%) and 

exposure time (up to 40s). This study gave optimal conditions in terms of maintenance of 

cell viability (0.5 W/cm2; 20% duty cycle and 10 s exposure) and showed a decrease of 

around 40% in cell viability for the extreme conditions tested, with exposure time being 

the parameter that most affected cell survival and transfection. 

 In vitro cell exposure is not the most effective way of obtaining the conditions that 

will be valid for in vivo exposures. In in vitro cell exposures there is no absorbing 

medium, and the shear stresses created by microstreaming in a fluid cause cell movement 

inside a solution. Bazan-Peregrino et al. [58] developed an in vitro model using a porous 

gel in a two-sided cylindrical container with acoustically transparent windows, and used 

a metal rod to create a flow-through vessel of diameter 1.6 mm. The attenuation of this 

gel was approximately that of water.  

 The studies presented so far in this document, show a lack of cavitation control 

which seems to be crucial for understanding transfection of particles into a cell by 

ultrasound and microbubbles. In Bazan-Peregrino et al. [58], cavitation is accounted for 

and ultrasonic pressures were chosen to maximize either broadband emissions, associated 

with inertial cavitation, or ultraharmonic emissions, associated with stable cavitation, 

while varying duty cycle to keep the total acoustic energy delivered constant, in order to 

allow comparison across exposures. A Passive Cavitation Detector (PCD) consisting of a 

15 MHz spherically focused Piezoelectric Transducer (PZT), was coaxially and 

confocally aligned with a 0.5 MHz FUS transducer. The raw signal from the PZT 

transducer was amplified 25-fold, high pass filtered at 1 MHz (to reject reflections from 

the drive frequency), and data was recorded at a sampling rate of 20 MHz with an 8-bit 

digitizer. The optimal acoustic parameters were those used by Arvanitis et al [69] – the 

acoustic parameters in this study were specific to inducing inertial and stable cavitation. 

In the presence of ultrasound and microbubbles, a peak rarefactional focal pressure 

(PRFP) of 360 kPa, a duty cycle of 90% and a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 10 Hz 

were chosen to achieve stable cavitation. Conversely, PRFPs of 1250 kPa or 2400 kPa 

and duty cycle of 6% and 2%, respectively, were used with a PRF of 10 Hz to achieve 

inertial cavitation. For ultrasound only exposures, as stable cavitation could not be 

sustained, inertial cavitation was applied with a PRFP of 2400 kPa, 2% duty cycle and 

PRF of 10 Hz. All the exposures were set to 5 minutes and temperature was monitored

49 

using a T-type fine-needle thermocouple at the FUS focus (the rise never exceeded 0.2 ?C 

so no biologically significant US induced heating occurred). Luciferase activity indicated 

successful infection to exposures involving both ultrasound and microbubbles, and, in 

terms of cell viability, the best results, in terms of the percentage of viable cells after 

exposure, were achieved with a PRFP of 1250 kPa and 6.5% duty cycle. 

 A more recent publication by Bazan-Peregrino et al. [70] tried to identify the key 

parameters needed to optimize the combined use of oncolytic adenoviruses (OA) and 

focused ultrasound. This optimization relies on the principle that ultrasound exposure 

parameters may be optimized as a function of tumor reperfusion time to sustain inertial 

cavitation throughout the exposure. Exposure conditions, in terms of PRFP and duty 

cycle, similar to their previous study were maintained [58], and PRF and exposure 

duration were changed to 0.5 Hz and 4 minutes, respectively. Intratumoral and 

intravenous injection protocols were applied using a modified adenovirus to express 

luciferase. Passive cavitation detection of acoustic emissions, during the in vivo treatment, 

indicated inertial cavitation as the mechanism responsible for enhanced delivery and 

enabled real-time monitoring of successful viral therapy. 3-fold, 12-fold and 50-fold 

increases in uptake have been found in 50, 30 and 20% of the tumors under inertial 

cavitation inducing conditions.  

 Another in vivo approach to the field of virotherapy was undertaken by Carlisle et 

al. [71] who considered that almost all the publications with solid conclusions are based 

on intratumoral release of virus [6] and assume that the limitations of the technique are 

due to poor intravenous delivery. Of particular interest is the fact that systemic deliveries 

of treatments for metastatic cancer still require improved circulation kinetics, 

extravasation from the blood-stream into the tumor, and intratumoral penetration. 

 Additionally the intratumoral distribution of viral content remains exclusively 

perivascular, without deep penetration into the tumor [72]. As a result, the therapeutic 

effect is restricted to a small proportion of a tumor’s mass. The factors described led to 

research on the development of a virus coating polymer that enhances circulation and also 

allows triggered uncoating and reactivation of Adenoviruses within tumors. The 

exposures, again, were based on the findings of Bazan-Peregrino et al. [70] – they used a 

0.5 MHz transducer at peak rarefactional pressure of 1.2 MPa at PRF of 0.5 Hz but this 

time the intention was to produce inertial cavitation monitored in real-time. The 

remaining exposure parameters were 100 ms pulse length, and 240 s exposure time. A

30-fold enhancement in tumor infection was obtained when exposing polymer coated 

adenovirus in the presence of microbubbles. 

 The last study to be discussed here, and one of the more recent ones, is that of 

Graham et al. [73] and addresses the same problem as that in the previously discussed 

study – namely that the clinical efficiency of stable liposomal delivery still has poor 

penetration into non-vascularised tumor regions and poor release of payload within the 

tumor. These liposomes are used to deliver powerful chemotherapeutics, which can cause 

severe adverse effects in non-target tissues. Although the liposomal delivery is thought 

to be more stable, an improved formulation is desired during the intravenous delivery 

phase, following arrival within the tumor, so that the drug in its free form can provide 

greater and more widespread effects in tissues [73]. Here, the importance of ultrasound is 

addressed - inertial cavitation can be used to trigger intratumoral release of drug from 

intravenously delivered liposomes non-invasively, and, simultaneously, inertial 

cavitation can be monitored through resulting acoustic emissions.  

 Graham et al. [73] used a 0.5 MHz focused ultrasound transducer, and cavitation 

detection has been achieved using a 7.5 MHz passive cavitation detector, which was 

placed in the centre of the transducer, and both were confocally and coaxially aligned. 

This study includes in vitro and in vivo experiments and for the former, exposure 

conditions varied in terms of peak rarefactional focal pressures (from 0.14 to 1.5 MPa) 

with fixed pulse length of 100 ms, 5% duty cycle and 30s exposure duration. Temperature 

was recorded using a thermocouple placed within the phantom. In terms of in vivo 

experiments for Graham et al. study, conditions were chosen on the basis of the work by 

Bazan-Peregrino et al. [70] (1.2 MPa of PRFP, 6% duty cycle and 0.5Hz PRF) but with 

some changes – total exposure time was 12 minutes and after every 90 seconds of 

exposure microbubbles were injected, with the focal volume being repositioned every 3 

minutes. Despite the variability in intratumoral inertial cavitation levels and location, 

sufficient events associated with luciferin content occurred to instigate substantial and 

highly significant increases in payload release. The study of Graham’s group is the first 

demonstration that such clinically applicable US parameters can be used to improve 

intratumoral payload release from an intravenously injected liposomal delivery agent. 

 The combination of ultrasound and virus seems to be a potentially useful tool for 

improving cancer treatment efficacy. The application of ultrasound can directly change 

the structure or physiology of tissues, or can induce changes in a drug or vehicle in order

51 

to enhance payload delivery. Uptake of virus has been proven to be increased by 

ultrasound but a lot of work is still required to make this combined therapy clinically safe. 

As presented by Bourke et al. [41], there are some features that turn a viral vector into an 

“ideal virotherapy agent”. These are i) a specificity to cancer cells and consequent tumour 

destruction, ii) the capacity for replication within neoplastic cells (which, in the best case, 

can be exclusive to these cells), iii) an ability to cause only mild, self-limited or no human 

disease, iv) the possibility of control and elimination of remaining viral particles after 

treatment, v) to be genetically stable; and, finally, vi) to show zero recombination events 

while in use.  

 For the purpose of this thesis, a pilot project on a combined treatment using 

Focused Ultrasound, Vaccinia Virus, Melphalan and TNF-? in the presence of 

microbubbles is expected to contribute to advances to cancer therapies. This project starts 

with the equipment preparation and the calibration necessary to know accurately the 

outputs of the equipment used and determination of the best equipment to use, then in 

vitro experiments used to help “pre-vizualise” the effects that one will get in vivo and 

finally, in vivo experiments that allow the testing of whether Focused Ultrasound in the 

presence of microbubbles enhances the activity of oncolytic virotherapy delivered during 

Isolated Limb Perfusion.  Several mechanisms, including direct anti-tumour activity, 

enhancement of the activity of melphalan/TNF-alpha and increased intratumoural 

delivery of oncolytic viruses were considered.

2. Calibration of a Focused Ultrasound 
Transducer and Measurement of 

Cavitation Thresholds under Different 

Frequencies 
 

 

 2.1. Transducers Calibration  
 

 

2.1.1. Introduction 

 

 The ultrasound beam generated by a plane transducer propagates as a longitudinal 

wave in soft tissue and has two distinct regions: near field (Fresnel zone) and far field 

(Fraunhofer zone). A focused ultrasound transducer produces a cylindrical beam that is 

narrowest in the focal zone, some distance from the transducer face. This US beam has 

side lobes due to diffraction. For therapeutic medical applications of ultrasound, beams 

with little lateral dispersion of energy are usually preferred and so the ultrasound beam is 

often focused. 

 There is a wide variety of FUS transducers, reported in literature and in clinical 

use, both in terms of geometry and drive frequency (fairly limited for FUS to the range 

of 0.5 to 4 MHz). It is important to design the transducer for its use and the following 

issues must be considered [74]: 

 

1. The location, accessibility and size of the target. 

2. The ability to deliver sufficient power to the required treatment depth, in order to 

provide an effective treatment. This influenced by the focal length and outer 

diameter of the transducer which determine the total power producing area and 

the focusing strength, and the frequency used which affects how much energy is 

absorbed at the target and lost in the overlying tissues. Lower frequencies are 

associated with lower attenuation losses in the overlying path and higher 

frequencies are favourable for greater absorption at the focus. 

3. The size of the transducers matters when the available range of motion of the 

transducer is crucial for a specific application.

4. There must be a coupling medium between the transducer and the target and this 

is usually achieved with water baths in which either the transducer and the target 

are submerged, or one water bag is placed in between the transducer and the target. 

5. If diagnostic ultrasound imaging guidance is necessary, the ultrasound transducer 

can be designed to incorporate an ultrasound imaging probe, preferably at its 

centre, enabling imaging along the therapy beam axis. 

 In terms of the properties of the ultrasound beam, some concepts are key to the 

need for calibration of the acoustic field of ultrasound beams. In any application, the 

intensity in the FUS beam must be known and one must not forget that [74]: 

? In the focal plane, the power is not entirely contained within the focal 

region, with some power being in side-lobe rings around the focal region.  

These are of lower intensity than the focus, and normally are of little 

consequence in clinical treatments using short exposures. 

? In the pre-focal beam the maximum intensity generally increases moving 

towards the focal plane; however, the intensity distribution is not 

homogeneous and there are localised regions of high and low intensity. 

 A quantitative characterization of the acoustic field of a FUS transducer can be 

made using a hydrophone - a device which provides a localised measure of the acoustic 

pressure. This quantitative characterization can include studies on the spatial variation 

(with beamplots) and/or variation of peak pressure(s) by changing the drive setting. 

Measurements are usually performed in degassed water, in which the ultrasound beam 

propagates through a non-attenuating medium, in the absence of scattering structures and 

cavitation nuclei.  

 The choice of hydrophone is dependent on a number of factors, the main 

considerations being: robustness, the measurement environment (e.g. degassed water, 

deionized water, coupling gel), sensor size, temporal stability, and flatness of the 

frequency response. In terms of the sensor size, both the size of the sensitive area and the 

size of the whole sensor because the first determines beamplot resolution and the other 

may affect whether the sensor fits into a system at all. Robustness is a critical factor in 

HIFU characterisation, since the hydrophone sensor is likely to be exposed to large peak 

negative pressures, and there is thus an associated risk of hydrophone damage from 

acoustic cavitation at its front face [74].

 For this study, in order to minimise the risk of hydrophone damage, the water used 

for coupling medium is very well degassed (ideally less than 2 mg/l of dissolved oxygen), 

the water is also filtered to remove particles bigger than 5 microns, so that there are fewer 

cavitation nucleation surfaces available and (iii) short pulses of ~40 cycles are used so 

that we reach peak pressure, but reduce the number of cycles and therefore risk of 

cavitation. 

Hydrophones, like ultrasound sources, are usually piezoelectric materials (they 

convert sound pressure to a voltage and vice versa). If a hydrophone is placed in an 

acoustic pressure field it produces an electrical output signal in response to the surface 

integral of the acoustic pressure received over its active element. Hydrophone calibration 

provides a value for the sensitivity of the hydrophone (expressed in mV/Pa) as a function 

of frequency.  

For a waveform propagating linearly, the voltage values measured on an 

oscilloscope, V(t), can be converted to pressure, p(t), using the hydrophone sensitivity, 

s(f) using the relationship

 To decide on the best transducer to use in the present study, two transducers were 

calibrated in terms of acoustic power measurements, at different frequencies – one at 1.08 

MHz and 1.34 MHz, and a second at 1.66 MHz. The transducers and methods are 

described in the next section. 

 

2.1.2. Methods to Transducers Calibration 

 

 The calibration was performed using an automated beam plotting system 

(Ultrasonic Measurement System (UMS), Precision Acoustics, UK) – see figure 2.1. The 

ultrasonic measurement system is controlled by the Host PC by means of dedicated 

LabVIEWTM based software. This application controls all aspects of the operation of the 

system including: 

? Communication with a LeCroy 64xi digital oscilloscope for acquistion of 

averaged waveforms  

? Positioning in 3 orthogonal directions, via actuation of the stepper motors  

? Waveform acquisition by the oscilloscope and subsequent transfer of data to the 

host computer  

? Archival and post-processing of acquired data.

 Calibration was used to find which function generator drive levels (in mV) gave 

free-field peak negative pressures from 0.3 to 1.8 MPa in increments of 0.3 MPa, knowing 

that the sensitivity of the hydrophone HGL-0200 (ONDA, USA) was approximately 45 

nV/Pa for the frequencies used. The range of peak negative pressures used was based on 

previous publications on the subject of enhanced uptake of virus with the use of focused 

ultrasound. 

 A synchronisation signal was taken from a signal generator (the Function 

Generator in Figure 2.1) and used to trigger the oscilloscope. The FUS transducer was 

held in a fixed position perpendicular to the hydrophone, with both beam axes aligned 

parallel to each other, and was at first centred by visual inspection. The focus was then 

located by finding the maximum amplitude signal on the oscilloscope, while moving the 

gantry manually, being careful to ensure that the peak that had been found was not a side 

lobe. 

 After finding the focal peak position using spatial increments of 0.5 mm, relatively 

coarse one-dimensional scans were set up to record the pressure distribution along x, y 

and z, - see Figure 2.2 - to check the symmetry of the profile. The peak positive and peak 

negative voltages were measured at each position from a waveform averaged 100 times. 



_______________________________________________________________________ 
 

_______________________________________________________________________ 
56 

The root mean square voltage was calculated in Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc.), then 

converted to the root mean square pressure – see equation 3. 

 Pressure measurements were performed at the focal peak of the FUS field over a 

range of signal generator voltage settings at the three different frequencies (for the two 

different transducers) and at increments of 0.25 mm, over a distance of 4 mm around the 

focus in two directions, X and Y. The water inside the UMS tank was filtered and 

degassed to reduce the dissolved oxygen level (&lt;2mg/l) to decrease the possibility of 

cavitation and UV light exposed to keep it clean. 

 The series of files, each of which contained the voltage waveform acquired from 

the hydrophone at each measurement location, was post-processed using Matlab code 

designed for the purpose (although UMS software could have been used). Linear scans 

of the pressure (in MPa) as a function of the distance from the focus (in mm) at each drive 

level were produced at the three different frequencies and then Pressure (in MPa) was 

plotted as a function of the Drive Level (in mV).  Peak negative pressure values will be 

considered for further applications because inertial cavitation is more likely to happen 

due to the growth of a bubble during one cycle of tension (during the negative phase of 

acoustic cycle). 

 In the next section, transducer calibration results are shown for measurements at 

1.08 MHz only, since similar results were found at the other two frequencies. The main 

difference is that the focus is narrower at higher frequencies. The focal dimension at 1.08 

MHz is (considering a planar oval shaped figure) ~13 mm height and ~1.79 mm width, at 

1.34 MHz, it is about ~13 mm height and and ~1.42 mm width and at 1.66 MHz it is ~10 

mm height and 1.21 mm width. 

 In terms of the error of the experiments, the National Physics Laboratory (NPL) 

which is the UK's National Measurement Institute - a world-leading centre of excellence 

in developing and applying the most accurate measurement standards, science and 

technology - specifies the error of the hydrophone detection to 7% of the measured value. 

However, a value an error of 10% of in each measurement was considered to avoid any 

underestimation. This applies throughout the experiments in this dissertation.

2.2. Measurement of Cavitation Thresholds 
 

 

2.2.1. Brief Review on Cavitation Thresholds Measurement 

 

 One of the first approaches to cavitation detection was reported in the early 90s.  

Huber et al. [75] built a hydrophone based on the system designed by Staudenraus and 

Eisenmenger [76] which detects changes in refractive index in the surrounding medium 

arising from pressure changes. This device was compared with membrane and needle 

hydrophones in terms of its pressure sensitivity, but no attempt was made to quantify the 

detected cavitation.  

 More recently, Koch and Jenderka [77] used a Fiber Optic Hydrophone (FOH) 

system based on a heterodyne interferometer to measure bubble activity in an ultrasonic 

cleaning bath filled with deionised, degassed water. The FOH was used to measure both 

the incident acoustic pressure and half harmonic and broadband bubble emission signals, 

simultaneously. Comparisons of the measured fundamental half harmonic and broadband 

“cavitation noise power” between 1-1.25 MHz were then made. These studies provided 

information regarding environments where cavitation is expected to occur, but have not 

addressed the lower limit of detection of cavitation signals at pressures close to the 

cavitation onset threshold, which is important for FUS applications. 

 A number of definitions of cavitation thresholds exist in the literature. Studies 

have used visual detection to determine a threshold pressure for either the appearance of 

cavitation bubbles coming out of solution [78] or the onset of oscillation and/or collapse 

of pre-existing microbubbles [79]. Typically, during biological studies, the amount of 

cavitation is quantified using a method considered appropriate for the application, and 

from these data a relevant pressure threshold can be defined if necessary. A number of 

studies have chosen to use a “cavitation dose” type measurement which measures the total 

amount of a “cavitation signal” received over a given time [80-82] but in these studies 

specific pressure thresholds have not been defined. Chen et al. [83]  used summation of 

voltage signals over a frequency range below the FUS drive frequency as “cavitation 

dose”. 

 Kyriakou et al. [84] measured broadband activity within adipose tissue exposed 

to HIFU at different frequencies. They used the variance of voltage signals detected using 

a 15 MHz centre frequency PCD, over a range of 5-20 MHz, after high-pass filtering at 5 

MHz to exclude the HIFU drive frequency and the first 3 harmonics. Higher harmonic 



_______________________________________________________________________ 
 

_______________________________________________________________________ 
62 

frequencies were also excluded from the broadband range, but comb filtering the data in 

softwar. Variance values were used to quantify inertial cavitation. The threshold for 

detection of inertial cavitation was defined as the minimum negative pressure at which 

any signal greater than 6 standard deviations above noise occurred.  

 Inertial cavitation thresholds have been measured in a range of tissues and 

phantom materials by Maxwell et al. [85] for two-cycle HIFU pulses. To account for the 

many harmonics present in the drive signal, the presence of cavitation was determined by 

measuring the deviation of an integrated power spectrum from expected values, 

calculated from field measurements in the absence of cavitation. Thresholds were defined 

at the 50% probability level for which the measured integrated power was greater than 5 

standard deviations above the expected value. 

 

 

2.2.2. Methods of Cavitation Thresholds 

 

 For any FUS exposure the following are needed: a timer, a signal generator, an 

amplifier, a pick-off box for measuring drive voltage and current, a scope to read the 

voltage and current and a FUS transducer and an impedance matching box. As cavitation 

detection was required, a PCD, filters, pre-amplifiers and a data acquisition system were 

also used. The equipment used was as follows: 

 

? Timer Box Ultrasound Timer 2.0 (built in house) 

? Signal generator Agilent 33120A (Agilent Technologies, Singapore) 

? Power Amplifier E&amp;amp;I A300 (Electronics &amp;amp; Innovation, Florida) 

? Pick-off box built in house (to measure V/1000 and I*10) 

? Oscilloscope LeCroy Waverunner 64Xi (LeCroy Corporation, New York) 

? FUS transducer working at 1.66 MHz(Sonic Concepts, Washington) 

? Matching Box (Sonic Concepts, Washington)    

? Passive Cavitation Detector (PCD) 

? Notch Filter (1.7 MHz) built in house 

? Pre-amplifier (Model 7866, Advanced Receiver Research, Burlington, CT, USA) 

? Desktop Computer as Data Acquisition System (Supermicro, United States) 

? acoustic 15 well plates  and well plate holder designed &amp;amp; built in house

? Gantry (Time and Precision, Hampshire, UK) and in house built Motion 

Controller 

? Aluminium arm  

? Control Computer Latitude E6510 (Dell Inc., United States)  

? Perspex Water Tank 

? Fibre-optic hydrophone PAFOH10 (Precision Acoustics, Dorchester, UK) and 

purpose built fibre-optic hydrophone holder 

  

 Exposures of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) cell culture medium 

were made in acoustic well-plates developed in-house (see figure 2.9). These have a 

permanent, but replaceable, lower acoustically transparent window (19 micron thick 

Melinex) and are designed to be filled with the sample before an upper membrane is 

clamped into place (being careful to avoid trapping bubbles in any of the wells). 

 

Figure 2.9. Schematic of well-plate built in house (left) and photograph (right). The volume of each well was 
approximately 0.5ml. The diameter is just under 7 mm wide which meant that if the 1.66 MHZ transducer was used 
the beam should just clear the sides of the well when the focal peak is placed in the middle of the well (in 3D). 

 

 In order to target each well on the well plate, a “small” radiotherapy platform (see 

Figure 2.10) and its motion controller (not shown) were used and controlled using Matlab 

code developed in-house. The radiotherapy platform allows precise control of positions 

in 3 orthogonal directions under remote computer control and in-house built software 

allow the movement between each well after localising on one of the corner wells.

Figure 2.10. Radiotherapy Platform used to move the ultrasound transducer automatically and precisely from well to 
well. 

 The targeting process did not require imaging guidance, but did require good 

accuracy. This setup allows the placement of a 10 mm long by 1.0 mm diameter focal 

region in the centre of a 7 mm diameter, 7 mm long well using a specially built fibre-

optic hydrophone holder designed to locate the centre of the well when filled with 

degassed water and have no upper acoustic window. It should be noted that with cells in 

medium or in medium only, it is very likely that acoustic cavitation will occur at much 

lower pressures than in tissue and that the radiation force associated with the ultrasonic 

pressure wave will vigorously stir the solution due to acoustic streaming. Both of these 

produce artefact effects. The setup for exposures in vitro is shown in Figure 2.11. 

 

 

Figure 2.11. Example for setup to exposures in vitro (the tank is filled with degassed water prior to any exposure). The 
well-plate holder is holding a standard 96 well plate, which could not be used for US exposures because the thick 
perspex was not acoustically transparent and the plate could not be totally submerged. This means that there would 
be almost complete reflection of the ultrasound beam at the liquid air interface in each well and so, ultrasound 
exposure levels could not be accurately measured. 

 

 A PCD was used to detect any ultrasonic signals emitted by cavitating bubbles.  

In these experiments, the drive frequencies were 1.08, 1.34 and 1.66 MHz and broadband

65 

signals in the range of 3-10 MHz were recorded.  This range was chosen because apart 

from the primary resonance, a number of superharmonic resonances, usually of the 

fundamental and the half harmonic, can take place, for frequencies of excitation being 

below the natural frequency of the PCD which is 15 MHz. Adding to this, the highest 

contribution, when an effect is present in cavitation detection data, comes from lower 

frequencies. However, if lower frequencies are included in the analysis, there are potential 

complications from widening fundamental and second harmonics, which seem to be less 

problematic from the 3rd harmonic on – this is based on previous experiments on 

cavitation detection in the ICR’s Therapeutic Ultrasound Team. The signal from the PCD 

is passed through a notch filter centred at 1.7 MHz (Allen Avionics Inc., NY, USA), 

which reduces the component of the signal at the fundamental frequency (f0) of the HIFU 

drive field by ~80 dB. This is done in order to avoid saturating the digitising electronics 

and preventing detection of the lower amplitude broadband and harmonic signals. Then, 

the signal goes through a 20 dB preamplifier (Advanced Receiver Research, Burlington, 

CT, USA).  

 A data acquisition computer (DataQuest Solutions, Bedfordshire, UK), with two 

500 GB SATA hard drive and 12 GB RAM, allows the storage and processing of large 

quantities of PCD data in real time. A built-in 12-bit high speed Peripheral Component 

Interconnect (PCI) data acquisition (DAQ) card (Spectrum Systementwicklung 

Microelectronic, Germany) with 256 MB on-board memory allows digitization and 

storage of data from up to 4 channels at a maximum of 50 MHz sampling rates, in First 

In First Out (FIFO) mode. This is important because, from the Nyquist limit this means 

that the highest frequency that can be reliably detected is 25 MHz. Which is much higher 

than the top of our broadband range of interest (10 MHz). A 2 step buffer strategy is used, 

whereby the on-board memory of the acquisition card is used as a hardware buffer, and a 

specific portion of the computer memory is set aside as an additional software data buffer. 

Data is transfered from the on-board memory of the acquisition card to the computer 

memory in small blocks via the dual buses of the PC. Both the block size and the software 

buffer size can be user defined. 

 The DAQ card is controlled by a 2-stage process. First, a code written in-house 

allows specification of the number of channels to be used, the desired sampling frequency, 

the input impedances from the devices connected to each channel, and the total amount 

of time for which data should be acquired. For the purpose of the studies presented in this 

thesis, continuous data acquisition was required for the duration of each exposure 



_______________________________________________________________________ 
 

_______________________________________________________________________ 
66 

(typically 0.5 s), with additional ‘off-time’ (0.2 s) data which is used to calculate the 

baseline noise level. 

 The second stage includes a Matlab code which was written to communicate with 

the acquisition card via Matlab drivers. This is based on a series of C and Matlab functions 

provided by the DAQ card manufacturer, but was runned entirely in Matlab. The code 

first asks the user to specify a unique file identifier for the data (e.g. an exposure number). 

The dynamic range of the digitising card must be selected to determine the voltage range 

over which the available digitisation levels are assigned. For the 12-bit card, the number 

of digitization levels was 212, or 4096. It was only possible to specify values of 200, 500, 

1000, 2000 or 5000 mV. It is important to specify a suitable dynamic range for the 

expected signals. If the range specified is too high, the data would be contained within 

only a small number of digitisation levels, leading to quantisation effects. On the other 

hand, the use of a range which was too low for the detected signals would result in 

“clipping” of the peak voltages (positive and negative). This introduces discontinuities in 

the time domain, creating artefacts in the frequency domain which appear as data spikes. 

The decision to use a particular dynamic range was in the most part based on prior 

experience of the therapeutic ultrasound team, and both 1000 and 2000 mV were found 

suitable for the experiments described in this thesis. 

 Finally, the acquisition code sends the user-specified details to the acquisition 

card, and programs it to wait for an external voltage trigger. This is provided by 

connecting the synchronization port on a signal generator to a trigger channel on the data 

acquisition card. For the experiments described in this chapter, up to 2 channels were 

used, Ch0 was usually used to collect PCD data and Ch1 was used for the drive voltage. 

A sampling frequency of 33.2 MHz was used in all experiments throughout this thesis. 

Data were saved in the computer memory in segments, and stored in binary format. Upon 

subsequently reading of the files into Matlab, and with the knowledge of the dynamic 

range setting used for each exposure, the values were then converted from integers back 

into mV for processing.   

 This study of cavitation thresholds was done to i) study the difference in 

thresholds  depending on the HIFU frequency used, ii) chose the levels of pressure to use 

in in vitro exposures, iii) decide on the best frequency to use  when microbubbles were 

present (the best frequency being the one closest to the resonant frequency of the 

microbubbles ). The SonoVue microbubbles used have resonant frequencies of 1.6, 2.1 

and 3.1 MHz for bubbles of 4.0, 3.2 and 2.6 µm, respectively. According to the 



Ultrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies

_______________________________________________________________________ 
67 

manufacturer’s sheet, the  mean diameter of the microbubbles is 2.5µm, 90% are smaller 

than 6µm and 99% smaller than 11µm. 

 The results presented here are from cavitation detection at 1.08MHz, 1.34MHz 

and 1.66 MHz during exposure of DMEM only, and medium with 10 or 10% 

concentration of microbubbles. The Pulse Repetition Frequency was fixed at 100 Hz, the 

pulse length was 40 cycles and the exposure of 0.5 s.   The pressures applied at 1.08 and 

1.66 MHz varied from 0 to 1.8 MPa in increments of 0.3 MPa  but at 1.34 MHz the 

pressures varied from 0.2  to 1.2 MPa, in increments of 0.2 MPa. At the three different 

frequencies tested, one exposure was made at each drive level.  All the conditions tested 

are based on information gathered from the literature review.  

 In terms of threshold definition, the increments tested did not allow accurate 

determination of the exact  level of pressure at which inertial cavitation onset, occuring 

within the 0.5s exposure, could be detected. It was therefore defined by the interval in 

which cavitation started to occur every time, such that in the time domain analysis, on a 

logarithmic scale, a “hump” one order of magnitude higher than the noise level (in terms 

of amplitude of the detected signal, in mV) was present (unique spikes above the threshold 

line are not considered as broadband). There is not enough data available for a quantitative 

definition of the inertial cavitation threshold in DMEM and therefore an initial study was 

done to get an estimate of what it might be. 

 A more rigorous study would require closer inspection of PCD broadband off-

time noise data from several exposures. A baseline would then be defined, for example, 

from the calculation of the mean and standard deviation of the noise levels. The signal 

exceeding the defined signal baseline over a certain length of time could then be 

considered as inertial cavitation. Single data points exceeding the baseline noise level 

may occur during the FUS on-time, so it is important to consider an interval of time for 

the threshold which distinguished occasional spikes/interference from the surrounding 

environment , from real cavitation activity. 

 

Signal Processing and Analysis 

 

 The signal has been integrated over the frequency range of 3-10 MHz. Summing 

data minimizes effects of inherent phase differences between voltage and current (caused 

by impedance mismatch) such that power fluctuations reflect impedance changes caused

by bubble formation in the acoustic propagation path. Then, data was Fourier transformed 

(FFT) using a Hanning window function.  

 The level of broadband emission was obtained using a two-step process. 

Following the FFT calculation, a ‘‘comb’’ software filter was used to remove any 

harmonics (produced by nonlinear propagation) and subharmonics of the drive signal 

from the data. This filter set the amplitude of each harmonic to zero, to prevent their 

contribution to the broadband signal. Summation of amplitudes in the resultant 

discontinuous frequency band gave the ‘‘integrated broadband’’ emission amplitude over 

the entire exposure time. Thus, half harmonic and integrated broadband amplitudes, could 

be plotted as a function of time.  

 Audible emission data were processed using Matlab to extract temporal 

information by using 2048 points per FFT calculation, yielding a temporal resolution of 

9 ms. 

 

2.2.3. Results and Discussion of Cavitation Thresholds Measurement 

 

 In the next section, some graphs are presented in the time domain, in which case 

the title of each plot contains information about the exposure number (Exp), the DAQ 

channel (e.g Ch0), ‘SC’ stands for Sonic Concepts and identifies the transducer, the 

Broadband (defined as BB) frequency range shown and the HIFU drive frequency (e.g. 

1.08MHz) – see Figure 2.12. For graphs in the frequency domain, the title of each plot 

contains the exposure number (S) , the DAQ channel used (e.g. S1Ch0), time point at 

which the FFT was obtained (e.g. 0.0003323s), the drive frequency (e.g. 1.08MHz) and 

then what is being shown, e.g.  the FFT (i.e. that over 0 to 11 MHz), the HH FFT (i.e. 

Half Harmonic FFT shown over 0 to 1 MHz) – see Figure 2.15. Comb filtered versions 

of these are denoted by an additional term “comb”, and a red dashed line present in some 

plots indicates the cavitation threshold – as in Figure 2.15.

0.5 s exposure of DMEM with peak negative pressure 0 MPa. The exposure lasts 0.5 s of acquisition. No cavitation was 
detected, because no exposure was made. Therefore in this case the whole trace represents off-time noise of the entire 
PCD detection system. The graph title shows that this was exposure number one, with data acquired on Ch0 of the 
DAQ system.

Figure 2.14. PCD broadband signal (3-10 MHz)  as a function of time for a 1.08 MHz, 0.5s exposure of DMEM at a peak 
negative pressure of 1.5 MPa. The arrows show time points that were identified for analysis in the frequency domain 
because of their transiently increased amplitude above off-time noise. 

 

 In Figure 2.14, the arrows point towards data points that have significantly higher 

amplitude than the noise (Mean and SD of 0.785 ± 0.087 mV). The frequency domain 

results are shown in Figures 2.12 and 2.13. The results are inconclusive because there is 

not a big difference from the noise level and the previously defined threshold – there 

should be a bigger band of frequencies above the threshold to consider this as inertial 

cavitation. Figures 2.15 and 2.16 show there was 2nd harmonics (2.16 MHz) which the 

comb filter removed, but there are some other spikes around. This doesn’t look like a 

wide frequency broadband effect.

in DMEM with 10% concentration of microbubbles at a peak negative pressure of 0.3 MPa. The arrows show the time 
points analysed in the  frequency domain. 

 

 Figure 2.17 shows that the broadband detected by the PCD at 0.3 MPa with 

microbubbles is similar amplitude to those at 1.5 MPa without added microbubbles 

(Figure 2.14). This suggests that microbubbles significantly lower the cavitation threshold 

as should be expected.  

 More in depth frequency domain analysis of some of the data in Figure 2.17 shows 

the presence of harmonics (in Figure 2.18), and ultra-harmonics (non-integer multiples of 

the insonation frequency) between 4 and 7 MHz  (in Figure 2.19). Higher amplitude of 

harmonics and ultra-harmonics could represent non-linear propagation of the ultrasound

beam due to the oscillation of the MB . In Figure 2.18 the spike below 4 MHz is an artefact 

also seen in the off time.

Figure 2.21. FFTs from a single segment of PCD data from a single exposure in DMEM with 10% concentration of 
microbubbles at 0.9 MPa. The FFTs show broadband component (left) and harmonic comb filtered broadband (right). 
Comparing this to the off-time noise (over 3-10 MHz), there is a clear elevation and broadband, suggesting this could 
well be cavitation. 

 

 Figure 2.21 shows harmonics, which are succesfully comb filtered and ultra-

harmonics which are not, but more importantly, compared to the off-time noise reference 

level obtained from Figure 2.12, there is an increased amplitude above ~0.03mV across 

the 3-10 MHz broadband integration frequency range.  

 Regarding the definiton of cavitation threshold, it is suggested that the threshold 

is around 0.9MPa. This happens at an amplitude of 2.47 mV  in terms of broadband 

amplitude at the time point 0.00166s. This early activity suggests that as the ultrasound 

beam reaches the target, microbubbles vibrate non-linearly and collapse. The continued

74 

activity in terms of harmonics  and ultra-harmonics  could be due to smaller bubbles 

perhaps originating from those destroyed (daughters) that continue oscillating .

 Figure 2.22, shows results from cavitation detection at 1.2 MPa, above the 

reference cavitation threshold (as in Figure 2.23). In Figure 2.22 it is possible to see a 

higher amplitude broadband signal in the time domain. Following the logic used before, 

the “massive” destruction of microbubbles happens at the time point of 0.000665s – 

earlier than at 0.9 MPa and with an amplitude approximately 2.5 times higher (6.21 

compared to 2.47 mV).

Figure 2.25. FFTs from a single segment of PCD data from a single exposure in DMEM with 20% concentration of

 The higher broadband amplitude  detected in the beginning of the exposure of 

DMEM with 20% concentration of microbubbles at 0.6 MPa (Figure 2.24), could be due 

to a decreased cavitation threshold in the presence of more dissolved  microbubbles in the 

sample. Figure 2.25  disproves this hypothesis because this shows the presence of only 

harmonics and ultra-harmonics. There is no broadband seen at 0.6 MPa.

Figure 2.27. FFTs from a single segment of PCD data from a single exposure in DMEM with 20% concentration of 
microbubbles. The FFTs show broadband component (left) and harmonic comb filtered broadband (right). Comparing 
this to the off-time noise (over 3-10 MHz), there is a clear elevation and broadband, suggesting this could well be 
cavitation. 

 

 At 0.9 MPa, harmonics and broadband activity can be seen in Figure 2.27. 

Detection is above the cavitation threshold previously defined at an amplitude of 3.74 mV 

in terms of broadband at the early time point of 0.000665s. The detected amplitude in the 

frequency domain suggests that the cavitation threshold is not at 0.9 MPa but lies between 

0.6 and 0.9 MPa – the pressures tested. To find the threshold more precisely, 

measurements at pressures lower than 0.9 MPa would need to be carried.

Results at 1.34 MHz 

i) DMEM alone 

 

Figure 2.28. PCD broadband signal (frequency-integrated over 3-10 MHz) as a function of time for a single 1.34 MHz, 
0.5 s exposure of DMEM with peak negative pressure 0 MPa. The last 0.1 s of acquisition is the off-time noise.  No 
cavitation was detected, because no exposure was made. Therefore in this case the whole trace represents off-time 
noise of the entire PCD detection system. The graph title shows that this was exposure number one, with data acquired 
on Ch0 of the DAQ system. Average noise is 0.655 ± 0.051 mV, and highest noise is  ~0.7 mV.

is around 0.03 (3 x 10^-2).  The title shows the exposure number (S1) and that data recorded channel 0 on the DAQ 
were processed 

  

The noise level at 1.34 MHz was of mean and SD 0.655 ± 0.051 mV  in the PCD 

broadband signal.  The cavitation threshold in DMEM was found to lie between 0.85 and 

1.06 MPa, since measurement  at focal peak negative pressures of 0.85 MPa did not show 

any broadband but at 1.06 MPa, values  above the cavitation threshold were found (Figure

mV.

 It is important to remember that, at 1.08 MHz, it was not possible to detect a 

cavitation threshold in the range of pressures tested (from 0.3 to 1.8 MPa). There is a 

difference between these measurements – the medium (DMEM) was of the same, but was 

tested under different conditions. For the first measurements at 1.08 MHz, the medium 

used had been transfered from the main bottle (stored in a cold room at approximately 

5ºC) to a falcon tube one day before the experiment, and for the experiments at 1.34 MHz 



Ultrasound Assisted Oncolytic Virotherapy - In Vitro and In Vivo Studies

_______________________________________________________________________ 
79 

the sample was transfered to a falcon tube on the day of the experiment. This probably 

made a difference in the quantity of dissolved gases in the sample. In all the experiments 

at 1.34 and 1.66 MHz, the samples of DMEM were maintained at room temperature 

(~23º) for approximately 1h prior to experiments.  

 The other difference in between experiments at 1.08 MHz and at 1.34 MHz is that 

the beam width at 1.08 MHz is wider, so the energy is spread into a wider region. In terms 

of experimental variation it would have been important to repeat at least measurements 

at one frequency to see how reproducible the results were. It is not possible to state if the 

reason for the difference in results is the state of the medium or the use of a different 

frequency. There are also uncertainties in the pressures - each pressure quoted is +/- 10%. 

This is not a big value but the pressure levels tested were quite far apart so the uncertainty 

in the cavitation threshold is bigger than this. Finally, by definition, it is harder to detect 

smaller amounts of broadband, so the sensitivity of the hydrophone decreases with the 

amount of cavitation.

 Figures 2.32 and 2.33 show the influence of microbubbles in DMEM with 10% 

microbubble concentration at 0.21 MPa. The presence of harmonics (1st harmonic with 

lower amplitude and then, 2nd to the 7th harmonic with higher amplitude) suggest 

nonlinear HIFU propagation and ultraharmonics in the absence of broadband signal 

suggest stable (non-destructive) bubble oscillation. This happened at 1.08 MHz but the 

amplitude of harmonics and ultraharmonics was lower than at 1.34 MHz – see Figures 

2.19 and 2.21. This difference may be due to driving at a value closer to the resonant 

frequency of the SonoVue Microbubbles.

Figure 2.35. FFTs from a single segment of PCD data from a single exposure in DMEM with 10% concentration of 
microbubbles. The FFTs show broadband component (left) and harmonic comb filtered broadband (right). Comparing 
this to the off-time noise (over 3-10 MHz), there is a clear elevation and broadband, suggesting this could well be 
cavitation. 

  

 At 1.34 MHz, the inertial cavitation threshold in DMEM lies between 0.42 and 

0.64 MPa. To compare broadband activity at 1.08 and 1.34 MHz, in DMEM medium with 

10% microbubbles see figures 2.22 and 2.34. This shows that at 1.08 MHz, the greatest 

destruction of microbubbles is at the beginning of the exposure, but at 1.34 MHz, 

broadband activity is sustained (and on average increasing) throughout  a large band of 

frequencies. Again, this could be due to the fact that at this higher frequency, we are closer 

to the resonant frequency of the microbubbles and so, sustained cavitation events are 

possible.  

 These microbubbles are excellent ultrasound scatterers due to their high 

compressibility. In an ultrasound field they act as resonant systems, resulting in energy at 

the subharmonic, ultraharmonic and higher harmonic frequencies in the backscattered 

ultrasound signal.  Any medium with a real pressure wave in it is likely to be non-linear 

- propagation of FUS creates harmonics (in the absence of bubbles). Only when there are 

bubbles it is possible to get half harmonic (and potentially other subharmonics), and, at 

finite pressures, harmonics of these. So half and ultra harmonics only occur when there 

are bubbles, but there are strong harmonics due to non-linear propagation. Although the 

bubbles will also contribute to the harmonics of the FUS, this will be a very small fraction 

of the total harmonic energy.

this to the off-time noise (over 3-10 MHz), there is a clear elevation and broadband, suggesting this could well be 
cavitation. 

 

 The detection lies again in the range of 0.42 MPa and 0.64 MPa (see Figures 2.36 

and 2.37) and, in contrast to what happens at 1.08 MHz (Figure 2.26), there is no big 

difference in terms of amplitude of broadband in the time domain. A concentration of 

20% of microbubbles appears to make no difference in terms of cavitation threshold. This 

could be due to a systematic error before the measurement, or while plating the sample 

but no other measurement was made to compare the results in terms of broadband 

amplitude.

in the time domain (a maximum of ~0.943 mV) as can be seen in figure 2.42. This is 

similar to what happens at 1.08 and 1.34 MHz, at amplitudes of 0.871 and 1.41 mV 

maximum, respectively.

 Data from exposures in DMEM with 10% microbubble concentration suggests 

that the inertial cavitation threshold lies between 0.3 and 0.6 MPa. Figures 2.44 and 2.45 

are data from measurements at 0.6 MPa. At this pressure 2nd to 6th harmonic are 

detectable and there is a low prevalence of ultraharmonics – small spikes can be seen in 

Figure 47 (right), between the filtered harmonics.

this to the off-time noise (over 3-10 MHz), there is a clear elevation and broadband, suggesting this could well be 
cavitation. 

 

 Finally, the measurements at 1.66 MHz in DMEM with a 20% concentration of 

microbubbles suggests an inertial cavitation threshold between 0.3 and 0.6 MPa (Figure 

2.47). At 0.6 MPa, a maximum broadband level around 3.2 mV was detected (Figure 

2.46).  

 As a summary, at 1.08 MHz in the absence of microbubbles, there is no detection 

of broadband in the range of pressures tested, in the presence of 10% and 20% 

microbubbles, inertial cavitation seems to be present at a pressure of 1.2 MPa and in the 



_______________________________________________________________________ 
 

_______________________________________________________________________ 
88 

the interval of 0.6-0.9 MPa, respectively. At 1.34 MHz, the inertial cavitation threshold 

lies in the intervals of 0.85-1.06 MHz, 0.42-0.64 MHz and 0.6-0.9 MHz in the absence 

and in the presence of 10 and 20% microbubbles, respectively. At 1.66 MHz, there was 

no cavitation threshold detected from 0 to 1.8 MPa in the absence of microbubbles and in 

the presence of 10 and 20% microbubbles it was between 0.3-0.6 MPa and 0.6-0.9 MPa, 

respectively. In vivo a 1.5 MHz transducer will be used, this analyses discards the use of 

the transducer at 1.08 MHz which has been tested just to have a better compreension of 

how frequency can influence the inertial cavitation threshols. The difference in frequency 

from 1.34 MHz and 1.66 MHz to 1.5 MHz is the same (±0.16 MHz). As the higher 

broadband amplitude seen happens at 1.34 MHz and as in vivo there is attenuating 

medium and inertial cavitation is not likely to happen, the 1.66 MHz transducer will be 

used to perform in vitro experiments. 

 The limitation of this study is that it is only possible to make a qualitative analyses 

rather than a quantitative one and if it was done presently, only the two frequencies of 

more interest would be tested as these experiments are very time consuming and there 

was not enough time to make repeats on the experiments made to test the reproducibility 

of the study.

3. In Vitro Study on the Effects of 

Focused Ultrasound on BN175 

Sarcoma Cell Line 
 

 

3.1. Introduction to the In Vitro Study 
 

 

 Research into the potential of ultrasound and microbubbles to enhance drug 

delivery has been undertaken over the last decades, and concepts such as sonoporation, 

i.e. the formation of temporary pores in the cell membrane, and enhanced endocytosis 

have been suggested as the main biological mechanisms involved [88, 89]. In general, the 

uptake of drugs or small molecules is attributed to ultrasound mediated transient 

permeabilization of the cell membrane. This transient permeabilization can be the result 

of stable and/or inertial cavitation events in the presence or absence of artificial 

microbubbles. 

 At very low acoustic pressures, microbubbles oscillate in a symmetrical, linear 

way, but at higher ultrasound intensities, microbubbles behave non-linearly as the 

microbubbles become more resistant to compression than to expansion [86]. During 

stable microbubble cavitation there is gas influx (during expansion) and gas efflux (during 

compression). In the case of symmetrical oscillations, the net gas influx over one 

expansion/compression cycle is zero. However, when the expansion phase extends, there 

is  net gas influx.The microbubble grows until it reaches its resonant size, whereupon it 

undergoes stable, low amplitude oscillation. Such stable oscillations create a liquid flow 

around the microbubbles - microstreaming [87]. Oscillating microbubbles in the vicinity 

of cells, exert shear stresses. At these lower ultrasound intensities, two mechanisms which 

contribute to the uptake of cell impermeable molecules, namely (i) the formation of small 

pores [88] and (ii) endocytosis [89] have been postulated. 

 At higher ultrasound intensities, the oscillation amplitude of a microbubble can 

grow rapidly during the low pressure phase, until the microbubble collapses. What 

happens is that the bubbles grow “too” big and then when they start collapsing the forces 

that makes them grow again is not big enough to stop the collapse so the bubbles implode. 

This type of cavitation is described as inertial cavitation. During collapse, shock waves 



_______________________________________________________________________ 
 

_______________________________________________________________________ 
90 

can be generated in the fluid and jet formation can occur - an asymmetrical collapse which 

results in the formation of a liquid jet towards a nearby surface. It has been shown that 

shock waves and microjets create very high forces that can create pores in the cell 

membrane [90]. While stably cavitating microbubbles need to have direct contact with 

the cell to affect the membrane, the effects of inertial cavitating microbubbles extend over 

a larger distance [91]. 

 The main objectives of the project are to study tumor virus distribution and then 

to quantify viral particle uptake using appropriate assays (e.g. qPCR, Plaque Assay, 

Immunofluorescence). As an initial approach, in vitro experiments were performed with 

the BN175 rat sarcoma line in the presence or absence of (i) focused ultrasound (ii) 

microbubbles and (iii) focused ultrasound and microbubbles. The physical parameters to 

be optimised in terms of maintained cell viability are peak negative pressure, Duty Cycle 

(the percentage of time it takes for a signal to complete an on-and-off cycle in which a 

signal is active), pulse repetition frequency, exposure duration and microbubble 

concentration. Once a range of optimal parameters was found, they were used in vivo in 

Brown Norwegian rats in order to determine optimal in vivo conditions. Optimal 

conditions mean that cell viability is not compromised and while experimenting in vivo, 

the virus can get into the tumor cells and replicate. 

 

 

3.2. Methods for the In Vitro Study using BN175 Cell 

Line 
 

 

3.2.1. Cell Culture 

 

 In order to initiate in vitro experiments, it was necessary to learn how to work in 

a cell culture facility, and in a biochemical laboratory, and to start culturing cells and to 

practise the assays used. These were the MTT assay for cell viability, and FACs analysis 

used to study the integrity of a cell membrane after an ultrasound exposure.

3.2.2. For FUS exposures in vitro 

 

 For in vitro experiments, all the FUS exposure and cavitation monitoring 

equipment and methods described in Chapter 2 were used. The  cell culture is ready for 

use in experiments two weeks after seedin in flasks. During this time, the cells must to be 

passaged, approximately twice a week – this is necessary when cells are at 90% 

confluence in the culture flask. When the cells were ready, the in vitro exposures were 

carried out as follows: 

Controls: 

1. DMEM + Ultrasound exposure 

2. DMEM + Ultrasound exposure + Microbubbles 

3. BN175 rat sarcoma cell line in DMEM + Ultrasound exposure 

4. BN175 rat sarcoma cell line in DMEM + Ultrasound exposure + Microbubbles 

 

Effects studied: 

i. Cell viability and Proliferation profile in medium only, compared to cells with or 

without microbubbles, no ultrasound exposure 

ii. Replication of cells in exposed medium compared to those in unexposed medium

iii. Response of microbubbles to ultrasound in medium, compared to their response 

in the presence of cells 

 

Range of parameters to test: 

o Peak Negative Pressure of 0, 0.6, 0.9 and 1.8 MPa  

o DC of 2, 5 and 20% 

o PRF of 10, 100 and 1 kHz 

o ?t of 1, 5 and 10 seconds

in a hood (semi-sterile environment) 

2. Pipette 0.47 ml of solution into each well in the well-plate (see figure 50)  

3. Expose wells to one of the ultrasound parameters under test (procedure 

described in section 2.2.2.) 

4. Transfer the well plate into the hood. Aliquot x ?l of cell suspension in the 

wells of a 96-well plate. Perform MTT assay immediately, 1 and 3 days after

     3.3. Results and Discussion of the In Vitro Study 
 

 

 

3.3.1. Results from MTT Assays 

 

 MTT Assays 

 

 The MTT assay is a colorimetric assay that measures the reduction of yellow 3-

(4,5-dimethythiazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) by mitochondrial 

succinate dehydrogenase. The MTT enters the cells and passes into the mitochondria 

where it is reduced to an insoluble, coloured (dark purple) formazan product. The cells 

are then solubilised with an organic solvent (eg. isopropanol) and the released, solubilised 

formazan reagent is measured spectrophotometrically. Since reduction of MTT can only 

occur in metabolically active cells the level of activity, and thus the colour intensity, is a

measure of the viability of the cells. This assay was used to verify the number of living 

cells imediately, one and three days after an ultrasound exposure.  

 The results shown here are allways relative to the unexposed control population 

of each day. The Optical Density (OD) is normalised to 100% so that the effect on 

different days can be compared. A more accurate way of applying this assay would be to 

standardize a Viability Curve of the number of cells as function of the OD read in the 

spectrophotometer. For the duration of this project, this was not possible because the cell 

line was really unstable and the cell culture did not allways grow at the same rate between 

experiments. Although, the results are presented in a relative manner which is still good 

enough for the purpose of this pilot study. 

 The in vitro study was performed using the 1.66 MHz transducer . This was chosen 

because the transducer of the VIFU system (used for in vivo experiments) only works at 

1.5 MHz, and the transducers available for  in vitro measurements could only be driven 

at 1.08, 1.34 and 1.66 MHz. The transducer which operated  at 1.08 and 1.34 was most 

effective at 1.08 MHz,  and so this frequency was tested, although this much lower than 

that that would be used in vivo. While 1.34 MHz, is as closer to the frequency of the VIFU 

transducer to be used, the broadband detection at 1.66 MHz is of lower amplitude in the 

time domain and in in vivo experiments cavitation is not as likely to occur as it happens 

in a non-attenuating medium – as previously discussed Chapter 2,  in section 2.2.3. 

 Fixed conditions have been used for each parameter under investigation on the 

day of exposure, 1 and 3 days after at 1.66 MHz. For the study on the effect of pressure 

on cell viability (compared to control) the fixed parameters were PRF of 100 Hz, DE of 

0.5 seconds and 40 cycles. For the study on the effect of pulse repetition frequency the 

fixed parameters were PNP of 0.6MPa, DE of 0.5 seconds and 40 cycles. To investigate 

the effect of duration of exposure the fixed parameters used were PNP of 0.6MPa, 100Hz 

PRF and 40 cycles. Finally, to study the effect of duty cycle the fixed parameters used 

were PNP of 0.6MPa, 100Hz PRF and 40 cycles.

Figure 3.4. Results from 3 independent experiments on viability of cells only exposed to different levels of pressure 3 
days after exposure. Error bars shown are the percentage of standard deviation of each sample (n=8) for the different 
drive levels used. 

 

 Figures 3.2 – 3.4, represent the data from 3 independent experiments with a fixed 

number of cells (approximately 15000 cells per well) in DMEM, from day 0 to day 3, 

respectively. These cells were exposed to three different levels of pressure at 1.66 MHz. 

The pressure levels were no ultrasound  exposure (0 MPa), at the level to just get inertial 

cavitation (0.6 MPa), during inertial cavitation (0.9 MPa) and at a high level of inertial 

cavitation (1.8 MPa) – from information collected during the analysis of cavitation 

thresholds in Section 2.2.3.  

 In day 0, the exposure seems to have a minimal effect on the viability of cells as 

the viability is within a standard deviation of 100% (Figure 3.2). One day after the 

exposure (Figure 3.3), there is high variability in the results and their associated standard 

deviation. A difference in viability of ~ ±20% at 0.6 MPa suggests that there is no effect 

of ultrasound up until, and including at, day 3 – see Figure 3.4. At 0.9 MPa no effect is 

seen at day 0, but the results from days 1 and 3 suggest that approximately 80% of the 

cells were killed. At 1.8 MPa, it is clear that the effect of ultrasound exposure  is greater 

– in day 0, approximately 85% of the cells survive; in day 1, despite a large standard 

deviation, an average viability of 75% is found, and in day 3, only ~ 45% of the cells are 

alive.  These experiments require a lot of practice to perfect and improve experimental 

technique.  Poor pippeting, errors in counting cells or making dilutions, loss while 

transferring cells from one flask to another, loss of cells while transferring them to the 

well plate and/or while taking them out.  The systematic errors mentioned above, can also 



_______________________________________________________________________ 
 

_______________________________________________________________________ 
98 

be seen at 0 MPa, in which no exposure is applied, and a spread in survival is seen. The 

differences in the cell cycle kinetics contribute to the error as biological variability. There 

are four phases in the cell cycle, taking from 10 – 20 hours depending on cell type and 

developmental state. The Interphase stage comprises G1, S, and G2 phases - when 

macromolecules are synthesized, the cell roughly doubles its cellular mass and is prepared 

for the mitotic (M) phase. Nondividing cells exit the G1 phase, entering a quiescent G0 

state. The results here are the average values from 3 independent experiments. The 

standard deviation between measurements is, for most of the results in this section, 

different, but the error bars match in almost all cases. This means that there is 

reproducibility between independent experiments but more experiments are necessary to 

increase the reproducibility of this study.

Figures 3.5-3.7, represent the data from 3 independent experiments with a fixed 

number of cells (approximately 15000 cells per well) in DMEM with a 1% concentration 

of microbubbles in solution, from day 0 to day 3, respectively. The trend of this group of 

results is similar to that without microbubbles. A pressure of 0.6 MPa gives a viability 

close to 100% in day 0, ~ 85% in day 1 and a viability of approximately 55% in day 3  

(these are averages from 3 independent measurements).

 At 0.9 MPa, in day 0, one of the three experiments is not comparable to the other 

two the error bars do not overlap. This lack of overlap is also seen at Day 3. Despite this, 

it can be seen that a concentration of 1% microbubbles has little added effect on the 

number of cells surviving, compared with the results seen in their absence, at all 

ultrasound exposure levels.

Figure 3.10. Results from 3 independent experiments on viability of cells only exposed to different levels of pressure 
with 10% concentration of microbubbles in the sample,  3 day after exposure. Error bars shown are the percentage of 
standard deviation of each sample (n=8) for the different drive levels used. 

  

 Figures 3.8-3.10, represent the data from 3 independent experiments with ~ 15000 

cells/ well with a 10% concentration of microbubbles, from days 0 to 3, respectively. In 

day 0, at 0.6 MPa only 20% of the cells seem to be unaffected by the exposure to 

ultrasound in the presence of microbubbles. This value increases to 40% in day 1 and in 

day 3, the large spread in survival found makes it difficult to draw a firm conclusion – 

see Figure 3.10. This spread could be due to poor experimental technique, as discussed 

earlier or to a problem with the cells themselves. At 0.9 MPa, only two independent 

experiments seem to be reproducible for day 0 because one (the green one in Figure 3.8) 

is really diferent in terms of result and associated error. However, it is not possible to 

determine if the results represented by the green trace are bad results when compared to 

the other two sets of results (presented in blue and red traces in Figure 3.8) – more 

experiments would be needed to guarantee the reproducibility of this study. Considering 

this, all the results are under analysis and so, it can be considered that in day 0 

approximately 75% of the cells are alive after the exposure to ultrasound in the presence 

of 10% concentration of microbubbles; approximately 25% in day and around 20% are 

alive of day 3. The higher level of pressure gives a viability close to 70% in day 0, 20% 

in days 1 and 3.  

 The results presented so far suggest that increasing the concentration of 

microbubbles decreases the cell viability  which can be attributed to the increased level 

of inertial cavitation.   This might compromise the membranes in such a way that they 



_______________________________________________________________________

can not survive or reproduce. The influence of inertial cavitation is also suggested by the 

fact that even whithout microbubbles, an increased pressure amplitude for reduces the 

viability of the cells. Figures 3.11 – 3.13 summarise the results for each condition tested, 

on the day of exposure, 1 and 3 days after the exposure.

percentage of standard deviation of each sample (n=8) for the different drive levels used 

 

 The effect of Pulse Repetition Frequency was studied at a pressure that has 

minimal effect on the viability, (0.6 MPa). The other (fixed) parameters were 40 cycles, 

0.5 s of continuous exposure . The values of PRF tested were 10, 100 and 1000 Hz.

 Figures 3.14 – 3.16 show the data from 3 independent experiments with ~ 15000 

cells per well) in DMEM, from day 0 to day 3, respectively. These figures show the minor 

effect of this parameter on the cell survival. On the three time points selected for analysis,

105 

the greatest effect is at a PRF of 1000Hz in day 0 but this result also has the highest 

standard deviation, and so may be statistically insignificant. As the results already 

analysed show a minimal impact of PRF on cell viability, only one (extreme) condition, 

with 10% microbubble concentration, was tested . The results are shown in Figures 3.17-

3.19.

 Figures 3.17 – 3.19 confirm the small difference in the results using different 

values of PRF in the presence of 10% concentration of microbubbles. In days 0 and 1, the 

survival is ~ 100%. The data points at a PRF of 100 Hz are a repeat of those shown in 

Figures 3.2-3.4, and the viability measured is the same, within experimental error.

10 seconds, 3  days after exposure. Error bars shown are the percentage of standard deviation of each sample (n=8) 
for the different drive levels used. 

 

 The effect of exposure time was also studied at a pressure of 0.6 MPa. The times 

chosen for study were 1, 5 and 10 seconds. This times were chosen because in vivo, an 

exposure grid needs to be defined and each point of the grid must be exposed for only a 

few seconds to allow the exposure of a large volume of the tumor during the conduct of 

theisolated limb perfusion. 

 Figures 3.23 – 3.25 represent the data from 3 independent experiments with ~ 

15000 cells/ well) in DMEM, from day 0 to day 3, respectively, to test the effect of 

exposure duration on the viability of cells. These figures show the minor effect of this 

parameter on their survival. This is thought to be due mainly  to the fact that the medium 

is not acoustically absorbing enough to raise the temperature to a cytotoxic level. An 

interesting issue to analyse is whether the effect on the membranes is greater for a longer 

exposure. 

 On the day of exposure, the survival is ~ 100% for all exposure times.  One day 

after the exposure, exposures of 1 and 5 seconds give survival around 100%, but an 

exposure of 10 seconds yields a decrease of around 15% in cell viability. Three days after 

the exposure, the cells exposed to ultrasound for one or five seconds have their viability 

decreased to approximately 80% and the group of cells exposed to ultrasound during 10 

seconds show a percentage of viability around 50% relative to unexposed controls.

 Once again, since the variation in exposure time had little effect on cell survival, 

the most extreme condition, in terms of inertial cavitation, was also tested  - cells in 

DMEM with a concentration of microbubbles of 10% -. The results are shown in Figures 

3.26 – 3.27, for the day of the experiment, 1 and 3 days after, respectively. 

 Even in the presence of  a 10% concentration of microbubbles, changing the 

exposure time has little effect on cell viability in days 0 and 1, where the survival is ~ 

100%. In day 3, 70%, 80% and 60% survival  is associated with exposures of 1, 5 and 10 

seconds respectively. The cells used are a sarcoma line, and it may not be a disadvantage 

if the cells die a few days after the exposure. The main goal is to help the virus to get 

through the membranes of the cell to allowit to start replicating and spreading throughout 

the tumor. In the presence or absence of virus, a delayed cell killing may be 

advantageous.. 

 As a summary, Figures 3.29 – 3.31 try to show a trend for each condition tested 

in the day of exposure, 1 day and 3 days after the exposure. The presence of 10% 

microbubbles on the sample has a similiar effect to that seen in the absence of 

microbubbles in terms of viability, considering the mean of the three independent 

experiments – see Figure 3.31.

for the different drive levels used. 

 

 The effect of Duty Cycle was also studied at a pressure that has minimal effect on 

the viability, 0.6 MPa. The values chosen to test were 2, 5 and 20%. These were chosen 

because in vivo, a continuous exposure would give an unwanted rise in temperature, so it 

is important to reduce the amount of time the ultrasound in ON during the total time of 

exposure.

 Figures 3.32 – 3.34 show the data from 3 independent experiments ~ 15000 cells 

/wellfrom days 0 to 3 showing the effect of the Duty Cycle in the viability of cells. Only 

a minor effect is seen immediately after exposure when this parameter is varied.of In days 

1 and 2, exposure with a 5% duty cycle gives a viability of ~ 100%, but with a duty cycle 

of 20%, a reduction of approximately 25% in viability is seen. In day 3 there is an ~ 20% 

increase in viability with a duty cycle of 2%, as is seen in Figure 3.34. For a duty cycle 

of 5%, the viability is around 95% and for a duty cycle of 20%, it is around 85% - greater 

than 1 day after the exposure. This shows the ability of the viable cells to proliferate after 

the exposure.

 Cells were exposed in DMEM with a 10% concentration of microbubbles to see 

the effect of duty cycle on cell viability, in the presence of cavitation nuclei. The results 

are shown in Figures 3.35 – 3.37. 

 On the day of exposure, the presence of microbubbles has no visible effect on the 

cell viability. One day after the experiment, there is a decrease in viability. However, the 

viability is the same for all duty cycles. The average survival at 2, 5 and 10% duty cycle

is 87.5, 80 and 75% respectively ( Figure 3.36). The average survival rates in day 3 are ~ 

92.5, 82 and 85% at a duty cycle of 2, 5 and 10%, respectively, but given the large 

standard deviations, these may not be statistically significantly different from those in day 

1.  

 Figures 3.38 – 3.40 summarise the trend for each condition tested on the day of 

exposure, 1 and 3 days after the exposure. The presence of 10% microbubbles on the 

sample has a similiar effect to that in the absence of microbubbles in terms of viability, 

considering the mean of the three independent experiments, for all the days under test.

? Effect of Ultrasound exposure at different acoustic Pressures of DMEM on cell 

survival 

 

 

Figure 3.41. Study on the effects of pressure on DMEM. Medium was exposed to ultrasound under different drive levels 
of pressure and then cells were added to the exposed medium to verify if they would attach and grow compared to 
control (same number of cells added to unexposed medium). Error bars shown are the percentage of standard 
deviation of each sample (n=8) for the different drive levels. 

 

 The effect of ultrasound in DMEM was tested to investigate the changes seen in 

the experiments with cells had to do with effects on the cells themselves, or if there was 

some change in the medium, for example in the pH, that could end up killing the cells. 

Figure 3.41 shows the results of this experiment and it is possible to see that both in the 

absence and in the presence of SonoVue microbubbles, the cell viability are allways close 

to 100%, within errors. There may be some toxicity associated with the presence of 

microbubbles but this was statistically insignificant. Any ultrasound induced change in 

the mediumwas sufficiently small (approximately ±10% in terms of percentage of 

viability compared to control) that it would not be an important factor in in vitro 

experiments. FACS analysis was used to investigate whether there was any change in cell 

membranes.

3.3.3. Results of FACs Analysis 

 

 “FACS” stands for Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting. This is a type of flow 

cytometry – an analytical cell-biology technique that utilizes light to rapidly and 

accurately count and profile cells in a heterogenous fluid mixture. When additional 

information is required, antibodies tagged with fluorescent dyes, and raised against highly 

specific cell surface antigens can be used to better identify and segregate specific sub-

populations within a larger group. In a flow cytometer a source of light is used to 

illuminate sample cells, travelling through a channel with photomultipliers, to detect 

refracted or emitted light from the cells. Data acquired by the sensors is then processed 

giving a  detailed “picture” of the sample and emissions from fluorescent dyes. A flow 

cytometer is made up of three main systems: fluidics, optics, and electronics. The fluidics 

system transports particles in a stream to the laser beam for interrogation; The optical 

system consists of lasers to illuminate the particles in the sample stream and optical filters 

to direct the resulting light signals to the appropriate detectors; The electronics convert 

the detected light signals into signals that can be processed by a computer with the 

appropriate software. 

  For the purpose of this thesis, this assay was used to detect the presence of a dye 

named Propidium Iodide (PI) dye inside a living cell. Propidium iodide is a membrane 

impermeable dye that is generally excluded from viable cells. It binds to double stranded 

DNA by intercalating between base pairs. PI is excited at 488 nm and emits at a maximum 

wavelength of 617 nm. Pi detection is an indicationthat there is a change in the cell 

membrane after an ultrasound exposure.  

 The amount of scattered light detected by the photomultipliers is related to the 

size and shape of the cells. The light intensity in the forward direction (along the axis that 

the light is traveling) defines the size of the cell, and the amount of light scattered to the 

side (perpendicular to the axis that the light is traveling) is related to their shape and 

homogeneity (granularity/complexity). Specialized software (FACSDiva, Version 6.1.3) 

allows the choice of a gate in which cells of interest (in terms of size and shape) are 

included. The difference from controls is determined from the statistical information on 

the populations under analysis.  

 The controls under study were unexposed cells, those exposed at 0.6 MPa (low 

exposure) and those exposed at 1.8MPa (high exposure), with or without PI. All the

_______________________________________________________________________ 
121 

controls include microbubbles (20% concentration to guarantee an extreme condition) to 

be sure that cavitation was present. Figures 3.42-3.44 show the data for controls without 

PI, which were used to help interpret the results on exposed cells. Population 1 (P1), 

defines the group of cells under study. The low level of Side-Scattered Light relates to 

dead cells  and the high Forward-Scattered signal shows cell doublets, i.e. the double 

detection of the signal from a cell, giving the impression that a cell is bigger than the 

others. The P1 gate includes two subpopulations. The one on the left (P3) and the one on 

the right. The one on the left is the dying population the one on the right is the living one 

(P2).

and with PI, respectively. The definition of P2 and P3 was made with data from controls with PI (Figures 3.45-3.47).

 Figures 3.45-3.47 are interesting not only because of the clear distinction between 

populations with, and without, PI but also because in terms of statistics, there is a 

difference between unexposed, low and high exposure controls. Statistics show that in the 

unexposed control, 11% of the population has PI inside its membranes compared to 15.3 

and 20.8% at low and high exposure, respectively. This suggests that there is increased 

permeabilization of the membranes that allows the PI to get inside the cells. Also, there 

is a reduction in the number of living cells detected in the same gate as we go from 

unexposed to low and then high exposure – 67.2, 63.6 and 59.3%, respectively. For the 



_______________________________________________________________________

controls without PI, these values are, from unexposed to low and then high exposure, 

82.2, 78.2 and 79.4%, respectively.

4.  In Vivo Study on the Development 
of a Combined Treatment for 

Cancer using Virus and Focused 

Ultrasound 
 

 

4.1. Introduction to the In Vivo Study 
 

 

Sonoporation describes the ultrasound technique in which the permeability of a 

cell membrane is changed. This alteration in the membrane generates a passage through 

which small molecules can enter. During the last decades, research on Focused 

Ultrasound and microbubble mediated Virotherapy has been carried out and proved to be 

a promising approach to cancer treatment. The treatments under study include strategies 

such as viral transduction of tumour cells with ‘suicide genes’, using viral infection to 

trigger immune-mediated tumour cell death, and the use of oncolytic viruses for their anti-

tumour action.  

Pre-clinical studies have identified isolated organ perfusion as a successful 

modality for the extravasation of particles within perfused tissue. For oncolytic viruses, 

sonoporation seems to be an important method of increasing viral uptake in cells, but the 

safety and efficiency of the overall process must be optimised for clinical use. Although 

the combination of focused ultrasound and the biological effects of virus has already been 

suggested as a useful technique to cancer treatment, the addition of a novel technique 

such as happens with Isolated Limb Perfusion to avoid uncontrolled infection of other 

organs may provide a more efficient way of killing malignant cells. 

The toxicity of viral therapy is a concern and to minimize it, ILP was developed. 

This is a chemotherapeutic technique using melphalan, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and 

oncolytic vaccinia virus and involving the cannulation of the blood vessels which feed 

the tumour-bearing region and isolation of the limb from the systemic circulation by 

tourniquet. This is necessary because of the severe toxicity of TNF-?. In this project, the 

combination of ILP and FUS in the presence of microbubbles to increase viral penetration 

of tumour bulk in Brown Norwegian rats transfected with BN175 fibrosarcoma cells is

studied. The perfused leg forms a collateral blood supply, which supplies the limb while 

the femoral artery and vein are isolated from the systemic circulation.  

 For the purpose of this dissertation the aims of this in vivo studie are: 

1. Characterisation of the effects of FUS and MB on standard ILP with 

melphalan/TNF-alpha in rat distal limb sarcoma.  

2. Evaluation of FUS + MB over low (~7MPa) and high (~11MPa) ultrasound 

pressures as a means of enhancing intratumoural delivery of oncolytic virotherapy 

during ILP.  

 

These studies included the evaluation of viral biodistribution using viral plaque 

assays, quantitative PCR, analysis of gene expression  and non-invasive imaging 

(bioluminescent and GFP/RFP imaging) for characterisation of the effects of therapeutic 

FUS + MB with ILP-delivered oncolytic virotherapy. 

 

4.2. Methods used for the In Vivo Study 
 

 

 This part of the project was carried out, as part of a joint study, with the help of 

Henry Smith – a Clinical Research Fellow at the Institute of Cancer Research. Henry has 

implanted the tumors in the rats, operated on them and then, after the treatment with 

ultrasound, extracted organs and analysed the tumors.  

 

Cell line, Cytotoxic Agents and Perfusion System 

 

 - The BN175 rat sarcoma cell line is tumorigenic in Brown Norwegian rats. Cells 

were passaged and cultured in DMEM. 

 - Melphalan (SigmaAldrich, St Louis) was reconstituted using the manufacturer’s 

instructions. GLV-1h68 was produced and provided by Genelux Corporation (San 

Diego).  

 - GLV-1h68 was constructed by inserting three expression cassettes into the 

F14.5L, J2R and A56R loci of the viral genome.  

 - Recombinant rat TNF-? (First Link Ltd, Birmingham, UK) was dissolved in PBS 

to a concentration of 100 mg/mL. 

 -Therapeutic agents were added to the perfusate reservoir at the following doses: 

melphalan - 40 µg, TNF-? - 50 µg, GLV-1h68 - 1 × 107plaque forming units (pfu).

arrows point to the components labelled in figure 4.1.1. 

  

Animals 

 -  Specific pathogen-free, male Brown Norwegian rats (200–250 g) aged 8-10 

weeks,  were housed in compliance with all relevant regulatory requirements and fed 

standard chow and water ad libitum. 

 - BN175 cells were harvested from tissue culture flasks and washed in PBS three 

times prior to injection of 1 × 107cells in 500µl of PBS on the outside of the left leg. 

Tumour growth was assessed every 48 hr by direct calliper measurement in two 

orthogonal dimensions. Tumour volume was calculated using the formula: ?????? =

1

2
(?????2 × ???????). ILP was performed when tumours had a maximum diameter 

between 0.8 and 1.2 cm in all directions. Perfusion was performed for 13 min and washout 

for 2 min. Transient limb dysfunction (in the form of decreased limb movement) usually 

occurred immediately after the procedure, 

but full function in the perfused limb was seen within 2 hr of recovery. The therapeutic 

groups consisted of six animals. 

 - The ILP technique involved the cannulation of blood vessels. An incision was 

made in the groin as shown in figure 4.2.a, the vessels were dissected and cannulated as 

shown in figure 4.2.b. The cannula were about 20cm long and were connected to the 

perfusion circuit.

Equipment, Treatment and Experiments using VIFU 2000 

 

1. Equipment Design: Cavitation Detection in conjunction with the VIFU system 

 

 The VIFU 2000 is a pre-clinical HIFU (High Intensity Focused Ultrasound) 

system (Alpinion, Korea) uniquely designed for investigating a wide range of HIFU 

applications in small animals. This system enables users to undertake real time image 

guided research in projects such as ultrasound meditated drug delivery studies, ablation 

of solid tumors, and mechanical and cavitation effects in ex-vivo/in-vivo systems. 

 No cavitation detection was possible with the system available, so it was necessary 

to design a holder for a PCD (that used for in vitro experiments, with the same detection 

system – see section 2.2.2). This was done with the help of the ICR Mechanical 

Workshop. A picture of the holder is shown in Figure 4.3.

transducer. the yellow arrow indicates the piece of the holder that allows movement of the PCD in two directions for 
positioning and the red arrow points tothe piece of the design that holds the PCD in place. 

 

2. Calibration of the VIFU system 

 

An attempt to calibrate the VIFU system was made using a micrometric gantry to 

move a hydrophone in the ultrasound field.  This was needed because the VIFU system’s 

gantry did not allow sufficiently accurate measurements. It was necessary to localise the 

peak of the ultrasound beam (as described in section 2.1.2) and once the peak had been 

found, pressure data was acquired at 0.5mm intervals along one direction orthogonal to 

the beam axis. It was found that the VIFU gantry did not reproducibly return to zero after 

a scan, and so accurate beam plotting was not possible. However, the measurement using 

the micrometric gantry was not perfect because a water tank was needed for coupling and 

so the gantry was positioned at a small angle to the transducer, and this led to less accurate 

calibration of the system – this can be seen in figure 4.4. The focus was found and it can 

be seen in figure 4.4 that a pressure peak is present. From figure 4.4 to figure 4.5, in terms 

of calibration, the transducer was rotated through 90º and the measurement was repeated 

– a flat top can be seen. This is because the beam was slightly displaced in this axis, with 

respect to the hydrophone.

Specifications sheet from NPL sets the error of the hydrophone detection to 7% but a value of 10% of error in each 
measurement is considered to avoid underestimates 

 

3. Treatment Planning 

 

 

 The results in vitro have been used as a starting point to test whether there was an 

effect of ultrasound on viable cells, but the results cannot be compared to what happens 

in vivo due different factors including the aborption in tissue, higher temperature and 

presence of vasculature.  

 As a starting point, a dummy experiment was made on a dead rat and the coupling 

was achieved using a water bag – see figure 4.7.A. The alignment of the cavitation 

detection system was aligned with the HIFU focal region prior to experiments. The 

exposures started at peak negative pressure of 0.6 MPa.   The output was increased until 

some signal was detected by the PCD. After a number of exposures it was decided to 

group the experiments into two exposure levels – “low” and “high” pressure, i.e. the 

lowest pressure in which some reflections could be detected by the PCD and a higher 

level to test if there was a big difference in terms of viral uptake results. In the low 

pressure cohort, 6 rats were exposed at 50W (~7MPa peak negative pressure at the focus) 

and  ... rats in the high pressure cohort, were treated with a 150W exposure (corresponding 

to ~10MPa peak negative pressure), with fixed parameters of  5% duty, 100 PRF and 



_______________________________________________________________________

134 

ultrasound frequency of 1.5 MHz. Figure 4.7 shows a part of the experimental set up for 

in vivo experiments. 

 In this pilot study, 4 cohorts were defined as follows: 

i. Standard ILP alone 

ii. Cohort 1 (ILP + 10% MB + FUS at 50W with TNF? in perfusate) 

iii. Cohort 2 (ILP + 10% MB + FUS at 150W with TNF? in perfusate) 

iv. Cohort 3 (ILP + 10% MB + FUS at 150W) 

 

 In all the cohorts, 3 animals were euthanized 1h after treatment and the other 3, 

72h after the treatment. 

 

 

 
Figure 4.7. Photo showing the experimental arrangement, including the water bag used for effects of coupling. A - The 
leg of the rat is roughly centered under the plastic film which is transparent to ultrassound. B – A rat is positioned 
under the water bag, the VIFU transducer is positioned just above the leg and the computer on the right shows what 
the imaging probe is detecting. The computer contains a software that allows treatment planning. 

 

 The transducer used in the in vivo experiments is a single element HIFU transducer 

of nominal frequency 1.5 MHz, Focal Depth of 4 cm, Focal  Width of 1 mm and Focal 

Height of 7 mm – see Figure 4.8. Acoustic Pressure data from manufacturer as a function 

of Software Input Power can be seen in Table 1. As it was expected, there is a big 

difference from what have been calibrated from Alpinion’s calibration due to the fact that 

during calibration, the hidrophone was slightly out of focus and in a 1 mm point, any 

slightly displacement makes a big difference. Previous calibration on the wet system, 

made by a member of the therapeutic ultrasound team, proved that data from calibration 

is accurate when compared to in-house made calibration so, due to the impossibilty to 

perform an accurate measurement on the dry configuration and considering the fact that

135 

the transducers are identical, the values of pressure for the power levels used will be 

according the manufacturer’s calibration.

Sample collection and storage 

The animals were culled one hour and seventy-two hours following the procedure. The 

tumours were resected, weighed and snap frozen immediately. Tumour samples were 

homogenised with PBS and protease inhibitors using a Precellys homogeniser. Cell lysis 

was assisted by repeated freeze-thaw cycles. The samples were stored at -80°C.

Viral plaque assays 

CV-1 cells were grown to confluence on 24 well plates. The samples were thawed and 

the supernatants were incubated on the CV-1 cells for 48 hours prior to viral detection. 

The cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde/0.2%glutaraldehyde for 5 minutes then 

washed with PBS and stained for 4 hours with X-gal staining buffer,  X-gal (1:100) and 

X-gal (1:1000). The cells were then washed with Ultra Filtered Water and dried. 

Quantitative PCR 

Expression of the A21L vaccinia gene was measured by qPCR using the Genelux GL-

LC1 VV-A21L kit. DNA was prepared from the lysate of the tumour samples. A21L 

specific primers were used (forward: 5’-GTAAACTACAAACGTCTAAACAAGAA-3’ 

and reverse: 5’-CCTGGTATATCGTCTCTATCTTTATCAC-3’). The viral copy 

number was then normalised by the weight of the tumour samples to give the number of 

viral copies per gram of tissue. 

 

 

4.3. Results and Discussion of the In Vivo Study 
 

 

 Successful results, in terms of reduced tumor growth and increased rat survival 

time, using oncolytic virotherapy have highlighted the need to develop a treatment which 

increases viral uptake, in which invasiveness is reduced, and where post-treatment 

surgery would not be needed. In addressing this goal, this project focused on the study of 

the combination of ILP and FUS in the presence of microbubbles to increase viral 

penetration of tumour bulk efficiency in Brown Norwegian rats transfected with BN175 

fibrosarcoma cells.  

 The rats were prepared for ultrasound exposure– see Figures 4.9-4.11, cavitation 

was detected during the experiments and then, the tumor tissue was analysed using 

histochemical, qPCR and VPA assays. Organs such as lungs, heart and liver were also 

collected to study the effectiveness of the tourniquet around the limb. Results from tumor 

tissue analysis and cavitation are presented below.

 The results of the quantitative PCR for the tumour samples suggest that FUS has 

not added anything in terms of viral copy numbers – see Figure 4.12. Apart from the 

cohort without TNF-?, the viral copy number does not increase with time as was hoped. 

As there is a lack of information about how the virus responds to FUS, a possible 

explanation could be that the virus is being destroyed or damaged by the ultrasound. The 

viral copy number on PCR goes down from 1 hour to 72 hours in the HIFU cohorts, which 

may suggest that the virus is damaged, or at least not able to replicate. Overall it looks as 

if FUS may be having a negative effect. The viral plaque assays (VPAs) reveal live virus 

that is still able to replicate, rather than just the amount of viral DNA (which is measured 

by qPCR assesses).

viral copy number was normalised using the weight of the tumour samples to give the number of viral copies per gram

 In this assay, cell monolayers are infected with a low ratio of virus, such that only 

sporadic cells become infected. Each group of infected cells is referred to as a plaque. 

Uninfected cells surround the plaques. After several infection cycles, the infected cells in 

the center of the plaques begin to lyse and the peripheral infected cells remain surrounded 

by uninfected cells. This phenomenon causes the light passing through the infected cells 

to refract differently from the surrounding uninfected cells, and the plaque can be 

visualized either by the naked eye or by light microscopy. Each plaque represents a single 

virus. Individual plaques obtained from different dilutions of a viral stock can be counted 

to determine the viral titer (pfu/ml) of a given transfection or virus stock. In this study, 

the viral plaques from the tumour samples have not grown any significant amount of

virus, and grew only from the viral stock used for the perfusions (used as a positive control 

for the plaques). Some pictures from the VPAs can be seen in figure 4.13.   

 

 

Figure 4.13. Pictures from the VPAs of two different cohorts – a cohort without exposure to ultrasound (Standard ILP) 
and a cohort with the combined treatment at 150W of exposure. There are three wells per sample. The first well is the 
undiluted lysate from the tumour (Neat)  followed by 1 in 100 and 1 in 1000 dilutions of the lysate. The positive control 
is the stock of virus  used at the same dilution for each perfusion. 

 

 As can be seen in Figure 4.13, plaques are only visible on the positive control. 

This suggests that the virus could be killed by the US or by other means, including lack 

of perfusion access into the limb and therefore lack of virus. The yield from the VPAs 

was too small for a comparison between cohorts, and so does not provide any usable data 

and . It would be good to have histology data to see whether there was ultrasound damage 

in the tissue but the staining for X-gal did not work either. X-gal staining is a rapid and 

convenient histochemical technique used to detect ?-galactosidase activity - used in 

molecular biology as a reporter marker to monitor gene expression The presence of an 

active ?-galactosidase produces a characteristic blue dye which provides a means of 

distinguishing the presence of an active/live virus. 

 For the purpose of this in vivo study and contrary to what has been done in vitro, 

pulsed exposures have been used to avoid the rise in temperature in situ. So, both in the 

low (50 W) and high (150W) cohort, the exposure duration has been 10 s in each point 

with a PRF of 100 Hz and 5% DC. This introduced an issue in terms of cavitation 

processing because the script used to process recorded data analysed in Chapter 2 was 

prepared to process continuous data. Using the same script for pulsed data would be a 



_______________________________________________________________________ 
 

_______________________________________________________________________ 
140 

problem because of the discontinuities in between pulses – off time data would be 

regarded as if a signal would have been acquired. The modifications in the processing 

script have been made with the help of Dr. John Civale, a member of the Therapeutic 

Ultrasound Team in the Institute of Cancer Research. The signal was divided into 

segments and in each segment, everytime the signal was above a defined threshold, the 

signal would be processed in consecutive segments until the signal would below the 

defined threshold.  

 The results from the cavitation detection have been summarized and can be seen 

in Tables 2-4, representing the results by cohort. In these tables, the first row identifies in 

which rat the experiment was made. A total of 23 rats have been used in a random way, 

i.e. the experiments started with rat 1 (rats 1-6 have been used to define the conditions to 

then start the main experiments) and in each day of experiments, it was tried to operate 

in rats from different cohorts to guarantee that the experience gained from experiment to 

experiment would not interfer in the results. All the tumors were exposed 45 times to 10 

s of ultrasound in 5 grids of 9 points in different positions on the tumor, and cavitation 

data has been acquired during each exposure.  

 The summary present in Tables 2-4 show the percentage of exposures in each rat 

that allowed the detection of the effect described in each row. As it was already discussed, 

the term harmonic refers to frequencies that are integral multiples of the frequency of the 

transmitted pulse (which is also called the fundamental frequency or first harmonic). The 

presence of half or ultra harmonics is linked to nonlinear propagation and stable cavitation 

and the detection of these phenomena is present in the second and third rows of Tables 2-

4. Forth and fifth columns have to due with the detection of inertial cavitation – a first 

look at recorded data in the time domain would be used to choose time points of highest 

amplitude compared to noise level (two or three point have been used to further analyses) 

and then through FFT on these time points, an elevation in FFT would be regarded as 

inertial cavitation everytime there was a broadband of signal above the threshold as 

defined in Chapter 2.

different positions on the tumor. Cavitation detection was performed during all the exposures but in rats 18 and 16 it

 One of the first things to comment on when looking at Tables 2-4 is the huge 

variation between thenumber of exposures in which cavitation is detected. Data acquired 

required a close inspection to decide whether inertial cavitation was present or not – data 

was analysed both in the time and frequency domain as described in section 2.2. 

 In Table 2, there is a summary of the results of cavitation detection of cohort 1 in 

which the tumor was exposed at a peak negative pressure of approximately -7 MPa during 

Isolated Limb Perfusion with 10% SonoVue microbubbles in the perfusate containing 

TNF-?, Melphalan and Vaccinia Virus. A probable detection of broadband of 42.9 ±

142 

19.0% is associated with this cohort. This cohort comprised in 3 rats in which the organs 

were collected 1h post-experiment, and 3 rats in which the collection was made 72h after 

exposure. The broadband detection in these two sub-groups is considered to be present in  

37.1 ± 26.0% and 48.8 ± 11.1%, respectively. If we look at Figure 108, we see that the 

amount of virus detected in the 1h collection rats is higher than the amount detected in 

the 72h collection rats.  

 Table 2 summarizes the results of cavitation detection for cohort 2 in which the 

tumor was exposed at a peak negative pressure of approximately -11 MPa during Isolated 

Limb Perfusion with 10% SonoVue microbubbles in the perfusate containing TNF-?, 

Melphalan and Vaccinia Virus. In this cohort, there is a detection of broadband of 60.6 ± 

24.8%. This cohort also comprises 3 rats with organ collection 1h post-experiment and 3 

rats in which the organ collection was 72h post-experiment. The broadband detection is 

considered to be present in  57.8 ± 36.8% and 63.3 ± 12.8%, respectively. In Figure 108, 

we see that the amount of virus detected in the 1h collection rats is higher than that 

detected in the 72h collection rats.  

 In Table 3, there is information from cavitation detection for cohort 3 in which the 

tumor was exposed at a peak negative pressure of approximately -11 MPa under Isolated 

Limb Perfusion with 10% SonoVue microbubbles in the perfusate containing only 

Melphalan and Vaccinia Virus (without TNF-?).  In the 6 rats of the cohort, there is a 

detection of broadband of 67.4 ± 19.1%. This cohort also comprises 3 rats of 1h collection 

post-experiment and 3 rats in which the collection was made 72h post-experiment. The 

broadband detection is in  65.4 ± 11.7% and 69.5 ± 27.6%, respectively, in these two 

groups. In Figure 108, we see that the amount of virus detected in the 1h collection rats 

is lower than the amount detected in the 72h collection rats.  

 The analysis Table by Table suggests that the higher probability of the occurence 

of inertial cavitation is directly associated with the amount of virus detected 1h post 

collection – see Figure 4.12 -  but more experiments would be needed to have enough 

data for concrete conclusions, although there is a “trend”. When it comes to the data from 

the 72h collection, this trend may also be found but there is a big difference between the 

cohorst with and without TNF-? present – is TNF-? toxic not only for the tumor but also 

for the virus? This is an important question that would be an advantage for a future clinical 

aplication – the increased efficacy of oncolytic virus in the absence of TNF-? would 

greatly reduce the toxicity of a combined therapy including, for example, FUS, Melphalan 

and Vaccinia Virus or only FUS and Vaccinia Virus.

 Figures 4.14-4.16, show examples of the traces from processed cavitation data in 

which it is possible to detect broadband, half harmonic or ultra harmonics. These figures 

are representative of the figures that helped to decide wheter these effects were present 

or not at each exposure of each rat.

 There was considerable difficulty in getting the cavitation detection system 

working properly – the PCD alignment was done with respect to the centre of the water 

bag used to “cover” the limb, and in which degassed water was used for coupling; then, 

it was not possible to trigger the cavitation detection system automatically and it was 

necessary for someone to start the data acquisition as the treatment started and for each 

point of the 5 grids chosen.  

 The size of the leg influences the quality of cavitation detection from rat to rat. 

This depends on the success of the surgery, i.e., on the time it takes to place the cannula 

and to get the perfusion working. This would also affect the distance traveled by the 



_______________________________________________________________________ 
 

_______________________________________________________________________ 
146 

ultrasound beam to reach the tumor; additionaly, different rats may have different 

vasculature distribution and this also influences not only the attenuation of the ultrasound 

beam, the amount of reflected signal heard by the PCD, but also the perfusion rate and 

number of microbubbles that get into the limb.   

 Another point to consider is the positioning of the rat was not fixed from 

experiment to experiment although a great effort was made to have each rat in a similar 

position; finally, the detection was allways dependent on the position of the PCD with 

respect to the tumor, and it is possible that the detection zone of the PCD was not allways 

able to hear the scatter from the tumor. It is important to remember that broadband 

detection only means that it was of sufficient amplitude for the system to hear it, but 

absence of a detected signal does not mean there was no cavitation. The deeper the 

ultrasound is fired into tissue, the less signal is detected. Conversely, if target is 

superficial, and there is cavitation in the water as it regassed and/or heated, significant 

amounts of cavitation activity can be detected, but may not come from within the tumour 

(imaging is good for showing cavitation in the water bath, but it had to  be turned off 

because it interfered with cavitation detection when on). Imaging data acquired in the 

beginning and end of the exposure is of some help to compare how the depth of the target 

could have influenced the cavitation detection. Some of these images are shown in 

Figures 4.17-4.19.

Figure 4.17. Ultrasound Imaging acquired in the prior (left)  and post (right) exposure to ultrasound on rats 9 , 11 and 
20 from cohort 1. The images were acquired using the E-Cube 9 provided with the VIFU system with a phased array 
transducer working at 10 MHz. The yellow cross marks the starting point of the treatment – the initial target. Then, a 
grid of 9 points centred on this point was exposed.. In each grid, the exposure were created  from left to right in three 
rows of three points. 

 

 If the variability in cavitation detection could be explained by the differences in 

the depth of treatment in cohort 1, one would expect that rat 20 would give the poorer 

data because, , the treatment starting point is deeper than in rats 9 and 11. Similar results 

would be expected for rats 9 and 11 – see Figure 4.17. From Table 2, the detection of, for 

example, half harmonic in rats 9, 11 and 20 is of approximately 20, 95.6 and 20% and in 

terms of broadband detection the values at 26.7, 66.7 and 17.8%, respectively. This is 

counter to the hypothesis about the depth of treatment, and the same is true for the three 



_______________________________________________________________________ 
 

_______________________________________________________________________ 
148 

examples from cohort 2 – see Figure 4.18. For rats 10 and 12, the depth of treatment is 

similar and, as can be seen in Table 3, for these rats the half harmonic detection rates are 

of 25.6 and 100% and  32.6 and 100% for broadband. In cohort 3, from the three examples 

chosen, rat 22 should give the better results in terms of cavitation detection because the 

treatment is more superficial but this is also not the case – see Figure 4.19 and Table 4.

 A general conclusion on these results is that, as the cavitation detection data of the 

three cohorts is higly variable and despite the fact that there is a possibility that the use of 

focused ultrasound at ~7 and 10 MPa could have been the cause to the death of virus, this 

is not possible to confirm. The assays available only detect the amount of live virus in the 

tumors and also because it was not possible to study in vitro the consequences of the 

exposure of Vaccinia Virus to ultrasound. The histochemical analysis would be needed 

to analyse the level of damage in the tissue, if there was any, and then, it could be proved 

if the virus did not replicate in the tumor because either the virus or the tissue have been 

destroyed.

5. Conclusions and Future Work 
 

 
 This project was a pilot study in which Focused Ultrasound and Microbubbles 

were added to a combined therapy, which includes Melphalan, TNF-? and Vaccinia 

Virus, to try to enhance the efficacy, and to reduce the toxicity of the treatment. This work 

involves the calibration of equipment, detection of cavitation thresholds, and in vitro and 

in vivo experiments with BN175 rat sarcoma line. The in vitro experiments were carried 

out to test the combined therapy in the presence or absence of (i) focused ultrasound and 

(ii) microbubbles, with different exposure parameters, such as peak rarefactional focal 

pressures, duty cycle, pulse repetition frequency, exposure duration and microbubble 

concentration.  Finally, in vivo experiments in Brown Norwegian rats were conducted to 

help to determine the effectiveness of this combined therapy using Focused Ultrasound 

in the presence of Microbubbles, Melphalan, TNF-? and Vaccinia Virus, and Isolated 

Limb Perfusion. The main conclusions on the work carried out are summarised here. 

 The cavitation thresholds study was performed i) to study the difference in 

thresholds for different transducer frequencies, ii) to choose the levels of pressure for in 

vitro exposures, iii) to decide on the best frequency to use when microbubbles were 

present (that being the one closest to the resonant frequency of the microbubbles).  

 The main conclusions from this study are that the microbubbles resonate at a lower 

l evel of peak negative pressure at the frequency of 1.34 MHz than what happens at 1.66 

MHz in the absence of microbubbles. This may be because of the condition of the medium 

at the time of exposure. Differences in the quantity of dissolved gases and temperature 

are the main things that could affect the results.  The samples had to be prepared in a cell 

culture room and then transferred to a physics lab to be exposed. Another factor that could 

explain this result has to do with the resonant frequency of the microbubbles. A study of 

the SonoVue Microbubbles used reported its resonant frequency to be 1.6, 2.1 and 3.1 

MHz for bubbles of 4.0, 3.2 and 2.6 µm, respectively. It is also stated that the mean 

diameter of the microbubbles is 2.5µm, 90% are smaller than 6µm and 99% smaller than 

11µm. Looking at this data, we could say that bigger bubbles are resonant  at lower 

frequencies and so, in the sample tested, a large number of bubbles could be bigger than 

4.0 µm.  

 Interestingly, at each drive frequency, the cavitation threshold lay in the same 

pressure interval, and so a general conclusion could be made about the influence of the

151 

microbubbles on the cavitation threshold – the percentage of microbubbles dissolved in a 

certain amount of medium does not seem to change the threshold to get cavitation. At the 

cavitation threshold, at any given frequency, in the presence of microbubbles, the 

amplitude of the cavitational events detected is similar for the three frequencies. As it was 

necessary to choose between 1.34 MHz and 1.66 MHz, in order to be closer to the 

frequency used in vivo, 1.66 MHz seemed to be a better choice because the data suggests 

that at this frequency, broadband was maximised and the main goal is to achieve inertial 

cavitation. Accurate measurements must be made if a quantitative rather qualitative 

analysis is required. 

 As appreciation summary of the in vitro study, it seems that treatment of the cells 

with ultrasound only, or of ultrasound with 1% microbubble concentration, has no effect. 

However, when a 10 % concentration of microbubbles is used  there are two interesting 

things: i) there is a reduction in cell viability immediately after treatment irrespective of 

acoustic pressure used, ii) medium and high pressures with microbubbles kill the cells, 

but no cell killing is seen with low pressure and microbubbles. As a result, cells treated 

with low pressure and 10% microbubbles start proliferating again and by day 3 they reach 

control viability. The rest of the treatments do not seem to affect the cells, so the 

differences in between measurements can be regarded as experimental variation. 

 As most of these results are reproducible, they were useful for this study whose 

purpose is to open up cells and cell junctions without actually killing them. It shows that 

low pressure and high concentration of microbubbles will affect the cells immediately 

after treatment but not actually kill them. 

  The results from FACS analysis are important in that they allow a distinction to 

be drawn between populations with and without PI for unexposed, ‘low’ and ‘high’ 

exposure controls – the detection of PI inside the cells, in a living population, is increases 

as the exposure is raised. This could suggest that there is an increased permeabilization 

of the membranes that allow the PI to get inside the cells. 

 This project focused on the study of the combination of ILP and FUS, in the 

presence of microbubbles, to increase viral penetration efficiency in tumour bulk in 

Brown Norwegian rats transfected with BN175 fibrosarcoma cells.  

 The results of the quantitative PCR for the tumour samples suggest that FUS has 

added nothing in terms of viral copy numbers.  As there is a lack of information of how 

the virus responds to FUS, a possible explanation could be that the virus is destroyed, or 

damaged by, the ultrasound. The results of the viral plaque assays should help to explain 



_______________________________________________________________________

this situation as this assay quantifies live virus that remains able to replicate, rather than 

just the amount of viral DNA (which is what qPCR assesses).  

 The VPAs showed that plaques could only be seen on the positive control. This 

suggests that the virus had been killed by the US, or by another mechanis), including a 

lack of perfusion access into the limb, and therefore lack of virus. The yield from the 

VPAs was too small too allow a comparison between cohorts, so does not provide any 

usable data. It would be good to have histology data to see whether there was ultrasound 

damage in the tissue, but the staining for X-gal did not work well.    

 The analysis of cavitation data shows a huge variation in terms of results both 

from different cohorts, and within the same cohort – this proves how unpredictable and 

unstable cavitation detection can be - more experiments are needed to have enough data 

to draw reliable conclusions. The difficulty found while trying to get the cavitation 

detection system working properly was definitely one of the main reasons for the poor 

results seen. As discussed before, the in vivo factors that could have reduced the quality 

of cavitation detection in different rats, could have been differences in the size of the legs, 

and in the time taken to place the cannula to get the perfusion working. Possible 

differences in vasculature, different positioning of the rat from experiment to experiment, 

and the fact that the detection was dependent on the position of the PCD relative to the 

tumor are factors that have a negative influence on the quality of cavitation detection.  It 

is important to remember that detecting broadband just means there was enough for the 

system to “hear” it, but that its absence does not mean there was no cavitation. 

 “What could have been done better in this project?” or “What should be done 

next?” are important questions to ask when we are discussing a pilot project on any topic. 

One of the main issues on this project was the lack of time to learn, and put into practice 

all the new concepts needed to perform in vitro and in vivo experiments on such a new 

topic as ultrasound assisted oncolytic virotherapy.  

 A lot of burocracy is involved in getting authorization to experiment on viral 

samples, and this was not achieved during the project’s timetable. Also, if there had been 

more time, it would have been important to do at least 5 repeats for each condition on test 

(PNP, PRF, DC and DE), instead of only 3, in order to be more certain about the 

reproducibility of the experiments. Adding to this, more levels in each condition should 

have been tested to have a better understanding of any trend that could have been present, 

but a choice of quality over quantity had to be made – during the project’s timescale, it 

was crucial to have better, rather than more, data. Then, in terms of the experiment itself,

it would have been better to have a different well plate configuration to avoid the 

contamination of the sample due to the entrance of non-sterile degassed water through 

the channels around the wells. Although a big effort has been made to decontaminate the 

well plate prior to manipulation inside the hood, this could explain some of the variation 

present in the results. Another issue for the experiments in vitro is the fact that the 

transducer used was not being driven at the same drive frequency as the transducer used 

in vivo. Despite the differences between the two scenarios, it is allways important to have 

a means of comparison when we need to translate what we see in vitro to the experiments 

done in vivo.  

 There is need to find a way to have a fixed position for the rat for the in vivo 

experiments, to minimise the variation in the path travelled by the ultrasound beam until 

its target, and to re-design the cavitation detection system to guarantee detection in the 

same direction in any experiment. A ring passive cavitation detector would be a suitable 

option because it would allways be aligned with the ultrasound beam. More animals in 

each cohort are required for better quantitative analysis. Despite the poor detection in 

terms of cavitation detection, a lower value of peak negative pressure should have been 

used and must be tested to see if there are better results in terms of the enhanced uptake 

of virus into the tumor bulk. 

 It is worth repeating the experiments performed for the purpose of this thesis 

because the combined therapy including Melphalan, TNF-? and Vaccinia Virus seemed 

to have potential to increase efficacy and reduce toxicity of the treatment.  The parameters 

of the ultrasound beam used seem to have no negative effect on cell viability even in the 

presence of microbubbles so there is the need to prove that this can also improve the 

permeability of cell membrane to virus with in vitro experiments. Once this is done, 

experiments in vivo must be repeated under different conditions to confirm that the 

efficacy of the combined therapy can be enhanced.
