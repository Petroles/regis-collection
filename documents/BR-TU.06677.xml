RESUMO 
 
Um total de 142 crânios do boto-de-Burmeister, Phocoena spinipinnis depositados em museus 
e coleções cientificas da Argentina, Brasil, Chile, Peru e Uruguai foram utilizados para 
explorar a variação geográfica em relação ao tamanho e forma do crânio de P. spinipinnis. 
Ademais, foi realizada uma caracterização oceanográfica da área de distribuição do boto-de-
Burmeister através de dados históricos de temperatura, salinidade e oxigênio a 0 e 50m de 
profundidade na costa Atlântica  e Pacifica.  As idades dos animais foram obtidas pelas 
leituras das GLGs na dentina. A idade mais alta atingida por ambos os sexos foi de 10 anos. 
Medições na dentina mostraram dimorfismo sexual na primeira GLG e diferenças geográficas 
entre botos do Peru e Atlântico. Três tipos de anomalias foram registrados nos dentes, e a 
linha marcadora parece estar associada ao “El Niño”. Vinte e oito caracteres métricos foram 
utilizados para explorar o dimorfismo sexual e crescimento. A maturidade física do crânio foi 
estabelecida quando o comprimento côndilo-basal atingiu 95% do comprimento total 
(?266mm nos machos e ?277mm nas fêmeas). Diferenças no tamanho e forma do crânio 
foram analisadas através de morfometria tradicional e geométrica. Os resultados revelaram 
dimorfismo sexual, sendo as fêmeas maiores do que os machos.   As diferenças em tamanho e 
forma concentraram-se principalmente na região rostral e neurocrânio. Foi observada variação 
geográfica entre os botos do Atlântico, Chile e Peru. P. spinipinnis do Peru são de menor 
tamanho em relação a os botos do Chile e Atlântico. Botos do Chile apresentam um tamanho 
e forma intermediária, e os botos do Atlântico são maiores (especialmente na região orbital, 
altura do crânio e região rostral). A distância de Mahalanobis mostrou maior separação entre 
os botos do Peru e do Atlântico, e menor distância entre os exemplares do Chile e Atlântico. 
A morfometria geométrica explica com maior clareza as diferenças entre botos do Chile e 
Atlântico, especialmente nas vista ventral e lateral. A correlação entre variáveis ambientais e 
morfométricas através da análise de correlações canônicas e dos quadrados mínimos parciais 
de dois blocos sugere que as diferenças observadas no tamanho e na forma dos crânios têm 
uma importante influência espacial, associada à variabilidade sazonal das condições 
oceanográficas presentes nos dois oceanos e diretamente relacionada às três áreas 
oceanográfica propostas neste estudo: (1) de Paita, Peru (05°01’S, 81ºW) até o sul do Golfo 
de Arauco, Chile (?39°S); (2) do sul do Golfo de Arauco até o sul do Rio da Prata (?38°S); e 
(3) do Rio da Prata até Santa Catarina, Brasil (28º48’S; 49°12W). Adicionalmente, propõe-se 
que P. spinipinnis apresenta uma distribuição contínua desde Paita, Peru ate a bacia do Rio da 
Prata, Argentina, podendo alcançar águas uruguaias e brasileiras em determinadas condições 
oceanográficas (entrada de águas mais frias e menos salinas com direção ao norte, associadas 
à Convergência Subtropical). 
 
Palavras-chave: Phocoena spinipinnis, boto-de-Burmeister, dimorfismo sexual, variação 
geográfica, morfometria tradicional, morfometria geométrica, determinação da idade, 
distribuição, anomalias, condições oceanográficas.

ABSTRACT 

 
A total of 142 skulls from Burmeister’s porpoises, Phocoena spinipinnis from museums and 
scientific collections from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Uruguay were analyzed to 
explore the geographical variation in relation to size and shape on skulls of P. spinipinnis. In 
addition, an oceanographic characterization of the area of distribution of Burmeister’s 
porpoise by historical data of temperature, salinity and oxygen the 0 and 50m of depth on the 
Pacific and Atlantic coast was carried out. The age of the animals was obtained by reading the 
Growth Layer Group in dentine. The oldest male and female were 10 years of age. 
Measurements in dentine showed sexual dimorphism in the first GLG and geographic 
differences between porpoises from Peru and Atlantic. Three types of anomalies were 
recorded in teeth, and the marker lines seem to be associated to “El Niño”. Twenty-eight 
characters were used to explore sexual dimorphism and growth. Physical maturity of the skull 
was established when 95% of condylobasal length was attained (?266mm in the males and 
?277mm in the females). Differences in size and shape of skull were analyzed by traditional 
and geometric morphometrics. The results revealed sexual dimorphism, being the females 
larger than male, and the differences in size and shape are concentrated mainly in the rostral 
region and neurocranium. Geographic variation between porpoises from Atlantic, Chile, and 
Peru was observed. P. spinipinnis from Peru are smaller compared to porpoises from Chile 
and Atlantic. Porpoises from Chile have an intermediate shape, and porpoises from Atlantic 
are larger (mainly related to orbital region, skull height and rostral region). The distance of 
Mahalanobis showed more separation between porpoises from Peru and Atlantic, and less 
distance between specimens from Chile and Atlantic. Geometric morphometrics was more 
useful for show differences between specimens from Chile and Atlantic, especially in the 
ventral and lateral views. The correlation between environmental and morphometric variables 
by canonical analysis and two-block partial least squares suggests that the differences 
observed in the size and shape of skulls would have an important spatial influence, associated 
to the seasonal variability of the oceanographic conditions present in the two oceans, and 
directly related to the three oceanographic areas proposed in this study: (1) from Paita,  Peru 
(05°01’S, 81ºW) to south of Arauco Gulf, Chile (?39°S); (2) from south of Arauco Gulf to 
south of La Plata River,  Argentina (?38°S); and (3) from La Plata River to Santa Catarina,  
Brazil (28º48’S; 49°12W). In addition, it is proposed that P. spinipinnis presents a continuous 
distribution from Paita, Peru to La Plata River basin, Argentina, being able to reach 
Uruguayan and Brazilian waters under certain oceanographic conditions (intrusion of colder 
and less saline waters toward the north associated with the Subtropical Convergence). 
 
Keywords: Phocoena spinipinnis, Burmeister’s porpoise, sexual dimorphism, geographic 
variation, traditional morphometrics, geometric morphometrics, age determination, 
distribution, anomalies, oceanographic condition.

INTRODUÇÃO GERAL 
 

A Família Phocoenidae esta constituída por seis espécies: boto comum, Phocoena 

phocoena; boto-de-Dall, Phocoenoides dalli; boto-de-Burmeister, Phocoena spinipinnis; 

boto-de-óculos, Australophocaena dioptrica, boto sem nadadeira, Neophocaena 

phocaenoides, e vaquita, Phocoena sinus (BERTA et al., 2006). Em geral são animais 

pequenos, no máximo com 2,5m de comprimento, rostro indiferenciavel da cabeça, a qual tem 

aparência arredondada, dentes pequenos e em forma de espatula, nadadeira dorsal pequena ou 

ausente (JEFFERSON et al., 1993). Estas espécies em sua maioria apresentam uma 

distribuição costeira e estão sujeitas à exploração pelas comunidades costeiras, porem é 

particularmente vulnerável a mortalidade acidental pelas atividades de pesca, degradação do 

habitat (poluição, tráfego marítimo e diminuição importante das espécies-presa pela pesca 

intensiva dos recursos) (BJØRGE &amp;amp; DONOVAN, 1995). 

O boto-de-Burmeister, Phocoena spinipinnis foi descrita por BURMEISTER (1865) 

com apenas um exemplar capturado na boca do Rio da Plata, Argentina. A origem do nome 

científico Phocoena spinipinnis é do grego phokaina (boto) ou do latim phocaena (boto) e 

spinna (que tem espinhas) e pinna (asa ou nadadeira). Também é conhecida por seu nome 

vulgar como: marsopa espinosa (em Espanhol), golfinho espinhoso (em Português) e 

Burmeister’s porpoise (em Inglês) (BROWNELL &amp;amp; PRADERI, 1982, 1984; PINEDO, 1989; 

JEFFERSON et al., 1993; BJØRGE &amp;amp; DONOVAN, 1995). Esta espécie despertou grande 

interesse, embora tenham se passado muitos anos até que outros exemplares fossem coletados 

na Argentina (GALLARDO, 1917), Chile (PÉREZ-CANTO, 1896; PHILIPPI, 1893, 1896) e 

Peru (ALLEN, 1925). Após a década de 60, os registros e estudos nas costas pacífica e 

atlântica tornaram-se mais comuns.  

O boto-de-Burmeister é pequeno e robusto, o comprimento médio é de 

aproximadamente 1,5m. A coloração é variável, na região dorsal é escura e homogênea, na 



 

 

2

região ventral é ligeiramente mais clara e ao redor dos olhos geralmente existe uma mancha 

circular mais escura. A espécie possui o menor número de dentes do gênero Phocoena, de 14 

a 16 pares de dentes na maxila e de 17 a 19 pares de dentes na mandíbula. Possui uma 

nadadeira dorsal característica, sua forma é similar a um triângulo reto de base larga e 

apresenta pequenos tubérculos (dentículos dérmicos), pequenas projeções semelhantes a 

espinhos, característicos de P. spinipinnis (Figura 1) que originaram o nome cientifico e 

popular (BURMEISTER, 1865; PRADERI, 1971; BROWNELL &amp;amp; PRADERI, 1982, 1984; 

HETZEL &amp;amp; LODI, 1993; JEFFERSON et al., 1993 BJØRGE &amp;amp; DONOVAN, 1995). 

P. spinipinnis ocorre em águas da América do Sul (BROWNELL &amp;amp; PRADERI, 1982). 

Sua distribuição na costa atlântica estende-se desde Santa Catarina (28º 48’S, 49º 12’ W), sul 

do Brasil até Terra do Fogo e Canal de Beagle (PRADERI, 1971; PILLERI &amp;amp; GIHR, 1972; 

WÜRSING et al., 1977; GOODALL, 1978; PINEDO, 1989; SIMÕES-LOPES &amp;amp; XIMÉNEZ, 

1989). Na costa do pacífico, o Boto-de-Burmeister ocorre desde a Bahia de Paita, norte do 

Peru (05º05’S) até o estreito de Magalhães, sul do Chile (ALLEN, 1925; CLARKE, 1962; 

AGUAYO, 1975; GASKIN et al., 1987; REYES &amp;amp; VAN WAEREBEECK, 1995). Os Botos-

de-Burmeister, além de possuírem hábitos discretos (são aparentemente tímidos), não 

costumam aproximar das embarcações. O tamanho do grupo geralmente varia entre 1 e 6 

indivíduos (GOODALL et al., 1995a; HEINRICH et al., 2004). Contudo, VAN 

WAEREBEECK et al. (2002) reportou em setembro 2001 um grupo de 150 indivíduos 

próximo à Ilha Guañape, centro-norte do Peru (08º28’04’’S, 78º58’16.7’’W). 

No Peru, P. spinipinnis é a segunda espécie mais capturada em pesca, sendo as 

capturas tanto acidentais como intencionais (READ et al., 1988; VAN WAEREBEEK &amp;amp; 

REYES, 1990, 1994; VAN WAEREBEEK et al., 2002). Outrossim, sua carne é 

comercializada para o consumo humano (CLARKE, 1962; GRIMWOOD, 1969; MITCHELL, 

1975; CLARKE et al., 1978; BROWNELL &amp;amp; PRADERI, 1982, 1984; READ et al., 1988;

VAN WAEREBEEK &amp;amp; REYES, 1990). No sul do Chile ocorre captura acidental nas redes de 

pesca artesanal e a gordura dos botos assim capturados são utilizadas como isca para a captura 

da centolla, Lithodes antarcticus (e.g., REEVES 2003). No Uruguai e Argentina, capturas 

acidentais ocorrem em redes de pesca, ainda que em menor freqüência (CASTELLO, 1974; 

GOODALL, 1978; BROWNELL &amp;amp; PRADERI, 1982). 

O Boto-de-Burmeister está incluído na categoria “dados insuficientes” (Data 

Deficient) da Lista de Espécies Ameaçadas de Extinção da União Internacional para a 

Conservação da Natureza (IUCN) (REEVES et al., 2003), pois a informação disponível sobre 

a historia de vida, distribuição, movimentos, abundância e estrutura da população é ainda 

escassa (PRADERI, 1971, BROWNELL &amp;amp; PRADERI, 1982, 1984; PINEDO, 1989; 

CORCUERA et al., 1995; GOODALL et al., 1995a, b; REYES &amp;amp; VAN WAEREBEECK, 

1995; VAN WAEREBEEK et al., 2002; REEVES et al., 2003).  

Diferenças no tamanho corporal foram observadas entre botos da costa do Pacífico e 

do Atlântico. Comprimentos máximos de 182 – 183 cm foram registrados nos exemplares do 

Peru (REYES &amp;amp; VAN WAEREBEEK, 1995). Este comprimento foi similar ao registrado na 

costa chilena (n=28) (BRIEVA &amp;amp; OPORTO, 1990). Contudo, na costa atlântica se 

registraram exemplares com comprimentos máximos de 196 – 200 cm (BROWNELL &amp;amp; 

PRADERI, 1984; CORCUERA et al., 1995; GOODALL et al., 1995b). 

A descrição do crânio de P. spinipinnis e análises da morfometria craniana são raras 

(BURMEISTER, 1865; ALLEN, 1925; NORRIS &amp;amp; MCFARLAND, 1958; NOBLE &amp;amp; 

FRASER, 1971; PRADERI, 1971; PILLERI &amp;amp; GIHR, 1972, 1974; BROWNELL &amp;amp; 

PRADERI, 1982, 1984; PINEDO, 1989; SIMÕES-LOPES &amp;amp; XIMENEZ, 1989; 

CORCUERA et al., 1995; REYES &amp;amp; VAN WAEREBEEK, 1995) e a maioria baseados em 

um único exemplar ou alguns indivíduos. O dimorfismo sexual já foi documentado em 



 

 

4

crânios de exemplares sexualmente adultos coletados no Peru (REYES &amp;amp; VAN 

WAEREBEECK, 1995).  

BROWNELL &amp;amp; PRADERI (1982, 1984) e CORCUERA et al. (1995) baseados em 

diferenças no tamanho corporal sugeriram que P. spinipinnis apresentaria duas populações 

isoladas na América do Sul: uma no Oceano Pacífico e outra no Atlântico. CORCUERA et al. 

(1995) propõem que os exemplares do Uruguai e da Província de Buenos Aires pertenceriam 

à mesma população. Mas para esclarecer esta questão faz-se necessária a realização de 

estudos de variação geográfica (considerando a morfologia e a genética de exemplares 

coletados ao longo de toda sua distribuição). Recentes estudos apóiam a diferenciação 

genética entre P. spinipinnis do Peru e Chile-Argentina (ROSA et al., 2005).  

Mudanças no tamanho e estrutura etária de uma população são esperadas quando esta 

é submetida a capturas. Geralmente o tamanho corporal médio e idade reprodutiva diminuem 

(JENNINGS et al., 2001). Por outro lado, fatores ambientais associados com a interrupção ou 

mudança nos hábitos alimentares também podem influir no crescimento do indivíduo 

(LOCKYER, 1990, 1995; MANZANILLA, 1987). LOCKYER (1990) sugere que a variação 

temporal observada na média da maturidade sexual e taxa de crescimento da baleia-fin, 

Balaenoptera physalus da Islândia, foi uma resposta denso-dependente a mudanças na 

abundância da presa. Tanto efeitos ambientais como antrópicos (captura direta ou acidental, 

poluição e tráfego marítimo em ambientes costeiros) podem causar relações denso-

dependentes, que poderiam refletir no tamanho do indivíduo, maturidade sexual e tamanho 

populacional (FOWLER, 1987). PERRIN et al. (1976) encontrou diferenças em parâmetros 

de história de vida entre duas populações de Stenella attenuatta expostas a diferentes níveis 

de exploração.  

Muitas espécies de pequenos cetáceos são ameaçadas devido aos altos níveis de 

mortalidade acidental e/ou direta, e à degradação do habitat. Contudo, nos últimos anos 



 

 

5

consideráveis esforços têm sido realizados para o estabelecimento de medidas de conservação 

e manejo dessas populações (REEVES et al., 2003). A primeira etapa neste manejo é definir 

as populações envolvidas, e uma ferramenta para definir populações de mamíferos são as 

análises de variação geográfica baseadas em variáveis morfológicas e genéticas. Como uma 

conseqüência, a variação geográfica tem sido extensivamente estudada em animais (GOULD 

&amp;amp; JOHNSTON, 1972) e uma variedade de técnicas estatísticas têm sido desenvolvidas para 

clarificar esses padrões (THORPE 1976, 1980, 1983; NEFF &amp;amp; MARCUS, 1980). Esses 

estudos proporcionam a base para a descrição de unidades de estoques utilizadas para avaliar 

e manejar essas espécies (SCHNELL et al., 1986).  

Em mamíferos marinhos, o crânio tem sido muito utilizado em estudos da variação 

geográfica, através da morfometria tradicional (método linear) (PERRIN, 1975; SCHNELL et 

al., 1986; PINEDO, 1991; AMANO &amp;amp; MIYAZAKI, 1992; PERRIN et al., 1994; BARRETO, 

2000; AMANO et al., 2002; BEASLEY et al., 2002; BRUNNER, 2002; BRUNNER et al., 

2002; HIGA et al., 2002; JEFFERSON 2002; RAMOS et al., 2002; OLIVEIRA et al., 2005). 

Contudo, as estruturas morfológicas num organismo têm dois componentes (tamanho e 

forma) e a forma é mais informativa para definir entidades biológicas na natureza (PATTON 

&amp;amp; BRYLSKI, 1987; ATCHLEY et al., 1992).  

A morfometria geométrica é um novo método que começou a ser desenvolvido no 

início dos anos noventa, sendo chamada de “a revolução em morfometria” (ROHLF &amp;amp; 

MARCUS, 1993). A morfometria geométrica abrange uma série de técnicas que visam 

descrever e representar a geometria das formas estudadas. É capaz de descrever e localizar 

mais claramente as regiões de mudanças na forma, e de reconstruir graficamente estas 

mudanças. Esta descrição é feita através do estabelecimento de pontos anatômicos de 

referência em estruturas homólogas, os chamados marcos anatômicos. Este método tem maior 

robustez na análise e exclui os fatores de posição, orientação e tamanho na análise da forma

(ROHLF, 1990, 1993, 1996, 2001; BOOKSTEIN, 1991, 1996; ROHLF &amp;amp; MARCUS, 1993; 

SLICE, 1996; BOOKSTEIN, 1998; MONTEIRO &amp;amp; REIS, 1999; ZELDICH et al., 2004). Em 

mamíferos marinhos, este método foi recentemente aplicado em crânios de pinípedes para 

estudos ontogenéticos (SANFELICE, 2003), dimorfismo sexual (OLIVEIRA et al., 2005) e 

em variação geográfica (HIGA et al., 2002; MONTEIRO-FILHO et al., 2002; DREMER, 

2005).  

Estudos sobre o grau de variação morfológica, genética ou comportamental 

desenvolvidos em cetáceos possibilitam entender melhor os processos evolutivos a nível 

intra-específico, na medida em que permitem visualizar as variações que podem estar 

ocorrendo dentro de uma espécie. O conhecimento do grau de variação morfológica intra-

específica (tanto no espaço como no tempo) pode fornecer informações sobre a estrutura das 

populações e seus padrões de movimentação (PINEDO, 1991). O estudo de variações 

morfológicas fornece informações de aspectos funcionais importantes para a ecologia de uma 

espécie, como o tamanho e a forma de certos órgãos têm efeitos sobre o grau de adaptação do 

organismo ao ambiente (WIIG, 1992). Portanto, esses estudos podem fornecer maiores 

informações sobre os padrões de movimento e estruturas de estoques, através da identificação 

de ecotipos (formas locais que devem seus atributos a efeitos seletivos de um determinado 

ambiente) e de variações sazonais na presença destes em um determinado local. 

A grande variedade de condições oceanográficas existentes ao longo da distribuição de 

P. spinipinnis, somada à grande plasticidade exibida, leva a pensar que esta espécie 

apresentaria algum tipo de variação geográfica.

Abstract –  Historical data (1965-2000) of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen at 0 

and 50m of depth) were analyzed to understand the seasonal variability of the oceanographic 

conditions associated to the distribution of P. spinipinnis from Paita, Peru (05°01’S, 81ºW), in 

the Pacific Ocean, to Santa Catarina, Brazil (28°48’S, 49°12’W),  in the Atlantic. The 

variability of historical average data was associated with different processes as a function of 

the geographical position and seasonality. These variations have different expressions along 

each coast as a function of the local circulation system. The northern boundary of the 

distribution of P. spinipinnis for the Pacific coast at Paita (5°S) is coincident with the 

westward turn of the Humboldt Current, as it is incorporated into the South Equatorial 

Current. In the Atlantic, the northern boundary for the species seems to be associated with the 

Atlantic Subtropical Convergence (30-40°S). The high temperature (&gt;24°C) and salinities 

(&gt;36psu) registered at the surface and at 50m between the coast and 20nm were coincident 

with the known northern limit of the distribution of this species on both coasts of South 

America. We propose the existence of three oceanographic areas within the distributional 

range of P. spinipinnis: (1) from Paita,  Peru to south of Arauco Gulf, Chile, that has the 

influence of the Humboldt Current, and a developed oxygen minimum zone (OMZ); (2) from 

south of Arauco Gulf to south of La Plata River,  Argentina, which shows the influence of the 

Cape Horn and Malvinas Currents, respectively, as well as downwelling processes, freshwater 

contributions from fjords, glaciers and rivers; and (3) from La Plata River to Santa Catarina,  

Brazil, which is characterized by the influence of the Brazil Currents, and the freshwater 

contributions of the basin of La Plata River and the estuarine system of Patos Lagoon, south 

Brazil. The presence of the OMZ is possibly a factor in the separation of groups (1) and (2) 

along in the Chilean coast. In addition, we propose that Burmeister’s porpoise presents a 

continuous distribution throughout this range from Paita, Peru to La Plata River basin, 

Argentina, being able to reach Uruguayan and Brazilian waters under certain oceanographic 



 

 

11

conditions (intrusion of colder and less saline waters toward the north associated with the 

Subtropical Convergence). 

 

Resumen – Datos históricos (1965-2000) de temperatura, salinidad y oxígeno disuelto (0 y 

50m) fueron analizados para comprender la variabilidad estacional de las condiciones 

oceanográficas asociadas a la distribución de P. spinipinnis desde Paita, Perú (05°01’S, 

81ºW), en el Océano Pacífico, hasta Santa Catarina, Brasil (28°48’S, 49°12’W). La 

variabilidad de los datos promedios históricos fue asociada con diferentes procesos como una 

función de la posición geográfica y estacionalidad. Estas perturbaciones tienen diferentes 

expresiones en cada costa en función de los sistemas de circulación en cada océano. El limite 

norte de la distribución de P. spinipinnis en la costa Pacifico en Paita (5°S), es coincidente 

con la zona donde la Corriente de Humboldt gira al oeste y se incorpora a la Corriente 

Ecuatorial. En la costa Atlántica, el limite norte para esta especie parece estar asociada a la 

Convergencia Subtropical del Atlántico (30-40°S). Altas temperaturas (&gt;24°C) y salinidades 

(&gt;36psu) registradas en superficie y 50m de profundidad entre la costa y 20nm fueron 

coincidentes con el limite norte conocido de la distribución de esta especie en ambas costas de 

Sudamérica. Nosotros proponemos tres áreas oceanográficas asociadas con la distribución de 

P. spinipinnis: (1) desde Paita al sur del Golfo de Arauco,  Chile, que tiene la influencia de la 

Corriente de Humboldt y la zona de mínimo oxígeno (ZMO); (2) desde el sur del Golfo de 

Arauco hasta el Río de La Plata,  Argentina, la cual muestra la influencia de las Corrientes del 

Cabo de Hornos y Malvinas respectivamente y procesos de hundimiento, contribuciones de 

agua dulce desde los fiordos, glaciares y ríos; y (3) desde el Río de La Plata hasta Santa 

Catarina, Brasil, la cual esta caracterizada por la influencia de la Corriente de Brasil y los 

aportes de agua dulce desde la cuenca del Río de La Plata y del sistema estuario de la Lagoa 

dos Patos, en el sur de Brasil. Probablemente, la presencia de la ZMO es un factor importante 



 

 

12

en la separación de los grupos (1) y (2) a lo largo de la costa chilena. Además, proponemos 

que la marsopa espinosa presenta una distribución continua a lo largo de su rango desde Paita,  

Perú hasta la bacía del Rio de la Plata, Argentina, siendo capaz de alcanzar aguas uruguayas y 

brasileras bajo ciertas condiciones oceanográficas (entrada de aguas frías y menos salinas 

hacia el norte asociada a la Convergencia Subtropical).

Introduction 

The distributions and movements of marine mammals are clearly influenced by their oceanic 

environment. As indicated Hastie et al. (2005), although such relationships are inherently 

dynamic, distributions have been related to a range of environmental determinants, including 

sea surface temperature (e.g., Selzer and Payne, 1988; Forney, 2000; Baumgartner et al., 

2001; Benson et al., 2002; Hamazaki, 2002; Piatkowski et al., 2002; Littaye et al., 2004; 

Jonhston et al., 2005; Tynan et al., 2005), salinity (e.g., Selzer and Payne, 1988; Forney, 

2000; Tynan et al., 2005), water depth (e.g., Ross et al., 1987; Gowans and Whitehead, 1995; 

Baumgartner, 1997; Davis et al., 1998; Carretta et al., 2001; Benson et al., 2002; Trukhin, 

2003; Tynan et al., 2005). However, the importance of these determinants appears to vary 

between regions and species, a feature that highlights the need to focus studies on the role of 

oceanography in dolphin habitat selection on a regional basis.  In addition, the distribution, 

abundance and foraging success of top trophic level predators in marine systems, such as 

sharks, seabirds, pinnipeds, and cetaceans, are determined by large-scale oceanographic 

patterns and their effect on prey distribution and abundance (Smith et al., 1986; Ainley et al., 

1995a, b; Kenney et al., 1995; Pyle et al., 1996; Tynan, 1997; Sydeman and Allen, 1999;

Forney, 2000; Benson et al., 2002). In marine systems, heterogeneity of productivy is the 

result of complex interactions of wind, currents, and land masses (Johnston et al., 2005).  

Burmeister’s porpoise, Phocoena spinipinnis (Burmeister, 1865) is an endemic species of  

coastal waters of South America, from Santa Catarina, southern Brazil (28°48’S, 49°12’W) to 

Paita Bay, northern Peru (05°01’S, 81ºW) (Brownell and Praderi 1982; Simões-Lopes and 

Ximenez, 1989; Jefferson et al., 1993). However, it is unclear whether the species is present 

continuously throughout this range (Klinowska, 1991; Jefferson et al., 1993; Goodall et al., 

1995a; Reeves et al., 2003). This species has been assumed to have a coastal distribution, 

preferring shallow waters, and indeed most of the sightings have been nearshore (Goodall et 

al., 1995b). In general, few sightings and movements of P. spinipinnis have been reported 

(e.g., Aguayo, 1975; Donoso-Barros, 1975; Würsig et al., 1977; Guerra et al., 1987; Reyes 

and Oporto, 1994; Van Waerebeek et al., 2002, Heinrich et al., 20044).  

Burmeister's porpoise is associated with a broad range of water temperatures. At the southern 

limit of its distribution near Cape Horn and Tierra del Fuego, water temperatures range from 

3°C in June (austral winter) to about 9°C in the summer months (Brownell and Praderi, 1982). 

In the north, the species appears to be associated with temperate waters in the two major 

northward flowing currents off South America, the Humboldt and the Malvinas Currents 

(Brownell and Clapham, 1999).  

The Humboldt and Cape Horn Currents are the most important currents in the Southeast 

Pacific, and the distribution of P. spinipinnis in this region is associated with both currents.

These currents are born by the bifurcation of West Wind Drift or Antarctic Circumpolar 

Current center at 45°S. The Humboldt Current has a northward direction from central Chile 

(40°S) to northern Peru, where it is incorporated into the South Equatorial Current near to 5°S 

at Paita, Peru (Bakun, et al., 1999). The Cape Horn Current has a southward direction, and 

passes around the continent through the Drake Passage, influencing both east and west coasts 

of South America (Pickard, 1973).  

On the Atlantic coast, the distribution area of Burmeister’s porpoise is associated with the 

Brazil and the Malvinas Currents. The Brazil Current originates where the westward flowing 

trans-Atlantic South Equatorial Current bifurcates into two currents, the North Brazil and the 

Brazil Currents, with the latter branch having a southward direction (Peterson and Stramma, 

1990; Stramma et al., 1990). The Malvinas Current is a branch of the Circumpolar Current 

and flows northward along the continental shelf of Argentina until it reaches the Brazil 

Current offshore La Plata River (Legeckis and Gordon, 1982; Garzoli, 1993; Vivier and 

Provost, 1999). Both currents converge generating the Atlantic Subtropical Convergence or 

Brazil-Malvinas confluence, which lies between 33-38°S along the continental margins of 

Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina, and it is considered a major transitional oceanic domain in 

the Southwest Atlantic (Figure 1) (Olson, et al., 1988; Podesta et al., 1991).   

The habitat where P. spinipinnis is known to occur shows sectors favorable to upwelling 

process, as the case of the Humboldt Current, which presents several centers of coastal 

upwelling (Strub et al., 1998; Tarazona and Arntz, 2001). In the case of the Brazil Current, 

the upwelling is associated with the cyclonic meanders in the region of the Southeast Brazil 

Bight or Santos Bight (24-26°S) (Campos et al., 2000). Another difference between the 

Pacific and Atlantic Oceans is the presence of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). The OMZs 

are present along the Pacific coast, at midwater depth in the open ocean where dissolved 



 

 

15

oxygen concentration falls below 0.5ml l-1 (Kamykowski and Zentara, 1990; Levin et al., 

1991). 

To date, few studies have been conducted to determine the effect of oceanographic features 

and environment variables on the distribution and movements of P. spinipinnis (e.g., Würsig 

et al., 1977; Simões-Lopes and Ximenez, 1993). However, for understand the movements of 

P. spinipinnis it is first necessary to know its distribution at regional scales and mesoscales 

(10s to 100s of km), and later to fine scales (1 to 10 km). 

The purpose of the present study is to examine the wide distribution of P. spinipinnis at 

regional and temporal mesoscales in relation to oceanographic conditions. Specifically, to 

explore why Burmeister’s porpoise is present in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, we 

hypothesize that the distribution of P. spinipinnis, from Santa Catarina, southern Brazil 

(28°48’S, 49°12’W) to Paita Bay, northern Peru (05°01’S, 81ºW) is associated with 

oceanographic conditions (e.g., temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen) and circulation 

system (e.g., currents, upwelling and donwelling process), because these characteristics are 

directly related with seasonal productivity, and with prey distribution and abundance. 

 

Materials and Methods 

 

Study area 

The study area corresponds to the known distribution of P. spinipinnis, from Paita, Peru (5° 

01’S) in the Pacific coast to Santa Catarina, Brazil (28° 48’S) in the Atlantic coast of South 

America. Temperature (°C), salinity (psu) and dissolved oxygen (ml l-1)  data at surface and 

50m of depth, and between the coast and 20 nautical miles (nm) for the Atlantic and Pacific 

coast were analyzed to understand the seasonal variability of the oceanographic conditions 

associated with the distribution of P. spinipinnis. Although Burmeister’s porpoise is 

considered a coastal species (Brownell and Praderi, 1982, 1984; Goodall et al., 1995a), it has 



 

 

16

been found up to 50km from the coast of north-central Argentina, at a depth of 60m 

(Corcuera, 1991), and at least 20km from the coast of Valdivia, Chile (Oporto and Brieva, 

1994). Considering these antecedents, we used the 20-nm offshore boundary, because we 

analyzed the oceanographic conditions associated with the distribution of Burmeister’s 

porpoise at large- and mesoscale and not at fine-scale. If we had conducted the analyses at 

fine scale, we would only be describing the local variability and would not be able to explain 

the broad distribution of this species. 

For the spatial analysis, we used as oceanic boundary the isobath of 100m of depth in the 

Atlantic Ocean. In the Pacific Ocean, we fixed as oceanic boundary the distance of 20nm 

offshore, because the 100m isobath is very close to the coast (Figure 1). The definition of 

season used follows austral schedule: summer (January-March); fall (April-June); winter 

(July-September); and spring (October-December). However, only the summer and winter 

distributions will be discussed in detail, as the pattern found for temperature, salinity and 

dissolved oxygen concentration during the fall and spring corresponded to intermediate 

conditions between the patterns of summer and winter presented here. 

 

Data sources and processing 

Historical data of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen from 1965 to 2000 were used in 

the analysis of oceanographic conditions. The data were downloaded from the servers of 

WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) and NCEP (National Centers for 

Environmental Prediction). The program Ocean Data View (Schlitzer, 2004) was used for 

making the selection of all the stations used in this study, and for transforming all data into 

the same format. The next step was to export the oceanographic data to Microsoft Access, 

with the purpose of generating for each variable (temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen) 

the historical average every 5 minute of latitude and longitude for each season and depth 



 

 

17

(surface and 50m), respectively. After that, kriging with linear semi-variogram was used to 

generate georeferenced images using the program Surfer 8.0 (BOSS International, Madison, 

WI, USA). Finally, program TNTMips 6.7 Lite (MicroImages, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) was 

used for carrying out the spatial analysis of the unsupervised classification methods of self-

classification (cluster) using the images of temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen for each 

depth and season. This method is based on neuronal networking computing techniques, and 

was designed to recognize natural groups of spectral patterns in a sample of the input data and 

to produce a consistent class identification in responses to input of similar patterns during 

classification of the entire images (Microimages, 2001). Finally, an image was generated with 

the three parameters according to depth and season, respectively.  

 

Results 

General conditions 

A total of 104424 oceanographic stations were selected to carry out the analysis of the 

historical average conditions. The number of oceanographic stations for the Pacific and 

Atlantic were different. About 61% (64358) of the oceanographic stations corresponded to the 

Pacific. However, the numbers of stations for each season were similar, especially in the 

Pacific. The distribution the all oceanographic station used in this study is shown in Figure 2. 

The average historical data between the coast and 20nm showed a great variability in the three 

parameters analyzed (temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen) (Table 1). In summer, the 

maximum temperature observed at surface was 29.1°C and 26.6°C in the Atlantic and Pacific, 

respectively (Table 1). At 50m, the maximum temperature in summer was 24°C in the 

Atlantic and 26.3°C in the Pacific. The minimum temperatures (2.6-2.8°C) were registered at 

the surface in the Atlantic (in autumn) and Pacific (in summer) (Table 1). At 50m, the 



 

 

18

minimum temperature was lower in the Pacific (Table 1). Thermal inversions were also 

observed in the Pacific due to the influence of colder freshwaters.  

The maximum salinities (&gt;36psu) were registered at 50m for both the Atlantic and Pacific, 

respectively. In surface waters, the minimum salinities were observed in austral summer 

(0.040psu) for the Atlantic and austral spring (0.140psu) for Pacific (Table 1). 

In the Atlantic, the range of dissolved oxygen was from 2.99 to 8.00ml l-1, while that in the 

Pacific was from 0.02 to 10.98ml l-1. The minimum concentrations of dissolved oxygen were 

registered in the Pacific, both at the surface and 50m of depth (Table 1).  

 

 Spatial analysis 

-  Temperature 

The images of average temperature at the surface and 50m of depth in austral summer showed 

gradual increase in temperature from south to north (Figures 3a,d). In summer, the Pacific 

coast presented an increment of surface temperature (14°C to 22°C) from ? 41°S (off Isla 

Grande de Chiloé, Chile) at 05°S (off Paita, Peru). This increase was also observed from the 

coast to offshore (Figure 3a). The isotherms were semi-perpendicular to the coastline, which 

was associated with upwelling process. From 41°S to the Drake Passage the isotherms were 

perpendicular to the coast and the surface temperature decreased from 14°C to ?6°C (Figure 

3a). In the Atlantic, the surface temperature in summer was similar to that of the Pacific. At 

46°S, the isotherms change the orientation from semi-perpendicular to parallel to the coast, 

but a difference with the Pacific was that the temperature increased toward the coast (Figure 

3a).  

In the austral winter, the minimum surface temperature was similar (6°C) in both oceans. 

However, differences were observed in the maximum surface temperature in the Pacific and 

Atlantic coast. The isotherm of 14°C in the Atlantic coast was missing, while that in the 



 

 

19

Pacific was found at 28°S. In the Pacific between 5°S and 10°S, an intrusion of water above 

18°C was observed from offshore toward the coast. In the Atlantic, the isotherms were 

perpendicular to the coast, and associated with discharges of rivers, such as Río de la Plata 

(Figure 3c). 

The image of temperature at 50m of depth in summer and winter, showed that in the Pacific 

the isotherms tend to be perpendicular to the coast from the Drake Passage to near 29°S, with 

temperatures &gt;5°C and 14°C, respectively. However, lower temperatures were observed at the 

coast from 29°S toward north. In the Atlantic, from 50°S to the north, the isotherms presented 

a tendency to be parallel to the coast, and the temperature was greater than 10°C (Figures 

3b,d). 

 - Salinity  

In the Atlantic and Pacific, both at the surface and 50m, salinity increases from south to north. 

Higher salinities (? 35psu) were observed near the northern boundary of the study area off the 

Peruvian and Brazilian coasts (Figures 4a,d). In summer, the salinity off the Argentine coast 

at the surface and 50m was between 33-34psu. This was similar to the Chilean coast south of 

33°S (Figures 4a,b). However, in the Pacific the salinity increases gradually at the surface 

(&gt;35 psu) and offshore north of 26°S, but in winter this limit moves further northwards 

(Figures 4c,d). The minimum salinity observed reflects the contributions of fresh water from 

fjords, glaciers, and rivers, mainly in the Atlantic, where there is a great contribution of fresh 

water from the basin of the La Plata River. In the case of the Pacific, the lower surface 

salinities were observed in the zone of channels and fjords, due to the contributions of 

freshwater from precipitation, draining, rivers, and glacier melting. 

- Dissolved oxygen 

The dissolved oxygen concentration in the Atlantic and Pacific increases from the north 

southward, both at the surface and at 50m (Figures 5a,d). However, there is a decrease in 



 

 

20

dissolved oxygen from the surface to depth in the Pacific. The lower concentration of 

dissolved oxygen was associated with the influence of the OMZs, and in the coastal zone of 

the Peruvian coast, the upper limit of OMZs was closer to the surface. 

The Patagonia area presented the greater dissolved oxygen concentrations (&gt;6ml l-1) (Figures 

5a,d). These waters are mixed during the winter by the action of winds, which increase the 

thickness of the Ekman Layer.  

On the continental shelf of Argentina, the Malvinas Current transports more oxygenated water 

to the north (Figures 5c,d). Off the Brazilian and Uruguayan coasts the water is less 

oxygenated, between 4-6ml l-1, with a minimum near to 2ml l-1 in the area of Patos Lagoon, 

south Brazil (32°S; 49°W) (Figure 5b). In the Pacific, north of 40°S the dissolved oxygen 

concentration was between 4-6ml l-1 (Figures 5a,c), and near the coast at 50m upwelling water 

from the OMZs, with values&amp;lt;0.5ml l-1 was observed (Figures 5b,d).  

- Self-classification 

The self-classification method shows than the image obtained for the surface presented three 

groups (Figure 6). The first group was associated with more temperate and saline waters, and  

it was present in fall, winter and spring from northern Peru (5°S) to ?40°S in the Pacific 

(Figures 6b,c,d). In summer, this group presented a minimum distribution from 5° to 33°S 

(Figure 6a). Off the Atlantic coast, this group showed a minimum distribution in winter from 

38° to 28ºS (Figure 6c), and with fluctuations along the coast from La Plata River to the north, 

especially in summer and fall. 

The second group includes the austral waters, and their fluctuations in the annual cycle. In the 

Atlantic, this group was associated with the Malvinas Current in the four seasons, and in the 

Pacific it was associated with the Cape Horn Current in fall, winter, and spring (Figures 

6b,c,d). In summer, this group expands its distribution to the north (?40°S to 33°S), where 

there is the influence of the Humboldt Current and the upwelling waters (Figure 6a).  



 

 

21

The third group in the Pacific coast was associated with an intrusion of oceanic waters from 

offshore toward the Peruvian coast. In the Atlantic this group has a contribution of freshwater 

from the riverine basins discharging along the Uruguayan and Brazilian coasts (e.g . La Plata 

River, Patos Lagoon) as well as runoff (Figures 6a,b). The first and the second groups were 

present year-round, but the third group was absent in winter (Figure 6c).  

At 50m, the self-classification method showed the same groups observed at the surface 

(Figures 7a,b,c). However, in spring a fourth group was created in the austral zone from 

Magellan Strait in the Pacific to south of San Jorge Gulf, off Argentina, in the Atlantic 

(Figure 7d). 

Based on the results of this study, we propose three oceanographic areas relevant to the 

distribution of P. spinipinnis:  

(1) The first area, from Paita, northern Peru (5°S), to south of the Arauco Gulf, Chile 

(?39°S), has the influence of the Humboldt Current, which involves upwelling that 

carries water rich in nutrients, colder, more saline and low in oxygen, and also contains 

an oxygen minimum zone (Figure 8);  

(2) The second area, from south of Arauco Gulf to South of La Plata River (?38°S) shows 

the influence of Cape Horn and Malvinas Currents, and involves downwelling 

processes, and freshwater contributions from fjords, glaciers and rivers (Figure 8);  

(3) The third area, from La Plata River to Santa Catarina, Brazil (28°S) is characterized by 

the influence of the Brazil Currents, and the freshwater contributions of the basin of La 

Plata River and the estuarine system of Patos Lagoon (Figure 8). 

  

Discussion 

The variability of average historical data of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen 

analyzed in this study are associated with different processes related to the geographical 



 

 

22

position and the influence of seasonality. This has been described by several authors (e.g., 

Lima et al., 1996; Piola et al., 2000; Blanco et al., 2001; Rivas and Piola, 2002; Sabatini et 

al., 2004).    

Results from this study clearly show the influences of oceanographic conditions on the 

distribution of Burmeister’s porpoise in both oceans. The characterization of the 

oceanographic conditions showed that the northern boundary of the distribution of P. 

spinipinnis for the Pacific coast at Paita, Peru (5°S) is coincident with the westward turn of 

the Humboldt Current, as it is incorporated into the South Equatorial Current. In the Atlantic, 

the northern boundary seems associated with the Atlantic Subtropical Convergence (30-40°S), 

as was originally proposed by Brownell and Clapham (1999) and Goodall et al. (1995a). In 

addition, the high temperatures (&gt;24°C) and salinities (&gt;36psu) recorded at the surface and 

50m between the coast and the 20nm boundary were coincident with the known northern limit 

of the distribution of P. spinipinnis on both coasts of South America (Goodall et al., 1995a,b; 

Reyes and Van Waerebeek, 1995; Brownell and Clapham, 1999).  

The characterization of the oceanographic conditions from Paita, Peru, to Santa Catarina, 

Brazil, showed a clear separation in three major areas. The differences in distribution of P. 

spinipinnis between the different oceanographic areas is based on an assumption of seasonal 

variations of the parameters examined.  

The first oceanographic area, from Paita, northern Peru (5°S) to south of Arauco Gulf, Chile 

(?39°S) is characterized by the presence of the Humboldt Current and an OMZ, with an 

average temperature between 14-22°C, salinity between 34-35psu, and dissolved oxygen from 

values lower than 1 to 6ml l-1. These characteristics are coincident with the seasonal ranges of 

surface temperature and salinity observed by Blanco et al. (2001). 

The influence of the Humboldt Current System in the first area is very important, because a 

significant exchange of heat and CO2 takes place between the ocean and the atmosphere due 



 

 

23

to upwelling of sub-surface, cold, nutrient-rich, CO2 - saturated waters. This fertilization of 

the photic zone increases primary production and the uptake of CO2 (Escribano et al., 2003). 

The Humboldt Current System with its coastal upwelling ecosystem off Peru and Chile is 

recognized as a highly productive region, sustaining the large fisheries of anchovy and sardine 

(Alheit and Bernal, 1983; Mann and Lazier, 1991; Walsh, 1991). Burmeister’s porpoise in the 

upwelling system might be particularly vulnerable to local depletion as they inhabit a very 

rich, but unstable environment (e.g., due to recurring El Niño events). Detailed studies of 

stomach contents of porpoises from Peru and Chile have shown that their most common prey 

were principally anchovy (Eugraulis ringens), hake (Merluccius gayi), and jack mackerel 

(Trachurus murphyi) (Torres et al, 1992; Reyes and van Waerebeek, 1995). 

Although cetaceans are highly mobile predators and their distribution is dynamic, habitat 

selection often seems to correspond with hydrographic domains associated with bathymetric 

features (Baumgartner, 1997; Moore et al., 2000), so the assumption of some annual pattern 

of cetacean distribution and abundance seems warranted.  Probably, the presence of the OMZs 

in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, from the latitude of the Galápagos Islands (~1°S) to 

southern Chile (~40°S) (Gallardo, 1963; Rosenberg et al., 1983; Arntz et al., 1991), is an 

important factor in the separation of two oceanographic areas observed in this study for the 

Chilean coast, and its limit seems to be south of the Arauco Gulf (?39°S) (Gutierrez et al., 

2000). According with time series data in northern of Chile (1980 to 1997: JGOFS and 

FONDAP-HUMBOLDT Projects), the oxycline is located at 50m of depth at the coast, and at 

100m of depth in oceanic waters. However, this limit has been detected in shallower waters at 

10m during strong El Niño, as the event of 1997-1998.  

The upper limit of OMZs present a great vertical intra and interannual variability associated 

with dynamic processes in the system (Morales et al., 1999). The upper and lower boundaries 

of OMZs have been characterized as sites of enhanced biological and biogeochemical activity 



 

 

24

(Wisher et al., 1995), including the coupling of nitrification and denitrification processes 

(Anderson et al., 1982). In addition, OMZs represent an effective barrier of vertical 

distribution and diversity of plankton, micronekton, and benthic species or assemblages, 

though some organisms are adapted to these extreme conditions (Wisher et al., 1995).   

The second oceanographic area proposed here is from south of the Arauco Gulf, Chile to 

south of La Plata River, Argentina (?38°S). This group is characterized by the influence of 

the Cape Horn and Malvinas Currents, and freshwater contributions (especially from fjords, 

glaciers and the La Plata River Basin) with temperature values between 6°-22°C, salinity 

between 33-35psu and dissolved oxygen between 2-6ml l-1. The maximum record of 

temperature associated with a Burmeister's porpoise sighting ranged between 17.5° and 

19.5°C (summer) in San José Gulf, Argentina (Würsig and Würsig, 1980), and Tierra del 

Fuego to near Cape Horn, average from 4°C (winter) to 9°C (summer) (Goodall et al., 1995a). 

The low value of salinity recorded in spring off the Pacific coast was associated with the 

melting of glaciers at this time. The excess of precipitation in the Southeast Pacific and 

continental runoff from southern Chile reduce the salinity over the shelf of the Atlantic coast 

to values&amp;lt;33.9psu (Deacon, 1933; Lusquiños and Valdéz, 1971). Several authors observed 

the remarkable permanent salinity minimum existing off southern Chile (Silva and Neshyba, 

1979; Neshyba and Fonseca, 1980; Sievers and Nowlin, 1989; Silva et al., 1997). According 

to these authors, the main driving forcings in this zone are contributions of freshwater from 

rivers, runoff, rain and glaciers; mixing of freshwater with saline waters; subsurface advection 

of more saline waters with oceanic origin, and vertical mixing by wind shear.  

There are two types of freshwater discharges over the Patagonian shelf, in Argentina. The first 

is related to drainage of continental rivers along the coast of southern Patagonia, and the 

second is the inflow of diluted waters from the Magellan Strait (Panella et. al., 1991). 

Although there is only scant information about the magnitude of the influx of the relatively 



 

 

25

fresher waters from the Magellan Strait, the water mass structure of the Patagonian shelf is 

strongly influenced by a fresh water tongue, which has its salinity minimum in that region and 

is known as the Patagonian Current (Sabatini et al., 2004). This is similar to what was 

observed in this study (Figure 4).  

In the second oceanographic area we proposed, the salinity minimum (&gt;33psu) at 50m depth 

in the Atlantic indicates that the contributions of freshwater are concentrated at the surface, 

and do not reach 50m, with the exception of the low salinity observed in winter (31.93psu). 

This can be attributed to a stronger mixing of the water column that would allow the dilution 

of water at this depth with surface fresh waters. In the Pacific there was a larger contribution 

of fresh water in the water column, corresponding to that found by Dávila et al. (2002), who 

determined the large effect of freshwater offshore in fall. With regard to dissolved oxygen, the 

highest concentrations were found in the southern zone (for both Pacific and Atlantic coasts), 

and were associated with the turbulent mixing of the water column by the wind action. This 

mixing is more intense because of the continual passage of frontal systems, especially in the 

Pacific coast, where the concentrations are larger than in the Atlantic coast at 50m. 

In this area, sightings of Burmeister’s porpoise have been made at least 20km from coast of 

Valdivia, Chile, especially in winter when sardines move offshore (Oporto and Brieva, 1984), 

in mouths of rivers and estuaries (Aguayo, 1975), appear to be fairly common in bays off the 

intricate channels of Tierra del Fuego in the southernmost part of the range (Goodall et al., 

1990; 1995), in San José Gulf, Argentina (Würsig and Würsig, 1980). Heinrich et al. (2004) 

mention that Burmeister’s porpoises from Chiloé Archipelago (42°-43°S) seemed to prefer 

significantly deeper waters (mean depth=37m) and further from shore (mean distance to 

shore=963m).  

The third oceanographic area proposed here, from La Plata River to Santa Catarina, Brazil 

(28°S), is characterized by the influence of the Brazil Current, and the freshwater 



 

 

26

contributions of the La Plata River basin and the estuarine system of Patos Lagoon. This is 

coincident with that observed by Piola et al. (2000), who analyzed historical hydrographic 

data in the upper layer over the continental shelf off eastern South America, and concluded 

that there is a widespread influence of continental discharge, primarily from La Plata River 

Basin and locally from Patos Lagoon. 

During the austral winter, the low-salinity plume reaches 28°S, while in summer it is 

constrained to south of 32°S. The seasonal variability of the along shore extent of the low-

salinity plume, presumably induced by variations in the wind stress, is larger than the changes 

induced by the variability in river discharge.  

The Subtropical Convergence has enormous importance to the geographical distribution of the 

South American biota. This convergence, which in the summer is located at the latitude of 

Montevideo (Uruguay), can reach Florianópolis (Brazil) during winter, creating rich fishing 

(Guerrero et al., 1997). The zone between 30ºS and 40ºS has a high variability in physical and 

chemical properties and represents an ecotone of high biological diversity. Peaks of 

phytoplankton biomass have been found associated with frontal structures (Gayoso and 

Podestá, 1996). 

This would explain the occasional presence of P. spinipinnis in Brazil, because the three 

records of Burmeister’s porpoise for Brazil were in spring 1986, near the Uruçanga river 

mouth, Santa Catarina state (28°48’S) (Simões-Lopes and Ximenez, 1993). The second and 

third record were on the coast of Rio Grande do Sul, in summer 1986 (32°40’S; 52°26W) 

(Pinedo, 1989), and summer 2000 off Farol Berta (30°23.9'S; 50°17.2’W) (Ignacio Moreno, 

GEMARS, pers. comm.). These records were coincident with the intrusion of colder and less 

saline waters northwards. According to Silva et al. (1984), in these latitudes, salinities 

between 33-36psu, and the surface temperature tends to be lower near shore (16-22°C), 

gradually rising in deeper waters offshore (23-27°C). In addition, Pimenta (2001) analyzed 



 

 

27

the variability of the La Plata plume by simulations with a numerical model as a function of 

wind stress and intensity of river discharge, including the effect of La Niña and El Niño 

periods and found that the average speed of the plume along the shore was directly related to 

the intensity of the outflow, and the northward extent of the plume along the shelf varied from 

850km to 1550km, for La Niña and El Niño, respectively. Considering these conditions, we 

propose that the habitat of Burmeister’s porpoise in the Atlantic is associated with the 

Subtropical Convergence. When intrusions of colder and less saline waters occur northwards, 

P. spinipinnis can move to the north, reaching the latitude of Florianopolis (28°48’S; 

49°12’W), southern Brazil.  Silva et al. (1984) reveal upwelling areas to the north of the Santa 

Catarina coast, as well as in the region between Santa Marta Cape and Florianópolis.  

The movements of cetaceans and other mobile marine predators are driven primarily by 

physical oceanographic conditions, particularly at lower trophic levels (Angel, 1994; Fiedler 

et al., 1986; Benson et al., 2002). The feeding ecology of Burmeister’s porpoise is not well 

known, but regional differences in feeding habits may be likely.  

Considering the existing information on Burmeister’s porpoise based on sightings, strandings 

and incidental captures (Corcuera et al., 1995; Goodall et al., 1995a,b; Reyes and Van 

Waerebeek, 1995;) from Paita, Peru to Santa Catarina, Brazil, and the oceanographic 

characterization of habitat of P. spinipinnis obtained in this study, we propose that 

Burmeister’s porpoise presents a continuous distribution throughout this range from Paita, 

Peru, to the La Plata River Basin, Argentina, being able to reach Uruguayan and Brazilian 

waters under certain oceanographic conditions (e.g., intrusion of colder and less saline waters 

toward the north associated to the Subtropical Convergence). 

Better information on spatial and temporal variation of the diet and habit use of P. spinipinnis, 

combined with feeding behaviour are necessary to improve current models of prey 

consumption. The results provide information of potential use in understanding the ecology of 



 

 

28

Burmeister’s porpoise, and hopefully will help managers address concerns about the potential 

impacts on this species due to anthropogenic activity. The analyses presented in this study 

may also provide relevant habitat information for a number of other marine mammal species 

present in the study area. 

  

Conclusions 

Our results support a clear separation of the distribution of Burmeister’s porpoise into three 

large areas: (1) from Paita, northern Peru (5°S), to south of the Arauco Gulf, Chile (?39°S) 

with the influence of the Humboldt Current and OMZ; (2) from south of Arauco Gulf to south 

of La Plata River, Argentina, (?38°S) associated with the Cape Horn and Malvinas Currents, 

as well as freshwater contributions; (3) from La Plata River to Santa Catarina, Brazil (28°S), 

with the influence of the Brazil Current, and the contributions of freshwater from La Plata 

River Basin and the estuarine system of Patos Lagoon, south Brazil. The presence of OMZ is 

an important factor in the separation into two groups off the Chilean coast (?39°S). The 

characterization of the oceanographic conditions showed that the northern boundary of the 

distribution of P. spinipinnis for the Pacific coast at Paita (5°S) is coincident with the 

westward turn of the Humboldt Current, as it is incorporated into the South Equatorial 

Current. Off the Atlantic coast, the northern boundary seems associated with the Atlantic 

Subtropical Convergence (30-40°S). The high temperatures (&gt;24°C) and salinities (&gt;36psu) 

registered at the surface and at 50m between the coasts and the 20nm boundary were 

coincident with the known northern limit of the distribution of this species on both coasts of 

South America. In addition, we propose that Burmeister’s porpoise presents a continuous 

distribution throughout this range from Paita, Peru to La Plata River Basin, Argentina, being 

able to reach Uruguayan and Brazilian waters under certain oceanographic conditions (e.g., 



 

 

29

intrusion of colder and less saline waters toward the north associated to the Subtropical 

Convergence).

ABSTRACT 
 

A total of 89 teeth from P. spinipinnis from museums and scientific collections from Peru, 

Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil were analyzed. Thin 25 ?m sections were used to 

describe Growth Layer Groups, accessory layers and tooth anomalies. The number of dentinal 

GLGs in the sample ranged from 0 to 10. In cementum, GLGs were absent in most of the 

individuals. Measurements in dentine showed sexual dimorphism in the first GLG (P = 

0.0013, df = 40, t-value=3.4436). The first GLG showed significant difference by geographic 

area between Peru and the Atlantic specimens (P = 0.0069, df = 39, t-test = 2.8483), and the 

central accessory layer in the first GLG also presented a significant difference between Chile 

and the Atlantic specimens (P = 0.006, df = 8, t-test = 3.7026). Three types of anomalies 

(marker lines, cemental disturbance and dentinal resorption) were recorded in teeth of seven 

individuals from Peru collected between 1984 to 1998. The marker lines seem to be 

associated with environmental factors, because these marker lines are coincident with “El 

Niño” events. 

 

Key words: Phocoena spinipinnis, Burmeister’s porpoise, GLGs, age estimation, growth 

layers, ENSO, marker lines, anomalies.

INTRODUCTION 

Age determination in any animal population is fundamental for understanding the biology 

of individuals and population dynamics, and provides useful information for conservation and 

management procedures (e.g. Scheffer and Myrick 1980, Molina-Schiller and Pinedo 2004).  

The use of teeth in age determination in cetaceans has been addressed generally (Perrin and 

Myrick, 1980). For porpoises, different techniques have been used for age determination,  

e.g., harbour porpoise, Phocoena phocoena (Nielsen 1972, Gaskin and Blair 1977, van 

Utrecht 1978, Stuart and Morejohn 1980, Noldus and de Klerk 1984, Manzanilla 1987, Watts 

and Gaskin 1989, Read 1990, Bjørge et al. 1995, Hohn and Lockyer 1995, Kvam 1995), 

Burmeister’s porpoise, Phocoena spinipinnis (Manzanilla 1987; Crespo et al. 19941; Corcuera 

et al. 1995), finless porpoise, Neophocaena phocaenoides (Shirakihara et al. 1993).  

Potential information that might be inferred from teeth includes general health, maturity, 

sex, reproductive history and the occurrence of environmental events affecting general status 

(Lockyer 1995). Mineralization anomalies in teeth as a mean for identifying stress during the 

animal’s lifetime, and the possibility of such interpretations from variations in zonation and 

GLGs patterns in teeth have been raised by several researchers, e.g., parturition lines  

(Klevezal’ and Myrick 1984), suckling lines (Bengtson 1988) and hypocalcified lines 

associated with the El Niño phenomenon off Peru (Manzanilla 1989). The interpretation of 

mineralization anomalies may indicate genetic stock differences or different types and levels 

of environmental stress (Lockyer 1995, 1999). 

Burmeister’s porpoise is endemic to coastal waters of South America (Brownell and Praderi 

1982; Reeves et al. 2003). Information about life history, abundance, distribution,

movements, population structure and trends is limited (Corcuera et al. 1995, Goodall et al. 

1995a, Reyes and Van Waerebeeck 1995, Reeves et al. 2003). Furthermore, it is unclear 

whether the species is present continuously throughout its range (Goodall et al. 1995b, 

Corcuera et al. 1995, Reeves et al. 2003). It has been suggested that Pacific and Atlantic 

Burmeister’s porpoise comprise two different stocks, a hypothesis which is consistent with 

size differences observed between individuals from Northern Argentina and Peru-Chile 

(Brownell and Praderi 1984, Corcuera et al. 1995). Recent studies include genetic 

differentiation among Burmeister’s porpoises from Peru and Chile-Argentina (Rosa et al. 

2005), geographic variation among skulls from Peru, Chile and Atlantic (Argentina, Brazil, 

and Uruguay) (Molina-Schiller 2006).  

The goal of the present study was to define, identify, and characterize growth layer groups 

(GLGs) and to explore possible variations of GLGs patterns among Burmeister’s porpoises 

from different localities along the Pacific (Peru and Chile) and Atlantic coast of South 

America. 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

The sample 

Teeth of 89 P. spinipinnis (27 females, 45 males, and 17 of unknown sex) were examined 

to characterize growth layers (Fig. 1, Table 1). The teeth were obtained from museums and 

scientific collections from the following locations and years: Peru, 52 porpoises (from 7 

localities), were a mixture from incidentally, directly-caught or stranded at seven localities du 

ring the period 1984 to 2001, mainly from 1984-1987, and 1998-2001; Chile samples from 3 

localities consisted of 22 incidentally caught or stranded porpoises during the years 1986 to 

2004, including two additional individuals collected from central Chile in 1894 and 1967; 

Argentina samples included 12 individuals from 6 localities collected from incidental catch 



 

 

54

and stranding events during the period 1975 to 2002, with an additional specimen collected in 

1903; Brazilian samples comprised two porpoises stranded at two localities on 1986 and 

2000, respectively; a single stranded specimen from Uruguay was obtained in 2002 (Fig. 1, 

Table 1).  

No a prori selection of specimens using sex or length class was made. The sexes were 

known (n = 36) or estimated (n = 37) by discriminant functions from skulls with know sex 

(Molina-Schiller 2006).  

 

Tooth preparation and age determination 

Most of the teeth were stored dry for more than 28 years, and exceptionally teeth of three 

individuals were stored dry for more than one hundred years. Due to these procedures, a large 

number of teeth became very dry, cracked and split.  

For most individuals at least one tooth was available for preparation. The teeth were 

decalcified with RDO®, a fast commercial decalcifier, composed of a mixture of acids (see 

Myrick et al. 1983). Decalcification time ranged from 1 to 12 h, depending on the size or 

volume of the tooth (i.e., teeth from smaller animals required less time using the RDO guide 

to decalcification). The sections were considered ready when flexible, bending in the center, 

and then were rinsed in running tap water for 24 h. From each tooth, longitudinal thin sections 

25 ?m thick were obtained using a freezing microtome, and the teeth were cutting according 

to the criterion used by Scheffer and Myrick (1980), Bjørge et al. (1995), Hohn and Lockyer 

(1995), and Kvam (1995). Then two or three on-center sections were stained free-floating in 

100 ml Harris’s haematoxylin for 5 min and rinsed in running tap water for 24 h to eliminate 

excess of stain (Molina and Oporto 1993). Tooth sections were immersed in 50 % and 100 % 

glycerine for 30 min, respectively, to dehydrate and were mounted on glass slides in pure 

glycerine (Myrick et al. 1983, Hohn et al. 1989).  



 

 

55

The GLGs in the dentine and cementum were read using a compound microscope 10-50X 

under transmitted light. The interpretation of annual layer groups is based on Scheffer and 

Myrick (1980) and Nielsen (1972). This author observed in P. phocoena the equivalence of a 

GLG for every year of age, using tetracycline marking in one known-age individual. 

Considering that the GLG deposition patterns have not been established for P. spinipinnist, in 

this study we also assumed that one GLG represent one year of growth.   

Only on-center and “close-to-center” sections were used for GLG readings. “Close-to-

center” sections were defined according to Pinedo and Hohn (2000) (i.e., apex of GLGs round 

and with 60 % of the whole extension of the pulp cavity visible). The resolution of each GLG 

was evaluated according to the conspicuousness of boundary layers, consistency and 

continuity of layers along the whole length of the tooth section in the dentine and cementum 

(Hohn et al. 1989, Pinedo and Hohn 2000, Molina-Schiller and Pinedo 2004). Two GLGs 

readings were conducted by the first author with intervals of at least two weeks. When 

differences were found, a third reading was performed and selected, under the assumption that 

skill and accuracy increased with time.  

In dentine, four measurements were taken perpendicularly to the bottom of the neonatal line 

using an ocular micrometer in a compound microscope (Carl Zeiss) with transmitted light at 

powers from 10 to 50X (see Fig. 2). The neonatal line was used as reference to measure the 

first GLG. The second and third GLGs were measured using the previous GLG as reference. 

In addition, the first accessory layer on the first GLG was measured (Fig. 2A). Cementum 

GLGs were counted, but not measured.  

 

Statistical analyses 

The thickness (relative widths) of the first three GLGs and accessory layer on the first GLG 

were analized by geographic area (Peru, Chile and Atlantic) and sex. Differences between 



 

 

56

means were analised by Student t-test for independent samples by groups, and two-way 

analysis of variance was applied to test interaction between sex and geographic area for each 

measurement (Zar 1999). All statistical analyses were performed using the software Statistics 

6.0 for Windows. The teeth from specimens with unknown sex were not included in statistical 

analyses. 

The three geographic area (Peru, Chile and Atlantic) defined in this study were based in 

studies of geographic variation of skulls of P. spinipinnis psysically mature (Molina-Schiller 

2006). In that study, discriminat analyses and canonical analyses showed significant 

differences (? = 0.05) between skull from Peru (n = 60), Chile (n = 28), and Atlantic (n=14). 

In addition, samples from Argentina (n = 11), Uruguay (n = 2) and Brazil (n = 1) were 

examined, and the two-way analysis of variance indicated no difference between localities at 

?=0.05. Therefore, the specimens from Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay were pooled in a 

single group named “Atlantic”.  

 

Anomalies 

Each tooth specimen was examined to register the anomaly type, number and position, sex 

and geographic area. Five major categories of mineralization anomaly were defined: pulp 

stones, marker lines, mineralization interference, dentinal resorption and cemental disturbance 

(Myrick 1988, Lockyer 1993, 1995, 1999). At least two teeth were examined when the 

anomaly was registered, to confirm that different teeth from the same individual presented 

similar growth anomalies and patterns.

RESULTS 

Age frequency distribution 

The Student t-test showed that the age frequency distribution by sex was not significant 

between geographic areas (P &gt; 0.05). The maximum number of GLGs presented in the 

dentine was ten for both females and males from Peru. In the Atlantic sample the oldest 

female had 9 GLGs and the oldest male had 7 GLGs. In Chile the maximum number of GLGs 

in males was 7 and females 5 GLGs (Table 1). In all teeth examined the pulp cavity was not 

completely occluded. Due to this fact, all the age obtained here were based in dentinal GLGs. 

  

Dentine  

In dentine, the neonatal line was observed as a narrow translucent layer (about 15 ?m) in all 

individuals. The conspicuousness of the neonatal line allowed its use as a point of reference in 

the measurement of the first GLGs (Fig. 2A).  

The first GLG was formed by an opaque layer followed by a translucent (or unstainable) 

layer. The boundary of the first GLG was easy to identify due to the difference in intensity of 

the coloration between the first and second GLGs (Figs 2A, B, C).  

The Student t-test showed sexual dimorphism in relative width of first GLG (P = 0.0013, df 

= 40, t-value = 3.4436), with males grater than females (Table 2). This value was larger in 

males from Chile (380 ?m, n = 3), followed by those from Peru (371.30 ?m, n = 23), and the 

Atlantic males (362.50 ?m, n = 2). In females, the relative width of the first GLG was larger 

in a single female from Chile (350 ?m, n = 1), followed by those from Peru (348.33 ?m, n = 

6), and the Atlantic (312.86 ?m, n = 7) (Table 2). In addition, the relative width of first GLG 

showed significant difference by geographic area between Peru and the Atlantic specimens (P 

= 0.0069, df = 39, t-test = 2.8483) (Table 2). 



 

 

58

About mid-way through the first GLG a distinct accessory layer was observed in some 

individuals (Figs 2A, B, C), however, accessory layer were more prevalent in teeth of males 

from Peru (n = 11), and absent in females from Peru (Table 2). The accessory layer of the first 

GLG can cause problems, as it can be erroneously considered as boundary between the first 

and second GLGs. One of the criteria used to distinguish accessory layers was to follow the 

line of the GLG until the bottom of the tooth. In most cases accessory layers finished before 

reaching half the length of the root. The mean distance between the central accessory layer on 

the first GLG and the neonatal line was larger in males than in females, and presented 

significative differences between Chile and the Atlantic porpoises (P = 0.006, df = 8, t-test = 

3.7026) (Table 2).  

In the second GLG the opaque and translucent layers were more defined, and the 

identification of the limit between the second and the third GLGs was usually detected by the 

intense coloration of the opaque layer (Figs 2A, B, C). The second GLGs was narrower than 

the first GLG, and although the relative width was larger in teeth of porpoises from Peru that 

those from Chile and the Atlantic, the differences were no significative (Table 2).  

The third GLG was measured similarly to the previous GLGs (Figs 2A, B, C). In general, 

the males showed relative width larger than females and the third GLGs were larger in teeth 

from Peru, followed by individuals from the Atlantic and Chile (Table 2).    

 

Cementum 

In cementum, the GLGs were observed as a thin opaque layer followed by a thick translucent 

layer (Fig. 2A). However, the GLGs were visible in few individuals (n=8). In addition, the 

number of GLGs in cementum tended not to correspond in all cases with the number of GLGs 

in dentine (Figs 2, 3A, 3C).  

 



 

 

59

Anomalies  

Three types of anomalies (marker lines, cemental disturbance and dentinal resorption) were 

recorded in teeth of P. spinipinnis (Table 3). The incidence of anomalies was observed only in 

seven individuals (five males and two females) from Peru (n = 52) collected between 1984 

and 1998 (for two individuals the date of collection was unknown) (Table 3). Anomalies were 

generally noticed in older specimens with more than 6 GLGs, and 22 (42.3 %) of 

Burmeister’s porpoises from Peru were older than 6 yearsr of age (Table 1). All individuals 

analyzed were physically mature (Molina-Schiller 2006), except the female NN5 with 5.5 

years of age. Data on sexual maturity are unknown, except for the sexually mature male JSM 

227 (Manzanilla 1987). 

Marker lines were recorded in six (11.5 %, n = 52) of the 52 animals from Peru, but were 

absent in samples from other areas (Table 3). This anomaly was observed as a narrow (about 

15 ?m) and waving translucent layer (hipocalcified line) in all individuals (Fig. 3). The 

number and position of marker lines were noted (Table 3). This anomaly was observed in four 

males with ages between 3.5 – 9 years of age, and two females of 5.5 and 7.5 years of age 

(Table 3, Figs 3A, B, C, D, 4A). The information on date of death, age at death and sequential 

ages where marker lines occurred permitted a calculation of the calendar year in which the 

anomaly appeared in the tooth (Table 3). In particular, a marker line appears in the same years 

(1982 to 1984) for several Burmeister’s porpoise (Table 3). In addition, the male (JSM 227) 

presented two marker lines in the dentine (Table 3, Figs 3A, B). This hypocalcified marker 

line seems to be associated with environmental factors, because the dates of formation of 

these marker lines are coincident with “El Niño” Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events (Table 

3).   



 

 

60

Teeth from four (7.7 %, n = 52) Peruvian porpoises showed cemental disturbance (Table 3; 

Fig. 4B, C, D), while dentinal resorption was registered in a single male (1.9 %, n = 52) 

(Table 3, Fig. 4A). 

 

DISCUSSION 

The age frequency distribution showed that the porpoises forms Peru are older than 

specimens from Chile and Atlantic, whereas those females from Chile were younger than 

porpoises from Atlantic; however, these differences were not significative, possibly due to 

small size sample. In general, few young individuals (less than 2 years) were observed in the 

sample, perhaps this has relation with the different methods of collect of Burmeister´s 

porpoises (stranding; gillnet incidental or direct mortality). 

The GLGs patterns observed for P. spinipinnis is similar to those previously described for 

other porpoises, e.g., Phocoena phocoena (Nielsen 1972, Kvam 1995, Gaskin and Blair 1977, 

Scheffer and Myrick 1980, Bjørge et al. 1995), Phocoena spinipinnis (Manzanilla 1987, 

Corcuera et al. 1995). The first GLG appears to be the most complicated in terms of growth, 

frequently with a pronounced stained accessory layer at the mid-zone, which could be 

misinterpreted as the end of the first GLG. This accessory lamina has previously been 

observed in Tursiops truncatus (Hohn 1980), Globicephala macrorhynchus (Kasuya and 

Matsui 1984, Lockyer 1993), Inia geoffrensis (Silva 1995), Cephalorhynchus eutropia 

(Molina and Oporto 1993, Molina and Reyes 1996), Pontoporia blainvillei (Pinedo and Hohn 

2000), and Arctocephalus australis (Molina-Schiller and Pinedo 2004).  

The GLGs observed in cementum were few visible in most of the individuals. For this 

reason, it was not possible to correlate the number of layers in dentine with the number of 

layer in the cementum. This has also been observed in P. phocoena (Nielsen 1972, Kvam 



 

 

61

1995), C. eutropia (Molina and Oporto 1993). On the other hand, is possible that the cemental 

thickness is correlated with the placement in the jaw and the related stresses.  

The relative width of the first GLG was larger in males than in females from three 

geographic areas, evidencing sexual dimorphism in teeth of P. spinipinnis. Van Utrecht 

(1969) and Nielsen (1972) using other methods, also found sexual dimorphism on teeth of P. 

phocoena. These authors showed a corresponding difference for males and females in the 

distance between the cervical limit of the cementum and the point where the neonatal line 

ends against the cementum.  

Geographic variation was observed in the relative width of first GLG between Peru and the 

Atlantic porpoises, and the mean distance between the central accessory layer on the first 

GLG and the neonatal line presented significative differences between Chile and the Atlantic 

porpoises. Although, the sample size of teeth of P. spinipinnis from Peru was larger than 

sample size from Chile and Atlantic, the relative width of the first GLG might be used as a 

guide to geographical variation between specimens from Peru and the Atlantic coast. Some 

evidences suggest that the characteristics of GLGs seem to differ in animals from various 

regions (Bjørge et al. 1995). These differences are probably related to environmental factors. 

Analyses of historical data (1965-2000) of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen (0 and 

50m depth) were analyzed to understand the seasonal variability of the oceanographic 

conditions associated with the distribution of P. spinipinnis from Paita (05°01’S, 81ºW)-Peru 

to Santa Catarina (28°48’S, 49°12’W)-Brazil (Molina-Schiller et al. 2005). These authors, 

proposed three oceanographic areas: (1) from Paita to south of Arauco Gulf-Chile, that has the 

influence of Humboldt Current, and an oxygen minimum zone (OMZ); (2) from south of 

Arauco Gulf to South of La Plata River, showing the influence of Cape Horn and Malvinas 

currents, respectively, as well as downwelling processes, freshwater contributions from fjords, 

glaciers and rivers; and (3) from La Plata River to Santa Catarina which is characterized by 



 

 

62

the influence of Brazil Currents, and the freshwater contributions of the hydrographic basin of 

the La Plata River and the estuarine system of Patos Lagoon. On the other hand, the results 

obtained in this study are coincident with differences in morphometrics between skulls of 

mature physically P. spinipinnis from Peru and Chile (from San Antonio ~33º 30'S to south), 

and between skulls from Peru and the Atlantic coast (Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay) 

(Molina-Schiller 2006), and Rosa et al. (2005) has shown genetic differentiation among 

Burmeister’s porpoises from Peru and Chile-Argentina.  

Although measurements of GLGs obtained in this study were useful as guidelines for 

defining GLGs in dentine and to explore possible variations of GLGs among Burmeister’s 

porpoises from different localities along the South America coast, they should be used with 

caution. The true definition and validation of GLGs can only be determined when the animals 

are time-marked with tetracycline or other periodic extractions). However, measurements and 

relative widths of GLGs are useful as guidelines, reducing the probability of interpreting 

accessory layers as limits of GLGs (Hohn et al. 1989, Pinedo and Hohn 2000). In addition, it 

is necessary to mention that the differences in relative width of the first GLG and central 

accessory lamina by geographic area and sex are an initial analysis. In addition, we have been 

particularly interested in knowing the growth layer patterns of teeth from the north-central 

Chilean coast, and evaluating possible differences with Burmeister’s porpoise from Peru.  

Three types of mineralization anomalies (marker lines, dentinal resorption and cemental 

disturbance) can be recognized in Burmeister’s porpoise, but a low incidence of anomalies in 

teeth P. spinipinnis was evident. The anomalies were only registered in 13.5  % (n = 7) of all 

samples from Peru (n = 52). As might be expected, the incidence of anomalies tends to 

increase with age, but each type has a different level of incidence. In general, the anomaly 

type and patterns of incidence in the two sexes were similar for marker lines and cemental 

disturbance. This suggests that in general, susceptibility to the causative factors of these 



 

 

63

anomalies is not sex-specific. Dentinal resorption was only registered in a single individual. 

By contrast Myrick (1988) found that resorption was highest in female Stenella longirostris, 

and Lockyer (1993) observed that incidence of dentinal resorption and cemental disturbance 

appears to be greater in males of G. macrorhynchus.  

The generally low incidence of anomalies suggests that occurrence may be both uncommon 

and spontaneous (Lockyer 1995). The types of anomaly may be inter-related, and affected to 

varying degrees by the same internal and/or external factors (Lockyer 1993).  

The marker line identified in this study is a waving hypocalcified layer of 15 µm similar in 

thickness to the neonatal line. The appearance of marker lines might be associated with 

interruption or change in regular feeding habits, caused by environmental events, because the 

formation of these marker lines is coincident with “El Niño” events. The Humboldt Current 

System with its coastal upwelling ecosystem off Peru and Chile is recognized as a highly 

productive region, sustaining the large fisheries of anchovy and sardine (Alheit and Bernal 

1993, Walsh 1991, Mann and Lazier 1991). Burmeister’s porpoise in the upwelling system 

might be particularly vulnerable to local depletion as they inhabit a very rich, but unstable 

environment (e.g., recurrent El Niño events), because El Niño is more intense along the 

Peruvian coast, than along the Chilean coast. This might explain the lack of marker lines in 

teeth of P. spinipinnis from central Chile and the Atlantic coast. 

Manzanilla (1989) reported a correlation in timing of the appearance of hypocalcified 

dentinal layers in teeth of dusky dolphins, Lagenorhynchus obscurus, off Peru with the El 

Niño event of 1982-83. The anomalous layer, described as the “El Niño mark” (ENM) 

comprised of a pair of hypocalcified incremental layers about 75 µm wide within the 1983 

GLG. The feature appeared predominantly, but not exclusively, in adult females. Manzanilla 

ascribed dietary deficiencies as the cause of the tooth anomalies. Teeth of other species did 

not display ENM’s. Although the anomalous layer observed by Manzanilla (1987) showed 



 

 

64

characteristic similar to marker line observed in this study, differences in the thickness were 

evident. On the other hand, this author did not find anomalies in teeth of P. spinipinnis, 

whereas we found a marker line of 15 µm in the adult male specimen, JSM 227, analyzed by 

Manzanilla (1987). Probably these differences have relation with the accuracy of the 

technique used in this study, and consequently more conspicuousness of GLGs. 

Other evidence of a connection between tooth anomalies and environmental factors is the 

study realized by Lockyer (1993) on marker lines in teeth of free-living Globicephala melas 

mass-stranded off Iceland and Faroes, and the independent correlation of appearance of such 

lines in particular years in animals separated both in time and geographic space in the 

northeast Atlantic. This may be indicative of an external environmental crisis, similar in 

impact to the El Niño event off Peru. If the anomalies in teeth (e.g. marker lines) can be 

associated with environmental events, it would be a powerful tool to analyze climate changes 

and to interpret life history events.

ABSTRACT   

Skulls from 142 Burmeister’s porpoises Phocoena spinipinnis (27 males, 18 females and 97 

of unknown sex) deposited in museums, personal and scientific collections in Peru, Chile, 

Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil were analyzed. Twenty-eight cranial measurements were used 

to explore sexual dimorphism, and the growth pattern of P. spinipinnis. Discriminant 

functions were obtained for males and females for which sex was known. The growth layers 

groups (GLGs) in the dentine from teeth were counted. The oldest male and female were both 

10 years of age. Growth parameter values obtained by Gompertz model fitted to condylobasal 

length–at-age of males and females P. spinipinnis showed a differentiated development 

between sexes. In females, only this character presented a high correlation with age (r?0.80). 

The asymptotic growth at 95% was estimated for each variable. In males, differences were 

observed in the stabilization of the asymptotic growth of the variables selected with r?0.80. 

Considering that the median age of all variables selected was 3 years, we suggest that males 

attain physical maturity about the 3 years of age. We considered appropriate the use of the 

asymptotic length attained at 95% of condylobasal length as a criteria of attainment of 

physical maturity in the skull of P. spinipinnis. Thus, the males attain physical maturity when 

the condylobasal length is ? 266mm, while that the females attain physical maturity when the 

condylobasal length is ? 277mm. Hotelling T2 test and discriminant functions using metric 

characters showed sexual dimorphism both in physically mature and physically immature 

skulls. Discriminant functions were also obtained for all skulls according to the physical

RESUMEN   

Cráneos de 142 marsopas espinosas Phocoena spinipinnis (27 machos, 18 hembras y 97 de 

sexo desconocido) depositados en museos, colecciones personales y científicas de Perú, Chile, 

Argentina, Uruguay y Brasil fueron analizados. Veintiocho mediciones craneales fueron 

utilizadas para explorar el dimorfismo sexual y el patrón de crecimiento. Funciones 

discriminantes fueron obtenidas para machos y hembras de sexo conocido. Fueron contados 

los Grupos de Capas de Crecimiento (GLGs) en la dentina de los dientes. La edad máxima 

registrada para ambos sexos fue de 10 años. Los parámetros de crecimiento obtenidos por el 

modelo de Gompertz en la longitud condylobasal de machos y hembras de P. spinipinnis 

mostraron un desarrollo diferenciado entre sexos. En las hembras, sólo esta variable presentó 

una alta correlación con la edad (r?0.80). Para cada variable se estimó el crecimiento 

asintótico al 95%. En machos, se observaron  diferencias en la estabilización del crecimiento 

asintótico de las variables seleccionadas con r?0.80. Considerando que la mediana de la edad 

de todas las variables seleccionadas fue de 3 años, se sugiere que los machos alcanzarían la 

madurez física alrededor de los 3 años de edad. Se considera además que el uso de la longitud 

condylobasal al 95% como criterio de madurez física en el cráneo de P. spinipinnis es 

apropiado. De esta forma, los machos alcanzarían la madurez física cuando la longitud 

condylobasal es ?266mm, mientras que las hembras alcanzarían la madurez física cuando la 

longitud condylobasal es ?277mm. Utilizando caracteres métricos, el test Hotelling T2 y 

funciones discriminantes mostraron dimorfismo sexual en cráneos físicamente adultos y 

físicamente jóvenes. Funciones discriminantes también fueron obtenidas para todos los 

cráneos según la madurez física. El dimorfismo sexual observado en cráneos de adultos 

mostró que las hembras de P. spinipinnis son de mayor tamaño que los machos.

INTRODUCTION  

Life-history studies include growth in size and the schedules of transitions between 

developmental stages as important elements of the relationships between organisms and their 

environment (Roff 1992, Stearns 1992, Klingenberg 1996). The study of somatic growth is 

also very important in order to understand the biology of a species, as well as being a tool for 

stock identification (Barreto &amp;amp; Rosas 2006). The use of growth models allows its 

parameterization, and is a useful tool for the comparison of data on growth (Gulland 1976).  

The quantitative description of growth curves for morphometric characters gives a basis for 

assessing the ontogenetic patterns underlying differences in morphological structure 

(Creighton &amp;amp; Strauss 1986). Several growth models have been used in marine mammals 

studies. The Gompertz model has been used to describe growth in belugas, Delphinapterus 

leucas (Stewart 1994); harp seals, Phoca groenlandica (Innes et al. 1981), and some 

Pinnipeds species (McLaren 1993), and franciscana, Pontoporia blainvillei (Ramos et al. 

2002). The von Bertalanffy growth model has been widely used to describe asymptotic 

growth in fishes (Misra 1986), as well as to a variety of long-live mammals such as polar 

bears, Ursus maritimus, harbour porpoise, Phocoena phocoena, harp seal, Phoca 

groenlandica, South American sea lion, Otaria flavescens, South American fur seal, 

Arctocephalus australis, walrus, Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus, and bottlenose dolphin, 

Tursiops truncatus (Kinsgsley  1979, Stuart &amp;amp;  Morejohn 1980, Innes et al. 1981, Rosas 1989, 

Molina-Schiller and Pinedo 2004, Knutsen and Born 1991, Barreto 2000). Richards growth 

model has been used in Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus (Garlich-Miller &amp;amp; Stewart 1998). In 

taxonomical and stock identification studies, it is recommended that comparisons among 

different geographic populations be preceded by identification of the individual variation in 

adults that occur within populations (Perrin 1984, Schnell et al. 1985). However, before 



   
 
 

 

84

identifying variation at the population levels, studies of the ontogenetic variation and age 

estimation are required to select the physically mature individuals to avoid selecting traits 

related with development, i.e., those expressed by physically immature individuals (Pinedo 

1991, Klingenberg 1996, Calzada et al. 1997, Brunner 2000, Molina-Schiller &amp;amp; Pinedo 2004, 

Sanfelice 2003).  

Burmeister’s porpoise, Phocoena spinipinnis is an endemic species of South America 

(Brownell &amp;amp; Praderi 1982; Reeves et al. 2003). Information about life history, distribution, 

movements, and population structure is limited (Corcuera et al. 1995, Goodall et al. 1995a, 

Reyes &amp;amp; Van Waerebeeck 1995, Reeves et al. 2003). Differences in size were observed 

between Burmeister’s porpoises from northern Argentina and Peru-Chile, and it was 

suggested that Pacific and Atlantic Burmeister’s porpoises comprise two different stocks 

(Brownell &amp;amp; Praderi 1984, Corcuera et al. 1995). Recently Rosa et al. (2005) observed 

genetic differentiation among Burmeister’s porpoises from Peru and Chile-Argentina.   

Although skull description and some cranial morphometrics of Burmeister’s porpoises have 

been published (e.g., Burmeister, 1865; Allen, 1925; Noble and Fraser, 1971; Praderi, 1971; 

Pilleri and Gihr, 1972, 1974; Brownell and Praderi, 1982, 1984; Pinedo, 1989; Simões-Lopes 

and Ximénez, 1989; Reyes and Van Waerebeek, 1995) most reports were based on either a 

single or a few specimens. The majority of Burmeister´s porpoise specimens deposited in 

scientific collections is of individuals of unknown sex, which preclude their use in several 

osteological studies. Considered this situation, the goal of this study was to use skull 

characters of Burmeister’s porpoise to explore the species sexual dimorphism and growth 

pattern.

MATERIALS AND METHODS  

Study area and specimens examined  

Skulls from 142 Burmeister’s porpoises (27 males, 18 females and 97 specimens of unknown 

sex) kept in several museums, scientific and personal collections were included in the study. 

The database comprised  Peru samples (20 males, 11 females and 53 specimens of unknown 

sex) obtained from 7 localities, including incidentally, directly-caught or stranded animals 

collected over a wide period from 1984 to 2001, mainly from 1984-1987; Chile samples (4 

males, 3 females, and 31 specimens of unknown sex) obtained from 5 localities, which 

consisted of 22 specimens taken from a mixture of stranding and incidental catches, during 

the period 1986 to 2004, with two individuals collected from central Chile in 1894 and 1967; 

Argentina samples (3 males, 3 females, and 10 specimens of unknown sex) obtained from 6 

localities from incidental catch and stranding, during the period 1975 to 2002; Uruguay 

samples (2 specimens of unknown sex) from 2 localities were obtained by strandings in 2002 

and another with unknown date; and Brazil samples (1 female, and a specimen of unknown 

sex) from 2 localities were collected from stranded animals in 1986 and 2000 (Figure 1, 

Appendix I).  

 

Analysis of metric characters  

Thirty-seven cranial measurements from 142 skulls of Burmeister´s porpoises were taken with 

a 300mm digital caliper. However, only twenty-eight measurements (Figure 2) were utilized 

in the analysis due to missing or broken bones in some skulls. Sample sizes, therefore, varied 

for each recorded measurement. Twenty-one measurements were based on those taken for P. 

spinipinnis (Brownell and Praderi, 1982; Brownell and Praderi, 1984; Pinedo, 1989; Simões-

Lopes and Ximénez, 1989; Reyes and Van Waerebeek, 1995), P. phocoena (Stuart and 



   
 
 

 

86

Morejohn, 1980; Noldus and de Klerk, 1984; Yurick and Gaskin, 1987), Dall’s porpoise, 

Phocoenoides dalli (Amano and Miyazaki, 1992), spectacled porpoise, Phocoena dioptrica 

(Perrin et al., 2000), Neophocaena phocaenoides (Amano et al., 1992; Jefferson, 2002). Seven 

new measurements were added: Height of rostrum at midlength; width of premaxillae at base 

of nares; greatest width of frontal; least distance between occipital condyles; width of palate 

at midlength of rostrum; greatest width of pterygoid and distance from maxilar to occipital 

crest (Figure 2). All measurements were taken by DMS, thereby eliminating the potential 

problem of inter-observer bias. The number of teeth and/or presence of alveoli in each 

mandibular and maxillary branch were counted. However, in several samples from Argentina 

(n=4), Chile (n=34), and Peru (n=28), the mandibles were missing, therefore, seven 

measurements (length of lower tooth row; length of mandibular symphysis; height of 

mandible; mandible length; mandible width; number of  lower right teeth; number of lower 

left teeth) were not included in the analysis.  

 

Sex determination using only specimens of known sex  

Twenty-eigth characters were examined to explore the sexual dimorphism on skulls of 45 P. 

spinipinnis of known sex (27 males and 18 females) using General Linear Models (GLM) and 

stepwise discriminant analysis (Zar 1999, Hair 1984). Considering that few specimens of 

known sex were available, two new variables, longitude and latitude of sampling site were 

included in the analysis for obtaining a discriminant function for male and female independent 

of geographic area.The discriminant functions obtained using squared Mahalanobis distances 

from group centroids were applied to the individuals of unknown sex. A discriminant score 

function was performed to ascertain sex. All statistical analyses were performed using 

Statistic Program 6.0 for Windows.  



   
 
 

 

87

Growth and age estimation  

The Gompertz equation was used to describe cranial development for each linear variable 

according to sex and to determine which variable better correlated with age (McLaren 1993). 

In addition, the results obtained with the Gompertz growth model were compared with von 

Bertalanffy growth model (1957) and Richards growth model (1959). The Gompertz equation 

is expressed by: 
)0( ttke

t eAS
??

?
? ×= , were: St is the value of the measure at age t; A? is 

the asymptotic length (e.g., the average length the species reaches if it grows indefinitely); t is 

a unit of time in years (estimated from growth layer groups present in each tooth); k is the 

growth-rate constant, t0 is the hypothetical age at which the species have length equal zero;), 

and e is the natural logarithm base. The adjustment of the growth models to the data was done 

minimizing the sum of squared residuals using the interaction quasi-Newton method (non-

linear module) of the Statistics Program 6.0. for Windows. Growth curves were calculated for 

males and females without considering their geographical origin, because the number of 

skulls with teeth was limited, especially for females (e.g., Peru, males=36, females=16; Chile, 

males=6, females=2; Argentina, males=2, females=7; Uruguay, male=1; and Brazil, 

females=2).  

Ages were estimated from counts of the growth layer groups (GLGs) in the dentine using 

decalcified and stained thin sections. Teeth were decalcified with RDO® (a rapid commercial 

bone decalcifier), and cut longitudinally using a freezing microtome. On-center sections 25 

?m thick were stained in Harris’ hematoxylin and examined under transmitted light according 

to Myrick et al. (1983), Molina &amp;amp; Oporto (1993), Molina-Schiller (2006). 

The age at attainment of physical maturity (t) in the skull was obtained when the asymptotic 

length attain 95% of the growth curve for each variable. Only variables with a high 

correlation (r?0.80) in the growth curve were selected for growth analysis. When (t) were 



   
 
 

 

88

different, median was obtained (age of all variables selected) and considered as the age at 

attainment of physical maturity. 

 

Sexual dimorphism according to the physical development of the skull  

All skulls (n=142) of Burmeister’s porpoises were separate according to the physical 

development of the skull. Differences between males and females physically mature and 

physically immature were examined by Hotelling T2 multivariate test, and stepwise 

discriminant analysis (Hair 1984).  A discriminant score function was performed to ascertain 

sex of P. spinipinnis physically mature and physically immature. All statistical analyses were 

performed using Statistic Program 6.0 for Windows. 

 

RESULTS 

Sex determination using only specimens of known sex  

Descriptive statistics for cranial measurements of P. spinipinnis of known sex from Peru, 

Chile, and Atlantic are showed in Tables 1, 2, 3.  

All the skulls with known sex were classified correctly using the squared Mahalanobis 

distances from group centroids. The discriminant analysis classified fourteen variables as 

dimorphic: length of orbit-LO; greatest width of premaxilla-GWP; height of rostrum at 

midlength-HR; longitude-sampling site; distance from maxilar to occipital crest-DMO; width 

of rostrum at base-WR; greatest width of temporal fossa-GWT; distance from tip of rostrum 

to anterior nares-DRN; condylobasal length-CBL; latitude-sampling site; greatest postorbital 

width-GPOW; greatest width of pterygoid-GWP; length of pterygoid-LP, and greatest 

preorbital width-GPRW (Wilks' Lambda=0.21253; F(14,21)=5.5578, P=0.0002) (Table 4). 

The discriminant functions (n=37) were 100% successful in the classification of sex. In order 



   
 
 

 

89

to determine sex, the measurements were replaced in both functions, and the sex attributed 

corresponded to the one with the highest value in the discriminant function.  

Discriminant functions obtained were applied in 97 individuals of unknown sex (Figure 3a), 

and the skulls were classified as follows: Peru (38 males, 15 females), Chile (15 males, 16 

females), Atlantic (Argentina, 4 males and 6 females), Uruguay (2 males), and Brazil (1 

females). All the skulls were classified correctly using the posteriori classification. The sex 

composition of the whole sample is shown in Figure 3b.  

 

Growth  

The ages of the examined skulls varied from 0 to 10 years in males and of 2 to 10 years in 

females (Fig. 4). The parameters of fitted Gompertz curves presented better correlation 

between the metric variables-at-age for males and females of P. spinipinnis, because Richards 

and von Bertalanffy growth models did not converge. 

The correlation coefficient (r) obtained through the Gompertz model revealed that in males 

ten characters (35.71%) presented a larger correlation with the age (r?0.80). The variables 

expressing higher correlation with age in males were condylobasal length (r=0.93), followed 

by distance from tip of rostrum to external nares (r=0.92), and length of rostrum (r=0.91) 

(Table 5). In addition, five characters (width of rostrum at midlength, width of premaxillae, 

distance from tip of rostrum at pterygoid hamuli, width of palate at midlength of rostrum, and 

length of orbit) did not present correlation with age (Table 5). 

 In females only condylobasal length (r=0.86) presented a larger correlation with age (r?0.80), 

followed by length of rostrum from base (r=0.66) (Table 5). In addition, the parameters were 

not estimated for fourteen characters in females, and five characters in males because the 

growth model did not converge (Table 5). It this is probably  linked to the sample size utilized 



   
 
 

 

90

in this study. In females, the lack of some age classes was evident (e.g., absence of females 

between 0 and 2 years of age). The absence of animals that “anchor” the beginning of the 

curve could result in low estimates of k and t0 (e.g., Rosas et al. 2003).  

The growth constant (k) presented different patterns for males and females. In males, the 

condylobasal length showed faster growth (k=0.79) than in females (k=0.27) (Table 5), 

whereas the length of rostrum from base presented a faster growth in females (k=1.07) than in 

males (k=0.96) (Table 5). In males the skull height (k=0.97) presented the faster growth, 

followed by length of rostrum from base (k=0.96), and width of rostrum at base (k=0.87). A 

slower growth was observed in the greatest width of left premaxilla (k=0.36), followed by the 

greatest width of pterygoid (k= 0.37) (Table 5).  

In males, differences were observed in the stabilization of the asymptotic growth of the 

variables selected with r?0.80. The stabilization of the asymptotic growth of the skull height 

and length of neurocranium started at 2 years of age (Table 5, Fig. 5a). In zigomatic width, the 

stabilization of the asymptotic growth started at 2.5 years of age (Table 5, Fig. 5b). However, 

the stabilization of the condylobasal length, length of rostrum, width of rostrum, distance 

from tip of rostrum to external nares and greatest postorbital width started at 3 years of age 

(Table 5, Fig. 5c). In least distance between occipital condyles and length of pterygoid the 

stabilization started at 4 years of age (Table 5, Fig. 5d). Considering that the median age of all 

variables selected was 3 years, we suggest that in this study the males attain physical maturity 

of skull at about 3 years of age.  

In females, the stabilization of the asymptotic growth of the condylobasal length began at 4 

years of age (Table 5). Unfortunately, in the females it was not possible to estimate the 

physical maturity of the skull due to small sample size.  



   
 
 

 

91

On the other hand, it was only possible to estimate the age in 72 skulls (45 males and 27 

females) out of 142 skulls. In this situation, it is considered appropriate the use of the 

asymptotic length attained at 95% of condylobasal length as a criteria of attainment of 

physical maturity in the skull of P. spinipinnis. Thus, the males attain physical maturity when 

the condylobasal length is ? 266 mm, while that the females attain physical maturity when the 

condylobasal length is ? 277mm. 

 

Sexual dimorphism according to the physical development of the skull 

Descriptive statistics of the metric characters from physically inmmature skulls of males and 

females of P. spinipinnis is showed in Table 6. In physically immature skulls, the Hotelling T² 

test could not be computed. It this is probably  linked to the sample size utilized in this study.  

The discriminant analysis classified seven characters (height of rostrum at ½ length-HR, 

greatest width of nasal-GWN, length of upper tooth row-LUR, distance from tip of rostrum to 

external nares-DLR, width of rostrum-WR, greatest width of frontal-GWF, and distance from 

maxilar to occipital crest-DMCO) as dimorphic for physically immature skulls of both sexes 

(Wilks' Lambda=0.09693; F(7,5)=6.6548, P=0.0266). The discriminant functions were 

85.71% successful in the classification of sex, with only three males and a single female 

erroneously classified. The functions by sex for physically immature skull were: 

Male = -1059.20 + 25.75(HR) + 89.90(GWN) + 0.72(LUR) + 3.34(DLR) - 36.50(WR) + 

5.83(GWF) + 27.72 (DMCO)  

Female = -845.86 + 23.75(HR) + 78.15(GNW) + 1.15(LUR) + 2.57(DLR) - 31.49(WR) + 

5.09(GWF) + 24.57(DMCO) 

 

 



   
 
 

 

92

In physically mature skulls, the results of the Hotelling T2 multivariate test showed to be 

significative (T²=118. 131; F(28,29)= 3.4795, P=0.00065). Descriptive statistics of the metric 

characters from physically mature skulls of males and females of P. spinipinnis is showed in 

Table 7.  

The discriminant analysis classified eight characters (length of orbit-LO, greatest width of left 

premaxilla-GWLPR, length of pterygoid-LPT, greatest preorbital width-GWPRO, height of 

rostrum at midlength-HR, greatest width of temporal fossa-GTW, greatest width of pterygoid-

GWPT, and greatest width of internal nares-(GWNI) as dimorphic for females and males 

physically mature skulls (Wilks' Lambda=0.37248; F(8,49)=10.319, P=0.0000). The 

discriminant functions were 95.12% successful in the classification of sex. Two females and 

two males were erroneously classified. The functions by sex for physically mature skulls 

were: 

Male = - 380.19 + 5.91(LO) - 8.64(GWLPR) + 3.57(LPT) + 0.06(GWPRO) + 6.18(HR) + 

4.95(GTW) + 0.88(GWPT) - 2.55(GWNI) 

Female = - 420.68 + 6.86(OL) - 11.80(GWLPR) + 4.21(LPT) - 0.37(GWPRO) + 6.74(HR) + 

5.45(GWT) -1.25(GWPT) - 2.98(GWNI) 

 

DISCUSSION 

Diverse methods have been used for sex determination in marine mammals, including the 

skull characters that by far are the most common tool used in dolphins and porpoises (e.g., 

Perrin 1975, Schnell et al. 1985, Perrin et al. 1994), since sex determination can be difficult if 

not impossible in decomposed animals (Molina-Schiller &amp;amp; Pinedo 2004).  

The sexual dimorphisms observed in fourteen cranial characters of P. spinipinnis of known 

sex corroborate the differences in asymptotic growth at 95% of condylobasal length for males 



   
 
 

 

93

and females, where a differentiated development was observed between sexes. However, this 

result was not coincident with analysis of cranial morphology realized for Burmeister’s 

porpoises from Peru by Reyes &amp;amp; van Waerebeek (1995), because these authors found that 

condylobasal length is not dimorphic. Probably this differences have relationship with the size 

of the sample (Males=22 and Females=14), and they used skulls of porpoises sexually mature. 

The sexual dimorphism observed in physically mature and immature skulls supports the 

allometric cranial growth in P. spinipinnis. In addition, the discriminant functions showed that 

the height of rostrum at midlength was a dimorphic character present both in physically 

mature and immature skulls.  

The Gompertz growth model showed that the length of rostrum from base in female skull 

presented an early maturation in relation to the male skull. This character is related to somatic 

development (feeding apparatus). In males, the condylobasal length showed a faster growth 

than in females, and this character is related to the neural development (braincaise apparatus). 

In addition, in males the characters that presented an early maturation are related to neural 

development (e.g., braincase, visual and hearing apparatus).  However, the greatest width of 

left premaxilla related to feeding apparatus and greatest width of pterygoid related to 

breathing-sound apparatus had a slower growth.  

The sexual dimorphism observed in physically mature skulls of P. spinipinnis, with females 

larger than males supports the differences observed by sex in the body size of P. spinipinnis 

(Brownell &amp;amp; Praderi 1984, Goodall et al. 1995b). Sexual dimorphism has been reported for 

several species of small odontocetes, where the females are larger than males. Such is the case 

of franciscana, Pontoporia blainvillei (Pinedo 1991, Ramos et al. 2000, Ramos et al. 2002); P.  

phocoena (Read &amp;amp; Gaskin 1990, Read &amp;amp; Tolley 1997); Phocoena sinus (Brownell et al. 1987, 



   
 
 

 

94

Hohn et al. 1996, Vidal 1995); P. dalli (Amano &amp;amp; Miyasaki 1992, Ferrero &amp;amp; Walker 1999), 

and P. spinipinnis, Brownell and Praderi 1984; Goodal et al. 1995a).  

 

The sexual dimorphism has been associated with a differential investment of energy in 

growth, reflecting divergent reproductive strategies in the two sexes (Calzada et al. 1997). 

Maybe in these species the sexual dimorphism has relationship with the reproductive success. 

Ralls (1977) says that a larger mother may produce a larger calf with greater chances of 

survival, and may be better at such aspect of maternal care. Other possible selective factor is 

availability of resources, because this has relation with reduction of inter-sexual competition 

for food by females (Ralls 1977). Future studies of behavior, feeding, life history and ecology 

in P. spinipinnis will allow to clarify these differences.  

The utilization of condylobasal length to estimate the physical maturity of the skull in 

Burmeister’s porpoise was a useful alternative tool in this study because part of the samples 

kept at museums lack basic data. Its application can allow an increase in sample sizes in 

studies of population dynamics, geographical variation and taxonomic comparisons. Usually 

the biological data are scarce, and several skulls are incomplete (e.g., lack of teeth, broken 

bones) limiting the morphometrics analysis.  

Our results suggest that it is important to study growth by analyzing the sexes for each 

geographic area, because there may be differential growth between sexes. Therefore, the 

results presented here must be considered more in terms of patterns than for the specific 

values of the growth parameters. It is highly recommended to develop growth studies of 

Burmeister’s porpoises from three geographic areas (Peru, Chile and Atlantic) including 

different age-classes for males and females in order to estimate the physical maturity of the 



   
 
 

 

95

skull of P. spinipinnis by each geographic area, and to develop a better management of 

populations subject to differential fishery impacts.

APPENDIX I

ABSTRACT– Skulls of 102 P. spinipinnis physically mature (61 males and 41 females) were 

examined to explored the geographical variation in size and shape by traditional and 

geometric morphometrics. The skulls were obtained from museums and scientific collections 

from Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. By ANOVA/MANOVA analyses the 

specimens were separated in three geographic areas: Peru (42 males and 18 females), Chile 

(13 males and 15 females), and Atlantic (6 males and 8 females). Differences in size and 

shape of skulls were analyzed by 28 linear measurements. These differences were also 

investigated applying geometric morphometrics to two-dimensional images of 240 skulls in 

dorsal, ventral and lateral views. In addition, two-block partial least squares (2B-PLS) method 

was used to explore the pattern of covariation between variation in shape using partial warp 

scores and a set of environmental variables (latitude, longitude, temperature, salinity and 

oxygen at 0 and 50m depth, respectively). Sexual dimorphism in size and shape were 

observed for skulls of P. spinipinnis from three geographical areas, being the females larger 

than males. The results obtained by linear and geometric morphometrics suggest that 

geographical variation exists among P. spinipinnis from Peru, Chile and Atlantic, with 

smaller individuals distributed between Pacasmayo, northern Peru (07°24'S) to Paracas, 

southern Peru (13º50'S), and larger specimens distributed in the Atlantic coast from Chubut, 

southern Argentina (?42º46'S) to North. Specimens from San Antonio, central Chile (33º30'S) 

to Strait of Magellan, southern Chile (?52°30'S) showed a size and shape intermediate in 

relation to porpoises from Peru and Atlantic. Geometric morphometrics was more useful for 

showing differences between specimens, indicating that males are more variable in skull 

shape than females; whereas those females from Chile and Atlantic show less difference on 

skull shape. The differences observed in size and shape in skulls of P. spinipinnis from three 

geographic areas seem to be related to oceanographic pattern associated to their distribution. 



   
 
 

 

122

Additional investigations (morphometrics and genetics) are needed from central Chile (33ºS) 

to north to evaluate the differences between porpoises from Chile and Peru.  

 

Key words: Burmeister’s porpoise, sexual dimorphism, geometric morphometrics, geographic 

variation, Phocoena spinipinnis, traditional morphometrics.

INTRODUCTION  

 

Burmeister’s porpoise, Phocoena spinipinnis, Burmeister 1865, is endemic to coastal 

waters of the South American from northern Peru, Paita Bay (05°01’S, 81ºW) southward, 

round Cape Horn, and northward to southern Brazil (Goodall et al. 1995a; Brownell and 

Clapham 1999). The distribution range to southern Brazil, Santa Catarina, (28°48’S, 

49°12’W) is rare, with three know records (Pinedo 1989; Simões-Lopes and Ximenez 1989; 

GEMARS, record unpublished), associated to the Subtropical Convergence (Molina-Schiller 

et al. 2005). Information about life history, distribution, movements, abundance, and 

population structure is limited (Corcuera et al. 1995; Goodall et al. 1995a; Jefferson et al. 

1993; Reeves et al. 2003; Reyes and van Waerebeeck 1995;  van Waerebeek et al. 2002). 

Sexual dimorphism has been documented in external traits (Goodall et al. 1995a), and based 

on skull size using linear measurements (Reyes and van Waerebeeck 1995; Molina-Schiller 

2006).  

Differences in body size were observed between Burmeister’s porpoises from Peru, Chile, 

Argentina, and Uruguay (Brownell and Praderi 1984; Corcuera et al. 1995; Goodall et al. 

1995b; Reyes and van Waerebeek 1995). Brownell and Praderi (1984) and Corcuera et al. 

(1995), proposed that Pacific and Atlantic Burmeister’s porpoise comprise two different 

stocks based on differences in body length. On the other hand, recent studies support the 

genetic differentiation among Burmeister’s porpoises from Peru and Chile-Argentina (Rosa et 

al. 2005).  

Considerable effort has been given globally to managing impacted populations of small 

cetaceans. The first step in this management is to define the populations involved (e.g., Secchi 

et al. 2003), and one tool is use geographic variation through morphology analyses (Perrin 

1984). Morphometrics techniques using skulls have been use for geographic variations studies 



   
 
 

 

124

in marine mammals using traditional morphometrics (e.g., Amano and Miyazaki 1992; 

Amano et al. 2002; Beasley et al. 2002; Brunner 2002; Brunner et al. 2002; Jefferson 2002; 

Perrin et al. 1994; Ramos et al. 2002; Schnell et al. 1986) and geometrics morphometrics 

(e.g., Drehmer 2005; Higa et al. 2002; Monteiro-Filho et al. 2002; Oliveira et al. 2005; 

Sanfelice 2003). Considering that morphological structures in an organism have two 

components (size and shape), and that shape is the most informative for defining biological 

entities in nature (Atchley et al. 1992; Patton and Brylski 1987), the goal of this study is to 

explore the geographical variation in size and shape in skulls of P. spinipinnis, and whether 

differences between males and females follow the same patterns along the geographic range 

studied. 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 

 Samples.__ Skulls of 102 P. spinipinnis (61 males and 41 females) were examined to 

explored the geographical variation in size and shape. The skulls were obtained from 

museums and scientific collections from the following locations and years: In Peru, 60 

porpoises (from 7 localities), were a mixture from incidentally, directly-caught or stranded 

during the period 1984 to 2001, mainly from 1984-1987, and 1998-2001; In Chile, 28 

Burmeister’s porpoises from 5 localities were incidentally caught or stranded during the years 

1986 to 2004, including two additional individuals collected from central Chile in 1894 and 

1967; Argentina samples included 11 individuals from 6 localities collected from incidental 

catch and stranding events during the period 1975 to 2002, with an additional specimen 

collected in 1903; the Uruguayan samples comprised two stranded specimens in 2002 and 

2004, respectively; and a single Burmeister’s porpoise from Brazil stranded in 1986 (Fig. 1, 

Appendix 1).  



   
 
 

 

125

Data analysis.__ For analysis of geographical variation in relation to size and shape of 

Burmeister’s porpoise skull, we employed traditional (linear) morphometrics (Marcus 1990) 

and geometric morphometrics (Bookstein 1991, 1996; Dos Reis et al. 2002a, 2002b; Marcus 

et al. 1993; Marcus et al. 1996; Monteiro-Filho et al. 2002; Oliveira et al. 2005; Rohlf and 

Marcus 1993; Sanfelice 2003; Zeldich et al. 2004). We analyzed skulls of physically mature 

specimens and the samples were grouped by geographic origin following the methodology 

used by Molina-Schiller (2006.). Based in that study the skulls were separated in three 

geographic areas (Peru, Chile and Atlantic), because the sample size from the Atlantic coast 

(Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay) was small (n = 14), and the multivariate analyses indicated 

no differences between these localities (P &gt; 0.05). Therefore, the samples from Atlantic were 

pooled in a single group named “Atlantic”.  

Traditional (linear) Morphometrics.__ We took twenty-eight cranial measurements using a 

300mm digital caliper (Figs. 2A-C). The characters were based on those taken for P. 

spinipinnis (Brownell and Praderi 1982; Brownell and Praderi 1984; Molina-Schiller 2006.; 

Pinedo 1989; Reyes and van Waerebeek 1995; Simões-Lopes and Ximenez 1989), Phocoena 

phocoena (Noldus and de Klerk 1984; Stuart and Morejohn 1980; Yurick and Gaskin 1987), 

Dall’s porpoise, Phocoenoides dalli (Amano and Miyazaki 1992), spectacled porpoise, 

Phocoena dioptrica (Perrin et al. 2000), Neophocaena phocaenoides (Amano et al. 1992; 

Jefferson 2002). All measurements were taken by DMS, thereby eliminating the potential 

problem of inter-observer bias. Due to the small number of the mandibles, the associate 

measures were not included in the analysis. Differences in sample size for each character was 

due to missing or broken bones in some skulls. The available sample size by sex for 

geographic origin was as follow: Peru (males = 42 and females = 18), Chile (males = 13 and 

females = 15), and Atlantic (males = 6 and females = 8). 



   
 
 

 

126

We employed Student t-test univariate analysis to verify the existence of significant 

differences between sexes within each geographic area, and the differences between means 

were tested using Hotelling T2 multivariate (with casewise MD). Analysis of Variance/ 

Multivariate Analysis of Variance (ANOVA/MANOVA) were realized using General Liner 

Models (GLM) to test the effects of sex, geographic area, and interaction between those 

variables. In addition, we carried out Bonferroni post hoc test comparison. A canonical 

discriminant analysis was applied to identify the subset of variables that, taken in linear 

combination, shows the greatest degree of geographic variation by sex and geographic area.  

In addition, to explore the geographical variation of skulls without the influence of sex, we 

applied the method of adjusting for sex differences described by Schnell et al. (1985). These 

authors developed a series of corrections terms to adjust measurements of the larger sex 

downward and the smaller sex upward, thus producing sex-ajusted or “zwitter” (from a 

German word for hermaphrodite or hybrid) measurements. These corrections have been 

employed here so that specimens of the two sexes could be combined for an overall analysis 

of geographic variation. Characters were standardized so that means were zero and standard 

deviation one. After conversion to zwitters, means were computed for each character, and 

these were employed in principal components analysis (PCA), and discriminant analysis.  

Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) were realized to explored the correlation among 

twenty morphological variables (characters that showed significant difference by geographical 

area in the two-way analysis of variance), and eigth environmental variables (latitude, 

longitude, temperature at 0m depth, temperature at 50m depth, salinity at 0m depth, salinity at 

50m depth, oxygen at 0m, and oxygen at 50m depth). In this analysis, we standardize the 

data-using LOG10. The environmental variables were obtained from data utilized by Molina-

Schiller et al. (2005). We utilized historical average from 1965 to 2000 of the first 5 minute of 

latitude and longitude of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen (0 and 50m depth) from

Paita, Peru (05°01’S, 81ºW), in the Pacific Ocean to Santa Catarina, Brazil (28°48’S, 

49°12’W) in the Atlantic Ocean. All statistical analyses realized in this study were performed 

using Statistic Program 6.0 for Windows.  

Geometric morphometrics.__ For this kind of analysis, it is necessary to use specimens with 

whole and unbroken skulls, so that all landmarks can be digitize in each image. Therefore, we 

took digital images of 240 skulls in three views: dorsal (40 males and 16 females from Peru; 9 

males and 11 females from Chile, and 4 males and 7 females from Atlantic), ventral (35 males 

and 15 females from Peru; 7 males and 13 females from Chile, and 5 males and 7 females 

from Atlantic), and lateral (31 males and 15 females from Peru, 7 males and 7 females from 

Chile, and 4 males and 7 females from Atlantic). The images were obtained with a Sony 

Cyber-Shot 5.0 mega pixels digital camera with a resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels, and 

always included a scale. All images were saved on JPEG format. We used TpsUtil 1.2 

software (Rohlf 2004) to organize the images. Anatomical landmarks, assumed 

morphologically and topologically equivalent in all specimens, were selected to describe the 

variation in skull shape, and were digitized for each specimen (Fig. 2) using TpsDig32 

software (Rohlf 2004). For each view, homologous points (landmarks) were identified and 

defined (Figure 2). The full set of landmarks for each view is referred to as the configuration 

(Dryden and Mardia 1998). Landmarks were defined as follows:  

Dorsal view (Fig. 2D): 1-9 = rostral tip, 2-8 = anterior point of the notch in the maxilla, 3-7 

= intersection between the frontal bone and zygomatic process, 4-6 = intersection between 

supraoccipital suture and posterior-most point on the curve of the parietal, 5 = posterior-most 

point on the edge of the supraoccipital, 10-11 = posterior-most point of premaxilla at 

midlength of rostrum, 12-13=posterior-most point on the curve of the premaxillae, 14-15 = 

posterior-most point on nasal bone,16 = midpoint frontal prominence, 17-18 = intersection 

between frontal suture and supraoccipital suture.  



   
 
 

 

128

Ventral view (Fig. 2E): 1-11= rostral tip, 2-8 = anterior point of the notch in the maxilla, 3-

9 = anterior point of preorbital, 4-8 = anterior point of postorbital, 5-7 = posterior-most point 

on the curve of the parietal, 6 = posterior-most point on the edge of the supraoccipital, 12 = 

midpoint of pterygoid, 13-4 = inferior tip of basioccipital. 

Lateral view (Fig. 2F): 1 = rostral tip, 2 = anterior point of the notch in the maxilla, 3 = 

anterior point of preorbital, 4 = anterior point of postorbital, 5 = intersection between 

supraoccipital suture and posterior-most point on the curve of the parietal, 6 = posterior-most 

point on the edge of the supraoccipital, 7 = midpoint frontal prominence, 8 = posterior-most 

point on the curve of the premaxillae, 9 = posterior-most point of temporal fossa, 10 = 

anterior-most point of temporal fossa, 11 = superior-most point of length temporal fossa, 12 = 

intersection between inferior-most point of length temporal fossa and mastoid process,  13 = 

posterior-most point on nasal bone.  

The coordinates and centroid size were calculated using CoordGen (Sheets 2000). Centroid 

size is the mean square root of distances from each landmark to the centroid (mean of all 

coordinates) of landmarks (Bookstein 1991). ANOVA/MANOVA were performed on mean 

centroid sizes between sexes, geographic area, and interaction between sex and geographic 

area.  

To compare shape, the coordinates for each specimen were superimposed on each other by 

generalized least squares Procustes superimposition (GLS) to create a mean configuration. 

Generalized least squares superimposes specimens, minimizing the Procustes distance (square 

root of squared distance between each landmark and its homologue, summed over all 

landmark) between landmark configurations due to differences in scale, position, and 

orientation. This removes differences unrelated to shape (Rohlf and Slice 1990; Slice 1996).  

To explore patterns change on shape in P. spinipinnis, we first explored the relationship 

between shape and sexual dimorphism using TwoGroupsGen (Sheets 2000). For these data 



   
 
 

 

129

the Goodall’s F test was computed to verify difference between sexes on shape using partial 

Procustes distances (resampling test was computed after 1600 bootstrap iterations). Here the 

coordinates are superimposed using GLS with the specimens rescaled to unit centroid size. 

After confirming the sexual dimorphism on skull shape of P. spinipinnis, we computed partial 

warps matrix (including the uniform component) using Regress6c and CVAGen (Sheets 

2000). Canonical variates analyses were used to describe differences by geographic area. The 

differences along the 1st and 2nd canonical variate were computed by regressing shape on 

canonical variates analysis scores (Rohlf et al. 1996). Partial warp scores were used in 

ANOVA/MANOVA and ordinal analysis (Rohlf et al. 1996) to test differences by geographic 

area for the three views. Mahalanobis distances (D2) from canonical variates scores of males 

and females for each geographic area was calculated using the a priori group assignments. All 

statistical analyses of ANOVA, MANOVA and multivariate exploratory techniques were 

performed using software Statistics 6.0 for Windows and IMP program (Sheets 2000).  

The two-block partial least squares (2B-PLS) method was used to explore the pattern of 

covariation between shape variation using partial warp scores (uniform component included) 

and a set of environmental variables (latitude, longitude, temperature, salinity, and oxygen at 

0m and 50m depth, respectively). 2B-PLS constructs pairs of variables that are linear 

combinations of the variables within each of two sets analysis (Rohlf and Corti 2000; 

Sampson et al. 1989). NTSYS (Numerical Taxonomy and Multivariate Analysis System, 

version 2.11V, Rohlf 2002) was used for matrix comparison, and 2B-PLS was computed 

using TpsPLS (Rohlf 2004). The environmental variables were standardized but the partial 

warps were not (because they are already in the same units). Scatter plots of the projections of 

the standardized variables and partial warp scores onto their paired vectors were obtained with 

? = 0 separately for the dorsal, ventral and lateral views. To assess whether covariation is 

more concentrated into the first few dimensions than would be expected by chance, we use a 



   
 
 

 

130

permutation test (with 999 random permutations). For the ordination of variables, the 

estimated shape was showed as a thin-plate spline deformation of the reference.  

 

RESULTS 

 

Traditional (linear) morphometrics 

Sexual dimorphism in relation to geographic variation.__ Results of  the t-test indicated 

sexual dimorphism in skulls of physically mature Burmeister’s porpoises from Peru, Chile 

and Atlantic (Table 1). In samples from Peru, the results of Hotelling T² test showed 

significant differences between sexes (T² = 590.268, F = 4.8185, P = 0.01298). The t-test 

showed that the females were significantly larger than males (P &amp;lt;0.05) in five characters 

(length of rostrum from base, height of rostrum at midlength, length of orbit, greatest width of 

frontal prominence and length of upper tooth row) (Table 1). In Burmeister’s porpoises from 

Chile, the Hotelling T2 multivariate test cannot be computed, whereas the t-test showed that 

females were larger than males in four characters (skull height, least distance between 

occipital condyles, greatest width of temporal fossa and length of pterygoid) (P &amp;lt;0.05) (Table 

1). In samples from Atlantic, t-test showed that the females were larger than males in ten 

characters (condylobasal length, length of rostrum from base, width of rostrum at base, 

distance from tip of rostrum to external nares, skull height, greatest width of internal nares, 

length of neurocranium, least distance between occipital condyles, distance from tip of 

rostrum to pterygoid hamuli and greatest width of pterygoid) (P &amp;lt;0.05), while thet distance 

from maxilar to occipital crest in males was larger than in females (P &amp;lt;0.05) (Table 1).  

Hotelling T2 multivariate test cannot be computed. 

Multivariate test of significance showed significant differences between sexes (Wilks’ 

Lambda = 0.2294, F = 2.7592, P = 0.0077); geographic area (Wilks’ Lambda = 0.0020, F = 



   
 
 

 

131

17.539, P = 0.0000); and interaction between sex and geographic area (Wilks’ Lambda = 

0.1081, F = 1.6770, P = 0.03641). On the other hand, Bonferroni post hoc test, showed 

significant differences for sex in eight characters (P &amp;lt;0.05), geographic area in 20 characters 

(P &amp;lt;0.05), and for the interaction between sex and geographic area in 17 characters (P &amp;lt;

0.05).  

In females, the discriminant function analysis revealed that three characters (10.7%) 

(greatest width of premaxillae, length of rostrum from base, and distance from maxilar to 

occipital crest) best represented the differences among the geographic areas (Wilks' Lambda = 

0.0051; F = 76.706, P &amp;lt;0.0000) (Table 2). All specimens from Peru (n = 20) were classified 

correctly. However, Burmeister’s porpoises from Chile (n = 14) presented a 73.33% of 

successful in predicted classifications, while that porpoises from Atlantic (n = 10) was 

66.70%. Females from Chile and Atlantic showed overlap in 7 specimens, three from Chile 

and four porpoises from Atlantic (Fig. 3A). Evaluation of the standard coefficients of the 

canonical discriminant analysis indicated that two characters (greatest width of premaxillae 

and length of rostrum from base) in the first root and distance from maxilar to occipital crest 

in second root best represent the difference among the geographic areas (Table 2). The 

squared Mahalanobis distances (D2) values show a clear separation of Burmeister’s porpoises 

by geographic area, especially among females from Peru and Atlantic (D2 = 393.40, P = 

0.0000), followed by females from Peru-Chile (D2 = 303.38, P = 0.0000), and finally females 

from Chile-Atlantic (D2 = 17.02, P = 0.0004).  

In males, the canonical discriminant analysis indicated that fifteen characters (53.6%) best 

represented the differences among the geographic areas (Wilks' Lambda = 0.00276, F = 

43.320, P &amp;lt;0.0000) (Table 3, Fig. 3B). The discriminant function classified correctly all 

specimens from Peru (n = 35), Chile (n = 9) and Atlantic (n = 5). Evaluation of the standard 

coefficients of the canonical discriminant analysis indicated that three characters (greatest 



   
 
 

 

132

width of premaxillae, skull height, and greatest parietal width) in the first root and two 

characters (width of rostrum at midlength, and width of rostrum at base) in second root best 

represent the difference among the geographic areas (Table 3). No overlap occurred among 

the three geographic areas (Fig. 3B). The squared Mahalanobis distances (D2) values show a 

clear separation of Burmeister’s porpoises by geographic area, especially among males from 

Peru and Chile (D2 = 506.08, P = 0.0000), followed by males from Peru-Atlantic (D2 = 

486.28; P = 0.0000), and males from Chile-Atlantic (D2 = 40.38, P = 0.0003).  

Geographic variation.__ After conversion of males and females to zwitters specimens, and 

to explore the geographical variation of the skulls without the influence of the sex, means 

were computed and the results of the t-test indicated significant differences in all characters 

among skulls of Burmeister’s porpoises from Peru (n = 60) and Chile (n = 28) (T² = 225720, 

F = 3430.4, P &amp;lt;0.0000), and between porpoises from Peru (n = 60) and Atlantic (n = 15) (T² 

= 386938, F=5527.7, P &amp;lt;0.0000). However, two characters were not significant (greatest 

width of left premaxilla and greatest width of frontal) (P &gt; 0.05) among Burmeister’s 

porpoises from Chile (n = 28) and Atlantic (n = 15). On the other hand, multivariate tests of 

significance showed significant differences by geographic area (Wilks’ Lambda=0.0000, F = 

3918.07, P = 0.0000), and (T² = 8638.09, F = 4164.79, P &amp;lt;0.0000). In addition, the 

Bonferroni post hoc test, presented significant differences in all characters.  

The canonical discriminant analysis revealed that a single character, greatest postorbital 

width (GPOW) best represented the differences among the geographic areas (Wilks' Lambda 

= 0.00080; F = 34486, P &amp;lt;0.0000). The discriminant function was 100% successful in the 

classification of the specimens from three geographic areas: Peru (n = 60), Chile (n = 28), and 

Atlantic (n = 15). The functions by geographic area using zwitter were: 

 Peru = - 433.701 + 7.820 (GPOW)  

Chile = - 775.333 - 10.449 (GPOW)  



   
 
 

 

133

Atlantic = - 1123.24 - 12.58 (GPOW) 

The squared Mahalanobis distances (D2) values showed a clear geographic separation 

among specimens from Peru, Chile, and Atlantic (P = 0.0000). The larger distances were 

observed among porpoises from Peru and Atlantic (D2 = 6219.16), followed by specimens 

from Peru-Chile (D2 = 4987.79), whereas Burmeister’s porpoises from Chile-Atlantic showed 

the smaller distances (D2 = 67.85).  

The first two principal components explained 76.48% and 21.83%, respectively of the total 

observed variability (Fig. 4). All characters analyzed presented highest loadings. Twenty-

three characters showed highest loadings on component I, and in twenty characters the  

eigenvectors were negative, suggesting that they are correlated with shape, while three 

characters that were positive (greatest width of left premaxilla, height of rostrum at 

midlength,  and length of upper tooth row) would be correlated with size factor (Table 4, Fig. 

4). The component II, showed highest loadings in five characters (greatest length of temporal 

fossa, greatest width of frontal prominence, length of pterygoid, distance from maxilar to 

occipital crest, and greatest width of temporal fossa) with eigenvectors positive, suggesting 

that they are correlated with size factor, whereas that only 1 character (greatest width of 

frontal prominence) presented eigenvectors negative (Table 4, Fig. 4). Scores of the 

specimens in the first two components are delineating three groups based on geographic 

variation (Fig. 4). The PCA also indicates a separation between three geographic areas along 

the second principal component axis, pointing to the existence of geographic differences in 

size and shape among these three populations.  

Correlation between linear variables and environmental variables.__In canonical 

correlations analysis, the Chi-Square tests showed that the first canonical root was statistically 

significant (R2 = 0.98; ?² = 353.14; P = 0.0000). The canonical loadings in the first canonical 

function showed high correlations in five environmental variables (oxygen at 50m depth, 



   
 
 

 

134

latitude, salinity at 50m depth, longitude, and temperature at 0m depth). The linear variables 

showed high correlation in three variables (greatest width of premaxillae, greatest width of 

frontal, and greatest postorbital width) (Table 5). The results showed that these variables are 

larger for specimens from Chile and Atlantic, associated to high latitudes, in colder, more 

oxygenated, and less saline waters, whereas that these morphological variables are smaller for 

Burmeister’s porpoises from Peru associated to low latitudes, in warmer, less oxygenated, and 

more saline waters (Table 5, Fig. 5).  

 

Geometric morphometrics 

Size.__ The size represented by centroid size for dorsal view were not significant by sex, and 

for the interaction sex and geographic area (P &gt; 0.05). However, the two-way ANOVA 

showed significative differences by geographic area (F = 6.903, d.f. = 2, P = 0.001), being the 

Burmeister’s porpoises from Atlantic larger than porpoises from Chile, whereas that Peruvian 

porpoises were smaller than Chilean specimens. In ventral view, the two-way ANOVA by 

sex, showed significant differences on centroid size (F = 10.82, d.f. = 1, P = 0.001), being the 

females larger than males. However, these differences were not significative by geographic 

area, and for the interaction between sex and geographic area (P &gt; 0.05). In lateral view, the 

results of two-way ANOVA were similar to dorsal view, and differences were only observed 

by geographic area (F = 10.32, d.f = 2, P = 0.019), but the mean centroid size was larger in 

Burmeister’s porpoises from Peru, followed by specimens from Atlantic, and Chile.  

Sexual dimorphism on shape.__ The Procustes distances between mean shape showed 

sexual dimorphism in skulls of Burmeister’s porpoises for the three views (P &amp;lt;0.01) (Table 

6). Diagram with average configuration of skull shape of males and females showed that the 

sexual dimorphism in shape was more evident for dorsal and lateral views (Fig. 6). For dorsal 

view, females have in general thinner and longer rostrum compared to males, while the 



   
 
 

 

135

braincase is more compressed in females (Figs. 6A and 6C). Ventral view showed little 

difference in skull shape (Table 6), and these were related to rostral region (Figs. 6D and 6F). 

In Lateral view, the differences on shape were similar to observed for dorsal view in rostral 

region and braincase.  The distance between preorbital and postorbital were relatively longer 

in males, while the midpoint frontal prominence was broader in males than in females (Figs. 

6G and 6I).  

Geographic variation on shape.__ For dorsal view, 32 relative warps showed shape changes 

associated with the first two canonical axes separating both males and females in three 

geographic areas (Peru, Chile, and Atlantic). In males, the first two canonical axes in the 

CVA explained 90% of the observed variation, separating clearly Burmeister’s porpoises 

from Chile, Peru and Atlantic (Fig. 7A). The MANOVA performed on the first axis was 

highly significant (Wilks’ lambda = 0.0192, ?2 = 162.0920, d.f. = 38, P = 0.0000), separating 

males from Chile, while a geographic separation between specimens from Peru and Atlantic 

was observed along the second axis (Wilks’ lambda = 0.3478, ?2 = 43.3017, d.f. = 18, P = 

0.0007). Males from Peru showed a more compressed rostral region than Atlantic specimens, 

and braincase region was broader and more compressed compared to Bumeister’s porpoises 

from Chile and Atlantic. Males from Chile were more compressed in rostral region (Fig. 8). In 

females, on the other hand, the first two canonical axes for dorsal view explained 98% of the 

observed variation, separating Atlantic specimens along the first axis (Wilks’ lambda = 

0.0016, ?2 = 135.7029, d.f. = 42, P = 0.0000), while Burmeister’s porpoises from Chile and 

Peru presented separation along the second axis (Fig. 7B), but this axis was non-significant (P 

= 0.0742). Females from Chile and Atlantic showed a thinner rostrum than those from Peru, 

and porpoises from Chile showed a more compressed rostral region than the other specimens. 

The braincase was broader and more compressed in females from Peru than those from Chile 

and Atlantic (Fig. 8). The discriminant function based on Mahalanobis distance for dorsal 



   
 
 

 

136

view classified correctly males (Peru = 40, Chile = 9, and Atlantic = 4) (Fig. 7A) and females 

(Peru = 16, Chile = 11, and Atlantic = 7) (Fig. 7B). Mahalanobis distances (D2) values 

showed a clear geographic separation among specimens from Peru, Chile, and Atlantic (P = 

0.0001), showing a larger separation among porpoises from Peru-Atlantic (P = 0.0000). 

However, D2 value for females from Chile-Atlantic was non-significant (P = 0.2103) (Table 

7). This suggests that for dorsal view, males are more variable in skull shape than females, 

and that Burmeister’s porpoises from Chile and Atlantic presented less differences in skull 

shape, especially between females. 

 In ventral view, the 24 relative warps showed differences on skull shape and the first two 

canonical axes explained 91% of the observed variation in males (Fig. 9A) and 86% for 

females (Fig. 9B). Both males (Wilks’ lambda=0.02274, ?2 = 122.9696, d.f. = 48, P = 0.0000) 

and females (Wilks’ lambda = 0.0073, ?2 = 100.7771, d.f. = 48, P = 0.0000) from Chile were  

separated along the first canonical axis. The second axis separated specimens from Peru and 

Atlantic, but these differences were not significant for males (P = 0.1199) and females (P = 

0.0742). The Chilean specimens presented an intermediate shape between specimens from 

Peru and Atlantic. The specimens of Peru seem to be smaller than the other porpoises. The 

rostrum is smaller, and the braincase region was more compressed and the distance between 

rostral tip to midpoint of pterygoid region, orbital region, and supraorbital were shorter 

compared to Burmeister’s porpoises from Chile and Atlantic. Specimens from Atlantic in 

general were larger than porpoises from Peru and Chile (Fig. 10). The discriminant function o 

based on Mahalanobis distance for ventral view classified correctly all males (Peru = 33, 

Chile = 9, and Atlantic = 5) (Fig. 9A) and females (Peru = 15, Chile = 13, and Atlantic = 7) 

(Fig. 9B) from the three geographic areas. Mahalanobis distances values showed separation 

among three geographic areas (P &amp;lt;0.05) similar to obtained for dorsal views (Table 7).  



   
 
 

 

137

In lateral view, 22 relative warps showed shape changes associated with the first canonical 

axes for males and females from Peru, Chile, and Atlantic. The first canonical axis explained 

59% of the observed variation in males and 76% in females. In both males (Wilks’ lambda = 

0.0845, ?2 = 67.9637, d.f. = 44, P = 0.012) (Fig. 11A) and females (Wilks’ lambda = 0.01732, 

?2 = 66.92052, d.f. = 44, P = 0.015) (Fig. 11B), the first canonical axis separated Chilean 

specimens, while the second axis was not significant (P &gt; 0.05). The differences in shape 

were similar to dorsal and ventral views. Burmeister’s porpoises from Peru have smaller skull 

in rostral region compared to specimens from Chile and Atlantic, and the braincase was more 

compressed in males than in females. The orbital and rostral regions were relatively broader 

in porpoises from Atlantic than in Chilean and Peruvian specimens (Fig. 12). In general, the 

Chilean specimens presented an intermediate shape between Peru and Atlantic specimens 

(Fig. 12). The discriminant function on based Mahalanobis distance classified correctly all 

males (Peru = 31, Chile = 6, and Atlantic = 4) (Fig. 11A) and females (Peru = 15, Chile = 8, 

and Atlantic = 7) (Fig. 11B). However, the Mahalanobis distances values obtained were not 

significant among the three geographic areas (P &gt; 0.05) (Table 7).  

Covariation between shape variation and environmental variables.__ For dorsal view, the 

two-block partial least-squares analysis revealed that skull shape was significantly associated 

with environmental variables used in this study. The fist two paired latent variables explain 

92.47% and 5.33% of the total squared covariance (0.0064) between the two set of variables. 

The other singular values were much smaller and not statistically significant. In 999 random 

permutations three singular values (0.30%) were equal to or larger than the observed value for 

the first dimension. For the other dimensions, all of the random samples yielded greater 

squared covariances than were found in the observed data. The first pair of latent variables 

also presented the best correlation (0.85) (Fig. 13B). The other correlations were lower and of 

little interest (even though were statistically significant) because the corresponding latent 



   
 
 

 

138

variables explained so little of the cross-set covariance (Table 8). The results are largely one-

dimensional, because the first dimension explained most of the variance and the other 

dimensions were not statistically significant, we can expect to interpret only the first 

dimension in dorsal view. The first dimension has its greatest negative loadings on latitude 

and oxygen at 50m depth. While that greatest positive loadings were observed on temperature 

- salinity at 0m of depth, and longitude (Table 8). These gradients show the important of 

spatial variation on shape of skull. The Figs. 13G and 13F show the shape differences 

expressed as deformations of the average shape using thin-plate splines, estimating the shapes 

corresponding to a point at the negative and positive extremes observed for the first pair of 

variables. For one-dimensional data, the results can be displayed as a pair of shapes 

representing the observed variation. For point negative extreme, the skull seems to be 

narrower in rostral region and more compressed in braincase (Fig. 13D), and only two 

variables (oxygen at 50m of depth and latitude) showed positive loadings (Fig. 13C). On the 

other hand, for point positive extreme three variables presented negative loadings (Fig. 13E), 

and the shape changes were observed lightly on rostral region, but the skull seems to be more 

broader in rostral and braincase region (Fig. 13F).  

For ventral view, the 2B-PLS analysis showed that skull shape was significantly associated 

with environmental variables use is this study. The fist two paired latent variables explain 

96.40% and 1.84% of the total squared covariance (0.0022) between the two set of variables. 

The other singular values were much smaller and nor statistically significant. In 999 random 

permutations one singular values (0.10%) were equal to or larger than the observed value for 

the first dimension. For the other dimension, all of the random samples yielded greater 

squared covariances than were found in the observed data. The first pair of latent variables 

also presented the best correlation (0.79) (Fig. 14B). The other correlations were lower and of 

little interest (even though were statistically significant) because the corresponding latent 



   
 
 

 

139

variables explained so little of the cross-set covariance (Table 8). In this cranial view, the 

results also were one-dimensional. The first dimension has its greatest negative loadings on 

latitude, and oxygen at 50m depth. While that greatest positive loadings were observed on 

salinity at 50m depth, and temperature at 0m and 50m depth (Table 8). Shape differences 

using thin-plate splines for the point negative extreme showed that five variables presented 

positive loadings (Fig. 14C), and the braincase was more compressed than rostral region (Fig. 

14D). For the point positive extreme, only oxygen at 50m depth and latitude showed greatest 

negative loadings (Fig.14E), and a braincase lightly compressed (Fig. 14F). 

For lateral view, the 2B-PLS analysis revealed that skull shape was significantly associated 

with environmental variables use is this study. The fist two paired latent variables explain 

91.41% and 4.57% of the total squared covariance (0.0051) between the two set of variables. 

The other singular values were much smaller and nor statistically significant. In 999 random 

permutations forty-three singular values (4.3%) were equal to or larger than the observed 

value for the first dimension. The first pair of latent variables also presented the best 

correlation (0.46) (Fig. 15B). The results also were one-dimensional, similar to dorsal and 

ventral views.  The first dimension has its greatest negative loadings on latitude, and oxygen 

at 50 and 0m depth. The greatest positive loadings were observed on salinity at 50 and 0m of 

depth, temperature at 0-50m of depth, and longitude (Table 8). For the points negative and 

positive extremes, the environmental variables presented similar loadings to dorsal view. 

However, for point negative extreme, the salinity at 50m depth showed greatest negative 

loadings than for dorsal view (Fig. 15C). Thin-plate splines showed a skull more compressed 

for the point negative extreme (Fig. 15D) than for point positive extreme (Fig. 15F). This 

confirmed the differences observed by other views (dorsal and ventral), showing that skulls 

from high latitudes have rostrum thinner, and the frontal region is more prominent than skulls 

from low latitudes.

DISCUSSION 

 

We observed sexual dimorphism in skull of physically mature porpoises by traditional and 

geometric morphometrics analyses, being females larger than males.  These methods detected 

differences concentrated in the rostral and braincase region, and the shape differences were 

more explicative in dorsal and lateral views. The sexual dimorphism observed in this study 

corroborates the differences by sex found by Molina-Schiller (2006), but not coincident with 

the results found by Reyes and van Waerebeek (1995) using cranial measurements. These 

authors say that skulls of males from Peru are larger than females, but they used skulls of 

Burmeister’s porpoises sexually mature and the sample size was small.   

Although the samples used in this study are small (especially from Chile and Atlantic), a 

clear geographical variation pattern among Burmeister’s porpoises from Peru, Chile and 

Atlantic was detected by traditional and geometric morphometrics methods. In general, males 

and females from Peru were smaller in several measures (e.g., condylobasal length, zygomatic 

width, distance from tip of rostrum to external nares, and width of rostrum at midlength, 

characters associated to braincase and feeding functional apparatus) in relation to 

Burmeister’s porpoises from Chile and Atlantic. This indicates that P. spinipinnis from Peru 

are shorter in rostral region and broader (or robust) in neurocranium than porpoises from 

Chile and Atlantic. In addition, traditional methods by canonical discriminant analysis 

showed that greatest width of premaxillae is useful for separate Peruvian specimens of the 

other geographic areas.  

Burmeister’s porpoises from Chile presented a size and shape intermediate between 

Peruvian and Atlantic specimens, whereas that porpoises from Atlantic were relatively longer 

than Chilean specimens. On the other hand, the orbital region was relatively larger in males 

and females from Atlantic than Chilean porpoises. Females from Chile and Atlantic showed a 



   
 
 

 

141

rostrum thinner and larger than Peruvian specimens, while that Burmeister’s porpoises from 

Atlantic were larger than females from Chile, mainly related to skull height, orbital region 

(greatest postorbital width), and rostral region (width of rostrum from base, greatest width 

pterygoid). These differences were supported by squared Mahalanobis distances, showing a 

larger separation among porpoises from Peru and Atlantic, while that these differences were 

smaller between specimens from Chile and Atlantic. These results corroborate the proposed 

by Corcuera et al. (1995). These authors, based in body size suggested that Burmeister’s 

porpoises from the South Atlantic coast are larger than those from the South Pacific.  

Geometric morphometrics was more explicative to show differences between specimens 

from Chile and Atlantic, especially for dorsal and ventral views, showing that males are more 

variable in skull shape than females.  

The utilization of correction factor for obtained zwitter specimens was very useful for 

verify the differences in size among Burmeister’s porpoises without the influence of the 

sexual dimorphism. The canonical discriminant analyses distinguish 100% of specimens from 

Peru, Chile and Atlantic. The analyses corroborate with squared Mahalanobis distances values 

showing a clear geographic separation among specimens from Peru, Chile, and Atlantic, 

where the larger distances were observed among porpoises from Peru and Atlantic, and the 

smaller distances were between Burmeister’s porpoises from Chile - Atlantic, corroborating 

with the observed geometric morphometrics patterns. On the other hand, the canonical 

discriminant analysis showed that greatest postorbital width is useful for distinguishing 

specimens from three geographic areas.  

Perrin (1984) discussed patterns of geographical variation in small cetaceans, showing that 

small cetaceans vary sharply over sometimes relatively short distances. Differences in body 

shape, colorations and skull size were observed between animals in enclosed/open seas 

(dolphins in enclosed or semi-enclosed tend to be smaller than those of the same species in 



   
 
 

 

142

the open ocean), whereas that differences in size and shape of skull, body length, and 

colorations were found between dolphins in inshore/offshore waters (offshore forms tend to 

be larger than inshore specimens). Other examples about geographical variation were 

observed in small coastal cetaceans with longer distribution, showing differences in size and 

shape (e.g., P. blainvillei, Ramos et al. 2002; Neophocaena phocaenoides, Jefferson 2002; 

Orcaella brevirostris, Beasley et al. 2002).  

Very few analyses are available that document the association between morphological and 

environmental variation in marine mammals (e.g., Perrin 1984; Schnell et al. 1986). In Pacific 

coast, porpoises form Peru and Chile showed a clinal distribution, coincident with Bergmann's 

Rule (Bergmann 1847). This is a principle that correlates environmental temperature with 

body mass in warm-blooded animals. It asserts that within a species, the body mass increases 

with latitude and colder climate. Among mammals and birds, individuals of a particular 

species in colder areas tend to have greater body mass than individuals in warmer areas (e.g., 

Mayr 1973; Roberts 1953, 1978; Ruff 1994; Schreider 1950). The correlation between linear 

variables and environmental variables as covariation between shape variation and 

environmental variables showed that specimens from Pacasmayo (07°24'S; 79°35'18"W) 

northern Peru to Paracas (13º50'S; 76º14'W) southern Peru showed a shorter rostrum and a 

less compressed braincase. These specimens were associated to low latitudes, with more 

temperate waters, less oxygenated and more saline waters. In addition, it has the influence of 

the Humboldt Current, which involves upwelling that carries colder water rich in nutrients, 

and oxygen minimum zone (OMZs) (Escribano et al. 2003; Molina-Schiller et al. 2005; Strub 

et al. 1998; Tarazona and Arntz 2001).  

Burmeister’s porpoises from Chile presented a longer and thinner region rostral and a 

frontal region more prominent than skulls from low latitudes. Chilean porpoises were 

associated to high latitudes, austral waters more oxygenated; it has the influence of the 



   
 
 

 

143

Humboldt Current (influence of upwelling) and downwelling processes, Cape Horn Current, 

and less saline waters by freshwater contributions from fjords, glaciers and rivers (Blanco et 

al., 2001; Molina-Schiller et al. 2005; Panella et al. 1991).  

On the other hand, in the Atlantic coast the skulls of P. spinipinnis were larger than porpoises 

from Pacific coast, however, the clinal distribution and Bergmann's Rule were not observed. 

This are is characterized by the confluence of the Brasil Current and Malvinas Current results 

in complex meso-scale circulation patterns like warm or cold-core rings, eddies, and filaments 

(Legeckis &amp;amp; Gordon 1982, Olson et al. 1988, Gayoso &amp;amp; Podestá 1996). The distribution 

ranges of Burmeister’s porpoises from south of the La Plata River, Argentina to Santa 

Catarina, Brazil should be associated to Subtropical Convergence (Molina-Schiller et al. 

2005). These authors suggest that Burmeister’s porpoises present a continuous distribution 

from Paita, Peru (05°01’S, 81°W) to La Plata River basin, Argentina (~38°S), being able to 

reach Uruguayan and Brazilian waters under certain oceanographic characteristics (intrusion 

of colder and less saline waters toward the north associated with the Subtropical 

Convergence). The zone between 30ºS and 40ºS has a high variability in physical and 

chemical properties and represents an ecotone of high biological diversity, with freshwater 

contributions from rivers, the basin of La Plata River, and the estuarine system of Patos 

Laggon (Calliari et al. 2003; Panella et al. 1991; Piola et al. 2000; Sabatini et al. 2004). In 

addition, peaks of phytoplankton biomass have been found associated with frontal structures 

(Gayoso and Podestá 1996). Marine mammal diversification thus could be closely related to 

nearshore upwelling through primary production and the availability of a variety of prey 

species (Lipps and Mitchell 1976). Important upwelling zone are found to north of Santa 

Catarina, Brazil (Matsura 1986; Pereira 1989; Silva et al., 1984). 

 



   
 
 

 

144

Morphological differences maybe related to feeding, ecology, perhaps to differing size and 

toughness of major prey species (Perrin 1975; Ross 1979). The interruption or change in 

regular feeding habits caused by environmental events can influence the growth of 

individuals. The Humboldt Current System with its coastal upwelling ecosystem off Peru and 

Chile is recognized as a highly productive region, sustaining the large fisheries of anchovy 

and sardine (Alheit and Bernal 1993; Mann and Lazier 1991; Walsh 1991). However, 

Burmeister’s porpoise in the upwelling system might be particularly vulnerable to local 

depletion as they inhabit a very rich, but unstable environment (e.g., recurrent El Niño 

events), because El Niño is more intense along the Peruvian coast, than the Chilean coast 

(Molina-Schiller 2006). These authors recorded three types of anomalies (marker lines, 

cemental disturbance, dentinal resorption) in teeth of seven individuals from Peru colleted 

between 1984 to 1998. The marker lines seem to be associated to environmental factors, 

because the data formation of these marker lines is coincident with events “El Niño”.  

Changes in size and age structure of population are expected when subjected to fishing 

effort, usually reducing mean body size and reproductive age (Jennings et al. 2001), and the 

Burmeister’s porpoise from Peru is one the most common smalls cetacean in Peruvian waters, 

suffers the second highest fishing mortality (Brownell and Praderi 1982; Goodall et al. 1995b; 

Reyes and van Waerebeeck 1995; van Waerebeeck et al. 2002). The impact of incidental 

catches on a population may affect recruitment rates and may produce changes in growth rates 

of the individuals of that population (Gearin et al. 1994). The different body sizes and growth 

patterns may occur with population stock independent of latitudinal distribution (Ramos et al. 

2002). In addition, recent studies support genetic differentiation among Burmeister’s 

porpoises from Peru and Chile-Argentina (Rosa et al. 2005). However, these authors did not 

observe genetic differences among Burmeister’s porpoises from Queule, southern Chile 

(39°22'S), and Tierra del Fuego, Argentina.  



   
 
 

 

145

Geographic variation provides a basis for the description of stock units used to assess and 

manage dolphins (Schnell et al. 1986). Our results based in linear and geometric 

morphometrics suggest that geographical variation exists among Burmeister’s porpoises from 

Peru, Chile and Atlantic, with smaller individuals distributed between Pacasmayo, northern 

Peru (07°24'S) to Paracas, southern Peru (13º50'S); larger specimens distributed from Chubut, 

southern Argentina (?42º46'S) to North, and P. spinipinnis with shape and size intermediate 

distributed from San Antonio, central Chile (33º30'S) to Strait of Magellan, southern Chile 

(?52°30'S).  

A factor that must be considered in the results obtained in this study is the temporal 

difference between the data collected from the different locations, as well as the sampling 

type may have an influence on the size of specimens analysed. We recommende further 

studies to evaluate the differences found in this study. Further investigation on 

morphological-environmental variation would benefit not only from more and larger samples, 

but also from accumulation of other types of data. For example, detailed information on 

reproductive strategies, food habits of Burmeister’s porpoises could provide insight 

concerning the relationship between functional morphology and feeding behavior, as well as a 

stronger basis for judging the significance of geographic trends in morphology. Genetic 

studies using teeth of the specimens examined in this study are being carried out, in order to 

verify the differences detected in this study.

RESUMEN 

 

Cráneos de 102 P. spinipinnis físicamente maduros (61 machos y 41 hembras) fueron 

examinados para explorar la variación geográfica en tamaño y forma a través de morfometria 

tradicional y geométrica. Los cráneos provienen de museos y colecciones científicas de Perú, 

Chile, Argentina, Uruguay y Brasil. A través de análisis de ANOVA/MANOVA los 

especimenes fueron separados en tres áreas geográficas Perú (42 machos y 18 hembras), Chile 

(13 machos y 15 hembras) y Atlántico (6 machos y 8 hembras). Diferencias en tamaño y 

forma fueron analizadas usando 28 medidas lineares. Estas diferencias también fueron 

investigadas a través de morfometria geométrica aplicadas a imágenes bidimensionales de 

240 cráneos en las posiciones dorsal, ventral y lateral. Además, el método de cuadrados 

mínimos de dos block (2B-PLS) fue usado para explorar el patrón de covariación entre la 

variación de forma usando escores de deformaciones parciales y un set de variables 

ambientales (latitud, longitud, temperatura, salinidad y oxigeno a 0 y 50m de profundidad, 

respectivamente). Dimorfismo sexual en tamaño y forma fue observado en cráneos de P. 

spinipinnis de las tres áreas geográficas, con  hembras más grandes que los machos. Los 

resultados obtenidos usando morfometria linear y morfometria geométrica sugieren que existe 

variación geográfica entre P. spinipinnis del Atlántico, Chile y Perú, con individuos más 

pequeños distribuidos entre Pacasmayo, norte de Perú (07°24'S) hasta Paracas, sur del Perú 

(13º50'S) y especimenes más grandes distribuidos desde el Chubut, sur de Argentina 

(?42º46'S) hacia el norte. Especimenes de San Antonio, Chile central (33º30'S) hasta el 

Estrecho de Magallanes, sur de Chile (?52°30'S) mostraron una forma y tamaño intermedia en 

relación a las marsopas de Perú y Atlántico. Morfometria geométrica fue más útil para 

mostrar las diferencias entre los especimenes, mostrando que los machos son más variables en 

la forma del cráneo que las hembras; mientras que las hembras de Chile y Atlántico presentan 



   
 
 

 

147

menor diferencia en la forma del cráneo. Las diferencias observadas en tamaño y forma de los 

cráneos de P. spinipinnis de las tres áreas geográficas parecen estar relacionada al patrón 

oceanográfico asociado en su distribución. Para evaluar las diferencias entre marsopas de 

Chile y  Perú investigaciones adicionales (morfométricas y genéticas) son necesarias desde 

Chile central (33ºS) al norte.

CONSIDERAÇÕES FINAIS 

Estudos morfométricos, genéticos e ambientais são necessários para conhecer e avaliar 

padrões de variação geográfica, permitindo assim, estabelecer unidades de manejo (Management 

Units - MUS) (MORITZ, 1994; EIZIRIK, 1996) e unidades evolutivamente significativas 

(Evolutionary Significant Units - ESUs) (RYDER, 1986; WAPLES, 1991, 1995; DIZON et al., 

1992; MORITZ, 1994). Porém, o conhecimento do tamanho, estrutura e status (tendências em 

abundância e distribuição ao longo do tempo) de populações de cetáceos é indispensável para o 

estabelecimento de programas de conservação eficientes (REEVES &amp;amp; LEATHERWOOD, 1994).  

Os resultados obtidos neste estudo contribuem para o conhecimento da biologia e ecologia 

do boto-de-Burmeister, Phocoena spinipinnis no Atlântico e Pacífico Sul, o que servirá como 

base para propôr futuros estudos de manejo e conservação a nível local e regional. 

Na caracterização ambiental na costa Pacifica e Atlântica realizada (utilizando dados históricos 

de 1965 a 2000 da temperatura do mar, salinidade e oxigênio dissolvido a 0 e 50m de 

profundidade) observou-se que a distribuição de P. spinipinnis estaria associada a padrões 

oceanográficos nos dois oceanos. Neste contexto, propõem-se três áreas oceanográficas 

associadas a sua distribuição: (1) de Paita, Peru (05°01’S, 81ºW) até o sul do golfo de 

Arauco, Chile (?39°S), que apresenta a influência da corrente de Humboldt (caracterizada pela 

sistema de upwelling, - com águas ricas em nutrientes, frias, salinas) e baixas em oxigênio pela 

zona do mínimo oxigênio; (2) do sul do golfo de Arauco, até o sul do Rio da Prata (?38°S), 

caracterizada pela influência das corrente do Cabo de Hornos e a corrente das Malvinas, e que 

envolve processos de  downwelling  (com aportes de água doce provenientes dos fiordes, glaciais 

e rios); e (3) do Rio da Prata até Santa Catarina, Brasil (28º48’S; 49°12W), caracterizada pela 

influência da corrente do Brasil e pelas contribuições da água doce da bacia do Rio da Prata e do 



   
 
 

 

184

sistema estuarino da Laguna dos Patos. Considerando esses resultados propõe-se que P. 

spinipinnis apresenta uma distribuição continua desde Paita, Peru até a bacia do Rio da Prata, 

Argentina, podendo alcançar águas uruguaias e brasileiras quando segue a pluma da 

Convergência Subtropical (com águas costeiras mais frias e menos salinas) (SILVA et al., 1984; 

GUERRERO et al., 1997; PIMENTA, 2001). A formação de ressurgências, correntes, frentes 

oceânicas, termoclimas e outros processos oceanográficos possibilitam uma riqueza faunística 

(BLACKBURN, 1965; LAEVASTU, 1996; LONGHURST et al., 1995). A Convergência 

Subtropical do Atlântico Sudoeste é um exemplo de caso, influenciando em processos de 

enriquecimento de águas que acabam concentrando grande quantidade de organismos. Ao norte 

de Santa Catarina encontram-se importantes zonas de resurgencias (MATSURA, 1986; 

PEREIRA, 1989; SILVA et al., 1984), e a diversidade de mamíferos marinhos esta em estreita 

relação com a productividade primaria e disponibilidade de peixes associada à upwelling 

próximo da costa (LIPPS &amp;amp; MITCHELL 1976). 

Análises dos dentes através de cortes finos de 25?m revelaram que a dentina apresenta 

uma ótima resolução para a leitura da idade através dos grupos de camadas de crescimento 

(GLGs), enquanto que no cimento as GLGs foram ausentes ou apresentaram pouca resolução, 

não sendo adequadas para as leitura da idade. A largura média da primeira GLG na dentina foi 

maior nos machos do que nas fêmeas, e também apresentou diferenças geográficas entre botos do 

Peru e Atlântico (sendo maior nos exemplares do Chile, seguido pelos botos do Peru e Atlântico). 

Por outro lado, a capa acessória central presente na primeira GLG revelou diferenças entre os 

exemplares do Chile e Atlântico. Três tipos de anomalias foram registrados (linhas marcadoras, 

reabsorção dentinal e distúrbios no cimento) em dentes de sete botos-de-Burmeister coletados no 



   
 
 

 

185

Peru entre 1984 até 1998. As linhas marcadoras parecem estar associadas a fatores ambientais (a 

data sua formação coincide com o evento El Niño. 

Análises morfométricas revelaram dimorfismo sexual (através de funções discriminantes) 

em crânios de P. spinipinnis, permitindo não apenas separar machos das fêmeas como determinar 

o sexo em animais de sexo desconhecido o que possibilitou a utilização de todos os crânios nas 

análises de crescimento. A idade máxima registrada em machos e fêmeas foi de 10 anos. 

Contudo, a falta de animais de faixas etárias entre 1-2 anos (principalmente nas fêmeas) foi um 

fator limitante na determinação da idade de maturidade física dos crânios de P. spinipinnis. Por 

conseguinte, a maturidade física do crânio foi estabelecida quando o comprimento côndilo-basal 

atingiu 95% do comprimento (ou seja, os crânios foram considerados fisicamente adultos com 

um comprimento côndilo-basal ?266mm nos machos e ?277mm nas fêmeas). Posteriormente, os 

crânios foram separados em machos, fêmeas, adultos ou jovens, através de uma função 

discriminante.  

O dimorfismo sexual observado nas análises anteriores foi corroborado em crânios de 

exemplares fisicamente adultos, através de dois métodos: morfometria tradicional e morfometria 

geométrica, sendo as fêmeas maiores do que os machos, e as diferenças em tamanho e forma 

concentram-se principalmente na região rostral e no neurocrânio. Contudo, as posições dorsal e 

lateral evidenciaram melhor o dimorfismo sexual na forma do crânio.  

As diferenças morfométricas obtidas nos dois métodos indicam variação geográfica entre 

botos do Atlântico, Chile e Peru. Em geral, os crânios de P. spinipinnis do Peru apresentam um 

tamanho menor em relação aos botos do Chile e Atlântico no comprimento côndilo-basal, largura 

do zigomático, distância entre a ponta do rostro até as narinas e na largura do rostro na metade do 

comprimento. Estes elementos indicam que os espécimes de P. spinipinnis do Peru apresentam o 



   
 
 

 

186

rostro mais curto e o neurocrânio ligeiramente mais largo. Os exemplares do Chile apresentam 

forma e tamanho intermediários entre animais do Peru e do Atlântico, enquanto que os botos do 

Atlântico são maiores do que os animais do Peru e do Chile, especialmente na região orbital, 

altura do crânio e região rostral. Os valores obtidos através da distância de Mahalanobis 

corroboraram as diferenças observadas entre áreas geográficas, indicando que a maior separação 

ocorre entre P. spinipinnis do Peru e Atlântico. Entretanto, a menor distância ocorre entre botos 

do Chile e Atlântico.  

A morfometria geométrica revelou-se como a melhor ferramenta para apresentar as 

diferenças entre botos do Chile e Atlântico, especialmente nas vistas dorsal e ventral, denotando 

que a forma dos machos varia mais do que a forma das fêmeas e que os exemplares do Chile e 

Atlântico (em especial as fêmeas) apresentam diferenças menos significativas na forma.  

Os crânios podem ser separados por área geográfica através de funções discriminantes 

obtidas pelo método tradicional. Quinze caracteres nos machos e três caracteres nas fêmeas 

separam os crânios das três áreas geográficas. Destacamos também que a largura máxima da pré-

maxila é útil para separar animais do Peru das outras áreas geográficas.  

Contudo, ao utilizar zwitter indivíduos (crânios sem a influência do sexo) a função 

discriminante separou os crânios do Atlântico, Chile e Peru apenas com um caracter (a largura 

máxima do pós-orbital).  

As correlações entre variáveis ambientais e morfométricas na morfometria tradicional e 

morfometria geométrica sugerem que as diferenças observadas no tamanho e forma dos crânios 

teriam uma importante influência espacial, relacionada principalmente a variações na 

temperatura, salinidade e oxigênio. Assim os espécimes de San Antonio, centro do Chile 

(33º30'S; 73°13'W) até Santa Catarina, sul do Brasil (28º48’S; 49°12W) estariam associados a 



   
 
 

 

187

águas mais frias, menos salinas e mais oxigenadas, apresentando crânios maiores (maior 

comprimento do rostro, altura do crânio e região orbital) em relação ao boto-de-Burmeister do 

Peru (que apresenta um crânio mais curto no comprimento do rostro), e que poderia ser associado 

a águas mais temperadas, menos oxigenadas e mais salinas.  

As diferenças morfométricas observadas neste estudo serão comparadas com estudos 

genéticos que já se encontram em fase de desenvolvimento. As análises genéticas estão sendo 

realizadas a partir de DNA extraído dos dentes dos espécimes analisados neste estudo e são de 

vital importância para o esclarecimento das diferenças geográficas aqui demonstradas e para se 

determinar se os espécimes de P. spinipinnis das três áreas geográficas (Atlântico, Chile e Peru) 

representam estoques diferentes. 

   



   
 
 

 

188

RECOMENDAÇÕES 

 

1) Recomenda-se a realização de estudos de crescimento com um tamanho amostral maior, a fim 

de estabelecer a maturidade física dos crânios para cada sexo e área geográfica, o que 

permitirá esclarecer melhor as diferenças observadas neste estudo;  

2) Embora diferenças morfométricas na forma e no tamanho tenham sido observadas entre os 

crânios de P. spinipinnis do Chile e Peru, estudos morfométricos e genéticos precisam ser 

realizados para diferenciar estoques entre os exemplares do Peru e o norte do Chile (30ºS ao 

norte);  

3) Estudos sobre ecologia trófica, reprodução (determinação da idade da maturidade sexual), 

status (tendências em abundância e distribuição no espaço e no tempo) nas diferentes áreas, 

são de grande importância para se conhecer o padrão de variação geográfica da espécie; 

4) Considerando que o boto-de-Burmeister, é uma espécie costeira, as atividades antrópicas (e.g. 

capturas acidentais e diretas, degradação do habitat pelo tráfego marítimo, poluição, 

exploração dos recursos) e efeitos ambientais (e.g. El Niño Oscilação Sul - ENOS) precisam 

ser avaliados a escala local e regional, pois tais fatores podem provocar relações denso-

dependentes, que regulam os parâmetros populacionais como tamanho populacional, tamanho 

dos indivíduos e/ou idade da maturidade sexual.

NORMAS PARA O ENVIO DE PUBLICAÇÃO NO PERIÓDICO: 

The Latin American Journal of Aquatic Mammals 

 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS 

The Scope 

The Latin American Journal of Aquatic Mammals (LAJAM) will publish research on aquatic 
mammals in Latin America, regardless the nationality of the authors. Articles on techniques 
which the region or nationality of the authors is of no matter will also be accepted.  

Language 

Manuscripts must be written in either "American" or "British" English; however, authors should 
be consistent along the text. By using English as its official language, LAJAM will be more 
readily available, and of greater relevance, to the global aquatic mammal research community. 
Papers should normally be in the passive voice unless an opinion needs to be clearly attributed to 
the Authors. The abstract must also be written in English, with an additional version in either 
Portuguese or Spanish also provided. It is recognized that English may not be the first language 
for most authors. Therefore, the Editorial Board will work with the authors to ensure that the 
paper is written in good English. 

Types of manuscript 

Articles report results of original research. They should normally not exceed 30 pages of text 
(Title page, Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Materials and methods, Results, Discussion, 
Acknowledgements, References).  

Notes are brief reports of original research. They should normally not exceed 14 pages of text. 
They may be organized like articles, with formal headings, or preferably more simply (no 
headings except for Acknowledgements and References).  

Reviews must address topics of general interest or current importance to the Latin American 
aquatic mammal research community. They should be synthetic in nature (i.e. summarize the 
topic), rather than present large amounts of detailed information. Reviews will be considered for 
publication only after invitation by, or agreement with, the Managing Editors.  



   
 
 

 

202

Comments are short critiques of papers previously published in LAJAM. Authors of the original 
paper being discussed will be invited to reply to these critiques.  

Short Communications are brief reports of 1 or 2 paragraphs dedicated to inform about unusual 
sightings, strandings, incidental captures or other issues. Proof of species identification (such as 
photographs or detailed sketches of prominent or conspicuous features) must be provided.  

 
Format 

Manuscripts should be typed in A4 paper, with double line spacing and all margins set to 2.5cm 
(1in). All text should be typed using Times New Roman font of size 12. Headings should be in 
bold (e.g. Introduction). If additional sub-headings are required, these should appear in italics 
(e.g. Data analysis). 

Page numbering should start at the Title page, with the page numbers appearing centred at the 
bottom of each page. 

Title page: Should contain a concise and informative title, and a list of authors' names and 
addresses. The corresponding author should be indicated, and an email address for that author, if 
available, should also be provided. Keywords (in English) should also be stated. 

Abstract page: Should contain an abstract in English, as well as a version in either Portuguese or 
Spanish. Abstracts should not exceed 350 words. 

Body of the manuscript: Should contain the Introduction, Materials and methods, Results, 
Discussion, Acknowledgements, and References.  

Please be brief in the Acknowledgements.  

References should be formatted according to the following examples: 

DeMaster, D. P., Edwards, E. F., Wade, P. and Sisson, J. E. (1992) Status of dolphin stocks in the 
eastern tropical Pacific. Pages 1038-1050 in McCullough, D. R. and Barrett, R. H. (Eds) Wildlife 
2001: Populations. Elsevier Science Publishers Ltd., London.

203

Important note: abstracts can be quoted (just like personal communications can) and placed in 
footnotes. The format should be as follows: 

Dalla Rosa, L., Secchi, E. R., Kinas, P. G., Santos, M. C. O., Zerbini, A. N. and Bassoi, M. 
(1999) Photo-identification and density estimation of humpback whales in Antarctic waters. Page 
43 in Abstracts, XIII Biennial Conference on the Biology of Marine Mammals, 28 November - 3 
December, Maui, Hawaii.  

Only month and year are compulsory for conference dates in the reference. Full date (including 
days) is preferable if available.  

References containing more than two authors should appear in the text as, for example, Di 
Beneditto et al. (2001). When more than one reference is cited at a time, references should appear 
in chronological order (e.g. DeMaster et al., 1992; Palacios and Mate, 1996; Dalla Rosa et al., 
1999; Di Beneditto et al., 2001; Gerpe et al., 2002). When citing two or more papers from the 
same authors, published in the same year, use lower case letters in italics to differentiate between 
the papers (e.g. Siciliano et al., 2000a,b).  

TABLES: Each table should be presented on a separate page, with the table caption placed at the 
top of the page. Tables should be numbered Table 1, Table 2, etc. Authors should try to ensure 
that as many tables as possible do not exceed 8.5cm in width, when printed in Times Roman 8pt 
(or similar). The maximum permitted width of any table is 17.5cm. 

FIGURES: Each figure should be presented on a separate page, with the figure caption placed at 
the bottom of the page. Figures should be numbered Figure 1, Figure 2, etc. 

Photographs and artwork: The inclusion of photographs in a paper is very expensive. Therefore 
we only publish photographs that are an essential part of the paper (for example, photographs that 
would serve to confirm the identification of a species which is extremely difficult to be positively 
identified at sea). High quality black and white photographs are recommended. Colour print 
photos will be at the authors' expenses. 

Where possible, please submit photographs and/or artwork in an electronic format (e.g. .bmp, 
.tif). Tabulated x,y data files should also be provided for graphs. This will allow, where 
necessary, graphs to be plotted in our standard style using Excel 8.0. Artwork is expensive. 
Where possible, single column artwork (width 8.5cm) is preferred. The maximum allowable 
width is 17.5cm. Lettering should be in Arial, Helvetica or a similar font (10pt).  

EQUATIONS: Authors are asked to submit equations created in either Microsoft Equation 
Editor© (the default supplied with several word-processing packages, including Microsoft 
Word© and WordPerfect©) or its upgrade called MathType©.  

CETACEAN NAMES: Please use approved IWC (International Whaling Commission) common 
names in the text. For the sake of cultural values, regional names could be used if the 
international name is referred to at least once. Scientific name must be quoted after the first time 
the common name is mentioned. Afterwards it should be left up to the authors and at the editor's 



   
 
 

 

204

discretion (for instance, papers on taxonomy may need to quote scientific names several times). 
Scientific name must be placed in parentheses after the common name. 

CAPITALS: examples are given below: 

Area (when referring to official Area names - e.g. Area I, Franciscana Management Area, etc.), 
Sector, Division, Antarctic, South Atlantic Ocean, Northern Hemisphere, Scientific Committee, 
Table 1, Fig. 1, Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Blainville's beaked whale and Commerson's dolphin 
(i.e. where named after a person); but western South Atlantic, sub-committee, sub-Antarctic, 
humpback whale, bottlenose dolphin, etc. 

Numbers, dates, map references: In the text, numbers under 10 should be spelled out fully where 
used individually. Arabic numerals should be used for a sequence of quantities and in reference 
to percentages (where % rather than percent is used): e.g. three humpback whales but 3% of 
humpback whales; 1 fin whale, 4 Bryde's whales and 9 southern right whales were observed. 

Numbers with four or more figures should have no spaces: e.g. 1328; 9369234; 1540.5 

Decimal points should be indicated by full stops, not commas. Zeros should be included: e.g. 
0.86 

There should be no space between numbers and abbreviated units: e.g. 114cm, 16kg 

All units should be metric. 

Dates should be in the form: 12 March 1996 not April 14, 1977 

Geographic coordinates should be in the form: 32º05'55"S, 52º08'12"W 

HYPHENS: should be used in compound adjectives preceding a noun, e.g. age-specific survival 
rates, length-specific model. But not where part of the compound adjective consists of a numeral, 
e.g. 8cm long testis, 35ppm water.  

ABBREVIATIONS: Where the last letter of an abbreviation is the same as the last letter of the 
full word then no full stop is necessary: e.g. Fig. 1 but Figs 1-7 

Acronyms or capital abbreviations do not require full stops: e.g. IWC, FMA, MSYR, 25°S, CV, 
SD, SE etc. 

Commonly used abbreviations for units have no full stop: e.g. 10cm, 15m, 32ft 

Generic names (e.g. Pontoporia blainvillei) must be originally written in full but may 
subsequently be abbreviated (e.g. P. blainvillei). 

If a personal communication is used, abbreviate as 'pers. comm.'.  



   
 
 

 

205

ITALICS: Should be used for: references to titles of books and periodicals (e.g. Moby Dick); 
names of vessels (e.g. Ary Rongel, Atlântico Sul); Latin names of plants and animals (e.g. 
Coprosma foetidissima); foreign words not part of everyday English (e.g. et al., i.e., e.g.); trade 
names (e.g. Serramalte). 

QUOTATIONS: Use single quotation marks. Double quotation marks are only to be used for a 
quote within a quote. Within a quotation, follow the style and punctuation of the original. If 
omitting a section, indicate by three full stops '…'. If interpolating a word or phrase please use 
square brackets [my italics].  

EQUATIONS, MATHEMATICAL REFERENCES: Ensure that superscripts and subscripts are 
easily discernible. Clearly distinguish between: the letter l and the number 1 (e.g. by underlining 
the letter); and the letter O and the number 0. Use italics for letters indicating parameters, e.g. y = 
a + bx

NORMAS PARA O ENVIO DE PUBLICAÇÃO NO PERIÓDICO: 

Marine Mammal Science 

 
 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS 

MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE publishes significant new findings on marine mammals 
resulting from original research on their form and function, evolution, systematics, physiology, 
biochemistry, behavior, population biology, life history, genetics, ecology and conservation.  
Range extensions, unusual observations of behavior, and preliminary studies of a few individuals 
are published only where there is sufficient new information to render the manuscript of general 
interest.  Low priority will be given to confirmatory investigations of local or regional interest.  

The Journal endorses the principle that experiments using live animals should be undertaken only 
for the purpose of advancing knowledge. Consideration should be given to the appropriateness of 
experimental procedures, species of animals used, and number of animals required. All animal 
experimentation reported in MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE must be conducted in conformity 
with the relevant animal care codes of the country of origin. The Editor will refuse manuscripts in 
which evidence of adherence to such codes is not apparent.  

MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE publishes (1) Articles: important original research; (2) Review 
articles: critical appraisals which place recent research in a new conceptual framework; (3) 
Notes: short communications on current research, important preliminary findings or new 
techniques; (4) Opinions: invited contributions on selected topics; (5) Letters: a forum for 
communications in response to papers previously published in MARINE MAMMAL 
SCIENCE, opinion, interpretation, and new information on all topics of interest to marine 
mammalogists.  

Articles, Review articles and Notes are subject to peer review. Any Letter challenging published 
results or interpretations is transmitted to the author of the published work with an invitation to 
respond. The letter and its response are published simultaneously. Letters are judged by the 
Editor on appropriateness of the subject and interest to readers.  

MANUSCRIPT PREPARATION  

The manuscript should be concise, logical, and unequivocal. Publication is facilitated if authors 
double-check for typographical and other errors and ensure that manuscripts and figures meet the 
requirements outlined below. Manuscripts that do not conform will be returned for correction 



   
 
 

 

207

before consideration. If in doubt, consult the Editorial Office. Authors are charged for excessive 
changes in proof. 

A full-length Article includes a title page, abstract, keywords, text, acknowledgments, literature 
citations, tables, figure captions, and figures. Notes and Letters do not have an abstract and are 
prepared in narrative form without headings, except for "Literature Cited."  

All parts of the manuscript, including footnotes, tables, and figure captions, should be 
typewritten, double-spaced with margins at least 2.5 cm wide. Underline only when the material 
is to be set in italics. Use capital letters only when the letters or words are to be capitalized. Do 
not end a line of text with a hyphen.  

TITLE PAGE  

The first page should contain only the title and the name, affiliation, and complete address (plus 
current address, if different) of the author(s). The title should be brief and contain words useful 
for indexing and information retrieval.  

ABSTRACT AND KEY WORDS  

The abstract, of not more than 200 words typed on a separate page, should precisely reflect the 
contents of the paper, and focus attention on the purpose of the study, principal results, 
conclusions and their significance.  

Below the abstract, provide and identify as such three to ten key words or short phrases that will 
assist in cross-indexing your article.  

TEXT  

As a general guide, The Chicago Manual of Style is recommended. Spelling should be standard 
U.S. (not British) to conform to Webster's Third New International Dictionary. Units should 
conform to the Systeme International d'Unites (SI). Non-standard abbreviations must be defined 
the first time they appear. Mathematical symbols, Greek letters, and unusual symbols should be 
identified clearly; superscripts and subscripts should be legible and carefully placed.  

STANDARD ABBREVIATIONS  

General: s, min, h (hour), d (day), wk, mo, yr, g (gram), mg, kg, Hz, kHz, MHz, km, m (meter), 
mm, cm, cc, mi (mile), ft, in. (note period), kn (knot), ha, gal, ml, l (liter, spell out when used 
alone).

NORMAS PARA O ENVIO DE PUBLICAÇÃO NO PERIÓDICO: 

Revista Chilena de Historia Natural 

 

INSTRUCIONES A LOS AUTORES 

La Revista Chilena de Historia Natural (RCHN) publica artículos en las áreas de Ecofisiología, 
Ecología Conductual, Ecología de Poblaciones y de Comunidades, Ecología del Paisaje y 
Ecología de Ecosistemas, Oceanografía Biológica, Sistemática, Taxonomía, Evolución Orgánica, 
Genética de Poblaciones, Biogeografía, Paleobiología, Botánica y Zoología. El énfasis de la 
Revista son las Ciencias Básicas y, secundariamente, aspectos más aplicados como conservación 
y manejo de recursos biológicos. En estas temáticas, la Revista enfatiza además artículos que 
sometan a prueba hipótesis en forma explicita, o que propongan explicaciones novedosas. La 
Revista publica artículos científicos, revisiones temáticas, conferencias, comentarios, simposios, 
editoriales, documentos, revisiones de libros y Cartas al Editor, en Español y en Inglés.  

Para facilitar la búsqueda de revisores idóneos, los trabajos sobre Morfología, Sistemática y 
Taxonomía solo serán considerados en inglés. Las contribuciones en estas diferentes categorías 
son sometidas al juicio crítico del Comité Editorial, el que se hace asesorar por al menos dos 
revisores. La Revista está abierta tanto a socios como no socios de la Sociedad de Biología de 
Chile. Los costos de publicación de artículos aceptadod en RCHN son de USD 26,00 por página 
final impresa. Su aparición es trimestral y cuatro números conforman un volumen. La recepción 
de trabajos es continua, publicándose en orden de aceptación. Se deja constancia de las 
respectivas fechas de recepción inicial y de aceptación definitiva de los manuscritos.  
Los trabajos que se presenten deben estar escritos en mayúsculas y minúsculas (incluyendo 
títulos y subtítulos), a doble espacio (incluyendo tablas), en letra tipo“Times New Roman” de 12 
puntos, en hojas tamaño carta con márgenes de 2,5 cm y líneas numeradas. Cada página, 
incluyendo tablas y leyendas de figuras, debe numerarse en forma correlativa y llevar el apellido 
de los autores en el margen superior derecho (ejemplo: González 21); en caso de múltiple autoría 
se utiliza la forma et al. a continuación del primer autor. Los manuscritos solo serán sometidos a 
través de correo electrónico. Para ello, los autores deberán enviar un (1) archivo en formato Word 
o (de preferencia) PDF con el contenido íntegro del trabajo (incluyendo tablas y figuras si 
corresponde), más un segundo archivo con la carta de presentación correspondiente a: 
rchn@genes.bio.puc.cl. 
 

Comience en hoja separada cada una de las siguientes secciones:  



   
 
 

 

212

(a) Portada, incluyendo título y título acortado del trabajo, nombre de los autores, institución y 
dirección postal en que se efectuó el trabajo, y nueva afiliación institucional si corresponde. Si 
hay varios autores, las instituciones respectivas son referidas por números correlativos indicados 
como superíndice al final de cada nombre.  

(b) Resumen.  

(c) Abstract.  

(d) Texto, incluyendo Introducción, Materiales y Métodos, Resultados, Discusión y 
Agradecimientos. Dado el caso, se puede fusionar Resultados y Discusión en una sola sección.  

(e) Literatura Citada.  

(f) Notas a pie de página.  

(g) Leyendas de Figuras (que pueden agruparse en una o más páginas).  

(h) Cada una de las Tablas, con su correspondiente leyenda. En la sección de Texto, no use 
sangría en el primer párrafo bajo cada título o subtítulo. 

(1) El Título debe ser informativo y preciso en relación al contenido del trabajo (use mayúsculas 
sólo cuando corresponda). Si es en español, deberá estar seguido de su versión en inglés y 
viceversa. Proporcione también en la portada un encabezamiento de página (título acortado) de 
no más de 50 caracteres, incluyendo espacios. 

(2) El nombre de los autores (en mayúsculas) se coloca a continuación de los títulos en español e 
inglés del trabajo. Se usa solamente el nombre y apellido paterno, evitándose título académico o 
de otra índole. Puede ser apropiado usar la inicial del segundo nombre. Por ejemplo, Juan C. 
González. Si se desea usar el apellido materno, éste deberá ir unido al paterno por un guión. 
 
(3) Todo trabajo debe contar con un Resumen en español y uno en inglés (Abstract) o viceversa, 
con precedencia del idioma en que está escrito el texto. Ambos no deben exceder 350 palabras, 
deben ser comprensibles sin referencia al texto del trabajo y deben presentar sucintamente los 
hallazgos esenciales. Al pie del Resumen y del Abstract inserte no más de cinco palabras clave. 
 
(4) La Introducción debe exponer el problema y su lugar dentro de un contexto general; no debe 
ser una revisión exhaustiva del tema, a menos que el artículo sea una Revisión. 
 
(5) La descripción de Materiales y Métodos debe ser concisa, pero con el detalle suficiente para 
permitir una comprensión cabal de su contenido, además de permitir una comprensión fácil al 
lector. 

(6) Los Resultados se presentan en Tablas, Figuras, o prosa en el texto, dependiendo de qué 
formato sea el más claro. Las Tablas y Figuras llevan sus leyendas en inglés y español, o 



   
 
 

 

213

viceversa, con precedencia del idioma en que se encuentra el texto. Indique, mediante notas 
marginales en el texto, la localización preferida de las Tablas y Figuras.  

(7) La Discusión debe ser concisa y referirse a la interpretación de los resultados presentados y a 
su relación con tópicos similares documentados en la Literatura.  
 
(8) Las citas se indican en el texto por el apellido del autor(es), seguido del año de publicación. Si 
son dos los autores se separan por el signo &amp;amp;. Si son más de dos autores, se utiliza el apellido del 
primero seguido de et al. Las citas múltiples en el texto van en orden cronológico.  

Ejemplos de citas en el texto: 

... como lo confirman varios autores (Valdebenito 1991, Pérez 1992a, 1992b, González 1993)... 

... como lo documentan Valdebenito (1987), Pérez (1989a, 1989b) y González (1993)... 

... como se especifica en una investigación reciente (González &amp;amp; Pérez 1993)... 

... de acuerdo a González &amp;amp; Pérez (1994)... 

... discrepando de este modo con Aliaga et al. (1992a, 1992b)... 

En la sección Literatura Citada incluya los trabajos citados en el texto en orden alfabético de 
acuerdo al apellido del primer autor, y luego cronológicamente. Para las referencias con tres o 
más autores, "et al.", inclúyalas después de aquellas con dos autores, y en forma cronológica (y 
no alfabética) tal como se aprecia en el siguiente ejemplo: 

NESPOLO &amp;amp; ROSENMANN (2002) 
NESPOLO, SABAT &amp;amp; ROSENMANN (1994) 
NESPOLO, NOVOA &amp;amp; ROSENMANN (1996) 
NESPOLO R, L BACIGALUPE, FF NOVOA &amp;amp; M ROSENMANN (2000) 

Iniciales y apellido de los autores van en mayúscula. Separe el último de los autores por medio 
del signo &amp;amp;. Note la ausencia de puntos entre iniciales, año de publicación y título de la 
referencia. Siempre use el nombre completo de cualquier revista que cite. En el caso de revistas 
no indexadas, agregue el país de origen de la publicación entre paréntesis y antes del volumen.  

Ejemplos de citas de artículos: 

MINOKO A &amp;amp; BC KIMURA (1994) A comment on the aggregration of worm holes around 
Casiopea. Japanese Journal of Astronomy 55: 319-324.

Licenciatura, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Doñihue, Rancagua, Chile. xxi+108 pp. 

Las mayúsculas de nombres y apellidos deben llevar acentos cuando corresponda. No incluya en 
Literatura Citada los resúmenes de trabajos presentados en congresos, reuniones o simposios. 
Cítelos en el texto a pie de página (todas las citas a pie de página, referenciadas en el texto, deben 
llevar una numeración correlativa a lo largo del manuscrito). Tampoco incluya en esta sección los 
trabajos enviados a publicación. Si es necesario, cítelos en el texto, con el nombre de los autores 
seguido entre paréntesis por "resultados no publicados". Las comunicaciones personales se citan 
sólo en el texto, señalando el autor(es), seguido entre paréntesis por "comunicación personal". 
Deben incluirse los nombres latinos binominales (puestos en cursiva) de todos los animales y 
plantas que se mencionen. La primera vez que un nombre científico es citado en el texto, debe 
llevar el nombre de su descriptor.  



   
 
 

 

215

Ejemplo: ...Sebastodes prognathus (Tortonese, 1942). El trabajo original de descripción, sin 
embargo, no deberá ser incluido en la Literatura Citada.  

Para los efectos de la nomenclatura deben seguirse las reglas establecidas en el International 
Code of Zoological Nomenclature, el International Code of Botanical Nomenclature o el 
International Code of Nomen clature of Bacteria. Si decide no citar el descriptor de cada uno de 
los organismos nombrados en su artículo, debe citar en la sección Materiales y Métodos la fuente 
bibliográfica que se sigue en el uso de nomenclatura. Por ejemplo: "La nomenclatura sigue a 
Donoso-Barros (1966) para reptiles y a... para hierbas". Referencias generales de este estilo sí 
deben ir incluidas en la sección Literatura Citada. Si el título del trabajo incluye nombres 
científicos, éstos deben ir acompañados de los taxa superiores correspondientes. Ejemplo: 
Lessonia nigrescens Bory (Phaeophyta: Laminariales). 

(9) Las locuciones latinas y griegas (por ejemplo: et al., a posteriori, e.g., i.e., sensu) no deben ir 
subrayadas ni en cursiva. Sólo use cursiva para los nombres científicos. 
(10) Las Tablas se enumeran en arábigo y en forma correlativa, y se presentan con su leyenda en 
español e inglés (con precedencia del idioma del texto) en la parte superior. Cada tabla debe ir en 
páginas separadas, y confeccionadas con la herramienta apropiada por Word para tal efecto. Use 
líneas de separación horizontales para marcar el comienzo y el final de cada Tabla; para separar 
los encabezados principales, pero no en el cuerpo de la Tabla. Nunca utilice líneas de separación 
verticales. Las líneas de división deben ser negras sin efectos especiales (e.g., sin subrayar o con 
relieve). El texto utilizado para los números, para indicar categorías, variables, u otros elementos 
debe ser idéntico al utilizado en el resto del manuscrito ("Times New Roman"de doce puntos). 
Las unidades de variables o categorías deben ir entre paréntesis, y abreviadas de acuerdo al 
Sistema Internacional de Unidades. 

(11) Tanto los gráficos, diagramas y fotografías llevan la denominación única de Figura, que se 
abrevia como Fig. en el texto, y deben estar numeradas correlativamente en arábigo. En el caso 
de los gráficos, las líneas correspondientes a los ejes deben ser continuas. Las marcas en ambos 
ejes deben estar orientadas hacia dentro de la figura. El texto utilizado para los números, nombre 
de los ejes (variables) y sus unidades, leyendas, o cualquier otro elemento escrito debe ser 
idéntico al utilizado en el resto del manuscrito ("Times New Roman"). Para el nombre de los ejes 
y sus números se sugiere utilizar texto de 16 y 14 puntos como mínimo, respectivamente. El 
nombre de cada eje o leyenda debe incluir el uso de mayúsculas (solo la primera letra de la 
primera palabra) y minúsculas. Las unidades en cada eje deben ir a la derecha del nombre de la 
variable, entre paréntesis y abreviadas de acuerdo al Sistema Internacional de Unidades. La 
identificación del estadígrafo de dispersión utilizado puede estar incluida en el texto (i.e., en 
Materiales y Métodos) y/o en el encabezado de cada Figura, pero no en la Figura (e.g., en los 
ejes). En el caso de gráficos de barra simples o múltiples, se prefiere el uso de tonos negros, 
blancos, o achurado diagonal en negro y blanco para el relleno de las barras; no utilice tonos 
grises. En el caso de gráficos XY de puntos con líneas, se prefiere el uso de símbolos geométricos 
en blanco y negro, y de líneas negras continuas o segmentadas. Evite el uso de tonos grises. 

(12) Uso de números, unidades, y convenciones estadísticas. Los números entre 10 o mayores 
que 10 deben ir como números excepto al inicio de una oración. Los números entre uno y nueve 
deben escribirse como texto a menos que sean seguidos por unidades. Los números 



   
 
 

 

216

correspondientes a años deben ir completos y no abreviados (e.g., 1992- 1998). El uso de 
unidades y sus abreviaciones en todo el texto debe estar de acuerdo al Sistema Internacional de 
Unidades. Las medias y sus estimadores de dispersión (e.g., desviación estándar, error estándar), 
tamaños de muestra, y unidades asociadas deben ir como:  
_ 
X ± DE unidad, n (e.g., 21,7 ± 4,2 g, n = 
16) 
 
La descripción de los resultados de cada prueba estadística en el texto debe incluir el nombre de 
la prueba, el estadístico y su valor, los grados de libertad (o el tamaño de muestra de acuerdo a la 
convención en cada prueba), y el valor de probabilidad asociado P. Para resultados significativos 
utilizar valores exactos de P a menos que P sea menor que 0,0001. Para resultados no 
significativos siempre se debe proporcionar el valor exacto de P.  
 
Por ejemplo: (a) prueba t de Student, t12 = 3,05; P = 0,005; (b) prueba de Kruskal-Wallis, H11 = 
287,8; P &amp;lt;0,0001; (c) correlación por rangos de Spearman, rs = 0,80, n = 13; P = 0,015; Análisis 
de varianza, F1,17 = 0,97; P = 0,485. Indicar claramente cuando las pruebas sean de una cola 
(unilaterales) en lugar de dos colas (bilaterales). Las cifras decimales siempre deben escribirse 
con un cero a la izquierda de la coma decimal (e.g., 0,82 y no ,82). 

Los manuscritos deben enviarse electrónicamente a:
