Abstract: Aim: The aim of this study was to describe the nycthemeral cycle and seasonal patterns of 
the abiotic variables of a subtropical shallow lake. Methods: The study was conducted in Biguás Lake, 
located in the university campus of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande – FURG in the city of 
Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul State – Brazil. The samples were performed monthly, from June/04 to 
May/05, each sample were obtained in 6 hours intervals, during 2 days. Results: The whole water column 
temperature varied in warming and cooling cycles throughout the day, and performed a seasonal pattern.  
The dissolved oxygen concentrations increased gradually during the day and decreased at night. Values 
of pH, alkalinity, and electrical conductivity showed small variations between the hours scheduled for 
samplings and between surface and bottom. Conclusions: The analyzed variables occur in a uniform way 
in the water column due to the constant circulation of the whole water mass, facilitated by the slow depth 
and the constant action of wind.

Keywords: shallow lake, daily cycles, annual cycles, limnological variables, eutrophication.

Resumo: Objetivo: O objetivo deste trabalho foi descrever o padrão nictemeral e sazonal das variáveis 
abióticas de um lago raso subtropical. Métodos: O estudo foi realizado no Lago dos Biguás localizado no 
campus da Universidade Federal do Rio Grande – FURG na cidade do Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul – 
Brasil. As coletas foram realizadas mensalmente, entre junho de 2004 e maio de 2005, durante dois dias 
consecutivos, em intervalos de 6 horas. Resultados: Ao longo do estudo verificou-se um padrão sazonal 
de variação de temperatura, entretanto, observaram-se processos diários de aquecimento e resfriamento de 
toda a coluna d’água ao longo do ano. As concentrações de oxigênio dissolvido aumentaram gradativamente 
ao longo do dia, diminuindo à noite. Valores de pH, alcalinidade e condutividade elétrica mostraram 
pequenas variações entre os horários de coleta e entre a superfície e o fundo. Conclusões: As variáveis 
analisadas ocorrem de maneira uniforme na coluna d’água, devido a constante circulação de toda a massa 
d’água, facilitada pela pequena profundidade e pela ação constante do vento. 

Palavras-chave: lagos rasos, ciclos diários, ciclos anuais, variáveis limnológicas, eutrofização.

1. Introduction

The major part of natural and artificial lakes is small and 
shallow (Wetzel, 1993), however, the knowledge of lentic 
waters by several years was dominated by researches in the 
great lakes of Earth. These studies revealed that some aspects 
such as geographical position and morphometry play an 
important role in the lakes dinamics. According to Esteves 
et al. (1988) the proposed models for temperate environ-
ments must not be applied directly to tropical lakes. The 
authors point out that in temperate regions the seasonal 
pattern, which cycle is practically annual and the presence of 
well-defined seasons creates persistent distinctive situations. 
On the other hand, the tropical aquatic environment seems 

to respond also to chemical, physical and biological short-
time environmental alterations (nycthemeral variation).

Lagoons and coastal lakes may also present different 
functional patterns. At these environments the wind direc-
tion usually changes twice a day. In those places without 
natural obstacles and with large water surface in relation to 
the depth, it is usual to observe  physical, chemical, and also 
biological homogenization in the water column throughout 
the year (Petrucio, 1998).

Located at the coastal plains of the Rio Grande do Sul 
State (32° 01’ 40” S and 52° 05’ 40” W), the city of 
Rio Grande comprises a stripe of lowlands in the Atlantic

Coast Restinga (coastal forests which form on sandy, acidic, 
and nutrient-poor soils) of Rio Grande, SW of the mouth 
of the Patos Lagoon (Vieira and Rangel, 1988). The re-
gion has a Humid Subtropical Climate (Cfa at Köppen’s 
Classification) characterized by intense humidity in winter 
and spring and dry during summer. Northeast winds are 
frequent most part of the year, however, in the months of 
autumn and winter, South winds and, especially, southwest 
winds, become significantly important (Krusche et al., 
2002). 

The low altimetric quotas of the city of Rio Grande do 
not allow the formation of large rivers, as a result, small 
rivers (known as arroios) are the main components of its 
internal hydrographic network (Vieira and Rangel, 1983). 
The proximity of the water table to the soil surface makes 
favorable the occurrence of temporary lagoons when the 
pluviometric precipitation is heavier. The water is also pres-
ent in abundance in wetlands (banhados) and small lagoons 
(Krusche et al., 2002).

Preliminary studies in small and shallow environments 
in the city of Rio Grande makes clear the development of 
distinct biological communities (Albertoni et al., 2005; 
Trindade et al., 2008a; Trindade et al., 2008b). However, 
little is known about the functional dynamics of these sys-
tems, since the limnological researches carried out in the 

Rio Grande’s Restinga have been performed predominantly 
in the great coastal lagoons, as instance (Schäfer et al., 
1980; Schäfer, 1988; Proença et al., 1988; Niencheski 
et al., 1988).

 Facing the lack of information about shallow environ-
ments in southern Brazil, the present study aims to describe 
annual and daily cycles of limnological variables in a shallow 
eutrophic waterbody.

2. Material and Methods 

2.1. Study area

The Biguás Lake is located in the university campus 
of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande – FURG 
(32° 04’ 43“ S and 52° 10’ 03” W), in the city of 
Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul State – Brazil (Figure 1). 
The FURG’s campus Carreiros has an area of approxi-
mately 250 ha and is found in the way to downtown Rio 
Grande. In addition, is located near to the Environmental 
Protected Area of Verde Lagoon, the Atlantic Ocean and 
Taim Ecological Station (Votto et al., 2006).

The university campus possesses a group of small wa-
terbodies that were the main water source for the city of 
Rio Grande until the 70’s. Anthropic activities which exist 
since the beginning of the campus’s construction in 1978

have promoted several alterations in the line of margins, 
depth, coastal vegetation, etc. Therefore, these small lagoons 
are a mix of original environments modified and environ-
ments completely built by human activities.

The Biguás Lake may be considered as an environment 
that has been modified during the last 35 years. It has a 
surface area of approximately 1.5 ha and depth that varies 
accordingly to the pluviosity, but not trespassing 2 m depth. 
In its margins it is observed the presence of fixed floating 
aquatic macrophytes, with predominance of Nymphoides 
indica (L.) Kuntze, and the amphibians and/or emergents 
Polygonum hydropiperoides Michx. Its surroundings are con-
stituted basically by grass and some shrubs, with occurrences 
of Erytrina crista-galli L. and Salix humboldtiana Willd. In 
the center of the lake  there are two  artificial islets used as 
shelter and resting place for cormorants, herons, teals and 
domestic geese. Due to the occurrence of birds in the lake 
there is an excessive input of organic matter, which is the 
main source of nutrient enrichment, accelerating the eutro-
phication process. As a result, frequent microalgae blooms 
occur and, in the summer months (drought season), it was 
observed cyanobacterial blooms followed by great mortality 
of fish (personal observation).

2.2. Sampling procedures

Samplings were carried out monthly during the period 
of June/04 and May/05, collected in a small boat in the 
center of the lake. Sampling frequency for determination 
of nycthemeral variation of temperature, dissolved oxygen, 
pH, electrical conductivity and alkalinity was performed 
in intervals of 6 hours, during two consecutive days, at 
6:00 AM, 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM. Depth and water trans-
parency were measured with a 20 cm diameter Secchi disk 
(always at 12:00 PM). Temperature and dissolved oxygen 
concentration (DO) were measured at each 10 cm depth 
onward to the bottom of the lake using a digital oximeter 
(Oakton®, USA). Samples from surface, medium and bot-

tom of water column were collected using a pressure pump 
attached to a hose and conditioned in plastic bottles and 
immediately transported to the laboratory for the measure-
ment of pH and electrical conductivity (pHmeter Hanna®, 
UK). The alkalinity was estimated by the Gran method 
(potentiometric titration using 0,01N H2SO4) according 
to Carmouze (1994).

The temporal variations of chlorophyll-a, suspended 
material, and total nitrogen and phosphorus concentra-
tions were obtained monthly from water surface samples. 
Chlorophyll-a concentration was determined from the 
retained material of replicas from 250 mL water samples, 
filtered through a fiber glass filter (GF/C Whatman®, USA). 
The pigment extraction was carried out in 90% ethanol 
during 24 hours (kept refrigerated at dark), and the estima-
tive of the chlorophyll-a concentration was achieved with 
a fluorometer Turner TD-700 (Turner BioSystems®, USA), 
according to Welschmeyer (1994).

The suspended material concentration was measured by 
the filtration of 250 mL water (GF/C Whatman®, USA). 
The filters were kept in a 60 °C oven for 48 hours and sub-
sequently weighted, performed according to the gravimetric 
method described by Paranhos (1996). The determination 
of total-N and total-P was carried out in separated aliquots 
of 500 mL water samples. The samples were conditioned in 
polyethylene bottles and kept frozen (–20 °C) for posterior 
analysis in the Agency for the Development of the Mirim 
Lagoon, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul State, according to 
Tedesco et al. (1995). The air temperature, pluviometric 
precipitation, wind velocity and direction were obtained 
from the Meteorological Station – FURG.

The analysis of the thermal structure of Biguás Lake 
allowed  the observation of a seasonal variation of wa-
ter temperature, that reaches lower values in the winter 
(14.9 and 16.3 °C) and higher levels in the summer 
(23.4 and 30.6 °C), according to the changes in the atmo-
spheric temperatures (Figure 2). However, by means of the 
nycthemeral analysis in the four climatic seasons, it is also 
possible to note that the lake presents similar processes of 
warming and cooling of the whole water column during 
the daily cycles (Figure 3). The lower values of temperature 
were observed in the first hours of the day (6:00 AM) and 
increasing gradually until 12:00 PM. In the afternoon, 
between 12:00 and 6:00 PM, it was observed the cool-
ing of surface waters and at night, between 6:00 PM and 
6:00 AM of the next day, it was verified a decrease in the 
water temperature in the whole water column.

Lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen (3.05 mg.L–1) 
were found in October (spring), however, during the whole 
period studied it was not verified oxygen deficits in the 
water column (Figure 2). The analysis of the nycthemeral 
variation of dissolved oxygen showed a gradual increase in 
its concentration along the day, reaching maximum values 
at 6:00 PM, and decreasing during the night, verified at 
6:00 AM in the next morning (Figure 4).  Regarding the 
oscillations observed during the day, the lake presented a 
high degree of dissolved oxygen saturation in the water 
column in the three scheduled hours of samplings. The 
lowest percentages of oxygen saturation were found in 
October, in the deepest region (in the three scheduled time 
of sampling). During the months of January and February, 
at the end of the nocturnal period, it was not observed an 

oxygen deficit in the lake. This fact indicates that despite 
the influences of temperature in the solubility of the oxygen, 
the production carried out in the superficial layers supplies 
the bottom layers by the water circulation, preventing the 
occurrence of anoxic situations.

In this study it was found values of pH between 
6.78 and 10.3 (Figure 2), with lower values during peri-
ods of higher rainfall. Higher pH values were observed on 
the surface mainly on the summer season (Table 3). The 
alkalinity observed ranging between 2.37 µEq.L–1 and 
0.32 µEq.L–1 (Figure 2). The nycthemeral variation patterns 
are different for each sampling month, with the higher 
amplitudes observed in April and during the winter months 
(Table 4), but with small variations between surface and 
bottom. The electrical conductivity has remained higher 
than 150 µS. cm–1 (Figure 2 and Table 5). In addition to the 
fluctuations between the scheduled times of samplings, no 
differences were observed between surface and bottom.

The values of the water transparency remained always 
below 0.1 m, particularly when the suspended material

has increased its concentration, as observed in August 
and January 0.42 and 0.45 mg.L–1, respectively (Table 2). 
The concentration of total nitrogen measured during 
the study ranged between 2.8 mgN.L–1 (October) and 
7.0 mgN.L–1 (January), while the total phosphorus values 
varied between 0.17 mgP.L–1 (October) and 0.38 mgP.L–1 
(April). The average concentration of chlorophyll-a ranged 
between 21.33 µg.L–1 (May) and 453.08 µg.L–1 (January), 
respectively (Table 2).

4. Discussion

The Biguás Lake is a shallow environment with a 
relatively large surface area in relation to its depth. This 
characteristic facilitates the water circulation promoted by 
the wind action, making the water column physical and 
chemical homogenized, which was observed in this study 
during the daily cycles in all seasons. According to Esteves 
(1998) lakes with permanent circulation of the entire water 
column (nonstratified) are denominated as holomitic-
polimitic lakes. In these conditions the water density is 
practically the same in all depths, without physical and/or 
chemical barriers that would restrict the vertical distribution 
of the biological communities.

In spite of the variation of temperatures between the 
scheduled hours of samplings, the water column remained 
homogeneous during the daily cycles in the four climatic 
seasons. According to Petrucio (1998) the homeothermy of 
the water column, explained mainly by the frequent water 
mass circulation, is a consequence of the small depth and 
continuous exposition to the action of the wind. This pat-
tern is similar to the one found by Esteves et al. (1988) in 
the Lagoa Imboassica, Rio de Janeiro State, attributed to 
the lake localization which is perpendicular to the coastline, 
exposed to the action of the marine and terrestrial breezes. 
In the city of Rio Grande there are no natural or artificial 
barriers that can obstruct the action of wind on the surface 
of aquatic environments. Notwithstanding, even located 
approximately 16 km from the coastline, the Biguás Lake 
is constantly under the action of the wind. 

Among the gases dissolved in natural waters, the oxygen 
is one of the most important for the dynamics and char-
acterization of the aquatic ecosystems (Wetzel and Likens, 
1991). The main oxygen sources for the aquatic environ-
ments are the atmosphere and photosynthesis, and the 
mineralization (decomposition of the organic matter and 
the respiration of the organisms) is the main responsible 
for the losses of this gas (Petrucio, 1998). In our study, the 
wind may have been responsible both for the input of dis-
solved oxygen due to the gas exchange between atmosphere 
and the aquatic environment, as well as for its distribution 
in the whole water column by means of the circulation of 
water mass, facilitated by the shallowness of the lake. 

The daily variation recorded in our study is similar varia-
tions found by Ramirez and Bicudo (2003) in the Garças 

reservoir, São Paulo State. The increase of the dissolved 
oxygen concentration during the day and its reduction 
during the night were also related to the metabolism of the 
lake, with the dominance of diurnal processes of produc-
tion and nocturnal mineralization. According to Schäfer 
et al. (1980) the degree of involvement of these processes 
in the water affects the daily variation of oxygen, so that the 
production depends on the light available, and each level 
of production correspond to two levels of consumption, 
respiration and decomposition. It was most evident during 
two occasions: in spring, coinciding with the increase in 
precipitation and elevation of suspended material, which 
may have facilitated the process of decomposition of or-
ganic matter in the sediment and, consequently, the oxygen 
consumption; and during summer, characterized by small 
pluviometric precipitation, high temperatures and intense 
luminosity, factors that contribute to the photosynthetic 
activity of the phytoplanktonic community, increasing lake 
production during the day, as well as the consumption at 
night by the mineralization processes.

The water circulation re-suspends the precipitated mate-
rial and seems to beneficiate the processes of the oxidation 
of organic matter in the deep regions and, consequently, 
to decrease the dissolved oxygen concentration. These re-
sults coincide with low values of pH found at the bottom, 
suggesting the occurrence of decomposition processes and 
inorganic CO2 release (Sipaúba-Tavares, 1996). Mercante 
and Bicudo (1996) have observed lower values of pH during 
the rainy seasons in Jacaré Pond, São Paulo State.

Higher pH values observed on the surface, mainly on 
the summer season, were associated to photosynthesis of 
phytoplanktonic algae. The small pH variations indicate 
high buffering capacity for the lake, which may be sup-
ported by the elevated alkalinity observed. Environments 
with elevated alkalinity present small variations of pH, even 
with the occurrence of high photosynthetic rates, when the 
consumption of CO2 is immediately compensated by the 
HCO3

– dissociation (Esteves, 1998). 
The variation of the electrical conductivity was depen-

dent on both the variation of the water level as well as the 
seasonal metabolic activity, and consistent patterns were 
observed in the nycthemeral variation. During the summer, 
with the lowest volume of water, the absolute values of 
conductivity reached its maximum, probably by the natural 
increase of the ionic concentration in a smaller volume of 
water. In January, the lake has developed a growth of algae 
(bloom), which may have limited these figures, since later 
in February, with the decrease in chlorophyll-a values and 
consequent decrease in phytoplankton biomass, there was 
an increase in the values of conductivity.

The values of water transparency remained when it was 
detected increases in the suspended material concentra-
tion. The low transparency values observed on the lake is 
probably related to its shallowness, which together with

tion and mineralization of the organic matter, triggering 
series of alterations in the chemical characteristics of water. 
This study has demonstrated, in a general way, the dynamics 
of functionality of a shallow lake located in the south of 
the coastal plains of the Rio Grande do Sul State (Brazil). 
The information presented herein will serve as subside for 
future researches in these environments, contributing to the 
preservation and/or conservation of these ecosystems.

the action of wind facilitates the movement of the water 
column and, consequently, the re-suspension of the mate-
rial deposited in the sediment, besides the phytoplankton 
biomass. According to alternative stable states theory of 
shallow lakes from Scheffer et al. (1993), the lakes can be 
in two alternative stable states: clear with abundant sub-
merged macrophytes or turbid with few submerged plants 
characterized by high algal biomass. The authors emphasize 
that in the turbid state, fish promote phytoplankton growth 
by recycling nutrients and controlling the development of 
zooplankton that could otherwise help clear the water of 
phytoplankton. Also fish and waves may stir up sediments 
in shallow lakes with little or no vegetation. In this situ-
ation, light limitation and disturbance of the sediments 
make it difficult for submerged plants to settle. On the 
other hand, once submerged plants are abundant, they can 
greatly reduce turbidity by a suit of mechanisms resulting 
in control of excessive phytoplankton development and 
prevention of wave re-suspension of sediments (Scheffer 
and Van Nes, 2007).

The re-suspension of sediments also collaborates for 
the increase of the nutrient concentrations in water col-
umn (Panosso and Kubrusly, 1998). During the study the 
elevated values of suspended material coincided with the 
higher values of total-N and total-P. In some concentrations 
nitrogen and phosphorus may cause exaggerated growth of 
aquatic macrophytes or the blooming of microalgae, mainly 
cyanobacteria (Ringelberg and Baard, 1988; Gophen, 
2001). In this study both nutrients were found at higher 
concentrations in spring, period of the highest incidence 
of birds in the lake. This input of nutrients favored the 
growth of microalgae, fact noted by the variation in 
chlorophyll-a concentration in summer, which showed a 
considerable increase. The concentrations of chlorophyll-a 
above 10 µg.L–1 are typical of eutrophic environments 
(Lampert and Sommer, 1997), which confirms the lake 
classification. During this period were also observed the 
highest values of conductivity, suspended matter, pH and 
alkalinity, with small variation between the scheduled hours 
of samplings.

The results obtained in the Biguás Lake have demon-
strated that besides the seasonal alterations suffered, daily 
changes in its metabolism are also relevant for the under-
standing of its dynamics. Regional climatic variations such 
as: air temperature, wind speed, precipitation and sunlight 
are responsible for thermal and chemical changes in this 
lake. These processes occur uniformly in the water column 
due to the constant circulation of the whole water mass, 
facilitated by the low depth and action of the wind, which 
prevents the formation of physical and chemical stratifica-
tions. The constant input of organic matter from birds must 
be better understood, because this seems to be the main 
factor responsible by the enrichment of the lake, increasing 
its productivity and, consequently, the processes of respira-
