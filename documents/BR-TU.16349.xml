ABSTRACT

This study evaluated PCR for the detection of leptospires in semen and urine of ten serologically reactive bulls,
comparing these results with those obtained with other diagnosis techniques. Two collections of materials were
done in alternate days. Semen and urine samples were separated in aliquots for: direct visualization in dark field
microscopy; inoculation in hamsters (for semen only); isolation in culture media; and PCR. No hamster was
positive by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT); kidney and liver fragments from the hamsters were used
in an isolation attempt in culture media, with one positive isolation from the kidney of a hamster inoculated with
semen of one bull, and from liver of hamsters inoculated with semen of three bulls. Isolation in culture was
negative for all semen samples, but positive for five urine samples by direct inoculation. In PCR there was no
positive result for semen samples, and only one urine sample was positive, which was coincident with one of the
positive cultures. It was not possible to visualize leptospires in any of the samples by dark field microscopy.

Key words: Leptospira, semen, urine, PCR

INTRODUCTION

Among many diseases linked to reproduction, leptospirosis
is one of the most important for the low productivity of cattle
farming. Transmission of Leptospira spp. in cattle can happen
in an indirect way through contact with contaminated water or
soil, and directly through sexual contact. Once infected, the
animal excretes the agent by the urine over a period of time
which can be longer than one year and presents an intermittent
character (14,21).

The presence of Leptospira spp. in semen of infected bulls
was demonstrated naturally and experimentally, indicating the
possibility of bovine leptospirosis transmission by natural
coition or by artificial insemination (15,20).

Around the world the criterion for leptospirosis diagnosis
is a negative result by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT).

However, such condition is not an absolute assurance of
absence of kidney infection. Hanson (8) reports an isolation of
Leptospira spp. from urine or kidney tissue of serologically
unreactive animals. Serology does not necessarily reflects the
state of Leptospira carrier in bovines (23). Although MAT is a
sensitive test, determining the serogroup involved, some
disadvantages can be observed. The most important is the fact
that it is an indirect test, which does not detect the presence of
leptospires, but the immunological reaction of the infected host.
Thus, the test does not indicate if the infection is active.

A definitive diagnosis of Leptospira spp. infection is usually
given by cultivation and isolation of the agent; however, this
procedure is expensive, demanding freshly collected samples,
and at least 30 days are required to obtain conclusive results
(1). Thiermann (21) reported that Leptospira spp. isolation,
beyond the difficult execution, is dependent on factors like type

and uniformity of medium used, and the experience of the
technician.

Due to the need of developing methods that offer greater
sensitivity, specificity and speed, molecular biology techniques
have been applied to detect leptospires.

Recently, the PCR technique became an important tool to
detect infectious agents. It is a quick and extremely sensitive
method that theoretically can detect a single DNA molecule in a
few hours. Another great advantage of PCR is the fact that there
is no need of viability of the pathogen for the use of the test,
which allows inactivation and storage of samples, as well as
application of the technique in poorly preserved samples (13).

PCR has been used successfully in several studies related
to leptospirosis, either for detection of the agent in several
materials, such as semen (9,18), urine (3,12,23) and aqueous
humor (4), or to monitor leptospires density in blood and organs
of experimentally infected hamsters treated with different doses
of antibiotics (22).

The present study had as objective to evaluate the PCR
technique for the diagnosis of bovine leptospirosis by detection
of Leptospira in urine and semen of bulls serologically reactive
to the serovar hardjo, comparing it with the results obtained by
MAT and culture and isolation of the microorganism.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Examined animals
The study was carried out with 10 semen donor bulls (Bos

taurus) from an artificial insemination center located in the State
of São Paulo. Animals serologically reactive to Leptospira
interrogans serovar hardjo in two examinations one week apart,
according to the routine of the insemination center, from March
2001 to July 2002, were selected; the lowest antibody titer for
selection of an animal was 200. This titer was adopted to increase
the possibility of finding leptospires in the materials studied.

Sample collection
Blood collection was performed by vein puncture, and the

serum removed from the collected blood after clot retraction.
Then the serum was identified and tested by the microscopic
agglutination test (MAT).

Two semen samples from bulls reacting by the MAT were
obtained, with a 3-day maximum interval, by the artificial vagina
method.

Urine samples were collected from serologically reacting
bulls by the technique of preputial massage immediately after
semen collection.

Microscopic agglutination test
The sera were diluted in Sörensen buffered solution, with

an initial dilution of 1/50. From this dilution 50 ?L aliquots were
placed in test tubes, and an equal amount of antigen added,

resulting in a 1/100 dilution. The mixture serum-antigen was
gently mixed and incubated in a bacteriological incubator at
28ºC for two hours, and then read in a dark field microscope,
with a 40x objective and a 15x eye piece. The criterion adopted
to consider a serum reactive was 50% agglutination, that is, at
least one half of the leptospires agglutinated in the microscope
field at the amplification of 100 times (17). The reactive sera in
the initial screening were reexamined with seven serial dilutions
at the proportion of two, and only the animals with sera
presenting a minimum titer of 200 were used. The serum titer
was considered as the reciprocal of the greatest dilution that
presented at least 50% agglutination.

Detection of the agent
The detection of leptospires in semen and urine was

performed by: a) direct examination of semen suspensions, in
an optical microscope with a 10x eye piece, and a 40x objective,
and immersion dark field condenser (17); b) cultivation of
leptospires in culture media with the serial dilution procedure
(5); and c) extraction and detection of leptospire genetic material
by the PCR technique. Isolation of leptospires was also
performed by inoculation of 0.5 mL of semen, intraperitonealy,
in male hamsters (Mesocricetos auratus) with 80 to 120 mg live
weight, and attempts of recovering the microorganisms from
the kidneys and liver.

For the agent cultivation, semen and urine samples were
processed as fast as possible (less than two hours time frame),
and they were frozen at -20ºC until required for PCR examination.

Detection of antibodies and attempt to isolate leptospires in
hamsters

Twenty one days after semen inoculation as described above,
all hamsters, inoculated and controls (with application of sterile
Sörensen solution), were individually anaesthetized in a chamber
with ethyl ether vapors. Blood samples were collected by cardiac
puncture, to detect antibodies against the serovar hardjo by
the MAT; subsequently, a rigorous asepsis of the abdominal
region was followed by a median laparotomy for removal of
kidneys and liver of each hamster. Approximately 1g of each
aseptically collected organ was individually macerated in a sterile
mortar and pestle, and suspended in 9 mL of sterile Sörensen
solution.

Isolation in culture media
Starting from five serial dilutions at the proportion of 10,

with sterile Sörensen buffered solution, from a 0.5 mL aliquot of
each studied sample (urine, semen, and hamster organ
suspensions), cultivation of leptospires was done by seeding
each dilution in Fletcher’s (Difco) semisolid medium, amended
with 5-fluorouracil (Hoffman – Roche), in the proportion of
200 µg/mL (5). After seeding, the tubes were incubated at 28ºC
for 12 weeks, observing the occurrence of an opalescence ring

and weekly dark field microscopy studies were performed with
a 40x objective and a 15x eye piece.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
DNA extraction was done by enzymatic lysis with proteinase

K followed by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol from 300 ?L
of each sample (semen and urine); the DNA extraction steps
were done basically as describe by Sambrook et al. (16).

The primer used was that proposed by Merien et al. (11),
corresponding to nucleotides 38 to 57 (5’GGCGGCGC
GTCTTAAACATG 3’) and 348 to 369 (5’TTCCCCCATTGA
GCAAGATT 3’) of the 16 S rRNA gene primary structure of
the Leptospira interrogans serovar canicola.

DNA sample amplification was done in 500 ?L microtubes,
with a 50 ?L final volume. The reaction mixture consisted of
18.7 ?L ultrapure water, 5.0 ?L 10x reaction buffer (500 mM KCl;
15 mM MgCl2; 100 mM tris-HCl, pH 9.0), 8.0 ?L dNTPs mixture
(200 mM of each nucleotide [dCTP, dATP, dGTP, dTTP]), 4.0 ?L
each oligonucleotide (10 pmol/?L), 0.3 ?L Taq DNA-polymerase
(5 units per ?L) and 10 ?L extracted DNA sample, and the mixture
was placed in a thermocycler.

The amplification cycle used was the one recommended by
Merien et al. (11), added with an initial step at 94ºC for 5 minutes.

Visualization of the amplified product (330 base pairs) was
done by electrophoresis in a 2.0% (w/v) agarose gel stained
with ethidium bromide, using TBE 0.5 X (0.04 M tris-acetate and
0.001M EDTA, pH 8.0) as running buffer (16).

RESULTS

By the direct dark field microscopy it was not possible to
observe any leptospires in the 20 semen samples nor in the 18
urine ones, collected in duplicate from each one of the 10
serologically reactive bulls.

By the leptospires cultivation in culture media technique, no
microorganisms were seen in the few semen cultures that did not
get contaminated. It was possible to visualize leptospires in urine
cultures of five bulls, in at least one of the collections (Table 1).

The results from Fletcher’s semisolid medium culture of kidney
and liver samples of hamsters inoculated with fresh “in natura”
semen are presented in Table 1. They were grouped as a pool for
each group of three hamsters that were inoculated with semen of
the same bull and the same collection. It can be seen from Table
1 that Leptospira visualization was possible only from kidney
cultures of hamsters that were inoculated with semen from bull 2
in both collections; however, it was possible cultivated
leptospires in liver cultures of hamsters inoculated with semen
from three bulls, in at least one collection. All tested hamsters
were negative at the MAT. Negative results were obtained from
cultures of liver and kidney of hamsters, as well as for MAT.

All positive cultures (urine of bulls, liver and kidney of
hamsters) were confirmed by PCR.

It was not possible to detect bacterial DNA by PCR technique
from the semen samples. Table 1 shows the PCR results from
urine samples of Leptospira reactive bulls. It can be seen in the
Table that the sample from second collection of bull 4 was the
only one positive.

DISCUSSION

Undoubtedly, leptospirosis is one of the major diseases of
the reproductive tract in cattle in Brazil and around the world,
and the participation of semen as one of the dissemination
vehicles was confirmed by several authors (15,20), thus,
requiring strict disease control in bulls which semen is used for
artificial insemination, also caring for semen quality and the
absence of leptospires in this material.

Leptospira spp. research in freshly collected semen and
urine by direct dark field microscopy did not allow the
visualization of leptospires in any of the two semen and urine
samples of each animal. Direct visualization is very difficult,
and a negative result does not mean absence of infection.

Leptospira spp. isolation from semen samples was
unsuccesessfull, with almost all cultivations being contaminated,
even dilutions of 10-5. Similar frustrating results were obtained by
Guimarães et al. (7) and Heinemann et al. (9). The failure of
Leptospira isolation from the analyzed semen samples could be
explained by the possible competition exerted by inhibitory and
contaminant microorganisms present in this material (19). However,
Brod et al. (2) evaluated semen of several sires and found that it
was possible to observe leptospires during a direct examination
after 24 hours of cultivation in a semisolid medium.

On the other hand, it was possible to detect leptospires in
urine cultures from five bulls, in at least one of the collections.
The fact that for the same bull it was possible to visualize
Leptospira spp. in one collection, but not in another, could be
explained by the intermittent character of leptospiruria (14), and
also by the fact that possible contaminants inhibiting leptospires
growth could be present in the urine. Thiermann (21) reported
that a Leptospira spp. isolating in culture medium, besides being
difficult to perform, is dependent on factors such as: type and
uniformity of culture medium, and technician’s experience.

In relation to the results of hamster inoculation with freshly
collected semen, it was observed that the passage of material in
laboratory animals could be a good alternative for isolation of
Leptospira spp. from semen, which was also observed by
Kiktenko et al. (10). Although the animals did not present any
clinical alteration and the microscopic agglutination test at a 1/
100 dilution of the sera turned negative, it was possible to
visualize leptospires from kidney cultivation of a hamster group
that received semen from one of the bulls, and from liver
cultivation of hamster groups that received semen of three bulls.

The fact that the control group animals were MAT negative,
and that it was not possible cultivate leptospires from kidney or
liver, indicate that the hamsters did not present leptospirosis
before inoculation.

Athough MAT is the most used technique for leptospirosis
diagnosis, it presents some deficiencies, such as: false-negative
results due to the low correlation between the carrier state and
the presence of serum antibodies (23), difficulty of obtaining
reproducible results between laboratories (21), and it is a time
consuming technique, requiring the use of live leptospires as
antigens (17).

Facing the deficiencies of MAT, the unspecificity, and the
inadequacy of direct visualization of leptospires by dark field
microscopy, and the difficulty of cultivating Leptospira spp.
for isolation from several materials (21), PCR became a new
diagnosis option, which is considered fast and extremely
sensitive, theoretically being able to detect a single DNA
molecule, since it passes through an amplification process.

This study has as major objective to evaluate PCR for the
detection of leptospires in semen and urine of serologically
reactive bulls. For this purpose, the initiator oligonucleotides
Lep 1 and Lep 2, synthesized by Merien et al. (11) from the

Leptospira interrogans serovar canicola sequence of gene
rRNA 16 S as determined by Fukunaga et al. (6), was selected,
due to the fact that these primers were genus specific and allow
the amplification of several serovars of non-pathogenic and
pathogenic leptospires, including among them the serovars
wolffi, hardjo, and pomona (9).

Although there are several successful reports of Leptospira
spp. detection by PCR in semen (9,18) and urine (3,11,23), in the
present study none of the semen samples were positive by
PCR. For the urine samples, it was possible to detect Leptospira
spp. DNA in only one, which was also positive for isolation.
Theoretically, PCR can detect only one fragment of DNA, but
some papers described different detection threshold, that is
variable according to the sample, DNA extraction protocols and
the primer used. Heinemann et al. (10) reported a detection
threshold of 100 leptospires / mL in semen samples of bulls,
with the same primers used in the present study.

New studies should be done in relation to the use of PCR for
the diagnosis of leptospires in materials such as semen and
urine, testing other DNA extraction methods, and other primers,
since the results from this paper showed that sometimes isolation
in culture medium or the passage through laboratory animals
can yield better results.

RESUMO

Detecção de Leptospira spp. em sêmen e urina de
touros sorologicamente reagentes a Leptospira

interrogans sorovar hardjo

O presente trabalho avaliou a PCR na detecção de leptospiras
em sêmen e urina de dez touros sorologicamente reagentes,
comparando seus resultados com aqueles obtidos por outras
técnicas de diagnóstico. Foram realizadas duas colheitas de
materiais em dias alternados. As amostras de sêmen e de urina
foram separadas em alíquotas para visualização direta em
microscopia de campo escuro, inoculação em hamsters (apenas
para o sêmen), isolamento em meio de cultura e PCR. Nenhum
hamster apresentou positividade na prova de soroaglutinação
microscópica (SAM); fragmentos de rins e fígado desses animais
foram utilizados para a tentativa de isolamento em meio de cultura,
sendo positivo o cultivo a partir do rim de hamster inoculado com
semen de um touro, e do fígado de hamsters inoculados com o
semen de três touros. O isolamento em meio de cultura foi negativo
para todas as amostras de sêmen, mas foi positivo para cinco
amostras de urina. Na PCR não houve resultado positivo para as
amostras de sêmen, e apenas uma amostra de urina apresentou
resultado positivo, sendo coincidente com uma das culturas
positivas. Não foi possível visualizar leptospiras em nenhuma
das amostras por exame direto em microscopia de campo escuro.
