ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
 

“O lord that lends me life, lend me a heart that is replete with thankfulness” 

 

William Shakespeare, Henry VI, Poet II 

 

It is a cinch that it is God that “raiseth the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the 

beggar from the dunghill”.  The greatest acknowledgement of all is to God Almighty the 

source of wisdom, strength, and knowledge for seeing me through another step in my 

academic career.  To HIM alone is all the glory for my wonderful yesterdays, the blessings 

of today, and the promises of my future. Great is THY faithfulness, morning by morning 

new mercies I see! I give thanks to the LORD for everything.    

I humbly appreciate the role of my late father, Pa John Ademolaju Adeyemo for 

launching me into this academic orbit at a tender age. He was fulfilled in me. Though he 

passed on, the legacy he left for me remains. May he continue to rest in the bosom of our 

Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. I owe an indescribable indebtedness to my mother, Madam 

Eunice Ayodele Adeyemo, who took the challenge, washed my infant head with tears and 

affection during vicissitudes and travails of my life. She actually jump-started my 

education and that of my siblings in our humble, united but polygamous family setting. 

You are indeed a great mother! Thanks to my family, the bone of my bone – Funmilayo 

Kemisola Thaddeus Adeyemo, and David Adebayo Adeyemo junior, who always put 

smiles on my face when I thought everything was falling apart. Thank you for always 

pushing me to achieve my full potential. I have been very blessed. I assure you that all the 

money spent was invested in the genuine pursuit of academic knowledge, save for a 

minimal amount set aside for general sustenance and the occasional replacement of worn 

sandals. 

I would like to extend my thanks to those who have contributed their knowledge 

and support over the past years. This doctoral thesis would not have been possible without 

the scholarship given by The World Academy of Sciences and The Brazilian National 

Council for Scientific and Technological Development (TWAS/CNPq), I also thank The

ABSTRACT 

ADEYEMO, Adebayo Jonathan, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, February 2013. 
Bioremediation of brazilian soils contaminated with used lubricating oil. Adviser: Jaime 
Wilson Vargas de Mello. Co-advisors: Ivo Ribeiro da Silva and Sergio Antonio Fernandes. 

 

Oil is the most widely distributed source of energy in the world and the largest-scaled 

environmental pollutant. Oil, oil products, and oil-containing industrial wastes pollution is 

ranked second place after radioactive pollution on account of their harmful action to 

ecosystems. Contamination of soil by organic chemicals (mostly hydrocarbons) is prevalent in 

oil producing and industrialized countries of the world. This may pose a great threat to the 

environment and human being at large. Different treatment methods have been employed to 

remediate contaminated soils. Bioremediation, a strategy that uses biological means to 

degrade, stabilize, and/or remove soil contaminants can be an alternative green technology for 

remediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated soil.   Bioremediation provides an economically 

beneficial and highly-specific clean-up technology to remove pollutants by targeting 

individual compounds or their mixtures. The planning of bioremediation strategies for 

polluted land and water areas should consider the use of the existing indigenous oil oxidizing 

microorganisms with different affinity to oil fractions and their activation by addition of 

fertilizers (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium). The inoculation of effective microorganisms 

such as amnite p1300, special bacteria strains consisting a mixture of Bacillus subtilis, 

Bacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Phanerochaete 

chrysosporium, Rhodococcus rhodocrous on a cereal (bran) among others possess significant 

pollutant degradation potential. It has been shown that these bacteria can use recalcitrant 

pollutant as energy source. The remediation of polluted soils requires the study of the 

microorganisms’ diversity in the environment and the determination of the ability of different 

microbes and their consortia to degrade pollutants in the presence of high oil pollution 

concentration. This is important because it has been observed that the introduction of a single 

oil-oxidizing strain into the oil-spilled environment does not assure a complete clean-up. This 

investigation consists of studies with the primary aim of studying the efficacy of commercial 

bacterial strains for the biodegradation of used lubricating oil in soil. The rates of 

biodegradation of the used lubricating oil were studied in the laboratory. The model soil 



xiii 

 

sample of 300 g was contaminated with 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 % (w/w) of used motor oil at room 

temperature under laboratory conditions using microcosm of 1 L. The microcosm  was used to 

simulate the comparative effect of spent oil addition and bioremediation using a commercially 

available hydrocarbon degrading microbial consortium (Amnite P1300) as the 

bioaugmentation treatment, to enhance biodegradation of hydrocarbons in soils contaminated 

with different concentrations of used lubricating oil, nutrients amendments ((NH4)2SO4 and 

K2HPO4) as biostimulation, unammended soil (natural attenuation) and the control soil treated 

with sodium azide (NaN3) on the microbial community in different soil  types. Hydrocarbon-

utilizing bacterial counts were high in the amended soils with commercial bacterial, nutrients 

amendments and the natural attenuation (soil alone) compared to control soil treated with 

sodium azide throughout the period of the study. Oil-contaminated soil amended with Amnite 

P1300 showed the highest reduction in total petroleum hydrocarbon in all the contamination 

levels compared to other treatments in all the soil types. The evaluation of soil biological 

activities as a monitoring tool for the degradation process of the model soils was made via 

measurements of hydrocarbons degrading bacterial counts (HDB), soil respiration (CO2), pH 

and percentage oil degradation. The correlations between these parameters and the levels of 

the hydrocarbon residues were determined. The residual hydrocarbon content correlated 

negatively with hydrocarbon utilizers, CO2 evolution, pH and percentage (%) oil degradation 

(P &amp;lt;0.01) in the clayey and sandy soils. Complete biodegradation of C10 to C14 and substantial 

degradation of C15 to C28 hydrocarbon fractions and PAHs were recorded in Amnite P1300 

amended soils throughout the period of study, thus suggesting the high potential of the 

product in enhancing biodegradation of hydrocarbons. The results revealed remediation 

potential of Amnite p1300 to degrade heavy hydrocarbons in used lubricating oil. It is 

concluded that contamination of soil with oil hydrocarbons has a negative effect on soil 

ecosystems, and the extent and duration of these effects will depend on the nature of the 

hydrocarbon contaminant and the soil characteristics. Thus, inhibitory effect of used 

lubricating oil is more pronounced in sandy soil than clayey soil and show more toxic effect 

on seed germination and root growth.

RESUMO 

ADEYEMO, Adebayo Jonathan, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, fevereiro de 2013. 
Biorremediação de solos brasileiros contaminado com óleo lubrificante usado. Adviser: 
Jaime Wilson Vargas de Mello. Co-advisors: Ivo Ribeiro da Silva e Sergio Antonio 
Fernandes. 

 

Petróleo é o recurso energético mais amplamente distribuído no mundo e o mais 

importante poluente ambiental. Petróleos, derivados de petróleo e os resíduos industriais que 

contêm petróleo, ocupam o segundo lugar entre os poluentes, perdendo apenas para a poluição 

radioativa no que se refere a danos causados aos ecossistemas. A contaminação dos solos por 

compostos orgânicos, principalmente hidrocarbonetos, é comum entre os países que 

produzem e industrializam petróleo, representando grande ameaça ao homem e ao meio 

ambiente em geral. Diferentes métodos de tratamento têm sido empregados para eliminar a 

contaminação dos solos. A biorremediação é uma estratégia que usa meios biológicos para 

degradar, estabilizar e/ou remover contaminantes do solo, sendo tecnologia ´´verde´´ 

alternativa na remediação de solos contaminados com hidrocarbonetos. A biorremediação 

fornece benefícios econômicos e de alta tecnologia para remover concentrações de poluentes, 

sejam eles individuais ou misturas. O planejamento de estratégias de biorremediação de 

ambiente terrestres e aquáticos contaminados tem por base a existência de microrganismos 

naturais que degradam petróleo com diferentes afinidades pelas frações, fertilizantes 

(nitrogênio, fósforo e potássio). Amnite p1300, o qual consiste de mistura de bacterianas de 

Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, 

Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Rhodococcus rhodocrous em cereais (farelo), entre outros 

possui significativo potencial de degradação de poluentes. Tem sido demonstrado que essas 

bactérias podem usar poluentes recalcitrantes como fonte de energia. A remediação de 

poluentes dos solos requer o estudo da diversidade desses microrganismos no ambiente e a 

determinação da capacidade de diferentes microorganismos e seus diferentes agrupamentos 

para degradar poluentes na presença de elevadas concentrações de poluição por petróleo. Isto 

é importante porque tem sido observado que a introdução de uma simples cerpa oxidante de 

petróleo em ambiente contaminado não assegura limpeza por completo. Este trabalho teve 

como objetivo principal investigar a eficiência de um produto comercial na biodegradação de 

óleos lubrificantes usados presentes no solo. A taxa de  biodegradação de resíduos de óleo 



 

xv 

 

lubrificante foi estudada em laboratório. Uma amostra de solo modelo de 300 g foi 

contaminado com 1,5, 3,0 e 4,5 % (w/w) de óleo de motor usado à temperatura ambiente em 

condições laboratoriais usando microcosmo de 1L. O microcosmo foi usado para simular o 

efeito comparativo da adição de óleo usado e a bioremediação usando um coquetel 

microbiano disponível comercialmente que degrada hidrocarbonetos (Amnite p1300) como o 

tratamento de crescimento microbiano, para elevar a biodegradação de hidrocarbonetos em 

solos contaminados com diferentes concentrações, adição de nutrientes (NH4)2SO4 e K2HPO4) 

como tratamento de bioestimulação, atenuação natural e o solo controle tratado com azida de 

sódio (NaN3) sobre a  comunidade microbiana em diferentes tipos de solos. A contagem de 

bactérias que utilizam hidrocarboneto foi elevada nos solos tratados com a mistura de 

bactérias comercial, com adição de nutrientes e na atenuação natural (apenas solo) comparado 

com o solo controle tratado com azida de sódio durante o período do estudo. Os solos 

contaminados com petróleo e adicionadas de Aminte P1300 mostraram elevada redução no 

total de hidrocarbonetos de petróleo em todos os níveis de contaminação quando comparado 

com outros tratamentos em todos os tipos de solos. A avaliação da atividade biológica do solo 

como instrumento para monitorar o processo de degradação dos solos modelos foi feita 

através da contagem das bactérias degradadoras de hidrocarbonetos (HDB), atividades 

biológica como (CO2),  pH e porcentagem de degradação do óleo. A correlação entre estes 

parâmetros e o nível de resíduos de hidrocarbonetos foi determinada.  O conteúdo 

hidrocarboneto resíduos correlacionou se negativamente com hidrocarbonetos utilizados, 

evolução de CO2,  pH e porcentagem de degradação de óleo (P &amp;lt;0,01). nos solos argilosos e 

arenosos. A completa biodegradação de C10-C14 e a degradação substancial de C15-C28 das 

frações de hidrocarbonetos e PAHs foi registrada com o tratamento de adição de Amnite 

P1300 nos solos alterados durante o período do estudo. Sugerindo assim elevado potencial do 

produto em aumentar a biodegradação de hidrocarbonetos. Os resultados revelaram o 

potencial de remediação de Amnite p1300 na degradação de hidrocarbonetos de cadeia longa, 

como os óleos lubrificantes usados. Concluímos que a contaminação de solos com 

hidrocarbonetos tem efeito negativo no solo, e a extensão e duração desses efeitos vai 

depender da natureza dos hidrocarbonetos contaminantes e das características do solo. 

Entretanto, o efeito inibitório dos óleos lubrificantes usado é mais pronunciado em solos 

arenosos do que em solos argilosos e tem efeito tóxico na germinação de sementes e 

crescimento de raízes.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 

1.1. Background.  

Petroleum and its refined products (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, engine oil, jet fuel, etc.) 

are major resources used for energy requirements in industrial and transportation sectors 

throughout the world. The lubricating oils represent approximately 2 % of the derivatives of 

petroleum oil and are used for automotive and industrial purposes. According to their 

applications, they receive additives (organic and / or inorganic) in their formulation in order to 

meet the requirements of the different intended applications (ANP, 1999; CEMPRE, 2007). 

Motor oil is used for lubrication requirements of various kinds of automotive and other 

engines. During these types of uses, motor oil picks up a number of additional components 

from engine wear. These include heavy metals, such as lead, chromium, cadmium, and other 

materials like naphthalene, chlorinated hydrocarbons, sulphur. After the passage of time, oil 

changes become necessary due to alteration in the viscosity of the oil. Any such oil that 

becomes unsuitable after use due to contamination, making it unfit for its original purpose, is 

known as used motor oil (U.M.O) and is required to be suitably disposed of. Thus, any 

disposal of used oil in soils, surface water and groundwater, sewer systems and waste water 

disposal or any form of elimination that causes air pollution exceeding the level set by the 

environmental protection legislation is forbidden (ABNT, 1987; CETESB, 2003; CONAMA, 

2005).  

The base oil contains C16-C36 hydrocarbons, and more than 75% c-alkanes. The rings 

number of c-alkanes in the base oil is from 1 to 3 and any ring contains 5 or 6 members. Most 

of the c-alkanes in the base oil have long alkyl side chains (Koma et al., 2003). The most 

important characteristic of the lubricating oil for automotive use is its viscosity. Fresh motor 

oil contains a higher percentage of volatile and water soluble hydrocarbons that would be a 

concern for acute toxicity to organisms (Boonchan et al., 2000). Used motor oil contains 

metals and heavy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that could contribute to chronic 

hazards including mutagenicity and carcinogenicity (Hagwell et al., 1992; Boonchan et al., 

2000). As the usage of petroleum hydrocarbon products increased, soil contamination with 

diesel and engine oils is becoming one of the major environmental problems (Mandri and Lin, 

2007). Prolonged exposure to high oil concentration may cause the development of liver or 



 

2 

 

kidney disease, possible damage to the bone marrow and an increased risk of cancer (Mishra 

et al., 2001; Propst et al., 1999, Lloyd and Cackette, 2001).  In addition, PAHs have a 

widespread occurrence in various ecosystems that contribute to the persistence of these 

compounds in the environment (Van Hamme et al., 2003). The illegal dumping of used motor 

oil is an environmental hazard with global ramifications (Blodgett, 2001). Used oils have the 

potential to be recycled and re-refined if safely and properly collected, yet in many cases it is 

poured into an open drain or thrown into the trash where it can contaminate the subsurface 

soil and ground water. In Africa and some developing countries about 20 million gallons of 

waste engine oil are generated annually from mechanic workshops and discharged carelessly 

into the environment (Faboya, 1997; Adegoroye, 1997). Out of which only one liter is enough 

to contaminate one million gallons of freshwater and create a film that prevents aeration in 

approximately one thousand square meters of a water body, causing serious damage to fauna 

and aquatic flora. (USEPA, 1996, Viveiros, 2000; Magalhães et al., 2007). Apart from this, 

used engine oil renders the environment unsightly and constitutes a potential threat to 

humans, animals and vegetation (ATSDR, 1997; Edewor et al., 2004; Adelowo et al., 2006). 

A single automotive oil change is estimated to produce 4–5 L of used oil. The bulk of U.M.O 

generated in India (about 0.4 million tons (1 ton = 0.907 t) annually) generally goes into 

undesirable applications and only a very small amount (10 tons annually) is currently re-

refined (IIP 1997). A large number of roadside garages drain used oils from automobile 

engines and there is no record of the next destination of such oils. Major oil-contaminated 

spots reported are Meethi River at Kurla (Mumbai) and in the Mundka and Rohtak road area 

near New Delhi (India) (IIP 1997). In the United States, about 500 million gallons of used oil 

are being disposed indiscriminately every year (Anoliefo and Vwioko 1995: Adesodun and 

Mbagwu, 2008). Likewise, about 0.1 million tons of U.M.O is reported to be wasted annually 

in Australia (Kemp 2004).  

In Brazil, the production of lubricating oils is approximately one billion liters/year 

(Conselho em Revista 2005; Magalhães et al., 2007). Of this amount, about 650 million 

liters/year are consumed by vehicles or other uses, in other words, they are not recoverable. 

Of the remaining 350 million liters/year used, which are not consumed completely in the 



 

3 

 

process, 69.2 % is recycled via re- refining, or about 240 million liters /year. Data 

from 2004 show that in that year approximately 240 million liters were collected i.e., around 

24.0 % of the lubricating oil marketed in the country. The volume of used oil collected in 

2004, enabled the processing of approximately 170 million liters of re-refined base oil 

(Magalhães et al. 2007; CEMPRE, 2007). This waste-oil usually contains appreciable 

amounts of toxic hydrocarbons and heavy metals such as V, Pb, Al, Ni, Fe, Cr and Zn 

(Whisman et al., 1974).

highest rate of percentage ratio of the volume of oil recovered through recycling process to 

the volume of used oil residue, RRP/UOR = 69 % . This result shows that among Latin 

American countries cited in 2001, Brazil had the largest volume of recycled waste oil, but 

still, the volume of 120 million litres/year presented is considerably high in waste oil 

recovered through unknown process (RUP). Probably the RUP is associated with improper 

burning of these residues. 

 

1.2. Chemistry of petroleum hydrocarbon.  
Petroleum is defined as any mixture of natural gas, condensate, and crude oil. Crude 

oil  which is a heterogeneous liquid consisting of hydrocarbons comprised almost entirely of 

the elements hydrogen and carbon in the ratio of about 2 hydrogen atoms to 1 carbon atom 

(Okoh, 2006). It also contains elements such as N, S, and O, all of which constitute less than 

3% (v/v). There are also trace constituents, comprising less than 1% (v/v), including P and 

heavy metals such as V and Ni. Crude oils could be classified according to their respective 

distillation residues as paraffins, naphthenes or aromatics and based on the relative 

proportions of the heavy molecular weight constituents as light, medium or heavy. Also, the 

composition of crudes may vary with the location and age of an oil field, and may even be 

depth dependent within an individual well. About 85% of the components of all types of 

crude oil can be classified as either asphalt base, paraffin base or mixed base. Asphalt base 

contain little paraffin wax and an asphaltic residue (Atlas, 1981). The S, O and N contents are 

often relatively higher in comparison with paraffin base crudes, which contain little or no 

asphaltic materials. Mixed crude oil contains considerable amount of oxides of N and asphalt.  

Petroleum oil biodegradation by bacteria can occur under both oxic and anoxic 

conditions (Zengler et al., 1999), albeit by the action of different consortia of organisms. In 

the subsurface, oil biodegradation occurs primarily under anoxic conditions, mediated by 

sulfate reducing bacteria (Holba et al., 1996) or other anaerobes using a variety of other 

electron acceptors as the oxidant. On a structural basis, the hydrocarbons in crude oil are 

classified as alkanes (normal or iso), cycloalkanes, and aromatics. Alkenes, which are the 

unsaturated analogs of alkanes, are rare in crude oil but occur in many refined petroleum 



 

5 

 

products as a consequence of the cracking process. Increasing carbon numbers of alkanes 

(homology), variations in carbon chain branching (iso-alkanes), ring condensations, and 

interclass combinations e.g., phenylalkanes, account for the high numbers of hydrocarbons 

that occur in crude oil. In addition, smaller amounts of O – (phenols, naphthenic acids), N - 

(pyridine, pyrrole, indole), and S - (alkylthiol, thiophene) containing compounds, collectively 

designated as “resins” and partially oxygenated, highly condensed asphaltic fraction occur 

also in crude but not in refined petroleum (Atlas and Bartha, 1973).  

The inherent biodegradability of these individual components is a reflection of their 

chemical structure, but is also strongly influenced by the physical state and toxicity of the 

compounds. As an example, while nalkanes as a structural group are the most biodegradable 

petroleum hydrocarbons, the C5 – C10 homologues have been shown to be inhibitory to the 

majority of hydrocarbon degraders. As solvents, these homologues tend to disrupt lipid 

membrane structures of microorganisms. Similarly, alkanes in the C20 – C40 range, often 

referred to as “waxes”, are hydrophobic solids at physiological temperatures. Apparently, it is 

this physical state that strongly influences their biodegradation (Bartha and Atlas, 1977). 

Primary attack on intact hydrocarbons always requires the action of oxygenases and, 

therefore, requires the presence of free O. In the case of alkanes, monooxygenase attack 

results in the production of alcohol. Most microorganisms attack alkanes terminally whereas 

some perform sub-terminal oxidation (Figure 1). The alcohol product is oxidised into an 

aldehyde and finally, to a fatty acid. The latter is degraded further by beta-oxidation. 

Extensive methyl branching interferes with the beta oxidation process and necessitates di 

terminal attack (Figure 2) or other bypass mechanisms. Therefore, nalkanes are degraded 

more readily than iso alkanes. 

Cycloalkanes are transformed by a not fully characterized oxidase system to a 

corresponding cyclic alcohol, which is dehydrated to ketone. Then, a monooxygenase system 

lactonises the ring, which is subsequently opened by a lactone hydrolase. These two 

oxygenase systems usually never occur in the same organisms and hence, the frustrated 

attempts to isolate pure cultures that grow on cycloalkanes (Bartha 1986b). However, 

synergistic actions of microbial communities are capable of dealing with degradation of 

various cycloalkanes quite effectively. As in the case of alkanes, the monocyclic compounds,

moieties, which are metabolized further by beta-oxidation (Atlas and Bartha, 1998).

cyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane have a strong solvent effect on lipid 

membranes, and are toxic to the majority of hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms. 

Highly condensed cycloalkane compounds resist biodegradation due to their structure and 

physical state (Bartha, 1986a). 

Prokaryotes convert aromatic hydrocarbons by an initial dioxygenase attack, to 

transdihydrodiols that are further oxidised to dihydroxy products, e.g., catechol in the case 

of benzene (Atlas and Bartha, 1998). Eucaryotic microorganisms use monooxygenases, 

producing benzene 1, 2-oxide from benzene, followed by the addition of water, yielding 

dihydroxydihydrobenzene (cis-dihydrodiol). This is oxidised in turn to catechol, a key 

intermediate in biodegradation of aromatics, which is then opened by ortho- or 

metacleavage, yielding muconic acid or 2- hydroxymuconic semialdehyde, respectively. 

Condensed polycyclic aromatics are degraded, one ring at a time, by a similar 

mechanism, but biodegradability tend to decline with the increasing number of rings and 

degree of condensation (Atlas and Bartha, 1998). Aromatics with more than four condensed 

rings are generally not suitable as substrates for microbial growth, though, they may 

undergo metabolic transformations. Biodegradation process also declines with the 

increasing number of alkyl substituent on the aromatic nucleus. Asphaltic tend to increase 

during biodegradation in relative and sometimes absolute amounts. This would suggest that 

they not only tend to resist biodegradation but may also be formed from beginning by 

condensation reactions of biodegradation and photodegradation intermediates. In crude 

petroleum as well as in refined products, petroleum hydrocarbons occur in complex 

mixtures and influence each other’s biodegradation. The effects may go in negative as well 

as positive directions. Some isoalkanes are apparently spared as long as nalkanes are 

available as substrates, while some condensed aromatics are metabolized only in the 

presence of more easily utilizable petroleum hydrocarbons, a process referred to as co-

metabolism (Wackett, 1996).

1.3. Effects of used lubricating oil on human health.  
Mineral-based crankcase oils are manufactured using highly refined base oils and 

contain up to 20% of a variety of additives such as viscosity index improvers, 

detergents/dispersants, antiwear additives, pour-point depressants, and antioxidants (IARC 

1984; Kirk-Othmer 1981). During use, the high temperatures and friction cause changes such 

as oxidation, nitration, and cracking of polymers in the component chemicals (Vazquez-

Duhalt 1989). In addition, a variety of substances such as fuel, water, antifreeze, dust, and 

various combustion products such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), metals, and 

metallic oxides accumulate in the oil. The degree of chemical change and accumulation of 

contaminants in the oil increases with use and varies depending on the type of fuel used and 

the mechanical properties of the engine. In an engine lubricating system, the required quantity 

of lubricant is transported where it is needed in the engine. The lubricant protects against 

wear, reduces friction, cleans the engine of dirt and residue (detergent), protects against 

corrosion, cools the engine, and seals the pistons (Van Donkelaar 1990). Additives are added 

to lubricating oils to improve its physical and chemical properties. Consequently, lubricating 

oils have high additive contents (up to 20%), especially detergents and dispersants which 

constitute 2-15% of oil weight (Vasquez-Duhalt 1989). However, several of the oil additives 

are toxic environmental contaminants, e.g., zinc dithiophosphate and zinc diary1 or dialkyl 

dithiophosphates (ZDTPs); calcium alkyl phenates; magnesium, sodium, and calcium 

sulphonates; tricresyl phosphates; molybdenum disulfide; heavy metal soaps; and other 

organometallic compounds that contain heavy metals. Hence, very high levels of zinc and 

cadmium are found in new motor oil-approximately 1,500 ?g/g of zinc and 87 ?g/kg of 

cadmium (Hewstone 1994a; Vasquez-Duhalt 1989). Although ZDTPs have a low acute 

systemic toxicity, they can cause eye damage and skin irritation (Hewstone 1994a). Prolonged 

exposure to high concentrations of ZDTPs, calcium alkyl phenates, and magnesium, sodium, 

and calcium sulphonates had significant effects on the reproductive organs of male rabbits 

(testicular atrophy and reduction or absence of spermatozoa) which appeared to be species 

specific. The absorption of tricresyl phosphates caused peripheral nervous system damage, 

leading to neuromuscular problems (Hewstone 1994a).  

In a crankcase-lubricated engine, the oil compartment acts as a sink for heavy 

molecular incomplete combustion products such as PAHs and their analogs (Scheepers and 



 

10 

 

Bos 1992). Thus, contaminants such as PAHs, which are formed via combustion, can 

accumulate in the oil by a factor of up to 1,000. PAHs are known to be highly toxic 

environmental contaminants with carcinogenic and mutagenic properties. They leave the 

engine in various ways, such as via particulates, oil leaks, and uncontrolled oil changes, which 

then accumulates in the environment. One hundred and forty different PAHs have been found 

in the used oil of crankcase-lubricated engines. These PAHs are also present in much lower 

quantities in new or fresh oil (Van Donkelaar 1990). Used mineral-based crankcase oil is a 

complex mixture of metals and PAHs. When motor oils undergo thermal decomposition, 

gasoline combustion products are formed, significantly increasing the levels of PAHs which 

contribute to the carcinogenic and mutagenic properties of the oils (Bingham 1988; Ingram et 

al. 1994). Hence, it is difficult to define the precise composition of used mineral based 

crankcase oil because of the variety of chemical additives that may be present and the varying 

degrees of chemical decomposition and contaminant accumulation.  

Aromatics hydrocarbons are considered to be the most acutely toxic component of 

petroleum products, and are also associated with chronic and carcinogenic effects (Anderson 

et al., 1974). Aromatics are often distinguished by the number of rings they possess, which 

may range from one to five (Anderson et al., 1974). Lighter, monoaromatics (one ring) 

compounds include benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX). Aromatics with two 

or more rings are referred to as polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Anderson et al., 1974). 

Used lubricating oil contains several toxic components including up to 30% aromatic 

hydrocarbons, with as much as 22 ppm benzo(a)pyrene (a PAH). Upshall et al., (1993) 

reported that motor oil had a density of 0.828 g/ml and contained 14% aromatics and 65.4% 

aliphatic (by weight). In their study, the sum of 26 individual PAHs represented 0.17% of the 

oil, or 1.2% of the aromatic fraction. Chronic effects of naphthalene, a constituent in used 

motor oil, include changes in the liver and harmful effects on the kidneys, heart, lungs, and 

nervous system. Due to their relative persistence and potential for various chronic effects (like 

carcinogenicity), PAHs (and particularly the alkyl PAHs) can contribute to long term 

(chronic) hazards of jet fuels in contaminated soils, sediments, and groundwater.

1.4. Bioremediation strategies.  
The term bioremediation describes the process of contaminant degradation in the 

environment by biological methods using the metabolic potential of microorganisms to 

degrade a wide variety of organic compounds (Scragg, 2005). The main advantage of 

bioremediation is its reduced cost compared to conventional techniques. Besides cost 

effectiveness, it is a permanent solution, which may lead to complete mineralization of the 

pollutant. Furthermore, it is a non-invasive technique, leaving the ecosystem intact (Perelo, 

2010). Bioremediation can deal with lower concentration of contaminants where the cleanup 

by physical or chemical methods would not be feasible. The goal of bioremediation is to 

degrade organic pollutants to concentrations that are undetectable, or if detectable, to 

concentrations below the limits established as safe or acceptable by regulatory agencies. 

Bioremediation has been used for the degradation of chemicals in soils, groundwater, 

wastewater, sludge, industrial wastewater systems, and gases (Okoh and Trejo-Hernandez, 

2006). For bioremediation to be effective, microorganisms must enzymatically attack the 

pollutants and convert them to harmless products. As bioremediation can be effective only 

where environmental conditions permit microbial growth and activity, its application often 

involves the manipulation of environmental parameters to allow microbial growth and 

degradation to proceed at a faster rate (Vidali, 2001). Potential advantages of bioremediation 

compared to other treatment methods include destruction rather than transfer of the 

contaminant to another medium; minimal exposure of the on-site workers to the contaminant; 

longtime protection of public health; and possible reduction in the duration of the remedial 

process (Okoh and Trejo- Hernandez, 2006). These advantages of the bioremediation systems 

over the other technologies have been summarized (Leavin and Gealt, 1993) as follows: can 

be done on site i.e. in situ application; keeps site destruction to a minimum; eliminates 

transportation costs and liabilities; eliminates long-term liability; biological systems are 

involved, hence often less expensive; and can be coupled with other treatment techniques to 

form a treatment train. There are three classifications of bioremediation according to 

Hornung, (1997): Biotransformation - the alteration of contaminant molecules into less or 

nonhazardous molecules Biodegradation - the breakdown of organic substances in smaller 

organic or inorganic molecules Mineralization - is the complete biodegradation of organic 

materials into inorganic constituents such as CO2 or H2O. There are three general approaches 



 

12 

 

to cleaning up contaminated soils:(i) Soil can be excavated from the ground and be either 

treated or disposed of (Ex-situ treatment), (ii) Soil can be left in the ground and treated in 

place (in-situ treatment), or (iii) soil can be left in the ground and contained to prevent the 

contamination from becoming more widespread and reaching plants, animals, or humans 

(containment and intrinsic remediation), (Jim et al., 2005). 

 

1.4.1. In-situ bioremediation technologies.  
In situ bioremediation (ISB) is the use of microorganisms to degrade contaminants in 

place with the goal of obtaining harmless chemicals as end products (Jim et al., 2005). ISB 

has the potential to provide advantages such as complete destruction of the contaminant(s), 

lower risk to site workers, and lower equipment/operating costs (US EPA, 1997). This 

technology is highly dependent upon external conditions, which is the key to determining 

whether bioremediation can be performed in situ. The conditions of greatest importance are 

the physicochemical and chemical conditions that exist in the contaminated soil. These 

conditions includes dissolved oxygen for aerobic processes, moisture content, pH, nutrient 

availability especially with regard to nitrogen and phosphorus, temperature, soil composition 

and concentration of contaminants (Jim et al., 2005). These techniques are generally the most 

desirable options due to lower cost and fewer disturbances since they provide the treatment in 

place by avoiding excavation and transport of contaminants. In situ treatment is limited by the 

depth of the soil that can be effectively treated. In many soils effective oxygen diffusion for 

desirable rates of bioremediation extend to a range of only a few centimeters to about 30 cm 

into the soil, although depths of 60 cm and greater have been effectively treated in some cases 

(Vidali, 2001). Accelerated in situ bioremediation is where substrate or nutrients are added to 

an aquifer to stimulate the growth of a target consortium of bacteria. Usually the target 

bacteria are indigenous; however enriched cultures of bacteria (from other sites) that are 

highly efficient at degrading a particular contaminant can be introduced into the aquifer 

(bioaugmentation). Accelerated ISB is used where it is desired to increase the rate of 

contaminant biotransformation, which may be limited by lack of required nutrients, electron 

donor or electron acceptor. The type of amendment required depends on the target 

metabolism for the contaminant of interest. Aerobic ISB may only require the addition of 

oxygen, while anaerobic ISB often requires the addition of both an electron donor (e.g., 



 

13 

 

lactate, benzoate) as well as an electron acceptor (e.g., nitrate, sulfate). Chlorinated solvents, 

in particular, often require the addition of a carbon substrate to stimulate reductive 

dechlorination. The goal of accelerated ISB is to increase the biomass throughout the 

contaminated volume of aquifer, thereby achieving effective biodegradation of dissolved and 

sorbed contaminant (Wiedemeier et al., 1998). Accelerated in situ bioremediation can be 

carried out in two ways: biostimulation and bioaugmentation. 

 

1.5. Factors affecting biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons.  

The fate of a contaminant in the environment is determined by characteristics of the 

pollutants, the microorganisms, and the environment (Pfaender, Shimp, Palumbo, and 

Bartholomew, 1985; Madsen, 1991; Tiedje, 1993). The concentration, distribution, function, 

and structure of the contaminants; the physiology and genetics of the indigenous or introduced 

microorganisms; and the various soil factors,  all result in complex interactions in the 

subsurface. If one of these critical components is suboptimal for conversion of organic 

contaminants, biodegradation will be slow or may not take place (Turco and Sadowsky, 

1995). Microbial degradation of hydrocarbons in the environment largely depends on the 

number of biotic and abiotic factors. Some of these factors which will be discussed in detail in 

this section include: (1) Chemical and physical factor, (2) Biological factor and (3) Soil and 

Environmental Factor. 

1.5.1. Chemical and physical factor.  
Organic compounds differ widely in their solubility, from infinitely miscible polar 

compounds, such as methanol, to extremely low solubility nonpolar compounds, such as 

polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Horvath, 1982). Many synthetic chemicals have 

low water solubilities (Stucki and Alexander, 1987). The availability of a compound to an 

organism will dictate its biodegradability (U.S. EPA, 1985a). Compounds with greater 

aqueous solubilities are generally more available to degradative enzymes. An example is cis 

-1,2- dichloroethylene, which is preferentially degraded relative to trans -1,2-

dichloroethylene. This is probably due to “cis ” being more polar than “ trans ” and, 

therefore, more water soluble. 



 

14 

 

The composition and inherent biodegradability of the petroleum hydrocarbon pollutant 

is the first and most important consideration when the suitability of a cleanup approach is to 

be evaluated (Okoh, 2006). Compositional heterogeneity among different crude oils and 

refined products influences the overall rate of biodegradation both of the oil and of its 

component fractions (Leahly and Colwell, 1990). Biodegradability is inherently influenced by 

the composition of the oil pollutant. For example, kerosene, which consists almost exclusively 

of medium chain alkanes, is under suitable conditions, totally biodegradable. Similarly, crude 

oil is biodegradable quantitatively, but for heavy asphaltic-naphthenic crude oils, only about 

11% may be biodegradable within a reasonable time period, even if the conditions are 

favourable (Bartha, 1986b). Okoh et al., (2002) reported that between 8.8 and 29% of the 

heavy crude oil Maya was biodegraded in soil microcosm by mixed bacterial consortium in 

15 days, although major peak components of the oil was reduced by between 6.5 and 70% 

(Okoh, 2003). Also, about 89% of the same crude oil was biodegraded by axenic culture of 

Burkholderia cepacia RQ1 in shake flask (Okoh et al., 2001) within similar time frame. 

Okoh, (2003) noted that heavier crude oils are generally much more difficult to biodegrade 

than lighter ones, just as heavier crude oils could be suitable for inducing increased selection 

pressure for the isolation of petroleum hydrocarbon degraders with enhanced efficiency. Also, 

Okoh et al., (2002) noted that the amount of heavy crude oil metabolized by some bacterial 

species increased with increasing concentration of starter oil up to 0.6% (w/v), while 

degradation rates appeared to be more pronounced between the concentrations of 0.4 and 

0.6% (w/v) oil. 

The physical and chemical nature of the oil pollution is a critical factor in determining 

rates of biodegradation. Access to the pollutant is a major consideration when trying to 

degrade hydrocarbons which are, to a greater extent, hydrophobic. The dispersion of crude oil 

as an oil-in-water emulsion will increase the surface area available for microbial attack and 

thus increasing the rate of biodegradation. However, water-in-oil, or "mousse", emulsions can 

form, creating a low surface area to volume ratio, inhibiting biodegradation (Wilkinson et al., 

2002). The degree of spreading of oil in water or soil environment determines in part the 

surface area of oil available for microbial colonization by hydrocarbon-degrading 

microorganisms; in aquatic systems, the oil normally spreads, forming a thin slick (Atlas, 

1981). The degree of spreading is reduced at low temperatures because of the viscosity of the 



 

15 

 

oil. In soils, petroleum hydrocarbons are absorbed by plant matter and soil particles, limiting 

its spreading. Similarly 'tar balls', which are large aggregates of weathered un-degraded oil, 

restrict access by microorganisms because of their limited surface area. Auto-oxidation, 

photooxidation and the removal of low molecular weight hydrocarbons by microbes all aid 

their formation and tar balls may take thousands of years to degrade (Wilkinson et al., 2002). 

Hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms act mainly at the oil-water interface. Such 

microorganisms can be observed growing over the entire surface of an oil droplet; growth 

does not appear to occur within oil droplets in the absence of entrained water. Availability of 

increased surface area will under normal circumstance accelerate biodegradation (Atlas, 1981; 

Ijah and Antai, 2003b).   

Concentration of Petroleum hydrocarbon determines to a greater extent the rate of 

breakdown of the hydrocarbons from the environment. Concentration of hydrocarbon can 

affect its biodegradability and toxicity to the degrading organisms. High concentration of 

hydrocarbon can be inhibitory to microorganisms, and concentration with which inhibition 

occurs will vary with the compound. Concentrations of 1 to 100?g/ml of water or 1 to 

100?g/g of soil or sediment (on dry weight basis) are not generally considered to be toxic to 

common heterotrophic bacteria and fungi. Ijah and Antai, (2003b) reported high degradation 

of hydrocarbons in soil contaminated with 10% and 20% crude oil compared to those 

contaminated with 30 and 40% crude oil which experienced partial degradation of 

hydrocarbons within a period of 12 months. Another authors reported that percentage of 

degradation by mixed bacterial consortium decreased from 78% to 52% as the concentration 

of crude oil was increased from 1 to 10% (Rahman et al., 2002). High concentrations of 

hydrocarbons can be associated with heavy, undispersed oil slicks in water, causing inhibition 

of biodegradation by nutrient or oxygen limitation or through toxic effects exerted by volatile 

hydrocarbons. Fusey and Oudot (1984) reported that contamination of seashore sediments 

with crude oil above a threshold concentration prevented biodegradation of the oil because of 

oxygen and/or nutrient limitation.

1.5.2. Biological factor.  
Increased persistence of chemicals may result from several types of biological 

interactions: (1) the biocidal properties of the chemicals to soil microorganisms may preclude 

their biodegradation, (2) direct inhibition of the adaptive enzymes of effective soil 

microorganisms, and (3) inhibition of the proliferation processes of effective microorganisms 

(Kaufman, 1983). Inhibition of microbial degradation may ultimately affect the mobility of a 

chemical in soil. Bioavailability is extremely important to biodegradation of organic 

pollutants. It is frequently observed that the rate of removal of compounds from soil is very 

low even though the compounds are biodegradable, the substrates in these instance may not 

be in a form that is readily available to the microorganisms (Jim et al., 2005). Biodegradation 

of hydrophobic pollutants may take place only in the aqueous phase, e.g., naphthalene is 

utilized by pure cultures of bacteria only in the dissolved state (Wodzinski and Bertolini, 

1972). Bouchez et al., (1995) similarly showed that phenanthrene biodegradation occurs only 

in the aqueous phase. The three main classes of hydrocarbons (aliphatic, alicyclic and 

aromatic hydrocarbons) vary in their biodegradability according to size and solubility. It is 

believed that only molecules of hydrocarbons that are dissolved in the aqueous phase are 

available for intracellular metabolism (Sikkema et al., 1995). The rate at which a particular 

organic compound dissolves in water is critical to its biodegradability because this governs 

the rate of transfer to the organism (Jim et al. 2005). The rate of transfer is determined by the 

equilibrium and actual concentration in the bulk phase and aqueous phase. This central to the 

concept of bioavailability as it relates to biodegradation. 

 

1.5.3. Soil and environmental factor.  
Many microorganisms have specific ecological niches for proliferation and 

colonization (Daubaras and Chakrabarty, 1992). Metabolism by the indigenous microflora is 

influenced by soil and environmental factors, such as light, temperature (climate, daily and 

seasonal temperature fluctuations), pH, presence of cometabolites, reactive radicals, other 

organic and inorganic compounds, available oxygen and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), 

as well as the physical state of the oil (Cooney, Silver, and Beck, 1985), moisture content, 

organic matter, oxidation-reduction potential, attenuation, and soil texture and structure. The 

environment influences biodegradation by regulating both the bioavailability of the compound 



 

17 

 

and the activity of the degraders. Often the most important factor limiting rates of 

biodegradation in the environment is the availability of molecular oxygen (Jim et al., 2005). 

The initial step in the catabolism of hydrocarbons by bacteria and fungi involves the oxidation 

of the substrate by oxygenase to which molecular oxygen is required. Aerobic condition is 

therefore necessary for this route of microbial oxidation of hydrocarbons in the soil 

environment. The availability of oxygen in the soil is dependent on rates of microbial oxygen 

consumption, the type of soil, and the presence of utilizable substrate, which can lead to 

oxygen depletion (Bartha and Bossert, 1984). Delivering air or oxygen to contaminated soils 

may be difficult for a number of reasons: the soil porosity may not be favourable and 

therefore mass transfer from the gas phase to the aqueous phase will be limited. Also 

relatively low solubility of oxygen in water is a primary limiting factor (Jim, et al. 2005). 

Most contaminated soil may contain large populations of the appropriate microorganisms but 

can remain contaminated for decades or longer as a result of conditions that do not favour 

rapid biodegradation of complex pollutants.  The complete oxidation of aromatic compounds 

and hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide is difficult in the absence of molecular oxygen due to the 

great stability of C – H and C – C bonds. 

 Temperature plays very important roles in biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons, 

firstly by its direct effect on the chemistry of the pollutants, and secondly on its effect on the 

physiology and diversity of the microorganisms (Okoh, 2006). Soil temperature is one of the 

more important factors controlling microbiological activity and the rate of organic matter 

decomposition (Sims and Bass, 1984). Temperatures of both air and soil affect the rate of 

biological degradation processes in the soil, as well as the soil moisture content (JRB 

Associates, Inc., 1984). Temperature affects the physical nature and composition of the 

petroleum, the rate of microbial hydrocarbon metabolism, and the composition of the 

microbial communities (Atlas, 1994). Ambient temperature of an environment affects both the 

properties of spilled oil and the activity or population of microorganisms (Venosa and Zhu, 

2003). Temperature plays a significant role in controlling the nature and extent of microbial 

hydrocarbon metabolism (Nedwell, 1999; Frederic et al., 2005). Temperature affects the rate 

of biodegradation, as well as the physical nature and chemical composition of hydrocarbons 

(Whyte et al., 1998; Rowland et al., 2000). Although microbial activity is generally reduced at 

low temperatures, many of the components in crude oil and diesel can actually be degraded by 



 

18 

 

psychrophilic and psychrotrophic microorganisms (Margesin and Schinner, 1999a). The 

bioavailability of soluble hydrophobic substances, such as aliphatic and polyaromatic 

hydrocarbons, is temperature dependent. A temperature increase leads to an increase in 

diffusion rates of organic compounds notably by a decrease of their viscosity (Northcott and 

Jones, 2000). Thus, higher molecular reaction rates due to smaller boundary layers are 

expected at elevated temperatures. In counterpart, the increased volatilization and solubility of 

some hydrocarbons at elevated temperature may enhance their toxicity (Whyte et al., 1998). 

Such an increase in toxicity may delay the onset of degradation (Leahly and Colwell, 1990). 

Temperature influences the rate of abiotic weathering process notably evaporation. 

Temperature can also affect hydrocarbon utilization; bacteria relatively metabolize 

isoprenoids at 30oC but have difficulty doing so at 40oC. Although many species can 

withstand freezing and thawing, bacteria cease growth and metabolism altogether at 

temperature below 12oC due to the formation of intracellular ice (Margesin and Schinner, 

1999b). It is essential that contaminated sites be at the optimum temperature for 

bioremediation to progress successfully, since excessively high or low temperatures 

sometimes inhibit microbial metabolism. Although hydrocarbon biodegradation can occur 

over a wide range of temperatures, the rate of biodegradation generally decreases with 

decreasing temperature. Highest degradation rates generally occur in the range of 30 – 40 oC 

in soil environments, 20 – 30oC in some freshwater environments, and 15 – 20 oC in marine 

environments (Bartha and Bossert, 1984). In addition, the solubility and bioavailability of a 

contaminant will increase as temperature increases, and oxygen solubility will be reduced, 

which will leave less oxygen available for microbial metabolism (Margesin and Schinner, 

1999a).  

Nutrients are very important ingredients for successful biodegradation of hydrocarbon 

pollutants, especially N, P and in some cases Fe (Okoh, 2006). Inadequate mineral nutrient, 

especially N, and P, often limits the growth of hydrocarbon utilizers in water and soils. 

Addition of N and P to an oil polluted soil has been shown to accelerate the biodegradation of 

the petroleum in soil (Ijah and Safiyanu, 1997). Addition of a carbon source as a nutrient in 

contaminated soil is known to enhance the rate of pollutant degradation by stimulating the 

growth of microorganisms responsible for biodegradation of the pollutant. Depending on the 

nature of the impacted environment, some of these nutrients could become limiting, hence the 



 

19 

 

additions of nutrients are necessary to enhance the biodegradation of oil pollutants (Kim et al., 

2005). It has been suggested that the addition of carbon in the form of pyruvate stimulates the 

microbial growth and enhances the rate of PAH degradation. Depending on the nature of the 

impacted environment, some of these nutrients could become limiting, hence the additions of 

nutrients are necessary to enhance the biodegradation of oil pollutants (Kim et al., 2005). 

Pelletier et al., (2004) assessed the effectiveness of fertilizers for crude oil bioremediation in 

sub-Antarctic intertidal sediments over a one year and observed that chemical, microbial and 

toxicological parameters demonstrated the effectiveness of various fertilizers in a pristine 

environment. Frederic et al., (2005), observed that addition of commercial oleophilic 

fertilizers containing N and P to hydrocarbon contaminated soil increased the hydrocarbon. 

Soil pH can be highly variable, ranging from 2.5 in mine spoils to 11.0 in alkaline 

deserts (Bossert and Bartha, 1984). Most heterotrophic bacteria and fungi favor a pH near 

neutrality, with fungi being more tolerant to acidic conditions (Atlas, 1988). Extremes in pH, 

as can be observed in some soils, would have a negative influence on the ability of microbial 

populations to degrade hydrocarbons. Verstraete et al., (1976) reported a near doubling of 

rates of biodegradation of gasoline in an acidic (pH 4.5) soil by adjusting the pH to 7.4. Rates 

dropped significantly, however, when the pH was further raised to 8.5. Similarly, Dibble and 

Bartha (1979) observed an optimal pH of 7.8, in the range 5.0 to 7.8, for the mineralization of 

oily sludge in soil. The pH of sediments in special environments such as salt marshes may be 

as low as 5.0 in some cases. Hambrick et al., (1980) found that the rates of microbial 

mineralization of octadecane and napthalene to be depressed at this pH compared with pH 

6.5. Octadecane mineralization rates increased further when the pH was raised from 6.5 to 

8.0, whereas naphthalene mineralization rates did not.

BIOREMEDIATION OF BRAZILIAN SOILS CONTAMINATED WITH USED 
LUBRICATING OIL 

 

ABSTRACT 
 

Environmental pollution with petroleum and petrochemical products has attracted 
much attention in recent decades. The use of various kinds of automobiles and machinery 
vehicles has caused an increase in the use of motor oil and in addition, oil spillages into the 
environment have become one of the major problems. Spillages of used lubricating oils 
contaminate natural environment with hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons spread both vertically 
and horizontally on both surface and ground-water bodies, soil pore space and adhere/adsorb 
into surfaces of soil particles. The contamination of groundwater resources by organic 
chemicals is significant environmental problem that can constitute risks to health of humans 
and animals. It is believed that remediation methods are favoured and have been used 
particularly as a secondary treatment option for clean-up of oil spillage. This work has the 
intent for evaluation and remediation of organic pollutants in particular, spent motor oil 
contaminated soils via bioremediation.  The rates of biodegradation of the used motor oil were 
studied for a period of 90 days. The model soil of 300 g was contaminated with 1.5 % (w/w) 
of used motor oil at room temperature under laboratory conditions using microcosm of 1 L. 
The microcosm was used to simulate the comparative effect of spent oil addition and 
bioremediation using a commercially available hydrocarbon degrading microbial consortium - 
Amnite p1300 as the bioaugmentation  (T1),  nutrients amendments - (NH4)2SO4 and K2HPO4 
(NPK) as biostimulation treatment (T2), unammended soil - natural attenuation as (T3) and 
the control soil treated with sodium azide (NaN3) as (T4) on the microbial community in three 
different soil  types (S1, S2 and S3). Hydrocarbon-utilizing bacterial counts were high in the 
amended soils with treatments T1, T2, and T3 ranging from 3.47 × 106 to 3.27 × 108 CFU/g 
compared to T4 throughout the 90 days of study. Oil-contaminated soil in T1 showed the 
highest reduction in total petroleum hydrocarbon with net loss of 36.17 % throughout the 90 
days of the experiment compared to other treatments and three soils. The development of the 
microbial community and its recovery is a useful and sensitive way of monitoring the impact 
and recovery of used motor oil-contaminated soils. Commercially available microbial-based 
bioremediation products may be used with some success in tropical soil environments, 
however soil-specific trials may be required to ensure that the best commercial product is 
selected. As an alternative, the selective enrichment of indigenous microorganisms may result 
in similar performance at a reduced cost. The results suggest that different soils have different 
inherent microbial potential to degrade hydrocarbons under spent oil pollution. This finding 
should be taken into account in impact and risk assessments of petroleum polluted soils. 

 
Key words: Bioremediation, used lubricating oil, hydrocarbons, microbial consortium,

BIORREMEDIAÇÃO DE SOLOS BRASILEIRO CONTAMINADOS COM ÓLEO 
LUBRIFICANTE USADO 

RESUMO 

A poluição ambiental com petróleo e produtos petroquímicos tem atraído muito atenção 
em décadas recentes. O uso de veículos automotivos e de diversos tipos de maquinaria aumentou 
o uso de óleo de motor e, assim, com os derramamentos de óleos no ambiente tem-se grande 
problema.  Derrames de óleo lubrificante usado como diesel ou gasolina contaminam o ambiente 
natural com hidrocarbonetos. Os hidrocarbonetos difundem-se verticalmente e horizontalmente na 
superfície e nos corpos d’água subterrâneos, nos espaços porosos do solo e se adsorvem às 
partículas do solo. A contaminação das águas subterrâneas por compostos orgânicos é problema 
ambiental significativo que pode constituir risco à saúde da humana e animal. Acredita-se que os 
métodos de remediação são favorecidos e sido usados particularmente como opção de tratamento 
secundário para a limpeza de derrames de óleo. Este trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar 
biorremediação solos contaminados com óleos de motor usado. As taxas de biodegradação do óleo 
de motor usado foram avaliadas por um período de 90 dias. Amostras de trezentos gramas de solo 
foram contaminadas com 1,5% (w/w) com óleo de motor usado, a temperatura ambiente sob 
condições laboratoriais usando microcosmos de 1L. O microcosmo foi usado para simular o efeito 
comparativo da adição de óleo usado e bioremediação utilizando um coquetel de microorganismos 
disponível comercialmente, para degradar hidrocarbonetos – Amnite p1300 como tratamento de 
crescimento bacteriano (T1), adição de nutrientes - (NH4)2SO4 e K2HPO4 (NPK) como tratamento 
de bioestimulação (T2), solo controle- atenuação natural (T3) e solo controle tratado com azida de 
sódio (NaN3) (T4) sob a comunidade microbiana em três diferentes tipos de solo (S1, S2 e S3). O 
número de bactérias que utilizam hidrocabornetos foi elevado nos tratamentos T1, T2 e T3 
variando de 3.47 × 106 a 3.27 × 108 UFC/g comparação ao controle (T4) durante os 90 dias do 
estudo. Em T1, o solo contaminado com óleo mostrou uma elevada redução no total de 
hidrocarbonetos do petróleo com degradação liquida de 36,17% ao longo dos 90 dias de 
experimento, quando comparado aos outros tratamentos e três solos. O desenvolvimento da 
comunidade microbiana e sua recuperação revelaram ser uma maneira útil e sensível de monitorar 
o impacto e recuperação dos solos contaminados com óleos de motor usados. Produtos 
microbianos para bioremediação disponíveis comercialmente podem ser usado com algum 
sucesso em solos tropicais; entretanto estudos específicos para o tipo de solo são necessários de 
modo a assegurar a seleção do melhor produto comercial. Como alternativa, o enriquecimento 
seletivo de microorganismos indígenas pode resultar em desempenho similar a custo reduzido. Os 
resultados sugerem que diferentes solos apresentam diferentes potenciais microbianos inerentes 
para degradar hidrocarbonetos sob poluição por óleo usado. Tais descobertas devem ser levadas 
em consideração na avaliação de impacto e riscos de solos poluídos por petróleo.

1. Introduction 

Despite efforts in some countries to recover and recycle used motor oils, significant 

amounts of lubricants are input into the environment, particularly in environmentally sensitive 

applications such as forestry and mining, or through engine losses (Battersby, 2000). 

Consequently, considerable attention has been given to lubricant biodegradability and 

persistence in the environment. Therefore, there is a need for effective and environmentally 

safe cleanup treatments of oil spills. The United State Environmental Protection Agency (40 

CFR Part 279) defined “used oil’’ as “any oil that has been refined from crude oil or any 

synthetic oil that has been used and, as a result of such use is contaminated by physical or 

chemical impurities.’’ Used motor oil contains metals and heavy polycyclic aromatic 

hydrocarbons derived from engine oil - a complex mixture of hydrocarbons and other organic 

compounds, including some organometallic constituents (Butler and Mason, 1997) that is 

used to lubricate parts of an automobile engine, in order to smooth engine operation (Hagwell 

et al., 1992; Boonchan et al., 2000). The rise in consumption of automotive lubricating oil is a 

worldwide problem and has increased in large used oil volume and its waste. In Brazil, the 

problems tend to worsen with economic growth, population growth, and rapid 

industrialization and disregard for environmental health, particularly in relation to used motor 

oil. The consumption of lubricating oil in Brazil is around 106 m3/year (Conselho em Revista, 

2005; Magalhães et al.,2007). Approximately 6.5 x 105 m3/year are consumed in the 

lubrication process, and from 3.5 x 105 m3/year remainder, only 20% are treated or recycled; 

therefore, significant volumes of used motor oil are continually discharged into the 

ecosystems (local environment). Release of hydrocarbons into the environment whether 

accidentally or due to human activities is a main cause of water and soil pollution (Holliger et 

al., 1997). These hydrocarbon pollutants usually cause disruptions of natural equilibrium 

between the living species and their natural environment. The persistent hydrocarbon 

components are known to have carcinogenic and neurotoxic activities (Reddy and Matthew, 

2001; Das and Chandran, 2010). One gallon of used motor oil, improperly disposed of, may 

contaminate 1 million gallons of fresh water, which is enough to supply 50 people with 

drinking water for one year. One pint (4 gills or 568.26 cubic centimeters) of used motor oil 

improperly disposed of can create a one-acre slick on the surface of a body of water and kill 

floating aquatic organisms (USEPA, 1996).  



 

23 

 

The uses and unsafe disposal of petroleum hydrocarbon products increase soil 

contamination, and this has constituted major environmental problems. Therefore, the 

development of research to remediate soils contaminated with used motor oils, in particular 

bioremediation, provides an effective and efficient strategy to speed up the clean-up processes 

(Mandri and Lin, 2007). Various factors including lack of essential nutrients such as nitrogen 

and phosphorus may limit the rate of petroleum hydrocarbon degradation from contaminated 

soil. Addition of inorganic nutrients (biostimulation) is therefore needed as an effective 

approach to enhance the bioremediation process (Semple et al., 2006; Walworth et al., 2007). 

Also, many microbial strains, each capable of degrading a specific compound, are available 

commercially for bioremediation (Bragg et al., 1994; Korda et al., 1997; Song et al., 1990). 

This study aimed at evaluating of the remediation potentials of organic pollutants, in 

particular, spent motor oil contaminated soils, via bioremediation using commercial microbial 

consortium. It was also aimed to test a kinetic model to determine the rate of biodegradation 

of the hydrocarbon in the soil and subsequently determine the half-life of the oil degradation. 

 

2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 

2.1. Collection of samples. The soil sample used was collected from three different 

locations in Minas Gerais State, Brazil, in a hermetic bag and transported to the laboratory for 

analysis. Used engine oil was collected from a gasoline and car service station close to the 

Federal University of Viçosa. Amnite P1300 special bacterial strains (Amnite P1300) 

specially made to degrade used motor oil was obtained from Cleveland Biotech Ltd., UK 

 

2.2. Experimental Design: microcosm set-up description. The model soil of 300 g 

was contaminated with 1.5 % (w/w) or (15000 mg/kg) of used motor oil at room temperature 

of (25 ± 1 0C) under laboratory conditions using microcosm of 1 L. The microcosms were 

used to simulate the comparative effect of spent oil addition and bioremediation using a 

commercially available hydrocarbon degrading microbial consortium (Amnite P1300), 

consisting a mixture of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas putida, 

Pseudomonas fluorescens, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Rhodococcus rhodocrous on a 

cereal (bran) as the bioaugmentation treatment. The microorganisms were conditioned to 

degrade heavy hydrocarbons. The population numbers in Amnite P1300 was approximately 5 



 

24 

 

x 108 cfu/g of bran. Also, the polluted soils were amended with (NH4)2SO4 and K2HPO4) as 

biostimulation. The C:N:P ratio of the nutrient compound was adjusted to 100:7.5:1 (optimum 

conditions). The same conditions provided in the biostimulation treatment were used in the 

bioaugmentation treatments plus the addition of Amnite P1300. The unammended soil 

(natural attenuation), without addition of nutrients and microbial inoculum was included to 

indicate hydrocarbon degradation capability of microorganisms naturally present in the 

contaminated soils (i.e. the autochthonous microbes). There was a control soil in which most 

of the indigenous bacteria were killed by the added biocide sodium azide (NaN3) (0.3% ww 

_1) to inhibit soil microorganisms and to monitor abiotic hydrocarbon losses on the microbial 

community in three different soil types. There were six sampling dates; hence 36 microcosms 

in total were used. Microcosms were arranged in a random order, and rearranged every 2 

weeks ± 2 days throughout the duration of the experiment The treatments were set up in 

triplicate, while the content of each container was tilled every week for aeration, and the 

moisture content was maintained at 70% (Pramer and Bartha, 1972), water holding capacity 

by the addition of sterile distilled water every week until the end of the experiment. 

 
 

2.3. Sampling. Periodic sampling from each microcosm was carried out at 15-day 

intervals for 90 days. Composite samples were obtained by mixing 10 g of soil collected from 

different areas of the microcosm for bacteria enumeration and determination of total 

petroleum hydrocarbon. 

 

2.4. Determination of the physicochemical property of the soil. Table 2 shows the 

origin and selected physical and chemical characteristics of the noncontaminated soil samples 

used for the bioremediation studies. Nitrogen content of the soil was determined using the 

Kjeldahl method, the available phosphorus was determined by colometry after Mehlich 1 

extraction and Organic Carbon content was determined using a modifield Walkley-Black 

(1934) method. The pH was determined using 1:2.5 ratio by weight with distilled water (w/v) 

after 30-min equilibration using a pH meter and electrode calibrated with pH 4.0 and 7.0 

standards. Determinations were made in triplicate.

2.5. Microbial monitoring and enumeration of total aerobic heterotrophic and 

hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria. The study was conducted at room temperature and 

monitoring was performed on days 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90. To monitor cell numbers and 

biodegradation, 1 g of soil was removed from each microcosm at the set times and suspended 

in 9 mL of saline solution  in sterile centrifuge tubes. The mixture was vigorously shaken on a 

vortex mixer for 3 minutes and then the soil particulates were allowed to settle for 1 min 

before 0.1 mL of the supernatant was sampled for CFU counts. The number of colony-

forming total aerobic heterotrophic bacteria (AHB) was determined by plating three replicate 

samples from each treatment withdrawn every 15 days. Serially diluted samples (0.1 mL) 

were plated on nutrient agar medium (Oxoid) supplemented with 10 mg/mL solution of 

cycloheximide in which 1 mL/L was drawn to suppress the growth of fungi. The oil agar 

plates were incubated at 30°C for 24 hours, and the colonies were counted. Also, enumeration 



 

26 

 

of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (HDB) was attempted on a mineral medium containing 

motor oil as the sole carbon source. The mineral medium contained 1.8 g K2HPO4, 4.0 g 

NH4Cl, 0.2 g MgSO4.7H2O, 1.2 g KH2PO4, 0.01 g FeSO4.7H2O, 0.1 g NaCl, 20 g agar, one 

percent (1%) used engine oil in 1,000 mL distilled water, and the medium was adjusted to  pH 

7.4 (Zajic and Supplission, 1972). The oil agar plates were incubated at 30°C for 7 days 

before the colonies were counted. 

 
2.6. Extraction of residual oil and analysis of total petroleum hydrocarbons. Total 

Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPHs) were extracted according to EPA method 3546 (US EPA, 

2007) using the Microwave Automated Reaction System from CEM (Matthews, NC). Briefly, 

Sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) was purified by drying overnight in an oven at 150°C and quickly 

transferred into a desiccator, Five grams (5 g) of homogenised contaminated soil was weighed 

out, mixed with 5 g dry anhydrous Na2SO4 and ground to less than 1 mm particle sizes, 

extracted in GreenChem vessels with 25 mL of a 1:1 hexane:acetone mixture according to 

manufacturer’s protocol at 100 °C for 20 minutes.  The n-hexane and acetone was filtered 

through whatman No 1 filter paper to separate the extract from the soil particles, and 

transferred into 100 mL amber vials through separatory funnel and sequentially rinsed with 

equal volume of solvent mixture. The solvent were evaporated topartial dryness with a rotary 

evaporator (Fizatom Rotavapor 801), transferred into 2 mL vials and then dried completely 

using nitrogen gas. Dried samples were dissolved in 600 µL dichloromethane for gas 

chromatography analysis. The residual oil was analyzed on Shimadzu GC-17A 

Chromatograph equipped with a Flame-Ionization Detector (FID) by using fused silica 

capillary column DB-5 (30 x 0.25 mm), and AOC-17 Shimadzu auto injector complying with 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard method 8015 (US EPA 2007). The flow 

rate of the helium carrier gas was 1.81 mL/min with linear velocity of 38.49 cm/s. The initial 

temperature was programmed at 40oC and held for 15 min. The temperature was then 

increased to 280oC at a rate of 10oC /min. The final temperature was held for 31 min. The 

injector was set in the split mode, the split ratio was set to 1:10; the injection volume was 1 

µL and the injector and the detector temperature for GC were maintained at 260 and 280°C, 

respectively, and the oven temperature was programmed to rise from 40 to 280°C in 

10°C/min increments and to hold at 280°C for 31 min. The dry weight of the soil samples was 



 

27 

 

determined following baking of 10 g of wet soil at &gt; 80 °C for at least 48 hours. Before 

analyzing the sample extract, a mixture of standards including n-alkanes (n-decane n-C10, n-

dodecane n-C12, n-tetradecane n-C14, n-hexadecane n-C16, n-octadecane n-C18, n-eicosane n-

C20, n-docosane n-C22, n-tetracosane n-C24, n-hexacosane n-C26, n-octacosane n-C28 and a 

pure standards containing n-triacontane n-C30, n-dotriacontane n-C32, n-tetratriacontane n-

C34, and n-hexatriacontane n-C36, and a mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 

consisting of acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, benzo (a) anthracene, benzo (a) 

pyrene, benzo (b) fluoranthene, benzo (g, h, i) perylene, benzo (k) fluoranthene, chrysene, 

dibenz (a, h) anthracene, fluoranthene,fluorine, indeno (1, 2, 3-cd) pyrene, naphthalene, 

phenanthrene, pyrene, 1-methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene, Supelco) were used for 

calibration. Five points calibration curves using peak areas were obtained and the response 

factors were used to determine the concentrations of various hydrocarbons in the sample 

extract. The total petroleum hydrocarbons were identified and quantified by comparing the 

peak area of samples with that of the standard of the TPH mixture with reference to the curve 

derived from standards. Percentage of degradation was calculated by the following 

expression:  

% ???????????????????????????? = ?
?????? ?????????????? –  ?????? ??????????????????

?????? ??????????????
? × 100                            (1)  

 

TPH data were fitted to the first-order kinetics model (Yeung et al., 1997): 

?? = ?? ???????                                                                                                                                (2) 

where y is the residual hydrocarbon content in soil (mg/kg), a is the initial hydrocarbon 

content in soil (mg/kg), k is the biodegradation rate constant (day-1) and t is time (days). The 

biodegradation rate constant (k), and half-life ln(2)/k of the hydrocarbons in soil during the 

bioremediation process were calculated from the model using Statistical ® software (Stat 

Soft. Inc. (2007). The model was used to estimate the rate of biodegradation and half-life of 

hydrocarbons in soil under each treatment and the model was based on the assumption that the 

degradation rate of hydrocarbons positively correlated with the hydrocarbon pool size in the 

soil.

2.7. Statistical Analysis. Statistical analysis of data was carried out using analysis of 

variance. Means of different treatments were also compared statistically using a General 

Linear Model (ANOVA) (Tukey test, p &gt;0.05) using statistical 8.0 software (Stat Soft, 2007). 

 
 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
3.1. Microbial Counts. The aerobic heterotrophic bacterial (AHB) counts in T1 ranged 

between 1.01 x 108 and 2.4 x 109 CFU/g while T2 and T3 ranged from 1.03 x 108 to 1.7 x 109 

and 1.0 x 108 to 3.8 x 108 CFU/g respectively (Fig. 3) in all the three soil types. The treatment 

T4 had AHB count ranging between 1.27 x 103 and 6.03 x 105 CFU/g. Hydrocarbon 

Degrading Bacterial (HDB) counts were also higher in oil contaminated soil in T1, T2 and T3 

(Fig. 4). The count of HDB in soil amended with T1 was about 2% higher than those amended 

with T2 and T3. HDB count in soil amended with T1 ranged from 3.6 x 106 to 3.3 x 108 

CFU/g, while those amended with T2 and T3 ranged from 3.7 x 106 to 2.6 x 108 and 3.5 x 106 

to 5.41 x 107CFU/g, respectively. However, the HDB counts in T4 were 1.07 x 103 to 7.07 x 

104 CFU/g lower than T1, T2 and T3. The counts of HDB in soils T1, T2 and T3 were higher 

compared to that of T4. These results were similar to that obtained by Antai and Mgbomo 

(1989) whose counts of HDB in hydrocarbon-contaminated soil was 108 CFU/g, but higher 

than that of Ghazali et al. (2004), who obtained 107CFU/g; from hydrocarbons degradation in 

diesel oil polluted soil. The discrepancies in the results may be due to the characteristics and 

the ecology of the different soil types used for the experiments. The microbial counts of the 

soils S1 and S2 showed the same pattern. Counts in soils amended with T1 gave highest 

followed by T2 and T3. Whereas, microbial counts in soil S3 showed different pattern 

compared with S1 and S2, as T2 gave highest counts compared with T1 and T3. Treatment T4 

has the least results in all the soils used for the experiment. This result clearly demonstrates 

the benefit of bioaugmentation, biostimulation and indigenous microorganisms of used 

lubricating oil polluted soil. An enhanced comparison between the four treatments 

investigated in this work is revealed in figure 3 and 4. Treatment T4 is a control system where 

most of the indigenous bacteria were killed with a biocide (NaN3).

3.2. Used engine oil hydrocarbon biodegradation. There was a noticeable reduction 

in the total petroleum hydrocarbon within the first 15 days in all the treatments, but higher 

reduction was observed at 30 days compared to the control (T4). At the end of the 30 days, 

there was 49, 69 and 73 % TPH reduction in T3, T1 and T2 respectively, that is, 7,306; 

10,278 and 10,881 mg/ kg. TPH reduction was observed in these treatments compared to 27 

% (3,991 mg/ kg) TPH reduction in the control soil S1. The same trend was noticed in soils 

S2 and S3 with T2 (NPK) having the highest TPH reduction (Fig. 5). Because, feeding 

nutrient solutions containing inorganic substances, such as nitrogen and phosphorus to natural 

soil bacteria often enhances the ability of the microorganisms to degrade organic molecules 

into carbon dioxide and water (Stotzky and Norman, 1961a; 1961b). During this period, the 

added bacteria product acclimatized to their new source of carbon. At the end of 90 days 

experiment, oil-contaminated soil amended with T1 (Soil + Oil + Amnite P1300) showed the 

highest reduction in concentration of used engine oil (89%), followed closely by soil amended 

with T2 (Soil + Oil + NPK) (78%), but no significant differences were observed between the 

treatments T1 and T2. The results obtained in soil type S3 is lower compared to that of S1 and 

S2, this may be due to clay contents in these soils which have been shown to offer greater 

capacity for physicochemical attenuation of contaminants than coarse sands (Pye and Patrick, 

1983). However, highest percentage (68%) of TPH reduction was observed in soil amended 

with T2 in soil S3 at the end of 90 days experiments. The net percentage loss of used oil in the 

contaminated soils could indicate the effectiveness of each treatment. The highest net 

percentage loss was observed at 30 days in T2 (45.93%), (40.33%) and (32.58%) followed by 

that of T1 (41.91%), (36.36%) and (28.83%) and T3 (22.10%), (22.10%) and (10.32%) in 

soils S1, S2 and S3, respectively (Table 3). However, the net percentage loss of used oil 

increased from45 days in T1 to the end of the 90 day experiment compared with other 

treatments.

of 0.0283, 0.0236 and 0.0133 day-1 and half-lives 24.49, 29.37 and 52.12 days were 

recorded in T1 in soil types S1 and S2 and T2 in soil S3, respectively. The control T4

76.17, 82.52 and 101.93 in soils S1, S2 and S3 respectively. The biodegradation rate of used 

oil in T1 showed the best result for the kinetic parameters in this study, as a result of the 

added bacterial products, followed by T2 and T3, and this may be due to the bioavailability 

of the inorganic nutrients to the indigenous bacterial present in the soils (Table 4).

4. CONCLUSIONS 

 

Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria counts were higher in the amended soils with 

treatments T1, T2, and T3 ranging from 3.47 × 106 to 3.27 × 108 CFU/g compared to T4 

throughout the 90 days of study. Oil-contaminated soil in T1 showed the highest reduction in 

total petroleum hydrocarbon with net loss of 36.17 % throughout the 90 days of the 

experiment compared to other treatments. The development of the microbial community and 

its recovery is a useful and sensitive way of monitoring the impact and recovery of used 

lubricating oil-contaminated soils. Commercially available microbial-based bioremediation 

products showed to be promising in the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons in contaminated 

clayey soil. 

Kinetic model of biodegradation showed the highest biodegradation rate of 0.0283 

day-1 and least half life of 24.49 days in oil contaminated soil with highest clayey and soil 

organic matter contents. This reveals the influence of organic matter and its biological roles in 

the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons contaminated soils. 

Remediation of hydrocarbons contaminated soil is necessary in order to have a safe 

and healthy environment that will in turn result in healthy lifestyle across the globe. 

Biological remediation of hydrocarbon and metal contaminated soil offers a better and more 

environmentally friendly technique that if properly and thoroughly explored can bring our 

environment into a better place for both plant and animal well-being due to its enormous 

advantages over other treatment methods. However, despite these enormous advantages of 

biological treatment method, its potential is yet to be fully utilized in restoration of 

contaminated soil. This is possibly due to the fact that it takes a long period of time for the 

complete restoration of the environment; this limitation can however be overcome through 

nutrient addition and introduction of microbes with biodegradative capability to degrade 

hydrocarbons.

EFFICACY OF MICROBIAL CONSORTIUM IN THE BIODEGRADATION 
OF USED LUBRICATING OIL CONTAMINATED SOILS OF BRAZIL 

ABSTRACT 
 

Experiments were conducted to examine the efficacy of microbial consortium (Amnite 
p1300) on simulated used lubricating oil contaminated soils of Brazil under laboratory 
condition for a period of 90 days. The effect of other treatments conditions were also 
investigated on the microbial survival and used lubricating oil degradation. Artificially 
contaminated soil types (clayey S1 and sandy S2) at a loading rate of 30000 and 45000 mg/kg 
in a 300 g model with used lubricating oil that was amended with commercially available 
hydrocarbon degrading microbial consortium: Amnite p1300 as the bioaugmentation (T1). 
The effects of other treatments: nutrient amendments - (NH4)2SO4 and K2HPO4 (NPK) as 
biostimulation treatment (T2), unammended soil - natural attenuation as (T3) and the control 
soil treated with sodium azide (NaN3) as (T4) on the microbial community and the 
degradation of used engine oil was also investigated.  The evaluation of soil biological 
activities as a monitoring tool for the degradation process of the model soils was made via 
measurements of hydrocarbons degrading bacterial counts (HDB), soil respiration (CO2) and 
pH. The correlations between these parameters and the levels of the hydrocarbon residues 
were determined. The residual hydrocarbon content correlated negatively with hydrocarbon 
utilizers, CO2 evolution and pH in both soils, and the two levels of pollution. At the end of the 
90-day experiments, the highest percentage of oil biodegradation (82 and 64 %) was recorded 
in soils S1 and S2, respectively, contaminated with 30000 mg/kg used lubricating oil that was 
amended with Amnite p1300, while only (68 and 62 %) of oil biodegradation was recorded in 
soil S1 and S2, respectively contaminated with 45000 mg/kg used lubricating oil amended with 
Amnite p1300. The results revealed remediation potential of Amnite p1300 to degrade heavy 
hydrocarbons such as used lubricating oil. It is concluded that contamination of soil with oil 
hydrocarbons has a negative effect on soil ecosystems, and the extent and duration of these 
effects will depend on the soil characteristics. Thus, inhibitory effect of used lubricating oil is 
more pronounced in sandy soil than in clayey soil and show more toxic effect on seed 
germination and root growth. This study has also showed that soil microbiological parameters 
may be useful tools for assessing the effect of hydrocarbon contamination on soil and 
environmental health.  
 

Key words: Bioremediation, biodegradation, used lubricating oil, petroleum

EFICÁCIA DO CONSÓRCIO MICROBIANO NA BIODEGRADAÇÃO DE ÓLEO 
LUBRIFICANTES USADOS  EM SOLOS CONTAMINADOS DO BRASIL 

 
RESUMO 
 
O experimento foi realizado com o intuito de avaliar a eficiência de consórcio 

microbiano (Amnite p1300) na degradação de hidrocarbonetos. Uma simulação usando 
solos contaminados com óleo lubrificante foi realizada em condições laboratoriais por 
período de 90 dias. O efeito de outros tratamentos também foi investigado através da 
sobrevivência microbiana e degradação do óleo lubrificante.  Os solos (Argiloso S1 e 
Arenoso S2) foram contaminados artificialmente a uma taxa de 30000 e 45000 mg/kg em 
300g de solo contaminado com óleo lubrificante usado, onde foram adicionados 
microorganismos de uso comercial que degradam hidrocarbonetos: Amnite P1300 como 
bioaumento (T1). Os efeitos de outros tratamentos: adição de nutrientes - (NH4)2SO4 e 
K2HPO4 (NPK) como tratamento de bioestimulação (T2), atenuação natural (T3) e solo 
tratado com azida de sódio (NaN3) como controle (T4) sobre a comunidade microbiana e a 
degradação do óleo de motor usado também foram investigados. A avaliação da atividade 
biológica do solo como instrumento de acompanhamento do processo de degradação dos 
solos foi realizada pela contagem das bactérias que degradam hidrocarbonetos, respiração 
do solo (evolução de CO2) e pH. A correlação entre esses parâmetros e os níveis de resíduos 
de hidrocarbonetos foi determinada. O conteúdo residual de hidrocarbonetos correlacionou-
se negativamente com os hidrocarbonetos utilizados, evolução de CO2  e pH em ambos os 
solos, e nos dois níveis de poluição avaliados. Ao final dos 90 dias do experimento, 
elevadas taxas de biodegradação do óleo (82 e 64%) foram observadas, respectivamente, 
nos solos S1 e S2 contaminados com 30000 mg/kg de óleo lubrificante usado e tratados com 
Amnite p1300. Entretanto, apenas 68 e 62% de biodegradação do óleo foi observado 
respectivamente nos solos S1 e S2 contaminados com 45000 mg/Kg de óleo lubrificante 
usado e tratados com Amnite P1300. Os resultados revelaram o potencial de remediação de 
Amnite p1300 na degradação de hidrocarbonetos de cadeia longa como o óleo lubrificante 
utilizado neste trabalho. Concluímos que a contaminação de solos com hidrocarboneto de 
óleo usado tem efeito negativo nos ecossistemas, e a extensão e duração efeitos dependem 
da natureza dos hidrocarbonetos contaminantes e das características do solo. Entretanto, o 
efeito inibitório do óleo lubrificante usado é mais pronunciado em solos arenoso que 
argiloso, demostrando efeito tóxico na germinação de sementes e crescimento de raízes. 
Este estudo também mostrou que os parâmetros microbiológicos do solo podem ser 
ferramentas úteis na avaliação dos efeito da contaminação de solos por hidrocarbonetos e 
sobre a saúde ambiental.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 

The rise in consumption of automotive lubricating oil is a worldwide problem and 

has increased, ending in large used oil volume and its waste. In most of the developing 

countries, the problems tend to worsen with economic and population growth, rapid 

industrialization, and disregard for environmental health, particularly in relation to used 

motor oil. The main component of the base oil is cyclic alkanes (c-alkanes). Long chain 

hydrocarbon and c-alkanes are known to be recalcitrant to microbial degradation. The base 

oil contains C16-C36 hydrocarbon, and more than 75% c-alkanes. The ring numbers of c-

alkanes in the base oil are from 1 to 3 and any ring contains 5 or 6 members. Most of the c-

alkanes in the base oil have long alkyl side chains (Koma et al., 2003). After a period of 

usage of lubricating oil to lubricate parts of an automobile engine, in order to smooth engine 

operation, metals and heavy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) get accumulated 

(Hagwell et al., 1992; Boonchan et al., 2000), and that would contribute to chronic hazard 

including mutagenicity and carcinogenicity (Butler and Mason, 1997). Prolonged exposure 

and high oil concentration may cause the development of liver or kidney disease, possible 

damage to the bone marrow and increased risk of cancer (Mishra et al., 2001). In addition, 

PAHs have a widespread occurrence in various ecosystems that contribute to the persistence 

of these compounds in the environment (Van Hamme et al., 2003). Damage derived from 

petroleum hydrocarbon contamination will depend on the type and concentration of the 

contaminant. It has generally been accepted that the susceptibility of hydrocarbons to 

microbial attack increases in the following order: cyclic alkanes &amp;lt;low-molecular weight 

aromatics &amp;lt;branched alkanes &amp;lt;n-alkanes  (Obbard et al., 2004). The toxicity of an organic 

pollutant will also depend on the soil characteristics, the higher the soil cation exchange 

capacity (high organic matter or clay content), the higher the adsorption of the organic 

pollutant and the lower its toxic effect on the ecosystem (McBride, 1994). 

Mechanical methods to reduce hydrocarbon pollution are expensive and time 

consuming. The cheap, effective and safe method for reducing hydrocarbon pollution could 

possibly be done through microbial degradation. Biodegradation of complex hydrocarbon 

usually requires the cooperation of more than a single bacterial species. This is particularly 

true in pollutants that are made up of many different compounds such as petroleum 



 

42 

 

compounds and complete mineralization to CO2 and H2O is desired. Individual 

microorganisms can metabolize only a limited range of hydrocarbon substrates, so 

assemblages of mixed populations with overall broad enzymatic capacities are required to 

bring the rate and extent of petroleum biodegradation further. Microbes are the main 

degraders of petroleum hydrocarbons contaminated ecosystems (Leahy and Cowell, 1990). 

Bioremediation has become an alternative way of remediation of oil polluted sites, where 

the addition of specific microorganisms (bacteria, cyanobacteria, algae, fungi, protozoa) or 

enhancement of microorganisms already present can improve biodegradation efficiency in 

both in-situ or ex-situ procedures (Cookson, 1995). Activities of microorganisms are 

essential to nutrient cycling in soils, and any effect which pollution has on soil 

microorganisms will also affect vegetation development, ecosystem functioning and 

productivity (Bauer et al., 1991; Ladd et al., 1996). Soil microorganisms are very sensitive 

to any ecosystem perturbation, since their diversity and activity are rapidly altered by such 

perturbation (Schloter et al., 2003). The measurement of microbiological parameters, such 

as soil respiration, microbial biomass, provides information on the presence and activity of 

viable microorganisms as well as on the intensity, kind and duration of the effects of 

hydrocarbon pollution on soil metabolic activity; such measurements may serve as a good 

index of the impact of pollution on soil health (Brohon et al., 2001; Eibes et al., 2006). 

However, results on the effects of hydrocarbon pollution on microbial biomass and activity 

are not always coincident, probably due to the differences in chemical properties of the 

hydrocarbon used (Xu and Johnson, 1995). It is also true that contaminants may well serve 

as organic carbon sources, and an enrichment of oil-degrading microbial populations has 

been observed in most contaminated ecosystems (Margesin et al., 2000). A better 

understanding of the effect of hydrocarbon contaminants on plant and soil microorganisms 

may be of help in assessing the recovery potential of a soil. 

Concentration of petroleum hydrocarbon determines to a greater extent the rate of 

breakdown of the hydrocarbons from soil environment. High concentration of hydrocarbon 

inhibits microorganisms, and the concentration at which inhibition occurs varied with the 

compound. Report of (Ijah and Antai, 2003) showed high degradation of hydrocarbons in 

soil contaminated with 10% and 20% crude oil compared to those contaminated with 30 % 



 

43 

 

and 40 % crude oil which experienced partial degradation of hydrocarbons within a period 

of 12 months. Rahman et al., (2002) reported that percentage of degradation by mixed 

bacterial consortium decreased from 70 % to 52 %, as the concentration of crude oil 

increased from 2.5 % to 10 %. The work of Rambeloarisoa et al. (1984) also demonstrated 

that crude oil degradation was inversely proportional to the concentration of oil. High 

concentrations of hydrocarbons can be associated with heavy, undispersed oil slicks in 

water, causing inhibition of oil biodegradation due to oxygen limitation or through toxic 

effects exerted by volatile hydrocarbons on microorganisms. Contamination by oil is 

generally expected to reduce the biodiversity of the soil microbiota (Atlas et al. 1991). A 

probable explanation for this is that the addition of large amounts of hydrocarbons selects 

for a limited number of fast-growing hydrocarbon degraders, which are enriched in the 

(typically oligotrophic) soil environment under these conditions. However, there is a lack of 

information on how this may be modulated by differing complex environmental matrices, 

and in particular, how different soil types and contamination level may affect the 

development of hydrocarbon-degrading populations. Previous microcosm studies examining 

the effect of oil contamination on soil microbial communities have focused on a single soil 

type (e.g. Engelen et al., 1998; Macnaughton et al., 1999). Adeyemo et al., (2012) compared 

one level (1.5 % w/w) of hydrocarbon contamination in two clayey soils and a sandy soil. 

Wünsche et al., (1995) also investigated hydrocarbon contamination in two different soil 

types. However, as one was a historically contaminated refinery soil and one was a 

contaminated pristine arable soil, it was not possible to separate the effects of soil type and 

differing oil treatment. It has been shown that even a simple measure of microbial response 

to oil contamination, such as a toxicity bioassay, gives different responses in different soil 

types (Marwood et al. 1998), it is therefore very important to understand how different soil 

types and contamination of hydrocarbons affect the biodegradation of used lubricating oil. 

The objectives of this work were to investigate the potential use of commercial hydrocarbon 

degrading bacteria consortium for degrading heavy hydrocarbons in used lubricating oil, 

and to utilize the commercial bacterial for the possible enhancement of used lubricating oil 

biodegradation in two different soil types (one clayey and one sandy) differing in their clay 



 

44 

 

and organic matter content under laboratory conditions at different oil pollution (3.0 % w/w 

and 4.5 % w/w) concentrations. 

 

2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 

2.1. Soil sample. The soil sample used was collected from two locations in Minas 

Gerais, Brazil with no known history of petroleum product contamination. A single large 

core was collected for each soil type from the A horizon, not including the surface litter 

layer, kept in a hermetic bag and transported to the laboratory for analysis. The soil was 

sieved using a 5 mm diameter stainless sieve. The characteristics which were determined 

using standard techniques are as listed in Table 1. Used lubricating oil was collected from a 

gasoline and car service station in close proximity to the Federal University of Viçosa, 

Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Amnite p1300 special microbial consortium specially made to 

degrade used motor oil were obtained from Cleveland Biotech Ltd., UK.

2.2. Soil analysis. Table 1 shows the origin and selected physical and chemical 

characteristics of the noncontaminated soil samples used for the bioremediation studies. 

Nitrogen content of the soil was determined by using Kjeldahl method, the available 

phosphorus was analysed by colometry after Mehlich 1 extraction and Organic Carbon 

content was determined using a modifield Walkley-Black (1934) method. The pH was 

determined using 1:2.5 ratio by weight with distilled water (w/v) after 30-min equilibration 

using a pH meter and electrode calibrated with pH 4.0 and 7.0 standards. Determinations were 

made in triplicate.  

 

2.3. Soil microcosms. The artificially contaminated model 300 g of soils were 

manually mixed with used lubricating oil at room temperature of (25 ± 1 oC) under laboratory 

conditions.  The soil was spread evenly and thinly in a large glass dish; the oil was added at a 

level of 30000 mg/kg and 45000 mg/kg dry weight of soil (3 % and 4.5 % w/w) respectively, 

poured evenly over the surface, and then mixed with a stainless steel spatula for 5 min before 

transferring to the microcosm (one litre (1L) glass flasks sealed with teflon-lined rubber 

stoppers). Since it is common for authentically-contaminated soils to have similar or higher 

oil concentrations (e.g. Saterbak et al. 1999), the concentrations of the added oil was similar 

to earlier microcosm studies (e.g. Wünsche et al. 1995). The microcosms were used to 

simulate the comparative effect of spent oil addition and bioremediation using a commercially 

available hydrocarbon degrading microbial consortium (Amnite p1300), special microbial 

consortium consisting of a mixture of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas 

putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Rhodococcus rhodocrous 

on a cereal (bran) as the bioaugmentation treatment. The microorganisms were conditioned to 

degrade heavy hydrocarbons. The concentration of microbial population in Amnite p1300 was 

approximately 5 x 108 cfu/g of bran. In addition to bioaugmentation using microbial 

consortium, the polluted soils were amended with ((NH4)2SO4 and K2HPO4) as biostimulation 

treatments. The C:N:P ratio of the nutrient compound was adjusted to 100:7.5:1 (optimum 

conditions), similar conditions provided in the biostimulation treatment were adopted in the 

bioaugmentation treatments plus the addition of Amnite p1300. The unammended soil 

without addition of nutrients and bacterial inoculums (natural attenuation), was included to 

indicate hydrocarbon degradation capability of microorganisms naturally present in the 



 

46 

 

contaminated soils (i.e. the autochthonous microbes). There was a control soil in which most 

of the indigenous bacteria were killed by the addition of biocide sodium azide (NaN3) (0.3% 

w/w) to inhibit soil microorganisms and to monitor abiotic hydrocarbon losses on the 

microbial community in two different soil types. There were six sampling dates; hence 48 

microcosms in total were used. Microcosms were arranged in a random order, and rearranged 

every 2 weeks ± 2 days throughout the duration of the experiment. The treatments were set up 

in triplicate, while the content of each container was tilled every week for aeration, and the 

moisture content was maintained at 70 % water holding capacity by the addition of sterile 

distilled water every week throughout the period of the experiment (90 days) (Pramer and 

Bartha, 1972).   

2.4. Gravimetric measurement of used lubricating oil loss in soil. The extents of 

used lubricating oil biodegradation in soil were also determined gravimetrically after 

microwave extraction according to the EPA method 3546 (US EPA, 2007) using the 

Microwave Automated Reaction System from CEM (Matthews, NC). Briefly, Sodium sulfate 

(Na2SO4) was purified by drying overnight in an oven at 150°C and quickly transferred into a 

desiccators. Five grams (5 g) of homogenised contaminated soil was weighed out, mixed with 

5 g dry anhydrous Na2SO4 and ground to less than 1 mm particle sizes, extracted in 

GreenChem vessels with 25 mL of a 1:1 hexane:acetone mixture according to manufacturer’s 

protocol at 100 °C for 20 minutes.  The n-hexane and acetone was filtered through whatman 

No 1 filter paper to separate the extract from the soil particles, and transferred into 100 mL 

amber vials through separatory funnel and sequentially rinsed with equal volume of solvent 

mixture. The solvent – oil mixture was later transferred into 100 mL Florentine flask of 

known weight, the solvent was evaporated into a partial dryness using rotary evaporator 

(Fizatom Rotavapor 801), and later completely using nitrogen gas. The new weight of the 

flask (now containing residual oil) was recorded. Percentage biodegradation of used 

lubricating oil was calculated using the formula of Ijah and Ukpe (1992):  

 

% ???????????????????????????? = ????????? ??? ????  ??????  
(?????????????? )? ???????? ??? ????  ??????  (???????????????? )
???????? ??? ????  ??????  (?????????????? )

2.5. Determination of petroleum hydrocarbons in soils. Total Petroleum 

Hydrocarbons (TPHs) were extracted according to EPA method 3546 (US EPA, 2007) using 

the Microwave Automated Reaction System from CEM (Matthews, NC). Briefly, sodium 

sulfate (Na2SO4) was purified by drying overnight in an oven at 150°C and quickly 

transferred into a desiccators. Five grams (5 g) of homogenized contaminated soil was 

weighed out, mixed with 5 g dry anhydrous Na2SO4 and ground to less than 1 mm particle 

sizes and extracted in a 25 mL GreenChem vessels containing 1:1 hexane : acetone mixture 

according to manufacturer’s protocol, and were kept at 100 °C for 20 minutes.  The n-hexane 

and acetone mixture was filtered through whatman No 1 filter paper to separate the extract 

from the soil particles, and transferred into 100 mL amber vials through separatory funnel 

which was sequentially rinsed with equal volume of solvent mixture. The solvent were 

evaporated to partial dryness with a rotary evaporator (Fizatom Rotavapor 801), transferred 

into 2 mL vials and then dried completely using nitrogen gas. Dried samples were dissolved 

in 600 µL dichloromethane for gas chromatography analysis. The residual oil was analyzed 

on Shimadzu GC-17A chromatograph equipped with a Flame-Ionization Detector (FID) by 

using fused silica capillary column DB-5 (30 x 0.25 mm), and AOC-17 Shimadzu auto 

injector complying with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard method 8015 (US 

EPA 2007). The flow rate of the helium carrier gas was 1.81 mL/min with linear velocity of 

38.49 cm/s. The initial temperature was programmed at 40oC and held for 15 min. The 

temperature was then increased to 280oC at a rate of 10oC /min. The final temperature was 

held for 31 min. The injector was set in the split mode. The split ratio was set to 1:10; the 

injection volume was 1 µL and the injector and the detector temperature for GC were 

maintained at 260 and 280°C respectively and the oven temperature was programmed to rise 

from 40 to 280°C in 10°C/min increments and to hold at 280°C for 31 min. The dry weight of 

the soil samples was determined following baking of 10 g of wet soil at &gt; 80 °C for at least 48 

hours. Before analyzing the sample extract, a mixture of standards including n-alkanes (n-

decane n-C10, n-dodecane n-C12, n-tetradecane n-C14, n-hexadecane n-C16, n-octadecane n-

C18, n-eicosane n-C20, n-docosane n-C22, n-tetracosane n-C24, n-hexacosane n-C26, n-

octacosane n-C28 and a pure standards containing n-triacontane n-C30, n-dotriacontane n-C32, n-
tetratriacontane n-C34, and n-hexatriacontane n-C36, and a mixture of polycyclic aromatic 

hydrocarbon consisting of acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, benzo (a) anthracene, benzo (a) 



 

48 

 

pyrene, benzo (b) fluoranthene, benzo (g, h, i) perylene, benzo (k) fluoranthene, chrysene, dibenz (a, 

h) anthracene, fluoranthene,fluorine, indeno (1, 2, 3-cd) pyrene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, 1-

methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene, Supelco) were used for calibration. Five points 

calibration curves using peak areas were obtained and the response factors were used to determine the 

concentrations of various hydrocarbons in the sample extract. The total petroleum hydrocarbons 

were identified and quantified by comparing the peak area of samples with that of the 

standard of the TPH mixture with reference to the curve derived from standards. Percentage 

of degradation was calculated by the following expression:  

% ???????????????????????????? = ??????? ??????????????  – ?????? ??????????????????
?????? ??????????????

? × 100                                             (2)          
 
TPH data were fitted to the first-order kinetics model (Yeung et al., 1997): 
 
 ?? = ??0 ??(?????)                                                                                                                            (3) 
 

Where H is the residual hydrocarbon content in soil (mg/kg), H0 is the initial hydrocarbon 

content in soil (mg/kg), k is the biodegradation rate constant (day-1) and t is time (days). This 

model was based on the assumption that the degradation rate of hydrocarbons positively 

correlated with the hydrocarbon pool size in soil.  The model was used to estimate the rate of 

biodegradation and half-life of hydrocarbons in soil under each treatment. The biodegradation 

rate constant (k), and half-life ln(2)/k of the hydrocarbons in soil during the bioremediation 

process were calculated from the model using Statistical ® software (Stat Soft. Inc. (2007).  

 

2.6. Enumeration of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria. The study was conducted at 

room temperature and the enumeration was carried out at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 days. To 

monitor cell numbers and biodegradation, 1 g of soil was removed from each microcosm at 

the set times and suspended in 9 mL of saline solution in sterile centrifuge tubes. The mixture 

was vigorously shaken on a vortex mixer for 3 minutes and then the soil particulates were 

allowed to settle for 1 min before 0.1 mL of the supernatant fluids were sampled for CFU 

counts. The number of colony-forming hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (HDB) was done by 

plating three replicate samples from each treatment withdrawn every 15 days on a mineral 

medium containing used motor oil as the sole carbon source. The mineral medium contained 

1.8 g K2HPO4, 4.0 g NH4Cl, 0.2 g MgSO4.7H2O, 1.2 g KH2PO4, 0.01 g FeSO4.7H2O, 0.1 g 



 

49 

 

NaCl, 20 g agar, one percent (1%) used engine oil in 1,000 mL distilled water, and the 

medium was adjusted to  pH 7.4 (Zajic and Supplission, 1972). The oil agar plates were 

incubated at 30°C for 7 days before the colonies were counted.  

2.7. Soil respiration. Amended-moist soil corresponding to a 300 g dry soil with 

water holding capacity (WHC) of approximately 70 % was incubated in triplicate at (25 ± 1 
0C) under laboratory conditions, in one Litre (1L) glass flasks sealed with teflon-lined rubber 

stoppers. Microbial activity was monitored by analyzing CO2 accumulation in the headspace 

by gas chromatography. Headspace samples of 1 cm3 were taken from microcosms with a 

Hamilton gastight® syringe and injected into a Gas Chromatograph Model GC- 14B 

(Shimadzu Crop Kyoto Japan ), with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD ) at temperature of 

150 ° C, injector at 100 º C and Porapak -Q column at 50 º C, using nitrogen as a carrier gas. 

Respiration rate was expressed as evolved CO2 in mL CO2 m-2 h-1, and the accumulated CO2 

concentration in mg CO2/ kg of dried soil. The amount of CO2 evolved during the 

mineralization of used lubricating oil was monitored using the accumulated concentration of 

CO2 recorded from the CG-TCD. Microcosms were aerated for 15 min after CO2 

measurement to maintain oxygen levels in the system. Microcosms were set up in triplicate in 

tightly closed glass flasks. To determine metabolic activity in each microcosm, respiration 

through CO2 emission monitoring were periodically performed. Each 1-L glass flask 

contained 300 g moist soils to which used lubricating oil was added. The respiration mean of 

the blanks was subtracted from the treated microcosms, and the difference in CO2 production 

between the blanks and the treated microcosms was used as the amount of CO2 produced. 

Analysis of released CO2 was done in triplicate, and data were subjected to statistical analysis 

using general linear model of analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significant treatment means 

were compared using Tukey test at P &gt; 0.05 (Statistical Software 8.0: Stat. Soft, 2007), to 

determine the significance of differences between microcosms. 

 

2.8. Germination toxicity test for the remediated soil. Toxicity of the remediated 

soils was assessed by germination tests using wheat seeds. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) was 

used in this study owing to its sensitivity to hydrocarbon in soil (Banks and Schultz, 2005). 

The germination test was conducted over a 7-day test period. Seeds of wheat were obtained 



 

50 

 

commercially. For each soil sample, 150 g of thoroughly mixed remediated soil was placed in 

110 × 110 x 35 mm germination box.  Twenty viable seeds of wheat were added and evenly 

spread into each germination box. Three replicates of the samples were prepared. The 

moisture of the soil (each soil) was maintained at 80 % water holding capacity. Germination 

boxes were incubated for 7 days in a plant test chamber with photoperiod of 16 h light and 8 h 

dark at 20 oC. At the end of the test, the number of germinated seeds was counted, recorded 

and compared with the control. Germination index of wheat seed on the remediated soil was 

calculated using the formula of Millioli et al., (2009):  

 

?????????????????????? ?????????? (%) = (% ????)  ×  (% ????)/100                                              (4) 

 
% ???? = ? % ???? % ????? ? ×  100                                                                                               (5)  
 
%???? = ????????? ??????????? ? × 100                                                                                            (6)  
where % SG = seed germination,  

% EG = germination on contaminated soil,  

% CG = germination on control soil,  

% GR = growth of the root,  

GERm = elongation of root on contaminated soil,  

GERCm = elongation of root on control soil. 

 
2.9. Statistical data analysis. Data collected were subjected to statistical analysis 

using general linear model of analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significant treatment means 

were compared using Tukey test at P &gt; 0.05 (Statistical Software 8.0: Stat. Soft, 2007).  

 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 

3.1. Biodegradation of used lubricating oil. Following a better biodegradation extent 

in our earlier studies using only one contamination level in three types of soils (Adeyemo et 

al., 2012), the biodegradation of used lubricating oil was studied using Aminte p1300, a 

commercial bacterial consortium, was investigated. Trends in the biodegradation percentage 

in the soil contaminated with 3.0% and 4.5% used lubricating oil are shown in Fig.1

The results showed the highest biodegradation percentage (84% and 64%) in soil 1 (S1) and 

soil 2 (S2), respectively, contaminated with 3.0% of the used lubricating oil amended with 

Amnite p1300 (T1) compared to (65% and 52%) in T2; (49% and 33%) in T3 and (10% and 

7%) in T4 at the end of 90-day experiment. A higher degradation percentage observed in S1 

compared to S2 in this study might be due to the higher clay contents of S1. Soils of high clay 

contents have been shown to offer greater capacity for physicochemical attenuation of 

contaminants than coarse sands (Pye and Patrick, 1983). The low percentage of contamination 

with (3.0%) used lubricating oil might be the reason for the relatively high and progressive 

biodegradation in the soil, because it does not pose a serious challenge to the metabolic 

activities of soil microorganisms. It may also be due to the mixed bacterial consortium that is 

present in T1 that combine individual’s effect of the bacterial strains for better degradation 

(Rahman et al., 2002; Ghazali et al., 2004). With the increase in the concentration of the 

contaminated soils (4.5%), lower percentage of degradation (71% and 62 %) was observed in 

S1 and S2, respectively, in T1 compared to the previous level of contamination (3.0%). Similar 

trends were recorded in soil contaminated with 4.5% in T2, T3 and T4 (53% and 45%), (35% 

and 24%) and (6% and 5%) respectively. This may be attributed to the toxicity of the oil on 

the microbial flora of the soil and thus the high concentration of oil which might likely had 

negative effects on the biodegradative activities of the microbial population in the 

contaminated soil. (Adesodun and Mbagwu, 2008). Higher degradation was observed in our 

previous work (Adeyemo et al., 2012) with reduced concentration of the used motor oil in soil 

following application of microbial consortium (Amnite p1300) with the same treatment. The 

result is in agreement with the findings of Rahman et al., (2002) who reported decrease in the 

rate of biodegradation of crude oil, as the concentration of oil increased.  

 

The results of this present study show that highest biodegradation rates were recorded 

in soil contaminated with 3% oil compared with 4.5%. This high biodegradation rate could be 

attributed to increase in the activity of soil microbes in the oil polluted soils (Adesodun and 

Mbagwu, 2008). Amnite p1300 (T1) amended soil recorded highest percentage 

biodegradation (84% and 64%) in 3% oil-contamination and (71% and 62 %) in 4.5% oil 

contamination in S1 and S2, respectively, throughout the 90-day period, compared to the 

poisoned control soil treated with sodium azide which recorded 10% and 7% in 3% oil-



 

53 

 

contamination and (6% and 5%) in 4.5% oil contamination in S1 and S2, respectively. This 

might be due to the combined effect of hydrocarbon-utilizing microbial consortium present in 

the T1. The vendor (Cleveland Biotech, UK) of the microbial consortium claimed that the 

consortium (Amnite p1300) had been conditioned to carry out effective and efficient 

biodegradative activities of heavy petroleum hydrocarbons.  Some removal of hydrocarbons 

was also seen in the soil which was not amended with commercial bacterial consortium. This 

removal could be attributed to the combined actions of indigenous microbial population 

stimulated by the addition of nutrients to the polluted soil as well as abiotic weathering. 

Abiotic weathering processes in polluted soils include evaporation, photochemical oxidation, 

and adsorption onto particulate material. 

 

3.2. Biodegradation rate and coefficient of determination. The first-order 

degradation kinetics was reported in earlier studies based on petroleum hydrocarbon 

degradations (van Gestel et al., 2003; Namkoong et al., 2002; Jørgensen et al., 2000). First-

order kinetic model of Yeung et al. (1997) was adopted in this study to evaluate the 

biodegradation of used lubricating oil in all treatments (T1, T2, T3 and T4) as presented in 

Table 2. Biodegradation rate constant (k) of the hydrocarbons during the bioremediation 

process and coefficient of determination r² were calculated from the model. Data from three 

replicates in each treatment from the six sampling periods (two weeks interval) were 

combined for evaluation using this model. The coefficients of determination (r²) revealed that 

the model fits well to all the treatments. The highest biodegradation rates of 0.0201 and 

0.0160/day were recorded in soil contaminated with 3.0% amended with Amnite P1300 in S1 

and S2, respectively. In soil contaminated with 4.5%, the highest biodegradation rate of 

0.0122 and 0.0117/day were also recorded in the treatment amended with Aminte p1300 in S1 

and S2 respectively. Poisoned control amended with sodium azide recorded the lowest 

biodegradation rate of (0.0011 and 0.0010/day) in 3.0% and (0.0007 and 0.0007/day) in 4.5% 

oil contamination in S1 and S2 respectively. The results show significant relationships 

between the rate of biodegradation and concentration of oil in the contaminated soil. It is 

noticeable that biodegradation rate in 4.5% oil contamination were lower compared with 3.0% 

in both soils. This observation might be attributed to the toxicity of the oil on the microbial 

biota of the soil. High concentrations of the oil have negatively affected the biodegradative 



 

54 

 

activities of the microbial population in the contaminated soil. (Adesodun and Mbagwu, 

2008).

There were significant differences in the biodegradation rate in S1 and S2 

contaminated with 3.0%. Differences between the two soils S1 and S2, however, were not 

significant (P &amp;lt;0.05) with respect to the biogradation rate. As the oil contamination increased 

to 4.5%, the less efficiency of the commercial microbial consortium with heavy application of 

used lubricating oil could be attributed to reduction in the activity of the soil microbes at this 

level of pollution in both soils. Bossert and Bartha (1984) stated that sensitivity of soil micro 

biota to petroleum hydrocarbons is a factor of quantity and quality of oil spilled and previous 

exposure of the native soil microbes to oil. Although, La-Rue (1977) reported that most 

microbes can metabolized a wide range of c-compounds, Schwindinger (1968) stated that 



 

55 

 

beyond 3.0% concentration, oil becomes increasingly deleterious to soil biota and crop 

growth. Schaefer and Juliane (2007) also concluded that bioremediation is a useful method of 

soil remediation if pollutant concentrations are moderate.  

 

3.3. Enumeration of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria. The hydrocarbon degrading 

bacterial (HDB) counts in T1 contaminated with 3 % ranged from (4.5 x 106 to 2.8 x 108 

CFU/g) in S1 and (4 x 106 to 2.5 x 108 CFU/g) in S2. The hydrocarbon degrading bacterial 

counts was slightly higher in S1 than S2. A similar trend was recorded in soil contaminated 

with 4.5 % in T1, with lower microbial population ranging from (1.28 x 106 to 6.4 x 107 

CFU/g) in S1 and (1.08 x 106 to 5.7 x 107 CFU/g) in S2. The reason might be due to its clay 

contents through surface adsorption and microbial metabolism in this soil which has been 

shown to offer greater capacity for physicochemical attenuation of contaminants than coarse 

sands. (Pye and Patrick, 1983). The high clay soil may also contain active organisms whose 

metabolism results in contaminant attenuation than coarse sands. The low percentage of 

contamination with (3.0 %) used lubricating oil might be the reason for the relatively high and 

progressive biodegradation in the soil. The low percentage oil contamination appeared not to 

pose serious challenge to the metabolic activities of soil microorganisms. The population of 

hydrocarbons degrading microbial counts were highest in T1 followed by T2 and T3. Control 

T4 has the least counts in both soils used for the experiment. This result clearly demonstrates 

the benefit of bioaugmentation of oil polluted soil with Aminte p1300 products. An enhanced 

comparison between the four treatments investigated in this work is revealed in Fig. 2. In the 

control treatment (T4), most of the indigenous bacteria were killed with a biocide (NaN3). The 

number of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms increased with time both at the 

contamination levels and the two soils. Already after 15 days, the counts of degrading 

bacterial consortium on used lubricating oil hydrocarbon showed that soil microorganisms 

adapted rapidly to the hydrocarbon contamination and were able to utilize the spent oil as 

carbon source (Fig. 2). The counts of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria (HDB) in both level of 

contamination (3.0% and 4.5%) in T2 were lower than T1, but, appreciably higher compared 

to T3 and T4. The reason for higher counts of bacteria in T2 soil might be as a result of 

presence of appreciable quantities of available nutrients added, which are necessary for 

bacterial biodegradative activities (Abdulsalam et al., 2011).

3.4. Soil respiration (CO2-evolution) analysis. The values of CO2 evolved during a 

90-day incubation experiment from soil samples at different times in 3.0 % and 4.5 % level of 

contamination are shown in Fig. 3 and 4 respectively. CO2 emissions were higher in the 

clayey soil than in the sandy soil both for the contaminated and the control treatments. This 

might be due to its higher nutrient contents and microbial metabolism in this clayey soil 

which has been shown to offer greater capacity for physicochemical attenuation of 

contaminants than coarse sands. (Pye and Patrick, 1983).  

The contaminants at the two loading rates (3 and 4.5 %) assayed, increased soil 

respiration in both soils, especially in the clayey soil. In the clayey soil, used lubricating oil 

contaminated soils showed that respiration in 3.0 % loading rates producing the greatest CO2 

emissions. The high amount of CO2 liberated in clayey soil amended with amnite products 

and contaminated with 3 % and 4.5 % used lubricating oil is an indication of high utilization 

of organic carbon nutrients from the petroleum hydrocarbons present in this sample. The 

exception to this trends was that respiration rate of the samples with higher contamination 

level of 4.5 % used lubricating oil was lower compared with the soils contaminated with 3 %. 

This may be due to reduced aeration caused by the very high hydrocarbon concentrations in 

the soils.  

The stimulatory effect of used lubricating oil on soil respiration persisted in both soils 

throughout the incubation period, and was still noticeable 90 days after contamination (Fig. 3 

and 4). The cumulative evolution of CO2 in the clayey soil (S1) at both level of contamination 

(3.0% and 4.5 %) in the amended treatments with amnite products (T1) were higher than 

treatments amended with nutrients (T2) in (3.0% and 4.5 %) level of contamination. The 

lower values recorded in both soils contaminated with 4.5 % might be due to the toxicity of 

the spent motor oil to the microorganisms present in the contaminated soils or reduced 

aeration caused by the very high hydrocarbon concentrations in the soils. Soil respiration (in 

terms of carbon dioxide - CO2-evolution) in T1 and T2 were significantly higher than in T3 

and T4. The CO2- evolution in T4 reached maximum values after 30 days, decreasing 

thereafter and remaining almost constant till the end of the 90- day experiment. Carbon 

dioxide (CO2) evolution in T4 indicates that the sodium azide

biocide used for this experiment was not 100% effective to inhibit the carbon 

oxidising bacterial metabolism during the experimental period. 

 

3.5. Toxicity and seed germination index. In both soils, the seed germination test 

was conducted using wheat sown on the oil polluted soils at both 3.0% and 4.5%. Wheat is an 

important agricultural crops, and its sensitivity to toxic chemicals (mostly petroleum 

contaminants), has led to its wide use for toxicity tests (Banks and Schultz, 2005). The trends 

in seed germination on the bacteria-remediated soils that was contaminated with 3.0% and 4.5 

% spent oil are shown in Table 3.  At the end of the 90-day experiment, the results revealed 

that 100 %, 80 % and 60 % germination were recorded in 3.0 % soil contamination and 90 %, 

60 % and 30 % were recorded in soil contaminated with 4.5 % oil in T1, T2 and T3, 

respectively, in Soil 1(S1). While 90 %, 70 % and 60 % germination were recorded in 3.0 % 

soil contamination, 70 %, 60 % and 20 % germination were recorded in soil contaminated 

with 4.5% oil in T1, T2 and T3, respectively, in Soil 2 (S2). Highest percent germination 

(100%) was recorded in uncontaminated control in both S1 and S2 at both levels of 

contamination, while only 30 % and 20 % in S1 and 20% and 10%) in S2 were recorded in 

poisoned control soils (T4) which were contaminated with 3.0% and 4.5% used lubricating 

oil, respectively. It is evidenced that the type of soil also influenced the phytotoxic effect, 

which was more persistent in the sandy soil. The toxicity of an organic pollutant will also 

depend on the soil characteristics. The higher the soil cation exchange capacity (high organic 

matter and/or clay content), the higher the adsorption of the organic pollutant and the lower its 

toxic effect on the ecosystem (McBride, 1994). In the clayey soil (S1), the inhibitory effect 

was not really pronounced, probably due to the degradation of some of the phytotoxic 

compounds contained in the hydrocarbons (the resulting metabolites being less phytotoxic). 

Sequestration and bound-residue formation could also have occurred during organic 

contaminant degradation in soil, because bound or nonextractable residues (NER) are formed. 

Part of these residues may be biogenic, because degrading microorganisms assimilate carbon 

derived from the pollutant and mineralized CO2 to form cellular components, for example, 

[fatty acids (FA) and amino acids (AA), which are subsequently stabilized within soil organic 

matter (SOM) (Scheunert et al., 1985; Karolina et al., 2011). In the sandy soil, the 

phytotoxicity was higher, perhaps due to a lower degree of hydrocarbon degradation as a

consequence of the low microbial biomass content and microbial activity of this soil. The 

Germination Index (GI) gives an idea of the effect of soil contamination on the seed 

germination and root growth. Germination index of wheat seed on the remediated soil was 

calculated using the formula of Millioli et al. (2009).  The soils contaminated with used 

lubricating oil had a stimulatory effect on the seeds germination at higher concentration of 

4.5% than 3.0%. Table 4 shows the results of seed germination index in soil contaminated 

with 3.0% and 4.5% used lubricating oil in all the treatments. Soil treated with Amnite p1300 

recorded the highest germination index, 93.33%, and 76.71% in S1 and 74.97 and 52.71% in 

S2, this result further proved the effectiveness of the commercial bacterial consortium in 

enhancing biodegradation of hydrocarbon in soil contaminated with used lubricating oil. The 



 

62 

 

negative effect of hydrocarbons on GI may be attributed to their inherent toxicity and/or to the 

perturbations they cause in soil and plants due to their hydrophobic properties (Ogboghodo et 

al., 2004). Hydrocarbons may coat roots, preventing or reducing gas and water exchange and 

nutrient absorption. They may also enter the seeds and alter the metabolic reactions and/or kill 

the embryo by direct, acute toxicity. After penetrating the plant tissues, hydrocarbons damage 

cell membranes and reduce the metabolic transport and respiration rate (Amadi et al., 1992; 

Xu and Johnson, 1995). Xu and Johnson (1995) indicated that the contaminant could have 

opposite effects on the plant and microorganism growth. These authors also indicated that the 

higher the concentration of unsaturated compounds, aromatic, and acids, the more toxic the 

hydrocarbons are to soil microorganisms. 
 
 
 

3.6. Correlations. The results of the regression and correlation analyses demonstrated 

that several of the investigated soil parameters correlated significantly with the residual soil 

hydrocarbon content in both soils S1 and S2  following contamination with 3.0% and 4.5% 

used lubricating oil during the 90-day period  of study (Table 5). Hydrocarbon content 

correlated strongly and negatively with soil pH, the number of hydrocarbon bacteria utilizers 

(P &amp;lt;0.001), soil respiration (CO2-evolution) and percentage oil degradation (P &amp;lt;0.01).  

There were also several significant correlations between other measured soil parameters 

(Table 5). The Soil pH correlated significantly and positively with hydrocarbon utilizers and 

soil respiration at both level of contamination in both soils.

3.6.1. Correlation between CO2 evolution and oil biodegradation. The 

relationships between oil biodegradation and concentration of CO2 evolved in soils 

contaminated with 3 %, and 4.5 % used lubricating oil in different treatments T1, T2, 

T3 and T4 are shown in Figures 7 to 10. The results of oil biodegradation in soil 

contaminated with used lubricating oil with 3 and 4.5 % in amended soil with 

hydrocarbon degrading bacterial consortium products, soil amended with nutrients and 

unamended soil show strong positive linear correlation with CO2 evolution, while that of 

control, where most of the available microorganisms have been killed with sodium 

azide, shows weak correlation in soil 1 (S1) at both level of pollution 3.0 and 4.5 %. 

Polluted soil without any amendments (T3) shows better correlation (r = 0.97 and 0.99) 

in both soils S1 and S2, respectively, than those amended with microbial consortium 

commercial products (Amnite p1300) and nutrient amended soil (T2) at 3.0% oil 

pollution. This might be due to unavailability of the organic compounds to the bacteria 

community as a result of the biodegradation that occurred in the amended soils. 

Commercial microbial consortium amended soil shows strong correlation of (0.96, 0.98) 

at 3 % and (0.98, 0.88) at 4.5 % in soils 1 and 2 respectively. This might be due to the 

ability of the microbial consortium products to degrade heavy hydrocarbons effectively. 

Nutrients amended soils (T2) also had a strong correlation of (0.90, 0.98) at 3 % and 

(0.98, 0.95) at 4.5 % in soils 1 and 2 respectively. Nutrients availability to the 

indigenous bacteria might contribute to their population increase and thereby increase 

degradation of the organic compound. The positive linear correlation between CO2 

evolution and oil biodegradation recorded in most of the treatments can be attributed to 

the increase in microbial activities in all the treatments which implies that most of the 

oil breakdown in the contaminated soil can be attributed to microbial degradation due to 

appreciable release of CO2 during the process of oil breakdown. These results agrees 

with the findings of several authors (Ijah and Antai, 2003b; Roling et al., 2004 and 

Morais and Tornisielo 2009), who reported positive linear correlation of oil 

biodegradation with high CO2 evolution in oil contaminated.

 3.7. Biodegradation of hydrocarbon fractions. Biodegradation of hydrocarbon 
fractions present in the used lubricating oil was determined at fifteen days interval for 
90 days using GC/FID. The hydrocarbon fractions were divided into three fractions 
which are: C10 – C14, C15 – C28 and C29 – C36 (Alberdi et al., 2001). 

 

3.7.1 Biodegradation of C10 – C14 fractions in used lubricating oil. Oil-contaminated 

soil with 3 % amended with commercial bacterial consortium (Amnite P1300) and 

Nutrients (NH4)2SO4 and K2HPO4 recorded complete biodegradation of C10 – C14 

hydrocarbon fractions below the detection limit within ninety days in the clayey soil 

(S1) compared to unamended and the control soil. In the sandy soil (S2) however, only 

the treatment with Amnite P1300 recorded complete degradation below the detection 

limit. There was no complete degradation of the fractions (C10 – C14) in nutrients 

amended, unamended and sterile contaminated soils throughout the ninety days 

periods. Soil contaminated with 4.5% used lubricating oil did not record any oil 

biodegradation below detection limit in all the treatments within the ninety days of the 

experiment, but there were appreciable degradation in the soils contaminated with the 

used lubricating oil amended with Amnite P1300, followed by nutrient amendment 

and unamended soils, the control soil had the least biodegradation throughout the 90 

days period (fig. 5). The sterile polluted soils at 90 days has residual C10 – C14 fractions 

of 437.43 and 747.00 mg/kg in clayey soil at 3.0 and 4.5 % level of pollution, and 464 

and 817 mg/kg in sandy soil at 3 and 4.5 % level of pollution. The rapid 

biodegradation of C10 – C14 fractions has been reported to be among the most rapidly 

biodegraded components of oil, although they are also susceptible to removal by 

extensive water washing. Empirically, the first sign of biodegradation are usually n-

alkane in the C10 to C13 range, which probably reflects an optimal carbon number with 

increasing enthalpy of reaction and decreasing water solubility as the alkane carbon 

number increases (Palmer, 1993; Masterson, et al., 2001). The results, like those of C10 

– C14 contaminated at 3.0 % revealed the effectiveness of Amnite P1300 to effect 

complete degradation of C10 – C14 fractions in this level of contamination in both soils.

This still pointed out its ability to degrade the short chain hydrocarbons fractions better 

than other treatments applied during the 90 days of the experimental period. The results 

is similar to that of Chang et al., (2010) who reported a substantial degradation of C10-

C16 hydrocarbon fraction in aged petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soil. 

 

3.7.2 Biodegradation of C15 – C28 fractions in used lubricating oil.  The results show 

that the hydrocarbon fractions C15 – C28 were not degraded below the detection limit in 

all the treatments within the experimental periods, however the degree of 

biodegradation varies greatly based on the percentage of oil pollution and the 

amendments. The reason for incomplete biodegradation of these hydrocarbon fractions 

below detection limit might be due to their complex structure, which always posed 

some significant difficulty to hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria in their complete 

biodegradation (Peters and Moldowan, 1993). In soil contaminated with 3.0 % oil in 

both soils, Amnite P1300 amended soil recorded highest biodegradation of C15 – C28 

hydrocarbon fractions from the initial concentration of (16245 and 16348 mg/kg) to 

(3154 and 3658 mg/kg) in clayey and sandy soil respectively after 90 days of the 

experimental study. Studies with soil contaminated with 4.5 % oil pollution also 

revealed that Amnite1300 amended soil has the best treatment where the oil fractions 

were reduced from the initial concentration of (22954 and 23254 mg/kg) to (9448 and 

10748 mg/kg) in clayey and sandy soil respectively after 90 days of the experimental 

study (fig. 6). The unamended contaminated and control soils recorded very low 

biodegradation of the C15 – C28 fractions throughout the 90 days period in both soils at 

different level of contamination with used lubricating oil. The increase in the 

biodegradation of C15 – C28 fractions in soil amended with Amnite P1300 might be due 

to the ability of the bacterial products conditioned to degrade heavy hydrocarbons.

3.7.3 Biodegradation of C29 – C36 fractions in used lubricating oil. The results of the 

study revealed that these fractions of petroleum hydrocarbons were not properly degraded 

in all the treatments. The incomplete degradation of these hydrocarbon fractions has been 

reported by different authors that they are not easily degraded by microorganisms in the 

soil because they are hydrophobic solids at physiological temperature (Alberdi et al., 

2001; George et al., 2002). In soil contaminated with 3 % used lubricating oil, soil 

amended with Amnite P1300 recorded reduction in C29 – C36 in the concentration from 

9441 and 9684 mg/kg to 4566 and 3981 mg/kg in clayey and sandy soil, respectively, 

after 90 days of the experimental study, whereas in the control contaminated soil, the 

biodegradation of the hydrocarbon fractions was minimal (reduction from 9321 and 9743 

mg/kg to 8816 and 9291 mg/kg in clayey and sandy soil, respectively, after 90 days of the 

experimental study (fig.7). The same pattern were also recorded in the 4.5 % 

contaminated level with the highest reduction recorded in the Aminte P1300 amended 

soil, though lower compare with the degradation recorded in the 3.0 % contaminated 

level in the hydrocarbon fractions C29 – C36. The reason for low biodegradation of these 

hydrocarbon fractions might also be attributed to the fact that during biodegradation of 

hydrocarbons in soil or sediments, low molecular weight fractions are known to be 

degraded first by microorganisms before degrading the higher molecular weight 

petroleum fractions (Coulon et al., 2004; Sanscartier et al., 2009). Therefore, in this study 

possibly the low molecular weight fractions were first degraded by indigenous 

microorganisms before the higher molecular weight, thus, accounting for the low 

biodegradation of the higher molecular fractions in the range of C29 to C36.

3.8. Biodegradation of PAHs in used lubricating oil. The results from this study 

demonstrate degradation of eight PAHs present in the used lubricating oils during the 

biodegradation studies, using a microbial consortium present in Amnite P1300 as an 

amendment, addition of nutrients, unmended and the control soil with sodium azide to 

degrade soils contaminated with used lubricating oil. These PAHs have been identified by US 

Environmental protection Agency (EPA) as priority pollutants.  Figure (8 to 11) show the 

results (concentration in mg/kg) of different residual PAHs present in the used lubricating oil 

in each treatment during the bioremediation studies. Pruell and Quinn (1988) detected sixteen 

PAHs with 2- to 6-rings in used lubricating oils. In other similar studies, twenty-five PAHs 

with 2- to 6-rings were recorded by Östman and Colmsjö (1989), and as many as eighty-four 

were reported by Grimmer et al. (1981) and Paschke et al. (1992). The following eight PAHs 

with 2- to 4-rings (Naphtalene (Nap), Acenaphthylene (Can), Acenaphthene (Anth), Fluorene 

(Flu), Phenanthrene (Phr), Anthracene (Ant), Fluoranthene (Flt ) and Pyrene (Pyr) were the 

main PAHs detected in our studies during the bioremediation experiment in soils 

contaminated with used lubricating oil. These contrasting results demonstrated the difficulty 

of detecting individual PAHs in used lubricating oils whose matrices become complex after 

high temperature combustion. 

The quantity and the composition of PAHs in the laboratory incubations were 

determined at the start of the experiment, and every 30 days thereafter till the end of the  

incubation. After 90 days of incubation, Naphthalene, Acenaphthylene and Acenaphthene 

were depleted in all the treatments and the abiotic control samples in both soils and 

contamination levels below the detection limit of 0.5 mg/kg, indicating abiotic removal, 

probably due to volatilization. It has been observed that PAHs resistance to oxidation, 

reduction, and vapourization increases with increasing molecular weight, whereas the aqueous 

solubility of these compounds decreases (Taylor and Jones, 2000). The results of 

biodegradation of different PAHs of higher molecular weights within the period of the study 

revealed the degradation of fluorene below the detection limit of 0.5 mg/kg in Amnite P1300 

(T1), Nutrients amended (T2) and unamended (T3), in both soils and contamination levels, 

whereas, limited degradation were recorded in the control soils (T4) in both contamination 

levels within the period of the experiment. Complete degradation of phenanthrene and 



 

72 

 

anthracene was only achieved in T1 and T2, while the two PAHs were not completely 

degraded in T3 and T4 in both soils and contamination levels.  

Complete degradation of fluoranthene and pyrene below the detection limit was also 

revealed in T1, the effect of the addition of the nutrients was negligible in the degradation of 

these two PAHs. However, it was clear that two – to four-ring aromatic compounds in the 

used lubricating oil had been substantially degraded in Amnite P1300 amended soils at both 

contamination levels, while other treatments did not record complete degradation of 

fluoranthene and pyrene after 90 days of the experimental study. The reason for complete 

degradation of PAHs recorded in soil amended with Amnite P1300 might be due to the soil 

texture improvement from possible increased in oxygen transfer as a result of the increase in 

the bacterial consortium present in the contaminated soil. Singh and Lin (2008) asserted that 

individual microorganisms can metabolize only a limited range of hydrocarbon substrates, so 

assemblages of mixed populations with overall broad enzymatic capacities are required to 

increase the rate and extent of PAHs biodegradation. Also, loss of PAHs recorded in the 

sterile polluted soil might be due to different processes such as volatilization, adsorption, 

photolysis or chemical degradation which are known to contribute to PAHs degradation in 

contaminated soil (Haritash and Kaushik, 2009).

4.  CONCLUSIONS 

 

The present study clearly showed efficiency of mixed microbial consortium in the 

degradation of used lubricating oil components. Hence we suggest the use of the mixed 

microbial consortium for bioremediation of used lubricating oil contaminated sites.  

The toxic effect of used lubricating oil is more pronounced in sandy soil than 

clayey soil. The influence of the soil characteristics on the toxic effects of hydrocarbons 

has also been revealed in this study, soils with a higher organic matter and clay content 

being less affected by this kind of contamination.  

Hydrocarbons degrading bacteria (HDB) counts were higher in clayey soil, at 

highest population of (2.8 x 108 CFU/g) at day 60, in 3.0% contamination level, though the 

population reduces as the contamination level increases. This study has also shown that 

soil microbiological parameters may be useful tools for assessing the effect of 

hydrocarbon contamination on soil wellbeing. 

The contaminants at the two loading rates (3 and 4.5%) assayed, increased soil 

respiration in both soils, especially in the clayey soil. The used lubricating oil contaminated 

clayey soils showed that respiration in 3.0 % loading rates producing the greatest CO2 

emissions. The higher amount of CO2 liberated in clayey soil amended with amnite products 

and contaminated with 3 % and 4.5 % used lubricating oil is an indication of high utilization 

of organic carbon nutrients from the petroleum hydrocarbons present in this sample.  

The bioaugmentation approach (Amnite P1300) gave the best result in this study as 

the concentration of the hydrocarbon contaminated soil increases and this can be used to 

develop a safe and economical full-scale treatment technology for soils contaminated with 

used lubricating oil. However, laboratory studies can produce overly optimistic results under 

controlled conditions, making it difficult to predict the performance of bioremediation 

strategies in the field where there is less control of environmental parameters and increased 

soil heterogeneity. An upgrade to field scale trials is therefore warranted to corroborate with 

the conclusions drawn from this study prior to undertaking field scale ventures. Also, the 

types of soil and hydrocarbon concentrations may determine the rate and extent of 

hydrocarbon remediation.

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 
 

 

The results of the experiments demonstrate that the microbial consortium product 

(Amnite P1300) utilised has achieved a substantial decrease in hydrocarbons content, as 

evidenced by monitoring the Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) in used lubricating oil, 

effecting an elimination of  approximately 89 % of the original content.  

Kinetic model of biodegradation showed the highest rate of 0.0283day-1 and least half 

life of 24.49 days in oil contaminated clayey soil. The biodegradation rate of used lubricating 

oil in clayey contaminated soil is therefore evident. Though, the biodegradation rate reduces 

as the concentration of the pollution increases, but this clearly points out that, clayey soil 

contaminated with used lubricating oil degraded faster than sandy soil when amended with 

microbial consortium.  

The correlations between the parameters investigated and the levels of the 

hydrocarbon residues were determined. The residual hydrocarbon content correlated 

negatively with percentage of hydrocarbon degradation, hydrocarbon utilizers, CO2 evolution 

and pH in all the soil types, and the levels of pollution.  

The influence of the soil characteristics on the toxic effects of hydrocarbons has also 

been revealed in this study, soils with a higher organic matter and clay content being less 

affected by this kind of contamination. Thus, inhibitory effect of used lubricating oil is more 

pronounced in sandy soil than in clayey soil and show more toxic effect on seed germination 

and root growth. The results of this study therefore, indicate that Amnite P1300 is an 

efficacious product facilitating the biodegradation and elimination of hydrocarbon compounds 

from used lubrication oil contamination in different soil types, but there is a recalcitrant 

fraction of the hydrocarbons that remain in soil after the evaluated time period. The shorter 

chain aliphatic hydrocarbons are more degraded than the longer chain aliphatic hydrocarbons 

in both soils.
