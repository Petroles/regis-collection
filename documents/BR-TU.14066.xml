nanocompósitos formados por polifosfatos de sódio e flúor associados à 

nanopartículas de prata. Estudo in vitro.[Tese]. Araçatuba: Universidade 

Estadual Paulista; 2018. 

 

 

RESUMO GERAL 

O objetivo deste estudo foi sintetizar e caracterizar nanocompósitos formados 

por polifosfatos (trimetafosfato de sódio (TMP) ou hexametafosfato de sódio 

(HMP)) e flúor (F) associados à nanopartículas de prata. Esses 

nanocompósitos foram avaliados quanto à sua ação anti-biofilme de Candida 

albicans (ATCC 10231) e Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 25175) e seu potencial 

em inibir a desmineralização do esmalte dentário por meio de ensaio in vitro de 

ciclagem de pH. As nanopartículas de prata foram sintetizadas através da 

redução do nitrato de prata (1 ou 10%) pelo borihidreto de sódio (NaBH4) em 

meio isopropílico contendo trimetafosfato de sódio (TMP) ou hexametafosfato 

de sódio (HMP)) e flúor (F). Os nanocompósitos foram caracterizados por 

microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV) e por difração de raios-X, e também 

determinada a concentração inibitória mínima (MIC) contra células 

planctônicas de C. albicans e S. mutans. A efetividade contra biofilmes pré-

formados de 24h dos nanocompósitos, foi testada em concentrações de 1x e 

10x os valores de MIC (de 40?g Ag ml
?1

), avaliada através da quantificação de 

células cultiváveis (CFUs), da atividade metabólica (XTT) e da biomassa total 

(Cristal Violeta). Os nanocompósitos contendo 10% de Ag apresentaram maior 

efetividade antimicrobiana contra ambos os microrganismos, comparados aos 

nanocompósitos contendo 1% de prata. O biofilme de S. mutans foi mais 

suscetível aos nanocompósitos TMP ou HMP/AgNP que o biofilme de C. 

albicans, com reduções respectivas de 2,88-3,71 log10 e 0,45-1,43 log10. Os 

nanocompósitos permitiram uma diminuição de cerca de 75% da biomassa 

total e em torno de 90% da atividade metabólica em ambos os biofilmes. Para 

avaliação in vitro do potencial anticárie, foi sintetizado um novo nanocompósito 

contendo 0,2% de TMP, 100 ppm de flúor e 10% de Ag e caracterizado por 



microscopia eletrônica de transmissão (MET).  Blocos de esmalte bovino (4 

mm x 4 mm, n = 60) selecionados pela dureza superficial inicial (SHi) foram 

alocados em cinco grupos (n = 12): água deionizada (Placebo), 100 ppm F 

(100F), 225 ppm F (225F), 100 ppm F + 0,2% TMP (100F/TMP) e 100 ppm F + 

0,2% TMP + 10% Ag (100F/TMP/Ag). Os blocos foram tratados 2x ao dia com 

as soluções e submetidos a cinco ciclos de pH (soluções des e 

remineralizadora) à 37° C. Em seguida, determinou-se a dureza superficial 

final (SHf) e a dureza subsuperficial integrada (?KHN), e a concentração de 

fluoreto (F) e cálcio (Ca) no esmalte. A efetividade desse nanocompósisto 

(100F/TMP/Ag) contra a formação de biofilmes simples e misto de C. albicans 

(ATCC 10231) e S. mutans (ATCC 25175) foi avaliada por meio da contagem 

de unidades formadoras de colônias (CFUs). Os biofilmes foram também 

analisados por microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV). A dureza superficial 

(% SH) foi similar nas amostras tratadas com soluções contendo 225F, 

100F/TMP e 100F/TMP/Ag (p&gt; 0,001). Além disso, a capacidade de reduzir o 

corpo da lesão (?KHN) foi maior em 110F, 225F, 100F/TMP e 100F/TMP/Ag (p 

&lt;0,001) na área A (5-20 ?m) e na área B somente com 225F e 100F/TMP. O 

grupo 100F/ TMP/Ag apresentou maior desmineralização na área B (20-130 

?m) (p&amp;lt;0,001). A concentração de F da solução 100F/TMP/Ag foi semelhante 

a 225F (p&amp;lt;0,001). Os grupos 100F, 225F, 100F/TMP e 100F/TMP/Ag 

apresentaram a maior e similar concentração de Ca (p&gt; 0,001). A dureza 

superficial (% SH) foi similar nas amostras tratadas com soluções contendo 

225F, 100F / TMP e 100F / TMP / Ag (p&gt; 0,001). Além disso, a capacidade de 

reduzir o corpo da lesão (?KHN) foi maior em 110F, 225F, 100F / TMP e 100F 

/ TMP / Ag (p&amp;lt;0,001) na zona A (5-20 ?m) e na zona B apenas com 225F e 

100F / TMP. O grupo 100F / TMP / Ag apresentou maior desmineralização na 

zona B (20-130 ?m) (p&amp;lt;0,001). A concentração de F da solução 100F / TMP / 

Ag foi semelhante a 225F (p&amp;lt;0,001). Os grupos 100F, 225F, 100F / TMP e 

100F / TMP / Ag apresentaram a maior e a mesma concentração de Ca (p&gt; 

0,001).Embora a solução 100F/TMP/Ag tenha apresentado valores mais 

baixos de áreas profundas do que a solução contendo 225 ppm F, o 

nanocompósito foi capaz de inibir a desmineralização da superfície do esmalte. 

Estes nanocompósitos demonstraram atividade antimicrobiana significativa, 

especialmente contra S. mutans, e podem ser considerados uma alternativa 



potencial para novos biomateriais odontológicos, visando a prevenção ou 

tratamento de lesões cariosas.

Mendes-Gouvêa CC. Antibiofilm and anticariogenic evaluation of 

nanocomposites formed by fluoride and sodium polyphosphates 

associated with silver nanoparticles. In vitro study.[Thesis] Araçatuba: 

UNESP - São Paulo State University; 2018.  

 

GENERAL ABSTRACT 

The aim of this study was to synthesize and characterize nanocomposites 

formed polyphosphates (sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP) or sodium 

hexametaphosphate (HMP)) and fluoride (F) associated with silver 

nanoparticles. The anti-biofilm activity of the nanocomposites were evaluated 

against Candida albicans (ATCC ATCC 10231) and Streptococcus mutans 

(ATCC 25175) . as well as their potential in inhibiting demineralization and 

increasing the remineralization of dental enamel by in vitro pH cycling assay. 

Silver nanoparticles were synthesized by reduction of silver nitrate (1 or 10%) 

by sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in isopropylic medium containing sodium 

trimetaphosphate (TMP) or sodium hexametaphosphate (HMP)) and fluoride 

(F). The nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy 

(SEM) and X-ray diffraction. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the 

nanocomposites was determined against planktonic cells of C. albicans and S. 

mutans. Effectiveness of preformed 24-hour biofilms of nanocomposites at 1x 

and 10x MIC values was assessed by quantifying viable cells (CFUs), metabolic 

activity (XTT) and total biomass (Crystal Violet). The nanocomposites 

containing 10% Ag showed higher antimicrobial effectiveness against both 

microorganisms compared to nanocomposites containing 1% silver. The S. 

mutans biofilm was more susceptible to the TMP or HMP-AgNP 

nanocomposites than the C. albicans biofilm, with respective reductions of 2.88-

3.71 log10 and 0.45-1.43 log10. The nanocomposites allowed a reduction of 

about 75% of the total biomass and about 90% of the metabolic activity in both 

biofilms. For the in vitro evaluation of the anticaries potential, a new 

nanocomposite containing 0.2% TMP, 100 ppm fluorine and 10% Ag was 

synthesized and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 

Bovine enamel blocks (4 mm x 4 mm, n = 60) selected by initial surface 

hardness (SHi) were allocated in five groups (n=12): deionized water (Placebo), 

100 ppm F (100 F), 225 ppm F (225 F), 100 ppm F + 0.2% TMP (100 F / TMP) 



and 100 ppm F + 0.2% TMP + 10% Ag (100F / TMP / Ag). The blocks were 

treated 2x daily with the solutions and subjected to five pH cycles 

(deismineralizang and remineralizing solutions) at 37 ° C. Then, the final 

surface hardness (SHf) and integrated subsurface hardness (?KHN), the 

concentration of fluoride (F) and calcium (Ca) in the enamel was determined. 

The effectiveness of this nanocomposite (100F / TMP / Ag) against the 

formation of single and mixed biofilms of C. albicans (ATCC 10231) and S. 

mutans (ATCC 25175) was evaluated by the counting colony forming units 

(CFUs). Biofilms were also analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  

Similar values of %SH were observed for groups 225F, 100F/TMP and 

100F/TMP Ag (p&gt; 0.001). The 225F, 100F/TMP and 100F/TMP/Ag solutions 

showed capacity to reduce the lesion body (?KHN) in the depth of 5-20 ?m. F 

concentration was similar in the enamel for the 100F/TMP/Ag and 225F (p&gt; 

0.001). The groups 100F, 225F, 100F/TMP and 100F/TMP/Ag presented the 

highest and the same concentration of Ca (p&gt; 0.001). In relation to viable cells 

100F/TMP/Ag nanocomposite promoted significant log reductions in the number 

of CFUs of S. mutans, of 5.42 and 4.46 log10 respectively in single and mixed 

biofilms and C. albicans was more resistant. SEM images confirmed these 

results. The surface hardness (% SH) was similar in the samples treated with 

solutions containing 225F, 100F/TMP and 100F/TMP/Ag (p&gt; 0.001). In addition, 

the ability to reduce the lesion body (?KHN) was greater in 110F, 225F, 100F / 

TMP and 100F/TMP/Ag (p&amp;lt;0.001) in zone A (5-20 ?m) and in zone B only with 

225F and 100F/TMP. The 100F/TMP/Ag group showed greater 

demineralization in zone B (20-130 ?m) (p&amp;lt;0.001). The F concentration of the 

100F/TMP/Ag solution was similar to 225F (p&amp;lt;0.001). Groups 100F, 225F, 

100F/TMP and 100F/TMP/Ag showed the highest and the same concentration 

of Ca (p&gt; 0.001).Although the 100F/TMP/Ag solution yielded lower values of 

lesion deep areas than the solution containing 225 ppm F, but the 

nanocomposite was able to inhibit demineralization of surface of enamel. These 

compounds have demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity, especially 

against S. mutans, and can be considered a potential alternative for new dental 

biomaterials, aiming at the prevention or treatment of carious lesions.

1. INTRODUÇÃO GERAL 

A cárie dentária é considerada a doença mais prevalente nos seres 

humanos, atingindo 80-90% da população mundial [Petersen, 2004]. Sua 

etiologia já foi descrita como multifatorial por alguns autores [Keyes, 1960; 

Newbrune, 1978], enquanto outros defendiam ter um fator causador principal, 

como na revisão de Sheiham e James [Sheiham and James, 2015], na qual 

afirmam ser o açúcar o fator fundamental para o desenvolvimento desta 

doença. Mas o que é universalmente aceito é que a agressão à superfície 

dental é causada pela ação do Streptococcus mutans [Hamada and Slade, 

1980] uma bactéria Gram 
+
, mais frequentemente encontrada no biofilme 

aderido à superfície do esmalte. 

A patogenicidade do S. mutans, se dá primeiramente pela alta 

capacidade de formar biofilmes em superfícies sólidas [Huang et al., 2013; 

Shimotoyodome et al., 2007; Tamura et al., 2009]. O aumento da virulência das 

células de S. mutans ao formar biofilme também pode estar associado a uma 

maior tolerância ao baixo pH, em comparação com culturas planctônicas 

[Krzysciak et al., 2014]. No biofilme dental o S. mutans é um dos principais 

produtores de substâncias poliméricas extracelulares, os exopolissacarídeos 

(EPS). Uma matriz rica em EPS proporciona estabilidade e coesão mecânica 

ao biofilme e permite a criação de microambientes altamente ácidos, que são 

críticos para a patogênese da cárie dentária [Klein et al., 2015]. Contudo, o 

principal fator de virulência dessa bactéria é a secreção de ácidos [Banas, 

2004], os quais levam à desmineralização do esmalte dentário e o 

aparecimento da lesão inicial de cárie. 

Outros microrganismos também estão relacionados com a doença cárie, 

como a espécie fúngica Candida albicans, que apresenta importante papel 

como agente secundário, sendo responsável pela progressão do processo 

carioso. De acordo com Pereira et al (2018) [Pereira et al., 2018], este fungo 

possui enzimas proteolíticas que contribuem para a colagenólise, evoluindo a 

doença particularmente para a cárie dentinária. Além disso, há indícios que a 

C. albicans tem a capacidade de aderir a hidroxiapatita por meio de interação 

eletrostática, e podendo levar a dissolução desse mineral [Nikawa et al., 2003].

O amplo espectro de ação contra microrganismos [Xiu et al., 2012] torna 

a prata um metal amplamente utilizado na prevenção da colonização de 

dispositivos médicos [Balazs et al., 2004; Monteiro et al., 2009], em curativos 

de feridas [Bjarnsholt et al., 2007; Gauger et al., 2003], em tratamentos de 

queimaduras [Khundkar et al., 2010; Ulkur et al., 2005]. Em sua forma 

nanoparticulada, a prata (AgNP) mostrou-se maior eficácia antimicrobiana por 

ser mais reativa [Panacek et al., 2006] e permitir uma maior área de contato e 

consequente interação com bactérias e fungos [Lok CN, 2006; Morones et al., 

2005].  

O flúor (F) foi o principal agente utilizado na prevenção da cárie dentária, 

podendo ser utilizado de forma sistêmica, nas águas de abastecimento público, 

ou de forma tópica como uso em dentifrícios, géis, enxaguatórios ou vernizes. 

O F tem uma ação importante ao manter o equilíbrio mineral dos dentes, 

agindo na dinâmica do processo de desmineralização e remineralização 

dentária [Ten Cate, 1990]. A descoberta das propriedades do F em relação à 

prevenção da cárie dentária pode ser considerada um marco na odontologia 

preventiva, e nesse sentido estudos vem sendo realizados visando  melhorar a 

eficácia do F adicionando-o em produtos de higiene bucal e materiais 

restauradores provisórios.  

McGaughey and Stowell (1977) [McGaughey and Stowell, 1977], 

divulgaram a eficiência de outros agentes, como os polifosfatos, capazes de 

modificar a superfície da hidroxiapatita através de sua adsorção, diminuindo a 

perda mineral e aumentando o processo de remineralização. Outros trabalhos 

reafirmaram que os fosfatos apresentam afinidade pelo esmalte reduzindo a 

perda mineral [da Camara et al., 2014; do Amaral et al., 2013; Takeshita et al., 

2009]. A suplementação de dentifrícios com fosfatos inorgânicos e orgânicos e 

uma concentração reduzida de F aumentou o efeito anticárie desse produto 

[Danelon et al., 2014; do Amaral et al., 2013; Takeshita et al., 2009].  

Dentre os polifosfatos, o trimetafosfato de sódio (TMP) tem sido testado 

com diferentes concentrações de F em vernizes, géis, enxaguatórios e 

dentifrícios e mostrou uma redução da perda mineral e aumentou o processo 

de remineralização, [Danelon et al., 2014; Favretto et al., 2013; Manarelli et al., 

2011; Moretto et al., 2013]. Outro fosfato inorgânico, o hexametafosfato de 

sódio (HMP), é bem conceituado na indústria alimentícia como agente 



3 
 

antimicrobiano, devido sua capacidade de aumentar a permeabilidade da 

membrana externa bacteriana [Vaara and Jaakkola, 1989]. O HMP também 

apresenta habilidade de diminuir a solubilidade do esmalte [Van Dijk JW, 1980] 

e por isso estudos estão sendo conduzidos utilizando a associação HMP/F no 

tratamento anticárie em dentifrícios [da Camara et al., 2014].  

Vale salientar que a utilização da proporção fosfato/fluoreto adequada é 

essencial para obter uma ação anticárie efetiva [Danelon et al., 2014; do 

Amaral et al., 2013; Favretto et al., 2013; Manarelli et al., 2013; Moretto et al., 

2013; Takeshita et al., 2009]. Diante da  grande ocorrência de cárie dentária e 

a crescente resistência microbiana frente à agentes antimicrobianos 

convencionais, o desenvolvimento de biomateriais capazes de inibir a 

desmineralização e induzir a remineralização da estrutura dentária, assim como 

apresentar atividade antibiofilme é de suma importância. No presente trabalho 

foram sintetizados nanocompósitos de Ag –TMP e –HMP e avaliou-se a 

efetividade contra biofilmes de Candida albicans e Streptococcus mutans e sua 

capacidade de inibição da desmineralização da superfície de esmalte dental 

bovino.

Sodium trimetaphosphate and hexametaphosphate impregnated with 

silver nanoparticles: characteristics and antimicrobial efficacy. 

ABSTRACT 

This study aimed to synthesize and characterize materials containing 

silver nanoparticles (AgNP) with polyphosphates (sodium trimetaphosphate 

(TMP) or sodium hexametaphosphate (HMP), and evaluate their effect against 

Candida albicans and Streptococcus mutans. The minimum inhibitory 

concentration (MIC) was determined, which was followed by the quantification 

of the biofilm by counting colony-forming units (CFUs), the amount of metabolic 

activity, and the total biomass. The MICs revealed greater effectiveness of 

composites containing 10% Ag (TMP + Ag10% (T10) and HMP + Ag10% (H10)) 

against both microorganisms. It was observed that T10 and H10 reduced the 

formation of biofilms by 56–76% for C. albicans and by 52–94% for S. mutans 

for total biomass and metabolic activity. These composites promoted significant 

log reductions in the number of CFUs, between 0.45–1.43 log10 for C. albicans 

and 2.88–3.71 log10 for S. mutans (p &amp;lt;.001). These composites demonstrated 

significant antimicrobial activity, especially against S. mutans, and may be 

considered a potential alternative for new dental materials. 

 

INTRODUCTION 

Streptococcus mutans is the main cariogenic microorganism, and its 

capacity to produce acid and survive at low pH, as well as its ability to 

synthesize extracellular polysaccharides, are important virulence factors which 

contribute to the colonization of the tooth surface, development of pathogenic 

biofilms, and enamel demineralization  (Leone et al. 2008, Li and Chang 2008; 

Delbem et al. 2014). Although the development of dental caries is related to the 

formation of biofilm, the progression of established lesions may include species 

of Candida, particularly Candida albicans (Shibata and Morioka 1982; Monteiro 

et al. 2015).  

Composites containing calcium and phosphate have shown promising 

anticariostatic effects (do Amaral et al. 2013; Takeshita et al. 2015; da Camara 

et al. 2016). Among the phosphate salts, sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP) and 

sodium hexametaphosphate (HMP) have been effective in reducing enamel 

demineralization and improving remineralization. They are inorganic 



9 
 

cyclophosphates with the capacity to adsorb hydroxyapatite and protein through 

hydroxyl (Souza et al. 2013; Delbem et al. 2014) and amino (Leone et al. 2008; 

Li and Chang 2008) attachment sites. Added to low concentrations of fluoride in 

an appropriate proportion in oral health products, they provide a greater 

protective effect than conventional fluoride products (da Camara et al. 2014; 

Manarelli et al. 2015; Takeshita et al. 2015; Conceicao et al. 2015; da Camara 

et al. 2016). 

 The development of multifunctional biomaterials to be used in the health 

field is the focus of increasing attention. Added to that, the exponential growth 

of nanotechnology, and the use of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) as an 

antimicrobial agent allowing for increased surface-to-volume ratios and specific 

interactions with species of bacteria and fungi (Baker et al. 2005, Morones et al. 

2005; Lok et al. 2006), new approaches could be useful to prevent and control 

dental caries. A material containing AgNP as an antimicrobial agent, and 

sources of fluoride and phosphate to prevent the demineralization of dental 

enamel could achieve promising results. Thus, this study aimed to synthesize 

composites containing AgNP, F, and TMP or HMP, and to characterize and 

evaluate their effect against Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans. 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Synthesis and characterization of the nanocomposites 

Nanocomposites were synthesized based on the protocol proposed by 

Miranda et al. (2010), with some modifications. The synthesis was carried out in 

an alcoholic medium (isopropanol) using sodium borohydride (NaBH4, Sigma-

Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) as a reducing agent. Suspensions containing 

sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP, Sigma-Aldrich, CAS 7785-84-4) or sodium 

hexametaphosphate (HMP, Sigma-Aldrich, CAS 68915-31-1), fluoride (NaF, 

Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and silver nitrate (AgNO3, Merck) were prepared 

in the presence of a surfactant (ammonium salt of polymethacrylic acid (NHPM), 

Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA). AgNO3 was employed at 1% or 10% 

of the phosphate weight. The molar proportions between phosphates and 

fluoride was 1.2:1 TMP/NaF or 0.62:1 HMP/NaF, and between silver ions (Ag
+
) 

and NaBH4 it was 1:1.26. Samples were dried overnight at 70°C. AgNP with no 

polyphosphates was also synthesized.  



10 
 

The morphology of the nanocomposites was characterized by scanning 

electron microscopy (SEM) on a Zeiss Supra 35VP microscope (S-360 

microscope, Leo, MA, USA) with field emission gun electron effect (FEG-SEM, 

10 kV). A drop of each sample was placed on a silicon substratum and dried at 

40°C for 12 h. Two-dimensional images were constructed by analyzing the P 

K?, Ag L?1, and O K? energy emissions using energy dispersive X-ray detector 

(EDX) analysis with mapping. Samples were also characterized by X-ray 

diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku diffractometer [Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan], 

DMax 2500PC) with CuK radiation (? = 1.5406 A) generated at a voltage of 40 

kV and a current of 40 mA. The scanning range (2?) was from 20° to 110° with 

a step size of 0.2°, a 1.0 mm divergent slit, 0.2 mm collection slot, and 

accumulation for reading every 0.02 s. 

 

Determination of Ag
+
 concentration 

The concentration of Ag
+
 in the composites was determined by a 9616 

BNWP (Thermo Scientific, Beverly, MA, USA) ion-specific electrode coupled to 

an ion analyzer (Orion 720 A
+
, Thermo Scientific). One thousand ?g Ag ml

?1
 

were prepared (1.57 g of dried AgNO3 for 1 l of deionized water) as a standard, 

and diluted in deionized water to achieve equivalent silver concentrations in the 

composites. Thus, the combined electrode was calibrated with solutions 

containing 6.25 to 100 ?g Ag ml
?1

. A silver ionic strength adjuster solution (ISA, 

Cat. No. 940011), which provides a constant background ionic strength was 

used (1 ml of each sample/standard: 0.02 ml of ISA). 

 

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 

The microdilution method was performed following the Clinical 

Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (CLSI: M27-A2 and M07-A9). The 

nanocomposites were diluted in deionized water in geometric progression, from 

2 to 1,024 times. Afterwards, each nanocomposite concentration obtained 

previously was diluted (1:5) in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) for Candida 

albicans (ATCC 10231), and in brain heart infusion (BHI, Difco, Le Pont de 

Claix, France) for Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 25175). Inocula from 24-h 

cultures were adjusted to the 0.5 McFarland standard turbidity equivalent in 

saline solution (0.85% NaCl). Suspensions of each strain were diluted (1:5) in 



11 
 

saline and subsequently diluted (1:20) in RPMI 1640 for C. albicans or BHI 

broth for S. mutans. Each microorganism suspension (100 ?l) was added in the 

wells of microtiter plates containing 100 ?l of each nanocomposite 

concentration. Polyphosphate/fluoride, AgNP, and chlorhexidine gluconate 

(CHG) (Periogard-Colgate, New York, NY, USA) were tested as controls. The 

microtiter plates were incubated at 37°C, and the MICs were determined 

visually as the lowest concentration of nanocomposites with no microorganism 

growth after 48 h. 

 

Biofilm formation and treatment 

Single species biofilms were grown in 96-well microtiter plates (Costar, 

Corning Incorporated, Tewksbury, MA, USA) containing 0.2 ml of C. albicans 

cell suspension (1 × 10
7
 cells ml

?1
 in artificial saliva) (Silva et al. 2010) or 0.2 ml 

of S. mutans (1 × 10
8 

cells ml
?1

 in artificial saliva) (Arias et al. 2016). The plates 

were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After this period, the biofilm-containing wells 

were washed with 0.2 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7, 0.1 M) to 

remove the non-adherent cells. Next, the nanocomposites were added to the 

biofilms at concentrations based on the MIC values obtained previously. For 

this, 0.2 ml of the T10 and H10 nanocomposites at MIC and 10 × MIC were 

diluted in artificial saliva, which was added to the biofilm-containing wells. AgNP 

with no phosphates and CHG at 0.018% (positive control) were also tested 

against the biofilms, and artificial saliva with no nanocomposites was used as 

negative control. The biofilms were then re-incubated at 37°C for 24 h. 

 

Biofilm quantification 

The quantification of C. albicans and S. mutans cultivable cells from 

biofilms treated with T10 and H10 was carried out by counting colony-forming 

units (CFUs). For this, the biofilm-containing wells were scraped with a tip, 

using 0.2 ml of PBS each time five times, totaling 1 ml of suspension, and the 

cell suspensions were then placed in Falcon tubes. The suspensions were 

vortexed and serially diluted in PBS and plated on SDA (C. albicans) or BHI (S. 

mutans). 

 After incubation at 37°C for 24 h for C. albicans and 48 h for S. mutans, 

the total number of CFUs was counted and the log CFU per unit area (log10 



12 
 

CFU cm
?2

) was determined. After the biofilms were treated, the total biomass 

was analyzed by the crystal violet (CV) method (Monteiro et al. 2015). The 

biofilms were washed with 0.2 ml of PBS and fixed by adding 0.2 ml of 99% 

methanol (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min. The methanol was then removed and the 

wells were allowed to dry at room temperature. Then, 0.2 ml of CV (1%, v v
–1

, 

Merck) were added into each well, and after 5 min, the excess was withdrawn 

by washing each well-plate with deionized water. CV bound to the biofilms was 

eluted using 0.2 ml of acetic acid (33%, v v
–1

, Sigma–Aldrich), and the 

absorbance was measured in a microtiter-plate reader (Eon Microplate 

Spectrophotometer; Bio Tek, Winooski, VT, USA) at 570 nm, and standardized 

in relation to the area of the well-plate (Abs 570 nm cm?2). 

 Metabolic activity was assessed by the XTT reduction assay (2,3-bis (2-

methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium 

hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich). Biofilm-containing wells were washed once with 0.2 

ml of PBS and 0.2 ml of the solution containing 150 mg XTT l
?1

 and 10 mg of 

phenazine methosulfate l
?1

 in each well. The plates were then incubated at 

37°C, under agitation at 120 rpm, in the dark. After 3 h, the absorbance was 

read at 490 nm cm
?2

. All assays were performed, independently and in 

triplicate, on three different occasions. 

 

Microscopy 

The structural analysis of single biofilms of C. albicans and S. mutans 

exposed to the nanocomposites was verified by SEM. Briefly, the biofilms were 

formed in 24-well plates as described before. Then, the T10 and H10 

nanocomposites were added to the wells at the concentration of 10/100 ?g Ag 

ml
?1

 for C. albicans and 40/400 ?g Ag ml
?1

 for S. mutans biofilms. After 

treatment for 24 h, the wells were washed with PBS and the biofilms were 

dehydrated using an ethanol concentration series (70% for 10 min, 95% for 10 

min, and 100% for 20 min), followed by air drying for 20 min (Silva et al. 2013). 

The bottom of the wells were cut with a scalpel blade (number 11, Solidor, 

Lamedid Commercial and Services Ltda, Barueri, Brazil) heated in flame, and 

the biofilms were coated with gold for scanning with the electron microscope (S-

360 microscope, Leo, Cambridge, MA, USA) (Fernandes et al. 2016). 

 



13 
 

Statistical analysis 

SigmaPlot 12.0 software (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) was 

used for statistical analysis; the significance level was set at 5%. CFUs, CV (for 

both microorganisms tested), and XTT (C. albicans) data exhibited a normal 

and homogeneous distribution (Shapiro–Wilks test) and were submitted to one-

way analysis of variance, followed by the Fisher test. XTT data from S. mutans 

were submitted to logarithmic transformation and one-way analysis of variance 

followed by the Fisher test. 

 

RESULTS 

Synthesis, characterization, and Ag+ determination in the 

nanocomposites 

XRD and SEM demonstrated the association of silver nanoparticles in 

both polyphosphates (sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP) and sodium 

hexametaphosphate (HMP). The typical XRD pattern of the prepared T1 

(TMP+Ag1%) and T10 (TMP+Ag10%) powder showed diffraction peaks at 2? = 

14.4°, 17.3°, 23.4°, 26.1°, and 29.2°, and the corresponding crystallographic 

form (PDF ? 72–1628) of the TMP salt (Figure 1a). Figure 1a shows diffraction 

peaks at 2? = 38.2°, 44.4°, and 64.6°, which can be indexed to (2 0 0), (1 1 1), 

and (2 2 0) planes of pure silver with the face centered cubic system (PDF ? 

04–0783). Figure 1b shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of HMP that present a 

wide halo between 15° and 35°, characteristic of amorphous materials. The X-

ray diffraction patterns of H1 (HMP+Ag1%) and H10 (HMP+Ag10%) indicate 

sodium hexametaphosphate salt – (NaPO3)6 (PDF ? 3643), and suggest the 

presence of other polyphosphate salts, such as (NaH2PO4. (H2O), NaH2PO4, 

Na5P3O10, NaPO3, and Na2H2P2O7, by comparing the experimentally obtained 

XRD patterns with standard patterns (PDF ? 11–651, 11–659, 11–652, 76–

788, and 11–657). SEM images of T10 and H10 (Figure 2) show silver 

nanoparticles (white shades) dispersed and decorating the surface of the 

phosphates at micrometric size (gray shades). AgNP anchored on the surface 

of HMP or TMP were more evident in samples containing Ag at 10% than at 1% 

of Ag. The 2-D images were constructed by analyzing the energy released from 

the O K?, P K? (constituents of the TMP and HMP material) and Ag K? 



14 
 

emissions, indicating the uniform distribution of these elements in the 

demarcated area in the micrograph.  

The total amount of Ag
+
 (from the AgNO3 source) added to the reaction 

to obtain AgNP with no TMP or HMP was 20,000 ?g Ag ml
?1

, and the ionic 

concentration was determined by electrode method at 576.19 ?g Ag ml
?1

, thus a 

reduction of 97.12% of ionic silver was observed. All samples containing Ag at 

1% (H1 and T1) or 10% (H10 and T10) presented Ag
+
 % reduction between 

98.04 and 99.85%. For H1 and T1 samples, the Ag concentrations were 

determined as 1.43 and 8.13 ?g Ag
+
 ml

?1
, and the total amount of Ag used in 

the reaction was 1,000 ?g Ag ml
?1

. For H10 and T10 samples, the Ag 

concentrations were 129.8 and 195.4 ?g Ag
+
 ml

?1
, and the total amount of Ag 

used in the reaction was 10,000 ?g Ag ml
?1

. 

 

Antimicrobial effect 

The nanocomposites were effective against both strains tested in 

planktonic form (Table 1). Composites containing Ag at 10% (T10 and H10) 

were more effective against C. albicans (10 ?g Ag V) than against S. mutans 

(40 ?g Ag V), while at 1% Ag only H1 presented an effect against the 

microorganisms (80 ?g Ag V). For the group of AgNP without TMP or HMP 

synthesized in the same conditions, the MIC values were 62.5 ?g Ag ml
?1

 for C. 

albicans and 125 ?g Ag ml
?1

 for S. mutans. At lower Ag concentration (1%), 

only H1 presented an antimicrobial effect. In this study, biofilm cells of C. 

albicans were resistant to all concentrations tested of AgNP without phosphates 

(Figure 3). However, after adding the polyphosphates to the AgNP, there were 

significant reductions of 1.43 log10 in the C. albicans biofilm treated with T10, 

and 1.17 log10 treated with H10 (100 ?g Ag ml
?1

) (Figure 3a), when compared to 

the negative control group (p = 0.004 and p = 0.014). Surprisingly, S. mutans 

biofilm cells were more susceptible to T10 and H10 than the C. albicans biofilm 

cells, and they were similar to the CHG positive control (PC) (Figure 3a). 

Notably, there was a reduction of 4.2 log10 in the S. mutans biofilm at the lowest 

concentration (40 ?g Ag ml
?1

) of T10.  

The total biomass quantification and metabolic activity in the C. albicans 

and S. mutans biofilms are shown in Figure 3b and c. Significant reductions (~ 

75%) in the total biomass of both microorganisms were observed in the lowest 



15 
 

concentrations of T10 (10 ?g Ag ml
?1

) and H10 (40 ?g Ag ml
?1

), being similar to 

CHG (PC) (Figure 3b). Notably, the metabolic activity (Figure 3c) of C. albicans 

biofilm was reduced (93.4–94.4%) at both 10 and 100 ?g Ag ml
?1

 of T10 and at 

100 ?g Ag ml
?1

of H10 (92.0%). T10 and H10 nanocomposites reduced the 

metabolic activity of S. mutans biofilms by ~ 90%, at all concentrations tested. 

 

Microscopy 

Figure 4 shows hyphal cell density similar to the negative control in all C. 

albicans biofilms exposed to nanocomposites T10 and H10, while a reduction in 

cellular biomass was observed in biofilm treated with chlorhexidine gluconate. 

On the other hand, the quantity of cells in the S. mutans biofilms treated with 

T10 and H10 was as suppressed as in the biofilm subjected to chlorhexidine 

gluconate treatment (Figure 5). 

 

DISCUSSION 

This study evaluated the antimicrobial action of nanocomposites against 

strains of C. albicans and S. mutans in both the planktonic form and in biofilms 

grown for 24 h. Analyses included the quantification of viable cells, total 

biomass, and metabolic activity.  

Currently, there are several studies in the literature that show the 

mechanism of action of silver nanoparticles. As has already been 

demonstrated, silver nanoparticles promote direct damage to the cellular 

membrane by adhering to it (Li et al. 2008) or by dissolving it through the 

release of silver ions (Kon and Rai 2013). Then, once inside the cell of the 

microorganism, silver nanoparticles can lead to DNA damage (Li et al. 2008), 

mainly via production of ROS (Marambio-Jones and Hoek 2010; Duran et al. 

2016), and can also affect the electrochemical proton gradient through the 

respiratory process, which could discontinue the ATP synthesis, leading to the 

death of the microorganism cell (Reidy et al. 2013). 

The combination of silver nanoparticles with other compounds may 

improve their antimicrobial activity (Pal et al. 2007; Monteiro et al. 2013). The 

results of the present study demonstrated that the association of AgNP with 

TMP or HMP did not hinder the antimicrobial silver effect, but the association of 

Ag and polyphosphates resulted in similar MICs at a lower Ag concentration 



16 
 

(Table 1). The crystallographic surface structures of AgNP are an important 

physico-chemical property which is related to their antibacterial activity (Pal et 

al. 2007), and could be changed when associated with those polyphosphates. 

The composites were more effective against planktonic cells of C. albicans (10 

?g Ag ml
?1

) than S. mutans (40 Ag ml
?1

) when the Ag concentration was 10% 

(T10 and H10), while at 1%, just H1 showed an antimicrobial effect (80 ?g Ag 

ml
?1

). HMP has the ability to increase outer membrane cell permeability 

(Shibata and Morioka 1982; Vaara and Jaakkola 1989), and it might facilitate Ag 

entrance into the microorganism cells. Indeed, the polyphosphate property of 

adsorption on protein by hydroxyl and amino sites (Leone et al. 2008; Li and 

Chang 2008) may increase Ag availability and improve the antimicrobial effect 

of those composites. This was observed especially for T10 (TMP+Ag10%) and 

H10, (HMP+Ag10%) which have a higher Ag concentration impregnated on the 

phosphates. H1 (HMP+Ag1%) alone was shown to be effective against both 

planktonic strains. These results demonstrate that not only was the amount of 

Ag relevant for the antimicrobial effectiveness of the composites, but its 

association with the phosphates had a significant role in the increase in the 

antimicrobial potential of the TMP/HMP-AgNP nanocomposites. This has also 

been demonstrated by Humphreys et al. (2011) and the synergism between 

polyphosphates and silver might increase the permeability of the outer 

membrane of bacteria associated to sequestration of divalent cations by 

polyphosphate (Maier et al. 1999; Akhtar et al. 2008; Obritsch et al. 2008), 

enabling silver to pass through the membrane and then causing damage to the 

cell, such as loss of DNA replication and protein inactivation (Feng et al. 2000). 

 The greater susceptibility of planktonic cells of C. albicans in comparison 

to S. mutans planktonic cells can be primarily explained by the structural 

differences in their cell membranes (Malanovic and Lohner 2016). Membranes 

of bacteria are negatively charged due to anionic phospholipids, while the 

charge in fungal membranes is neutral, constituted by zwitterionic phospholipids 

and ergosterol. The work of Abbaszadegan et al. (2015) states that the 

antimicrobial action of the nanoparticle shelf depends on the charge of the 

external surface of the particles as influenced by the stabilizers and capping 

agents used in the synthesis; thus, the AgNP fabricated in the present study 

can be considered negatively charged. According to Mandal et al. (2016), the 



17 
 

mechanism of AgNP action depends on the outer charge of the bacterial 

membranes, and this may explain the decreased susceptibility of S. mutans. 

Furthermore, the physical and chemical properties of the AgNP related to the 

release of Ag
+
 ions are noteworthy. It seemed that AgNP were more clearly 

adhered to the surface of TMP than the surface of HPM (Figure 2a and c). This 

could facilitate the release of Ag
+
 ions, and hence, its highest concentration in 

the composites containing TMP, regardless of the amount of AgNO3 (1 or 10%) 

used in the synthesis reaction. On the other hand, it did not increase the 

antimicrobial effectiveness of the T10, suggesting antimicrobial activity is not 

just related to the amount of Ag
+
 ions released from that composite.  

However, many antimicrobial agents that show effectiveness against 

planktonic cells could be ineffective against the same microorganism grown in a 

biofilm (Jefferson 2004; Kim et al. 2008). Biofilms of Candida species, for 

example, can exhibit up to 65 times more tolerance to killing by metals than 

corresponding planktonic cultures (Harrison et al. 2007). Although biofilms of C. 

albicans showed tolerance against pure AgNP (Figure 3a), the addition of the 

polyphosphates resulted in inhibition of the growth of fungal biofilms. The same 

occurred against biofilm cells of S. mutans. Nevertheless, the microscopy 

images (Figures 4 and 5) show that growth of C. albicans biofilm cells was 

similar to the negative control, while the reduction in biofilm cells of S. mutans 

was consistent with chlorhexidine gluconate, as shown through CFU analysis. 

The explanation would also be related to the mechanism of action of 

polyphosphates on planktonic cells (Maier et al. 1999; Akhtar et al. 2008; 

Obritsch et al. 2008), and also for a probable buffer effect promoted by the 

phosphates in the S. mutans biofilm environment. To this end, as S. mutans is 

an acidogenic and aciduric bacterial strain, TMP and HMP may have hampered 

the decrease in pH, and hence, the proliferation of the cells in the biofilm. 

 The total biomass and metabolic activity of fungal and bacterial biofilms 

are shown in Figure 3b and c. Overall, the methods used to quantify microbial 

biofilms were performed as complementary analysis. As shown in the results, 

the lowest concentrations of T10 (10 ?g Ag ml
?1

) and H10 (40 ?g Ag ml
?1

) were 

able to reduce the total biomass in a manner similar to the positive control 

(CHG). Figure 3c shows the reduction in biofilm activity of C. albicans of 

between 92 and 94.4%, with the exception of the concentration of 10 ?g Ag ml
?1

 



18 
 

H10. All concentrations of both T10 and H10 reduced the biofilm biomass of S. 

mutans by ~ 90%. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that  S. mutans may not have 

properly absorbed and/or metabolized the salt of XTT (Kuhn et al. 2003; Gobor 

et al. 2011), and hence, interfered with the spectrophotometer reading since 

there was also low metabolic activity in the negative control group (NC).  

Finally, looking at the antimicrobial effect of the polyphosphates TMP or 

HMP-AgNP in comparison with AgNP alone, the findings of the present study 

demonstrate that both TMP and HMP with a very low NaF concentration 

substantially improved the effectiveness of AgNP against both the planktonic 

and sessile forms of the microorganism. This suggests that AgNP associated 

with TMP or HMP polyphosphates and fluoride may be effective antimicrobial 

biomaterials for promising applications to control caries disease. Future studies 

should investigate the remineralization potential of these composites as well as 

their toxicity to make their incorporation in dental materials feasible. Studies 

considering different approaches to investigate the mechanisms of action of 

these nanocomposites would also be opportune. 

 

CONCLUSION 

In this study, nanocomposites formed by AgNP associated with TMP or 

HMP polyphosphates and very low concentrations of fluoride were synthesized. 

The antimicrobial and anti-biofilm effectiveness of these nanocomposites were 

observed against S. mutans and C. albicans, both relevant dental caries 

pathogens. Furthermore, the results suggest that TMP and HMP improved the 

antimicrobial potential of AgNP, enabling the use of smaller amounts of AgNP to 

produce more biocompatible nanomaterials, which would be effective at 

reducing caries –inducing pathogens and increasing the dental remineralization 

process.

In vitro evaluation of a composite containing sodium trimetaphosphate, 

fluoride and silver nanoparticles on enamel demineralization and 

antibiofilm activity against oral pathogens 

 

ABSTRACT 

Objective: This study developed a nanocomposite of sodium trimetaphosphate 

(TMP), fluoride (F) and silver nanoparticles (Ag) and evaluated its effect on 

enamel demineralization using pH-cycling model, and its effectiveness in single 

and mixed biofilm formation of Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) and 

Strepetococcus mutans (ATCC 25175). Methods: The nanocomposite contains 

the following compounds 0.2% TMP, 100 ppm F, and 10% Ag (100F/TMP/Ag). 

Bovine enamel blocks (4 mm x 4 mm, n=60) selected by the initial surface 

hardness (SHi) were followed allocated (n=12): deionized water (Placebo), 

100ppmF (100F), 225 ppmF (225F), 100ppmF + 0.2%TMP (100F/TMP) and 

100 ppmF + 0.2%TMP + 10%Ag (100F/TMP/Ag). Blocks were treated twice a 

day, and submitted to five pH cycles (demineralizing/remineralizing solutions). 

The surface hardness loss (%SH), integrated loss of subsurface hardness 

(?KHN), fluoride (F) and calcium (Ca) in enamel were measured. The anti-

biofilm effect of 100F/TMP/Ag was assessed through counting of colony forming 

units (CFUs), and structural analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. 

Results: 225F, 100F/TMP and 100F/TMP Ag showed similar values of %SH 

(p&gt; 0.001). 225F, 100F/TMP and 100F/TMP/Ag groups were able to reduce the 

lesion body (?KHN) in the depth of 5-20 ?m. F concentration in enamel was 

similar for 100F/TMP/Ag and 225F (p&gt; 0.001). 100F, 225F, 100F/TMP and 

100F/TMP/Ag presented the highest and the same concentration of Ca (p&gt; 

0.001). 100F/TMP/Ag promoted significant reduction (p&amp;lt;0.001) of  cultivable 

cells of S. mutans of 5.42 and 4.46 log10 in single and mixed biofilms 

respectively, while C. albicans demonstrated more resistance. Conclusion: The 

addition of Ag to F/TMP did not interfere on the demineralization of enamel 

surface and inhibits significantly the biofilm formation regarding to the main 

relevant bacteria of dental caries, stimulating researches including its use in 

prevention or treatment of carious lesions.

INTRODUCTION 

Dental caries is a multifactorial disease and can be considered as a 

consequence of the metabolic activity of the microorganisms present in the 

dental biofilm specially the microorganisms that produce acids, as consequence 

of their expression of factors of virulence [Krzysciak et al., 2014]. The presence 

of biofilm on  dental surface is the indispensable factor for the development of 

this disease [Nyvad et al., 2013]. It is known that Streptococcus mutans is the 

main microorganism involved in the occurrence of caries, since it is capable of 

producing acids and survive in this environmental, synthesizing polysaccharides  

and decreasing the oral pH , being these important virulence factors that lead to 

the demineralization of dental enamel [Fejerskov O, 2005]. Candida albicans, a 

fungus species frequently found in the oral cavity, plays an significant role as a 

secondary agent and it is strong involved in the progression of the caries 

process, since this fungus has the capacity to produce enzymes as factors of 

virulence, specially the proteolytic enzymes which contribute to collagenolysis, 

particularly in dentinal caries [Pereira et al., 2018]. 

In this sense, silver,  present an antimicrobial effect in broad-spectrum 

[Xiu et al., 2012], and has been  tested as antimicrobial agent [Balazs et al., 

2004; Bjarnsholt et al., 2007; Monteiro et al., 2009; Panacek et al., 2006] in 

wound dressings, burn treatments, creams, and coatings on medical devices  to 

prevent the microorganism colonization on the surfaces of these materials. In its 

nanoparticulate form, silver particles (AgNP) have showed considerable 

antimicrobial efficacy for allowing greater contact of its volume and so 

increasing its interaction with bacteria and fungi [Lok CN, 2006; Morones et al., 

2005]. 

The anticaries activity of phosphate salts, specially sodium 

trimetaphosphate (TMP), has already been considered  effective against 

enamel demineralization [Danelon et al., 2014; Manarelli et al., 2011; Takeshita 

et al., 2016; Takeshita et al., 2015; Takeshita et al., 2011]. Takeshita et al 

(2011).[Takeshita et al., 2011] confirmed the potential of TMP as a preventive 

agent  of caries, particularly in cases where fluoride use should be limited. 

Danelon et al (2014).[Danelon et al., 2014], it is ensured that the sodium 

trimetaphosphate supplied  with different concentrations of fluoride (F) was able 

to decrease the mineral loss and increase the remineralization process, due to 



33 
 

its ability to modify the surface of the hydroxyapatite through its adsorption. The 

inhibition of in vitro enamel demineralization was also demonstrated using TMP 

associated to F in mouth rinse by Favretto et al (2013) .[Favretto et al., 2013].  

Thinking in controlling dental caries by inhibiting the demineralization 

process and  modulating oral pathogenic biofilms , it would be opportune to 

develop a composite containing TMP, F and AgNP. So, the objective of this 

study was to synthesize and characterize a nanocomposite with TMP,  F,  and  

AgNP, and to verify its effect on tooth enamel demineralization as well as its 

antimicrobial action in single and dual species of biofilms of Candida albicans 

and Streptococcus mutans.  

 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Synthesis and characterization of sodium trimetaphosphate, fluoride and 

silver nanoparticles  

The synthesis of the nanocomposite with sodium trimetaphosphate 

(TMP),  fluoride (F)  and silver nanoparticles (AgNP) was performed on an 

alcoholic medium (isopropanol) using sodium borohydride (NaBH4, Sigma-

Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as a reductor agent, following the protocol 

proposed by Miranda et al (2010). [Miranda M, 2010] with some modifications. 

Suspensions containing sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP, Sigma-Aldrich, CAS 

7785-84 4), fluoride (NaF, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and silver nitrate 

(AgNO3, Merck) were prepared in the presence of surfactant (ammonium salt of 

polymethacrylic acid (NHPM), Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA). AgNO3 

was employed at 10% of the weight of TMP. The molar proportions between 

TMP  and F was 1.23 : 1 respectively. The nanocomposite was stove-dried 

overnight at 70°C in . The size and morphology of 100F/TMP/Ag (Figure 1) and 

TMP (Figure 2) were investigated by transmission electron microscopy using 

HRTEM TECNAI F 20 Microscope operating at 200 kV. The samples were 

dispersed in isopropanol and deposited onto a carbon coated grid. The 2-D 

images were constructed by analyzing the P K? and Ag L?1 energy emissions 

through Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS).  

 

Compounds formulation and fluoride assessment 



34 
 

The nanocomposite previously synthetized containing 0.2% TMP, Ag at 

10% and 100 ppm F (100F/TMP/Ag) were diluted in deionized water. The 

control solutions used were deionized water, 100 and 225 ppm F (as NaF, 

Merck, CAS 7681-49-4, Germany). A solution containing  0.2% TMP, 100 ppm 

F (100F/TMP) was also prepared. F concentrations [Delbem et al., 2009] of the 

groups containing or not Ag were checked prior to the beginning of the study. 

 

Experimental Design for pH-cycling 

Enamel blocks (4 mm × 4 mm, n=60) were obtained from bovine incisors 

kept in formaldehyde 2% pH 7.0 for 30 days prior to experimental procedures 

[Delbem and Cury, 2002]. Blocks were selected by initial surface hardness test 

(SHi; 320 to 380 KHN) and randomly divided in five experimental solutions 

(n=12 each). They were submitted to a pH-cycling regimen (5 days) and to 

treatments (twice a day) with the following solutions: deionized water (Placebo), 

100 ppm F (100F), 225 ppm F (225F), 100 ppm F plus TMP at concentration of 

0.2% (100F/TMP) and 100 ppm F plus TMP at concentration of 0.2% plus Ag at 

10% (100F/TMP/Ag),. Next, final surface harness (SHf), integrated loss 

subsurface hardness (?KHN), enamel fluoride (F), calcium (Ca) concentration 

were determined. 

 

pH-cycling and treatment with solutions 

The blocks were submittedto five pH cycles during five days (one 

cycle/day), and immersed in a fresh remineralizing solution for two additional 

days [Vieira et al., 2005]. They were immersed under constant stirring in each 

specific solution 1 mL) when removed from the demineralizing (6 hours – Ca 

and P 2,0 mmol L
-1

 in acetate buffer 0,075 mol L
-1

, 0,04 ?g F/mL in pH 4,7 – 2,2 

mL/mm

) and from the remineralizing solutions (18 hours – Ca 1.5 mmol L

-1
, P 

0.9 mmol L
-1

, KCl 0.15 mol L

 in cacodylic buffer 0.02 mol L

, 0. 05 ?g F/mL in 

pH 7,0 – 1,1 mL/mm
2
).  The blocks were washed with deionized water for 30 

seconds.  

 

Analysis of enamel hardness  

Surface hardness was determined with Micromet 5114 hardness tester 

(Buehler, Lake Bluff, USA) and Buehler Omni Met software (Buehler, Lake Bluff, 



35 
 

USA) with a Knoop diamond indenter under a 25 g load for 10s. Five 

indentations, separated by a distance of 100 ?m, were made in the center of 

each block to analyze initial surface hardness (SHi). After the pH-cycling, final 

surface hardness (SHf) was calculated by producing five other indentations 

(100 ?m from the baseline indentations). For cross-sectional hardness 

measurements, blocks were sectioned at the center and one of the halves was 

included in acrylic resin and gradually polished until the enamel was totally 

exposed. One sequence of 14 indentations were created at different distances 

(5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 70, 90, 110, 130, 220, and 330 ?m) from the 

surface of the enamel, in the central region of the blocks, using a Micromet 

5114 hardness tester (Buehler Lake Bluff, IL, USA) with a Knoop diamond 

indenter under a 5-g load for 10 s. Integrated hardness (KHN × µm) for the 

lesion into sound enamel was calculated by the trapezoidal rule (GraphPad 

Prism, version 3.02) and subtracted from the integrated hardness for sound 

enamel to obtain the integrated area of the subsurface regions in enamel, which 

was named integrated loss of subsurface hardness (?KHN; KHN × µm) [Spiguel 

et al., 2009]. 

 

Analysis of F and Ca concentration in the enamel  

Blocks (n=12/per group, 2 mm × 2 mm) were obtained from the halves of 

the original 4 mm × 4 mm specimens not embedded, and fixed with adhesive 

glue on a mandrel for straight. Self-adhesive polishing discs (diameter, 13 mm) 

and 400-grit silicon carbide (Buehler) were fixed to the bottom of polystyrene 

crystal tube (J-10; Injeplast, São Paulo, SP, Brazil). One layer of 50.0 ± 0.03 µm 

each enamel block was removed. The vials, after the addition of 0.5 ml HCl 1.0 

mol L
-1

, were kept under constant stirring for 1 hour [Weatherell et al., 1985], 

modified by Alves et al. [Alves et al., 2007]. For F analysis, specific electrode 

9409BN (Thermo Scientific, Beverly, MA, USA) and microelectrode reference 

(Analyser, São Paulo, Brazil) coupled to an ion analyzer (Orion 720A+, Thermo 

Scientific, Beverly, MA, USA) was used. The electrodes were calibrated with 

standards containing from 0.25 to 4.00 ?g F/mL (100 ppm F, Orion 940907), 

under the same conditions as the samples. The readings were conducted using 

0.25 mL of the biopsy solution, buffered with the same volume of TISAB II 

modified NaOH [Akabane et al., 2018]. The results were expressed in ?g/mm
3
. 



36 
 

Calcium (Ca) analysis was performed using the Arsenazo III colorimetric 

method [Vogel et al., 1983]. The absorbance readings were recorded at 650 nm 

by using a plate reader (PowerWave 340, Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA). The 

results were expressed as mg/mm
3
. 

 

Biofilm formation and treatment 

Biofilms from single and mixed cultures were cultured in 96-well 

microtiter plates (Costar®, Corning Incorporated, Tewksbury, MA,USA). Each 

well received 200 ?l of C. albicans (ATCC 10231) cell suspension (1 × 10
7
 ml 

-1
 

cells in artificial saliva), according to the methodology by Silva et al. [Silva et al., 

2010], and 200 ?l of S. mutans (ATCC 25175) cell suspension (1 × 10
8
 ml

-1
 

cells in artificial saliva), following the study of Arias et al. [Arias et al., 2016], for 

the formation of simple biofilms. For biofilms of mixed species, 100 ?l of each 

suspension (2 × 10
7
 ml

-1
 cells of C. albicans plus 2 × 10

8
 cells ml

-1
 of S. mutans) 

was dispensed into each well. The plates were incubated at 37 ° C for 2 h for 

biofilm adhesion. After this time, the wells containing biofilm were washed once 

with 200 ?l of phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7, 0.1 M) to remove non-

adherent cells. Subsequently, the treatment was carried out by adding 200 ?l of 

artificial saliva containing 100F/TMP/Ag at 40 µg ml
-1

. For positive and negative 

control were used 0.018% Chlorhexidine Gluconate (CHG; Periogard, Colgate 

Palmolive Industrial Ltda, Sao Paulo, Brazil) and artificial saliva. The biofilms 

were then incubated at 37°C for 24 h.  

 

Biofilm quantification 

The colony-forming unit counting test (CFUs) was used to quantify the 

single and mixed biofilms of C. albicans and S. mutans. For thus, biofilm-

containing wells were scraped  and  the suspensions were vortexed and serially 

diluted in PBS and plated on SDA (C. albicans), BHI (S. mutans). For mixed 

biofilm,  microorganisms were plated on CHROMagar (Difco) (C. albicans) and 

BHI supplemented with amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich) (S. mutans) [Fernandes 

et al., 2016]. After this, the agar plates were incubated at 37º C during 24 h for 

C. albicans and 48h for S. mutans. In the next step the number of CFUs was 

counted and log CFU per unit area (log10 CFU cm
-2

) was determined. The tests 

were performed independently and in triplicate. 



37 
 

 

Microscopy 

 The SEM (scanning electron microscopy) was performed to visualize 

changes in the structure of the simple and mixed biofilms submitted to the 

treatment with the nanocomposite. Single and mixed biofilms were formed in 

24-well plates as descrived above. Briefly, after cell adhesion period, the 

nanocomposite, positive and negative controls were added to the wells as 

previously described. After 24 h, the wells were gently washed once with PBS 

and the biofilms were dehydrated according to the protocol of Silva et al 

(2013).[Silva et al., 2013]. The bottom of each well containing  the biofilms was 

then cut with a flame-sterilized scalpel blade (number 11, Solidor, Lamedid 

Comercial e Serviços Ltda, Barueri, Brazil). After this, the samples received a 

gold bath and SEM analysis was performed (S-360 microscope, Leo, 

Cambridge, MA, USA) [Fernandes et al., 2016]. 

 

Statistical analysis 

The analyzes of pH-cycling were performed using SigmaPlot  software 

(version 12.0) (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) and the level of 

statistical significance was set at 5%. The variables% SH and F did not present 

normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk) and homogeneous (Cochran test) and were 

submitted to Kruskal-Wallis followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls comparison 

test. The Ca values were homogeneous (log10 transformation) and were 

submitted to analysis of variance at a criterion followed by the Student-

Newman-Keuls test. For the variable ?KHN, treatments and areas were 

considered as variables of variation. The results showed normal and 

homogeneous distribution and were submitted to analysis of variance at two 

criteria followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. For the biofilm analysis, 

SigmaPlot 12.0 software was also used with a significance level of 5%. The 

quantification of the colony forming units (CFUs) of the simple and mixed 

biofilms passed the Shapiro-Wilks test of normal and homogeneous distribution 

and were subjected to One Way Analysis of Variance. After all the paired data 

were submitted to a multiple comparison protocol by the Holm-Sidak method. 

 

RESULTS 



38 
 

Synthesis and characterization the nanocomposite 

TEM show images of  association  between silver nanoparticles  with 

sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP). Figure 1 shows  silver nanoparticles anchoring 

on the surface of the TMP, in a dispersed and uncrosslinked form.   

The Histogram of TEM image (Figure 1-B) demonstrate the mean size of the Ag 

nanoparticles was 11 nm. Figure 1-A shows silver nanoparticles (gray shades) 

dispersed and decorating the surface of the phosphates at micrometric size 

(white shades)(Figure 1-C). The 2D images were constructed by analyzing the 

energy released from the P K? (constituents of the TMP material) (Figure 1-D) 

and Ag K? (Figure 1-E) emissions, indicating the uniform distribution of these 

elements in the demarcated area in the micrograph.  

The Histogram and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) of the 

commercial TMP indicated the mean size of 72nm and the presence of sodium 

(Na), oxygen (O), phosphorus (P) (Figure 2). 

 

Analysis of superficial (%SH) and tranversal hardness (?KHN), F and Ca 

concentrations 

The mean pH of all solutions was 7.9 (SD 0.1). The mean SH of blocks 

was 360.0 (SD 9.8) KHN (p = 0,533). No significant differences were observed 

among the groups after random allocation (p = 0.474). 

The use of 225F solution resulted in a 40% decrease in %SH in 

comparison with 100F (Table 1). The demineralization of the enamel surface 

was the similar in samples treated with solution containing 225F, 100F/TMP and 

100/TMP/Ag (table 1) (p &gt; 0.001). In addition, the capacity to reduce the lesion 

body (?KHN) was higher with 110F, 225F, 100F/TMP and 100F/TMP/Ag (p &amp;lt;

0.001) in zone A (5–20 ?m) and similar in zone B for 225F and 100F/TMP. The 

100F/TMP/Ag group had greater demineralization in zone B (20–130 ?m) (p &amp;lt;

0.001) (Figure 3). 

A dose-response pattern was observed between F concentrations in the 

solutions not supplemented with TMP/Ag and enamel fluoride uptake. The 

addition of TMP/Ag to the solution did not influence enamel F concentration, so 

that its effect was similar to 225F, except for the Placebo, 100F and 100F/TMP 

which showed a lower concentration (p &amp;lt;0.001). The 100F, 225F, 100F/TMP 



39 
 

and 100F/TMP/Ag groups had the highest and similar Ca concentration (p &gt; 

0.001), followed by Placebo. 

 

Antimicrobial effect 

 Figure 4 shows 100F/TMP/Ag nanocomposite afforded expressive 

reductions of S. mutans cultivables cells of 5.42 and 4.46 log10 respectively in 

single and mixed biofilms. Indeed, those reductions were statistically similar to 

the reduction promoted by chlorhexidine glucanate (PC) regardless if S. mutans 

grew in the presence or not of C. albicans. Figure 4 also suggests S. mutans 

was more tolerant to both 100F/TMP/Ag and PC when its biofilm was formed in 

the presence of C. albicans, increasing the S. mutans cell viability from 0.70 to 

2.29 log10 and from 1.23 to 2.52 log10. It is also noted that C. albicans was more 

resistant to 100F/TMP/Ag and PC in mixed biofilms, increasing the viable cells 

in 0.63 and 1.14 log10 respectively. Although 100F/TMP/Ag has reduced less 

than 0.5 log10 the viable cells of C. albicans in both single and mixed biofilms, 

the 100F/TMP/Ag effectiveness was considered statically significant when 

compared to the negative control. 

 

Microscopy 

Figure 5 shows the treatment with 100F/TMP/Ag nanocomposite was 

effective against single and mixed biofilms of C. albicans and S. mutans, and 

similar to the reduction obtained with treatment with chlorhexidine glucanate 

(positive control). 

 

 

DISCUSSION 

The present study showed that the nanocomposite synthesized  

demonstrated an anticarie and antimicrobial potential. 

The ability of inhibition of demineralization was determined by an in vitro 

model that simulates the caries dynamics through pH cycling [Vieira et al., 

2005]. The concentration of TMP and F chosen was based on previous studies 

[Favretto et al., 2013; Manarelli et al., 2011] where mouth rinse containing 

100ppmF associated with 0.2% TMP also obtained similar results to the mouth 

rinse containing 225 ppm of F against artificial caries lesions [Favretto et al., 



40 
 

2013]. Even featuring no significant difference concentrations of fluoride in the 

enamel as well as in the present study compared to 100 ppm F group, the 

surface and cross-sectional hardness were similar to 225 ppm F group. The 

association of TMP to 100 ppm F has shown that TMP does not further the 

uptake fluoride in the hydroxyapatite [Souza et al., 2013]. Nevertheless it was 

observed an exponential reduction of the loss of Ca when immersed in acid 

solution [Amaral et al., 2018; Souza et al., 2013]. The effect of TMP can be 

related to its capacity to hinder acid diffusion into the enamel [Akabane et al., 

2018; Moretto et al., 2013; Takeshita et al., 2011]  due to two possible reasons. 

First, the formulation with 100 ppm F only reduced the mineral loss in relation to 

placebo with no significance difference of F, and lower Ca, present in the 

enamel when compared to 100F/0.2% TMP group (Table 1). Second, TMP 

does not enhance the deposition of calcium fluoride [Souza et al., 2013], but 

associated to 100 ppm F increased the protective effect against enamel erosion 

[Manarelli et al., 2011]. TMP is adsorbed making a layer on enamel [Akabane et 

al., 2018; Amaral et al., 2018] that alters the selective permeability and diffusion 

of ions into the inner enamel [Akabane et al., 2018; Takeshita et al., 2011]. This 

can explain the lower mineral loss in the deeper of the enamel (Zone B: Table 1 

and Figure 1) and concentration of Ca (Table 1) in the enamel like the 225 ppm 

F. 

The addition of the silver nanoparticles (AgNP) to  the nanocomposite 

was aimed to add  antimicrobial action to TMP-F proportion proven effective 

against enamel demineralization. The concentration of AgNP was based on   

Mendes-Gouvêa et al (2018) [Mendes-Gouvea et al., 2018] In the present 

study, it was found that the addition of silver nanoparticles did not affect the 

demineralization inhibition property of the enamel surface when associated to 

TMP/F, since %SH and ?KHN at zone A (5 – 20 µm; Table 1 and Figure 1) 

presented similar values compared to a conventional 225 ppm F solution. The 

same occurred in relation to the amount of F and Ca at ~50 ?m of depth from 

the surface of the enamel (table 1) for 100F/TMP/Ag solution, which obtained 

values were close to the solution of 225 ppm F. The best effect of the group 225 

ppm F compared to 100 ppm F was dependent of the F uptake in the enamel. In 

the case of 100F/0.2% TMP, it was dependent on the ability of TMP to reduce 

the acid diffusion into the enamel. However, it appears that the product 



41 
 

deposited from the nanocomposite on the outer layer of the enamel does not 

avoid deep mineral loss in the enamel. Probably, the product formed with Ag 

may have a restricted effect on the outermost layer of the enamel and, when 

associated with TMP, may affect its adsorption on the enamel.  

Although there are no studies showing the association of Ag, TMP and F, 

other studies have already tested the action of the Ag with F in the enamel 

demineralization and remineralization [Delbem et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2012; 

Nozari et al., 2017; Punyanirun et al., 2018; Zhi et al., 2013]. These studies 

agree that mechanism of action of Ag/F is due to deposition of calcium fluoride 

and silver phosphate on enamel. This coating formed on enamel from of the Ag 

and F would work as a source of F and PO4 inducing the precipitation of 

fluorapatite and producing superior enamel remineralization [Punyanirun et al., 

2018; Zhi et al., 2013]. Nevertheless, the majority of studies do not show an 

additional effect of Ag when associated with F [Delbem et al., 2006; Liu et al., 

2012; Zhi et al., 2013], mainly in the deeper region of the enamel. The studies 

that show an adjunct effect of Ag analyzed the enamel by micro-computed 

tomography [Punyanirun et al., 2018] or only determined the surface hardness 

[Nozari et al., 2017]. Indeed, the Ag ions which penetrated into the enamel [Liu 

et al., 2012; Nozari et al., 2017; Zhi et al., 2013] may be responsible by the 

increase in mineral density in depth of the lesions not signifying true 

remineralization [Liu et al., 2012; Zhi et al., 2013]. It seems that the deposits of 

Ag and F formed would produce a great mineralization in the outer of the 

enamel as observer in the present study (zone A: 5 – 20 µm; Table 1 and 

Figure1). 

Nevertheless, these layers do not hinder acid diffusion into the enamel 

and the mineral loss in the inner of the enamel (zone B: 20 – 130 µm). It is 

important to say that the studies cited above used Ag in its ionic form at 38% 

and the present study tested nanocomposites with silver nanoparticles at 10%. 

Thus, the products formed on enamel from the nanocomposite may contain 

differences that influenced the results. Of the three groups with similarity in the 

%SH results (Table 1) showed no difference in the concentration of calcium in 

the enamel. However, the higher presence of fluoride in the enamel was 

observed for formulation with more F (225 ppm F) or with AgNP added 

(100/TMP/Ag). Despite this, the greater mineral loss with the nanocomposite in 



42 
 

depth in the enamel can be explained by two probable reasons. First, the 

presence of AgNP in the TMP/F formulation may have reduced the TMP 

adsorption on the enamel. TMP is able to hinder acid penetration into the 

enamel as described above. Second, the layer formed by products from AgNP 

and F did not block acid diffusion since the mineral loss in the deeper of the 

lesion occurred. However, nanocomposite should be tested in in situ and in vivo 

studies since it presented the antimicrobial effect and the mineral loss may be 

lower than observed in the pH-cycling model. 

It is worth mentioning that one of the limitations of in vitro pH cycling 

models is that it can not represent with fidelity the complex reactions that occur 

in the oral environment. In this study, we sought to correlate the effect of 

enamel demineralization reduction with the ability to inhibit the formation of 

biofilms by microorganisms responsible for acid secretion that results in caries 

lesion. Thus, we tested this compound against simple and mixed biofilms of the 

bacterial specie Streptococcus mutans and the fungal specie Candida albicans. 

The association of sodium trimethaphosphate (TMP), fluoride (F) and 

AgNPs was able to produce a nanocomposite with antimicrobial action against 

the formation of biofilms of two important oral pathogens Candida albicans and 

Streptococcus mutans, regardless if it were in single or dual species forms. The 

results of our previous study  [Mendes-Gouvea et al., 2018] demonstrated the 

association of TMP-Ag did not reduce the inhibition potential of AgNP against C. 

albicans and S. mutans. Conversely, the highest effectiveness was displayed 

when AgNP were in TMP in particular against S. mutans. It is noteworthy that 

100F/TMP/Ag was also expressively effective to prevent the biofilm growth of S. 

mutans, reducing more than 99.999% the bioflm formation of this Gram positive 

bacteria. This highest inhibitory biofilm growth could be ascribed to alteration of 

the surface of AgNP when associated with TMP, producing more imperfections 

on there and the increase of the AgNP reactivity which leads on disruption of 

some molecules, and hence enabling the „membranolytic effect? when in contact 

with microorganisms cells [Richter et al., 2017]. It is also known that AgNP may 

adhere to the microorganism outer membrane [Li et al., 2008] or the Ag
+
 

released could break the membrane [M., 2013], leading to intracellular damages 

and death of the cell. The concentration of Ag in 100F/TMP/Ag was the same 

used in our previous work [Mendes-Gouvea et al., 2018] of 40 µg/mL and could 



43 
 

be able to reduce 4.2 log10 24h old- biofilm cells of S. mutans. The difference 

between the results in inhibiting the biofilm growth of S. mutans and C. albicans 

may either credited by the increase of the permeability of the external 

membrane of S. mutans by 100F/TMP/Ag due to the sequestration of divalent 

cations by TMP [Akhtar et al., 2008; Maier et al., 1999; Mendes-Gouvea et al., 

2018; Obritsch et al., 2008] that would permit the passage of Ag into the 

membranes and so damage to the bacterial cell by DNA replication loss and 

inactivation of some proteins [Feng et al., 2000; Mendes-Gouvea et al., 2018]. 

Further one, the higher efficacy of 100F/TMP combinated with AgNP against S. 

mutans might be due to the buffer effect promoted by that polyphosphate, 

increasing the pH of the acidic environment of S mutans biofilm and so 

interfering on its development [Mendes-Gouvea et al., 2018]. 

Although AgNP with no F/TMP had not been compared with 

100F/TMP/Ag, our previous study could demonstrate TMP increased the action 

of AgNP against single 24h old-biofilms of both microorganisms C. albicans 

(ATCC 10231) and S. mutans (ATCC 25175). Again, S. mutans cells were more 

susceptible to TMP-AgNP nanocomposite than cells of C. albicans, and it could 

be explained by the change of the AgNP crystallographic surface structures 

when it is in combination with TMP [Mendes-Gouvea et al., 2018; Pal et al., 

2007]. The TEM images elucidate how AgNP are arranged in the compound. 

They are anchored in a dispersive way on the TMP surface, and it could confirm 

the modification on the crystallography physical-chemical property of AgNP.  

In spite of the preliminary anti-biofilm formation experiment performed in 

this study, of note should be the antibacterial potential demonstrated by 

100F/TMP/Ag especially considering the low concentration of Ag  and the 

relevance role of S. mutans in the dental caries process. Likewise, since both 

pathogens S. mutans and C. albicans present virulence factors on progressive 

caries, it is of relevance to control their presence in the oral cavity. The 

nanocomposite produced in the present study aggregate the properties of TMP 

and F in reducing the demineralization process on enamel surface as well as 

the antimicrobial action of Ag. Further studies with in situ and in vivo 

approaches are strongly encouraged in the sense of confirming the therapeutic 

potential of TMP and other polyphosphates/F associated with AgNP in 



44 
 

preventing the most prevalent chronic oral disease in whole world, which is the 

dental caries.

Note: The multiple comparisons on ranks do not include an adjustment for ties. 

 

A result of  "Do Not Test" occurs for a comparison when no significant difference is found between the 

two rank sums that enclose that comparison.  For example, if you had four rank sums sorted in order, and 

found no significant difference between rank sums  4 vs. 2, then you would not test 4 vs. 3 and 3 vs. 2, 

but still test 4 vs. 1 and 3 vs. 1 (4 vs. 3 and 3 vs. 2 are enclosed by 4 vs. 2: 4 3 2 1).  Note that not testing 

the enclosed rank sums is a procedural rule, and a result of Do Not Test should be treated as if there is no 

significant difference between the rank sums, even though one may appear to exist.
