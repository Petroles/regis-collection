Abstract  

Dryland ecosystems are characterised by high aridity levels and extremely low precipitation rates, 

being highly vulnerable to desertification and land degradation (DLD) due to these high aridity levels 

and considerable human pressure. Such vulnerability is expected to increase under a climate change 

scenario predicting a general increase in aridity, temperatures, frequency of extreme events and an 

accentuated decrease of precipitation. A significant proportion of drylands can be found within 

Mediterranean ecosystems, which have been experiencing a marked expansion of semi-arid climate in 

recent years due to climate change. This is becoming particularly alarming in the Iberian Peninsula, 

mainly in the southern Portuguese regions of Alentejo and Algarve. Drylands’ DLD susceptibility will 

lead to a significant decrease in ecosystems’ productivity, calling for the implementation of adaptation 

strategies. Reforestation with holm-oak (Quercus ilex), cork-oak (Quercus suber) and stone-pine (Pinus 

pinea) native species is a restoration practice that has been widely used in southern Portuguese drylands 

for the last sixty years. However, there are several lacunae concerning the evaluation of reforestation’s 

characteristics and success, which have not yet been properly evaluated, while it is also quite unusual to 

have recourse to animal indicators to perform such evaluation.  

The present work aims to understand whether the European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus - 

Linnaeus, 1758) is a good indicator of the success of historical reforestations in southern Portuguese 

drylands. The wild rabbit is a multifunctional keystone species in Mediterranean ecosystems, especially 

in the Iberian Peninsula, due to the multiplicity of relevant roles and impacts it has in habitat’s structure 

and complexity as ecosystem engineers and “landscape shapers”, and as a main prey for a wide range 

of major predators, many of which are emblematic endangered species. Therefore, the wild rabbit 

exhibits several favourable conditions for being a good ecological indicator.  

In this work, the wild rabbit’s relative abundance was estimated within holm-oak, cork-oak and 

stone-pine reforestation sites along an aridity gradient through southern regions of continental Portugal 

through latrine counting along foot-transects, using the number of latrines to calculate wild rabbits’ 

Kilometric Abundance Index (KAI) for each sampling site. The relation between wild rabbits’ relative 

abundance and environmental parameters representative of habitat’s structure and complexity within 

reforestations (vegetation, soil and climate characterisation performed by the AdaptforChange Project’s 

research team, which examined the success of such reforestations) was evaluated, to determine whether 

the wild rabbit performs relevant roles in reforestations’ ecosystems, thus having the potential to be a 

good indicator of the success of Portuguese dryland reforestations. Spearman correlations were 

performed to identify possible relations between wild rabbit and reforestation variables, as well as 

ANOVA analysis to test the effects between environmental parameters and rabbit variables. 

Furthermore, buffers and land use cartography were carried out for each sampling site to understand 

how the composition and structure of the landscape may influence the presence and abundance of the 

wild rabbit in the study area. Spearman correlations were carried out between rabbit variables and 

habitat/landscape variables (areas and percentages of occupation of each land-use class).  

The lack of association between rabbits’ abundance, environmental parameters associated with 

reforestations and plantation areas determines that, unfortunately, the wild rabbit is indeed not a good 

indicator of the success of reforestations in southern Portuguese drylands. The wild rabbit’s current 

distribution and density situation in the Iberian Peninsula prevents the species from acting as a good 

ecological indicator, which is reinforced and confirmed by our results. Therefore, management and 

recovery measures should be taken so that the species can regain a fundamental role as an ecological 

indicator.

Resumo  

As drylands são ecossistemas que ocupam aproximadamente metade da superfície terrestre, sendo 

caracterizadas por elevados índices de aridez e taxas de precipitação extremamente reduzidas. As dry-

lands incluem áreas que estão sob influência dos climas árido, semiárido e seco sub-húmido, sendo 

altamente susceptíveis à desertificação e degradação das terras devido aos elevados índices de aridez e 

considerável ocupação e pressão humana.  

Uma considerável proporção de drylands pode ser encontrada nos ecossistemas mediterrânicos, 

particularmente na bacia do Mediterrâneo. Nos últimos anos, estes ecossistemas têm sofrido uma ex-

pansão significativa do clima semiárido em resultado das alterações climáticas. Esta situação tem-se 

tornado particularmente relevante e preocupante na Península Ibérica, nomeadamente no sudeste de 

Portugal continental, nas regiões do Alentejo e Algarve, que têm sofrido uma expansão dos climas se-

miárido e seco sub-húmido.  

A elevada susceptibilidade destas regiões à desertificação e degradação será agravada num cená-

rio atual de alterações climáticas que prevê um aumento generalizado dos índices de aridez, das tempe-

raturas, da ocorrência e intensidade de fenómenos extremos e decréscimo acentuado da precipitação. 

Essa susceptibilidade acrescida conduzirá certamente a uma redução significativa da produtividade bi-

ológica e económica dos ecossistemas, apelando à tomada de estratégias de adaptação no sentido de 

mitigar os efeitos das alterações climáticas, através da promoção da resiliência dos ecossistemas e mi-

nimização das suas vulnerabilidades aos efeitos climáticos adversos. 

A floresta contribuirá nesse sentido ao desempenhar um importante papel no sequestro de car-

bono, regulação climática, promoção e conservação da biodiversidade, complexidade do habitat, solo e 

água, auxiliando na minimização dos efeitos climáticos adversos, na prevenção da desertificação e de-

gradação e no aumento da resiliência dos ecossistemas a eventos extremos, de modo que estes possam 

continuar a produzir bens e serviços com importância económica, ambiental e social.  

Deste modo, a reflorestação com espécies autóctones, como sejam a azinheira (Quercus ilex), o 

sobreiro (Quercus suber) e o pinheiro-manso (Pinus pinea), é um importante método de restauro ecoló-

gico de ecossistemas degradados que tem sido praticado no sudeste semiárido português, em regiões 

não-produtivas ou agrícolas abandonadas, no decurso dos últimos 40 a 60 anos. As espécies autóctones 

são ideais neste contexto dada a sua excepcional resiliência e capacidade de adaptação a climas áridos, 

conseguindo atenuar efeitos climáticos adversos. Apesar disso, reflorestações com espécies nativas em 

regiões semiáridas estão geralmente associadas a reduzidas probabilidades de sucesso, dado o reduzido 

crescimento das árvores e elevada mortalidade das plântulas nos primeiros anos de vida, sob condições 

de secura extrema e escassez hídrica.  

Em Portugal, existem diversas lacunas no que concerne a avaliação das características, do estado 

atual e até do sucesso das reflorestações realizadas no semiárido, não tendo ocorrido ainda uma avalia-

ção integrada e sistemática das mesmas. As poucas avaliações que são realizadas restringem-se frequen-

temente ao estudo da estrutura, crescimento e funcionamento das comunidades vegetais, sendo pouco 

usual o recurso a indicadores animais para tal avaliação.  

O presente trabalho teve assim por objetivo determinar se o coelho-bravo (Oryctolagus cuniculus 

- Linnaeus, 1758) é um bom indicador do sucesso de reflorestações realizadas no semiárido histórico 

português no decurso das últimas décadas.  

O coelho-bravo é uma espécie-chave nos ecossistemas mediterrânicos, especialmente na Penín-

sula Ibérica, devido à multiplicidade de papéis e efeitos relevantes que desempenha a nível da estrutura, 

funcionamento, dinâmica e complexidade nesses habitats. Eles são importantes engenheiros de ecossis-

temas e desempenham um papel preponderante enquanto modeladores da paisagem, dada a sua influ-

ência e efeitos significativos a nível da composição e estrutura da vegetação e capacidade incrível de 



 

iv 

produzir alterações relevantes na paisagem. Além disto, estão na base das cadeias tróficas mediterrâni-

cas, constituindo a presa principal de um alargado leque de predadores de topo, sendo que alguns são 

espécies emblemáticas ameaçadas (lince-ibérico, águia-imperial-ibérica e abutre-preto), sendo impor-

tantes a nível da dinâmica das cadeias alimentares pela influência que têm nas flutuações nas populações 

de predadores. Além disso, as paisagens heterogéneas mediterrânicas compostas por mosaicos de áreas 

florestadas de azinheira e sobreiro intercaladas com patches de arbustos e regiões abertas (áreas agríco-

las, prados e pastagens) constituem os habitats ideais para o coelho, uma vez que lhe permitem optimizar 

o esforço da procura de alimento (em regiões abertas ricas em plantas herbáceas e cereais) e minimizar 

o risco de predação (nas regiões fechadas, como as florestais e com arbustos para proteção).  

Deste modo, e dada a estrita relação entre a presença e abundância do coelho-bravo e a estrutura 

e complexidade do habitat, o coelho-bravo reúne todas as características favoráveis para ser um bom 

indicador ecológico.  

Neste trabalho, a abundância relativa de coelho-bravo foi estimada num total de vinte e três re-

florestações de Quercus suber, Quercus ilex e Pinus pinea localizadas no semiárido histórico português, 

nas regiões do Alentejo e Algarve, ao longo de um gradiente de aridez. A abundância relativa do coelho 

foi estimada através da contagem de latrinas ao longo de transetos lineares, tendo sido posteriormente 

usado o número total de latrinas detectadas e a distância total percorrida para calcular o Índice Quilo-

métrico de Abundância (IQA) para cada ponto de amostragem.  

Foi posteriormente avaliada a relação entre a abundância relativa de coelho-bravo e parâmetros 

ambientais representativos da estrutura e complexidade do habitat das reflorestações (dados resultantes 

da caracterização da vegetação, solo e clima realizados pela equipa de investigação do Projeto Nacional 

AdaptforChange, que avaliou o sucesso de reflorestações realizadas no semiárido histórico português). 

Tais relações foram avaliadas no sentido de determinar se o coelho-bravo desempenha papéis relevantes 

nos ecossistemas associados às reflorestações, logo se pode ser classificado como um bom indicador do 

sucesso de reflorestações em regiões semiáridas portuguesas.  

Foram realizadas correlações de Spearman para identificar possíveis relações entre as variáveis 

associadas ao coelho-bravo e as variáveis ambientais associadas às reflorestações, bem como Análises 

de Variância (ANOVA) para testar os efeitos entre determinados parâmetros ambientais, como sejam o 

tipo dominante de reflorestação, a presença de Pinus pinea, a distribuição espacial dos arbustos e o tipo 

de solo dominante, e o conjunto de variáveis relativas ao coelho-bravo.  

Para além disso, foram realizados buffers com um raio de 250 metros para cada um dos pontos de 

amostragem, tendo sido posteriormente elaborada uma cartografia ao nível da ocupação e usos do solo, 

essencialmente focada nos tipos de coberto vegetal (plantações dominadas por Quercus ou por Pinus; 

montados; prados e pastagens; matos), presença de água (massas de água) e indícios de presença e ocu-

pação humana (habitações e pomares; infra-estruturas; ruínas e poços abandonados; estradas alcatroa-

das), para os buffers previamente obtidos. A cartografia foi elaborada com o intuito de realizar uma 

análise da diversidade de usos do solo, e assim perceber como a composição e estrutura da paisagem 

influenciam a presença e abundância de coelho-bravo na área de estudo. Foram realizadas correlações 

de Spearman para determinar as relações entre as variáveis relativas ao coelho-bravo e as variáveis de 

habitat (áreas e percentagens de ocupação de cada classe de uso do solo).  

Apesar da área de estudo apresentar uma paisagem heterogénea composta por mosaicos de dife-

rentes habitats sendo as plantações o uso do solo dominante, e de se terem verificado algumas relações 

significativas entre a abundância de coelho e variáveis de habitat, a verdade é que não se verificou 

nenhuma relação significativa com as plantações. A ausência de associação significativa entre a abun-

dância relativa de coelho-bravo, as variáveis ambientais associadas à estrutura e complexidade das re-

florestações e as áreas das plantações determina que, infelizmente, o coelho-bravo não é efetivamente 

um bom indicador do sucesso de reflorestações nas drylands do sudeste de Portugal continental. Apesar 



 

v 

do coelho-bravo reunir todos os requisitos necessários para ser um bom indicador ecológico, a verdade 

é que ele acaba por não o ser na Península Ibérica, especialmente em Portugal, dada a sua atual distri-

buição desigual e as suas densidades extremamente variáveis e altamente fragmentadas ao longo do 

território de Portugal e Espanha. Esta situação é o resultado infeliz de um declínio massivo nas popula-

ções desta espécie no decurso das últimas décadas, principalmente devido à perda e fragmentação do 

seu habitat, da emergência de doenças virais (Mixomatose e Doença Hemorrágica Viral), e mortalidade 

por interferência humana, particularmente devido à caça. Desta forma, o número reduzido de efetivos 

nas populações impede que o coelho seja um bom indicador, e os resultados deste trabalho infelizmente 

corroboram esta constatação.  

Dada a situação delicada do coelho-bravo na Península Ibérica, o seu estatuto de espécie-chave 

multifuncional nos ecossistemas mediterrânicos apela à tomada urgente de medidas destinadas à gestão 

e recuperação das suas populações, com vista ao restabelecimento do seu papel fundamental como in-

dicador ecológico num futuro próximo.

1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

1.1 - Drylands &amp;amp; Reforestations in Mediterranean semi-arid regions  

A brief overview of drylands’ main features and vulnerabilities 

Drylands are characterised by high aridity levels which encompass hyper-arid (Aridity Index 

lower than 0.05), arid (Aridity Index between 0.05 and 0.20), semi-arid (aridity ranging from 0.20 to 

0.50) and dry sub-humid (aridity gradient from 0.50 to 0.65) areas (MEA 2005a; Reynolds et al. 2007) 

and extremely low precipitation rates, in accordance with the Aridity Index of the United Nations Envi-

ronment Programme (UNEP), and in relation to the ratio between annual mean precipitation and annual 

potential evapotranspiration (Middleton &amp;amp; Thomas 1997; Nunes 2017).   

Drylands occupy almost 50% of the Earth’s land surface (6.15×106 ha), distributed throughout 

four continents, covering from 31% (South America) to 75% (Australia) of the continental land area, 

and are inhabited by more than 38% of the total global population (Figure 1.1) (Reynolds &amp;amp; Stafford 

Smith 2002; Reynolds et al. 2007; UNCCD 2012).  

This type of land is extremely vulnerable to desertification and land degradation (DLD) due to 

high aridity levels coupled with intense human occupation, pressure, and land cover changes over past 

decades, such as removal of vegetation caused by land-use intensification for crop production, agricul-

ture, grazing, and deforestation (Belo et al. 2009; Cortina &amp;amp; Maestre 2005; MEA 2005a; MEA 2005b; 

Middleton &amp;amp; Thomas 1997; Príncipe et al. 2014; UNCCD 2012). These factors unfortunately contribute 

to a significant decrease or even loss of ecosystem functionality, composition and biological or eco-

nomic productivity over time (Costa et al. 2008; Príncipe et al. 2014; UNCCD 2012), which directly 

influences their provision of ecosystem services (MEA 2005a). Besides being extremely vulnerable to 

DLD effects, drylands are also highly vulnerable to climate change (Nunes 2017; Reynolds et al. 2007). 

Drylands amidst Mediterranean regions in a climate change perspective 

A considerable proportion of drylands is found within Mediterranean ecosystems, such as the 

Mediterranean Basin (where approximately 67% of the territory is occupied by drylands) (Nunes 2017; 

Nunes et al. 2016b; Príncipe et al. 2014). Their DLD susceptibility is expected to increase under a 

climate change scenario that estimates an accentuated increase of average temperatures, a decrease in 

rainfall and shifts in precipitation frequency and patterns, more frequent and severe occurrence of ex-

treme events (heat waves, droughts and storms), and higher aridity levels, for the Southeastern

subtypes. Adapted from MEA 2005b.

Mediterranean, especially in Europe and in the Iberian Peninsula (Costa et al. 2008; ICNF 2013; IPCC 

2014; MEA 2005a; Miranda et al. 2006).  

Over the past decades, a significant expansion of semi-arid climate has been occurring in Medi-

terranean ecosystems, mainly due to climate change (Köbel et al. 2017; Nunes et al. 2016a). 

This situation is unfortunately gaining relevance in the Iberian Peninsula, especially in the south-

east Alentejo and Algarve regions of Portugal, in which a significative expansion of both semi-arid and 

dry sub-humid climate over past years has been occurring (Figure 1.2) (Costa et al. 2008; Köbel et al. 

2017; Nunes et al. 2016a). This expansion in the Portuguese territory is mainly due to a global increase 

of temperatures that has been under way since 1970, responsible for more frequent and intense drought 

events, storms and heavy rainfall periods, and decreased precipitation rates within irregular rainfall re-

gimes (MAMAOT 2013; Miranda et al. 2006; Nunes et al. 2016a; Príncipe et al. 2014).  

Given drylands’ enhanced vulnerability under this scenario, especially in southern Portuguese 

regions, it is vital to adopt adaptation strategies, such as the restoration of degraded ecosystems, to mit-

igate climate change effects and minimize ecosystems’ vulnerabilities under climate constraints (Cortina 

&amp;amp; Maestre 2005; MAMAOT 2013; Nunes et al. 2016a; Vizinho 2015). This can be achieved through 

the promotion of ecosystem species and habitats’ resilience, adaptation, and sustainability, and of eco-

system services and assets’ provision (providing products related to economic welfare such as wood and 

cork) (MAMAOT 2013; Nunes et al. 2016a; Pereira et al. 2009; Vizinho 2015). 

Reforestation with native species - restoration strategy for drylands under climate change  

Among ecological restoration programs concerning plant species, reforestations with native 

species is a frequently used forestry management strategy, as it helps to ameliorate desertification and 

land degradation effects on drylands and promote their resilience and adaptation capacities to climate 

change (AdaptforChange 2015; Köbel et al. 2017; MAMAOT 2013; Nunes et al. 2016a; Pereira et al. 

2009; Príncipe et al. 2014). 

Autochthonous forests play fundamental roles in support services, such as primary productivity, 

and in regulation services - soil erosion’s prevention and protection through plant cover; facilitation of 

carbon sequestration within plant biomass and in the soil; climatic regulation; increase of biodiversity,

organic matter, habitat complexity, water infiltration in the soil, productivity; decrease in the risk of fires 

and the incidence of plagues and diseases; and promotion of a wider production of ecosystem assets and 

services with economic, environmental and social relevance (Köbel et al. 2017; MAMAOT 2013; Nunes 

2017; Pereira et al. 2009; Príncipe et al. 2014).  

Reforesting wide dryland areas with different native species will contribute to a major increase 

of tree cover and a wider diversity of species, which is fundamental to mitigate aridity effects and to 

potentiate forestry ecosystems’ resilience in the face of extreme events. These forests promote the re-

covery of the structure, composition and function of such ecosystems so they can continue producing 

assets and services with higher economic return (Cortina &amp;amp; Maestre 2005; Köbel et al. 2017; Nunes 

2017; Pereira et al. 2009; Príncipe et al. 2014; Rey Benayas &amp;amp; Camacho-Cruz 2004). On the other hand, 

they will also help revert downshifts in tree growth and natural regeneration among forest settlements 

in highly susceptible dryland areas (Middleton &amp;amp; Thomas 1997; Príncipe et al. 2014; Silva 2012).  

Native species have an exceptional adaptation and resistance to arid climates, making them highly 

suitable for reforestations undertaken in dryland ecosystems, as they can attenuate negative climatic 

effects imposed by high aridity levels and decreased precipitation rates (Köbel et al. 2017; Príncipe et 

al. 2014).  

According to a global survey of dryland reforestations, a significant number of reforestation pro-

jects have been carried out within these regions for the restoration of degraded ecosystems. Such projects 

have been performed both worldwide and across the Mediterranean Basin, with emphasis in the Iberian 

Peninsula’s dryland areas (Figure 1.3) (Nunes et al. 2016b). 

Forestry &amp;amp; reforestation policies in the Portuguese territory  

For millennia, holm-oaks and cork-oaks were the dominant woodlands system within continental 

Portugal, and were used for the harvesting of economically and industrially valuable resources in re-

sponse to the demands of industry and urban centres (wood, cork, fibre, among others). However, until 

the middle of the 20th century, rural populations converted such forested areas into subsistence agricul-

tural fields and livestock grazing areas (Pereira et al. 2009; Príncipe et al. 2014). Throughout the fol-

lowing years, the economic return associated with such activities ceased and so those areas became 

unproductive, which led to their abandonment and to an increase in rural exodus (Nunes et al. 2016a; 

Pereira et al. 2009; Príncipe et al. 2014).  

Such non-productive agricultural and grazing lands or marginal terrains were later converted to 

forested areas, especially since Portugal’s entry in the European Union (Nunes et al. 2016a; Pereira et 

Figure 1.3 - Reforestation restoration projects carried out in the Mediter-

ranean Basin within dryland and non-dryland areas.

al. 2009; Príncipe et al. 2014). This was mainly due to higher private investments related to economic 

interests, to the promotion of afforestation initiatives and to forests’ natural regeneration (Köbel et al. 

2017; MAMAOT 2013). Nowadays forests are indeed the dominant form of land use in continental 

Portugal, occupying 35.4% of the territory, one of the highest afforestation rates within the European 

Union (ICNF 2013; ICNF 2014; Köbel et al. 2017; MAMAOT 2013).  

Reforestations with native species within Southern Portuguese drylands  

The Portuguese government, along with the Instituto da Conservação da Natureza e Florestas 

(ICNF), the Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente (APA), landowners, national park managers, municipali-

ties, Environmental Non-Governmental Agencies (ENGOs), and private and public companies, have 

been promoting and implementing in the last forty to sixty years several reforestation initiatives with 

cork-oak (Quercus suber), holm-oak (Quercus ilex) and stone-pine (Pinus pinea) native species (Köbel 

et al. 2017; MAMAOT 2013; Nunes et al. 2016a; Príncipe et al. 2014). Such reforestations, a vital 

component of the National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change (ENAAC), have been carried out 

in non-productive or abandoned agricultural and grazing areas with higher aridity (semiarid and dry sub-

humid areas), particularly in the southeast region of the Alentejo (Figure 1.4) (Köbel et al. 2017; Nunes 

et al. 2016a; Príncipe et al. 2014).  

According to the National Forestry Inventory, in 2010 there were 328 578 ha occupied by refor-

estations of holm-oak, 730 399 ha of cork-oak and finally 173 716 ha of stone-pine trees (ICNF 2016, 

cited by Köbel et al. 2017). Reforestation projects that were submitted between 2013 and 2016 encom-

passed a total of 53 659 ha that were reforested, and from these, 8 432 ha were occupied by cork-oak 

(16%), 4 887 ha by stone-pine (9%), while only 1 029 ha by holm-oak (2%). There was a total of 280 

projects that were approved and validated in the Alentejo region, occupying a total area of 6 101 ha 

(ICNF 2016, cited by Köbel et al. 2017; Nunes et al. 2016a). Many reforestation efforts took place in 

the sub-region of Alentejo Interior, such as holm-oak reforestations undertaken in 1995 and 2009 in the 

Herdade da Contenda (Príncipe et al. 2014; Rey Benayas &amp;amp; Camacho-Cruz 2004; Silva 2012).  

Holm-oak, cork-oak and stone-pine are the most commonly used species for the restoration of 

woodlands in Mediterranean ecosystems (ICNF 2014; Nunes 2017; Oliet et al. 2015; Príncipe et al. 

2014; Ramos et al. 2015), due to their exceptionally high resilience to drought events, being physiolog-

ically adapted to water scarcity (ICNF 2014; MAMAOT 2013), and since they are extensively

distributed and considerably abundant within drier Mediterranean areas (Belo et al. 2009; Bravo-Oviedo 

&amp;amp; Montero 2005; MAMAOT 2013; Pereira et al. 2009; Ramos et al. 2015).  

Investing in differential reforestation activities and practices and in more than one tree species 

will considerably reduce the risks of both forest settlements’ failure and of ecological and economic 

losses under a more arid scenario (AdaptforChange 2015; ICNF 2014).   

Low success rates of reforestation &amp;amp; natural regeneration in Portuguese drylands 

Unfortunately, most of the reforestation efforts carried out within southern Portuguese drylands 

proved to be unsuccessful in the long term or at least had a very minimal success rate, which is consistent 

with the extremely low success rates and prominent failure of most reforestation programs carried out 

for the ecological restoration of Mediterranean drylands (Oliet et al. 2015; Príncipe et al. 2014).  

Mediterranean dryland reforestations’ low success rates or even failure is mainly due to climatic 

constraints imposed by high aridity, summer droughts, and high variability in rainfall regimes coupled 

with water scarcity (Príncipe et al. 2014; Rey Benayas &amp;amp; Camacho-Cruz 2004; Silva 2012). The latter 

greatly improve stressing effects in plants and are responsible for trees’ limited survival, growth and 

productivity during the first years after planting, and for restricted tree recruitment (ICNF 2014; 

MAMAOT 2013; Oliet et al. 2015; Príncipe et al. 2014), as well as for extremely low rates of natural 

tree regeneration related to the slow growth and high seedling mortality rates (ICNF 2014; Príncipe et 

al. 2014; Rey Benayas &amp;amp; Camacho-Cruz 2004; Silva 2012).  

Afforestations’ success evaluation - limitations, difficulties &amp;amp; weaknesses  

In Portugal, information regarding reforestation characteristics, results, and even their success 

rates are extremely scarce and dispersed, mainly due to the limitations and difficulties associated with 

the use of a very heterogeneous set of reforestation and evaluation methodologies in different macrocli-

matic areas (Köbel et al. 2017; Nunes et al. 2016a). In fact, until now there has been no proper systematic 

and integrated evaluation of the success associated with different Portuguese dryland afforestations per-

formed in recent years.  

Ecological restoration success evaluations are essentially focused on the structure and functioning 

of plant communities (Mexia 2008), and as such, these evaluations are usually restricted to punctual 

inspections or evaluations concerning tree density, as to guarantee the maintenance of a certain mini-

mum tree density that is required for the preservation and viability of afforestations (Köbel et al. 2017; 

Nunes et al. 2016a).  

For these cases, evaluations were restricted since they only concerned the establishment and 

growth of planted trees, without considering the potential effects and impacts of reforestation actions 

upon ecosystems’ parameters - such as the natural regeneration of trees, plant diversity and productivity 

and soil quality, functionality and sustainability, and evaluation of the impacts of climatic constraints 

related to more arid conditions and lower water availability in afforestations. From this perspective, an 

efficient and successful evaluation of Portuguese afforestations is lacking, and it is vital not only to 

understand whether reforestations are fulfilling the objectives proposed for the arid areas, but also to 

evaluate their resilience under a climate change scenario (Köbel et al. 2017).

Project AdaptforChange - finding ways to improve reforestation success in semi-arid lands 

The Project AdaptforChange is a National Research Project carried out in 2015 and 2016 that has 

aimed to assess the status and the degree of success of historical reforestations with native species: holm-

oak (Quercus ilex subsp. rotundifolia); cork-oak (Quercus suber), and stone-pine (Pinus pinea), imple-

mented in southern Portuguese drylands along an aridity gradient, in order to understand in which ways 

reforestation practices and environmental conditions (such as climate) affect the ecosystem (Köbel et 

al. 2017; Nunes et al. 2016a). 

To evaluate reforestation success, the relationship between certain ecosystem parameters (tree, 

shrub and herbaceous diversity and productivity; natural tree regeneration; soil quality; structural habitat 

diversity; ecosystem services [including biodiversity evaluations]), and climatic data (mainly aridity, 

since climate imposes strong constrains on plant development in the study area) was evaluated for a set 

of holm-oak, cork-oak and stone pine reforestations throughout the Alentejo region (Köbel et al. 2017; 

Nunes et al. 2016a). 

The results obtained have demonstrated that both reforestation practices and environmental con-

ditions play vital roles in shaping the ecosystem. Reforestation objectives should be planned and man-

aged in a more flexible way and be more adapted according to the specific objectives or ecosystem 

services for each case, taking into consideration the specific climatic and topographic context of the 

target areas. Reforestations should also be implemented in such a way as to guarantee long-term sus-

tainability, to increase ecosystem resilience and to diversify income sources for local populations under 

a climate change scenario of increasing aridity in the coming decades (Köbel et al. 2017; Nunes et al. 

2016a).  

The potential of animal indicators for evaluating reforestation success  

In many restoration projects, especially in those concerning afforestations, using animal indica-

tors for success evaluations on habitat and food webs’ structure and complexity (ecological succession) 

is indeed not very frequent (Mexia 2008).  

An international inquiry in areas with conservation interest has shown that, from a total of fifty 

restoration projects undertaken in Portuguese semiarid regions that performed success evaluations, only 

six of them truly measured the number of species and/or animal abundance and used it as an indicator 

of such success (Alice Nunes &amp;amp; Cristina Branquinho - unpublished data).  

This reinforces the need for alternative success indicators, such as animal ones, that may have the 

potential to help understand whether reforestation efforts were indeed successful, if they represented a 

good investment in the Portuguese territory, and if they are contributing somehow to increase ecosys-

tems’ resilience to Climate Change through an enhanced habitat structure, complexity, and diversity.

1.2 - The European wild rabbit amidst Mediterranean drylands 

A brief overview of rabbit’s taxonomy &amp;amp; distribution  

The European wild rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus 

(Linnaeus, 1758) is a small herbivorous mammal that be-

longs to the Lagomorpha Order and Leporidae Family (Fig-

ure 1.5) (ICNF 2005; Smith &amp;amp; Boyer 2008).   

The wild rabbit is a native species from the Iberian 

Peninsula (Alves et al. 2008; Ferreira 2003; Mira et al. 

2007) and the North-western African regions of Morocco 

and Algeria, only occurring naturally within those regions 

of the Mediterranean Basin (Gálvez-Bravo 2011; ICNF 

2005; Rodrigues de Barros 2016).  

Their current worldwide distribution, from across the 

European continent, including Madeira and the Azores is-

lands, Canarias and Baleares, to several other regions of the 

world, such as Australia, New Zealand and some parts of 

South America and North Africa (Figure 1.6), is due to sev-

eral deliberate introductions over past decades, given their relevance as a food or cinegetic resource 

(Alves et al. 2008; Ferreira 2003; ICNF 2005; Rodrigues de Barros 2016; Smith &amp;amp; Boyer 2008). Wild 

rabbit’s successful establishment in other countries is mainly due to their high ecological plasticity, 

colonizing and adaptation capacities within several types of habitat, coupled with elevated reproduction 

rates and favourable ecological conditions (Fernandes dos Santos 2009; Ferreira 2003; Gálvez et al. 

2008; Smith &amp;amp; Boyer 2008; Ward 2005). However, it is considered a plague in many countries where it 

has been introduced, such as in Australia, New Zealand and England, due to their damaging effects to 

agriculture, native species and ecosystems (Alves et al. 2008; Smith &amp;amp; Boyer 2008; Ward 2005).  

Short description of rabbit’s behaviour, social organization &amp;amp; reproduction 

Wild rabbits are active during twilight and at night (Ferreira 2003; Gálvez-Bravo 2011), spending 

much of the day resting underground. Rabbits usually only come out of their burrows at dawn and dusk 

time to graze and feed in areas relatively close to their warrens. Such nocturnal habits constitute an

efficient strategy to reduce the predation risk related to hunting pressure and/or diurnal predators (Fer-

reira 2003; Fernandez-de-Simon et al. 2011; Gonçalves 2015). They also tend to avoid dirt tracks during 

the day to prevent human disturbance, although they can be spotted in broad daylight on warm, sunny 

days in undisturbed places (Fernandez-de-Simon et al. 2011; Zim &amp;amp; Hoffmeister 1955).  

The wild rabbit is indeed the lagomorph species that exhibits the most complex social 

organization. Each social group is formed by a dominant male and several reproductive females along 

with juveniles and subordinated males, being its social structure determined by habitat quality as well 

as shelter and food availability (Gálvez-Bravo 2011; Gonçalves 2015). Digging burrows is a relevant 

component of wild rabbits’ social organization, which is used by different social groups (Ferreira 2003; 

Gálvez-Bravo 2011; Gálvez et al. 2008). Warrens are a complex group of burrows that several rabbits 

have been building up for a considerable amount of time. They are of vital importance to rabbit 

populations, as rabbits establish their vital domain around them, and are indispensable for rabbit’s 

reproduction and protection against potential predators (Ferreira 2003; Gálvez-Bravo 2011; Gonçalves 

2015).  

Rabbits are very popular for their prolific nature, as they are one of the fewest vertebrate species, 

and unlike other lagomorphs, in which females can be sexually receptive during the whole year (Gálvez-

Bravo 2011; Smith &amp;amp; Boyer 2008; Solinas 1998; Zim &amp;amp; Hoffmeister 1955). Therefore, they exhibit a 

considerably accelerated reproductive rate, being able to produce more than twenty cubs annually 

(Gonçalves 2015; Rodrigues de Barros 2016). Their breeding period is highly dependent on plant 

availability and climatic conditions. Nonetheless, such a prolific nature is usually counterbalanced by 

numerous casualties due to the action of external factors such as predators, disease, road traffic, shooting 

and trapping (Ferreira 2003; Gonçalves et al. 2014; Ward 2005).  

On wild rabbit’s basic trophic ecology  

The wild rabbit is a generalist herbivorous species that feeds on a wide set of herbaceous and 

cereal species, mainly grasses and leguminous plants, though they preferably chose to feed on grasses, 

especially from dry pastures, as these have the highest nutritive value, protein levels and reduced fibres’ 

content (Fernandes dos Santos 2009; Ferreira 2003; Gonçalves 2015).  

However, they can alter their dietary choices and feeding strategy according to plant availability 

and nutritional content in their habitats (Ferreira 2003; Gonçalves 2015; Morgado 2008; Simões 2010). 

This nutritional adaptation is highly relevant especially within Mediterranean climate and ecosystems, 

where food resources’ availability can be quite differential (Gonçalves 2015; Simões 2010). Therefore, 

they feed on alternative plants with lower nutritive value, such as Cistaceae, Compositae, and Ericaceae, 

when grasses are less abundant or not present, especially during the Summer season, and may have to 

feed on other poorly nutritional parts of those plants (leaves, barks and small pieces of roots) (Fernandes 

dos Santos 2009; Ferreira 2003; Gálvez-Bravo 2011). 

Rabbits go through a special physiological mechanism called caecotrophy, in which they re-ingest 

their own cecotrophic pellets (soft white, bacteria and protein-rich droppings), and then go through a 

second digestion to later produce a second type of pellets, which are definitive harsh droppings that are 

permanently deposited in the soil (Gálvez-Bravo 2011; Gil-Jiménez et al. 2015). This is a very efficient 

strategy as it maximizes nutrient and water intake by rabbits, especially when they feed on plants with 

lower nutritive value (Ferreira 2003; Gálvez-Bravo 2011; Gil-Jiménez et al. 2015). These definitive 

pellets can be found either dispersed or deposited in latrines by rabbits that belong to the same social 

group (Ferreira 2003; Gálvez-Bravo 2011).  

Latrines are faecal pellet clusters of at least twenty or thirty droppings typically found inside 

rabbits’ vital domain that play vital roles in the demarcation of their territory (Figure 1.7) (Ferreira 2003; 



 

9 

 

Gálvez et al. 2008; Morgado 2008). The act of depositing droppings in latrines constitutes a vital social 

interaction between rabbits, being important for olfactive communication among individuals (Gálvez-

Bravo 2011; Gonçalves 2015; Sneddon 1991). Rabbits show evidence of a behavioural pattern concern-

ing droppings and latrines’ location and deposition, as they recurrently tend to choose specific locations 

within their territories to deposit them (Gonçalves 2015; Morgado 2008; Sneddon 1991). There is indeed 

a strong behavioural component of latrine abundance, which may not be necessarily linked to rabbit 

abundance per se, given that rabbits tendentially choose the same regions to deposit their pellets (Fer-

nandez-de-Simon et al. 2011; Sneddon 1991). Latrines can be usually found in more opened regions 

that do not exhibit significant degrees of steepness, preferably in undisturbed arenaceous and/or granitic 

soils with some herbaceous cover, such as along dirt tracks, earthen, tilled land, among pasture regions 

and in the proximity of burrows (Margarida Santos-Reis &amp;amp; Sandra Alcobia - personal communication). 

Rabbit latrines are in this way visible elements that reveal wild rabbit’s presence in a certain region, and 

can be used to obtain indirect estimates of their relative abundance in those regions (Virgós et al. 2003).  

Dropping accumulation within latrines presents very particular physical and chemical character-

istics that provide an important nutrient source, contributing to soil fertility, the increase of plant diver-

sity and biomass, altering its floristic composition, and being beneficial for coprophagous beetle com-

munities (Fernandez-de-Simon et al. 2011; Gálvez-Bravo 2011; Gálvez et al. 2008). 

Wild rabbit’s presence &amp;amp; abundance estimation methods - a summary  

Until the present time, no methods capable of performing direct and exact measures of wild rabbit 

population size(s) are known. It is indeed only possible to estimate relative abundance, and to detect and 

evaluate population density fluctuations, through resource to indirect methods (Fernandez-de-Simon et 

al. 2011; Gonçalves &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2014).  

These allow us to obtain species’ abundance indices through the quantification of presence and 

activity traces, such as droppings, latrines, scratchings, footprints, burrows, warrens, among others, 

which are usually visible and easily identifiable elements (Ferreira 2003; Simões 2010). The most 

frequently used trace presence prospection methods include linear transects on foot recording rabbit 

signs (Gonçalves &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2014; Sarmento et al. 2004); cleared-plot pellet counts at permanent 

plots (Catalán et al. 2008; Fernandes dos Santos 2009; Ferreira 2003); and finally standing crop counts 

(Fernandez-de-Simon et al. 2011; Moreno &amp;amp; Villafuerte 1995).  

In general, indirect methods do not involve large economic nor human resources and are easily 

applicable, allowing for the obtaining of reasonably accurate presence and relative abundance estimates 

in a simple, time-efficient and non-expensive way (Ferreira 2003; Simões 2009; Simões 2010). Since 

their precision does not depend on animals’ detection or capture, presence trace prospections - such as 

pellet-count indices - are the most suitable and reliable ones to study less conspicuous species and that

occur in low to very low densities, such as the wild rabbit in Portugal nowadays (Fernandes dos Santos 

2009; Ferreira 2003). From this perspective, LATR (Latrine index - latrines/km) has been recently 

adopted as a standardized method for monitoring rabbits in Portugal (Gonçalves &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2014; 

LPN 2014; Sarmento et al. 2004).  

Despite its simplicity and versatility, there are nevertheless some negative aspects that should be 

pointed out, such as the strict relation between differential defecation rates, dietary composition and 

social patterns; the relevant direct role of environmental conditions on the deterioration and detectability 

of traces, and the strong connection between the degree of the observer’s experience and the reliability 

of species traces identification (Ferreira 2003; Simões 2010).  

Wild rabbit’s fundamental ecological requirements &amp;amp; preferential habitat  

Wild rabbit’s presence, abundance and distribution are essentially dependent and related to habitat 

structure, complexity and quality (Ferreira 2003; Gonçalves 2015; Gonçalves &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2014; 

Virgós et al. 2003), namely landscape features regarding the nature of soil cover. Their most suitable 

habitats should include non-fragmented landscapes with a combination of both open and closed areas, 

exhibiting heterogeneous vegetation cover that allow for nutritionally rich food choices and shelter, and 

soft soils with adequate substrates that facilitate the construction of burrows and shelters for refuge 

purposes (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2010; Ferreira 2003; Gonçalves &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2014; Gonçalves et al. 

2014; Gonçalves 2015; Virgós et al. 2003). 

Having stated this, heterogeneous mosaic landscapes, highly abundant within Mediterranean 

ecosystems, are indeed wild rabbit’s preferential habitats (Gonçalves &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2014; LPN 2014; 

Simões 2009). These landscapes are composed by complex mixed mosaics of holm and cork-oak 

forested areas mingled with shrub patches and scrublands, and opened regions, namely pasturelands and 

agricultural areas (Figure 1.8) (Gonçalves et al. 2014; Gonçalves 2015; ICNF 2005; Simões 2010; 

Virgós et al. 2003).  

In these mixed habitats, the 

transition between open and closed areas 

and the discontinuity in the vegetation is 

vital, as it ensures simultaneously the 

presence and proximity of the most 

favourable areas for rabbits to find shelter 

and protection from predators and/or 

adverse (climatic) conditions (within 

closed areas: shrub, scrublands and 

forest), as well as to feed (within opened 

areas: pastures and agricultural areas, 

with high herbaceous or pasture covers 

that support their diet of grasses and 

cereals) (Fernandes dos Santos 2009; Ferreira 2003; Gonçalves 2015; ICNF 2005; Simões 2009;  Virgós 

et al. 2003). This spatial interspersion of mosaic areas suitable for rabbits allows them to optimize their 

efforts in their search for food resources and minimizes the risk of predation, which is considerably high 

especially within the Iberian Peninsula (Ferreira 2003; Gonçalves 2015; Gonçalves &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 

2014).

Factors regulating wild rabbit’s distribution &amp;amp; abundance in Mediterranean regions 

Within the Iberian Peninsula, the wild rabbit’s presence and abundance is mostly affected by a 

set of environmental and climatic parameters, such as altitude, slope, type of soil, habitat availability, 

disturbance factors or threats (predators, pathogens and hunters), precipitation rates and temperature 

(Ferreira 2003; Gálvez-Bravo 2011; Gonçalves 2015; LPN 2014). Oryctolagus cuniculus tend to be rare 

in regions that surpass 1500 m in elevation (Smith &amp;amp; Boyer 2008), having been reported elsewhere that 

rabbits usually avoid areas with low temperatures, high precipitation rates and any kind of human dis-

turbance (Gálvez-Bravo 2011; LPN 2014).  

Most studies concerning rabbit population trends in the Iberian Peninsula are mainly focused on 

the associations between present habitat parameters and recent distribution and abundance of their pop-

ulations (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2010; Fernández 2005). There is an evident lack of information concern-

ing the effects of habitat loss on Iberian rabbit populations, being extremely difficult to understand 

clearly how landscape changes have affected rabbit populations, and their influence on rabbit popula-

tions’ decline in the Iberian Peninsula (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2010). Despite that, there are some studies 

that substantiate the existence of a strong correlation between rabbit distribution and abundance and 

significant land-use changes over recent decades in Mediterranean regions (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2010).  

Main threats associated with wild rabbit populations’ decline in the Iberian Peninsula  

Wild rabbit abundance, once significantly high in the Iberian Peninsula, has been suffering an 

accentuated decline since the first half of the 20th century (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2010; ICNF 2005; LPN 

2014; Mira et al. 2007; Ward 2005). This delicate situation is mainly due to habitat loss, fragmentation 

and deterioration, viral diseases, and high cinegetic pressure (Ferreira 2003; Gonçalves et al. 2014; 

ICNF 2005; Ward 2005). The resultant reduction in rabbit populations has caused a major impairment 

of trophic webs, as well as relevant ecological and economic consequences in Mediterranean ecosys-

tems’ functioning (Cabezas-Díaz et al. 2009; Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008; ICNF 2005; LPN 2014).  

Habitat deterioration and fragmentation in Mediterranean landscapes are a consequence of the 

abandonment of traditional agricultural methods, intensive agriculture, forestry intensification, con-

struction of urban infrastructures due to socio-economic growth, and recurrent forest fires potentiated 

by increasing aridity (Fernandes dos Santos 2009; Gálvez-Bravo 2011; ICNF 2005; LPN 2014; Ward 

2005). These changes in habitat structure and complexity have promoted the decrease and impoverish-

ment of the suitability of rabbits’ most favourable heterogeneous mosaic habitats, thus affecting directly 

this species’ presence and abundance (Fernandes dos Santos 2009; Gonçalves et al. 2014; ICNF 2005; 

Smith &amp;amp; Boyer 2008; Ward 2005). 

Two major viral diseases, Myxomatosis, and Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), emerged in 

1953 and 1988 respectively within the Iberian Peninsula, being responsible for high mortality rates and 

for reductions in rabbit populations of approximately 24% in Portugal and of 73% in Spain over the last 

thirty years (Gálvez-Bravo 2011; Gonçalves 2015; ICNF 2005; LPN 2014; Virgós et al. 2003). In addi-

tion, the European wild rabbit is a very popular game species with a major hunting value, especially in 

the Iberian Peninsula, where rabbit hunting is a very important recreational, social and economic activity 

(Delibes-Mateos et al. 2007; Ferreira 2003; Gonçalves et al. 2014; ICNF 2005; Mira et al. 2007; Mor-

gado 2008; Simões 2009). 

Nowadays wild rabbit abundances are extremely variable within the Iberian Peninsula, because 

of population decline in recent years (Fernández 2005; Gálvez-Bravo 2011; Gonçalves et al. 2014). 

Although present throughout the entire Portuguese territory (ICNF 2005), currently their distribution is 

highly fragmented and heterogeneous, favouring the existence of many low-dense areas and fewer areas 

still containing rabbits at a relatively high density (Cabezas-Díaz et al. 2009; Delibes-Mateos et al. 2010; 



 

12 

 

Gonçalves 2015; Gonçalves &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2014; ICNF 2005). For this reason, their conservation status 

is classified as “Near Threatened”, according to both the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Smith 

&amp;amp; Boyer 2008), and the Red Book of Vertebrates of Portugal (ICNF 2005).  

The wild rabbit as a leading actor in Mediterranean ecosystems 

Wild rabbits are a fundamental key-species in Mediterranean habitats (Delibes-Mateos et al. 

2010; Gonçalves &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2014; Mira et al. 2007), due to the significant influence that they have 

in such ecosystem structures, functions and dynamics, and to their ecological importance and the mul-

tiplicity of relevant roles they play in these ecosystems (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008; Delibes-Mateos et 

al. 2010; Ferreira 2003; Gonçalves et al. 2014; Mira et al. 2007). They are impressive ecosystem engi-

neers and a relevant ‘landscape shaper’, given their significant influence and effects on plant commu-

nities’ composition and vegetation structure, and their extraordinary capacity to produce relevant 

changes in landscapes (Ferreira 2003; Gil-Jiménez et al. 2015; Gonçalves &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2014; Gon-

çalves et al. 2014).  

The rabbit’s herbivorous role promotes seed dispersion of both herbaceous and woody species, 

producing changes within the composition of vegetation communities, thus being very beneficial for 

their regeneration and the increase of plant populations, and promote the maintenance of opened areas, 

contributing to a more complex and heterogeneous habitat (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008; Delibes-Mateos 

et al. 2010; Ferreira 2003; Gálvez-Bravo 2011; Gonçalves 2015). On the other hand, rabbits’ extraordi-

nary excavator capacity through burrow construction is responsible for producing changes in soil char-

acteristics, and besides burrows provide foraging, shelter and nesting habitats for other species (Gálvez-

Bravo et al. 2009; Gálvez-Bravo 2011; Gonçalves 2015; Gonçalves et al. 2014). 

Moreover, rabbit pellets’ deposition within latrines and rabbits’ urine are fundamental for soil 

fertilisation, plant growth and higher plant species’ diversity and biomass (Cabezas-Díaz et al. 2009; 

Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008; Fernandez-de-Simon et al. 2011; Gálvez-Bravo 2011; Gonçalves 2015). 

The combination of herbivory, excavating activities and pellet accumulation all contribute to an increase 

in the physical heterogeneity of the ecosystem due to exchanges in edaphic conditions, the creation of 

water, nutrients and seed clusters (Gálvez-Bravo 2011; Gonçalves et al. 2014). 

Wild rabbits have a vital importance in the Mediterranean ecosystem food chains’ dynamic, in 

their quality as a basic food resource for a wide variety of top predators (Ferreira 2003; Gonçalves et al. 

2014; Simões 2010). For being a vital food resource for such a broad number of predators, they have a 

very significant influence in predators’ population fluctuations (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008; Fernández 

2005; Ferreira 2003; Gonçalves et al. 2012; Simões 2010). 

Within the Iberian Peninsula, rabbits are indeed the main stable prey of about 40 relevant species 

of predators, many of which are emblematic endemic endangered species, some of them being indeed 

critically endangered, such as the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus - Temminck, 1827), the Iberian Imperial 

eagle (Aquila adalberti - Brehm, 1861), the Black vulture (Aegypius monachus - Linnaeus, 1766), and 

the Bonelli’s eagle (Hieraaetus fasciatus - Vieillot, 1822) (Cabezas-Díaz et al. 2009; Ferreira 2003; 

Gonçalves et al. 2012; Loureiro et al. 2011; LPN 2014; Mira et al. 2007). Among these, the Iberian lynx 

and Iberian Imperial eagle are indeed specialized in rabbit’s consumption (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008; 

Rodrigues de Barros 2016), being unfortunately highly dependent on rabbits to survive. In this context, 

the wild rabbit’s decline in recent years has posed serious consequences for Iberian lynx populations, 

depriving the lynx from directly interfering in their behaviour, reproduction and long-term survival (Gil-

Jiménez et al. 2015; Gonçalves 2015; Loureiro et al. 2011; LPN 2014; Mira et al. 2007).

Wild rabbit’s potential as an ecological indicator  

The wild rabbit is indeed an essential keystone species in Mediterranean ecosystems, especially 

in the Iberian Peninsula (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2010; Ferreira 2003; Gonçalves &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2014). 

This is due to the multiplicity of relevant roles and impacts they have within these habitats, in the quality 

of relevant ecosystem engineers and as a ‘landscape shaper’ (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008; Ferreira 2003; 

Gálvez-Bravo 2011; Gonçalves et al. 2014). Moreover, they are among the vital base of food chains, 

being one of the most significant food resources for a considerable set of top predators (Cabezas-Díaz 

et al. 2009; Fernández 2005; Gonçalves et al. 2014; Virgós et al. 2003). 

Given the proven relevance of such species within Mediterranean ecosystems and their strict re-

lation and vital roles in habitat structure, quality and complexity, the wild rabbit has all the potential to 

be a good ecological indicator in such ecosystems.  

 

Framework and relevance of this study  

The present work was carried out within the context of the previously mentioned AdaptforChange 

Project, a Portuguese Research Project carried out in 2015 and 2016 that aimed to evaluate the success 

of reforestations that were implemented in Portuguese historical semi-arid lands.  

Reforestation with native species is a vital environmental management tool, as it is an ecological 

restoration method frequently used for degraded ecosystems. The study of the potential of the wild rabbit 

as an ecological indicator of ecosystem management, particularly in the context of reforestations with 

native species in Mediterranean drylands, poses a perfect conciliation between two vital Biology aspects, 

the Ecology (wild rabbit &amp;amp; habitat ecology) and the Environmental Management (reforestation with 

native species) ones. 

 

Objectives 

The present work intends to understand whether the wild rabbit is a good success indicator for 

historical reforestations in southern Portuguese drylands.

2. GEOGRAPHICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK 

2.1 - Study area characterisation 

The present study was carried out in holm-oak (Quercus ilex subsp. rotundifolia), cork-oak 

(Quercus suber) and stone-pine (Pinus pinea) reforestation areas, located in the southern dryland regions 

of continental Portugal (Baixo Alentejo and Algarve - Figure 2.1), southwestern Iberian Peninsula, 

Europe. These reforestation actions took place under semi-arid and dry sub-humid climates, over the 

last forty to sixty years.  

The study area has a typical Mediterranean climate with a strong temperature and rainfall 

seasonality, and a high inter-annual variability in precipitation. It is characterized by cold and moist 

winters with strong precipitation periods and very hot, dry summers with scarce precipitation and 

average temperatures above 22ºC (Belo et al. 2009). However, due to a considerable increase in aridity 

levels in past decades, nowadays these regions are dominated by semi-arid (Aridity Index between 0.20 

and 0.50) and dry sub-humid climates (Aridity Index from 0.50 to 0.65). These characteristics impose 

limitations to plant species establishment and growth (Köbel et al. 2017; Vallejo et al. 2012), which are 

expected to worsen under a climate change scenario of increased aridity and a higher frequency of 

extreme events, such as prolonged droughts or seasonal floods (Belo et al. 2009; Costa et al. 2008; 

Miranda et al. 2006). 

Figure 2.1 - Map illustrating the study area along an aridity gradient.  

The set of sampling sites is shown here according to the municipalities where 

they are located, and along an aridity gradient from dry sub-humid (AI=0.58) 

to semi-arid (AI=0.44). Regions in orange are more arid (lower aridity index). 

Map scale 1:880.000. The map was projected using the coordinate system 

UTM/ETRS89 Portugal TM06.

The mean annual temperature range within the study area varies between 15-16ºC, and the mean 

annual rainfall from 519 mm to 616 mm (Nunes et al. 2016a). This area is characterized by an aridity 

gradient from dry sub-humid (Aridity Index = 0.58) to semi-arid (Aridity Index = 0.44).  

Lithosols are the dominant soil type in these areas, which are impoverished, shallow and unsuit-

able for agricultural purposes, as they result from rock degradation’s first stages (Nunes et al. 2014; 

Príncipe et al. 2014). 

Southern Portuguese drylands have been reforested over past decades with holm-oak, cork-oak 

and stone-pine, as a vital strategy to combat desertification and land degradation (Iovieno et al. 2010; 

Nunes et al. 2016a; Oliet et al. 2015; Príncipe et al. 2014). These species are highly resilient to drought 

events and to precipitation’s seasonal and inter-annual variations (Belo et al. 2009; Príncipe et al. 2014; 

Vaz et al. 2010), being therefore often used in reforestation programmes in drylands, especially in west-

ern European and northern African Mediterranean regions (Iovieno et al. 2010; Oliet et al. 2015; Prín-

cipe et al. 2014). In addition, (re)afforestations are also a critical tool for climate change mitigation 

(Köbel et al. 2017), particularly in areas where its effects are expected to be strong (Costa et al. 2008). 

2.2 - Sampling sites’ selection   

Sampling sites were chosen within those included in the AdaptforChange Project’s database of 

reforestation actions, provided they fulfilled the following criteria: (i) they should be composed of pure 

or mixed plantations of the target species - Q. suber, Q. ilex or P. pinea; (ii) have at least ten years of 

age since the plantation date (to guarantee planted trees’ establishment, and to prevent the plantation’s 

perturbation effect on the ecosystem); and (iii) should be located within a dryland region (exhibiting an 

aridity index lower than 0.65, along an aridity gradient) (Köbel et al. 2017).  

AdaptforChange’s research team selected at least four sites of each reforestation type (pure or 

mixed plantations of oaks and pines), in a total of 44 sampling sites. For the present study, 23 of these 

sites (Table 2.1) were selected for wild rabbit sampling (see Section 2.3), along the previously mentioned 

aridity gradient, and covering six Portuguese municipalities (Almodôvar, Beja, Castro Verde, and Mé-

rtola in the Alentejo region; Alcoutim and Loulé in the Algarve - Figure 2.1).

2.3 - Wild rabbit sampling  

2.3.1 - Sampling strategy: rabbit latrines &amp;amp; droppings’ counts along linear transects 

For this study, wild rabbit sampling was carried out through the establishment of pedestrian linear 

transects recording rabbit latrines within reforested areas (Gonçalves &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2014; Gonçalves et 

al. 2014; Sarmento et al. 2004). This presence traces’ prospection method was chosen, since latrine 

counting allows for performing, in a simple, economic and practical way, a comparison of the wild 

rabbit’s relative abundance estimates among the set of sampled sites (Fernández 2005; INCOB 2009, 

cited by Gonçalves &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2014; Gonçalves et al. 2014).  

Because of the high variability in reforestation parcel sizes, as well as in the areas of the 

plantations, it was decided to apply a single linear transect of 250 m per site, to obtain a standardized 

sampling (thus assuring abundance estimates’ comparison). However, the location of the transect was 

adapted to each site: in larger sites, the transect would be continuous, and in smaller sites, the transect 

was discontinuous.  

Transects’ possible locations in each sampling site were established prior to the field work, using 

software Google Earth Pro®, version 7.1.5.1557 for Windows®, and these were downloaded to Garmin® 

GPS. This was considered the best way to proceed in order to obtain a reasonably good representation 

of the study sites, and the most suitable locations for the sampling transects, since the observer did not 

have a priori knowledge of the study area.    

To ensure that wild rabbits’ sampling is carried out within or as close as possible to reforestation 

studied parcels, transects must be disposed within or in the proximity of geometrical polygons that are 

representative of the most favourable areas to perform vegetation sampling (carried out by the 

AdaptforChange Project’s research team - see Section 2.4.1). Moreover, transects should be established 

passing through, or as spatially close as possible to, the geometrical centroid of each favorable sampling 

polygon, to assure a representative sampling. If it is not possible to establish transects passing through 

the centroids’ location, transects must be carried out as close as possible to the centroid. Polygons’ 

geometrical centroids were determined using QGIS® software, version 2.12.0 ‘Lyon’ for Windows®, and 

the set of representative polygons and respective centroids were downloaded into a Garmin® GPSMAP 

76CSx through software GPS TrackMaker®, version 13.8.517 for Windows®. Figure 2.2 shows an 

example of the sampling protocol - wild rabbit latrines’ counting along foot-transects - applied within 

reforested areas. 

For each sampling site, transects should be defined along dirt paths, where the soil nature of these 

tracks significantly improves traces’ detectability, therefore being ideal for rabbit latrine and droppings’ 

counts (Fernández 2005; INCOB 2009, cited by Gonçalves &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2014).

2.3.2 - Field sampling  

Wild rabbits’ field sampling was carried out during a unique sampling season, in November and 

December of 2015. According to Gonçalves et al. (2002) &amp;amp; Martins et al. (2003), it is highly advisable 

to perform rabbit latrines’ counting in at least two different sampling seasons to encompass differential 

wild rabbit reproductive biology stages, and consequently variable abundances, namely during the post-

breeding period when the highest abundance peak occurs (May and June), and if possible also in the 

lowest abundance period (late August and September). Moreover, Fernandez-de-Simon et al. (2011) 

reinforce that pellet-count indices should be obtained during early Summer, preferably at the start of the 

dry season, as a way of reducing as much as possible the biases associated with differences in rabbit 

pellet persistence because of rainfall effects, especially within Mediterranean habitats.  

 Despite all this, and even though November and December are not contemplated as ideal months 

to perform wild rabbit latrine counts, it was only possible to execute this sampling method in those 

months, mainly due to logistic and technical reasons related to some delays in obtaining reforestation

information from the institutions involved within the AdaptforChange Project context, thus delaying the 

appropriate selection of sampling sites.1 

For each sampling site, transects were walked through during daytime, from the early morning 

(approximately 8 a.m) until the end of the afternoon (between 5 and 6 p.m), due to higher solar 

exposition that significantly improves latrine and droppings’ detectability. While walking transects at a 

slow pace, a Garmin® GPS was used to mark and register points for the beginning and end of each 

transect and every time latrines or other rabbit traces (burrows and/or scratchings) were detected, as well 

as to obtain the geographical coordinates for every recorded point and to register the routes walked in 

the field by means of its special tracking option.  

All the relevant data detected along transects, as well as the areas located up to two meters on 

each side of them (to assure that all rabbit traces present along the surroundings of the transect area are 

accounted for), was recorded in field sheets (designed prior to the field work, using Microsoft® Excel® 

2016 MSO, version 16.0.6925.1044 for Windows® - a template field sheet is presented in the Appendix 

- Table 1). A personal photographic camera was used to take photos of the most representative latrines, 

and of other relevant traces found along transects, using a small object for scale purposes.  

For each latrine found, the following information was registered: geographic coordinates; latrine 

dimensions (estimated number of pellets and latrine diameter (in cm), using a five-meter long tape 

measure to perform two consecutive measurements); droppings’ estimated age (three categories based 

on droppings’ coloration and integrity: very old - whitish-colored, extremely harsh and thick; old - 

between dark brown and whitish colors, relatively harsh; and recent - intense shiny dark brown color 

and soft consistency); dominant land cover in the latrine surroundings (bare soil and/or rocks, dead layer, 

shrubby and/or herbaceous plants, lichens, moss, …); other relevant traces, such as other rabbit traces 

(burrows, scratchings, hair/fur,…) or from other animals, such as footprints and/or footprint trails, 

droppings, burrows, hair/fur, skeletal remains, among other from wild boars (such as diggings) and/or 

predators that are relevant to wild rabbits’ presence, or that could explain their absence; and finally, 

special or unusual features or events, such as evidences of rabbit viral diseases, thinning, forest fires, 

among any other factors capable of producing changes in wild rabbits’ presence, mainly inhibiting it 

(Gonçalves &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2014). 

Transects’ a priori establishment were confirmed and/or altered at the time of sampling according 

to environmental and accessibility conditions in each sampling site. In some sampling sites, it was not 

possible to walk transects through the centroid, either due to inaccessible paths that exhibited high shrub 

densities and/or physical obstacles, and significant steepness, and/or due to the absence of the most 

suitable paths for latrine counting purposes within or close to the centroid area. In these cases, transects 

were established in the most suitable paths as spatially close as possible to the respective centroids. In 

the absence of appropriate dirt paths within the sampling area, a decision was made to walk transects 

directly through the plantation lines and interlines, covering the centroids’ location or as close as 

possible to them. This decision was due to the high detectability of rabbit evidences verified at the time 

of sampling, such as latrines and burrows present along plantation lines’ terrain elevations.  

Land owners and managers were approached in study sites, whenever possible, to understand the 

possible influence of pathology events associated to viral diseases (myxomatosis and rabbit 

haemorrhagic disease), and management actions (game activity, forest thinning, fires, among other 

factors), that may affect wild rabbits’ abundance. This constitutes an effective way to complement and 

reinforce wild rabbit abundance data obtained during field samplings. 

                                                      
1 Despite the strong recommendation in favour of executing rabbits’ sampling protocol in at least two different sampling 

seasons, the author was only able to carry it out in a single sampling season, due to unexpected health and personal issues that 

unfortunately prevented the accomplishment of a second sampling season.

2.4 - Characterization of reforestations by AdaptforChange’s research team 

Since the present work was carried out within reforested sites in the framework of the National 

Research Project AdaptforChange, and since it is intended to determine whether the wild rabbit is indeed 

a good success indicator of reforestations using reforestation-related variables in the analysis of wild 

rabbit data, a brief description of the methodologies applied for the characterization of reforestations is 

given below.  

Within each sampling site, two researchers of the AdaptforChange Project’s research team 

characterised tree, shrub and herbaceous layers, soil crusts, soil and climate features to assess relevant 

ecosystem parameters, namely tree and herbaceous diversity and productivity, natural tree regeneration, 

soil quality and habitat structural diversity. These parameters were chosen since they reflect forest 

productivity and sustainability, soil protection, and biodiversity, which are vital ecosystem functions 

and objectives of reforestations. The reforestation features that were studied allowed for the evaluation 

of the establishment and growth of planted trees, as well as the resultant ecosystems from reforestation 

actions (Köbel et al. 2017; Nunes et al. 2016a). Vegetation and a part of soil data were obtained 

throughout field work in the sampled sites in November and December of 2015, whilst climatic and part 

of soil information were extracted from available databases (Köbel et al. 2017). 

The information regarding vegetation’s structure and complexity, soil and climate features of the 

studied reforestations, which represent indicators of the success of reforestations, will be used to 

understand whether it influences (or not) wild rabbits’ presence and abundance in the study area, as it is 

known that habitat structure and complexity (vegetation and soil structure), and climate factors play 

vital roles in rabbit nutritional and shelter availability and affect their habitat suitability. This will 

hopefully allow us to determine if the wild rabbit is indeed a good ecological indicator of the success of 

reforestations.  

2.4.1 - Definition of sampling plots for vegetation and soil sampling 

At each sampling site, vegetation and soil were characterised within a sampling plot with 1000 

m2 (0,1 ha) defined to encompass 3 plantation inter-lines (Figure 2.3). Reforestation sampling plots were 

defined within, or as close as possible to, geometrical polygons that are representative of the most 

suitable areas for vegetation sampling, which were designed prior to the field work for each sampling 

site using software Google Earth Pro®, version 7.1.5.1557 for Windows®. Taking into consideration the 

(possible) high variability within the same reforestation area due to microclimatic conditions, sampling 

plots were defined within areas that present similar solar exposition (Potential Solar Radiation 1294430 

± 96285 KW/m2) to limit such variability (Köbel et al. 2017; Nunes et al. 2016a).

2.4.2 - Vegetation sampling: trees, shrubs &amp;amp; herbaceous features 

Trees 

The total number of trees present within the sampling plot was registered, as well as the presence 

of cut trees (resultant from thinning actions), dead trunks and non-planted adult trees. Tree height was 

measured using a hypsometer. For about ? of the planted pines and ½ of the planted oaks (since there 

was a higher homogeneity of growth among pine trees than oaks), diameter at breast height (DBH) and 

canopy diameters were measured. Current and historical tree productivity was estimated by the NDVI 

(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), having extracted NDVI’s lowest annual value that occurs 

during summer when annual plants are dry, which reflects perennial species’ productivity (Köbel et al. 

2017; Nunes et al. 2016a).  

Shrubs cover and diversity, bare soil cover and natural tree regeneration 

For each sampling plot, shrub diversity and cover and the proportion of bare soil were estimated 

along three transects with lengths varying between 21.7 and 37.2 m. Shrub diversity (species richness) 

was estimated through the identification of all shrub species present along the transects, whereas shrub 

cover (%) was assessed based on the proportion of each transect covered by shrubs. If no vegetation was 

present, the cover of bare soil and of biological soil crust (%) were registered. Natural tree regeneration 

was estimated by counting and measuring heights and canopy diameters of all seedlings and saplings 

present within a one-square-meter area along transects (Köbel et al. 2017; Nunes et al. 2016a).   

Herbaceous cover and productivity 

Herbaceous cover was estimated based on photographs of four 50 x 50 cm quadrats, 2 in planta-

tion lines and 2 between lines, estimating the proportion of herbaceous plants by counting green pixels 

using ArcGIS software. To estimate herbaceous productivity, 3 samples of herbaceous aboveground 

biomass were collected within a 30 x 30 cm square along plantation lines to prevent inter-lines’ varia-

bility. This biomass was then dried and weighted, to obtain dry biomass weight and calculate the bio-

mass produced per hectare (Köbel et al. 2017; Nunes et al. 2016a).   

2.4.3 - Climate characterization  

As previously mentioned, climate factors, such as Aridity Index, as well as bio-type climatic 

variables, such as Annual Mean Temperature (bio_1), Temperature Seasonality (bio_4), Annual Mean 

Precipitation (bio_12), Precipitation Seasonality (bio_15), Isothermality (bio_3), Temperature Annual 

Range (bio_7), among others, were obtained from available databases (Agência Portuguesa do 

Ambiente 2011; Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera 2016; Trabucco &amp;amp; Zomer 2009, all cited by 

Köbel et al. 2017).  

2.5 - Data organization &amp;amp; analysis 

2.5.1 - Wild rabbits’ data assembly, organization &amp;amp; analysis  

Wild rabbit’s data obtained during field sampling was typed into a database in Microsoft® Excel® 

2016 MSO, version 16.0.6925.1044 for Windows®. Rabbit latrines and pellets’ data allowed to obtain 

the following parameters: total number of latrines; latrines’ diameter (in cm); pellets’ average number 

(within each latrine); and pellets’ estimated age.  



 

21 

 

Latrines’ average diameter consists of a latrines’ size index calculated for each sampled site, 

which was obtained using latrines’ average diameter classes. Latrines’ diameters measured during field 

sampling were organized within four latrines’ average diameter classes: 1 - [5-30] cm; 2 - [30-60] cm; 

3 - [60-100] cm; 4 - [100-200] cm. For each class we put the total number of latrines whose diameter 

belongs to that class. Those values were then multiplied by the highest limit value of the diameter class 

where they belong, and the resulting average of such values corresponds to the size index for latrines’ 

average diameters that will be used as a rabbit variable in this study.  

In the same way, pellets’ average number consists of a quantity index obtained for each sampled 

site, considering five classes created according to the number of estimated pellets within each latrine 

found at the time of sampling: 1 - [20-50] pellets; 2 - [50-200] pellets; 3 - [200-400] pellets; 4 - [400-

750] pellets; 5 - [750-2000] pellets. In each class are the total number of latrines whose estimated number 

of pellets belongs to that class. Such values were then multiplied by the highest limit value of the average 

number class where they belong, and the resulting average of such values corresponds to the quantity 

index for the estimated number of pellets, which will be used as another rabbit variable for this work.  

Pellets’ estimated age is a numerical category based on droppings’ degradation state (color and 

integrity) at the time of sampling: 1 - very old and old; 2 - old; 3 - old and recent.  

A brief characterization of the linear transects carried out to perform wild rabbit sampling, as well 

as latrines’ average diameter classes and pellets’ average number classes are presented respectively in 

Tables 2, 3 and 4 in the Appendix. 

2.5.2 - Determination of wild rabbits’ relative abundance 

To obtain an estimation of wild rabbit relative abundance within the sampling sites, a Kilometric 

Abundance Index (KAI) has been calculated. KAI was obtained as the ratio between the number of wild 

rabbits’ presence signs detected (total number of latrines) and the transects’ length (converted into 

kilometres) (Gonçalves et al. 2014; INCOB 2009, cited by Gonçalves &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2014; Simões 

2009). The calculation of KAI for each sampling point allows for comparisons of rabbits’ relative 

abundance among different sampling sites (Wilson et al. 1996, cited by Mira et al. 2007).   

2.5.3 - Integration of reforestation-related variables within the wild rabbit database  

Within all the reforestation data obtained, an a priori choice of variables was performed aiming 

to integrate in rabbits’ database solely the ones that presumably influence wild rabbits’ presence and 

abundance in the study area. Such variables were selected to test a possible influence in wild rabbits at 

the sampled sites. In the context of the present work, these variables are considered as indicators of the 

success of reforestations. A-posteriori analysis of the relationships between wild rabbit variables and 

the environmental ones (chosen from the set of reforestation-related variables) will hopefully allow us 

to find out whether the rabbit can be a good success indicator of reforestation actions in Portuguese 

drylands.  

Selected environmental variables - indicators of the success of reforestations - were related to 

trees (type of reforestation; reforestation dominant type; Pinus pinea presence; planted tree species’ 

cover (%); trees’ density, height and diameter at breast height (DBH); canopy openness; plantation 

estimated age); tree regeneration (number of juvenile trees - seedlings and saplings); shrubs (number of 

shrub species with and without seedlings; shrub cover (%) and average height; shrub’s spatial 

distribution); herbaceous plants (herbaceous and moss cover (%); herbaceous biomass); soil (type of 

soil; bare soil cover (%); bare soil &amp;amp; rock cover (%); steepness); and finally climate features (aridity 

index; annual mean temperature; temperature seasonality; annual mean precipitation; precipitation of 

the wettest month), as it is known that habitat and landscape features are very important to explain rabbit 

distribution and abundance (e.g. Virgós et al. 2003).  



 

22 

 

2.5.4 - Spatial organization of wild rabbit data in the Geographic Information System 

Furthermore, the previously obtained geometrical polygons and respective centroids, alongside 

all recorded points and walked routes registered within the GPS, were integrated in a Geographic 

Information System (GIS) using QGIS® software to later perform the necessary corrections to walked 

routes in the field, and integrate such spatial information into maps.  

Moreover, maps illustrating the study area, as well as the wild rabbit's sampling strategy and 

relative abundance (Kilometric Abundance Index) have been created using ArcMap® from ArcGIS® 

mapping software, version 10.6 for Windows®. For the map regarding the study area, a color gradient 

was used to illustrate the aridity gradient present throughout the set of sampling sites, whereas for the 

map concerning the wild rabbit’s Kilometric Abundance Index, a size gradient was used to stand for 

different KAI values according to each sampling site. 

2.6 - Data analysis  

2.6.1 - Histograms and correlations 

For each variable, histograms were obtained to understand the behavior and distribution of each 

variable. Histograms were designed using package ‘graphics’ (R Core Team and contributors 

worldwide, 2018a) within software R® - version 3.4.3 “Kite-Eating Tree” for Windows® (R Core Team, 

2017).  

The relations between continuous variables, such as the wild rabbit ones and the indicators of the 

success of reforestations (measured reforestation parameters) and climatic data were tested with 

Spearman correlations, with IBM SPSS Statistics Base® software - version 22.0.0.0 for Windows® (IBM 

Corp., 2013). Correlations were considered significant whenever the associated p-value was below 0.05 

significance level, and very significant if p-value was below 0.01. For those variables exhibiting 

significant and very significant correlations, scatter plots were done for each pair of strongly correlated 

variables, using package ‘graphics’ (R Core Team and contributors worldwide, 2018a) from software 

R® - version 3.4.3 “Kite-Eating Tree” for Windows® (R Core Team, 2017).  

2.6.2 - Analysis of variance  

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to test the effects of: reforestation dominant type 

(Quercus suber, Quercus ilex or Pinus pinea); Pinus presence; shrubs’ spatial distribution; and finally 

soil type on each wild rabbit variable (total number of latrines; Kilometric Abundance Index; latrines’ 

diameter; average number of pellets; and pellets’ estimated age). Whenever results were different among 

groups (if the associated p-value was below 0.05), significant differences between certain groups were 

tested with Tukey post-hoc tests.  

One-way ANOVA analysis, as well as Tukey post-hoc testes, were designed with resource to 

package ‘stats’ (R Core Team and contributors worldwide, 2018b), whilst representative box-plots were 

obtained using package ‘graphics’ (R Core Team and contributors worldwide, 2018a), all from software 

R® - version 3.4.3 “Kite-Eating Tree” for Windows® (R Core Team, 2017). In the results presented 

afterwards, “ns” stands for non-significant results, significant results are marked with “*” if the p-value 

was below 0.05, and with “**” whenever the associated p-value was below 0.01.  

 

 

 



 

23 

 

2.7 - Buffers and land use cartography of sampling sites 

The area surrounding each sampling site was mapped to understand how the composition and 

structure of the landscape influence the presence and abundance of the wild rabbit in the study area. For 

this, polygons delimiting the total plantation areas were drawn using software Google Earth Pro®, 

version 7.3.1.4507 for Windows®, in which vegetation and soil sampling plots were set up. The resulting 

polygons’ file was later converted to shapefile format (.shp) to be used in ArcGIS® software, using 

ArcMap® 10.6, version 10.6 for Windows®. 

For each one of the sampling sites, buffers were constructed within a range of 250 meters around 

the polygons of the total plantation areas, as well as around the linear transects that were previously 

mapped. The decision to construct buffers for the linear transects (in addition to the plantation buffers) 

was taken because, in some of the sampling sites, the transects were either partially or totally outside 

the limit of the polygons that are representative of the plantations studied. Therefore, to obtain only a 

total area (a final buffer) representative of each sampling point, a “merge” of the transect and plantation 

buffers was carried out. For each final buffer, a cartography was elaborated at the level of soil occupation 

and use, focusing to a greater degree on the types of vegetation cover, the presence of water, and signs 

of human presence and occupation. The main land-use classes include: montados (dominated by pastures 

or by brushwoods), brushwoods, meadows and pastures, Pinus or Quercus plantations (either dominated 

by pastures, or by brushwoods), paved roads, houses and orchards, infrastructures (in use), ruins and 

abandoned wells, and water masses. The buffers, as well as all the cartography, were executed using 

ArcMap® 10.6 from ArcGIS® software, version 10.6 for Windows®. 

Once the land-use cartography for all the sampling sites was concluded, the total areas and 

respective percentages of each of the land-use classes and for each sampling site were calculated, using 

ArcMap® 10.6 from ArcGIS® software, version 10.6 for Windows®. 

The relations between the calculated areas and respective percentages for each land-use class and 

wild rabbit variables were tested once again with Spearman correlations, using IBM SPSS Statistics 

Base® software - version 22.0.0.0 for Windows® (IBM Corp., 2013). Correlations were considered 

significant whenever the associated p-value was below 0.05 significance level, and very significant if p-

value was below 0.01. For those variables showing significant and very significant correlations, scatter 

plots were made for each pair of strongly correlated variables, using Microsoft® Excel® 2016 MSO, 

version 16.0.6925.1044 for Windows®.

3. RESULTS  

3.1 - Characterisation of sampling sites 

In the study area, sampling sites were either carried out within cork-oak (Quercus suber), holm-

oak (Quercus ilex) and stone-pine (Pinus pinea) pure or mixed reforestations. When considering mixed 

reforestations of the previously referred species, there can be a significant variability concerning tree 

species’ densities. In this work, reforestations were analysed considering the dominant tree species 

(&gt;50% of present trees) and secondary species (&lt;50%), as shown in Table 3.1.  

 

Wild rabbit sampling sites were predominantly within Quercus suber dominant pure plantations 

(a total of 11 sampling sites), followed by two Quercus ilex dominant pure plantations and two Pinus 

pinea dominant pure plantations. In general, we can say that plantations dominated by Quercus suber 

were the most studied ones (12 sampling sites), followed by seven sampling sites whose plantations 

were dominated by Pinus pinea, which makes Quercus ilex the least studied reforestation species, 

present as a dominant species in only four sampling sites.  

When analysing pure plantations, Quercus suber was the overall dominant species, since it was 

present as a pure reforestation species in 11 sampling sites, followed by Quercus ilex and Pinus pinea, 

which were both only present in a total of two sampling sites, each as a pure plantation.  

If considering mixed plantations, the dominant ones were composed by Pinus pinea, which was 

present as a dominant species with Q. ilex in three sampling sites, followed by Pinus pinea dominant 

type with Q. suber present in only two sampling sites. After mixed plantations dominated by Pinus 

pinea, we have mixed plantations dominated by Q. ilex, which were mixed with Q. suber in two 

sampling sites; however, there were no sampling sites within Q. ilex dominant plantations with P. pinea. 

Although Quercus suber was the overall dominant species present within pure plantations, it was 

nevertheless the least representative one as a dominant species among mixed plantations, as it was only 

present as a dominant species with Pinus pinea in one sampling site.  

A general characterisation of the plantations that were studied in each sampling site was 

performed regarding each plantation’s total area (in hectares), reforestation type (pure or mixed 

plantation and planted species), and dominant species present within each plantation (Quercus suber, 

Quercus ilex or Pinus pinea) (Table 3.2).

From a general perspective, the plantation areas are quite variable, and sampling sites were mostly 

present within pure plantations (in a total of 15 plantations), mainly composed by Quercus suber (11 

sampling sites), followed by two sampling sites present in Q. ilex pure plantations, and one sampling 

site within a P. pinea pure plantation. Among the eight mixed plantations, P. pinea was clearly the 

dominant species, as it was present as a dominant species within five sampling sites, whereas Q. ilex 

was only dominant in two mixed plantations, and Q. suber was the least dominant species, present in 

only one sampling site carried out in mixed plantations.  

3.2 - Wild rabbit sampled sites 

3.2.1 - Characterisation of linear transects  

In this work, a total of 23 sampling sites were surveyed, covering six Portuguese municipalities, 

in which 36 linear foot-transects were walked to carry out wild rabbit traces’ prospections. The number 

of transects that were walked was variable among different reforestation dominant types, which had the 

highest values among reforestations dominated by Quercus suber and by Pinus pinea (Table 3.3). 

Alcoutim and Almodôvar municipalities were the most represented ones in which higher numbers of 

sampling sites and linear transects were performed, since a total of eight sampling sites were in

Alcoutim, in which 14 transects were walked; seven sampling sites and 11 transects were walked in 

Almodôvar (see Table 2 in Appendix).  

For the sampling sites where it was not possible to perform a continuous transect of 250 meters 

for rabbit sampling (due to spatial limitations related to the size of reforestation parcels), smaller transects 

were carried out to cover the total distance required for the sampling. The number of sampling sites in 

which respectively one and two linear transects were walked was the same (11 sampling sites for each), 

a total of three transects for one sampling site was carried out (see Table 2 in Appendix). 

Since it was not always possible to walk transects along dirt tracks, either due to spatial limitations 

within some reforestation parcels or to the absence of the most suitable tracks for latrines’ and pellets’ 

counts, the observer decided to carry out some transects directly through plantation lines and/or 

interlines, as previously mentioned. A total of ten transects were walked in dirt tracks, from a total of 

eight sampling sites, whereas 15 transects were walked directly along plantation lines and/or interlines 

in a total of ten sampled sites. A total of 11 transects were walked both in dirt tracks and along plantation 

lines/interlines in a total of five sampling sites (see Table 2 in Appendix). 

 

3.2.2 - Wild rabbit sampling strategy 

 

 In this work, a total of 23 Quercus suber, Quercus ilex and/or Pinus pinea plantations were 

sampled, in which a total of 372 latrines were detected within 20 sampling sites (Figure 3.1). For each 

sampling site, a total of 16 latrines were detected on average.

A total of 76 latrines were found along dirt tracks alone, whilst 215 latrines were found along 

plantation lines/interlines, and 81 latrines were detected in sampling sites where transects were carried 

out along both dirt tracks and plantation lines/interlines. Interestingly, the highest number of latrines 

were not found along dirt tracks, but instead along plantations’ lines/inter-lines within sampling sites. 

Dirt tracks alone were indeed the ones where the lowest number of latrines was detected (see Table 2 in 

Appendix).    

As mentioned earlier, a total of 36 transects were walked within the set of sampling sites. From 

these, 32 transects had positive results (all 372 wild rabbit latrines having been found), whilst the 

remaining 4 transects had a negative result in which rabbit latrines were not detected. This means that 

89% of transects had positive results (where latrines were found), while only 11% were negative 

(latrines’ absence).  

The highest number of latrines detected was within reforestations dominated by Pinus pinea and 

Quercus suber respectively, particularly in pure Q. suber dominant reforestations and in reforestations 

dominated by P. pinea, within P. pinea and Q. ilex mixed plantations. Reforestations dominated by 

Quercus ilex were the ones where smaller numbers of latrines were found (Table 3.4).

For each latrine found, average diameters were obtained and then organised in such a way as to 

obtain a latrines’ size index for each sampling site, which is graphically presented in Figure 3.2. The 

values for each pre-established latrines’ average diameter classes that were used to obtain the latrines’ 

size index can be found in Table 3 within the Appendix. Sampling sites exhibiting higher values for this 

index correspond in a natural way to the sampling sites with higher number of latrines detected. 

 

In the same way, an estimated number of pellets within each latrine found was obtained and then 

used to calculate a pellets’ quantity index for each sampling site, as presented in Figure 3.3. The values 

for each pre-established pellets’ average number classes that were used to obtain the pellets’ quantity 

index can be found in Table 4 within the Appendix. As previously stated, sampled sites exhibiting higher 

pellets’ quantity indexes are indeed the ones where more latrines were detected.  

 

For each latrine found, pellets’ approximate age was estimated based on pellets’ colour and 

integrity at the time of sampling, and a pellets’ estimated age index was obtained. Pellets within the 

category ‘old and recent’ were the most representative ones, found within a total of 205 latrines, 

followed by the category ‘very old and old’ within 145 latrines, and finally the category ‘old’ as the 

least represented one, with only 22 latrines found in which pellets corresponded to that category.

Wild rabbits’ relative abundance 

As previously mentioned, in this work the wild rabbit’s relative abundance was obtained through 

the calculation of a Kilometric Abundance Index (KAI), using the total number of latrines found within 

each sampling site and the total distance covered that was required for this sampling, converted into km 

(250 meters, either carried out in one transect, or more if necessary to complete the required distance). 

Within the study area, the higher values for the Kilometric Abundance Index were found in a total of 9 

sampling sites, ranging from 128 to 268 latrines per km. Kilometric Abundance Index values for the 

wild rabbit in the study area are presented in Figure 3.4. Figure 3.5 gives us a general idea of how the 

Kilometric Abundance Index varies among the set of sampling sites. In Table 3.5 are the main results 

regarding wild rabbit latrines and pellets’ counts.

Regarding the possibility of approaching local landowners to obtain information concerning wild 

rabbits’ diseases and/or management actions within the sampling sites, it was unfortunately not possible 

to obtain such information, as the latter was dependent upon local landlords’ presence and/or 

receptiveness to questions at the time of sampling, and to their own lack of knowledge regarding this 

matter.  

 

3.2.3 - Correlations  

Correlations between wild rabbit variables 

In this section we present the main results regarding Spearman correlations obtained between the 

set of wild rabbit latrines and pellets’ variables with each other (Table 3.6). In the results presented 

afterwards, “ns” stands for non-significant results, significant results are marked with “*” if the associ-

ated p-value was below 0.05, and with “**” whenever the associated p-value was below 0.01. 

Correlation results between the set of wild rabbit variables studied show that they are all signifi-

cantly related with each other. These variables are strongly correlated with each other, since their asso-

ciated p-values were always below 0.01, as presented in Table 3.6. The number of latrines and Kilo-

metric Abundance Index are more correlated with latrines’ average diameter (r=0.972; p&lt;0.01), and

pellets’ average number (r=0.938; p&lt;0.01). Moreover, there seems to be a strong relation between the 

average number of pellets and latrines’ average diameter (r=0.962; p&lt;0.01). As for pellets’ estimated 

age, it was more strongly related to pellets’ average number (r=0.627; p=0.001). 

 

3.2.4 - Relationships between wild rabbit variables and indicators of the success of reforestations

  

Correlations  

In this section we present tables that encompass the main results of Spearman correlations ob-

tained between the set of wild rabbit variables with the indicators of the success of reforestations previ-

ously mentioned (vegetation structure and complexity) and other abiotic variables such as soil, topogra-

phy and climatic variables.  

The tables below include Spearman correlation coefficient values (r) for the correlations obtained 

between the variables previously referred to. In the results presented afterwards, “ns” stands for non-

significant results, significant results are marked with “*” if the associated p-value was below 0.05, and 

with “**” whenever the associated p-value was below 0.01.  

The correlations between wild rabbit variables and the indicators of the success of reforestations, 

particularly the ones related to the tree layer and to shrubby and herbaceous layers (under canopy con-

ditions), are presented below in Table 3.7.  

It is possible to state that tree height’s standard deviation for all tree species present within the 

studied reforestations is inversely related to the set of wild rabbit variables; pellets’ estimated age and 

latrines’ average diameter are the most affected ones (for pellets’ estimated age: r=-0.525, p=0.010; for 

latrines’ average diameter: r=-0.523, p=0.010). In fact, this was the only strong correlation verified for 

pellets’ estimated age. On the other hand, pellets’ average number was negatively influenced by shrub 

species richness, either without considering or including Quercus suber seedlings (without seedlings: 

r=-0.492, p=0.017; including Oak seedlings: r=-0.505, p=0.014), followed by latrines’ average diameter 

(without seedlings: r=-0.463, p=0.026; including Quercus spp. seedlings: r=-0.479, p=0.021). Moreover, 

pellets’ average number seems to be the most negatively influenced by herbaceous and moss cover (r=-

0.534, p=0.009), as well as latrines’ average diameter (r=-0.506, p=0.014).

The correlations between wild rabbit variables and the indicators of the success of reforestations, 

specifically the ones regarding soil, topography and climatic parameters, are presented below in Table 

3.8.  

The number of latrines and Kilometric Abundance Index are particularly affected by the content 

of soil organic matter (r=-0.439; p=0.036), followed by latrines’ average diameter (r=-0.423; p=0.044). 

Pellets’ average number and estimated age, on the other hand, were not (significantly) affected. As for 

topography, only latrines’ average diameter was strongly influenced by high altitude (r=-0.462; 

p=0.030). Concerning climate features, wild rabbit variables seem to be affected by different factors. 

Latrines’ average diameter was the most significantly affected by higher aridity indexes (r= -0.486, 

p=0.019), followed by pellets’ average number (r=-0.420, p=0.046). Latrines’ average diameter, as well 

as number of latrines and Kilometric Abundance Index, were positively correlated with annual mean 

temperature (latrines’ average diameter: r=0.472, p=0.023; number of latrines and KAI: r=0.445, 

p=0.033), and with temperature seasonality (latrines’ average diameter: r=0.517, p=0.014; number of 

latrines and KAI: r=0.444, p=0.038). Pellets’ average number was also promoted by temperature sea-

sonality (r=0.489, p=0.021). On the other hand, both latrines’ average diameter, number of latrines and 

KAI were inversely related to annual mean precipitation (for latrines’ average diameter: r=-0.476, 

p=0.022; for number of latrines and KAI: r=-0.465, p=0.025). Furthermore, latrines’ average diameter 

was the only one strongly related in a negative way with the precipitation of the wettest month (r=-

0.435, p=0.043).

Analyses of variance  

Within this section we present the main results of a One-way ANOVA analysis that were 

conducted to test the effects between different environmental parameters on the set of wild rabbit 

variables that were studied. The effects of the following environmental parameters - reforestation 

dominant type (reforestations dominated by Quercus suber, Quercus ilex or Pinus pinea); Pinus 

presence (Pinus pinea presence or absence within sampling sites); shrubs’ spatial distribution (shrubs’ 

absence; uniformly dispersed shrubs; shrubs distributed in patches; shrubs’ continuous cloak); dominant 

soil type (litossoil or luvissoil) - were tested for each wild rabbit variable (number of latrines; Kilometric 

Abundance Index; latrines’ diameter; number of pellets; pellets’ age). Figure 3.6 presents representative 

box plots for the most significant results obtained.  

With respect to the reforestation dominant type (reforestations dominated by Quercus suber, 

Quercus ilex or by Pinus pinea), there were no significant differences in either of the rabbit variables 

studied between reforestation types. The number of latrines, as well as the Kilometric Abundance Index, 

were both not significantly different between reforestation dominant types (F2,20=1.434, p=0.262), 

although these were (slightly) variable between sites, especially among reforestations dominated by Q. 

suber. Furthermore, latrines’ average diameter was also not significantly different between reforestation 

types (F2,20=0.940, p=0.407), although they were more variable among Q. suber dominant reforestations. 

In the same way, significant differences were not detected in pellets’ average number (F2,20=0.400, 

p=0.676), nor in pellets’ estimated age (F2,20=1.080, p=0.359) between different reforestation types, 

despite a tendency for a higher variability concerning pellets’ average number among reforestations 

dominated by Q. suber, and similarly for pellets’ estimated age’s higher variability in P. pinea dominant 

reforestations.  

Regarding Pinus presence (Pinus pinea presence or absence), there were also not detected any 

significant differences in either of the studied rabbit variables between Pinus presence or absence within 

sampling sites. As such, the number of latrines and Kilometric Abundance Index were not significantly 

different between sites where Pinus was present and sites where it was not present (F1,21=0.054, 

p=0.812), despite a higher variability in both number of latrines and KAI between sites, especially 

among sites where P. pinea was absent. Moreover, there were also no significant differences in latrines’ 

average diameter (F1,21=0.097, p=0.759) between sites with presence of Pinus and with no presence of 

Pinus, although it was more variable between sites, particularly the ones where Pinus pinea was not 

present. Following this tendency, pellets’ average number also did not reveal any significant differences 

between sites where Pinus was present and where it was absent (F1,21=1.327e-05, p=0.997); however, it 

was more variable between sites, especially within the ones where there are no Pinus. Similarly, there 

were no significant differences in pellets’ estimated age (F1,21=0.069, p=0.796) between Pinus presence 

or absence within sampling sites.    

Concerning shrub’s differential spatial distribution among sampling sites, no significant 

differences were detected for either of the considered wild rabbit variables between different shrub’s 

spatial distribution within sampled sites. With that said, there were no significant differences in the 

number of latrines, nor in Kilometric Abundance Index (F3,19=1.393, p=0.276), between different 

shrubs’ spatial distribution within sampling sites, despite a higher variability between sites, especially 

among the ones where shrubs were dominantly distributed within patches. As for latrines’ average 

diameter, it was not significantly different between sites with differences in shrubs’ spatial distribution 

(F3,19=1.383, p=0.278), although diameters varied more especially between sites presenting shrubs 

mainly distributed within patches. In a similar way, pellets' average number was also not significantly 

different between sites with shrubs' heterogeneous spatial distribution (F3,19=2.621, p= 0.081), even 

though the number of pellets was more variable between sites in which shrubs were predominantly 



 

34 

 

distributed in patches. Finally, there were also no significant differences in pellets' estimated age 

(F3,19=0.252, p=0.859) between sampled sites exhibiting differential shrubs' spatial distribution.   

In terms of the dominant soil type (litossoil or luvissoil within sampled sites), there were no 

significant differences in either of the considered rabbit variables between different soil types within 

sampled sites. Therefore, no significant differences were found in the number of latrines, nor in 

Kilometric Abundance Index (F1,21=0.402, p=0.533), between sites dominated by litossoil and 

dominated by luvissoil, although these were slightly more variable between sites that were dominated 

by litossoils. Similarly, there were no significant differences in latrines’ average diameter (F1,21=0.381, 

p=0.544) between litossoil dominant sites and luvissoil dominant sites, despite a higher variability in 

diameters between sites dominated by litossoils. Pellets’ average number was also not significantly 

different between litossoil dominant sites and luvissoil dominant sites (F1,21=0.168, p=0.686), although 

their numbers were quite variable between sites dominated by litossoils. There were also no significant 

differences in pellets’ estimated age (F1,21=0.357, p=0.557) between sites dominated by litossoils and 

sites dominated by luvissoils.  

Taking into consideration the ANOVA results obtained and previously described, and since there 

were no significant differences found among any of the tested groups (ANOVA associated p-values 

were never below 0.05), Tukey post-hoc tests were not carried out.

3.2.5 - Buffers and land-use cartography 

Once the buffers within a range of 250 meters around both the plantations’ polygons and the linear 

transects were designed and later “merged”, land-use cartography was carried out for each buffer, which 

was mainly focused on the types of vegetation cover, the presence of water, and finally infrastructures 

and buildings associated with human presence and occupation (Figure 3.7).  

The final land-use classes include the following: Quercus and Pinus plantations, either dominated 

by pastures or by brushwoods; Montado, either dominated by pastures or by brushwoods; brushwoods; 

meadows and pastures; water masses; paved roads; houses and orchards; infrastructures; ruins and 

abandoned wells.  

For the case of the Montados and the plantations, it was decided to create two different classes 

for each according to the predominance of either pastures or brushwoods, having been decided that each 

class would be dominated by pastures or by brushwoods every time the approximate percentage of 

visible cover of pastures or brushwoods in the ArcMap's map was superior to 50% inside the respective 

polygon for that class. The same reasoning was used when considering Quercus and Pinus plantation 

land-use classes.  

As for the class “water masses”, it includes lakes, lagoons, rivers, rivulets and respective riparian 

galleries, dams, among any other water masses.  

The land-use class “houses and orchards” refers to any kind of house with associated orchards 

that shows signs of human occupation and/or appropriation, whilst the class “infrastructures” regards 

any other structure associated with human presence, but that are not permanently inhabited and/or used 

(in which there is a residual human presence and use that is not recurrent, but still not abandoned) and 

without any associated vegetation, such as storerooms and warehouses, depots, factories, sanctuaries, 

parking lots, and sheds, among others. Lastly, the class “ruins and abandoned wells” refers to any 

structure or building associated with human presence that is currently abandoned, including abandoned 

orchards. In Figures 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11 are presented illustrative examples for each land-use class 

that were designed for the cartography of each sampling site. 

 

Figure 3.7 - Example of a final buffer prior to the land-use cartography. 

Final buffers (resulting from the “merge” between plantation buffers and linear 

transect buffers) include the plantation polygon and the linear transects that 

were carried out for wild rabbit sampling.

Once the land-use cartography was performed, the total areas and respective percentages for each 

land-use class were obtained for each sampling site. A general characterisation of the main land uses 

and occupation within the study area are presented in Table 3.9, whilst the total areas for the main land-

use classes created in the cartography for each sampling site can be found in Table 3.10. Figure 3.12 

shows a representation of the general percentages of each land-use class for the global set of sampling 

sites in the study area.  

Among the set of land-use classes, it is possible to state that plantations (dominated by Quercus 

or Pinus) are the most representative class, as it had the highest area and relative percentage (almost 

50% of the total land occupation in the study area). Quercus plantations dominated by pastures seem to 

be the dominant ones in the sampling sites (approximately 36% of total land use). Montados are the 

most representative habitat right after Quercus plantations (present in a total of 33.81% of the study 

area), being montados dominated by pastures the ones with higher presence (24.35%). Pinus plantations 

are the dominant land-use after montados (occupying approximately 11% of the study area), being the 

ones dominated by pastures the most represented ones (6.91%). Meadows and pastures are the dominant 

landscape present in the study area following Pinus plantations (7.90% of the land use in the set of 

sampling sites). Brushwoods are only present in 3.18% of the sampling sites’ area, whereas the land-use 

classes associated with human presence and/or occupation (paved roads; houses and orchards; 

infrastructures, and finally ruins and abandoned wells) only represent 3.09% of the land use of the study 

area, “houses and orchards” (1.75%) and “paved roads” (1.12%) being the dominant ones. Water masses 

are the least represented habitat in the study area, as they are only present in 1% of the study area.

and/or occupation created in the cartography.  (top left) - “houses and

Table 3.10 - Total areas of the main land-use classes created in the cartography and buffers' total area according 

to each sampling site. Quercus and Pinus plantations, as well as Montados, include both categories dominated by 

pastures and by brushwoods; the general denomination “Human presence and/or occupation” includes the sum of the 

areas of the land-use classes “paved roads”; “houses and orchards”; “infrastructures”, and “ruins and abandoned wells”. 



 

39 

 

 

The cartography of the main land uses, and occupation carried out within the set of 23 sampling 

sites (Figure 3.13), showed that the study area is characterized by a heterogeneous landscape with 

mosaics of differential landscapes and habitats that include vegetation-related habitats (Quercus suber, 

Quercus ilex and Pinus pinea pure or mixed plantations; montados; meadows and pastures, and 

brushwoods); habitats related to the presence of water (water masses), as well as habitats associated to 

human presence and/or occupation (houses; infrastructures; ruins and abandoned wells, and paved 

roads).

Correlations between wild rabbit variables and habitat variables 

In this section, the main results regarding Spearman correlations carried out between the set of 

previously obtained wild rabbit variables (total number of latrines; Kilometric Abundance Index; 

pellets’ average number; latrines’ average number, and finally pellets’ estimated age) with 

landscape/habitat variables obtained from the land-use cartography performed for the set of sampling 

sites (calculated areas and respective percentages of each land-use class created in the cartography), are 

presented below in Tables 3.11 and 3.12. In the results presented afterwards, “ns” stands for non-

significant results, significant results are marked with “*” if the associated p-value was below 0.05, and 

with “**” whenever the associated p-value was below 0.01.  

Regarding the correlations obtained between rabbit variables and the total areas for each land-use 

class (Table 3.11), results showed that there were significant correlations between all of the wild rabbit 

variables (except for the variable “pellets’ estimated age”, which did not correlate significantly with any 

of the studied habitat variables) with habitat variables related to vegetation cover (pastures and 

montados), and to human’s presence and/or occupation (infrastructures, houses and ruins). Rabbit 

variables were significant and positively correlated to the land-use class “meadows and pastures”, being 

latrines’ average diameter, the variable exhibiting the highest correlation (r=0.496, p=0.016), followed 

by pellets’ average number (r=0.480, p=0.020), whilst Kilometric Abundance Index was the least 

correlated one (r=0.454, p=0.030). As for the land-use class “montados dominated by brushwoods”, it 

was highly and inversely correlated with latrines’ average diameter (r=-0.541, p=0.008), then with 

pellets’ average number (r=-0.532, p=0.009), and finally with the Kilometric Abundance Index (r=-

0.497, p=0.016). As for the variables concerning human presence and occupation, rabbit variables were 

particularly correlated in a highly significant manner with the land-use class “infrastructures”, pellets’ 

average number being the one with the most significant relation (r=0.652, p=0.001), followed by 

latrines’ average diameter (r=0.615, p=0.002), and finally by the Kilometric Abundance Index (r=0.568, 

p=0.005). The land-use class “houses and orchards” was also significantly correlated to rabbit variables, 

once again pellets’ average number being the one with the most significant relation (r=0.614, p=0.002), 

then latrines’ average diameter (r=0.595, p=0.003), and finally the Kilometric Abundance Index with 

the lowest correlation (r=0.470, p=0.024). Lastly, the land-use class “ruins and abandoned wells” only 

showed significant correlations with two rabbit variables: first with pellets’ average number (r=0.442, 

p=0.035), and then with latrines’ average diameter (r=0.421, p=0.045).

The correlation results between rabbit variables and the percentages of occupation of each land-

use class (Table 3.12) show us that all rabbit variables (except pellets’ estimated age) were significantly 

related to habitat variables concerning vegetation cover and human presence and/or occupation, 

exhibiting significant and very significant correlations with the percentages of occupation of the land-

use classes “meadows and pastures”, “montados dominated by brushwoods”, “infrastructures”, “houses 

and orchards” and “ruins and abandoned wells”. However, in general the correlations were slightly lower 

than the ones verified for the areas of each land-use class, except for the correlations between land-use 

classes “meadows and pastures”, in which all rabbit variables exhibited higher correlation coefficient 

values than the ones obtained for the areas of that class, particularly the variable latrines’ average 

diameter, which had a highly significant correlation with pastures that did not happen in the correlations 

between the total areas (for Kilometric Abundance Index: r=0.487, r=0.019; for pellets’ average number: 

r=0.505, p=0.014; for latrines’ average diameter: r=0.531, p=0.009). Moreover, the class “montados 

dominated by brushwoods” also had very significant correlations with pellets’ average number and 

latrines’ average diameter, although the one with pellets’ average number was stronger (r=-0.539, 

p=0.008) than the other correlations, which were lower when compared to the same correlations with 

the total areas (for Kilometric Abundance Index: r=-0.489, p=0.018; for latrines’ average diameter: r=-

0.528, p=0.010). As for the variables related to human presence and occupation, in a general perspective 

the correlation results are similar: all rabbit variables were highly related to the land-use class 

“infrastructures”; however, the coefficient values are lower than the ones for the correlations between 

the land-use classes’ areas (for Kilometric Abundance Index: r=0.550, p=0.007; for pellets’ average 

number: r=0.616, p=0.002; for latrines’ average diameter: r=0.598, p=0.003). Similarly, the land-use 

class “houses and orchards” also had a significant correlation with the Kilometric Abundance Index, 

although lower than the one verified for the area of that class (r=0.454, p=0.029), and very significant 

correlations with both pellets’ average number (r=0.600, p=0.002) and latrines’ average diameter 

(r=0.585, p=0.003), always lower than the correlation coefficient values obtained for that land-use class’ 

area. As for the land-use class “ruins and abandoned wells”, it was only significantly correlated with the 

variable pellets’ average number, although exhibiting a lower coefficient value compared to the one 

obtained for the land-use class’ area (r=0.419, p=0.047).

4. DISCUSSION 

In this work, 23 sampling sites within cork-oak, holm-oak and stone-pine reforestations were 

studied in a total of six municipalities of the Alentejo region in continental Portugal along an aridity 

gradient, in order to understand whether the European wild rabbit can be a good ecological indicator of 

the success of reforestations.  

From a general perspective, the set of sampling sites was quite heterogeneous, as most of the sites 

were present within pure plantations primarily dominated by Quercus suber and in mixed plantations 

that were mostly dominated by Pinus pinea, but with sampling sites located within reforestations with 

different combinations of the target species. Moreover, plantations’ total areas were quite variable, 

which influenced the number of linear transects that could be walked in each sampling site. Despite that, 

the number of sampling sites in which respectively one and two linear transects were walked was the 

same, which contributed to a more homogeneous and accurate sampling and data treatment.  

A total of 36 linear foot-transects were walked to perform wild rabbit latrines and pellets’ counts 

to obtain a Kilometric Abundance Index for the study area. For each sampling site, approximately 16 

latrines were detected on average, and a total of 372 latrines were detected within 20 sampling sites. In 

the end, the results were quite successful given that, within the set of sampling sites, rabbit latrines were 

found in a total of 32 transects (89% of transects with positive results), against only four transects where 

no latrines were found (11% of transects with negative results). When considering the number of latrines 

found along dirt tracks or along plantation lines/interlines, we can say that the results were quite variable 

and surprising, given that the highest number of latrines were not found along dirt tracks alone, but 

instead along plantations’ lines/inter-lines within sampling sites. This could be since a large number of 

transects were walked along plantation lines/interlines, to the fact that the nature of this terrain resembles 

that of the dirt track terrain (being favourable locations to deposit latrines), and to the favourable soil 

substrates of lines for the construction of burrows. Also, the highest number of latrines detected was 

within reforestations dominated by Pinus pinea and Quercus suber respectively, while reforestations 

dominated by Quercus ilex were the ones where smaller numbers of latrines were found. This could be 

related to the fact that a considerable proportion of sampling sites were located within Quercus suber 

and Pinus pinea plantations and fewer in those of Quercus ilex, or possibly to the observers’ different 

detectability levels of rabbit latrines and pellets within different reforestation types.  

As for the correlations between the set of wild rabbit variables (number of latrines; Kilometric 

Abundance Index; latrines’ average diameter; pellets’ average number, and finally pellets’ estimated 

age), the results obtained revealed, as highly expected, that they are all strongly correlated with each 

other. These results are both statistically and empirically plausible, given that all correlations between 

each wild rabbit variable were statistically significant, all the variables obtained refer to rabbit latrines 

and pellets’ features, and are in accordance with the observations and the data obtained during rabbit 

field sampling. The perfect correlation between the number of latrines and the Kilometric Abundance 

Index is because KAI is an abundance index that was directly calculated using the number of latrines. 

The highly significant positive correlation between the number of latrines and the Kilometric Abundance 

Index with latrines’ average diameter (r=0.972; p&lt;0.01) can be explained by rabbits’ social preference 

and tendency for certain areas to deposit their pellets. Since pellets’ accumulation within latrines is a 

vital socialization event among rabbit groups, to which they dedicate a significant amount of their time 

(Gálvez-Bravo 2011; Virgós et al. 2003), it is only right that there is a greater number of latrines in such 

favourable areas, which occupy higher spaces in the soil, and that will naturally be reflected in higher 

latrine diameters. Moreover, a higher number of pellets present in the soil over time illustrate wild 

rabbits’ suitability for these areas, so if the same areas remain suitable for them, rabbits will recurrently 

deposit their droppings and tend to choose the same specific locations for their latrines (Fernandez-de-

Simon et al. 2011; Sneddon 1991). Therefore, it is expected to see an increase in the number of pellets 



 

43 

 

with a natural equal increase in the number of latrines, which occurs in rabbits’ preferential faecal 

accumulation sites, which explains the significant correlation between the KAI and pellets’ average 

number (r=0.938; p&lt;0.01). Similarly, there was a significant relation between the number of latrines and 

the Kilometric Abundance Index with pellets’ estimated age (r=0.592; p=0.003). If older pellets have 

been deposited in the soil for longer periods of time than other more recent ones, such pellet deposition 

is more likely to continue happening over time within more favourable areas for rabbits where it 

happened in the past, which can explain the increase in the number of latrines found in such regions 

(Gonçalves 2015; Morgado 2008). Moreover, the average number of pellets was highly correlated with 

latrines’ average diameter (r=0.962; p&lt;0.01). Considering that, as previously pointed out, rabbits tend 

to deposit their pellets within certain suitable areas in a social context (Ferreira 2003; Gálvez et al. 2008; 

Sneddon 1991), it is alleged that more deposited pellets over time will occupy larger areas in the soil, 

which potentially explains the expected increase in latrines’ diameters.  

Furthermore, pellets’ average number and pellets’ estimated age were also significantly correlated 

with each other (r=0.627; p=0.001), which could also be explained by a significant preference of rabbits 

for certain regions in the soil, in which they would frequently deposit their pellets, thus establishing their 

latrines, in the past. In this way, the more advanced age of pellets, associated with higher pellet numbers 

present in the soil, potentially illustrate wild rabbits’ preference in the past for such areas. In the same 

way, clearly there is a highly significant positive correlation between latrines’ average diameter and 

pellets’ estimated age (r=0.611; p=0.002). Higher latrine diameters are generally associated with a larger 

number of pellets present in the soil, which will be increasingly older according to rabbits’ faecal 

deposition during past periods.  

Regarding the correlations between rabbit variables and environmental parameters that stand for 

both habitat structure and complexity and climate factors of the reforestations studied, results show that 

rabbit variables were significantly related to a total of 11 environmental variables. From these, only one 

parameter concerning the tree layer (standard deviation of tree height) was significantly correlated to 

wild rabbit variables. Two environmental parameters dealt with under canopy conditions, one of which 

was related to shrub communities (shrub species richness and shrub species richness including Quercus 

spp. seedlings), while the other was related to herbaceous plants (herbaceous and moss cover). 

Furthermore, there was only one parameter concerning soil features (soil organic matter content) that 

was correlated with the wild rabbit, solely one parameter about topography (altitude), and finally five 

climatic parameters (aridity index; annual mean temperature; temperature seasonality; annual mean 

precipitation; precipitation of the wettest month). 

It is possible to say that, from the set of obtained correlations between reforestation’s 

environmental parameters and wild rabbit variables, only some of them can be considered plausible 

from both a statistical and empirical perspective. Having said this, only the parameters that concern the 

tree layer (standard deviation of tree height), topography (altitude), and climatic ones (aridity index; 

annual mean temperature; temperature seasonality; annual mean precipitation; precipitation of the 

wettest month) actually make sense and can be considered as plausible from a statistical and empirical 

point of view, as they are in accordance with the expected results concerning the wild rabbit’s behavior 

and distribution in relation to such environmental parameters (Ferreira 2003; Gálvez-Bravo 2011; 

Gonçalves 2015; LPN 2014). Tree height’s standard deviation seems to have a negative influence on 

the wild rabbit, since they were inversely related to each other. This relation denotes tree height 

heterogeneity’s negative effect on wild rabbits’ presence (number of latrines) and abundance 

(Kilometric Abundance Index). This is a plausible result, as it is known that rabbits’ most suitable areas 

generally include a homogeneous tree substrate which can give higher shading and protection against 

predators. Rather than heterogeneity within tree heights and forestry structure (which may not guarantee 

shading and protection against predators in such an efficient way), rabbits do indeed prefer heterogeneity 



 

44 

 

within shrubby and herbaceous communities’ structure, allowing for rabbits’ easier shifts between 

feeding and protection areas (Ferreira 2003; Gonçalves 2015). It also seems that rabbit’s presence and 

abundance decreases as plantations grow older in successional terms. This could be explained by the 

fact that older plantations may have a more homogeneous spatial structure because of brushwoods’ 

clearance operations, as part of maintenance and management practices in the plantations over the years. 

Shrubs’ clearance reduces the spatial heterogeneity of the plantations, especially concerning shrub and 

herbaceous patches, which makes them less suitable habitats for rabbits.  

Among topography parameters, altitude was the only one significantly related to the wild rabbit, 

although it was only inversely related to latrines’ average diameter. This inverse relation between 

altitude and the wild rabbit is once again plausible either in statistical and empirical perspectives, as it 

is consistent with the wild rabbit’s habitat suitability requirements, being known that rabbits tend not to 

be present in regions above 1500 m (Smith &amp;amp; Boyer 2008). Regarding climatic parameters, the aridity 

index was inversely related to some wild rabbit variables. This inverse relation is also plausible in this 

work, as it is known, and has been proven within the context of the AdaptforChange Project, that aridity 

(along with precipitation) is indeed one of the most limiting ecological factors for vegetation growth 

within Mediterranean regions (Príncipe et al. 2014). This is particularly noticeable within dryland 

forests, as increasing aridity affects quite negatively trees’ growth, trees, shrubs and herbaceous 

productivity, besides interfering in soil quality. Given the vital importance of habitat and landscape 

structure and the complexity parameters of the wild rabbit’s distribution and abundance, it makes perfect 

sense that rabbits tend not to be so abundant within areas characterized by impoverished tree, shrubs 

and herbaceous layers and weak soils. Independently of this inverse relation, according to these results 

rabbits seem to prefer regions that are more arid and dry, even though these regions are usually 

associated with a lower biomass of herbaceous species (herbaceous plants being the vital food source 

for rabbits, this was an unexpected result). The fact that rabbits are not so present in regions with higher 

herbaceous biomass and higher precipitation rates may be explained by the possible negative influence 

of precipitation (inundation) on the integrity of burrows where rabbit cubs and juveniles are safe, directly 

interfering in their reproduction and in cubs and juveniles’ survival. In those regions, the limiting effect 

of precipitation plays a more dominant role in determining habitat’s suitability rather than the abundant 

presence of herbaceous plants. Furthermore, annual mean temperature, as well as temperature 

seasonality, were both positively related to wild rabbits’ variables, which were also expected, as it 

suggests and reinforces temperature’s vital positive roles in the wild rabbit’s presence and abundance in 

the study area through the promotion of food availability and rabbit reproduction (Fernández 2005; 

Gálvez-Bravo 2011; LPN 2014; Martins et al. 2003). On the other hand, both annual mean precipitation 

and precipitation of the wettest month were inversely related to some wild rabbit variables. This is quite 

a plausible result that is not surprising at all, since rabbits do indeed usually avoid areas with high 

precipitation rates due to precipitation’s negative influence and effects on wild rabbit’s food supplies 

and reproductive rates, thus directly interfering in their presence and abundance (Fernández 2005; 

Gálvez-Bravo 2011; Gonçalves 2015; LPN 2014; Martins et al. 2003).  

On the other hand, the parameters related to under canopy conditions (shrubs and herbaceous 

communities), and to soil features (organic matter content), which were expected to be the most 

relevantly related to the wild rabbit (given the strict relation between habitat favorability and the wild 

rabbit’s presence and abundance), were precisely the ones that showed inverse relations that are not 

coherent, either statistically nor empirically speaking. The inverse relations found between shrub species 

richness (number of shrub species), either including or not including Quercus spp. seedlings, herbaceous 

and moss cover, and finally soil organic matter content, with wild rabbit variables do not make sense 

either in statistical terms, or in empirical ones, as they are not in accordance with wild rabbits’ known 

and expected habitat requisites and behaviour. This result does not necessarily mean that the number of 



 

45 

 

shrub species, whether oak seedlings are included or not, as well as herbaceous and moss cover and soil 

organic matter content, have a negative influence upon wild rabbits’ behavior, presence and abundance, 

especially with regard to latrines and pellets’ deposition, as can be assumed by their statistical relation 

and significance. Alternatively, these results are most likely explained by the fact that a higher number 

of shrub species, especially when the number of oak seedlings is included, a higher herbaceous and moss 

cover, and higher soil organic matter content, directly interfere in latrines and pellets’ detectability level 

by the observer at the time of sampling, having a significant impact on the efficiency of latrines and 

pellets’ detection. This is unfortunately a technical limitation related to the method applied within this 

work, as it solely involved wild rabbit traces’ prospections, which are highly dependent on the subjective 

detectability levels of the observer to visually detect presence traces. Although there was no correlation 

found between any of the wild rabbit variables studied with shrub cover, we should highlight in this 

point that, within the three sampling sites where no latrines were found, two of them were precisely the 

ones that had the highest values of shrub cover. The absence of latrines in those sites may be explained 

precisely by the significant shrub presence and consequent lack of transitional opened areas, which are 

unsuitable areas for rabbits. On the other hand, dense vegetation cover has a relevant direct interference 

upon the detectability levels of pellets and other presence signs by the observer at the time of sampling, 

which was most likely what occurred in the perspective of the present work.  

As for the results concerning ANOVA analysis performed to test the effects between 

environmental parameters on the set of wild rabbit variables studied, they did not show any significant 

differences in either of the rabbit variables studied. No significant differences were detected between: 

reforestation dominant type (reforestations dominated by Quercus suber, Quercus ilex or Pinus pinea); 

Pinus presence (Pinus pinea presence or absence within sampling sites); shrubs’ spatial distribution 

(shrubs’ absence; uniformly dispersed shrubs; shrubs distributed in patches; shrubs’ continuous cloak); 

dominant soil type (litossoil or luvissoil) with the set of wild rabbit variables considered (number of  

latrines; Kilometric Abundance Index; latrines’ diameter; number of pellets; pellets’ age). 

The correlations obtained between the set of rabbit variables and environmental variables 

associated with the studied reforestations suggest a lack of association between wild rabbits’ abundance 

and environmental parameters that are representative of habitat’s structure and complexity within 

reforestations that aid in evaluating their success.  

With that said, it was decided to perform a spatial analysis of the diversity of land uses and 

occupation around the set of sampling sites through the design of buffers within a range of 250 meters 

around both the linear transects and the plantations’ polygons and land-use cartography within such 

buffers that was mainly focused on the types of vegetation cover, the presence of water, and finally 

infrastructures and buildings associated with human presence and occupation, as these are 

environmental and landscape parameters that are specially relevant for the wild rabbit’s presence and 

abundance in a certain region. As previously mentioned, the decision to create buffers within a range of 

250 meters around both the linear transects and around the plantations' polygons and obtaining a final 

"merged" buffer that included transects' buffer and plantations' buffer was due to the fact that, in some 

sampling sites, transects were carried out either partially or completely outside the limits of the studied 

plantations. Creating a so called "final" buffer seemed to be the most plausible course of action to 

overcome that spatial heterogeneity of transects' location within sampling sites and to perform a more 

homogeneous cartography around sampling sites.  

The cartography of the main land uses and occupation carried out showed that the set of sampling 

sites are characterized by a heterogeneous landscape with mosaics of differential landscapes and habitats 

that include vegetation-related habitats (Quercus suber, Quercus ilex and Pinus pinea pure or mixed 

plantations, either dominated by pastures or by brushwoods; montados, either dominated by pastures or 

by brushwoods; meadows and pastures, and brushwoods); habitats related to the presence of water 



 

46 

 

(water masses), as well as habitats associated with human presence and/or occupation (houses and 

orchards; infrastructures; ruins and abandoned wells, and paved roads). In a general overview, 

plantations are the dominant land-use class occupying almost 50% of the total land occupation in the 

study area, Quercus plantations dominated by pastures being the dominant ones. Montados are the most 

representative habitat right after Quercus plantations, once again the ones dominated by pastures 

representing the most frequent ones, then Pinus plantations (dominated by pastures), followed by 

meadows and pastures, brushwoods, then the land-use classes associated with human presence and/or 

occupation, the dominant ones being the classes “houses and orchards” and “paved roads” , and finally 

the least represented habitat are water masses, only present in 1% of the study area. 

Spearman correlations were carried out between the set of wild rabbit variables and the calculated 

areas and respective percentages of occupation of each land-use class created in the cartography, which 

stand for habitat/landscape variables. The results revealed that there were significant correlations 

between all the wild rabbit variables (except pellets’ estimated age) with habitat variables concerning 

vegetation cover: meadows &amp;amp; pastures and montados dominated by brushwoods, and concerning 

human’s presence and/or occupation: infrastructures, houses &amp;amp; orchards and ruins &amp;amp; abandoned wells. 

This was valid for both correlations done between each land-use classes’ areas and for the percentages 

of occupation of each land-use class within the set of sampling sites.  

Rabbit variables were significantly and positively correlated with the land-use class “meadows 

and pastures”, especially latrines’ average diameter, which had the most significant correlation (for the 

areas: r=0.496, p=0.016; for the percentages: r=0.531, p=0.009). This strict relation between rabbit 

variables with meadows and pastures was more than expected, given that these are preferential feeding 

habitats for rabbits that support their herbaceous diet, composed mainly of grasses and leguminous 

plants, as well as cereal species. Those species present in meadows and pasturelands have the highest 

nutritive value, protein levels and reduced fibre content, being vital for triggering rabbits' reproduction 

and for juveniles' optimal growth (Fernandes dos Santos 2009; Ferreira 2003; Gonçalves 2015).  

On the other hand, the land-use class “montados dominated by brushwoods” was particularly 

correlated in a negative way with latrines’ average diameter (for the areas: r=-0.541, p=0.008) and 

pellets’ average number (for the percentages: r=-0.539, p=0.008). Although montados could be 

generally considered as suitable habitats for rabbits due to their interspersed mosaics of holm and cork 

oak woodlands mingled with pastures, forested areas, Mediterranean shrub and scrublands, and 

agricultural areas associated with low human presence and disturbance (Fernandes dos Santos 2009; 

LPN 2014; Pinto-Correia et al. 2011), the truth is that in this work they did not correlate in a positive 

way. This could be due to the fact that the landscape may still be relatively homogeneous due to a 

reduced presence of shrubs and herbaceous species (Mira et al. 2007), or perhaps because shrubs' cover 

within those montados may not be in the ideal growth state in which they can provide shelter for rabbits, 

therefore not being very suitable for them.  

As for the variables concerning human presence and occupation, rabbit variables were particularly 

correlated in a highly significant manner with the land-use class “infrastructures”, pellets’ average 

number being the one with the most significant relation (for the areas: r=0.652, p=0.001; for the 

percentages: r=0.616, p=0.002). This was quite an unexpected result, especially taking into account the 

general dimension of the designed buffers. Nevertheless, this result could be explained by the fact that 

infrastructures refer to structures and buildings associated with human presence, but that are not 

permanently inhabited and/or used, and in which there is most likely a residual human presence and 

disturbance; therefore, they may be used if needed as shelter and refugee spots by rabbits (Fernandez-

de-Simon et al. 2011; Gálvez-Bravo 2011; LPN 2014; Zim &amp;amp; Hoffmeister 1955). Similarly, the land-

use class “houses and orchards” was also significantly correlated with rabbit variables, pellets’ average 

number (for the areas: r=0.614, p=0.002; for the percentages: r=0.600, p=0.002) being once again the 



 

47 

 

one with the most significant relation. This could be because this land-use class generally refers to small 

rural houses possibly owned by farmers and/or landowners and usually located in the proximity of 

pasturelands, agricultural and horticultural lands and other opened regions, therefore being distant from 

large urban areas and probably associated with low human presence and disturbance (LPN 2014; Pinto-

Correia et al. 2011). Those factors associated to the presence of orchards, which could provide additional 

food resources to the rabbit, can explain this habitat' suitability for rabbits. Finally, the land-use class 

“ruins and abandoned wells” was significantly related to pellets’ average number (for the areas: r=0.442, 

p=0.035; for the percentages: r=0.419, p=0.047). This correlation is possibly due to the fact that this 

class regards human-related structures and buildings that are currently abandoned, thus not being 

affected by human presence or intervention. Moreover, such abandoned structures can be used as refugee 

or protection sites for the rabbit, not to mention that these abandoned buildings are usually associated 

with the presence of spontaneous vegetation, mainly herbaceous species that could complement the 

rabbit's diet. We should also highlight that abandoned wells are a very relevant sign of past agricultural 

areas, which provide a wide set of feeding resources for the rabbit (Fernandes dos Santos 2009; Ferreira 

2003).  

The most surprising result was that there were indeed no significant correlations at all between 

any of the plantations' land-use classes (Quercus and Pinus plantations dominated by pastures and 

dominated by brushwoods) with any of the wild rabbit variables. Although not statistically significant, 

there were positive correlations between plantations and the rabbit, which were higher regarding first of 

all Pinus plantations dominated by brushwoods, followed by Quercus plantations dominated by 

brushwoods and finally Pinus plantations dominated by pastures. Surprisingly, Quercus plantations 

dominated by pastures were inversely correlated to rabbit variables; however, correlations were not 

significant, therefore those results are not presented in this work. Although these correlations are not 

significant, we could still highlight the fact that Pinus pinea seems to have a more positive effect upon 

the rabbit's presence and abundance in the study area than Quercus ilex or Quercus suber, and that 

rabbits seem to have a greater preference for plantations that are dominated by brushwoods, which could 

indicate rabbit's preference in the first place for more suitable habitats in terms of shelter requisites 

(brushwoods with shrub cover) rather than more suitable habitats in terms of feeding requirements 

(pastures). Nevertheless, the fact that there were no significant correlations between plantations and 

rabbit variables indicates that, from a general overview, plantations seem to be indifferent to rabbits in 

terms of suitable habitats, or that, although plantations are actually the dominant land-use class within 

the set of sampling sites, they are perhaps still not extensive enough to interfere in the remaining 

landscape mosaic heterogeneity that is suitable enough for the rabbit's presence and abundance in the 

study area.  

To summarize, although the land-use cartography showed that there were some interesting 

significant correlations between wild rabbit variables and relevant habitat ones, such as meadows and 

pastures, montados dominated by brushwoods, houses and orchards, and finally ruins and abandoned 

wells that were in general expected and plausible, in the end the truth is that none of the wild rabbit 

variables exhibited a significant correlation with the plantations. With that said, certain data limitations 

associated with the results obtained in this work (no significant relations between rabbits’ abundance, 

reforestation, climate variables and the plantations) do indeed not allow us to demonstrate that the rabbit 

plays a key role as an indicator of the success of reforestations in southern Portuguese drylands.  

As for the main limitations related to this work, we should essentially highlight the heterogeneous 

detectability levels for rabbit latrines and pellets according to differential substrates (dirt tracks; 

plantation lines/interlines; pastures) in which rabbit latrines’ counts were carried out, associated with 

the observer’s minimal experience concerning wild rabbit latrines and pellets’ detection and concerning 

data treatment and analysis. Moreover, the reduced number of plantations that were sampled (related to 



 

48 

 

certain technical limitations and delays regarding the selection of the plantations, and to personal and 

health issues), coupled with the fact that the plantations’ ages are very homogeneous, and thus very 

recent (poorly developed shrubby substrate, which could explain a lower suitability for rabbits), as well 

as rabbit’s low densities in the Portuguese territory, possibly related to the known incidence of viral 

diseases in the Iberian Peninsula (though it was not possible to obtain data regarding rabbit diseases in 

this work), constitute relevant limitations within the context of the present work that influenced the 

results obtained. Further, the way in which the average number of droppings was calculated may have 

led to an overestimate of the results obtained.   

Although rabbits exhibit several conditions for constituting a good ecological indicator, given its 

vital role as a multifunctional keystone species within Mediterranean ecosystems (Delibes-Mateos et al. 

2010; Ferreira 2003; Gonçalves et al. 2012; LPN 2014), associated with their ecological plasticity and 

exceptional adaptation capacities as a result of a complex social structure, crepuscular habits, elevated 

fecundity, growth rates, early maturity and exquisite ability to escape (Ferreira 2003), the truth is that, 

in the Iberian Peninsula, they end up not being good indicators of the success of reforestations, given 

their current distribution and density situation in this region (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2010; Fernandez-de-

Simon et al. 2011; Gálvez-Bravo 2011; LPN 2014; Ward 2005). Wild rabbit populations have been 

suffering a massive decline over past decades mainly due to habitat loss and fragmentation, viral diseases 

with devastating effects among rabbit effectives, and human-induced mortality especially through 

hunting (Cabezas-Díaz et al. 2009; Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008; Gonçalves et al. 2014; ICNF 2005; 

Ward 2005). These factors are responsible for the wild rabbit’s current uneven distribution and 

extremely low and highly fragmented densities across Portugal and Spain (Cabezas-Díaz et al. 2009; 

Delibes-Mateos et al. 2010; Gonçalves &amp;amp; Santos-Reis 2014; ICNF 2005). Given the unstable and highly 

fragmented distribution and density of the wild rabbit within the Iberian Peninsula, the number of 

effectives in the population is so extremely low that they end up preventing the wild rabbit from being 

a good ecological indicator. Therefore, their fragile situation in the Portuguese territory determines that 

they are indeed not a good ecological indicator.  

As for future work perspectives, it is suggested that a wider number of reforestation sites should 

be sampled, to complement and reinforce wild rabbit presence signs’ data, and to strengthen the 

statistical viability of the results that were obtained. Also, to be taken into consideration and studied, we 

should point to potential signs of other animals present in the same regions as the wild rabbit (such as 

predators, or the wild boar), given that these may interfere in wild rabbits’ presence and abundance in 

such regions, or even contribute to explaining rabbits’ absence.  

To summarize, given the vital importance of rabbits as a keystone species in Mediterranean 

ecosystems and their potential as an ecological indicator, it is fundamental to adopt management tools 

and measures to ensure the recuperation of their populations, so that their fragile distribution and density 

situation can be reverted, allowing them to reacquire their potential as good ecological indicators in 

Portugal, as well as in the rest of their distribution range.

5. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 

In this work, the wild rabbit’s relative abundance was estimated within holm-oak, cork-oak and 

stone-pine plantations along an aridity gradient in the southern region of continental Portugal. The goal 

was to understand whether the wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus - Linnaeus, 1758) is a good indicator 

of the success of historical reforestations in southern Portuguese drylands.  

The wild rabbit exhibits several favourable conditions for being a good ecological indicator, given 

its vital role as a multifunctional keystone species within Mediterranean ecosystems, especially in the 

Iberian Peninsula. They have a multiplicity of relevant roles and impacts in the structure, quality and 

complexity of these Mediterranean habitats, as ecosystem engineers and landscape shapers, and are the 

main prey for a wide series of major Mediterranean predators.  

The wild rabbit’s relative abundance was estimated through latrine counts along foot-transects, 

using the total number of latrines to calculate the Kilometric Abundance Index (KAI) for each sampling 

site. The relation between rabbits’ relative abundance and environmental variables associated with the 

structure and complexity of reforestations was evaluated, to determine whether the wild rabbit performs 

relevant roles in reforestations’ ecosystems, thus having the potential to be a good indicator of the suc-

cess of Portuguese dryland reforestations. Furthermore, a spatial analysis of the diversity of land use 

and occupation around the set of sampling sites - through the design of buffers and land-use cartography 

- was carried out in order to determine how the composition and structure of the landscape influence the 

presence and abundance of the wild rabbit in the study area. The relation between the rabbit's relative 

abundance and habitat variables (areas and percentages of occupation of each land-use class) was also 

evaluated.  

The results obtained in this work suggest a lack of significant association between the wild rabbit's 

abundance, environmental variables associated with reforestations, and plantation areas. This being so, 

we can conclude that the wild rabbit is indeed not a good indicator of the success of reforestations in 

southern Portuguese drylands.  

The wild rabbit ends up not being a clear ecological indicator in the Iberian Peninsula, given its 

current uneven distribution and extremely low and highly fragmented densities across the Portuguese 

and Spanish territories. Rabbits’ current distribution and density in this region is the unfortunate result 

of a massive decline in rabbit populations over past decades mainly due to habitat loss and fragmenta-

tion, the emergence of viral diseases, and excessive pressure from hunting. In this fashion, the extremely 

low number of effectives in the population prevents rabbits from being good ecological indicators. 

Therefore, the wild rabbit’s fragile situation in continental Portugal determines that it is indeed not a 

good ecological indicator, which is unfortunately reinforced by the results obtained in this dissertation.   

Given the wild rabbit’s current fragile situation in the Iberian Peninsula and its status as a multi-

functional keystone species in Mediterranean ecosystems, measures for the management and recovery 

of rabbit populations should be taken, so that the species can regain a fundamental role as an ecological 

indicator in this zone and, hopefully, in other countries as well.

Table 3 - Representation of latrines’ average diameter classes and latrines’ size index per sampling site.       
Latrines’ average diameters were organized within the average diameter classes below; the numbers in each class represent the 
total number of latrines that belong to the respective diameter class. These values were then multiplicated by the highest limit 

value of the diameter class where they belong, and the resulting average of such values corresponds to the size index for latrines’ 
average diameters as presented below.

Table 4 - Representation of pellets’ average number classes and pellets’ quantity index per sampling site. Pellets’ 

estimated number within each latrine found were organized within the set of pellets’ average number classes below; the 

numbers presented in each class consist of the total number of latrines that belong to the respective average number class. 

These values were then multiplied by the highest limit value of the average number class where they belong, and the resulting 

average of such values corresponds to the quantity index for pellets’ estimated number, as presented below.
