ABSTRACT 

 

Brazil and other emerging markets will continue to present many investment opportunities in 

the coming years.  Finance professionals who manage the company’s capital budgeting 

processes will face challenges.  Specific characteristics of these projects as commodity-linked 

prices (e.g., the case of oil and gas and agricultural projects) and the customary uncertainties 

related to emerging markets are additional challenges. In this scenario, a more sophisticated 

capital budgeting framework, Real Options, offers a more robust theory to deal with 

uncertainty, managerial flexibility, and volatile outcomes imbedded in these opportunities.  

Real Options theory assumes that the managers’ involvement in the project generates value so 

they might capitalize on good outcomes or reduce losses by abandoning projects with bad 

results. 

The primary objective of this research was to apply Real Options valuation analysis for an 

investment project valuation and discuss the process and the results of such methodology.  

The case study retroactively analyzed an investment project in Colombia and compared the 

results under traditional NPV methodology and Real Options.  The valuation techniques were 

performed as if they had been applied at the time the project was approved and then compared 

with the project's actual performance.  The case study evaluated two types of real options: 

first, the effect of an option to cancel a contract that is assessed from the perspective of the 

client; and second, the option to abandon and defer from the perspective of the company that 

will perform the investment. 

Keywords: real options, capital budget projects, decision under uncertainty, NPV, option to 

cancel.

RESUMO 

Brasil e outros mercados emergentes continuarão a apresentar muitas oportunidades de 

investimento nos próximos anos. Profissionais financeiros que gerenciam os processos de 

orçamento de capital nas empresas terão grandes desafios a enfrentar. Características 

específicas destes projetos como preços ligados a commodities (por exemplo: petróleo e gás e 

projetos agrícolas) e as incertezas habituais relacionadas com os mercados emergentes são 

desafios adicionais. Neste cenário, ferramentas mais sofisticadas de orçamento de capital 

como Opções Reais, oferece uma teoria mais robusta para lidar com incerteza, flexibilidade 

gerencial, e os resultados voláteis embutidas nestas oportunidades. A teoria de Opções Reais 

assume que o envolvimento dos gestores nos projetos gera valor à medida que potencializam 

os bons resultados ou reduzem as perdas por abandonar projetos com maus resultados. 

O objetivo principal desta pesquisa foi aplicar a análise de Opções Reais para um projeto de 

investimento e discutir o processo e os resultados da metodologia. O estudo de caso analisa 

retroativamente um projeto de investimento na Colômbia e compara os resultados sob o 

tradicional VPL e Opções Reais. As técnicas de avaliação foram realizadas como se 

estivessem sendo aplicadas no momento em que o projeto foi aprovado, e depois comparadas 

com o desempenho real do projeto. O estudo de caso avaliado possui dois tipos de Opções 

Reais: primeiro, o efeito de uma opção para cancelar um contrato que é analisado a partir da 

perspectiva do cliente que pode exercer essa opção, e o segundo, a opção de abandonar e adiar 

a partir da perspectiva da empresa que irá executar a investimento. 

Palavras-chave: opções reais, projetos de orçamento de capital, decisão sob incerteza, VPL, 

opção de cancelar.

1  INTRODUCTION 

 

1.1 Context 

The decade that began in 2011 will present several investments opportunities in Brazil due 

huge infrastructure projects (e.g., oil exploration in the pre-salt region) and a demanding 

internal market boosted by the new middle class.  The giant national oil company (NOC) 

Petrobras announced aggressive investment plans (U.S. $213.5 billion from 2011 to 2015) 

that will position Brazil as the 5th largest oil producer in the world. Petrobras projects, as well 

as several other infrastructure projects spurred by the 2014 World Cup soccer championship, 

the 2016 Olympics Games, and the internal market boom, all of which will present several 

investment opportunities for local and international companies. 

These opportunities will require significant capital expenditure for several years.  This will be 

challenging for finance professionals who manage the company’s capital budgeting processes.  

The specific characteristics of commodity-linked prices (in the case of oil and gas and 

agricultural projects) and the traditional uncertainties about emerging markets add additional 

spice to the context.  In this scenario, a more sophisticated capital budget framework, Real 

Options, presents a more robust framework for dealing with the uncertainty, managerial 

flexibility, and volatile outcomes imbedded in those investment opportunities.  

The Real Options methodology represents a very comprehensive approach to evaluating those 

opportunities.  It not only values the options imbedded in the investment decisions 

compressively than the traditional Net Present Value (NPV) analysis does, but also improves 

the planning and formulation of those projects.  Unlike NPV, Real Options theory assumes 

that the managers’ involvement in the project generates value since they might capitalize on 

good outcomes or reduce loss by abandoning projects with bad results. 

According to Trigeorgis (1993), an options approach to capital budgeting has the potential to 

conceptualize and even quantify the value of options from active management.  This value 



11 

 

manifests as a collection of real (call or put) options embedded in capital investment 

opportunities that have as an underlying asset the gross project value of expected operating 

cash flows.  Many of these Real Options occur naturally (e.g., to defer, contract, shut down, or 

abandon), while others may be planned and built in at extra cost (e.g., to expand capacity or 

build growth options, to default when investment is staged sequentially, or to switch between 

alterative inputs or outputs).   

Managers have always been aware of Real Options, although perhaps not by this name. They 

always had the option to abandon a bad investment or stage the investment in a new plant 

according to demand growth, so those concepts are not new.  Experienced managers have 

always understood the “options” concept intuitively.  Still, a more systemic and structural 

approach to deal with those concepts in conjunction with the investment decision process adds 

value to the decision by quantifying it and providing a framework to analyze it.  Real Options 

decision analysis techniques provide managers with more intuition and information for 

solutions to valuation problems.  This is critical in an increasingly competitive business 

environment in which the ability to accurately assess project and asset values, including the 

incremental value related to a project's embedded options, will heavily influence difficult 

investment portfolio decisions (Hahn; Brandao; Dyer, 2010).   

 

1.2 Research Purpose 

The primary aim of this research study is to understand the practical use of Real Options 

valuation analysis and the tradeoff between the complexity (costs) of using it and the benefits 

of improving the analysis' explanatory power for decision-makers. The focus of the analysis 

was an investment opportunity in an oil and gas field services company in Latin America. The 

investment opportunity was examined using a case study methodology that retroactively 

analyzed the project and compared the project results under traditional methodologies (NPV) 

and Real Options. The valuation technique was performed as if it had been applied at the time 

the project was approved and subsequently compared with the project's actual performance. 

As a secondary objective, this study discusses the insights and options embedded in this 

investment opportunity.

2  MAIN CONCEPTS INVOLVED 
 

2.1 Description of Onshore Drilling Services 

A common Oil Field Services (OFS) company offers its drilling services for oil and gas 

operators that will manage the field after the wells are operational. The operators are typically 

NOCs (National Oil Companies) or private multinational companies that have the legal right 

to explore the field. OFS companies typically charge operators for rig services on a day rate 

basis at rates that are determined by the type of service and equipment required, market 

conditions in the region in which the rig operates, the ancillary equipment provided on the rig 

and the necessary personnel. The total revenues for the services are generated by multiplying 

the rate for the service by the time consumed in using it. The efficiency of the rig and the day 

rate are the most important drivers for rig profitability. 

A general drilling rig contract can require a full range of land-based drilling services, 

including: drilling initial wells, opening new production zones in existing wells, re-

completing wells in which production has declined, drilling out plugs, and converting 

producing wells to injection wells during enhanced recovery operations as well as mechanical 

repairs necessary to maintain or improve production from the well. 

2.2 Risks involved on the Drilling Services Operations 

There are several characteristics and risks associated with a drilling operation (from the OFS 

company perspective) that could substantially affect the cash flow of an operation that are not 

always incorporated in the capital budget decision for new investments. The main risks for a 

typical operation (contract) such as the one in the case study are: 

? Need to make significant upfront working capital commitments (labor and 

transportation costs) prior to receiving payments; 

? Some of the risk associated with the drilling operations, which are generally assumed 

by the operator of the well, including machinery breakdowns and abnormal drilling 

conditions. Accordingly, if severe drilling problems are encountered in drilling wells 

under such contracts, the client could suffer substantial losses, which may have an 

adverse effect on the OFS company. 

? The OFS company (the contractor) may be adversely affected if customers seek to 

cancel or renegotiate the drilling contract during periods of depressed market 

conditions or if the company experiences downtime or operational difficulties. During 



13 

 

depressed market conditions, a customer may no longer need a rig that is currently 

under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable rig at a lower day rate. 

? In a general contract, operators may have the right to terminate existing contracts if the 

company experiences downtime or operational problems above the contractual limit; 

certain contracts include terms allowing customers to terminate contracts without 

cause, with little or no prior notice and without penalty or early termination fees.  

? Historically, the industry has been highly cyclical, with periods of high demand, short 

rig supply and high day rates often followed by periods of low demand, excess rig 

supply and low day rates.  Periods of low demand and excess rig supply intensify the 

competition in the industry and often result in rigs being idle for long periods.  

? Social, political, labor and economic conditions in Latin America may cause volatility 

in the operations, manifesting as strikes, roads obstructions, shortage of equipment 

replacements (due to importation constrains), environmental permit delays, and 

foreign exchange controls. 

2.3 Drilling Market Dynamics 

The onshore drilling market has similar dynamics of the more sophisticated and lager offshore 

market, however it is more local and more affected by regional circumstances. As described 

in the Harvard Business School case the Offshore Drilling Indutry (Corts, 1999) the drilling 

industry is very cyclical and strongly correlated to the Oil Prices, for example: The second oil 

crises sent oil prices from under $ 10 to over $30 in 1979 boosting the exploration. Capacity 

utilization for rigs climbed to 100% and rental rates paid to contractors nearly doubled. As 

utilization soared, new rigs were ordered and built, with new contractors and private groups 

entering the industry. With newly completed rigs continuing to swell rig supply, utilization 

rates fell below 80% on 1983, and day rates fell more than half, despite persistence of oil 

prices in the high $20s. 

The similar dynamics affected the Colombian onshore drilling industry; however, as a local 

market other aspects also influenced the growth and declines of the market. In the 2000s 

Colombian government launched several efforts to build and developed its oil industry 

bringing significant amounts of foreign investments to its industry as it leased new promising 

exploration areas. These efforts also boosted the Oil field Service industry. The number of 

onshore drilling and workover (maintenance services rigs) rigs in the country grew from 80 

rigs in 1999 to 274 in 2012. The Colombian Market is considered a very competitive and open 



14 

 

market. In this environment of strong competition and abrupt responses to utilization as the 

market changes, the right to cancel rental contracts that the Oil Field Industry (contractors) 

award to the Operators could be very valuable to operators in the downturns and most of 

times neglected by the OFS industry. This case will further discuss and value such real option.

3  LITERATURE REVIEW 

3.1 Capital Budgeting 

Companies make capital investments to create and exploit profit opportunities that generate 

value for the organization when those projects are mature and well implemented.  The 

analysis, approval, and control of capital investment projects are the main purposes of a well-

defined capital budgeting process.  Investment proposals may emerge from different parts of 

the organization, so companies need procedures to ensure that every project is assessed 

consistently. When managers are presented with a black and white Excel spreadsheet 

containing a discounted cash flow analysis, they should not take it at face value.  Instead, they 

should ask for more “color” (contextualization) in the numbers and understand the context of 

the proposal, the strategic consideration of the project, what makes it “tick”, the options 

involved in it, and the possible pitfalls of its assumptions.  Once one understands those 

implications, one might want to reconfigure the project to improve its chances of success 

(Myers, Stewart et al., 2011).  In proper capital budgeting analysis, managers should look for 

ways to capitalize on success and reduce the cost of failure.  The company also should 

consider the value of the right to modify the project as the future unfolds.  This is the main 

pillar of Real Options theory as applied to capital budgeting.   

 

3.2 Financial Options  

A financial option is a derivative instrument that specifies a contract between two parties for a 

future transaction of an asset at a reference price (the strike price). The buyer of the option 

gains the right, but not the obligation, to engage in that transaction, while the seller incurs the 

corresponding obligation to fulfill the transaction. The price of an option is derived from the 

difference between the reference price and the value of the underlying asset (commonly a 

stock, a bond, currency or a futures contract) plus a premium based on the time remaining 

until the expiration of the option. An option that conveys the right to buy something at a 

specific price is referred as a call; an option that conveys the right to sell something at a 

specific price is called a put. If the option is not exercised by the expiration date, it becomes 

worthless. In return for assuming the obligation, or writing the option, the originator of the 

option collects a payment, the premium, from the buyer. The writer of an option must make 

good on delivering (or receiving) the underlying asset or its cash equivalent if the option is 

exercised. Its original buyer can usually sell the financial option to another party. Many 

options are created in standardized form and traded through an anonymous options exchange, 

while other over-the-counter options are customized to the desires of the buyer, usually by an 



16 

 

investment bank. The most common type of standardized financial options are: the European 

option—an option that may only be exercised on expiration; and the American option, an 

option that may be exercised on any trading day on or before expiration. 

A financial option is itself an asset that derives its value from (1) the underlying asset’s value, 

which can fluctuate dramatically prior to the date on which the opportunity to purchase or sell 

the underlying asset expires, and (2) the decisions made by the investor to exercise or hold the 

option. Option’s pricing methods have been developed to estimate option values from 

parameters characterizing the underlying asset’s value and investor behavior (Cobb; Charnes, 

2009). 

The payoff from a long position in a European call option is expressed as the following: 

VT = max[ST –X, 0], where T is the expiration date, X is the strike price, and ST is the final 

price of the underlying asset. The decision rule is that the option will be exercised if ST  X 

and not be exercised if ST&lt;X.  

The payoff to the holder of a long position in a European put option is expressed as the 

following: 

VT = max[X –ST, 0]. The decision rule is that the option will be exercised if ST   X and not to 

be exercised if ST &gt;X (Jiao, Y.-Y. et al., 2007). 

 

3.3 Origins and Building Blocks of Real Options 

The Real Options revolution arose in part as a response to the dissatisfaction experienced by 

corporate practitioners, strategists, and some academics with traditional capital budgeting 

techniques.  Well before the development of Real Options, corporate managers and strategists 

were grappling intuitively with the elusive elements of managerial operating flexibility and 

strategic interactions (Trigeorgis, 1993). 

Myers (1977) first coined the term “Real Options,” recognizing that particular growth 

opportunities could be addressed as call options and their value would depend on optional 

future investments.  Later, Ross (1978) discussed a valuation approach for Real Options.  

Trigeorgis (1993) organized and discussed the several Real Options categories according to 

their flexibilities.  Many of the Real Options theories were developed based on these seminal 

works.  Afterwards, several articles, such as Dixit &amp;amp; Pindyck (1995), began advocating the 

use of Real Options as a substitute for static NPV analysis and its pitfalls. 



17 

 

According to Trigeorgis' (1993) literature review and categorization, it is possible to analyze 

the application approach in two subgroups that are not mutually exclusive and differ from 

each other by the lenses used to read the situation and approach the problem, not necessarily 

by the framework applied.  According to Trigeorgis (1993), the most common Real Options 

generic applications are: 

? Option to defer: Management holds an agreement on (or an option to buy) valuable 

land or resources.  It can wait to see if output prices justify constructing a building or 

plant or developing a field.  This option is usually applicable in real estate 

development and commodities exploration (oil, farming, and mining); 

? Time to build option (staged investment): Staging investment as a series of outlays 

creates the option to abandon the enterprise midstream if new information is 

unfavorable.  Each stage can be viewed as an option of the value of subsequent stages 

and can be valued as a compound option.  This approach can be used in R&amp;amp;D 

intensive industries, especially pharmaceuticals; 

? Option to alter operating scale (e.g., to expand, contract, shut down, and restart): If 

market conditions are more favorable than expected, the line can expand the scale of 

production or accelerate resource utilization.  Conversely, if conditions are less 

favorable than expected, it can reduce the scale of operations.  In extreme cases, 

production may temporarily halt and start up again; 

? Option to abandon or Shut Down: If market conditions decline severely, management 

can abandon current operations and realize the resale value of capital equipment and 

other assets in secondhand markets; and 

? Growth options: An early investment (e.g., R&amp;amp;D, lease on undeveloped land or oil 

reserves, strategic acquisition, information network, and infrastructure) is a 

prerequisite or link in a chain of interrelated projects, opening up future growth 

opportunities (e.g., a new generation product or process, oil reserves, access to new 

markets, or strengthening of core capabilities). 

Copeland and Weston (1982) also discussed an important application especially for this study: 

the option to cancel a contract. This option is quite different from the traditional Real Option 

approach as it is an American put option that one presents to another party during a contract 



18 

 

negotiation. In the case of a financial lease with such an option, it is equivalent to a pure 

financial lease minus an American put option with a (non-stochastic) declining exercise price. 

The expected rate of return on a cancellable lease is shown to be higher than the rate on a pure 

financial lease in order to pay for such option. 

From a general environment, competition, and strategic viewpoint, Real Options has the 

potential to make a significant difference when applied to competition and strategy analyses.  

Sustainable competitive advantages resulting from patents, proprietary technologies, 

ownership of valuable natural resources, managerial capital, reputation or brand name, scale, 

and market power enable companies with valuable options to grow through future profitable 

investments and more effectively respond to unexpected adversity or opportunities in a 

changing technological, competitive, or general business environment.  The classical 

applications in this concept are: 

? Oil and gas and mining industries: Mining and oil companies have to decide when to 

develop the reservoirs they own and how much to bid for the right to develop 

additional properties or fields.  Such decisions often involve a combination of options 

such as the option to learn about the quantity of minerals present underground and the 

option to defer development until mineral or oil prices are favorable (Trigeorgis, 1993);  

? Cancelable Operating Lease: A manufacturer of jet engines, for example, would 

regularly purchase the plane for its client airline and lease it for commercial use, 

provided the airline agreed to install the manufacturer’s engines in the plane. 

Additionally, it was customary to give the airlines the right to cancel the lease and 

return the plane during a period prior to delivery and for up to a year after delivery. 

The costs involved in this option were immense and would fluctuate according to the 

client’s operation performance volatility. The right to cancel the lease was treated as 

an American put option that could be exercised by the airline when, during a downturn 

in passenger revenue miles, the value of the plane in operation became less than the 

value of the lease payments due (Copeland; Antikarov, 2005); 

? Flexible manufacturing: Flexible manufacturing systems, flexible production 

technologies, and other machinery having multiple uses can be analyzed from an 

options perspective.  It might value the flexibility, for example, of a dual-fuel 



19 

 

industrial steam boiler that can switch between alternative energies (natural gas and oil) 

as their relative prices fluctuate (Trigeorgis, 1993); 

? Land development industry: It can show that the value of vacant land should reflect 

not only its value based on its best immediate use (e.g., from constructing a building 

now), but also its option value if development is delayed and the land is converted for 

its best alternative use in the future.  It may thus be beneficial to hold land vacant for 

its option value even in currently thriving real estate markets (Trigeorgis, 1993); 

? Competition analysis: Smit and Ankum (1993) considered that an investment strategy 

encompasses a sequence of tactical investment projects, of which several may yield a 

low return when considered in isolation.  The net present value method has serious 

shortcomings for analyzing projects when future decisions are contingent on 

intermediate developments in an uncertain environment.  Option theory provides a 

better analytical tool to evaluate such projects. Postponement under perfect 

competition implies a loss in the expected value of the project due to anticipated 

competitive entry. (Boyer &amp;amp; Gravel, 2004). 

3.4 Main Differences between Real Options and Financial Options  

3.4.1 Terms and Parameters 

When financial options have a detailed contract, real options must be identified and specified. 

Although insights from the Real Options way of thinking are relevant across a number of 

industries, each application must be fit for the specifics of the particular industry as well as 

the market. Table 3.1 has a comparison between the two types of options.

3.4.2 Value Observation 

The underlying assets of Real Options are different from financial options in that they are 

rarely traded in quoted markets, which might create difficulties in establishing their fair prices. 

Moreover, the nonexistence of a historical price series of the underlying assets makes it 

difficult to calculate their historical volatility. In the context of financial options, one can 

clearly state a priori when a given option will be profitable and worth exercising. However, in 

the case of Real Options regarding strategic opportunities in which new possibilities are 

identified as a consequence of a firm’s actions, such a priori specification may not be possible. 

Experiments, even unsuccessful ones, not only provide information about intended investment 

paths but also provide information about other possibilities that may not even have been 

envisioned at the time of the initial investments (Adner; Levinthal, 2004). 



21 

 

 

3.4.3 Knowledge and Information 

Real Options gives the investing firm access to proprietary knowledge that a non-investing 

firm cannot obtain (or will take longer to obtain). In contrast, financial options do not provide 

access to “inside” knowledge about the investment opportunity; all investors have access to 

the same knowledge about the investment opportunity at the current and in the future. A real 

option can also provide privileged access to resources, hence restricting potential competitors. 

Financial options do not preclude others from making the same or similar investments. Real 

Options provides learning curve advantages that can be leveraged into a competitive 

advantage if the investment opportunity subsequently proves beneficial; something financial 

options do not provide (Brouthers; Brouthers; Werner, 2008). 

 

3.5 Real Option Quantitative Models and Valuation 

According to Trigeorgis (1993), the quantitative origins of Real Options derive from the 

seminal work of Black and Scholes and Merton in pricing financial options.  Cox, Ross, and 

Rubinstein's binomial approach enabled a simpler valuation of options in discrete time.  The 

actual valuation of options in practice has been greatly facilitated by Cox's and Ross's 

recognition that an option can be replicated (or a "synthetic option" created) from an 

equivalent portfolio of traded securities.  

Being independent of risk attitudes or capital market equilibrium considerations, such risk-

neutral valuation, enables present-value discounting at the risk-free interest rate of expected 

future payoffs (with actual probabilities replaced with risk-neutral ones), a fundamental 

characteristic of "arbitrage-free" price systems involving traded securities. 

The main quantitative model and theories that will be used in the research are: 

 

3.5.1 Black-Scholes Model 

The practical application of options to projects has been discussed by Luehrman (1998). He 

discussed the analogy between financial options and corporate investments, provided a 

framework for mapping the project onto the option framework, and reinforced that DCF 

techniques and Real Options are complements rather than substitutes to each other.  The 

capital investment decision is compared to a European call option that is valued using the 

Black-Scholes Model. To map a corporate investment onto a call option opportunity, he 

proposes: C = S0N(d1) – Xe
-rT 

N(d2), where (Varma, 2011): 

o C is the value of call option; 



22 

 

o S0 is the present value of a project’s operating assets to be acquired; 

o X is CAPEX required to acquire the project assets; 

o r is the risk-free rate of return; 

o T is the length of time the decision may be deferred; 

o ?
2
 is the riskiness of the project assets; 

o d1 = {ln(S0 /X) + (r + ?
2 

/2)*t}/ ( ? 2)*T 

o and d2 =  ? ?T - d1. 

The total value of the project will be the Adjusted Present Value, composed for: Traditional 

NPV + Value of Real Options. 

 

3.5.2 Binomial Lattice Model 

The binomial option pricing model has been presented by  Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979) 

as a simpler and more efficient numerical procedure for valuing options in which a premature 

exercise may be optimal. The basic idea was replicating the option payoff by constructing a 

portfolio out of a risk-free rate bond and the underlying stock (replicating portfolio). The 

unique feature of the binomial tree is that the outcome from moving up and then down is the 

same as the outcome of first moving down and then up. This sequence is repeated over time. 

The advantage of using a binomial lattice model over the Black-Scholes model is that it can 

be used to value American options. Consider, as in Trigeorgis (1993), valuing a generic 

investment opportunity as an example of the backward induction calculation used the Real 

Option valuation: 

? The opportunity to invest I0= $104 (in millions) in an oil project whose value in each 

period will either move up by 80% or down by 40%, depending on oil price 

fluctuations. The current oil price is $20, which represents a project gross value of 

$100 million. One year later, the project will have an expected value (from subsequent 

cash flows) of $180 if the oil price moves up (C
+
 = 180) or $60 if it moves down (C

-
 = 

60). There is an equal probability (q = 0.5) that the price of oil will move up or down 

in any year. 

? The extension of the binomial movements, up by 80% or down by 40% in this case, 

and risk-neutral probabilities could be estimated by several methods. They incorporate 

information about the uncertainty, or "volatility," of outcomes associated with the 

project. The most common method is to follow the convention used by  Cox, Ross, 

and Rubinstein (1979). The up and down movements at each step are u =e
???t

  and 



23 

 

d=1/u, where ? is the volatility of asset returns per time increment in the tree and ??t 

is the length of the time increment (Hahn; Brandao; Dyer, 2010). 

? Let S be the price of oil or generally of a "twin security" that is traded in the financial 

markets and has the same risk characteristics with the real project under consideration, 

for example a stock price of a similarly operating unlevered oil company. Both the 

project and its twin security (or oil prices) have an expected rate of return (or discount 

rate) of k = 20%, while the risk-free interest rate is 8%. 

? Consider the following binomial tree: 

 

 

 Figure 3.1 Binomial tree for investment opportunity example 

 Source: Trigeorgis (1993) 

 

? For example, the pair (V0, S0) above represents a current gross project value of $100 

million, and a spot oil price of $20 a barrel (or a $20 per share of the twin oil 

company).  

? Under traditional (passive) NPV analysis the current gross project value would be 

obtained first by discounting the project's end-of-period values (derived from 

subsequent cash flows), using the expected rate of return of the project's twin security 

(or, here, of oil prices) as the appropriate discount rate, i.e., V0 = (0.5 x 180 + 0.5 x 

60)/1.20 = 100. After subtracting the current investment costs I0= $104, the project's 

NPV is finally given as: NPV = V0- I0= -4 (&lt;0). 

? Because of the absence of managerial flexibility or real options, traditional DCF 

analysis would have rejected this project based on its negative NPV. The fundamental 

problem lies in the valuation of investment opportunities whose claims are not 

symmetric or proportional and whose discount rates vary in a complex way over time. 

Using contingent claims analysis (CCA) within a backward risk-neutral valuation 

process, the same solution can be obtained in our actual risk-averse world as in a "risk-

neutral" world in which the current value of any contingent claim could be obtained 

from its expected future values with expectations taken over the risk-neutral 

(100, 20)

probabilities p, inputted from the twin security's (or oil) prices discounted at a risk-free 

rate, r. In such a risk-neutral world, the current (beginning of the period) value of the 

project (or of the equity holders’ claims), E, is given by:    
             

   
 where 

p 
          

     
 , the probability, p, can be estimated from the price dynamics of the twin 

security (or of oil prices in the example):  
              

     
     . 

? Observe that the value for p = 0.4 is distinct from the actual probability, q = 0.5. This 

can be used to determine expected cash flows, which can be properly discounted at the 

risk-free rate. For example,    
             

   
    

                  

    
     

? This confirms the gross project value V0 = 100, calculated early using traditional DCF 

with the actual probability q = 0.5 and the risk-adjusted discount rate (K = 0.20). 

Although it achieved the same results, this approach is extremely practical to address 

more complex real option situations. The investment outlay (having a present value of 

$104 million) will not be spent immediately but in future installments. The amount 

that is not immediately spent should earn the riskless interest rate. This framework 

allows for the evaluation of upside-potential options, such as deferring or expanding; 

and downside-protection options, such as abandoning for salvage value or defaulting 

during construction.

3.6 Main Concepts Involved on Real Option Methodology 

3.6.1 Contingent Claims Analysis (CCA) 

This approach assumes the existence of a sufficiently rich set of markets in risky assets so that 

the stochastic component of the risky project under consideration can be exactly replicated. 

Through appropriate long and short positions, a riskless portfolio can be constructed 

consisting of the risky project and investment assets that track the project’s uncertainty. In 

equilibrium with no arbitrage opportunities, this portfolio must earn the risk-free rate of 

interest, which allows the value of the risky project to be determined. The no-arbitrage 

assumption avoids the necessity of determining the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate. 

However, if a portion of the return from holding the risky asset is due to an unobservable 

convenience yield, it is still necessary to estimate either that convenience yield or a market 

price of risk, which is often complicated (Insley; Wirjanto, 2010). 

 

3.6.2 Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)  

Geometric Brownian motion (also known as exponential Brownian motion) a continuous-time 

stochastic process in which the logarithm of the randomly varying quantity follows a 

Brownian motion, is an important example of stochastic processes satisfying a stochastic 

differential equation. In particular, it is used in mathematical finance to model stock prices in 

the Black–Scholes model. 

 

3.6.3 (MAD) Market Asset Disclaimer 

The Market Asset Disclaimer (MAD) approach developed by Copeland and Antikarov treats 

the project and real option as if they were actually traded. The best replicating asset for the 

option is assumed to be the project without flexibility, which is valued using the NPV method. 

The need to find an actual traded replicating portfolio is removed because Copeland and 

Antikarov reason that no “asset has a better correlation with the project, than the project itself.” 

The NPV approach does not value risks properly, so correctly pricing the project without 

flexibility (e.g., using the correct discount rate) is just as complex and important as valuing 

the flexibility (Edge, 2011). 

 

3.6.4 Binomial Lattice in Terms of cash Flow 

One very important approach used in this Real Option application, described by Brandão, 

Dyer and Hahn (2005), is to project the binomial lattice using the basic variable: the project 

cash flows instead of only the total project value of each node. 



27 

 

 To do this, the cash flow payout rate is used d = Ci / Vi to calculate the cash flows that are 

paid out at the end of each time period as a function of the project value. It is assumed that the 

cash flows will vary over time, reflecting the uncertainty of the project value, but that they 

will remain a constant fraction of the residual value of the project in each period. These cash 

flows(Ci,j) will therefore be a function of the project value and the stochastic process that 

drives the binomial model. The primary advantage of this approach is that it provides greater 

flexibility in the modeling of the real options of the project. To obtain the cash flows, the first 

step is to build the pre-cash flow payout values tree. These values are calculated according to 

the following equations, in which the superscripts u and d correspond to the up and down state 

values and the state subscript is suppressed: Vi
u 

= (Vi-1 – Vi-1di-1)u and Vi
d 
= (Vi-1 – Vi-1di-1)d.

4  RESEARCH METHOD 

4.1 Case Study Methodology 

There is a considerable amount of literature regarding Real Options and its applications to 

capital budgeting with solid methodologies developed on this theme.  Because there is a huge 

resource bank of case studies available in the current literature and I have access to internal 

operational and financial information, I favored a case study method.  This research used the 

current literature and application of Real Options methodology in a real case study to discuss 

the application and insights in a real-world situation. 

The corresponding research question is therefore: Which of the most common frameworks of 

Real Options better fits the evaluation of capital investments for the proposed case study? The 

best framework should improve the analysis’ explanatory power for decision makers and be a 

feasible application for finance professionals. 

The form of the research questions, the focus on understanding the dynamics presented within 

a single set of parameters, and the combination of data collection methods such as archives 

and observations will all contribute to the choice of case study as the research method, 

following the recommendations of  Eisenhardt, (2011). 

Furthermore, as a director of an oil and gas field services company responsible for the capital 

budgeting process and someone who has worked with capital budgeting for more than 10 

years, I have had the opportunity to obtain in-depth information that is probably not available 

to outside investigators. This unique perspective rendered the case revelatory. 

Initially, the current body of literature was reviewed (papers and surveys) to analyze the most 

common investment project valuation methods (NPV) analysis (Payback, Real Options, etc.) 

and their restrictions from the perspective of finance professionals. The aim was to understand 

the main difficulties faced in the application of the methodologies. 

In the second stage, data was collected, focusing on the raw data regarding the investment 

opportunities approval and historic performance of the projects. The information was gathered 

following the data collection plan outlined in Appendix A. 

Finally, one Real Options methodology was applied to the case study following a proper 

methodology.  Results were analyzed, and the following points were discussed: 

? Types of embedded Real Options that the project had; 



29 

 

? Methodologies used to assign risks to the projects; 

? Expected results (project valuation) versus actual results comparative analysis; 

4.2 Choosing the Right Framework for the Case Study 

After reviewing several Real Options methodologies and reproducing several of these case 

studies, the Real Options field appears very disperse among several streams, with no 

mainstream approach. Up to this point, the research was jeopardized due to the lack of 

practical and applicable framework to evaluate the proposed case study. The research needed 

focus, and a series of three articles helped to clarify the current situation of the field and the 

position I should take for this study. The three articles are a sequence of discussions on the 

future and applicability of the methodology: 

? Real Options Analysis: Where are the Emperor's Clothes? (Borison, 2005) 

? Real Options: Meeting the Georgetown Challenge (Copeland; Antikarov, 2005) 

? A Response to “Real Options: Meeting the Georgetown Challenge" (Borison, 2005) 

 

After analyzing the different positions set forth by the above articles, this research employed 

that of Copeland and Antikarov (2005).  Their article was a response to the Real Options 

symposium held on the campus of Georgetown University in 2003, during which a panel of 

knowledgeable academics and practitioners voiced concern about the need for both a 

consensus about methodology and easy-to-use software for Real Options. In the article, the 

authors attempted to provide the foundation for establishing a consensus on methodology. 

They also responded to criticism by Adam Borison (2005) of both the theory and current 

practice of Real Options.   They proposed the methodology described in Figure 4.1. based on 

the Binomial Lattice model. They discarded the use of the Black-Scholes model for the 

following reasons: 

? The Real Options approach assumes that the value of the project with flexibility 

should be equal to the NPV of the “base case” cash flows (the value of the project 

without flexibility) plus the (option) value of the management’s ability to respond to 

change. This is an especially important point because the cash outflows from a project 

are analogous to dividends paid on a stock; just as the price of a stock drops when it 

goes ex-dividend, cash outflows reduce the value of the project as they are paid 

(Copeland; Antikarov, 2005). The traditional Black-Scholes formula assumes that the 

underlying risky asset (the capital project) pays no dividends (has no cash flows) 



30 

 

during its life, which is not the case for most investment projects such as the one 

examined in this case study. 

? Most Real Options can be exercised at any time during the life of a project, such as the 

option to cancel the contract, which will be later discussed. Real Options requires an 

American option valuation technique.  Black-Scholes, however, is designed to value 

European options for which exercise takes place only at the expiration date.  

? Another limitation of Black-Scholes is that most Real Option projects involve 

compound options, as demonstrated in this case study. Black-Scholes is not well 

suited to valuing such options.  

? Projects can have negative NPVs, a possibility that cannot be accommodated by the 

Black-Scholes model, which is designed to work with financial options. Such options 

always have non-negative values. 

? Use math that everyone can understand. The Black-Scholes model is usually called a 

“black box,” which refers to a formula that, once the inputs are placed, the results are 

calculated and the process cannot be easily audited or variables cross-checked. As 

discussed by Copeland and Antikarov (2005), who knows whether the conclusions are 

right or wrong? How does one explain them to the top management of a company? 

How would you like to explain the difference between a Gauss-Wiener process, 

geometric Brownian motion, arithmetic Brownian motion or a jump process to a 

competent CFO?  

One of the important screenings in the selection of the methodology to be applied in the case 

study was my ability to be comfortable with the algebra involved. As an average practitioner 

of capital budget analysis, any method involving complex calculus, advanced statistics or 

stochastic calculus was disregarded as viable methodology.

5  CASE STUDY 

5.1 Company Description 

The company chosen for this study has invested more than $300 million in capital projects in 

the past five years among dozens of projects of several sizes and having various 

characteristics. It has operations in several countries in Latin and North America. Currently, 

the company has structured a formal capital budgeting process based on senior management 

discussions and DCF analysis supported by traditional metrics such as NPV, IRR, and 

Payback. The company in which the case study took place is referred as OFS and the 

investment project “Rig O.” To comply with the confidentiality of some information true 

parameter values were replaced by imagined ones. All the figures were multiplied by a randon 

number. However, the analysis and Real Option computation and conclusion remain valid. 

5.2 Investment Decision for Drilling Rig in Colombia 

OFS management analyzed and approved the drilling rig project in mid-2008. At the time of 

the investment approval, the Colombian operation of OFS was presenting very good results as 

shown in Figure 5.1 and the market was very bullish in Colombia. The CDS (credit default 

swap), a measure of investment risk in Colombia, was low, as shown in Figure 5.2, and oil 

prices were at an all-time high, Figure 5.3, guaranteeing comfortable returns for new drilling 

activity.

The investment proposal for the purchase of Rig O was a response to Client E’s strategy for 

the future development of its fields in Colombia. Client E was one of the largest global oil 

companies with a long presence in the region. The project intended to purchase a state-of-the-

art drilling rig, which would drill multilaterally
4
, in an initial 18-month pilot program. The 

project was expected to have a high success rate, and therefore commitment to this rig would 

be at least 5 years time. In this project the client was to pay for all fuel used in the operation 

reducing the project risk. Fuel costs amount for 20% of the total cost of a drilling operation.  

Table 5.1 illustrates the initial investment analysis.

 It is a new technology to create wells with multiple branches that can target widely spaced reservoir 

compartments provides engineers unlimited options in optimizing economic extraction of oil and gas.

5.3 Rig O Project Business Case Assumptions 

The 2008 original business case included operational assumptions very similar to the 

company’s average operations for the last twelve months (2007 and 2008). Although the 

historical data did not represent the exact rigs (the company did not have a rig as automatic 

and new as this one) it clearly represented a floor in terms of efficiency and margins (see 

Table 5.2). It also assumed that the rig would be contracted for the next ten years with the 

same operational assumptions. It is a very bold assumption considering that the industry is 

very cyclical and the client’s initial contract was only for a period of 18 months. The 

investment project consisted in a 26.4 million investment on the rig and import duties. In 2008, 

Colombia had a tax rebate that totaled almost 5.5 million for the purchase of such capital good 

item.

5.3.1 Business Case Standardization 

In order to make the investment analysis comparable, the original business case assumptions 

were translated into a standard monthly DCF model. It used the same WACC. Some 

assumptions were revised in the eyes of the timeframe in which the investment analysis was 

performed, correcting some gross simplifications and conceptual mistakes. In the case of Rig 

O investment analysis, the following adjustments and revisions were required:  

? The DCF analysis was previously only annual; it was adapted for a monthly 

projection. The monthly projection was used in order to facilitate the breakdown of 

the total project into several contracts that are not necessarily multiples of 12 months. 

The monthly projection also facilitates the identification of trends and impacts within 

the year. 

? The original model considered the depreciation as an annual charge even though it 

considered only a half-year of operations (revenues and costs). 

? The original model did not consider any working capital investments. Using the April 

2008 average Days of Sales Outstanding (DSO) and average Days of Payables 

Outstanding (DPO), the total working capital investment was almost $1 million. 

? Maintenance time and time lost within contracts: The original case considered the 

Rig working for almost 10 years without any contractual or maintenance stop. It did 

not consider any additional CAPEX in the following years for maintenance overhaul 

and technological updates. It was adjusted to reflect the following assumptions: 

o One month stop (without revenues) every beginning of new contract; 

o $200,000 maintenance CAPEX every beginning of new contract; 

o 24 months contracts after the initial contract; 

o $1 million CAPEX after 5 years for technological update. 



37 

 

? The salvage value for the Rig at the end of year ten in the original analysis was 

unrealistic: it was 87% of the initial investment. It was adjusted for a more realistic 

value, the liquidation value or forced sale value. The liquidation value was estimated 

based on the real useful life of the rig, 30 years, and that a forced sale would be 32% 

of the original investment plus any refurbishment and technological updates, 

depreciated in 30 years. The 32% value was calculated based on recent appraisal for 

the company assets. 

? For taxes purposes was used a 10 year depreciation for the rig. The depreciation 

reduces the net income from the project consequently reducing the amount of taxes 

paid.  

Table 5.3 contains the revised discounted cash flow analysis after the adjustments that was the 

base for the Real Option analysis.

 The same nominal prices and costs in US$ dollars assumption of the original business case was maintained. It 

assumes that the company will not pass to the tariffs the US$ inflation and will also keep its cost structure 

controlled in US$ terms.

5.3.2 OFS contract with client E: 

Most investment analyses and decisions are made before any contract or formal arrangement 

with the client is made. In the case of a large investment, it is recommended that the 

contractual terms be fully reflected in the investment analysis and consequently in the 

decision. This allows for avoidance of a very common trap, which results when the decision is 

approved under certain assumptions and the project is implemented under different and more 

relaxed assumptions. However, in most cases, it is not practical to negotiate the terms of both 

the contract and the investment decisions together and the investments are approved under 

assumptions that should reflect the future contractual structure and terms. Most of the 

contractual terms of a drilling rig contract in the industry are standard, taking it into 

consideration, the original investment decision should have reflected those clauses. However, 

this was not the case of the original investment decision: 

? The contract specified that the client could cancel the contract at any time, paying 

only the demobilization tariff estimated at $2.5 million. The contract clearly includes 

a put option for client E at no additional charge. The value of this option should be 

discounted from the NPV analysis for the decision-making. 

? Payment terms: The contract stipulates a 30-day payment after the client has certified 

all of the services. On average, it takes a total of 60 days to receive the services, 

which is a significant working capital investment that was not considered in the 

original analysis. The contract also stipulates that it may take longer if the client 

requests additional information and the company is delaying answering. 

? The contract also stipulates penalties from 5% to 20% of the regular tariff if the 

company does not comply with a long list of contractual requirements. 

The contract stipulated an 18-month contracted service with the option for the client 

to contract again under the same terms. In fact, this option does not have a lot of 

value for the analysis as the investment project already considers that the contract 

will be renewed for 10 years with similar terms which is not appropriate.  

5.4 Real Option analysis for Rig O Project – Indentifying the Uncertainties  

To apply the methodology of Real Options to evaluate the project for Rig O, a combination of 

the five-step process proposed by COPELAND, T. E.; ANTIKAROV (2005) and the 

adjustment used by BRANDÃO et al. (2005) was implemented.  Different from the 

COPELAND, T. E.; ANTIKAROV (2005) approach, this method uses most of the binomial 



39 

 

lattice methodology in terms of cash flow already discounted by the risk-free rate. This 

approach facilitates results analyses and the modeling of the variables. 

 

5.4.1 Step1: Calculate NPV to estimate the market value for the project 

Step 1a: Our revised version of the original business case was the base DCF used to estimate 

the project value. To facilitate the analysis, the discounted cash flow was divided into 5 

contracts: One base contract for 18 months, according the investment proposal with Client E, 

and 4 contracts for 24 months each.  

Step 1b: Estimate the cost of capital. To facilitate the comparison with the original investment 

analysis the same nominal WACC was used, 10%. This figure was the company-estimated 

nominal WACC at the time of the investment. 

Step 1c: During the application of the methodology, separating the different “flows” was 

found to facilitate analysis and the binomial lattice approach, thus in the NPV analysis, they 

can be mixed together. I separated all flows related to investment or divesture decisions 

(CAPEX, salvage value, margin lost between contracts) from other flows related to the 

regular operation activity (direct margin and working capital from rigs operations).   

Step 1d: After separating the flows, each piece can be discounted by the same WACC and 

added together in the NPV. 

Table 5.4 Project O NPV Breakdown

5.4.2 Step 2: Analyze Uncertainties: Define the main uncertainties 

This was the most complex part of the analysis. In this step, it is necessary to decide what the 

most important uncertainties that affect the project value are and the options that are 

incorporated in the project. It is tricky because there is no single methodology that will 

produce the answers; only a deep understanding of the reality of the project, the complexity 

and dynamics of the industry will yield the answers. After defining these elements, it is 

necessary to go back to the methodology to determine whether it can be modeled to analyze 

the real impact (sensibility analysis) for the relevance of the variable and if it really should be 

incorporated in a day-to-day evaluation after a standard model has been developed. 

Rig O

PV Cash Flow s (operation) 29,480      

PV Investm ents (22,892)

PV Salvage Value 2,667        

NPV 9,255        



40 

 

In this case, the first step is to recognize that unlike the original investment analysis, the 

project is not a single series of cash flows from a single client. In fact, it is a combination of 

several sets of cash flows from various contracts, which may or may not come from a single 

client. Here we have to assume some distribution of the contracts in order to be able to model: 

The base contract is the first; it is an 18-month cash flow that has already been contracted 

with Client E and has most of the value drivers defined, lowering uncertainties. 

The second set of contracts are three 25-month contracts, including one month in the 

beginning of the contract for rig up (perform maintenance) without revenues, and  one 

additional 21-month contract; 

After the last contract, it was determined that three additional months were required to recover 

the working capital (receivables) and to sell the rig for the liquidation value, totaling a 114-

month projection plus 3 months to recovery the working capital equal to the revised NPV 

calculation.

Step 2a: Map the uncertainties 

After reframing the project, it was easier to define the main uncertainties involved in the 

contracts and the options involved. The main uncertainties involved can be divided into two 

main groups: 

OFS company Uncertainties or Technical Uncertainties:  

Rig Efficiency: Total days/hours worked and billed divided by the total days/hours contracted. 

A drilling rig such as the one described operates 24 hours per day 7 days per week and 

generates revenue according to the amount of hours or days it is ready to operate. A stable 

Months Capex 

Base Contract (Client E) 18                21.09              

New  contract 1 25 0.20                

New  contract 2 25 0.20                

New  contract 3 25 1.00                

New  contract 4 21 0.20                

Total 5 Contracts 114              22.7                

PV Cash Flow

Base Contract (Client E) 6.4                      

New  contract 1 7.6                      

New  contract 2 6.3                      

New  contract 3 5.2                      

New  contract 4 4.0                      

Total 5 Contracts 29.5                    



41 

 

operation generally requires high levels of efficiency, around 98%; however, a rig could have 

several operational problems such as personnel strikes, difficulties in moving the rig between 

wells, mechanical problems or even human errors in the drilling activity. This uncertainty 

affects the base contract as well the new contracts. 

Rig utilization: Rig utilization is a similar to the former variable, total days/hours worked and 

billed divided by the total days/hours available, but it also considers the impact of an idle rig 

between contracts. It is important as the project has only one contract guaranteed. After the 

first contract was finished, the OFS was back to the market and susceptive to the market 

forces to get a new contract. 

Tariff and Day Rate: Once the rig is engaged, this variable is mostly fixed as all tariffs are 

calculated according to the contract with little space for renegotiation. Except by the mix of 

different tariffs under which the rig may operate. However, as the contract is renewed or the 

rig is available for a new contract, it will have to take the new “market” tariff. The oil price 

has an important influence on OFS tariffs. However, as it encompasses a 10-year timeframe, 

abrupt price changes could be mean reverting, reducing this impact in the model. Other 

variables also affect the tariffs such as government stimulus for the industry, the complexity 

of the drilling services, the availability of competitors’ rigs in the region. For this analysis the 

day rate variable is used, formed by all revenues generated during the month (from several 

type of tariffs) divided by the total days it worked and billed. 

Costs and Day Cost: Differently from the tariffs that are mostly defined as the contract is 

signed, the operational costs involved in the operation are not; foreign exchange variations 

and demand shocks could significantly influence the costs and the overall profitability of the 

project. A very active drilling market affects the whole supply chain, increasing the price for 

trucks, cranes, specialized labor, maintenance services, as well as for OFS services. For this 

analysis the day cost variable is used, formed by all costs generated during the month (most 

tend to be variable regarding activity or days worked/billed) divided by the total days it 

worked and billed. 

Client / Operator Uncertainties or Market Uncertainties:  

Oil Price and Economic downturn: The OFS’s clients are the ones who bear the direct impact 

of drastic fluctuations in the oil prices or an economic downturn; they are the ones who will 

sell oil at a lower price and at a lower volume. The drilling service they contract is only a part 

of the initial investment they have to incur to be able to sell their products; it is only one part 

of a more complex value chain. The practical implication of these uncertainties for the OFS 

investment project is: 



42 

 

? If the oil price drops substantially with no expectation of recovery, the client’s project 

(in which the rig is being used) may not be viable any more (in light of the new 

expected price of oil).  In this case, the client could cancel the contract for a specified 

penalty (generally the demobilization costs). 

? In a downturn or in a lower oil price environment, the clients will be less willing to 

contract new rigs, depressing the tariffs and the utilization. 

Step 2b: Keep separate those uncertainties that evolve discretely  

According to Copeland and Antikarov (2005) there are three important things to keep in mind 

when modeling uncertainties: 

? It is possible to combine uncertainties provided they evolve more or less continuously 

over time and you capture the covariances among them as well as their autocorrelation 

over time. In the case we combined the efficiency, utilization with the day margin 

risks. 

? When a source of uncertainty is resolved all at once and therefore is discontinuous 

over time, it should be kept separate from uncertainties that evolve continuously. In 

the case we separated the risk of the client canceling the contract from the one related 

to the company efficiency and day margin.  

Using the previous division of uncertainties it becomes clear that part of the first group has a 

direct impact on the OFS cash flow as it may manage and mitigate most of the risks. They are 

directly involved in the cash flow projections, for instance: the total revenue will depend on 

the day rate and the efficiency, and the EBITDA and the working capital will depend on them 

and the day cost.  

The impact of the second group on OFS will depend on the economics of the operator project 

as the total investment it will require, expected lifting cost (cost to extract the oil after the well 

is complete), type of oil it will produce and the price it is expected to sell. The impact on the 

OFS cash flow will only be applicable if the operators cancel the contract or if they hire the 

OFS for a new contract with a lower tariff. 

The Real Option analysis model treats the two cases separately as the underlying risks’ 

volatilities are different as well as the options involved for OFS. 

 

 

 



43 

 

Step 2c: Combine those risks that evolve continuously through time using Monte Carlo 

techniques 

In order to define the appropriate volatility for the options involved in the first group of 

uncertainties discussed above, the MAD approach discussed previously was used with a 

Monte Carlo simulation. 

Using this approach, I assumed that there was no perfectly correlated “twin security” for the 

investment in the drilling rig. I used the NPV as the most accurate estimate of the value of the 

project without flexibility, substituting for the value of the twin security. According to 

Copeland and Antikarov (2005), although this practice has been questioned, the assumption in 

the MAD approach is the same one that corporate executives routinely make when using the 

NPV of projects as estimates of the market price of projects. It is consistent with the practical 

approach used in this study. 

For modeling and conceptual proposes I combined two uncertainties, day rate and day cost, 

into one variable, day margin. As the dynamics of this variable are strongly correlated to each 

other since some costs increase as labor costs are passed to the tariffs (in some contracts) and 

the market dynamic of lower activity generating lower tariffs also reflects on lower 

operational costs of the whole market contracts, showing that this assumption is valid. 

To capture the effects of the uncertainties that were discussed on project risk, the day margin 

and utilization rate were used to drive the Monte Carlo simulation of changes in project value. 

Step 2d: Use either historical data or subjective forward-looking management estimates to 

drive the Monte Carlo Simulation
8
 

Using historical data and management estimates, considering the information available at the 

time. In the case of the investment project on Rig O, one might be tempted to identify the risk 

of the investment project with the volatility of the efficiency benchmark, 4.6% (Figure 5.5), or 

the day margin of a benchmark rig, 16% (Figure 5.6).  

                                                 
8
 As in most of the cases in with there is no complete and reliable information to take a decision, we utilized 

management estimates. These estimates are mostly based on past performance adjusted by the management 

expectations of the future. It generates an immense field biased decisions being behavioral economics the best 

approach to deal with them.

However, it is important to recognize that although efficiency and day margin uncertainties 

drive the risk of the project, it is not equivalent to that risk (as many Real Options applications 

seem to assume), and thus it is not a twin security. To incorporate these two risks into the 

Monte Carlo Simulation based on the original PV model, a combination of historical data and 

management estimates for both risks was used.

Efficiency uncertainty: 

As illustrated in Figure 5.5, efficiency may behave as a mean reverting variable. Using the 

procedure described by Copeland and Antokarov (2003), the formula for this variable should 

be: 

 Vt=Vt-?t +? (V - Vt-?t) +?dz , where: 

V is the average level in which the uncertainty fluctuates, in the case was used 94% as the 

original business case; the same assumption for the original case and a little lower than the 

benchmark in Figure 5.5. ? is the speed of the efficiency return to average after every 

deviation, in this case it was assumed 3 periods or 100% ÷3 = 33% according to management 

estimates and supported by Figure 5.5. The value of uncertainty in the previous period Vt-?t 

was already determined. The random variable for the Monte Carlo simulation will be dz, 

which is normally distributed with expected value zero and standard deviation of 1. The 

volatility for each period is constant, ?, defined by: 

    
            

       ? 
 

   

   

  

 
           

       ? 
 

   

   

  

  

Source: Copeland and Antokarov (2003) 

Applying the formula for a 24-month period, considering management estimates of lowest 

possible value with a 95% confidence rate in 24 months (period of contracts) is 40%; the 

value of ? is 20.0%.  With these parameters, we can incorporate the formula: 

 Vt=Vt-?t +? (V - Vt-?t) +?dz into the Monte Carlo simulation. 

Day Margin Uncertainty: 

Observing Figure 5.6, the day margin may also be a mean reverting variable during the 18-

month period and should also be in the long run to guarantee the profitability of the industry 

and the availability of the services. However, in the short period under a contracted tariff, the 

volatility should be significantly smaller. Using the procedure described by Copeland  and 

Antokarov (2003) , I performed the same analysis of the efficiency, but considering one range 

for the 18-month contract and another for the remaining 98 months. 

The average level around the uncertainty fluctuates; in the case it is 17.7, the same assumption 

of the original case and a little lower than the benchmark in Figure 5.6. ? is the speed the 

efficiency return to average after every deviation, in this case it was assumed that 2 periods or 

100% ÷2 = 50% according to management estimates and supported by Figure 5.6 for the 18-

month period and 12 periods or 100% ÷12 = 8.3% for the remaining 98 months.  Applying the 

volatility formula for the 18-month period considering management estimanates of lowest 



46 

 

possible value with a 95% confidence in 18 months (period of the base contract) is $10,000; 

the value of ? is 3.37 or 18.9%. Using the same volatility formula for the 98-month period 

considering management estimates of the lowest possible value with a 95% confidence in 98 

months (period of the base contract) is negative 10.0; the value of ? is 5.5 or 31.2%.  

In order to check the modeling of the uncertainties in the Monte Carlos simulation I 

performed the Monte Carlo simulation for the two variables to check whether they are 

converging to the expected mean (that showed be very close from the ones in the PV analysis).

Step 2e: Estimate the volatility of the return based on value 

This simulation in turn allows for estimation of the volatility of the rate of return on the 

project (which, as we shall show later on, is 24.3%)—a number that is different from the 

volatility of the efficiency (5.9%) and from the volatility of the day margin (29.2%), 

calculated directly from the Monte Carlo simulation. In fact, the project volatility is a 

combination of the volatilities from these two risks combined with the economics of the 

projected defined by the remaining assumptions. Even though the other assumptions were not 

randomly simulated in the Monte Carlo model, they can influence the project volatility. For 

instance, if the project had no working capital requirements the project volatility would be 

only 0.8% higher; on the other hand, if it had a monthly fixed cost of $100, regardless of 

reducing the PV of the project it would have increased the volatility of the project in 22.4%. 

 As much market information as possible was used in order to estimate the volatility of the 

rate of return on the project. In the absence of a traded twin security that represents the project 

(not merely the oil price), the proposed method assumed that the PV of the project without 

flexibility, as calculated using classical techniques, is the best estimate of the market price of 

a hypothetical twin security—one whose cash flows are perfectly correlated with the project

itself.  However, it is important to recognize that the inputs, even if subjective in some 

respects, are based on management estimates based on actual data of comparable projects. 

Perhaps even more important for managers is that the use of the MAD approach makes it far 

easier to perform the “reality check” of ensuring that the total project value is equal to the 

implied value of managerial flexibility plus the value of the project without flexibility. The 

search for a “twin security” in such a case, without a solid PV analysis and the understanding 

of the value of the underlying project it provides, is likely to turn the Real Options method 

into the “black box” that puts off practitioners (Copeland; Antikarov, 2005). 

The Monte Carlo simulation of the project return was accomplished by running 10,000 

random draws of the two risks, efficiency and day margins, as described before in the 

spreadsheet. The project return is defined by the formula: ln((PV1+FCF1)/PV0). In this case, 

PV1 is the present value of future cash flow generated by the operation without investments 

and salvage value (as described in Step 1d) in Year 1 discounted at WACC (from the Monte 

Carlo simulation). FCF1 is the nominal cash flow generated in the first month without any 

investment, rather than working capital, from the Monte Carlo simulation. PV0 is the cash 

flow generated by the operation at Year 0 from the standard PV analysis without the Monte 

Carlo simulation. 

In order to perform the Monte Carlo simulation efficiently, the add-in program for Excel 

developed by Barreto; Howland [s.d.]  was used. The program adds optional simulation 

commands and features to Microsoft Excel.  

The volatility of the project calculated by this methodology was 24.3%, Figure 5.8. A 

simulation of the NPV of the project was also performed, and it was close to the original NPV 

values, Figure 5.8, reinforcing the believe in the model integrity.

As mentioned in Step 2b, the uncertainties were separated. The volatility for the first group 

was already calculated by using the Monte Carlo simulation. For the second group, based on 

the operator’s economics, the risk of an economic downturn would make the operator’s 

project unfeasible, also requiring a volatility estimation. In this case, the OFS cash flow is the 

operator’s CAPEX and if the operator’s project becomes unfeasible because of a drop in oil 

prices, an analysis will be performed to determine if it is worth exercising its put option to 

cancel the contract and pay the contract penalty. 

This thesis does not intend to discuss the operators’ economics and rationale for exercising 

this option. On the other hand, it is a relevant option that the OFS gives away to the operators 

by the time the contract is signed and should be discounted in the original PV calculation of 

the project. To calculate this option we will use a simplified approach and consider as the 

volatility driver the oil prices’ standard deviation for a similar period, in this case the last 20 

months previous the project approval as we believe that this periods will captures the 

expected volatility going forward. 

Steps 3 to 5 will be applied twice: first for the second type of uncertainty related to the OFS 

client, the company that hired the OFS and can cancel the contract any time if it faces 

difficulties, and then for the sets of uncertainties related to OFS-related operations (efficiency 

and day margin).  This order is important because to model the former type of uncertainties it 

the project value is necessary, and the project value should be calculated after discounting the 

embedded put option that the OFS company gives to its clients. This is a cost that reduces the 

project value that will be the base to calculate the impact of the other uncertainties in the total 

project value. The annual risk free discount rate used in both cases was 3.4% in $ dollars 

equivalent to a 0.28% monthly rate.  

 

5.5 Real Option analysis for Rig O Project – Operator Perspective 

5.5.1 Step 3 Operator: Build Event Tree Based on the Binomial Lattice 

Step 3a: Construction of the underlying asset event tree: Estimate the volatility of the return 

based on value 

The underlying asset in the first case is the OFS client project value. The project value is 

composed by the expected net cash flow the client will receive from oil sales after the wells 

are drilled and operational.  This value should be net from the extracting and selling costs and 

discounted by the initial investment in drilling the wells. This initial investment, CAPEX, is 

the OFS expected cash flow from the contract. To calculate the operator’s project value it 

would require a lot of information from the project that the OFS company does not have. In 



49 

 

this thesis I proposed a simplification that is only possible because what we really want is not 

the operators project value; we want the impact of the operator project’s value variation on the 

OFS cash flow. It is known that the operator’s project value is strongly correlated to the oil 

prices, and that at the time the operators decide to contract the project they take into 

consideration the current oil price and the investment required to implement the project. It is 

assumed that if the project’s expected value substantially fell during the drilling phase due to 

a sharp drop in the expected oil price the operator will reevaluate if it should continue to 

invest or not. In the case that it stops investing it means that it will cancel the OFS contract 

and pay eventual penalties. 

It is assumed that at the time the operator contracts the OFS the expected project value is 100. 

Based on that and the estimated volatility of this project, the oil price standard variation, 

(24%), the binomial event tree for the first contract (18 months) is calculated in Table 5.7. 

The up and down movements at each step are u =e
???t

  and d=1/u, where ? is the volatility of 

asset returns, oil price, per time increment in the tree and ??t is the length of the time 

increment, in this case is one (Hahn; Brandao; Dyer, 2010).

What we are really interested in is the impact on the OFS project value; we also build the 

event tree for the first contract, which has an PV of  $6,437.

Monthly % of Cash Flow of Remaining Project Value  

 

 

Source: Author’s Calculation 

Unlike the operators project value lattice, which does not “pay divided” along the first 18 

months of investment, the OFS contract pays them and the up and down formula should 

applied to the present value of the project after the dividend payment. To get to the present 

value of the project after the dividend payment, we multiplied the current project value by 1- % 

of the monthly cash flow to the current value of the project. See section 3.6.5 for more details. 

Step 3b: Models dividends payment 

According to Brandão; Dyer; Hahn (2005), to simplify the binomial tree and allow for an 

easier understanding of the variables that are being modeled, we separate the dividend 

payments of the project; in this case the expected monthly cash flow from the project value. 

We also discount the dividend payment using the risk-free interest rate.

Step 3c: Ensure no arbitrage with underlying and risk-free bonds; event tree should reduce to 

PV 

At this point, we are still modeling the binomial tree without any flexibility. Using the same 

backward induction technique that will be used to determine a correct price for the option on 

the asset at time zero, we return to the PV of the OFS first contract by starting from the last 

branch (18,0) and (18,1) (Table 5.10) returning to (0,0) by using the appropriated risk-neutral 

probability as discussed in section 3.6.1. 

Table 5.10 OFS Project Valuation Binomial Tree for Base Contract Backward Induction 

 

 

Source: Author’s Calculation 

In Table 5.10, the last column, 18, is the same as Table 5.8, reflecting that in this kind of 

project, in month 18 the project value is the same as the expected cash flow in the 18
th

 month. 

This will be our starting point for the backward induction. The yellow cell (17,0) reflects the 

backward movement that will continue until cell (0,0). The yellow cell is: 25,584 x Risk 

Neutral Prob (up)+15,831 x Risk Neutral Prob (down) + the dividend paid in (17,0) (Table 

5.9), 19,791. Cell (0,0) is the final result; as expected, it is the same as the original project 

value from Table 5.8 reflecting the binomial tree without flexibility.  

 

5.5.2 Step 4 Operator: Create Decision Tree 

Step 4a: Understand the type of option being modeled: Modeling the value of operator put 

option to cancel the OFS contract. 

As discussed before, we assumed that the operator project value on T0 is 100. We also 

assumed that its value would change according the oil price volatility. The weakest 

assumption that will have to be considered in order to calculate the option value is that the 

operator project will be unfeasible if it reduces its value by 50%. When this happens, the 

operators will choose between continuing the contract and paying the remaining contract 

Risk Neutral Prob (up) 44.6%

Risk Neutral Prob (Down) 55.4%

value or canceling the contract and paying the contractual penalty; it will choose the lowest 

value and make its decision. Once the decision is made, it will generate a new binomial tree 

for the OFS company. The difference between the binomial tree without flexibility (Table 

5.10) and the one with the operator’s flexibility to cancel the contract (Table 5.12) will be the 

put option value that OFS gives to the client.

to be Paid to OFS 

 

Source: Author’s Calculation 

According the OFS contract with Client E, the penalty for early cancelation of the contract is 

the mobilization revenue, about  $2.5 million. Once the operator decision is modeled, we have 

to reflect this decision on the OFS project value to calculate the option value. 

Step 4b: Can have multiple decisions at one node 

Depending on the opportunities, the decision node could have multiple alternatives such as: 

? Operators would try to renegotiate the tariffs; or 

? Operators could simply cancel the contract and look for one of the several fine print 

clauses in the contract that gives it the right to postpone payment or apply fines to 

minor operational problems common in a contract like this. 

However, most of the alternatives would generate a similar impact for the OFS and would not 

justify a more complex modeling to account for them. 

5.5.3 Step 5 Operator: Estimate Value of RO 

Step 5a: Solution provides decisions as well as a value. 

Using the similar backward induction technique described previously, the project value with 

operators’ flexibility was calculated. However, instead of only using the backward induction 

with risk neutral probabilities, in the case that the operators “cancel” the project, OFS receives 

only the difference between the mobilization revenue and the mobilization cost to return the

rig to the base, about $1.1 million. This means that it will receive this value instead of the 

remaining cash flow that it would have received had the project continued.  The difference 

from the two projects is $0.53 million or 8% of the project value. This is the value of the 

option to cancel that OFS gives to the client and should be seen as a cost to be subtracted from 

the original contract PV. The value of this option is entirely owned by the operators as OFS 

gives it own its contract and its real value to the operator will depend on its own economics. 

In fact the value that was calculated is the OFS cost on giving this option to the operator.

Flexibility to Cancel the Contract.

A similar approach was taken to obtain the amount required to cancel the new contracts. The 

other four contracts are longer (24 months), generating an option to cancel, or cost to the OFS, 

valued at $1.2 million or 14% of the project value. 

More central than calculating the cost of the option was the understanding of the risk involved 

in the project caused by a contractual clause
9
. By agreeing to such a clause, OFS is more 

exposed to the market uncertainty (oil price). By understanding this dynamic, the company 

could be more prepared to negotiate with clients as such drastic events occur.

Now we are going to apply the methodology to the other uncertainties taking into 

consideration the original PV reducing the put option cost that was given to the client. 

Step 3a: Construction of the underlying asset event tree 

The underlying asset now is the combination of all contracts’ expected cash flows. The up and 

down movements at each step are u =e

  and d=1/u as before, where ? is the volatility of 

asset returns calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation.

 As described previously in section 2.2 and 5.3.2, the standard drilling contract between a Oil Field Company 

and an Operator contains clauses that allow the Operator to cancel the contract paying no or a lower penalty.

As it pays “divided” throughout the 117 months of the contract, the up and down formula 

should be applied to the present value of the project after the dividend payment. To ascertain 

the present value of the project after the dividend payment, we multiplied the current project 

value by the % of the month cash flow to the current value of the project. See section 3.6.4 for 

details. 

Step 3b: Models dividends payment 

According to Brandão; Dyer; Hahn (2005), to simplify the binomial tree and allow a easier 

understanding of the variables that are being modeled, we separate the dividend payment of 

the project; in this case the expected monthly cash flow from the project value. We also 

discount the dividend payment using the risk-free interest rate (Table 5.14). 

Step 3c: Ensure no arbitrage with underlying and risk-free bond; event tree should reduce to 

PV 

At this point, we are still modeling the binomial tree without any flexibility. Using the same 

backward induction technique that will be used to determine a correct price for the option on 

the asset at time zero, we return to the PV of the OFS PV of cash flow by starting from the 

last branch (117,0) and (117,1) of Table 5.13 and returning to (0,0) by using the appropriated 

risk-neutral probability as discussed on section 3.5.2.  

In Table 5.15, the last column, 117, is the same as in Table 5.14, reflecting that in this kind of 

project in Month 117 the project value is the same as the expected cash flow in the 117
th

 

month, which will be our starting point for the backward induction.

The decision tree was modeled as several European options that OFS has at the end of each 

contract. At the end of the contract with Client E, after Contracts I and II the OFS has the 

option to enter into a new contract with the same or a new client, and either wait until the 

market improves or sell the rig for the current liquidation value. If the OFS decides to enter 

into a new contract, it has a small maintenance CAPEX to incur. After almost five years the 

OFS has an additional option of investing in addition of the maintenance CAPEX  $1 for 

updating the rig or accepting a reduction of 30% on the day margin and consequently the cash 

flow. At the end of Contract III if it did not choose to update it will have to continue with 

lower margins. After almost 10 years, if the O rig was not sold yet it will be sold for a 

liquidation value similar to the original business case. Using this approach, we are able to 

obtain the total project value during the period of the projections without the need to calculate 

any terminal value for cash flow projections. 

Step 4b: Can have multiple decisions at one node 

The fourth step adds the options to the event tree, transforming it into a decision tree like the 

one shown in Figure 5.9 This is the case of a compound option; there are as many decision 

trees as there are compound options. To calculate the value of each option, different binomial 

lattice trees were calculated: 

Flexibility to do not contract (A) at the end of each contract and wait for better margins; in 

this case it is not necessary to invest in maintaiance CAPEX; 

Flexibility to do not contract (A) + To be able to continue contracting with lower margins 

and without incurring the update CAPEX (B); 

A+B+ To sell the rig for liquidation value at the end of each contract (C). 

In addition to this binomial lattice, one lattice more was performed only with the option to sell 

for liquidation value. 

5.6.3 Step 5 OFS: Estimate Value of Real Option 

Step 5a: Solution provides decisions as well as a value 

Using the similar backward induction technique described before, first it was calculate the 

option to do not contract Table 5.16. This option should be exercised when the expected cash 

flow from the current client is lower than the required investment (maintenance CAPEX) 

added to the option to cancel that OFS awards its clients. As OFS has the option to offer 

service latter if the market improves it is also necessary to model this contract separately.

Note that at this point it was incorporated the following variables in the binomial lattice: 

? At the last nodes, column 117 considers the dividend paid on 117 month (cash flow 

generated by the operation) and the proceeds from the sale of the rig for liquidation 

valued estimated on 4.8 million at month 117; 

? In the white cells, consideration of the regular backward induction mechanism is 

illustrated: e.g., (116,0) = (117,0) x Risk Neutral Prob (up) + (117,1) x Risk Neutral 

Prob (down) + the dividend paid in Table 5.14 (116,0); 

In the green cells, the months in which the European option can be exercised, the option was 

modeled as: 

? Month 94: the maximum between investing the required CAPEX, less the put option 

that OFS offered the client (option to cancel the contract) plus the backward induction 

representing the value of future cash flows (enter in a new contract), and doing 

nothing and selling for liquidation value the rig in Month 117. Note that by entering 

into a new contract the backward induction in the last nodes guarantee that it will also 

receive the liquidation value of the rig. 

? Month 69: the maximum between investing the required CAPEX, less the put option 

that OFS offered the client (option to cancel the contract) plus the backward induction 

representing the value of future cash flows (enter in a new contract), and doing 

nothing during the following 24 months but having the option to enter into a new 

contract in Month 94. Note that the impact of being able to contract again is calculated 

by using the same formula of the previous choice but subtracting the value of the 

binomial tree from Table 5.20, which is the same binomial tree but without the new 

Contract IV cash flow. 

? Month 44: the maximum between investing the required CAPEX, less the put option 

that OFS offered the client (option to cancel the contract) plus the backward induction 

representing the value of future cash flows (enter in a new contract), and doing 

nothing during the next 24 months, but having the option to enter in a new contract in 

Month 69. Note that the impact of being able to contract again is calculated by using 

the same formula of the previous choice but subtracting the value of the binomial tree 

from Table 5.21 that is the same binomial tree but without new Contracts III and IV.   

? Month 19: the maximum between investing the required CAPEX, less the put option 

that OFS offered the client (option to cancel the contract) plus the backward induction 

representing the value of future cash flows (enter in a new contract), and doing 



61 

 

nothing during the next 24 months, but having the option to enter in a new contract in 

Month 44. Note that the impact of being able to contract again is calculated by using 

the same formula of the previous choice but subtracting the value of the binomial tree 

from Table 5.22 that is the same binomial tree but without new Contracts II, III and IV.   

The result was exhibited in Table 5.16, $30.3 million. Comparing this value with the value of 

the project without flexibility in Table 5.13 27.7 million. The value of the option of not 

entering into new contracts if the situation is not favorable is calculated to be $2.6 million. 

A this point a new variable was added to the option calculation: the option not to invest in 

updating the rig in Month 69. Table 5.17 shows the new binomial tree. The only differences 

from the tree in Table 5.16 is that in the Month 69 column in blue, the maximum formula 

should also contain the option to reduce the investment by $1 million with the value that 

comes from the backward induction representing the future cash flows from the subsequent 

contracts being reduced by 30%. Comparing this value with the value of the project with 

flexibility only to not enter into a new contract in Table 5.16, $30.3 million, the additional 

value of the option of reducing tariffs (reducing the day margin) but not to invest on updating 

the rig is calculated, resulting in an additional value of $0.4 million. 

Finally the most valuable option was incorporated, which, as we will see, is the option to sell 

the rig for its liquidation value at the end of each contract. The same formulas from the 

previously binomial lattice were used, but incorporating the value of the liquidation value as 

an additional option in the maximum formula, in the green or blue columns, at end of each 

contract. This value is compared with the previous project in Table 5.17: $30.7 million. The 

additional value of the option of selling the rig for liquidation value is calculated to be $1.2 

million. However, unlike the previous option that was built on the option of not entering into 

a new contract, this option and decision is independent from the others and has the potential to 

offset the flexibility added by the other option. In order to better understand its dynamics we 

implemented an additional binomial lattice only with the flexibility to sell the rig for 

liquidation value. As we can see on Table 5.19, it has the same value of the project with all of 

the other options. The option to sell Rig O for liquidation value is dominant over the other 

options. From a numerical perspective of this framework, all other options could be 

eliminated, but in the last one, the project would have the same numerical value. However, if 

you take into consideration the business perspective it is very different: the option of selling 

the rig could not be accessible for instance if it were pledged in a credit agreement or any 

other restriction appears. The liquidation value could also be misestimated or the market for 

this kind of rig could become less liquid. Another import aspect of having additional options 



62 

 

even though it does not represent any additional value for the project value is the fact that by 

having the option mapped, managers could be more aware of the project value drivers and act 

on the levers in order to maximize the project value throughout its life.

5.7 Real Option analysis Results 

As described in Figure 5.10, the project valuation with all real options is 8.7 million. This 

value is formed by: 

? All contracts expected cash flow totaling 29.5 million; 

? All CAPEX investments (22.9) million; 

? The salvage value of the end of the project (rig liquidation value) 2.7 million; 

The first components of the tree combined is the project traditional NPV without any 

flexibility and static, 9.3 million. 

 Including the real options: 

? Cost of the option to cancel the contract awarded to Client E, (0.5) million; 

? Cost of the option to cancel the new assumed contracts to be awarded to the new 

contracts expected to be signed (4.2) million; 

? The option to be able to not invest on maintenance and updating CAPEX and not 

enter in a new contract waiting for better tariffs (expected cash flow) to improve 

2.6 million; 

? Option to be able to work with lower tariffs in Month 69, before entering in 

contract 3 and not investing on updating the rig 0.5 million; 

? Option to sell the rig for liquidation value that has a marginal impact of 1.2 million 

considering the previous options; or 4.2 million considering it by itself.

Unlike several Real Options examples and case studies in which the Real Option analysis 

increases the project value compared to the NPV approach, this one reduces. By incorporating 

the cost of the put option that OFS puts forth for the client it reduces the value by giving 

flexibility to its clients it is a similar impacted described by Copeland and Weston, (1982) on 

their note on the evaluation of cancellable operating leases.  By incorporating some options 

brought by the OFS management, flexibility to act, it partially offset the project value 

reduction.  

 

5.8 Retrospective Analysis of Rig O Investment Project 

It would be easy to criticize the investment decision having the advantage of hindsight; 

however, this exercise tried to examine the decisions through the lens of that period. As 

previously discussed, the original business plan had serious flaws and was revised (Figure 

5.12). The Real Options analysis valuation had results similar to those of the original business 

case; with that in mind, the actual results are presented below. 

As it was a 10-year project valuation, and it has only been 4 years and 4 months since the 

project started, we have to consider the following assumptions: 

? 53 months of operation and 14 more months with the latest company projections for 

the rig O were considered actual results; 

? For the remaining months the same projection of the revised business case was used;  

? The same discount rate was considered;

So what went wrong? Why is the project generating lower margins than expected? The 

company and the market were very bullish on this project, thus up to the present moment, the 

project had not paid back and is worth almost half the value was expected. 

Tables 5.24 and 5.25 examine the monthly cash generation and compare it with the 

projections and the operation assumptions to identify the main problems:

Evaluating first the operational performance, it is clear that the problem was not performance: 

the actual utilization was higher than expected and the rig was mainly contracted by Client E. 

In fact, Client E sold its Colombian operation and the new owner continued contracting Rig O.

In terms of cash generation, the first year was close to the projection mainly because of lower 

working capital requirements. 2009 was a very turbulent year because of the world financial 

crisis, generating 70% less cash than planned, improving the results for 2010, 2011 and 2012.  

On aggregate, it is clear that there was a problem of lower tariffs than expected 3.1 million 

that was partially offset by higher efficiency.  The higher costs also affected the value of the 

project as described in Figure 5.13 but in a bullish market, OFS companies generally are able 

to pass it through tariffs. 

The biggest impact was that the market abruptly changed in the years after the investment was 

approved in mid 2008. 

The global financial crisis led to sharp decreases in oil prices (Figure 5.14), reducing the oil 

price by 47% from the period the project was approved to the beginning of operations. The 

financial crisis also decreased the drilling demand and that, combined with the high level of 

competition in Colombia, generated an oversupply of rigs, resulting in downward pricing 

pressure on OFS companies’ rates. 

Even though the client E shares were strongly impacted, at a 44% reduction from the peak 

(Figure 5.15), the client did not cancel the contract, but pressured OFS to reduce the tariffs.

As a whole, the OFS Colombian results degraded from the peak right after the investment was 

approved (Figure 5.16).  This supports the argument that the project’s unsuccessful results 

were due much more to external problems that a specific operational problem of the project 

execution.

In conclusion, the revised assumptions mostly aligned with historical results and actual results 

in terms of efficiency and utilization, as the rig was fully contracted for the period.  However, 

the unanticipated economic crisis severely affected its tariffs and the ability to pass cost 

increases thought the tariffs. The Real Option approach was not able to capture such changes 

in the assumptions in full, thus discounting the cost of option to cancel the contract partially 

reflected the impact of tariffs reduction.  The options not to enter into a new contract or to sell 

the rig for liquidation value are still open and should be exercised if the expected future cash 

flow further deteriorates.

6  CONCLUSION 

6.1 Challenges of the Real Option Methodology 

According to Block (2007), in the survey with 279 Fortune 1000 companies, only 14.3% used 

Real Options in the capital budget process in contrast with the majority using NPV analysis.  

Thus, despite being recommended by academics and experts, the practical application of Real 

Options in organizations is still meager.  According to Lander and Pinches (1998), the main 

barriers for wider adoption are (1) the types of models are not well known or understood by 

corporate managers; (2) the required modeling assumptions are often violated in a practical 

Real Options application; and (3) additional assumptions required limits the scope of 

applicability.  Several authors have also developed simplified approaches and methodologies 

to try to open the Real Options black box (Copeland; Tufano, 2004).  Recent literature, 

informed by several case studies in different areas, has helped bring together academics and 

practitioners to overcome these challenges.  

However, most companies are still far from the correct application of the traditional NPV 

methodology. As shown in the case study, important projects are still being approved without 

comprehensive discussions of their main assumptions. In the case analyzed, the company 

over-simplified some assumptions or economic dynamics that could be better modeled 

bringing more precise results. Before going further in the use of Real Options, the company 

should revise its internal decision-making process and ensure that the results are being 

calculated with all information available, not only the ones given to the financial analysts. 

The Real Option methodology will not solve the problems of poor assumption or 

overconfident estimates. However, it could better reflect the reality and the flexibility 

involved in the project: the flexibility of the company acting to solve problems, but at the 

same time the flexibility for its clients to cancel contracts. This was the situation in case study. 

By subtracting from the NPV the cost of the put option, it discounted the project value 

reflecting possible economic downturn as it actually happened.  

 

6.2 “The journey not the arrival matters.” – T. S. Eliot 

As discussed before in section 5.7, the project value with the revised NPV and the NPV added 

the Real Options had similar values. The option to sell for the liquidation value is dominant to 

the other two options, so why take the trouble of calculating the all the options? 

The answer lies on the understanding that the most important point of Real Option valuation 

is not the results, but how one arrives at them. Unlike a static NPV analysis in which after the 

project value is calculated and the project is approved or not, the Real Option valuation 



77 

 

requires and supports the monitoring of the project. By understanding how the options are 

created, management can make better decisions about the project after it was approved, 

exercising its option or not.  Even the projects that were not approved might be feasible if 

certain circumstances change. By performing the analysis, the option dynamics are mapped 

and its values drivers explored, helping to identify possible opportunities and threats for the 

project and allow management to act in time to increase the project value. 

As a finance professional, I answer yes to the research question. Real Options can be used in 

real-world organizations, not only in academia. The case study showed how valuable it can be 

especially to price contractual clauses that typically companies give to clients at no charge. 

However, there is still a long way to go in making the methodology more practical to use. The 

case study also showed that there was no single framework that fits all organizations’ needs or 

types of investment projects. The framework should be customized to calculate a specific 

option or investment project. It is still far from being a simple framework for all organizations.    

 

6.3 Future Studies 

Future studies could explore the following approaches of this theme: 

? Analyze the case through the lens of Behavioral Economics and the common biases of 

capital budgeting process as overconfidence of managers’ projection and hindsight; 

? Retroactively evaluate if one of the options (not to enter into the contract or sell for 

salvage value) should have been exercised; 

? Perform the same analysis for Rig G project, a similar project approved during the 

same time period
