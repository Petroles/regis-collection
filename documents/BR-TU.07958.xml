RESUMO 
 
A composição isotópica de mármores do Complexo São Caetano (CSC), 

municípios de Flores e Afogados da Ingazeira, Pernambuco, foi usada para se 

estimar a idade de deposição das seqüências carbonáticas originais (protolito dos 

mármores) e para se investigar mudanças na composição global da água do mar 

durante sua deposição. Após comparar-se a curva de variação secular de isótopos 

de C e Sr  para estas sucessões carbonáticas com curvas para seqüências de 

carbonatos sedimentares bem conhecidas a nível mundial, uma idade Meso-

Neoproterozóica (1,1-0,97 Ga) é proposta para a deposição dos carbonatos do  

CSC.  

Três diferentes estágios isotópicos (I, II, III) foram definidos e correlacionados 

com eventos globais que teriam afetado a composição da água do mar durante a 

transição Meso-Neoproterozóico (1,1-0,97Ga.). Um estagio inicial (I), com valores 

moderadamente altos de ?13C (~ +3,7‰PDB) que refletem um aumento no seqüestro 

e soterramento do carbono orgânico, associado a um extensivo crescimento crustal 

ocorrido no auge do ciclo orogênico Grenvilliano. O estagio isotópico II, apresenta 

valores mais variareis de ?13C, entre -2 e +3‰PDB, interpretados como devido ao 

aumento no aporte de CO2  rico em 12C associado a um evento de riftamento global 

há 1,05 Ga e ao seqüestro de  matéria orgânica rica em 12C através de subdução e 

formação de arcos magmáticos a nivel global há ~1,0 Ga respectivamente. O estagio 

isotópico III, com valores de ?13C em torno de +3,7‰PDB, evidencia uma continua 

sedimentação e concomitante soterramento da matéria orgânica, associada `a 

aglutinação do supercontinente Rodinia.  A quimioestratigrafía de isótopos de Sr, 

com valores de 87Sr86Sr ~0,706 caracterizando o estagio isotópico I, valores um 

pouco mais variáveis (de 0.706 a 0,707) no estágio isotópico II, e valores em torno 

de 0,706 caracterizando o estágio isotópico III, apóiam estas idéias.    

Baseados no intervalo de idade de deposição aqui proposto e em relações 

geológicas regionais, é possível propor-se que os protólitos sedimentares dos 

mármores do CSC ter-se-iam depositado após um evento de riftamento na Zona 



 8

Transversal da Província Borborema entre 1.4 e 1.05 Ga. Características litológicas 

da parte siliciclástica do CSC indicam, por outro lado, que este ter-se-ia depositado 

numa margem continental em ambientes pelágicos. A margem continental, onde 

foram depositados os sedimentos do CSC foi estabelecida ao norte do Craton São 

Francisco e suas supracrustais Meso-Paleoproterozóicas associadas. A 

sedimentação do CSC foi interrompida pela convergência oceânica-continental 

(subdução) que levou a formação de arco magmático Cariris Velhos.  Comparações 

das curvas isotópicas de variação secular do CSC com as propostas em seqüências 

sedimentares bem preservadas, indicam que os protolitos dos mármores estudados 

teriam-se depositado durante um período de subida do nível do mar.  

Por outro lado, levando-se em consideração que a composição isotópica de C 

e Sr de carbonatos pode ser alterada por processos pós-deposicionais (e.g 

diagênese e metamorfismo), possíveis alterações da assinatura isotópica original 

dos carbonatos (mármores) do SCC, foram investigadas por metodologia 

multivariada, incluindo: (1) caracterização petrográfica, (2) caracterização dos 

elementos (elementos maiores e menores), e (3) determinação da composição 

isotópica dos carbonatos e grafitas associados.  

Concluiu-se que a alteração da assinatura isotópica de C encontrada em 

algumas das amostras estudados esta associada à presença de grafita. Uma difusão 

entre CH4 rico em 12C (derivado da grafita) e os carbonatos é proposta como o 

mecanismo que afetou a composição isotópica dos carbonatos, causando 

diminuições em seus valores de ?13C em ambiente fechado durante o metamorfismo.  

Isto é apoiado pela pouca variação dos valores de ?18O e 87Sr/86Sr; como também 

pela natureza inalterada dos indicadores de elementos geoquímicos (conteúdos de 

Sr com media de 1500 ppm, razões de Mn/Sr de 0.006 até 0.140, e razões de Rb/Sr 

entre 0 e 0.005).  Este processo ocorreu sob condições de metamorfismo de baixa 

pressão e media temperatura, como é apoiado pela paragênese dos mármores 

(calcita, quartzo, tremolita, moscovita, diopsidio e granada), as quais indicam 

temperaturas na faixa de 500-7000C. O Intervalo de temperatura para o 

metamorfismo (514 e 750oC) calculado a partir o termômetro calcita-grafita apóia 

esta idéia.

ABSTRACT 
 

C-, O- and Sr-isotope composition from marbles successions of the São 

Caetano Complex (SCC), located near Flores and Afogados da Ingazeira towns, 

state of Pernambuco, were used to constrain the depositional age of the original 

carbonate sequences (marble precursors) and to contribute to the understanding of 

the possible factors affecting the global geochemistry of ocean water during their 

deposition. After contrasting C and Sr-isotope secular variation curves from the SCC 

marbles with those of well known carbonate sequences worldwide, a Meso-

Neoproterozoic age (1.1-0.97 Ga) is here proposed for the deposition of the original 

limestone sequences.  

Three different C-isotope stages (I, II, III) were determined based on the C-

isotope secular variation pathways, and correlated with major global events, which 

would have affected the C-isotope composition of the Meso-Neoproterozoic seawater 

(1.1-0.97 Ga.). An initial stage (C-Isotope stage I), shows moderately high ?13C 

values (~+3.7‰PDB) which would have resulted from an increasing sequestration of 

organic carbon by enhanced burial associated to the large continental growth 

occurring during the onset of the Grenville  orogenic cycle. The C-Isotope stage II, 

has ?13C values displaying stronger oscillations (from -2‰ to +3‰PDB ). The negative 

values may reflect the enhanced mid-oceanic volcanism and the 12C-rich CO2 

release into the ocean during a global rifting event occurring at 1.05 Ga. The positive 

values reflect the 12C-rich organic carbon sequestration  through subduction, which 

would have been associated to widespread continental arc formation at ~1.0 Ga.  

The C-isotope stage III, which displays ?13C values around 3.7‰PDB, would have 

reflected a continued sedimentary organic burial associated to the agglutination of 

Rodinia Supercontinent.  

The Sr-isotope chemostratigraphy with constant 86Sr/87Sr values (~0.706) 

characterizing C-isotope stage I, slightly fluctuating values (from 0.706 to 0.707) 

characterizing C-isotope stage II and 87Sr/86Sr values averaging 0.706 characterizing 

C-isotope stage III, further support this idea.  



 10

Based on the depositional age determined for the studied marbles, it is 

proposed that their sedimentary precursor would have been deposited after a rifting 

event occurring in the Transversal Domain of the Borborema structural domain 

between 1.4-1.05 Ga. Lithological characteristics of the SCC silicilcastic successions 

indicate, on the other hand, that the SCC should have been deposited in a pelagic 

environment, along a continental margin. Comparisons between the ?13C values from 

the SCC and those from well-preserved sedimentary sequences indicate that the 

original limestone successions would have been deposited during a period of global 

sea level rise.  

Regional relationship with other lithologic units, on the other hand, allow to 

propose that such a continental margin would have been located north of the São 

Francisco craton and related Paleo and Mesoproterozoic supracrustal entities. 

Ocean closure related to ocean-continent plate convergence and subduction, the 

latter allowing the formation of a continental arc (Cariris Velhos) at 0.96 Ga, put end 

to the sedimentation of the SCC.     

Since the C-and Sr-isotope composition of carbonate sequences can suffer 

post-depositional alterations during diagenesis or modified by metamorphism, 

possible alterations of original isotope signature of SCC marbles were investigated 

by using a multivariable approach, which includes: (1) petrographic characterization, 

(2) elemental characterization (major and minor elements) and (3) determination of 

isotope composition of carbonates and graphite.  

Based on this multivariable approach, it was concluded that the post 

depositional alteration of original carbonate C-isotope signature of some samples 

presenting depleted ?13C values was associated to the presence of graphite and to 

the concomitant graphite derived 12C-rich CH4 - carbonate diffusion process. Such an 

isotope modification would have occurred under buffered conditions in which the 

action of external fluids was negligible.  This is supported by the only slightly variable 

?18O and 87Sr/86Sr values and the unaltered nature of the elemental indicators (Sr 

contents averaging 1500 ppm, Mn/Sr ratios from 0.006 to 0.140, and Rb/Sr ratios 

between 0 and 0.005). This process would have occurred during low pressure–

medium temperature conditions.  This is supported by the petrologic paragenesis 

(calcite, quartz tremolite, muscovite, diopside, garnet) that indicate temperatures 



 11

between 500 and 7000C and metamorphism temperatures from 514 to 750oC 

determined from C-isotope thermometry of coexisting calcite and graphite.

INTRODUÇÃO 
 

Desde o trabalho pioneiro de Harold Urey (1932) no qual a existência de dois 

isótopos de hidrogênio foi determinada por meios espectrométricos, o uso de 

isótopos estáveis tem ganhando uma ampla aceitação entre a comunidade cientifica. 

O continuo aprimoramento das técnicas analíticas neste ramo da geoquímica, 

conjugado ao desenvolvimento de novas aplicações das mesmas nas Ciências da 

Terra, tem permitido alcançar uma alta aplicabilidade e versatilidade na interpretação 

dos processos geológicos, climáticos, biológicos e até extraterrestres que teriam 

controlado a evolução do nosso planeta.  

Isótopos estáveis de O, C, H, S, Fe entre outros, tem sido os mais 

amplamente empregados em pesquisas geocientíficas. Uma das aplicações que 

mais tem revolucionado a pesquisa geológica é a quimioestratigrafía de isótopos 

estáveis de C e O, e ultimamente S, em seqüências carbonáticas, a qual é 

complementada com analises de isótopos de Sr (Kaufman et al., 1991, Sial et al., 

2000, Kah et al., 2001). Apesar de esta ser uma técnica que foi desenvolvida 

durante os anos setenta ( e.g. Veizer e Hoefs, 1976)  e aplicada na área de 

exploração do petróleo nos anos oitenta (e.g. Scholle e Arthur, 1980;  Mitchell et al., 

1996),  a implementação da quimioestratigrafía em a caracterização geoquímica de 

seqüências carbonáticas tanto sedimentares quanto metamórficas, alcançou seu 

maior desenvolvimento na primeira metade dos anos noventa (Veizer et al., 1989a,b, 

1990, 1992, Derry et al., 1992, Kaufman et al., 1991, Kaufman e Knoll, 1995, entre 

outros). Assim, esta aplicação tem ganhado grande quantidade de adeptos uma vez 

que permite a determinação de idades de deposição de seqüências carbonáticas 

com grande precisão, como também a caracterização geoquímica de ambientes 

sedimentares a partir dos quais seqüências carbonáticas se depositaram 

(geoquímica de oceanos, lagos, etc).  

A mais importante utilidade da quimioestratigrafía, no entanto, centra-se na 

possibilidade de  avaliar possíveis fatores que afetaram a geoquímica da água do 

mar através do tempo geológico, tanto global quanto regionalmente (Veizer et al., 

1989a,b; Jacobsen e Kaufman, 1999; Hayes et al., 1999; Sial et al, 2000; Lyndsay e 

Brasier, 2002; Bekker et al., 2003). ? desta perspectiva que a aplicabilidade da 



 14

quimioestratigrafía tem-se tornado ainda mais valiosa. Caracterizações multivariadas 

da composição isotópica de diferentes materiais (carbonatos, fosfatos, sulfetos, 

sulfatos, etc) têm permitido avaliar e diferenciar como os processos geológicos, 

climáticos e biológicos têm modificado de forma conjunta e/ou separada a 

geoquímica dos oceanos através do tempo (Des Marais, 1994; Lyndsay e Brasier, 

2002; Bekker et al., 2003, Bartley et al., 2001, Kah et al., 1999; Bartley e Kah, 2003, 

Frank et al., 2000, 2003; Hoffman et al., 1998 a, b; Hoffman, 1999, Halverson et al., 

2003). Alem disso, a quimioestratigrafía tem permitido avaliar mudanças nos ciclos 

biológicos e biogeoquímicos ao ser conjugada com outras linhas de pesquisa tais 

como paleontologia, sedimentología e estratigrafía de seqüências (Scholle e Arthur, 

1980;  Mitchell et al., 1996, Kah et al., 1999; Des Marais, 1997).   

Por outro lado, a quimioestratigrafía de isótopos estáveis tem permitido 

correlacionar seqüências de carbonatos sedimentares ou metamórficos de diferentes 

localidades com diferentes intervalos de idade, independentemente da história 

geológica sobreposta neles. Neste sentido a quimioestratigrafía de isótopos estáveis 

mostra maior versatilidade, já que determinações deste tipo em seqüências 

metamorfizadas apresentam dificuldades devido à falta de indicadores 

geocronológicos confiáveis. Desta forma, dificuldades anteriormente experimentadas 

na correlação de seqüências em diferentes ambientes geológicos é superada e 

reconstruções de eventos geológicos globais tornam-se ainda mais amplamente 

apoiadas (Melezhik et al., 1997, 1999, 2001, Knoll et al., 1995; Frank et al., 1997, 

Kah et al., 1999; Kah et al., 2001; Bartley et al., 2001; entre outros). Em estudos que 

envolvem seqüências carbonáticas precambrianas, onde faltam indicadores 

geocronológicos (fósseis) e uma grande diversidade de eventos pós-deposicionais 

são superpostos (metamorfismo e diagênese avançada), a aplicabilidade da 

quimioestratigrafía de isótopos de C, O e Sr é ainda mais útil já que permite avaliar 

condições paleoclimáticas, paleogeográficas, paleobiológicas e paleotectônicas 

independente dos eventos pós-deposicionais e o escasso registro sedimentar 

durante o período (Bartley et al., 2001, Kah et al., 1999, Hoffman et al., 1998ª,b; 

Hoffman, 1999, Bekker et al., 2003).  

Por outro lado, a aplicação de isótopos estáveis de carbono e oxigênio não 

tem sido restrita somente à realização de trabalhos quimioestratigráficos, mas 

tamben,  para avaliar processos pós-deposicionais que afetam o registro sedimentar 

e as características isotópicas originais destes (Veizer, 1893, Brand e Veizer, 



 15

1980a,b, Kaufman et al., 1991). Esta aplicabilidade tem dado uma ampla 

versatilidade a sua utilização na pesquisa geológica, ajudando não somente a 

melhorar a resolução das análises quimioestratigráficos, mas também a resolver 

outro tipo de questões na área das Geociências, como por exemplo, determinações 

de condições diagenéticas e metamórficas, tipo e grau de fluxo de fluidos durante 

estes processos, paleotermometría, determinação de variações na composição 

isotópica das águas subterrâneas entre outras (Kaufman et al., 1991; Melezhick et 

al., 2001; Valley, 2001; Evans et al., 2002).  

Com fins quimioestratigráficos, determinações de eventos pós-deposicionais 

ajudam a identificar os processos ocorridos durante os diferentes estágios de 

evolução de rochas carbonáticas. Vários trabalhos têm demonstrado que variações 

na composição isotópica dos carbonatos é favorecida durante diagênese e/ou 

metamorfismo por fatores como: (1) presença de minerais cuja composição inclui 

carbono ou favorece a formação de carbono durante esses eventos, (2) presença de 

fluidos intersticiais ou intercristalinos contendo uma assinatura isotópica diferente 

dos carbonatos e (3) magnitude da razão de interação rocha/água ou rocha/fluidos 

durante os eventos pós-deposicionais (Brand e Veizer, 1980a,b; Veizer, 1983; 

Banner e Hanson, 1990, Kaufman et al., 1991). Estas variações, geralmente 

acompanhadas por mudanças geoquímicas, permitem diferenciar processos 

afetando os carbonatos desde sua precipitação ate o metamorfismo inclusive (Shieh 

e Taylor 1969, Dunn e Valley,1992 , Kitchen e Valley, 1995, Valey 2001, Evans, 

2002). Estas conseqüentemente permitem também precisar e avaliar a 

confiabilidade dos registros ou assinaturas isotópicas com o objetivo de evitar 

determinações quimioestratigráficas errôneas.     

De especial interesse nesta dissertação é a utilização de técnicas 

quimioestratigráficas de isótopos de oxigênio, carbono e estrôncio na caracterização 

de seqüências carbonáticas que sofreram metamorfismo (mármores). Com esta 

finalidade, uma avaliação da confiabilidade desta técnica foi realizada baseada em 

análise das seqüências de mármores do Complexo São Caetano, na Zona 

Transversal da Província Borborema, nordeste Brasileiro.  

Sob esta perspectiva, se darão a conhecer os resultados da caracterização 

quimioestratigráfica de C, O e Sr dos mármores e se apresentaram algumas 

considerações acerca das condições geoquímicas da água do mar a partir da qual 

os protólitos destes se precipitaram. Adicionalmente, se propõe uma idade de 



 16

sedimentação para os protólitos dos mármores e faz-se algumas considerações 

acerca de possíveis causas que levaram a mudanças na composição isotótopica da 

água do mar durante a sedimentação. Alterações no registro geoquímico dos 

mármores serão avaliadas igualmente e as causas que afetaram as seqüências 

determinadas, com a finalidade de mostrar como processos metamórficos afetaram 

a assinatura isotópica original dos carbonatos. Finalmente, uma metodologia é 

proposta para o trabalho quimioestratigráfico em seqüências de mármores, a qual 

inclui análise petrográfica e de catoluminescencia dos mármores, análises isotópicas 

de carbono em calcita e grafita e analise de elementos maiores e menores em 

carbonatos.  

É importante ressaltar que esta versão impressa de dissertação de mestrado, 

devido à sua forma, seguindo as normas do programa de pós-graduação em 

Geociências da Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, não inclui capítulos como nas 

versões tradicionalmente submetidas, mas inclui os artigos nos quais são descritos 

os métodos e resultados das pesquisas realizadas nos mármores do Complexo São 

Caetano. O primeiro artigo, submetido aos Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciências 

(2004) trata sobre as características quimioestratigráficas dos mármores estudados 

e implicações regionais e globais deste registro. No segundo artigo, submetido a 

Chemical Geology, Elsevier (2004) uma avaliação das técnicas quimioestratigráficas 

em mármores é feita, incluindo análise de possíveis causas de alteração do registro 

isotópico e caracterizarão das condições sob as quais a alteração aconteceu.

ABSTRACT  
C-isotope and 87Sr/86Sr values for five carbonate successions from the São Caetano 

Complex, northeastern Brazil, were used to constrain their depositional age and to 

determine large variations in the C- and Sr- isotopic composition of seawater under 

the framework of global tectonic events. Three C-isotope stages were identified from 

base to top in a composed chemostratigraphic section: (1) stage in which ?13C values 

vary from +2 to +3.7‰PDB and average 3‰PDB, (2) stage with ?13C values displaying 

stronger oscillations (from -2‰ to +3‰PDB ), and (3) stage with an isotopic plateau 

with values around +3.7‰PDB. Constant 87Sr/86Sr values (~0.70600) characterize C-

isotope stage 1, whereas slightly fluctuating values (from 0.70600 to 0.70700) 

characterize C-isotope stage 2. Finally, 87Sr/86Sr values averaging 0.70600 

characterize C-isotope stage 3.  

The C- and Sr- chemostratigraphic pathways permit to state: (a) the C- and Sr-

isotope secular curves registered primary fluctuations of the isotope composition of 

seawater during late Mesoproterozoic - early Neoproterozoic transition in the 

Borborema Province, and (b) onset of the Cariris Velhos/Greenville cycle, 

widespread oceanic rifting, continental magmatic arc formation and onset of the 
agglutination of Rodinia supercontinent, mostly controlled the C- and Sr-isotope 

composition of seawater during the C-isotope stages 1, 2 and 3. 

1. INTRODUCTION 
Well-constrained C- and Sr-isotope chemostratigraphic data for Proterozoic 

limestone sequences have been used to detect changes in the geochemical 

composition of ancient seawater and their possible causes (Jacobsen and Kaufman 

1999, Bartley et al. 2001, Lindsay and Brasier 2002). Changes in the C- and Sr-

composition of the Proterozoic seawater result from the net interaction of several 

endogenic and exogenic mechanisms, among which tectonic activity, biologic 

radiations and amazing climatic changes are of remarkable importance (Melezhik et 

al. 1997, Brasier and Lindsay 1998, Hoffman and Schrag 2002, Bekker et al. 2003).  

The Mesoproterozoic - early Neoproterozoic chemostratigraphic record has 

been a topic of continuous discrepancies among geologists given that the lack of 

well-preserved stratigraphic sections has not permitted the achievement of a well-

constrained geochemical database. Few works (e.g Knoll et al. 1995, Hall and Veizer 

1996, Frank et al. 1997, 2003, Kah et al. 1999, 2001, Santos et al. 2000, Bartley et 

al. 2001, Azmy et al. 2001, Maheshwari et al. 2002, Bartley and Kah 2003) have 



 21

supplied reliable chemostratigraphic information for the construction of well-

constrained C- and Sr-isotope secular variation curves. Therefore, establishing 

factors that affected the seawater geochemistry during this time span has remained 

difficult. Based on the available data, it has been proposed that the early 

Mesoproterozoic C- and Sr- isotope composition of seawater remained in an 

apparent long-lasting steady state (Buick et al. 1995, Brasier and Lindsay 1998), 

while the middle-late Mesoproterozoic - early Neoproterozoic composition of 

seawater seems to have registered stronger perturbations in the geochemical cycles 

as a result of miscellaneous factors (Brasier and Lindsay 1998, Kah et al. 1999, 

Bartley et al. 2000, 2001, Bartley and Kah 2003, Frank et al. 1997, 2003).   

The São Caetano Complex (SCC) marble sequences, located in the 

Transversal Domain of the Borborema Structural Province (BSP), northeastern Brazil 

(Fig. 1), is a good candidate to unravel the above mentioned chemostratigraphic 

problems, although its sedimentation and metamorphism ages have been poorly 

constrained. This work aims at:  (1) indirectly constrain the depositional age of the 

SCC, by comparing its C and Sr-isotope chemostratigraphic curves with previously 

calibrated ones from other sequences worldwide,  (2) enhance the global C- and Sr- 

isotope stratigraphy database for the late Mesoproterozoic - early Neoproterozoic 

time span and (3) contribute to explain on how major tectonic events produced main 

C- and Sr- isotope perturbations in the ocean water geochemistry during this period 

of the Earth's history. Finally, since our isotopic database published in this work was 

obtained from marble sequences (amphibolite facies), it is also aimed to assess how 

metamorphism may have affected the original C- and Sr- isotope composition of SCC 

carbonate sequences.  

2. GEOLOGIC SETTING AND AGE 
The São Caetano Complex (SCC) is located in the Alto Pajeú Terrane (APT), 

Transversal Domain of the Borborema structural province (BSP), northeastern Brazil 

(Fig. 1). It is a metavolcano-sedimentary sequence characterized by garnet-biotite 

paragneiss, quartzite, marble, metapelite, metagraywacke, metadacite, metarhyolite, 

and metabasalt, metamorphosed in the amphibolite-facies during late Neoproterozoic 

(0.75-0.5 Ga.; Brito Neves et al. 2000).  

FIGURE 1 
This complex is associated to metavolcanic sequences and MORB mafic-

ultramafic suites (e.g Riacho-Gravata belt and Serrote das Pedras Pretas complex), 



 22

which are interpreted as part of a mid-oceanic rift sequence developed at ~1.05 Ga 

(Van Schmus et al. 1995), and intruded by early and middle Neoproterozoic plutons 

(Brito Neves et al. 2000 and references therein). The SCC is also associated to some 

marine Neoproterozoic metasedimentary sequences (Cachoeirinha Complex), but 

field relationships between them are not conclusive.  

No agreement on the stratigraphic position of the SCC has been reached thus 

far. The lack of high-resolution stratigraphic information has made its temporal 

characterization difficult, leading to several stratigraphic proposals. Despite the SCC 

has been strongly affected by regional shear zones and has been extensively 

intruded by Neoproterozoic plutonic suites during the Cariris Velhos cycle (0.96-0.95 

Ga; Kozuch unpublished results), and Pan-African/Brasiliano orogeny (Brito Neves et 

al. 2000), the marble successions studied here have thicknesses and extensions that 

can assure their regional character.  

The studied SCC marble successions are mainly calcitic and contain silicate 

mineral assemblages typical of amphibolite facies (diopside-tremolite-muscovite-

garnet). These marbles contain considerable amounts of graphite, which are 

disposed in layers and present different cyclic pathways (Fig. 2). They are 

interbedded with siliciclastic successions, and their thickness diminishes upward 

section. In spite of strong folding and shearing to which the SCC has undergone, the 

marble sequences seem to have preserved original stratigraphic polarity. This is 

corroborated by the presence of non-mimetic chemostratigraphic pathways as 

discussed below.          

FIGURE 2 
The age of the SCC is poorly constrained. The oldest age (&gt; 1.3 Ga.) ascribed 

to this complex was inferred from sedimentary zircons of Archean to Late 

Mesoproterozoic collected from siliciclastic successions in the uppermost portion of 

the SCC (Brito Neves et al. unpublished results). The youngest age for this complex 

was assumed from a 0.96 Ga (U-Pb) age determined for a granodioritic-biotite 

orthogneiss that intruded the siliciclastic successions overlying the studied marbles 

(Kozuch unpublished results).  

3. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
Marble samples were thin-sectioned in order to determine their petrographic 

characteristics and to evaluate whether silicate phases or graphite had some effect 

on the isotopic record. Determinations of minor and major elements were performed 



 23

using X-Ray fluorescence to support the petrographic analyses and to further 

evaluate post-depositional alterations. These analyses were performed in a Rigaku 

RIX 3000 XRF unit, equipped with a Rh tube, at the XRF laboratory, Department of 

Geology, Federal University of Pernambuco. Analyses of major and minor elements 

are reported in parts per million (ppm).  

For C- and O-isotope analyses, powdered carbonate samples were reacted 

with 100% orthophosphoric acid during 12 hours at 25oC. The CO2 released from this 

reaction was extracted in a high-vacuum extraction line by using cryogenic cleaning 

according to the method proposed by Craig (1957). The CO2 samples were analyzed 

for C and O- isotopes in a multi-collector double-inlet gas source mass spectrometer 

(Sira II), at the Stable Isotope Laboratory (LABISE), Department of Geology, Federal 

University of Pernambuco. The isotopic composition were contrasted against the in-

house standard Borborema Skarn Calcite (BSC), which calibrated against the NBS-

18, NBS-19 and NBS-20 standards, shows an isotopic composition of ?18O = -1.28 ± 

0.04‰PDB and  ?13C = -8.58 ± 0.02‰PDB. Results are reported in the international ?‰ 

(delta permil) notation respect to the PDB scale.  

For determination of the Sr-isotopic composition, 5 mg of powdered carbonate 

sample were dissolved in 0.5M ultraclean acetic acid for leaching, and centrifuged to 

obtain purified Sr. Rb and Sr were separated from the leached solutions by standard 

ion-exchange techniques. Following, 500 to 1000 ng of purified Sr were loaded onto 

Ta filament, along with 1µm H3PO4, for TIMS analysis, in a seven collector Mat 262 

instrument at the Geochronology Laboratory, Institute of Geosciences, University of 

Brasilia. 

4. CONSTRAINING POST-DEPOSITIONAL ISOTOPIC ALTERATION  
C- and Sr-isotope composition of marine carbonate materials has been 

successfully used to determine changes in the geochemistry of ancient oceans 

(Veizer and Hoefs 1976). Nevertheless, diagenesis and/or metamorphism have been 

considered as potential processes capable to cause post-depositional alteration of 

the original C- and Sr-isotope signatures. When submitted to either one of these 

processes, carbonates undergo textural, mineralogical and geochemical alterations, 

favored by (1) presence of C- and/or Sr- bearing minerals, (2) presence of 

intergranular or intercrystalline fluids, whose C- and Sr-isotope compositions differ 

from that of the carbonate, (3) abundance of primary elements into the carbonate 



 24

lattice, and (4) extent of the water-rock interaction during precipitation, deposition and 

post-depositional processes (Brand and Veizer 1980 a, b, Banner and Hanson 1990, 

Kaufman et al. 1991).  

The presence of silicate minerals and/or graphite has been considered as a 

potential factor capable of generating post-depositional change of the original C-

isotope signature of carbonates, leading to depletions of their ?13C values (Shieh and 

Taylor 1969). It has been also determined that the presence of silicate minerals affect 

the original ?18O and 87Sr/86Sr signatures as well (Chacko et al. 1991, Valley and 

O’Neil 1981, Valley 2001). Additionally, it has been established that paired depletions 

in ?18O and ?13C chemostratigraphic trends can be expected during post-depositional 

isotopic alteration.  

In order to determine post-depositional alteration and discriminate altered 

samples, which can yield erratic chemostratigraphic pathways, a petrographic 

characterization of the carbonates samples was performed. In general, studied 

marbles present coarse-grained calcite (0.8 to 4 mm).  Graphite contents vary 

between 0 and 8% and present a general coarsening up tendency (grain sizes from 

0.1 to 2 mm). It is either randomly disposed in layers or in disseminated form. Silicate 

phases (quartz, muscovite, tremolite, and diopside) are no representative (Fig. 3). No 

dissolution or exsolution textures were found, except when calcite crystals are in 

contact with graphite.  

FIGURE 3 
Given to the presence of graphite and silicate minerals in the SCC marbles, 

?18O, ?13C and 87Sr/86Sr data were cross-plotted and examined against some other 

geochemical tracers to determine possible post-depositional modifications (Fig. 4). 

Besides, the ?13C and ?18O secular variation curves were contrasted against the 

presence of graphite and silicate minerals (Fig. 5,6). No paired depletions were 

identified and no relationship was found between presence of silicate minerals and 

anomalously depleted isotopic values (Fig. 6). Depletions in the ?13C occur 

independently of the presence and variations in the percentage of silicate minerals 

and an opposite behavior was observed when comparing the ?13C curve with the 

graphite content one. In general depletions on the ?13C values accompany increases 

in graphite content and size, in sectors where the graphite occurs accumulated in 

layers (Fig. 5,6).  



 25

Other geochemical parameters were used to further investigate post-

depositional alterations, following methods proposed by Derry et al. (1992), Kaufman 

et al. (1991, 1993) and Kaufman and Knoll (1995) (Table 1, Fig. 4). Sr contents 

varying from 552 to 2487 ppm and averaging 1500 ppm, as well as Mn/Sr ratios 

varying from 0.006 to 0.140, and Rb/Sr ratios between 0 and 0.005, were found in 

the SCC marbles. These values perfectly meet the unaltered ratio ranges proposed 

by Bartley et al. (2001) for unaltered limestone sequences in Siberia, and are in close 

agreement with those lying in the field of unaltered samples (Sr contents &gt; 1000 

ppm) proposed by Brand and Veizer (1980a). Additionally, most of the obtained Sr 

values fall within the unaltered range (1100 and 1400 ppm) that  Kah et al. (1999, 

2001) proposed as representative of pristine seawater composition in Meso-

Neoproterozoic limestone sequences located in Canada.  

TABLE 1 
FIGURE 4 

In summary, the elemental composition of most of the analyzed SCC marble 

samples lies in the fields of unaltered rocks (Fig. 4). This indicates that the original 

composition of the limestone sequences has been preserved and effectively buffered 

during early diagenesis by ocean diagenetic fluids, preventing post-depositional 

alteration and allowing to low water-rock interaction (W-R) during diagenesis and 

metamorphism. However, few post-depositional modifications of the C-isotope record 

were found for samples with high graphite content. Carbonate samples with 

anomalously negative ?13C are thought to be a result of possible post-depositional 

alteration due to graphite derived CO2 /CH4  - calcite fractionation during diffusion. 

This processes, which have been reported by several authors (e.g. Dunn and Valley 

1992,  Kitchen and Valley 1995, Satish-Kumar et al. 2002), would have not effectively 

altered the whole marble sequence due to the low W-R interaction proposed above. 

Nonetheless, more analyses and evaluation are needed to further constrain this 

process.  

5. CHEMOSTRATIGRAPHY 
5.1 C-isotope chemostratigraphy 

About 120 samples from five continuous marble stratigraphic sections near 

Flores Town (Pedra de Cal, Santa Rosa, Rodiador, Malutagem localities) and near 

Sitio dos Nunes town, Pernambuco, were analyzed for C- and O- isotopes (Fig. 1).  



 26

The thicker and most complete stratigraphic section (Pedra de Cal locality) 

consists of 44 samples that correspond to nearly 110 m of continuous profile (Fig. 

5a). The sequence starts with a very oscillating ?13C pathway, which fluctuates 

between +2‰PDB and +3.6‰PDB and presents some depletion to values around 

1‰PDB. Upsection, those values remain almost constant, averaging +2.3‰PDB, then 

decrease to values as low as -2.2‰PDB and finally stabilize around -1.5 ‰PDB. Some 

positive shifts (of no more than 0.5‰PDB ) are also noticeable. A positive excursion, 

from 0 to +1.8‰PDB, characterizes the upper portion of the section just before falling 

to values around 0 and -1‰PDB in its uppermost portion. 

FIGURE 5 
The Malutagem (Fig. 5b) and Sitio dos Nunes sections (Fig. 5c) display 

predominantly negative ?13C values. Both sections start with oscillating values, in 

which shifts from -2.6‰PDB to ~+1‰PDB are identified. This pathway is interrupted by 

a very pronounced enrichment from -1.5 to +2.5‰PDB, which finally decreases to 

values near -2‰PDB upsection . 

The Santa Rosa (Fig. 5d) and Rodiador (Fig. 5e) sections display the most 

positive ?13C values in this study. Both sections start with negative ?13C values, -

1.8‰PDB and  -1.4‰PDB respectively, which then increase upsection reaching values 

as high as +3.7‰PDB. In the Rodiador section those positive values sporadically 

decrease to values near -1.8‰PDB, which were interpreted as the result of post-

depositional alteration; whereas in the Santa Rosa section, positive values 

(+2.7‰PDB) are preserved and no shift towards negative values has been recorded.  

Samples with possible post-depositional alteration were discarded (see 

previous section) and the ?13C chemostratigraphic pathways were used to correlate 

the stratigraphic sections and to construct a composite C-isotope variation curve (Fig. 

6). The correlation between stratigraphic sections was performed contrasting C-

isotope anomalies. Three C-isotope stages were identified: (a) C-isotope stage 1, 

mostly characterized by the presence of positive ?13C values (from +2.3 to 

+3.6‰PDB); (b) C-isotope stage 2, characterized by a very fluctuating ?13C pathway, 

which starts with a large negative excursion (from ~+2 to ~-2‰PDB), then increase to 

values ~+2.4‰PDB, to subsequently shift back to values near -2‰PDB and to finally 

increase towards values around 3‰PDB; and (c) C-isotope stage 3 that displays a 

noticeable and constant increase, from ~-2‰PDB to ~+3.7‰PDB.  



 27

FIGURE 6 
The composite chemostratigraphic trends are accompanied by changes in the 

chemical and mineralogical composition of carbonates. An increasing, upward 

tendency in the Mg/Ca ratio, accompanied by the presence of few silicate phases 

(predominantly quartz, muscovite and tremolite) and variable amounts of graphite, 

characterizes the C-isotope stage 1. On the other hand, low graphite contents and 

slightly higher amounts of silicate minerals (quartz and tremolite) characterize C-

isotope stage 2, in which a mimetic behavior between the Mg/Ca ratios and the C-

isotope values is observed. Finally, C-isotope stage 3 contains low amounts of 

graphite and silicate minerals and presents an increasing tendency in the Mg/Ca 

ratios, which is less pronounced in magnitude that those observed in C-isotope stage 

2 (Fig. 6).  

In summary, changes in C-isotope chemostratigraphic trends keep a co-

variation with Mg/Ca ratios and amount of graphite (Fig 6). As exposed above, shifts 

in the C-isotope composition of carbonates coincide with changes in the amount of 

graphite (Figs. 4, 5) and its distribution in outcrop (Fig. 2). Low amounts of graphite, 

disposed in layers, characterize the C-Isotope stage 1, whereas variable amounts of 

graphite, disposed in layers and some times disseminated, are commonly found 

associated to C-isotope stage 2. Finally, variable amounts of graphite, although less 

pronounced than those observed in C-isotope stage 2, are found in most of cases 

disposed in layers in the stratigraphic interval corresponding to the C-isotope stage 3. 

5.2 Sr- isotope stratigraphy 
A composite 87Sr/86Sr curve was constructed based on the well-constrained C-

Isotope composite chemostratigraphic curve (Fig. 6). 87Sr/86Sr values averaging 

0.706 where found in the lower portion of the sequence, characterizing the C-isotope 

stage 1. Values increase to ~0.707 and then fall again, up section, to values near 

0.706 in the stratigraphic interval corresponding to the C-isotope stage 2, to finally 

shift to values ~0.707. In the uppermost portion of the sequence and coinciding with 

the C-isotope stage 3, values decrease to ~0.706, remaining constant through the 

upper-most portion of the composite chemostratigraphic curve.

6. DISCUSSION 
6.1 Regional implications of the São Caetano Complex C and Sr isotope 
composition 

C- and Sr-isotope composition of carbonate sequences has been successfully 

used to correlate marine carbonate sequences worldwide and to indirectly constrain 

their depositional age (Kah et al. 1999, Bartley et al. 2001, among others). The 

effectiveness of this approach has not only been demonstrated for limestone 

sequences, but also on marble successions, in which the lack of fossils and other 

geochronologic indicators make age determinations rather difficult (Kaufman et al. 

1991).  

The ?13C secular variation pathways encountered in the SCC marbles seem to 

closely match with those encountered in Meso-Neoproterozoic carbonate sections in 

Canada and Siberia (Fig. 7) (Knoll et al. 1995, Kah et al. 1999, Bartley et al. 2001). 

For instance, carbonate sequences from Siberia (Bartley et al. 2001) and Canada 

(Kah et al. 1999) present mostly positive ?13C values (~+4‰PDB), which are 

interrupted by a large depletion towards negative values(-2.7‰PDB); the latter 

separated by a large positive excursion of near ~5‰PDB (from -2.4 to ~+2.4‰PDB) 

(Fig. 7). According to Bartley et al. (2001) such a positive excursion (-2.4 to 

+2.4‰PDB) marks the Meso-Neoproterozoic passage (~1 Ga). On the other hand, the 

age of the positive isotopic plateau (3-4‰PDB) preceding the above mentioned 

positive excursion was constrained based on a Pb-Pb isochron for carbonates from 

Siberia, which yield an age of 1.03 Ga (Ovchinnikova et al. 1995). Additional age 

data, based on isotopic analyses of glauconite-illite series minerals, provided an age 

of near 1.17 Ga for the stratigraphic levels presenting this isotopic plateau in the 

Kerpyl Group, Siberia (Bartley et al. 2001).  

FIGURE 7 
Bartley et al. (2001) reported 87Sr/86Sr data averaging 0.706 from some middle 

Riphean sucessions in Siberia (Turukhansk Uplift, Sukhaya Tunguska Formation) 

and values between 0.706 and 0.7065 from their late Riphean counterparts. These 

data supplemented the data obtained by Kah et al. (2001), who reported values 

between 0.7052 and 0.706 from Mesoproterozoic carbonates of the Bylot 

Supergroup in Canada, as well as from gypsum successions of the Society Cliffs 

Formation in Canada. Nevertheless, Gorokhov et al. (1995) reported increasing 



 29

87Sr/86Sr ratios, from 0.706 to 0.7065, obtained in middle-late Riphean (Meso-

Neoproterozoic transition) successions in Siberia.  

The 87Sr/86Sr values reported in the literature for the Mesoproterozoic –

Neoproterozoic transition are quite similar to those for the SCC marble sequences 

(Fig. 7). Although Bartley et al. (2001) proposed that 87Sr/86Sr values around 0.705 

characterize the middle-upper Riphean transition, values around 0.707 found for 

SCC marbles are quite similar to those reported by Gorokhov et al. (1995) for the 

same time span. However, similar values from the Turukhansk Uplift (Siberia) were 

considered by Bartley et al. (2001) as representing post-depositional alteration. 

On the basis of the similarities between the C- and Sr-isotope 

chemostraigraphic pathways encountered in the above-mentioned carbonate 

sequences and those herein reported from the SCC, a sedimentation spanning from 

1.1 to ~0.97 Ga is proposed. This suggests that oceanic conditions likely dominated 

part of the Transversal Domain of the Borborema Structural Province during the 

Meso-Neoproterozoic boundary and consequently, that the Transversal Domain 

remained as an open oceanic basin during that time span. This implies that the 

proposed landmasses collisional processes associated to the agglutination of 

Rodinia supercontinent (Brito Neves et al. 2000), would have not taken place before 

0.97 Ga in the Transversal Domain. The same conclusion has been recently reached 

by Kröner and Cordani (2003) who envisaged the possibility of a small and narrow 

oceanic basin in the Transversal Domain, during a period of continental expansion 

and rifting around 1.0 Ga.  

6.2 Global Implications of the late Mesoproterozoic - early Neoproterozoic C 
and Sr-Isotope record    

Since changes in the C- and Sr-isotope composition of seawater have been 

ascribed to miscellaneous processes, a brief discussion about the factors that can 

eventually affect such an isotopic composition will be addressed before discussing 

the late Meso- early Neoproterozoic record.   

Oscillatory ?13C pathways encountered in carbonate sequences worldwide 

have been attributed, in the long term, to periods of high tectonic activity during which 

inputs and outputs of the available Corg resulted in changes in the C-isotope 

composition of seawater respectively (Derry et al. 1992, Lindsay and Brasier 2002, 

Bekker et al. 2003). For instance, enriched ?13C values have been attributed to 

periods of high tectonic activity during which enhanced Corg burial causes high levels 



 30

of oxygenation levels in ocean and atmosphere, as well as high biologic 

diversification events (Des Marais 1997). These values are also expected during 

periods of high Corg sequestration during widespread subduction of Corg-rich 

sedimentary slabs and during widespread oceanic closure (Lindsay and Brasier 

2000, 2002, Bekker et al. 2003). Alternatively, it has also been proposed that short 

lasting phenomena such as upwelling, relative sea level changes, ocean water 

stratiphication, among other, can also generate fluctuating, environment dependant 

?13C pathways in the sedimentary record as observed in Phanerozoic sedimentary 

succession (Mitchell et al. 1996, Scholle and Arthur 1980). Oppositely, low ?13C 

values are associated to periods of stable tectonics, in which low Corg burial 

contribute to the oxidation and incorporation of the available crustal 12C-rich organic 

material being incorporated into the ocean system (Des Marais 1994, Kah et al. 

1999, Bartley et al. 2001). Depleted ?13C values can be also expected during periods 

of oceanic rifting and spreading, as well as during the occurrence of mantle 

superplumes, in which 13C-depleted volcanic CO2 is released into the ocean water 

(Lindsay and Brasier 2000, 2002). 

On the other hand, the Sr isotopic composition of seawater have been 

associated to diverse phenomena such as mid-oceanic rifting (outgassing), alteration 

of seafloor basalt and continental crust weathering and associated Sr isotope 

incorporation into the ocean via riverine discharge. Under this perspective, general 

agreement exists in that low 87Sr/86Sr values have been associated to mid oceanic 

volcanic activity (outgassing) and to alteration of seafloor basalt, whereas high 
87Sr/86Sr values have been associated mostly to continental weathering (Veizer et al. 

1997).  

The Mesoproterozoic seems to have been a crucial period of the evolution of 

Earth, during which strong and global tectonic events (e.g Grenville, agglutination of 

supercontinent Rodinia, widespread rifting) (Hoffman 1999), large Corg sequestration 

through burial and concomitant oceanic redox conditions (Des Marais et al. 1992, 

Canfield 1998), carbonate saturation of ocean water (Kah et al. 2001, Bartley and 

Kah 2003) and biochemical ecstasy (Knoll 1992) seem to have fashioned the C-

isotope composition of seawater.  

Some authors (e.g. Buick et al. 1995, Knoll et al. 1995, Brasier and Lindsay 

1998) have proposed that tectonic stability, biochemical ecstasy (appearance and 



 31

diversification of Eukaryotes) and oceanic geochemical quiescence derived from 

large ocean-atmosphere equilibrium generated an almost invariant C-isotope 

composition of the Mesoproterozoic seawater. Other authors, in contrast, have 

invoked the occurrence of enhanced Corg matter burial, occurring during the 

agglutination of Rodinia, to explain secular variations in the middle Meso-early 

Neoproterozoic ?13C record (Kah et al. 1999, Bartley et al. 2001). Such an 

enhancement in the Corg burial would have prevented 12C-rich material to oxidize and 

thus, the concomitant incorporation of the available 12C into the ocean water, 

generating high ocean water oxygenation levels that led to an increase in life 

diversification, which in turn, generated a general ?13C increase in the seawater due 

to high 12C biological consumption.  

Alternatively, Bartley and Kah (2003) and Frank et al. (2000, 2003) proposed 

that these slightly fluctuating C-isotope pathways should have been related to large 

changes in the biochemical cycles and in the mass balance between the inorganic 

(Ccarb) and organic (Corg) carbon reservoirs; which would have resulted in 13C 

depleted-anoxic deep ocean and 13C-rich shallow marine waters.  

On the other hand, variation in the Mesoproterozoic Sr-isotope 

chemostratigraphic record has been somehow more understood than the C-isotope 

one, despite the scarcity of data. It has been proposed, for example, that such an 

increase in the seawater Sr-isotope composition (from ~0.704 to ~0.707) occurring 

between the early Mesoproterozoic and early Neoproterozoic seems to have 

occurred as a result of changes in the global tectonic activity (Veizer et al. 1992, Hall 

and Veizer 1996, Gorokhov et al. 1995, Bartley et al. 2001). For instance, the lowest 

values observed during the early Mesoproterozoic have been associated to 

widespread early Riphean rifting activity (Veizer et al. 1992) whereas the high 

radiogenic values obtained for the late Mesoproterozoic - early Neoproterozoic time 

span have been attributed to enhanced continental Sr inputs during the onset of the 

agglutination of Rodinia supercontinent and associate orogenic events (Bartley et al. 

2001, Kah et al. 2001)   

Based on the published C- and Sr-isotope database, on the SCC 

chemostratigraphic record and on other lines of evidence, it seems that the late 

Mesoproterozoic- early Neoproterozoic (1.1-0.97 Ga) C- and Sr-isotope composition 

of seawater would have been primarily controlled by tectonic activity (Fig.7). For 



 32

instance, the positive ?13C values (3-4‰) found in middle-middle Riphean 

successions worldwide (C-isotope stage 1) (Kah et al. 1999, Bartley et al. 2001) 

would have been controlled by a combination of global Corg burial and sequestration 

through subduction during the peak of the Grenville orogeny (~1.1 Ga.), when 

widespread orogenic belts and subduction zones would have extensively developed 

(McLelland et al. 1996). Such an orogenic peak would have also led to moderate 
87Sr/86Sr values (0.7060) (Gorokhov et al. 1995) in the contemporaneous seawater 

as a result of large amounts of juvenile material, generated during the lower Riphean 

rifting event, being incorporated into the continental margins of the forming Rodinia 

supercontinent (Bartley et al. 2001).  

In contrast, during the upper middle - late Riphean time, the occurrence of 

widespread rifting occurring in the São Francisco Craton (D'Agrella-Filho et al. 1990) 

and in between different continental landmasses (~1.05 Ga) (Kröner and Cordani 

2003), including the Transversal Domain in the Borborema Province (e.g Riacho 

Gravata Complex; Brito Neves et al. unpublished results) as well as the apparition of 

several continental margin magmatic arcs (e.g Cariris Velhos, Sri Lanka) (Kröner et 

al. 2003, Kröner and Cordani 2003, Brito Neves et al. unpublished results) would 

have considerably affected the C- and Sr- seawater isotope composition (Fig. 7). The 

former tectonic event, would have generated the decreasing ?13C trends (from +2 to -

2‰) observed in unmetamorphosed sequences (Knoll et al. 1995, Kah et al. 1999, 

Bartley et al. 2001) and those observed in metamorphosed ones (lowermost portion 

of the C-isotope stage 2), as a consequence of the large addition of 13C depleted 

CO2 during oceanic rifting. Additionally, this phenomenon would explain the low 
87Sr/86Sr values (0.705-0.706) encountered for the same time span as a result of 

addition of large volumes of oceanic (juvenile) crust (Fig. 7) (Gorokhov et al. 1995, 

Bartley et al. 2001). 

The occurrence of the above mentioned continental margin magmatic arcs 

(1.0 Ga), in contrast, would have caused the observed  ?13C positive excursion (Knoll 

et al. 1995, Kah et al. 1999, Bartley et al. 2001) during the middle interval of the C-

isotope stage 2. This short lasting and sharply positive excursion would have been 

the result of the extensive sequestration of Corg-rich materials, through burial and 

subduction, during a period of global sea level rise (Knoll et al. 1995, Li et al. 2003); 

which would have caused the C-isotope composition of seawater to fluctuate. In 



 33

other words, the increasing 13C enrichment, which resulted from Corg sequestration, 

would have rapidly shifted back towards the negative values observed below such a 

positive excursion as a result of a sea level rise. Finally, this continental margin 

magmatic arc and related mountain building would have invigorated the exumation of 

continental crust material, causing a slight increase in the 87Sr/86Sr values to 0.7070 

as well (Fig. 7).         

The negative ?13C values (~-2‰) that characterize the middle-upper portion of 

the C-isotope stage 2, which then shift back towards positive values (~+3‰) in its 

upper most part and finally reach ~+3.7‰ in the C-isotope stage 3 characterize the 

early-middle Upper Riphean time and are interpreted here as the conjugation of the 

two following factors: (a) the continuing  sequestration through subduction of 12C-rich 

continental derived material, associated to the onset of the above mentioned 

continental margin magmatic arc (1.0 and 0.97 Ga.) (Kröner et al. 2003, Kröner and 

Cordani 2003), and (b) enhanced global sea level fall (Fig. 7).  

From this panorama, it can be concluded that the C- and Sr- secular variation 

curves for the SCC and, in general, the late Mesoproterozoic- early Neoproterozoic C 

and Sr-isotope curve, seem to represent variations in the original geochemistry of 

seawater, which in turn would have been controlled by worldwide major tectonic 

events during its deposition (e.g. peak of the Grenville orogeny  (1.1 Ga), oceanic 

rifting activity (1.05 Ga) and continental magmatic arc formation (=Cariris Velhos 

event; 1.0- 0.85 Ga). The same kind of mechanisms were evoked by Lindsay and 

Brasier (2002) to explain perturbations in the C-isotope composition of seawater 

during the Paleoproterozoic, period during which tectonic activity produced 

noticeable shifts in the seawater geochemistry after a period of apparent 

geochemical quiescence. Hence, major tectonic episodes must be regarded as 

primordial factors capable to control and modify the global C-cycle and thus the C- 

and Sr - isotope composition of seawater through time.

Resumo 
Valores de isótopos de C e 87Sr/86Sr de cinco seqüências de carbonatos do 

Complexo São Caetano, nordeste do Brasil foram usados para estimar a sua idade 

de deposição e relacionar variações da composição isotópica na água do mar com 

eventos tectônicos globais. Três estágios de variação de isótopos de carbono foram 

identificados de base para o topo numa seção quimioestratigráfica composta: (1) 

estágio em que ?13C varia de +2 a +3.7‰PDB  (media 3‰PDB), (2) estágio no qual 

?13C varia consideravelmente (de -2 a +3‰PDB) e (3) estágio apresentando valores 

constantes de cerca  de +3.7‰PDB. Valores de 87Sr/86Sr ~0.70600 caraterizam o 

estágio isotópico 1, tornando-se mais variáveis no estágio isotópico 2 (entre 

~0.70600 e ~0.70700). Finalmente, valores em torno de 0.70600 caraterizam o 

estagio isotópico 3.        

A quimioestratigrafía de C e Sr permite concluir que: (a) as curvas de variação 

seculares dos carbonatos do Complexo São Caetano registram flutuações primárias 

na composição isotópica de C e Sr da água do mar durante a passagem Meso-

Neoproterozoico na Província Borborema; (b) o ciclo orogênico Cariris 

velhos/Grenville, a ocorrência de rifteamento e formação de arcos magmáticos 

continentais, e a formação do supercontinente Rodinia, controlaram a composição 

isotópica de C e Sr da água do mar durante os estágios isotópicos 1, 2, 3.

ABSTRACT 
Amphibolite-facies marbles of the São Caetano Complex (SCC), Borborema 

structural province, northeastern Brazil, show near primary (sedimentary) ?13Cc (calcite) 

values (from -2.2 to +3.7‰PDB), which fall into the range for ?13Cc values of Meso-

Neoproterozoic limestone successions. However, some anomalous negative C-

isotope shifts (up to 4‰ PDB) are interpreted as the result of modifications of the C-

isotope composition during metamorphism, caused by diffusion of CH4 (derived from 
12C-rich organic matter) into calcite. Absence of anomalous 13C-rich carbonate 

samples indicate that C-isotope fractionation associated to diffusion of 13C-rich CO2 

(from graphite or from silicate-carbonate reactions) into calcite did not occur. This 

contention is supported by uncoupled behavior of ?13Cc and ?18O values. 

Geochemical indicators falling into accepted ranges for unaltered Meso-

Neoproterozoic limestone (e.g. average Sr contents of 1500 ppm, Mn/Sr ratios from 

0.006 to 0.140, and Rb/Sr ratios between 0 and 0.005) indicate that the element and 

isotope compositions of the precursor limestone were buffered prior to the activity of 

metamorphic fluids. This suggests that the undepleted ?13Cc and 87Sr/86Sr (from 

0.706 to 0.707) values for the SCC marbles reflect the isotope signature of the Meso-

Neoproterozoic seawater from which the limestone protoliths were deposited. 

Co-variation of ?13Cc and ?13Cg (graphite) values suggests that calcite-organic 

matter fractionation during metamorphism was homogeneous in all of the studied 

marbles. Slight enrichments in the ?13Cg values and further depletions in the ?13Cc 

ones may have resulted from stronger organic matter-calcite C-isotope fractionation 

during metamorphism as a consequence of high organic matter/graphite contents 

(8%). Metamorphism temperatures, between 514 and 761oC, estimated from calcite-

graphite C-isotope thermometry are in agreement with the temperature range 

deduced from the paragenesis calcite-quartz-muscovite-tremolite-diopside-garnet. 

Anomalously high metamorphic temperatures (up to 1075oC) were also estimated 

from samples with the highest graphite contents and, hence, the more depleted ?13Cc 

values, nevertheless, these metamorphic temperatures are considered artifacts. 

Since there is no petrographic evidence of retrograde metamorphism, it is proposed 

that anomalous ?13Cc depletions observed in the SCC marbles occurred during 

prograde regional metamorphism.

1. Introduction 
Variations in the C, O and Sr-isotope composition of marine carbonates have 

been successfully used to determine changes in the isotope geochemistry of ancient 

oceans (Veizer and Hoefs, 1976). The chemostratigraphic technique has been 

extensively used with great success in well-preserved Phanerozoic limestone 

successions (Scholle et al., 1986; Mitchell et al., 1996), and even in Proterozoic 

ones, in which strong post-depositional alterations of the isotope signatures are 

common (Kaufman et al., 1991; Derry et al., 1992).  

The reliability of the chemostratigraphic approach, however, depends on 

whether the original isotope composition of limestones was preserved after their 

deposition (Kaufman et al., 1991). Diagenesis and/or metamorphism have been 

considered as the main processes that affect the original isotope composition of 

carbonates because of increase of temperature or interaction with 

diagenetic/metamorphic fluids (Banner and Hanson, 1990; Kaufman et al., 1991). 

Modifications of the isotope composition of carbonates have been also related to: (1) 

presence of organic matter, graphite and/or silicates; (2) interaction with primary or 

secondary internal and external fluids holding different isotope composition; (3) 

presence of different carbonate phases; and (4) extent of fluid-rock interaction during 

precipitation, deposition and post-depositional processes (Brand and Veizer, 1980a, 

b; Veizer, 1983; Banner and Hanson, 1990; Kaufman et al., 1991).  

Several approaches have been adopted to investigate post-depositional 

alteration of isotope signatures in carbonate sequences, and to avoid misleading 

chemostratigraphic results (Kaufman et al., 1991; Derry et al., 1992). Nevertheless, 

these approaches have been largely applied to sedimentary successions and their 

efficiency on metamorphosed examples has remained an open question (Melezhik et 

al., 2001; Melezhik and Fallick, 2003).  

This study aims to evaluate possible causes of anomalously depleted ?13Cc 

values observed in the C-isotope chemostratigraphic profiles of graphite-bearing and 

graphite-rich marbles, from the São Caetano Complex (SCC), northeastern Brazil, 

which although show ?13Cc values between -2.2 and + 3.7 ‰PDB, falling within the 

ranges for late Meso-early Neoproterozoic limestone, show some anomalous 

negative ?13Cc shifts (as large as 4‰) jeopardizing the chemostratigraphic 

interpretations (Silva et al., submmited). It also aims assessing the reliability of the 



 

 

16

application of C-isotope stratigraphy to marbles and establishing the conditions under 

which such anomalous C-isotope depletions took place. Finally, the accuracy of the 

elemental and isotopic indicators used to assure the reliability of chemostratigraphic 

studies is assessed by applying a multivariable approach, in which the methods used 

by Kaufman et al. (1991) and Melezhik et al. (2001) (e.g elemental and isotope 

geochemistry of marbles, petrography, cathodoluminescence) are complemented by 

analyses of the graphite C-isotope composition, classifications of the mineralogical 

assemblages and use of C-isotope thermometry (calcite-graphite).  

 2. Geological setting and age 
The SCC is a metavolcano-sedimentary sequence composed of garnet-biotite 

paragneiss, quartzite, marble, metadacite, metarhyolite, and metabasalt, which occur 

in the Alto Pajeú Terrane, Transversal Domain of the Borborema structural province, 

northeastern Brazil (Fig. 1). The studied marbles are interbedded with 

metagraywacke successions and present variable thickness, which diminishes up-

section. They are mainly calcitic and contain silicate mineral assemblages typical of 

amphibolite facies (quartz- muscovite-tremolite- diopside- garnet; Silva et al., 

submitted, Fig. 2). These marbles also contain considerable amounts of graphite, 

which are found either disseminated or disposed in layers, whose abundance and 

thickness increase up-section (Fig. 3). 

FIGURE 1 
The age of the SCC is poorly constrained. The oldest age (&gt;1.3 Ga, U-Pb) 

proposed to this complex was inferred from Archean to Late Mesoproterozoic detrital 

zircons collected from metagraywackes in its uppermost portion (Brito Neves et al., 

2002).The youngest age has been assumed from a 0.96 Ga U-Pb age for a 

granodioritic-biotite orthogneiss that intruded the metagraywacke successions 

overlying the studied marbles (Kozuch, 2003). According to Silva et al. (submitted), 

the original limestone sequences (marble precursors) of the São Caetano Complex 

were deposited between 1.1 and 0.97 Ga. The SCC was strongly affected by 

widespread shearing and folding, however, no direct dating of the metamorphism has 

been done and the regional metamorphism has been attributed to the Brasiliano 

event (0.75-0.5 Ga; Brito Neves et al., 2002; Gomes, 1999).  

3. Analytical techniques 
Marble samples were examined in thin-section to determine their mineral 

paragenesis. Cathodoluminiscence (CL) analyses were also performed to support the 



 

 

17

petrographic analyses. The CL examination of rock slabs was done by using a 

Nuclide Corporation ELM-3R Luminoscope attachment mounted on an Olympus 

zoom stereomicroscope at the University of São Paulo. Test observations were made 

using both low power (7.5kV/0.5mA) and high power (15 kV/1 mA) electron beams, 

and defocused to cover elliptical areas of about 2.5-3cm x 1.5-2.0cm, corresponding 

to beam powers of ~1.3 and ~3.3 µa.mm-2, respectively. The vacuum was held at 

about 50 mtorr.   

Determinations of minor and major elements were performed using X-Ray 

fluorescence in a Rigaku RIX 3000 XRF unit equipped with a Rh tube, at the XRF 

Laboratory, Department of Geology, Federal University of Pernambuco. Analyses of 

major and minor elements are reported in parts per million (ppm) (Table 1). 

For carbonate C- and O-isotope analyses, micro-drilled carbonate samples 

were reacted with 100% orthophosphoric acid during 12 hours at 25oC (3 days when 

dolomite was apparently present). The CO2 released from this reaction was extracted 

in a high-vacuum extraction line by using cryogenic cleaning according to the method 

proposed by Craig (1957). The CO2 samples were analyzed for C and O- isotopes in 

a double-inlet gas source, triple-collector mass spectrometer (Sira II), at the Stable 

Isotope Laboratory (LABISE), Department of Geology, Federal University of 

Pernambuco. The isotopic compositions were contrasted against the in-house 

standard Borborema Skarn Calcite (BSC), which calibrated against the NBS-18, 

NBS-19 and NBS-20 standards, shows an isotopic composition of ?18O = -1.28 ± 

0.04‰ PDB and  ?13C = -8.58 ± 0.02‰ PDB.  

For determination of the Sr-isotopic composition, 5 mg of powdered carbonate 

sample were leached in 0.5 M ultraclean acetic acid, and centrifuged to obtain 

purified Sr. Rb and Sr were separated from the leachates by standard ion-exchange 

techniques. 500 to 1000 ng of purified Sr together with 1µg H3PO4 were loaded onto 

a Ta filament for TIMS analysis on a seven collector Mat 262 instrument at the 

Geochronology Laboratory, Institute of Geosciences, University of Brasilia. 

For graphite C-isotope analyses, 5 mg of pure and clean graphite were hand 

picked after dissolving all the carbonate fraction of the marbles by treating 5g of 

grounded sample with 30% acetic acid for four hours. About 0.25 mg of pure graphite 

were analyzed for C-isotopes in a Finnigan Delta Plus Advantage instrument at the 

Department of Geology of the State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ). The 



 

 

18

reproducibility of the analyses is better than ~0.05 ‰. Graphite C-isotope data are 

reported relative to the PDB scale. 

4. Results and Discussion  
4.1 Petrography and cathodoluminescence 

Modifications in the element and isotope composition of carbonates are 

usually accompanied by changes in their mineralogical, textural and luminescence 

features (Fairchild and Spiro, 1987; Fairchild et al., 1990; Derry et al., 1992).  

Reduction in the carbonate crystal size and the presence of bright yellow, orange-red 

to red CL, which is activated by Mn concentrations as low as ~1 ppm and is just 

perceptible at Mn concentrations above 10 ppm, when usually violet colors are 

visible, have been regarded as the most diagnostic features forecasting such 

modifications (Marshall, 1988, 1992; Kaufman et al., 1991; Kaufman and Knoll, 1995; 

Habermann et al., 1998; Kah et al., 1999).  

Based on these assumptions, petrographic and cathodoluminescence (CL) 

characterizations of selected samples were performed to predict elemental and 

isotopic modifications and to discriminate against potentially altered samples.  

Petrographic analyses show that the studied marbles are well-crystallized and 

mainly calcitic. A fining-up tendency is observed in the calcite crystal size, which is 

very variable (between 0.8 and 4 mm; Fig.2 A1, B1) within and between the 

stratigraphic sections (Fig. 3). Calcite does not present exsolution textures, except 

when in contact with graphite, whose modal content reaches up to 8%. Graphite 

presents a coarsening-up tendency (up to 5 mm), and are randomly distributed 

(disseminated and/or in layers) within the stratigraphic sections (Fig. 3). Silicate 

phases are also found in these marbles (quartz, muscovite, tremolite, diopside, 

garnet) but in negligible amount (&lt;0.5% on average; Fig. 2 A1,B1).  

FIGURE 2 
CL analyses, on the other hand, reveal overgrowths on calcite grains, which 

are better seen in reflected light as thin white films (Fig. 2A2, B2). The typical Mn-

activated, bright orange to red CL, is usually absent; whereas dull CL predominates 

(Fig. 2A3).  Dull red or violet CL was found only in one sample from the Sitio dos 

Nunes section (Fig 2B3) and light blue CL was observed in isolated grains of one 

sample from the Pedra de Cal section (Flor 5).  

Our first screen for isotopically modified samples shows that no signs of 

modifications in the elemental and isotopic compositions are present in the studied 



 

 

19

marbles. Thus all samples were considered for the chemostratigraphic 

characterization of the carbonates successions, regardless the metamorphism to 

which they were submitted. However, some samples with predominant dull CL, high 

graphite contents and reduced calcite crystal-size (Table 1) show anomalously 

depleted ?13Cc values (see discussion below). This suggests that the application of 

CL analyses in the prediction of modifications in the C-isotope composition of 

carbonates seems to not always properly work. Limitations of CL in the selection of 

isotopically unmodified samples have already been noted by other authors, although 

it does represent a useful filter to be complemented by other observations (e.g. 

Kaufman et al., 1991; Kaufman and Knoll, 1995; Kah et al., 1999).  

Since high graphite contents and reduced calcite crystal-sizes are common 

and diagnostic features of samples affected by graphite-calcite C-isotope 

fractionation during metamorphism (Dunn and Valley, 1992; Kitchen and Valley, 

1995; Satish-Kumar et al., 2002), it is suggested that the anomalous depletions in the 

?13Cc values can be related to the presence of graphite. The mineral parageneses, 

typical of amphibolite facies, coupled with the lack of retrogression signs, indicate 

that the original limestone sequences were only subjected to a prograde regional 

metamorphic event.  

Finally, high Fe concentrations are proposed here as the cause of 

suppressions of the Mn activated (bright) CL, since XRF analyses show that most of 

the analyzed samples contain Mn concentrations above 10 ppm and Fe contents up 

to 1400 ppm (see the following section and Table 1). 

4.2 Elemental and isotopic geochemistry   

?13Cc values between -2.2 and + 3.7 ‰PDB and 87Sr/86Sr ratios between 0.706 

and 0.707 were observed in the SCC marbles. These values fall within the expected 

ranges of Meso-Neoproterozoic limestone and are believed to reflect those of the 

seawater from which the original limestones were precipitated (Silva et al., submitted; 

Fig. 3). However the occurrence of some samples with anomalously depleted ?13Cc 

values (excursions up to 4‰ PDB), which are not observed in the well preserved 

sedimentary counterparts (Kah et al., 1999; Bartley et al., 2001), indicates that 

modifications of their original C-isotope composition could have occurred after 

deposition of their sedimentary protoliths.   



 

 

20

The geochemical values, on the other hand, fall within the ranges proposed by 

Brand and Veizer (1980a) for unaltered marine limestones (Sr contents between 

~800 and ~2100 ppm, with an average of 1500 ppm, Rb &amp;lt;10 ppm, Mn 10-85 ppm, 

Fe 500-2000 ppm; Table 1, Fig. 3). The geochemical ratios (Mn/Sr &amp;lt;1, Rb/Sr &amp;lt;0.2, 

Ca/Sr &amp;lt;0.004; Table 1) fall into the ranges for Meso-Neoproterozoic limestone 

sequences worldwide whose isotope compositions reflect that of their precursor 

seawaters (Kah et al., 1999, 2001; Bartley et al., 2001). Since no anomalous 

elemental concentrations and/or ratios were observed, it is also proposed that the 

element geochemistry of the marble may well reflect that of their sedimentary 

precursors.  

The geochemical values reported above indicate that although the elemental 

composition of the studied marbles preserved the original composition of their 

sedimentary precursor, in some cases, the isotopic signature seem to have not been 

preserved. Since slight modifications of the carbonates isotope composition can be 

accompanied by pronounced changes in their values of global geochemistry (Brand 

and Veizer, 1980a, b; Veizer, 1983) when submitted either to diagenesis or 

metamorphism, the reliability of the reported isotope and elemental data need to be 

further evaluated in order to assure the validity of the chemostratigraphic record.  

4.3 Geochemical screen for isotopically modified samples 
Changes in Sr/Mn, Ca/Sr and Sr/Rb ratios, accompanying modifications of the 

isotope signature of carbonates, are often recognized and attributed to post-

depositional processes (Brand and Veizer, 1980a, b). Mn/Sr = 3, Rb/Sr = 0.5 and 

Ca/Sr = 0.1 have been proposed as the upper limits to identify possible modifications 

of the original isotope composition of marine carbonates, and used to screen for 

possible modifications in the isotope composition and to investigate their possible 

causes (Brand and Veizer, 1980a, b; Veizer, 1983; Kaufman et al., 1991; Derry et al., 

1992; Bartley et al., 2001; Melezhik et al., 2001).  

Since the elemental composition of the SCC marbles fall within the above 

mentioned ranges, establishing whether the anomalously depleted ?13Cc values 

represent primary (sedimentary) signatures, or whether they are a consequence of 

modifications of the C-isotope composition after deposition, has remained relatively 

difficult.  In order to overcome with this problem, a combination of the isotopic and 

elemental approaches proposed by Kaufman et al. (1991), Kaufman and Knoll 

(1995), Melezhik et al. (2001) and Melezhik and Fallick (2003) (Fig 4a-f, 5a-d), and 



 

 

21

detailed petrographic studies and determinations of the C-isotope composition of 

graphite was used (Fig. 6a-d, 7 a-d).  

The application of the correlation diagrams proposed by Kaufman et al. (1991) 

shows that although most of the studied marbles seem to have preserved the original 

C- and O-isotope composition of their parent sediments, modifications in the C- and 

O-isotope composition of some samples seem to have occurred since coupled 

depletions in their ?13Cc and ?18O values are present (Fig. 4a). Nevertheless, the 

modified nature of these samples can be considered as artifacts since they do also 

fall into the fields of unaltered limestones when contrasting their isotope composition 

against some elemental indicators (see alteration trends in Figs. 4b-4f).  

FIGURE 4 
The correlation diagrams proposed by Melezhik et al. (2001) and Melezhick 

and Fallick (2003) also show that most samples fall within the fields of isotopically 

unmodified limestone (Fig.5 a). This suggests that the C and Sr-isotope compositions 

of the SCC marbles represent that of the seawater from which their sedimentary 

precursors were deposited. Although some samples presenting high 87Sr/86Sr ratios 

and low ?13Cc values seem to have undergone modifications in their Sr-isotope 

composition, the uncoupled variation of the 87Sr/86Sr and ?18O values (Fig. 5b) and 

the slight variability of the ?18O ones (Fig 4a, 5b) further account for the unmodified 

nature of their Sr-isotope signature. Even though this is at odds with the alteration 

trends observed when contrasting the 87Sr/86Sr ratios against the most sensitive 

elemental indicators (e.g. Mn/Sr, Mg/Ca, Fig 5 c,d), Mn/Sr ratios &amp;lt;1 and  Mg/Ca 

ratios &amp;lt;0.02 preclude with this idea.      

FIGURE 5 
The complementary analyses proposed here (Fig 6a,d, 7a) show a negative 

correlation between the C and O-isotope composition of carbonates and the graphite 

contents; the samples with the highest graphite contents usually having the lowest 

?13Cc and ?18O values (Fig. 6a). Major ?13Cc depletions were found in samples in 

which graphite is agglutinated and disposed in layers (Fig 6b) and also in samples 

with larger graphite flakes (Fig. 6c). Conversely, depletions in the ?13Cc values occur 

independently of the presence and proportions of the silicate minerals (Fig. 6d). 

Major depletions in the ?13Cc values were found in samples with the lowest graphite 

C-isotope compositions (?13Cg values, Fig. 7b). 



 

 

22

FIGURE 6 
On the basis of the results reported above, it can be envisaged that the 

unusual depleted ?13Cc values observed in some the studied carbonates are related 

to the former presence of 12C-depleted organic matter. These anomalous depletions 

would have resulted from organic matter-calcite C-isotope fractionation during 

prograde metamorphism, independently of modifications in the elemental and O and 

Sr-isotope compositions. This suggests that the coupled behavior of the C and O-

isotope chemostratigraphic curves in the studied carbonates does not necessarily 

point out post-depositional modification of the isotope signature, and thus represent 

original secular variations of the isotope composition of the sedimentary precursors.    

Finally, since the O and Sr-isotope composition of carbonates is significantly 

more affected than the C-isotope one, by the action of invading fluids during 

diagenesis and/or metamorphism, modifications of the C-isotope composition of the 

studied marbles by these means can be discarded. This idea is further supported by 

the element geochemistry which resembles that of coeval limestone successions and 

suggests that the sedimentary protoliths were effectively buffered by ocean water 

during early diagenesis.  

4.4 Evaluation of possible mechanisms of modification of the C-isotope 
composition in the São Caetano Complex marbles  

Several authors (e.g. Bottinga, 1969; Shieh and Taylor, 1969; Arita and Wada, 

1990; Chacko et al., 1991; Kaufman et al., 1991; Dunn and Valley, 1992; Melezhik et 

al., 2001; Melezhik and Fallick, 2003) have investigated the possible causes of 

modifications in the isotope composition of organic mater/silicate-rich carbonates 

during metamorphism. For instance, depletions in the carbonate ?13Cc and ?18O 

values during contact and regional metamorphism have been identified and attributed 

to silicate-carbonate reactions involving the generation of 13C-rich and 18O-rich CO2 

fluids (Shieh and Taylor, 1969; Winkler, 1979). Progressive depletions in the 

carbonate C-isotope values and concomitant increases of the graphite C-isotope 

ones have also been identified in graphite-bearing marbles, and attributed to diffusion 

of 12C-rich CH4 (released from organic matter) into calcite (Dunn and Valley, 1992; 

Kitchen and Valley, 1995).  

Increases in the carbonate ?13C values, on the other hand, have been 

attributed to diffusion of  13C-rich CO2 derived organic matter/graphite into calcite, but 



 

 

23

its occurrence depends on whether it takes place in a closed (buffered) system or not 

(Evans et al., 2002 and references therein). Modifications in the O-isotope 

composition of carbonates has been attributed to this process, but have not been 

identified during diffusion of graphite released CH4  into carbonate ( Chacko et al., 

1991; Bergfeld et al., 1996; Evans et al., 2002). Modifications in the 87Sr/86Sr values 

related to incorporations of external fluids can also occur, but they depend on the 

fluid/rock ratios (Derry et al., 1992; Bickle et al., 1997).  

Considering that the SCC marbles contain both silicate minerals and graphite, 

any of the above-mentioned mechanisms may have been responsible for the 

anomalous depleted ?13Cc values. Nevertheless, since the depletions are not related 

to the presence of silicate minerals (Fig. 6d), but to the presence of graphite, an 

evaluation of the mechanisms involving organic matter/graphite in modifications of 

the C-isotope composition of carbonates is necessary.  

In order to determine these mechanisms, further determinations of the C-

isotope composition of coexisting graphite (?13Cg) and carbonates (?13Cc) were 

performed in samples whose sedimentary C-isotope composition seems to have 

been potentially preserved (undepleted) and in samples in which potential 

modifications (anomalously depleted ?13Cc values) seem to have occurred. Samples 

were selected from two stratigraphic sections based on the coherence of the C-

isotope chemostratigraphic pathways (see selected samples in Table 1).  

Comparisons between ?13Cc and ?18O values reveal that the isotope 

composition of some of the samples presenting anomalous depleted ?13Cc values 

can be considered as unmodified, since almost constant ?18O values predominates 

(Fig. 7a). On the other hand, positive correlations between the ?13Cc and ?13Cg values 

of both potentially modified and unmodified samples were observed (Fig. 7b). 

Nevertheless, uncoupled variations of the ?13Cc and ?13Cg values of potentially 

modified and unmodified samples within single sections were also observed. Lower 

calcite-graphite C-isotope fractionation values (? 13Cc-Cg) were also observed in 

potentially modified samples within single sections. A negative correlation was   

observed when contrasting the ? 13Cc-Cg and ?13Cg values. No correlation was 

observed between the ? 13Cc-Cg and ?13Cc values (Figs. 7c-d).  

FIGURE 7 



 

 

24

Three lines of evidence point to closed-system diffusion of organic 

matter/graphite- derived CH4 into calcite as the most likely process that should have 

modified the C-isotope composition of the SCC marbles during metamorphism: 

1) The highest ?13Cc values (~3‰ PDB) observed in some of the potentially 

unmodified samples fall into the expected ranges for Meso-Neoproterozoic 

sequences (Fig. 8). If diffusion of organic matter/graphite derived CO2 into calcite had 

occurred, higher ?13Cc values and modified ?18O ones would have also occurred, 

since the CO2 resulting from this process is 13C-rich; and external O-rich fluids are 

needed to account for its formation during volatilization of organic matter. Since the 

SCC marbles seem to have remained as a closed system, as shown by the element 

geochemistry, incorporation of external O-rich fluids is unlikely and thus formation of 
13C-rich CO2 derived from graphite discarded.  

2) Smaller ? 13Cc-Cg values were identified in isotopically modified samples 

with the higher ?13Cg values (Fig 7c). Since during diffusion of organic 

matter/graphite-derived 12C-rich CH4 into calcite, graphite becomes more depleted in 
12C and calcite becomes enriched in that isotope, lowering the ? 13Cc-Cg values, this 

process is proposed as the responsible of the anomalously depleted ?13Cc values.   

3) Slight changes in the ?13Cc values with respect to the ? 13Cc-Cg ones were 

observed between potentially modified and unmodified samples; however the lower 

the ?13Cc values of isotopically modified samples, the lower the ? 13Cc-Cg values (Fig. 

7d). This kind of behavior discards the possibility of diffusion of 13C-rich CO2 (derived 

from organic matter/graphite) into calcite as the mechanism leading to depleted ?13Cc 

values, since during such a process the ?13Cg and ?13Cc values are expected to 

decrease and increase respectively concomitantly with increases in the ? 13Cc-Cg 

values. This in turn may indicate that the calcite-graphite C-isotope fractionation 

occurred heterogeneously within single sections.  

4.5 Calcite-graphite thermometry 
Considering that a C-isotope fractionation between calcite and organic 

matter/graphite was invoked to explain anomalous depletions in the ?13Cc values of 

some the studied marbles; and that this process is temperature dependent (Bottinga, 

1969; Valley and O’Neil , 1981; Wada and Suzuki, 1983; Dun and Valley, 1992; 

Kitchen and Valley, 1995; Valley, 2001; Evans et al. 2002), isotopically modified 

(depleted ?13Cc values) and unmodified (no depleted ?13Cc values) samples from two 



 

 

25

different stratigraphic sections were used to estimate the temperature at which such 

a C-isotope fractionation occurred. These samples were also selected to evaluate the 

effect of modifications in the C-isotope composition of carbonates on the 

metamorphic temperature estimates (MT), since the proposed calcite-graphite 

isotope fractionation occurred heterogeneously within single sections. MT estimates 

were performed by using the equation by Dunn and Valley (1992), given that the co-

variation of our calcite-graphite fractionation values and temperature estimates are 

quite similar to those reported elsewhere, which used this equation (Table1, Figs 8 a-

b). Nevertheless, MT were also estimated from the equation Kitchen and Valley 

(1995) to assure the reliability of the data.  
After applying the equation of Dunn and Valley (1992) MP between 578o and 

1075oC and between 514o and 761oC were estimated for the Pedra de Cal and 

Rodiador sections respectively (Fig. 8c). Higher MT estimates were obtained from the 

equation of Kitchen and Valley (1995) for samples falling above the 650oC isograd of 

Dunn and Valley (1992) (Fig. 8b-d). The opposite behavior is observed below such 

an isograd. MT as low as 452oC and as high as 2191oC were also estimated from the 

equation of Kitchen and Valley (1995), but considered as artifacts since they are not 

in agreement with the mineral paragenesis (calcite, quartz, muscovite, tremolite, 

diopside, garnet). 

Based on the above results, it is suggested that calcite-graphite C-isotope 

fractionation affecting some of the SCC marbles occurred at temperatures between 

514 and 761oC. This is supported by the MT estimated from the equation of Dunn 

and Valley (1992) which are in good agreement with me mineral paragenesis. The 

application of the equation of Kitchen and Valley (1995) seems to have yielded on 

incongruent MT. Although our results show that the studied marbles where subjected 

to a very wide range of temperatures, it is proposed that differences in MT estimates 

within/between stratigraphic sections are due to the following factors: (1) Secular 

variations the ?13Cg values (higher MT are observed in samples with similar ?13Cc 

values and more enriched ?13Cg ones within/between sections (Fig. 8d). Co-variation 

of the ?13Cg values and the MT estimates supports this contention  and  also explains 

the higher MT estimated for the Pedra de Cal section, which present lower ?13Cc 

values (Figs. 8 c-d, 9, Table 1). (2) Altered nature of the ?13Cc values and variable 

graphite contents. Samples whose ?13Cc values had been potentially lowered always 



 

 

26

yielded on temperatures above the 650oC, whereas isotopically unmodified samples 

yielded temperatures below this value (Fig. 8b). Although the highest MT (&gt;800oC) 

was estimated for one isotopically unmodified sample, it seems to have resulted from 

its higher graphite contents (&gt;8%), and hence the further alteration of its graphite C-

isotope composition (Figs 8 c-d, 9, Table 1). (3) Variations in graphite disposition 

within the stratigraphic section. This factor seems to have favored the C-isotope 

exchange between graphite and calcite and thus the MT estimates, since major 

depletions in the ?13Cc values and smaller fractionation values were found in samples 

in which graphite is agglutinated and disposed in layers (Figs 6c,b, 9).  

Finally, since no retrograde textures were observed in the marbles and the 

graphite was not armored by other minerals, it is proposed that the 12C-rich CH4 – 

calcite diffusion process causing modified (depleted) ?13Cc values occurred during 

prograde-regional metamorphism. 

FIGURE 8 
FIGURE 9 

5. CONCLUSIONS 
The C, O and Sr- isotope composition of the Meso-Neoproterozoic São 

Caetano Complex marbles seem to reflect the original isotope composition of the 

seawater the original limestone (marble protoliths) were deposited from. 

Nevertheless, some anomalous depletions in the ?13Cc values (up to 4‰), hampering 

the chemostratigraphic analyses were considered as artifacts, and resulted from 

diffusion of 12C-rich CH4 (derived from organic matter/graphite) into calcite during 

metamorphism (see corrected and uncorrected ?13Cc secular variation curve in Fig. 

9). These modifications were favored by high graphite contents and by the layered 

accumulation of graphite within the marbles. Alterations in the C-isotope composition 

associated to silicate-calcite reactions, which generally involve generation of 13C-rich 

CO2, are absent.  

Modifications of the C-isotope composition of carbonates resulting from 

incorporation of external fluids, holding different isotopic composition, during both, 

diagenesis and metamorphism, is unlikely, since excellent buffering the original 

limestone sequences (marble precursors) seems to have occurred prior to 

metamorphism. This is evidenced by the unaltered nature of samples demonstrated 

in geochemical screen (Sr contents average 1500 ppm, Mn/Sr ratios from 0.006 to 



 

 

27

0.140, and Rb/Sr ratios between 0 and 0.005), which resembles that of well 

preserved Meso-Neoproterozoic limestone, and by the slightly variable O (from -6 to -

10‰) and Sr (from 0.706-0707) isotope signature of samples that underwent C-

isotope change. This also indicates that the SCC marbles preserved the isotope 

composition of their sedimentary precursor even after metamorphism. This suggests 

that modifications of the C- isotope composition of organic matter-bearing and 

organic matter-rich carbonates can occur during metamorphism independently of 

modifications in their Sr-isotope and elemental composition.     

The observed depletions in the ?13Cc values seem to have occurred at 

temperatures varying from 514 to 761oC, as estimated from the calcite-graphite 

thermometry. These temperatures, coupled with absence of retrograde signs in the 

marbles, suggest that the 12C-rich CH4-calcite diffusion, leading to the anomalous 

depleted ?13Cc values, occurred under prograde metamorphism (amphibolite-facies). 

The estimated metamorphic temperature range is in good agreement with the mineral 

paragenisis (calcite, quartz, muscovite, tremolite, diopside, garnet). Although 

temperatures as high as 1075oC were estimated, they seem to be related to larger 

changes in the calcite and graphite C-isotope compositions, resulting from the 

presence of high amounts of graphite (up to 8%). Differences in the metamorphic 

temperature estimates from unaltered samples belonging to a single stratigraphic 

section were also observed and resulted from variations in the graphite C-isotope 

composition. This factor has been ignored by many other authors and need to be 

taken into account when using the calcite-graphite thermometer.   

Finally, our results indicate that since modifications in the C-isotope 

composition of graphite-bearing and graphite-rich marbles can take place 

independently of variations in the O and Sr-isotope and elemental geochemistry, the 

sole application of the traditional geochemical approaches (e.g. Kaufman et al., 1991, 

Kaufman and Knoll, 1995, Melezhik et al., 2001 and Melezhik and Fallick, 2003) 

should be considered with caution when working with these kind of lithologies, given 

the complexity of processes involved during diagenesis and metamorphism. For 

chemostratigraphic purposes, a union of the methods proposed by Kaufman et al. 

(1991), Melezhik et al. (2001) and Melezhik and Fallick (2003) with those herein 

proposed seems to be the most appropriated approach on the identification of post-

depositional modifications in the C-isotope composition of graphite-rich marbles. It is 

important mentioning that our results preclude with the idea that coupled depletions 



 

 

28

in the ?13Cc and ?18O values of marine carbonates reflect modifications in the 

carbonates isotope signature, and that modifications in their isotope composition are 

accompanied by modifications in the elemental geochemistry. They instead suggest 

that if coherent secular variation pathways of both, ?13Cc and ?18O values, are found, 

the preservation of the primary (sedimentary) isotope signatures of marbles can be 

assured.

Figure 2. Main petrographic and luminescence characteristics observed in the SCC 

marbles. A) Flores 2, Pedra de Cal section),  B) Nunes 2, Sitio dos Nunes 

section. Coarse-sized calcite crystals are commonly identified in thin section 

(A1, B1) and in sample slabs by using reflected light (A2,B2). CL 

photomicrographs show the low to non-luminescent nature of the SCC 

marbles (A3-B3).      

Figure 3. Lithologic, isotopic and elemental stratigraphy of the studied marbles. (A) 

Pedra de Cal, (B) Malutagem, (C) Sito dos Nunes, (D) Rodiador, (E) Santa 

Rosa. All sections show an opposite behavior between the carbonate C-

isotope (?13Cc) and O-isotope (?18O) secular variation curves. Note the 

mimetic behavior of the graphite (?13Cg) and carbonate (?13Cc) C-isotope 

secular curves in the Pedra de Cal and  Rodiador sections. Also note the 

opposite behavior between the ?13Cc and the graphite content secular curves 

in all sections.

Arrows indicate geochemical post-depositional alteration trends as proposed 

by Derry et al. (1992) and Kaufman et al. (1991). Note that most samples fall 

into the unaltered fields, suggesting that marbles probably preserved the C 

and O-isotope composition of the original limestone sequences. In A, numbers 

indicate the average fields for the isotope composition for the different marble

Figure 5. Cross-plots of the isotope and elemental data from the SCC marbles. 

Arrows indicate geochemical post-depositional alteration trends as proposed 

by Melezihk et al., 2001 and Melezihk and Fallick, 2003. Non alteration trends 

were identified, indicating that must likely the Sr-isotope composition of the 

original limestone successions was preserved.   

Figure 6. Cross-plots showing variations in the C and O -isotope signature of 

selected samples (see Table 1) with respect to graphite contend (A), graphite 

disposition (B), graphite crystal size (C) and silicate assemblages (D). Arrows 

indicate geochemical post-depositional alteration trends as proposed by Derry 

et al. (1992) and Kaufman et al. (1991). 

Figure 7. Cross-plots of the isotope data obtained for selected carbonate and 

graphite samples of the SCC. A) Variations in the calcite C (?13Cc) and O 

(?18O) isotope composition. Arrows show the alteration trends as proposed by 

Derry et al. (1992) and Kaufman et al. (1991). B)  Variation in the ?13Cc and 

graphite C-isotope values (?13Cg). Arrows show the good positive correlation 

between the ?13Cc and ?13Cg values in both unaltered and altered samples. C) 

Variation between the calcite-graphite fractionation values (?13Cc-Cg) and the 

?13Cg values. Arrow shows the negative correlation between ?13Cc-Cg and 

?13Cg in both unaltered and altered samples. Also note that altered samples 

show smaller ?13Cc-Cg values than the unaltered ones. D) Variations between 

the ?13Cc-Cg and the ?13Cc values. Observe the negative correlation between 

?13Cc-Cg and ?13Cc (see arrow) and the more depleted ?13Cc shown by altered 

samples.

Rodiador, 5. Santa Rosa. Stratigraphic variations in the mineral assemblages 

are also shown: quartz (Qz), muscovite (Mus), tremolite (Tr), diopside (Dip), 

garnet (Gt). The unaltered and altered ?13Cc secular curves were constructed

carbonate (?13Cc) and graphite (?13Cg) C-isotope secular variation curves. Also 

note the inverse behavior of the ?13Cc and ?13Cg curves with respect to the 

graphite contend one. Note the mimetic behavior between variations in the 

?13Cg and metamorphic temperatures (MT). Roman numbers indicate the C-

CONCLUSÕES 
 

A quimioestratigrafía dos mármores do Complexo São Caetano (CSC), 

localizados na zona transversal da Província Estrutural da Borborema, mostra 

variações moderadamente altas nos valores de ?13C (-2,7 a +3,7‰PDB), 

acompanhadas por variações moderadas nos valores de 87Sr/86Sr (entre 0,706 e 

0,707).   Após comparar as curvas de variação seculares obtidas a partir de isótopos 

de C e Sr para os mármores estudados com curvas de seqüências de carbonatos 

sedimentares bem conhecidas a nível mundial (Kah et al., 1999, 2001, Bartley et al., 

2001) uma idade Meso-Neoproterozóica (1,1-0,97 Ga) é inferida para a deposição 

dos protólitos sedimentares dos mármores do CSC.  

A idade de sedimentação acima proposta, unida a evidencias regionais tais 

como a presença de seqüências tipo MORB de 1,05 Ga a oeste do CSC (Bittar, 

1998), a ocorrência de possíveis eclogitos a SW do complexo (Santos, 1995)  e a 

presença de granitóides tipo I com TDM de 1,04 Ga, intrudindo-o (Kozuch, 2003), 

levam a considerar que o Complexo São Caetano ter-se-ia depositado após um 

evento de rifteamento na Zona Transversal da Província Borborema ( entre 1,4 e 

1,05 Ga). Este evento de rifteamento é também evidenciado pelos valores levemente 

negativos de ?ND (-1,84) e TDM de 1,34 Ga, encontrados em granodioritos associados 

ao Complexo Cabrobró, ao sudeste da área de estudo (Maciço Pernambuco-

Alagoas, Osako, et al., 2003) e pelos valores de ?ND entre 0,08 e 5 e idades modelo 

(TDM) entre 1,4 e 1,04 Ga, encontrados em riolitos intrudindo o CSC; estes últimos 

apresentando idades U-Pb em zircão de 967± 13 Ma (Kozuch, 2003).  

Kozuch (2003), por outro lado, identificou o evento de rifteamento acima 

citado e um posterior evento de subdução que levou à ocorrência do arco magmático 

Cariris Velhos a NW do CSC a 0,96 Ga. Evidências para esta subdução são 

fornecidas pela presença de eclogitos (Santos, 1995) e de granitóides do tipo-I de 

idade Cariris Velhos.  O modelo de Kozuch (2003), no entanto, falha ao não explicar 

o papel que o CSC, que é certamente contemporâneo ao Riacho Gravata, exerceu 

na configuração final do arco magmático Cariris Velhos.

Características litológicas da parte siliciclástica do CSC indicam, por outro 

lado, que este teria-se depositado numa margem continental e em ambiente 

pelágicos durante um período de nível do mar alto. Esta margem continental teria-se 

estabelecido ao norte do Cráton São Francisco e de suas supracrustais Meso-

Paleoproterozoicas associadas. Convergência de placas oceânica e continental, com 

subdução associada ao magmatísmo de tipo arco magmático continental (Cariris 

Velhos), teria ocorrido contemporaneamente à deposição de sua parte mais superior 

e ao fechamento da bacia oceânica onde este se depositou.  

É importante ressaltar que, baseado nos resultados obtidos neste trabalho, o 

Complexo São Caetano teria desempenhado um papel importante durante o 

fechamento de uma possível margem continental entre as rochas vulcânicas 

oceânicas do Riacho-Gravatá e as supracrustais ao leste do CSC, tendo a zona de 

cisalhamento Afogada da Ingazeira como uma Paleosutura. No entanto, levando em 

consideração que o CSC foi pouco estudado ate agora, considerações mais precisas 

sobre a paleogeografía desta área da zona transversal, entre 1,1 e 9,7 Ga, são ainda 

especulativos. Portanto estudos mais aprofundados, em especial de sua parte 

siliciclástica, devem ser levados adiante, uma vez que a melhor compreensão da 

historia geológica do Complexo São Caetano resolveria muitas questões ainda 

controvertidas. Por enquanto, a idade Meso-Neoproterozoica inferida neste estudo 

para o CSC indica que a Zona Transversal, na área de estudo, teria permanecido 

como uma margem continental a noroeste do Crato São Francisco e suas 

supracrustais, Meso e Paleoproterozóicas, entre pelo menos 1,1 Ga e 0,97 Ga.  

Por outro lado, baseados nas variações de isótopos de C nas seções de 

mármores estudadas, três estágios isotópicos foram observados (I, II, II) que são 

associados a mudanças na geoquímica da água do mar durante a sedimentação dos 

protólitos dos mármores e que teriam sido provocadas por eventos tectônicos 

globais:  

a) Estágio isotópico I, no qual valores moderadamente altos de ?13C 

(~+3,7‰PDB) resultaram de um grande soterramento e posterior seqüestro do 

carbono orgânico durante o ponto máximo do ciclo orogênico Grenvilliano, que  

levou ao empobrecimento da água do mar em 12C.  

b) Estágio isotópico II, o qual apresenta valores mais flutuantes de ?13C ( -2 a 

+3‰PDB). Esta variabilidade reflete um aumento no aporte de CO2 rico em 12C 

associado a um evento de rifteamento global há 1,05 Ga. (valores mais baixo) e o 



 

 

47

seqüestro de matéria orgânica rica em 12C através de processos de subducção 

globais, relacionados ‘a formação de arcos magmáticos há ~1,0 Ga a nível global 

(e.g Cariris Velhos).  

C) Estagio isotópico III, com valores de ?13C em torno de  3,7‰PDB refletiriam 

novamente um incremento na sedimentação e soterramento da matéria orgânica o 

qual teria sido incrementado durante a aglutinação do supercontinente Rodinia.   

A quimioestratigrafía isótopica de Sr apóia as idéias acima expostas. Valores 

de 87Sr/86Sr ~ 0,706 caracterizam o estágio isotópico I. Estes valores podem 

representar um grande aporte de material terrígeno continental empobrecido em Sr 

radiogênico (crosta rica em material juvenil) `as bacias oceânicas no final do 

Mesoproterozóico.  Os valores baixos, no entanto, podem refletir também um evento 

de rifteamento a nível global entre 1,4- 1,1 Ga. Valores de 0.705 são também 

registrados em seqüências sedimentares em Canadá e Sibéria (Kah et al., 2001, 

Bartley et al., 2001) para este período, o que apóia também a idéia de um evento de 

rifteamento.  

Valores mais variáveis de 87Sr/86Sr (0,706 a 0,707), por outro lado, 

caracterizam o estagio isotópico II e podem representar mudanças na atividade 

tectônica global. Os valores pouco radiogênicos estão associados ao processo de 

rifteamento global há 1,05 Ga e os mais radiogênicos `a geração de arcos vulcânicos 

tipo Andes a nível global há 1,0 Ga, respectivamente.   

Os valores em torno de 0.706 que caracterizam o estágio isotópico III, 

representariam a continuidade dos processos de erosão crustal associados à 

aglutinação de Rodínia e à formação de material juvenil no período 1.05-0.97 Ga.         

Finalmente, levando em consideração que a aplicação dos métodos 

quimioestratigráficos em seqüências de mármores tem sido amplamente criticada, 

devido às possíveis mudanças da assinatura isotópica durante metamorfismo, uma 

avaliação de possíveis câmbios na assinatura original dos protólitos dos mármores 

foi realizada.  Caracterizações petrográficas, geoquímicas (elementos maiores e 

menores) e isotópicas indicaram que: (1) algumas mudanças da assinatura original 

de isótopos de C ocorreram em algumas mostras de carbonatos do CSC. Estas 

mudanças foram associadas à presença de grafita; uma difusão entre CH4 rico em 
12C, derivado da grafita, e os carbonatos, é proposta como o mecanismo que gerou 

dita modificação. (2) As mudanças na assinatura isotópica de C ocorreram, 

independentemente de mudanças na composição isotópica de O e Sr, sob 



 

 

48

condições fechadas.  Isto é apoiado pela variação pequena dos isótopos de O e Sr, 

como também pela natureza inalterada dos indicadores de elementos geoquímicos 

(Sr com media de 1500 ppm, razões de Mn/Sr de 0.006 até 0.140, e razões de Rb/Sr 

entre 0 e 0.005).  (3) O processo de modificação da assinatura isotópica de C nos 

mármores teria ocorrido sob condições de metamorfismo de baixa pressão – média 

temperatura. Isto é apoiado por assembléias minerais dos mármores (calcita, 

quartzo, tremolita, moscovita, diopsidio e granada), as quais indicam temperaturas 

na faixa de 500-7000C. Um intervalo de temperatura para o metamorfismo entre 514 

e 750oC, estimada a partir de termometria de isótopos de C em grafita e calcita 

coexistentes, apóia esta idéia. 

Baseado no acima exposto e nas variações seculares dos valores de 87Sr/86Sr 

e ?13C é possível afirmar que a composição isotópica dos mármores do Complexo 

São Caetano reflete a composição isotópica dos seus protólitos sedimentares e que 

só algumas modificações nos valores de ?13C ocorreram durante o metamorfismo, 

independentemente de mudanças na sua química elementar e nos valores de 
87Sr/86Sr. Portanto a composição isotópica destes mármores representa a 

composição isotópica da água do mar durante a transição Meso-Neoproterozóico.
