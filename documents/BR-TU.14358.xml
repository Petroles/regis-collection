agradecimentos 

 
I am eternally grateful to Teresa Melo who encouraged me towards 
hydrogeology research, and has always supported my decisions with her 
valuable advises. I especially thank Lara Duro for believing on my skills and 
giving me the opportunity to work and learn countless things related to spent 
nuclear fuel and numerical modelling, with the wonderful team of Amphos 21. 
Sincere thanks are given to Jordi Bruno who gave me the opportunity to work 
at Amphos 21. I especially thank his energetic cafeeeeee’s in the morning and 
wonderful drum sessions in the garden of Amphos 21 office. 
Without the contracts made between Amphos 21 and the Japan Atomic Energy 
Agency (JAEA), and the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management 
Company (SKB) I would not be able to access the data owned by these two 
national agencies for nuclear waste management. These valuable data 
provided the motivation and inputs for all the work presented in this thesis. I 
acknowledge the two national agencies: JAEA and SKB.  
I thank all the people of Amphos 21 for their contagious dedication to the 
scientific work coupled with environmental consulting. I will never forget the 
warm smiles I received in Amphos 21 office. I thank Xavi for his friendship. I 
especially thank Ana for performing the last numerical calculations of this thesis 
with the distance between Barcelona and Coimbra.  
I am grateful to David Arcos, who advised me throughout the different stages of 
this thesis with lightening discussions and with his rigour. I sincerely 
acknowledge Fidel Grandia for his clarifying lessons on geochemical modelling, 
and especially on the interesting subject of solid solutions. Eternal thanks are 
given to Jorge Molinero, a wonderful hydrogeologist who guided me through 
the amazing world of hydrogeological modelling, and inspired me with delightful 
discussions.  
I thank Pascale her everlasting friendship and good neighbourhood. Special 
thanks are also given to Carles Ibañez, and his beautiful dancers, for the 
wonderful ballet classes that were able to drive me away from numbers and 
equations, leaving me with the pleasure of dance. 
I thank all my family who supported me, made me so strong and gave me the 
warmth of home whenever I needed. 
Finally, I thank Ilidio who faithfully awaited my return, listened to my fears, gave 
me valuable advices, and cooked so many delicious meals with the smell of 
Portugal and the Atlantic.

resumo 
 

 

Em todo o mundo são usados, hoje em dia, modelos numéricos 
hidrogeoquímicos para simular fenómenos naturais e fenómenos decorrentes 
de actividades antrópicas. Estes modelos ajudam-nos a compreender o 
ambiente envolvente, a sua variabilidade espacial e evolução temporal. 
No presente trabalho apresenta-se o desenvolvimento de modelos numéricos 
hidrogeoquímicos aplicados no contexto do repositório geológico profundo 
para resíduos nucleares de elevada actividade. 
A avaliação da performance de um repositório geológico profundo inclui o 
estudo da evolução geoquímica do repositório, bem como a análise dos 
cenários de mau funcionamento do repositório, e respectivas consequências 
ambientais. 
Se se escaparem acidentalmente radionuclídeos de um repositório, estes 
poderão atravessar as barreiras de engenharia e barreiras naturais que 
constituem o repositório, atingindo eventualmente, os ecosistemas superficiais. 
Neste caso, os sedimentos subsuperficiais constituem a última barreira natural 
antes dos ecosistemas superficiais. 
No presente trabalho foram desenvolvidos modelos numéricos que integram 
processos biogeoquímicos, geoquímicos, hidrodinâmicos e de transporte de 
solutos, para entender e quantificar a influência destes processos na 
mobilidade de radionuclídeos em sistemas subsuperficiais. 
Os resultados alcançados reflectem a robustez dos instrumentos numéricos 
utilizados para desenvolver simulações descritivas e predictivas de processos 
hidrogeoquímicos que influenciam a mobilidade de radionuclídeos. 
A simulação (descritiva) de uma experiência laboratorial revela que a 
actividade microbiana induz a diminuição do potencial redox da água 
subterrânea que, por sua vez, favorece a retenção de radionuclídeos sensíveis 
ao potencial redox, como o urânio. 
As simulações predictivas indicam que processos de co-precipitação com 
minerais de elementos maioritários, precipitação de fases puras, intercâmbio 
catiónico e adsorção à superfície de minerais favorecem a retenção de U, Cs, 
Sr e Ra na fase sólida de uma argila glaciar e uma moreia rica em calcite. 
A etiquetagem dos radionuclídeos nas simulações numéricas permitiu concluir 
que a diluição isotópica joga um papel importante no potencial impacte dos 
radionuclídeos nos sistemas subsuperficiais. 
A partir dos resultados das simulações numéricas é possivel calcular 
coeficientes de distribuição efectivos. Esta metodologia proporciona a 
simulação de ensaios de traçadores de longa duração que não seriam 
exequíveis à escala da vida humana. A partir destas simulações podem ser 
obtidos coeficientes de retardamento que são úteis no contexto da avaliação 
da performance de repositórios geológicos profundos.

abstract 

 
Hydrogeochemical numerical modelling is worldwide used to simulate natural 
and anthropogenically induced phenomena. These simulations help us to 
understand the surrounding environment; its spatial variability and temporal 
evolution. 
In the present work, hydrogeochemical numerical models are developed in the 
context of the deep geological repository for high level nuclear waste (HLNW). 
Performance assessment of a deep geological repository includes the study of 
its geochemical evolution, as well as the analysis of failure scenarios of the 
repository and their environmental consequences. 
If a repository release takes place, radionuclides from the HLNW could migrate 
through the surrounding engineered and natural barriers and eventually reach 
the surface ecosystems. In this case, near-surface sediments constitute the last 
natural barrier between the repository and the surface ecosystems. 
In this study biogeochemical, geochemical, hydrodynamic and solute transport 
processes are coupled in different numerical models to understand and 
quantify the influence of these processes on radionuclide mobility in near-
surface systems. 
The results attained here prove the robustness of such numerical tools to 
develop both descriptive and predictive simulations of hydrogeochemical 
processes that affect radionuclide mobility. 
The (descriptive) simulation of a jar-fermentor experiment reveals that microbial 
activity tends to decrease the redox state of groundwater which favours the 
retention of redox sensitive radionuclides such as uranium. 
Predictive simulations reveal that co-precipitation with major element phases, 
precipitation of pure phases, cation exchange and adsorption on charged 
mineral surfaces provide the retention of uranium, caesium, strontium and 
radium in the solid phase of a glacial clay and a calcite-rich till deposit. 
Labelling of radionuclides in the numerical simulations shows that isotopic 
dilution also plays an important role in the potential impact of radionuclides in 
the near-surface systems. 
Finally, effective distribution coefficients can be calculated from the outputs of 
previous reactive solute transport simulations. This methodology provides the 
simulation of synthetic tracer tests with long time spans that would not be 
feasible at the human life scale. The outputs of these synthetic tracer tests 
provide the estimation of effective retardation factors that may be useful for 
performance assessment of deep geological repositories.

“The time scale of development of man, and the similar time scale indicated by the decay 

of radionuclides in waste, appears unimportant compared with cosmic evolution. Even 

more striking is the perspective of universal space and the distribution of matter in it. We 

live in a tiny speck of a planet, and have only a narrow knowledge of a thin layer of this 

planet earth. But from this perspective we learn that the masses of matter within our reach 

are tremendous. This makes us feel humble and at the same time it inspires confidence 

that our waste problems can find quite natural solutions – if we are ready to make use of 

our talents.”

1. Introduction 

 

1.1 Motivation 

Hydrogeochemical numerical modelling is worldwide used to simulate natural and 

anthropogenically induced phenomena. These simulations help us to understand the 

surrounding environment; its spatial variability and temporal evolution. Dealing with 

evolving systems requires understanding the past which, in turn, sustains predictions 

about the future. 

During the last decades, management and disposal of high level nuclear waste (HLNW) 

have been motivating an increasing number of scientific research projects where 

hydrogeochemical numerical modelling plays an important role. The present work is in 

close relation to two national programmes dedicated to the final disposal of HLNW: the 

national programme hosted by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) and the national 

programme hosted by the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company 

(SKB). Both programmes consider the deep geological repository as the solution for the 

final disposal of HLNW. 

According to international agreements, the nuclear waste must not burden future 

generations. HLNW has to be managed responsibly to ensure public safety, protection of 

the environment, and security from malicious intervention now and in the future (OECD, 

1999). Since HLNW is partially composed of long-lived radionuclides its final disposal 

must guarantee safety and isolation for at least 100,000 years after repository closure 

(SKB, 2006). The deep geological repository is the most widely accepted solution among 

countries with nuclear power plants (Brookins, 1987; Cécille, 1991).  

According to the Swedish (and also Finish) concept, a deep geological repository consists 

of deposition holes excavated at a depth of approximately 500 m where HLNW is stored. 

The packages of HLNW are surrounded by several engineered barriers which may vary 

from country to country. Some of these engineered barriers include metal canisters, clay 

barriers and cement liners. The host rock and the overlying surface sediments represent 

the natural barriers of a deep geological repository. 

The chemical and physical properties of the HLNW show some differences from country 

to country. In Sweden, HLNW is the spent nuclear fuel that is no longer energetically 

efficient to keep being used in nuclear power plants. It is a ceramic material composed of 

uranium dioxide that is very stable under the conditions of the repository (i.e. under the pH 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

2 

and redox conditions of groundwater at repository depths). On the other hand, in Japan, 

HLNW is a non-profitable product of the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel to recover 

uranium and plutonium. In Japan, the HLNW is vitrified in borosilicate glass to ensure its 

physico-chemical stability. 

When dealing with the final disposal of HLNW, the potential migration of radionuclides 

through the engineered and natural barriers that surround the repository must be 

assessed. In performance assessment of deep geological repositories, failure scenarios of 

the repository and their environmental consequences are being analysed (e.g. SKB, 

2006). In case of repository release, the surface sediments overlying the repository host 

rock represent the last geological barrier prior to the surface ecosystems.  

In the framework of performance assessment, the geochemical long-term evolution of a 

deep geological repository is usually assessed by using hydrogeochemical numerical 

simulations which couple laboratory and field data for the long time spans needed to be 

considered when dealing with HLNW. 

The present work is focused on the hydrodynamic and geochemical processes that prevail 

in the near-surface systems overlying a potential host rock which influence radionuclide 

mobility (Figure 1.1).

1.2 Scope 

This thesis is composed of four main chapters presenting different examples of 

hydrogeochemical simulations developed to assess radionuclide mobility in near-surface 

systems that overly a potential host rock for a deep geological repository. The numerical 

models developed are focused on a laboratory-scale problem (Chapter 2) and two-

dimensional field-scale problems (Chapters 3 to 5). Besides the four main chapters, two 

other chapters provide the introduction to (Chapter 1) and the general conclusions of 

(Chapter 6) the whole research work. 

In Chapter 1, the motivation, scope, methodology, state-of-the-art and main objectives of 

the research work are presented. In Chapter 2 an aquatic system with no transport of 

solutes is simulated. The concentration of solutes is considered to vary over time due to 

geochemical and biochemical reactions. In Chapters 3 to 5, two-dimensional groundwater 

systems where water flows and transports solutes that may react with the solid matrix of 

the porous media are developed. 

Concerning the master variables time and space, two main types of hydrogeochemical 

problems may be found: 

• Hydrogeochemical problems where water flow and solute transport are negligible; 

i.e. the concentration of chemical species does not vary in space. In this type of 

problems, the concentration of solutes varies over time due to heterogeneous and 

homogeneous chemical reactions (heterogeneous meaning those reactions that 

take place between aqueous, solid, and gaseous phases, while homogeneous 

reactions take place within a single phase; e.g. aqueous complexation). In 

addition, these chemical reactions can occur under local thermodynamic 

equilibrium or under kinetics. Chapter 2 presents the development of a numerical 

model of this type of problem. 

• Reactive transport problems where the concentration of solutes varies over time 

and space due to groundwater flow which transports dissolved species that may 

react with solid (minerals, organic matter, etc.) and gaseous components (e.g. 

O2(g)). Chapters 3 to 5 present examples for the development of numerical models 

of this type of problem. 

 

In Figure 1.2, the main (bio)geochemical reactions that are believed to occur in an aquatic 

system such as the jar-fermentor experiment that was studied in Chapter 2 are illustrated. 

In the aqueous phase, solutes may be complexed with other species, or undergo redox 

and acid-base reactions. When organic matter is available, microbial respiration is able to

trigger redox reactions involving inorganic (O2, NO3

, Fe

, SO4

2-
) and organic solutes 

(dissolved organic matter such as lactate, propionate and acetate). In addition, elements 

like carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen can be removed from solution and 

incorporated into biomass cells (biomass growth), or they can be released into solution 

due to biomass decay. Finally, solutes may be transferred to other phases (gas and solid) 

due to the different heterogeneous geochemical reactions that are shown in Figure 1.2.

homogeneous reactions are illustrated. The yellow arrows illustrate the possible fluxes of 

chemical species between the different phases: gas, aqueous, solid, and biomass (green 

symbol). 

 

In a hydrogeochemical problem, such as the one developed in Chapter 2, two main 

equations must be solved to describe the changes in the concentration of chemical 

species due to local thermodynamic equilibrium reactions (equation 1.1) and kinetic 

reactions (equation 1.2). The general equation describing local thermodynamic equilibrium 

reactions is (e.g. Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999):

where K is the equilibrium constant, a is the activity, ?r and ?p are the stoichiometric 

coefficients of the reactants and products of a given chemical reaction, respectively. 



I. Introduction

Activities of the aqueous species are related to molalities through activity coefficients 

which may be calculated using different expressions, such as the Debye-Hückel equation. 

In equation 1.1 there is no integration in time for the concentration of a species, since 

local equilibrium reactions do not depend on the master variable time. Therefore, for the 

concentration of a given chemical species to vary in time, under local equilibrium, some 

external source/sink term must occur to induce the change in concentration. This external 

source/sink term can be the addition of a new substance (mineral, gas or a different 

solution) which is not in equilibrium with the original solution or the presence of mineral 

phases of which dissolution/precipitation is kinetically driven. 

Besides local thermodynamic equilibrium, the kinetic chemical reactions can be described 

by the following general equation (e.g. Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999):

??                                                                                               (equation 1.2) 

 

 where mi is the molality of species i, t is time, ?I,k is the stoichiometric coefficient of 

species i in the kinetic reaction for substance k, and Rk is the overall reaction rate for 

substance k. 

The reactive transport models developed in Chapters 3 to 5 rely on the continuum 

hypothesis, where a real groundwater system is approximated by using partial differential 

equations that describe the variations of mass (of water and chemical species) over time 

and space. In the continuum representation of the porous medium, the physico-chemical 

variables describing the system, such as porosity, hydraulic conductivity, mineral 

concentration, etc., are averaged over a representative elemental volume (REV; Bear, 

1972, Figure 1.3). In the REV, each variable assumes a single value for each time step. 

If we consider the mass balance for groundwater flow in a saturated porous medium, the 

net flux J shown in Figure 1.3 represents Darcy’s velocity, and the corresponding mass 

balance for a three-dimensional groundwater flow can be expressed by the following 

equation:

equation: (Jx + Jy + Jz) – (Jx+?x + Jy+?y + Jz+?z) = ?S. 

 

If we consider the mass balance for a conservative solute in a hydrodynamic system, 

then, the net flux J in Figure 1.3 represents the sum of the advective, dispersive and 

diffusive fluxes. In addition, if we consider the mass balance for a reactive solute, we must 

add a source/ sink term that represents the addition or removal of the reactive solute to or 

from solution, due to chemical reactions between this solute and the solid matrix of the 

porous medium. 

The overall equation describing the mass balance for a reactive solute in a saturated 

porous medium is:

due to chemical reactions, given in units of [ML
-3

]. If w is null, then the corresponding 

solute is considered a conservative solute, which does not react with the solid matrix of 

the porous medium. 

If the source/ sink term w is calculated using equations 1.1 and 1.2, that describe 

equilibrium and kinetic chemical reactions, the numerical model is considered a reactive 

transport model. On the other hand, if the source/ sink term w is calculated by using a 

distribution coefficient (Kd) which defines the ratio between the concentration of a solute 

in solid and aqueous phases, then the model is considered a Kd-based model. 

The numerical models developed in Chapters 3 and 4 are reactive solute transport models 

where water flow and transport of dissolved species are coupled with geochemical 

reactions between solid and aqueous phases. In Chapter 3, a diffusion dominated porous 

media that represents a glacial clay sediment is modelled, while in Chapter 4 an advection 

dominated porous media, represented by a till deposit that hosts unconfined aquifers, is 

developed. 

Chapter 5 presents a methodology for estimating effective Kd’s from the outputs of the 

reactive transport numerical simulations developed in Chapter 4. The meaning and 

applicability of these Kd values estimated from reactive solute transport simulations are 

discussed and validated in Chapter 5. 

The work presented in Chapter 2 has been developed in the framework of JAEA 

programme for the management of HLNW, and has been presented as a poster at the 

19
th
 V.M. Goldschmidt™ conference. 

The work presented in Chapters 3 to 5 has been developed in the framework of SKB Site 

Characterization Programme for Sweden’s deep geological repository. This work resulted 

in two technical reports published by SKB which are available for download at 

www.skb.se. The two publications are: Grandia et al. (2007) and Sena et al. (2008). 

Chapter 6 summarizes the work presented in the preceding chapters, integrates the main 

conclusions attained in each chapter, and presents the final discussions related to some 

unsolved problems and future works.

1.3 Methodology 

The development of any numerical model relies on the definition of a sound conceptual 

model which couples the data available for the system under study with information on 

other similar systems, as well as information gathered from laboratory experiments. The 

conceptual model identifies the features, events and processes that describe the system 

under study, and also the limits of the system. The conservation of mass and energy 

must, therefore, be fulfilled within the limits of the conceptual model. The conceptual 

model reflects the information gathered to describe the system under study and also the 

interpretations and assumptions which, in turn, are based on the observations and 

measurements of the system and on the information obtained on other similar systems. 

After building a sound and reliable conceptual model, the numerical model is built based 

on the data, interpretations and assumptions that describe the conceptual model, but with 

the limitations associated to the capabilities of the codes and of process understanding 

and parameterization. Calibration of the numerical model represents the step where the 

conceptual model is validated and questioned. This procedure has been adopted in all the 

numerical models developed in the present work. 

In Chapter 2 a numerical model that simulates microbially mediated redox processes in 

lake sediments is developed using PHREEQC (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999). This 

numerical model simulates a jar-fermentor experiment that was conducted by JAEA to 

assess the role of microbial activity in aquatic subsurface systems. During this experiment 

lake water and sediment samples were mixed and oxidized by atmosphere bubbling 

during 5 days. Then, an organic electron donor substance (lactate) was added to the jar-

fermentor which was kept in closed conditions for additional 13 days. During the 

experiment the main geochemical parameters and bacterial flora were analyzed 

(Nakajima et al., 2008). 

In this modelling exercise, Monod kinetic equations have been implemented to simulate 

microbially mediated reactions. In addition, abiotic, kinetic and equilibrium, geochemical 

reactions have also been considered. The numerical model developed is intended to 

simulate the observed consumption of organic electron donors (lactate, acetate and 

propionate) and inorganic electron acceptors (O2, NO3
-
, Fe

3+
 and SO4

2-
), as well as their 

effect on the master variables pH and Eh. 

From all the biogeochemical parameters that were implemented in the numerical model 

developed in Chapter 2, the Monod kinetic parameters are subject to a relatively high 

degree of uncertainty. Therefore, the calibration of the numerical model developed in 

Chapter 2 relies on that combination of the Monod kinetic parameters which leads to the 



I. Introduction 

9 

best agreement between measured and simulated values of the different organic and 

inorganic geochemical variables. 

Simulation of microbially mediated kinetic reactions follows the so called partial 

equilibrium approach in which the oxidation of organic matter is considered to be the rate 

limiting process, and the geochemical system is led to respond under local equilibrium by 

reducing the most thermodynamically favourable electron acceptor (EA). In addition, 

inhibition terms have been used to describe mathematically the sequential use of EA’s 

(Barry et al., 2002, and references therein). 

Chapters 3 and 4 encompass a modelling procedure using PHREEQC (Parkhurst and 

Appelo, 1999) and PHAST (Parkhurst et al., 2004) to predict radionuclide retention in two 

distinct near-surface sediments present at Forsmark (Sweden). Forsmark is the candidate 

site that has been selected in June 2009 for the location of a deep geological repository in 

Sweden. In order to assess radionuclide retention in the near-surface systems at 

Forsmark four radionuclides (
235

U, 
135

Cs, 
226

Ra and 
90

Sr) have been selected according to 

their different geochemical behaviour and potential dose relevance to surface 

ecosystems. 

The sediment modelled in Chapter 3 is a glacial clay located between surface water 

bodies and the shallow unconfined aquifers hosted by till deposits, while in Chapter 4 the 

calcite-rich Quaternary till that overlies the granite candidate host rock is modelled. 

Prediction of radionuclide retention in both Quaternary sediments relies on a hypothetical 

scenario of repository release where deep groundwater flowing through a fracture in the 

granite candidate host rock is considered to transport dissolved radionuclides from the 

repository to the near-surface systems (Figure 1.4). 

The main steps of the modelling procedure applied in Chapters 3 and 4 include: 

1) the detailed analysis of SKB’s hydrogeochemical database for the near-surface 

systems at Forsmark; 

2) the development of the conceptual model of each modelled system based on data 

gathered in the first step and on the comparison of the systems under study with 

similar systems; 

3) the thorough review of the thermodynamic parameters required for the simulation 

of geochemical processes; 

4) the implementation of the conceptual model in reactive transport numerical 

simulations; 

5) the simulation of the present-day hydrogeochemical conditions observed at 

Forsmark, by developing a long-term reactive transport simulation;

6) the simulation of a hypothetical repository release in the numerical model; and, 

7) the quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in the modelled systems 

based on the outputs of the numerical simulations.

showing a hypothetical path for radionuclides potentially released from the repository. The 

near-surface systems that have been modelled in Chapters 3 and 4 (glacial clay and till) are 

highlighted with a red rectangle.  

 

After analysing SKB’s hydrogeochemical database for the Forsmark site, (1) the glacial-

clay porewater; (2) the shallow groundwater of the till deposit; and, (3) the deep granitic 

groundwater have been selected as the most representative near-surface waters for the 

simulations. The selection of the reactive minerals considered in the numerical models of 

the glacial clay and till sediments relies on three main premises: (1) which are the 



I. Introduction 

11 

minerals present in the system under consideration?; (2) which are the minerals that 

control pH and Eh in each Quaternary sediment?; and, (3) which are the minerals that 

may affect the mobility of the selected radionuclides? Unfortunately, in some cases the 

information on the minerals present in the system is not always available or it is 

incomplete. In these cases, the selection of the reactive minerals must be based on the 

knowledge on this type of systems coupled with the analysis of the geochemical data 

available for the system under study. 

In natural aquatic systems, the most common geochemical reactions that radionuclides 

may undergo are: 

1) Cation exchange in clay minerals. Cation exchange is the replacement of a cation 

initially adsorbed in the interlayer of a clay mineral by another cation present in 

groundwater (Appelo and Postma, 2005; Stumm and Morgan, 1996). 

2) Adsorption on charged surfaces of minerals such as oxyhydroxides or clays. 

Adsorption is the adherence of an ion on the charged surface of a mineral. The 

charge of a given mineral may vary from negatively charged to positively charged, 

passing through a non-charged surface which is called the point of zero charge, 

depending on the pH conditions of groundwater (Dzombak and Morel, 1990; 

Stumm and Morgan, 1996). 

3) Sorption onto organic tissues. As on charged mineral phases, ions can also 

adsorb on the charged surfaces of organic tissues (Appelo and Postma, 2005; and 

references therein). 

4) Co-precipitation with major element solid phases such as sulphates, sulphides, 

oxyhydroxides and carbonates. Co-precipitation is the formation of solid solutions 

between two or more solid phases. Solid solutions are, therefore, minerals with 

variable compositions of pure end-member minerals (Glynn and Reardon, 1990; 

and references therein). 

5) Aqueous complexation with organic and inorganic ligands such as humic acids 

and aqueous carbonates. Aqueous complexation depends greatly on the pH and 

redox state of groundwater. In addition, by complexing with aqueous species, the 

precipitation of solid phases that incorporate radionuclides may be hindered. 

6) Precipitation of pure phases. In some cases, and despite the relatively low 

concentrations of radionuclides, precipitation of pure phases such as amorphous 

uraninite can be relevant. 

 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

12 

In the numerical simulations developed in Chapters 3 and 4, radionuclides potentially 

released by the repository were labelled to trace and distinguish them from natural 

occurring isotopes in the numerical simulations (
RD

Sr, 
RD

Cs and 
RD

U, where RD stands for 

Repository-Derived). Radium was not labelled since it was considered to be below 

detection limit in the porewater of the studied Quaternary deposits, before repository 

release. 

Labelling of repository-derived radionuclides involved the addition of the labelled species 

as primary species to the thermodynamic database used in the numerical simulations. 

The secondary aqueous species for labelled radionuclides had to be added by duplicating 

the reactions for non-labelled isotopes and replacing the isotope with the labelled 

radionuclide. In order to consider the incorporation of both repository-derived 

radionuclides and naturally occurring isotopes in the same solid phase, without causing an 

artificial isotopic fractionation, new ideal solid solutions involving both species had also to 

be added to the thermodynamic database. 

The numerical results attained in Chapters 3 and 4 have proven that the labelling 

procedure has been done correctly, and no artificial isotopic fractionation has been 

introduced. Actually, in Chapter 5, the Kd values calculated from the outputs of the 

numerical simulations developed in Chapter 4 are the same for each isotope (labelled and 

unlabelled species) of a given element which reflects the inexistence of an unintended 

fractionation process. 

Radionuclide retention in the Quaternary sediments was quantitatively assessed from the 

outputs of the numerical simulations developed in Chapters 3 and 4. This modelling 

procedure has proven to be a robust methodology for such quantitative assessment. 

The work presented in Chapters 2 to 4 entails numerical models that account for 

biochemical (Chapter 2) and geochemical (Chapters 2, 3 and 4) processes influencing 

solute mobility. This type of models is usually assigned to the so called “component 

additivity” (CA) approach, i.e. these models assume that each mineral in a complex 

mineral assemblage has unique thermodynamic properties, where the important linkage 

between solid and aqueous species is retained through the coupling of mass action 

equations (Davis et al. 1998, and references therein). This approach is much more 

complex and computational demanding than a constant Kd approach, but it is much more 

reliable when dealing with complex near-surface systems like the ones modelled here. 

Near-surface systems are affected by changes in key geochemical parameters (pH, Eh, 

ionic strength) which strongly influence the Kd value. In addition, if a given mineral 

precipitates or dissolves, a Kd-based model is not able to account for the increase or 



I. Introduction 

13 

decrease of the solid pool that retains a reactive solute. Nevertheless, for the time being, 

Kd-based models are still considered to be a very useful tool to simulate groundwater 

systems with large dimensions and extremely complex flow conditions, as the fractured 

kilometric volumes of a candidate host rock for a deep geological repository. In addition, 

hydrogeochemical models depend on reliable site specific data and thermodynamic 

parameters which may be difficult to get or eventually have not been developed yet. 

A Kd-based model does not depend on thermodynamic data, and site specific data may 

be more generic than for the component additivity type of models. In this context, Kd-

based models can be used for the preliminary and more general assessments of a given 

problem. In this context, in Chapter 5, effective Kd values have been estimated from the 

outputs of the reactive transport numerical model developed in Chapter 4. The meaning 

and validity of these Kd values has been assessed and discussed in Chapter 5 by 

developing Kd-based transport models using FEFLOW (Diersch, 2005). 

 

1.4 State-of-the-art 

1.4.1 Kd-based models versus reactive transport models 

When a modeller selects a code for solving groundwater flow coupled with reactive solute 

transport two main approaches may be found. On one hand, there are codes that solve 

groundwater flow coupled with a set of non-linear equations that describe the geochemical 

reactions between reactive solutes and the solid phase (also called the component 

additivity approach, Davis et al., 1998); and, on the other hand there are models based on 

effective distribution coefficients (Kd) or retardation factors (R) that integrate the retention 

provided by the overall geochemical reactions that affect the transport of a reactive solute 

(also called generalized composite approach, Davis et al., 1998). 

In 1981, Reardon discussed the reliability of Kd-based models to describe reversible ion 

sorption reactions in contaminant migration. The author concluded that if the groundwater 

system is in a steady state chemical evolution a Kd-based model should be as reliable as 

a reactive transport model. At chemical steady state, the sorbing sites at any point in the 

flow path are in equilibrium with the way in which groundwater is evolving chemically and 

therefore the Kd of a given location should be constant over time. Based on these results, 

Glynn (2003) performed 1D geochemical transport simulations to demonstrate the effects 

of aqueous speciation and sorption reactions on the transport of neptunium and 

plutonium. The author concluded that a Kd-based model would lead to remarkably

14 

different results from those attained in the previous geochemical transport simulations, 

pointing out the care that must be taken when choosing the type of model to be used in 

performance assessment of nuclear waste-disposal sites.  

Over the past decades a considerable amount of computer codes that solve groundwater 

flow coupled with multicomponent reactive solute transport has emerged which reflects on 

one hand the increasing need for using these tools and on the other hand the fast 

increase of computer computational capacity. Allied to the advances on computing 

techniques, improved scientific understanding, experimental and site specific data, 

together with improved numerical models have provided representations of the potential 

behaviour of geological disposal systems which increase confidence on performance 

assessment programmes (OECD, 1999). 

It is not intended to provide here a thorough review of computer codes that solve 

hydrogeochemical problems (the reader is referred to Brun and Engesgaard, 2002, for a 

review on biogeochemical modelling; MacQuarrie and Mayer, 2005, for a review on 

reactive transport in fractured rock; and, Gaucher and Blanc, 2006, for a review on 

modelling cement/clay interactions), but since some of these codes have been extensively 

used in the work developed in this thesis, a brief review of some of the most important 

codes is provided, some of which have been developed and/or often used in the context 

of deep geological repositories for HLNW: 

1) PHREEQC (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999) is a well known geochemical code based 

on an ion-association aqueous model that solves speciation and saturation-index 

calculations; batch-reaction and one-dimensional (1D) transport calculations 

involving a wide variety of reversible equilibrium and kinetic geochemical 

reactions, as well as inverse modelling; 

2) PHAST (Parkhurst et al., 2004) is a finite-difference code that simulates multi-

component, reactive solute transport in three-dimensional (3D) saturated 

groundwater flow systems. The geochemical code PHREEQC is embedded in 

PHAST. 

3) RETRASO (Saaltink et al., 1997) is a finite-element code that solves two-

dimensional (2D) reactive solute transport in saturated media. 

4) CORE
2D

 (Samper et al., 2000) is a finite element code for solving 2D groundwater 

flow, heat transfer and multicomponent reactive solute transport in partially or fully 

saturated media. 



I. Introduction 

15 

5) TOUGHREACT (Xu et al., 2008) is a finite-element code that solves 3D non-

isothermal multi-component reactive solute transport, multi-phase fluid and heat 

flow.  

6) CrunchFlow (Steefel, 2008) is a finite volume code currently restricted to 

orthogonal grids. 

 

The work presented in this thesis provides examples of hydrogeochemical models that 

have been developed using PHREEQC and PHAST to solve different problems 

concerning the processes affecting the mobility of radionuclides in the near-surface 

systems that overly potential host rocks for a deep geological repository. 

Feflow (Diersch, 2005) was used in Chapter 5 to test the meaning of the Kd values 

estimated from the outputs of the reactive transport model developed in Chapter 4. Feflow 

is a finite difference code that simulates groundwater flow under non-isothermal and 

variably saturated conditions, and transport of conservative and reactive solutes. 

Transport of reactive solutes is simulated by using the Kd approach (Diersch, 2005). 

PHREEQC version 2 is a numerical code that simulates a wide variety of low-temperature 

aqueous geochemical calculations. It is based on an ion-association aqueous model and 

has capabilities for (1) speciation and saturation-index calculations; (2) batch-reaction and 

1D transport calculations involving reversible reactions, which include aqueous, mineral, 

gas, solid-solution, surface-complexation, and ion-exchange equilibria, and irreversible 

reactions such as kinetically controlled reactions, mixing of solutions, and temperature 

changes; and (3) inverse modelling, which finds sets of mineral and gas mole transfers 

that account for differences in composition between waters, within specified compositional 

uncertainty limits. The equations solved by PHREEQC for the chemical equilibrium and 

kinetic reactions are non-linear algebraic equations (NLAE’s) describing equilibrium 

chemical reactions, and ordinary differential equations (ODE’s) describing rates of kinetic 

chemical reactions (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999). 

PHAST is a multi-component, reactive solute transport code for up to 3D saturated 

groundwater flow systems, with capabilities to model a wide range of equilibrium and 

kinetic geochemical reactions. The flow and transport calculations are based on a 

modified version of HST3D (Kipp, 1987) that is restricted to constant fluid density and 

constant temperature. The geochemical reactions are simulated with the geochemical 

code PHREEQC, which is embedded in PHAST (Parkhurst et al., 2004). 

The governing equations solved by PHAST are a set of (1) partial differential equations 

(PDE’s) describing groundwater flow and solute transport for each aqueous component; 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

16 

(2) NLAE’s describing equilibrium chemical reactions; and, (3) ODE’s describing rates of 

kinetic chemical reactions (Parkhurst et al., 2004). 

In PHAST, an operator splitting of the (i) flow, (ii) transport, and (iii) geochemical 

equations is used to separate the three processes into three sequential calculations. No 

iterations between transport and reaction calculations are implemented. A three-

dimensional Cartesian coordinate system and finite-difference techniques are used for the 

spatial and temporal discretization of the flow and transport PDE’s. The NLAE’s that 

describe the local equilibrium chemical reactions are solved by a Newton-Raphson 

method, and the kinetic reaction ODE’s are solved by a Runge-Kutta or an implicit method 

for integrating ODE’s (Parkhurst et al., 2004). 

A multicomponent reactive transport code, such as PHAST, solves the following 

equations: 

• Equations (1.1 and 1.2) for heterogeneous equilibrium and kinetic reactions; 

• Flow equation (1.3) which combines the Darcy’s law and the mass balance 

equation; 

• Solute transport equation (1.4) 

 

After establishing the hydrodynamic and geochemical initial conditions, the sequence of 

calculations performed by PHAST includes three steps (Parkhurst et al., 2004): 

1. The flow equation is solved for the hydraulic head values, and these are 

used for calculating the water velocity that is used in the solute transport 

equation. 

2. The solute transport equation is calculated for each primary aqueous 

species. 

3. The equations for equilibrium and kinetic reactions are solved. 

 

In 1996, Lichtner et al. mentioned the inevitable reliance of the performance assessment 

of a deep geological repository on reactive transport numerical models. Without these 

tools quantitative assessment of the long-term performance of a deep geological 

repository would be very difficult or even impossible due to the large amount of non-linear 

equations and long time spans needed to be solved when dealing with a HLNW 

repository. This is why today we find in the scientific literature a considerable amount of 

work dealing with hydrogeochemical numerical models applied in the context of the deep 

geological repository. 



I. Introduction 

17 

In the SKB programme that supports the decision making process for sitting the first deep 

geological repository in Sweden one may find a considerable amount of technical reports 

dealing with hydrogeochemical modelling (these reports may be downloaded from the 

website http://www.skb.se). From this programme, many scientific articles have also been 

published (the reader is referred to the special issue, volume 23, issue 7 of Applied 

Geochemistry, published in 2008, and the special issue volume 35, issue 8 of Ambio 

Journal, published in 2006).  

 

1.4.2 Hydrogeochemical models in the context of the HLNW management 

Different types of reactive transport models have been developed in the past decades in 

the context of the HLNW management. These include numerical models that simulate: 

1. the dissolution of the spent nuclear fuel and subsequent release of radionuclides 

into the aqueous phase (Bruno et al., 2004; Duro et al., 2006; Haschkea and 

Oversby , 2002; Johnson et al., 2005; Macedo et al., 1982; Nielsen, 2007) 

2. the processes occurring at the near-field of a repository, i.e. the vicinity of the 

copper canisters that contain the spent nuclear fuel (Arcos et al., 2008; Jolley et 

al., 2003; Ochs et al., 2003; Puranen et al., 2009; Samper et al., 2008; Yamaguchi 

et al., 2008) 

3. the processes occurring at the far-field, i.e. the host rock of the repository and the 

more recent sediments that overly the host rock (Molinero et al., 2008; Robinson et 

al., 2003; Sullivan et al., 2003; Thorne et al 2000; Turner and Pabalan, 1999) 

 

Concerning the dissolution of the spent nuclear fuel, Bruno et al. (2004) developed an 

overview of the conceptual models that describe radioactive waste/water interactions with 

special emphasis on UO2-rich spent nuclear fuel. By combining thorough laboratory 

studies, comprehensive geochemical modelling and its application to natural analogue 

studies, these authors have provided confidence on the predictions for the repository 

performance. In 2006, Duro et al. evaluated the concentration limits of the radionuclides in 

the near field for different scenarios and calculated their solubility limits; i.e. the maximum 

concentration expected for the radionuclides taking into account the most favourable 

mineral phases that can precipitate and retain radionuclides in the solid phase. Nielsen 

(2007) developed mathematical models to simulate the dissolution of spent nuclear fuel 

after a hypothetical damage of the canister. These simulations showed that a steady-state 

concentration of H2O2 (an important oxidant resulting from water radiolysis due to 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

18 

emission of alpha, beta and gamma radiation from the radioactive decay) is reached at 

the fuel surface in a very short time. 

In 2008, Arcos et al. developed 3D numerical models to assess the long-term 

hydrogeochemical evolution of the near-field in evolving geochemical environments due to 

climate change. These numerical models gather information from underground laboratory 

experiments and natural analogues. The numerical results indicate that the most 

significant changes in the evolution of the near-field system could occur when highly 

diluted and alkaline ice-melting water enters into the system. 

Natural analogues are natural systems with special characteristics that resemble those 

expected for a deep geological repository, and therefore, they have been object of many 

studies for the performance assessment of these repositories (Miller et al., 1994; Miller et 

al., 2000; Miller et al., 2006, among others). In 1990, Nordstrom et al. performed 

geochemical simulations of water-rock interactions at the Poços de Caldas natural 

analogue using groundwater compositions, mineralogical data, speciation and mass 

balance calculations. The models developed were able to reproduce water chemistry and 

mineral occurrences. The dominant hydrogeochemical processes occurring at the Poços 

de Caldas site were also identified. This work provided testing thermodynamic equilibrium 

codes and their associated databases. Afterwards, in 1991, Bruno et al. performed “blind” 

predictive geochemical models for the speciation and solubility limiting phases of a 

number of trace elements of Poços de Caldas natural analogue to test geochemical 

models used in repository performance assessments. One of the major findings of this 

study was that neglecting processes such as co-precipitation of radionuclides with major 

ion phases, which were not included in the models due to the lack of appropriate data, led 

to conservative (pessimistic) results by overestimating radionuclide concentration. 

From the beginning of 1990’s until the present, new thermodynamic and kinetic data, as 

well as improved understanding of specific geochemical processes (e.g. biochemical 

processes) has been achieved which enables the construction of more sound and reliable 

reactive transport models. 

In 2004, Salas and Ayora modelled the groundwater system at one of the natural 

analogues of the Oklo uranium deposit to improve the understanding of the observed site 

geochemistry. The methodology adopted in this work was useful to prove the reliability of 

the conceptual and numerical models developed to describe the complex behaviour of the 

natural analogue at the Okélobondo uraninite deposit. 

Besides predictive models of the repository system and natural analogue models, 

descriptive models of the candidate sites are important tools providing confidence on the 



I. Introduction 

19 

numerical tools used, assumptions made and conceptual models defined for the 

candidate sites. Molinero et al. (2008) developed a coupled regional groundwater flow and 

reactive solute transport model of the Simpevarp area (one of the two candidate sites that 

were under consideration by SKB). By providing a qualitative framework for data analysis 

and testing of conceptual assumptions in a process-oriented approach, the results of this 

work have demonstrated how powerful the numerical tools are for the interpretation of 

hydrogeochemical data of candidate host rocks. 

 

1.4.3 Modelling microbially mediated redox reactions in the context of the 

deep geological repository 

Modelling microbially mediated geochemical reactions in the context of deep geological 

repositories is not as widespread as modelling abiotic geochemical reactions. 

Nevertheless, many geochemical reactions have long been identified to be mediated by 

microbes (e.g. Chapelle, 1993; Lovley et al., 1991). Hydrogeochemical models accounting 

for microbially mediated geochemical reactions are much more abundant in the field of 

subsurface groundwater modelling (e.g. Hunter et al., 1998), landfill plumes (e.g. Brun et 

al., 2002; Christensen et al., 2000) and degradation of organic contaminants such as 

chlorinated hydrocarbons, phenol and benzene (Mayer et al., 2001; Prommer et al., 2006; 

Watson et al., 2005, among others). 

In 1996, Van Cappellen and Gaillard described sediment biogeochemistry with a detailed 

discussion on the mathematical formulation of transport fluxes and rates of 

biogeochemical reactions. In the same volume, Rittmann and VanBriesen (1996) 

developed a proper formulation for incorporating microbiological reactions into reactive 

transport models. As will be shown in Chapter 2 of this thesis, the formulation developed 

by Rittman and VanBriesen (1996) has been successfully applied to the numerical model 

developed. 

By catalysing geochemical redox reactions, microbes often contribute to maintain the 

redox potential of groundwater at a low level which enhances the geochemical stability of 

a deep geological repository (Pedersen, 1999). 

In 1996, Banwart et al. identified organic carbon oxidation induced by large-scale shallow 

water intrusion into a vertical fracture zone at the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory in Sweden. 

These authors concluded that surface water inflow due to excavation of a tunnel in a 

repository host rock adds reducing capacity in the form of organic carbon, implying that 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

20 

the soil cover may provide important protection against input of dissolved oxygen to 

fractures drained during the open phase of the repository. 

In 2004, Arcos et al. developed a numerical model using PHREEQC to simulate the Pore 

Water Chemistry (PC) Experiment in the Opalinus Clay at Switzerland. This model 

accounted for diffusional flow and transport coupled to several local equilibrium and 

kinetic geochemical reactions and microbially driven degradation of organic matter. The 

model was able to describe the redox evolution of the system, indicating the adequacy of 

considering the role of microbially driven organic matter oxidation. 

Yang et al. (2007) developed a coupled hydrobiogeochemical model, accounting for 

dissolved organic carbon (DOC) respiration and methane oxidation, to evaluate the 

geochemical and microbial consumption of dissolved oxygen (DO) in bentonite porewater 

after backfilling a HLNW repository. Parameters for microbial processes were derived 

from calibration of an in situ experiment carried out at the Äspo underground laboratory in 

Sweden. Numerical results showed that both geochemical and microbial processes are 

relevant for DO consumption. 

Since microbial processes can directly affect repository performance Jolley et al. (2003) 

developed a model to predict the quantity of microbial biomass that could be generated 

over time as a result of emplacement of the HLNW packages at Yucca Mountain, in 

southern Nevada. The model uses the MING code (Ehrhorn and Jolley, 1998) which is 

based on environmental thresholds for limiting microbial growth in the near field of a 

repository. 

In the context of the near-field geochemical stability, King et al. (2008) developed a 

reactive transport model to predict the corrosion behaviour of the copper canisters within a 

deep geological repository, accounting for aerobic bacteria respiration which was 

predicted to be the main O2 reduction process during the preliminary stages of the 

repository evolution.  

Besides promoting the geochemical stability of a deep geological repository by 

maintaining relatively reducing geochemical conditions, microbes can directly interact with 

radionuclides. In order to evaluate radionuclide migration in a shallow carbonate-rock 

aquifer, accounting for microbially-driven redox reactions, Wang and Papenguth (2001) 

proposed a general approach to incorporate microbial population dynamics into the 

biogeochemical model developed by Hunter et al. (1998). Wang and Papenguth (2001) 

extended this model to include radionuclide redox chemistry and its coupling with major 

biogeochemical processes. The results attained in this work showed that U(VI) can be 

reduced to insoluble U(IV) in anoxic zones triggered by microbial activity. Roden and 



I. Introduction 

21 

Scheibe (2005) reached similar conclusions by developing numerical simulations of 

bacterial U(VI) reduction which considered flow of anaerobic groundwater with and without 

acetate as an electron donor. The addition of acetate favoured the reduction of U(VI) to 

insoluble U(IV) (uraninite) by dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria. 

 

1.5 Objectives 

The overall objective of this thesis is to develop hydrogeochemical conceptual models and 

numerical simulations that integrate laboratory experimental results, site specific data and 

thermodynamic databases to assess the influence of geochemical and microbially-driven 

processes on radionuclide migration, in near-surface systems. 

The main goal of the work presented in Chapter 2 is to develop a conceptual and 

numerical model that is able to describe and simulate the processes observed in the jar-

fermentor experiment developed by JAEA, with special focus on the microbially-driven 

redox sequence from O2 reduction to methanogenesis. Besides simulation of direct 

parameters such as the concentration of organic electron donors and inorganic electron 

acceptors, the numerical model is intended to accurately simulate measured, with special 

emphasis on the master variables redox potential and pH. In order to develop such a 

sound and complete model, the partial equilibrium approach has been chosen for 

modelling microbially-driven geochemical reactions. 

The objective of the work presented in Chapters 3 and 4 is to develop a reliable 

conceptual model and reactive solute transport numerical simulations to predict the 

migration and retention of radionuclides derived from a hypothetical repository release in 

the near-surface systems of the site selected for the construction of a deep geological 

repository in Sweden (Forsmark). In order to build such reliable numerical simulations a 

complete modelling procedure is developed and tested on two different scenarios: (1) the 

first scenario entails a glacial clay deposit that underlies surface water bodies and is 

related to groundwater discharge areas at Forsmark, and the (2) second scenario 

simulates a shallow unconfined aquifer hosted by a till deposit that discharges to surface 

water bodies, such as streams, lakes or the Baltic Sea. 

At Forsmark the till deposit covers most of the surface of the granitic bedrock. Associated 

to surface water bodies, glacial clays can be found between the lake sediments and the till 

deposit, meaning that the glacial clays and till deposit are most likely hydraulically 

connected (Johansson et al., 2005). This feature has motivated us to initially 

conceptualize and model the two sediments in a single reactive transport numerical 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

22 

model. Nevertheless some difficulties have arisen which are related to both the 

understanding and the numerical implementation of the hydrodynamic and geochemical 

processes responsible for the differentiation between both sediments. Therefore, we have 

decided to model the glacial clay and till deposits in two separate numerical models which 

are described in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively. 

While Chapter 2 deals with a descriptive numerical model where the main goal is to fit 

simulated data to measured data and therefore improve our understanding on the 

geochemical processes triggered by microbial activity, and prove the reliability of the 

conceptual model that underlies the numerical model, Chapters 3 and 4 deal with 

predictive simulations that rely on the present-day knowledge of the hydrodynamic and 

geochemical behaviour of the near-surface systems at Forsmark. Here, the main focus is 

put on the predictive capacity of the simulations.  

The model presented in Chapter 2 is focused in smaller scale processes, such as the 

evolution of pH and redox potential triggered by microbial activity, while Chapters 3 and 4 

are focused on larger and hydrodynamic systems where coupling between geochemical 

processes, groundwater flow and solute transport play a major role. 

By considering groundwater flow and transport of solutes, the models developed in 

Chapters 3 and 4 provide a wider perspective of radionuclide mobility in the near-surface 

systems. Chapter 5 provides an ultimate upscaling of all the processes responsible for 

radionuclide mobility in the Quaternary till, by transforming the complex and mechanistic 

approach that underlies the reactive transport numerical model presented in Chapter 4 

into a simpler and CPU more efficient Kd-based model. In this context, the work presented 

in this thesis can be viewed as a progressive upscaling from hydrogeochemical retention 

processes to effective retardation parameters.

Abstract 

Performance assessment of a deep geological repository for high level nuclear waste 

(HLNW) must comprise predictions for the long-term geochemical evolution of the 

repository. In aquatic systems, microbial respiration oxidizes organic carbon whilst 

reduces inorganic components such as O2, NO3
-
, Fe

3+
, SO4

2-
 and C(IV) which, in turn, 

triggers changes in key geochemical parameters such as pH and redox potential. The 

inorganic carbon system is also influenced by microbial respiration and growth. In this 

context, a jar-fermentor experiment with lake water and sediment samples was conducted 

by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) to assess the role of microbial activity in 

aquatic systems. During the experiment, the main geochemical parameters were 

measured. A numerical model has been developed in order to simulate the jar-fermentor 

experiment and quantify the role of each microbial group that is believed to influence the 

geochemical evolution observed. Monod kinetic equations have been implemented to 

simulate microbially mediated reactions. Abiotic, kinetic and equilibrium, geochemical 

reactions have also been considered. Reduction of O2, NO3
-
, Fe

3+
 and SO4

2-
, lactate 

fermentation, evolution of pH and Eh, and production of CO2(g) and CH4(g) are well 

reproduced by the model. There is a relatively high uncertainty related to the values of the 

Monod kinetic parameters; very similar numerical solutions can be attained with different 

combinations of the Monod parameters.

Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems

2.1 Introduction 

Microbially mediated redox reactions are known to occur in natural aquatic systems. 

Microbes use available organic matter to build up new biomass, and to respire. The build 

up of new biomass requires nutrients, such as C, H, N, and O, from available organic 

matter and other sources to form new organic cells. On the other hand, microbial 

respiration oxidizes organic carbon whilst reduces inorganic components such as O2, 

SO4
2-
, NO3

-
, Fe

3+
, and C(IV) (Chapelle, 1993; Lovley et al., 1991; Rittmann and 

VanBriesen, 1996; Van Cappellen and Gaillard, 1996; von Gunten and Zobrist, 1993). 

Due to the interaction with inorganic components, microbial respiration triggers changes in 

key geochemical parameters such as redox potential and pH. 

Microbial activity involves using carbon from organic matter to build up new biomass cells 

and to respire. Building up new biomass leads to the transfer of carbon from the organic 

matter substances to the new biomass cells (Chapelle, 1993). When the microbial 

population decreases (i.e., the living organisms die), this carbon that was incorporated in 

biomass can degrade and be transformed again into an organic non-living matter, and 

ultimately be oxidized to inorganic carbon. Besides the build up of biomass, microbial 

respiration can act as a catalyser for the oxidation of carbon present in organic matter to 

inorganic carbon, which may divert into different physical states of inorganic carbon, such 

as HCO3
-
(aq), CO2(g) or even as carbonate minerals like calcite. Methanogenesis, a type 

of anaerobic respiration where carbon is the terminal electron acceptor (Thauer, 1998), 

also induces changes on the oxidation state of carbon, from C(0) in organic matter or 

C(IV) in carbon dioxide, to C(-IV) in methane. Microbial activity is, therefore, able of 

triggering the partitioning of carbon initially present in organic matter, through the three 

phases (aqueous, gaseous and solid) which also involves changes on the oxidation state 

of carbon. 

Performance assessment of deep geological repositories for HLNW must include 

predictions for the long-term geochemical evolution of these repositories. A deep 

geological repository accounts for several engineered (metallic canisters, bentonite, and 

cement) and natural (host rocks like granite, and surface sediments) barriers that prevent 

radionuclides, present in HLNW, from escaping to the surrounding natural environment 

and eventually interact with the surface ecosystems. 

Prediction of the geochemical evolution of a deep geological repository must provide 

reliable estimates for the long-term geochemical integrity of the metallic canisters that 

prevent direct contact between groundwater and the HLNW. Puigdomènech and Taxen

33 

(2000) concluded that dissolved oxygen (DO) and sulphide (HS
-
(aq)) in groundwater are 

the most damaging components for copper corrosion. In addition, if a copper canister 

becomes damaged; leading to direct contact between groundwater and the HLNW, a 

predominately reducing environment will mitigate the mobility of most radionuclides, e.g. 

U, Th and Se (Duro et al., 2006). 

Microbes may be present at repository depth (which is about 500 m), and therefore 

microbial activity could influence the geochemical evolution of a deep geological 

repository (Ajima et al., 2008; Banwart, 1999; and, Yang et al., 2007). 

Microbial activity may have a two folded role on the geochemical evolution of metallic 

canisters. On one hand, microbial activity favours the integrity of a copper canister by 

reducing DO but on the other hand, by reducing sulphate to sulphide, microbial activity 

may contribute to the corrosive attack of a copper canister. 

In the last years, JAEA has been performing laboratory experiments to assess the role of 

microbial activity in the geochemical evolution of aquatic systems (Nakajima et al., 2008 

and Todaka et al., 2007). Here, a numerical model of a jar-fermentor experiment with lake 

water and sediment samples that were oxidized by atmosphere bubbling is developed. 

Lactate was added to the jar-fermentor which was kept in closed conditions for 

approximately 13 days. During the experiment the main geochemical parameters and 

bacterial flora were analyzed (Nakajima et al., 2008). 

In the present work, the main biotic and abiotic processes that are believed to occur in the 

jar-fermentor experiment have been identified and implemented in a numerical model 

using PHREEQC (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999). The numerical model follows the partial 

equilibrium approach, in which the oxidation of organic matter is considered to be the rate 

limiting process, and the geochemical system is led to respond under local equilibrium by 

reducing the most thermodynamically favourable electron acceptor (EA). In addition, 

inhibition terms are used to describe mathematically the sequential use of EA’s (Barry et 

al., 2002, and references therein). 

 

2.2 Experimental set up 

The jar-fermentor experiment consists of a reactor with a capacity of 2.3 L in which 20 g of 

lake sediment were mixed with 2 L of lake water, at a constant temperature of 30ºC. The 

jar-fermentor was kept with a headspace of 5 mL. The sediment suspension was oxidized 

by atmosphere bubbling and stirred at 300 rpm. After 5 days, a solution of sodium lactate

34 

(final concentration of 10 mM) was added to the reactor which was kept in closed 

conditions for further 8 days (Figure 2.1). During the experiment, pH, DO concentration 

and redox potential data were monitored automatically by a data logger. In addition, water 

and gas samples were collected periodically for measuring selected parameters. DNA 

from microbes in the sediment suspension was also collected and bacterial flora analysis 

was carried out by PCR-DGGE method. The system was sterilized by autoclave and 

treatment by sodium azide (NaN3, final concentration of 10 mM) in order to prevent 

microbial contamination. 

The main mineral components of the sediment sample used in the experiment have been 

identified by XRD analysis. These are quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar, pyrite, calcite and 

clay minerals (smectite and kaolinite). Redox potential and pH of the sediment suspension 

were measured by ORP electrode (platinum electrode) and pH electrode (glass 

electrode). DO concentration was measured by DO electrode (diaphragm galvanic cell 

method). Dissolved anion concentrations (NO3
-
, NO2

-
, SO4

2-
, lactic acid ion, propionate 

ion, acetic acid ion, formic acid ion and pyruvate ion) were measured by ion 

chromatograph (DIONEX, ICS-1500 and ICS-2000). In the headspace, CO2(g) and CH4(g) 

concentrations were measured by gas chromatography (Varian, CP4900 with TCD 

detector).

2.3 Conceptual model 

2.3.1 Evidences from experimental results 

The jar-fermentor experiment may be viewed as a two steps experiment: (1) the first step 

concerns the period when the system is being disturbed due to bubbling, and (2) the 

second step begins when bubbling stops and lactate is added to the system which is kept 

in closed conditions. The present work is focused on understanding and modelling the 

results attained during the second step of the experiment, and therefore the initial 

conditions of the numerical model refer to the time when lactate is added to the jar-

fermentor (Figure 2.1). 

After the addition of lactate, the overall behaviour of the jar-fermentor shows a decrease 

of pe
2
 from approximately 8 to -4, and pH shows a small decrease during the first 70 

hours towards a circum-neutral pH that is maintained until the end of the experiment 

(Figure 2.2).

DO and nitrate are reduced within the first 10 hours (data will be shown in section 2.5). 

After the reduction of these species, lactate fermentation leads to the production of 

propionate and acetate. As lactate fermentation becomes less important, sulphate is

 In analogy to pH, pe= -log[e-]. pe was calculated from the Eh values measured during the 

experiment by, firstly correct measured Eh, relative to the platinum electrode, to Eh values that are 

relative to the standard hydrogen electrode (the reader is referred to p. 420 in Appelo and Postma, 

2005, for further reading on this subject). Then, corrected Eh values were transformed into pe 

values, by using the equation 9.22 in Appelo and Postma, 2005.

progressively reduced, and ferrous iron concentration increases. Methanogenesis is 

evidenced by the increase of methane in the headspace gas and also by the maintenance 

of a pe of -4 during the last 50 hours of the experiment. Besides methane, the partial 

pressure of carbon dioxide also increases in the headspace gas, reflecting the 

accumulation of the end-products of organic matter oxidation and methanogenesis (Figure 

2.3).

gaseous phases of the jar-fermentor reflects the occurrence of microbially mediated redox 

reactions that oxidize the added lactate and its fermentation products; propionate and 

acetate. 

Microbially mediated oxidation and fermentation of lactate have been reported elsewhere 

(von Gunten and Zobrist, 1993, among others). According to the evolution of the 

parameters measured in the jar-fermentor experiment, the microbially mediated redox 

reactions that are believed to occur in the jar-fermentor are: 

1) oxidation of lactate with reduction of DO and nitrate; 

2) oxidation of propionate with reduction of sulphate and reductive dissolution of 

FeOOH; 

3) methanogenesis.

37 

Fermentation of lactate is also evidenced by the decrease of lactate concentration 

accompanied by the increment of propionate and acetate concentration. The microbial 

groups that are believed to mediate the redox reactions occurring in the jar-fermentor 

experiment are listed in Table 2.1. 

Besides biotic reactions, abiotic reactions seem to occur in the jar-fermentor experiment. 

These abiotic reactions are evidenced by the general tendency of a relatively stable 

circum-neutral pH which seems to be buffered by calcite equilibrium. If calcite would not 

be present, the biological production of CO2 would most probably lead the system towards 

more acidic conditions than the ones observed. In addition, the evolution of Fe(II) in 

solution reveals that not only microbial activity is influencing its concentration, but also the 

precipitation of Fe(II) secondary phases which tend to lower Fe(II) aqueous concentration 

during the final stage of the jar-fermentor experiment. The precipitation of Fe(II) secondary 

phases is most likely triggered by the low pe that prevails during the last stages of the 

experiment, and the increased concentration of bicarbonate and S(-II) which can promote 

the precipitation of FeCO3 and FeS, respectively. It is worth mentioning that FeCO3 rarely 

precipitates as a pure phase but it forms solid solutions with calcium carbonate (ankerite, 

CaFe(CO3); Dromgoole and Walter, 1990). The thermodynamics of this solid solution 

series are still not well known, which is why the pure phase is selected for the current 

model calculations. 

Abiotic reductive dissolution of FeOOH (Pyzik and Sommer, 1981) is also expected due to 

the increment of HS
-
 as a consequence of microbially mediated reduction of S(VI) to S(-II). 

FeOOH has not been identified in the primary mineral assemblage of the lake sediment 

that was used for the jar-fermentor experiment. Instead, qualitative analysis of the lake 

sediment has identified the presence of pyrite. Nevertheless bubbling of the sediment 

performed during 120 hours, in the first step of the jar-fermentor experiment, may have 

triggered the oxidative dissolution of pyrite (Moses and Herman, 1991; Nicholson et al., 

1988) and subsequent precipitation of Fe(III) phases. For this purpose, kinetic calculations 

using PHREEQC were performed to assess the feasibility of pyrite oxidative dissolution 

(using the rate expression proposed by Nicholson et al., 1988) in a solution in contact with 

atmospheric O2, and letting FeOOH precipitate under local equilibrium, during 120 hours. 

The numerical results of these preliminary calculations have proven the possibility for the 

stated hypothesis of pyrite oxidation and subsequent precipitation of FeOOH, and, 

therefore FeOOH was considered the main Fe solid phase at the initial conditions of the 

numerical model.

The observed accumulation of CO2 and CH4 in the headspace gas of the jar-fermentor 

reflects the accumulation of the main end-products of the biological activity that has 

occurred during the experiment. The oxidation of organic matter by microbes leads to the 

production of CO2 and, when a more reducing environment prevails, reduction of C(IV) 

and C(0) from acetate to C(-IV) can be triggered by the activity of methanogens. It should 

be noted that in order to apply the partial equilibrium approach to simulate 

methanogenesis, the local equilibrium reaction describing the reduction of CO2 to CH4:

has been maintained in the thermodynamic database used for the calculations. This has 

implications on the accuracy of the numerical solution attained for the simulation of 

methanogenesis, as will be shown later in section 2.5.1.5.

to calcite and smectite while Fe is most likely linked to smectite and pyrite (the later being 

oxidised in the first stage of the experiment as indicated above). In smectite interlayer, 

cations such as Na
+
, Ca

2+
, and Fe

2+
 may exchange (Fletcher and Sposito, 1989), and 

therefore, the numerical simulations account for the presence of smectite with 

exchangeable sites for these cations. 

The amount of smectite defined in the numerical model was set according to the amount 

of Na reported in the lake sediment used in the experiment. Analytical data of the lake 

sediment show the presence of 1.37 wt% of Na in the sediment, and assuming that all Na 

in the solid phase is linked to smectite (with a theoretical chemical formula of 

(Na,Ca)(Al,Mg)6(Si4O10)3(OH)6, and molar weight of 1287 g/mol) a total of 1.2 × 10
-2
 mol of 

smectite in 20 g of sediment are obtained. Knowing that 20 g of sediment were mixed with 

2 L of water, 6 × 10
-3
 mol of smectite per litre of water are obtained. In addition, since the 

jar-fermentor experiment was conducted within a circum-neutral pH, smectite dissolution 

has been neglected, and therefore the total amount of exchangeable sites is kept constant 

throughout the simulation.  

From elemental analysis of the sediment, a concentration of 3.1 wt% of Ca is reported. 

Assuming that almost all Ca in the solid phase is linked to calcite, an initial concentration 

of 3 × 10
-3
 mol of calcite per litre of water is estimated. Calcite dissolution and precipitation 

have been considered to occur under local equilibrium (Table 2.1). 

As already mentioned, the pe of the system at the moment of lactate addition is 8 which is 

far from equilibrium with pyrite (a pe of -3 would be attained if the initial solution is 

equilibrated with pyrite). In this context, pyrite has been discarded from the initial mineral 

assemblage of the simulation and, in turn, FeOOH is considered to be present when 

lactate is added. From elemental analysis of the sediment, a concentration of 8.4 wt% of 

Fe is reported, and assuming that almost all Fe in the solid phase is linked to FeOOH, we 

obtain an initial concentration of 1 × 10
-2
 mol of FeOOH per litre of water. In the numerical 

model, dissolution of FeOOH is considered to be kinetically controlled both by biotic and 

abiotic processes (Table 2.1). The biotic dissolution of FeOOH is believed to be triggered 

by propionate oxidation mediated by IRB’s (e.g. Lovley et al., 1991, von Gunten and 

Zobrist, 1993), while the abiotic kinetic dissolution of FeOOH corresponds to the reductive 

dissolution of FeOOH triggered by the increase of HS
-
 concentration (Pyzik and Sommer, 

1981). 

The occurrence of black precipitates has been reported during the second step of the jar-

fermentor experiment which has been interpreted as an evidence for the precipitation of 

Fe(II) sulphides. Pyrite precipitation is known to be preceded by the precipitation of FeS 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

 

40 

(Rickard, 1997) which, in turn, is expected to be kinetically controlled under the prevailing 

conditions of the jar-fermentor experiment. For simplicity of the numerical model pyrite 

precipitation has been discarded from the model and only kinetic precipitation of FeS has 

been considered. The kinetic precipitation of FeS follows the model proposed by Pyzik 

and Sommer (1981). 

FeCO3 kinetic precipitation has been considered in the numerical model due to the 

observed increase of Fe(II) and C(IV) in solution during the jar-fermentor experiment. 

Jimenez-Lopez and Romanek (2004) have concluded that kinetic precipitation of FeCO3 

may occur at 25ºC, for saturation indices of FeCO3 that range from 0 to 3.4 × 10
3
. Since 

no kinetic rate expression has been found in the literature, the kinetic model proposed by 

Pyzik and Sommer (1981) for FeS has been modified to express the kinetic precipitation 

of FeCO3. 

 

2.4 Numerical model 

Numerical models are used worldwide in order to assess the influence of microbial 

respiration on the geochemical evolution of groundwaters (Banwart, 1999, Watson et al., 

2005, Brun and Engesgaard, 2002). The majority of these works concerns the 

degradation of organic contaminants such as phenol, tetrachloroethene, and benzene 

(Mayer et al., 2001, Watson et al., 2005, among others) in order to assess the efficiency of 

natural attenuation and bioremediation practices. 

The present work describes a model for the oxidation of lactate and two intermediates 

(acetate and propionate) by microbially mediated redox reactions that are believed to 

occur in the jar-fermentor experiment developed by Nakajima et al. (2008). 

 

2.4.1 Mathematical model 

2.4.1.1 Partial equilibrium and extended Monod growth model 

As already mentioned in section 2.1, the numerical model that has been developed to 

simulate microbially mediated redox reactions follows the so called partial equilibrium 

approach (Barry et al., 2002; Brun and Engesgaard, 2002). According to this approach, 

the oxidation of organic matter and reduction of inorganic EA’s is divided in two half-

reactions: (1) oxidation of organic matter which is treated kinetically (considered being the 

rate limiting process); and, (2) reduction of inorganic EA’s which is let to occur under local

equilibrium. In order to simulate the sequential use of EA’s, inhibition terms were 

introduced in the mathematical rate expressions that describe the biological activity of 

each microbial group considered.

equilibrium approach. Gibbs free energy change increases from O2 reduction to CO2 

reduction and the energy gained in these redox reactions increases at the opposite 

direction. 

 

In the numerical simulation, the mathematical rate expressions that describe the biological 

activity of each microbial group follow the extended Monod growth model (Rittmann and 

VanBriesen, 1996). This model accounts for limitation terms for both the organic matter 

being oxidized and the EA being reduced, and an inhibition term. The formulation of this 

model is expressed by two mathematical rate expressions that are interdependent:

Looking at equations 2.2 and 2.3, when the concentrations of a given ED and the 

respective EA are high, the rate of oxidation of ED (R
ED

) is a highly negative number 

which makes the net growth rate of microbes (rnet
Mic

) positive. In this situation microbial 

biomass is growing. On the other hand, if the concentration of an ED and/or EA is very 

low, the rate of oxidation of ED is a small negative number which makes rnet
Mic

 negative. 

Under these conditions the biomass is decreasing which simulates the decay of microbial 

population. 

In equation 2.2, as higher the half-saturation constant (for ED or EA) as lower the rate of 

oxidation of a given ED which means that the microbial group is highly limited by the 

concentration of ED or EA. Finally, as lower the inhibition constant as lower the rate of 

oxidation of a given ED, meaning that the microbial group is strongly inhibited by the 

presence of the inhibitor species. If this inhibition term is extremely low (lower than ~10
-10

), 

the term for inhibition in equation 2.2 will exert a mechanism in the mathematical 

expression similar to that of a switch function that has already been implemented by 

others (Brun and Engesgaard, 2002). When the inhibition term is high it means that the 

activity of a given microbial group may overlap the activity of another microbial group as 

already reported for SRB’s and IRB’s (Watson et al., 2005, among others). 

In order to simulate the influence of growing and decaying biomass over the inorganic 

composition of the solution where the biological activity is taking place, the composition of 



II. Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments 

43 

one mole of biomass has been considered to be C5H7O2N. This representation of the 

chemical composition of biomass has been used by others (Rittmann and VanBriesen, 

1996, Barry et al., 2002, Brun and Engesgaard, 2002). By assuming this chemical 

composition for the biomass, when a given microbial group decays, C, H, O and N will be 

added to solution at the proportion expressed by the stoichiometry of the molecule 

C5H7O2N. On the other hand, if a given microbial group is growing these elements will be 

removed from solution according to the same stoichiometry. 

In Table 2.2, the ED, EA and inhibitor species are summarised for each microbial group 

considered in the numerical simulation.

2.4.1.2 Numerical tool and thermodynamic database 

The numerical simulations have been performed with the geochemical code PHREEQC 

(Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999). This code solves a wide variety of low-temperature 

geochemical reactions, including aqueous speciation, dissolution and precipitation of pure 

phases and solid solutions, surface complexation, ion exchange and kinetically controlled 

reactions. PHREEQC was selected to develop a numerical model of the jar-fermentor 

experiment following the partial equilibrium approach because: 

• It provides an extremely versatile tool for user-defined kinetic rate expressions, 

offering the possibility for the user to define the algorithms that describe each rate 

expression under consideration. This is possible because PHREEQC has an 

embedded BASIC language interpreter (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999); and, 

• It is a robust and widely benchmarked geochemical code where the mass action 

equations that describe the thermodynamic equilibrium reactions needed to be 

considered in a partial equilibrium approach are correctly simulated. 

 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

 

44 

The thermodynamic database used in the present study is the NAGRA-PSI database, 

compiled by Hummel et al., 2002. This database contains a large set of complexation 

reactions as well as pure mineral equilibrium reactions for major elements and many trace 

elements. Additional Fe(III) carbonate complexes (Grivé, 2005) have been added to the 

database due to the high bicarbonate content expected as a consequence of microbial 

respiration.  

 

2.4.1.3 Numerical implementation of the biological activity 

Taking the biological activity of denitrifiers as an example, the following paragraphs 

explain how the partial equilibrium approach and extended Monod growth model have 

been implemented to describe the biological activity of this group. It should be mentioned 

that a similar procedure has been followed for the other microbial groups considered in 

the simulations. 

As shown in Table 2.2, the ED and EA used by denitrifiers are lactate and NO3
-
, 

respectively. In order to impede the activity of denitrifiers against aerobic respiration, the 

presence of O2 in solution is considered to inhibit the activity of denitrifiers. In the 

numerical simulation, regardless of the speciation of the elements that constitute the 

lactate molecule, the kinetic oxidation of lactate by denitrifiers can be described by the 

following equation: 

 

OHCLactate 353 ???                                                                                 (equation 2.4)  

 

In equation 2.4, one mole of lactate oxidized releases three moles of C, five moles of H 

and three moles of O into solution which corresponds to the chemical composition of one 

mole of lactate. The subsequent speciation of these elements is computed by PHREEQC 

according to the composition, pH and pe of the aqueous solution. 

If we consider the build up of one mole of denitrifiers from the oxidation of lactate, 

theoretically we would get the following half reaction:

(equation 2.5) 

 



II. Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments 

45 

In equation 2.4 we see that two moles of lactate are needed to produce one mole of 

biomass. This means that ideally the specific yield of denitrifiers would be 0.5 (1 mol of 

biomass per 2 mol of lactate). Nevertheless, laboratory experiments (Barry et al., 2002 

and references therein), and also the numerical results attained in the present work, show 

that microbial growth is not that efficient, meaning that from two moles of lactate less 

biomass is produced in favour of more C(IV) produced. This means that respiration may 

be more important than the build up of new biomass per each mole of lactate used by 

denitrifiers. 

Calibration of the numerical model that has been built to simulate the jar-fermentor 

experiment led to a specific yield for denitrifying bacteria of 0.05. By applying this specific 

yield in equation 2.5 we obtain the following rate equation for the oxidation of lactate by 

denitrifiers:

Nevertheless CO3

lead to the reduction of dissolved NO3

reduction of NO3

Taking equations 2.2 and 2.3 to describe the biological activity of denitrifiers the following 

equations are obtained:

 is the net growth rate of denitrifying bacteria at a given time step. 

As for all the other microbial groups, the values of the parameters that describe the 

activity of denitrifiers have been defined through calibration of the numerical model 

against measured data. This calibration stands on the best agreement between measured 

and computed values for the concentration of EA’s, ED’s, and the geochemical 

parameters pe and pH in the jar-fermentor experiment. 

The inhibition constant for O2 in equation 2.8 is very low meaning that denitrifiers will be 

more active when O2 concentration is lower than 10
-10

 mol·L
-1
. Such a low inhibition 

constant leads to a sequential use of lactate by aerobes followed by denitrifiers with a 

short overlap lag. 

 

2.4.2 Initial conditions 

Since the partial equilibrium approach that has been applied relies on a strong linkage 

between kinetic microbial reactions and local equilibrium reactions triggered by microbial 

activity, the initial composition of the aqueous solution, mineral assemblage and 

headspace gas must be defined with the highest completeness possible. The reference 

values used to establish the initial conditions of the numerical simulation are those 

measured when lactate is added to the jar-fermentor (i.e. beginning of the second step of 

the experiment). 

In the numerical simulations, and according to measured data, the initial aqueous solution 

is considered to be in equilibrium with calcite, and a partial pressure of 1.82 × 10
-1
 and 

2.51 × 10
-3
, for O2(g) and CO2(g), respectively. This assumption is a simplification of the 

real system of the jar-fermentor at the time of lactate addition. Most probably, at this time, 



II. Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments 

47 

the system is already in disequilibrium due to the disturbance caused by bubbling which 

enhances the interaction between inorganic components, organic matter and microbes. 

Nevertheless, modelling this experiment under the partial equilibrium approach requires 

the definition of an initial aquatic system that represents a temporary equilibrium, 

controlled by the mass action law, between aqueous, gaseous and solid phases. Based 

on the conceptual model previously described in section 2.3 and measured data at time of 

lactate addition, the following assumptions have been made (Table 2.3): 

1. Calcite is considered to be present, at equilibrium, with an amount of 3 × 10
-3
 

mol·L
-1
. This equilibrium leads to a concentration of Ca

2+
(aq) of 9.39 × 10

-4
 mol·L

-1
. 

2. The partial pressure of CO2(g) measured in the headspace gas (2.51 × 10
-3
) leads 

to an aqueous concentration of C(IV) of 3.75 × 10
-3
 mol·L

-1
. 

3. The initial partial pressure of CH4(g) measured in the headspace gas is 3.02 × 10
-4

 

which is not thermodynamically compatible with a partial pressure of CO2(g) of 2.51 

× 10
-3
 and a pe of 8, as it was measured at time zero. Since the initial system is 

believed to have a partial pressure of CO2(g) and a pe close to the values actually 

measured at time zero, the initial partial pressure of CH4(g) has been calculated by 

prescribing the CO2(g) partial pressure measured at time zero, and letting 

PHREEQC calculate the corresponding partial pressure for CH4(g). The value 

obtained for the initial partial pressure of CH4(g) is 6.03 × 10
-142

 which is extremely 

low, reflecting the prevailing oxidizing conditions for the initial state of the jar-

fermentor experiment.  

4. O2(aq) concentration is influenced by the partial pressure of O2(g) in the 

headspace gas. Measured concentration of O2(aq) (2.12 × 10
-4
 mol·L

-1
) is not in 

equilibrium with a partial pressure of O2(g) of 1.82 × 10
-1
, as it was measured when 

lactate was added. To build up the initial conditions of the numerical model, the 

concentration of O2(aq) is given more importance than the partial pressure of O2(g) 

measured in the headspace. Therefore, the initial partial pressure of O2(g) was set 

by equilibrating the headspace gas with the measured concentration of O2(aq), 

using PHREEQC. The initial partial pressure obtained for O2(g) is 9.04 × 10
-1
. After 

these equilibrium calculations, O2(aq) concentration is slightly changed to 2.09 × 

10
-4
 mol·L

5. In addition to O2(g), CO2(g) and CH4(g) measured in the headspace gas, H2S(g), 

N2(g) and H2(g) are let to accumulate in the headspace gas during the simulation 

of the experiment. The selection of these gases was set according to the main 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

 

48 

end-products of the microbially mediated redox reactions considered in the 

numerical model and their initial partial pressures were set according to the output 

of preliminary PHREEQC geochemical calculations. 

6. As mentioned in section 2.3.2, FeOOH is considered to be present at an initial 

concentration of 1 × 10
-2
 mol·L

-1
. The concentration of this mineral during the 

experiment is considered to be influenced solely by kinetic processes: biotic 

(respiration of IRB) and abiotic (reductive dissolution of FeOOH by HS
-
). According 

to the reaction proposed by Pyzik and Sommer (1981), S
0
 precipitates as a 

consequence of abiotic reductive dissolution of FeOOH. S
0
 is considered to be 

absent at time zero. 

7. Due to the prevailing oxidizing conditions at time zero, FeS is considered to be 

absent at the beginning of the experiment but is let precipitate according to the 

kinetic rate expression proposed by Pyzik and Sommer (1981). This assumption, 

together with the microbially mediated redox reactions leads to the precipitation of 

FeS during the simulation which is in agreement with the observation of black 

precipitates as mentioned in section 2.3.2. FeCO3 is also considered to be absent 

at the beginning of the experiment, due to the same reason as for FeS. 

 

The preliminary geochemical equilibrium calculations performed in PHREEQC for the set 

up of the initial aqueous solution, gas and solid compositions led to pe (12.36) and pH 

(7.75) values that are different from the ones actually measured at time zero (pe = 8.31 

and pH = 8.08). Nevertheless, since the real system is not in equilibrium and these are 

indirect geochemical parameters that depend on equilibrium calculations, it was decided 

to attribute a higher level of confidence to the concentrations of the aqueous, gaseous and 

solid species measured, and the initial value of the indirect parameters pe and pH has 

been defined according to the output of these preliminary PHREEQC calculations (Table 

2.3).

2.4.3 Parameterization 

The values of the parameters for the numerical rate expressions that describe the 

biological activity of each microbial group have been defined through calibration of the 

numerical model. The criteria for this calibration have been set, with a progressively 

decreasing weight, by finding the best agreement between measured and simulated 

values of: 

1) aqueous concentration of inorganic EA’s; 

2) aqueous concentration of organic species: lactate, propionate and acetate. 

3) pH; 

4) pe; 

5) gaseous concentration of CO2 and CH4. 

Such calibration has led to an overall good agreement between numerical results and 

measured data, as will be shown in section 2.5. 

According to the criteria used for calibration, the values listed in Table 2.4 (Reference 

case) have been attained for the parameters of the numerical model implemented. During 

calibration of the numerical model, the influence of each parameter on the shape of the 

curve that describes the evolution of each EA has been analysed. 

The initial concentration of biomass for each microbial group has been found to influence 

the initial trend of the curve; as higher the initial concentration of biomass as earlier the 

consumption of the corresponding EA. On the other hand, when the initial concentration of 

biomass is very low, a plateau may be formed in the initial stage, meaning that the redox 

process is developing at a very small rate, as observed for the case of sulphate reduction 

(section 2.5.1.3). 

A high specific yield (Y
Bact

) tends to increase the slope of the curve of consumption of a 

given EA (as for the case of DO and NO3
-
, section 2.5.1.1), while a low specific yield tends 

to decrease this slope (e.g. sulphate reduction, section 2.5.1.3). The maximum rate of 

oxidation of ED (qmED
Bact

) exerts a great influence on the time at which the optimum of a 

given microbial group occurs. Finally, the half-saturation constants and inhibition 

constants help defining the sequential use of EA’s. 

After calibration of the numerical model, a second model has been built by assigning the 

same initial concentration of biomass for all microbial groups considered (Alternative case 

in Table 2.4). This exercise has been done in order to assess the influence of the 

uncertainty related to the initial concentration of each microbial group and the non-



II. Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments 

51 

uniqueness of the numerical solution related to the uncertainty on the Monod parameters 

which has been reported by others (Schirmer et al., 1999). The initial concentration of 

each microbial group in an unknown of the jar-fermentor experiment, but it is a variable 

that can be assessed in future experiments. On the other hand, the half saturation and 

inhibition constants, and maximum growth rates that describe the activity of each 

microbial group represent variables which are much more complicated to measure and, in 

addition. The influence of the uncertainty related to the Monod parameters will be 

discussed in section 2.5.2. 

By fixing an initial concentration of 1 × 10
-8
 mol·L

-1
 of biomass for each microbial group 

some difficulties have arisen when searching for the best fit between measured and 

simulated data. These results reveal that most probably, at time zero, the initial 

concentration of each microbial group in the jar-fermentor is already being influenced by 

the geochemical reactions taking place and therefore, the initial dimension of microbial 

populations is not the same for each microbial group. Further discussion of the results 

attained in the alternative case is presented in section 2.5.2.

2.5 Discussion 

2.5.1 Processes 

Since most probably the initial dimension of microbial populations is different for each 

microbial group, the interpretation of model results and subsequent analyses of the 

processes influencing such results are based on the reference case where the initial 

dimension of biomass is different for each microbial group. 

 

2.5.1.1 Reduction of DO and NO3
-
 

In the reference model a very good agreement between measured and simulated data for 

DO and NO3
-
 has been achieved. 

In Figure 2.5a, the maximum of aerobic bacteria population coincides with the rapid 

consumption of dissolved oxygen, reflecting the dependence of the net growth rate of 

aerobic bacteria on the availability of dissolved oxygen. When dissolved oxygen is 

exhausted the population of aerobic bacteria quickly decays which reflects the influence of 

the half-saturation constant for dissolved oxygen present in the extended Monod equation 

that describes the rate of lactate oxidation by aerobes. Similarly, the rapid decrease of 

nitrate concentration (Figure 2.5b) coincides with the rapid increase of denitrifying 

bacteria, and when nitrate is exhausted, denitrifying bacteria population progressively 

decays.

2.5.1.2 Lactate fermentation, evolution of acetate and propionate 

Figure 2.6 shows measured and simulated results for lactate, acetate and propionate 

concentrations. It has been seen, in Figure 2.5, that the reduction of DO and NO3
-
 (that 

use lactate as ED) is well reproduced by the model, and these species are reduced in 6 

and 12 hours, respectively. Looking at Figure 2.6, one may see that the reduction of DO 

and NO3
-
 has negligible influence on the concentration of lactate. In addition, the evolution 

of fermentative bacteria population (shown in Figure 2.6a) with a growth trend that is 

approximately symmetric to the trend of lactate consumption (until ~75 hours), reflects the 

dominating role of these bacteria on lactate concentration. Finally, when lactate is 

exhausted, the population of fermentative bacteria progressively decays. 

As mentioned in section 2.3, lactate fermentation leads to the production of acetate and 

propionate. The numerical model reproduces very well the evolution of fermentation 

products, except for propionate which is over predicted (Figure 2.6b). Numerical results 

follow approximately the observed evolution of propionate, but at computed values that 

are ~1.6 times measured data. The reason why propionate concentration is over predicted 

is most probably due to model stoichiometry or other propionate-consuming processes 

that have not been considered in the numerical model. This subject will be further 

discussed in section 2.5.1.6.  

According to the reaction for lactate fermentation proposed by von Gunten and Zobrist 

(1993), the stoichiometry of the kinetic reaction of lactate fermentation, without 

considering the build up of new biomass, is:

aqOHCaqOHCaqOHC
???

??                             (equation 2.10) 

 

In equation 2.10, three moles of lactate are diverted into one mole of acetate and 2 moles 

of propionate. When build up of biomass of fermentative bacteria (with a specific yield of 

0.001, Table 2.4) is considered, the following equation is attained:

II. Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments 

55 

In equation 2.11, besides the stoichiometry of lactate fermentation described by equation 

2.10, the build up of fermentative bacteria biomass is also expressed. This reaction affects 

both pe and pH. pe is affected due to the oxidation of 0.995 moles of C(0) from lactate to 

0.995 moles of C(IV) from HCO3
-
, while pH is affected due to production of 0.976 moles of 

H
+
 per each mole of reaction 2.11. In fact it will be shown in sections 2.5.1.4 and 2.5.1.5 

that, when the highest rate of lactate fermentation takes place (approximately between 40 

and 75 hours, Figure 2.6A), important changes are computed (and also measured) for pe 

and pH. 

Acetate evolution (Figure 2.6c) is initially influenced by lactate fermentation which leads to 

the increase of acetate concentration until 70 hours. Afterwards, when lactate is 

exhausted, acetate production is provided by sulphate reduction, according to the reaction 

proposed by von Gunten and Zobrist (1993). Finally, at approximately 175 hours acetate 

concentration is kept more or less stable due to balancing between sulphate reduction 

and consumption of acetate by methanogens.

2.5.1.3 Reduction of Fe(III) and SO4
2-
, and precipitation of secondary minerals 

Reductive dissolution of FeOOH is considered to occur, under kinetics, both biotically and 

abiotically. The first is provided by the activity of IRB’s and the second is triggered by the 

increase of HS
-
 concentration. Biotic reduction of FeOOH is accompanied by oxidation of 

propionate while abiotic reduction of FeOOH is accompanied by oxidation of S(-II) to S(0) 

and subsequent precipitation of S
0
 as follows (Pyzik and Sommer, 1981):

?????                        

(equation 2.12) 

 

Besides S
0
, precipitation of FeS and FeCO3 are also considered. FeS precipitation is 

supported by observations during the jar-fermentor experiment as mentioned in section 

2.3.1, while precipitation of FeCO3 is expected due to the increase of Fe(II) concentration 

and the partial pressure of CO2 during the experiment. 

The evolution of Fe(II) in solution (Figure 2.7a) reflects the combined effect of several 

processes. Until the first 10 hours, the FeOOH/Fe(II) system is relatively stable. From 10 

to 100 hours an important increase of Fe(II) is computed (and measured). Then, from 100 

to 160 hours, a relatively stable concentration of Fe(II) is computed and, during the final 

part of the experiment, a new increase is predicted. 

The first increase in Fe(II) concentration is mainly due to the activity of IRB’s, since abiotic 

reductive dissolution of FeOOH depends on the presence of HS
-
(aq) which only becomes 

important after SO4
2-
 reduction by SRB’s, from approximately 150 hours (Figure 2.7b). The 

second increase of Fe(II) in solution, with a lower slope than the first increase, is attributed 

to both biotic and abiotic reductive dissolution of FeOOH, since HS
-
 is now available, 

combined with the precipitation of FeS and FeCO3 which tend to decrease Fe(II)(aq) 

concentration (Figure 2.7c). 

Between 115 and 160 hours, a small deceasing tendency followed by a plateau is 

simulated for the evolution of Fe(II) which is attributed to a temporary lag when 

precipitation of Fe(II) phases become important and reductive dissolution of FeOOH is still 

small to compensate the removal of Fe(II) from solution due to the precipitation of the 

Fe(II) secondary phases (Figure 2.7a and c). 

As already mentioned, HS
-
 may be a species of concern with respect to the chemical 

integrity of a HLNW repository, since metallic canisters may be corroded by this species.

2.5.1.4 pH and the carbon system 

In general, measured pH is well reproduced by the numerical model, but CO2(g) results 

show some discrepancies between measured and simulated values (Figure 2.8). The 

general trend of CO2(g) observed until 100 hours is relatively well reproduced by the 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

 

58 

model, but afterwards, the observed increase of the P(CO2) is not well reproduced by the 

numerical model. In the next paragraphs, measured and simulated values for pH, CO2(g) 

and calcite (only simulated) are discussed.

Figure 2.8 – Time evolution of measured (symbols) and simulated (red line) partial pressure 

of CO2(g) in the headspace and pH. Computed concentration of calcite during the 

experiment is also shown (blue line). 

 

pH measured during the jar-fermentor experiment shows two trends. The first trend (from 

the beginning of the experiment until approximately 75 hours) shows a gradual decrease 

from 8.0 to 6.7 pH units. In the second trend, the pH is stabilized at a pH value around 7.0 

until the end of the simulation. 

Similarly to measured pH, simulated pH also shows a more or less stable circum-neutral 

value from approximately 75 hours until the end of the experiment. Nevertheless, at the 



II. Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments 

59 

beginning and end of the experiment pH is overestimated with respect to measured 

values. 

In the pH range measured during the experiment, and if pH and the carbon system would 

be controlled by calcite equilibrium, the following reversible reactions would be 

responsible for such control:

???
???                                            (equation 2.14) 

 

Looking at equations 2.13 and 2.14, if the P(CO2) increases HCO3
-
 is produced and at the 

same time pH decreases (due to the released H
+
) which triggers calcite dissolution. 

Calcite dissolution, in turn, produces more HCO3
-
 and buffers pH. From 75 hours until the 

end of the experiment, although calcite is predicted to precipitate, the simulated (and 

measured, at least until 100 hours) partial pressure of CO2 decreases. This apparently 

contradictory relation between simulated calcite and CO2 evolution could be explained by 

other carbon consuming process that hinders the increase of P(CO2), such as 

methanogenesis. Nevertheless, an alternative simulation has been performed without the 

formation of methane, but the partial pressure of CO2 is still underestimated. Another 

reason for the discrepancy between measured and simulated CO2 could be due to the fact 

that calcite is modelled under local equilibrium, and instead calcite could be controlled by 

kinetics. This hypothesis has also been tested in an alternative numerical model, by using 

the rate expression defined by Plummer et al. (1978) for the kinetic 

precipitation/dissolution of calcite. Nevertheless, very similar results have been attained 

compared to the simulation where calcite is treated under local equilibrium. 

The differences between measured and simulated partial pressure of CO2 are still not well 

understood, but could be due to one or more of the following factors (or even others that 

have not been identified yet): (1) overestimation of propionate production in lactate 

fermentation which leads to less available C(IV) in solution; (2) other propionate degrading 

processes could be present that would lead to more available C(IV); or (3) overestimation 

of abiotic methanogenesis. Abiotic methanogenesis (modelled under local equilibrium) 

leads to an excess of methane in the headspace gas (as will be shown in the next 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

 

60 

section), compared to measured data, which leads to a predominance of C(-IV) against 

C(IV), in the final stages of the simulation. 

 

2.5.1.5 Methanogenesis 

Kinetic reduction of acetate to CH4 is considered to be mediated by methanogens. As 

previously mentioned, since we are following the partial equilibrium approach, the local 

equilibrium reaction between C(IV) and C(-IV) (equation 2.1) has not been removed from 

the thermodynamic database, and therefore, abiotic methanogenesis is predicted 

whenever the redox potential is favourable for such reaction.  

Numerical results show a considerable overestimation of CH4(g) with respect to measured 

values (Figure 2.9). In fact, even if the biological activity of methanogens is not included in 

the numerical model, computed CH4(g) is already produced abiotically (results not shown). 

Consideration of this microbial group has very low effect on the total CH4 produced. On 

the other hand, if equation 2.1 is not included in the thermodynamic database, simulated 

pe is higher than the values measured during the last stage of the experiment. 

The results attained in the experiment point towards the hypothesis of fully kinetic 

production of CH4 from HCO3
-
, instead of the partial equilibrium approach applied here. 

But this consideration is not compatible with the partial equilibrium approach (where 

changes on the oxidation state of inorganic species are modelled under local equilibrium) 

that has been adopted in the present work, and for this reason the model fails to 

reproduce experimental data for methane and carbon dioxide.

2.5.1.6 pe and the microbial redox sequence 

Measured pe seems to reflect the biological activity of the microbial groups considered 

(Figure 2.10). The rapid decrease of measured pe until the first 15 hours reflects the 

reduction of O2 and NO3
-
 which is well reproduced by the model. The preceding temporal 

pe increase could be due to lactate fermentation, since this process is believed to follow 

O2 and NO3
-
 reduction, and it produces oxidized carbon without reducing any inorganic 

EA, as expressed by equation 2.11.

evolution of biomass of all microbial groups considered in the simulation is also shown, in 

the lower graphic. 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

 

62 

In Figure 2.10, from 50 hours, fermentative bacteria biomass is much more important than 

all the other microbial groups. These computed results support the hypothesis for pe 

being controlled by the biological activity of this group when they are close to their 

maximum. Then, at approximately 115 hours, the rapid drop of computed pe to 

approximately -4 seems to reflect the relative importance of abiotic methanogenesis. 

The simulated pe plateau around 2, most probably motivated by lactate fermentation, lasts 

longer than measured temporal pe increase (from 15 to 50 hours). Nevertheless, lactate 

consumption is well reproduced by the model, as observed in section 2.5.1.2.  

Since measured evolution of almost all the inorganic EA’s (exception made for HCO3
-
 in 

methanogenesis) is well reproduced by the numerical model, the discrepancies observed 

between measured and simulated pe could be due to the stoichiometry of lactate 

fermentation implemented which has resulted in an overestimation of propionate (section 

2.5.1.2). In fact, if we consider an alternative stoichiometry for lactate fermentation, in 

such a way that computed propionate does not overestimate measured propionate, 

computed pe matches better observed values, as shown in Figure 2.11.

II. Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments 

63 

The alternative stoichiometry for lactate fermentation that leads to a better agreement 

between observed and measured pe (and also propionate, data not shown) is as follows: 

 

3 mole of lactate ? 1 mole of acetate + 1.3 moles of propionate                                

(equation 2.17) 

 

In equation 2.17, the build up of new biomass of fermentative bacteria is not shown, for 

simplicity. In contrast to what is shown in equation 2.17, the stoichiometry used in the 

calibrated case that has been implemented in other works (von Gunten and Zobrist, 1993 

and Schäfer et al., 1998), is: 

 

3 mole of lactate ? 1 mole of acetate + 2 moles of propionate                                   

(equation 2.18) 

 

With the alternative stoichiometry for lactate fermentation (equation 2.17), the small 

plateau computed for pe coincides with the temporal increase of measured pe (Figure 

2.11). Nevertheless, this alternative stoichiometry for lactate fermentation triggers the 

anticipation of reduction of SO4
2-
. Therefore, for the objective of this study we rely on the 

reference case which results have been discussed in the former sections.  

 

2.5.2 Uncertainties on Monod parameters 

During parameterization of the extended Monod kinetic expressions applied for each 

microbial group considered in the numerical model, different combinations of the 

parameters have been found to lead to the same numerical solution. These results point 

towards non-uniqueness of the numerical solution which has also been identified by 

others (Schirmer et al., 1999). In this context, an alternative combination of Monod kinetic 

parameters has been applied by fixing an initial concentration of biomass of 1 × 10
-8
 

mol·L
-1
 for all microbial groups. The values of the Monod kinetic parameters applied in this 

alternative case are listed in Table 2.2. 

In Figure 2.12, the main results of the alternative case are shown. As for the reference 

case, in the alternative case, measured time evolution of pH, DO, NO3
-
, lactate, acetate 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

 

64 

and SO4
2-

 is very well reproduced by the numerical model. And, as observed for the 

reference case, propionate is overestimated in the alternative case. 

Computed calcite concentration shows a more abrupt evolution than the one computed in 

the calibrated case. In addition, between 75 and 115 hours, the alternative case computes 

an exhaustion of calcite (zero moles of this mineral). These results reflect the influence of 

the new combination of the Monod parameters that, in general, leads to a more abrupt 

computed evolution of the biomass of the different microbial groups considered which, 

consequently, induce more abrupt curves for the EA’s and ED’s involved. 

Fe(II) evolution does not fit so well in the alternative case (Figure 2.12e) as in the 

calibrated case (Figure 2.7b). This could be due to the fact that in the alternative case 

IRB’s population is very small at the beginning of the simulation (mainly due to the 

imposed initial concentration of 1 × 10
-8
 mol·L

-1
), and therefore computed Fe(II) is 

underestimated for the initial stage of the experiment. 

Computed maximum of each microbial group in the alternative case also differs from the 

reference case. These differences are motivated by the different values of the Monod 

parameters. Maximum of aerobic bacteria in the alternative case is approximately the 

double of the maximum reached in the calibrated case, while the maximum of denitrifying 

bacteria in the alternative case is much smaller that in the reference case. Maxima of 

fermentative bacteria, IRB’s and SRB’s are smaller in the alternative case than in the 

reference case. The different partitioning of carbon between biomass and the inorganic 

carbon system observed in the two cases under study, has obviously an important 

influence on the computed results for the inorganic carbon system. Additional data must 

be measured in further experiments, such as calcium concentration and the initial 

concentration of microbial groups, in order to minimise the uncertainties associated to the 

experimental initial conditions and evolution, and thus, maintaining the uncertainties 

associated solely to the parameters describing the kinetic rates in the Monod growth 

model.

2.6 Conclusions 

The results obtained have proven the weak and strong aspects of the conceptual and 

numerical models implemented to simulate microbial redox processes. Some 

discrepancies between modelled and measured data are still unsolved. Future 

experiments with additional data measurements and a sensitivity analysis of the Monod 

parameters may help solving some of these problems. 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

 

66 

The calibration of the numerical model helped improving the understanding of the 

processes that influence pH and the redox potential of the jar-fermentor experiment. 

Undoubtedly, microbial activity exerts a great influence on pH, pe and associated 

composition of mineral and gas phases, within an aquatic system where organic matter is 

available. The results attained show that if microbes and organic matter are present in the 

vicinity of a deep geological repository, microbial redox reactions may provide a relatively 

fast evolution towards reducing conditions that are favourable to the geochemical integrity 

of the repository. If HS
-
 is produced during the sequence of microbial redox reactions, its 

concentration can be controlled by the precipitation of sulphur secondary phases such as 

S(0) and FeS which were predicted by the numerical simulation developed here. In this 

context, precipitation of sulphur secondary minerals may contribute to the mitigation of 

corrosion of the copper canisters within a deep geological repository. 

By applying the partial equilibrium approach in PHREEQC a reliable estimation of the 

indirect parameters pH and pe has been achieved. Measured evolution of the inorganic 

EA’s (DO, NO3
-
 and SO4

2-
) and Fe(II) is very well reproduced by the numerical model. 

Simulated lactate fermentation and methanogenesis have shown some discrepancies with 

respect to measured data. 

Fermentative bacteria seem to be the dominant microbial group during most of the 

experiment, and therefore, the inorganic system is highly influenced by the biological 

activity of this group. The temporal pe plateau around 2 seems to be controlled by the 

activity of fermenters, as well as the first and fastest increase of the partial pressure of 

CO2 in the headspace gas which triggers calcite dissolution. The jar-fermentor experiment 

and the numerical simulations developed here have provided an improved understanding 

of aquatic systems influenced by microbial activity. In order to assess the influence of 

such microbial activity in the repository system new numerical simulations that account for 

its geochemical and hydrodynamic features should be developed.  

The stoichiometry of lactate fermentation may be different (3 mol Lactate ? 1 mol Acetate 

+ 1.3 mol Propionate) from the one implemented in the reference case (3 mol Lactate ? 1 

mol Acetate + 2 mol Propionate), that has been implemented by others (Schäfer et al., 

1998). 

Methane production is overestimated with respect to measured data which seems to 

indicate solely kinetic processes controlling CH4 production rather then both local 

equilibrium and biotic kinetic processes as implemented here. 



II. Modelling microbially mediated redox processes in lake sediments 

67 

Some uncertainties related to the Monod parameters could be solved in future 

experiments if additional variables are measured, such as aqueous calcium and 

carbonate minerals concentration, and the initial and final concentration of microbial 

groups.

Abstract 

The Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB) has recently 

selected Forsmark for sitting a deep geological repository for high level nuclear waste 

(HLNW). At the surface, a Quaternary till overlies the granitic candidate host rock. 

Radionuclides potentially released from a repository may reach surface ecosystems if 

these are somehow related to deep groundwater discharge areas. At Forsmark, surface 

water bodies are partially fed by shallow aquifers which locally receive deep groundwater 

discharge. At the bottom of surface water bodies and overlying the Quaternary till, glacial 

clays are present. Reactive transport numerical simulations have been performed to 

evaluate the retention of radionuclides, potentially released from a repository, in the 

glacial clays related to groundwater discharge areas. Four radionuclides (
235

U, 
135

Cs, 

226
Ra and 

90
Sr) have been selected according to their different geochemical behaviour and 

potential dose relevance to surface ecosystems. Numerical results indicate that U 

precipitates as amorphous uraninite in the glacial clay; Sr co-precipitates with calcite and 

it is also adsorbed on illite. Cs is also retained by adsorption on illite. Ra is mobile, since 

co-precipitation with barite, the only mechanism considered to retain Ra, is not predicted 

by the numerical calculations.

Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

72 

3.1 Introduction 

On June 2009, SKB has decided to select Forsmark as the site for the final repository for 

Sweden’s HLNW. The selection of Forsmark is the result of close to 20 years of work 

during which SKB has conducted surveys throughout Sweden and feasibility studies in 

eight municipalities. These were followed by site investigations in two alternative sites: 

Forsmark and Oskarshamn between 2002 and 2007 (SKB, 2009). The deep geological 

repository is designed with a number of engineered (copper canisters, clay barriers, 

cement liners) and natural geological barriers to prevent and retard for long periods of 

time (~100,000 years) the potential migration of radionuclides to the surface (SKB, 2006). 

As reported by Berglund et al. (2009), flow path analysis is required in the context of 

safety assessment to identify discharge areas where radionuclides potentially released 

from a repository could reach the surface ecosystems. At Forsmark, the near-surface 

Quaternary sediments would constitute the last geological barrier preventing the arrival of 

radionuclides to the surface biosphere. For this reason, SKB has launched a 

comprehensive research programme for the near-surface hydro-geo-ecological study of 

the candidate sites. The main scientific results of such programme have been recently 

published in Berglund et al. (2009). 

Quantitative analysis of radionuclide migration and the evaluation of the retention capacity 

of Quaternary sediments is part of the safety assessment of the repository. Coupled 

groundwater flow and reactive solute transport models provide a useful tool for such 

quantitative understanding of radionuclide migration through the Quaternary sediments 

connecting deep groundwater flow paths to surface discharge areas. 

In the last years, reactive transport models have been applied to a wide variety of 

environmental issues some of which include characterization of landfill plumes (Brun et 

al., 2002), cation exchange models to describe caesium sorption at high ionic strength in 

subsurface sediments contaminated by HLNW (Liu et al., 2004), large-scale and long-

term reactive transport simulations to validate hydrochemical and hydrogeological 

conceptual models (Molinero and Samper, 2006), simulation of laboratory experiments 

(Steefel et al., 2003) and assessment of the geochemical evolution of a deep geological 

repository (Arcos et al., 2008). 

The work presented here focuses on the hydrogeochemical processes that influence 

radionuclide migration in the Quaternary sediments present at the groundwater discharge 

areas in one of the candidate sites (Forsmark). 



III. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in glacial clays related to groundwater discharge areas 

73 

Coupled groundwater flow and reactive solute transport numerical simulations have been 

performed to assess the retention of selected radionuclides in glacial clays present at the 

bottom of surface water bodies related to groundwater discharge areas. Four 

radionuclides (
235

U, 
135

Cs, 
226

Ra and 
90

Sr) have been selected to be studied, according to 

their different geochemical behaviour and potential dose relevance to surface 

ecosystems.  

 

3.2 Scope 

A modelling procedure to assess radionuclide retention in near-surface systems is 

described in the present work. This modelling procedures relies on six main steps: (1) a 

thorough review of site specific data that describe the hydrogeochemical behaviour of the 

system under study; (2) development of the conceptual model of the system based on 

data gathered in the first step; (3) identification and quantification of the thermodynamic 

parameters that describe the geochemical processes of interest; (4) implementation of the 

conceptual model in reactive transport numerical simulations; (5) simulation of a 

hypothetical repository release in the numerical model; and, (6) quantitative assessment 

of radionuclide retention in the modelled system based on the outputs of the numerical 

simulations. 

Site specific data on hydraulic, hydrochemical and geochemical parameters of the glacial 

clays at Forsmark have been thoroughly analysed from the SKB database of the 

Forsmark Site Characterization Programme (SKB, 2005). The glacial clay conceptual 

model was then implemented in a reactive transport numerical model. By simulating a 

long period of coupled groundwater flow and reactive solute transport with the average 

concentrations of the main reactive minerals, major and minor ions, and natural isotopes 

of the studied radionuclides, the geochemical quasi-steady state of the glacial clays has 

been modelled and reproduces the present-day conditions observed at the groundwater 

discharge areas of Forsmark. Once the present-day hydrogeochemical conditions of the 

glacial clays at Forsmark have been modelled, a hypothetical repository release was 

simulated by injecting a deep groundwater carrying repository-derived radionuclides into 

the modelled domain. The simulation of repository release was performed for an 

additional long period of reactive solute transport. From the outputs of the numerical 

simulations, the radionuclide retention capacity of the glacial clays present at the bottom 

of surface water bodies has been quantitatively assessed.

3.3 Near-surface hydrogeology at Forsmark 

The near-surface hydrogeology at Forsmark is composed of Quaternary deposits that host 

confined and unconfined aquifers overlying the granitic bedrock. Groundwater in the 

granitic bedrock flows mainly along fractures and deformation zones composed of loose 

granitic material and coatings of calcite, chlorite, quartz and pyrite (Drake et al., 2006). 

The till deposit which is the most abundant Quaternary deposit (~75% of aerial extension, 

Figure 3.1) hosts unconfined porous aquifers with stratified hydraulic conductivity and 

porosity (Johansson et al., 2005). The thickness of the Quaternary deposits is highly 

variable, usually from 0 to 3 m, although in some places it can reach over 10 m 

(Johansson et al., 2005). 

In general, the till deposit consists of sandy glacial deposits with variable amounts of 

boulders and clay (Albrecht, 2005). The origin of this till is associated with the glacial 

erosion, transport and deposition of Palaeozoic carbonate rocks located northwards from 

Forsmark (Tröjbom and Söderbäck, 2006), and therefore carbonate minerals are 

abundant in the Quaternary deposits.

2002, reproduced with permission). 

 

At the bottom of surface water bodies such as streams, lakes or the Baltic Sea, and 

overlying the till deposit, glacial to post-glacial clays with organic matter-rich layers called 

gyttja are present. These are low permeability sediments basically composed of illite,

75 

calcite, organic detritus and minor amounts of pyrite (Lokrantz and Hedenström, 2006; 

Vikström, 2005). 

In general, groundwater flows in Quaternary deposits from elevated inland areas towards 

the Baltic Sea, with local discharge into the water courses that feed lakes and wetlands 

(Johansson et al., 2005). Hydrogeological investigations reveal that hydraulic connections 

between Quaternary deposits and the granitic bedrock could be in a downward direction 

(Bosson and Berglund, 2006). Nevertheless, local upward flow paths, between bedrock 

and Quaternary deposits, are also believed to occur (Laaksoharju et al., 2008). 

 

3.4 Natural occurrence of uranium, strontium, caesium and 

radium at Forsmark 

The concentrations of the natural isotopes of the selected radionuclides (uranium, 

strontium, caesium and radium) at Forsmark have been studied. By comparing the 

concentration of these elements (both in aqueous and solid phases) with major elements, 

key geochemical processes that influence radionuclide mobility in the glacial clays may be 

depicted. This is a fundamental step in the process of building a sound hydrogeochemical 

conceptual model of the problem of interest. 

 

3.4.1 Uranium 

In shallow groundwaters of Forsmark, uranium concentrations range from 1.0 × 10
-4
 to 1.5 

× 10
-1
 ?mol·L

-1
. This wide range indicates variable redox conditions in the near-surface 

systems. Lake and stream waters at Forsmark have similar uranium concentrations (4.09 

× 10
-3
 to 1.57 × 10

-2
 ?mol·L

-1
; Tröjbom and Söderbäck, 2006). Uranium is commonly 

transported forming complexes with bicarbonate, phosphate, iron and dissolved organic 

carbon (DOC) (Grenthe et al., 1992). However, none of these ions shows clear correlation 

with uranium, suggesting that multiple geochemical processes are responsible for the 

mobility of uranium in these waters. The presence of calcite in most of the Quaternary 

sediments at Forsmark leads to the predominance of circum-neutral waters with 

considerable amounts of dissolved carbonates which, in turn, enhance the mobility of 

uranium in these near-surface waters. 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

76 

From elemental analysis of the solid phase of the Quaternary deposits, rough correlations 

between uranium and iron, manganese and phosphorous are observed, indicating that 

uranium could be associated with Fe-Mn oxides or phosphates. 

 

3.4.2 Strontium 

Strontium concentrations in shallow groundwaters range between 0.8 to 50 ?mol·L
-1

. 

Taking into account the interaction between water and the till and knowing that both Ca 

and Sr may be present in carbonates and exchangeable sites of clay minerals, a 

correlation between strontium and calcium is expected. Indeed, looking in detail at the 

shallow groundwaters composition in the study area, two different trends are observed 

when strontium concentrations are plotted against Ca (Figure 3.2). 

One trend involves high salinity waters (top right border of mixing trend, Figure 3.2), and 

represents a mixing trend. The other trend includes dilute waters, with a Sr/Ca (molar 

ratio) of 10
-4
 that is consistent with congruent dissolution of a Sr-bearing calcite in the solid 

phase. Bruno et al. (2002) obtained an average Sr/Ca (molar ratio) of 3.5 × 10
-3
 in a set of 

groundwaters from different environments.

3.4.3 Caesium 

Data on caesium concentrations are scarce in shallow groundwaters in the Forsmark 

area. Data on shallow groundwaters ranges from 5×10
–5

 to 1×10
–3

 ?mol·L
-1
 which reveals 

relatively low concentrations of caesium in natural waters. With the available data no clear 

correlations with other ions have been observed. Nevertheless, caesium is expected to be 

involved in cation exchange in interlayered clays like illite (Bradbury and Baeyens, 2000, 

among others). 

 

3.4.4 Radium 

Radium concentration in natural waters is usually very low, ranging from 10
-8
 to 10

-5
 

?mol·L
-1
. Among the 22 shallow groundwater samples collected in Forsmark for radium 

analysis (Tröjbom and Söderbäck, 2006) five were below detection limit for radium (1 × 

10
-8
 ?mol·L

-1
), and the maximum radium concentration reached was 1.09 × 10

-7
 ?mol·L

-1
. 

 

3.5 Reactive solute transport modelling 

The numerical simulations developed in this work rely on a hypothetical scenario where a 

radionuclide-bearing deep groundwater flows upwards, from the repository to the surface, 

reaching a glacial clay sediment located at the bottom of a lake or the Baltic Sea (Figure 

3.3). Glacial clays do not contact directly with the top of the granite; instead, a till deposit 

is always present between both geological materials (Figure 3.3). In order to evaluate the 

hydrogeochemical processes that take place in a glacial clay and influence radionuclide 

mobility, deep groundwater is assumed to flow through a preferential path of the till 

deposit (fracture) that contacts directly the bottom of the glacial clay layer. 

It should be noted that the numerical model developed aims at depicting a realistic 

evolution of radionuclide mobility within the glacial clay at Forsmark and is based on site 

specific data whenever possible, although it considers a hypothetical scenario. 

The reactive solute transport simulations have been performed with the finite-difference 

code PHAST v. 1.4.2 (Parkhurst et al., 2004). This code is the result of coupling a 

transport solver, HST3D (Kipp, 1997) and the well known geochemical code, PHREEQC 

(Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999). PHAST is able to simulate multi-component, reactive solute 

transport in three-dimensional saturated groundwater flow systems. The reactive transport 

equations are solved by sequential non iterative approach (SNIA) in which solute transport

and chemical reaction are decoupled for each time step. Previous static geochemical 

simulations were conducted to define proper and consistent initial and boundary 

conditions of the reactive solute transport simulations.

The thermodynamic database used in the present work (Duro et al., 2006a) is an 

extension of the NAGRA-PSI database, compiled by Hummel et al. (2002). This database 

contains a large set of complexation reactions as well as pure mineral equilibrium 

reactions for many radionuclides and trace elements. 

 

3.5.1 Hydrodynamic processes and parameters 

According to the findings of the site characterization programme developed by SKB, 

glacial clays present at Forsmark are low permeability porous sediments that behave as 

aquitards located between the till aquifers and the surface water bodies (Johansson et al., 

2005). Table 3.1 shows average values of the hydrodynamic parameters that were used 

in the numerical simulations of this work.

3.5.2 Geochemical processes and parameters 

The capacity of the near-surface systems to retain radionuclides depends mainly on the 

mineral assemblages present, which in turn, enable radionuclide sorption on, precipitation 

or co-precipitation with major element solid phases. Sorption and precipitation are 

controlled by the groundwater composition. In general, radionuclide retention is provided 

by (i) sorption on charged surfaces (mainly clays and oxyhydroxides); (ii) co-precipitation 

with sulphates, sulphides, oxyhydroxides and carbonates; (iii) redox retention processes 

and (iv) sorption onto organic tissues. In some cases, precipitation of pure phases (e.g., 

amorphous uraninite) can also be relevant despite the relatively low concentrations of 

these radionuclides. Since the objective of this work is the quantitative assessment of 

radionuclide retention in glacial clay sediments, radioactive decay was not considered in 

the numerical simulations. 

According to Hedenström (2004), at Forsmark, the glacial clays present in the lake 

sediments and the Baltic Sea have considerable amounts of illite, quartz and calcite. 

Quartz and illite have very slow precipitation/dissolution kinetics under the pH and pe 

conditions that prevail in the glacial clays at Forsmark (Köhler et al., 2003). Therefore, 

from the observed minerals only calcite was included as a reactive solid phase in the 

numerical simulations, and, given that no reactivity was considered for illite, this mineral 

was simulated solely as a charged surface for cation exchange. 

From the four radionuclides selected, caesium and strontium are considered to exchange 

in illite sites. In the numerical simulations, the model for cation exchange in illite is that 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

80 

proposed by Bradbury and Baeyens (2000) with some modifications (see Appendix 1, and 

Grandia et al., 2007 for further details). The proposed model considers three types of 

sites: planar sites, type II sites and frayed edge sites (FES). Divalent cations (Ca
2+

, Mg
2+

, 

Sr
2+

) only exchange in the planar sites, while monovalent cations (Na
+
, K

+
, NH4

+
 and Cs

+
) 

may exchange in all the types of sites. Cs
+
 is known to have high affinity for the FES 

(Bradbury and Baeyens, 2000, among others). Assuming a 50 wt% of illite in the glacial 

clays at Forsmark, with a cation exchange capacity of 0.2 eq·kgsolid
-1
, as reported by 

Bradbury and Baeyens (2000), a constant concentration of 0.1 mol·kgsolid
-1
 of total cation 

exchange sites in illite has been considered in the numerical simulations. 

As mentioned above, calcite is present in the glacial clays and is likely to incorporate trace 

amounts of strontium. Therefore, a non-ideal calcite-strontianite solid solution (Tesoriero 

and Pankow, 1996) has been considered to be present in the glacial clay. From the mean 

CaCO3 content of 26 wt% measured in the glacial clays at Forsmark (SKB 2005), and 

considering that only an external thin rim of the calcite grains (corresponding to 5% of total 

calcite) is available to react with the porewater, an initial amount of 0.8 wt% of calcite-

strontianite solid solution (which corresponds to ~0.8 mol·Lwater
-1
) has been prescribed in 

the numerical simulations. In addition, and since the studied groundwaters are rich in 

aqueous carbonate, Fe(III) carbonate complexes have been added to the thermodynamic 

database (Grivé, 2005).

No data on pyrite content in glacial clays are available for Forsmark. Nevertheless, pyrite 

is known to form in lake sediments similar to the ones under study (Percival et al., 2001). 

In addition, elemental concentrations of sulphur in the solid phase of lake sediments at 

Forsmark can be up to 3.3 wt% (Hedenström, 2004). Therefore, and taking into account 

the predominant reducing conditions of the glacial clays at Forsmark, an initial 

concentration of 1.2 wt% of pyrite (which corresponds to approximately 1 mol·Lwater
-1
 of 

pyrite) has been prescribed in the numerical model.

Siderite (FeCO3) is also not mentioned in data related to the mineralogy of glacial clays at 

Forsmark. This mineral is redox sensitive and can precipitate in the glacial clay domain 

after the inflow of a reducing and Fe-rich deep groundwater. Therefore, siderite is allowed 

to precipitate in the simulations if oversaturation with this mineral is reached. 

Uranium occurs in nature mainly as two oxidation states: U(IV) and U(VI). The former is 

rather immobile so that reducing waters are not able to transport much uranium 

(Langmuir, 1997). Amorphous uraninite, a U(IV) solid phase, could form in a glacial clay 

sediment if repository-derived uranium interacts with potentially reducing porewaters. On 

the other hand, if repository-derived uranium reaches oxidising conditions, its mobility 

could be enhanced and soluble U(VI) hydroxide and particularly carbonate complexes 

may form. 

In shallow aquatic environments containing organic matter, U(VI) may be complexed by 

organic compounds and also reduced and immobilized as U(IV). The glacial clays at 

Forsmark usually contain considerable concentrations of organic matter in which humic 

acids are most probably present; and therefore, U(VI) humic complexes have been added 

to the thermodynamic database used in the reactive transport simulations. The cations 

considered for complexation with humic acids are calcium and uranium. The reactions and 

thermodynamic constants for these species are listed in Table 3.3.

The formation of solid solutions of Ba-Ca-Sr sulphates and carbonates is considered to be 

the solubility-limiting process for radium in natural waters (Grandia et al., 2008; and 

references therein). In many aqueous systems, radium is quantitatively co-precipitated 

with barium sulphate (barite, BaSO4) due to the chemical similarity between radium and 

barium. In the numerical simulations, an ideal solid solution between BaSO4 and RaSO4 is 

let to form if saturation with barite is reached. 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

82 

According to the processes identified to occur in the glacial clays at Forsmark that may 

influence radionuclide mobility, the reactive minerals considered in the numerical 

simulations are listed in Table 3.4. It should be noted that the saturation index of relevant 

pure phases that may incorporate the studied radionuclides was calculated and monitored 

during previous simulations. The monitored phases are becquerelite 

(Ca(UO2)6O4(OH)6:8H2O), schoepite (UO3·nH2O) and soddyite ((UO2)2SiO4·2H2O) (for U); 

celestite (SrSO4) and strontianite (SrCO3) (for Sr); and radium sulphate (RaSO4) (for Ra). 

Since saturation with these phases was not reached under the geochemical conditions 

modelled, these minerals were discarded for further numerical calculations. 

In Table A1.2 of Appendix 1, the dissolution reactions of the minerals considered in the 

numerical simulations are listed.

3.5.3 Initial and boundary conditions 

The numerical model simulates the water flow and geochemical processes that occur in a 

glacial clay layer located underneath a surface water body that constitutes a discharge 

area of the till aquifer. Therefore, the flow conditions prescribed for the glacial clay depend 

on the flow conditions in the surrounding till aquifer. In order to evaluate the flow directions 

that occur in such a glacial clay layer and according to the hydrologic water balance 



III. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in glacial clays related to groundwater discharge areas 

83 

calculations performed for the Forsmark site (Johansson et al. 2005), a preliminary 

numerical model with a clay layer located at the right top corner of a till domain was built. 

In this previous model a shallow groundwater inflow of 14.5 L·d
-1
 at the left boundary, and 

a deep groundwater inflow of 0.25 L·d
-1
 was set. The numerical model of the glacial clay 

was then built based on the flow directions and hydraulic heads attained in the preliminary 

numerical model (Figure 3.4). 

The modelled domain of the glacial clay is a 2D symmetric vertical cross section of a 

glacial clay that may be present at groundwater discharge areas of Forsmark (Figure 3.4). 

Based on the description of lake sediments (Johansson et al., 2005), the thickness of the 

glacial clay was set to 1 m. Shallow groundwater in equilibrium with the glacial clay 

mineralogy enters the modelled domain through the left and bottom boundaries. Deep 

groundwater enters the modelled domain at the bottom right corner (Figure 3.4). The 

water flowing in this domain flows out through the whole top boundary.

The reactive transport model built in this work simulates aqueous speciation and 

geochemical reactions between solid and aqueous phases all under local equilibrium. To 

compute the initial state of a reactive transport model the code used firstly equilibrates the 

initial porewater with the reactive minerals considered. Therefore, and in order to critically 

analyse the output of the initial equilibration, we have performed previous static 

calculations in PHREEQC (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999) to define the initial porewater and 

boundary waters equilibrated with the minerals most likely to control the composition of 

these waters that have been identified in the previous section. 

According to the main reactive minerals defined for the modelled domain, the composition 

of the glacial clay porewater has been obtained after equilibration of a selected sample of 

lake sediments porewater at Forsmark, with calcite, siderite and pyrite (Table 3.5). As this 

porewater is already close to the equilibrium with these minerals, the resulting 

composition is very similar to the sampled water. The redox state of the solution is 

controlled by the Fe(III)/pyrite pair. 

The composition of the deep groundwater prior to repository release was set by 

equilibrating a selected deep groundwater sample from Forsmark with calcite and pyrite. 

This equilibration does not change much the original deep groundwater composition, 

since this water sample is close to the equilibrium with the selected phases. The 

composition of deep groundwater affected by repository release is modified by adding 

repository-derived radionuclides (
RD

Sr, 
RD

Cs, 
RD

U and Ra, Table 3.5). In order to 

distinguish repository-derived radionuclides from those of natural origin, already present in 

the glacial clay porewater at Forsmark, radionuclides coming from repository were 

labelled as 
RD

Cs, 
RD

Sr, and 
RD

U in the model (RD stands for Repository-Derived). Radium 

has not been labelled since the presence of this radionuclide in the modelled domain is 

exclusively attributed to the release from the repository due to the extremely low 

concentrations observed in the natural waters at the Quaternary sediments of Forsmark. 

The simulated flow conditions are constant in time, and therefore, the system is modelled 

under steady state for hydrodynamic processes, but not for geochemical processes. The 

hydrochemistry and geochemistry of the glacial clay are expected to vary due to the inflow 

of a deep groundwater with different composition than the clay porewater.

The simulated flow conditions are constant in time, and therefore, the system is modelled 

under steady state for hydrodynamic processes, but not for geochemical processes. The 

hydrochemistry and geochemistry of the glacial clay are expected to vary due to the inflow 

of a deep groundwater with different composition than the clay porewater. 

The characterization programme for Forsmark candidate site has identified discharge 

areas related to surface water bodies where mixing between shallow groundwaters and 

deep groundwaters occurs. This means that the geochemical processes triggered by such 

mixing have been occurring for the past thousands of years (at least since the present 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

86 

topography at Forsmark has formed, Berglund et al., 2009), leading to the present-day 

hydrogeochemical conditions. 

In order to reach a geochemical quasi-steady state that represents the present-day 

hydrogeochemical conditions of the glacial clays at Forsmark, a long period of reactive 

transport (2700 years) with the natural composition of clay porewater and deep 

groundwater flowing through the modelled domain (according to the boundary conditions 

shown in Figure 3.4) has been simulated. After attaining the geochemical quasi-steady 

state, repository release is simulated (for additional 2700 years more) by adding 
RD

U, 

RD
Sr, 

RD
Cs and Ra to the deep groundwater that is flowing through the modelled domain 

(according to the values listed in Table 3.5). 

Repository release is simulated according to a very pessimistic scenario, where the 

~500 m of granitic bedrock (between the repository and the lake deposits) and the 

engineered barriers of the repository are assumed to have a very low retention capacity 

over radionuclides, which is highly unlikely. In this context, radionuclide concentrations 

calculated for the near-field of the repository (Duro et al., 2006b), i.e., the vicinity of the 

canisters that contain the HLNW, are applied directly as the input concentrations in the 

present numerical simulations. Following this methodology, the concentration of 
RD

Sr and 

RD
U in the deep groundwater was calculated by equilibrating the selected deep 

groundwater sample with their solubility limiting phases, which correspond to celestite and 

amorphous uraninite, respectively. The resulting aqueous concentration is 8.4×10

Since the solubility limiting phases for Ra and 
RD

Cs in the near-field of a HLNW repository 

are difficult to define, it was decided to calculate the corresponding concentrations from 

the radioactive release doses estimated for both radionuclides at the near-field (SKB, 

2006). The reported releases are 2×10

 for

and the Avogadro constant, the release doses can be converted into the following

respectively. 

These radionuclide concentrations are very high, considering that it is known that the 

engineered barriers and granitic bedrock should be able to retain much of these 

radionuclides. Nevertheless, since the objective of the study is to evaluate the retention 

capacity of the glacial clay sediments at Forsmark, such an extreme (pessimistic) scenario 

has been assumed.

3.5.4 Spatial and time discretisation 

Spatial discretisation of the modelled domain was set 0.1 m along both axes (X and Y) for 

the whole domain. 

As detailed in the previous section, there are two important time stages regarding the 

chemical condition of the system: (i) the first stage occurs at the beginning of the 

simulation period, when deep groundwater flows into the modelled domain and triggers 

major geochemical changes until a new geochemical quasi-steady state is reached, and 

(ii) the second stage occurs when the increased concentration of radionuclides in deep 

groundwater (that simulates repository release) disturbs the previous geochemical state. 

According to these time stages, time discretisation was refined at the beginning of the 

simulation period, then set progressively coarser until approximately 2700 years, and then 

refined again when the inflow of repository-derived radionuclides takes place. Then, time 

discretisation becomes coarser until the end of the simulation period. 

To ensure numerical stability in the solute transport calculations, the Peclet criterion 

(Pe?2) is met for the spatial discretisation of the modelled domain (?X =0.1 m with a 

longitudinal dispersivity = 0.5 m, and ?Y =0.1 m with a transverse dispersivity = 0.2 m). 

The Peclet number is a dimensionless number which compares the characteristic time for 

dispersion and diffusion given a length scale with its characteristic time for advection, and 

is given by the following equation:

where Pe is the Peclet number, v is water velocity (obtained by dividing Darcy’s velocity 

over the effective porosity) in units of [LT
-1
], ?x is the spatial discretization along the X 

axis, Dxx is the dispersion-coefficient tensor in units of [L
2
T], and ?x is the dispersivity 

along the X axis in [L]. If the Peclet criterion is fulfilled, numerical oscillations should not 

occur (Unger et al., 1996).

3.6 Results 

3.6.1 Transport of conservative and reactive solutes 

The transport of solutes in the modelled domain is affected by geochemical processes 

and the groundwater flow generated from the prescribed initial and boundary conditions. 

The conservative solute transport has been predicted using chlorine as a tracer, given that 

no retention process has been implemented for this element. Computed breakthrough 

curves of solutes have been analysed at the top right node of the discharge boundary of 

the modelled domain where the fastest arrival of solutes to a hypothetical overlying 

surface water body is expected. According to the computed chlorine breakthrough curve 

the travel time of the problem is 34 years, from the deep groundwater inflow point to the 

discharge area of the modelled domain (Figure 3.5).

3.6.2 Present-day hydrogeochemical conditions 

Long term simulations of groundwater flow and reactive solute transport (2700 years) with 

the selected minerals were done in order to reproduce the present-day hydrogeochemical 

conditions at Forsmark. Model results led to background concentrations of uranium, 

strontium, and caesium that are highly consistent with the values observed in the near-

surface systems at Forsmark. 

During the approach to the present-day hydrogeochemical conditions different processes 

that influence the behaviour of the natural isotopes of the studied radionuclides may be 

depicted which help us to understand the expected mobility of these radionuclides in the 

glacial clays at Forsmark. Figure 3.6 (a) shows that at the beginning of the simulation, a 

slight decrease of U(aq) is computed for the discharge area of the glacial clay. During this 

period no uranium pure phase is formed and therefore, the computed evolution of U(aq) is 

solely attributed to mixing which leads to its dilution. This slight decrease is due to the fact 

that U(aq) concentration in deep groundwater is approximately half an order of magnitude 

lower than in the glacial clay porewater (Table 3.5). Sr(aq) concentration in deep 

groundwater is approximately one order of magnitude higher than in the glacial clay 

porewater and, although the numerical simulation computes the retention of strontium in 

the solid phase via co-precipitation with calcite and adsorption on illite, Sr(aq) 

concentration increases from 0.6 ?mol·L
-1
 (glacial clay porewater concentration, Table 

3.5) to 20 ?mol·L
-1
. The continuous, but progressively slower, increase of the Sr(aq) 

concentration at the discharge (Figure 3.6(b)) area reflects the decreasing capacity of illite 

and calcite to incorporate more strontium along time, since available exchange sites 

especially in illite become more and more scarce. Cs(aq) concentration in deep 

groundwater is approximately two and a half orders of magnitude higher than in the clay 

porewater. Computed Cs(aq) concentration increases during the first 250 years (Figure 

3.6(c)), followed by a progressive decrease towards a quasi-steady state value of 5.7 × 

10
-4
 ?mol·L

-1
 . In the first stage, cation exchange in illite is not able to buffer the increment 

of Cs(aq) in solution due to deep groundwater inflow, but with increasing time Cs(aq) is 

progressively retained in a larger area of the modelled domain and, therefore, its 

concentration at the discharge boundary tends to decrease.

Cs(aq) during the approach to the geochemical quasi-steady state that represents the 

present-day conditions of the glacial clays at Forsmark (observation node: X= 10 m; Y= 1 

m). The concentrations at 2700 years are in the range of concentrations observed nowadays 

which are reported in the forth section of this work. 

 

In Figure 3.7 it is possible to see that after the approach to the present-day 

hydrogeochemical conditions (2700 years of reactive transport), simulated data for 

strontium against calcium and for uranium against bicarbonate plot within the range of 

measured data. 

Measured data for uranium and bicarbonate at Forsmark show a considerable wide range 

of values (Figure 3.7a). Simulated data plot close to the lowest content of these elements 

measured at Forsmark (Figure 3.7a). Simulated data for strontium against calcium (Figure 

3.7b) plot along the mixing trend and the dilute waters trend previously reported in Figure 

3.2. The deep groundwater is more mineralised than the glacial clay porewater and 

therefore, the more diluted simulated compositions correspond to the points of the 

modelled domain that are more distant to the deep groundwater inflow point, while the 

more mineralised simulated compositions, with higher strontium and calcium content, are 

closer to the deep groundwater inflow point (Figure 3.7c). 



III. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in glacial clays related to groundwater discharge areas 

91 

Data for caesium at Forsmark are scarce and therefore no graphic is shown here. 

Nevertheless it is possible to see that the concentration of caesium flowing out of the 

modelled domain after 2700 years of reactive transport (5.7 × 10

 in Figure 3.6c) 

is within the range of data actually measured at Forsmark (5×10

These results prove the ability of the numerical model to reproduce the hydrogeochemical

the glacial clay deposit. 

The concentration of

U(aq) in the deep groundwater affected by repository release is

 which is one and a half orders of magnitude higher than the natural 

concentration of U(aq) in deep groundwater and 30% higher than in the glacial clay 

porewater. 2700 years after repository release, 87% of uranium flowing out of the glacial 

clay to the surface water body comes from repository release (Figure 3.8). 

Simulated repository release induces an increase of total U(aq) concentration in the 

glacial clay porewater. This increase, combined with the prevailing reducing conditions of 

the glacial clay, triggers the precipitation of amorphous uraninite. When amorphous 

uraninite precipitates, both repository-derived and natural uranium are incorporated in this 

mineral phase. It should be noted that, although humic acids and aqueous carbonates are 

present in the glacial clay porewater, favouring uranium aqueous complexation, the 

predominantly reducing conditions of the glacial clays provide the precipitation of 

amorphous uraninite which leads to the retention of 
RD

U in the solid phase.

95 

 

The decrease of Ra(aq) concentration from the deep groundwater inflow point to the 

discharge area of the glacial clay is mainly due to dilution, since the glacial clay 

groundwater flowing through the modelled domain carries no radium in solution. 

The geochemical processes considered to occur in the glacial clays at Forsmark have 

been proved able to efficiently retain

U, 
RD

Sr and 
RD

Cs. On the other hand, with the 

geochemical process assumed to interact with radium, no retention is computed for this 

radionuclide since barite saturation is not reached during the simulation time. 

Retention of 
RD

U, 
RD

Sr and

Cs in the glacial clay has been quantitatively assessed by 

defining a retention efficiency parameter. The retention efficiency (E) of the system under

 stands for 

the concentration of the same solute at time ?, in the same position, but without 

considering any reactive process coupled to the transport equation (i.e. assuming 

conservative behaviour of the solute). 

According to equation 3.2, a null reactive concentration (CR
?
) means that no mass of 

radionuclide is leaving the system at time ?, resulting in a retention efficiency of 100%. A 

reactive concentration (CR
?
) equal to the conservative concentration (CC

?
) means that no 

retention is occurring and that the corresponding retention efficiency is 0%. Negative 

efficiency means that in the reactive transport, the solid phase is releasing a previously 

retained species into solution, and therefore reactive concentration is higher than 

conservative concentration (CR

?
).

instead, it is retained via precipitation of a pure phase. The computed evolution of 

retention efficiency for

U reflects the equilibrium with amorphous uraninite which leads 

the system to a stable efficiency value of 50%. Immediately after repository release, the

Sr drops to 20% which reflects the progressive decreasing capacity of illite

Cs is 100% during the whole 

simulation time.

3.7 Conclusions 

The present work has focused on the coupled hydrogeochemical processes that occur in 

the Quaternary glacial clays observed in the groundwater discharge areas at Forsmark, 

which may contribute to the retention of radionuclides potentially released from a 

repository. Numerical simulations of groundwater flow and reactive solute transport are 

able to reproduce the observed natural concentrations of uranium, strontium and caesium 

at the Forsmark site. These results prove the reliability of the conceptual and numerical 

models developed. Natural concentration of radium at Forsmark shallow groundwaters is 

extremely low so that its natural occurrence has been neglected in the numerical 

simulations. 

The simulation of pessimistic scenarios of repository release has shown that the glacial 

clays, present in the groundwater discharge areas at Forsmark, have geochemical 

features that contribute to the effective retention of radionuclides. Numerical results 

allowed the development of a methodology for estimating radionuclide retention efficiency 

of the Quaternary glacial clays. 



III. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in glacial clays related to groundwater discharge areas 

97 

Computed results show that only uranium, strontium, and caesium are effectively retained 

in the solid phase of the glacial clays at Forsmark. Retention of radium is not predicted 

because barite precipitation, which is the only process considered to retain this 

radionuclide, is not reached during the simulated period and the mobilised Ra(II) 

concentrations are not sufficient to reach saturation with respect to pure RaSO4(s) 

phases. 

Numerical results show that when repository release is simulated, precipitation of 

amorphous uraninite is triggered by the increase of U(aq) concentration and therefore, 

both natural and repository-derived uranium are retained in the solid phase. This reaction 

leads to a steady retention efficiency for 
RD

U of 50%. 
RD

Sr is retained in the solid phase via 

cation exchange in illite and co-precipitation with calcite. Retention efficiency for 
RD

Sr is 

complete (100%) immediately after repository release, but it progressively drops to 20% 

after about 3000 years. Caesium shows high affinity for the frayed edge sites of illite which 

results in 100% retention efficiency during the whole simulation period.

Abstract 

The Quaternary sediments representing the interface between the granite host rock and 

the Earth surface are of paramount importance when determining the potential cycling of 

anthropogenic and natural radionuclides in near-surface systems. This is particularly true 

in the case of high-level nuclear waste (HLNW) repositories placed in granite. In this work 

we present a modelling procedure to quantitatively determine the retention capacity of a 

Quaternary till in the Forsmark area, which has been recently selected to host the deep 

geologic storage of HLNW in Sweden. Reactive transport numerical models have been 

used to simulate the intrusion of a deep groundwater carrying radionuclides potentially 

released from a repository into a Quaternary till. Four radionuclides (
235

U, 
135

Cs, 
226

Ra and 

90
Sr) have been selected according to their different geochemical behaviour and potential 

dose relevance to surface ecosystems. Numerical results indicate that repository-derived 

(i) uranium will have a minor impact in the till, mainly due to the high natural concentration 

of uranium and its adsorption on ferrihydrite; (ii) caesium will be efficiently retained by 

cation exchange in illite; (iii) radium will be retained via co-precipitation with barite; and 

although (iv) strontium will be retained via co-precipitation with calcite and cation 

exchange in illite, the retention capacity of the Quaternary till for strontium is limited.

Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

104 

4.1 Introduction 

The concepts of deep geological disposal for HLNW are designed to retard for long 

periods of time (~10,000 years after closure) the migration of radionuclides to the surface 

(SKB, 2006). A deep geological repository for HLNW consists of a deep repository (~500 

m depth) composed of engineered (metal canisters, clay barriers, cement liners) and 

natural (host rocks) barriers that prevent the intrusion of groundwaters and further 

dissolution of radionuclides from the HLNW. In performance and safety assessments of 

these repositories, scenarios of barrier failure and subsequent release of radionuclides to 

the surrounding environment are under investigation. 

The Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB) has been studying 

two alternative sites (Forsmark and Laxemar) to locate a deep geological repository for 

HLNW and has recently selected the Forsmark area for the final emplacement. The host 

rock for the repository in both sites is a metagranitoid covered by glacial and post-glacial 

Quaternary sediments. In case of repository release, the Quaternary sediments present at 

the Earth’s surface/granite interface, constitute the last geological barrier prior to the 

surface biosphere. The radionuclide solubility control of surface sediments and soils is 

well known from present-day analogues of possible future releases from deep 

repositories. The best investigated example of these analogues is the Hanford site 

(Washington, USA) (Zachara et al., 2002; McKinley et al., 2007; Um et al., 2007; among 

others). 

In the last years, reactive transport numerical models have been applied to solve different 

environmental problems such as large-scale models of transport in fractured media 

(Molinero et al., 2008), geochemical evolution of engineered barriers (Arcos et al., 2008), 

organic contaminant biodegradation (Prommer et al., 2006), acid mine drainage (Bain et 

al., 2000), among many others. Numerical tools are especially useful when dealing with 

long-term performance assessment of deep geological repositories, mainly due to the 

possibility of coupling (i) groundwater flow, (ii) transport of solutes and (iii) complex 

geochemical processes, for long time spans. In the present work, reactive transport 

numerical models have been used to simulate the intrusion of a deep groundwater 

carrying radionuclides potentially released from a repository into a Quaternary till. The 

outcomes of the simulations have provided a quantitative assessment of the retention 

capacity of the Quaternary till at Forsmark for selected radionuclides. 

 



IV. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in the Quaternary sediments/granite interface of the Fennoscandian shield (Sweden) 

105 

4.1.1 Scope 

The retention of selected radionuclides in the Quaternary sediments/granite interface of 

the Fennoscandian shield (Sweden) is assessed in the present work by means of reactive 

transport numerical simulations. The radionuclides selected are: 
235

U as a redox-sensitive 

actinide; 
135

Cs as a monovalent cation that participates in cation exchange in illite and also 

because it is an important contributor of radioactive doses to the surface systems (SKB, 

2006); 
90

Sr as a divalent cation that interacts with carbonate minerals and participates in 

cation exchange in illite; and, 
226

Ra as the main contributor of radioactive doses to the 

surface systems (SKB, 2006). 

Till is the most abundant outcropping Quaternary deposit at Forsmark (~75% of surface 

extension, SKB, 2005a) and, therefore, it was selected in the present work for the 

assessment of radionuclide retention in the Quaternary sediments/granite interface of the 

Fennoscandian shield. 

The methodology applied here relies on six main steps: (1) a thorough review of site 

specific data that describe the hydrogeochemical behaviour of the system under study; (2) 

development of the conceptual model of the system based on data gathered in the first 

step; (3) identification and quantification of the thermodynamic parameters that describe 

the geochemical processes of interest; (4) implementation and verification against 

measured data of the conceptual model in reactive transport numerical simulations; (5) 

simulation of a hypothetical repository release in the numerical model; and, (6) 

quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in the modelled system based on the 

outputs of the numerical simulations. 

Site specific data that describe the hydraulic, hydrochemical and geochemical present-day 

conditions of the Quaternary till at Forsmark have been thoroughly analysed from the SKB 

database of the Forsmark Site Characterization Program (SKB, 2005a). The conceptual 

model of the Quaternary till was then implemented in a reactive transport numerical model 

in order to reproduce the present-day conditions observed at the near-surface systems at 

Forsmark. Once the present-day hydrogeochemical conditions of the Quaternary till at 

Forsmark have been modelled, a hypothetical repository release was simulated by a 

continuous injection, during approximately 2500 years, of a deep groundwater carrying 

repository-derived radionuclides into the modelled domain. Finally, from the outputs of the 

numerical simulations, the retention of radionuclides in the Quaternary till has been 

assessed.

4.2 Near-surface hydrogeology at Forsmark 

The Forsmark area belongs to the Fennoscandian shield predominantly made up with 

metagranitoids and metavolcanics of Precambrian age, which are affected by ductile 

structures and a dense fracture network. More recently, the alternation of glacial and 

interglacial stages during the Quaternary period led to the deposition of glacial deposits 

that cover more than 80% of the surface (SKB, 2005b). 

The near-surface hydrogeology at Forsmark is composed of Quaternary deposits, with an 

average thickness of 3 m that host unconfined aquifers discharging into streams, lakes or 

the Baltic Sea. Groundwater in the granitic bedrock flows mainly along fractures and 

deformation zones composed of loose granitic material and coatings of calcite, chlorite, 

quartz and pyrite (Drake et al., 2006). 

In general, the till deposit consists of sand with variable amounts of boulders and clay 

(Albrecht, 2005). The origin of this till is associated with the glacial erosion, transport and 

deposition of Palaeozoic carbonate rocks located northwards from Forsmark (Tröjbom 

and Söderbäck, 2006), and therefore carbonate minerals are abundant in the Quaternary 

deposits. The mean calcite content in the Quaternary till is 24 wt% (SKB, 2005a). Besides 

calcite, quartz and illite have also been identified in the mineralogical assemblage of the 

Quaternary till. 

Regional groundwater flows in Quaternary deposits from elevated inland areas towards 

the Baltic Sea, with local discharge into the water courses that feed lakes and wetlands 

(Johansson et al., 2005). Hydrogeological investigations reveal that hydraulic connections 

between Quaternary deposits and the granitic bedrock could be in a downward direction 

(Bosson and Berglund, 2006). Nevertheless, local upward flow paths, between bedrock 

and Quaternary deposits, are also believed to occur (Laaksoharju et al., 2008). 

 

4.3 Model development 

The retention capacity of the Quaternary till at Forsmark is evaluated, for selected 

radionuclides (uranium, caesium, strontium, and radium), using reactive transport 

numerical simulations. The code used for the simulations is PHAST v. 1.4.2 (Parkhurst et 

al., 2004). The geochemical simulations conducted to define the initial and boundary 

conditions of the reactive transport simulations were performed in PHREEQC v. 2.14.2 

(Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999). 



IV. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in the Quaternary sediments/granite interface of the Fennoscandian shield (Sweden) 

107 

The database used in the simulations is an extension of the NAGRA-PSI database, 

originally compiled by Hummel et al. (2002), which was made in the frame of the SKB’s 

project SKB-TDB (Duro et al., 2006a). This database contains a large set of complexation 

reactions as well as pure mineral equilibrium reactions for many radionuclides and trace 

elements. 

The numerical simulations developed in this work rely on a hypothetical scenario where a 

radionuclide-bearing, deep groundwater flows upwards from the repository to the surface, 

reaching the Quaternary till (Figure 4.1). It should be noted that the numerical model 

developed aims at depicting a realistic evolution of the Quaternary till at Forsmark and is 

based on site specific data whenever possible, although it considers a hypothetical 

scenario.

mobility in the Quaternary till.

 (Tröjbom and Söderbäck, 2006). This wide range indicates variable 

redox conditions in the near-surface systems. Uranium is commonly transported forming 

complexes with bicarbonate, phosphate, iron and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) 

(Grenthe et al., 1992). However, none of these ions shows clear correlation with uranium 

at Forsmark, suggesting that multiple geochemical processes are responsible for the 

mobility of uranium in these waters. The presence of calcite in most of the Quaternary till 

at Forsmark leads to the predominance of circum-neutral waters with considerable 

amounts of dissolved carbonates which, in turn, enhance the mobility of uranium in these 

near-surface waters. From elemental analysis of the solid phase of the Quaternary 

deposits, rough correlations between uranium and iron, manganese and phosphorous are 

observed, indicating that uranium could be associated with Fe-Mn oxides or phosphates.

with a Sr/Ca (molar ratio) of 10

no clear correlations with other ions have been observed. Nevertheless, caesium is 

expected to be involved in cation exchange in interlayered clays like illite (Bradbury and 

Baeyens, 2000, among others).

4.3.2 Hydrodynamic processes and parameters 

According to the findings of the site characterization programme developed by SKB, the 

till deposit hosts unconfined porous aquifers with stratified hydraulic conductivity and 

porosity (Johansson et al., 2005). In Table 4.1 the mean values of the hydrodynamic 

parameters of the Quaternary till implemented in the numerical model are listed.

4.3.3 Geochemical processes and parameters 

The geochemical processes considered in the numerical simulations are based on the 

characterization of the Quaternary sediments at Forsmark, and on the present-day 

knowledge of the thermodynamic behaviour of the studied radionuclides. The retention 

capacity of the till for the selected radionuclides depends on the geochemical processes 

considered. Finally, since the main objective of this work is the evaluation of the retention 

of radionuclides in the till, radioactive decay of the selected radionuclides is not 

considered. 

Given the strong correlation between strontium and calcium observed in the dilute shallow 

groundwaters at Forsmark (Figure 4.2), calcite is considered to contain trace amounts of 

strontianite forming a non-ideal solid solution (Tesoriero and Pankow, 1996) in the 

numerical simulations. 

The initial molar fraction of strontium in calcite results from equilibrating the calcite-

strontianite solid solution with the selected till groundwater sample. The parameters used 

for this solid solution are those of Tesoriero and Pankow (1996), and the resulting 

strontium molar fraction is 1.73 × 10
-5
. From the mean 24 wt% of calcite in the Quaternary 

till we have considered that only 6.2 v% are available to react with the porewater. This 6.2 

v% of reactive calcite correspond to the outer 0.05 mm rim of the 2  mm sized calcite 

grains that constitute the most of the calcite content of the Quaternary till. By multiplying 

the 24 wt% by 6.2v% we obtain 1.5 wt% of reactive calcite implemented in the numerical 

simulations. Since the studied groundwaters are rich in aqueous carbonate, Fe(III) 

carbonate complexes have been added to the thermodynamic database (Grivé, 2005). 

Although illite has been identified as the main clay mineral in the Quaternary till at 

Forsmark no data on illite content has been found, and therefore a 10 wt% as been 

considered for the numerical simulations. Illite dissolution kinetics is very slow under the 

environmental conditions modelled here (Köhler et al., 2003). Therefore, dissolution of 

illite is not considered, and it only participates as a charged surface for cation exchange, 

including strontium and caesium. The model for cation exchange in illite implemented in 

the numerical simulations follows the model proposed by Bradbury and Baeyens (2000) 

(see Table A1.1 in Appendix 1). According to this model (Bradbury and Baeyens, 2000), 

there are three types of exchangeable sites. The most abundant sites (~80% of CEC, 

which is 0.2 eq?kg
-1
) are the “Planar sites”, which sorb divalent and monovalent cations. 

The second and third types of sites (“Type II” and frayed edge sites “FES”) involve solely 

monovalent cations. The site density is much lower (20% and 0.25% of the total sites, 

respectively), but the uptake of some cations like Cs
+
 on the FES is particularly efficient. 



IV. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in the Quaternary sediments/granite interface of the Fennoscandian shield (Sweden) 

111 

Strontium is also expected to be involved in cation exchange in illite (e.g. Cole et al., 

2000), and therefore strontium was added to the cation exchange model implemented in 

the numerical simulations (see Table A1.1 in Appendix 1). 

It is very likely that other phases exist at minor concentrations, some of which can play an 

important role in the control of the redox conditions and radionuclide retention. Among 

these, ferrihydrite (Fe(OH)3) is thought to be the controlling phase for the redox of the till 

porewater and the main uranium sorbent. The surface complexation model followed is that 

of Waite et al. (1994) which considers two types of adsorption sites; strong and weak 

binding (see Table A1.3 in Appendix 1). 

According to the elemental content of Fe in the solid phase of the Quaternary till, ranging 

from 0.54 to 2.22 wt% (Tröjbom and Söderbäck, 2006), an initial content of 0.15 wt% of 

ferrihydrite has been set in the numerical simulations. 

Unlike illite, ferrihydrite is a much more reactive mineral, very sensitive to changes in the 

redox state of the system. Intrusion of deep groundwater in the till domain may lead to 

dissolution of ferrihydrite, and therefore, the total amount of sites available for adsorption, 

in the simulations, depends on the remaining moles of ferrihydrite for each time step. 

Siderite (FeCO3) is also redox sensitive and can precipitate in the till after the inflow of Fe-

rich deep groundwater which is more reducing than till porewater. Consequently, siderite 

is allowed to precipitate if oversaturation is reached. 

Till groundwater in Forsmark is very close to barite saturation, and the precipitation of this 

mineral (and radium co-precipitation) is expected due to the intrusion of deep groundwater 

with a relatively high sulphate concentration. 

Given the relatively fast reactivity of the reactive minerals previously identified, under the 

geochemical conditions simulated here, all geochemical reactions are simulated under 

local equilibrium. Table 4.2 lists the initial concentrations of the reactive minerals 

considered in the numerical simulations, as well as the radionuclides potentially 

incorporated in these minerals. 

The saturation index of relevant pure phases that may incorporate the studied 

radionuclides, was monitored during the simulations for the following phases: amorphous 

uraninite, becquerelite, schoepite and soddyite (for U); celestite and strontianite (for Sr); 

and radium sulphate (for Ra). None of these minerals attained oversaturation, and 

therefore, they were discarded from the simulations.

4.3.4 Initial and boundary conditions 

The numerical model represents a 2D vertical section of the Quaternary till that overlies 

the granitic bedrock at Forsmark. The bottom boundary of the modelled domain 

represents the contact between the till and the bedrock. In order to simulate the transfer of 

repository-derived radionuclides to the near-surface systems, a deep groundwater flowing 

upwards through a fracture of the granitic bedrock is assumed to transport dissolved 

radionuclides from the repository to the surface. The Quaternary till is assumed to be 

hydraulically connected to a discharge area such as a river, a lake or the Baltic Sea. 

According to the water balance calculations developed for Forsmark (Johansson et al., 

2005), a constant inflow rate of 14.5 L/d is assigned along the vertical left boundary. The 

fracture through which deep groundwater enters the till is represented by a constant inflow 

boundary at the bottom of the modelled domain (cell X= 20 m, Y= 0 m), with a flow rate of 

0.5 L/d. The discharge area is located in the last 20 m of the top boundary, with a constant 

head of 3 m (Figure 4.3).

The reactive transport model built in this work simulates aqueous speciation and 

geochemical reactions between solid and aqueous phases all under local equilibrium. To 

compute the initial state of a reactive transport model, the code used here firstly 

equilibrates the initial porewater with the reactive minerals considered. Therefore, and in 

order to critically analyse the output of the initial equilibration, we have performed previous 

static calculations in PHREEQC (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999) to define the initial 

porewater and boundary waters equilibrated with the minerals most likely to control the 

composition of these waters that have been identified in the previous section. 

The chemistry of the groundwater in equilibrium with the till deposit has been obtained 

after equilibration of a selected groundwater sample of the till aquifer with the reactive 

minerals identified in the previous section which are calcite-strontianite solid solution, 

ferrihydrite and siderite (Table 4.2). As the groundwater sample is close to the equilibrium 

with these minerals, the resulting composition does not differ much from the sampled 

water. In Table 4.3 the water composition of the Quaternary till obtained after such 

preliminary equilibration is shown. 

According to the minerals identified in the coatings of the granite fractures where deep 

groundwater flows (reported in section 4.2), the deep groundwater composition prior to 

repository release was set by equilibrating a selected deep groundwater sample from 

Forsmark with calcite and pyrite. This equilibration does not change much the original 

deep groundwater composition, since this water sample is close to the equilibrium with 

these phases. 

The composition of deep groundwater affected by repository release is modified due to 

the addition of repository-derived radionuclides (

Cs, 
235

U and 
226

The hydrodynamic boundary conditions are constant in time, and therefore, the system is 

modelled under steady state for flow, but the geochemistry of the till deposit is modelled 

under transient state due to the inflow of a more reducing and mineralised deep 

groundwater into the till domain. 



IV. Quantitative assessment of radionuclide retention in the Quaternary sediments/granite interface of the Fennoscandian shield (Sweden) 

115 

The characterization program for Forsmark site has identified discharge areas where 

mixing between shallow groundwaters and deep groundwaters occurs (Laaksoharju et al., 

2008). This means that the geochemical processes triggered by such mixing have been 

occurring for the past thousands of years; at least since the present topography at 

Forsmark has formed (Berglund et al., 2009), leading to the present-day 

hydrogeochemical conditions. 

In order to reach a geochemical quasi-steady state that represents the present-day 

hydrogeochemical conditions of the Quaternary till, a long period of reactive transport 

(2700 years) with the natural composition of till and deep groundwaters flowing through 

the modelled domain has been simulated. During this long period of reactive transport 

simulation, mixing between both groundwaters together with the products of the 

geochemical reactions triggered by such mixing, leads to a new geochemical equilibrium. 

After attaining the geochemical quasi-steady state, repository release is simulated by 

increasing the concentration of selected radionuclides in the deep groundwater that enters 

the till system at the bottom of the modelled domain. 

Repository release is simulated according to a very pessimistic scenario, where it is 

assumed that the ~500 m of granitic bedrock (located between the repository and the 

near-surface systems) and the engineered barriers of the repository do not have a 

significant retention capacity over radionuclides, which is highly unlikely. Therefore, 

radionuclide concentrations calculated for the near-field (Duro et al., 2006b), i.e., the 

vicinity of the canisters that contain the spent nuclear fuel, are applied directly as the input 

concentrations in the present numerical simulations. Following this methodology, the 

concentration of 
RD

Sr and 
RD

U in the deep groundwater was calculated by equilibrating the 

selected deep groundwater sample with their solubility limiting phases, which correspond 

to celestite and amorphous uraninite, respectively. The resulting concentrations of

Sr 

and 
RD

U are 8.4 ×10
-4
 mol·L

-1
 and 1.7 ×10

, respectively. 

Since the solubility limiting phases for Ra and 
RD

Cs in the near-field of a HLNW repository 

are difficult to define, it was decided to calculate the corresponding concentration from the 

radioactive release doses estimated for both radionuclides at the near-field (SKB, 2006).

dividing these values by the respective radioactive decay constants and the Avogadro

These radionuclide concentrations are very high, taking into account that the engineered 

barriers and granitic bedrock would be able to retain much of these radionuclides. 

Nevertheless, since the objective of the study is to evaluate the retention capacity of the 

Quaternary sediments, such an extreme scenario has been assumed. 

 

4.3.5 Spatial and time discretisation 

The spatial discretization of the modelled domain was set according to the main features 

of the boundary conditions, which influence groundwater flow and geochemistry. Spatial 

discretization was refined at the position of the deep groundwater inflow and under the 

discharge area (outflow boundary). 

As detailed in the previous section, there are two important stages regarding the chemical 

condition of the system: (i) the first stage occurs at the beginning of the simulation, when 

deep groundwater flows into the modelled domain and triggers major geochemical 

changes until the geochemical quasi-steady state is reached, and (ii) the second stage 

occurs when the increased concentration of radionuclides in the deep groundwater (that 

simulates repository release) disturbs the previous geochemical state. According to these 

stages, time discretization was refined at the beginning of each stage, and set 

progressively coarser towards the end of each stage. 

To ensure stability in the numerical calculations, the Peclet criterion (Pe?2) is met for the 

maximum ?X (maximum ?X =1 m, and longitudinal dispersivity = 0.5 m). 

 

4.4 Numerical results 

4.4.1 Present-day hydrogeochemical conditions 

The transport of solutes in the modelled domain is affected by geochemical processes 

and the groundwater flow generated from the prescribed initial and boundary conditions. 

The conservative transport has been studied using chlorine as a tracer, given that no 

retention has been implemented for this element. From the chlorine breakthrough curve, 

observed at the discharge area, an advective travel time of 2.3 years is obtained, from the

Measured data for uranium and bicarbonate at Forsmark show a considerable wide range 

of values (Figure 4.4a). Simulated data plot within the concentration range of these 

elements actually measured at Forsmark (Figure 4.4a). Similarly, simulated data for 

strontium against calcium (Figure 4.4b) plot close to the dilute waters trend previously 

reported in Figure 4.2. The dilute shallow groundwaters at Forsmark correspond to those 

shallow systems that are less influenced by deep groundwater discharge and sea water 

intrusion (Laaksoharju et al., 2008).

Data for caesium at Forsmark are scarce and no graphic is shown here. Nevertheless, 

model outputs show that the concentration of caesium (1 × 10
-10

 mol·L
-1
) flowing out of the 

Quaternary till when the present-day hydrogeochemical conditions have been reached 

(after 2700 years of reactive transport) are within the range of caesium concentrations 

observed nowadays at Forsmark, previously reported in section 4.3.1. 

 

4.4.2 Retention of repository-derived radionuclides 

Given the good agreement between measured data for reactive solutes such as 

bicarbonate, calcium, uranium, and strontium, and the outputs of the reactive transport 

model (previously shown in Figure 4.4) that was built to simulate the present-day 

hydrogeochemical conditions of the Quaternary till at Forsmark, the pessimistic scenario 

of repository release may now be simulated by adding repository-derived radionuclides to 

the deep groundwater that discharges into the till aquifer. 

Since the Fennoscandian shield is being subject to a regional uplift (SKB, 2005b) which 

triggers gradual changes of the topography and near-surface hydrology, in order to assure 

a relatively reliable scenario of repository release into the near-surface systems, a 

relatively short period (when compared to the safety assessment of a deep geological 

repository; ~100,000 years, SKB, 2006) of repository release has been simulated. In this 

context, the continuous inflow of repository-derived radionuclides into the Quaternary till 

has been simulated during 2700 years. 

Deep groundwater affected by repository release has a 
RD

U concentration which is ~1.5 

orders of magnitude higher than before repository release, and it is 23% lower than the 

natural uranium concentration in the till groundwater (2.23 × 10
-8
 mol·L

-1
). At the end of 

the simulation, only 1.8% of uranium flowing out of the till is derived from repository 

(Figure 4.5a). 
RD

U is retained in the till by adsorption on the ferrihydrite (Figure 4.5b). The 

relatively low impact of repository release on the concentration of aqueous uranium at the 

discharge area is mainly due to the high concentration of natural uranium in the till 

groundwater.

The results in the previous paragraphs show that the four repository-derived radionuclides 

under study are likely to be retained through different geochemical processes in the solid 

phase of the Quaternary till at Forsmark. The retention efficiency of the till deposit has 

been quantitatively evaluated by comparing the results computed in the conservative (no 

reactions between solid and aqueous phases) and reactive transport simulations. The 

retention efficiency parameter (E) of the system at a given time ? can be described 

according to equation 4.1:

The reactive transport simulations predict that, in case of repository release,

Sr, 
RD

Cs, 

RD
U and Radium would be retained in the till deposit (Figure 4.9). During the first 100 

years the till system reaches a retention efficiency of 100% for 
RD

Sr. Thereafter, retention 

efficiency for 
RD

Sr drops to 0%, ~1000 years after repository release, reflecting the limited 

capacity of illite and the Ca1-?Sr?CO3 solid solution to retain the added strontium. On the 

other hand, 
RD

Cs is efficiently retained (100%) during the whole simulation due to the high 

affinity of caesium for the FES of illite. 

When 
RD

U enters the till aquifer, the till is able to fully retain it (100% retention efficiency). 

Thereafter, retention efficiency for 
RD

U progressively decreases. This decrease is related 

to the fact that ferrihydrite dissolves during the simulation, due to the inflow of deep 

groundwater. Since uranium is retained via adsorption on ferrihydrite, as time passes 

there are progressively less available sites for uranium adsorption, and, consequently, 

retention efficiency for 
RD

U decreases. 

Radium is the only radionuclide that is not assumed to be involved in sorption reactions, 

and therefore, its retention efficiency reflects the evolution of the thermodynamic 

equilibrium between the aqueous phase and the precipitation of Ba1-?Ra?SO4 solid 

solution.

4.5 Conclusions 

Coupled hydrogeochemical processes that are believed to occur in the Quaternary till at 

Forsmark have been implemented in a numerical model to assess the retention of 

repository-derived radionuclides. Numerical simulations of groundwater flow and reactive 

solute transport are able to reproduce the observed natural concentrations of uranium, 

strontium and caesium at the Forsmark site which proves the reliability of the conceptual 

and numerical models developed here. Natural concentration of radium at Forsmark 

shallow groundwaters is extremely low so that its natural occurrence has been neglected 

in the numerical simulations. 

The simulation of a pessimistic scenario of a continuous repository release during 2700 

years has shown that the Quaternary till has geochemical features that contribute to the 

effective retention of radionuclides. Numerical results show that repository-derived 

uranium will have a minor impact in the Quaternary till, mainly due to the high natural 

concentration of uranium and its adsorption on ferrihydrite; caesium will be efficiently 

retained by cation exchange in illite; radium will be retained via co-precipitation with barite; 

and, although strontium is assumed to be retained through two geochemical processes 

(co-precipitation with calcite and cation exchange in illite), the retention capacity of the 

Quaternary till for strontium is limited. 

The quantitative assessment of the retention efficiency of the Quaternary till reveals that 

repository-derived caesium is the most effectively retained radionuclide (100% retention 

efficiency), while retention of repository-derived strontium and uranium becomes 

progressively lower. Radium retention decreases during the first years after repository 

release, and then approaches a steady state of 30% retention efficiency.

Abstract 

The Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB) is carrying out a 

geoscientific characterization of Forsmark for the construction of a deep geological 

repository for high level nuclear waste (HLNW). Reactive transport numerical models have 

been used to assess the migration of selected radionuclides (U, Sr, Cs and Ra) within a 

Quaternary till aquifer that overlies the candidate granitic host rock. Simulation of a 

hypothetical inflow of a radionuclide-bearing granite groundwater into the Quaternary till 

has provided a quantitative assessment of the migration and retention of selected 

radionuclides. According to numerical results, the Quaternary till behaves as a natural 

reactive barrier able to retain radionuclides. Computed retention of radionuclides in the 

solid phase leads to a retardation of their arrival to the discharge area of the Quaternary 

till. Numerical results show that the distribution coefficient (Kd) of the selected 

radionuclides varies in time and space in the modelled domain. Computed breakthrough 

curves of the selected radionuclides have been analysed to obtain effective retardation 

factors (R). Numerical results show that for those radionuclides with a high affinity for the 

solid phase (e.g. Cs) and those that are solely involved in co-precipitation with mineral 

phases (e.g. Ra), computed breakthrough curves take very long to reach the final 

stabilized maximum which hinders the estimation of R and the corresponding effective Kd. 

 

Keywords: Reactive transport models, radionuclides, distribution coefficient, effective 

retardation factor.

Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

130 

5.1 Introduction 

The concept of deep geological repository in Sweden entails a number of engineered 

(copper canisters, clay barriers, and cement liners) and natural geological barriers to 

prevent and retard for long periods of time (~100,000 years) the migration of radionuclides 

to the surface (SKB, 2006). Forsmark has been recently selected by SKB for the 

construction of Sweden’s deep geological repository for HLNW (SKB, 2009). 

When dealing with the final disposal of HLNW, radionuclide migration through the 

engineered and natural barriers that surround the repository must be assessed. In 

performance assessment of deep geological repositories, the most probable failure 

scenarios of the repository and their environmental consequences are being analysed 

(e.g. SKB, 2006). In case of repository release, the surface sediments covering the 

repository host rock represent the last geological barrier prior to the surface ecosystems. 

Reactive transport numerical models are powerful tools that couple groundwater flow, 

transport of solutes and geochemical reactions between solid and aqueous phases. By 

integrating site specific data and thermodynamic databases they can provide valuable and 

reliable quantitative evaluations for many environmental issues among which performance 

assessment of a deep geological repository is undoubtedly included (Molinero and 

Samper, 2006, Arcos et al, 2008, among others). Nevertheless, such reliable models 

demand considerable amounts of site specific data and thermodynamic parameters 

(needed to describe numerically the geochemical processes considered) that may not be 

available. In this context, Kd-based models may provide alternative tools whenever 

available data is not sufficient to implement the geochemical processes of interest for a 

given reactive transport model. 

The governing equations solved by a reactive transport simulator are a set of (1) partial 

differential equations describing groundwater flow and solute transport for each aqueous 

component; (2) non-linear algebraic equations describing equilibrium chemical reactions; 

and, (3) ordinary differential equations describing rates of kinetic chemical reactions 

(Parkhurst et al., 2004). On the other hand, in a Kd-based model the simulator does not 

need to solve non-linear algebraic equations, since aqueous speciation and 

thermodynamic equilibrium are not solved by this type of models. Therefore, for a given 

modelled domain and same number of reactive solutes, a Kd-based numerical model 

should be much less time and computational demanding than a reactive transport 

numerical model.

In 1981, Reardon discussed the reliability of Kd-based models to describe reversible ion 

sorption reactions in contaminant migration, concluding that if the groundwater system is 

in a steady state chemical evolution a Kd-based model should be as reliable as a reactive 

transport model. At chemical steady state the sorbing sites at any point in the flow path 

are in equilibrium with the way in which groundwater is evolving chemically and therefore 

the Kd of a given location should be constant over time. Based on these results, Glynn 

(2003) performed one-dimensional (1D) reactive transport simulations to demonstrate the 

effects of aqueous speciation and sorption reactions on the transport of neptunium and 

plutonium. The author concluded that a Kd-based model would lead to remarkably 

different results from those attained in reactive transport simulations, pointing out the care 

that must be taken when choosing the type of model to be used in the performance 

assessment of HLNW disposal sites. 

Glynn (2003) analysed the Kd obtained from the outputs of 1D reactive transport models 

for two redox sensitive radionuclides, neptunium and plutonium. In the present research 

work, a two-dimensional (2D) reactive transport model has been developed to predict the 

migration of four radionuclides in a Quaternary till: (1) uranium as a redox sensitive 

actinide that may adsorb on ferrihydrite; (2) strontium as a divalent cation that may co-

precipitate with calcite (CaCO3) and participates in cation exchange in illite; (3) caesium 

as a monovalent cation with high affinity for the frayed edge sites (FES) of illite; and, (4) 

radium as a divalent cation that may co-precipitate with barite (BaSO4). 

From the output results of the 2D reactive transport model, R and effective Kd are 

estimated for those radionuclides for which complete breakthrough curves have been 

computed. The meaning of this effective Kd is then analysed by comparing the results 

attained in the 2D reactive transport model with those obtained in the 2D Kd-based model. 

 

5.2 Scope 

This paper begins with a description of the reactive transport numerical model that has 

been built to predict the migration of selected radionuclides through a Quaternary till, by 

simulating a hypothetical repository release. This simulation is based on site specific data, 

taken from SKB’s Site Descriptive Model (Johansson et al., 2005; Tröjbom et al., 2007), 

that describe the hydrogeology and geochemistry at Forsmark, and on a pessimistic 

scenario of repository release. In the following section, the results attained in the reactive 

transport model are analysed and discussed. From the outputs of the reactive transport 

numerical model, the Kd of each radionuclide in the modelled domain is analysed over 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

132 

time and space. In section 5.5, R and the effective Kd of each radionuclide are calculated 

from the outputs of the reactive transport numerical model. The meaning of this effective 

Kd is analysed by comparing the results attained in the reactive transport simulations with 

those attained in Kd-based models. Finally, the main conclusions attained in this work are 

listed in section 5.6. 

 

5.3 Reactive solute transport model 

At Forsmark, the granitic candidate host rock for the deep geological repository is covered 

by a Quaternary till which thickness ranges from 1 to 3 m (Johansson et al., 2005). 

Groundwater in the granitic bedrock flows mainly along fractures and deformation zones 

composed of loose granitic material and coatings of calcite, chlorite, quartz and pyrite 

(Drake et al., 2006). The till deposit hosts unconfined porous aquifers with stratified 

hydraulic conductivity and porosity (Johansson et al., 2005), and is composed mainly of 

calcite, illite and trace amounts of Fe oxyhydroxides. 

In order to assess the migration of radionuclides through the Quaternary till, a hypothetical 

scenario of repository release has been simulated using a reactive transport numerical 

model. In this hypothetical scenario a granitic groundwater carrying repository-derived 

radionuclides is considered to flow upwards, from the repository to the surface, reaching 

the Quaternary till that discharges into a surface water body, such as a lake, a stream, or 

the Baltic Sea (Figure 5.1). 

The reactive transport simulations have been performed with the finite-difference code 

PHAST v. 1.4.2 (Parkhurst et al., 2004). This code is the result of coupling a transport 

solver, HST3D (Kipp, 1987) and the well known geochemical code, PHREEQC (Parkhurst 

and Appelo, 1999). PHAST is able to simulate multi-component, reactive solute transport 

in three-dimensional saturated groundwater flow systems. The reactive transport 

equations are solved by sequential non iterative approach (SNIA) in which solute transport 

and chemical reactions are decoupled for each time step. 

The thermodynamic database used in the present work (Duro et al., 2006a) is an 

extension of the NAGRA-PSI database, compiled by Hummel et al. (2002). This database 

contains a large set of complexation reactions as well as pure mineral equilibrium 

reactions for many radionuclides and trace elements.

5.3.1 Hydrodynamic and geochemical processes 

According to the site characterization programme developed by SKB, the Quaternary till 

has been divided in three layers with different hydraulic properties (Johansson et al., 

2005). Table 5.1 shows average values of the hydrodynamic parameters that were used 

in the numerical simulations of this work. 

The capacity of the Quaternary till to retain radionuclides depends mainly on the mineral 

assemblages present, which in turn, enable radionuclide sorption, precipitation or co-

precipitation with major element solid phases. Since the objective of this work is to assess 

radionuclide migration in the Quaternary till, radionuclide decay was not considered in the 

numerical simulations. 

According to the main reactive minerals present in the Quaternary till and to the 

geochemical behaviour of the selected radionuclides, the following geochemical 

processes have been implemented in the reactive transport model: 

1. Adsorption of uranium on ferrihydrite (Fe(OH)3). 

2. Co-precipitation of strontium with calcite (CaCO3).

The surface complexation model implemented in the reactive transport model for 

adsorption of uranium on ferrihydrite is that of Waite et al. (1994) which considers two 

types of adsorption sites (see Table A1.3 in Appendix 1). Ferrihydrite is very sensitive to 

changes in the redox state of the system, and the inflow of a relatively reducing deep 

groundwater in the till domain can trigger its dissolution. Therefore, if ferrihydrite dissolves 

in the simulation, the total amount of adsorption sites decreases proportionally and vice-

versa. An initial amount of 0.15 wt% of ferrihydrite has been set in the numerical model 

(Table 5.2). 

Calcite present in the Quaternary till is assumed to form a non-ideal solid solution with 

strontium. The parameters describing the formation of this solid solution are those of 

Tesoriero and Pankow (1996). An initial amount of 1.5 wt% of (Ca,Sr)CO3 has been 

assigned to the numerical model (Table 5.2). The initial strontium molar fraction (1.73 ×10
-

5
) has been obtained after performing a numerical equilibration of the selected till 

groundwater sample with the calcite-strontianite solid solution, using PHREEQC. This 

strontium molar fraction is consistent with data from Forsmark (SKB, 2005a; SKB, 2005b) 

and also with data other natural systems, as reported by Bruno et al. (2002). 

In the numerical simulations, the model for cation exchange in illite is that of Bradbury and 

Baeyens (2000) with some modifications (see Table A1.1 in Appendix 1, and for further 

details the reader is referred to Grandia et al., 2007). Illite dissolution kinetics is expected 

to be very slow under the pH conditions modelled here (Köhler et al., 2003). Therefore, a

135 

constant concentration of 10 wt% of illite (with a cation exchange capacity of 200 

meq·kgsolid
-1
) has been assumed (Table 5.2). 

In many aqueous systems, radium is strongly co-precipitated with barite due to the 

chemical similarity between radium and barium (Grandia et al., 2008; and references 

therein). In the numerical simulations, an ideal solid solution between BaSO4 and RaSO4 

has been let to form if oversaturation with this solid solution is reached (Table 5.2).

Siderite (FeCO3) is likely to form in carbonated systems similar to the Quaternary till under 

study; it is redox sensitive and may precipitate in the Quaternary till after the inflow of a 

reducing and Fe-rich deep groundwater. Therefore, siderite is allowed to precipitate in the 

simulations if oversaturation with this mineral is reached. 

To compute the initial state of a reactive transport model, the code used here (PHAST; 

Parkhurst et al., 2004) firstly equilibrates the initial porewater of the modelled domain with 

the reactive minerals considered. Therefore, and in order to analyse the output of such 

initial equilibration, we have performed previous static calculations in PHREEQC 

(Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999) to define the composition of the initial porewater and 

boundary waters of the modelled domain. In this context, the initial amount of siderite set 

for the reactive transport simulations (Table 5.2), results from equilibrating the selected till 

groundwater sample with this mineral. It should be noted that since the selected till 

groundwater sample is close to the equilibrium with the reactive minerals considered in 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

136 

the numerical model (calcite, ferrihydrite and siderite), the composition of the till 

groundwater used in the simulations is very similar to the one actually measured. 

 

5.3.2 Initial and boundary conditions 

The reactive transport numerical model simulates the water flow and geochemical 

processes that occur in the Quaternary till at Forsmark. The modelled domain is a 2D 

vertical cross-section of the till deposit. Following Johansson et al. (2005), the thickness is 

3 m, and, based on the dimensions of the subcatchments in the Forsmark area, the 

horizontal length is 100 m (Figure 5.2). 

According to the water balance calculations developed for Forsmark (Johansson et al., 

2005), a constant inflow rate of 14.5 L/d is prescribed along the vertical left boundary. The 

fracture through which deep groundwater enters the till is represented by a constant inflow 

boundary at the bottom of the modelled domain (cell coordinates: X= 20 m, Y= 0 m), with 

a flow rate of 0.5 L/d. The discharge area is located in the last 20 m of the top boundary, 

with a constant head of 3 m (Figure 5.2).

Two groundwater compositions, representative of the till and deep granitic groundwater, 

were selected from SKB’s database (Tröjbom and Söderbäck, 2006), and implemented in 

the numerical simulations (Table 5.3). The composition of deep groundwater affected by 

repository release is modified with respect to the deep groundwater composition prior to 

repository release, by adding repository-derived radionuclides (

The simulated flow conditions are constant in time, and therefore, the system is modelled 

under steady state for hydrodynamic processes, but not for geochemical processes. The 

hydrogeochemistry of the Quaternary till is expected to vary due to the inflow of a more 

reducing and mineralised granitic groundwater. 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

138 

In order to reach a geochemical quasi-steady state that represents the present-day 

hydrogeochemical conditions of the Quaternary till at Forsmark, a long period of reactive 

transport (2700 years) with the natural composition of the till porewater and deep 

groundwater flowing through the modelled domain (according to the boundary conditions 

shown in Figure 5.2) has been simulated. After attaining the geochemical quasi-steady 

state, repository release is simulated (for additional 8000 years) by adding 
RD

U, 
RD

Sr, 
RD

Cs 

and Ra to the deep groundwater that is flowing through the modelled domain (according 

to the values listed in Table 5.3). 

Repository release is simulated according to a very pessimistic scenario, where the 

~500 m of granitic bedrock (between the repository and the Quaternary till), and the 

engineered barriers of the repository are assumed to have a negligible retention capacity 

over radionuclides, which is highly unlikely. Repository release is simulated through a 

continuous inflow of repository-derived radionuclides into the Quaternary till. In this 

context, radionuclide concentrations calculated for the near-field of the repository (Duro et 

al., 2006b), i.e., the vicinity of the canisters that contain the HLNW, are applied directly as 

the input concentrations in the numerical simulations. Following this procedure, the 

concentrations of repository-derived radionuclides assigned to the deep groundwater, 

after repository release, are shown in Table 5.3. These radionuclide concentrations are 

very high, considering that the engineered barriers and granitic bedrock should be able to 

retain much of these radionuclides. Nevertheless, since the objective of this study is to 

evaluate radionuclide retention in the Quaternary till, such an extreme (pessimistic) 

scenario has been assumed. 

 

5.3.3 Spatial and time discretisation 

The spatial discretisation of the modelled domain was set according to the main features 

of the boundary conditions which influence groundwater flow and geochemistry. 

Accordingly, spatial discretisation was refined at the position of the deep groundwater 

inflow and under the discharge area (outflow boundary). 

As detailed in the previous section, there are two important stages regarding the chemical 

condition of the system: (i) the first stage occurs at the beginning of the simulation, when 

radionuclide-free deep groundwater flows into the modelled domain and triggers major 

geochemical changes until the geochemical quasi-steady state is reached (at 2700 years), 

and (ii) the second stage occurs when the increased concentration of radionuclides in the 

deep groundwater (that simulates repository release) disturbs the previous geochemical 



V. Estimating effective distribution coefficients of selected radionuclides from reactive transport numerical models 

139 

state. According to these stages, time discretisation was refined at the beginning of each 

stage, and set progressively coarser towards the end of each stage. 

To ensure stability in the numerical calculations, the Peclet criterion (Pe?2) is met for the 

maximum ?X (maximum ?X =1 m, and longitudinal dispersivity = 0.5 m). 

 

5.4 Results from the reactive solute transport model 

5.4.1 Transport of a conservative solute 

The transport of solutes in the modelled domain is affected by the geochemical processes 

and groundwater flow generated from the prescribed initial and boundary conditions. The 

conservative transport has been studied using chlorine as a tracer, given that no retention 

has been assigned to this element. From the chlorine breakthrough curve computed at the 

discharge area, an advective travel time of 2.3 years is obtained, from the deep 

groundwater inflow point to the discharge area of the modelled domain.

5.4.2 Distribution coefficient (Kd) of radionuclides and their natural 

isotopes 

While chlorine behaves conservatively other elements (also known as reactive solutes), 

including the studied radionuclides and their natural isotopes, are expected to react with 

the minerals present in the solid matrix of the Quaternary till which leads to their 

partitioning between aqueous and solid phases. Partitioning of a given reactive solute in 

the modelled domain can be expressed by a Kd value that is calculated from the 

numerical results. 

The concentration of a given reactive solute in the solid phase and in the aqueous phase 

is computed by PHAST for every time writing step and every node of the modelled 

domain. From this output, the Kd of a given reactive solute can be calculated. If the 

concentration of a given reactive solute retained in the solid phase (also known as 

sorbate) is expressed in mol·kg
-1

rock, and the concentration of this reactive solute in the 

aqueous phase is expressed in mol·L
-1

water, then the Kd, expressed in L·kg
-1
, is calculated 

from the following equation (Appelo and Postma, 2005):

Applying equation 5.1 to calculate the Kd of each radionuclide and respective natural 

isotope has provided charting their Kd in the modelled domain, for selected time steps. 

The output concentration of a sorbate in PHAST is given in units of mol·L

Strontium, uranium and caesium are naturally present in trace amounts in the two waters 

selected for the numerical simulations (Table 5.3), and therefore, they are considered to 

be present in the modelled domain before and after repository release. Since natural 



V. Estimating effective distribution coefficients of selected radionuclides from reactive transport numerical models 

141 

radium is below detection limit in most of the water samples at Forsmark, the presence of 

this radionuclide in the modelled domain is exclusively related to repository release. 

As previously mentioned, repository-derived radionuclides have been labelled as 
RD

U, 

RD
Sr and 

RD
Cs to distinguish them from their natural isotopes in the modelled domain. This 

labelling procedure has been done by duplicating the thermodynamic database of each 

natural isotope for the corresponding labelled radionuclide, and by defining new ideal solid 

solutions that incorporate both the repository-derived radionuclide and its natural isotope, 

so that no artificial isotopic fractionation is introduced in the simulations. Therefore, from 

the moment when repository release is simulated, the Kd of each natural isotope (U, Sr, 

Cs) is equal to that of the corresponding repository-derived radionuclide (
RD

U, 
RD

Sr, 
RD

Cs, 

respectively). 

During the approach to the geochemical quasi-steady state, the inflow of radionuclide-free 

deep groundwater into the Quaternary till triggers major geochemical changes which, in 

turn, lead to a readjustment of the partitioning of reactive solutes between solid and 

aqueous phases. Consequently, the Kd calculated from the outputs of the reactive 

transport simulations changes over time and space. Nevertheless, after the approach to 

the geochemical quasi-steady state (2700 years of reactive transport), the Kd of the 

selected radionuclides is relatively stable in time, but it is not homogeneous in space 

(Figure 5.4, Figure 5.5, Figure 5.6, and Figure 5.7). 

Uranium is initially present in the modelled domain, in the till porewater and adsorbed on 

the surface of ferrihydrite. Partitioning of uranium between aqueous and solid phases in 

the Quaternary till leads to an initially homogeneous Kd(U) of 114 L·kg
-1
 (results not 

shown). During the first 5 years of reactive transport simulation a dilution of U(aq) occurs 

because the deep groundwater has a lower uranium concentration than that of the till 

porewater (Table 5.3). This dilution causes the initial increment of the Kd(U) in the 

modelled domain (darker green area in the top image of Figure 5.4). Thereafter, the Kd(U) 

progressively decreases, and the resulting till domain becomes heterogeneous with a 

Kd(U) that ranges from 114 L·kg
-1
, close to the till groundwater inflow area (left border of 

the modelled domain), to 90 L·kg
-1
 in the vicinity of the deep groundwater inflow point. 

From the moment when repository release is simulated, the Kd of both natural and 

repository derived uranium is the same, since no isotopic fractionation is considered in the 

simulations.

Figure 5.4 – Predicted evolution of Kd(U) along the simulation time. In the beginning of the 

simulation period the Kd varies with time. From 2700 years until the end of the simulation 

(10,700 years), relatively small geochemical changes occur, and hence Kd does not vary 

much. 

 

Before the inflow of deep groundwater, strontium is present in the till porewater, in the 

(Ca,Sr)CO3 solid solution and adsorbed on illite, leading to a homogeneous Kd(Sr) of 20 

L·kg
-1
 (results not shown). The inflow of the deep groundwater in the till deposit leads to a 

decrease of the Kd(Sr) over time and space (Figure 5.5). After the establishment of the 

geochemical quasi-steady state, the Kd(Sr) varies little over time, but it is heterogeneous 

in space, ranging from 20 L·kg
-1
 in the area unaffected by the deep groundwater intrusion 

(darker blue area of the modelled domain), to 12 L·kg
-1
 in the vicinity of the deep 

groundwater inflow point (Figure 5.5). 

Deep groundwater has a higher strontium concentration than the till porewater. Mixing 

between both waters in the modelled domain leads to an enrichment of strontium in illite 

and in the (Ca,Sr)CO3 solid solution. The local equilibrium calculations developed for each 

time step lead to a retention of the added strontium in the solid phase that is lower than 

the increment of strontium in the aqueous phase, and therefore the Kd(Sr) decreases over

time in the area affected by the deep groundwater. From the moment when repository 

release is simulated, the Kd(Sr) (and also the Kd(

Figure 5.5 – Predicted evolution of Kd(Sr) along the simulation time. In the beginning of the 

simulation period the Kd varies with time. From 2700 years until the end of the simulation 

(10,700 years), relatively small geochemical changes occur, and hence Kd does not vary

Before the inflow of deep groundwater, caesium is present in the till porewater and 

adsorbed on illite, leading to an initially homogeneous Kd of 7950 L·kg
-1
 (data not shown). 

As already observed for uranium and strontium, the inflow of deep groundwater in the till 

deposit also leads to a decrease of the Kd of caesium in the area affected by the deep 

groundwater (Figure 5.6). 

Deep groundwater has a much higher caesium concentration than the till porewater, and 

its intrusion leads to a remarkable enrichment of caesium in the FES of illite. Although this 

retention is relatively efficient, the amount of caesium retained in the solid phase, 

computed under local equilibrium for each time step, is lower than the increment of 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

144 

caesium in the aqueous phase, and therefore the Kd(Cs) decreases along the simulation 

time. 

From the moment when repository release is simulated both natural and repository-

derived caesium are retained in the solid phase, resulting in a heterogeneous distribution 

of Kd in the mixing area of the modelled domain (lower image in Figure 5.6).

The water sample selected for the till porewater is very close to equilibrium with barite. 

From the moment when the radionuclide-free deep groundwater, which has a higher 

sulphate concentration, enters the till domain, part of the mixing area reaches 

oversaturation with respect to barite and this mineral starts to precipitate in the vicinity of 

the deep groundwater inflow point. After repository release, the inflow of deep 

groundwater, carrying repository-derived radium, triggers the co-precipitation of radium 

with barite, retaining radium in the solid phase. Co-precipitation of radium with barite leads

to the partitioning of radium between aqueous and solid phases which is expressed by the 

distribution of the Kd(Ra) from 0 (where no barite has precipitated) to 7000 L·kg
-1
 (Figure 

5.7).

The previous paragraphs have shown that, before the simulation of repository release, the 

Kd of the natural isotopes of the selected radionuclides varies, in the modelled domain, 

over time and space. These variations are related to: 

1. Mixing of the till groundwater and deep groundwater. The two waters have 

different concentrations of solutes, and different redox potential and pH. The 

mixing leads to concentration and dilution of solutes in the till system, depending 

on the relative concentration of solutes in both waters. 

2. Local thermodynamic equilibrium. Changes in the aqueous concentration of 

reactive solutes imply changes in the composition of the solid phases that involve 

these reactive solutes. 

 

After the establishment of the geochemical quasi-steady state, the Kd of the different 

radionuclides and their natural isotopes has small variations over time, but it is 

heterogeneous in space. Under this geochemical quasi-steady state, repository-derived 

radionuclides enter the Quaternary till and are partitioned along the mixing area between 

solid and aqueous phases, until finally be flushed out at the discharge area of the 

modelled domain.

5.4.3 Retention and breakthrough curves of repository-derived 

radionuclides 

The reactive transport simulations predict that 
RD

U, 
RD

Sr, 
RD

Cs, and Ra can be retained in 

the Quaternary till.
 
In order to improve our understanding on the migration and retention of 

radionuclides in the Quaternary till, reactive and conservative transport simulations have 

been compared. In the reactive transport simulations, migration of repository-derived 

radionuclides is affected by their interaction with the reactive minerals in the modelled 

domain, while in the conservative transport simulations all reactive solutes, including 

repository-derived radionuclides, are simulated as conservative solutes, meaning that 

their interaction with the reactive minerals is neglected. The comparison between both 

simulations relies on the analysis of the breakthrough curves computed in each simulation 

(conservative and reactive transport) at the discharge area of the modelled domain 

(Figure 5.8). 

When reactive transport is simulated, 
RD

U is predicted to be retained in the Quaternary till 

by adsorption on ferrihydrite. In this case, the arrival of 
RD

U to the discharge area is 

delayed approximately 2190 years with respect to its arrival when no interaction with the 

solid phase is considered (Figure 5.8a). The delay lag is calculated by subtracting the 

advective travel time computed in the reactive transport model to that computed in the 

conservative transport model. 

In the reactive transport simulation, approximately 1000 years after repository release, the 

concentration of 
RD

Sr(aq), at the discharge area of the modelled domain, reaches a 

stationary value of 3.0 × 10
-5
 mol·L

-1
 (Figure 5.8b). The retention of 

RD
Sr in the Quaternary 

till delays its arrival to the discharge area approximately 350 years. The computed 

retention of 
RD

Sr is provided by cation exchange in illite and, to a less extent, to its co-

precipitation with calcite. 

The breakthrough curve computed for 
RD

Cs in the reactive transport simulation (Figure 

5.8c) shows a remarkably slow tendency towards a stable maximum value. This slow 

increase of the concentration of 
RD

Cs(aq) at the discharge area of the Quaternary till is 

due to the high affinity of caesium for the FES of illite which readily retain 
RD

Cs in the solid 

phase of the modelled domain. 

Deep groundwater affected by repository release has a radium concentration of 9.15 × 10
-

11
 mol·L

-1
. At the end of the reactive transport simulation, Ra(aq) concentration computed 

for the discharge area is 2.43 × 10
-12

 mol·L
-1
, which is 74% of the maximum Ra(aq) 

concentration computed in the conservative transport simulation (Figure 5.8d). The 



V. Estimating effective distribution coefficients of selected radionuclides from reactive transport numerical models 

147 

numerical results predict that radium is retained, via co-precipitation with barite, in the 

vicinity of the deep groundwater inflow point (Figure 5.7). 

From the four radionuclides studied, radium is the only radionuclide that is solely 

influenced by the precipitation of a mineral phase (i.e. it is not involved in sorption 

reactions). Co-precipitation of radium with barite leads to an asymptotic breakthrough 

curve which is typical for those solutes solely influenced by the thermodynamic equilibrium 

with a mineral phase. This behaviour leads to a very slow increase of Ra(aq) at the final 

stage of the reactive transport simulation (Figure 5.8d).

5.5 Retardation factor (R) of repository-derived radionuclides 

The retardation factor (R) of a given reactive solute can be estimated from the numerical 

results according to two alternative procedures. If the computed breakthrough curve of a 

reactive solute (including the selected radionuclides) is complete, than R can be 

calculated from the following equation:

where T
R

1/2 is the advective travel time of the reactive solute in the reactive transport 

simulation, and T
C

1/2 is the advective travel time of the same solute in the conservative 

transport simulation. Equation 5.3 can be applied to estimate R for 
RD

U and 
RD

Sr, for which 

complete breakthrough curves have been computed. By applying equation 5.3 we obtain 

an effective retardation factor of 956 for 
RD

U and 156 for 
RD

Sr. 

If the breakthrough curve of a reactive solute is not complete (i.e., the maximum stabilized 

concentration has not been reached, as for the case of 
RD

Cs and Ra), equation 5.3 cannot 

be used to calculate R. In this case, and assuming a fully water saturated porous media 

(such as the Quaternary till modelled here), and that the geochemical reactions between 

reactive solutes and the solid matrix occur as a singular and instantaneous process (such 

as the local thermodynamic equilibrium reactions simulated here), R can be calculated 

from the following equation that relates R with Kde:

where Kde is the effective distribution coefficient [L
-3

M], ?b is the dry bulk density of the 

sediment [M L
-3
], and ?? is the effective porosity (-). 

In case of incomplete breakthrough curves (
RD

Cs and Ra in this work), equation 5.4 

should provide the approach to calculate the corresponding R. Nevertheless, when 

applying equation 5.4 to calculate R one must have a single value for Kde and ?? which is 

not the case presented here; both these parameters are heterogeneous, as shown in 

section 5.4.2 and Table 5.1, respectively. 

In order to find an effective porosity for the studied Quaternary till a conservative transport 

model was built using FEFLOW (Diersch, 2005). This model was calibrated using the 

values of the hydraulic parameters shown in Table 5.1, and adjusting a single effective 

porosity for the whole modelled domain that leads to the same conservative advective 

travel time as the one attained in the conservative transport model built in PHAST (Figure 

5.3). The effective porosity attained from this calibration is 0.0789, which is approximately 



V. Estimating effective distribution coefficients of selected radionuclides from reactive transport numerical models

the average of the kinematic porosities shown in Table 5.1 weighted by the thickness of 

the respective layers. 

In Figure 5.9 a very good agreement between the breakthrough curve computed in 

PHAST and the calibrated conservative transport model computed in FEFLOW is 

observed.

The effective porosity determined for the Quaternary till (in the simulation performed using 

FEFLOW) is able to reproduce the advective travel time computed when the kinematic 

porosity is stratified (PHAST simulation). This effective porosity is equivalent to the 

weighted average of the layered kinematic porosities that characterize the till deposit 

(Table 5.1). Now, the Kde for 
RD

U and 
RD

Sr (for which we have calculated R) must be 

found, and its mathematical meaning will be assessed, in order to provide a quantitative 

tool to calculate the effective Kd for

Kde, the following equation is obtained:

?b = 1.95 kg·L
-1
 

a Kde of 38.6 L·kg
-1
 for uranium and 6.27 L·kg

-1
 for strontium are obtained. 

These values are clearly out of the range of the Kd values previously calculated for the 

modelled domain, shown in Figure 5.4 and Figure 5.5, respectively. This apparent 

discrepancy is due to the fact that the Kd obtained for the modelled domain, was 

calculated applying equation 5.2 which uses the total porosity (0.25) instead of the 

effective porosity (0.0789). These results reflect that as for porosity, where: 

1. the kinematic porosity is related to the interconnected porous that contribute to the 

transport of solutes; and, 

2. the total porosity accounts for all isolated and interconnected voids, 

 

for Kd, it seems that a Kd related to the bulk of the sediment (total Kd), and a Kd only 

available for the transport of solutes (kinematic Kd) should exist. 

If the effective porosity is applied in equation 5.2, to calculate the Kd in the modelled 

domain, the spatial distribution of kinematic Kd for the four radionuclides selected is 

obtained (Figure 5.10). The effective Kd previously calculated for 
RD

Sr (6.27 L·kg
-1
) falls in 

the range of kinematic Kd’s calculated for the modelled domain (3 to 7 L·kg
-1
, in Figure 

5.10), while the effective Kd previously calculated for 
RD

U (38.6 L·kg
-1
) is slightly higher 

than the maximum kinematic Kd (36 L·kg
-1
, in Figure 5.10). 

These results show that opposite to what was found for porosity, where the effective 

porosity is the weighted average of the kinematic porosities, it seems that the effective Kd 

may not be related to the range of kinematic Kd’s by any statistic parameter. With these 

results we still cannot find a reliable way to calculate R for those radionuclides for which 

incomplete breakthrough curves have been computed. This would lead us to the ultimate 

option of computing longer time periods of reactive transport to achieve the complete 

breakthrough curves for 
RD

Cs and Ra. Since this is not the purpose of the present work, 

the breakthrough curves computed in the reactive transport model with those computed in 

Kd-based models for 
RD

Sr and 
RD

U (for which we have complete breakthrough curves) will 

be compared, and the validity of R and respective Kde, calculated from the outputs of the 

reactive transport simulations, will be assessed.

Figure 5.10 – Computed distribution of kinematic Kd for the selected radionuclides 8000 

years after repository release. Kinematic Kd is calculated for each node of the modelled 

domain by applying equation 5.2, using the effective porosity (0.0789) instead of the total 

porosity (0.25). 

 

The breakthrough curves computed for 
RD

Sr in the reactive transport model (using 

PHAST) and in the Kd-based model (using FEFLOW) agree relatively well (Figure 5.11). 

Nevertheless, one may see that depending on the solution method selected for the 

reactive transport model, an increased numerical dispersion appears if the solution 

method is backwards-in-time and upstream-in-space. Only when the solution method of 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

152 

the reactive transport model is centred-in-time and centred-in-space, both models lead to 

the same numerical results. These results prove that the Kde and corresponding R, 

previously calculated for 
RD

Sr, from the outputs of the reactive transport model, are 

reproducible in a Kd-based model. Therefore, when the system is in a geochemical quasi-

steady state, as the one previously built prior to the simulation of repository release, a Kd-

based model can be as reliable as a reactive transport model.

relatively similar. In addition, by comparing the graph in Figure 5.11a with that in Figure

RD

U is higher than in the case 

of 
RD

Sr. This is most likely due to the cumulative effect of dispersion with time. As longer 

the simulation time, as more visible the effect of dispersion on the breakthrough curves of 

reactive solutes.

5.6 Conclusions 

HLNW is partially composed of long-lived radionuclides, such as U
235

, Ra
233

, Cs
137

, and 

therefore, the assessment of the migration of these radionuclides in the systems 

surrounding a deep geological repository often relies on numerical transport models that 

provide powerful quantitative tools to cope with the long-term scenarios needed to face. 

In this work, a reactive transport model that simulates a hypothetical pessimistic scenario 

of a continuous repository release, during 8000 years, has been built. The migration and 

retention of 
RD

U, 
RD

Sr, 
RD

Cs and Ra through a Quaternary till that covers the candidate 

host rock at Forsmark (Sweden) have been assessed. The outputs of the reactive 

transport model show that the four radionuclides can be retained in the solid phase of the 

Quaternary till due to different geochemical processes: 
RD

U is adsorbed on ferrihydrite; 

RD
Sr is retained via co-precipitation with calcite and cation exchange on illite; 

RD
Cs is also 

retained via cation exchange on illite; and, radium is retained via co-precipitation with 

barite. Retention of the radionuclides in the solid phase provides a retardation of their 

arrival to the discharge area of the Quaternary till. 

The retardation factor of the radionuclides studied has been calculated, from the outputs 

of the reactive transport model, only for those radionuclides for which complete 

breakthrough curves have been computed (strontium and uranium). The estimation of the 

retardation factor for caesium and radium was not possible, since complete breakthrough 

curves have not been achieved. The high affinity of caesium for the FES of illite, and the 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

154 

fact that radium is solely involved in co-precipitation reactions, delay the achievement of a 

complete breakthrough curve, and therefore, hinder the estimation of the corresponding 

retardation factor. 

The validity of the retardation factor calculated for uranium and strontium, from the outputs 

of the reactive transport model, has been assessed by developing Kd-based models that 

accounted for the retardation factor so obtained. 

In order to build the Kd-based models, the naturally stratified kinematic porosity had to be 

upscaled to an effective porosity which corresponds to the weighted average of the 

kinematic porosities. As for porosity, it has been proven that for Kd there is a total Kd and 

a kinematic Kd. The retardation factor of a reactive solute is related to an effective Kd 

which, in turn, is closer to the range of kinematic Kd’s than to the range of total Kd’s. In 

other words, it is the kinematic Kd the one responsible for the retardation of the transport 

of reactive solutes. In the present work, it has been proven that the kinematic Kd is usually 

lower than the total Kd. These results have a deep impact on the laboratory methods that 

are used to obtain a Kd value to be implemented in Kd-based models for performance 

assessment exercises. 

As Reardon (1981) had concluded, we have demonstrated that when a given system 

reaches a geochemical quasi-steady state, a Kd-based model is able to provide numerical 

results as reliable as those attained in an equivalent reactive transport model. It should be 

noted, however, that the solution method selected for the reactive transport model may 

introduce additional numerical dispersion that is not computed in a Kd-based model. 

Finally, care must be taken when choosing the type of model to evaluate long-term 

contamination scenarios, since most likely these will undergo geochemical changes that 

are better coped in reactive transport numerical models than in Kd-based numerical 

models.

6. Summary, conclusions and discussion 

 

6.1 Summary and Conclusions 

The main geochemical processes that influence the migration of radionuclides in near-

surface systems have been studied in the present work.  

Hydrogeochemical numerical models have been developed to simulate both laboratory 

and field scale multicomponent problems. These simulations provided the assessment 

and quantification of the processes that are likely to influence the behaviour of 

radionuclides in near-surface systems. The numerical models developed here are based 

on two hydrogeochemical codes: PHREEQC (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999) and PHAST 

(Parkhurst et al., 2004). The first code is widely used for at least a decade, in the context 

of different environmental and scientific issues, while the second code is not so 

widespread but it results from coupling the first code with a transport code (HST3D, Kipp, 

1987). Therefore, the code PHAST is useful when dealing with complex geochemical 

systems coupled with the transport of solutes such as the ones studies here, and also 

when the problem cannot be reduced to 1D. Finally, in Chapter 5 a third code has been 

used (FEFLOW, Diersch, 2005) to compare Kd-based transport models with the reactive 

transport models previously developed using PHAST (Parkhurst et al., 2004). 

A descriptive numerical model has been developed in Chapter 2 of this thesis to simulate 

a jar-fermentor experiment where evidences of microbially driven redox reactions have 

been observed. 

Microbially driven redox reactions are interpreted as the oxidation of organic carbon by 

microbes, and subsequent reduction of inorganic species that are available in the 

surrounding aquatic system. The linkage between microbial activity and the redox 

sensitive species has been conceptualized through the partial equilibrium approach (Barry 

et al., 2002; Brun and Engesgaard, 2002) which assumes that the rate limiting step is the 

oxidation of organic matter, and that the subsequent reduction of inorganic species occurs 

under local equilibrium. In the present work, this approach has been successfully applied 

to the reduction of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, sulphate, ferric iron, and fermentation of 

lactate, mediated by aerobes, denitrifiers, sulphate reducing bacteria, iron reducing 

bacteria, and fermenters, respectively, but not to microbially driven methanogenesis.  

Besides the partial equilibrium approach, the Monod growth model was also applied in 

Chapter 2, to simulate microbial respiration and growth, taking into account, half-



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

160 

saturation constants for the organic and inorganic substrates, and also inhibition terms 

that describe the sequential use of terminal electron acceptors (O(II), N(V), Fe(III), S(VI), 

acetate and C(VI)). Coupling of the partial equilibrium approach with the Monod growth 

model seems to provide a solid theoretical basis, able to accurately describe microbially 

driven redox reactions. In addition, by considering that when microbial biomass grows, the 

elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen are removed from solution according to 

the stoichiometry of a simplified biomass molecule (C5H7O2N) and vice-versa, a robust 

mass balance between biomass and the different phases (solid, aqueous and gaseous) of 

the inorganic aquatic system of the jar-fermentor has been achieved. 

The numerical results achieved in Chapter 2 prove that, if microbes and organic matter 

are available at repository depth, dissolved oxygen, one of the most damaging species for 

a metallic over pack, may be consumed relatively fast, while HS
-
 (which may also corrode 

the metallic over pack) may be produced by sulphate reducing bacteria. Nevertheless, 

sulphur secondary phases may precipitate and limit the concentration of HS
-
. 

Uncertainties on the Monod parameters provide the possibility for different combinations 

of these parameters which lead to similar numerical solutions. Nevertheless, these 

different combinations of the Monod parameters lead to different partitioning of carbon 

between biomass and the different phases of the inorganic carbon system (aqueous, 

solid, and gaseous). Should more variables be analysed in future experiments, such as 

the concentration of Ca
2+

, the amount of carbonate minerals, and the initial and final 

concentration of the different microbial groups, some uncertainties on the Monod 

parameters could be constrained. 

Two predictive numerical models have been developed in Chapters 3 and 4, to assess the 

retention capacity of the near-surface systems at Forsmark (Sweden) under a pessimistic 

scenario of repository release and subsequent arrival of radionuclides to the near-surface 

Quaternary sediments (glacial clay and calcite-rich till). Comparison between the outputs 

of the numerical models developed for the glacial clay and the calcite-rich till with 

measured concentrations of reactive solutes such as bicarbonate, calcium, strontium and 

uranium, has proven the reliability of the conceptual model built for these systems. Under 

this premise, a hypothetical repository release has been simulated through a continuous 

injection of repository-derived radionuclides into both Quaternary sediments. The outputs 

of this hypothetical repository release into the Quaternary sediments have provided a 

quantitative assessment of the capacity of the glacial clay and the calcite-rich till to retain 

the four radionuclides selected: 
235

U, 
90

Sr, 
135

Cs and 
226

Ra. 



VI. Summary, Conclusions and Discussion 

161 

Taking into account the knowledge attained from the data gathered until now, and under 

the assumptions made for each near-surface system, it is possible to conclude that the 

four radionuclides studied are likely to be efficiently retained in the till and glacial clay for 

at least several hundreds of years. Exception is made for radium in the glacial clay where 

it seems that it could be mobile. 

Finally, it has been seen in Chapter 5 that the Kd of reactive solutes may vary over time 

and space. Nevertheless, when the geochemical quasi-steady state is approached in the 

numerical model, effective Kd’s may be calculated from the outputs of such numerical 

model. The validity of these effective Kd’s has been assessed in Kd-based transport 

models developed in FEFLOW (Diersch, 2005). In order to build these Kd-based models, 

the naturally stratified kinematic porosity had to be upscaled to an effective porosity which 

corresponds to the weighted average of the kinematic porosities. As for porosity, it has 

been proven that also for Kd there is a total Kd and a kinematic Kd. 

The retardation factor of a reactive solute is related to an effective Kd which in turn is 

closer to the range of kinematic Kd’s than to the range of total Kd’s. These results have a 

deep impact on the laboratory methods that are used to obtain a Kd value to be 

implemented in Kd-based models within performance assessment exercises. 

The laboratory methods performed to calculate the Kd of a given radionuclide are often 

based on batch experiments. The Kd calculated from such experiments corresponds to 

the total Kd, and this total Kd is higher than the kinematic Kd that would be obtained from 

a column experiment. Total Kd would then lead to the estimation of a longer advective 

travel time of a given radionuclide compared with the travel time obtained if the kinematic 

Kd would be used. By considering a longer travel time than the one that could actually be 

observed, the safety assessment based on total Kd’s would lead to less conservative 

predictions. Therefore, in the context of safety assessment, it is recommended to study 

the kinematic Kd’s instead of the total Kd’s. 

 

6.2 Discussion 

The work presented has contributed to improve our understanding on the 

(bio)geochemical and hydrodynamic processes that influence radionuclide mobility in 

near-surface systems. The numerical implementation of the conceptual models built for 

each case has been accurately developed. Despite the successful results attained in each 

numerical model, some unsolved problems still exist, some of which provide ideas for 

future works, others can be viewed as weak points of this thesis, and others reflect the 



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

162 

need for further development in computational power or more efficient numerical models, 

and additional thermodynamic data. 

In the next paragraphs the main unsolved questions that prevail after the development of 

the research work described in Chapters 2 to 5 are discussed. 

 

6.2.1 Chapter 2: lactate fermentation and the inorganic carbon system 

In Chapter 2, propionate evolution is still not well understood and consequently not well 

simulated. The stoichiometry of lactate fermentation implemented here has been reported 

by others (von Gunten and Zobrist, 1993, among others). Nevertheless, the most probable 

cause for overestimation of propionate seems to be an apparently unsuitable 

stoichiometry of lactate fermentation for the jar-fermentor experiment modelled here. 

These results point to the hypothesis that lactate fermentation could vary depending on 

the environment in which it takes place. 

Methane production is far overestimated, while for carbon dioxide the opposite is true. The 

most probable reason for the overestimation of methane could be due to the fact that, as 

for the other types of microbial respiration considered in the numerical model, microbial 

methanogenesis is simulated following the partial equilibrium approach. Under this 

premise, the local equilibrium reaction that describes the reduction of C(IV) to C(-IV) has 

been maintained in the thermodynamic database. By doing so, the numerical model 

computes an excess of methane production.  An alternative to this assumption would be 

that methane could be solely produced through kinetics. Nevertheless, under this 

alternative assumption, the change in the oxidation state of carbon, from C(IV) to C(-IV), 

could not be coupled to the redox potential since this equilibrium reaction would have had 

to be discarded from the thermodynamic database. These uncertainties point to the 

following questions: 

Is the thermodynamic constant of the reaction that describes the reduction of HCO3
-
 to 

CH4: 

HCO3
-
(aq) + 9H

+
(aq) + 8e

-
 ? CH4(aq) + 3H2O(l)     log k = 27.8493 

 (equation 6.1) 

 

, used in the numerical model, suitable in systems where microbial methanogenesis takes 

place? Should a different thermodynamic constant be used when microbial 

methanogenesis prevails? What would be the applicability of such constant to other 

systems? 



VI. Summary, Conclusions and Discussion 

163 

The uncertainties related to methane production have inevitable consequences on the 

accuracy of modelled carbon dioxide production. Therefore, the simulated evolution of 

carbon dioxide also shows a poor agreement with measured data. 

The precipitation/dissolution of carbonate minerals should also influence the carbon 

system. Under the assumptions made for conceptual model that describes the behaviour 

of the carbon system, the numerical model developed in Chapter 2 fails to reproduce 

methane and carbon dioxide production. As previously mentioned, future experiments with 

additional measured data could help to improve our understanding on the evolution of the 

carbon system in environments where microbial activity plays an important role. 

 

6.2.2 Chapter 3: geochemical behaviour of radium in the glacial clay 

In Chapter 3, from the four radionuclides considered in the numerical model, radium is 

predicted to be mobile, i.e., it is not retained in the solid phase. In this numerical model, 

radium was let to co-precipitate with barite if oversaturation with this phase is reached. 

Nevertheless, since barite oversaturation was not computed for the glacial clay modelled 

in Chapter 3, radium was not predicted to be retained in the solid phase of the glacial clay. 

Should other phases be considered to react with radium, such as barium carbonate 

(BaCO3), which has been reported as a feasible process by others (Andrews et al., 1989), 

radium could have been predicted to be retained in the glacial clays at Forsmark. 

 

6.2.3 Chapters 3 and 4: coupling of wider and more complex geological 

settings 

Looking at the work presented in Chapters 3 and 4, one could ask: Why were the glacial 

clay and till systems, which are by nature hydraulically connected, modelled separately? 

Could they have been integrated in a single and more complex numerical model? Most 

probably yes. In fact, during the construction of the reactive transport numerical models, 

we have tried to couple both sediments in a single numerical model. Nevertheless, some 

difficulties have arisen related to both the conceptualization and the numerical 

implementation of the hydrodynamic and geochemical processes responsible for the 

differentiation between both sediments. Therefore, for the time being, both sediments 

have been modelled separately. 

Following the reasoning of the previous paragraph, one could ask if the whole system, 

from the deep geological repository, passing through the ~500 m of granite, to the near-



Numerical modelling of radionuclide migration in near-surface systems 

164 

surface systems, could have been simulated in a single reactive transport model, and 

therefore more accurate predictions could have been made. I might say that human 

actions tend to augment the range of possible things and these depend on the time at 

which a question to be solved is posed and the schedule that one has to face to give the 

answer. I would say it is possible, and theoretically, such a complex hydrogeochemical 

model is nearing its accomplishment. 

In addition to the geochemical processes that have been implemented in the numerical 

simulations developed in Chapters 3 and 4, other geochemical processes could influence 

radionuclide migration in the glacial clay and till sediments. Nevertheless, uncertainties on 

(1) site specific data, (2) the mechanisms inherent to the geochemical processes, and (3) 

the lack of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters hinder the implementation of additional 

geochemical processes. 

The additional geochemical processes relevant for the glacial clay and till sediments that 

could be implemented in future works are: 

• Microbial activity. The work developed in Chapter 2 has proven the role of 

microbial activity on the redox state of aquatic systems, and therefore, the mobility 

of redox sensitive radionuclides such as uranium may be remarkably modified in 

the presence of microbial activity. 

• Sorption on organic tissues. The glacial clays at Forsmark may have organic 

matter-rich layers (Tröjbom and Söderbäck, 2006) where sorption of radionuclides 

on solid organic matter could be a relevant process for the cycling of radionuclides 

in near-surface systems (Hou et al., 2003). 

• Colloid-borne radionuclide transport. Colloid-borne radionuclide transport may be a 

relevant process on the migration of radionuclides (van de Weerd and Leijnse, 

1997). Nevertheless, the uncertainties related to the mechanisms that underlie the 

radionuclide attachment to colloid particles and subsequent colloid mobility hinder 

the simulation of the interaction between radionuclides and colloids. 

 

6.2.4 Chapters 3 and 4: reliability of the numerical predictions 

The final question I would pose to the work presented here is how reliable are the 

predictive models developed for the near-surface systems at Forsmark. We have 

performed long periods of reactive transport to reproduce the hydrogeochemical 

conditions observed nowadays at Forsmark, the outputs of which have shown a relatively 

good agreement with observed data; namely, the molar ratio between bicarbonate and 



VI. Summary, Conclusions and Discussion 

165 

uranium, and the molar ratio between calcium and strontium in the aqueous phase, 

computed in the numerical models developed in Chapters 3 and 4, fall within the range of 

data actually measured at Forsmark. Therefore, if the topography and hydrology of the 

Forsmark area will not change much for the next ~2500 years, the numerical predictions 

made here can be viewed as relatively reliable under the pessimistic scenario that has 

been assumed. 

 

6.2.5 Chapter 5: uncertainties on the parameterization of solute transport 

In Chapter 5, the reliability of Kd-based models compared to reactive transport models 

has been assessed. This work has proven that only when the system is under 

geochemical quasi-steady state conditions, Kd-based models can provide as reliable 

estimates as reactive transport models. Nevertheless, uncertainties on the Kd value to be 

applied in Kd-based models must be assessed through proper sensitivity analyses. On the 

other hand, in reactive transport models, uncertainties related to the values of effective 

diffusion coefficients, longitudinal and transverse dispersivities also apportion additional 

uncertainties to the results of reactive transport models. In this context, future sensitivity 

analyses on the magnitude of these parameters should be performed to assess the 

influence of these parameters on the predictions for radionuclide mobility in near-surface 

systems.

The surface complexation model for ferrihydrite, implemented in the numerical model 

developed in Chapter 4, is that of Waite et al. (1994). This model considers two types of 

adsorption sites (of strong and weak binding, respectively). The adsorbable species and 

corresponding constants are listed in Table A1.3. The total concentration of sites is 0.875 

mol per mol of ferrihydrite (Waite et al., 1994). Most of these sites are of low affinity (weak 

binding) and only 0.0018 mol per mol of ferrihydrite correspond to high-affinity (strong 

binding) sites.
