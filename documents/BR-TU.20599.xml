Em primeiro lugar tenho de agradecer à Professora Doutora Margarida Santos-Reis, pela 

oportunidade de trabalhar neste projeto, pela imposição obrigatória de efectuar o trabalho de 

grupo a pares, que facilitou muito o trabalho, e pela disponibilidade para que mesmo podendo 

não ser imediata, sempre esteve presente. 

Tenho também de dirigir um enorme obrigado ao Doutor Nuno Pedroso pelos dias de 

planeamento dos locais amostrados, as ideias de tratamento dos resultados, pela orientação 

que me foi dando ao longo destes meses de trabalho, que sem ele não seria possível. Em suma 

pela paciência que teve comigo, estando sempre disponível para debater qualquer problema e 

trabalhar em conjunto para chegar a uma solução. 

Quero também agradecer à minha família e amigos. Aos meus pais pelo apoio 

omnipresente e incondicional, pela disponibilidade para resolver situações imprevistas e 

flexibilidade para se ajustarem a uma nova rotina com o trabalho de campo intenso.  

Aos meus irmãos e à minha cunhada, por estarem sempre presentes e, à sua maneira, 

me puxarem para cima quando o isolamento me toldava os pensamentos. Mesmo contra 

vontade, os momentos fora de casa, nem que fosse para jantar, ajudaram muito a desanuviar e 

a refrescar a cabeça. 

Ao meu amigo e colega de trabalho de campo, Diogo Cabecinha, que para além de 

condutor e cozinheiro foi muitas vezes a única pessoa com quem falava durante dias 

consecutivos. Obrigado pela companhia, pelos momentos bons, maus e por aqueles que ficam 

para a posterioridade, e até pelos debates quase filosóficos como “será que nos molhamos mais 

se corrermos?”. 

À Megan Lynch, uma companhia estrangeira, que nos auxiliou no trabalho de campo 

durante alguns dias, facilitando as buscas e trocando conhecimentos sobre lontras. 

To Megan, a foreigner company, that help us in field work for a few days, facilitating the 

searches and exchanging knowledge about otters.  

À Luísa Ramalho e à Margarida Antunes, pela hospitalidade e dotes culinário numa das 

temporadas de campo, assim como pelo apoio constante ao longo de todo o trabalho. 

À minha afilhada e a todos os meus Amigos que directa ou indirectamente me deram 

forças e acreditaram em mim, fazendo-me ver que por mais horas de sono e pestanas

queimadas se eu tivesse confiança em mim e no meu trabalho, este acabaria por chegar a bom 

porto. 

Não podia deixar de agradecer ao CARNIVORA – Núcleo de Estudos de Carnívoros e seus 

Ecossistemas, pelo apoio financeiro ao trabalho de campo, à Companhia das Lezírias, à Liga para 

a Proteção da Natureza (LPN) nomeadamente ao Centro de Educação Ambiental de Vale 

Gonçalinho (CEAVG) e à Câmara Municipal de Marvão na pessoa do Senhor Presidente pelo 

alojamento cedido que viabilizou a execução do trabalho de campo e ao Centre for Ecology, 

Evolution and Environmental Changes (cE3c) sediado na Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade 

de Lisboa pela disponibilização da sua casa na Herdade da Ribeira Abaixo em Grândola.  

Por último tenho também a agradecer aos meus familiares e do Diogo por nos cederem 

guarida durante o tempo de trabalho de campo. Uma ajuda indispensável para o culminar do 

projeto.

Resumo 
  

O reconhecimento do declínio acentuado da população global de lontra euroasiática 

(Lutra lutra Linnaeus, 1758) que se verificou na década de 70, intimamente ligado a factores que 

ainda hoje influenciam o seu habitat, como poluição dos ambientes aquáticos, pressão humana 

e degradação da vegetação ripícola, originou vários estudos a nível europeu que sustentaram a 

classificação da lontra como espécie internacionalmente protegida. Em Portugal Continental, a 

população de lontra é tida como uma das mais viáveis da Europa. Embora protegida legalmente, 

a lontra é hoje considerada uma espécie de estatuto Pouco Preocupante, sendo a maioria dos 

estudos sobre a espécie restritos geograficamente.  

O único estudo acerca da distribuição da espécie à larga escala, em Portugal, foi 

realizado em 1995 sob a responsabilidade do Instituto de Conservação da Natureza e adoptando 

a metodologia recomendada pelo grupo de especialistas da lontra da União Internacional para 

a Conservação da Natureza (IUCN). Segundo esta metodologia, a área de estudo é dividida numa 

grelha de 10 km por 10 km e em cada quadrícula deverão ser feitos transectos de no máximo 

600 m ao longo de corpos de água (rios, ribeiras, reservatórios, lagoas, etc) previamente 

selecionados por apresentar potencialmente melhores condições para a presença de lontra. 

Nesta metodologia, para além de identificação visual de indivíduos, contam também para um 

resultado positivo vestígios inegáveis da sua presença como excrementos, latrinas e pegadas. 

Tratando-se de uma espécie territorial, a lontra efectua as marcações do seu território 

recorrendo a dejectos/latrinas e marcações odoríferas (secreções gelatinosas), geralmente ao 

longo das linhas de água em locais secos/abrigados da água e elevados. Deste modo grandes 

blocos de pedra, troncos de árvores, pontes e bifurcações de linhas de água são locais ideais 

para a marcação e assim para se efectuarem as prospecções. Estudos ao nível de efectivos 

populacionais em Portugal não são comuns, pois exigem muitos recursos financeiros e humanos 

para além de exigirem muito tempo de amostragem especialmente se se focarem, em áreas de 

grande dimensão.  

Actualmente a lontra euroasiática está classificada globalmente como Quase Ameaçada 

(NT) segundo o IUCN, estando listada no Anexo I da Convenção de Washington (CITES), Anexo II 

da Convenção de Berna e Anexos II e IV da Directiva Habitats. Já em Portugal continental, até 

então com Informação Insuficiente (DD) esta espécie passou, em 2005, para Pouco Preocupante 

(LC).

Foi objectivo do presente estudo reavaliar a distribuição da lontra na região centro-sul 

de Portugal onde, segundo o estudo de 1995 e com base em variáveis ambientais e humanas, 

se definiram duas vastas áreas críticas para a presença de lontra, assim como outras dezoito 

áreas importantes para a sua conservação. Pretendeu-se averiguar a evolução da distribuição 

da espécie após duas décadas, identificar que fatores influenciam a mesma, e propor medidas 

de conservação a adotar em eventuais locais de risco ou de ausência da espécie.  

Recorrendo a uma metodologia similar à sugerida pelo IUCN e semelhante ao estudo de 

1995, foi efetuado um transecto até 600 metros num corpo de água, que caso fosse negativo, 

seria seguido da execução até um máximo de três pontos de amostragem (spot checks) com 

comprimentos de 20-25m, em locais ideais para identificação de presença de lontra. Em cada 

prospecção foram identificadas variáveis como o tipo de substrato, percentagem de cobertura 

arbórea e arbustiva, poluição e nível e capacidade do recurso hídrico amostrado. As prospeções 

foram efetuadas entre Setembro de 2014 a Abril de 2015. 

A análise comparativa dos estudos da distribuição de lontra (1995 e 2014/2015) foi 

predominantemente descritiva, considerando as limitações do uso de uma variável binária como 

a presença/ausência da lontra. No entanto, foi usado o teste de qui-quadrado de McNemar para 

a verificar se houve mudanças significativas na presença/ausência do lontra entre os anos e 

entre as sub-bacias amostradas. De igual forma a regressão logística multivariada foi usada para 

determinar o efeito das variáveis de macro habitat na presença/ausência de lontra em cada 

quadricula e, identificar a combinação de variáveis que explicam a distribuição da lontra. A 

associação entre as variáveis explicativas e a presença/ausência de lontra foi testada usando o 

método de máxima verossimilhança e aplicou-se um processo de selecção por etapas (stepwise 

forward), com base no teste do Wald. Finalmente uma Análise de Componente Principais foi 

aplicada para entender as relações entre variáveis de macro habitat e distribuição da lontra, em 

cada quadrícula, complementando as anteriores análises, codificando as amostras com base na 

presença/ausência de lontra e as sub-bacias amostradas.  

Os resultados obtidos evidenciam uma expansão de 9% da área geográfica de ocupação 

pela lontra com colonização de novas áreas, com principal foco na região entre a margem direita 

do rio Tejo e a costa Atlântica. Esta expansão parece estar relacionada com uma melhoria 

generalizada das condições de habitat e uma maior disponibilidade de presas, principalmente 

do lagostim-vermelho do Louisiana (Procambarus clarkii Girard, 1852). Para além da falta de 

sistemas de água doce, também linhas de água caracterizadas por forte corrente e falta de 

vegetação aquática, intervenções humanas (alteração das margens, poluição) e salinização da 



 

 

3 

água são factores que resultaram estar relacionados com a ausência de lontra euroasiática. Esta 

ausência da espécie está assim restrita a zonas altamente intervencionadas pelo Homem ou com 

falta de disponibilidade de água. Estas áreas, já eram designadas no estudo anterior (de 1995) 

por Áreas Críticas para a conservação da lontra em Portugal. Os resultados do presente trabalho 

revelam que das duas zonas críticas para a conservação de lontra englobadas na área de estudo, 

a zona da Península de Setúbal não sofreu alterações, contrariamente à zona Norte de Lisboa 

onde é visível um aumento da distribuição da população de lontra, formando duas áreas de 

menores dimensões, uma em redor de Lisboa, outra em torno de Porto de Mós.  

Devido à sua inclusão nos Anexos II e IV da Directiva Habitats, a lontra euroasiática é 

classificada como espécie de fauna de valor comunitário e é previsto que sejam designadas 

Zonas Especiais de Conservação. Com base em critérios de selecção como o estado de 

conservação e dimensão do local, a diversidade de ambientes aquáticos e abundância relativa 

da espécie, no estudo de 1995 foram definidos 86 sítios importantes para a conservação de 

lontra divididos em três classes (prioritários, importantes e a considerar). Dos 18 sítios 

importantes para a conservação de lontra situados na área de estudo, apenas os sítios de baixa 

prioridade apresentam resultados negativos para a presença de lontra, resultado que se 

mantem sensivelmente igual em comparação com os dados obtidos em 1995.  

Numa avaliação à metodologia utilizada no trabalho de campo e com base nos 

resultados obtidos, sugere-se que a prospecção de vestígios de lontra seja feita em transectos 

com um máximo de 400 m por oposição aos 600 m uma vez que para além dos 250 m poucos 

vestígios de lontra foram encontrados. Por sua vez um aumento da distância percorrida nos spot 

checks de 25 m para 50 m (dado que 81% dos transectos revelaram-se positivos até aos 50m) 

deve incrementar a probabilidade de encontrar vestígios de lontra, agilizando a prospecção em 

cada quadrícula. Sugere-se também uma alteração da ordem de prospecção devendo efectuar-

se primeiramente os spot checks e só depois, e em caso destes terem sido negativos, os 

transectos.  

Embora o estado de conservação da lontra se mantenha como não preocupante na área 

de estudo, e potencialmente também em Portugal, a pressão exercida por factores que actuam 

a uma escala global, em particular as alterações climáticas e os seus efeitos na escassez de água, 

sugere a necessidade de uma monitorização periódica e preocupação com a qualidade dos 

recursos hídricos. Deste modo são sugeridas algumas medidas que visam a promover a 

conservação da espécie e do seu habitat, nomeadamente através da monitorização da 

população de lontra com alguma periocidade de modo a permitir descortinar eventuais

alterações populacionais da espécie, estabelecer medidas conservativas de modo a minimizar 

os atropelamentos nas estradas (um dos principais factores de ameaça em acção) e as

para a conservação de lontra e promover a educação ambiental junto da população humana

Summary 
 

The acknowledgment of the marked decline of Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra Linnaeus, 

1758) global population in the 70’s led to many studies that resulted in the classification of the 

otter as internationally protected species. In mainland Portugal, otter population is considered 

as one of the most viable of Europe and despite being legally protected, the otter is now 

considered a species of least concern status with the majority of studies on the species 

geographically restricted. The only study on the wide range of species distribution was carried 

out in 1995 under the Nature Conservation Institute and adopting the methodology 

recommended by the Otter Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of 

Nature. This study aims to re-evaluate the distribution of the otter in the south-central region 

of Portugal where, according to the 1995 study, two large critical areas for the presence of otter 

were defined, as well as other important areas for their conservation. Using the same 

methodology, we sought to investigate the evolution of the species distribution after two 

decades, identify what factors influence it, and propose conservation measures to be adopted 

especially in risk areas or of species absence. The results show an increase of 9% of the 

geographical area of occupation by the otter with colonization of new areas, with a primary 

focus in the area between the right bank of the Tejo river and the Atlantic coast. This increase 

of otter’s distributions seems to be related to a general improvement of habitat condition and 

higher prey availability and is only limited by the absence of freshwater and high human density. 

The absence of the species is thus restricted to human modified areas or lack of continued water. 

Although the otter conservation status in Portugal is Least Concern, the pressure exerted by 

factors that act on a global scale, in particular climate change and its effects on water scarcity, 

suggests the need for periodic monitoring and concern for the quality of water resources.

1. Introduction  
 

Riverine otters are mammals of the order Carnivora and like weasels, martens or 

badgers they belong to the Mustelidae family (Roos et al., 2015). Their singular semi-aquatic 

lifestyle, when compared to other mustelids, led them to develop a hydrodynamic body 

structure, interdigital webbing, an extra layer of highly dense fur, a strong and flat tail, ears, eyes 

and nostrils in the upside of the head, and the ability to change the shape of eyes lens for a more 

accurate underwater vision (Kruuk, 2006). Due to these significant changes, otters have been 

grouped in the subfamily Lutrinae that comprises 13 species (Foster-Turley et al., 1990). 

The Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra Linneus, 1758) is the only member of the Lutrinae family 

in Europe. Besides Europe, Eurasian otter’s range reaches Japan and South Korea in Asia and 

some regions north of Sahara desert in Africa (Roos et al., 2015). 

 This species has nocturne/ twilight habits (Ruiz-Olmo et al., 2001; Jiménez et al., 2008) 

and lives in low density (Ruiz-Olmo et al., 2001) with philopatric females in opposition to 

dispersive males (Farinha, 1999; Quaglietta et al., 2013; Pedroso et al., 2014a). In the Iberian 

Peninsula, otter’s territories can extend over 33 to 40 km and 20 to 30 km of watercourses length 

for males and females respectively (Bernardo, 2008; Ruiz-Olmo and Jiménez, 2008). Otter 

territories are marked through the deposition of spraints and jellies (musky anal secretion) on 

high/visible places (e.g. stones, dead tree trunks) or predictable/weather proof sites (e.g. water 

junctions or under bridges) (Ruiz-Olmo et al., 2001). A single otter can mark many kilometres of 

watercourses (Ruiz-Olmo et al., 2001). 

 Due to otter active marking activities, that may vary accordingly to sex, age and season, 

among other factors (e.g. Kruuk and Conroy, 1987), researchers cannot rely on the number of 

signs to estimate the number of otters but it is acceptable that more signs are associated to 

areas more intensively used and therefore more important for otters (Ruiz-Olmo et al., 2001; 

Guter et al., 2007), particularly in what concerns prey availability (Guter et al., 2007). Inversely, 

absence of signs in an area does not necessarily means absence of otters (Guter et al., 2007; 

Calzada et al., 2010) and can lead to false negatives (Ruiz-Olmo et al., 2001). Marking intensity 

relies on the importance of territories, and as Ruiz-Olmo et al. (2001) evidenced, otters can use 

some passages without marking them. Only when no signs are regularly observed in consecutive 

sampling events in the same location, we can assume the species absence (Ruiz-Olmo et al., 

2001).

Otters are generalist predators with a diverse diet and prey can be identified by the 

analysis of the undigested remains (e.g. scales, teeth, bones) found in spraints (Novais et al., 

2010). Being a semi-aquatic animal, fishes are the main prey of the Eurasian otter (e.g. Blanco-

Garrido et al., 2008; Clavero et al., 2008; Novais et al., 2010; Pedroso et al., 2014a), largely 

complemented with amphibians and the American crayfish (Procambarus clarkii Girard, 1852) 

(Beja, 1996; Clavero et al., 2008; Pedroso et al., 2014a). Reptiles, birds and small mammals make 

also part of their diet (e.g. Clavero et al., 2008; Novais et al., 2010). This wide diet makes otters 

more of an opportunistic species rather than specialist (Sales-Luís et al., 2007; Pedroso et al., 

2014a).  

The Mediterranean climate region, where the south and part of the central region of 

Portugal are included, has in water availability one of the most important limiting factors to 

otters (Beja, 1992; Prenda et al., 2001). In these regions permanent reservoirs are a viable 

complement for otter hunting territories (Prenda et al., 2001; Basto et al., 2011; Pedroso et al., 

2014b) in dry seasons. In wet seasons, when water availability and food are not limiting factors, 

otters are mostly influenced by human activities and surrounding landscape features (Prenda et 

al., 2001; Basto et al., 2011; Reid et al., 2013). 

Watercourses with a well-developed riparian cover are optimal habitats for otters (Beja, 

1992), with vegetation cover favouring water retention during dry seasons and consequently 

prey availability (Basto et al., 2011). These characteristics make reservoirs, with fluctuating 

water levels and low vegetation cover in the margins, a low priority landscape element for otters 

(Basto et al., 2011; (Pedroso et al., 2014a), especially when outside otter’s original territories. 

Riparian cover, refuge availability and mostly water and prey availability are the principal drivers 

of otter’s distribution (Prenda et al., 2001; Pedroso et al., 2014a). 

Disturbances imposed to the above referred environmental factors caused the decline 

of otter populations in Europe during the last century (Ruiz-Olmo et al., 2001; Roos et al., 2015). 

The frequent cut of riparian vegetation, reducing cover and increasing water evaporation and 

consequently lack of prey (Beja, 1992; Pedroso et al., 2014a), the increase of pollutants on 

aquatic systems, the bioaccumulation of toxic residues and overfishing (Ruiz-Olmo et al., 2001; 

Pedroso et al., 2014a) are main disturbances affecting otters. 

 The specificity of the otter ecological requirements, as well as its sensitivity to sudden 

environmental changes, leaded in the 1970’s to severe population declines and consequent 

population fragmentation and isolation, in some of its peripheral regions (Roos et al., 2015). By 

then the species gained the status of a threatened species in global terms (Foster-Turley et al., 



 

 

8 

1990) and several studies were devoted to the species (MacDonald and Mason, 1994; Cortés et 

al., 1998; Jiménez et al., 2008). 

After a few pilot studies in the 80’s and 90’s, the IUCN – OSG (Otter Specialist Group) 

established a standard monitoring method, based on a 10 x 10 km UTM square grid approach, 

for monitoring the species spatial distribution and temporal trends (Reuther et al., 2000). This 

method was also used for monitoring the otter population in Portugal (Trindade et al., 1998; 

Sales-Luís et al., 2012), Spain (Jiménez et al., 2008) and many other countries (Sales-Luís et al., 

2012).  

Following the recognition of the species global decline, several conservation actions 

were taken allowing the species recovery in most of its original range. For instance after the 

decline observed in the 1970’s (Cortés et al., 1998; Jiménez et al., 2008), the Spanish otter 

population showed recovery signs related to the expansion of the American crayfish (Ruiz-Olmo 

and Clavero, 2008), as well as to the improvement of watercourses quality and the reduction in 

toxic pollutants (Cortés et al., 1998; Jiménez et al., 2008).  

 Today the Eurasian otter is classified as Near Threatened (NT) by the International Union 

for Conservation of Nature - IUCN (Roos et al., 2015), being also listed in Appendix I of 

Washington Convention (CITES), Appendix II of the Bern Convention and Annexes II and IV of the 

EU Habitats and Species Directives (Roos et al., 2015).  

In Portugal, a nation-wide distribution map was created in 1995 and, in spite of 

considering the otter population as one of the most viable and well spread in Europe, highlighted 

critical areas and priority sites for the species conservation (Trindade et al., 1998). Since then, 

Portuguese otter populations have been studied in different systems and scale of analysis (e.g. 

freshwater courses, dams, fish farms, hydrographic regions, protected areas) (Freitas et al., 

2007; Pedroso et al., 2007; Sales-Luís et al., 2007;  Novais et al., 2010; Basto et al., 2011). The 

species broad distribution, and presumably high abundance, lead to a change in the otter status 

from Insufficiently Known (Cabral et al., 1990) to Least Concern (LC) (Cabral et al., 2005). 

As a consequence of the species being included in the EU Habitats and Species Directives 

(Roos et al., 2015), otter populations have to be monitored over time (Reid et al., 2013). 

Nevertheless in Portugal, besides the 1995’s national census (Trindade et al., 1998), were all 989 

10x10 km squares were surveyed, and a partial one (211 of 989 10x10 km squares were 

surveyed) conducted in 1998 (Farinha, 1999), no other large-scale census was conducted in the 

last two decades.

The long time lapse from the last large-scale evaluation of the species distribution, and 

the obligatory monitoring rule from EU Habitats and Species Directives make this project should 

be viewed as an important contribution to understand the spatial and temporal trends in otter 

distribution in Portugal, being the extent of occurrence one of the quantitative criteria needed 

to evaluate species status (Rodrigues et al., 2006). 

 

 

2. Objectives 
 

1 Update the otter distribution map in the south-central region of Portugal and identify 

the factors influencing the species distribution in that region; 

2 Compare the present and 1995 spatial distribution patterns and address the temporal 

trend after 20 years;  

3 Identify areas where species is absent and important areas for otter conservation; 

4 Propose conservation measures for sustaining otter populations.

3. Methods 
 

3.1. Study Area 

 

 Located in the south-central region of Portugal, the selected study comprises three 

hydrographic regions (Tejo, Sado and Guadiana) and extends from Portalegre (east) to the 

Atlantic shore (west) and from Leiria (north) to Ourique (south).  

 Giving the time and financial constrains to a nation-wide survey (corresponding to 986 

10x10 km UTM squares), the study area was selected based on the following criteria: (i) sub-

sample of the total area surveyed in 1995 (Trindade et al., 1998), including both confirmed otter 

presence and absence areas; (ii) inclusion of the largest critical areas for otters identified in 1995; 

(iii) inclusion of has many river basins as possible, like Sado river basin that were also subsampled 

(50% of area) in 2002 (Sales-Luís et al., 2012), and (iv) preference for areas subject to 

environmental pressures. 

 Based on the above mentioned criteria, 4 river basins and one coastal region were fully 

or partially surveyed, totalising 300 10x10km UTM squares (Fig. 1) distributed as follows: 

? Tejo hydrographic region (202 UTM squares) - largest region in the study area, and where 

most negative results were found in 1995 (Trindade et al., 1998), being sub-divided in three 

areas: 

o Lis river basin (11 squares); 

o Tejo river basin, sub-divided in five areas: 

? Tributaries of right bank (26 squares); 

? Tributaries of left bank (35 squares); 

? Sorraia river basin (56 squares); 

? Zêzere river basin (25 squares); 

? Tejo estuary, Costa da Caparica and Arrábida (15 squares). 

o West coastal riverine region between Lis and Tejo basins (34 squares). 

? Sado hydrographic region (80 squares); 

? Guadiana hydrographic region (18 squares).

3.2. Otter Survey 
 

 Otter surveys followed the standard method proposed by Macdonald (1983) and 

recognised by IUCN Otter Specialist Group (OSG) for large scale monitoring purposes (Reuther 

et al., 2000). In a geographic information system (GIS) program, Quantum GISTM, the study area 

was divided into the 10 x10 km square grid (Fig. 1). In each square, one or two transects, with 

maximum length of 600m, were performed on freshwater bodies, ending as soon as an otter 

sign was found. If no evidence of otter presence was found in these transects, three spot checks 

(20-25m of length) were conducted in optimal marking sites (e.g. under bridges or in river 

junctions), based on previous knowledge on the species marking activity (Foster-Turley et al., 

1990). Presence signs assumed the form of tracks, spraints (otter scats) and jellies (viscous anal 

secretions).  Conducted between September 2014 and April 2015, transects were established, 

as much as possible, in exact same places selected in the 1995 study (Trindade et al., 1998) in 

order to allow data comparability. 

For each sampling site, besides the type and quantity of otter signs, information was 

registered about the aquatic system, vegetation cover and human intervention for posterior 

analysis at the local scale (Table 1). Besides the positive/negative dichotomy, when freshwater 

was unavailable negative squares were classified as dry squares.

Table 1 (cont.). Local scale attributes of sampling sites for otter survey. 

 

 While local scale attributes characterise transects / spot checks sites, study area 

(macroscale) attributes reflect availability in each 10x10 km square. Macroscale parameters 

were chosen accordingly to their relevance for otter ecology (e.g. Beja, 1992; Prenda et al., 2001; 

Ruiz-Olmo and Jiménez, 2008; Pedroso et al., 2014b) and classified in three types: water 

availability, human pressure and water quality (Table 2).

3.3. Statistical analysis 
 

The comparative analysis of the otter surveys of 1995 and 2014/2015 was mostly 

descriptive, considering the limitations of using a binary variable like otter’s presence/absence. 

Nevertheless, the McNemar’s chi-square test (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) was used to show if 

there was significant changes in otter’s presence/absence between the study years and among 

the sampled sub-basins. 

Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the effect of the macroscale 

attributes (environmental and human-related explanatory variables) on the presence/absence 

of otter in each square and therefore identifying the combination of variables that explain 

otter’s distribution. This analysis can use categorical and non-normally distributed data and also 

continuous and/or normally distributed data, since linearity between the dependent and each 

explanatory variable is ensured (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000). The linearity of the continuous 

explanatory variables was initially checked with the Box-Tidwell test at a significance level of 

0.05 (Menard, 2001). As this assumption was violated all the explanatory variables were 

categorized, based on their quartiles, and data linearity was checked again using the Mantel–

Haenszel test at a significance level of 0.05 (McDonald, 2014). Finally, the non-linear categorized

15 

variables were coded as categorical variables (dummy variables) and linear categorized variables 

were treated as continuous in the logistic regression procedure (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000) 

The association between the explanatory variables and the presence/absence of otter 

was tested using the maximum likelihood method (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000). A stepwise 

forward selection procedure was applied, based on the Wald’s test (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 

2000). The type and degree of association of each variable with the presence of the species was 

determined using the odds ratio (?). To assess the fit of the model, the Likelihood ratio test (G-

test) and a classification table were used. The G-test compared the deviance of the model 

considering only the constant versus the final model, based on a chi-squared distribution at a 

significance level of 0.05 (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000). 

Multicollinearity is a statistical phenomenon in which predictor variables in a logistic 

regression model are highly correlated, leading to unreliable and unstable estimates of 

regression coefficients. This problem was overcome by retaining only the most biologically 

meaningful variable in the analysis, for pairs of variables with Pearson’s correlation coefficient 

higher than 0.70. 

In an effort to further detail the relationships between the macroscale attributes and 

otter’s distribution, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of each square was performed, 

codifying the samples based on the presence/absence of otter and on the sampled sub-basins. 

The PCA was complemented with a Hierarchical Cluster Analysis of the same data using the 

complete-Linkage method and the Euclidean distance as dissimilarity measure (dendrogram not 

shown) in order to identify groups of squares based on the environmental and human-related 

explanatory variables. These groups were then overlaid on the PCA biplot, allowing a joint 

interpretation of the results. Prior to these analyses, continuous data were ln (x + 1) transformed 

to improve normality (Legendre and Legendre, 1998). 

All the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 21.0 and Primer 6.0 and R 3.2.1.

4. Results  
 

4.1. Otter Survey 
 

Of the total 300 grid squares (10x10 km) surveyed for otter presence, 4.3% were 

classified as “Dry”, since freshwater was unavailable permanently or temporally, at the moment 

of field work. The remaining 88.3% were scored as positive and 7.3% has negative. For statistical 

propose “Dry” count as “Negative” for otter presence, once the field work was made in the rainy 

seasons (Fall, Winter and early Spring) and no signs of water was found. 

Survey results highlighted two main areas of otter’s absence namely near Porto de Mós 

and surrounding Tejo estuary (Figure 2). 

 

Figure 2. Otter distribution in the study area in 2015 (Appendix 1 full page). 



 

 

17 

 As figure 3A shows, 14 types of aquatic systems were surveyed. The most surveyed 

systems were “Stream”, “River” and “Reservoir”. “Channel”, “Shore/beach”, “River mouth”, 

“Fish-farm”, “Salt marsh” and “Dry” showed propensity to negative results for otter presence 

(Figure 3B). Inversely, “Reservoir tail”, “Pond”, “Lagoon”, “Surface runoff” and “Irrigation ditch” 

apparently proved to be favourable habitats for otters (Figure 3B).

Most of otter positive sites are characterized by a regular presence of water, natural 

margins and a dense herbaceous cover (Figure 4A, B and C). In other hand, increased flow speed, 

dense shrubby cover, pollution and a lack of aquatic vegetation seem to have a negative effect 

on otters (Figure 4D, E, F and G, respectively). Variables like width and depth and arboreal cover 

suggest not having an influence in otter’s distribution (Figure 4H, I and J). Finally, the main 

substrate of the water body bed (Figure 4K) has barely any influence on otter’s presence but its 

size can influence detectability of otter’s signs.

The resulting model shows a good performance explaining 90% of the variance (Table

presence (96.2%) by opposition to correct classification of otter absence (45.7%).

PCA results (Figures 5 and 6) are in agreement of the previous result as a clear 

segregation is observed between surveyed squares on the basis of its macroscale attributes and 

reveals a good explanation of data variability (54.1%). Although all variables were used in these 

procedures, just the ones showing correlation with the two first components (axis), and 

therefore important variables for data discrimination (|r| &gt;= 0.5; P &amp;lt;0.05), are shown: Small 

reservoir, Population Density, Urban area and Road density for the 1st axis (PC1) and Order 1, 

Order 2, Total order, Order diversity and Monthly precipitation for the 2 nd axis (PC2). Graphical 

analysis show a good relation between variables and otter’s presence (Figure 5) and a 

geographical gradient per sub-basin (Figure 6) mostly defined by PC1. Alongside with the PCA, a 

Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) was conducted in order to group squares with similar 

response to variables. The three resulting groups are defined in Figures 5 and 6 by A, B and C 

and allowed the identification of the geographical gradient.

4.2. Data comparison of the 1995 and 2015 surveys 
 

Comparing today’s results - 265 (88.3%) of positive squares for otter presence – with 

those obtained in 1995 - 239 (79.1%) (Figure 7 – Trindade et al. 1998), an increase of 9.2% is 

observed for the otter occurrence in the area. This represents an overall positive evolution of 

otter’s distribution, although otters are still absent in some areas (Figure 2).  

Analysing results at the square level (Figures 8 and 9), 85% maintain the same result 

(stable) as in 1995, 12% are now positive (expansion) and just 3% change from positive to 

negative (retraction). In relation to sub-basins (Figure 1), McNemar’s test results showed that 

only Tejo river right bank tributaries (TDR) had significant changes (p &amp;lt;0.001) (Table 5), once 13 

squares here previously negative and are now positive (Appendix 2). Lis and Sorraia river basins 

were the only ones where no change was observed along this 20 year period.

In a partial study conducted by Farinha (1999) in 1998 (where sampled 10x10 km 

squares are randomly surveyed), Tejo river basin and riverine costal region between Lis and Tejo 

basins had already some improvement in otter distribution (7 and 1 squares expansion, 

respectively). On the other hand, Sado river basin showed a retraction in 2 squares, between 

1995 and 1998 (Farinha, 1999).  In a more recent study (Sales-Luís et al., 2012), Sado river basin 

results maintain stable when compared to 1995 in the wet season though when compared to 

this work (2015) there is a retraction of 1 square. 

 

 

4.3. Priority sites for conservation 
 

 As a result of the 1995 survey, Trindade et al. (1998) defined some areas as critical for 

otter conservation, considering the large areas with scarce otter presence and high disturbance 

factors that, according to the authors, put in risk population viability. Of the four defined areas, 

the two largest ones, North of Lisbon and Setúbal Peninsula, are included in the present 

surveyed area (Figure 10A). In 2015 survey showed a more favourable situation as from a total 

of 28 positive squares in 1995 an increase to 52 positive squares was observed in 2015 (Figure 

10B).

Figure 10. Critical areas defined by Trindade et al. (1998) overlapped with results of 1995 (A) and 2015 (B) surveys. 
For statistical propose “Dry” count as “Negative” for otter presence. 

 

 Based on otter’s relative abundance and in the size and quality (state of conservation) 

of aquatic environments, Trindade et al. (1998) also defined 86 important sites named as 

Conservation Priority Sites. Eighteen of these are included in the study area (Figure 11). These 

sites were divided in three categories: priority site (High Priority); important site (Medium 

Priority); and site under consideration (Low priority), for otter’s conservation. As Figure 11 

shows, priority sites in the study area have different sizes and shapes and the Low priority ones 

that had a strong incidence of otter’s absence in 1995 stay fairly stable (still negative) in the 

2015 survey. Overall, the observed expansion of the otter’s distribution does not alter the status 

at the Priority Sites, once both years’ results are similar.

4.4. Efficiency of the survey method 
 

 In order to test the efficiency of the combined survey method a comparison was made 

between spot checks and transect results. Testing distance as a factor for otter presence, the 

focus was to try to understand the minimum sampling distance for otter detection (Figure 12). 

For comparative purposes, spot check results and its sampling order (if otter was detected on 

the 1st, 2nd or 3rd spot) was also addressed (Figure 13). As shown in figure 12, almost all otter’s 

signs (97%) were found within the 250m mark and most of them (81%) even until the 50m mark. 

On the other side, the last spot checks have in overall a better result than the first spot checks 

(Figure 13). Across the entire field work, for a total of 366 surveys, 265 were transects (of which 

236 positive for otter presence) and 101 were spot checks (29 positive for otter presence).

5. Discussion 
 

5.1. Otter Survey 
 

Although merely in a descriptive way, this study allowed to relate otter presence with 

the type of surveyed system and its local scale characteristics. Being a semi-aquatic species, otter 

presence was expected in places with freshwater availability (e.g. Beja, 1992; Prenda et al., 2001) 

and, as much as possible, in areas with adequate conditions for refuge and cover (Barbosa et al., 

2001). Strong flows and lack of aquatic vegetation, which improves the evasion or explains 

absence of otter prey (Basto et al., 2011), human interventions like watercourses channelling 

and pollution (Trindade et al., 1998), and apparently water salinity (shores, beaches and salt 

marshes), characterize the areas where surveys were negative for otters. Nevertheless, it is 

known that coastal otters can feed in marine waters (Beja, 1997), although individuals need 

freshwater availability to wash the fur in order to preserve its insulating capacity (Beja, 1992). 

In spite of the few sampling sites on marine waters, the negative results seem more related to 

other conditions, like human pressure, rather than by the aquatic systems themselves. 

Negative surveys are also related to a high density of shrubs. This influence may be associated 

to a decrease in potential marking sites and lack of detectability from the observer and not a 

direct result of otter absence. A higher percentage of cover usually implies more refuge, which 

is considered advantageous for the species. This negative association between cover and otter 

detection was already referred by Pedroso et al. (2007) which stated that more cover also 

negatively affects the number of conspicuous sprainting sites and consequently may lead to false 

absences. 

Water body substrate composition appears to have little influence on otter presence 

but may bias otter marks detectability (Reid et al., 2013). In thinner materials, like mud or sand, 

due to the compact property is easy to find otter’s footprints but in larger materials, like rocks 

and blocks, spraints are the ones that can be easily detected. On the other hand, in gravel it is 

harder to find footprints or spraints, due to their size, shape and colours can be hard to detect. 

 On the macroscale analysis, and as defined by the logistic regression results, small 

reservoirs, population density, collective septic tanks, order 2 watercourses and watercourses 

order diversity are the attributes that influence otter presence at the 10x10km scale. Small 

reservoirs, Order 2 and Order diversity, all showing a positive relation with otter presence, are 

directly associated to water availability. Small reservoirs, commonly used for cattle raising and 



 

 

29 

agriculture purposes in southern Portugal where most of watercourses are dry in summer, are 

a suitable alternative as otter’s foraging territories (Prenda et al., 2001; Basto et al., 2011). Order 

diversity and Order 2 variables give two different views of the freshwater lotic grid. On one hand, 

Order diversity means the overall available watercourses, independently of size, length or water 

capacity. On the other hand Order 2 is the second most significant attribute (P=0.010) and 

represent permanent watercourses by opposition to Order 1 watercourses, that are smallest 

and consequently ephemeral, being dry during most of the year . Order 2 are also the most 

common type of stream/rivers available in the study area. Overall these attributes are indicators 

of permanent freshwater availability considered the most important factor for otter’s 

distribution mainly in summer (Beja, 1992; Prenda et al., 2001; Pedroso et al., 2014a). Population 

density, the most significant variable of the model, has a negative association with otter’s 

presence (Barbosa et al., 2001). Being a top predator, otters have few or non-potential threats 

in the study area relatively to predators. Human presence on the other hand can cause several 

problems to otter conservation like habitat loss modification (e.g. water drainage, riparian 

vegetation degradation) or accidental killings (e.g. road kills). Although not a significant variable 

per si, Collective septic tanks was included in the regression model, but oddly had a positive 

association with otter’s presence. This interaction can be probably explained by the increase of 

organic material in water systems and consequently the increase of its productivity positively 

influencing otter prey, since most of these discharges into the aquatic system are of human 

disposal (organic material) and not of industrial nature. 

 As the logistic regression model results, also the PCA results demonstrate water 

availability variables strongly associated with the positive survey results. On the other hand 

human pressure variables, like population density, appears to strongly influence most of otter’s 

absence, mainly when water availability is scarce. The same applies to sub-basins with clustering 

analysis identifying a geographic subdivision. Setúbal Peninsula (A) represents a small and highly 

populated region with a Mediterranean temperate climate and a lack of freshwater systems. On 

the other hand the right side of Tejo river (B) is dominated by watercourses of diverse orders 

and a maritime climate that makes precipitation a key variable to maintain water availability, 

but some large and high density urban areas occur in left side of the river. Finally, we found the 

south basins (C), in a low human density area, mostly with Mediterranean temperate climate, 

relying on reservoirs as freshwater principal resource.

5.2. Surveys comparison and priority sites for conservation 
 

 In 20 years, otter’s distribution denotes an expansion of almost 10% (79.1% in 1995 to 

88.3% in 2015). This increase is related to the improvement of Tejo river right bank tributaries, 

probably because of water quality management and American crayfish invasion. In this work, 

otter feeding habits were not considered. Nevertheless a rough observation of the spraints 

found during fieldwork showed that most of the spraints were mainly composed of crayfish, an 

invasive widespread freshwater crustacean known to be a very important prey species for otter, 

namely in the study area (Beja, 1996; Sales-Luís et al., 2007). 

According to the 1995 survey (Trindade et al., 1998), the regions at North of Lisbon and 

Setúbal Peninsula were two critical areas for otter conservation at the national level. Present 

results, twenty years apart, show an improved situation with a large number of positive squares 

in the CLT+TDR (Figure 10B) while Setúbal Peninsula critical area stayed fairly the same. The 

large region at North Lisbon seems now to be divided in two smaller critical areas, Lisbon region 

at south and Porto de Mós surroundings at north (Appendix 3). 

 Of all important areas for otter conservation, high and medium priority sites as defined 

by Trindade et al. (1998), showed positive results for otter presence. Compared to the other 

classes, Low priority sites have worst results, with fairly half of their squares as negatives, but in 

overall this results stay similar to Trindade et al. (1998) results. The main area of today’s otter 

absence locates in the Setúbal Peninsula, a dry and heavy populated region that remained 

mostly negative after 20 years. The other two otter absence areas, previously in the same large 

area, are now divided and overlaps almost exactly with two low priority sites defined in 1995 

(Trindade et al. 1998).

5.3. Survey’s method efficiency 
 

 Field work results show that shortening the standardized 600m transects has no 

influence on the survey outcomes once after 250m it is unlikely to find otter signs. This results 

are in agreement with the ones of 1998 partial national census (Farinha, 1999), where 87% of 

positive surveys were under 200m. When transects are unavailable or negative, the IUCN 

standard methodology recommends to survey a maximum of three ideal places to find otter’s 

marks, the called spot checks. This practice requires some time and fund resources and a 

selection criteria of proximity was applied, but close (the 1st) spot checks showed the worst 

results. Negative results like this could be caused by the same factors that prevent otter 

presence detection on sampled transects. In some squares no spot checks could be performed 

mostly because of inexistent freshwater sites or inaccessible ones. In these conditions, surveyed 

sites are not optimal but the possible ones. 

 The comparison of transects and spot checks results, suggest the appropriateness of 

some changes in standard field methodology for otter monitoring. For instance, there is few or 

no benefit of conducting 600m transects, as shorter ones (e.g., 400m) should suffice. Another 

methodological change could be to increase the spot checks length from 25m to 50m, once our 

results show that 81% of the otter’s signs were found under the 50m mark. Finally, doing firstly 

the spot checks should allow a quicker survey, and transects could work as last resort.

6. Conclusion 
 

In summary, Eurasian otter distribution in the study area is mostly positively influenced 

by freshwater availability. When water is a limiting factor and the negative impact of human 

population density is too high, there are no conditions for otter’s occurrence (e.g. critical areas). 

Probably even more important than human density, but still related, is the lack of habitat for 

otters caused by water pollution and human’s nature-changing actions, like watercourses 

channelling. Nevertheless, the positive evolution of otter distribution throughout the last two 

decades is clear. 

In general, population decrease is a fast process but their recovery, as well as their 

habitat recovery, is a slow, expensive and sometimes unsuccessful process (Foster-Turley et al., 

1990). In Portugal, previous studies suggest a healthy population but this assumption is solely 

based on otter distribution data as no population estimates were ever made at the national 

level. To prevent a similar fate as other European populations that in the past became extinct or 

threatened it is important to establish some practical conservation measures: 

- Population monitoring at regular intervals to estimative population size - by molecular 

analysis of spraints, visual individuals counting or videotaping (depending on human and 

financial resources) – and population shifts; 

- Establish legal and/or structural measures to reduce road kills and watercourses 

modifications; 

- Promote effective protection of the Conservation Priority Sites, especially those ranked as 

high and medium priority; 

- Establish tighter control of watercourse pollution; 

- Reinforce environmental education actions of the human populations, mainly the ones 

directly related to freshwater habitats (e.g. fishermen and fishfarmers).
