Abstract. Providing reliable estimates of streamflow and hy-
drological fluxes is a major challenge for water resources
management over national and transnational basins in South
America. Global hydrological models and land surface mod-
els are a possible solution to simulate the terrestrial wa-
ter cycle at the continental scale, but issues about parame-
terization and limitations in representing lowland river sys-
tems can place constraints on these models to meet local
needs. In an attempt to overcome such limitations, we ex-
tended a regional, fully coupled hydrologic–hydrodynamic
model (MGB; Modelo hidrológico de Grandes Bacias) to
the continental domain of South America and assessed
its performance using daily river discharge, water lev-
els from independent sources (in situ, satellite altimetry),
estimates of terrestrial water storage (TWS) and evapo-
transpiration (ET) from remote sensing and other avail-
able global datasets. In addition, river discharge was com-
pared with outputs from global models acquired through
the eartH2Observe project (HTESSEL/CaMa-Flood, LIS-
FLOOD and WaterGAP3), providing the first cross-scale as-
sessment (regional/continental×global models) that makes
use of spatially distributed, daily discharge data. A satisfac-
tory representation of discharge and water levels was ob-
tained (Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE &gt; 0.6 in 55 % of the
cases) and the continental model was able to capture patterns
of seasonality and magnitude of TWS and ET, especially over
the largest basins of South America. After the comparison

with global models, we found that it is possible to obtain
considerable improvement on daily river discharge, even by
using current global forcing data, just by combining parame-
terization and better routing physics based on regional expe-
rience. Issues about the potential sources of errors related to
both global- and continental-scale modeling are discussed, as
well as future directions for improving large-scale model ap-
plications in this continent. We hope that our study provides
important insights to reduce the gap between global and re-
gional hydrological modeling communities.

1 Introduction

Reliable simulations of streamflow dynamics and related
processes are vital to support water resources management
regarding water security, natural hazards, navigation, agricul-
ture and energy production. Therefore, improved predictions
of the hydrological system can aid policymakers and stake-
holders in making better decisions, also fostering actions to
reduce risk and impacts on water resources under current and
future conditions. In South America, recent important floods
(e.g., Marengo et al., 2012; Hoyos et al., 2013; Ovando et
al., 2016) and droughts (Melo et al., 2016; Erfanian et al.,
2017), together with uncertainties about the potential effects
of climate change (Marengo et al., 2009), are encouraging
new strategies for meeting social, economic and environmen-

tal water demands in large river basins all over the continent,
some of them extending beyond political borders.

In this context, large-scale hydrological models arise as
important tools for simulating the terrestrial phase of the wa-
ter cycle. Despite limitations related to observed (in situ)
data, especially in developing countries, advances in compu-
tational resources and remote sensing technologies are push-
ing such models toward continental and global scales with
increasing resolution (Wood et al., 2011; Bierkens, 2015;
Bierkens et al., 2015; Sood and Smathkin, 2015). Currently,
estimates of water fluxes at these scales are usually ob-
tained using two modeling frameworks, namely global hy-
drological models (GHMs) and land surface models (LSMs)
(Haddeland et al., 2011). While GHMs are more concerned
with water resources assessment and lateral transfer of wa-
ter, thus enabling quantification of human impacts and wa-
ter scarcity/stress (e.g., Döll et al., 2009; Wada et al., 2011),
LSMs were primarily developed to provide lower boundary
conditions for atmospheric circulation models, i.e., having
a particular focus on vertical fluxes of heat and water (e.g.,
Balsamo et al., 2009). The latter are often coupled (i.e, in of-
fline mode) to global river routing models designed for trans-
porting water along drainage networks (e.g., Decharme et al.,
2008; Zaitchik et al., 2010; Yamazaki et al., 2011; Getirana
et al., 2012), which also enables the conversion from surface
and groundwater runoff into river discharge and other surface
water variables (e.g., flood extent, water level).

Although global-scale models can provide valuable spa-
tiotemporal estimates of water fluxes and projections of those
estimates (Sood and Smakthin, 2015), their ability to repro-
duce discharge observations at basin scale and to address
practical water management issues is still limited (Archfield
et al., 2015; Hattermann et al., 2018). Inaccuracies in runoff
estimation from GHMs and LSMs may be first attributed
to the uncertainty in global satellite precipitation products
(Tian and Peters-Lidard, 2010; Sperna Weiland et al., 2015),
but several studies have shown considerable differences be-
tween model outputs even when using the same meteorologi-
cal forcing, given the lack of knowledge about runoff genera-
tion processes and deficiencies in parameter estimation (e.g.,
Haddeland et al., 2011; Gudmundsson et al., 2012; Zhou
et al., 2012; Beck et al., 2017a). In particular, calibration
has been found to have the largest impact on storage fluxes,
evapotranspiration and discharge in comparison to variations
in model structure and forcing data (Müller Schmied et al.,
2014), which is a reason to call for efforts on this exercise as
many of the GHMs and LSMs are not calibrated (Sood and
Smathkin, 2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Beck et al., 2017a).

An alternative to overcome some limitations of GHMs and
LSMs is to expand the spatial domain of hydrological mod-
els that were initially developed for catchment to regional
scales. Applying these models at national (e.g., Crooks et al.,
2014) to continental domains (e.g., Abbaspour et al., 2015;
Pechlivanidis and Arheimer, 2015; Donnelly et al., 2016)
translates into a better use of local expert knowledge and

country-specific datasets that may be difficult to reach glob-
ally. At the same time, it is possible to focus on regionally
relevant processes that are usually not included or not well
resolved in global models. In South America, for example,
several previous studies suggested that lateral water fluxes
in large lowland rivers should be resolved using hydrody-
namic routing (e.g., Paiva et al., 2011, 2013; Paz et al., 2011,
2014; Yamazaki et al., 2011; Pontes et al., 2017; Zhao et al,
2017), while GHMs generally apply methods based on con-
stant/variable velocity or a kinematic simplification of the
St. Venant equations (see the overview by Kauffeldt et al.,
2016 and Bierkens, 2015). Even if LSMs can be coupled of-
fline to more physically based global river routing models
(e.g., Yamazaki et al., 2011; Getirana et al., 2017b), calibra-
tion in the latter is likely to compensate for errors in runoff
generation (Pappenberger et al., 2010; Getirana et al., 2013;
Hodges, 2013) and lack of relevant vertical hydrological pro-
cesses linked to river–floodplain dynamics (e.g., Pedinotti
et al., 2012; Paz et al., 2014; Fleischmann et al., 2018).
In turn, fully coupled large-scale hydrologic–hydrodynamic
models (e.g., Paiva et al., 2013) can handle the above inter-
actions while using one single modeling framework, and are
now feasible for using in continental domains because re-
cent routing schemes (e.g., Bates et al., 2010) have proved
to be computationally efficient for both regional (Getirana et
al., 2017b; Pontes et al., 2017; Fleischmann et al., 2018) and
global simulations (Yamazaki et al., 2013).

Over the past decades, skill in streamflow prediction has
been emphasized in catchment- to regional-scale modeling
(Archfield et al., 2015), but there is a growing opportunity
to perform further spatial analyses rather than just relying
on point measurements. Currently, a wide range of remote
sensing products can be used to assess other variables than
discharge, such as terrestrial water storage (e.g., Tapley et al.,
2004; Watkins et al., 2015), evapotranspiration (e.g., Miralles
et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2018), soil moisture (e.g., Kerr et
al., 2012) or water surface elevation derived from satellite
altimetry (e.g., Santos da Silva et al., 2010). Previous stud-
ies have shown the utility of the aforementioned datasets not
only to validate hydrological/routing models (e.g., Alkama et
al., 2010; Getirana et al., 2012; Paiva et al., 2013) but also as
an interesting tool to constrain and estimate model parame-
ters (Getirana, 2010; Werth and Güntner, 2010; López López
et al., 2017). Therefore, remote sensing products can be help-
ful for continental-scale modeling in assessing regions where
streamflow data are scarce, as well as to outline areas in
which future model improvements are potentially needed.

In parallel, the interest in building catchment/regional
models up to continental domains, together with global mod-
els trying to be locally relevant through hyper-resolution
(Wood et al., 2011), fosters the need to reduce the gap be-
tween these two modeling communities (Bierkens et al.,
2015; Archfield et al., 2015). If the primary goal of a con-
tinental model is to provide estimates of river discharge to
support regional water management practices, the results can

also be compared with outputs of global models to assess
both the performance and potential shortcomings of these
models under a regional perspective. In recent years, there
has been an increasing number of studies assessing outputs
of LSMs through multimodel intercomparison (e.g., Zaitchik
et al., 2010; Gudmundsson et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2012),
sometimes in conjunction with GHMs (e.g., Haddeland et al.,
2011; Beck et al., 2017a). Other recent studies focused on in-
tercomparison of regional models in large basins around the
world, usually relating overall performance to a single gauge
station and having a particular interest in monthly statis-
tics (e.g., Huang et al., 2016; Eisner et al., 2017; Krysanova
et al., 2017). Moreover, little attention has been given to
the intercomparison of global- and regional-scale models,
and the existing studies only focused on monthly to annual
flows (e.g., Zhang et al., 2016) and projection of climate
change impacts using a small number of gauge stations (e.g.,
Gosling et al., 2011; Hattermann et al., 2018). As stream-
flow is highly variable over space and at short timescales
(i.e., daily), model performance should be assessed with spa-
tially distributed data within large basins and at sub-monthly
intervals (e.g., Wu et al., 2014; Beck et al., 2017a; Zhao
et al., 2017), but to our knowledge, no cross-scale (i.e., re-
gional/continental×global models) intercomparison with a
comprehensive evaluation of daily river discharge has been
carried out over South America.

In this paper, we aim to start bridging this gap by
(i) extending a regional-scale, fully coupled hydrologic–
hydrodynamic model to the entirety of South America, as-
sessing its ability to represent discharge and other hydro-
logical variables across the continent; (ii) exploring how
discharge estimates from continental-scale modeling per-
form when compared to those estimated with state-of-the-
art global models and (iii) identifying the issues that should
be addressed for improving continental-/global-scale model-
ing in this continent. The next sections provide a brief de-
scription of (i) the major river systems of South America,
(ii) modeling approaches, (iii) datasets selected for valida-
tion, (iv) calibration procedures, (v) global models selected
for discharge comparison and (vi) metrics used for assess-
ment of results.

2 Overview of the major South American river systems

South America is one of the most freshwater-abundant re-
gions on Earth, contributing around 30 % of the global runoff
to the oceans (Clark et al., 2015) despite only having 12 % of
the total land area. Because of a combination of wide lati-
tudinal extent (10? N–55? S), major orographic features and
strong oceanic influences (Garcia and Mechoso, 2005; Vera
et al., 2006; Garreaud et al., 2009), the continent is subject
to a diverse climate that feeds 6 out of the 10 largest basins
in the world in terms of mean annual discharge, 4 of them
only within the Amazon (Latrubesse et al., 2005). In partic-

ular, the Amazon is probably the most relevant hydrological
system of the world, which attracts great scientific attention
due to its ecological importance and role in local to global
climate (Werth and Avissar, 2002; Vera et al., 2006).

Figure 1 presents general information about South Amer-
ica, including hydroclimatic characteristics, major wetlands
and hydrological regions. According to classifications of the
Food Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Brazilian National
Water Agency (ANA), the continent is partitioned into 27
major hydrological divisions, with the largest ones (Ama-
zon, La Plata and Orinoco basins) sharing much of their wa-
ter between different countries. Because almost 80 % of the
territory lies between the tropics, the continent is dominated
by an equatorial (tropical) climate that drives high amounts
of rainfall especially near the equator, but extreme condi-
tions also exist and range from very arid (such as the Ata-
cama desert in northern Chile) to polar areas over the Andes
Cordillera and south of Patagonia (southern Argentina and
Chile). As a result, water availability is subject to be highly
variable with large discrepancies in mean annual flows, for
example, 8.7 mm yr?1 at Desaguadero River in the Col-
orado basin (Canalejas gauge station, 1.8×105 km2) com-
pared with 2100 mm yr?1 at Japura River (Puerto Cordoba
gauge station, 1.5×105 km2), the latter located in the Ama-
zon basin.

Regarding river dynamics, flows in the Amazon are largely
affected by floodplains over extensive flat terrains, causing
significant flood peak delay and attenuation (Richey et al.,
1989; Alsdorf et al., 2007; Yamazaki et al., 2011; Paiva et
al., 2013). Because flood waves have travel times in the order
of a few months, sometimes out of phase because of the sea-
sonal differences in precipitation (Richey et al., 1989), rivers
are subject to strong backwater effects that extend for sev-
eral hundred kilometers upstream of the river mouth or the
confluence of its tributaries (Meade et al., 1991; Getirana
and Paiva, 2013; Paiva et al., 2013), existing in both high-
and low-water periods (Trigg et al., 2009). To the north, the
Orinoco basin shares some characteristics of the Amazon,
such as a unimodal flood pulse and low interannual variabil-
ity of floodplain inundation, especially in the Llanos region
(Hamilton et al., 2002). In addition, the high amplitude of
the mainstem water level – 14 to 16 m – produces backwa-
ter effects in its tributaries with strong hydrological gradients
(Rosales et al., 2002).

At the heart of South America, the La Plata basin plays a
major role in terms of agriculture, hydroelectricity and the
economy in general, corresponding to almost 70 % of the
combined gross domestic product in countries such as Ar-
gentina, Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil (Vera et al., 2006; Bar-
ros et al., 2006). La Plata is mainly composed of the Paraná
and Paraguay rivers and, to a lesser extent, the Uruguay
River, which are completely different with respect to flow
conditions. For example, the upper Paraná is largely regu-
lated by reservoirs (about 50 % of mean annual flow, accord-
ing to Su and Lettenmaier, 2009) and provides around 75 %

of discharge up to the confluence with Paraguay River, de-
spite the similar drainage area of both basins (? 106 km2)
(Barros et al., 2006). The Paraguay basin, on the other
hand, is largely influenced by one of the largest wetlands in
the world – the Pantanal – a complex anabranching river–
floodplain system characterized by very gentle slopes that
can be less than 1.5 cm km?1 (Tucci and Clarke, 1998;
Berbery and Barros, 2002; Paz et al., 2011; Bravo et al.,
2012). Much of the water stored in the floodplain at high
water does not return to the channels during the drying
phase and become available for evaporation and infiltration

(Paz et al., 2014), so flood waves are lagged by about 4–
6 months (Tucci and Clarke, 1998; Hamilton et al., 2002),
up to 60 % water volume can be lost (Gonçalves et al.,
2011), and the shape of downstream hydrographs is strongly
modified (Bravo et al., 2012). Moreover, huge areas on the
right overbank of the Paraguay River (Chaco Plain) have
poorly defined drainage networks associated with alluvial
megafans (Latrubesse, 2015), which makes this basin one of
the most challenging regions for hydrological modeling in
South America.

The headwaters of La Plata also border important hy-
drological systems such as the Tocantins–Araguaia and São
Francisco in a tropical wet–dry biome called Brazilian Cer-
rado (i.e., Brazilian savanna). The former is composed of To-
cantins and Araguaia rivers, flowing parallel northwards until
joining approximately 550 km upstream of the basin mouth
near the Amazon delta. While the Tocantins is marked by a
cascade of large dams, the Araguaia River is much less al-
tered and hosts the huge Bananal plain, which contributes
up to 30 % of reduction in peak discharge due to floodplain
inundation (Lininger and Latrubesse, 2016). Regarding São
Francisco, two-thirds of the runoff is generated at the up-
per part of the basin (Allasia et al., 2006) and the mainstem
crosses a semiarid region known as the “drought polygon”,
which affects several parts of Northeast Brazil including the
Parnaíba basin. At the south of the continent, rivers flow-
ing to the Atlantic Ocean correspond to less than 40 % of
the area (i.e., &gt; 60 % is related to endorheic basins) (Pasquini
and Depetris, 2007) and their annual cycles usually show two
maxima, one associated with the winter rainfalls and another
with snowmelt during spring and early summer (Rivera et al.,
2018).

3 Methods

3.1 MGB model

3.1.1 Model description

The MGB, Modelo hidrológico de Grandes Bacias
(Large-Scale Hydrological Model), is a conceptual, semi-
distributed, large-scale hydrological model first presented
by Collischonn et al. (2007). The choice of MGB for this
study was motivated by several past applications in South
America (Allasia et al., 2006), which encompassed rapid re-
sponse (e.g., Collischonn et al., 2005; Siqueira et al., 2016a)
to markedly seasonal and often slow response basins (e.g.,
Bravo et al., 2012; Paiva et al., 2013; Fan et al., 2016; Pontes
et al., 2017). In its most recent version, basins are divided
into unit catchments (Paiva et al., 2011; Pontes et al., 2017),
each one containing a single river reach with an associated
floodplain and hydrological vertical water balance. Combi-
nations of soil type and land use within each unit catchment
are categorized as Hydrological Response Units (HRUs).
Water and energy budgets are computed independently for
each HRU of each unit catchment, and soil is depicted as a
bucket model with a single layer. Canopy interception is rep-
resented in terms of leaf area index (LAI) and evapotranspi-
ration (soil, plant transpiration and open water evaporation)
is calculated using the Penman–Monteith equation. Surface
runoff is produced using the variable contribution area con-
cept following the Arno model (Todini, 1996), while ground-
water and subsurface flows are computed, respectively, with
linear and nonlinear functions according to water availability

in the soil layer. Runoff from each one of the components
(surface, subsurface and groundwater) is propagated to the
stream network using linear reservoirs (i.e., hillslope rout-
ing). As MGB was primarily developed for tropical regions,
snow processes are not represented in the current model ver-
sion.

Flow routing in river channels can be computed using
the Muskingum–Cunge method (Collischonn et al., 2007),
a one-dimensional full hydrodynamic method (Paiva et al.,
2013) or the local inertial method (Pontes et al., 2017). In
this work, the MGB was applied with the inertial routing as
described by Pontes et al. (2017), which uses the 1-D version
of the explicit local inertial approximation proposed by Bates
et al. (2010). The routing structure of MGB is similar to that
described by Yamazaki et al. (2011, 2013); i.e., the volume of
water stored in a given unit catchment is the only prognostic
variable, while other variables such as flow depth and flooded
area are diagnosed from the stored volume using floodplain
profiles derived using sub-grid topography. The floodplain is
treated as a simple storage model, and the water level for a
given time step is assumed to be constant along the entire
unit catchment. In addition, the model accounts for evapora-
tion in floodplains and infiltration from flooded areas to the
unsaturated soil (Fleischmann et al., 2018); thus feedbacks
between hydrological and hydrodynamic modules can also
be represented (i.e., a two-way coupling approach). Further
details on model water balance and flow routing equations
are presented in the Supplement Sect. S1.

3.1.2 GIS processing

All geoprocessing steps were conducted using an adapted
version of the IPH-Hydro Tools package (Siqueira et al.,
2016b), using the 15 arcsec HydroSHEDS flow direction
map (Lehner et al., 2008) as the main input. We chose the
latter because it has received extensive corrections to ad-
dress topological problems in flat areas and endorheic re-
gions (Lehner et al., 2008) and has been successfully ap-
plied for river routing in other studies (e.g., Yamazaki et
al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2017). An upstream area threshold of
1000 km2 was adopted for the onset of drainage networks,
while unit catchments and river reaches were delineated us-
ing a fixed-length vector-based discretization of 1x = 15 km
(see Sect. S1.3 for details). This length threshold was se-
lected to ensure a balance between model stability and ef-
ficiency, resulting in an improved resolution when compared
with configurations used by Yamazaki et al. (2013) and Ge-
tirana et al. (2017b) for river routing with the local inertial
method at global and Amazon domains (grids with 0.25? res-
olution), respectively.

To estimate sub-grid floodplain topography, we first com-
puted the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) map
(Rennó et al., 2008) using flow directions and drainage net-
works derived from HydroSHEDS together with the Bare-
Earth SRTM v.1 digital elevation model (DEM) (O’Loughlin

www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/22/4815/2018/ Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 4815–4842, 2018



4820 V. A. Siqueira et al.: Toward continental hydrologic–hydrodynamic modeling in South America

et al., 2016), and further, a floodplain profile was created
at each unit catchment relating the HAND value, flooded
area and water volume, similarly to that done by Yamazaki
et al. (2013). The Bare-Earth SRTM, resampled from 3 to
15 arcsec to match the HydroSHEDS resolution, was adopted
to account for vegetation biases in floodplains since the C-
band radar used by the original SRTM is not able to pene-
trate fully through the canopy (Carabajal and Hardling, 2005;
Berry et al., 2007). Channel bed elevation at a given unit
catchment was estimated, subtracting channel bankfull depth
from river bank height (i.e., the elevation at bankfull depth)
(Yamazaki et al., 2011; Paiva et al., 2013), the latter also de-
rived from Bare-Earth SRTM. However, one of the draw-
backs of using an unconditioned DEM such as the Bare-
Earth SRTM is the high level of noise affecting channel bank
elevations, which need to be attenuated to avoid excessive
inundation in low-relief areas. Instead of applying smooth-
ing algorithms that modify the original DEM values (e.g.,
Paiva et al., 2011), a simple linear regression was fitted to
DEM pixels located over drainage networks within each unit
catchment (river reach). Channel bank heights were set as
the smoothed elevation associated with the center pixel of
each river reach, while the original DEM values remained
unchanged, for example, when computing the HAND model
and associated floodplain profiles (see Sects. S1.5 and S1.6
for more details).

3.1.3 River hydraulic geometry

Because flow routing is very sensitive to river geometry (Ya-
mazaki et al., 2011; Getirana et al., 2012; Paiva et al., 2013),
channel parameters such as bankfull width and depth must be
properly defined. However, detailed information about chan-
nel geometry is usually not available for large-scale basins
and a very common approach is to adopt classic hydraulic
geometry relationships (HGs) (Leopold and Maddock, 1953)
for specific sites according to drainage area or discharge
(Decharme et al., 2008; Yamazaki et al., 2011; Getirana et
al., 2012; Paiva et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2017; Pontes et al.,
2017). Here, the global database of Andreadis et al. (2013)
was used to set initial values of bankfull widths and depths,
which were derived from 2-year return period flows using
the Global Runoff Database Center (GRDC) data and uni-
versal HGs obtained from several rivers around the world.
In addition, regional HGs (Beighley and Gummaldi, 2011;
Paiva et al., 2011, 2013; Pontes, 2016) and width estimates
based on satellite imagery from Pontes (2016) were included
to improve the global channel geometries of Andreadis et
al. (2013) for Amazon and La Plata basins.

3.1.4 Model forcing

The Multi-Source Weighted Ensemble Precipitation –
MSWEP v1.1 (Beck et al., 2017b) – was used as precipitation
input to the rainfall-runoff module of the MGB model. This
is a 3-hourly, global-scale dataset (0.25? resolution) that opti-
mally combines satellite, reanalysis and daily gauge data, and
it has been evaluated with satisfactory results in a recent com-
parison of several precipitation datasets (Beck et al., 2017c).
Regarding climate variables used to compute evapotranspi-
ration, mean monthly data for the period 1961–1990 were
retrieved from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) Global Cli-
mate v.2 (New et al., 2002), which provides long-term clima-
tologies of temperature, pressure, radiation and wind speed
for all land areas at 10’ resolution.

3.1.5 Land use and soil data

Herein, we used the 400 m resolution HRU merged product
(soil+ land use) for South America (Fan et al., 2015), which
is available at https://www.ufrgs.br/lsh (last access: 24 April
2018). Basically, the soil map is a combination of the Brazil-
ian database RADAMBrasil and the FAO Digitized Soil Map
of the World and Derived Soil Properties, the latter included
to account for areas lying outside of Brazil. Land use classifi-
cation was retrieved from the Global Land Cover map, which
was generated using Envisat MERIS fine-resolution (300 m)
satellite imagery over the year 2009. Regional land use maps
of some Brazilian states were further included in the HRU
merged product to improve level of detail.

3.2 Validation datasets

3.2.1 Discharge and water level data

Daily records of discharge were collected from several na-
tional hydrological services including Agência Nacional
de Águas (ANA/Brazil: http://www.snirh.gov.br/hidroweb/,
last access: 24 April 2018), Operador Nacional do Serviço
Elétrico (ONS/Brazil, Reservoir naturalized flows: http://ons.

edge, we masked out gauges heavily influenced by up-

stream reservoirs and only included gauges with more than
10 000 km2 of drainage area. In a few cases, however, this
threshold was lowered to include, at least, a small number
of gauges due to the lack of available data. Short time series
with less than 5 years of records were also excluded from
analysis. The complete list of discharge gauge stations can
be found in the Supplement Table S.4.1.

Satellite altimetry data were obtained from the
THEIA/Hydroweb website (http://hydroweb.theia-land.fr/,
last access: 24 April 2018). Within this database, time series
of water surface elevation (WSE) were extracted manually
using the methodology presented in Santos da Silva et
al. (2010) and are provided at virtual stations (VSs) where
the satellite ground track forms a crossover with the river
network (? 10–40 cm of water level accuracy). A total
of 841 VSs were found over the Amazon basin, 10 over
the Orinoco basin and 29 over the La Plata basin. Data
are derived from the observations of Envisat and Jason-2
for the period of 2002–2010 (35-day repeat orbit) and
2008–2010 (10-day repeat orbit), respectively. In situ stage
data from ANA gauge stations were also obtained for the
Brazilian territory and were filtered using the same criteria
as discharge data.

3.2.2 Terrestrial water storage (TWS)

Launched in 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Exper-
iment (GRACE) measures temporal changes in the Earth’s
gravity field (Tapley et al., 2004). Several studies have shown
the ability of GRACE to detect continental water storage
variations at large spatial scales (e.g., Wahr et al., 1998;
Ramillien et al., 2004; Tapley et al., 2004), which can pro-
vide insights into hydrological modeling about potential de-
ficiencies in process description, parameters and input data
(Schmidt et al., 2008). Here, we used the Release 05 JPL
RL05M v2 mass concentration (mascon) estimates available
on the GRACE Tellus website (https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov, last
access: 24 April 2018). The JPL RL05M mascon solution
solves for monthly gravity anomalies in terms of 3?×3?

equal-area spherical cap mascons, while using a Coastline
Resolution Improvement (CRI) filter to discriminate between
land and ocean mass portions of each mascon that spans
coastlines (Wiese et al., 2016). Regarding the traditional
spherical harmonic (SH) approach, which has been widely
used in the last decade for global studies (Wahr et al., 1998;
Landerer and Swenson, 2012), mascon solutions can also
be applied to regional scales (Scanlon et al., 2016) and do
not require the user to apply any postprocessing filters to
the data, lowering the dependence on using scale factors to
recover signal loss (Watkins et al., 2015). Uncertainties in
GRACE mascon solutions (3?×3?) over South America are
around 10–15 mm of equivalent water thickness, and have
been found to be similar or slightly lower in relation to SH
solutions (Scanlon et al., 2016).

Despite the native resolution (3?×3?), mascon grids are
provided with a spatial sampling of 0.5?×0.5?. We kept the
original resolution, computing a simple average of 0.5? grid
pixels located inside 3?×3? mascon locations, as signals at
sub-mascon resolution cannot be considered independent of
each other. Time series of simulated TWS were first derived
by summing water stored in all hydrological compartments,
including rivers, floodplains, soil, groundwater and vegeta-
tion canopy, in each time step. Similar to Paiva et al. (2013),
the modeled TWS was then resampled as the weighted mean
of TWS of all unit catchments within each 3?×3? equal-
area mascon cell, using the former drainage area as weight.
To ensure agreement with GRACE data, anomalies of simu-
lated TWS were obtained by subtracting the long-term mean
computed for the period between 2004 and 2009.

3.2.3 Evapotranspiration (ET)

Reference values of ET were extracted from the Cli-
mate Data Record (CDR) (Zhang et al., 2018), which
is available at http://stream.princeton.edu:8080/opendap/
MEaSUREs/WC_MULTISOURCES_WB_050/ (last access:
24 April 2018). Within this dataset, 10 gridded global ET
products estimated from satellite (five), reanalysis (two) and
LSMs (three) were optimally combined at 0.5? resolution us-
ing weighted averaging and a Bayesian merging technique.
The weight of each product is related to the inverse of the
ensemble spread, and the deviation from the ensemble mean
is assumed as a proxy of the uncertainty/error in individ-
ual products. Together with other optimally merged vari-
ables provided by the CDR dataset (precipitation, runoff and
TWS), estimates of ET were further adjusted with a Con-
strained Kalman Filter to ensure terrestrial water budget clo-
sure at each 0.5? grid cell (Zhang et al., 2018). For com-
parison purposes, the modeled ET was spatially aggregated
into cells of 0.5? resolution using the unit catchment drainage
area as weight.

3.3 Model adjustment

Model calibration is commonly performed to improve agree-
ment between observations and model results. However,
the traditional gauge-by-gauge calibration used in regional
hydrological modeling is not very common in continental
to global domains (Archfield et al., 2015; Bierkens, 2015,
Samaniego et al., 2017; Mizukami et al. 2017) because it
can lead to spatial discontinuities of parameters (i.e., patch-
work patterns) and overfitting to account for limitations in
data and model structure. In other words, good results of dis-
charge may not reflect a suitable depiction of the underlying
hydrological processes, so modelers are more likely to “get
the right answers for the wrong reasons” (Kirchner, 2006)

In an attempt to reduce the only dependency of
river gauges during calibration, regions of parameter sets
were derived by intersecting the global map of lithol-

ogy/geology of Durr et al. (2005) with large South American
basins/hydrological regions, the latter shown in Fig. 1a. The
Amazon and La Plata basins were further divided into their
main tributaries prior to intersection due to their large spatial
extent. As parameter sets do not correspond to a single gauge
station, but rather to regions defined by geological character-
istics, multiple gauges were calibrated at the same time using
the same parameter set. It is worth mentioning that calibra-
tion still remains a challenge for hydrological modeling with
respect to large-scale domains (Mizukami et al., 2017), and
assessing the suitability of emerging parameter regionaliza-
tion techniques (e.g., Samaniego et al., 2017) may be inves-
tigated in the future because it is beyond the scope of this
paper.

The set of parameters used for model calibration is listed
in Table 1, including their respective typical ranges of val-
ues. Other parameters used to compute energy balance and
evapotranspiration (e.g., LAI, superficial resistance, albedo
and canopy height) were defined a priori for each HRU veg-
etation type according to Collischonn (2001, and references
within). Automatic calibration was not used herein to keep
coherent values according to soil type and land cover, thus
aiding to reduce model overparameterization. Therefore, sen-
sitivity analysis of rainfall-runoff parameters was continu-
ously performed as part of the manual calibration process.
Regarding the hydrodynamic module, downstream bound-
ary condition at oceans and lakes (endorheic basins) was set
to a constant water level for simplification. Manning coef-
ficient values were globally set to 0.03, with adjustments
in specific rivers of the Amazon basin according to Paiva
et al. (2013). Infiltration from floodplains to the soil col-
umn was considered and only calibrated for the Pantanal
region (Kinf=10 mm day?1) since previous studies showed
that vertical hydrological processes largely influence model
results in this area (e.g., Paz et al., 2014). It is worth mention-
ing that model sensitivity to river geometry and infiltration
parameters were previously assessed by Paiva et al. (2013)
and Fleischmann et al. (2018), respectively.

As a result of the calibration procedure, several model
parameter sets were manually adjusted and can be sum-
marized into the following median values and percentile
ranges (p5–p95): Wm=500 (50–1500) mm; b=0.2 (0.02–
1.5); Kbas=0.2 (0.01–3.0) mm day?1, Kint=2 (0.1–50)
mm day?1, XL=0.67 (0.1–0.67), Cs=15 (5–35), Ci=120
(20–200) and Cb=1200 (800–6000) h.

3.4 River discharge from GHMs and LSMs

Discharge outputs from state-of-the-art global models were
acquired through the eartH2Observe Water Cycle Integra-
tor (WCI; ftp://wci.earth2observe.eu, last access: 24 April
2018). The WCI hosts multidecadal global water resources
reanalysis datasets produced by 10 GHMs and LSMs, provid-
ing multi-scale (regional, continental and global) estimates of
meteorological and hydrological water balance variables. We

selected outputs from the 0.25? resolution Water Resources
Reanalysis run 2 (WRR-2) baseline, which is an improved
dataset over the WRR-1 (0.5?) produced by the initial project
run (Schellekens et al., 2017). Models in the WRR-2 base-
line are forced with MSWEP precipitation (1979–2014) and
bias-corrected ERA-Interim data using the WFDEI correc-
tion methodology (see Dutra et al., 2017). Among the global
models in WRR-2, river discharge at 0.25? resolution was
only available for one LSM, the HTESSEL offline coupled to
CaMa-Flood (Balsamo et al., 2009; Yamazaki et al., 2011),
and two GHMs, namely, LISFLOOD (van der Knijf et al.,
2010) and WaterGAP3 (Döll et al., 2009). The latter two
have some degree of calibration and performed relatively
well in terms of runoff in a recent model intercomparison
(Beck et al., 2017a), while the former is uncalibrated but uses
a state-of-the-art hydrodynamic routing model. Within the
eartH2Observe project, LISFLOOD and WaterGAP3 were
run at, respectively, 0.1? and 0.08333? resolutions, and dis-
charge was then resampled to 0.25? for WRR-2 (Dutra et al.,
2017). A brief overview of the structure of these models is
shown in Table S2.1.

Because these models are grid-based, we followed a simi-
lar procedure to that in Zhao et al. (2017) to match grid cells
to corresponding river gauge stations. First, we applied an
automatic routine to find the cell coordinates nearest to the
gauge locations. Cells were selected when the difference in
the upstream area was within 5 %; otherwise, the surrounding
cell with minimum upstream area difference was selected.
Gauges associated with cells whose drainage area differed
more than 15 % were excluded from the analysis. This proce-
dure was performed separately for each global model to deal
with differences between their respective drainage networks.
Moreover, due to the spatial resolution mismatch of LIS-
FLOOD and WaterGAP3, flow accumulation grids were re-
computed using their respective flow direction maps (at 0.1?

and 0.08333?) and were resampled to the same resolution of
discharge grids (0.25?). The corresponding cells were then
extensively validated with a thorough, GIS-assisted visual
inspection, supported by long-term mean annual discharge
grids (derived from each global model) to minimize errors of
gauge mislocation.

3.5 Metrics for assessment of results

MGB simulation was carried out between 1 January 1990
and 31 December 2009 using a daily time step and a warmup
period of 2 years to eliminate the influence of initial con-
ditions. Model results were assessed in terms of discharge,
water levels, ET and TWS, while simulated river discharge
was further compared with the output of global models. Ta-
ble 2 lists all efficiency metrics used for the assessment of
model results. Statistics such as the Kling–Gupta efficiency
and delay index were the same as used in Kling et al. (2012)
and Paiva et al. (2013), respectively.

4 Results and discussion

4.1 Model validation

4.1.1 River discharge

Simulated daily discharge was compared with in situ obser-
vations and results were presented in maps of performance
metrics (r, KGE and NSE) at each gauge station (Fig. 2).
In addition, the runoff coefficient (RC=Qmean/Pmean) was
calculated for each gauge station and was plotted against
its respective KGE and drainage area (Fig. 3). There is a
good agreement between simulated and observed flows in
several regions of South America, as NSE and KGE values
are larger than 0.6 in 55 % and 70 % of the cases, respec-
tively. Model performance is clearly higher in the southern
and southeastern regions of Brazil, including central Ama-

zon. On the other hand, performance decreases in regions
marked by semiarid to arid climates, such as in Northeast
Brazil, west and southwest of the La Plata basin, most parts
of Argentina and northern Chile. For instance, a poor corre-
lation (r &amp;lt;0.2) is observed in a semiarid region covered by
the Colorado basin, where snowmelt/glacier melt contribute
a large amount to total runoff and corresponds to the main
source of water for human activities (Rivera et al., 2017).
Other locations with lower performance (NSE &amp;lt;0.2) usually
refer to regions strongly influenced by orography (around
Andes Cordillera), which are expected due to larger uncer-
tainties of satellite-derived precipitation in these areas (Tian
and Peters-Lidard, 2010; Paiva et al., 2013). River discharge
at gauge stations with the RC ranging between 0.3 and 0.6 is
generally well represented in all spatial scales, while perfor-
mance tends to be lower for RC &amp;lt;0.3 and highly variable for
rivers with lower drainage areas.

Figure 3. MGB model performance (KGE) versus RC and drainage
area over South America.

Figure 4 shows daily simulated discharge for some of
the large South American rivers. The agreement between
simulated and observed discharge is notable for both high
and low flows in most of the cases, which indicates the
model’s ability to simulate regional- to continental-scale
rivers (105 km2 to 4.7×106 km2) with different flow regimes.
Results in the Amazon basin (e.g., Obidos, NSEHD =0.89)
are comparable to other regional studies (e.g., Getirana et
al., 2012; Paiva et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2017), while bet-
ter performance is found over several of its tributaries (e.g.,
Purus, Madeira and Japura rivers). Figure 4 also highlights
the improvements of MGB using a hydrodynamic (HD)
model over a non-hydrodynamic (noHD) routing method.
In the Paraguay River, peak flows are dramatically reduced
at the Amolar gauge station when using the HD rout-
ing (up to ?75 %), and a similar behavior can be seen at
Puerto Bermejo (NSEnoHD =?5.8 to NSEHD =0.42), lo-
cated about 1600 km downstream near the confluence with
the Paraná River. Previous attempts of regional hydrologi-
cal modeling in this basin that did not account for the flood-
plain inundation in the Pantanal (e.g., using the calibrated
VIC model; see Su and Lettenmaier, 2009) reported nega-
tive NSE values for Puerto Bermejo, even at the monthly
timescale. Differences in performance between noHD and
HD are also quite remarkable (especially in terms of NSE)
at gauge stations of Conceicao do Araguaia and Calamar in
the lower Magdalena, where a pronounced attenuation effect
is observed. On the other hand, in some rivers, such as the
Uruguay at Garruchos (NSEnoHD = 0.85; NSEHD =0.82),
Paraná at Itaipu (NSEnoHD =0.91; NSEHD =0.87) and To-
cantins at Descarreto (NSEnoHD =0.72; NSEHD =0.70), the
routing method has a minor impact. In the case of Orinoco at
Ciudad Bolivar, both hydrographs look similar, but the NSE
suggests that results are improved when HD routing is used
(NSEnoHD =0.83; NSEHD =0.9).

ering both hydrodynamic (HD; red color) and non-hydrodynamic (noHD; gray color) routing methods.

4.1.2 Water levels

Results of performance metrics regarding water levels are
presented in Fig. 5. For a suitable comparison, observed data
and modeled WSE were first converted into anomalies (i.e.,
by subtracting their respective long-term mean: hnew =h?h)
to keep values with the same reference. In addition, Fig. 6
shows time series of simulated water level anomalies (here-
after referred to as water levels) for some of the large rivers

of South America, which were plotted against in situ water
levels and satellite altimetry. In general, the results obtained
for the assessed gauges and VSs are considered satisfactory
in terms of correlation (r ? 0.8 in 80 % of cases) and Nash–
Sutcliffe (NSE?0.6 in 60 % of cases), with a reasonable per-
formance for amplitudes (?30 % &amp;lt;?BIAS &amp;lt;30 % in 50 % of
the cases). Like prior studies in the same region (e.g., Ge-
tirana et al., 2012, 2017b; Paiva et al., 2013), water levels
are well represented in central Amazon, where a good per-

formance is observed at tributaries and along the main river
down to its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean. Amplitudes are
overestimated (?BIAS &gt; 30 %) in southeast tributaries such
as Madeira, Xingu and Tapajos, as well as in headwaters lo-
cated in the northwest part of the basin. Outside the Ama-
zon, there are acceptable results in the Orinoco (e.g., lower
Meta), Uruguay and Tocantins–Araguaia basins, where the
model generally performs well in all assessed metrics. Large
overestimations in the standard deviation (?BIAS &gt;+50 %)
are systematically found over the São Francisco main stem,
which are reflected by very low values of NSE (&amp;lt;0.2). On the
Paraguay River, a reasonable agreement between observed
and simulated water levels is observed at Amolar, but perfor-
mance significantly reduces in both correlation and ?BIAS
for downstream regions (e.g., at Porto Murtinho). In the lat-
ter case, model results are clearly advanced in time and do
not capture rapid variations of water level originating from
lateral contributions of tributaries.

Performance in water levels is directly related to the agree-
ment between simulated and observed discharge. On the
other hand, even if discharge is well represented, there are
uncertainties related to Manning values and also to river
widths and depths derived from HGs, which do not reflect
singularities of cross sections such as narrowing or widen-
ing of rivers at both gauge and VS locations. Previous stud-
ies have demonstrated the large influence of channel geom-
etry and roughness on both amplitude and timing of water
levels, especially over the Amazon basin (e.g., Yamazaki
et al., 2011; Paiva et al., 2013; Paris et al., 2016; Luo et
al., 2017). Moreover, riverbed profiles are subject to DEM
errors that can hardly be reduced through simple profile-
smoothing procedures. For example, datasets used to remove
the vegetation bias in Bare-Earth SRTM (IceSAT, vegeta-
tion height maps, uncorrected SRTM) have different spatial
resolutions that lead to artifacts around the edges of vegeta-
tion patches (O’Loughlin et al., 2016), producing additional
noise on riverbed elevations. In addition to vegetation, other
SRTM error sources such as stripe noise (Rodriguez et al.,
2006) significantly affect large flat areas on the La Plata basin
(Yamazaki et al., 2017), which can ultimately impact model
results. Model resolution and the ability to route discharge
in downstream multi-directions (e.g., rivers with bifurcations
and anabranching networks) can affect simulated water lev-
els and flooded areas (e.g., Mateo et al., 2017), which has
been taken into account in recent studies with MGB (e.g.,
Pontes et al., 2017; Fleischmann et al., 2018) but not in this
continental model application. Other simplifications in the
model may also affect results, like the assumptions of rect-
angular cross-sections and zero velocity of water stored on
floodplains.

4.1.3 Evapotranspiration (ET)

Figure 7 shows the magnitude and seasonality of ET aver-
aged for major basins in South America, as well as the mag-

nitude of errors (RMSE) comparing modeled values to the
optimal estimate of the CDR dataset. The ratio of the RMSE
to the CDR uncertainty (RMSEunc) was calculated to outline
regions where simulated ET tends to deviate from the optimal
CDR value; i.e., values above unity indicate that the model
error is larger than the mean deviation of all datasets (used in
CDR) from their ensemble mean.

Results show that MGB can capture patterns of ET
over the South America region. Simulated ET values are
within the CDR uncertainty range in most of the conti-
nent (RMSEunc &amp;lt;1), with errors varying between 10 and
30 mm month?1. A good agreement in terms of magni-
tude and seasonality of ET is observed for the Amazon,
Tocantins–Araguaia and mainly for La Plata basin, but the
model also performs reasonably well in São Francisco. Con-
versely, larger deviations (RMSEunc &gt; 1) are found at low
latitudes (20? S–10? N), where RMSE values reach up to
50 mm month?1. ET is underestimated during the dry season
in basins such as Orinoco (DJF), Amazon and Tocantins–
Araguaia (JJA), while it is largely overestimated from the
onset to the end of the dry (wet) season in São Francisco
and Parnaíba (Orinoco). The latter two are clearly affected
by a temporal lag in ET seasonality, where simulated values
are delayed by approximately 1 month with respect to CDR
estimations. At midlatitudes (&gt; 20? S), large RMSE values
(above 50 mm month?1 and RMSEunc &gt; 2) are only observed
in a narrow N–S range over the southern Andes.

Regarding issues about the timing and magnitude of sim-
ulated ET, meteorological forcing probably has an influence
on model performance because long-term mean climate data
are used for ET computations. Another possible reason is the
lack of spatial variability of moisture in the MGB soil col-
umn. Guswa et al. (2002) compared a simple bucket (one
layer) to a physically based Richards model, showing that
large discrepancies can occur with respect to the relation-
ship between ET and average root-zone saturation, as well as
in timing and intensity of transpiration, especially for water-
limited conditions. Moreover, Wang et al. (2006) found that
timescales of evapotranspiration can differ significantly be-
tween a single-layer and multi-layer soil scheme due to non-
linear interactions that occur in the latter. Indeed, ET is ex-
pected to respond quickly at the beginning of the rainy sea-
son due to an increase of water availability at the soil sur-
face layer, which cannot be well represented with a single-
layer, bucket-type model like MGB. In contrast to some of
the datasets used in CDR (e.g., reanalysis and LSMs), the
MGB does not account for snow processes, which may ex-
plain the large RMSE values over the southern Andean re-
gion.

Although it is beyond the scope of this study for a full as-
sessment of ET estimations derived from hydrological mod-
els and other sources, it is important to note that errors pre-
sented here correspond to the difference between both esti-
mates (MGB and CDR). ET is one of the most uncertain wa-
ter balance variables due to its high spatial and temporal vari-

ability; thus it is difficult to validate given the lack of ground
observations (Miralles et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2018). Even
accounting for ? 70 % of the weight in CDR dataset in com-
parison to LSM and reanalysis (Zhang et al., 2018), remote
sensing products of ET are based on Penman–Monteith or
Priestley–Taylor equations that depend on vegetation indices
and meteorological forcing derived from satellite/reanalysis
data, which are associated with many uncertainties (Mi-
ralles et al., 2011; Vinukollu et al., 2011). Christoffersen
et al. (2014) and Maeda et al. (2017) showed that most re-
mote sensing and land surface models are unable to consis-
tently reproduce ET seasonal cycles in tropical areas (across
the Amazon basin) when compared with eddy covariance
measurements and ET estimates from water balance. In the
Amazon, for example, ET seasonality is regulated by radi-
ation, rainfall and how vegetation assimilates water and en-
ergy (Restrepo-Coupe et al., 2013; Maeda et al., 2017). Other
limitations are also associated with the vegetation cover frac-

tion and how ET is partitioned between transpiration, soil and
canopy evaporation (Miralles et al., 2011).

4.1.4 Terrestrial water storage (TWS)

Figure 8 shows the performance of simulated TWS anoma-
lies in comparison to observations from GRACE mascon so-
lutions. To evaluate the ability of MGB to reproduce monthly
variations of TWS, both simulated and observed time series
of TWS were averaged to the scale of large basins in South
America and are presented in Fig. 9.

In general, the results show that MGB has the ability to
represent TWS anomalies over the continent. There is a good
temporal correlation in most parts of tropical South America
(r &gt; 0.75), as well as in temperate regions with dry summer
between latitudes of 30 and 40? S. Amplitudes of TWS are
reasonably well simulated (?20 % &amp;lt;?BIAS &amp;lt;20 %), mainly
in central Brazil, parts of the northeast, south of La Plata and
areas of southern Chile. On the other hand, performance typ-

ically decreases in semiarid to arid climates, as can be seen
in regions such as northern Chile, Colorado basin, west of La
Plata and southern Argentina. High negative bias with large
RMSE (&gt; 150 mm) is observed in the northeast Amazon and
west of the Orinoco, whereas large overestimations are found
mainly over coastlines at low latitudes in the Southern Hemi-
sphere (0–20? S). Moreover, in some regions characterized
by polar climate, at the extreme south or in areas over the An-
des, modeled TWS anomalies are markedly underestimated
(?BIAS&amp;lt;?80 %).

Modeled TWS is in good agreement with GRACE ob-
servations over the Amazon, Tocantins–Araguaia, São Fran-
cisco and Parnaíba basins (r &gt; 0.9, |?BIAS|&amp;lt;15 % and
RMSE &amp;lt;45 mm), capturing both the interannual variabil-
ity and amplitude of TWS anomalies for the analyzed pe-
riod. MGB is also successful in representing annual changes
of TWS in the La Plata basin, but with an overestimation
(?BIAS=22 %) probably caused by high positive ?BIAS
in the Paraguay and Chaco regions. Errors in the La Plata
basin (RMSE=24 mm) are in the same order as those in the
Amazon (RMSE=26 mm). In addition, larger amplitude dif-
ferences clearly occur in the Orinoco (?BIAS=?32 %), but
with a pronounced RMSE (&gt; 60 mm) that mainly originates
from the eastern part of the basin.

The good agreement found in the Amazon basin can be
attributed to the explicit representation of the surface water
reservoir (channels + floodplains), which has been demon-
strated to play an important role in both the magnitude and
timing of TWS (Alkama et al., 2010; Paiva et al., 2013; Geti-
rana et al., 2017a). Other authors have pointed out that the
contribution of surface storage to TWS is also potentially
high in the Orinoco (? 45 %) (e.g., Frappart et al., 2014),
suggesting a large underestimation of the soil storage (in the
eastern part of the basin) because anomalies of water level
were reasonably well simulated. Indeed, surface storage has

been understood as a major component of TWS variability
over tropical regions of South America, and may also be rel-
evant for large rivers crossing semiarid areas such as the São
Francisco (Getirana et al., 2017a). In the case of La Plata,
the TWS amplitude is likely to be amplified if surface water
is anticipated in time (Getirana et al., 2017a), which probably
occurs due to the low correlation of water levels previously
simulated for the Paraguay River. In addition, the absence
of a well-defined river system due to very flat terrains (e.g.,
Chaco region, in the west part of La Plata) potentially favors
the dominance of the groundwater dynamics over TWS, as
already reported by Kuppel et al. (2015) in the western Pam-
pas more in the south.

It is worth mentioning that, for regions of South Amer-
ica located in midlatitudes, TWS is dominated by interan-
nual variability rather than the seasonal cycle (Humphrey et
al., 2016), where TWS amplitudes are generally lower and
errors more apparent. Previous studies showed a strong nega-
tive trend in GRACE mascon solutions in the Colorado basin
(e.g., Scanlon et al., 2016) that can be associated with a de-
crease in snow water equivalent over the dry Central Andes
(Rivera et al., 2017). Moreover, negative variations in glacier
mass have been reported in southern Argentina/Chile over
the Patagonia Icefields (Chen et al., 2007), which is proba-
bly the main factor responsible for the large RMSE observed
in the extreme south of the continent. TWS in nearby semi-
arid areas is potentially affected by snowmelt/glacier melt
because the latter is an important water source of Patagonian
rivers flowing to the Atlantic Ocean (Pasquini and Depetris,
2007; Rivera et al., 2018). Inconsistencies along coastlines
are also expected because of the smaller size of land mas-
cons that increase uncertainty in GRACE estimates (Wiese et
al., 2016). Finally, in addition to issues related to model pa-
rameterization and depiction of hydrological processes (e.g.,
snowmelt), artificial reservoirs (dams) and lakes are not in-

tion.

4.2 Cross-scale comparison of river discharge from
continental × global models

This section presents an assessment of MGB-simulated dis-
charge in comparison to the outputs from HTESSEL/CaMa-
Flood, LISFLOOD and WaterGAP3 models, extracted
from WRR-2 in the context of the eartH2Observe project
(Schellekens et al., 2017; Dutra et al., 2017). This offers an
interesting opportunity to evaluate to what extent discharge
estimates can be improved at the continental scale of South
America, as well as to identify the major shortcomings that
should be addressed. To provide a concise spatial analysis,
discharge from global models was reduced to its ensemble
mean (Ensemble GM), and results are presented in terms
of the difference of each metric (indicated by “d_metric”),
i.e., by subtracting the performance of MGB from the per-
formance of the Ensemble GM (Fig. 10). Bias and DI values
are given in terms of absolute differences (d_Abs(metric))
to make both under- and overestimations comparable. There-
fore, positive values indicate that MGB outperforms the en-
semble mean of global models and vice versa. Detailed per-
formance metrics of each model can be found in the figures
in Sect. S3.

The continental model presents improvements for all met-
rics over most of the South America regions when com-
pared with the global ensemble mean. In relative terms,
a better agreement of simulated and observed discharge
(d_KGE &gt; 0.8) is observed over semiarid regions (e.g., east-
ern/northeastern Brazil and most parts of Argentina), which

are strongly impacted by bias in the Ensemble GM (d_Abs
(BIAS) &gt; 60 %). In tropical regions with marked seasonal-
ity and dry winter (e.g., upper Paraná headwaters), differ-
ences in bias are lower (?10 % &amp;lt;d_Abs (BIAS) &amp;lt;20 %),
which indicates that KGE performance mainly depends on
the variability of flows that is not captured by the Ensemble
GM. Correlation is considerably higher over the Paraguay
River (d_r &gt; 0.4), highlighting the strong influence of hy-
drodynamic effects and complex processes in the Pantanal
and Chaco regions, as documented by regional studies (e.g.,
Paz et al., 2011, 2014; Bravo et al., 2012; Pontes, 2016).
There is also a clear correlation improvement in rivers such
as the Araguaia, Amazonas and lower Magdalena, which
are also affected by river–floodplain interactions with conse-
quent flood peak attenuation (e.g., Paiva et al., 2013; Lininger
and Latrubesse, 2016; Angarita et al., 2018; Pontes et al.,
2017). A similar performance is observed for timing (d_Abs
(DI)) with absolute differences being larger than 20 days,
which also occur in the main stem of the Orinoco basin. In
terms of NSE, the largest differences in performance previ-
ously observed for the KGE now extend to the main Ama-
zon River, to its tributaries in the eastern region (i.e., Tapa-
jos and Xingu) and also to both Magdalena and Tocantins–
Araguaia basins, with values of d_NSE?0.8. With respect to
low to medium flows (d_ NSElog), there is a similar pattern
to d_KGE (except for eastern Brazil), although with more
pronounced differences in the Amazon and Magdalena re-
gions.

The Ensemble GM performs relatively well in all statistics
over temperate regions with the absence of lowland rivers
(e.g., southern Brazil and southern Chile) and outlines spe-
cific locations where the continental approach may be some-
what limited. For example, correlation is slightly reduced for

the continental model (?0.1 &amp;lt;d_r&amp;lt;?0.2) in areas over the
Parnaíba basin and Chile, while a marked decrease in tim-
ing performance (d_Abs (DI)&amp;lt;?20 days) is observed in dry
Argentinian rivers like Salado (southwest of La Plata basin)
and Desaguadero (Colorado basin). Poor estimates of river
geometry and large overestimation of flows in these regions
may be causing excessive flooded areas and consequent peak
attenuation. Regarding intermediate to low flows, consider-
able differences in model performance are mainly observed
over specific rivers in eastern Brazil and parts of the Amazon

basin near the Andes Cordillera (d_NSElog&amp;lt;?0.8), as well
as in regions over southern Chile (?0.2 &amp;lt;d_NSElog&amp;lt;?0.6)
that are potentially affected by snowmelt.

Table 3 shows differences in median discharge statistics
for each global model and also for the Ensemble GM in
comparison to the MGB continental model. Because LIS-
FLOOD and WaterGAP3 account for reservoir impacts in
their model structure, gauge stations with naturalized dis-
charge data (n=98) were excluded from the analysis to pro-
vide a fair assessment. Except for the Ensemble GM, dif-

ferences in performance regarding each pair of models (i.e.,
difference between continental and global) are quite sim-
ilar for KGE (? 0.45) and NSElog (? 0.5), while being
highly variable for both NSE (? 1 to ? 1.8) and bias (? 4 %
to ? 30 %). Differences in median DI are between 1 and
2 days, which can be important for cases where flood tim-
ing is around this order of magnitude. Among the estimates
from global models only, the Ensemble GM outperforms four
out of the six metrics analyzed (KGE, NSE, NSElog and
DI) with correlation (d_r=0.03) equivalent to the best of
global models for this metric (LISFLOOD, d_r=0.02). A re-
duction in performance only occurs when bias is evaluated,
where 50 % of the gauge stations have an absolute difference
equal to or greater than 11 % compared with differences in
HTESSEL/CaMa-Flood (d_Abs (BIAS) ? 8 %) and Water-
GAP3 (d_Abs (BIAS) ? 4 %). In the assessment by Beck

et al. (2017a) for basins &amp;lt;10 000 km2 around the world, LIS-
FLOOD also had an advantage in correlation when compared
with other global models, while WaterGAP3 demonstrated
problems related to baseflow index, which may be indicated
here by the largest difference of NSElog (d_NSElog ? 0.6).

The set of box plots shown in Fig. 11 summarizes the
individual performance of continental and global models.
Results are presented for some of the representative South
America basins and for the entire continental region, using

ters, i.e., the reference simulation (MGB_HD_calib), hydro-

ibrated rainfall-runoff parameters (MGB_noHD_calib) and
non-hydrodynamic routing with uncalibrated rainfall-runoff
parameters (MGB_noHD_noCalib). For the uncalibrated
MGB versions (noCalib), a single set of parameters was
adopted corresponding to the median values resulting from
model adjustment (as shown in Sect. 3.3). It is important
to note that only rainfall-runoff parameters were reduced to
their median values, while river routing parameters (Manning
coefficient and river geometries) remained unchanged.

Results indicate that global models have important limi-
tations in representing daily discharge in South America. In
absolute terms, more than 40 % (60 %) of the gauge stations
show KGE (NSE) values that are negative or close to zero
. These models tend to overestimate discharge in the conti-
nent, with median bias ranging between +10 % and +50 %.
In general, the performance among global models is vari-
able according to the analyzed region and metric, which is
supported by the large box plot ranges. None of the models
has a clear advantage with respect to all statistics, and this
is especially valid for NSE and KGE. In the Amazon, KGE
values present a more uniform pattern than in other regions
with a median value close to 0.5, while models agree in a
reasonable number of positive KGE and NSE values. Per-
formance in the La Plata basin is highly variable between
models, and this is the only region in which both system-
atic underestimation (HTESSEL/CaMa-Flood with median
BIAS??20 %) and overestimation (LISFLOOD with me-
dian BIAS ?+20 %) is observed. Moreover, performance
of the global models in basins with semiarid regions (e.g.,
São Francisco and Parnaíba) is extremely poor for KGE and
NSE (median&amp;lt;?1 and&amp;lt;?2 respectively), which is prob-
ably associated with a dramatic overestimation of flows in
these regions. WaterGAP3 shows a lower bias for all basins,
but simulated peak flows occur too early according to DI for
South America (percentile 25 % of DI ??10 days). On the
other hand, LISFLOOD appears to have a systematic delay
in flow timing with more pronounced values over the Ama-
zon (median DI?+10 days), and a strong wet bias. For in-
stance, median values of bias in LISFLOOD are larger than
40 % for the entire continent and exceed 100 % in basins such
as São Francisco and Parnaíba. Absolute DI values are gen-
erally lower for HTESSEL/CaMa-Flood (median DI closer
to 0) and this model usually shows an intermediate perfor-

mance with respect to other metrics in comparison to LIS-
FLOOD and WaterGAP3. Furthermore, the Ensemble GM
shows a better overall performance when compared with
each of these models alone, but still produces a similar num-
ber of negative KGE and NSE values (33 % and 60 % of the
gauges, respectively).

Simulated discharge after setting MGB with a single set
of rainfall-runoff parameters (MGB_noHD_noCalib) results
in positive values for both KGE and NSE median val-
ues, varying between 0.3 and 0.6 for the entire continent.
The uncalibrated version of the continental model outper-
forms global models in South America except for basins
with semiarid regions (e.g., São Francisco and Parnaíba),
where performances seem to be very dependent on param-
eter adjustment. The introduction of hydrodynamic routing
(MGB_HD_noCalib) causes a slight improvement in NSE
and KGE but this effect is more evident in the Amazon and
especially over the La Plata basin (percentile 25 % of NSE
changes from ?1.5 to 0). Improvements in flow timing (DI)
for both Amazon and La Plata are also observed after in-
cluding the HD routing method, although excessive delays
occur in São Francisco and Parnaíba because of the large
bias that leads to an excess of floodplain attenuation (see
MGB_HD_noCalib×MGB_ HD_Calib). Furthermore, box
plot ranges are considerably smaller for KGE, NSE and bias
in the default MGB simulation (MGB_HD_Calib) with re-
spect to global models, and this reduction can be mostly seen
in both MGB calibrated versions.

Our results agree with other studies from the literature,
highlighting the large influence of model structure and pa-
rameterization in addition to meteorological forcing (e.g.,
Haddeland et al., 2011; Gudmundsson et al., 2012; Zhou et
al., 2012; Beck et al., 2017a). Regarding global models, other
studies also stress the large number of negative NSE values
resulting from LSMs and GHMs in many basins around the
world (e.g., Zhang et al., 2016; Beck et al., 2017a), includ-
ing South America (e.g., Wu et al., 2014). In particular, Wa-
terGAP3 is expected to produce a lower bias because it is
calibrated in terms of mean annual flow (Döll et al., 2009;
Müller Schmied et al., 2014), and the systematic advance
in timing is probably caused by the simple variable veloc-
ity equation (based on Manning) used for computing flow
routing. In the case of LISFLOOD, large overestimation of

flows in comparison to other global models has already been
reported in the context of the eartH2Observe project (Beck et
al., 2017a), where it showed the lowest estimate of potential
evaporation (Schellekens et al., 2017). Indeed, this excessive
wet bias is one of the possible reasons for the observed delay
in flows, but this is not the only factor because large overesti-
mations are concomitantly found in regions where DI is neg-
ative. This is the case for eastern Amazon tributaries located
downstream of Obidos, such as the Tapajos and Xingu (see
figures in Sect. S3). The interplay between the Manning co-
efficient and groundwater parameters and their influence on
flow timing of LISFLOOD has been shown in recent studies
(e.g., Revilla-Romero et al., 2015; Zajac et al., 2017), and
here may compensate for limitations of the double kinematic
wave (channel+floodplain) used for river routing, especially
in the Amazon. This suggests that calibrating large basins
with lowland river systems using few downstream stations
(such as Obidos) should be taken with care if hydrodynamic
routing is not accounted for in the model structure.

Although some authors pointed to a clear (and general)
underestimation of HTESSEL (e.g., Haddeland et al., 2011;
Beck et al., 2017a), our results showed that it only occurs in
the La Plata Basin and not in other regions, which may be re-
lated to the precipitation forcing used in WRR-2 (MSWEP).
With respect to model performances, the relatively better
flow timing of HTESSEL can be attributed to CaMa-Flood
routing, but the advantages of this coupling were below the
expected ones when looking at other statistics. It is worth
mentioning that default parameters for river routing were
used within WRR-2 simulations; i.e., the CaMa-Flood model
was not calibrated (Dutra et al., 2017). This could be one
of the reasons that low values of NSE are found over the
Amazon main stem for this model (see figures in Sect. S3).
Characteristics such as timing and magnitude of flood waves
in the hydrodynamic routing are very sensitive to channel
geometry and roughness (Yamazaki et al., 2011; Paiva et
al., 2013), but also to DEM vegetation effects (Baugh et
al., 2013) that can impact the subgrid floodplain profiles
(Paiva et al., 2011; Yamazaki et al., 2011). Furthermore,
Zhao et al. (2017) emphasize that the benefit of CaMa-
Flood highly depends on the runoff fields simulated by the
coupled LSM. Our results showed that discharge estimates
of an uncalibrated model are improved over Amazon and
(mainly) La Plata basins after inclusion of hydrodynamic
routing (MGB_HD_noCalib), provided that channel geome-
try and floodplain topography are reasonably well estimated.
Apart from the particular issues of WaterGAP3, LISFLOOD
and HTESSEL/CaMa-Flood over South America, our find-
ings reinforce the conclusion of other authors who recom-
mend the ensemble mean of global models as the most reli-
able estimate (e.g., Haddeland et al., 2011; Gudmundsson et
al., 2012; Schellekens et al., 2017; Hattermann et al., 2018),
and it occurs even when discharge of a small number of mod-
els is averaged (three in the present case).

As outlined by many studies (e.g., Haddeland et al., 2011;
Gudmundsson et al., 2012; Pechlivanidis and Arheimer,
2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Krysanova et al., 2017), perfor-
mance of both regional and global models generally reduces
when there is a transition from wet to dry conditions. In semi-
arid regions, satellites have several limitations in capturing
rainfall intensities due to the local, convective nature of the
precipitation, and they often overestimate the occurrence of
rainfall because raindrops are likely to evaporate (i.e., sub-
cloud evaporation) before reaching the surface (Dinku et al.,
2010; Sunilkumar et al., 2015; Beck et al., 2017c). In ad-
dition, runoff generation mechanisms are strongly nonlinear
and depend too much on storage processes, which are param-
eterized with large uncertainty (Gudmundsson et al., 2012).
For instance, there is little knowledge about the influence of
transmission losses, their partitioning between its main com-
ponents (e.g., infiltration/evaporation from channels or flood-
plains) (Jarihani et al., 2015) and the dominant mechanisms
of losing/gaining water according to different periods of the
wet season (Costa et al., 2013). Processes such as reinfil-
tration of surface runoff, lateral redistribution of subsurface
runoff and hydraulic-connected stream–aquifer interactions
have been shown to be necessary for hydrological modeling
in Northeast Brazil (Güntner and Bronstert, 2004; Costa et
al., 2012, 2013), but are not explicitly accounted for in any
structure of the assessed models. Therefore, a systematic un-
derestimation of continental ET and consequent overestima-
tion of flows is expected in dry regions (e.g., Alkama et al.,
2010; Haddeland et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2016). Uncertain-
ties about human interferences in water resources (i.e., small
ponds and reservoirs, water abstractions) may also play an
important role (Hanasaki et al., 2018), especially in regions
where data are scarce. Nevertheless, the complexity of the
global models assessed herein makes it difficult to explain
the real factors that impact discharge estimates.

Model resolution can partially explain performances in
headwater catchments or in areas with complex orography.
In addition to issues related to the quality of satellite prod-
ucts (Tian and Peters-Lidard, 2010), aspects that potentially
affect these regions are the shape (grid or unit catchment)
and size of computational elements, as well as the downscal-
ing method of rainfall fields to force the hydrological models
(Rahman et al., 2009), which is in our case a simple inverse
distance weighting interpolation. It is worth noting that we
have used a drainage area threshold of 1000 km2 for head-
water catchments (i.e., the onset of drainage networks), while
this same area for global models varies between ? 100 and
? 625 km2 according to their respective grid resolutions (be-
tween 0.08333? and 0.25?). In addition, results of discharge
were evaluated at gauges monitoring at least 10 000 km2,
meaning that at these points the continental model has at least
? 20 unit catchments forced by ? 16 MSWEP pixels. On the
other hand, response to precipitation at these smaller basins
may occur at an hourly scale, while model forcing and anal-
yses were performed at a daily scale.

5 Summary and conclusions

For the first time, a regional-scale, fully coupled hydrologic–
hydrodynamic model (MGB) was applied to a continen-
tal domain (South America). Model results were assessed
using observed discharge and water levels from both in
situ/satellite altimetry in an unprecedented gauge network
over the continent, together with estimates of TWS and ET
from remote sensing and other data sources. In addition,
a cross-scale assessment (i.e., regional/continental×global
models, the latter acquired from the eartH2Observe project)
was conducted with the novelty of using spatially distributed,
daily discharge data for model comparison.

Regarding continental modeling, analyses showed a sat-
isfactory agreement between simulated and observed dis-
charge, with NSE (KGE) &gt; 0.6 in more than 55 % (70 %) of
the gauges. The performance was generally better in large
rivers and humid regions, but worse in areas with semiarid
to arid climates, influence of snowmelt or draining complex
orography such as the Andes Cordillera. Similar results were
found for water levels (both in situ and satellite altimetry),
despite 50 % of the gauges showing large under- and over-
estimation of amplitudes (&gt; |30 %|). The model was able to
capture patterns of seasonality and magnitude of ET and
TWS in many parts of the continent, especially when results
were averaged to the scale of large South American basins
(e.g., Amazon, La Plata, Orinoco, Tocantins–Araguaia, São
Francisco, Parnaíba). In addition, model errors in simulat-
ing discharge were also found in other hydrological vari-
ables, which demonstrates the importance of assessing model
results using multiple data sources. Uncertainties were at-
tributed to deficiencies in process representation and simpli-
fications in parameterization, as well as to limitations of the
datasets used as model input and validation.

The cross-scale comparison shed light on the extent to
which it is possible to improve discharge estimates in
South America. Global models (HTESSEL/CaMa-Flood,
LISFLOOD and WaterGAP3) presented negative NSE val-
ues in a large number of gauges (&gt; 60 %) and showed highly
variable performances when evaluated over multiple gauges
within large basins. A considerable improvement in perfor-
mance was found when the continental model was compared
with individual global models, reaching median differences
of around 0.45 for both KGE and NSElog, being larger than
unity for NSE. By using the ensemble mean of global mod-
els as their best estimate, large differences in absolute bias
(&gt; 60 %) were detected mainly in eastern/northeastern Brazil
and regions over Argentina, as well as in São Francisco, Par-
naíba and Magdalena basins. Differences in timing of more
than 20 days were found in rivers with floodplain effects,
such as the Amazon, La Plata, Tocantins–Araguaia, Orinoco
and lower Magdalena. Nevertheless, global models demon-
strated a good ability to predict daily discharge over temper-
ate, humid regions with the absence of lowland rivers (e.g.,

southern Brazil and southern Chile), while performing rea-
sonably in the Amazon basin.

The analyses also showed that model calibration and hy-
drodynamic routing cannot be neglected if simulation of
daily discharge in this continent is desired. Calibration was
found to be a key factor to model performance in most re-
gions but mainly in drier basins (e.g., Parnaíba and São Fran-
cisco), where models generally fail to represent the under-
lying hydrological processes. In addition, a hydrodynamic
routing module was essential to achieve a suitable represen-
tation of both magnitude and timing in major river systems,
especially in cases where flows are dramatically attenuated
by floodplains (e.g., the Paraguay River). However, the ex-
pected benefit of coupling hydrodynamic and hydrological
models occurs when river geometries are reasonably well
represented and calibration of rainfall-runoff parameters is
performed together. This must be conducted by looking at
different flow signatures (low and high flows, bias, timing of
hydrographs) in a spatially distributed way, i.e., not consider-
ing only a single downstream gauge of large basins to reduce
potential issues related to parameter compensation. As many
of the approaches used in this study are applicable to global
models, our findings suggest that large improvements on es-
timated discharge can be achieved by the latter even without
a significant increase in the number of computational ele-
ments.

Regardless of the scale (global or continental), limitations
still remain in some regions of South America and can be
explored as “stress tests” in model evaluation studies. For in-
stance, characteristics of the La Plata basin such as complex
floodplains, extensive rivers with mild slopes, significant
reservoir regulation and existence of several climatic zones
make it a unique test bed for model assessments. In addition,
large basins with semiarid conditions located in Northeast
Brazil (e.g., Parnaíba) or also with snowmelt-driven regimes
in the south of the continent (e.g., Colorado) are interesting
examples of stress model performance. Despite the cross-
scale assessments conducted herein only encompassing river
discharge, we recommend that other studies should also in-
clude in situ water levels and observation-inferred variables
(e.g., TWS from GRACE, ET from remote sensing/global
datasets and satellite altimetry) when possible. To facilitate
access to in situ data, we call for cooperation among South
American countries to produce a continental dataset that can
be used by a broader audience, thus contributing to reduce
the gap between regional and global modeling communities.

Finally, this study shows that extending a regional, fully
coupled hydrologic-hydrodynamic model to the whole South
American continent is feasible. This underscores the impor-
tance of regional expert knowledge, which can indicate rel-
evant hydrological processes and datasets to be included in
continental/global model simulations. We hope that moving
from regional toward continental hydrologic–hydrodynamic
modeling will bring new opportunities for operational prac-
tices such as real-time hydrological forecasting, which is the

topic of ongoing research. Nevertheless, several improve-
ments should be carried out in the model structure, not only
to achieve a better understanding of the underlying processes,
but also to provide further insights about human impacts on
South American water resources. This includes the represen-
tation of reservoirs, lakes and water abstractions. It is also
important to address uncertainties in model parameters, and
these should be investigated further.
