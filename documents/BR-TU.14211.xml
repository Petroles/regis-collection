Abstract  

Rapid global population growth has increased the demand for food and energy supply. The 

limited oil reserves, pollution concerns, global warming and political instability and disagreements, 

lead to an increased financial support for sustainable and environmental sources of energy, biofuels. 

In the last decades there is an increasing interest in the development of the bioethanol production 

from lignocellulosic residues, which do not compete directly with food. However, the low efficient 

conversion of cellulosic biomass to biofuels hinders its success. Alternative substrates are inulin 

containing plants, as Jerusalem artichoke, representing a renewable and inexpensive raw material 

for industry and biofuel production. In this work, the main goal was to search for new 

microorganisms, with high potential to produce bioethanol, due to the presence of better 

ethanologenic characteristics or ability to produce relevant hydrolytic enzymatic machinery. From the 

isolation and screening of 98 novel strains, 7 were selected and further characterized. A preliminary 

identification was performed using FISH. Three isolates which showed inulinase capacity gave a 

putative identification as Z. bailii strains, and the best (Talf1) was optimized and characterized for 

inulinase production. Talf1 enzymatic extract presented maximum activity (8.7 U/ml) at 45 ºC and pH 

5.5, and high stability at 30ºC. Talf1 isolate was used in a Consolidated Bioprocessing (CBP) and its 

enzymatic extract in a Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) process, for 

bioethanol production, obtaining an ethanol yield of 45% and 47% from pure inulin; and a yield of 

51% and 48% from Jerusalem artichoke juice, respectively. Four selected isolates from strawberry 

tree fruit (STF) were used in a fermentation assay using STF juice, producing 86 - 100 g/l of ethanol 

from this raw material, at a very high yield (47-50%). These results show the enormous potential of 

inulin and Jerusalem artichoke as substrates for bioethanol production and the application of these 

novel yeasts as ethanol and/or inulinase producers.

Resumo 

A exploração de novos recursos energéticos foi crucial para a revolução tecnológica que 

ocorreu no início do século 19. Já nesse século se conhecia o enorme potencial do álcool como 

fonte de energia, visto que o primeiro protótipo de motor de ignição foi desenhado para funcionar 

com este combustível. No início do século 20, a produção de etanol foi substituída pela gasolina, 

devido ao baixo custo de extração. Os combustíveis fósseis têm sido, desde então, a principal fonte 

de energia utilizada. O rápido aumento da população tem intensificado a necessidade do aumento 

de produção alimentar e energética. 

 
As limitadas reservas de petróleo, preocupações ambientais, o aquecimento global e a 

instabilidade política renovaram o interesse e, consequentemente, o apoio financeiro direcionada 

para o desenvolvimento de fontes renováveis de energia, como os biocombustíveis. Vários tipos de 

biocombustíveis têm sido estudados, mas apenas dois são produzidos à escala industrial: o 

biodiesel e o bioetanol. O bioetanol apresenta as melhores qualidades para a sua utilização nos 

atuais motores, podendo ser utilizado como aditivo na gasolina, sendo por isso, o biocombustível 

mais utilizado a nível mundial (Antoni et al., 2007). 

 
A produção mundial de bioetanol à escala industrial utiliza principalmente duas fontes naturais: 

Saccharum officinarum (cana-de-açúcar) e Zea mays L. (milho). A cana-de-açúcar é sobretudo 

utilizada no Brasil, sendo o segundo maior produtor mundial de bioetanol, enquanto o milho é a 

principal fonte natural utilizada nos E.U.A., o maior produtor mundial. Estes dois países representam 

88% da produção global (REN21). 

 
Na produção de bioetanol ocorre a fermentação alcoólica dos substratos naturais, diretamente a 

partir da cana-de-açúcar (que contém principalmente sacarose); para a bioconversão do milho 

(composto principalmente por amido) há necessidade de um passo prévio de hidrólise enzimática 

para a sua conversão em açúcares simples. O bioetanol obtido a partir de culturas agrícolas 

produzidas exclusivamente para esse fim, ocupando assim área cultivável, denomina-se Bioetanol 

de 1ª Geração (1G). Este tipo de produção levanta questões morais e éticas porque, deste modo, o 

bioetanol compete diretamente com a produção alimentar (Luo et al., 2009).  

 
Para ultrapassar este problema, tem sido proposto a utilização de resíduos lenhocelulósicos, 

como substratos, para produção de Bioetanol de 2ª Geração (2G). Este bioetanol não compete 

diretamente com a produção alimentar, apesar de consumir recursos agroindustriais. Atualmente a 

conversão de biomassa lenhocelulósica em bioetanol é ainda um procedimento caro e de baixa 

eficiência, sendo economicamente desfavorável a sua aplicação (Gibbons and Hughes, 2009). O 

principal obstáculo é o custo do pré-tratamento para conversão dos vários polímeros (celulose, 

hemicelulose, xilano, etc.) em açucares simples (glucose e xilose principalmente) que esta 

biomassa necessita, quer seja por degradação enzimática (com custos associados de produção de 

extratos enzimáticos); quer seja a aplicação de métodos químicos, como hidrólise ácida (que para 

além do seu custo, leva à produção de composto inibidores do crescimento microbiano). 



V 

 
 Existem vários bioprocessos propostos para a produção em larga escala de 2G nomeadamente 

a hidrólise separada da fermentação (SHF), em que o passo de hidrólise da biomassa 

lenhocelulósica antecede a fase de produção de bioetanol; a fermentação e sacarificação 

simultâneas (SSF), neste caso há a adição exógena de enzimas ou a co-fermentação de biomassa 

com um microrganismo produtor das enzimas necessárias à conversão dos polímeros nos seus 

monómeros, disponibilizando assim os açúcares simples para o microrganismo etanologénico os 

converter em etanol; e o bioprocesso consolidado (CBP), em que a produção de enzimas para a 

hidrólise enzimática e a produção de etanol ocorrem por ação do mesmo microrganismo 

(considerado o melhor processo conceptual) (Lynd, 1996). 

 
Infelizmente não está descrito nenhum microrganismo que, simultaneamente, seja capaz de 

produzir a maquinaria enzimática necessária para a hidrólise da biomassa lenhocelulósica e que a 

produção de etanol atinja valores de rendimento e produtividade economicamente viáveis. 

 
Dadas as dificuldades de implementação à escala industrial do 2G e movidos por preocupações 

ambientais, de utilização de solos cultiváveis e o desequilíbrio atual no ciclo de carbono, levou 

alguns cientistas a desenvolver o Bioetanol de 3ª Geração (3G). Este bioetanol recorre a microalgas 

com elevado conteúdo nutritivo para a sua produção. Ao invés de aproveitar resíduos 

agroindustriais como substrato, as algas são produzidas explorando os recursos hídricos para a 

produção de biomassa. Desta forma, não há competição com produção alimentar nem área 

cultivável e não há utilização de recursos agroindustriais. No entanto, o baixo rendimento de 

produção de biomassa torna este processo, ainda, economicamente inviável à escala industrial 

(Goh and Lee, 2010). 

 
Uma alternativa a estas opções é a utilização de plantas produtoras de inulina, como Helianthus 

tuberosus (tupinambo), que representam um recurso renovável, barato e abundante para a 

produção de bioetanol. O tupinambo tem várias características importantes que justificam a sua 

utilização, nomeadamente a tolerância a frio, à seca, ao vento e a terrenos arenosos e/ou salinos, 

com uma alta taxa de fertilidade e de resistência a pestes e doenças, não necessitando 

obrigatoriamente de terrenos férteis para se desenvolver. Estas características tornam-no numa 

fonte apetecível de biomassa para conversão em bioetanol que não compete pelos terrenos 

cultiváveis utilizados para produção alimentar (Neagu and Bahrim, 2011; Chi et al., 2011; Bajpai and 

Margaritis, 1982). 

 
Este trabalho teve como objetivo a procura de novos microrganismos, especialmente leveduras, 

a partir de isolamentos de diferentes fontes naturais, nomeadamente dos frutos de alfarrobeira 

(Ceratonia síliqua), ameixeira (Prunus domestica), cerejeira (Prunus avium), figueira (Ficus carica), 

medronheiro (Arbutus unedo) e pessegueiro  (Prunus persica) e tubérculos de tupinambo 

(Helianthus tuberosus). Os microrganismos foram selecionados com base nas suas características 

etanologénicas (maior tolerância a elevadas concentrações de etanol, pH e temperatura e, por isso, 



VI 

capazes de fermentações alcoólicas mais longas); e/ou na capacidade de produção de enzimas 

relevantes, como inulinases, para posterior aplicação em bioprocessos industriais.  

 
A partir de 98 isolados, dos quais 90 eram leveduras e 8 bactérias, foram selecionados 7 

isolados diferentes. Destes, 3 isolados foram selecionados porque apresentaram capacidade de 

converter inulina purificada em etanol; os outros 4 isolados foram selecionados porque foram 

capazes de produzir etanol mais rapidamente, utilizando sumo de medronho como meio completo. 

 
Às 7 estirpes foi aplicado um procedimento de identificação preliminar, utilizando sondas 

marcadas com um fluoróforo, para hibridação de fluorescência in situ (FISH), especificas para várias 

espécies de leveduras vínicas, nomeadamente: Hanseniaspora uvarum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, 

Lachancea thermotolerans, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Torulaspora 

delbrueckii e Zygosaccharomyces bailii. 

 
As 7 estirpes apresentaram um resultado positivo para apenas uma destas sondas, distribuindo-

se por três espécies diferentes: Lachancea thermotolerans (AP1), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (DP2 

e GluP4) e Zygosaccharomyces bailii (GerP3, Calf2, Talf1 e Talf2). Foi realizado um controlo 

positivo em cada experiencia de FISH para cada sonda testada, utilizaram-se estirpes identificadas 

e existentes no laboratório, nomeadamente: CBS 314 (Hanseniaspora uvarum), Kluyveromyces 

marxianus 516F, CBS 2803 (Lachancea thermotolerans), NRRL Y-987 (Metschnikowia pulcherrima), 

Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCMI 885, PYCC 4478 (Torulaspora delbrueckii) e Zygosaccharomyces 

bailii 518F.  

 
Foi também utilizada uma sonda universal para células eucariotas (EUK516) em todas as 

células utilizadas, como controlo positivo, de forma a assegurar a presença de RNA acessível nas 

células após o procedimento de fixação, essencial na técnica de FISH. Esta identificação preliminar 

deverá ser validada com técnicas moleculares mais precisas, complementadas com estudos 

completos de morfologia e fisiologia. 

 
Das estirpes preliminarmente identificadas como Z. bailii, três (Calf2, Talf1 e Talf2) 

apresentaram capacidade de produção de inulinases, uma caraterística não referenciada em 

estirpes desta espécie (Kurtzman et al., 2011). Foi traçado um perfil metabólico das estirpes, Calf2, 

Talf1 e Talf2, em confronto com a estirpe Z. bailii 518F utilizando duas galerias API distintas: API 

ZYM and the API 20C AUX. Conclui-se que as três estirpes têm perfiz metabólicos semelhantes 

entre si e com Z. bailii 518F, revelando características fisiológicas importantes para aplicação futura. 

 
A produção de inulinases é uma característica essencial para a fermentação de inulina em 

etanol, permitindo a utilização de matérias-primas ricas em inulina como substrato para produção de 

bioetanol. Com esta finalidade, foi avaliada a produção de inulinases extracelulares das 3 estirpes, 

utilizando dois substratos indutores: a inulina (extraída de chicória) e o sumo de tupinambo. A 

estirpe Talf1 apresentou maior atividade enzimática extracelular quando induzida com sumo de 

tupinambo (8,7 U/ml) do que a estirpe Calf2 e Talf2, que atingiram 4,1 e 7,8 U/ml respetivamente. 



VII 

Utilizando inulina purificada como substrato indutor, todas as estirpes atingiram aproximadamente 

0,6 U/ml de atividade enzimática no extrato celular, o que demonstra a fraca capacidade de indução 

por parte da inulina purificada. 

 
De forma a otimizar a produção de inulinases, utilizando a estirpe Talf1, foram testados outros 

substratos como indutores de inulinases: duas inulinas comerciais, extraídas de fontes naturais 

diferentes; e três matérias-primas: raízes de acelga, tubérculos de dália e o resíduo sólido de 

tupinambo, obtido após extração do sumo. Conclui-se que as inulinas comerciais purificadas são 

fracos indutores, não atingindo valores superiores a 0,6 U/ml, enquanto todas as matérias-primas 

naturais induziram positivamente a produção de inulinases, obtendo 1,9 U/ml com raízes de acelga, 

1,5 U/ml com tubérculos de dália e 5,9 com o resíduo sólido de tupinambo. Concluiu-se que o 

tupinambo, em particular o sumo, é o melhor substrato indutor, para a produção de inulinases 

extracelulares utilizando a estirpe Talf1. 

 
Foi feita a caracterização bioquímica do extrato enzimático desta estirpe, revelando que a 

temperatura e o pH ótimos de atividade são 45 ºC e 5,5 respetivamente. Foi determinada a 

estabilidade à temperatura e ao pH; o extrato enzimático manteve 57% da sua atividade inicial ao 

fim de 24 dias, quando mantido a 30 ºC e ao pH natural (5,5). No entanto alterações de pH 

diminuem drasticamente a estabilidade do extrato (a 30 ºC). As características do extrato enzimático 

da estirpe Talf1 são promissoras para a sua posterior utilização em bioprocessos que utilizem 

inulina ou fontes ricas em inulina como substrato desde que ocorram a pH ácido (aproximadamente 

5,5) e à temperatura de 30 ºC. 

 
Dadas as características descritas, a estirpe Talf1 foi utilizada num bioprocesso consolidado 

(CBP) e o respetivo extrato enzimático utilizado num processo de fermentação e sacarificação 

simultâneas (SSF) para produção de bioetanol. Para o processo SSF foi utilizada a estirpe 

etanologénica S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 e o meio foi suplementado com o extrato enzimático 

produzido por Talf1.  

 
Na utilização de inulina como única fonte de carbono, o processo SSF apresentou maior 

rendimento e produtividade máximos de etanol (47% e 2,75 g.l
-1

.h
-1

) e obteve-se maior 

concentração de etanol no meio (78 g/l), enquanto no processo CBP produziram-se 67 g/l de etanol, 

com um rendimento e produtividade máximos de 45% e 1,70 g.l
-1

.h
-1 

respetivamente. 

 
 Foi realizado, em paralelo, um crescimento controlo com S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 e inulina 

como única fonte de carbono. Nestas condições, foram produzidas apenas 50 g/l de etanol, o que 

demonstra que a adição do extrato enzimático levou à hidrólise de polímeros de inulina que não são 

utilizados naturalmente por S. cerevisiae, apesar desta estirpe conseguir produzir enzimas que 

degradam parcialmente polímeros de inulina. 

 
A produção de bioetanol a partir diretamente de sumo de tupinambo foi testada pelos dois 

bioprocessos (SSF e CBP). Neste caso obtiveram-se melhores resultados utilizando a levedura 



VIII 

Talf1 no bioprocesso consolidado. A estirpe Talf1 atingiu melhor produtividade (3,62 g.l
-1

.h
-1

,), 

rendimento (51%) e concentração máximas de etanol (67 g/l), do que a estirpe S. cerevisiae CCMI 

885 em sumo de tupinambo (SSF), suplementado com o extrato enzimático contendo inulinases, 

que produziu 62 g/l de etanol, com um rendimento e produtividade máximos de 48% e 2,40 g.l
-1

.h
-1

, 

respetivamente. 

 
No ensaio controlo, utilizando a levedura S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 sem adição de qualquer 

enzima, obtiveram-se menores resultados de rendimento e produtividade máxima (42% e 2,07 g.l
-

1
.h

-1
) e apenas 55 g/l de etanol produzido, um valor inferior aos resultados obtidos com os anteriores 

bioprocessos. Estes resultados são consistentes com os obtidos apenas com inulina como fonte de 

carbono, reforçando a hipótese de que esta estirpe, S. cerevisiae CCMI 885, seja capaz de 

hidrolisar algumas cadeias de inulina, mas não utilizar todos os açúcares presentes no sumo de 

tupinambo. 

 
Estes resultados mostram o potencial da inulina e fontes naturais ricas em inulina, como o 

tupinambo, para fontes alternativas na produção de bioetanol. No entanto para a aplicação industrial 

das estirpes descritas neste trabalho, será necessária posterior otimização de todo o processo. 

 
As 4 leveduras selecionadas a partir do rastreio inicial de fermentação de sumo de medronho (L. 

thermotolerans AP1, S. cerevisiae DP2, S. cerevisiae GluP4 e Z. bailii GerP3), foram utilizadas num 

ensaio de fermentação de sumo de medronho, em comparação com S. cerevisiae CCMI 885. O 

melhor resultado foi obtido com a estirpe S. cerevisiae CCMI 885, atingindo-se 108 g/l de etanol, 

com um rendimento máximo de 51%, igual ao teórico possível, e uma produtividade máxima de 1,29 

g.l
-1

.h
-1

. 

 
No entanto, a estirpe de Z. bailii GerP3, com valores máximos de etanol, produtividade e 

rendimento máximos de 100 g/l, 1,11 g.l
-1

.h
-1

 e 50%, respetivamente, são próximos daqueles obtidos 

com a levedura S. cerevisiae. A estirpe Z. bailii GerP3 obteve, por isso, os resultados mais 

promissores para a aplicação num sistema de fermentação em estado sólido diretamente a partir de 

medronho. 

 
O desenvolvimento de um processo eficiente e economicamente viável para produção de 

bioetanol é crucial para a sociedade atual, servindo como alternativa à utilização de combustíveis 

fósseis, para uma população mundial que requer cada vez mais energia.  

A utilização de fontes naturais como o tupinambo e o medronho, para a produção de bioetanol, 

pode ajudar a reduzir a dependência energética dos combustíveis fósseis. No entanto, para produzir 

industrialmente bioetanol a partir destas fontes naturais renováveis, e ainda necessária a otimização 

do processo a escala industrial.

1. Introduction 

1.1. Biofuels 

Throughout history, mankind has relied on renewable energy sources like wood, windmills, water 

wheels and animals for sustainability. The development of new energy resources was crucial for the 

technological revolution occurred in the 19
th
 century. Early in that century, alcohols were repeatedly 

reported as biofuels, alongside combustion, they were transformed into solvents, greases, cleaners or 

simple chemicals for the emerging chemical industry, ending with fossil fuel breakthrough. The first 

prototype for a spark ignition engine, by Nikolaus August Otto in the 1860s, was designed for ethanol and 

sponsored by the sugar factory of Eugen Langen. Later, in 1902, one third of Eugen Langen new 

company (Deutz Gas Engine Works) heavy locomotives ran on pure ethanol (Antoni et al., 2007). During 

the beginning of the 20
th
 century, ethanol was recognized as an anti-knocking additive for internal 

combustion engines and was added to gasoline between 1925 and 1945. Even Henry Ford, a well known 

automotive inventor, believed the “fuel of the future” was ethyl alcohol made from farm products and 

cellulosic materials (Kovarik, 1998). He was involved in the chemurgy movement, which proposed the use 

of farm products for chemicals and energy production (Finlay, 2004). In the 1940s, ethanol production for 

fuel purposes was overthrown by gasoline’s low price in USA. Fossil fuel has been, since then, the major 

energy source used.  

In the past few decades, the rapid global population growth has increased the demand for higher food 

and energy production (Goldemberg, 2007; Nass et al., 2007; Ragauskas et al., 2006). The world’s fossil 

fuel reservoir and its extraction will not keep pace with the society’s need for petrochemical fuels. Several 

factors led to a renewed interest for biofuels, namely, the limited oil reserves, pollution concerns, global 

warming and political instability and disagreements, leading to an increased financial support for more 

sustainable and environmental friendly sources of energy (Antoni et al., 2007; Ragauskas et al., 2006).  

Biofuel refers to fuel source generated from agricultural products, as crops or other organic material, 

obtained from other industries residues, such as crop residues, perennial grasses or alternative crops 

with higher productivity in impoverished soils. In Table 1 are compiled most recent biofuels and research 

status for its application. The biodiesel and bioethanol research areas are the only reproduced in 

industrial scale. Counting with ETBE (Ethyl Tert-Butyl Ether), which is primarily made by bioethanol, these 

3 fuels compose 90% of all biofuel market. The main component for biodiesel is a monoalkyl ester of fatty 

acids from vegetable oil and is presently produced by catalytic transesterification with petro-chemically 

derived methanol (Ma and Hanna, 1999). Although biodiesel is not microbially produced, several research 

groups have focus on the utilization of microalgae, grown in photobioreactors, which reduces the specific 

demand of land area needed for oil derived from plants (Chisti, 2007); another potential approach 

followed for biodiesel bacterial production is microdiesel (Kalscheuer et al., 2006) where bacterial strains 

are selected and/or improved to increase fatty acids content of cells, which yields higher production rates 

for the  biodiesel extraction directly from cells, and there by allow the use of  different carbon sources or 

raw materials to serve as growth medium.

Although additional types of biofuels are being investigated, such as methane, hydrogen, n-Butanol, 

acetone and others, bioethanol fermentation is by far the largest scale microbial process, with a strong 

history of productivity in several countries (Antoni et al., 2007). The fermented beverages produced 

through yeast’s activities have contributed significantly to the worldwide advancement and sustainability 

of human societies (Legras et al., 2007). Bioethanol does not need to be rectified to high purity, being 

directly used in Brazil as AEHC (Álcool Etílico Hidratado Combustível) (Antoni et al., 2007). Given the 

appropriate chemical characteristics of bioethanol as a liquid fuel for current engines, it is the most used 

biofuel worldwide. 

1.2. Bioethanol 

Ethanol can be produced synthetically from petrochemical materials (crude oil, gas or coal) or 

biologically by fermentation of sugars (bioethanol). In 1995, only 7% of world ethanol was produced by 

the synthetic method, the remaining 93% was produced by microbial fermentation (Kádár, 2005). 

Bioethanol as a biofuel regained importance in the 1970s, caused by a gasoline depletion which made 

the costs increase tremendously. Brazil was the first country to approve governmental support to 

implement bioethanol as current biofuel in that decade (Goldemberg, 2007). Today, the USA and EU 

have defined political objectives for increasing the use of bioethanol as alternative to fossil fuel, namely: 

in the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) and the European Commission White Paper, 

respectively. In 2010, the USA was responsible for 57% of global bioethanol production and Brazil 

contributed with almost 31%. The third producer worldwide was China, representing 2.3%. The global 

production of fuel ethanol reached 86 billion liters, an increase of 17% over 2009 (REN21). In Table 2 are 

described the main feedstocks used for bioethanol production. Bioethanol is mainly produced from two 

types of feedstocks: sugar and starch rich biomass. Sugar can be used for direct fermentation of ethanol. 

Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) are the major sugar-producing plants. 

Sugarcane is adapted to warm temperate to tropical areas, used in Brazil, whereas sugar beet is grown in 

temperate areas, mainly in Europe. Therefore the two sugar crops occupy different geographical niches 

(Yuan et al., 2008a). In the USA, corn (Zea mays L.) is the starch source for bioethanol production. For 

the alcoholic fermentation process, a saccharification step (conversion of polymers, like starch, into 

simple sugars) is required prior to its industrial batch.

The bioethanol produced exclusively from crops that use farmland is named 1
st
 Generation 

Bioethanol (1G). The use of edible crops and farmland has raised morality and ethics issues, since fuel is 

directly competing with food resources. In order to overcome this issue, bioethanol produced from 

lignocellulosic biomass (e.g. trees, forestry and crop residue, grasses, and municipal solid waste), named 

2
nd

 Generation Bioethanol (2G), offers a great option which is compatible with economic growth and 

morality issues (Luo et al., 2009). The lignocellulosic biomass represents an enormous carbon source for 

bioconversion, with an estimated annual production of 1 366 million tons from forest biomass and 

agricultural residue just in the USA (Gibbons and Hughes, 2009). The monomers retrieved after specific 

treatment (acid or enzymatic hydrolysis) from the lignocellulosic biomass are pentoses (C5), as xylose 

and arabinose (sugars from hemicelluloses, xylan and lignin fibers), and hexoses (C6), as glucose (sugar 

from cellulose fibers). In order to use this biomass for bioethanol, the fermentation requires four main 

steps: enzyme production, biomass enzymatic hydrolysis, hexose and pentose fermentations (Lynd, 

1996). The main objective is the utilization of all sugar content, both C6 and C5 sugars alike. The C6 

sugars are used for ethanol production at high yield, however the C5 fermentation requires specific 

microorganisms which have by-product formation or slow xylose conversion limiting the economical 

application for ethanol production (Kötter and Ciriacy, 1993). The four processes for conversion of 

lignocellulosic biomass into ethanol are compared in Figure 1. The methodologies are displayed from the 

less (Separate Hydrolysis Fermentation - SHF) to the most integrated bioprocess (Consolidated 

BioProcessing - CBP). The enzyme cost and production is still the bottleneck for the industrial application 

of these approaches.  

Through SHF process, the four necessary fermentation steps occur separately. It is the simplest 

process. The C5 and C6 sugars fermentation may occur in sequence (Figure 1A) or be allocated in 

parallel (Figure 1B).

Figure 1. Levels of consolidation in enzyme production, enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation to bioethanol (adapted from 

Hamelinck et al., 2005). 

For the Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF), the ethanol production co-occurs with 

the enzymatic hydrolysis, diminishing the procedure to three different fermentation batches. This avoids 

the problem of product inhibition associated with enzymes, given that the monomers enzymatically 

produced are consumed by the ethanologenic microorganism (usually S. cerevisiae). The Simultaneous 

Saccharification and Co Fermentation (SSCF) process refers to the joining of C6 and C5 fermentation 

step with simultaneous hydrolysis, which reduces to two fermentation batches.  

The most integrated system is the Consolidated BioProcessing (CBP) which occurs in a single batch 

at the same time. It is the best conceptual design, although no organism or compatible combination of 

microorganisms is available that produces the desired enzymatic machinery and also produce ethanol at 

the necessary high concentration and yield (Lynd, 1996).  

According to the following reactions, the ethanol theoretical maximum yield is 0.51 kg ethanol and 

0.49 kg carbon dioxide per kg of sugar (Hamelinck et al., 2005): 

 

3 C5H10O5 -&gt; 5C2H6O + 5CO2  (1) 

C6H12O6 -&gt; 2C2H6O + 2CO2  (2) 

 



5 

Currently, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the main producer of 1G trough C6 fermentation (2), due to 

high ethanol concentration production from glucose and sucrose, and also due to high ethanol tolerance 

(Hirasawa et al., 2007; Abe et al., 2009). However, the pentose’s fermentation (1) requires the utilization 

of C5 fermenting microorganisms, as Zymomonas mobilis, or recombinant S. cerevisiae strains 

(Hamelinck et al., 2005). 

Unfortunately, several technical drawbacks still hinder industrial application of 2G, by comparison with 

1G: the feedstock typically contains little protein or other nutrients (besides carbohydrates) that microbes 

will need; hence, nutrient supplementation may be required; improvements are needed to reduce 

biomass harvest and transportation costs; the lignocellulosic residue pretreatment are costly and often 

sufficiently intensive to generate inhibitory compounds that inhibit microbial growth; current 

deconstructing enzymes are more expensive and less effective than corresponding enzymes used with 

starch; the fermentation of both C5 and C6 reduces ethanol conversion efficiency; the currently used 

ethanologenic microbes lack tolerance to inhibitors generated during lignocellulose pretreatment, cannot 

ferment mixed sugars and cannot operate at the 50-60°C optimal temperature of the saccharification 

enzymes; finally, the engineered microbes that ferment mixed sugars may require regulatory approval 

and possess sufficient robustness to industrial conditions, high sugar and ethanol concentrations, and 

other variables (Gibbons and Hughes, 2009). 

Given all these obstacles for implementing an industrial scale 2G production, and concerns about soil 

usage, environment impact and carbon cycle, a 3
rd

 Generation Bioethanol (3G) was created. The 3G is 

based on an equilibrated carbon network that does not compete with agriculture (Goh and Lee, 2010). 

This 3G technology is based on algae or cyanobacteria that contain a high oil mass fraction grown in 

ponds. Microorganisms can convert almost all of the energy in biomass residuals and subsequently in 

bioethanol (Singh et al., 2011). The process of algal cultivation could be improved for higher yield 

efficiency of algal lipids through the screening and improvement of algal strains. Wastewater and flue 

gases are the best options for reducing the environmental burden from the cultivation of algal biomass. 

Further research and development are necessary to establish an economical industrial scale production 

of algal biofuels (Singh et al., 2011) due to low yield and biomass concentration, when compared with 

other bioethanol productions. 

The availability of inexpensive sources of fermentable sugar is limited in most areas of the world, and 

the efficient conversion of cellulosic biomass or other inexpensive substrate sources to usable fuels will 

be required to increase the bioethanol production. The 3G requires further advances and an industrial 

scale application. The primary limitation in cellulosic biomass fermentation is the yeasts inability to directly 

convert cellulose, hemicelluloses and associated components into ethanol (Hahn-Hägerdal et al., 2006). 

An alternative to these options are inulin containing plants, representing a renewable, inexpensive and 

abundant raw material for industry and bioethanol production (Neagu and Bahrim, 2011; Chi et al., 2011; 

Bajpai and Margaritis, 1982). 

1.2.1. Inulin and inulin rich materials 

Fructans are one of the most abundant non-structural polysaccharides found in a wide range of 

plants. Inulin is a polydisperse fructan polymer composed by linear chains of ?-2, 1-linked D-

fructofuranose molecules terminated by a glucose residue through a sucrose-type linkage at the reducing 



6 

end (De Leenheer, 1996). Thus, inulin is a mixture of oligomers and polymers. The degree of 

polymerization (DP) in inulin varies according to plant species, weather conditions and age (Li and Chan-

Halbrendt, 2009), ranging from 2 to 60 fructose monomers, or higher (Sirisansaneeyakul et al., 2007; Yu 

et al., 2011). The molecular structure of inulin compounds is shown in Figure 2. 

 

 

Figure 2. Molecular structure of inulin (from Vandamme and Derycke, 1983). 

As a result, inulin is of great interest as it is a relatively inexpensive and abundant substrate for the 

production of fructose syrups and bioethanol (Bonciu et al., 2010). It is present as a reserve carbohydrate 

in the roots and tubers of several plants, such as Jerusalem artichoke (topinambur), chicory, dahlia and 

yacon (see Table 3).  The inulin content depends on the plant species, being chicory, Jerusalem 

artichoke and dahlia the major sources of inulin for industrial scale with world production currently 

estimated to be about 350 000 tons (Kango and Jain, 2011). 

Nowadays, inulin has gain interest for high fructose syrup, a low calorie sweetener, or inulo-

oligosaccharides (IOS) synthesis, a functional food (Roberfroid, 2005), for the neutraceutical industry and 

for bioethanol production from renewable carbon sources. Briefly, inulin polymers have multiple industries 

application and potentially high relevance for our live. However, further advances are still required to 

assure a sustainable and profitable system. 

Inulin can be actively hydrolyzed by microbial inulinases (fructofuranosyl hydrolases) to produce 

inulo-oligosaccharides (IOS), glucose and fructose as main products. In Figure 3 are illustrated the 

different inulinases activities, which can be divided into exo- and endo-acting enzymes according to the 

effect over the inulin. Endoinulinases (EC 3.2.1.7) are specific for inulin and can hydrolyze the internal ?-

2, 1-fructofuranosidic linkages to yield IOS, which are inulin chains with DP from 2 to 7 (Nguyen et al., 

2011).

1.2.1.1. Inulinases 

The IOS have high applicability in the food industry, like confectionery, fruit preparations, milk 

desserts, yogurt and fresh cheese, as a functional food, with positive effects described as dietary fiber 

(Kaur and Gupta, 2002; Roberfroid, 2005). These features have increased the attention towards 

endoinulinase and their commercial application. Exoinulinases (EC 3.2.1.153) split off terminal fructose 

units from the non-reducing end of inulin, and also hydrolyze the disaccharide, sucrose, and the 

trisaccharide, raffinose (Yuan et al., 2012).

while endoinulinase produces IOS. (Figure adapted from Kango and Jain, 2011).

A number of microorganisms including molds, yeasts, actinomycetes and other bacteria are known to 

produce inulin hydrolyzing enzymes (Vandamme and Derycke, 1983; Pandey et al., 1999; Singh and Gill, 

2006). Among the molds group, Aspergillus and Penicillium are the prominent genera, for bacteria the 

most promising producers include species of Xanthomonas and Pseudomonas, while Kluyveromyces 

genera is the most exploited yeast group for inulinase production, as summarized by Kango and Jain 

(2011). Over 35 inulinases have been characterized, from different microbial strains isolated from very 

different location. Several fungi and yeasts species of Aspergillus and Kluyveromyces genera have been 

used for inulinase production and gene characterization. Enzymes produced by most of strains are 

extracellular in nature (Pandey et al., 1999), however some authors reported as high as 50% and 75% of 

enzyme activity to be cell-associated (Rouwenhorst et al., 1991; Parekh and Margaritis, 1986).  

Typically, exoinulinases present an invertase activity due to wide substrate specificity; therefore the 

classification of enzymatic activity depends on an activity ratio between invertase/ inulinase (I/S). Kangoo 

and Jain in 2011 considered the limit of 1 for the I/S ratio enough to separate inulinases from invertases, 

although Guiraud (1981) assumed different values: for inulinase the I/S ratio should be higher than 10
-2

, 

while for invertase the ratio values should be lower than I0
-4

.  

Inulinases are key enzymes for inulin based bioprocesses to occur hence described microorganisms 

cannot use this polymer without previous hydrolysis. Concerning the application of inulin for 

bioprocesses, the most desirable condition is the mix production of exo- and endo inulolytic enzymes, 

which results in total inulin hydrolysis into, mostly, fructose (Fru) and some glucose (Glu). The resulting 

ratio [Fru/Glu] depends on the initial inulin DP level. Afterwards the sugar rich hydrolysate can be used for 

bioprocesses as carbon source, retrieved from a natural, inexpensive and ecological source.  

It is described that enzymatic inulin hydrolysis can reach yields up to 95% of fructose in high fructose 

syrups (HFS) (Ettalibi and Baratti, 2001; Makino et al., 2009). Inulin can also be hydrolyzed by acid 

treatment (pH=1.0 - 2.0 at 80 - 100 °C), but low pH results in degradation of fructose and the process also 

gives rise to difructose anhydrides, an inhibitory compound for bioprocesses. Therefore, enzymatically 

hydrolyzed inulin is an important substrate, with high potential for HFS production for nutritional industry 

and for bioethanol production.  

1.2.1.2. Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) 

The Jerusalem artichoke is a warm-season crop, native of North America and it has been grown to 

produce fructans that can be used for ethanol production, human-diet or medical and industrial 

applications (Meijer and Mathijssen, 1993). This interesting perennial tuberous plant belongs to the 

Asteraceae family and develops potato-like reserve tuberous with high inulin content (Table 3) when 

harvested at the appropriate season. Jerusalem artichoke has many desirable growing traits such as cold 

and drought tolerance, wind and sand resistance, saline tolerance, strong fecundity and high pest and 

disease resistance and does not require soil fertility (Zhang et al., 2010; Negro et al., 2006). The growth 

of Jerusalem artichoke with saline aquaculture wastewater (Gengmao et al., 2010) is a demonstration of 

this plant’s potential as a renewable carbon source which can be produced without direct competition with 

arable soil and using a wastewater flow.  

In the last years, many researchers and governments in the world, especially in developing countries, 

have been interested in using non-food grains as the materials in bioprocesses (e.g. bioethanol 



9 

production) due to the shortage of food grain, its high price and grain insecurity worldwide (Li and Chan-

Halbrendt, 2009). In this context, inulin rich materials have gain importance as carbohydrates source for 

bioprocesses over the majority of food grains, such as starch-containing materials (Chi et al., 2001). 

Thus, inulin and inulin containing plants, such as Jerusalem artichoke, are promising substrates to use in 

bioprocesses, if the industrial bases are set up: development of resistant and rentable inulinase 

production; selection of efficient microbial strains and design of an economically viable bioprocess. 

Hence, Jerusalem artichoke, an inulin rich material, is one of the most interesting sources among 

unconventional and renewable raw materials, due to the high production of fermentable sugars (glucose 

and fructose) that can be used for several applications (e.g. nutritional industry, bioethanol production) 

and as a low cost alternative to purified inulin.  

Researchers have studied the bioethanol production from Jerusalem artichoke tubers. While some 

consider the SSF approach as the most applicable, where a highly ethanologenic yeast strain of S. 

cerevisiae and the fungi Aspergillus niger are joined to ferment the raw substrate in the same 

fermentation batch (Nakamura et al., 1996; Ohta et al., 1993); others studied the SHF approach using a 

yeast strain of S. cerevisiae (Zhang et al., 2010), or the bacterium Zymomonas mobilis (Onsoy et al., 

2007) or even a mix of Z. mobilis, S. cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces fragilis (Szambelan et al., 2004) for 

bioethanol production. The co-culture of different species for ethanol and enzyme production is difficult to 

be optimized due to different physiological conditions for the used species. Therefore to achieved a 

higher integrated bioethanol production system, yeasts capable of hydrolyzing inulin and produce ethanol 

like K. marxianus have been used directly with Jerusalem artichoke juice (Yuan et al., 2011; Yuan et al., 

2008b; Bajpai and Margaritis, 1986), although with a low bioethanol yield. Strains of S. cerevisiae have 

been reported to directly utilize Jerusalem artichoke juice, again, with the production of low ethanol 

concentration (Lim et al., 2011). In addition, the Jerusalem artichoke tubers have been proposed as 

carbon source for different bioprocesses for production of value-added products such as: L-lactic acid, 

2,3-butanediol, lipids, single-cell protein and single cell oil (Ge et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 

2010; Gao et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2011).  

1.3. Microbial isolation and characterization  

Currently, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast is the main producer of industrial bioethanol due to its 

high ethanol concentration production from glucose and sucrose and its high ethanol tolerance. However, 

several drawbacks limit the use of this yeast in the design of high efficient industrial bioprocesses for 

bioethanol production from renewable and inexpensive biomass (e.g. lignocellulosic or inulin-rich 

materials), such as: unavailability of the necessary enzymatic machinery, inability to ferment C5 

compounds (e.g. xilose) and intolerance to high temperatures. For these reasons is unfeasible to perform 

a consolidated bioprocessing (CBP), where the whole process occurs in one fermentation batch at the 

same time. 

In this context, the screening and isolation of new microorganisms, mainly novel yeasts, presenting 

innovative characteristics, is crucial. Features such as higher thermotolerance, higher tolerance to 

ethanol and other inhibitors, and ability of produce the entire hydrolytic enzymes (e.g. xylanases and 

cellulases, inulinases, amylases, etc) are imperative to develop a CBP for bioethanol production. The 

CBP is the best conceptual design for biofuel production given that it is the most integrated bioprocess. 



10 

However, until now no microorganism or compatible combination of microorganisms that produce the 

required enzymatic machinery and produce ethanol at the necessary high concentration and yield, is 

available.  

1.3.1. Yeast isolation 

Yeasts are recovered from all habitats, aquatic, marine, atmospheric and terrestrial seldom occur 

without molds or bacteria (Kurtzman et al., 2011). Consequently, selective techniques must be used in 

order to recover yeasts. Employing selective media, with pH levels and/or water activities that reduce or 

inhibit the growth of bacteria or by inclusion of antibiotics/ fungistatic agents permits the isolation of one 

particular colony. Most yeasts are mesophilic, which means the incubation temperature should be around 

20-25 ºC, although specific groups like psychrophilic require lower temperatures between 4 and 15 ºC. 

Several media have been designated for these purposes, with lower pH’s which suppresses most 

bacterial growth or with addiction of antibiotics like chloramphenicol. An example is the Rose Bengal 

Chloramphenicol Agar, used for selective isolation and enumeration of yeasts and molds from food. 

Chloramphenicol is recommended as a selective agent in fungal medium with a neutral pH because of its 

heat stability and broad antibacterial spectrum (Mislivec et al., 1992). The Rose Bengal dye has also 

known cytotoxic effects on bacterial species (Banks et al., 1985), increasing the selectivity of the medium 

towards yeasts. 

1.3.2. Characterization by classical biochemical tests 

The classical methods used for microbial identification are culture-dependent methods based on 

morphological and physiological tests which require microorganisms to be isolated and cultivated prior to 

identification. Today, we live the era of microbial strain identification by gene sequencing, which as shown 

to be faster and more accurate than classical methods (Kurtzman et al., 2011). However, morphological 

and physiological properties must be reported in order to describe the general biological properties of the 

species. These features are of extreme importance, since they refer to the phenotypic characteristics of 

strains, crucial information for biotechnological purposes. The physiological tests commonly used for 

identification are carbohydrates fermentation, growth on various carbon and nitrogen sources, growth at 

different temperatures or on media with high content sugar or sodium chloride. However, these are time 

consuming and laborious methods and automated diagnostic systems have been developed for rapid 

microbial identification. Initially design for clinical purposes, these systems are applied for yeasts 

identification with relative success, since they support in growth reactions. The most used systems are 

the API (Analytical Profile Index) System, Biolog and Vitek cards. The identification capacity of these 

systems depends on the size of the corresponding database, which in the case of yeasts species is very 

incomplete. 

1.3.3. Fluorescence in situ hybridization 

The Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a molecular method based on the hybridization of 

synthetic fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide probes targeted to specific regions of the ribosomal RNA 

(rRNA) of a microorganism. The fluorescently-labeled FISH-probes enter inside the cells and hybridize 

with the rRNA target-sequence that is complementary to the cDNA sequence of the probe, emitting a 

fluorescent signal that allows the visualization of the intact cell by epifluorescence microscopy (Amann 



11 

and Fuchs, 2008). Since FISH is a culture-independent method that allows the identification of specific 

microbial species at the single-cell level, it has been considered as the most powerful method for various 

applications in microbiology (Amann and Fuchs, 2008). 

A typical FISH protocol using rRNA-targeted oligonucleotides probes includes four steps: fixation and 

permeabilization, hybridization, washing, visualization and/or quantification of hybridized cells by 

epifluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry (see Figure 4). First, the microbial cells are permeabilized 

to allow penetration of the fluorescent probes into the cell and then fixed to protect RNA from degradation 

by endogenous RNAses. Afterwards, the fluorescently labeled FISH-probes are added to the fixed cells 

and allowed to hybridize with the targeted-sequence by incubating the mixture at temperatures of about 

46-60 ºC during several hours, typically three hours (Moter and Gobel, 2000; Amman and Fuchs, 2008). 

After hybridization, a washing step is carried out to remove unbound probe. 

 

Figure 4. Basic steps of fluorescent in situ hybridization (withdrawn from Amann and Fuchs, 2008). 

Applying the FISH procedure requires the design of species-specific probes able to hybridize with the 

targeted sequence. The RNA molecules that constitute the ribosome (small 16S/18S and large 23S/26S 

subunits) meet most of the characteristics required to choose as target-sequence: they are present in all 

cellular organisms; they are genetically stable containing variable and conserved regions; they exist in 

high numbers in metabolically active cells, which means that there are sufficient targets inside a single 

cell to allow its visualization; there is a high number of RNA sequences available in public databases (e.g. 

GenBank), which allows the design of species-specific probes through the alignment and comparison of 

sequences for different species. In yeasts, the D1/D2 domains of 26S rRNA exhibits a high degree of 

interspecies sequence variation, and consequently has been used for many phylogenetic and 

identification studies (Kurtzman and Robnett, 1998; Fell et al., 2000). The general features to consider in 

the designing of a FISH-probe are: specificity, taking into account dimension, the number of nucleotides 



12 

that differentiate it from phylogenetically-close species and its composition; ability to penetrate the cell 

and accessibility to the rRNA region where the target-sequence is located. The oligonucleotides probes 

used in FISH are generally 15 to 20 nucleotides long and have a fluorescent dye covalently linked to its 

terminal 5’-end. The most commonly used fluorescent dyes to label oligonucleotides probes are: 

fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA), carbocyanine (Cy3, Cy5 and Cy7) 

and tetramethylrhodamine-isotiocianate (TRICT) (Amann et al., 2001). 

In situ identification of individual cells by FISH may be hindered by low cellular ribosome content, 

limited cell wall permeability and inaccessibility of the probe to the target sites of the rRNA, mainly due to 

structural issues (Bidnenko et al., 1998; Binder and Liu, 1998; Fuchs et al., 1998; Inácio et al., 2003). 

Inaccessibility of the probes to the target regions of rRNA is usually caused by molecular interactions 

(rRNA-rRNA and rRNA-protein) in which the target region of the ribosome is involved (Amann et al., 

1995). To overcome the target site inaccessibility, Fuchs et al. (2000) evaluated the potential of several 

unlabeled helper oligonucleotides, which bind adjacent to the probe target site, in order to increase weak 

probe hybridization signals in Escherichia coli DSM 30083T. Their results suggested that by the joint 

action of multiple adjacent helper oligonucleotides, every site on the rRNA could be opened for FISH. 

Inácio et al. (2003) evaluated the accessibility of fluorescently labeled probes to the D1/D2 domains of the 

26S rRNA of S. cerevisiae and designed an accessibility map for this species. Based on this accessibility 

map, Xufre (2005) designed species-specific FISH-probes that allowed the monitorization of the 

population evolution of several yeast species (i.e. Hanseniaspora uvarum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, 

Lachancea thermotolerans, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Torulaspora 

delbrueckii and Zygosaccharomyces bailii) during industrial and laboratory wine fermentations. 

In this work, the probes of Xufre (2005) were used in FISH assays for a preliminary molecular method 

for a species putative identification of the selected novel yeast isolates presenting potential for bioethanol 

production. 

1.4. Scope of the thesis 

The main goal of this work was to search for novel microbial strains, in special new yeasts, with high 

potential to produce bioethanol, due to either the presence of better ethanologenic characteristics (e. g. 

high tolerance to ethanol concentration, extremes pH and/or temperature; ability to perform long term 

fermentations) or production of relevant hydrolytic enzymatic machinery, which can be competitive in 

further application for industrial bioprocesses.  

All the novel yeasts strains isolated which presented interesting characteristics for further application 

in a biofuel production process were characterized using classical biochemical methods and the 

fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique, as a preliminary molecular approach for the putative 

identification of the selected isolates. 

In addition, novel inulinases produced by a promising selected yeast isolate, were also applied for 

bioethanol production in a consolidated bioprocess (CBP), and in a Simultaneous Saccharification and 

Fermentation (SSF) process, using inulin and inulin rich materials as carbon source.

2. Materials and Methods 

2.1. Isolation of novel microorganisms 

Different fruits with high levels of fermentable sugars (glucose, fructose and sucrose) were chosen as 

natural isolation sources, namely: carob (Ceratonia síliqua) pulp kibbles, cherry (Prunus avium), fig (Ficus 

carica), Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) tubers, peach (Prunus persica), plum (Prunus 

domestica) and strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) fruits. The cherries, figs, peaches and plums were 

collected from the Portuguese west region (Torres Vedras, Portugal), while Jerusalem artichoke tubers 

and strawberry tree fruits were harvest from the north region (Oleiros, Portugal) and the carob pulp 

kibbles were from the south region (Faro, Portugal). Each fruit was mashed into a homogeneous pulp. 

For carob pulp kibbles and Jerusalem artichoke tubers, a pre-enrichment step was performed, inoculating 

1% (w/v) of each pulp in 100 ml shake flasks containing 25 ml of tryptone soy broth (TSB; Oxoid, 

Switzerland). The flasks were incubated in a rotary shaker (150 rpm) at 25 ºC for 48 h, for microbial 

enrichment. For the other fruits, the pulp itself was used for the isolation procedure. 

2.1.1. Isolation procedure 

The microorganisms were isolated by decimal serial dilution of the pulps (dilution factor ranging from  

-4 to -7), pre-enriched or not, and plated on rose bengal chloramphenicol agar (RBC; Merck, Germany) 

through standard spread plate method. All plates were incubated at 25 ºC for 3 to 5 days. After 

incubation, individualized and morphologically different colonies (yeast or bacterium like) were selected 

and purified on yeast malt agar (YMA; Scharlau, Spain) plates. For purification, each isolate was 

transferred at least three times. The isolates were maintained on YMA slants at 4 ºC and sub-cultured 

monthly for laboratory routine. All isolates were also maintained at -25 ºC by addition of 30% (v/v) glicerol 

to previously grown cultures in yeast malt broth (YMB; Sigma, USA). 

2.2. Alcoholic fermentation screening 

The microbial isolates were previously inoculated in test tubes containing 5 ml of sterilized YMB 

medium and incubated for 2 - 3 days at 25 ºC without shaking, for inocula production. An aliquot (130 ?l) 

of each inoculum was then transferred to a 16 cm test tube containing an invert Durham tube in 10 - 12 

ml of a sterilized liquid medium with 0.5% (w/v) of yeast extract and the tested carbon source (50 mM 

arabinose, fructose, glucose, xylose, cellobiose, lactose or sucrose and 8.5 g/l inulin). For blank controls, 

an aliquot of each inoculum was transferred to a 16 cm test tube containing an invert Durham tube in 10 - 

12 ml of liquid medium with 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract but without any carbon source. After 7 days of 

incubation at 25 ºC without shaking, all tubes were observed for growth density and gas formation  inside 

the invert Durham tube, as an indicator of alcoholic fermentation ability.  

For the strawberry tree fruits’ isolates, this method was adapted to test their ability to use the 

strawberry tree fruit’ juice (STFJ) as substrate to alcoholic fermentation. In this case, the liquid medium 

within the test tubes consisted on 10 - 12 ml of non-sterile pure STFJ. The test tubes were incubated at 

25 ºC without shaking and the growth and gas formation were observed after 3 and 7 days.

2.3. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 

2.3.1. Oligonucleotide probes 

In this work were used the oligonucleotides probes for Hanseniaspora uvarum (Huv), Kluyveromyces 

marxianus (Kma), Lachancea thermotolerans (Lth), Metschnikowia pulcherrima (Mpu), Saccharomyces 

cerevisiae (Sce), Torulaspora delbrueckii (Tde), Zygosaccharomyces bailii (Zba) and for eukaryotic cells 

(EUK516). These probes were those previously designated by Xufre (2005); with exception for the 

EUK516 probe, which was design by Amann et al. (1990). The specie-specific FISH probes are formed 

by 17-19 nucleotides and targeted the D1-D2 domain of the 26S ribosomal RNA (Table 4). The probes 

were synthesized and labeled with the fluorochrome Fluorescein IsoThioCyanate (FITC) at the 5’-end.

2.3.2. FISH procedure 

2.3.2.1. Silanization  

The acetone resistant glass slides used (Slides for Immunofluorescence, bioMérieux, France) 

presented 10 circles (6 mm diameter) and were silanized to facilitate the hybridization protocol. The 

silanization was carried out as follows: slides were emerged in absolute ethanol for 1 h, and carefully 

dried after washed with Milli-Q water. Afterwards, glass slides were submerged on 2% (v/v) bis (3-

trimethoxysilylpropyl) amine in acetone solution for 2 min. The glass slides were cleaned in acetone for 1 

min, before emerged in Milli-Q water and carefully dried for the hybridization procedures. 

2.3.2.2. Fixation 

The FISH procedure used in this work was adapted from Xufre et al. (2006) to be used in appropriate 

glass slides. The fixation protocol performed consisted on: 1 ml cell growth in YMB medium for 

approximately 24 h was centrifuged for 5 min at 4 000 × g. The pellet was then washed once with 

phosphate-buffered saline 1x (PBS 1x) (see Appendix) and then incubated with 4% (v/v) of 

paraformaldehyde solution in PBS 1x for 16 h at 4 ºC under strong agitation. Subsequently, fixed cells 



15 

were centrifuged for 2 min at 10 000 × g and resuspended in 400 ?l PBS 1x and 400 ?l ethanol 98% (v/v). 

The fixed cells samples were kept at -20 ºC until required.  

2.3.2.3. Hybridization 

The hybridization step involved the silanizated slides, through the following protocol: 5 ?l of fixed cells 

sample was dried on a circle, after 15 min at 55 ºC. Subsequently, 12 ?l of enzyme solution (1 mg/ml of 

lysozyme in PBS 1x) were add to each circle filled with fixed cells and incubated in a humidity chamber at 

37 ºC for 30 min. After washing each slide in Milli-Q water and carefully dry it, a dehydration step with 

increasing ethanol concentration solutions was conducted: 2 min in 50% (v/v) ethanol solution, then 2 min 

in 80% (v/v) ethanol and finally 2 min in 98% (v/v) ethanol solution. For the hybridization step, 10 ?l of the 

hybridization solution (hybridization buffer (Appendix) together with 5 ng/ml of FITC labeled probe) was 

dropped in each circle. Incubation was performed at 46 ºC for, at least, 3 h protected from light. After 

hybridization, the slide was emerged in Washing Buffer (Appendix) and incubated at 48 ºC for 30 min. 

Afterward each slide was washed in Milli-Q waters and dried at 37 ºC. For fluorescence preservation, 

slides were then mounted with a drop of VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, USA) for observation 

purposes by epifluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX-60, Tokyo, Japan) with the appropriate filter for 

FITC wavelength.  

2.3.3. Controls 

Strains well identified and routinely used at laboratory were used as positive controls for each FISH 

assay, namely: Hanseniaspora uvarum CBS 314, Kluyveromyces marxianus 516F, Lachancea 

thermotolerans CBS 2803, Metschnikowia pulcherrima NRRL Y-987, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCMI 

885, Torulaspora delbrueckii PYCC 4478 and Zygosaccharomyces bailii 518F.  

The yeast strain designated Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCMI 885 was isolated from Alentejo grape 

musts (Albergaria et al., 2000) and was preserved from the previous Culture Collection of Industrial 

Microorganism (CCMI) of INETI, Lisbon, Portugal. The CBS 2803 strain was also isolated from grapes, in 

Italy. The PYCC 4478 strain was isolated from yellow and sulfurous concentrated must beverage from 

Azeitão, Portugal. The K. marxianus and the Z. bailii strains used were isolated from grape must 

produced in Borba wine cellar and identified by Xufre (2005). All strains are maintained at laboratory for 

routine usage. 

In all FISH assays an autofluorescence control was conducted to prevent from false-positive results, 

where cells were subject to all the FISH procedure but without the addition of FITC probe. 

2.4. Metabolic characterization 

The metabolic characterization of some selected isolates was performed using the Analytical Profile 

Index (API) galleries, namely the API ZYM and API 20C AUX standard tests, according to the 

manufacturer’s instructions (API
®
, bioMérieux, Switzerland). The biochemical tests included in these API 

galleries determine the presence of enzymatic activities (API ZYM) and the sugar assimilation profiles 

(API 20C AUX). 



16 

2.4.1. API ZYM 

For the selected isolates, a cell suspension was prepared from a fresh YMA slant (approximately     

72 h) in an ampoule of NaCl 0.85% (w/v) medium (5 ml) to reach a cell density of 5 McFarland by 

comparison with a standard. The 20 cupules of the API ZYM strips were inoculated with 65 ?l of cell 

suspension each. The inoculated galleries were incubated at 30 ºC for 4 h. All the reactions were 

evaluated by direct observation, according to the standard operational procedure supplied by the 

manufacturer. 

2.4.2. API 20 C AUX 

For the selected isolates, the initial cell suspensions were prepared in 7 ml API M medium 

(bioMérieux, France) to obtain a cell density of 2 McFarland. The suspensions were gently homogenized 

with a pipette. The 20 cupules of API 20C AUX strips were then filled with each cell suspension, using a 

sterile Pasteur pipette, and incubated at 30 ºC. The results were registered after 48 h and 72 h of 

incubation, according to manufacturer’s instructions. 

2.5. Inulinase Production 

2.5.1. Inulinase induction 

The microbial isolates positive for inulinase activity (Talf1, Talf2 and Calf2) were previously 

transferred from the YMA slant to 25 ml of YMB in 150 ml erlenmeyer flask and cultivated aerobically for 

24 hours at 25 ºC, for the inocula production. After, 10% inoculum was used to inoculate 500 ml 

erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 - 150 ml of the induction medium consisting of YMB supplemented with 

10% (v/v) inulin (90-95% inulin extracted from chicory roots; Fagron, Spain) or 25% (v/v) Jerusalem 

artichoke juice (JAJ), as inducer substrates. The JAJ was obtained by crushing the tubers in a juicer and 

recovering the liquid. The cultures were grown by shaking at 150 rpm, 25 ºC for 8 days. The growth 

samples were centrifuged at 5 000 × g, 4 ºC for 10 min, and the supernatants were sterilized by filtration 

through 0.2 ?m membrane and kept at -20 ºC. The supernatants were used as the enzyme extracts for 

enzymatic activity determination. The assays were carried out in duplicates. 

Moreover, for the best inulinase producer yeast strain, a new set of assays were carried out testing a 

wider range of inducer substrates, from different pure inulin sources to complex raw materials. Thus, in 

addition to inulin from Fagron, other two inulins were also tested, namely: an inulin from Sigma (extracted 

from dahlia tubers) and an inulin from BDH chemicals (from unknown natural source). Furthermore, 

besides JAJ, three new complex raw materials were also tested, namely: dahlia tubers (Dahlia spp), 

chard roots (Beta vulgaris L. var. cicla) and JA solid residue. The dahlia tuber is another known natural 

source for inulin while the chard is an edible plant close related with sugar beet (Beta vulgaris). The 

dahlia tubers and chard roots were grown in the laboratory campus (LNEG, Portugal) and milled before 

use. In this set of assays, the induction medium consisted of YMB supplemented with 10% (w/v) of each 

new inducer substrate tested. The assays were carried out in duplicates. 

2.5.2. Inulinase activity determination 

For determination of the inulinase activity in each enzymatic extract, the amount of reducing sugars 

released from inulin hydrolysis in each reaction mixture was assayed using DNS method (Miller, 1959). 



17 

The reaction mixtures consisted of 25 ?l of crude enzymatic extract and 975 ?l of 1% inulin in 50 mM 

sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, and were incubated at 45 ºC for 15 min. Each reaction was immediately 

inactivated by putting the reaction mixtures on ice and adding 500 ?l of DNS reagent (see Appendix). 

Subsequently, the reaction mixtures were put in boiling water for 5 min and then cooled on ice for 5 min. 

The same mixtures, but with inactivated enzyme crude extracts, were used as blank controls. All 

enzymatic reactions were performed in duplicates. To each reaction tube 5 ml of distilled water was 

added and the absorbance was determined at 540 nm in a UV/Vis microplate spectrophotometer 

(Multiskan GO, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Finland) in triplicate for each reaction. Quantifications of 

reducing sugars were carried out using a standard curve. 

The standard curve for DNS method was prepared using fructose (stock solution: 2 g/l fructose in 50 

mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5). Several dilutions of the fructose solution were prepared in a final 

volume of 1 ml, as indicated in  Table 5. The 50 mM sodium citrate buffer pH 5.5 was used as blank. The 

reactions for standard curve were also performed in duplicates. One unit of inulinase activity (U) was 

defined as the amount of enzyme responsible for the production of 1 ?mol of reducing sugar per minute 

under the above conditions.

2.5.3. Characterization of inulinases 

The influence of temperature and pH on inulinase activity was carried out on the sterile Talf1 crude 

enzymatic extract. This extract was previously obtained by growing the yeast strain Talf1 in YMB 

supplemented with 25% (v/v) Jerusalem artichoke juice for 8 days at 25 ºC, with shaking (150 rpm). The 

optimal temperature for inulin hydrolysis by Talf1 enzymatic extract was determined by incubating the 

crude extract (5 ml) at temperatures ranging from 20 to 65 ºC. Thermal stability data were obtained by 

incubating the enzyme extract (5 ml) at 30, 45 and 50 ºC, for different time intervals, from 3 hours to 24 

days, after which the remaining inulinase activity was determined. The effect of pH on Talf1 enzymatic 

extract was studied using different buffers: 50 mM sodium citrate (pHs: 3.0 - 7.0) and 50 mM Tris/HCl 

buffer (pHs: 7.5, 8.0 and 8.5) (see Appendix). Data of stability to pH were also evaluated by incubating 

the Talf1 crude extract adjusted to different pHs (5.5; 7.5 and 10) at 30ºC for different time intervals (0 - 

24 days), after which the remaining inulinase activity was determined. 



18 

2.6. Bioethanol production  

2.6.1. Carbon source: inulin 

A study for the ethanol production from inulin was performed by two bioprocesses: a consolidated 

bioprocessing (CBP) and a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). The CBP was 

conducted with the yeast Talf1, a strain selected from several microbial isolates, using an Inulin 

Fermentative Medium (see Appendix). The SSF process was carried out with the strain Saccharomyces 

cerevisiae CCMI 885 using the same fermentative medium, but supplemented with 5% (v/v) of Talf1 

enzymatic extract (previously obtained by growing the yeast strain Talf1 in YMB supplemented with 25% 

(v/v) Jerusalem artichoke juice, at 25 ºC with shaking (150 rpm) for 8 days). A control growth was also 

performed with the strain S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 in the same Inulin Fermentative Medium without 

enzymatic extract addition. For all assays, prior inocula were prepared in YMB medium and incubated at 

25 ºC with shaking (150 rpm) for 24 h. Then, the assays for both bioprocesses were conducted in 150 ml 

of fermentative medium in 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks, inoculated with 10% (v/v) inoculum (the 

correspondent pellet of inoculum culture centrifuged was resuspended in the medium), and incubated at 

25 ºC, without shaking, for 8 days. All the assays were carried out in triplicates except the control growth 

with S. cerevisiae. Ethanol production, sugar consumption and cell growth were monitored along the 

bioprocess. 

2.6.2. Fermentative medium: Jerusalem artichoke juice 

Using the same procedure as described above, the yeast strains Talf1 and S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 

were inoculated directly in pure Jerusalem artichoke juice (JAJ) (an inulin rich raw material with 

approximately 130 g/l of hydrolyzable sugars), as the only nutrients source for ethanol production. The 

JAJ was obtained by crushing the tubers in a juicer and recovering the liquid. A CBP assay was 

conducted with strain Talf1 and a SSF was performed with S. cerevisiae CCMI 885, supplementing the 

JAJ with 5% (v/v) of the same Talf1 enzymatic extract described above. A control growth was also 

performed for the S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 inoculating it in the pure JAJ, but without the enzymatic extract 

addition. For both bioprocesses, fresh inocula were prior prepared as above described and 10% (v/v) of 

inocula (correspondent pellet) were used to inoculate the respective fermentative broth (150 ml) in 500 ml 

erlenmeyer flasks, and incubated at 25 ºC, without shaking, for 8 days. The assays were carried out in 

triplicates, except the control growth with S. cerevisiae. Ethanol production, sugar consumption and cell 

growth were monitored along the bioprocess.  

2.6.3. Fermentative medium: strawberry tree fruit’ juice 

Five simultaneous fermentations of pure strawberry tree fruit’ juice, as the only nutrients source, were 

conducted for the ethanol production, using 4 selected yeasts strains isolated from strawberry tree fruits 

(AP1, DP2, GerP3 and GluP4) and the strain S. cerevisiae CCMI 885. Each inoculum was prior grown in 

50 ml of YMB medium in 150 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, at 25 ºC with shaking (150 rpm) for approximately   

24 h. Then, the fermentation assays were carried out in 150 ml of pure strawberry tree fruit’ juice in 500 

ml shake flasks, inoculated respectively with 10% (v/v) of centrifuged inoculum, incubated at 25 ºC, 

without shaking, for 9 days. The strawberry tree fruit’ juice was obtained by crushing the fruits into a 



19 

homogenous pulp and centrifuged at 4 000 × g for 15 min. The liquid phase was used as the fermentative 

medium without further treatment. All assays were carried out in duplicates. The ethanol production, 

sugar consumption and cell growth were monitored along the fermentation processes. 

2.7. Analytical Methods 

The cell growth was monitored by measurement the optical density (OD) of culture broth samples at 

600 nm, using a spectrophotometer (Genesys 20, Thermo Electron Corporation, USA). The maximum 

growth rates (?max) were calculated trought lineat regression of the 3 first ponts of exponencial phase, 

using Excel software (Microsoft
®
 Office Excel

®
, 2007 for Windows). 

Sugars and ethanol concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography 

(HPLC) using a Waters Sugar-Pak I column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) operating at 75 ºC with Ca-

EDTA at 50 mg/l as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. 

In the batch fermentations for bioethanol production from inulin, the remaining amount of inulin in the 

fermentative broths at the end of the assays (unhydrolyzed inulin by inulinases) was quantified by 

performing an acid hydrolysis of the inulin present in each broth sample. These hydrolyses were carried 

out incubating the samples at 55 ºC and pH 2 for 96 h. The respective hydrolysates were then analyzed 

for sugar content by HPLC using an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) operating at 

50 ºC with 5 mM H2SO4 as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min.

3. Results and Discussion 

3.1. Isolation of novel microorganisms 

The isolation of novel microorganisms was performed from 7 different natural sources, namely, carob 

kibbles, cherries, figs, Jerusalem artichoke tubers, peaches, plums and strawberry tree fruits (STF), which 

were chosen due its high content in fermentable sugars (glucose, fructose and sucrose) and/or 

polysaccharides (inulin), a favorable habitat for ethanologenic yeasts and bacteria. The STF was also 

chosen by the special environment of its natural fermentation, which occurs in a very unique environment, 

taking much more time and with much less water content than the wine fermentation processes 

(Soufleros et al., 2005). A total of 98 new microorganisms were collected: 90 yeasts and 8 bacteria (Table 

6). As the main goal was to isolate yeasts, it was used the RBC medium for the isolation procedure 

because it is a selective medium, i. e. the presence of chloramphenicol (a broad-spectrum antibiotic 

inhibitory to a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria) and Rose Bengal (shown by 

Smith et al. (1944) to inhibit bacterial growth and restrict the growth of fast growing molds) in the medium 

decreased the possibility of collecting bacteria. RCB is also a differential medium due to the presence of 

the pigment Rose Bengal that can be differently assimilated by colonies, conferring them different colors. 

Despite the RBC influence, only bacteria (7) were isolated from Jerusalem artichoke tubers. Unlike the 

other materials used, the tubers are very close to the soil (a known source of bacterial species and a 

harsh environment for yeast species) which may explain the absence of yeasts collected and strong 

bacterial presence.

3.2. Screening for alcoholic fermentation ability 

To assess the potential ability of the novel 98 microbial isolates for alcoholic fermentation, simple 

physiological tests were conducted in test tubes using the invert Durham tube method. The potential for 

the ethanol production was evaluated for 9 different carbon sources: simple sugars (arabinose, fructose, 

glucose and xylose), disaccharides (cellobiose, lactose and sucrose), a polymer (inulin) and complex raw 

material (strawberry tree fruit’ juice, STFJ) (see Table 15). In Table 7 are summarized the results 



21 

according to natural isolation origin. The carbon sources more fermented to ethanol were glucose (83% of 

the isolates), fructose (76% of isolates) and sucrose (21% of isolates), as expected. The xylose was 

actively converted to ethanol by 5 strains, all bacterial species (from Jerusalem artichoke tubers and 

STF), and the yeast strain named XilP2 (from STF) presented a positive result for lactose fermentation, 

but all of them achieved low ethanol concentration.

Note: positive results were considered by comparison with the negative control for growth and gas accumulation. Observation of 

growth (G) and gas accumulation inside the invert Durham tubes (F) was recorded after 7 days of incubation at 25 ºC without 

shaking. Carbon source tested: arabinose (ARA), cellobiose (CEL), fructose (FRU), glucose (GLU), inulin (INU), lactose (LAC), 

sucrose (SUC) and xylose (XYL). The assay with pure strawberry tree fruit’ juice (STFJ) as complete medium is highlighted in grey.

The results with more biotechnology interest concerns the inulin fermentation, where 3 yeasts were 

able of both strong growth and inulin fermentation. These yeast strains, named Talf1, Talf2 and Calf2, 

showed the ability for inulinase production, since the inulin hydrolysis is required for its consumption. 

Interestingly, the 3 strains were collected from the same natural source, the carob kibbles. The carob 

kibbles main component is sucrose, which may explain these results once inulinase activity is associated 

with invertase activity (Kangoo and Jain, 2011). 

The strawberry tree fruit’ juice (STFJ) was also tested as carbon source for alcoholic fermentation, 

with the 30 microorganisms (29 yeasts and 1 bacterium) isolated from STF. A similar test using invert 

Durham tubes permitted to distinguish 4 yeasts that were capable of a rapid and strong growth with great 

gas liberation, associated with ethanol production, despite all microorganisms showed growth and 23 (out 

of 30) showed gas liberation, after 7 days of incubation (see Table 7).  



22 

In overall, from this screening the most promising isolates, 7 yeast strains, were selected for further 

analysis. Four strains from STF, named AP1, DP2, GerP3 and GluP4, due to their ability of rapidly use 

the STFJ as only nutrient medium for alcoholic fermentation, were selected for further application in 

ethanol production from STFJ. Moreover, 3 strains from carob kibbles, named Talf1, Talf2 and Calf2, 

presenting inulinase activities, were also selected due to the great interest in develop processes using 

inulin rich materials, like Jerusalem artichoke, for bioethanol production.  

3.3. Characterization of selected isolates 

3.3.1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization 

The molecular method FISH, widely developed as laboratory routine, was employed for the putative 

molecular identification of the 7 selected yeast strains, namely: AP1, DP2, GerP3, GluP4, Talf1, Talf2 and 

Calf2. Using FITC marked oligonucleotide probes for 7 known yeast species, usually encountered in 

winery, all strains gave a positive result for only one probe (see Table 8). Yeast strains, well identified and 

routinely used were applied as positive control strains for the probes in the FISH assays. To assure the 

presence of rRNA molecules in the fixed cells, a positive control using a group probe for all eukaryotic 

cells (EUK516) was carried out, reassuring the presence and availability of rRNA molecules inside the 

fixed cells. 

All the selected strains from carob kibbles (Talf1, Talf2 and Calf2) gave a positive result for the 

Zygosaccharomyces bailii probe, however this should be yet confirmed using more accurate molecular 

approaches, such as gene sequencing. If confirmed, it will be the first Z. bailii strain with ability of 

inulinase production, as far as I know. The existence of a Z. bailii strain with inulinase capacity opens a 

new focus of research, since this species, a known food-contaminant and associated with food spoilage, 

has interesting characteristics, such as: resistance to weak-acid preservatives, extreme osmotolerance, 

ability to adapt to high glucose concentrations and high temperatures, ability to vigorously ferment 

glucose, and growth at low pH (Martorell et al., 2007). In addition to the ability of inulinase production, 

these are important features for a strain to be used in bioprocesses for ethanol production.  

The 4 strains collected from the strawberry tree fruits gave positive for 3 different yeast species: 

Lachancea thermotolerans (AP1), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (DP2 and GluP4) and Zygosaccharomyces 

bailii (GerP3). The S. cerevisiae and Z. bailii species have been isolated from fruits or food spoilage and 

are known for ethanol tolerance and vigorous sugar fermentation capacity (Kurtzman et al., 2011). In 

previous microbiological studies with strawberry tree fruit natural fermentation, yeasts from L. 

thermotolerans and S. cerevisiae species were also isolated (Santos et al., 2012). As described above, 

these putative identifications using the FISH technique should be confirmed using more accurate 

molecular methods. In addition, further morphological and physiological studies with all the selected 

isolates should be also carried out, as complementary characterization tests.

3.3.2. Metabolic Profile 

A biochemical characterization was also carried out to the carob pulp kibbles isolated strains, Talf1, 

Talf2 and Calf2, using 2 different Analytical Profile Index (API) galleries: the API ZYM and the API 20C 

AUX (see Table 9). As for FISH assays, the strain Z. bailii 518F (Zba), previously identified by Xufre 

(2005), was also tested to be used as control for comparison with the results for these strains.

mannopyranoside (?-mannosidase) and 2-naphthyl-?-L-fucopyranoside (?-fucosidase). 

 

The results of API tests showed that the metabolic profile of the 3 isolated strains is more similar 

between each other than with the control Z. bailii strain (see Table 9). API gallery tests revealed that all 

strains presented alkaline phosphatase, esterase lipase (C8), leucine arylamidase, acid phosphatase and 



25 

phospho amidase and were all able to metabolize glucose, glycerol, 2-keto-D-gluconate, sorbitol, 

saccharose, trehalose and raffinose. No activity for trypsin, ?-chymotrypsin, ?-galactosidase, ?-

galactosidase, ?-glucuronidase, ?-glucosidase, N-acetyl-?-glucosaminidase, ?-mannosidase and ?-

fucosidase was detected in all tested strains. Xylose was consumed by all strains with the exception of 

Calf2. The Zba control strain presented the only positive result for esterase (C4), lipase (C14), cystine 

arylamidase, ?-glucosidase and was the only strain that metabolized galactose, cellobiose and maltose. 

Both Calf2 and Zba strains gave positive results for valine arylamidase and metabolized methyl-D-

glucoside, while the strains Talf1 and Talf2 gave positive for xylitol. The Talf2 and Calf2 both metabolized 

inositol.  

These results are consisting with the putative molecular identification by FISH, because all strains 

gave consisting results for glucose, glycerol, arabinose, galactose, lactose, saccharose, melezitose and 

treahalose assimilation. The treahalose assimilation is an important characteristic since it is used to 

distinguish Z. kombuchaensis and Z. lentus from Z. bailii, according to Kurtzman et al. (2011). 

Interestingly, it was for the Z. bailii 518F control strain where the results were less conclusive for the 

strain profile. Unexpected positive results for galactose, cellobiose and maltose growth created the 

divergences with the strain type profile in Kurtzman et al. (2011).  The growth in xylose (Talf1 and Talf2), 

inositol (Talf2 and Calf2), methyl-D-glucoside (Calf2 and Z. bailii) and raffinose (for all strains tested) was 

also contrary to the Z. bailii type strain accepted profile (Kurtzman et al., 2011). However, replicate tests 

should have been used to confirm the metabolic profiles obtained by the API galleries, as well as the 

parallel characterization of the Z. bailii wild type strain for comparison. The API 20C AUX micro-method is 

used for identification purposes (Fenn et al., 1994); however fail to differentiate at strain level. Molecular 

methods are used to differentiate at sub-species level, such as restriction fragment length polymorphism 

(RFLP), chromosome karyotyping, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and amplified fragment 

length polymorphism (AFLP) (Techera et al., 2001). 

3.4. Inulinase production 

3.4.1. Substrates Induction 

The three selected yeasts, Talf1, Talf2 and Calf2, with potential to inulinase production were further 

tested to produce enzymes and then evaluate their inulinase activities. So, for the production of 

inulinases, each of these strains were grown in YMB medium supplemented with 10% (w/v) of inulin or 

25% (v/v) Jerusalem artichoke juice (JAJ), as inducer substrates. Table 10 describes the results obtained 

for inulinase activity (U/ml) profiles during the growth of these yeast strains in the two inducers tested. 

These results show that pure inulin was a weak inducer for inulinase production by all strains, reaching to 

a maximum inulinase activity of about 0.60 U/ml, contrary to JAJ that acted as a strong inducer, 

especially for Talf1 and Talf2, which attained high inulinase activities since the 5th day of growth (see 

Table 10). Both Talf1 and Talf2 strains are good enzyme producers, however the maximum value of 

inulinase activity was achieved with the strain Talf1 (8.67 U/ml).  

An important factor for inulinases production is the carbon source that is used as inducer, since it 

influences the production level of extracellular inulinases (Vijayaraghavan et al., 2009). Commercially 

available inulin has been reported as a good inducer for inulinase producing microorganisms 



26 

(Vijayaraghavan et al., 2009), but inulin rich raw materials can sometime outstand the pure polymer 

induction capacity (Mazutti et al., 2006). The JAJ was neither treated nor purified and could have brought 

a mix of ions and other compounds, which may act as a nutrient supplement allowing, in this way, the 

achievement of higher levels of extracellular inulinase activity by these strains. Further analysis can be 

carried on JAJ to search for the presence of important metallic ions, which may contribute to improve the 

inulinase activity, such as Fe
3+

 and Mg
2+

 (Azhari et al., 1989). In addition, studies on the influence of ions 

in inulinase activity can also be performed.  

Table 10. Inulinase activity (U/ml) profile during the growth of the yeast strains Talf1, Talf2 and Calf2 in YMB supplemented with 

10 % (w/v) inulin or 25 % (v/v) Jerusalem artichoke juice, as inducer substrates. Data are given as activity means ± standard 

deviation (n=2).

In overall, the highest enzymatic activity was obtained in the crude extract after 8 days of incubation 

at 25ºC with agitation on 25% (v/v) JAJ, being Talf1 the best producer of inulinases. Hence, strain Talf1 

was selected for the inulinase production for further characterization and application to bioethanol 

production. 

Moreover, for Talf1, the best yeast strain producer of inulinases, a new set of assays were carried out 

testing a wider range of inducer substrates, from different pure inulin sources to complex raw materials, 

viewing the improvement of the inulinase production. Inulin purified from different natural sources has 

different characteristics, such as different DP levels in the polymer, which can influence the induction 

ability for the production of inulinases by the yeast strain selected. Thus, in addition to inulin from Fagron, 

other two inulins were also tested, namely: an inulin from Sigma (extracted from dahlia tubers) and an 

inulin from BDH chemicals (from unknown natural source). Furthermore, besides JAJ, three new complex 

raw materials were also tested, namely: dahlia tubers, chard roots and JA solid residue. The results 

obtained in these assays are described in Figure 5. All the purified inulins tested were weak inducers 

regarding the enzymatic induction. The highest value achieved in pure inulin was 0.6 U/ml with inulin from 

Sigma. As in the prior assays, the best inducers are the complex natural raw materials. All of them 

induced better enzyme activities than the purified forms of inulin. Regarding the inulin-rich materials 

tested as inducer substrates, these assays confirmed that JA is the best inducer substrate, inducing the 

highest inulinase activities even when used in the form of solid residue. The inulinase activities by Talf1 

observed with JA ranged from 5.9 U/ml (JA solid residue) to 8.7 U/ml (JAJ). So, JAJ was selected as the 

best inducer substrate for the production of Talf1 inulinases.

± standard deviation (n = 2). 

3.4.2. Inulinase characterization  

The characterization of Talf1 enzymatic extract (obtained from Talf1 growth in YMB medium 

supplemented with 25% (v/v) JAJ for 8 days) was performed to verify the optimum temperature and pH of 

its activity for inulin, as substrate, as well as to evaluate its thermal and pH stability. Figure 6 shows the 

results of Talf1 inulinase characterization. Figure 6A shows the influence of temperature (25 ºC - 65 ºC) 

on Talf1 inulinase activity. The maximal inulinase activity observed was obtained at 45 ºC. At 65 ºC 

almost all inulinase activity was inactivated (1.7%), which was caused by enzymatic extract denaturation. 

In Figure 6B can be observed the pH profile of Talf1 inulinase, where the optimum pH was 5.5. Thus, for 

further assays to determine the inulinase activity on Talf1 crude extracts, the best buffer for the reactions 

was considered the sodium citrate 50 mM buffer at pH 5.5.  

In Figure 6C is shown the effect of temperature on enzyme denaturation, which causes enzyme 

inactivation. The thermal stability of Talf1 enzymatic extract was performed at 30, 45 and 50 ºC (Figure 

6C). When the enzymatic extract was kept at 50 and 45 ºC, a complete inactivation occurred after 3 h and 

6 h, respectively. In contrast, when kept at 30 ºC, the enzymatic extract maintains 91% of the original 

activity after 3 days. The effect of pH (5.5, 7.5 and 10) on the enzyme activity stability was also studied at 

a temperature of 30 ºC (Figure 6D). The enzymatic extract showed reasonable stability at the original pH 

(5.5) retaining 57% of its original activity after 24 days when incubated at 30 ºC. However, the pH 

increase of the Talf1 crude extract to 7.5 and 10 influenced drastically the enzyme activity stability, 

remaining, after 3 days, only 10 and 2% of its original activity, respectively.  

Enzymes are influenced by many factors, such as temperature, pH and metal ions or co-factors 

affinity (Chi et al., 2009). From all potentially deactivating factors, temperature is the best studied. At 

elevated temperature many enzymes become (partly) unfolded and/or inactivated, meaning that they are 

no longer able to perform the desired tasks (Eijsink et al., 2005). The medium pH may also cause 

denaturation of the enzymatic structure, affecting the enzyme interaction with substrate and altering the 

activity levels. Therefore, is very important to determine the optimal conditions for enzymatic activity 

determination assay, by obtaining the activity profiles for temperature and pH.

A review by Kango and Jain (2011) describes several inulinases from molds, yeasts and bacteria with 

very similar features. In the molds’ group, the inulinases optimum pH and temperature ranges from 4 to 

6.5 and 25 - 40 ºC, respectively. The bacterial inulinases showed a higher pH and temperature range, 

from 6.5 to 7.5 and 37 - 50 ºC. The yeasts are the most studied group, and their inulinases optimum pH 

and temperature ranges from 3.5 to 8 and 28 - 36 ºC, respectively.  

The results of enzymatic activity are difficult to compare due to differences in the units used. Some 

authors described inulinases in Units per grams of dry substrate (U gds
-1

) and others in specific activity 

(U.mg
-1

). A high disparity is notice along different works: some reports suggest inulinase activities as high 

as 1 139 U/ml for a K. marxianus strain (Sguarezi et al., 2009), while others referred levels of 0.463 U/ml 

for a different strain of the same specie (Selvakumar and Pandey, 1999). 

Enzymatic stability, both to temperature and pH, is the most necessary feature for application of 

enzymes in bioprocesses (Mateo et al., 2007; Iyer and Ananthanarayan, 2008). In this context, the 

characteristics of Talf1 inulinases: optimum pH and temperature of 5.5 and 45 ºC, respectively, and the 

high stability at 30 ºC (maintaining 57% activity after 24 days at 30 ºC) are favorable for its further 

application in a SSF process of bioethanol production from inulin or inulin-rich materials.

3.5. Bioprocesses for bioethanol production 

3.5.1. Application of inulin or inulin-rich materials in bioprocesses  

Inulin is present in several plants as a reserve polymer and can be used as a carbon source for 

microbial growth if hydrolyzed into fermentable sugars. By the action of microbial inulinases a fructose 

rich syrup can be obtained from inulin or inulin-rich materials and further used for bioethanol production. 

3.5.1.1. Inulin fermentation in CBP and SSF 

Bioethanol production assays from inulin were performed by two bioprocesses: in a CBP and in a 

SSF approach. The results of these batch fermentations containing 200 g/l inulin, in the Inulin 

Fermentative Medium (IFM, see Appendix), are presented in Figure 7, while in Table 11 are summarized 

the most important metabolic parameters.

Talf1 crude enzymatic extract growth 

 

The CBP was carried out with the selected yeast strain Talf1, producer of inulinases, which had given 

positive results for inulin fermentation ability in the alcoholic fermentation screen. In Figure 7A is shown 

the growth, sugar consumption and ethanol production profiles during the batch fermentation of 200 g/l 

inulin, as sole carbon source. In this assay, strain Talf1 presented a growth rate (?max) of 0.14 h
-1

 and a 

maximum ethanol productivity of 1.70 g.l
-1

.h
-1

, achieving 67 g/l of ethanol directly from the inulin since it 

produced all the necessary enzymes (Table 11). An acid hydrolysis carried on the end samples of the 

process revealed a remaining 50 g/l of inulin (as glucose and fructose) in the CBP fermentative medium, 

which could be explained by the presence of long-chain inulin harder to enzymatic hydrolysis or due to 

low enzymatic efficiency. Therefore the ethanol yield obtained was 45%, quite close to the 51% of the 

theoretical ethanol yield (Dien et al., 2003). 

The SSF bioprocess for bioethanol production from 200 g/l of inulin (Figure 7B) was carried out using 

the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCMI 885 and supplementing the IFM with 5% (v/v) Talf1 crude 

enzymatic extract (with 8.7 U/ml of inulinase activity). In the presence of inulinases, the S. cerevisiae 

strain presented a similar growth rate to the isolated strain Talf1 (?max = 0.15 h
-1

), however achieved a 

higher ethanol production, 78 g/l (see Table 11), remaining yet 34 g/l of non hydrolyzed inulin in the 

fermentative medium. In these conditions, the maximum ethanol productivity was 2.75 g.l
-1

.h
-1

 and the 

ethanol yield was 47%. The ethanol production by S. cerevisiae corresponds to 92% of theoretical 

ethanol yield, which is 4% higher in comparison with that obtained by the yeast strain Talf1 in CBP. The 

yeast S. cerevisiae, contrary to strain Talf1, did not have to produce the enzymatic complex necessary to 

inulin hydrolysis because the inulinases were added to the fermentative medium, and thus achieved 

higher ethanol productivity. The quantity of enzyme added to the SSF process (5% v/v) was sufficient to 

prevent sugar limitation, because at the first 24 h of fermentation there was an accumulation of sugars in 

the broth, ready to be used (see Figure 7B).   

In order to access the influence of the Talf1 inulinases addition in the inulin fermentation ability by S. 

cerevisiae CCMI 885, a control growth was conducted without inulinases addition. In this assay, the S. 

cerevisiae strain was only able to produce 50 g/l of ethanol from the 200 g/l of inulin (Figure 7C). These 

results suggest that this strain was able to partially consume inulin, but not all, which has been previously 

reported to other Saccharomyces strains (Lim et al., 2011; Schorr-Galindo et al., 2000). This ability as 

been connected to the consumption of small size inulin molecules, with DP under 6, probably by action of 

an invertase with affinity for small D-fructo-furanosides. So, in SSF process, the Talf1 inulinases 



31 

hydrolyzed fibers which were not naturally used by the S. cerevisiae strain, leading to a bioethanol 

production increase, from 50 to 78 g/l (see Table 11). 

3.5.1.2. Jerusalem artichoke juice fermentation in CBP and SSF 

Jerusalem artichoke juice (JAJ), an inulin-rich complex material containing about 130 g/l of sugars 

(quantified by acid hydrolyses), was used as the only nutrients medium for bioethanol production in a 

CBP and a SSF process. The results of batch fermentations of JAJ are presented in Figure 8, and Table 

12 summarizes the most important metabolic parameters.

and S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 in Jerusalem artichoke juice without inulinases addition (C). 

For the CBP, the fermentation assays were conducted with the isolated yeast Talf1, and the results 

are shown in Figure 8A. The maximum growth rate achieved was 0.13 h
-1

 and the highest productivity 

measured was 3.62 g.l
-1

.h
-1

 (see Table 12). The maximum value of ethanol achieved by Talf1 strain was 

about 67 g/l of ethanol, and the acid hydrolysis of the end samples revealed no remaining sugars. 

Therefore, the calculated ethanol yield was 51% considering only the measurable sugars quantified, 

which corresponds to the theoretical ethanol yield.

 Talf1 crude enzymatic extract growth 

 

In SSF process, the fermentations of JAJ were conducted with S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 in the 

presence of 5% (v/v) Talf1 crude enzymatic extract (with 8.7 U/ml of inulinase activity), and the results 

obtained are presented in Figure 8B. In these conditions, the yeast S. cerevisiae strain presented a 

weaker growth rate (0.11 h
-1

) and a lower productivity (2.40 g.l.
-1

h
-1

) in comparison to Talf1 in the CBP 

(see Table 12). The maximum ethanol concentration attained was about 63 g/l, with no residual sugar. In 

overall, the S. cerevisiae strain was less efficient than the strain Talf1 for the bioethanol production from 

pure JAJ, achieving a maximum ethanol yield of 48%.  

In addition, to verify the ability of S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 to directly ferment the JAJ, a control 

fermentation assay with this S. cerevisiae strain in pure JAJ was conducted (see Figure 8C). The S. 

cerevisiae strain was able to produce 55 g/l of ethanol directly from this natural raw material. The 

maximum growth rate and ethanol productivity attained were 0.12 h
-1

 and 2.07 g.l
-1

.h
-1

, respectively (see 

Table 12). These results are consistent with those obtained in pure inulin fermentation, indicating once 

again the inability of S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 to utilize most carbon fibers present in JAJ as inulin, since 

the ethanol yield reached was 42%, substantially lower when compared to that obtained in the SSF 

process (see Table 12).  

The Talf1 enzymes supplementation to a SSF process with a known good ethanologenic strain (S. 

cerevisiae), even though it improved the bioethanol production yield from JAJ, it did not attained the same 

ethanol yield of the CBP approach with Talf1 (see Table 12). 

From the comparison between the two SSF processes conducted with Talf1 inulinases and the S. 

cerevisiae strain for bioethanol production from inulin (Figure 7B) and JAJ (Figure 8B), it can be observed 

that the bioprocess with pure inulin was more successful in terms of maximum ethanol produced (78.0 g/l 

versus 62.8 g/l for JAJ), however in terms of ethanol yield the value obtained was slightly lower (47% 

versus 48% for JAJ), due to the remaining non hydrolyzed inulin (34 g/l) in the fermentative broth at the 

end of the assay. The ethanol yields attained in both these SSF processes are higher than those previous 

described by other authors (Ohta et al., 1992). 

 The CBP bioprocess with Talf1 strain to obtain bioethanol was improved for ethanol yield when 

applied directly to the Jerusalem artichoke (JA) which attained the theoretical ethanol yield (51%). The 

best results obtained for JA fermentation were described using a S. cerevisiae strain in a SHF (Zhang et 

al., 2010) and a SSF (Nakamura et al., 1996), however, in this work, the CBP with the novel Talf1 yeast 

strain achieved higher ethanol yields. Other researchers also studied a CBP method using inulinase 

producing yeast like K. marxianus (Yuan et al., 2008b; Bajpai and Margaritis, 1986), but achieving lower 

ethanol concentrations or yields.  



33 

The direct fermentation of JA with a S. cerevisiae strain was assayed by Lim and colleagues (2011), 

but only 36 g/l of ethanol were produced. The S. cerevisiae CCMI 885 strain, used in this work, was able 

to produce 55 g/l of ethanol, which may be explained by raw material differences in nutrients content 

and/or indicates the ability of this strain to efficiently use some inulin molecules. 

3.5.2. Strawberry tree fruit’ juice as Fermentation Medium 

Batch fermentation assays, using strawberry tree fruit’ juice (STFJ) as sole nutrients source, were 

conducted using four novel yeast strains isolated from strawberry tree fruit (STF), namely AP1, DP2, 

GerP3 and GluP4, and a known highly ethanologenic yeast strain, S. cerevisiae CCMI 885. The results of 

the batch fermentations of STFJ are presented in Figure 9, and in Table 13 are summarized the most 

important metabolic parameters.  

These results indicate that the best ethanol producing yeast was the S. cerevisiae strain CCMI 885 

(see Figure 9E), which achieved the highest ethanol concentration (about 108 g/l), productivity (1.29     

g.l
-1

.h
-1

) and yield (51%, the theoretical yield for ethanol production) (see Table 13). The isolate GerP3, a 

putative Z. bailii strain, achieved the second best series of results. It was able to produce 100 g/l of 

bioethanol (see Figure 9C), with a productivity of 1.11 g.l.
-1

.h
-1

 and an ethanol yield of 50%, due to the 

remaining 7 g/l of free sugars in the fermentation broth at the end of the assay. The STFJ fermentations 

with the yeasts DP2 and GluP4 (Figure 9B and 9D), two putative S. cerevisiae strains, resulted in lower 

ethanol yield, caused by lower ethanol concentration produced, about 95 and 92 g/l, respectively (see 

Table 13), with a remaining sugar content of 13 g/l on the fermentation broth for both strains.

concentration produced by this strain was 86 g/l with a remaining sugar content of 25 g/l (see Figure 9A), 

resulting in an ethanol yield of 47%. 

The STFJ was characterized by HPLC for its sugar content, showing a high soluble sugar 

concentration, 209 g/l, most of which fructose (157 g/l) and the rest glucose (52 g/l). STFJ is a complex 

raw material, presenting most of the necessary nutrients for microbial growth, contributing for a total 

sugar conversion into ethanol within a fermentation process.

4. Conclusions  

The main goal of this work was to search for novel microbial strains, in special new yeasts, with high 

potential to produce bioethanol, due to either the presence of better ethanologenic characteristics (e. g. 

high tolerance to ethanol, and extremes pH and/or temperature) or the production of relevant hydrolytic 

enzymatic machinery, which can be competitive in further application for industrial bioprocesses. In this 

context, an isolation of novel microorganisms was carried out from different materials rich in fermentable 

sugars or polysaccharides (inulin), followed by a screening for their ability to produce relevant enzymes 

and/or alcoholic fermentation. 

A total of 98 microbial isolates were collected, from which 7 yeasts strains were selected based on 

their promising features observed: all strains had potential to bioethanol production and three present the 

ability to produce inulinases, important enzymes to apply in bioprocesses using inulin or inulin-rich 

materials.  

A preliminary molecular identification, using oligonucleotide FITC marked probes by FISH, gave a 

putative identification for the selected isolates, separating them in three species: L. thermotolerans (AP1), 

S. cerevisiae (GluP4 and DP2) and Z. bailii (GerP3, Calf2, Talf1 and Talf2). These results must be further 

concluded with more classical and molecular standard identification methods, as morphological 

description, carbon and nitrogen fermentation and assimilation capacity and genetic sequencing for the 

identification validation.  

In order to use inulin or inulin-rich materials as a carbon source for bioprocesses, they must be 

hydrolyzed either chemically (acid pre-treatment) or enzymatically (through inulinases). The pre-treatment 

of raw substrates in an industrial scale represents a substantial cost increase, which means that the 

application of inulinases or the use of an ethanologenic and inulinase producer to the process to obtain 

bioethanol could be an advantage, contributing to a less expensive bioprocess. Hence, in this work the 

Talf1 strain was selected as the best inulinase producer, and both the optimization of the inulinase 

production as well as its characterization were carried out. Talf1 crude extract activity attained the 

maximum values (8.7 U/ml) at the optimal pH and temperature, 5.5 and 45 ºC, respectively, and its 

stability is high at 30ºC (the enzyme presents &gt; 50% activity after 24 days at 30 ºC), which are promising 

characteristics for its further application for bioethanol bioprocesses.  

The assays carried out with inulin (IFM) in a SSF process, using S. cerevisiae strain CCMI 885 and 

Talf1 inulinases, attained higher ethanol production (78 g/l) than the CBP assay (67 g/l), while the 

fermentation assays with the Jerusalem artichoke juice attained better results in CBP, using the Talf1 

strain. These results show the enormous potential of inulin and inulin rich raw materials, as Jerusalem 

artichoke, as substrates for bioethanol production. Further optimization and scale-up analysis is required 

using these novel isolated yeast strains.  

Moreover, batch fermentations directly from strawberry tree fruit’ juice (a complex raw material 

composed by high sugar content and the nutrients required for microbial growth) were carried out using 

the 4 selected strains isolated from strawberry tree fruits. In overall, the 4 yeast strains tested gave 

satisfactory results for bioethanol production from strawberry tree fruit’ juice fermentation, with yields 

ranging from 47 to 50%. However, the GerP3 strain, a putative Z. bailii, achieved the most promising 

results for its further application in a solid state fermentation directly from strawberry tree fruit, as 



36 

performed at industrial scale for the production of an economically important distilled drink from this 

material. 

The development of efficient and economically viable bioethanol production processes is crucial in 

today’s society, due to worldwide fuel depletion and increasing energetic requirements. The utilization of 

raw materials, such as Jerusalem artichoke and strawberry tree fruit, for bioethanol production could help 

to reduce the energy dependence of fossil fuel. Optimization studies of the processes with these natural 

raw materials must be carried out for further application at industrial scale.
