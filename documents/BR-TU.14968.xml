ABSTRACT
Purpose: To investigate the effectiveness of fibrin glue (laparoscopic via) into promote the hemostasis of a spleen injury on a heparinized 
porcine model. Methods: Eighteen Landrace porcine were submitted to laparoscopic spleen injury and randomly distributed: GHA 
(heparin plus adhesive), GH (heparin without adhesive) and GS (Sham - without heparin or adhesive). Ten minutes before the surgical 
procedures a single IV dose (200UI/kg) of heparin sodium was administrated only to groups GHA and GH. In the GHA, adhesive was 
applied after the mechanical injury and recorded the time until the polymerization and clot formation. Results: No significant differences 
occurred among the groups (Fisher test) considering the weight and surgery time. The blood amount in the abdominal cavity on GH was 
significantly higher in comparison to the sham group and especially with the GHA (p&lt;0.004). No significant differences were observed 
in the body temperature, heart rate, cardiac output, means arterial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure during the experiment. The 
activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was lower in the GHA in comparison to GH (p&lt;0.003). Conclusion: The fibrin biological 
adhesive applied by laparoscopy is effective for hemostasis of minor spleen injury in a porcine model under the effect of anticoagulant 
drug.

Introduction 

The spleen is currently injured in the abdominal trauma, 
but was well know the relationship between splenectomy and 
increased occurrence of infections1. 

Thereafter, several surgical procedures to preserve the 
injured spleen were proposed, most of them using the laparotomy 
via, using surgical sutures and ligatures to the vascular pedicle and 
other topic haemostatic maneuvers. However, these procedures 
involved the use of surgical thread or foam that acting as foreign 
bodies and promote local inflammatory reaction and hinders the 
healing process1. Furthermore, the sutures are difficult by the soft 
and friable consistency of spleen parenchyma.

The treatment of these injuries with biological adhesive 
seems to be advantageous to avoid the use of sutures or foam, 
the compound is completely absorbed in a few days2 and is not 
associated to foreign body granuloma3.

The biological adhesive of fibrin allowed a new approach 
to the bleeding spleen trauma, initially by laparotomy4, and 
recently by laparoscopic via5. The polymerization of the adhesive is 
effective independently of the integrity of the coagulation cascade 
or the platelets count, and this may be an advantage in patients 
with coagulopathy diseases or under the effect of anticoagulant 
drugs6,7.

Our purpose is verifying the effectiveness of fibrin glue, 
used by laparoscopic via, in comparison to the conventional suture 
into promote the hemostasis of a standard spleen injury on a 
heparinized experimental porcine model.

Methods 

The experimental protocol (#1364/07) was approved 
by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Sao Paulo 
(UNIFESP), Brazil. The pigs were maintained according to the 
norms of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 
(Institute for Laboratory Animal Research, 1996) and to the ethical 
principles of the Brazilian Committee on Animal Experimentation 
(COBEA).

Eighteen Landrace pigs, males, six months old, weighing 
14 to 19.5kg each were housed in temperature - and light-
controlled environmental conditions with a 12-hour light-dark 
cycle, and given free access to water and standard pellet chow until 
6 hours prior the surgical procedures. All procedures were done in 
the laboratories of Experimental Surgery, Department of Surgery 
(UNIFESP). The animals were submitted to laparoscopic standard 
spleen injury and randomly distributed in three groups (n=6): 

GHA (heparin plus adhesive), GH (heparin without adhesive) and 
GS (Sham - without heparin or adhesive).

After six hours fasting for solid diet and four hours for 
liquid diet, the animals received intramuscularly 0.2mg/kg of 
acepromazin and 0.75mg/kg of midazolan. Ten minutes later, 
they received 10mg/kg intravenously of sodium thiopental. The 
anesthesia was maintained by endotracheal probe (Rush 7) with 
oxygen and 1% halothane. Ringer lactate was administrated 
intravenously at rate of 500ml/hour.

 A left cervical incision allowed inserting a 6F catheter in 
the left carotid artery for measures of mean arterial pressure (MAP) 
and heart rate (HR) using Phillips Viridia 4C device (Phillips 
Healthcare). A Swan-Ganz catheter (Edwards Lifesciences LLC 
- Irvine, CA USA), was inserted in the internal jugular vein 
and guided to the pulmonary artery for monitoring the body 
temperature (T), the pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and cardiac 
output (CD). Vascular blood samples were collected to determine 
the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT).

Ten minutes before the beginning of the surgical 
procedures a single dose (200UI/kg) of heparin sodium, was 
intravenously administrated in the animals of groups GHA and 
GH. The animals of GS were not heparinized.

Under aseptic conditions the laparoscopic standard 
procedure was performed in the animals of all groups. A 
Veress needle was inserted in the umbilical region and the 
pneumoperitoneum was setting up a pressure of 12 mm Hg. The 
needle was withdrawn and inserted into this place a 10mm trocar 
and the 30° optical set. 

Six centimeters from the abdominal middle line and three 
centimeters below the left costal margin a second trocar (10mm) 
was inserted and used to make way for the mechanical device 
specially designed (Figure 1) to produce a standardized circular 
injury half centimeter in diameter and one and half centimeter 
deep in the spleen parenchyma. It consisted of a core of round 
surgical steel with pointed end that was triggered by an internal 
spring. To arm the device was pulled to the upper end of inner rod 
until the point of locking. The release of the trigger attached to the 
outer end was enough to push the steel blade with standard power 
toward and then producing the spleen injury.

The laparoscopy splenic injury repair. The use of fibrin glue in a heparinized porcine model

A third trocar (5mm) was introduced ten centimeters from 
the left of the midline and ten centimeters below the left costal 
margin by which introduces a forceps (grasper). The purpose of 
this clamp was to improve the visualization of the spleen in order 
to perform the spleen injury. 

Only in the animals of GHA a fourth trocar (5mm) was 
inserted three centimeter from the middle line and five centimeters 
below the left costal margin to allowed the passage of double-
lumen cannula in which were attached two syringes (Figure 2). 
The syringe A (0.5mL) contained a mixture of fibrinogen, aprotinin 
and factor XIII, and syringe B (0.5mL) a mixture of thrombin 
and calcium chloride. The biological adhesive was composed of 
fibrinogen (65-115mg/mL), factor XIII (40-80 U/mL), aprotinin 
(1000 UIC/mL), thrombin (400-600 IU/mL) and calcium chloride 
(5.88mg/0.5mL). It was preserved at 4 degrees centigrade, being 
brought to room temperature for 30 minutes before its application 
in spleen injury. Fibrin glue was applied immediately after 
the mechanical injury and recorded the time elapsed until the 
polymerization and clot formation. 

FIGURE 2 - The double-lumen cannula in which was attached two 
syringes with the two components of fibrin glue.

The time of the procedure was recorded from the 
introduction of the first trocar until the end of laparotomy 
procedure.

The animals were monitoring during 20 minutes 
immediately after the spleen injury (T0), ten minutes (T10) and 20 
minutes (T20) after the injury. It were recording the mean arterial 
pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), body temperature (T), pulmonary 
artery pressure (PAP) and activated partial thromboplastin time 
(APTT).

After T20 was performed medium laparotomy in animals 
of all groups. To estimate the blood loss during the period of 
twenty minutes of observation, the amount of blood collected in 
the abdominal cavity was carefully drained with dry gauze. For 
each gram of the weight (difference between dry and wet weight 
of the gauze) was considered as the loss of a milliliter of blood.

The gross aspects of spleen injury and the fibrin clot was 
evaluated and photographed. The spleen was collected for further 
microscopic study.

The animals were euthanized by the administration of 
10mL of potassium chloride intravenously. 

For light microscopy samples involving the injury and 
peripheral area were fixed in 10% formalin, immersed in paraffin, 
and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE). Histological evaluations 
were performed with light microscope (Axiolab Standard 2.0, Carl 
Zeiss) in magnification of 10X, 100X and 200X.

For data analysis, it was used the statistical software 
SPSS version 15.0 for Windows. The p&lt;0.05 or 5% was 
considered statistically significant. The descriptive analysis 
of continuous variables was described by mean and standard 
deviation. Categorical variables were described in a contingency 
table containing the frequency and percentage of occurrences in 
each group and time. For the inferential analysis were applied the 
following nonparametric statistical tests: Kruskal-Wallis test to 
verify the hypothesis of equality between the three groups; Mann-
Whitney, to check the equality of groups 2 to 2, when applied, 
using the Kruskal-Wallis test, it appears that the 3 groups were not 
equal; Friedman test, when it wanted to verify the hypothesis that 
the results of each animal did not change at any time (3 or more 
repeated measures); Wilcoxon test to verify the equal time 2 to 2, 
when applied, using the Friedman test, it appears that the 3 times 
were not all alike;  Fisher’s generalized test: suitable for frequency 
tables, with which it tested the hypothesis that the observed 
frequencies in the categories were distributed evenly between the 
groups.

Discussion

Our data has support for the idea that fibrin glue is 
effective in promoting the repair of a spleen injury in an animal 
under effect of anticoagulant substance. This was evident by the 
significantly smaller amount of blood collected in the abdominal 
cavity in the animals in which the injury was treated with the 
adhesive in comparison to the group that did not receive any 
treatment.

The treatment of spleen injury is a challenge even 
in patients without any coagulation disorder. In patients using 
anticoagulant or thrombolytic therapy, the literature advocates the 
reversal of anticoagulation followed by emergency splenectomy8.

Fibrin clot

Since the demonstration of the importance spleen 
parenchyma to the immunological integrity of the individual, 
surgical treatment tries to be as conservative as possible while 
preserving as much spleen tissue as possible1.

Laparoscopy has brought an important step in reducing 
time and trauma surgery, but the suture of the lesion or its packing 
with haemostatic foam are still not free from technical difficulties 
or unsatisfactory results9. The surgical adhesive fibrin proved to a 
viable option for making the operative time less and serves as an 
alternative to suture or foam materials10. 

Aiming to test the effects of the association of adhesive 
application through laparoscopy approach in an animal under 
the action of anticoagulant drug we use a model in medium-size 
animal like the pig. The morphology aspect of the porcine spleen 
is similar to the human being as a reliable model. The sample was 
homogenous since all animals were male and had body weight 
equivalent (Table 1).

Among the surgical adhesive available fibrin glue was 
chosen because it does not produce exothermic reaction during the 
polymerization process, be reabsorbed by the organism without 
foreign body granulomas formation and stimulates the healing 
process.

Fibrin glue is results from the action of thrombin on 
fibrinogen, a reproduction of the last stage of blood coagulation. 
The reaction is mediated by calcium, and initially forms a soluble 
and unstable fibrin monomer. With the addition of coagulation 
factor XIII and aprotinin (a protease bovine inhibitor) it became 
a insoluble and stable polymer11. The clot formed quickly, about 
1 to 4 seconds and adheres firmly to the point of injury by cross-
linking of fibrin with collagen, serum glycoprotein and plasmatic 
cells3. In 10 minutes the clot gets 70% of its strength tensile3. Our 
results showed that the fibrin clot had a stable aspect from 3 a 
5 seconds. The photomicrography showed the presence of clot 
within the lesion in four animals and was only on the surface in 
two other animals, without directly influence the amount of blood 
collected (Figure 4).

The two components of the adhesive are mixed at room 
temperature and inserted through the double lumen cannula. Thus, 
for the animals of GHA the elapsed time was slightly longer, but 
not significantly from to other two groups (Table 1). 

No significantly body temperature was recorded 
(Table 2), except a mild decrease on T20 in the GHA, although 
no attempt was made to keep the temperature of the animals at 
37°C. It is well known that the blood clot formation is delayed 
when the temperature is below 37°C12, as result of inhibition 
of enzymatic reactions of the coagulation cascade induced by 

hypothermia13. The body temperatures in all groups were lower of 
37°C, probably due to anesthesia procedures and surgical trauma. 
Despite the initial temperature be less than 37°C there was no 
significant difference throughout the period of observation (T0, 
T10 and T20). We consider that mild hypothermia (GHA /T20) as 
favorable to our model, since there is report that APTT is increased 
in these situations14. Thus, in addition to the bleeding disorder due 
to heparin also had hypothermia acting as facilitating factor in 
the bleeding of spleen injury. Despite hypothermia, fibrin clotted 
quickly and was effective in producing stop the bleeding.

The device especially designs for promote a standard 
trauma caused a minor injury in the spleen parenchyma with a 
mild blood loss. The blood loss estimated in the animals of GH 
was three times higher than that of animals which was treated 
with fibrin and two times higher than the control group who did 
not use the heparin (Table 1). A blood loss, perhaps by short-term 
observation, was not enough to cause significant hemodynamic 
disorders. The cardiac rate, means arterial pressure, pulmonary 
artery pressure showed no significantly differences in either 
heeding three times (T0, T10 and T20) in each group or even in 
groups with each other (Tables 3, 5 and 6). The cardiac output 
(Table 4) had a slight decrease at T10 and T20 in relation to the 
initial time (T0) in groups with heparin and the control group. In 
animals that received the fibrin the blood loss was lower and, as 
expected, there was no change in the cardiac output.

The effectiveness of heparin was confirmed by the 
determination of APTT which is commonly used for their 
sensitivity and accuracy (Figure 3). In this study it was found that 
the dose of heparin used (200 U/kg) was sufficient to produce an 
anticoagulant effect in animals of Groups HA and H.

Moreover, the model has some limitations that should be 
explored in further research. The degree of splenic injury should 
be applied to produce more severe injuries; the patch should 
be applied more deeply in the wound; hypothermia should be 
investigated to determine their actual influence on the results; more 
severe injuries may cause more severe hemodynamic changes that 
may influence the clotting ability of the adhesive.

This research opens the possibility of using fibrin glue 
as an option for conservative treatment of minor splenic injuries 
in patient with coagulopathy or under the effect of anticoagulant 
drugs, avoiding the conventional surgical approach of open 
laparotomy and the use of sutures or sponges.
