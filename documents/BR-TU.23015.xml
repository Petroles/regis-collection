A structural model of the 
Fábrica Nova region, Santa 
Rita syncline, Quadrilátero 
Ferrífero: flanking folds as a 
folding mechanism

Modelo estrutural da região de Fábrica Nova, 
Sinclinal Santa Rita, Quadrilátero Ferrífero: 
mecanismo de dobramento por flanking folds
Abstract

 This study focuses on the eastern flank of the Santa Rita syncline (Dorr 1969), 
with specific emphasis on the region known as Fábrica Nova. Important iron ore de-
posits are located on the flanks of this structure, such as Timbopeba, Alegria, São 
Luiz, Tamanduá, Almas and Fábrica Nova. The Santa Rita syncline is a fold with 
N-S axial direction and of subregional scale, with roots in the adjacent basement of 
the Santa Bárbara Complex and sectioned by the Água Quente thrust fault. The hy-
pothesis of this study is that the structural framework of the region resulted from 
the superposition of at least three deformation phases on the Ouro Preto nappe. The 
Fábrica Nova mine, located in the central portion of the study area, is embedded in a 
synformal structure with a 100/20 trending axis named Fábrica Nova synform. The 
proposed model to explain the particular structural geometry of this region is based 
on the flanking folding mechanism (Passchier 2001). This mechanism may have been 
developed by E-W crustal shortening during the F

4
 tectonic deformation phase.

Resumo

 O presente trabalho se concentra na aba leste do sinclinal Santa Rita, (Dorr 
1969), a partir da região conhecida como Fábrica Nova. Importantes depósitos de 
minérios de ferro estão localizados nos flancos dessa estrutura, como os de Timbope-
ba, Alegria, São Luiz, Tamanduá, Almas e Fábrica Nova. Esse sinclinal é uma dobra 
de escala sub-regional de direção axial N-S com raízes no embasamento adjacente 
do Complexo Santa Bárbara e seccionada pela falha de Água Quente. A investigação 
propõe a hipótese de que o arcabouço estrutural da região é resultante da superpo-
sição de pelo menos três fases de deformação sobre a nappe Ouro Preto. A mina de 
Fábrica Nova, localizada na porção central da área estudada, está inserida em uma 
estrutura sinformal de eixo 100/20, o sinforme de Fábrica Nova. Para a geometria 
particular dessa região, é proposto um modelo com base no mecanismo de dobra-
mento por Flanking Folds (Passchier 2001). Esse mecanismo se daria através de um 
encurtamento crustal de direção E-W da fase de deformação F

A structural model of the Fábrica Nova region, Santa Rita syncline, Quadrilátero Ferrífero: flanking folds as a folding mechanism

REM: R. Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 68(2), 153-162, apr. jun. | 2015

1. Introduction

 The area of this study is located 
along the eastern edge of the Quadri-
látero Ferrífero (QFe) (Dorr 1969) in 
the central portion of Minas Gerais 
state between the districts of Santa Rita 
Durão and Bento Rodrigues in a region 
known as Fábrica Nova (Fig. 1).

In general, the QFe is comprised of 
three major sets of rock units: the meta-
morphic complexes of Archean age, the 
metavolcanic-metassedimentary rock-
type sequence of the greenstone-belt of 

Archean age, corresponding to the Rio 
das Velhas Supergroup, and the Paleo-
proterozoic supracrustal rocks of the 
Minas Supergroup and Itacolomi Group 
(e.g. Dorr et al. 1957, Dorr 1969, Cor-
dani et al. 1980, Schorscher et al. 1982, 
Romano 1989, Noce 1995, Machado et 
al. 1996, Alkmim &amp;amp; Marshak 1998).

 The regional structure of the 
QFe is the result of the superposition 
of two main tectonic events (Chemale 
Jr. et al. 1991), namely the Transama-

zonian (2.1 – 2.0 Ga) and Brasiliano 
(0.8 – 0.6 Ga) orogenies. The first 
event produced the regional recum-
bent synclines and anticlines on the 
supracrustal rocks and the uplifting 
of gneissic-granite rocks arranged in 
structures like a nappe (Almeida 2004, 
Endo et al. 2005), and the second 
caused the inversion, amplification, 
translation and crustal rotation of the 
synclines and anticlines around the 
dome structures.

(model by Dorr 1969, Romano 1989, 
Endo 1997, Almeida 2004, Endo et al. 
2004, Endo et al. 2005).

 The eastern edge of the QFe repre-
sents the border between the São Fran-
cisco craton and the Araçuaí Belt (e.g., 
Alkmim et al. 2006), and its structure 
is conditioned by the Fundão-Cambotas 
(Endo &amp;amp; Fonseca 1992) and Água Quente 
thrust fault systems (Maxwell 1972, Fer-
reira Fº. 1999). The Santa Rita syncline 
(Fig. 1) is located within this system and, 
according to Dorr (1969) and Maxwell 
(1972), it is characterized as an asymmet-
ric synform with a N-NE and N-S trend-
ing axis; it is open in the southern section 
and narrow in the northern section, with 
a subhorizontal plunge. The flanks are 
subparallels, and the overturned flank is 
sectioned by the Água Quente fault, which 
is of submeridian trace. The stratigraphic 
units on the overturned flank are thin-

ner than its normal counterpart flank 
located to the west. Schists, phyllites, and 
ferruginous quartzites belonging to the 
Piracicaba and Sabará groups are present 
in the core.

 Dorr (1969) argued that mesoscopic 
fold axes show subhorizontal plunge with 
axial trace parallel to the bedding direc-
tion in contrast. In turn Endo (1997) de-
scribed fold axes with moderate plunging 
around 45º toward the E-SE. At the hinge 
of the Santa Rita syncline, the bedding 
shows steep dipping to the E bisected by 
penetrative regional schistosity, with an 
intersection lineation parallel to the corre-
sponding mineral and stretching lineation 
plunging toward the E-SE (e.g. Ferreira Fº. 
1999, Ferreira Fº. &amp;amp; Fonseca 2001). This 
relationship between the linear fabrics 

predominates in the QFe region (Chemale 
Jr. et al. 1991, Alves 1991, Alkmim &amp;amp; 
Marshak 1998, Franco 2003, Almeida 
2004, Endo 1997, Endo et al. 2005).

According to the models of Dorr 
(1969) and Maxwell (1972), the correct 
position of the Santa Rita syncline hinge 
has not been determined so far. Contem-
porary structures such as the Gandarela 
and Ouro Fino synclines, have hinges with 
E-SE plunges parallel to the intersection 
and mineral stretching lineations at ap-
proximately 100/45 (Franco 2003, Endo 
et al. 2004). The bedding trace contour 
of the Minas Supergroup units of the 
Fábrica Nova region seems to indicate a 
“Z” type folding geometry (Fig. 3). If this 
hypothesis is correct, the syncline closure 
should occur in its southern section.

district and Caraça region (Vale file).

2. Materials and Methods

This study was conducted in two 
phases. The first phase involved regional 
lithostructural mapping on a 1:5.000 
scale, and the second stage included 
detailed mapping of the northern and 
southern pits of the Fábrica Nova 
mine (Fig. 2) on a 1:2.000 scale. The 
lithostratigraphic and structural data 

collected from this semi-detailed geologi-
cal map enabled the proposal of a geo-
logical model for the Santa Rita syncline, 
especially with regard to the geometry of 
the Fábrica Nova region. The structural 
data collected during the mapping were 
launched in stereograms using GEOrient 
(v. 9.0) software. 

Based on structural criteria pro-
posed by Harland (1956), Hansen 
(1971), Robertson (1994), Hsue (1995), 
and Xypolias (2010), the study area was 
divided into two structural domains ac-
cording to their structural styles, geom-
etry, and fabric properties: eastern and 
western (Fig. 3).

3. Results

The structural analysis was based 
on the structural framework from dif-

ferent observation scales (e.g. Williams 
1985, Xypolias 2010). To better describe 

the structures, they were arranged into 
mesoscopic and macroscopic categories.

Mesoscopic Structures
Bedding

The bedding was defined by the 
variation in the particle size of the quartz 
grains in the quartzites of the Moeda 
and Cercadinho formations and the 
Sabará Group as well as the alternating 
laminae rich in quartz and the hematite-
magnetite-goethite in the itabirite of the 
Cauê Formation. 

The bedding planes of quartzites of 
the Sabará Group in the eastern domain 
shows a NW-SE direction and dipping 
toward to NE at 056/54 (Fig. 6a). The bed-
ding in the western domain was preserved 
in all of the units of the Minas Supergroup 
with a preferential NW-SE direction at the 
south and an E-W direction at the north of 

the domain, with a maximum of approxi-
mately 172/48 (Fig. 6b). The dispersion of 
the bedding orientation suggests the acting 
of the F4 folding phase with an axial trend 
at approximately 117/33. This fold, named 
Fábrica Nova synform, is characterized as 
an open, subcylindrical and asymmetric 
fold with plunge.

Structures of the First Deformation Phase (F
1
)

The structures that reflect this 
phase are represented by tight and asym-
metric mesofolds, most likely associated 
with an S1 foliation oblique to the bed-
ding. The rare asymmetric folds, relicts 
of this phase, have a “Z” pattern. In one 
of the few outcrops where the structures 
of this deformation phase were found, 

the bedding and S1 foliation relationship 
observed presents a clockwise vorticity 
in a “Z” pattern, which are preserved 
in the sericitic schist. In the silvery phyl-
lite layer, the bedding and S

2
 foliation 

relationship exhibits a counterclockwise 
vorticity in an “S” pattern. The interfer-
ence relationship is characterized by the 

superposition of the S
2
 regional schistos-

ity folding the S
1
 foliation with the same 

vorticity pattern as the F
2
 deformation 

phase (Fig. 4). 
However, the original characteris-

tics of this fabric were mostly obliterated 
by the subsequent deformation phases in 
most of the studied region.

from the Cercadinho Formation at a me-
soscopic scale showing the superposition 
of two deformation phases represented 
by the S1 and S2 foliations with opposite 
vorticities. Plane view XZ strain axes.

Structures of the Second Deformation Phase (F
2
)

The S
2
 regional schistosity is a pen-

etrative planar fabric characterized by the 
preferential orientation of minerals such as 
sericite (Fig. 5a), hematite, and quartz. In 
the eastern domain, the S

2
 schistosity has 

an attitude of approximately 066/55 (Fig. 
6c). In the western domain, the arrange-

ment of the mapped units clearly expresses 
a folded system in which the S

2
 schistos-

ity shows an attitude of approximately 
082/43 (Fig. 6d). The attitude of the axis 
of this fold (B

4
) is 104/40. The F2 folds, 

which have been mostly mapped in the 
Fábrica Nova mine, are tight folds with 

an axis plunging slightly to the ESE and a 
major attitude of approximately 119/21 in 
the northern pit (subdomain IIa; Fig. 6e) 
and 093/17 in the southern pit (subdomain 
IIb; Fig. 6f). These folds are asymmetric 
with “S” patterns, furthermore, they have 
wavelengths and amplitudes on the order 

The structural asymmetry and the 
vorticity were characterized according 
to the down-plunging view of the fold 
axis or the intersection lineation (Pass-
chier &amp;amp; Williams 1996, Xypolias 2009 
and 2010). The characteristics of each 
domain are as follows:

The eastern domain encompasses 
the units of the Sabará Group (e.g. Gair 
1958, Barbosa 1968, Renger et al. 1994, 
Almeida 2004, Almeida et al. 2005) 

and the Santa Bárbara Complex (Dorr 
1969, Herz 1970). The structural data 
obtained in this field suggests that the 
rocks of these units are folded as to 
form an antiform F

2
 with axis plunging 

toward to ESE.
The Minas Supergroup (Dorr 

1969) units comprise the western do-
main on an overturned stratigraphic 
position. The outline of these units 
forms a structure that resembles a 

boomerang geometry and a “Z” fold-
ing pattern associated with a clockwise 
vorticity. The Bento Rodrigues fault 
determines the boundary between these 
two structural domains.

Due to structural characteristics 
the western domain can be divided into 
two subdomains: IIa and IIb, which cor-
respond to the northern and southern 
pits, respectively, of the Fábrica Nova 
mine (Fig. 3).

T he struc t u ral framework of 
phase F

 consists of open folds with an 

E-W axis featuring wavelengths and 
amplitudes of decametric dimensions 
that primarily outcrop in the Fábrica 
Nova mine.

The S
3
 foliation is a disjunctive 

cleavage of the E-W direction and the 
subvertical plunges that dips or to the 

north or to the south with an attitude 
of approximately 018/80 (Fig. 7a) and 
are attributed to the third deforma-
tion phase. The open F

3
 mesofolds or 

undulations of the bedding that show 
an axis with moderate plunging to the 
ENE and kink folds with an axial plane 
that dips to the south are also attributed 
to this phase. Among the structures of 

this phase, a mesofold occurring in the 
western portion of the Fábrica Nova 
northern pit stands out. This fold is an 
open antiform with a wavelength of ap-
proximately 200 meters and an ampli-
tude of a few tens of a meter whose axis 
exhibits an attitude of 081/43 (Fig. 7b). 
The core of this fold is formed by silvery 
phyllites of the Cercadinho Formation.

Structures of the Fourth Deformation Phase (F
4
)

The F4 deformation phase was re-
sponsible for the final arrangement of the 
Fábrica Nova region, and its manifesta-
tion is represented in the Fábrica Nova 
synform, a fold with an ESE plunging 

axis and a boomerang-like geometry in 
plain view. The structures of this phase 
are primarily represented by S

4
 crenula-

tion cleavages observed in itabirites of 
the Cauê Formation and in schists of the 

Sabará Group. The general direction of the 
S

4
 cleavage is N-S with an average attitude 

of 280/72 (Fig. 7c). Tight folds with steep 
axial plane and N-S trending axis are also 
attributed to this deformation phase.

Structures of the Fifth Deformation Phase (F
5
)

The records of the fracture system 
in the Fábrica Nova mine demonstrate 

the occurrence of two preferential direc-
tions, orthogonal to each other. These 

directions are N10-20E and N80-90 W 
(Fig. 7d).

of a few meters (Fig. 5b). A box-fold pat-
tern can be observed in subdomain IIa 
and is interpreted as the manifestation of 
the superposition of the F

2
 folds over the 

F1 folds with opposite vorticities. The “S” 
folds in this system are better preserved 
than the “Z” folds, attesting to the super-

position of the deformation phases. The 
intersection between the S

0
 bedding planes 

and the S
2
 schistosity is the predominant 

fabric in the itabirites of the Fábrica Nova 
mine. This structure shows moderate 
plunging to the ESE with average attitudes 
of approximately 094/22 (Fig. 6g). The 

mineral lineation, characterized by the 
preferential orientation of the mica and 
hematite crystals, shows an orientation 
parallel to the L

Macroscopic Structures
Bento Rodrigues Fault: General Aspects and Kinematics

The major fault of the Fábrica 
Nova region, hereaf ter called the 
Bento Rodrigues fault, bisects the en-
tire mapped area, from south of Bento 
Rodrigues village, crossing the border 
east of the Fábrica Nova mine to north 
until Santa Rita Durão village. In the 
southern portion of the map, west of 
Bento Rodrigues, the fault trace has 
an NNW-SSE direction. In the central 
portion, near the Fábrica Nova mine, 
the fault trace changes its orientation 

to E-W, bearing toward NNE-SSW in 
the northern portion of the mapped 
area. This structure is related to the F

2
 

deformation phase, which corresponds 
to the development of the S

2
 regional 

schistosity and the apparent thrust of 
the Santa Bárbara Complex over the 
Minas Supergroup.

Unlike what was proposed by Dorr 
(1969), Maxwell (1972), Chemale Jr. 
et al. (1991), and Ferreira Fº (1999), 
the fault kinematics seems to be essen-

tially of a dextral strike-slip character 
with a small reverse component. The 
fault trajectory shows a deflection to 
the left relative to the bedding trace, 
thereby providing an extension of the 
layer that results in the generation of 
an extensional megaboudin structure. 
These mine-scale tectonics lead to the 
thinning and disappearance of the units 
from the Moeda and Batatal formations 
in the frontal portion of the Fábrica 
Nova mine pit.

Folds and Folding: Geometry and Relationships
Two subregional-scale folds occur 

in the Fábrica Nova region: the Fábrica 
Nova synform from the F

4
 deformation 

phase and the Bento Rodrigues anticline 
(Fig. 8). In addition, a tight antiform in 
the eastern section of the northern pit of 
the Fábrica Nova mine exists, known as 
the Alto Pai Miguel antiform. The axial-
plane foliations that might be geneti-
cally associated with these folds were 
not clearly or convincingly observed.

The Fábrica Nova synform is 
an open fold a few kilometers in size, 
characterized by the rotation of the 
primary structures and tectonic folia-
tions located in the northern pit of the 
Fábrica Nova mine (subdomain IIa) 
and its surroundings (Fig. 8). Only the 
stratigraphic units of the Minas Super-

group are involved in this fold. The axis 
of this fold has a moderate plunge to 
E-SE. The western flank in the south-
ern portion has bedding attitudes of 
approximately 080/20, reaching values 
of 107/36 in the western portion of the 
northern pit domain and 200/60 in the 
northern portion. 

The Bento Rodrigues anticline 
is a reclined fold a few kilometers in 
size, composed by the gneisses of the 
Santa Bárbara Complex followed by 
the quartzites and schists of the Sabará 
Group (Fig. 8). On the eastern flank, 
which represents the normal strati-
graphic succession, the bedding and S

2
 

foliation relationship shows counter-
clockwise vorticity and “S” asymmetric 
folds, whereas in the western flank, 

which has an overturned character, the 
relationship shows clockwise vorticity 
with “Z” asymmetric folds. The hinge 
of this anticline is located on the inner 
portion of the Fábrica Nova synform 
hinge and bounded to the east by the 
Bento Rodrigues fault.

The Alto Pai Miguel antiform is 
a reverse fold of a hectometric scale 
located in the eastern portion of the 
Fábrica Nova mine (Fig. 8). The core of 
the structure is composed of rocks from 
the Cercadinho Formation that outcrop 
in that area. Originally, these rocks were 
interpreted as belonging to the Batatal 
Formation arranged by a thrust fault. 
The correct modeling of this structure 
is of utmost importance because it will 
be reflected in the modeling of the mine.

4. Discussions and conclusions

The proposed model suggests that 
the Santa Rita syncline is a reclined fold 
of a subregional scale, with a WNW-
ESE axial direction and roots in the 
adjacent basement of the Santa Bárbara 
Complex. The inverse flank of this syn-
cline is bisected by the Água Quente 
thrust fault. This fold was generated 
during the Transamazonian event ap-
proximately 2,125 Ma ago and consists 

of a reclined synclinorial fold resulting 
from the refolding of the normal flank 
of the Ouro Preto nappe (e.g. Almeida 
2004). The hinge zone is located in the 
Caraça region (Fig. 2) with axes that 
exhibit moderate-to-steep ESE plung-
ing. The flanks are subparallel and the 
stratigraphic units are thinner in the 
overturned flank compared with its 
normal flank counterpart located to the 

west. Schists, phyllites, and ferruginous 
quartzites belong to the Piracicaba and 
Sabará groups are located in the core 
of the fold. The southern portion of the 
inverse flank of the Santa Rita syncline 
is sliced by a complex thrust fault system 
that Barbosa (1968) called Ouro Fino 
nappe. After these tectono-metamorphic 
events, a phase of mafic and ultramafic 
magmatism occurred during the pre-

K inematic indicators and the 
structural symmetry of the F

 defor-

mation phase are compatible with the 
deformation mechanism and partition-
ing related to the flanking fold model 
described and established by Passchier 
(2001) (Fig. 9). 

In the case of Fábrica Nova, the 
cross-cutting element to the regional 
fabric element is the crustal disconti-
nuity that feeds the mafic rock dikes 
in the NW-SE direction present in this 
segment of the QFe (Fig. 10). Based 
on this mechanism, the structures 

of the F
4
 deformation phase can be 

understood as the manifestation of 
the deformation partitioning process 
around the major discontinuity and 
second-order subsidiary structures in 
response to the crustal shortening in 
the EW direction.

along and around the zone surrounding 
a cross-cutting element (CE) (Passchier

CE is a crustal discontinuity represented 
by an ultramafic dike.

W hen considering this subre-
gional deformation mechanism using 
the flanking fold as a model to un-
derstand the Fábrica Nova structural 
framework, the strain ratio (Rf) can be 

measured considering 
i) the angular relationship of the 

direction of the layers in the short and 
long flanks and 

ii) the angular relationship be-

tween the crustal discontinuity, the 
transverse element direction, and the 
direction of the short flank layers 
(Passchier 2001). The Rf value is ap-
proximately 18.7 (Fig. 10).

Brasiliano age.
The Fábrica Nova mine is embed-

ded in a Fábrica Nova synform structure 
with axes oriented at 100/20. The direc-
tion of the bedding of the units that com-
prises the west flank behaves consistently 
and homogeneously as a homocline, 
which was slightly disturbed by undula-
tions from the F

3
 deformation phase. The 

east flank bedding, in turn, was strongly 
disturbed by folding partially associated 

with two shortening fields due to F
3
 and 

F
4
 deformation phase, respectively, in 

the N-S and E-W direction. In addition, 
the brittle tectonic structures that form 
the sedimentary basin of the Cata Preta 
Formation (e.g. Castro et al. 1998, Lip-
ski 2002) might have contributed to the 
rotation of the basement structures.

The relationships between the 
structures from the F

4
 deformation phase 

are the most complex because they do 

not directly respond to the regional E-W 
shortening field and are not laterally or 
regionally replicated. Cover deformation 
mechanisms induced by a basement-in-
volved structures can behave actively (e.g
