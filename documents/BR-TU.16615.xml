Abstract (resumo em Inglês) 
 

This report presents the Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) on a construction landfill. 

The main goal of the survey is to determine the shear wave velocities (??) in order to estimate the 

dynamic properties of the soil. The velocity of shear waves (??) were obtained from the Rayleigh 

wave’s dispersion. The present document reports the acquisition and processing of 28 seismic profiles 

(approximately 3225 m for MASW data) acquired between March and July 2015. In the acquisition, a 

linear array of 24 geophones spaced by 1.2 m was used for the active measurements. Since the method 

uses vertical impulse (PEG 40 and sledge hammer) and vertical recording, it was also possible to 

determine the compressional wave velocities derived from refraction analysis, using the Rayfract 

Seismic Refraction &amp;amp; Borehole Tomography® software. The 2D compressional wave models were used 

to infer the thickness/ geometry of the layers, as well as preliminary input for MASW data processing 

/modeling, since applying an a priori model minimizes the dispersion of the final results. The processing 

consists of two main stages: imaging dispersion curves of surface waves and the estimation of near-

surface shear-wave velocity by inversion of Rayleigh waves. Finally, a 2D S-wave velocity section was 

generated due to the CMP roll-along acquisition format. For the gridding process, the Golden Software's 

Surfer® was used, placing each S-wave profile (?? versus depth) in the middle of the seismic spread with 

which it was calculated. Finally, each line was placed in its location and represented Voxler 3 3D 

software®, allowing a better perception of the distribution of the dynamic properties of the soil along 

the landfill. Shear wave velocities (VS) generally increase with depth, but they can differ due to site 

conditions, water content, tide levels, landfill operation procedures, like compaction made on site, 

among others.

Resumo (resumo em Português) 

 
Com este trabalho pretende-se determinar a velocidade das ondas de cisalhamento (??) num aterro 

através do método da análise multicanal de ondas de superfície (MASW), estimando 

consequentemente as propriedades dinâmicas do solo. A velocidade das ondas de cisalhamento (??) 

foram obtidas a partir da dispersão das ondas de Rayleigh. 

O presente documento relata a aquisição e processamento de 28 perfis sísmicos adquiridos entre 

Março e Julho de 2015. Na aquisição foi usado um conjunto de 24 geofones verticais com uma 

frequência natural de 10 Hz. Os recetores estavam ligados entre si com um espaçamento de 1,2 m, 

sendo deslocados em conjunto 4.8 m após a realização de um par de tiros. Por cada posição foram 

realizados 2 tiros, com diferentes distâncias ao primeiro geofone, 2.4 e 9.6 m, mas apenas o tiro mais 

afastado (9.6 m) foi usado para a obtenção das ondas S com o método MASW. De acordo com as 

condições do sítio, a fonte utilizada foi a PEG-40 ou um martelo. 

Uma vez que o método utiliza um impulso vertical e receção vertical, também foi possível determinar 

a velocidade das ondas longitudinais (VP), derivadas da análise de refração usando o software Rayfract 

Seismic Refraction &amp;amp; Borehole Tomography ®. Para este método, ambos os tiros com diferentes 

distâncias foram usados para a análise das ondas refratadas. Os modelos de ondas de compressão 2D 

foram utilizados para aferir a espessura e número de camadas, como modelo preliminar para o 

processamento em MASW. A inserção de um modelo a priori permite uma melhor modelação da curva 



 

 

de dispersão ao espectro de velocidades, minimizando assim a dispersão dos resultados após a 

inversão. 

Para a inserção dos dados no software Rayfract Seismic Refraction &amp;amp; Borehole Tomography, todas as 

distâncias e posicionamentos inerentes à aquisição tiveram de ser convertidos em números de 

estações, utilizando como unidade de medida a distância entre geofones. Estabeleceu-se como 

estação 0 a posição do geofone mais próximo do tiro (G1). 

Para a obtenção dos modelos 2D da velocidade das ondas compressivas, foram picadas as primeiras 

chegadas.  

Posteriormente, criou-se um modelo de camadas baseado no modelo de ondas refratadas para a 

análise das ondas superficiais. O processamento das ondas superficiais consiste basicamente em duas 

etapas principais: (1) obtenção do espectro de velocidades, que corresponde à dispersão da energia 

relacionando a frequência com a velocidade de fase. Neste espectro de velocidades podem-se 

distinguir diversos modos de propagação das ondas superficiais, no entanto só o modo fundamental 

foi picado; Posteriormente segue-se (2) a estimativa da velocidade de cisalhamento através da 

inversão do modelo a priori criado. Finalmente, os perfis 2D da velocidade das ondas s foram gerados 

devido à aquisição em série realizada. Para o processo de interpolação espacial, utilizou-se o Golden 

Software Surfer®, onde cada perfil vertical ?? foi representado no meio dos 24 geofones, entre o 12º 

e o 13º. 

Com o método MASW produziram-se cerca de 695 perfis verticais 1D para as ondas S, perfazendo um 

comprimento total de 3225 m. Na refração, para o cálculo da velocidade das ondas P, foram utilizados 

1396 tiros, resultando num comprimento total de 4267 m. 

Finalmente, cada modelo 2D de velocidade das ondas S foi representada por um software 3D - Voxler 

3, permitindo assim uma melhor perceção da das propriedades dinâmicas do solo ao longo do aterro. 

Através da disposição dos modelos verifica-se que o substrato rochoso vai ficando mais profundo à 

medida que se aproxima do mar, sendo também visível que a espessura de sedimentos do aterro é 

maior junto à costa do que para o seu interior. Fazendo um balanço geral, as linhas adquiridas em 

épocas diferentes apresentam velocidades diferentes nos sedimentos do aterro, nomeadamente os 

perfis adquiridos em Março apresentam velocidades cisalhantes inferiores aos adquiridos em Junho e 

Julho. Este facto pode dever-se à água presente no solo derivada da época das chuvas, que ocorre em 

Março. Ademais, os perfis mais próximos da costa apresentam velocidades inferiores a todos os outros 

perfis, independentemente da data de aquisição, e da energia de compactação inerente ao local. A 

velocidade das ondas de cisalhamento (??) tende a aumentar com a profundidade, mas pode diferir 

com as condições do local, mais precisamente com a presença de água decorrente das chuvas ou da 

variação do nível de marés. As heterogeneidades na compactação de aterros também podem 

influenciar a sua velocidade.  

Neste trabalho, as inversões de velocidades podem ser vistas em todos os modelos 2D da velocidade 

das ondas S, entre os 0 m (MSL) até à base rochosa. Esta inversão encontra-se na mesma cota do nível 

freático e reflete, provavelmente, as variações das marés. Esta camada de baixa velocidade acima do 

substrato rochoso, em ocasiões de chuvas intensas, pode tornar ainda mais baixa a resistência ao 

cisalhamento.  

Para uma análise mais aprofundada da velocidade das ondas S, foram escolhidos três perfis: L01, L02 

e L06 de modo a compará-los entre si. No L02, fez-se um levantamento das marés referentes aos 2 

dias de aquisição, com o objetivo de analisar o efeito das marés na velocidade das ondas s. Nesta 

análise foi visível a mudança de maré que existia entre os dois dias de aquisição. Posteriormente, 

realizou-se uma comparação entre os perfis L01 e L02 de modo a perceber a influência da época das 



 

 

chuvas no comportamento do aterro. Feita a comparação, foi possível verificar que L01, adquirida em 

Março, atingia uma velocidade mínima na inversão de 245 m/s, enquanto L02, adquirida em Junho, 

atingia uma velocidade mínima de 293 m/s, mesmo estando o perfil L02 situado numa zona de maior 

energia de compactação.  

Por fim compararam-se dois perfis adquiridos na mesma época, mas que se localizavam em zonas com 

diferentes energias de compactação: L01 e L06. As velocidades mínimas atingidas na camada de 

inversão não diferem significativamente, sendo em L06,  ?????=217 m/s. No entanto, apesar da 

energia de compactação do local onde L06 foi adquirida ser muito superior à do local onde a linha 01 

foi adquirida, as velocidades cisalhantes do aterro não se apresentam superiores no modelo 2D obtido. 

Possivelmente a proximidade à costa e consequente influência da água, tenha maior impacto na 

variação da velocidade do que a energia de compactação. No entanto é possível verificar no perfil L06, 

uma mudança de velocidade entre as zonas com diferentes energias de compactação. 

Relativamente a análise do ??30, todos os modelos apresentam valores superiores a 360 m/s, o que 

classifica o solo como muito denso ou como rocha “macia”, no entanto os perfis são muito 

heterogéneo sentre si..  

Para uma melhor avaliação dos dados e classificação do terreno, seria vantajoso realizar uma série de 

análises ao aterro depois de compactado, como perfuração, ensaios in situ, SPT, amostragem e os 

ensaios de laboratório. Estas análises possibilitariam uma comparação da velocidade das ondas S com 

modelos empíricos utilizando os ensaios SPT. Inclusive, o cálculo do modo de distorção seria mais 

verossímil caso fossem disponibilizados valores da densidade.

1. Introduction 

During my internship in the company: Geosurveys Portugal – Geophysical Consultants, I had the 

chance to do my thesis with the data obtained on a MASW Survey realized on a company project. 

Regarding that fact, the location and identification of the survey area are confidential. During this 

work, I establish a method to get reliable results from the multichannel analysis of surface waves, 

which include a previous refraction analysis. 

 

1.1. Soil characterizations 

The geomechanical characterization of the shallow layers is very importante to understand the 

location in study. The near surface P and S-wave seismic velocities provide valuable information for 

studies of ground motion behavior. [Carvalho et al., 2009; Akin et al., 2011] Where the shear wave 

velocity is a fundamental parameter required to define the dynamic properties of soils. It is useful in 

the evaluation of foundation stiffness, earthquake site response, liquefaction potential, soil density, 

site classification, soil stratigraphy and foundation settlements. [Akin et al., 2011] There are several 

methods for estimating shear waves, such as borehole logging, seismic reflection profiles or surface 

wave’s inversion. [Carvalho et al., 2009] However, shear wave velocities of soil profiles are most 

accurately determined using in-situ seismic measurements because in-situ measurements involve very 

low strain levels, and the measured values can be used to obtain the maximum shear modulus (????) 

at a particular depth in a soil deposit. The small strain shear modulus, ???? is an important parameter 

in seismic analyses of landfills and is also related to the compressibility of municipal solid waste. It can 

be calculated using elasticity theory through the following equation: [Akin et al., 2011; 

Hanumantharao, C., &amp;amp; Ramana, G. V., 2008] 

???? = ???
2 

In the absence of a soil's density value it can be assumed, since slight variation of density has a small 

influence in the estimated value. [Hanumantharao, C., &amp;amp; Ramana, G. V., 2008] 

 

1.2. Refraction surveying 

The P-wave refraction survey was conducted mainly for the geometrical characterization of the 

structures of the landfill. The very shallow water table limits the P-wave velocity variations in the 

saturated soft sediments, and the primary objective of the test was the identification of the base of 

the soft sediments. The acquisition geometry was designed considering the desired investigation

depth. Long spreads for P-wave refraction were used to achieve greater investigation depth and 

identify possible lithological boundaries below the water table and lateral variation. 

 

1.3.  Refraction method 

The seismic refraction is a fast, efficient and non-invasive method. This method is based on the 

generation of seismic P waves that propagates on the subsoil and refract in the interfaces with 

increasing propagation velocities in depth, and with sufficiently different elastic characteristics. The 

major limitation of this method is that it cannot identify a low speed layer in the middle of two layers 

with higher speeds. Which means that the velocity of propagation of P-waves has always to increase 

in depth. [Redpath, 1973]. 

 

1.4. MASW surveying 

The software winMASW® allows analyzing seismic data to determine the vertical profile of the shear 

waves. The MASW method is based on the phenomenon of dispersion study of surface waves. [Neves 

et al., 2014] 

 

1.5. Surface Waves 

The surface waves result from the interaction between P and S waves when they reach a surface. These 

propagate along the surface, decreasing its amplitudes almost exponentially when they go deeper. 

The surface wave are dispersive, i.e. different frequencies propagate with different speeds, known as 

phase velocity. (Neves et al., 2014) 

Mainly, there are two types of surface waves: Rayleigh and Love waves. In this thesis only the Rayleigh 

waves will be discussed. Surface wave methods are especially appealing in measuring ?? in landfills, 

because they are non-intrusive method. The shear wave velocities can be derived from inverting the 

dispersive phase velocity of surface waves using a process called multichannel analysis of surface 

waves (MASW). (Xia et al., 2004) 

 

1.5.1. MASW Processing 

MASW estimates S-wave velocity from multichannel vertical component data. It consists in three parts: 

1) data acquisition; 2) dispersion-curve picking and 3) Inversion. Furthermore, a 2D S-wave velocity 

section can be generated when surface wave data are acquired in a standard CMP roll along acquisition 

format.

? Surface-wave data acquisition   

The type of surface waves acquired depends on the source, direction of impact and geophones 

orientation. When the source is a vertical impact and geophones are vertical component, the surface 

waves analyzed are Rayleigh. The maximum penetration depth in a homogeneous medium is about 

one wavelength [Elisoft – geophysical software and services, 2015]. The currently accepted rule of 

thumb for the maximum penetration depth is approximately half the longest wavelength. Normally, 

the longer the geophone spread, the higher the resolution of the dispersion image. To avoid spatial 

aliasing, the receiver spacing should be less than half the shortest measured wavelength.  

? Dispersion curves of surface waves on multi-channel record. 

In this step, proceeds to the picking of the dispersion curve in the F-V domain or F-K domain. The 

conversion is made through the relation: ? =
?

?
, where ? is the phase velocity associated to the 

frequency ? and wave number ?. [Dal Moro et al., 2003] ? ? ? spectrum consists in an image 

representing the energy density. This image uses the colour intensity to show the amplitudes of the 

data at different frequency and wave-number components. Moreover, as the wave field is only 

characterized by Rayleigh waves, it is possible to see several propagation modes, reliable separated; 

which is possible only through a multi-channel recording method combined with an appropriate multi-

channel data-processing technique [Tselentis &amp;amp; Delis , 1998]. Such curves are later used for the 

inversion process, which eventually provides subsurface information of use in geological or 

geotechnical applications [Dal Moro et al., 2003] 

? Inversion of dispersion curves of surface waves 

The Rayleigh-wave phase velocity of a layered earth model is a function of frequency and four earth 

properties: P-wave velocity (??), S-wave velocity (??), density (?), and thickness of layers (?).  

?(?, ?, ??, ??, ?, ?) = 0

Where ? is the frequency in Hz, ? is the Rayleigh wave phase velocity at frequency ?. 

Analysis of the Jacobian matrix provides a measure of dispersion-curve sensitivity to these earth 

properties where shear-wave velocity is the dominant influence on a dispersion curve in the high-

frequency range (&gt;2 Hz), therefore only S-wave velocities are considered unknowns in the inversion. 

[Xia et al., 1999]  

The disadvantage of the inversion method is the non-uniqueness of the solutions, namely the 

possibility of obtaining many layers, relatively close to the solution, which satisfy the observed data. 

For this method to be applied successfully, it is necessary to restrict some parameters, like establishing 

an initial starting model for the inversion process, to minimize the dispersion of the final result. This 

initial model might be defined using the layer thicknesses obtained by other seismic the methods, like 

refraction for example. [Neves et al., 2014] 

However, in the processing software used, the method used for the inversion of the dispersive curve 

is based on an optimization process (genetic algorithms) [Dal Moro, 2007).] This method implemented 

a two-step inversion, the first one starts with several preliminary “parallel” runs and the second one 

uses the previously determined fittest model as starting population. (Figure 2)  

 
Figure 2- Genetic Algorithms sequence for surface wave analysis 

The key element for any kind of optimization is the model evaluation, which is performed by means of 

an objective function that allows a quantitive estimation of the model. For that it’s considered the RMS 

value of the difference between the observed and calculated phase velocities, i.e. the dispersion curve.

If surface wave data are collected in a CMP roll-along acquisition fashion, a 2D S wave velocity section

The Next Generation Attenuation ground motion prediction equations use the shear wave velocity of 

the top 30 m of the subsurface profile (??,30) as the primary parameter for characterizing the effects 

of sediment stiffness on ground motions.  

The Caltrans Seismic Design Criteria classifies sites based on VS of the top 30 m of the soil profile (??30). 

Sites are divided into the six categories (Soil Profile Types A through F) presented in Table 1.

1.7. Purpose and objectives of the survey 

This survey was performed in a construction landfill, aiming to evaluate the dynamic response of the 

soil, through the estimation of the shear wave velocities. The velocities of the shear waves were 

obtained from the Rayleigh wave’s dispersion using the Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves 

method (MASW). Additionally, and because the method uses vertical impulse and vertical recording, 

it was also possible to determine the compressional wave velocity (from refraction analysis).

2. SITE CONDITIONS 

 
As said before, the location and identification of the survey area in this study is confidential, so the 

geological context, as well as its representation, will be without coordinates or other identifying 

information. 

 

2.1. Topography and Geomorphology 

 

The survey area is near the coastline represented in Figure 3. Onshore site develops according to the 

continental tectonics, where erosion landforms are structural plains, which were built due to the slow 

increase of the sedimentary thickness of the crust and the continuous rise of the water level.   

The site is mainly on the highlands of flat top surface with an absolute elevation of over 200 m, known 

as a plateau, which belongs to one type of structural plain.  The site gradually becomes hilly terrain 

from east to west and develops into coastal cliffs when meeting the coastline.  Some parts of the site 

are explored areas of limestone which develop karst topography such as cavities, sink holes and slump 

zones. Concerning the mass movements, a large number of seasonal streams flow from east to west, 

where the drainage patterns across the site are typically dendritic and are characterized by irregular 

branching of tributary control. 

The coastline is made up of long sandy beaches interrupted by rocky shores and steep cliffs that rise 

about 120 meters above sea level. The offshore site develops coastal erosion landform, whose type is 

called wave cut terrace – this inclines towards the sea and its outer edge and is roughly parallel to the 

coastline.

2.2. Regional Geology   

 

The regional geology is dominated by Proterozoic formation, whilst Neoproterozoic formation occurs 

in the western part of the country.  The onshore section is characterized by a transformed margin 

which has a distinctive, mainly progradational stratigraphic architecture with long-term sedimentary 

gaps and high-elevation marine terraces resulting from moderate Upper Cretaceous–Cenozoic to 

major Quaternary uplifting. Margin style also governs spatial variations in the volume of offshore 

sediment dispersed in the associated deep-sea fans. 

The age and lithology of the geological formations existing in the survey area are the following: 

? Holocene marine deposits: sand, gravel, clay, etc.  

? Cenomanian-turonian: oolitics and pisolitic limestones, marl (mudstone) and conglomerate.  

? Cenomanian: limestone, oolites, dolomite and conglomerate.  

? Albian: limestones, marl (mudstone) and gypsum conglomerates.  

? Apcian: marl (mudstone), limestone and gypsum. 

 

2.3. Field Tests and landfill construction 

 

A geotechnical survey was conducted in the area before the construction of the landfill, including 

drilling, in situ tests, SPT, sampling and laboratory tests. 

That investigation classified the site stratigraphic according to the following: 

Soil layers: 

a. Marine deposits; 

b. Loose, fine-grained, silty sand; 

c. Very soft clay. 

Rock units: 

d. Moderately weathered Limestone; 

e. Moderately weathered Mudstone; 

 

Before the construction of the landfill, the harbor basin was dredged. After the excavation, there were 

mainly two sorts of rock units: moderately weathered limestone (d) and moderately weathered 

mudstone (e). 

All the soil layers were removed completely before the construction of the quay (Figure 4).

2.4. Compaction of the landfill 

 

During the construction, the landfill was compacted. The aim of the compression of the landfill is to 

increase the resistance to the strain disturbance of the soil under the action of external forces; reduce 

possible volumetric variations, reducing the empty spaces and consequently the water absorption 

capacity and the percolation decreases, making the soil more stable. 

There is no information regarding the moisture content, but concerning the area compression, Figure 

5 shows a representative scheme of the compression energy inherent to the survey area. [Das, B. M., 

(2010)].

Figure 5- Disposition of the different compaction energies along the survey area. 

 

The primary technique used in the compaction of the landfill was the dynamic compaction. This 

process consists primarily of dropping a heavy weight repeatedly on the ground at regular intervals. 

The weight of the hammer used varies over a range of 80 to 360 kN, and the height of the hammer 

drop varies between 7.5 and 30.5 m. The stress waves generated by the hammer drops aid in the 

densification. The degree of compaction achieved at a given site depends on the following three 

factors: 1). Weight of hammer; 2). Height of hammer drop and on the 3). Spacing of locations at which 

the hammer is dropped. However there are no references regarding this values. [Das, B. M., (2010)].

3. DATA ACQUISITION 

 
The present document reports the acquisition and processing of 28 seismic profiles, acquired between 

March and July 2015, using geometries favorable to the refraction and MASW methods.  

The survey was conducted along the profiles shown in Figure 6 and, despite the acquisition orientation, 

the seismic lines are mostly oriented NNE-SSW with a maximum length of 354 m.

3.1. Equipment and Data Acquisition Parameters 

 

The equipment and data acquisition parameters were carefully selected in order to meet the 

requirements and goals of the project. The energy was generated by two different sources used during 

the survey: the Accelerated Weight Drop (AWD) seismic source PEG-40 and the sledgehammer + base 

plate. The source used for each shot was selected according to the weather and site 

conditions/limitations. The land streamer used had 24 channels (vertical geophones) spaced 1.2 m, 

with a total active length of 27.6 m, and the recorder was an exploration seismograph Geode 24 

channels (Figure 7). The acquisition parameters are summarized in Table 2.

3.2. Geometry 

 

To process the refraction data, Rayfract® software was used. This has the particularity of using station 

numbers, instead of real distances, to define the shots and geophones’ positions. Regarding that fact, 

the geophones’ spacing of 1.2 m was used as the measuring unit of all the remaining 

positions/distances. To accomplish this limitation, a multiple offset geometry was used, along with the 

source and the first geophone distanced by 2.4 m and 9.6 m, respectively offset 1 and offset 2 (Figure 

8). The multiple offsets, at 2.4 m and 9.6 m, had the aim of increasing the resolution on shallow layers 

and of achieving greater depths of investigation, respectively. 

For the refraction P wave, two shot offset were processed, however, for the MASW, only the larger 

shot offset was used to guarantee the desired investigation depth. 

In order to increase the signal to noise ratio, for each offset 2 or 5 shots were stacked, according to 

the selected source (2 stacks using PEG-40 and 5 with the sledgehammer). 

 

 
Figure 8 – Offset diagram of the seismic spread used for the survey (not to scale). 

 

The space increment along the line was set at 4.8m (spread advance in line); meaning, when the two 

shots for that spread position are executed, the system is moved forward 4.8m and a new set of shots, 

in the 2 different offsets, are executed (Figure 9).  
 

The raw recorded data has the geometry assigned for each shot in distance. These distances were 

converted into stations with intervals of 1.2 m (minimum station spacing). Figure 9 shows the relation 

between source and receiver positions and their respective distances and station numbers.

3.3. Line Identification 

 

The lines were identified by the line number (e.g. L01) followed, if applicable, by the portion of the line 

“_A” or “_B” stem (e.g. L01_A). The following table (Table 3) shows the line ID used henceforth in this 

report, the month of acquisition, the number of shots, the line length in meters for both methodology 

refraction and MASW. Some of the lines acquired in different days were merged whenever they match 

the following criteria: 

? Correspondence to a continuation of a previous line (have the same alignment, without a 

lateral shift); 

? Have the same topography (the topography did not change due to an addition of construction 

landfill material); 

? The lines are acquired within a short period of time in order to have a similar level of 

compaction and water content.

3.4. Navigation and Positioning 

 

A criterious positioning procedure was made. The topographic survey was carried out using a RTK 

system. A measurement (x y, and z) was performed at the 1st shot position and for geophones 1, 12 

and 24 (G01; G12; G24; S01 in Figure 9); at the last shot position and again for geophones 1, 12 and 24 

(G01’; G12’; G24’; S##’); and in areas with curves in the profile and topographic variations, such as 

trenches or slopes (Figure 10). The positioning was based on the WGS84 datum and the elevations are 

relative to Mean Sea Level (MSL). 

 

 
Figure 10- Representation of the measurement positions acquired according to the topographic 

variations. The blue points represent shot positions and the red ones geophone positions in the landstreamer. 

 

Although the survey area is relatively flat and all the lines range from 2 to 4 m above sea level, the 

same profile of the topographic variations is always less than 1 m. 

 

3.5. Data Acquisition Constraints 

 

During daytime there was construction work in progress on the site. Therefore, the MASW survey was 

conducted at night in order to avoid ambient/seismic noise. The acquisition was sometimes 

constrained by obstacles in the planned lines, adverse weather conditions and infrastructures, such as 

trenches (Figure 11). Small curves or even small spatial shifts from the planned profile were made 

when it was necessary to bypass some obstacles (vehicles or pavement bricks - Figure 12).

For example, in the case of a trench, besides the position of the geophones G01, G12 and G24, other 

geophone positions had to be measured in order to get all the topographic variations.

4. SIGNAL ANALYSIS  

 

In order to ensure that the data could be processed successfully, all the acquired seismic data 

underwent a thorough quality control procedure of the signal quality, positioning and acquisition 

geometry. The following QC was implemented for each line: 

? Refracted wave check for selected shots by a shot to gather analysis; 

? Noise analysis and signal saturation assessment; 

? Positioning quality control – the lines have to follow some requirements, such as overlapping 

with previous acquired profiles, matching what was planned or, if the profiles do not match 

due to constraints/obstacles in the field, they should have been approved; 

? The geometry needs to be respected and checked before processing. Therefore, the source 

and receiver offset was controlled for each land shot, in order to ensure that the chosen 

geometry was preserved. 

 

4.1. Source Analysis 

Due to the weather conditions, the landfill was muddy, which made it difficult to use of the van and, 

consequently, the PEG-40. As a result, some shots had to be done with another source – the 

sledgehammer. In the L03, eight shots (10169-10176) were acquired with a sledgehammer. Hence, in 

order to understand which frequency is generated from the two sources, the frequency spectrum of 

the sources is described below (Figure 13).

Figure 13 – a) Frequency spectrum of Source 2-Sledgehammer regarding the 10070 of L03 and b) Frequency spectrum of 

Source 1-PEG 40 regarding shot 10018 of L03. 

 

The amplitude spectrum analysis allows the identification of the dominant frequency or period 

corresponding to the maximum amplitude value. Considering the two spectrums, it is possible to 

conclude that PEG-40 has a higher dominant frequency than that of the sledgehammer. In both cases, 

the frequency was limited to the highest amplitudes for the processing.  

 

4.2. QC Data Issues 

 

During the QC analysis, some issues were detected in the data: 

? Some data was affected by low frequency resonance depredating velocity spectrum and, 

therefore, making the dispersion curve picking impossible. This issue is identified in: 

o Shots 10010 and 10022 of L3 (Figure 14 – a) and b) respectively); 

o Shot 10052 of L8 (Figure 14 – c). 

? Some shots were also affected by the plate’s vibration, due to the coupling of the base plate to 

a hard surface, leading to a rebound of the base plate and causing subsidiary pulses and ringing 

effects: 

o Shot 10010 of L11 presents high frequency noise; therefore, this profile was processed in 

MASW using the maximum frequency content of 50 Hz (Figure 14 – d)); 

o Shot 10026 of L13 was not processed in MASW because it shows multiple pulses caused 

by the plate’s vibration (Figure 14 – e)).

5. SEISMIC DATA PROCESSING 

 

Twenty-eight seismic profiles were processed using MASW and refraction methodologies were used, 

respectively, winMASW® and Rayfract® software. The generic processing flow applied to the data was 

organized as in Figure 15. All the shots were used in the refraction methodologies, whereas, in the 

MASW, only the far offset shots were processed. 

 

 
 

Figure 15 - Processing workflow applied to the seismic lines. Rounded boxes represent the processing steps and grey 

boxes represent the input/output products. 

 

The use of the refraction processing was crucial for the MASW processing, because without an a priori 

processing to establish near surface structure (velocity and thickness), the dispersion of the results 

after inversion was tremendous.

5.1. Refraction Processing 

 

The seismic refraction processing was done using Rayfract® software after importing the following 

data (Figure 15): 

- SEG-2 with nominal geometry assigned; 

- Topographic insertion. 

 

The processing in Rayfract® included the picking of the first arrival (Figure 16), for every shot and every 

channel where the SNR allows accurate picking.   

The analyses of the first arrival picking was done for every line, allowing a minimal RMS error of the 

Rayfract models (see Appendix A: Notation used) 

 
Figure 16– Shot gathered analysis (shot 10010, l01) for refracted wave analysis. 

 

A 2D compressional wave velocity model in grid format (*.grd) was obtained for each line plotted using 

the Golden Software's Surfer® (see Figure 17, using the Delta-t-V method. This pseudo-2D turning ray 

inversion method was chosen because it delivers continuous 1D depth ??. velocity profiles for all 

profile stations and it has a better vertical resolution than the other inversion methods available in the 

software. 

The 2D compressional wave models were used to infer the thickness/geometry of the layers, as 

preliminary input for MASW data processing/modeling (see Figure 18).

Figure 17 - 2D compressional wave velocity model obtained fom L01.MASW Processing 

 

For each shotpoint with 9.6 m S/R offset, a 1D ?? vertical velocity model was located in the middle of 

the spread between the 12th and the 13th geophone (see red star in Figure 9). The source offset of 

2.4m wasn´t used because it would not cover the desired investigation depth. 

 

5.1.1. Model Creation 

 

Since the objective is to characterize the landfill, the upper velocity limit of the 2D compressional wave 

velocity model was defined at ??=???? ??
?? for each line. The lower limit wasn´t standard because 

the ????? was different for each model. However, the thicknesses of each layer ? range were around 

500 ???? (see Figure 18 ) in order to establish the surface layers of the 1D ?? vertical velocity model.

For each shot, superficial waves were selected (Figure 19) to represent the velocity spectrum.  

 

Figure 19 - Shot gathered analysis (shot 10010, l01) for refracted wave analysis - selection of the surface waves. 

 

The velocity spectrum corresponds to an energy scatter plot that relates the frequency with the phase 

velocity for surface waves.

 For picking the dispersion curve, the points that belonged to a particular propagation mode of a 

surface wave were selected and the fundamental mode (Figure 20) was picked in the f-v domain. 

Sometimes, the interference of different modes can alter the apparent dispersion characteristics of 

the fundamental mode or result in higher modes being misinterpreted as fundamental. Therefore, the 

picking was only made up until the interference of a higher mode.  

All the 1D shear wave models resulted from the fundamental vibration mode picking of the velocity 

spectrum.  Besides that, sometimes, a higher mode can be visible in the data such as in Figure 20, yet 

it wasn't consistent in all data.

After the picking in the f-v domain, it is possible to see the dispersion curve in the f-k spectrum (Figure 

21).

5.1.3. Maximum depth penetration 

 

The maximum penetration depth in a homogeneous medium is about one wavelength. The currently 

accepted rule of thumb for the maximum penetration depth is approximately half of the longest wave 

length (?/2) or (?/2.5) [Elisoft – geophysical software and services, 2015]. This value is the outcome of 

the relationship between velocity and the frequencies represented in the dispersion curve:

5.1.4. Modeling and Inversion of the dispersion curve 

The initial thickness model created, based on the refractive method, is introduced at this stage of 

processing (Figure 18), and then adjusted to the velocities of each layer and bedrock to adjust to the 

velocity spectrum (Figure 22).

Having finalized the adjustments of the model to the dispersion curve, the second phase was the 

inversion of the model created. This inversion is made by means of an optimization process (genetic 

algorithms) that requires the computer a big calculation effort. (Dal Moro et all, 2007) 

In the inversion, two 1D ?? models were obtained: the “best” model (in terms of lower misfit, i.e the 

discrepancy between the observed and the calculated curve) and a medium model calculated by 

means of MPPD (Marginal Posterior Probability Density). However, just the best model was considered 

further on. The next figure shows the results of the first inversion. (Figure 23)

Figure 23 –First inversion results: Velocity spectrum and dispersion curve (a); misfit evolution (b); and 1D shear wave 

velocity model obtained for L1 for shot 10006. 

 

To improve the results, namely the misfit evolution of the model to the velocity spectrum, a second 

inversion was made with the best output of the first inversion – the best model. In this inversion, its 

limits were adjusted to achieve a better approximation with the dispersion curve.  

The next figure shows the results of the second inversion. (Figure 24)

As it was expected, the error decreases, reaching a “misfit evolution" of 1% between the “fittest 

model” and the dispersion curve. 

 

5.1.5. Model Validation 

 

The 1D shear wave velocity model obtained in the second inversion must be compared with the 

dispersion curve of the fundamental mode in order to determine if the misfit is satisfactory (Figure 25). 

 

 
Figure 25– Comparison between the dispersion curve and the final model created 

 
For the interpolation, each and every S-wave profile (?? versus depth) was displaced/ incremented 

with its respective topographic elevation, as represented in Figure 26. Also, the layer thickness, given 

by the software winMASW®, was converted to the depth of half of the layer, considering 2 points for 

the first layer (1/2 layer and the topography), both with the same velocity and a middle point for the 

remaining layers (see example in Figure 26).

Software's Surfer®

6. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 

The 2D shear wave velocity section was obtained for each profile using Golden Software's Surfer® and 

interpolating all 1D ?? models of the respective line (Figure 26). The interpolation was performed using 

the Triangulation methodology (Golden Software, Inc, 2014) with a spacing of 0.2 m and anisotropy 

ratio of 5. The model was filtered using a low pass filter (moving average) with a filter size of 3 rows x 

5 columns.  

The lines were plotted from southwest (SW) to northeast (NE), independently of the acquisition 

orientation. 

For a better perception of the evolution of the dynamic properties of the soil along the landfill, all the 

28 2D shear velocity models were paced in its locations and represented by a 3D software - Voxler 3® 

by Golden Software, on a representative scheme of the area under study. 

In addition to that, every model has its own ??30 graphic on top, rightly placed. This value it’s an output 

of the software winMASW for every 1D ?? profile. This estimation, however, goes beyond the 

maximum penetration depth, so after the layer stratification, the bedrock is assumed with the same 

shear wave velocity until the 30 m of depth.

Concerning the sea location, at northwest from the survey, it is possible to see the deepening of the 

bedrock towards the sea. However, the landfill is at the same height relative to the average level of 

the sea water due to the higher thickness of sediments above.  

Regarding the acquisition time, the lines acquired in March (rainy season) (Table 3) present lower 

velocities above the bedrock, this is probably due to the high water content in the landfill in that time 

season. On the contrary, as expected, the remaing lines, in general, present higher velocities in the 

landfill. However, closest to the sea, the shear waves velocities models tend to decrease its velocities 

in the landfill, for example L04_B, L12_B, L12_A, etc. (Figure 6 and Figure 27). 

Besides, several elements may affect the shear wave’s velocities, such as tides, uneven compression 

in the landfill, different soils, which can lead to different elastic properties, etc. 

A deeper analysis could be done to each shear wave velocity model, so three profiles were chosen to 

compare L01, L02 and L06 (Figure 28 and Figure 29-b)).  

 

 

 
 

 

Figure 28–shear wave velocity model for a) L01 and b) L06 resultant from the interpolation of all 1D ?? models obtained 

for each line.

The purpose of comparing L01 and L06 is to understand the influence of different compaction energies 

(Figure 5) on shear wave velocities. For that effect, the lines were acquired in the same season to 

eliminate other factor influences. 

Analyzing these two models, the differences in the depth of the bedrock is clearly visible, changing 

approximately 5 m. The minimum shear wave velocity achieved in both models is not significant. In 

model 06, ????? = 217 ?/? where as in model 01, ?????  =  245 ?/?.  

However, despite the L06 being acquired in a zone with higher compaction energy (7000-8000 kNm) 

than the L01 (6000 kNm), the shear wave velocities in L06 are lower than in L01. Perhaps the proximity 

of the sea may have a greater influence than the compaction energy made on site or the materials 

used in each section of the landfill were different, having consequently a different responses. 

The purpose of comparing L01 and L02 is to understand the influence of the rainy season in the landfill 

behavior. Comparing this two models, the minimum velocity in L01, as it was already said above, 

is ????? = 245 ?/?, where as in model 02, ????? = 293 ?/?. The lines acquired in June reveals 

higher minimum velocities (almost 50?/?) than the one acquired in March, even though L01 being 

located in a bigger energy compaction zone. 

 

6.1. ???? Analysis  

 
All the lines analyzed present a ??30 above 360 ?/?, which means that, by Caltrans Seismic Design 
Criteria, all the soils are considered in the site class C - Very dense soil and soft rock. 
However, there are some diferences between the lines. For instance, there are models with very low 
values for the ??30, such as L04_B, L10, L11 and L13 and models with a great variety, like L02 or L07_B. 
Althought, the lack of information regarding the site, namely the soil conditions and composition 
prevent a deeper analysis. 

 
6.2. Tides Influence 

 

Finally, to exemplify the tides influence in the shear wave velocities models, due to the water level 

variation, I used L02 to make this analysis because it was acquired in two different days.  

Analyzing the log acquisition of this line (Table 7), regarding the day and hour, a tides plot for each day 

was taken and plotted (Figure 34). These tides plots relate the sea level, in meters, with the time of 

the day, indicating also the high and low tides periods. 

For a better visualization and characterization, the tides plot were edited and selected for the 

acquisition period of each shot (Figure 29).

As we can see the tides level has a real impact in the shear wave velocity model, a lower velocity layer 

follows the tides level along the line, reaching a maximum elevation in the highest tides, in both days. 

Furthermore, the differences in tides level is visible in the shear wave’s velocity (transition between 

shots 10060 and 10062). However, the differences in the tides only change the saturation level, 

because a higher zone still affected with water. 

  

6.3. Elastic Modulus 

 

[Mavko, G. et al, 2009] summarizes some popular and useful ?? ?  ?. Density is a simple 

volumetric average of the rock constituent densities and is closely related to porosity by: 

?? = (1 ? ?)?0 + ??1 

where ?0 is the density of mineral grains, ??1 is the density of pore fluids, and ? is the porosity.  

 

 
Figure 30 - Both forms of Gardner's relations applied to log and laboratory sandstone data- [Castagna et al., 1993] 

 

Using the equation selected in red, it was possible to estimate the density from the P-wave models. 

However, this was only an estimation, because the equation is intended for consolidated rocks, wich 

is not the case of landfill in study. Above it is the result of the density model calculation using the 

equation referred. 

The following profiles (Figure 31 &amp;amp; Figure 32) were disposed with a vertical scale of 1:15 and a 

horizontal scale of 1:30.

With the density values calculate, it is already possible to achieve the shear modulus (Figure 32), 

through the formula:  ???? = ???
2. However, due to the high uncertainties and approximate 

equations, this is only an example, not being calculated for all profiles performed in the landfill.

7. CONCLUSIONS 

 

The construction landfill was successfully surveyed. The site was acoustically very noisy; 

nevertheless, due to the decision of acquiring data during the night shift, the obtained data shows high 

quality level allowing a reliable interpretation for refraction method and for surface waves analysis.  

In seismic refraction, 1396 shots were analyzed, resulting in 28 2D compressional velocity models, 

making a total length of 4267 m. For MASW, 695 shots were analyzed, resulting in 695 1D shear velocity 

profiles and 28 2D models, making a total length of 3225 m.  

The quality control and acquisition format, provided by Geosurveys, was tailored to ensure that the 

acquired data meet the requirements, in order to better estimate the seismic wave velocities and, 

therefore, to assess the elastic condition of the landfill. The acquisition parameters, namely the 

number of geophones, the distance between them and the use of the biggest shot offset allow a better 

vertical and horizontal resolution, however a horizontal resolution of 4.8 m in the 2D shear wave 

velocity model is relatively low. 

The obtained shear wave velocity models are in agreement with the site characteristics, according 

to the information available. Within the same line, the 1D shear wave velocity profiles show a good 

lateral continuity and consistency in velocity variations, with velocities varying between 200 and 

500m/s within the landfill. A shear wave velocity inversion can be seen in almost the profiles (see 

Figure 27), from 0 m (MSL) until the bedrock, what is consistent with the phreatic level. 

The landfill velocities (above the bedrock) obtained for the lines acquired in March are lower than 

the velocities obtained for the lines acquired in June, this is probably due to the high water content in 

the landfill in March (rainy season). At first sight, the different energy compaction zones did not have 

a direct and straight forward relation with the shear wave velocity models. 

Regarding the ??30 analysis, all the lines present values above 360 ?/?, which means that, by 

Caltrans Seismic Design Criteria, all the soils are considered in the site class C - Very dense soil and soft 

rock. However, there are some diferences between the lines. For instance, there are models with very 

low values for the ??30, such as L04_B, L10, L11 and L13, that could have a different site response 

comparatively to the other models. 

For future work, a couple of cross sections models could be acquired in order to evaluate the landfill 

behavior along the coast. Some field testes, after the final compaction and construction of the landfill, 

such as drilling, SPT, sampling and laboratory testing could be useful to consolidate the work. Those 

would allow the comparison between the shear wave velocities and the SPT tests or an accurate 

evaluation of shear modulus, if some densities measures of the landfill where supplied.
