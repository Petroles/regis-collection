ABSTRACT
To date, the vast majority of river sedimentology study has relied on two main categories of observation: 
direct observation of shallow trenches, cut faces and cores or geophysical survey on dry and shallow regions 
of braid bars. In this study, a sub-bottom profiler was used to investigate the stratigraphy of the lower course 
of the Tocantins River in the Amazon region, between the city of Tucuruì and the village of Nazaré dos Patos. 
The interest in this specific region lies on the possible variation of the fluvial regime due to the installation of 
the dam of the Tucuruì hydroelectric plant and the perspective that such river would become navigable as soon 
as the canal lock will be completed. Collected data show a detailed variety and complexity of architectural 
elements, as well as internal structure of sandy macroforms. Furthermore, the results allowed the identification 
of three main environments linked to channel sedimentation processes: by-pass, transition and deposition 
environments, whose distribution is linked to channel dynamics and bedrock topography. The application of 
the study is manifold, once it provides not only an insight into sedimentary structure of alluvial forms and 
sedimentation history, but also elements demanded to plan eventual engineering works for river navigability.

Key words: anastomosed rivers, alluvial sedimentology, architectural facies, stratigraphy, high-resolution seismic.

INTRODUCTION

The Tocantins-Araguaia is the largest watershed 
totally included in the Brazilian territory, draining a 
total area of 757,000 km2, corresponding to 9% of 
the country (Lima et al. 2004, Latrubesse et al. 2005). 
The Tocantins River has about 2,400 km length, 
with its main tributaries related to the Manoel Alves, 
do Sono, Manoel Alves da Natividade, Araguaia, 
Santa Teresa and Itacaiunas rivers with an average 
discharge of 11,800 m3/s (Lima et al. 2004).

The Tocantins-Araguaia basin plays an 
important economic role by being a region with 
relevant potential for agriculture, mining and 

hydroelectric energy production. This latter sector 
is particularly important, as the 6 most important 
hydroelectric plants installed along the river 
(Serra da Mesa, Cana Brava, São Salvador, Peixe 
Angical, Luís Eduardo Magalhães and Tucuruí) 
account for 15% of the hydroelectric production 
of Brazil (ANEEL 2010).

Based on a study of Potter (1978), Gupta (2007) 
synthesized the following parameters to define a 
big river: length &gt; 103km, drainage basin area &gt; 
10  km , water discharge &gt; 200x109 m3/year and 
sediment load up to 1000Mt/year. According to this 
definition, the Tocantins River should be included 
in such category, although suspended sediment load 
is comparatively small due to the fact that the river

drains mostly cratonic areas in savanna and lies in a 
wet tropical climate region (Latrubesse et al. 2005).

Recent study of Sambrook Smith et al. (2009) 
described the sedimentological and alluvial 
architecture of a large braid bar in the Paraná 
River and pointed to the few sedimentological 
data available for large rivers due to the logistic 
difficulty of monitoring such channels.

To date, the vast majority of river sedimentology 
study has relied on two main categories of 
observation: shallow trenches, cut faces and cores, 
or the application of shallow geophysical methods 
on dry and shallow regions of braid bars. A variety 
of geophysical methods have been applied to study 
fluvial environments, providing the description of 
different characteristics and physical parameters. 

Baines et al. (2002) showed the applicability 
of ERI (Electrical Resistivity Imaging) to map the 
geometry of gravel and sand river channel-fills 
buried in an environment where GPR penetration was 
hampered by the presence of clay and silt. Hirsch et 
al. (2008) carried out a comparison among different 
geophysical methods and observed that while ERI 
was capable of detecting changes in sediment types 
and boundaries, GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) 
showed the internal structure of a river terrace 
site, and this capability was used in many studies 
of alluvial river deposits (Sambrook Smith et al. 
2006, Hugenholtz et al. 2007, Sambrook Smith et 
al. 2009). On the other hand, high-resolution seismic 
is a well established methodology to study internal 
sedimentary facies in a variety of environments (eg: 
Hofmann et al. 2006, Novak and Bjorck 2002).

Such methods allowed the study of mor-
phological facies and the internal structure of 
sand bars and dunes in both marine and fluvial 
environments in order to describe recent and 
ancient depositional sequences, as well as to gather 
data for sedimentological modelling.

In this study, a sub-bottom profiler was used to 
investigate stratigraphy of the lower course of the 
Tocantins River, in the Amazon region, between the 

city of Tucuruí and the village of Nazaré dos Patos. 
The interest in this specific region lies on the possible 
variation of the fluvial regime due to the installation 
of the dam of the Tucuruí hydroelectric plant and the 
perspective that such river would become navigable 
as soon as the canal lock will be completed.

In most cases the construction of a dam 
implies in a reduction of the liquid discharge, as a 
consequence of storage and evaporation losses, as 
well as the capacity of sediment transport (Brandt 
2000). In terms of sediment discharge, Williams 
and Wolman (1984 apud Brandt 2000) estimated the 
sediment retention efficiency for large reservoirs to 
be greater than 99% for the bed load as a result the 
transport capacity of a flow downstream of a dam is 
larger than the effective load.

Using the notation of Brandt (2000), where Q 
is the water discharge, L the solid load transported 
and k the transport capacity, the branch of the 
Tocantins River downstream the Tucuruí dam can 
be classified as Case 1 (reduced Q and L &amp;lt;K). In this 
case, an adjust in the transversal section of the canal 
can occur, showing the degradation of the river bed 
and the erosion of margins, being the equilibrium 
determined by the relative erodibility between the 
bed and margins of the river (Brandt 2000). The 
length of the branch affected by degradation also 
depends on these factors, as well as the sediment 
transport of the tributaries downstream the dam.

In the study area it is possible to recognize 
the first stretch downstream the dam (Fig. 1), with 
about 18 km length, as a straight type, while further 
downstream the river becomes anastomosed, with 
increasing sinuosity downstream the dam.

Regarding the hydrossedimentological cha-
racterization, according to Lima et al. (2004) this 
stretch of the Tocantins River shows low suspended 
sediment concentration and discharge. Based on 
measurements taken at the Tucuruí station from 
1981 to 1998, the mentioned author reports mean 
values of 9 mg/L for sediment concentration and 
8.388 tons/day for suspended sediment discharge.

647 ARCHITECTURAL RIVERBED FACIES OF THE TOCANTINS RIVE

It is worth mentioning that the same parameters 
measured at the Itupiranga station, upstream 
the reservoir, are 48 mg/L and 46.737 tons/
day, respectively. The difference between the 
two stations is explained by the retention of the 
suspended sediment load in the reservoir basin.

Such low values of suspended sediment load 
downstream the dam lead to think that in this part 
of the river the sedimentation process is largely 
determined by bed load, being the dissolved 
load of minor importance in the Brazilian rivers 
(Christofoletti 1981).

On the other hand, downstream the dam, the 
decrease of the suspended load turns the waters into 
“sediment starved”, with the consequent erosion of 
margins and the river bed until the local sediment 
production balances the transport potential of the 
flow (Williams and Wolman 1984).

On such basis, it is possible to infer that the 
features detected in the seismic survey must be 
associated to the period before the closing of the dam 
or originated from the erosion and re-mobilization 
of river bed forms downstream the dam.

The aim of this work is to describe acoustic 
and architectural facies of the river bed, associated 

to sediment transport and deposition mechanisms, 
considering the impact of such factors on the 
installation of a waterway.

GEOLOGICAL SETTINGS

The study area is located in the center-north portion 
of Pará State, at the occidental margin of the 
Parnaíba Basin. The geological framework includes 
the basement of the Parnaíba Basin, as well as the 
Cainozoic successions related to the Barreiras 
Group and the alluvium of the Tocantins River.

According to Barbosa et al. (1966) and Rezende 
(1998), the area corresponds to a transition region 
between the crystalline basement - Xingu Complex, 
situated in the left margin of the river, and a volcanic-
sedimentary sequence with low metamorphic grade 
related to the Tucuruí Formation. The Paleogene 
deposits, as well as quaternary sediments, compose 
the alluvium. Table I shows the synthesis of the 
stratigraphy of the study region.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The shallow seismic method was adopted to 
survey the area using a high resolution seismic 
profiler interfaced with a WADGPS (Wide Area

SEISMIC RECORDS DESCRIPTION

The high-resolution seismic profiles show two 
principal units. The top of Unit 1 is a strong and 
continuous reflector (Fig. 2-a), interpreted as 
the acoustic basement (bedrock). The surface of 
such unit shows an evident roughness (Fig. 2-b), 
which influences the turbulence of the flow and 
the transport of the bed load. The outcrops indicate 
erosion areas or sediment by-pass. Topographical 
depressions of the exposed basement can cause 
sediment retention (Fig. 2-c).

The top of Unit 2 is formed by a continuous and 
regular reflector, with several parallel layers (Fig. 2-e) or 
cross stratifications (Fig. 2-f), interpreted as top of bars 
composed of well-sorted layers of fine to medium sand 
separated by layers of coarser and poorly sorted sand. 
The internal reflections show parallel or sub-parallel 
reflections, marked by the presence of prograding 
clinoforms, oblique sigmoid bodies and large scale 
(decameters) parallel and crossed stratification, related 
to planes of deposition reactivation.

The contact between Unit 1 and 2 occurs in a 
gradual transition region (Fig. 2-d), where the width 
of sediments increases with the transition from the 
plane bed (Fig. 2-e) to transversal bars (Fig. 2-f), as 
a consequence of increased sediment load.

The WADGPS is a satellite broadcast technique of

The Edgetech 3100P sub-bottom profiler, 
equipped with the tow-vehicle SB-216, was operated 
with a “chirp” pulse of bandwidth 2-15kHz, and 
achieved a penetration up to 10 m in sandy bottom, 
with about 10 cm resolution.

Accurate positioning was obtained by using the 
DGPS receiver Trimble DSM 232 with the satellite 
differential correction Omnistar HP, attaining 
accuracy of about 20cm on average.

Positioning and seismic systems were interfaced 
via Hypack navigation software, which allowed real 
time referencing of the seismic profiles, as well as 
the survey planning and the on-line navigation.

The survey was carried out along navigation 
lines parallel to the river canal (thalweg), and 
some transversal lines were run to verify the cross-
continuity of sedimentary structures.

More than 120 km of seismic lines were 
acquired in a stretch of about 40 km between the 
city of Tucuruí and the village of Nazaré dos Patos.

The seismic records clearly show the internal 
structure of river bars, where the variation of acoustic 
impedance that generates the reflections must be due 
to changes in the sedimentation regime associated 
to cyclic events. The observation of emerged and 
partly eroded bars along the river (Fig. 3) allowed 
the identification of a sediment layer poorly sorted,

with a thickness of a few decimeters, which could 
be associated to extreme discharge events, flooding 
of the margins, erosion and deposition reactivation.

Considering that the presence of the hydro-
electric reservoir has a regulatory effect on the 
flow and floods, it could be supposed that such 
events were related to the period before the 
reservoir configuration.

DESCRIPTION OF SEISMIC FACIES AND ARCHITECTURAL 

ELEMENTS

The integration of seismic sections with the infor-
mation acquired in sparse outcrops in bar cuts and 
beaches shows that the fluvial system is widely 
dominated by sand deposition. The pelitic materials 
(silt and clay) are certainly present in the deposition 
systems as a whole, but its sedimentation is limited to 
inundation flats, which were not included in this paper 
that focused the study on the active river channel.

In the surveyed portion of the active channel it 
was possible to detect three conditions of transport-
deposition, including by-pass areas, with enhanced 
erosion and transport, deposition areas, with the 
accumulation of sand in different flow conditions, 
and transition areas associated to the interposition 
of the former ones.

As the resolution of the seismic survey only 
detects forms thicker than 10 cm and that extend 
for at least a few meters, the architectural elements 

will be described according to the fluvial facies 
denomination proposed by Miall (1978, 1985).

Along the river, downstream the Tucuruí dam, 
the following sand facies dominate: St (cross-stratified 
sandstone), Sp (planar cross-stratified sandstone), Sh 
(horizontally stratified or laminated sandstone) and 
Se (sandstone in erosional channel). Regarding the 
architectural elements, the following bed forms are 
observed: sandy bed-forms (SB), channel element 
(CH), downstream accretion element (DA), lateral 
accretion (LA) and laminated sand sheets (LS).

It is worth mentioning that, as distinct bedforms 
are strictly linked to the paleo-topography of the 
bedrock, and according to the observation of 
seismic profiles where the bedrock is detectable, 
beds of dunes and bars are associated to an irregular 
bedrock topography.

Examples of seismic profiles in different con-
texts, with the respective description of facies and 
sedimentary processes are described below. Both 
vertical and horizontal scales on profiles are in meters.

By-Pass Environments

In the by-pass environments, the erosion processes 
dominate the transport via mechanisms such as 
traction and suspension. Generally, in such enviro-
nments, the bedrock is locally exposed and the depth 
reaches 20m. The by-pass environments are mostly 
observed in the main canals, and seldom occur

near the margins. The main canals can occur in the 
central portion of the current fl uvial bed, but in other 
cases they can result in strong asymmetries, with the 
thalweg displaced towards one of the margins.

Figure 4 shows an example of a by-pass enviro-
nment, where the riverbed shows a rough profi le, 
and there are no refl ectors indicating sediment 
accumulation. In Figure 4 there is a clear tendency 
that highlights the inclined planes towards the North 
(slant dashed lines), which are interpreted as schist 
foliation planes or a high-density fracture system.

Channels deeper than 10m can occur locally, 
being interpreted as the product of a combined 
action of fl ow turbulence and current vortices. 
Figure 5 shows an example of such structure. It is 
also possible to observe the structural trend present 
in the bedrock. In the NNE section, at a depth 
slightly more than 10m, a small channel fi lled with 
sand can be observed.

At the frontal portion of the bars the refl ectors 
present an inclination towards the deeper part of the 
channel, showing the migration tendency of such 
macroforms, which represent the depositional areas 
that result in longitudinal accretion architectural 
elements (DA) composed of Sh, St and Sp facies 
type. The sedimentary process dominating the 
formation of the macroforms is of traction and 
saltation type, in which the deposition occurs 
because of the gradual decrease of energy.

It is interesting to observe that the bar in the 
center of Figure 7 (vertical exaggeration 6:1) has

is rocky. Such feature is associated to the region of 
bedrock weakness (fault zone or contact of rocks 
with different resistance to erosion).

by pass in an area of large depth gradients.

Deposition Environments

with internal refl ectors that defi ne plane-parallel 
layers (dashed lines) that can be internally 
laminated or compose sets of cross layers of a 
lower order (dotted lines).

Figure 7 - Example of bar structures composing an architectural 
element of longitudinal accretion. 

When the fl uvial channel becomes deeper that 
20m, the reduced fl ow and transport capacity allow 
the beginning of deposition processes. Figure 6 
shows an example of such environment where in 
the center of the valley occurs the fi lling with coarse 
sandy materials or the mixing of sand and silt. At 
the North and South of the channel, the river bed

about 6m height relative to the thalweg, with a 
slope of the slip face of about 50% (27°).

The example in Figure 8 shows a site with thin 
a deposition directly above the acoustic basement 
(dash-dot line), which is here characterized by an 
irregular topography. In this case, horizontal layers 
(dashed lines) dominate the internal bar structure. 
The undulated top of the bedform (continuous 
line) shows a set of transversal bars, orthogonal 
to the main migration direction of the flow, which 
represent a sequence of architectural elements of 
lateral accretion with the migration of sandy facies 
due to the grain traction.

of cut-and-fill bearing facies and channels changes 
to cross and horizontal strata.

Figure 10 illustrates a case in which a 
succession of architectural facies of channel type 
(CH), with the predominance of Se facies at SSW, 
migrates to architectural elements of longitudinal 
accretion (DA) towards NNE, with the dominance 
of sandy St and Sp facies type. The abrupt increase 
in depth observed in the NNE part of the profile is 
interpreted as a recent erosional channel.

Some profiles, as illustrated in Figure 9, show 
big clinoforms that highlight the time line, with 
the longitudinal bedforms migration arranged in 
macro undulations. The most evident reflectors 
are interpreted as sedimentation reactivation plans 
(dashed lines), with a strong seasonal periodicity 
and the widespread dominance of St and Sp facies 
type (dotted lines).

In the SW portion of the profile the bar 
top shows a series of dunes as a response to the 
flow turbulence. In the NE side of the profile the 
horizontal bedding is considered as an evidence of 
predominant laminar flow, which gives origin to the 
architectural element of laminated sand (LS) type.

The variation on the flow regime and current 
nature that changes from laminar to turbulent is 
confirmed by the presence of sections in which a set

that give origin to cut-and-fill channels. The texture is of fine sand, 
with sigmoidal structures, cross stratifications and truncations.

The central part of Figure 11 shows a set of 
Sh (dashed lines) facies that forms an architectural 
element of LS type interpreted as a seasonal 
aggradation of sandy layers. At both NE and SW 
ends, excellent examples of large cut-and-fill 
channels (dotted lines), limited by continuous and 
evident reflectors, are evident.

In areas of minor depth (about 5m) and more 
uniform currents, the bedforms are composed by 
a set of transversal bars with varying length and

depth. Basement topography seems to exert some 
control on depth that shows a tendency to decrease 
with the increasing of the bedrock depth. Figure 13 
shows an example of such transition environment 
where complex sedimentary facies (dashed lines) 
follow the outcropping basement (dash-dot line).

amplitude of up to 2.5m. In 3-D, such fea-tures appear 
as linguoids with a superimposed asymmetrical dune 
system. Internally such bars show plane-parallel 
layers with cross and horizontal laminations.

The bedform migration due to the traction 
flow is considered as the main transport component 
in such sections where both macroforms and 
mesoforms migrate downstream.

Transition Environments

Transition environments are formed in intermediate 
areas between depositional and by-pass enviro-
nments and can occur along the longitudinal axis 
of the river, as well as transversal to the active 
canal. Two factors control the deposition in these 
environments: resistance variation of the local 
basement material and lateral/longitudinal changes 
of energy and current strength.

Figure 12 presents an example of a transition 
environment characterized by irregular basement 
topography (dash-dot line), in which sedimentary 
deposit thickness varies from sub meter to more 
than 10m downstream. This set forms architectural 
facies classified as sandy bed (SB) with large 
dominance of Sh and Sl facies (dashed lines).

Locally, the transition environments are 
observed downstream of long stretches of rocky 
bed, and present complex sequences of sandy 
facies, with dipping reflectors forming sigmoids 
indicating the balance between flux energy and

FINAL REMARkS

The lower course of the Tocantins River can be 
classified as anastomosed, due to the presence of 
mid-channel stable islands and channel deposition 
dominated by sand, with pelitic deposition being 
relevant just in the inundation plains.

In particular, along the study area, downstream 
the city of Tucuruí and the Tucuruí dam, it is 
observed the progressive plain form evolution from 
the straight to anastomosed river channel pattern.

RESUMO

Até hoje, a maior parte dos estudos de sedimentologia 
fluvial tem adotado dois principais métodos de 
investigação: observação direta de trincheiras, faces 
expostas e testemunhos, ou levantamento geofísico 
nas regiões emersas ou rasas das barras fluviais. 
Neste estudo, um perfilador acústico de subfundo 
foi utilizado para investigar a estratigrafia do baixo 
curso do Rio Tocantins, na bacia Amazônica, entre 
a cidade de Tucuruí e a vila de Nazaré dos Patos. O 
interesse neste trecho do rio reside na possível variação 
do regime fluvial devido à instalação da barragem 
da usina hidrelétrica de Tucuruí e à perspectiva de 
que este rio se torne navegável após a conclusão da 
construção da eclusa. Os perfis coletados mostram 
detalhes da variedade e complexidade de elementos 
arquiteturais e a estrutura interna das macroformas 
arenosas. Além disso, os resultados permitiram a 
identificação de três ambientes correlacionados com os 
processos sedimentares ativos no canal: ambientes de 
by-pass, transição e deposição, que estão relacionados 
à dinâmica do canal e topografia do embasamento. A 
aplicação deste estudo é multíplice, uma vez que fornece 
informações sobre a estrutura sedimentar das formas 
aluvionais e histórico de deposição, mostra elementos 
necessários ao planejamento de eventuais intervenções 
para a navegabilidade do rio.

the closing of the dam (Brasil 1974) with recent 
ones (LANDSAT ETM+) did not show significant 
changes in the channel pattern. On the other hand, 
the geophysical survey allowed the identification 
of erosional, depositional and transitional areas, 
longitudinally intercalated and transversal to the 
current river channel.

The presence of such environments seems to 
be related to the distance to the dam, although the 
pre-existing waterfall might have played a similar 
role in trapping the upstream bed load, as suggested 
by the maintenance of the channel pattern. In the 
first eighteen kilometers downstream the dam, 
seismic records show the predominance of by-
pass environments possibly related to erosional 
effect of sediment unsaturated flux. Further 
downstream, the equilibrium in the sedimentary 
load could have been re-established by the erosion 
of both bedrock and river margins. Here seismic 
records show the continuous presence of sandy 
transversal channel bars.

The methodology used showed that high-
resolution seismic profilers could be used to study 
the internal structure of sand bars in alluvial river 
channels. Collected data show the impressive 
variety and complexity of architectural elements 
and internal structure of sandy macroforms.

The results allowed the identification of three 
main environments linked to channel sedimentation 
processes: by-pass, transition and deposition 
environments whose distribution is related to 
channel dynamics and bedrock topography. The 
application of the study is manifold once it provides 
not only an insight into sedimentary structure 
of alluvial forms and sedimentation history, but 
also elements demanded to planning eventual 
engineering works for river navigability.

Furthermore, the results encourage developing 
further this kind of research, including integration 
of GPR methods to study emerged alluvial bars and 
coring to provide information on time-evolution of 
sedimentation processes.
