RESUMO  

 

A cinética de lixiviação de concentrados de zinco (sulfetados e silicatados) foi estudada 
no presente trabalho. Primeramente, foram avaliados os efeitos de temperatura, 
concentrações de íon férrico e ácido sulfúrico, velocidade de agitação e tamanho de 
partícula sobre a cinética de lixiviação de um concentrado sulfetado em soluções ácidas 
de sulfato férrico. O processo de lixiviação pôde ser separado em dois estágios. 
Inicialmente, a cinética de dissolução do concentrado sulfetado era controlada por 
reação química na superfície das partículas de sulfeto de zinco. Posteriormente, a 
cinética de dissolução era controlada pela difusão do íon férrico através da camada de 
enxofre elementar (camada de cinza) formada na superfície do sólido. A energia de 
ativação da etapa controlada por reação química foi de 6,6kcal/mol (27,5kJ/mol) e o 
valor encontrado para o estágio final, controlado por difusão do reagente na camada de 
produto foi de 4,7kcal/mol (19,6kJ/mol). As ordens de reação com respeito à 
concentração de íon férrico e ácido sulfúrico eram cerca de 0,50 e 1,00, 
respectivamente. As análises de MEV-EDS das partículas de sulfeto “in natura” e 
lixiviadas mostraram um progressivo aumento da espessura da camada de enxofre 
elementar sobre a superfície do sólido. A formação desta camada de enxofre era uma 
evidência adicional da mudança da etapa controladora do processo de dissolução do 
sulfeto com o progresso da reação. Também foi estudada a cinética de lixiviação do 
concentrado calcinado de silicato de zinco, incluindo os efeitos do tamanho de partícula 
(0,038–0,075mm), temperatura (30oC–50oC) e concentração inicial de ácido (0,2–1,0 
mol/L). Os resultados mostraram que a redução do tamanho de partícula aumenta 
levemente a velocidade de lixiviação, enquanto a temperatura e a concentração de ácido 
sulfúrico têm uma grande influência na dissolução. À medida que ocorre a lixiviação, há 
uma progressiva dissolução da willemita mantendo-se as fases ricas em quartzo e ferro 
praticamente inertes. Dentre os modelos cinéticos aplicados a sólidos porosos testados 
no presente trabalho, o “modelo do grão” com controle por difusão nos poros descreveu 
de forma satisfatória a cinética de dissolução do concentrado calcinado silicatado de 
zinco. Através da utilização deste modelo, foi  possível determinar a energia de ativação 
e ordem de reação com respeito a concentração de ácido sulfúrico, obtendo os valores 
de 50,7kJ/mol e 0,64, respectivamente, os quais são, provavelmente, conseqüências da 
natureza paralela dos processos de difusão e reação química no sólido poroso. Além 
disto, os estudos de lixiviação do silicato de zinco mostraram que o teor de ferro no 
concentrado silicatado de zinco não afeta a extração de zinco, uma vez que a cinética de 
dissolução dos concentrados com alto teor (10-11%) ou baixo teor (3%) é similar. A 
energia de ativação encontrada para a lixiviação do concentrado de alto ferro, 
13,1±5,1kcal/mol, era estatisticamente igual àquela observada para o material com 
baixo teor de ferro, 16,0±2,2kcal/mol, sugerindo que o processo de dissolução de ambos 
os materiais seja controlado pela mesma etapa controladora. As análises estatísticas dos 
experimentos de lixiviação mostraram que o aumento do teor de ferro no silicato de 5% 
para 9% não resultou em redução significativa nas extrações. Para os concentrados de 
baixo teor, a extração foi de 98,5% enquanto que para os de alto teor foi de 97,5%. 
Além disto, o concentrado com alto teor de ferro viabiliza uma maior recuperação de 
massa durante o processo de flotação do minério silicatado. Foi proposta uma nova rota 
tecnológica para utilização de concentrado com alto teor de ferro, que inclui a remoção 
de impurezas (Ge, As, Sb), eliminando a necessidade de integração com processo RLE.

ABSTRACT 
 
 

The leaching kinetics of zinc concentrates (suphides and silicates) was studied. Firstly, 
the effects of temperature, ferric ion and sulphuric acid concentrations, agitation speed 
and particle size on the leaching kinetics of a zinc sulphide concentrate in acid ferric 
sulphate medium were investigated. The leaching process could be separated into two 
stages. Initially, the dissolution kinetics was controlled by the chemical reaction at the 
surface of the zinc sulphide particles followed by a second step where the reaction was 
controlled by diffusion of the reagents or products through the elemental sulphur (ash) 
layer. The activation energy of the chemical controlled step was 6.6kcal/mol 
(27.5kJ/mol) and the value determined for the diffusion controlled step was 4.7kcal/mol 
(19.6kJ/mol). The reaction order with respect to ferric ion and sulphuric acid 
concentrations were approximately 0.50 and 1.00, respectively. Analysis of the 
unreacted and reacted sulphide particles by SEM-EDS showed a progressive increase of 
the thickness of the elemental sulphur layer on the solid surface. The development of 
this sulphur layer was a further evidence of the change on the rate-controlling step as 
the reaction progress. Also studied was the leaching kinetics of the zinc silicate calcine 
including the effects of particle size (0.038–0.075mm), temperature (30oC–50oC) and 
initial acid concentration (0.2–1.0 mol/L). The results showed that decreasing particle 
size slightly increases the leaching rate, while temperature and acid concentration have 
a stronger effect on dissolution. As leaching occurs, there is a progressive dissolution of 
willemite while the quartz and iron-containing phases remain inert. Among the kinetic 
models for porous solids tested, the grain model with porous diffusion control 
successfully described the zinc dissolution kinetics. The model enabled the 
determination of an activation energy and reaction order with respect to sulphuric acid 
values of 50.7kJ/mol and 0.64, respectively, which are likely a consequence of the 
parallel nature of diffusion and chemical reaction in porous solids. In addition, zinc 
silicate leaching studies have shown that the iron content in zinc silicate concentrates 
does not affect zinc extraction as the dissolution kinetics of concentrates with either 
high (10-11%) or low iron (3%) content are similar. The activation energy determined 
for the high-iron concentrate leaching, 13.1±5.1kcal/mol, was statistically similar to that 
observed for the low-iron material, 16.0±2.2kcal/mol. This suggests that the leaching of 
both solids presents the same rate-controlling step. The statistical analysis of the 
leaching experiments showed that increasing the iron content of the silicate from 5% to 
9% iron does not result in a significant reduction in extractions, as 98.5% zinc 
dissolution was achieved for the low-iron concentrate. In the meantime, a zinc 
extraction of 97.5% was observed for the high-iron sample. Furthermore, high iron 
contents in the silicate concentrate enable a higher mass recovery during flotation. A 
flowsheet was proposed utilizing the high iron content of the silicate to remove 
impurities during the hydrometallurgical processing of zinc silicates.

1.  INTRODUÇÃO 
 

1.1. Lixiviação de concentrados sulfetados de zinco 
 

Atualmente, mais de 80% da produção mundial de zinco é proveniente do tratamento de 

concentrado sulfetado, onde a esfalerita (Zn2Fe)S2 é o mineral predominante (Dutrizac, 

2005). O processo hidrometalúrgico tradicional de tratamento de concentrados 

sulfetados de zinco compreende a ustulação, lixiviação e eletrólise (Feneau, 2002), 

denominado RLE (“Roasting, Leaching and Electrolysis”). Basicamente, este processo 

inclui a ustulação dos sulfetos de zinco, produzindo óxidos dos metais e dióxido de 

enxofre. Este último é convertido em ácido sulfúrico (H2SO4).  A reação química da 

etapa de ustulação é a seguinte: 

 

ZnS(s) + 1,5O2(g)  ?  ZnO(s)  +  SO2(g)                           (1.1) 

 

O calcinado (ZnO) produzido de acordo com a equação 1.1 é enviado para etapas de 

lixiviação, seguido de purificação, eletrólise e fusão, produzindo o zinco SHG (“special 

high grade”), de alta pureza, com no mínimo 99,995% em zinco. As reações principais 

das etapas de lixiviação neutra (1.2) e ácida (1.3) são (Feneau, 2002): 

 

ZnO(s) + 2H2SO4(aq)?  ZnSO4(aq)+ H2O(aq)                                   (1.2) 

ZnO.Fe2O3(s) + 4H2SO4(aq) ?  Fe2(SO4)3(aq)+ ZnSO4(aq)+ 4H2O(aq)        (1.3)

Contudo, a rota RLE tem algumas restrições ao tratamento dos concentrados de zinco, 

especialmente aqueles com elevados teores de sílica, cálcio, cobre e ferro. Também a 

emissão de SO2 deste processo e o mercado de ácido sulfúrico são desafios para o futuro 

desta tecnologia (Feneau, 2002). 

 

Devido a estas restrições e à dependência do processo RLE com relação à produção de 

ácido sulfúrico, vem havendo um crescente interesse nas técnicas de lixiviação direta de 

concentrados sulfetados de zinco. Na lixiviação direta, o íon sulfeto não se converte em 

ácido, mas em enxofre elementar, de fácil estocagem. Como alternativa, duas rotas 

similares foram propostas nos anos 70:  (i) Lixiviação Direta Amosférica (Svens et al., 

2003) na qual os concentrados sulfetados de zinco são lixiviados diretamente com 

solução de ferro férrico, produzida durante as etapas de lixiviação ácidas do processo 

RLE;  e (ii) Lixiviação Direta Sob Pressão, que adota um conceito similar, exceto que a 

lixiviação é conduzida em autoclaves (14-15 atm).  

 

As reações de lixiviação direta dos concentrados sulfetados de zinco ainda não estão 

totalmente compreendidas, embora haja um acordo generalizado de que a reação do 

sulfato férrico com a esfalerita tem um papel importante no processo de dissolução de 

zinco (Dutrizac, 2005).  Neste caso, a lixiviação direta do ZnS pelo Fe(III) pode ser 

representada pela equação 1.4:  

 

 Fe2(SO4)3(aq) + ZnS(s) ? 2FeSO4(aq) + ZnSO4(aq) + S°(s)                 (1.4) 

 

Oxigênio gasoso (93-98%) é geralmente usado para reoxidar o ferro ferroso, obtido 

através da equação 1.4, regenerando o Fe(III), segundo equação 1.5. 



  
3 

 
 

2 FeSO4(aq) + H2SO4(aq) + 0.5O2(g)  ? Fe2(SO4)3(aq) + H2O(l)                    (1.5) 

 

A reação global de lixiviação pode ser representada pela equação 1.6. 

 

ZnS(s)  + H2SO4(aq) + 0.5O2(g)  ? ZnSO4(aq) + H2O(l) + S°(s)                   (1.6) 

 

A elevada pressão de oxigênio, verificada no processo de lixiviação sob pressão 

proporciona um menor tempo de residência, da ordem de 90 minutos. De modo 

contrário, o processo de lixiviação direta atmosférica requer cerca de 24 horas para que 

a reação se complete. Desta forma, os reatores de lixiviação direta atmosférica são 

muito maiores quando comparados com o tamanho de autoclaves do processo de 

lixiviação sob pressão (Svens et al., 2003).  

 

O emprego da tecnologia de lixiviação sob pressão teve início em escala industrial no 

ano de 1981, na unidade de Cominco Trail, em Trail, British Columbia, no Canadá, 

onde se integrou com o sistema existente de ustulação-lixiviação-eletrólise RLE (Svens 

et al., 2003). A mesma tecnologia, porém sem integração com o processo RLE, está 

também em operação na unidade industrial de Flin Flon, em “Hudson Bay”, desde 

1993. Uma outra usina de lixiviação sob pressão foi instalada no Cazaquistão, em 2003 

(Svens et al., 2003). 

 

Já a lixiviação direta atmosférica foi implementada em 1994, na unidade industrial da 

“Onsan Korea Zinc”, na Coréia do Sul. Em 1998, o processo foi implantado na unidade 

industrial de Kokkola, na Finlândia e, mais recentemente, na unidade industrial de 



  
4 

 
 

“Odda Zinc”, na Noruega, sendo que no total já se produz mais de 200 mil toneladas de 

zinco por ano por esta tecnologia. (Svens et al., 2003). 

 

Ambos os processos de lixiviação direta atmosférica e sob pressão, são considerados 

marcos na indústria global do zinco. Além disto, o custo de capital “capex” (“capital 

expenditure”) são mais baixos para se implantar a lixiviação direta de concentrados 

sulfetados de zinco. Entretanto, o custo operacional “opex” (“operating and 

maintenance costs”) tem sido considerado relativamente elevado devido principalmente 

ao grande consumo de oxigênio, matéria-prima relativamente cara (Souza et al., 2007). 

 

A fim de reduzir o “opex”, uma combinação entre biolixiviação e lixiviação química 

direta de concentrados sulfetados de zinco foi proposta por Souza et al. (2007), como 

um processo de custo mais competitivo do que as tecnologias de lixiviação direta 

atmosférica ou sob pressão. A biolixiviação parcial do concentrado sulfetado de zinco 

num processo contínuo, com microrganismo mesófilo, capaz de oxidar o íon ferroso, foi 

estudada pelos autores. Os resultados demonstraram ser possível projetar uma nova 

tecnologia capaz de obter até 96% de recuperação de zinco, extração similar ao processo 

convencional RLE. 

 

Em termos de lixiviação direta, é raro encontrar artigos publicados com estudos para os 

concentrados sulfetados de zinco da América do Sul. A cinética de lixiviação por íon 

férrico para outras fontes de sulfetos de zinco tem sido descrita por diversos autores 

(Dutrizac, 1992; Dutrizac, 2005; Markus et al., 2004; Perez and Dutrizac, 1991). É 

consenso que o enxofre elementar é o principal produto de oxidação e o ferro contido na 

esfalerita tem um papel chave durante a lixiviação. Foi observado que a temperatura 



  
5 

 
 

aumenta a velocidade de reação, mas os valores de energia de ativação registrados 

variam amplamente (Perez and Dutrizac, 1991). Ademais, apesar do efeito da 

concentração de ácido na dissolução do zinco estar bem caracterizado, a ordem de 

reação com respeito à concentração de ácido sulfúrico foi pouca estudada (Crundwell, 

1988).  

 

1.2  Lixiviação dos concentrados de silicato de zinco 

 

Sabe-se que mesmo antes do século 20, os minérios não-sulfetados já eram importante 

fontes de zinco no mundo, sendo constituídos de uma mistura de silicatos, carbonatos e 

óxidos, especialmente calamina. Zinco era produzido em minas espalhadas na Europa e 

utilizado para produzir latão, ligas de zinco-cobre-estanho. As tecnologias recentes para 

tratar os silicatos de zinco, como o “Processo integrado de tratamento de concentrados 

de silicato e sulfetos de zinco”, em operação na unidade industrial de Três Marias, no 

Brasil, e MZP (“Modified Zincex Process”) que utiliza extração por solventes e 

implantado na unidade industrial de “Skorpion Zinc”, na Namíbia, têm proporcionado 

renovado interesse comercial nestes materiais. O foco econômico é indubitável para os 

depósitos de zinco oxidados, devido às muitas vantagens sobre os depósitos de sulfetos 

(Boni, 2005): 

 

? Alto teor de zinco se comparado com os sulfetos (zinco &gt; 10%). 

? Em geral, pode ser explorado em mineração a céu aberto. 

? Devido à baixa dureza, necessitariam pequenas perfuratrizes/explosões.  

? Possuem forma natural de “cut off”. 

 



  
6 

 
 

Em breve, a produção anual de zinco através de fontes de não-sulfetados deve exceder a 

10% da produção mundial do metal (Boni, 2005). As minas de Vazante, no Brasil, estão 

produzindo 150 mil toneladas de zinco em 2007 e projetam extrair 200 mil toneladas do 

metal contido já em 2010, a partir de silicatos de zinco, cujo concentrado é enviado para 

a unidade industrial de Três Marias. Também a “Skorpion Zinc”, na Namíbia, está 

produzindo atualmente mais de 160 mil toneladas de zinco a partir de silicatos e 

carbonatos, para alimentar seu processo de extração por solventes. Somente as 

contribuições destas duas indústrias já representam mais de 3% da produção global do 

metal. 

 

Os concentrados não-sulfetados são difíceis de serem tratados, devido aos elevados 

níveis de sílica, germânio e antimônio contidos e os custos de seu processamento podem 

ser elevados, por não gerarem créditos de ácido sulfúrico, como no tratamento dos 

concentrados sulfetados. A alternativa encontrada pela Votorantim Brasil, na década de 

90, para solucionar tais problemas, foi usar as vantagens da integração com o tratamento 

de concentrados sulfetados, devido à geração de ácido sulfúrico e o elevado poder 

purificante do calcinado (ZnO), na etapa de Lixiviação Neutra. O fluxograma da 

integração em uma das possíveis rotas é mostrado na figura 1.1. 

 

Usando também minerais não-sulfetados, como carbonatos e silicatos, a empresa 

Técnicas Reunidas (TR), da Espanha, desenvolveu o Processo Zincex Modificado, 

chamado de MZP, e implantou a técnica na unidade de “Skorpion Zinc”, em 2003. O 

processo usa um solvente orgânico (DEHPA, dissolvido em querosene), sendo que o 

fluxograma resumido do processo é mostrado na figura 1.2.

A cinética de dissolução de fontes de zinco não-sulfetadas tem sido bem menos 

estudada do que as de sulfetos do metal. Terry and Monhemius (1983) estudaram a 

cinética de lixiviação de hermimofita natural, bem como willemita sintética e natural. 

Os autores observaram que a dissolução em ácido era controlada por difusão para 

hemimorfita e reação química para a willemita. Abdel-Aal (2000), estudando a cinética 

de lixiviação de silicatos de zinco de baixo teor, propôs que o processo era controlado 

por difusão na camada de cinza com uma energia de ativação associada de 13.38 

kJ/mol. Entretanto, não ocorria a formação de nenhum produto sólido durante a 

lixiviação do silicato de zinco, mas somente íons zinco e sílica foram produzidos, 

embora a última possa afetar as propriedades de transporte da solução, devido à 

elevação na viscosidade da mesma. O autor não apresentou uma explicação para o 

controle proposto por difusão na camada de produto. É possível que a difusão através 

dos poros do sólido seja uma explicação para os controles observados durante a 

lixiviação. Tem sido mostrado, que se o transporte através dos poros dos sólidos for a 

etapa controladora, uma expressão similar ao modelo do núcleo não reagido (“shrinking 

core model”- SCM)  com controle por difusão pode ser obtida (Youcai and Stanforth, 

2000). 

 

Embora não haja referência à influência do ferro durante a lixiviação no processo 

integrado de tratamento de sulfetos e silicatos da Votorantim Metais Brasil, o interesse 

pelo processo hidrometalúrgico para tratar concentrado silicatado com elevado teor de 

ferro se tornou notável a partir da observação de que o plano de lavra da Mina de 

Vazante, no Brasil, indicava a ocorrência de elevados níveis do elemento no material a 

ser lavrado e que seria posteriormente submetido ao processo de flotação, anteriormente 

ao processo hidrometalúrgico da unidade de Três Marias. 



  
9 

 
 

Do ponto de vista acadêmico, é importante conhecer a influência do teor de ferro nos 

concentrados de silicato de zinco sobre a extração de zinco e a cinética de dissolução 

dos mesmos. Um novo conceito de tratamento de concentrados de silicato e sulfetos 

será apresentado visando à eliminação de impurezas e aumento da proporção de silicato 

no processamento de concentrados de zinco, podendo-se se obter um mix de até 100% 

concentrado silicatado na alimentação. 

 

1.3. Objetivos e organização da tese 
 

Considerando a matéria-prima (minérios e concentrados) como um dos itens mais 

importantes para a metalurgia do zinco e também a especificidade da indústria brasileira 

em tratar concentrados sulfetados e silicatados, esta tese tem os seguintes objetivos: 

 

? Estudar a cinética de lixiviação, aplicando modelos cinéticos - do núcleo não 

reagido e do grão, de concentrados sulfetados e silicatados de zinco, 

determinando os valores de energia de ativação e ordem de reação para os 

reagentes utilizados na lixiviação de silicatos e sulfetos. 

 

? Avaliar a lixiviação de concentrados silicatados com baixos e altos teores de 

ferro (até 9%), propondo uma rota tecnológica inovadora para o tratamento dos 

concentrados com elevados teores do elemento. 

 

Neste sentido, a tese foi organizada em capítulos, sendo que no Capítulo 2 será 

apresentado o trabalho entitulado “The leaching kinetics of a zinc sulphide concentrates 

in acid ferric sulphate”. Neste artigo, será aplicado o modelo do núcleo-não reagido 



  
10 

 
 

(“Shrinking Core Model - SCM”), com controle por reação química e difusão na 

camada de produto, e o método das velocidades iniciais, para descrever a cinética de 

dissolução do concentrado sulfetado. 

 

No Capítulo 3, será apresentado o trabalho, entitulado “Kinetics study of the sulphuric 

acid leaching of a zinc silicate calcine”. O tema central será a proposição de utilização 

do modelo do grão, para descrever o comportamento cinético da lixiviação de um 

concentrado calcinado de silicato de zinco, em meio sulfúrico.  

 

No capítulo 4, o trabalho “The effect of the iron content in zinc silicate concentrate 

leaching with sulphuric acid”, tratará da influência do teor de ferro na cinética de 

lixiviação do concentrado de silicato de zinco em meio sulfúrico. Um novo processo 

para o tratamento de concentrados silicatados com elevados teores de ferro, é proposto 

visando o tratamento exclusivo de concentrados silicatos, sem a necessidade de 

integração com tratamento de concentrados sulfetados. Uma versão modificada destes 

capítulos foi aceita para publicação no periódico Hydrometallurgy.

THE LEACHING KINETICS OF A ZINC SULPHIDE CONCENTRATE IN 

ACID FERRIC SULPHATE 

 

Abstract 

 

This work examines the dissolution kinetics of a zinc sulphide concentrate in acid ferric 

sulphate medium. The effects of temperature, ferric ion and sulphuric acid 

concentrations, agitation speed and particle size on the leaching kinetics were 

investigated. The leaching process could be separated into two stages. Initially, the 

dissolution kinetics was controlled by the chemical reaction at the surface of the zinc 

sulphide particles followed by a second step where the reaction was controlled by 

diffusion of the reagents or products through the elemental sulphur (ash) layer. The 

activation energy of the chemical controlled step was 6.59kcal/mol (27.54kJ/mol) and 

the value determined for the diffusion controlled step was 4.68kcal/mol (19.56kJ/mol). 

The reaction order with respect to ferric ion and sulphuric acid concentrations were 

approximately 0.50 and 1.00, respectively. Analysis of the unreacted and reacted 

sulphide particles by SEM-EDS showed a progressive increase of the thickness of the 

elemental sulphur layer on the solid surface. The development of this sulphur layer is 

further evidence of the change on the rate-controlling step as the reaction progress.

2.1. Introduction 
 

The route Roasting, Leaching, Electrolysis (RLE) has been the main process of 

producing metallic zinc since 1916 and is currently responsible for more than 85% of 

the total zinc production (Souza et al., 2006). Notwithstanding, the RLE route has many 

restrictions to treat zinc concentrates high in silica, calcium, copper and iron. Also, the 

prevention of SO2 emission from the process and marketing of sulphuric acid are 

challenging the future of this technology (Deller, 2005).  

 

Over the last few years, several innovative leaching processes have been proposed, such 

as, bioleaching and chemical leaching as an integrated process (Souza et al., 2006), 

persulphate leaching (Babu et al., 2002), heap bioleaching (Lizama et al., 2003; 

Madhuchbanda et al., 2003), sulphide and silicate leaching integration (Souza, 2005) 

and solvent extraction for zinc recovery from oxide ores (Garcia et al., 2000). Some of 

these innovations have made the zinc industries more competitive. Others, however, 

require further development. For instance, the Três Marias Zinc Plant (Votorantim 

Group in Brazil) is in the first quartile of lowest metallurgical costs as it uses a new 

technology integrating sulphide and silicate concentrate treatment. Likewise, Skorpion 

Zinc (Anglo American Group), in Namibia, has started its solvent extraction technology 

and it is expected to be the metal producer with the lowest cost (Brook Hunt, 2005). 

 

Regarding chemical leaching, two similar routes were proposed in the 1970’s to 

produce zinc as a substitute for the RLE process: (i) Direct Atmospheric Leaching 

(Svens et al., 2003) in which zinc sulphide concentrates are leached directly with a 

ferric ion solution; and (ii) Pressure Leaching that adopts a similar approach (Baldwin 



  
14 

 
 

et al., 1995), except that leaching is carried out in autoclaves (14-15atm oxygen 

pressure).  

 

The kinetics of ferric ion leaching of sphalerite concentrates has been described by 

several authors (Dutrizac, 1992; Dutrizac, 2005; Markus et al., 2004; Palencia Perez and 

Dutrizac, 1991). It is agreed that elemental sulphur is the main oxidation product and 

the iron content plays a key role during leaching. Many authors have observed that 

temperature increases the leaching rate, however the reported values of activation 

energy varies widely (Palencia Perez and Dutrizac, 1991). Furthermore, the effect of 

acid concentration on zinc dissolution is also well characterized but the reaction order 

with respect to the sulphuric acid concentration has been determined only by few 

researchers (Crundwell, 1988).  

 

The objective of this work was to assess the effects of some parameters such as 

temperature (40 - 90ºC), ferric ion concentration (0.10 - 1.00mol/L), particle size, 

sulphuric acid concentration (0.25 - 1.00 mol/L) and agitation speed (240 - 600min.-1) 

on the dissolution kinetics of a zinc sulphide concentrate. The Shrinking Core Model 

(SCM) with chemical reaction control and product layer diffusion control as well as the 

initial rate (IR) method were used to describe the dissolution kinetics of this 

concentrate.  

 

2.2. Reaction Model 
 

The leaching of zinc sulphide in ferric sulphate solutions includes a heterogeneous

A major feature of this system is that the chemical reaction step and mass transport are 

coupled in series. Besides, one may assume that the solid particle retains its initial shape 

and that the chemical reaction occurs in a sharp interface between the original solid and 

the reaction product.  Further assuming that the zinc sulphide particles have a spherical 

geometry and the chemical reaction is the rate-controlling step, the following expression 

of the shrinking core model can be used to describe the dissolution kinetics of the 

process (Levenspiel, 1999):

Similarly, when the diffusion of ferric ion through the elemental sulphur layer is the 

rate-controlling step, the following expression of the shrinking core model can be used 

to describe the dissolution kinetics (Levenspiel, 1999):

this case – reaction (2.1)), ks = chemical reaction rate constant, [Fe(III)] = ferric ion 

concentration, ?ZnS = molar density of ZnS, r0 = particle radius; n = order of reaction 

with respect to Fe(III) and Deff = effective diffusion coefficient.

In order to compare the values of activation energy and reaction order obtained from 

equations (2.2) and (2.3) the initial rate of the zinc sulphide dissolution was determined 

at different temperatures and ferric ion concentrations. The initial rate parameters were 

determined by fitting the experimental data to a hyperbolic equation:

Where: [Zn] = zinc concentration, t = time, k1 and k2 = constants. 

 

The initial dissolution rate is the slope of equation (2.4), at t = 0. That means the ratio 

between k1 and k2 (k1 / k2 = K), since the first derivate of equation (2.5) is:

and for all purposes, K can be written as K = A.k.[Fe3+]n where A stands for area of 

reaction, k for a Arrhenius temperature dependent constant, [Fe3+] for the ferric ion 

concentration and n for order of reaction.

2.3. Experimental 
 

Table 2.1 presents the chemical analysis of the bulk concentrate. Before leaching, the 

concentrate was dry-ground and wet-sieved to yield a particle size distribution between 

210µm and 38µm. The zinc, iron and sulphur content of the different particle size 

fractions of the zinc sulphide concentrate are presented in table 2.2. Average zinc and 

iron concentrations are 48% and 12%, respectively.

The mineralogical analyses of the concentrate were carried out by SEM-EDS. The 

samples were coated with graphite by electro-deposition, using a Jeol JEE 4C 

instrument and observed in a JEOL JSM 5510 scanning electron microscope (SEM) 

with an accelerating voltage 0.5 – 30kV and equipped with a spectrometer for micro-

analysis based on a energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy system (EDS). Sphalerite is 

the main mineral phase and pyrite, quartz and galena were also present in minor 

quantities. Table 2.3 presents the electron microprobe analysis of isolated sphalerite 

particles. The difference between the iron content observed by chemical (table 2.2) and 

EDS analysis (table 2.3) is due to the presence of small quantities of pyrite in the zinc 

concentrate. In addition, table 2.4 presents the values of surface area, micro pores 

volume and micro pores area determined by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm 

obtained from a Nova 1000 High Speed Gas Sorption Analyser (Quantachrome). The 

trends of surface area follow that of the particle porosity. A large sample (~4.0g) was 

used and the Nova 1000 parameters: equilibration tolerance, time to remain in tolerance 

and maximum equilibration time were set at 0.05, 360 and 720, respectively, to improve 

the accuracy of the low surface area measurements.

The chemical leaching experiments were carried out batchwise in a closed water-jacket 

borosilicate glass reactor with 750mL total volume. The solution volume was 500mL 

and the solid concentration 0.5% (w/v). Agitation was provided by a magnetic stirrer 

because mechanical stirring showed similar results but higher evaporation losses. 

Leaching solutions were prepared using reagent grade chemicals (Fe2(SO4)3.5H2O and 

H2SO4, Synth) and distilled water. At selected time intervals, a known amount (3mL) of 

slurry was withdrawn and filtered. For every sample taken from the reactor, an equal 

volume of blank solution was returned to the vessel so that the experiments were carried 

out at constant volume. The zinc extraction was determined by analyzing zinc 

concentration in solution (Atomic Absorption Spectrometry, Perkin Elmer AAnalyst 

100). 

 

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the morphology of the 

leaching residues. The samples were coated with graphite by electro-deposition, using a

Jeol JEE 4C instrument and observed in a JEOL JSM 5510 scanning electron 

microscope (SEM), with an accelerating voltage 0.5 – 30kV, equipped with a

system (EDS). 

 

2.4. Results and discussion 
 

2.4.1. Effect of agitation speed 
 

Figure 2.1 presents the effect of stirring speed on zinc extraction. The increase of 

stirring speed in the range of 240-600rpm does not increase the zinc extraction. 

Therefore, the dissolution process does not seem to be controlled by mass transfer 

through the liquid boundary film. Therefore, in all the posterior experiments, the stirring 

speed was kept at 480 rpm.

2.4.2. Effect of temperature 
 

Figure 2.2 shows the change on zinc extraction with the leaching time as function of 

temperature in the range of 40ºC to 90ºC. These results show that temperature has a 

major role on the zinc dissolution process. The zinc extraction is relatively low in the 

experiments carried out at 40ºC (45%) but significantly increases as the leaching 

temperature rises and a high zinc extraction was observed at 90ºC (90%). Similar results 

were observed by Dutrizac and MacDonald (1978), Bobeck and Su (1985) and 

Aydogam et al. (2005) in leaching experiments carried out in ferric chloride solutions; 

by Palencia Perez and Dutrizac (1991) and Dutrizac (2005) in studies performed in 

ferric sulphate medium; and by Babu et al. (2002) with ammonium persulphate 

solutions.

2.4.3. Effect of acid concentration 
 

Figure 2.3 presents the effect of sulphuric acid concentration upon the zinc extraction as 

function of leaching time at a constant Fe(III) concentration. It can be seen, that zinc 

extractions increase gradually with the leaching time and sulphuric acid concentration 

indicating that an appreciable quantity of zinc sulphide could be dissolved by sulphuric 

acid (Dutrizac, 2005). The direct acid dissolution of zinc sulphide produces H2S, in the 

absence of oxygen, rather than elemental sulphur. Nevertheless, as there was no solution 

degassing in the present work, the equation (2.6) has likely took place despite a weak 

hydrogen sulphide smell in the beginning of the experiments: 

 

ZnS + H2SO4 + 1/2O2 = ZnSO4 + S

Dutrizac (2005) studied the effect of sulphuric acid concentration upon sphalerite 

dissolution in ferric sulphate medium. The author observed that the zinc dissolution 

kinetic parameters, determined by the shrinking core model with chemical reaction 

control, were independent of acid concentration for acid concentrations smaller than 

0.10mol/L since the hydrolysis of ferric sulphate produced acidity by itself. However, 

for acid concentration above 0.10mol/L, the dissolution rate increases with the latter. 

Dutrizac (2005) attributed the faster kinetics to the existence of a parallel dissolution 

reaction involving H2S acid production  and its subsequent oxidation by Fe(III), as 

represented by equations (2.7) and (2.8). If the acid dissolution plays a key role during 

the zinc sulphide dissolution, the elemental sulphur produced was not stuck at the 

particle surface. In contrast, the SEM/EDS analysis showed the existence of an 

elemental sulphur layer covering the particles during the leaching process. Similarly, 

Babu et al. (2002) also verified that the zinc extraction is function of sulphuric acid 

concentration, in experiments carried out in ammonium persulphate solutions. 

 

ZnS + H2SO4 = ZnSO4 + H2S                                              (2.7) 

Fe2(SO4)3 + H2S = 2FeSO4 + H2SO4 + S
o                                     (2.8) 

 

2.4.4. Effect of particle size 
 

Figure 2.4 presents the effect of the concentrate particle size on zinc extraction. The 

decrease in particle size enhanced the zinc dissolution, but it can be seen that particle 

size plays a minor role in the leaching process. The zinc extraction observed in the 

experiment carried out with the particle size between 38-45µ m is only around 10% 

higher than that achieved in the experiment performed with particle size in the range of 



  
24 

 
 

210-150µ m. The small difference observed is, probably, due to the negligible increase 

of solid surface area (BET surface area) with decreasing particle sizes as an effect of 

porosity and natural cracks (table 2.4 and figure 2.5). Porosity of the concentrate would 

not be a factor in the shrinking core model (SCM) applied to these experiments since it 

takes into consideration a sharp interface reaction. However, reactant porosity plays an 

important role if the reaction interface is diffuse, meaning that the oxidation reaction 

proceeds inside the pores. Massaci et al. (1998) also verified the non-significance of the 

effect of particle size in a factorial experiment carried out with a zinc sulphide ore in 

ferric sulphate media. The authors credited this behaviour to the presence of a natural 

porosity in the structure of the zinc sulphide particles (as observed in the present work, 

figure 2.5), but surface area and porosity data were not presented. Another important 

factor that must be considered is the high reactivity of sphalerite that could have 

reduced the effect of particle size upon the zinc extraction (Aydogan et al., 2005; 

Bobeck and Su, 1985; Ghosh et al., 2002; Silva, 2004).

2.4.5. Effect of ferric ion concentration 
 

Ferric ion is a powerful oxidant used in the dissolution processes of several metallic 

sulphides such as: chalcopyrite, covellite, bornite, sphalerite, etc. The leaching reaction 

directly involves ferric ions, and it would be expected that the ferric sulphate 

concentration would have an important role in the zinc sulphide dissolution process. 

Figure 2.6 presents the effect of ferric ion concentration on zinc extraction as function

of leaching time. It can be noticed that zinc extraction increases gradually with the 

leaching time and ferric ion concentration which is consistent with that observed by 

Dutrizac and MacDonald (1978), Palencia Perez and Dutrizac (1991), Aydogam et al. 

(2005) and Dutrizac (2005).

2.4.6. Morphology of the leaching residues 
 

The morphology of the zinc sulphide concentrate before and after leaching was 

examined by SEM-EDS (figure 2.7). The particles of the zinc sulphide concentrate 

before the leaching process present a clear surface and have approximately the same 

form and size (figure 2.7 (a)). After the leaching progress, the micrographs of the 

leaching residues show a progressive increase in the roughness of the solid and also an 

increase in the amount of elemental sulphur covering the particle surfaces (figures 

(2.7(b) to 2.7(f)). After 45% zinc extraction (figure 2.7(d)), the particles present their 



  
27 

 
 

surface completely covered by an elemental sulphur layer, as proposed previously by 

Bobeck and Su (1985) and Crundwell (1987).

2.4.7. Kinetics analysis 
 

Dutrizac and MacDonald (1978) proposed that, during the oxidative leaching of ZnS, 

elemental sulphur would be formed preferably than sulphate, according the equation 

(2.1). The authors also determined that around 85% to 95% of the sulphide is oxidized 

into elemental sulphur. During the initial step of dissolution, the quantity of elemental 

sulphur produced is very low so that the diffusion resistance is small. As reaction 

proceeds, sulphur covers the zinc particle (figure 2.8) and as this layer increases in 

thickness, the diffusion of reagents or products through it may become the rate-

controlling step. Therefore, it may not be reasonable to consider that just one step, 

chemical reaction or diffusion through the elemental sulphur layer, would control the 

entire process.

process. However, as stated before, during ferric sulphate leaching of sphalerite, it is 

observed that the elemental sulphur produced during the sulphide dissolution has an 

important role in the final stages of leaching (Bobeck and Su, 1985; Crundwell and 

Verbaan, 1987; Silva, 2004) so that a model that considers both the chemical reaction 

and diffusion of ferric ion through the elemental sulphur layer would be more realistic. 

If the chemical reaction is first-order with respect to ferric ion concentration the model 

is constructed by the addition of the terms that represent the resistances due to chemical 

reaction and diffusion, since they act in series and are linear in concentration. This 

approach was used by Bobeck and Su (1985) to describe the leaching of sphalerite in 

ferric chloride solution. In a recent work, Silva (2004) also used the same approach to 

study the leaching of zinc sulphide in ferric sulphate solution, although the process was 

not linear in concentration since a reaction order of 0.50 with respect the ferric ion 

concentration was determined by the author. Therefore, the simple addition of the 

resistance terms, as used by Silva (2004), although can produce a mixed control model 

that fits well the experimental results, is physically biased. Unfortunately, the 

mathematical solution for mixed control, considering fractionary reaction orders usually 

requires a numerical solution. A different approach was used by Weisener et al. (2003)  

that observed two distinct rate regimes for the sphalerite leaching in perchloric acid 

solutions: a fast rate followed by a slow one. The authors attributed the decrease in the 

zinc dissolution rate to the formation of a thick continuous metal-deficient polysulfide 

surface layer, which was formed during the fast initial leaching phase and reached a 

steady state thickness in the subsequent slow rate stage. Unlike other studies, Weisener 

et al. (2003) did not consider that the presence of an elemental sulphur layer contributes 

to any noticeable effect on the leaching rate. This behaviour was also noticed by other 

authors modelling sphalerite chemical kinetics such as Bobeck and Su (1985), 



  
31 

 
 

Crundwell (1987). The approach was to split the extraction curve in two different 

segments and to perform a piecewise fitting to a chosen SCM limiting case.   

 

The approach used Weisener et al. (2003)  and other authors was also used in the 

present work. 40% zinc extraction was chosen as the value where the kinetics changed 

from chemical to diffusion control. Figure 2.8 shows a mineral particle with an 

elemental sulphur layer covering a ZnS core, after 40% zinc extraction. The whole 

particle was covered by an elemental sulphur layer which is consistent with the 

proposed change in the kinetics regime at this zinc extraction.     

 

Figure 2.9 shows that the shrinking core model with reaction control fits the 

experimental data in the initial part of leaching (up to 40% of zinc extraction). Also, 

figure 2.9 shows that the shrinking core model with product diffusion control fits the 

experimental results in the final stages of leaching in agreement with the results 

observed by Crundwell (1987) and Bobeck and Su (1985) that verified that the 

sphalerite leaching by ferric chloride was chemically controlled in the initial stages of 

the process and later by diffusion in the product layer. The morphological analysis of 

the leaching residues (figure 2.7) reinforces the assumption that the zinc dissolution 

process is controlled by chemical reaction at initial stages and by diffusion through the 

elemental sulphur layer at later stages.

Temperature has an important effect on the dissolution rate of sphalerite and, as 

expected, an increase in the temperature causes an elevation in the dissolution rate. The 

reaction rate dependence on the temperature follows the Arrhenius equation 

(Levenspiel, 1999). This influence is expressed by the activation energy of the reaction. 

In general, a high value of activation energy indicates that the process is “strongly” 

influenced by temperature and therefore the rate-controlling step would be the reaction 

at the mineral surface. Conversely, a low value of activation energy indicates that the 

process is “weakly” influenced by the temperature and the rate-controlling step could be 

the mass transport of reagents or products through the reaction product (Levenspiel, 

1999). Figure 2.10 presents the Arrhenius plot constructed with the rate constants 

values, KR and KD, calculated from equation (2.2) and (2.3) and the initial dissolution 

rate values, V0, determined from equation (2.4). The values of KR were calculated using 

data of the initial stages of dissolution (up to 40% of zinc extraction) while the values of

KD were obtained from data coming from the later stages (above 40% of zinc 

extraction). The activation energy observed in the chemical reaction controlled step is 

6.59kcal/mol (27.54kJ/mol) and the value determined in the product diffusion 

controlled step is 4.68kcal/mol (19.56kJ/mol). The activation energy calculated by the 

initial rate method is 6.00kcal/mol (25.08kJ/mol), similar to the value determined by the 

SCM assuming chemical reaction controlled step. The activation energy regarding the 

initial step of dissolution is higher than that observed for the final stages of leaching, 

which is in agreement with a chemical reaction controlling step followed by a product 

diffusion controlling step, as presented in figure 2.9. This similarity would be expected 

because in the initial stages of leaching, the elemental sulphur layer is very fine or 

nonexistent. Therefore, the activation energy value calculated with the KR and V0 

represents the apparent activation energy for the zinc sulphide dissolution reaction. The 

value of activation energy determined in this work is smaller than those obtained 

previously, as shown in Table 3.. Very low values of apparent energy of activation can 

be associated to a reaction mechanism including adsorption of reactants followed by 

chemical reaction itself. Furthermore, it must be mentioned that the activation energy 

decreases at higher iron contents in the mineral (Bobeck and Su, 1985; Palencia Perez 

and Dutrizac, 1991).

From the analysis through the shrinking core model with chemical reaction control 

(equation (2.2)) and with product diffusion control (equation (2.3)), there is a clear 

dependence of the model constants, KR and KD, on particle size. According to the SCM, 

leaching kinetics for a diffusion-controlled step is related to the inverse square of initial 

particle radius (r0), while those processes controlled by chemical reaction show that KR 

varies with the inverse of the initial particle radius. Figure 2.11 presents the plot of KR 

versus 1/r0 and KD versus 1/r0
2, respectively. It can be seen from the figure 2.11 that 

both rate constants (KR and KD) produced a linear relationship with the particle size 

terms (1/r0 and 1/r0
2), further supporting the assumption of chemical reaction control 

during the initial stages and by diffusion in the elemental sulphur product layer during 

the later stages of dissolution.

The results of the experiments carried out with different ferric ion concentrations were 

also fitted to the shrinking core model with chemical reaction control (equation (2.2)) 

and with the hyperbolic function (equation (2.4)) so that the KR an V0 values could be 

estimated and used to determine the reaction order with respect the Fe(III) 

concentration. Figure 2.12 shows the Log versus Log plot from which the reaction order 

with respect to ferric ion concentration was determined from both KR and V0 values. As 

it is seen the reaction order determined by both methods (0.54 and 0.55 from the initial 

rate and shrinking core model, respectively) are similar and close to 0.50 and similar to 

those values available for the oxidative leaching of base metal sulphides (Aydogan et 

al., 2005; Dutrizac, 2005; Dutrizac and MacDonald, 1978; Rath et al., 1988). Similarly, 

Figure 2.13 presents the effect of sulphuric acid concentration on the KR and V0 values. 

From these values, the reaction orders were determined by both the initial rate method

the zinc sulphide leaching rate with the sulphuric acid concentration. However, the 

authors did not determine the reaction order with respect to this reagent.

2.5. Conclusions 
 

In the present study, the dissolution kinetics of sphalerite in acidic ferric sulphate 

solution was studied. It was found that the zinc extraction increases with the increase in 

ferric ion concentration, temperature and sulphuric acid concentration. The decrease in 

the particle size enhanced zinc dissolution, but played only a marginal role in the 

leaching processes. This is probably due to the porosity and natural cracks of the solid, 

which increased surface area even at higher particle size. The shrinking core model with 

reaction control fitted the experimental data in the initial part of leaching (up to 40% of 

zinc extraction) and the shrinking core model with diffusion control fitted the 

experimental results in the final stages of leaching. The analysis of the zinc sulphide 

particles before and after leaching carried out by SEM-EDS supported the observed 

change of control. The particles presented a surface completely covered by an elemental 

sulphur layer after 40-50% zinc extraction.  



  
38 

 
 

The observed reaction orders were 1.00 and 0.50 with respect to sulphuric acid and 

ferric ion concentrations, respectively. The apparent activation energy determined in the 

chemical reaction controlled step was 6.59kcal/mol (27.54kJ/mol) and the value 

obtained for the diffusion controlled step was 4.68kcal/mol (19.56kJ/mol). As the 

activation energy found in the initial phase of dissolution process is higher than the 

value observed in the final stages of leaching it reinforces that the process is chemically 

controlled during the initial stage and diffusion controlled at the final stage of leaching.

A KINETICS STUDY OF THE SULPHURIC ACID LEACHING OF A ZINC 

SILICATE CALCINE 

 

Abstract 

 

The recent developments of acid-leaching and solvent extraction of zinc silicate ores 

have produced renewed commercial interest in these ores. Notwithstanding, the leaching 

kinetics of these concentrates have received little attention so far. This work sought, 

therefore, to address the leaching of a zinc silicate concentrate in sulphuric acid. The 

effects of particle size (0.038–0.075 mm), temperature (30–50oC) and initial acid 

concentration (0.2–1.0 mol/L) were studied. The results show that decreasing the 

particle size while increasing the temperature and acid concentration increase the 

leaching rate. As leaching occurs, there is a progressive dissolution of willemite while 

the quartz and iron-containing phases remain inert. Among the kinetic models of the 

porous solids tested, the grain model with porous diffusion control successfully 

described the zinc leaching kinetics. The model enabled the determination of an 

activation energy of 51.9 ± 2.8 kJ/mol and a reaction order of 0.64 ± 0.12 (with respect 

to sulphuric acid), which are likely to be a consequence of the parallel nature of 

diffusion and chemical reaction in porous solids. 

 

Key words: zinc silicate, grain model, diffusion control, willemite.

3.1. Introduction 
 

Non-sulphide zinc deposits are genetically classified into two categories. One is the 

supergene deposits, derived from zinc sulphides. The other class is formed by the so-

called hypogene deposits, recognized as non-sulphide zinc minerals (formed by 

willemite or a willemite-franklinite-zincite-gahnite association). The recent 

developments of acid leaching (Votorantim, Brazil) and solvent extraction (Tecnicas 

Reunidas, Spain) of zinc silicate concentrates have produced renewed commercial 

interest in these ores. Within the foreseeable future, the annual production of zinc from 

non-sulphide sources could vastly exceed 10% of global metal production (Boni, 2005). 

Accordingly, Votorantim Metais Zinc (VMZ) has devised an integrated process to treat 

both zinc sulphides and silicates (Souza et al., 2007). The process consists of the 

leaching of zinc silicate ores (willemite, Zn2SiO4, and hemimorphite, 

Zn4Si2O7(OH)2.H2O), in the same plant that treats zinc sulphide concentrates through 

the traditional RLE (roasting-leaching-electrolysis) process.  

 

In the integrated process (Souza, 2000), as calcium and magnesium carbonates are 

present in the zinc concentrate, this concentrate is treated with zinc wash solution (about 

45g/L of zinc) to obtain a slurry. This slurry is submitted afterwards to a step where zinc 

is precipitated as basic zinc sulphate (ZnSO4.3Zn(OH)2.4H2O, (Chen and Dutrizac, 

2003))  while the magnesium remains in  the solution as its respective sulphate 

(equation 3.1).  

 

3ZnSO4 + 0.5Zn2SiO4 + 7H2O + CaCO3 + MgCO3 ????  ZnSO4.3Zn(OH)2.4H2O + 

0.5SiO2 +  CaSO4 + MgSO4 + 2CO2    (3.1) 



  
42 

 
 

Zinc is precipitated at 95ºC or alternatively, at 180-200ºC and 18 bar pressure, so that 

basic zinc sulphate is readily formed (Souza, 2000). The influent wash solution pH is 

5.0 and reaches pH 6.6 after neutralization by the carbonates, present in the silicate 

concentrate, which results in zinc precipitation from the wash solution. The basic zinc 

sulphate is dissolved afterwards with a 180g/L sulphuric acid solution, which has been 

returned from the electrolysis step (spent solution) of the RLE process. After thickening 

and filtration, the clarified solution is sent to the neutral leaching (pH 4.0) step of the 

RLE process, completing the integration of the sulphide and non-sulphide concentrate 

treatment (Souza, 2000). 

 

Direct silicate leaching with sulphuric acid can be represented by equations (3.2) and 

(3.3) for hemimorphite and willemite, respectively.  

 

Zn4Si2O7(OH)2.H2O + 4H2SO4 ? 4ZnSO4 + Si2O(OH)6 + 3H2O                    (3.2)   

Zn2SiO4 + 2H2SO4 ? 2ZnSO4 + Si(OH)4                                           (3.3) 

 

The monosilic acid (Si(OH)4), produced in equation (3.3), polymerizes and may form 

particles of colloidal silica (Espiari et al., 2006). Besides, a gel is formed which is not 

filterable. Much effort has been applied to precipitate silica without forming the latter. 

Some authors have suggested the use of flocculants, as aluminium sulphate, to remove 

the silica gel while others have proposed the use of microwave radiation for the same 

purpose (Hua et al., 2002). 

 

The kinetics of zinc silicate dissolution is far less studied than that of zinc sulphides. 

Terry and Monhemius (1983) have comprehensively studied the leaching kinetics of  



  
43 

 
 

natural hemimorphite, as well as natural and synthetic willemite. The authors have 

observed that the acidic dissolution was diffusion-controlled for hemimorphite and 

chemically-controlled for willemite leaching. Abdel-Aal (2000), studying the leaching 

kinetics of low grade zinc silicate, proposed that the process was controlled by diffusion 

on an “ash” layer with an associated activation energy of 13.4 kJ/mol (3.2 kcal/mol). As 

shown in equations (3.2) and (3.3), there is no solid reaction product formed during 

leaching, as only zinc ions and silica gel are produced, although the latter can affect the 

transport properties of the solution. It should be pointed out that Abdel-Aal (2000) did 

not present an explanation for the  proposed diffusion control in the product layer. It is 

also possible that diffusion through the solid’s pores would explain the controls 

observed during silicate leaching. It has been shown that if the transport through a 

solid’s pores is the rate-determining step, an expression similar to the shrinking core 

model (SCM) with diffusion control (Georgiou and Papangelakis, 1998) is achieved.  

 

This work addresses the leaching kinetics of a zinc silicate calcine which can be 

represented by a variant of the SCM when diffusion through the product layer is the 

rate-determining step.  

 

3.2. Materials and Methods 
 

The zinc silicate calcine, assaying 43.5% Zn (table 1), was produced by roasting a zinc 

silicate floatation concentrate in a rotatory kiln at temperatures of 700-800oC, for 60 

minutes aiming at removing organic matter. XRD of the calcine showed the presence of 

willemite (Zn2SiO4) as the main zinc-containing phase and franklinite (ZnO.Fe2O3) as a 



  
44 

 
 

minor constituent. This was based on the iron content of the zinc silicate calcine (table 

3.2). Hematite and magnetite as well as quartz and dolomite constituted the gangue.

Prior to the leaching experiments, the zinc calcine was dry-ground and wet-sieved to 

yield a particle size distribution between 150 µm and 38 µm. The zinc and iron content 

as well as surface area, total porous volume and porous average diameter of the 

different sieved fractions are also depicted in table 3.2. The chemical leaching tests 

were carried out batchwise in a closed water-jacket borosilicate glass reactor with 750 

mL total volume, and agitation was provided by a magnetic stirrer. That enabled 

adequate dispersion of the mineral particles without evaporation loss of the solution. 

The leaching temperature was evaluated in the range of 30 to 60oC and the acid 



  
45 

 
 

concentration between 0.2 and 1.0 mol/L was studied. The solution volume was 500 mL 

and the solid concentration, 10 g/L. Leaching solutions were prepared using reagent 

grade chemicals (H2SO4, Synth) and distilled water. At selected time intervals, a known 

amount (3 mL) of slurry was withdrawn and filtered. The first sample was taken after 

30 seconds of contact between the solid and solution, and 10 seconds was required for 

each sampling and filtration procedure. The zinc extraction was determined by 

analyzing zinc concentration in solution (Atomic Absorption Spectrometry, Perkin 

Elmer AAnalyst 100) and for every sample taken from the reactor, the volume change 

was taken into account in the zinc extraction determinations, which were calculated 

based on the mass of zinc dissolved as function of time, according to the following 

equation:

Surface area and pore volume were determined by nitrogen adsorption. Nitrogen 

isotherms were performed with a Nova 1000 High Speed Gas Sorption Analyzer 

(Quantachrome). Sample degassing was carried out at 80oC, for 24 hours, to avoid 

decomposition. Nitrogen adsorption was performed at -196°C. Data were collected from 

a relative pressure (p/p0) of 0.05 to 0.98. A large sample (~4.0g) was used and the Nova 

1000 parameters (equilibration tolerance, time to remain in tolerance and maximum 

equilibration time) were set at 0.05, 360 and 720, respectively, to improve the accuracy 

of low surface area measurements with nitrogen adsorption. 

 

The analyses of the silicate calcine and leaching residues were carried out by SEM-

EDS. The samples were coated with graphite by electro-deposition, using a Jeol JEE 4C

instrument and observed in a JEOL JSM 5510 scanning electron microscope (SEM), 

equipped with a spectrometer for micro-analysis based on a Energy dispersive x-ray 

spectroscopy system (EDS), and having an accelerating voltage 0.5-30kV. Electron 

microprobe analysis have confirmed willemite as the main zinc mineral since the metal 

content of different grains is similar to that of a pure mineral (theoretical, table 3.3).

3.3. Results and discussion 
 

3.3.1. Effect of agitation speed 
 

Figure 3.1 shows the effect of the stirring speed on zinc dissolution. The increase of the 

stirring speed in the range 360 - 720 rpm does not increase zinc extraction. Therefore, 

the dissolution process does not seem to be controlled by mass transfer through the 

liquid boundary layer, despite the change in solution viscosity caused by the formation 

of silica gel. As a result, the stirring speed was kept at 480rpm, unless otherwise stated.

implying that temperature has an important role in the zinc dissolution process. Similar 

results were observed by Bodas (1996) and Espiari et al. (2006), that carried out 

leaching experiments with a zinc silicate ore containing hemimorphite 

(Zn4Si2O7(OH)2.H2O) and smithsonite (ZnCO3) as major zinc minerals. Similarly, 

Abdel-Aal (2000) studied the leaching of a zinc silicate ore containing willemite and 

hemimorphite and observed that as temperature was increased from 40 ºC to 70 ºC, zinc 

extraction enhanced from 70 to 95%.

Figure 3.3 presents the effect of the sulphuric acid concentration on zinc extraction as a

concentration, in the range being assessed in this study. This behaviour was observed in 

previous works, carried out by Bodas (1996), Abdel-Aal (2000) and Espiari et al.

(2006), in experiments performed in a sulphuric acid medium. Terry and Monhemius 

(1983) studied the effect of sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric and hydrochloric acid 

concentrations upon zinc dissolution from natural willemite samples. The authors 

observed that the zinc dissolution rate was strongly dependent on both acid 

concentration (the increase in the proton concentration enhanced the zinc dissolution 

rate) and the acidic anion (SO4
2-, PO4

3-, Cl- and NO3
-). The following reactivity order 

was observed by the authors with respect to the acidic anion: HCl ? HNO3 &amp;lt;HClO4 &amp;lt;

H2SO4 ? H3PO4. Terry and Monhemius (1983) suggested that the difference in the 

reactivity order was in function of the complex affinity for the zinc ion.

µ m, is only 7% higher than that obtained in the experiment carried out in the 75 – 53 

µ m range. The small difference observed can be likely ascribed to the negligible 

increasing of the particle surface area (BET surface area) with decreasing particle sizes 

as an effect of the porosity of the solid (table 3.2). Massaci et al. (1998) also observed 

the insignificance of particle size on the leaching kinetics, while they were studying a 

zinc sulphide ore leaching in ferric sulphate media. The authors credited this behaviour 

to the presence of a natural porosity in the zinc sulphide particles, but they did not 

present surface area and porosity analysis. Usually, the literature shows that the smaller 

the particle size, the faster the reaction rate, as observed by Abdel-Aal (2000). The high 

reactivity of the roasted silicate in sulphuric acid medium associated to a small 

difference in the surface area of the different size fractions, could have masked the 

effect of particle size upon the zinc leaching rate (Aydogan et al., 2005; Bobeck and Su, 

1985; Ghosh et al., 2002; Silva, 2004).

3.3.5. Morphology of the leaching residues 
 

The morphology of the zinc silicate calcine particles before and after leaching was 

examined by SEM-EDS. The solid particles present a rough and porous surface 

generated by the calcination process that resulted in the sintering of the small particles 

found on the surface of the larger ones, as observed in the figures 3.5(a) and (b). The 

micrograph of the leaching residues shows a progressive increase in the roughness and 

porosity of the solid. For instance, after 45% zinc extraction (figures 3.5(c) and (d)), the 

particles present a high degree of degradation, that sharply increases along the progress 

of dissolution (figure 3.5(e) and (f)). In spite of the surface degradation generated by the 

leaching process, figures 3.5(a-f) suggest that the particle surface does not present a 

reaction product layer. Notwithstanding, as shown in the XRD patterns (figure 3.6) of 

the zinc silicate and the leaching residues (after 1 and 3 minutes), willemite is 

selectively leached, while the quartz and iron-containing phases (hematite and 

magnetite) remain as an “ash” layer. Therefore, it is proposed that the zinc dissolution 

process be controlled by diffusion of the reagent in the porous structure of the calcine 

particles, as observed by (Georgiou and Papangelakis, 1998) in pressure leaching 

experiments carried out with limonitic laterite ores.

3.3.6. Kinetics analysis 
 

The leaching of zinc silicate calcine in sulphuric acid solutions includes a heterogeneous 

reaction as represented by equations 3.2 and 3.3. Assuming that the zinc silicate 

particles have a spherical geometry and the chemical reaction is the rate-controlling 

step, the following expression of the shrinking core model can be tested to describe the 

dissolution kinetics of the process:

Similarly, when the diffusion of the reagent through a product layer is the rate-

describe the dissolution kinetics:

According to equations 3.5 and 3.6, when chemical reaction is the rate-controlling step, 

a plot of [1-(1-?)1/3] versus time is a straight line with a slope kR. Conversely, when the 

process is controlled by diffusion through the solid product layer, a plot of [1-3(1-

?)2/3+2(1-?)] versus time is also a straight line whose slope is kd (Levenspiel, 1999). 

Furthermore, for all purposes, k can be written as k = A.k0.[H2SO4]
n where A stands for 

area of reaction; k0 for the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor; [H2SO4] for acid 

concentration and n for reaction order. 

 

Figure 3.7 presents the fitting of the SCM model with chemical reaction control 

(equation 3.5) and product diffusion control (equation 3.6) to the experimental data. It is 

readily noticed that the model for product diffusion control depicted a better outcome as 

compared to the one for chemical reaction control. Nevertheless, the dissolution of the 

zinc silicate calcine occurs without the formation of a product layer, as shown in figure 

3.5. Therefore, this model is not consistent with the physical picture of the process, 

despite the mathematical fitting of the experimental data to the SCM equation for 

product diffusion control. Thus, equation 3.6 is unlikely to physically represent the 

reacting system and a different model, which takes into account the effect of porosity, 

should be tested so that the zinc silicate leaching can be adequately described. In the 



  
55 

 
 

latter, the aqueous reactant diffuses and reacts concomitantly so that diffusion and 

chemical reaction occurs in parallel, instead of in series, as predicted by the shrinking 

core model applied to non-porous solids  (Sohn and Wadsworth, 1979). 

Figure 3.7. Fitting of the shrinking core and grain models. Temperature 40 ºC, 0.4 

mol/L H2SO4, 10 g/L solids, stirring rate 480 rpm and particle size 75-53 µm. 

 

Several models have been proposed to describe the leaching kinetics of porous solids, 

such as: (i) the random pore model, (ii) the uniform pore model and (iii) the grain 

model. The random pore model could not be applied to represent the leaching process as 

observed elsewhere (Filippou et al., 1997). The uniform pore model with chemical 

control was also tested to describe the leaching kinetics, but did not produce a good fit 

to the experimental data, as observed in other hydrometallurgical systems (Filippou et 

al., 1997; Raghavan and Gajam, 1986). The grain pore model will be discussed further 

on. 

 

Modelling porous solids leaching kinetics, Sohn and Wadsworth (1979) stated that the

associated to diffusion is small. If the diffusion resistance is large, conversely, the 

reaction occurs in a narrow layer near the external surface because the reactant cannot 

penetrate deeply inside the pores before reacting. Assuming that external mass transfer 

is fast and that this layer is much thinner than the particle dimensions, the authors 

proposed the following equation for the overall rate (ri):

In equation 3.7, k is the chemical rate constant, and therefore the overall rate is 

increased even when k is large (the reaction is fast), which means that diffusion alone 

does not control the overall rate, a consequence of the parallel nature of the chemical 

reaction and diffusion in porous solids (Sohn and Wadsworth, 1979). An important 

outcome of equation 3.7 is that both the activation energy and reaction order of the 

process are an average of the values associated with the chemical reaction and diffusion 

steps.  

 

The grain model (Szekely et al., 1976) can also be applied to describe the leaching 

kinetics of porous solids. It considers that the solid reactant is made up of a large 

number of individual grains of the same size and form, which are similar to the exterior 

form of the particle (i.e. a spherical particle is formed by spherical non-porous grains). 

When the reaction is chemically controlled, there is no resistance for diffusion 

throughout the pores, the fluid reactant concentration is uniform in the whole solid, and 

an expression similar to equation 3.5 is produced. Nevertheless, if chemical reaction 

resistance is negligible, as compared to that due to pore diffusion, the reaction occurs in 

a narrow region and this situation is similar to the shrinking core model with ash layer

As shown in figure 3.7, a good fit (r2 &gt; 0.97) is observed when the left hand of equation 

3.11 is applied to the experimental data. Furthermore, from the analysis of equation 

3.11, there is a clear dependence of the model constant, kD, with the inverse square of 

initial particle radius (1/r0

obtained from the linear fitting of the data present in the figure 3.4 into equation 3.11. It

Figures 3.9 presents the Arrhenius plot constructed with the rate constant value, kD, 

calculated from data presented in figure 3.2. The activation energy determined for the 

pore diffusion control is 51.9 ± 2.8 kJ/mol (12.4 ± 0.7 kcal/mol). This value is similar to 

those obtained by Terry and Monhemius (1983), that found 49.2kJ/mol (11.8kcal/mol) 

and 39.0kJ/mol (9.3kcal/mol) for the dissolution of natural and synthetic willemite 

samples in sulphuric acid solution (pH 1.90), respectively. Similarly, Espiari et al. 

(2006) found an activation energy of 23.5kJ/mol (5.6kcal/mol) for the dissolution of 

zinc-rich tailings (smithsonite and hemimorphite) in sulphuric acid solutions and stated 

that the dissolution process was controlled by an adsorption/desorption process.

The activation energy determined in the present work is high for the diffusion of ions in 

solution, although similar values were proposed for the diffusion-controlled leaching of 

other porous materials, as shown in table 3.4. These values are likely derived from the 

parallel nature of diffusion and reaction in porous solids as shown in equation 3.7. This 

implies that the apparent activation energy is the average of that for intrinsic reaction 

and diffusion, as already stated. Nevertheless, when the zinc silicate leaching is 

diffusion controlled, the effective diffusion coefficient, determined from equation 3.11, 

should be smaller than that for aqueous solutions. Table 3.5 presents the values for the 

effective diffusion coefficients of sulphuric acid as a function of the leaching 

temperature (from 30ºC to 60ºC). The effective diffusion coefficient slightly increases 

with temperature, in the range studied in this work, as expected. Nizikou et al. (1997) 

determined the diffusion coefficient of sulphuric acid in higher than 0.2mol/L aqueous

solutions and 25oC. According to the authors, a value of 1.8 x 10-5cm2/s (25oC) is 

proposed for the diffusion of sulphuric acid in aqueous solutions, which is the same as 

that calculated using the equations proposed by Umino and Newman (1997), 

considering that their model can be applied to a 0.4 mol/L solution. Utilizing the 

activation energy determined in the present work, a diffusion coefficient of 1.2x10-7 

cm2/s was estimated at 25oC for the zinc silicate leaching, which is two orders of 

magnitude lower than that proposed for aqueous solutions. Similarly, the apparent 

reaction order, with respect to sulphuric acid, determined from figure 3.3, as 0.64 ± 0.12 

(figure 3.10) is also an average for the chemical reaction and diffusion values (Sohn and 

Wadsworth, 1979). Summarizing, the leaching of zinc silicate is likely controlled by the 

transport inside the silicate pores.

The results of the present work suggest that the zinc silicate leaching is not strongly 

affected by the particle size, implying that fine grinding of such concentrates is not 

required. Therefore, a rigid control of the size reducing process is not necessary and the 

energy consumption during grinding could be reduced. Finally, as diffusion inside the 

pores is the as the slowest step, it is likely that an increase in the stirring speed could 

only marginally affect the leaching rate, as the diffusion inside the pores is not strongly 

affected by stirring in the bulk. Except for the practical effect of solids settling inside 

the reactors, a complex and expensive stirring system is not required.   

 

 3.4. Conclusions 
 

The dissolution kinetics of a roasted zinc silicate (willemite) concentrate in sulphuric 

acid solutions was studied. It was found that the zinc extraction was fast and increased 

with temperature and sulphuric acid concentration. The shrinking core model with 

diffusion  control fitted the experimental results, although it could not physically 

represent the leaching kinetics. The use of the grain model, which successfully 

described the dissolution of zinc analysis of the zinc silicate particles, is suggested 

because there was no reaction product on the particle surfaces. The apparent activation 

energy and reaction order were determined as 51.9 ± 2.8 kJ/mol and 0.64 ± 0.12, 

respectively, in consequence of the parallel nature of the chemical reaction and 

diffusion in porous solids.

THE EFFECT OF THE IRON CONTENT IN ZINC SILICATE 

CONCENTRATE LEACHING WITH SULPHURIC ACID. 

 

 

Abstract  

 

This work shows that the iron content in zinc silicate concentrates does not affect zinc 

extraction as the dissolution kinetics of concentrates with either high (10-11%) or low 

iron (3%) content is similar. The activation energy determined for the high-iron 

concentrate leaching, 13.1 ± 5.1kcal/mol, is statistically similar to that observed for the 

low-iron material, 16.0 ± 2.2kcal/mol. This suggests that the leaching of both solids 

presents the same rate-controlling step. The statistical analysis of the leaching 

experiments showed that increasing the iron content of the silicate from 5% to 9% iron 

does not result in a significant reduction in extractions, as 98.5% zinc dissolution was 

achieved for the low-iron concentrate. In the meantime, a zinc extraction of 97.5% was 

observed for the high-iron sample. Furthermore, a high iron content in the silicate 

concentrate enables a higher mass recovery during flotation. A flowsheet is proposed 

utilizing the high iron content in silicate concentrate for impurity removal.

4.1. Introduction 

 

The roasting of zinc sulphide concentrates produces zinc, iron and other metal oxides, 

named as calcine (Çopur et al., 2004). Zinc ferrites are one of the major species in the 

residues of zinc calcine leaching (Youcai and Stanforth, 2000). These ferrites can be 

very refractory to chemical attack and one method for zinc recovery from them is to 

leach these residues with hot and concentrated sulphuric acid solutions, but it will 

always dissolve a considerable amount of iron. The latter also requires a large quantity 

of acid during leaching and then a series of downstream iron and unwanted metal 

removal steps (Youcai and Stanforth, 2000). Several processes to remove dissolved iron 

have been applied at zinc industries, such as the jarosite [XFe3(SO4)2(OH)6], the 

goethite (FeOOH) and hematite (Fe2O3) processes; each of them having its own 

advantages and disadvantages (Pappu et al., 2006). Notwithstanding, a small iron 

concentration in the zinc process is beneficial. Raghavan et al. (1998) has proposed that 

there are two major steps to remove impurities from the zinc sulphate solution to those 

levels required for the electrolyte. The first stage takes place in the neutral leaching step 

where co-precipitation of several deleterious impurities such as antimony, arsenic, 

germanium, occurs along with that of iron hydroxide (equation 4.1). The second step 

comprises cementation with zinc dust. 

 

2FeSO4 + 3ZnO + MnO2 + 2H2SO4 + H2O ? 2Fe(OH)3 + 3ZnSO4 + MnSO4    (4.1) 

 

In the case of silicate concentrates, Souza (2000) has devised an integrated process to 

treat zinc silicate concentrates in the same plant that processes zinc sulphide 

concentrates by the RLE process (the integrate process). Among the different options 



  
68 

 
 

available, the author has suggested only one step of zinc silicate leaching. In the latter, 

there is a stepwise addition of sulphuric acid whereby the silicate is dissolved with a 

minimum silica gel formation. The neutralisation of the residual acidity with lime or 

limestone to pH 4.0 provides good settling and filtration properties of the leaching 

residue. This leaching process, in operation at Três Marias zinc facility, presents high 

zinc recovery (&gt; 98%), treating 350,000 tonnes/year of zinc silicate concentrate (Brook 

Hunt 2006).  Although there is no reference to the iron influence during leaching in the 

integrated process, the interest for the hydrometallurgical processing of high iron 

silicate concentrates appeared when the Vazante Mine, in Brazil (the zinc silicate 

source), noticed the occurrence of high-iron silicate ores that would be submitted to the 

flotation step, which precedes the hydrometallurgical treatment.  

 

The purpose of the present work, therefore, is to examine the effect of the iron content 

in concentrates on both zinc dissolution kinetics and recovery. A new concept of 

treatment is proposed using the iron content in the concentrate to eliminate impurities. 

 

4.2. Materials and Methods 

 

The leaching of zinc silicate flotation concentrates with high and low iron contents was 

studied. These two different concentrates are referred to as low- and high-iron 

concentrates throughout the paper.  

 

The chemical analysis of both the high- and low-iron flotation concentrates is presented 

in table 4.1. The high-iron concentrate contains 35-39% zinc and 7-11% iron, whereas 

the low-iron sample has more zinc (46%) and less iron (~3%). Prior to the leaching 



  
69 

 
 

experiments, these concentrates were dry ground and wet sieved to yield a particle size 

distribution between 150 and 38 µm. Zinc and iron contents as well as surface area, total  

porous volume and pore average diameter of the different sieved fractions are also 

presented in table 4.1.

Chemical leaching experiments were carried out batchwise in a closed waterjacket 

borosilicate glass reactor with 750 mL total volume and agitation was provided by a 

magnetic stirrer. That enabled adequate dispersion of the mineral particles without 

evaporation loss of the solution. The solution volume was 500 mL and the solid 

concentration 10 g/L. Leaching solutions were prepared using reagent grade chemicals 

(H2SO4, Synth) and distilled water. At selected time intervals, a known amount (3 mL) 



  
70 

 
 

of slurry was withdrawn and filtered. The zinc extraction was determined by analyzing 

zinc concentration in solution (Atomic Absorption Spectrometry, Perkin Elmer 

AAnalyst 100), and for every sample withdrawn from the reactor, the volume change 

was taken into account for the zinc extraction determinations.  

 

Batch leaching experiments under industrial conditions (150 g/L  solids; 70±2 oC; 7 h 

retention time; 35 g/L final acid concentration and 2.75 L total volume) were also 

carried out to determine zinc extraction from three different zinc flotation concentrates, 

assaying 5%, 9% and 12% iron. These experiments aimed to confirm those results 

achieved during the kinetic studies (low solid concentrations and pulp volume). In 

addition, batch leaching experiments were also carried out with both the magnetic and 

non-magnetic products of a magnetic separation step performed on the flotation 

concentrate. These leaching experiments were performed at the following experimental 

conditions: 160g/L initial sulphuric acid concentration, 10% solids, 70-75oC and 7h 

leaching time for the both the feed and non-magnetic product while the magnetic 

material was leached in similar conditions expect the temperature (90-95oC) and the 

leaching time (5 hours).

Surface area and pore volume were determined by nitrogen adsorption. Nitrogen 

isotherms were performed with a Nova 1000 High Speed Gas Sorption Analyzer 

(Quantachrome). Sample degassing was carried out at 80oC, for 24 hours, to avoid 

decomposition. Nitrogen adsorption was performed at -196°C. Data were collected from 

a relative pressure (p/p0) of 0.05 to 0.98. A large sample (~4.0g) was used and the Nova 

1000 parameters (equilibration tolerance, time to remain in tolerance and maximum 

equilibration time) were set at 0.05, 360 and 720, respectively, to improve the accuracy 

of low surface area measurements with nitrogen adsorption. 

 

X-ray diffraction was carried out at on a Shimadzu 600 diffractometer equipped with an 

iron tube and graphite monocromator. Willemite is the main mineral phase and quartz, 

hematite and hemimorphite were also present as minor phases in the low-iron 

concentrate while franklinite and dolomite were also observed in the high-iron 

concentrate. However, hemimorphite was not present in the latter; therefore zinc in this 

concentrate is associated with willemite and franklinite (a minor species) (figures 4.1 

and 4.2).

The analyses of both concentrates and leaching residues were also carried out by SEM-

EDS. The samples were coated with graphite by electro-deposition, using a Jeol JEE 4C 

instrument and observed in a JEOL JSM 5510 scanning electron microscope (SEM), 

equipped with a spectrometer for micro-analysis, based on an Energy Dispersive X-ray 

Spectroscopy System (EDS), and having an accelerating voltage of 0.5-30kV. Electron 

microprobe analysis have confirmed willemite as the main zinc mineral since the metal 

content of different grains is similar to that of a pure mineral (theoretical, table 4.2 and 

figure 4.3). As show in figure 4.3 (b) iron is not present in the willemite structure.

4.3. Results and discussion 

 

4.3.1. Effect of the agitation speed 

 

The effect of the agitation speed on zinc extraction for the high- and low-iron 

concentrates were assessed in the range 360-720 rpm. The stirring rate did not affect the 

zinc extraction regardless of the iron content in both concentrates. Therefore, the 

dissolution process did not seem to be controlled by mass transfer through the liquid 

boundary film, despite the possible change in solution viscosity caused by silica gel 

formation. Unless otherwise stated, the stirring speed was kept at 600 rpm. 

 

4.3.2. Effect of the temperature 

 

Figures 4.4 and 4.5 show zinc extractions as a function of temperature, in the range 30-

70ºC, for the high- and low-iron materials, respectively. These results show that zinc 

extraction is fast, occurring in less than 600s for the high-iron sample and slightly 

slower for the low-iron concentrate (1200s). Furthermore, temperature has an important 

influence on the zinc extraction rate, irrespective of the iron content in the concentrate 

samples. Similar results were observed by Bodas (1996) and Espiari et al. (2006), that 

carried out leaching experiments with a zinc silicate containing hemimorphite 

(Zn4Si2O7(OH)2.H2O) and smithsonite (ZnCO3) as major zinc minerals. Abdel-Aal 

(2000) also studied the leaching of a zinc silicate ore containing willemite and 

hemimorphite as major zinc phases and small amounts of smithsonite, and observed that 

increasing the temperature from 40 to 70ºC improved zinc extraction (from 70% to 



  
75 

 
 

95%). Similarly, Souza et al. (2007) also verified the temperature influence on the 

leaching of a zinc silicate calcine in the range 30-60ºC.

4.3.3. Effect of acid concentration 

 

Figures 4.6 (high-iron) and 4.7 (low-iron) present the effect of sulphuric acid 

concentration on zinc extraction as a function of time. Zinc extractions increase 

gradually with the sulphuric acid concentration in both cases, in the range assessed in 

this study (0.1 to 1 mol/L H2SO4). This behaviour was observed in previous works 

carried out by Bodas (1996), Abdel-Aal (2000), Espiari et al. (2006) and Souza et al. 

(2007), in experiments performed in sulphuric acid medium. Terry and Monhemius 

(1983) also studied the effect of sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric and hydrochloric acid 

concentrations upon the zinc dissolution from a willemite sample. The authors observed 

that the zinc dissolution rate was strongly dependent on acid concentration and the acid 

anion (SO4
2-, PO4

3-, Cl- and NO3
-) and suggested that the difference in the reactivity 

order was a function of the complex affinity for the zinc ion. In spite of the higher 

leaching rate observed in the hydrochloric acid medium, the present work was carried 

out with sulphuric acid solutions, since this is the standard reagent in industrial 

practices.

4.3.4. Effect of the particle size 

 

The effect of the particle size upon zinc extraction is presented in figures 4.8 and 4.9 for 

the high- and low-iron concentrates, respectively. The decrease in particle size enhanced 

zinc dissolution in the beginning of the experiments, but it can be noticed that such fast 

leaching reactions are not affected by the particle size since zinc extractions are about 

the same at the end of the experiment irrespective of the size fraction studied.

4.3.5. Characterization of the leaching residues 

 

The morphology of both the high- and low-iron zinc silicate flotation concentrates 

before and after 1, 3, and 10 minutes of leaching was examined by SEM-EDS and 

presented in figure 4.10, for the zinc-containing phases. The micrographs of the high-

iron material are presented in the first column (A) and those of the low-iron, depicted in 

the second column (B). The solids particles before leaching present a natural rough 

surface, as observed in figures 4.10 (A.1) and 4.10 (B.1). The leaching residues show a 

progressive increase in the roughness and porosity, regardless of the iron content in the 

concentrate (figures 4.10 (A.2) to 4.10 (A.4) and 4.10 (B.2) to 4.10 (B.4)). In spite of 

the surface degradation generated by the leaching process, the SEM-EDS analysis 

suggests that the particle surface does not present any reaction product layer.

soluble phases predominate at the late stage of leaching (quartz and hematite) (data not

willemite is observed in the 10 min leaching residue (figure 4.2).

4.3.6. Kinetics studies 

 

Discussing the application of different kinetics models to the leaching of porous 

materials,  a previous work (Souza et al., 2007) observed that the grain model with pore 

diffusion control could successfully describe the dissolution kinetics of a zinc silicate 

concentrate. This model considers that the solid reactant is made up of a large number 

of individual grains of the same size and form, which are similar to the exterior form of 

the particle (i.e. a spherical particle is formed by spherical non-porous grains). When the 

chemical reaction resistance is negligible, as compared to that due to pore diffusion, the 

reaction occurs in a narrow region and this situation is similar to the shrinking core 

model with ash layer control, applied to nonporous solids (Szekely et al., 1976). In this 

condition, the model gives the following expression for spherical particles (Georgiou 

and Papangelakis, 1998):

coefficient, k0 for a Arrhenius temperature dependent constant, [H2SO4] for the acid 

concentration and n for the reaction order.

In the present work, the zinc silicate leaching kinetics (both for the low- and high-iron 

concentrates) could also be fitted to the grain model with porous diffusion control (r2 &gt; 

0.98) at different temperatures. Figures 4.11 presents the Arrhenius plot produced from 

the rate constants, kD, at different temperatures. The activation energy determined for 

the high-iron material is statistically similar to that observed for the low-iron 

concentrate, 13.0 ± 5.1kcal/mol and 16.0 ± 2.2kcal/mol (95% confidence interval), 

respectively which corroborates that the leaching of both solids presents the same rate-

controlling-step, i.e. diffusion on the particle’s pores, as observed by Souza et al. (2007) 

for a similar zinc concentrate. The latter determined an activation energy value of 12.4 ± 

0.7kcal/mol for the dissolution kinetics of a calcined sample of the low-iron zinc 

silicate, which is analogous to the values observed in this work. Similarly, Terry and 

Monhemius (1983) found, respectively, 11.77kcal/mol for the dissolution of willemite 

samples in sulphuric acid solution, and suggested that the process was chemically 

controlled. The values observed in the present work are likely derived from the parallel 

nature of diffusion and chemical reaction in porous solids, since the overall reaction rate 

of the process is always proportional to the reaction rate of the chemical step, 

irrespective of whether or not the process is chemically controlled (Souza et al., 2007, 

Sohn and Wadsworth, (1979). This implies that the apparent activation energy is the 

average of that for intrinsic reaction and diffusion. The reaction order (fig. 4.12), 

similarly, is also influenced by the parallel nature of the chemical reaction and 

diffusion, and the values observed for both materials (around 0.55) also suggest that the 

dissolution of the high- and low-iron concentrates have the same rate-determining step.

4.3.7. Statistical study of the relevance of iron content in the leaching of the zinc 

silicate flotation concentrate 

 

Experiments were carried out with three zinc silicate concentrates assaying 5%, 9% and 

12% iron so that the effect of iron content in zinc leaching was determined. These 

experiments were carried out under similar conditions (acid concentration, leaching 

time, solid content and temperature) to those currently performed at the Três Marias 

Zinc facilities in Brazil. Table 4.3 presents both zinc and iron extractions as a function 

of iron content in the zinc concentrate as well as their respective means and standard 

deviations. High zinc extractions were observed in all experiments, regardless of the 

iron level in the concentrate (higher than 97% zinc extraction was achieved). The 

analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Tukey pairwise comparisons of the average zinc 

extractions for the 5% and 12% Fe concentrate indicate that the iron content of the 

concentrate statistically affects the zinc leaching (f0 &gt; f0.05; 2; 12 or 31.88 &gt; 3.89 and P&amp;lt;? 

or 0.000 &amp;lt;0.05). Notwithstanding, increasing the iron content from 5% to 9% iron does 

not result in a statistically significant (different) reduction in zinc extraction. This is 

because the confidence interval of the difference of the means, achieved from the 

experiments carried with the 5% and 9% Fe concentrates and based on the Tukey 

pairwise comparisons, pass through zero. The relevance of these results for the 

industrial practice will be discussed in details in the next section.

4.3.8. Industrial implications of the iron content in the silicate concentrates 

 

4.3.8.1 Treatment of flotation concentrates with integration with the RLE process 

 

Low iron content is a drawback for the processing of zinc silicate concentrates as iron 

plays an important role during the removal of impurities such as arsenic, germanium 

and antimony (Raghavan et al., 1998). The integrated technology to treat zinc silicate 

concentrates along with zinc sulphide calcines (Souza, 2000) applied at the Três Marias 

facility, uses the concept of impurities removal by adsorption in ferric iron during the 

neutral leaching of calcines (ZnO) produced from zinc sulphide roasting. This is 

achieved as the pregnant solution, produced during the silicate leaching, is sent to the 

calcine treatment step, where the high pH (4-4.5) causes iron precipitation along with 



  
87 

 
 

impurity removal. This approach is cost-effective in the zinc industry (Brook-Hunt, 

2005).  

 

It is well known that a series of strong acid leaching steps are required to achieve high 

zinc recoveries from sulphide concentrates with high-iron content due to the formation 

of zinc ferrites during roasting of such sulphides (Brook-Hunt, 2005). As the silicate 

also contains a natural form of zinc ferrites (franklinite), the same behaviour would be 

expected for zinc silicate flotation concentrates when the iron level is increased. 

Nevertheless, it is shown in the present work, through the kinetics study of high- and 

low-iron flotation concentrates, that the leaching of both materials is similar. This is an 

important finding for zinc silicate facilities, because the specification of the raw-

material could be less restrictive, so that high-iron concentrates could be processed (up 

to 12%). The present work appoints that concentrates with less than 9% iron did not 

reduce zinc recovery as compared to those with 5% iron. Noticeable was that even with 

12% iron, zinc recoveries higher than 97.5% were accomplished. Therefore, the 

leaching step needs not to be changed on moving from a sulphide treating plant to a 

silicate processing facility or when the iron content in the  flotation  concentrate 

increases with time. This contributes to double savings. Firstly, the capex (capital 

expenditure) associated with the treatment of high-iron concentrates is low because the 

route would not be changed. Secondly, the Opex (operating and maintenance 

expenditure) is also reduced as concentrates with high iron content are always cheaper. 

 



  
88 

 
 

Furthermore, when the iron content in the concentrate is increased (zinc content is 

reduced), the overall zinc recovery in the flotation step is improved, as shown in figure 

4.13 for pilot-plant flotation experiments carried out with these zinc silicates. In those 

zinc leaching facilities integrated with ore concentration plants, such as Votorantim 

Metais in Brazil, the overall zinc recovery could be increased significantly, more than 

8%, when it is possible to increase the iron content in the flotation concentrate. 

Figure 4.13.  Zinc mass recovery for different zinc content in the concentrate.  

 

4.3.8.2. Treatment of silicate concentrates without integration with the RLE 

process. 

 
For those plants treating only zinc silicate concentrates, a different concept can be 

proposed using the iron content in the zinc silicate concentrate itself to remove 

impurities. The simplified flowsheet of this new concept is showed in figure 4.14 which 

introduces a magnetic separation step performed on the flotation concentrate and 

produces two different phases. The first one has a low-iron content (~6%) that accounts 

for 90% mass recovery (non-magnetic concentrate) (table 4.4), which is leached at mild

conditions where iron dissolution is not an issue. A second fraction, with high-iron 

content (~19%) (magnetic concentrate), requires stronger leaching conditions (table 4.5) 

so that iron is dissolved and precipitated afterwards when the pH is increased, removing 

the impurities.

Leaching of the magnetic and non-magnetic concentrates produced high zinc recoveries, 

similarly to the flotation concentrate, as presented in table 4.6. This demonstrates that 

the proposed conditions for leaching are satisfactory and can be applied on an industrial 



  
91 

 
 

scale as high iron concentration was observed in the pregnant leach solution (magnetic 

concentrate). According to table 4.6, it can be seen that zinc recoveries are high (&gt;98%), 

with the advantage that it is possible to produce a source of ferric iron (more than 6 

g/L), sufficient for trace impurity removal. 

 

Several advantages can be foreseen in the proposed flowsheet. Firstly, the existing 

industrial facilities can be utilized to leach the non-magnetic concentrate because 

leaching can be carried out in mild conditions. A consequence of this is that 

concentrates with higher iron content could be processed without affecting zinc 

recovery, therefore dirtier concentrates could also be treated. Another advantage is that 

iron dissolution from the magnetic concentrate acts as a source of soluble iron for 

impurities removal in the purification step. This eliminates the necessity of the use of 

sulphide concentrates in the same process, i.e., the efficient treatment of 100% silicate 

concentrate becomes feasible.  

   

4.4. Conclusions 

 

The leaching of zinc silicate concentrates with high- and low-iron content was studied. 

Zinc extraction increased gradually with sulphuric acid concentration for both materials, 

in the range of acid concentration assessed in this study (0.1 to 1 mol/L H2SO4). The 

activation energy for the high-iron concentrate (13.1 ± 5.1kcal/mol) leaching was 

statistically similar to that observed for the low-iron material (16.0 ± 2.2kcal/mol), 

which suggests that the leaching of both solids presents the same rate-controlling step. 

The statistical analysis of the leaching experiments shows that increasing the iron 

content of the silicate from 5% to 9% does not result in a significant (different) 



  
92 

 
 

reduction in zinc extraction. This finding has an important industrial application, i.e., 

the raw materials specification could be less rigorous, enabling more impure 

concentrates, in terms of iron content, to be treated in the hydrometallurgical plant. In 

addition, the overall zinc recovery could be increased significantly, more than 8%, by 

raising the iron content in the flotation concentrate. Also, the leaching step needs not to 

be changed on moving from a sulphide treating plant to a high-iron silicate processing 

facility. The proposed flowsheet to treat high-iron silicate concentrates produces 

appreciable zinc recoveries in the leaching step (above 97.5%).

CAPÍTULO 5 
 

CONSIDERAÇÕES FINAIS 

 

Os trabalhos realizados com concentrados de zinco, sulfetos ou silicatos, trouxeram 

informações relevantes referentes à cinética de dissolução destes concentrados, uma vez 

que dados sobre a velocidade de dissolução destes sólidos, bem como a energia de 

ativação e ordem de reação com respeito aos reagentes, podem ser efetivamente 

empregadas para otimizar o dimensionamento de sistemas industriais. 

 

No estudo da cinética de dissolução da esfalerita com sulfato férrico, verificou-se que 

modelo de núcleo não reagido pode ser aplicado para descrever o processo. Este era 

controlado por reação química em sua parte inicial (até 40% de extração) e por difusão 

no estágio final. Esta mudança no controle foi confirmada por análises de MEV- EDS e 

também através dos valores de energia de ativação. Na fase inicial do processo de 

dissolução, a energia de ativação era mais elevada, 6.59kcal/mol (27.54kJ/mol), 

sugerindo que o processo é controlado quimicamente. No estágio final, a energia de 

ativação mais baixa, (4.68kcal/mol ou 19.56kJ/mol) é típica de processos controlados 

por difusão. 

 

A diminuição do tamanho de partícula, apesar de elevar a dissolução do zinco, teve 

papel secundário no processo de lixiviação. Uma explicação para tal fato seria a 

porosidade, que aumentava a área superficial do sólido, mesmo para as partículas mais 

grosseiras. 



  
95 

 
 

Para o caso do concentrado de silicato calcinado, os resultados mostraram que a 

elevação da temperatura e acidez afetavam diretamente a velocidade de lixiviação.  

Observou-se que, enquanto a lixiviação do calcinado ocorria, havia uma progressiva 

dissolução da willemita, mantendo-se as fases de quartzo e ferro praticamente inertes. 

Devido às características físicas do concentrado, o modelo do grão com controle por 

difusão nos poros pode ser utilizado descrever o comportamento cinético. A energia de 

ativação, determinada como 50,7 kJ/mol, seria conseqüência da natureza paralela dos 

processos de difusão e reação química nos poros do sólidos. 

 

Por fim, o teor de ferro em concentrados de zinco é determinante para a avaliação dos 

rendimentos de recuperação do metal. O estudo do efeito do conteúdo de ferro na 

lixiviação do concentrado de silicato demonstrou que o aumento de teor até 9% não 

diminuiu a recuperação do zinco. A descoberta leva a uma importante implicação 

industrial: a de que pode-se admitir a alimentação de concentrados com teores de ferro 

mais elevados e de menor preço durante o processamento de minérios silicatados de 

zinco.

CONTRIBUIÇÕES AO CONHECIMENTO 

 

Muito pouco há publicado sobre estudos cinéticos de lixiviação de concentrados 

silicatados de zinco, particularmente para aqueles da América do Sul, o que confere o 

caráter inovador dos trabalhos aqui desenvolvidos. Por outro lado, a utilização de 

modelos cinéticos para sólidos porosos, com ênfase no modelo do grão, é pouco 

aplicada aos concentrados silicatados. A partir da utilização deste modelo, foi possível 

determinar a possível etapa controladora do processo (controle por difusão nos poros) 

de lixiviação ácida do calcinado, bem como, calcular a energia de ativação e a ordem de 

reação com respeito à concentração de ácido sulfúrico, que são parâmetros importantes 

no estudo da cinética de dissolução de sólidos em processos hidrometalúrgicos. 

 

Os resultados obtidos no estudo cinético da lixiviação do concentrado silicatados de 

zinco com alto teor de ferro demonstraram que, diferentemente dos processos usuais de 

tratamento de concentrados sulfetados, não haveria necessidade de etapas de lixiviação 

ácida a quente para recuperar o zinco, como ocorre no processo RLE, para obtenção de 

elevada recuperação (acima de 95%). O estudo ainda propôs uma nova rota comercial 

para tratamento de concentrado de silicato de zinco com alto teor de ferro (até 9%), 

utilizando a solubilização deste elemento, seguida de sua precipitação, para a remoção 

de impurezas (As, Ge, Sb), eliminando a necessidade de integração com processo RLE. 

Isto conduziu ao estabelecimento de uma rota para tratamento exclusivo de concentrado 

silicatado.

O estudo também discutiu a possibilidade de se alimentar as usinas de zinco com 

materiais menos nobres, tendo como conseqüência um aumento correspondente na 

recuperação de zinco na etapa anterior, a de flotação do minério. A inovação 

proporciona diversas conseqüências positivas para o processamento de concentrados de 

silicato de zinco.

SUGESTÕES DE TRABALHOS FUTUROS 

 

Diante dos resultados obtidos no presente trabalho e desafios encontrados durante o 

período de sua elaboração, são sugeridos alguns temas relevantes que poderiam ser 

estudados em um futuro próximo, relacionados à lixiviação de concentrados ou 

minérios: 

 

(i) Aplicação do modelo do grão para descrever a cinética de lixiviação de 

outros sólidos porosos, que não sejam necessariamente fontes de zinco, em 

outros tipos de meio lixiviante, devido ao sucesso obtido no presente 

trabalho. 

(ii) Estudar a cinética de lixiviação dos concentrados silicatos de zinco, com alto 

e baixo teor de ferro, em meio alcalino. 

(iii) Estudar a cinética de lixiviação dos concentrados silicatos de zinco em 

presença de outros ácidos inorgânicos e até mesmo orgânicos. 

(iv) Estudar a lixiviação dos resíduos de flotação do silicato de zinco em 

presença de NaOH e H2SO4. 

(v) Propor e empregar um modelo matemático, baseado no modelo do núcleo 

não reagido, que possa ser utilizado para descrever a cinética de processos 

com controle misto e com ordem de reação diferente de 1. 

(vi) Utilizar espectroscopia RAMAM para estudar detalhadamente a formação da 

camada de enxofre elementar durante a dissolução da esfalerita e caracterizar 

os compostos reduzidos de enxofre possivelmente formados neste processo.
