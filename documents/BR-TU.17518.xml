Geological characteristics of the nesting areas of the giant
Amazon river turtle (Podocnemis expansa) in the Crixás-Açu
river in Goiás State, Brazil
Paulo Dias FERREIRA JÚNIOR1, Paulo de Tarso Amorim CASTRO2

ABSTRACT
A large population of the giant Amazon river turtle (Podocnemis expansa) nests along the beaches of the Crixás-Açu River in the
central western region of Brazil. In spite of the existence of several point bars in the area, only a selected group of beaches is used for
nesting by P. expansa. Geological aspects, such as river width and depth, beach height – above 200 cm – with sandy sediments, were
indispensable for the choice of these nesting sites. The relatively reduced dimensions of the point bars and the great number of
turtles, which nest in the same local, contributed to the existence of a high nest concentration.
The rapid rise of the Crixás-Açu River caused the flooding of the beaches and the drowning of hatchlings and embryos. It is
estimated that nearly all the nests were lost. The height of the nesting place and the time of flooding related to the incubation period
are decisive in embryo survivorship. The Retiro, Júnior, Assombrado and Limoeiro beaches, which are situated at heights of 183 to
310 cm, were inundated on 8 November 2000. The Barreira Branca beach, with a height of up to 380 cm was completely
inundated on 13 December 2000. All of these beaches were flooded before the hatchlings emerged.

RESUMO
Uma das maiores populações de tartaruga-da-amazônia (Podocnemis expansa) da região Centro-Oeste do Brasil nidifica ao longo das
praias do rio Crixás-Açu no estado de Goiás. Apesar de existirem inúmeras barras em pontal na área, apenas um seleto grupo de praias foi
eleito como ponto de nidificação pela tartaruga-da-amazônia. Aspectos geológicos, tais como um substrato constituído por sedimentos
arenosos, a presença de locais amplos e profundos no rio, e patamares elevados, acima de 200 cm foram imprescindíveis à escolha dos pontos
de desova. As dimensões relativamente reduzidas das barras em pontal e o grande número de indivíduos a desovarem no mesmo local fazem
com que haja uma alta concentração de ninhos.
A rápida ascensão do nível do rio Crixás-Açu, a partir de 25 de outubro de 2000, provocou o alagamento das praias e o afogamento de
filhotes e embriões. Estima-se que quase todas os ninhos foram perdidos por este motivo. A altura do local de desova, em relação ao nível do rio,
exerceu um papel crucial sobre o momento do alagamento das praias, mas foi incapaz de assegurar a conclusão do período de incubação e saída
dos filhotes dos ninhos. As praias do Retiro, Júnior, Assombrado e Limoeiro, situadas a uma altura que variou de 183 a 310 cm, foram
alagadas em 8 de novembro. A praia da Barreira Branca, com altura de até 380 cm foi completamente alagada a partir de 13 de dezembro.

GEOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NESTING AREAS OF THE GIANT AMAZON RIVER TURTLE
(Podocnemis expansa) IN THE CRIXÁS-AÇU RIVER IN GOIÁS STATE, BRAZIL

INTRODUCTION
The discovery that some animal species present

environmental-dependent sex determination has brought to the
center of discussions the importance of what physical aspects of
the environment exert on the first moments of life of organisms.
Charnier (1966) revealed that the Agama agama lizard’s sexual
determination is due to the temperature in which eggs are
incubated. Pieau (1971), working with fresh water turtles from
Europe – Emys orbicularis e Testudo graeca – attempted to show
that turtles also possess temperature-dependent sex
determination, and that it is usual that low temperatures produce
males and high temperatures produce females. However this
was not proven conclusively until Bull &amp;amp; Vogt (1979).
Temperature-dependent sex determination has now been shown
to be common in turtles (Vogt &amp;amp; Bull, 1982; Alho et al., 1985,
Ewert et al., 2004) as well as crocodilians (Ferguson &amp;amp; Joanen,
1989) and some lizards (Bragg et al., 2000, Harlow, 2004)

The giant Amazon river turtle (Podocnemis expansa) is the
largest fresh water turtle in South America, widely spread over
the northern and central western regions of Brazil, in the basins
of Amazonas and Tocantins-Araguaia rivers (Pritchard &amp;amp;
Trebbau, 1984). Alho et al. (1985) have shown that the turtle
has temperature-dependent sex determination and that small
variations of about 1 °C in the incubation temperature are
sufficient to produce significant alterations in the hatchlings sex
ratio. The temperature and humidity conditions of the turtle
nests are very variable and sensitive to climatic oscillations.

In the Crixás-Açu River the giant Amazon river turtle nesting
sites are concentrated on sandy beaches, which appear on the
riverbanks during the dry period. The nesting of the turtle in
the central-western region occurs between August and October,
and hatching takes place in the months of November and
December. The incubation duration, according to IBAMA
(1989), varies from 45 to 60 days.

Several different forms and different grain size sediments
constitute the beaches nesting for nesting. The maximum height
of the beaches is decisive in hatchling success for two reasons.
First, the river levels change rapidly in the central and northern
regions of Brazil. So, if nests are located in a low topographic
position on the beaches hatchlings may drown before they
emerge. Second, humidity originating from the underground
water table can reduce the nest temperature or drown the
embryos.

The sudden rise of the river level, called “repiquete” is the
main cause for the loss of P. expansa, P. unifilis and P. sextuberculata
nests in various parts of the Amazon region (Alho &amp;amp; Pádua,
1982; Hildebrand et al., 1988; Mitchell &amp;amp; Quiñones, 1994;
Pezzuti &amp;amp; Vogt, 1999; Ferreira Júnior, 2003).

Nesting of the giant Amazon river turtle occurs during the
end of dry season, when sandy banks emerge close to the main

fluvial channel borders. Usually they are point bars in the Crixás-
Açu River. The variety of beach forms, their dimensions and
grain size of the sand is variable, suggesting a wide hydric and
thermal environment range. However, the nesting occurs only
in specific points on a small number of beaches that, apparently,
are carefully chosen by the giant turtle. Therefore, when the
number of turtles is too large and space is scarce, nests are
concentrated. The turtle’s gregarious nesting habit (Alho &amp;amp; Pádua,
1982; Ernst &amp;amp; Barbour, 1989, Pritchard &amp;amp; Trebbau, 1984;
Vanzolini, 1967) partially restricts the possible variations of the
hydric and thermal environment that are acceptable hatchling
survival.

In order to establish patterns of geological influence on the
choice of nesting places by this turtle, several studies have been
carried out in the Middle Araguaia and Crixás-Açu rivers (Ferreira
Júnior, 2003, Ferreira Júnior &amp;amp; Castro, 2003, 2005). The
geological aspects such as geomorphology and sedimentological
characteristics of these beaches have been studied. This paper
analyzes the giant Amazon river turtle nesting areas in the Crixás-
Açu River in the state of Goiás (Brazil) during the nesting season
of 2000.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The beaches were visited daily from August to December

by the field agents working at the Centro de Conservação e
Manejo de Répteis e Anfíbios do Instituto Brasileiro do Meio
Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis (RAN/IBAMA),
who marked the nests with numbered stakes. Since the
concentration of the nests on the point bars was generally very
high, it was impossible to locate all the nests. Therefore the
IBAMA field agents estimated the number of nests based on the
giant Amazon river turtle tracks and excavations found. The
labeled nests were used as a reference for the measurements of
the relative height of the Crixás-Açu River water level. The
mapping of the beaches is on the scale of 1:1000 using compass
and tape measure during October after the turtles had nested.
The height of the nests and the point bars were measured with
a level precise to 0.5 cm.

On October 25, we took measurements of the height of
nests and beaches. Since the Crixás-Açu River oscillated during
the nesting season, the lowest level was established as a reference
point. This procedure allowed the comparison among several
beach heights in different places. The pluviometric data that
referred to the variation of the Crixás-Açu River level were made
available by the Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (ANEEL)
and originated from the Crixás-Açu Station, situated at
49°57’05’’W and 13°53’55’’S. This gauge station is located 15
km upstream from the Assombrado beach, which is the nearest
point to the study area.

The grain size of the sediment samples collected from the
beaches studied was analyzed using the grain size scale of Folk/

RESULTS

PHYSIOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF CRIXÁS-AÇU RIVER

The study area is a RAN/IBAMA protection and research
base. There 1.700 giant Amazon river turtle females nested in
only five beaches spread over 25 km of the Crixás-Açu River
(Fig. 2) in 2000.

Besides the IBAMA field agents’ protection, the turtles have
a relatively well-preserved area of the Crixás-Açu River to nest in.
The floodplain is characterized by several oxbow lakes. The
vegetational cover is relatively well preserved on the right margin.
However the left margin is more fragile, deforestation extends
up to the riverbanks, with only a fragmented riparian forest
remaining. The channel sinuosity is high with wide meanders
but short in extension.

The Crixás-Açu River level varied 857 cm in 2000, with the
highest level registered on 20 December, and the lowest on 25
October (Fig. 3). In 2000, during the months of June to October,
the Crixás-Açu River reached its lowest level, exposing point
bars (hereafter denominated beaches) that were used by the

turtles as nest sites. The river level decrease is slow and gradual,
but its rise is rapid and irregular.

During the dry season, the Crixás-Açu River level is so low
that, in many points, the river can be crossed on foot. The
exposure of sandy bars within the channels causes the water to
reach depths lower than 30 cm in several places. In this way, the
movements of turtle becomes very difficult and they concentrate
in the river pools (called “boiadouros”), safe from their main
natural predator, the jaguar (Panthera onca).

GRAIN SIZE ANALYSIS

The point bars, bars and river banks are formed by sediments
with several grain size fractions. The riverbanks are formed by
mudstone, sandstone and conglomerate. The grain size fractions
of bars and point bars are mud (clay and silt), sand and pebbles.

The results from granulometric analysis of five samples
collected along the turtle nesting areas in five beaches show that
the sediments concentrate primarily in the sandy fractions (Table
2). The point bars are constituted by sediments classified as
coarse sand, with substantial contributions from sand classified
as fine to very coarse. The mud volume is very low, less than
0.2%. The Assombrado Beach had the coarsest sediments and
the Limoeiro and Barreira Branca beaches had the finest.

DISTRIBUTION OF NESTS ALONG THE BEACHES

Almost all of the giant Amazon river turtle nesting occurred
between 20–30 September 2000. A great number of the turtles
laid in two or three days and their nest concentration made the
nest separation and counting impossible. The greatest nesting
period coincided with the decrease of the Crixás-Açu River level,
which happened after a small rise of 26 cm, registered during
the first two weeks of September (Fig. 3).

Since each of the five studied beaches present peculiar
geological characteristics and a differentiated nest pattern
distribution, they will be described separately.

Junior Beach: It is a point bar with low nesting concentrations
where only 23 turtle nests were registered (Fig. 4). The nests
were located at a maximum height that varied from 183 to 207
cm above the Crixás-Açu River level, on 25 October, which was
the day of the lowest channel water level. The well-developed
bordering riparian forest constitutes the vegetational cover in

the internal side of the meander, which shades the nests that are
close to the forest.

The low nesting concentration on this beach is associated
with the dimensions and positioning of “boiadouro” (deep pool)
and to its geomorphological and sedimentological characteristics.
The external border of the point bar near the upstream center
area (Fig. 1) is shallow and the water flow is strong and rapid
making it difficult for the turtles to move. A small “boiadouro” is
located near the downstream part of the beach. It is separated
from the point bar by a steep lee face of a great dune that migrates
towards the “boiadouro”. During the period in which the river
is shallower, the river flow causes the erosion of the dune lee side,
which makes the boundary between the beach and the
“boiadouro” even more abrupt. At this place, exit for the turtle
to the beach becomes very difficult, almost impossible. The
central part of the point bar presents ramp-shaped morphology
with little inclination. At this point, the river presents a water
volume which permits the turtle to circulate along the channel.
At this juncture, the turtle can easily climb to the highest points

of the beach. However, the local pebbly and gross substrate is
not compatible for digging nests.

The few registered nests on the Júnior Beach are situated in
the central part of the point bar but not at the highest part that
was very close to the forest. Nests labeled 34 and 35 were situated
in a sunny place almost all day long, but the height relative to
the river level was lower, since the place is a secondary channel
that cuts through the point bar. On 8 November, the point bar
was completely inundated, flooding all the nests and killing all
the hatchlings and embryos.

Assombrado Beach: In the year of 2000, a great
concentration of giant Amazon river turtle nests along the
Araguaia and Crixás-Açu rivers occurred at this point bar (Fig.
5). In a small area of approximately 1750 m² (35 x 50 m), near
500 nests – laid between 22–29 September. The height of the
nest surface was from 180 to 213 cm and as on the Júnior
Beach, they were situated below the mean height observed on
the other three beaches. Nest counting was not an easy task,
since the nests were overlaid. The nest count estimated by IBAMA
field agents was based on the nest marks and on the tracks left by
the turtles.

The beach is relatively plain, without any dunes. As a
consequence there is not the amalgamation of deposits, which
could generate topographical levels and a greater environment
complexity and diversity. The beach morphology is ramp-like,
spotted by a margin with low angle of inclination that connects
the highest part of the beach to the “boiadouro”.

The geological characteristics of the beach are not adequate
for nesting since there is a sandy-silt layer as thick as 20 cm,
which covers the entire point bar and makes digging nests
difficult. On the other hand, the beach has a “boiadouro” nearby,
which permits turtle concentration during the nesting season.
This is the determinant feature for high nesting concentration
in the Assombrado Beach. The river level was very low in 2000
making transit along the river difficult for the turtles. The nests
were flooded on 8 November, before hatching.

Retiro Beach: It is a point bar that is 500 m long and 90 m
wide. The sandy deposits are more complex. The density of the
giant Amazon river turtle nest concentration is high, almost 250

clutches in an area of 4500 m². The presence of several
topographical forms, dunes and flat areas, influenced the nest
placement. The presence of a “boiadouro” in front of the beach,
access channels and adequate bank topography make access to
the nesting site easy for the turtle. Nest distribution is not

homogeneous. A lower nest concentration occurred in the places
shaded by shrubby vegetation. There the height of the beach is
lower than to 2 m (Fig. 6).

Two platforms characterize the Retiro Beach. The highest
platform, between 236 and 260 cm in height, where the turtle
nests, can be subdivided in two portions: one upstream that
concentrates the nests, without vegetation and close to the
“boiadouro”; the other downstream, which in spite of being
high with a sandy substrate does not have nests, since it is covered
by bushes and the “boiadouro” is not directly connected to the
beach. At this last portion, a very abrupt dune blocks the high

part of the beach, making the access for the giant turtle difficult.
The area used for nesting by the turtle was flooded on 8
November.

Limoeiro Beach: It is a point bar 575 m long and 70 m
wide, where jaguars prey on the turtles intensely. Seventeen
giant Amazon river turtles were found with marks of been killed
by jaguars during the 2000 nesting season. The nest area is
almost 4000 m² and the number of turtle nests is estimated at
about 200 to 250 (Fig. 7).

The nesting area was altered by the rising water during the
last flood period. As a result, the portion where the turtle nests

were concentrated was approximately 310 cm higher relative to
the remaining point bar. Upstream there are pebbly deposits
originating from the erosion of ancient conglomeratic deposits,
making this point unfit for nesting.

The “boiadouro” is limited upstream by a dune that partially
emerges during the dry period, determining the beginning of
an area where the water flow is rapid and the river substratum
becomes gravelly and shallow, which makes the movement of
the giant turtle difficult. Downstream, the “boiadouro” is limited
by shallow and gravelly bars. The access to the nesting place is
made by a ramp with a slightly inclined slope.

In spite of the point bar not having been totally flooded by
the rising water level on 8 November, the eggs did not hatch on
this beach. The clutch base of the turtle is about 60 cm deep
and since the maximum height of laying in this beach was of
310 cm, the height of the nest base was located about 250 cm of
the Crixás-Açu River level. Since the swell of rising water on 8
November reached 262 cm, all the nests had at least their lower
part submerged. The nests sites on the entire Limoeiro Beach

was completely inundated on 13 December.

Barreira Branca Beach: It is a point bar about 550 m long
and 75 m wide. The highest point of the nesting area is located
380 cm higher than the river level. Favorable nesting conditions
appeared only in the highest parts of the beach. It is estimated
that 250 giant Amazon river turtles laid in this point bar (Fig.
8). The “boiadouro” extends the width of the channel in front
of the beach and the turtle aggregate prior to nesting is
downstream, where the water flow is lower and the river is wider
and deeper.

Sandy and silt deposits characterize the Crixás-Açu River
bank in the right margin, opposite to Barreira Branca Beach. At
its base there are conglomerates with gravel of up to 20 cm in
size, which after erosion and removal of the finest fraction compose
the residual gravelly deposits. In the specific case of Barreira
Branca Beach, the location of the residual gravelly deposits does
not make turtle nesting impracticable since the concentration is
in low topographical portions, which are avoided by the turtle.

GEOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NESTING AREAS OF THE GIANT AMAZON RIVER TURTLE
(Podocnemis expansa) IN THE CRIXÁS-AÇU RIVER IN GOIÁS STATE, BRAZIL

In the highest sites of the point bar, the turtle clutch bases
were located at least 60 cm higher than the water table on 8
November, when the rising water occurred. Thus, it may have
been possible that some nests hatched. Unfortunately, after the
rising water on 8 November, RAN/IBAMA suspended the
reproductive season monitoring activities, as they had concluded
that all the nests were lost. The nest site was completely flooded
only on 14 December.

DISCUSSION
In the area of the Crixas-Açu River monitored by IBAMA,

five beaches with a high nesting concentration were studied,
where about 1700 P. expansa nested in 2000. The morphological
characteristics of the nesting beaches are similar, allowing for a
diagnostic of geomorphologic and sedimentological patterns of
the sites chosen by the turtles for nesting. As a general
characteristic, all the sites with high concentration nests can be
classified as point bars and the geological complexity of these
bars will depend mainly on their dimensions. Smaller bars present
a simpler arrangement but usually without the platform
originated by the dunes migration and superposition. The point
bars with smaller dimensions, such as Assombrado Beach, present
a ramp surface without significant unevenness. The scarce dunes
found upstream or downstream are usually lower than 50 cm in
high.

The larger point bars, such as the Limoeiro and Retiro
beaches, show a more complex arrangement, where one can
verify the amalgamation of several dunes more than 100 cm
high, causing different morphological levels. The boundaries of
the dunes mark the morphological differences of the sites chosen
by the giant Amazon river turtles for nesting. The absence of
vegetational cover and the presence small dunes, and their loosely
packed sediments suggest that the higher point bars’ deposits
are reworked by annual floods.

The substratum of the turtle nests is characterized by poorly
selected sediments concentrated in the sandy fraction (Table 2).
The grain size of the sediments could be one of the criteria for
the turtle selecting nesting areas in the Crixás-Açu River. The
turtles always nested in the high beach areas, as long as the
sediments are formed by sand. In the Júnior Beach (Fig. 3), the
high places covered by pebbles did not allow the digging of
nests, and the turtles laid in the sandy sites, which were lower. In
the Assombrado Beach, the 20 cm mud layer had to be removed
in order to dig the nests. This fact, combined with the high
number of nests, increased nest overlap, since nest digging
became easier in the sites where the mud layer had already been
removed by giant Amazon river turtles nesting previously.

The presence of residual gravel deposits is controlled by the
regional geological structure. There is a discrepancy between the
gravel sizes, usually over 15 cm, and the energy of the Crixás-

Açu River, indicating that the present water flow cannot transport
clasts with these dimensions. The present river course cuts
Tertiary-Quaternary sedimentary deposits of the Bananal
Formation (Bayer et al., 2001; Latrubesse et al., 1999; Mamede
et al., 1981). The presence of conglomeratic deposits is frequent,
and these can extend for hundreds of meters and can be up to
150 cm thick. The conglomeratic levels have an interlayer with
sandy and silt-sandy deposits. The erosion of the conglomeratic
deposits causes the removal of the finer clasts by the water flow.
In this way, only the large clast fraction, such as gravel and
pebble, remains in the place, and when they are transported
they go for small distances, generating residual gravelly deposits.
Depending upon the original Tertiary-Quaternary conglomeratic
deposits, these deposits may occupy significant portions in the
point bars as it happens in the case of the Júnior Beach, or small
sections, as exemplified in the Limoeiro and Barreira Branca
beaches. During the lowing of the river level, a silt-sandy layer
up to 20 cm thick may accumulate over the sandy deposits. In
some sites this layer is thin and can be easily removed by turtles
or desiccated by rain and wind. In the Assombrado Beach,
however, a relatively uniform layer more than 10 cm thick covers
entire extension of the point bar. The area used for nesting by
500 turtles had to be dug on the silt-sandy layer in order to
reach an adequate substratum for the nests. Therefore, the
digging of the superficial muddy layer demands an extra effort
by the turtle, since the material becomes dry and very cohesive
when dehydrated after being exposed to the sun. The high
concentration of turtles in this site and the laying space restrictions
contribute to a high nesting concentration with a great number
of overlapping nests.

The maximum height of the nesting sites varied along the
beaches and was over 200 cm on average, relative to the Crixás-
Açu River in 2000. These areas are located in the point bars’
intermediate part, where the migration and amalgamation of
the sedimentary deposits generate morphological levels, which
provide good nesting conditions for the turtle. The height of
the nest sites was decisive for the hatchling success. The nests
located on the Júnior, Assombrado, Retiro and Limoeiro beaches
were flooded due to the rise of the Crixás-Açu River on 8
November. Some areas of the Barreira Branca Beach, located in
the highest places, had only been completely flooded as of 14
December, what probably allowed for the hatching and the
emergence of the hatchling from some nests.

Sudden rising of the water level is usual in the Amazonian
rivers and the consequences on the hatchling success depend on
the rising water magnitude and the height of the nest sites.
Pezzuti &amp;amp; Vogt (1999) mentioned that the greatest
concentration of nests of P. sextuberculata (75.6%), in the Japurá
River in Brazil happens on the highest sites of the beaches.
Mitchell &amp;amp; Quiñones (1994) found a positive correlation
between the beach height and the number of nests of P. unifilis

GEOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NESTING AREAS OF THE GIANT AMAZON RIVER TURTLE
(Podocnemis expansa) IN THE CRIXÁS-AÇU RIVER IN GOIÁS STATE, BRAZIL

in Peru. Hildebrand et al. (1988) concluded that the loss of
nests of the giant Amazon river turtle in Caquetá River in
Colombia, was due to the rising of the water oscillating from 0%
to 100%. Soini (1995) has showed a similar phenomenon in
the Pacaya-Samiria national reserve in Peru, where the rising of
the water inundates from 1% to 100% of the P. expansa, P.
unifilis e P. sextuberculata nests.

In the study area various other point bars occur that are not
used by the giant Amazon river turtle due to, at least, four reasons:
a) inexistence of “boiadouros” near the beaches, which makes
aggregation in shallows, prior to landing, impossible, as described
by Vanzolini (1967); b) insufficient height of the point bars,
which are lower than 150 cm; c) absence of safe connection
among the pools of the river (“boiadouros”), which makes the
turtles moving to new nesting areas difficult for the turtles and
d) inadequate substratum formed by gravel size sediments or
mud sediments. All these reasons – acting individually or together
– make the nesting difficult for the giant Amazon river turtle in
almost all the point bars of the Crixás-Açu River. Only a few
beaches fulfill the necessary nesting requirements, which allied
to the turtle’s gregarious habits (Alho &amp;amp; Padua, 1982; Vanzolini,
1967), causes high concentration of nests in small areas.

The high nest concentration, and their consequent
superposition in very small areas, is due to the lack of wider
suitable areas and of a greater geological diversity in the point
bars. The few point bars over 200 cm high that present associated
“boiadouros” are widely used by the turtle as nesting site. This
characteristic directs the protection and monitoring of the turtle
in the reproductive season to the small areas with large number
of nests. On the other hand, sudden rising water level, such as
the one that happened on November 8th, can affect survivorship,
as was verified in 2000. This happens because the nesting sites
are high enough to permit great variations of the river on water
table levels to occur without damage to the eggs. The
concentration of nests in restricted areas can also cause the
incubation of a great hatchling number in similar thermal
environments, which could induce production sex ratio bias
(Bull, 1980; Bull, 1985; Vogt &amp;amp; Bull, 1984). Greater
environment diversity contributes to the distinct boundary
conditions of the nests that could influence the embyogenesis
and the sexual determination in different ways (Alho et al., 1985;
Packard et al., 1987). Studies on the hatchling sex ratio generated
in these environments will be necessary in order to determine
their influence.

The analysis of the giant Amazon river turtle nest sites in the
Crixás-Açu River shows the influence of the geological aspects
in the nesting areas. The grain size of substratum, the presence
of “boiadouros” and high beach areas (over 200 cm) are important
aspects for local high nest concentration. The same geological
aspects as those listed to Crixás-Açu River are also important for
other giant Amazon river turtle nesting areas such as in the

Araguaia River, in the state of Goiás, and in the Javaés River, in
the state of Tocantins as shown by Ferreira Junior (2003) and
Ferreira Júnior &amp;amp; Castro (2003, 2005).
