SUMMarY

the technologies setting at agricultural production system have the main 
characteristics the vertical productivity, reduced costs, soil physical, chemical 
and biological improvement to promote production sustainable growth. thus, the 
study aimed to determine the variability and the linear and special correlations 
between the plant and soil attributes in order to select and indicate good 
representation of soil physical quality for forage productivity. in  the growing 
season of 2006, on the Fazenda Bonança in pereira Barreto (Sp), the productivity 
of autumn corn forage (FdM) in an irrigated no-tillage system and the soil physical 
properties were analyzed.  the purpose was to study the variability and the 
linear and spatial correlations between the plant and soil properties, to select 
an indicator of soil physical quality related to corn forage yield.  a geostatistical 
grid was installed to collect soil and plant data, with 125 sampling points in 
an area of 2,500 m2.  the results show that the studied properties did not vary 
randomly and that data variability was low to very high, with well-defined spatial 
patterns, ranging from 7.8 to 38.0 m.  on the other hand, the linear correlation 
between the plant and the soil properties was low and highly significant.  the 
pairs forage dry matter versus microporosity and stem diameter versus bulk 
density were best correlated in the 0–0.10 m layer, while the other pairs - forage 
dry matter versus macro - and total porosity - were inversely correlated in the 
same layer.  However, from the spatial point of view, there was a high inverse 
correlation between forage dry matter with microporosity, so that microporosity 
in the 0–0.10 m layer can be considered a good indicator of soil physical quality, 
with a view to corn forage yield.

reSUMo:        CORRELAÇÕES LINEARES E ESPACIAIS DO SOLO ASSOCIADO 

À CULTURA DO MILHO

O conjunto de tecnologias aplicadas ao sistema de produção agrícola tem como 
características principais a verticalização da produtividade, diminuição de custos, melhoria 
nas características físicas, químicas e biológicas do solo para proporcionarem o crescimento 
sustentável do meio de produção. Desta forma, o trabalho teve como objetivo determinar 
a variabilidade e as correlações lineares e especiais entre os atributos da planta e do solo, 
visando selecionar um indicador da qualidade física do solo de boa representatividade 
para produção de forragem. No  ano agrícola de 2006, na Fazenda Bonança, município de 
Pereira Barreto (SP), foram analisados a produtividade de forragem do milho outonal (FDM) 
em sistema plantio direto irrigado e os atributos físicos do solo, num Latossolo Vermelho 
distrófico.  O objetivo foi estudar a variabilidade e as correlações lineares e espaciais entre 
os atributos da planta e os do solo, visando selecionar um indicador da qualidade física do 
solo de boa representatividade para a produtividade da forragem.  Foi instalada a malha 
geoestatística, para coleta de dados do solo e planta, contendo 125 pontos amostrais, numa 
área de 2.500 m2.  Os atributos estudados, além de não terem variado aleatoriamente, 
apresentaram variabilidade dos dados entre baixa e muito alta e seguiram padrões espaciais 
bem definidos, com alcances entre 7,8 e 38,0 m.  Por outro lado, a correlação linear entre 
os atributos da planta com o do solo foi baixa e extremamente significativa. Os pares 
Massa Seca de forragem versus Microporosidade e Diâmetro do colmo versus Densidade 
do Solo foram melhor correlacionados na camada de 0-0.10m, enquanto os outros pares 
– Massa Seca de Forragem versus Macroporosidade – e Porosidade Total – apresentaram 
correlação inversa para a mesma camada. Entretanto, do ponto de vista espacial, houve 
uma alta correlação inversa entre Massa Seca de Forragem com Microporosidade, de modo 
que a microporosidade na camada de 0-0.10m pode ser considerada um bom indicador de 
qualidade física do solo, tendo em vista a produção de forragem de milho.

Termos de indexação: atributos físicos do solo, manejo do solo, geoestatística, semeadura

introdUCtion

the soil compaction degree is expressed by the 
physical indicator of penetration resistance, and it 
is related positively with bulk density of soil, but 
negatively with macroporosity.  High compaction 
degree affects the development of the root system 
(Bergamin et al., 2010).

according to Foloni et al. (2003), physical 
barriers in the subsoil alter the distribution of the 
root system of maize plants along the soil profile, 
however, the total root yield does not decrease.  
the authors further stated that a compacted 
soil layer with penetration resistance of 1.4 Mpa 
prevents maize roots from penetrating this layer 
and extending into the deeper ones.

Bulk density is closely related with other 
properties, as shown in a large number of studies 
indicating that increasing density causes reductions 
in total porosity, macroporosity, hydraulic 
conductivity, ion absorption, as well as increased 
microporosity and soil resistance to mechanical 
penetration.  this general scenario results in 
decreased agricultural productivity (Secco et al., 
2005; Mello Filho et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2006).

Soil compaction causes maize yield losses because 
of the physical changes in the root environment 

(debiasi et al., 2010).  also, the pore arrangement 
and size affect soil water retention, water availability 
to plants due to lower porosity and aeration, as 
well as soil penetration resistance (Cavalieri et al., 
2006), limiting the soil depth and volume explored 
by the roots.

assis &amp;amp; lanças (2004) verified a decrease in 
soil bulk density after 12 years, related to the time 
of adoption of no-tillage system.  they observed a 
diversity of responses to the same management 
system according to the different soil, plant, climate 
and other characteristics.  the highest values of 
soil bulk density in the first years of the no-tillage 
system were caused by the absence of soil tillage, 
but over the years the undesirable effect of this 
compaction disappears, as the no-till system is 
established properly.

according to Mercante et al. (2003) and Secco et 
al. (2005), total porosity is strongly related with soil 
compaction and penetration resistance, which tend 
to increase with the reduction of pore space.  the 
density and pore space can be used as indicators 
of soil quality according to the soil management.  
a continuous assessment over time of these soil 
physical properties, can indicate how efficient these 
management systems are in terms of structural 
stability (Secco et al., 2005).



           Spatial and linear CorrelationS Between Soil and Corn                               767

Geostatistics has been increasing used in the 
evaluation of the spatial variability of agricultural 
parameters of interest, allowing the interpretation 
of results based on the structure of their natural 
variability, considering the existence of spatial 
dependence within the sample space.  thus, currently 
spatial variability research is being conducted on a 
large scale, especially to study the properties of the ratio 
soil mass / volume and plant productivity (Freddi et al., 
2006; Mello Filho et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2006).

Spatial variability can be represented by maps, 
constructed from the estimates of the variable 
studied by the kriging technique (Carvalho et al., 
2003).  the correlation coefficient (r) between these 
values reflects the efficiency of adjustment, given 
by the technique of sum of squared deviations, 
representing the linear regression equation in 
question.  a perfect fit would have a regression 
coefficient equal to one and the line of best fit would 
coincide with the perfect model, i.e., having a linear 
coefficient equal to 0.00 and an angle equal to one.

the objective was to study the variability and 
linear and spatial correlations between the plant 
and soil properties in order to select an indicator of 
soil physical quality that is also related to forage yield.

Material and MetHodS

the experiment was conducted in a pivot-
irrigated area in an integrated crop livestock-
system.  the area had been used for six years as 
irrigated pasture with Brachiaria brizantha cv 
Marandu, in an intensive rotation systems, in 
pereira Barreto, Sao paulo State, Brazil (20° 40’ 12’’ 
latitude S; 51° 01’ 50’’ longitude w).  the average 
annual precipitation was 1300 mm and temperature 
24.1 °C.  the local climatic was classified as aw, 
according to Köppen, characterized as humid 
tropical with rainy summers and dry winters.  the 
soil was classified as dystrophic red latosol (typic 
Haplustox), sandy clay loam, allic, no compacted, 
strongly acidic, according to embrapa (2006).

the single-cross maize hybrid p30F80 was sown 
in no-tillage on 10 February, 2005, at a spacing of 
0.85 m and density of 5.5 seeds per meter, on the 
pasture desiccated 20 days before.  Fertilization 
consisted of 320 kg ha-1 of npK fertilizer (08-28-16) 
and of fertirrigation with two applications of 106 kg 
urea, 16 and 38 days after maize sowing (daS) and 
an application of potassium chloride of 150 kg ha-1, 
23 daS.

the experimental grid consisted of a total of 125 
sampling points, distributed over an area of 2500 m2 
(50 x 50 m), with an average slope of 0.025 m m-1, 
and sample points spaced 5 m apart and in the finer 

grid 1 m, established to detect ranges of spatial 
dependence for smaller spacing conditions than of 
the large grid.

in this way, the evaluation areas used to collect 
soil and plant data were defined: a) large grid, width 
3.40 m (4 plant rows) by 3.40 m in the direction of 
the row, covering an area of 11.56 m2, and b) grid 
refinement on the x axis, with 2.55 m (3 rows) by 
1.00 m, evaluation area of 2.55 m2, and on the y 
axis, with 1.70 m (2 rows) by 1.50 m, evaluation 
area of 2.55 m2.

the soil physical characteristics assessed per 
sampling point were bulk density (Bd), macroporosity 
(Ma), microporosity (Mi) and total porosity (tp), 
sampled from the layers 0.00–0.10, 0.10–0.20 and 
0.20–0.30 m, 120 days after seeding, analyzed by the 
volumetric ring method (embrapa, 1997), identified 
as Bd1, Ma1, Mi1 and tp1 in the layer 0.00–0.10 m; 
Bd2, Ma2, Mi2, and tp2 in the layer 0.10–0.20 m; and 
Bd3, Ma3, Mi3, and tp3 in the layer 0.20–0.30 m, 
were analyzed at a laboratory of the Faculdade de 
engenharia de ilha Solteira (FeiS/UneSp).

the forage dry matter (FdM) was assessed 
110 daS individually for each sample point, by 
oven-drying at 65 °C to constant weight.  By 
classical descriptive analysis, the average, median, 
minimum and maximum standard deviation, 
coefficient of variation, kurtosis, skewness, and 
analysis of frequency distribution were calculated 
and normality tested.  outliers were replaced by 
the average value of the surrounding grid points.

the highest simple linear correlations were 
adopted that could present the cross-semivariogram 
and therefore co-kriging performance.  Cross-
validation is a tool to evaluate alternative models 
of simple and cross-semivariograms that perform 
kriging and co-kriging, respectively.  So, to obtain 
the optimum number of neighbors, kriging and co-
kriging maps were obtained by interpolation, for the 
analysis of spatial dependence and interdependence 
between properties.

Multiple linear regression was used for the soil 
layers studied by means of the plant dependent 
variable (FdM) and of the soil independent 
variables (soil properties), in order to select the 
best relations between cause and effect, assessed 
by the determination coefficient, using the extra 
step of SaS.

low variability.  For soil porosity, the lognormal 
frequency distribution was indefinite for tp1b, tp3b 
and tp2.  on the other hand, the distribution of bulk 
density was normal.

the correlations between the plant and soil 
properties were high, a fact justified by the high 
number of observations (n=125).  Significance was 
observed for the pairs FdM x Ma1 (r = -0.160**); 
FdM x Ma3c (r = 0.129*); FdM x Mi1 (r = -0.147**); 
and FdM x tp1b (r = -0.225**).

the geostatistical analysis of co-kriging (Figure 3) 
indicated that the cross-semivariograms for the 
properties FdM = f (#Mi1), FdM = f (tp2) and Std 
= f (Bd1), respectively, had coefficients of spatial 
determination of 0.725; 0.639 and 0.697.  also, 
Gaussian setting was identified for the properties 
FdM = f (#Mi1) and FdM = f (tp2), and spherical 
for Std=f(Bd1), with ranges between 8.9 m FdM =

coefficient (Freddi et al., 2006).  in this study, 
the variability of FdM, Ma2c and the Ma3c was 
average, of Ma1 it was high and for the other 
variables low (table 1), in agreement with Carvalho 
et al. (2002, 2003), Johann et al. (2004), Souza 
et al. (2004a, b) and Grego &amp;amp; Vieira (2005).  Soil 
variability is the product of interaction between 
the factors and processes of its formation, soil 
management and tilling.  these factors are also 
determinant for the heterogeneity, observed in the 
Ma1 results, where the minimum tillage performed 
by the no-tillage seeder resulted in the highest 
coefficients of variation observed in the first layer.

the high rooting in the soil surface from previous 
crops can result in a very porous soil structure 
and, consequently, increase forage yields in the 
following growing seasons, corroborating Freddi et 
al. (2008), who stated that yields are correlated with 
an adequate development of the aboveground plant 
parts, at lower soil density, providing higher root 
dry matter production.  according to Souza neto 
et al. (2008) and araújo et al. (2010) reported that the 
soil physical properties and maize productivity in no-
tillage systems promoted higher aggregate stability 
and soil bulk density in the surface layer, without 
changing the content of water available to plants.

the frequency distribution of macroporosity 
was indefinite in the surface layer (Ma1).  in the 
subsurface (Ma2, Ma3), lognormal distribution 
was observed, with increased soil compaction in 
the second and third layers, in agreement with 
Souza et al. (2001), Carvalho et al. (2002) and Melo 
Filho et al. (2006).  in conservation tillage systems, 
the action of roots, macro and micro-organisms 
promoted a good macropore volume, and the mulch 
of crop residues on the surface retained soil moisture 
(lima et al., 2006).  Compression pressure applied to 
the soil can induce pore space reduction, especially 
of macropores (dexter et al., 2007), whereas the 
micropores under pressure may be full of water 
and, because of the low hydraulic conductivity and 
incompressibility of water, may be able to resist 
stress better over short time intervals than air-filled 
macropores (Kutýleka et al., 2006; Silva et al., 2009).

Soil porosity (table 1) showed lognormal frequency 
distribution for tp1b and tp3b, and for tp2, an 
indefinite distribution was observed, with average 
values of 0.300 m3 m-3 (tp1), 0.289 m3 m-3 (tp2) and 
0.306 m3 m-3 (tp3).  thus, the distribution of density 
values was not logical as they did not increase in 
the deeper layers, in disagreement with Souza et al. 
(2001), Carvalho et al. (2002) and Melo Filho et al. 

(2006).  therefore, this fact may have contributed 
to a reduction of FdM, which did not reach, despite 
the use of irrigation, the full expression of the yield 
capacity of the maize hybrid p30F80.

For soil bulk density (table 1), the frequency 
distribution was normal for Bd1, Bd2 and Bd3, as 
also observed by Johann et al. (2004), Souza et al. 
(2004a), and Grego &amp;amp; Vieira (2005).  the average 
values were 1.64 kg dm-3 (Bd1), 1.68 kg dm-3 (Bd2) 
and 1.67 kg dm-3 (Bd3), following a positive linear 
trend in relation to the increase in soil depth, 
corroborating Souza et al. (2001) and Carvalho et 
al. (2002), who reported an increased density in 
deeper layers, due to the reduced content of organic 
matter, and in disagreement with Grego &amp;amp; Vieira 
(2005) and Melo Filho et al. (2006), who found a 
decreasing gradient.

the first pair (FdM x Ma1) indicated an inverse 
function of cause and effect, i.e., the lower the 
macroporosity, in the 0.00–0.10 m layer, the greater 
is FdM.  the second pair (FdM x Ma3c) showed 
a positive correlation between cause and effect, 
indicating the increase of FdM with increasing 
macroporosity in the 0.20–0.30 m layer.  this 
corroborated pereira et al. (2010) who evaluated the 
physical quality of a dystrophic red latosol under 
cover crops in pre-season maize, in conventional 
and no-tillage systems, and found higher values of 
total porosity in no-tillage than conventional tillage 
soils (table 2).

in the third pair (FdM x Mi1), due to negative 
correlation, ie, with lower microporosity in the 
surface layer, FdM increased.  Scientifically 
speaking, the fact that occurred in the third pair 
was consistent, because when soil macroporosity 
increases, microporosity decreases.  in the fourth 
pair (FdM x tp1b), a negative correlation between 
cause and effect was observed, indicating the 
increase of FdM with the lowest total porosity 
in the 0.00–0.010 m layer.  However, for the first 
and fourth pair, this fact could not be confirmed, 
since the negative correlation of FdM x Ma1 and 
FdM x tp1b was precisely the opposite of what 
would be consistent.

thus, FdM in relation to tp1b and Std in 
relation to Bd1 can be estimated by the following 
simple linear regression equations:

   FdM = 1.084.104 x tp1b, with r = 0.242, p &amp;lt;0.01 (1)

Std = 3.360-5.299.10-1**.  Bd1, 
   with r = 0.306, p &amp;lt;0.01   (2)

of the soil properties, the best-correlated pair 
was Ma1 x tp1b, with the equation:



772 Carlos alessandro Chioderoli et al.

r. Bras. Ci. Solo, 36:765-773, 2012

Ma1 = -1.081.10-1+3.648.10-1**.  tp1b, 
   with r = 0.706, p &amp;lt;0.01  (3)

the geostatistical analysis of kriging (table 2) 
showed excellent plant and soil semivariograms 
(Figures 1 and 2).  the best-fitting was adjusted 
to #tp1b, with a spatial determination coefficient 
of 0.942, and 0.680 for FdM.  on the other hand, 
the studied properties showed spatial dependence, 
except for Ma1, # Ma3c and Mi3.

thus, in this study (table 2), it was found that 
76.7 % of the total FdM variation was explained by 
spatial dependence.  on the other hand, the nugget 
effect attributed to random errors was 23.3 %.  For 
the studied properties, the adjusted models were 
exponential (FdM, Std, #Mi1, tp2, tp3b, Bd1 
and Bd3), spherical (Ma2c, #Mi2, #tpib and Bd2) 
and the pure nugget effect (Ma1, Ma3c and #Mi3).

with regard to the soil properties, the models 
fit in this study agreed partially with Carvalho 
et al. (2002), Johann et al. (2004), Souza et al. 
(2004b), Santos et al. (2006), where sometimes one, 
sometimes another model was observed.

the range of spatial dependence for FdM was 
9.7 m, so that the extreme values for the Bd and Ma 
ranged from 9.0 m (Bd2) to 38.0 m (Ma2c).  these 
results were similar to those reported by Carvalho et 
al. (2002, 2003) and Grego &amp;amp; Vieira (2005), varying 
from 3.9 to 23.7 m (tp) and 1.0 to 13.1 m (Sd).

By cross-validation (table 3), the simple krigings 
for #tp1b provided the best semivariogram fitting, 
which could be observed by the highest correlation 
coefficient (r = 0.696) between observed and 
predicted values of this attribute, and by the linear 
coefficient (a) tending to zero and the angular 
coefficient (b) tending to one.  the correlation 
coefficients of the other properties ranged from 
0.338 to 0.535, and the linear coefficients tended 
to 0.00 and the angular coefficients were between 
0.765 and 1.002, as similarly reported by Souza et 
al. (2001), Carvalho et al. (2002, 2003), and Santos 
et al. (2006).

with regard to the co-krigings (table 3), the 
best fit was observed for the plant property Std = f 
(Bd1), which had the highest spatial determination 
coefficient (r2 = 0.430), as well as the appreciable 
values of the coefficients a (1.140) and b (0.543).  the 
performance of the other properties was similar to 
Std, with r2 values between 0.381 and 0.424, as 
well as values of a between 6.282.103 and 7.307.103, 
and b between 0.581 and 0.507.

thus, the principle of converging evidence 
showed that: a) Ma1 and tp1b were inversely 
and significantly correlated with FdM, b) # tp1b 

and tp3 showed very good simple semivariogram 
fittings (table 2) and c) the semivariogram fitting 
between FdM and # Mi1 (Figure 4), showed high 
spatial dependence between the plant and soil 
properties.

ConClUSionS

1. the studied properties followed well-defined 
spatial patterns, ranging from 7.8 to 38.0 m.

2. the correlations between FdM with Ma1 and 
tp1b were negative. From the spatial viewpoint, 
there was an excellent positive correlation between 
the FdM and Mi1 and there was no significant 
correlation of FdM with bulk density in any layer.

3. the linear correlation between forage dry 
matter and soil microporosity was low, although 
extremely significant. But from the spatial viewpoint, 
there was a high inverse correlation between these 
variables; with increasing microporosity, forage 
productivity decreased.

4. of the soil physical properties studied, 
microporosity in the 0.00–0.10 m layer was the soil 
physical quality that correlated best with forage 
dry matter.
