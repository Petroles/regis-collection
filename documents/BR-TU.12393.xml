It has been a long journey, which (contradictorily) passed by in a blink of an eye. This thesis 

was challenging in every way, academically and personally. Since the very beginning, several 

important decisions had to be made, but luckily for me, I had the support of one very important 

person, to whom I am greatly thankful. Alexandra Rosa, my life partner, you were always there 

even when at 933 km distance. This path was shared by both of us, because I know that these times 

weren’t a walk in the park for you neither. To think that this thesis was hard only on me would be 

extremely selfish, and for all your support, your strength, your joy, and many more other things 

(the list is quite big), I thank you from all my heart.  

To my family, you are the ones to whom I dedicate this work. Without your patience and your 

support for all my decisions, this would only be an “if”. The truth is that every step and direction I 

took lead me here, and you always had my back. For that, I am internally thankful. An especial 

message to my mom, who gave me strength in all ways possible – even with a simple cup of tea 

when working in the middle of the night. Sometimes, every small gesture counts. To my father, 

who despite all things, always gave me company. To my brother, your wise words gave me serenity 

during stressful times. You had a different approach than mine when you were in my place, and it 

worked pretty well!  

To my supervisors, I thank Dr. Rui Caldeira for the orientation, the motivation, the wise words 

and of course for the opportunity to study the Cape Verde Archipelago at the Oceanic Observatory 

of Madeira (OOM). To Dr. Paulo Relvas, who opened the first door of the project, many thanks 

for your revision, your comments, your attention and your good will.  

To the staff of the OOM, many thanks for the insights (in colormaps and many other things!) 

and more importantly for the moments of laughter.  

To Prof. Joaquim Luís for the insights in handling the Wind datasets, to Prof. Alexandra Cravo 

for the wise advises and to Prof. José Jacob for the good conversations.  

 Finally, to all my friends who always provided me kind words and motivation along the way, 

an especial thanks to Cátia Freitas, André Silva, Élvio Escórcio, Mauro Gama, Gustavo Vieira, 

Ricardo Correia, Rúben Gouveia and many others.

Abstract 

 

The characterisation of the mesoscale eddy field within and around the Cape Verde 

Archipelago is presented. Special attention is regarded towards the far-field (incoming) and the 

near-field (island-induced) eddies, along with the mechanisms and processes influencing their 

generation and evolution. Consequent implications in the local biological primary production 

(Island Mass Effect, or IME) are also assessed. This is achieved by combining remote-sensing 

satellite observations for wind, ocean surface currents, ocean surface topography, clorophyll a 

surface concentrations and sea surface temperature. Results show that the interaction between far-

field eddies and the archipelago is a recurrent phenomenon, which results in eddy transformation, 

eddy termination, eddy splitting, and eddy deflection. Local island-induced disturbances are also 

significant, mainly by atmospheric effects. Such processes result in the generation and confinement 

of mesoscale eddies, more often observed in the leeward group. However, the distinction between 

island-induced and far-field processes is hindered by the complex interaction between both fields. 

Thus, it is strongly suggested that many of the near-field eddies are a direct product or a by-product 

of such interaction. This is even more obvious in the assessment of the IME. Far-field eddies are 

often associated with enhanced Clha concentrations. However, nutrient-injection by island-induced 

cyclonic eddies also gives rise to phytoplankton blooms. As the remote and island-driven biological 

enhancement are remarkably intertwined, such observations challenge the idea that local biological 

productivity in deep oceanic islands are exclusively driven by island-induced mechanisms.

Resumo 

 

O arquipélago de Cabo Verde é um sistema de oceano profundo constituído por 10 ilhas, 

localizado no Oceano Atlântico Nordeste a ~600 km da costa ocidental Africana. O arquipélago 

divide-se em dois grupos principais: as ilhas de Barlavento, são aquelas localizadas mais a norte; 

e as ilhas de Sotavento, localizadas mais a sul. Esta região é caracterizada por um sistema oceânico 

altamente dinâmico, em que as correntes de superfície são regidas pelo deslocamento sazonal da 

Zona de Convergência Intertropical (ZCIT). Para além disso, a costa ocidental Africana é 

caracterizada como uma das áreas biologicamente mais produtivas do mundo, como consequência 

do afloramento costeiro, que por sua vez segue o mesmo comportamento sazonal atmosférico. A 

interação destes dois sistemas faz com que o arquipélago esteja consideravelmente exposto a 

processos remotos, que não são gerados no arquipélago, mas ainda assim podem ter implicações 

na oceanografia local. Embora estes processos tenham sido extensivamente estudados no passado, 

a integração do arquipélago no contexto regional foi raramente alcançada. O arquipélago pode 

também induzir perturbações no ambiente, principalmente pelo efeito de barreira na circulação 

atmosférica provocado pela topografia de alta altitude. Consequentemente, estas perturbações 

podem provocar processos oceânicos localizados, muitas vezes na forma de vórtices oceânicos – 

conhecidos na gíria cientifica como eddies. Por sua vez, estes eddies são conhecidos por induzir 

impactos a nível biológico, sendo até responsáveis por impulsionar a produtividade primária local. 

Este fenómeno tem como designação “Efeito de Massa de Ilha”. A geração de eddies induzidos 

pelas ilhas e consequente impacto biológico têm sido cada vez mais alvo de estudo um pouco por 

todo o mundo, principalmente no Havai, na Ilha da Madeira e nas Canárias. Curiosamente, estas 

ilhas partilham muitas das características que são favoráveis para a ocorrência deste fenómeno com 

o arquipélago de Cabo Verde. No entanto, e tendo em conta o conhecimento existente sobre Cabo 

Verde, o acontecimento de tais processos tem sido visto apenas como especulativo. É também 

extremamente importante notar que os eddies de campo distante – aqueles que são criados fora da 

área de Cabo Verde, mas que intersectam esta mesma área durante o seu tempo de vida – podem 

ter implicações significativas na geração de eddies de campo próximo – aqueles que são criados 

dentro da área do arquipélago – (supostamente) induzidos pelas ilhas. Porém, tal interação nunca 

foi tomada em consideração em estudos desta natureza.  



iv 

 

Posto isto, duas hipóteses são propostas para o presente estudo: podem os eddies de campo 

distante ter implicações nos processos físicos e biológicos de ilhas oceânicas, que até à data foram 

negligenciados? E, se for o caso, de que forma podem as ilhas impactar estes eddies de campo 

distante? De modo a responder a estas perguntas, a caracterização do campo de eddies ao redor e 

na área de Cabo Verde é apresentado, dando especial atenção aos eddies de campo distante e aos 

eddies de campo próximo. Para tal, foram utilizados vários parâmetros ambientais, tais como o 

vento, correntes oceânicas de superfície, topografia da superfície do oceano, concentrações de 

superfície de clorofila a (Chla), e temperatura da superfície do oceano. Estes dados foram medidos 

por deteção remota, a partir de sensores a bordo de vários satélites, que são de acesso livre. Após 

a sua obtenção, os dados foram processados a partir de scripts desenvolvidos no MatLab. Tendo 

em conta a natureza exploratória do estudo, foi primeiro realizada uma análise preliminar com o 

objetivo de determinar processos regionais que possam ter um impacto direto no arquipélago, e 

assim delinear o seguimento das análises a serem realizadas, assim como a estrutura do trabalho. 

Subsequentemente, foi adotado um procedimento mais detalhado, de modo a evidenciar os 

mecanismos e processos a uma escala local. Para além da classificação dos eddies de acordo com 

a origem, foi também designada uma classificação com base no tempo de vida, em que: eddies de 

curta vida são aqueles que não ultrapassam os 30 dias; eddies de média vida são aqueles que não 

ultrapassam os 60 dias; e eddies de longa vida são aqueles que ultrapassam os 60 dias.  

De acordo com o conhecimento existente, os resultados demonstraram consistentemente que 

o arquipélago se enquadra numa região oceânica extremamente complexa, altamente influenciada 

pela dinâmica atmosférica induzida pelo comportamento sazonal da ZCIT. Como esperado, este 

comportamento reflete-se tanto a nível regional, bem como local. Os locais de maior geração de 

eddies de média e longa vida foram identificados a sul das ilhas com maior altitude do arquipélago 

(Fogo e Santo Antão), reforçando o papel dos efeitos atmosféricos na geração de eddies. No 

entanto, foi também demonstrado que o arquipélago está exposto a um número considerável de 

eddies de campo distante, que interagem com as ilhas e com os processos induzidos pelas mesmas. 

Este tipo de interação traz implicações significativas, não só para os eddies de campo próximo, 

mas também para a propagação e evolução dos eddies de campo distante. Desta forma, observou-

se que os possíveis cenários de tal interação foram (do mais recorrente para o menor): deformação 

dos eddies incidentes; destruição dos eddies; divisão dos eddies incidentes e consequente geração 

de novos eddies de campo próximo; e deflexão dos eddies induzida pela topografia das ilhas.  



v 

 

Considerando a quantidade substancial de evidências que suportam a ocorrência sistemática 

desta interação entre eddies de campo distante e as ilhas de Cabo Verde, concluiu-se que grande 

parte dos eddies de campo próximo sejam um produto ou subproduto deste processo. Por esta razão, 

é muito difícil determinar a natureza dos eddies gerados no arquipélago, i.e., se são gerados por 

mecanismos físicos induzidos pelas ilhas, pela interação entre eddies de campo distante com as 

ilhas, ou até mesmo interação de eddies de campo distante com eddies de campo próximo. 

Este tipo de interação é ainda mais óbvio na caracterização biológica do arquipélago. Foi 

possível observar que os eddies de campo distante estão frequentemente associados a níveis de 

Chla elevados, que por sua vez está relacionado com o local de origem – a costa ocidental Africana. 

À medida que estes eddies intersectam as ilhas, a concentração superficial de Chla aumenta 

consideravelmente, atuando assim como enriquecimento remoto. Além disso, os eddies ciclónicos 

criados pelas ilhas são capazes de injetar água rica em nutrientes de camadas profundas para a zona 

eufótica, favorecendo assim comunidades fitoplânctónicas e originando o aparecimento de 

concentrações elevadas de Chla junto às ilhas. No entanto, estes dois mecanismos distintos são na 

maior parte das vezes vistos a atuar simultaneamente, o que dificulta a diferenciação entre 

enriquecimento remoto do enriquecimento local. Estes resultados desafiam a ideia de que a 

produtividade biológica em ilhas oceânicas profundas é exclusivamente induzida por mecanismos 

associados às perturbações das ilhas no ambiente ao seu redor.   

Assim sendo, o presente estudo demonstra que a combinação de processos de campo distante 

e de campo próximo são as principais causas na geração de eddies de mesoescala no arquipélago, 

que por sua vez têm implicações importantes a nível biológico. Tais observações fazem com que o 

Arquipélago de Cabo Verde seja um local perfeito para o estudo deste tipo de interação, motivando 

assim futuros estudos.

1. Introduction 

Oceanic islands are common geological features in the world’s oceans and are of considerable 

scientific interest in the present days. They can be found in shallow waters – known as continental 

islands, or in deep waters – known as oceanic islands (Wallace, 1892). Normally of volcanic origin 

and far from the nearest continent, oceanic islands contrast from continental islands in the sense 

that the latter type are an integrated element of the continental shelf and, as a consequence, are 

commonly found near the continent of origin. Naturally, the environment in which islands are 

involved determine with great significance its geomorphology and its biological patterns. On the 

other hand, an island can induce significant physical perturbations in the background atmospheric 

or oceanic flow, which in turn must have direct impacts in the biological realm (Barton, 2001; 

Basterretxea et al., 2002).  

Continental islands are more susceptible to coastal oceanic processes than oceanic islands due 

to its proximity to the coast. Thus, one may expect that isolated oceanic islands are not so 

biologically productive as continental islands. This is not entirely true, as there are several cases of 

isolated islands – mainly in the pacific – that exhibit enhanced levels of primary production and an 

exceptional number of endemic species (e.g., Doty and Oguri, 1956; Seki et al., 2001; Palacios et 

al., 2006, Andrade et al., 2014; Gove et al., 2016). The specific reasons for why waters surrounding 

isolated islands are so productive in presumably oligotrophic waters has been subject to a lot of 

debate over the years. After sailing for weeks in the vast open ocean aboard the HMS Beagle, 

Darwin was perplexed when he came across what he believed to be one of the most diverse 

ecosystems on the planet – coral reefs (Darwin, 1842). How could such a dynamic ecosystem 

teeming with life exist in a seemingly unproductive environment? This is now well known in the 

scientific community as Darwin’s paradox. Since then, several studies have focused on the 

investigation of the unexpected biological productivity in such systems, giving rise to the concept 

of Island Mass Effect (IME).  

IME was first introduced by Doty and Oguri (1956) as an increase in Chlorophyll 

concentration in the Hawaiian archipelago. Subsequently, this concept was generalized to include 

bathymetry-induced island effects on the local oceanography (Hamner and Hauri, 1981) and its 

consequent impact on the biological domain (Caldeira et al., 2005). Many studies managed to 

create a valid physical - biological relationship, and island-induced flow perturbations can be as 



2 

 

diverse as: the formation of island wakes that result from the blocking of atmospheric or current 

inflow and can extend several island diameters downstream (e.g. Barkley, 1972; Hernández-León, 

1991; Caldeira and Marchesiello, 2002; Chérubin and Garavelli, 2016); geophysical vortices – 

known as eddies – that stir and enhance vertical mixing in the wakes (e.g. Hamner and Hauri, 1981; 

Seki et al. 2001; Coutis and Middleton, 2002; Hasegawa et al. 2009); fronts and filaments (e.g. 

Caldeira et al., 2002; Barton et al., 2004); upwelling processes – other than eddies – that bring 

nutrients to the euphotic zone (e.g. Aristegui et al., 1994; Rissik et al., 1997; Palacios et al., 2002; 

2004; Hasegawa et al. 2004); among others (Elliot et al., 2012). Whilst these processes are thought 

to be the major contributors for IME, the latter can still be fuelled by several land-born factors, 

namely: the input of macro and micronutrients from island runoff (Sander and Steven, 1973; 

Dandonneau and Charpy, 1985; Bell, 1992; Elliot et al., 2012) and groundwater discharges (Hwang 

et al., 2005; Tait et al., 2014; Gove et al., 2015; Moosdorf et al., 2015); contributions from benthic 

processes (Doty and Oguri, 1956; Dandonneau and Charpy, 1985); or even the combination of 

oceanic mechanisms with land-born factors (Signorini et al., 1999; Palacios, 2002; Martinez and 

Maamaatuaiahutapu, 2004). For this reason, it is very important to clarify the nature of the 

mechanisms that drive the IME, but more importantly, one should not neglect the regional context 

and the far-field impacts to which an island may be exposed to. 

From the physical point of view, IME has been extensively reported in the most various places 

(e.g., Jones, 1962; Arístegui et al., 1997; Heywood et al., 2000; Perissinotto et al., 2000; Caldeira 

et al., 2002; Seki et al., 2001; Andrade et al., 2014). Such studies are remarkably consistent 

between each other, in the sense that similar methods follow similar patterns and usually arrive to 

similar conclusions. However, the integration of islands in the regional context was seldom 

achieved, as very few studies successfully linked local island effects to remote enrichment through 

far-field features (e.g. Barton et al., 1998, 2004; Palacios, 2004, Caldeira and Jesus, 2017).  Hence, 

two hypotheses are proposed: can far-field features have considerable implications on oceanic 

islands and associated physical/biological processes, that have been neglected to present date? And 

if so, to what extend can islands impact such far-field features? 

Cape Verde is a typical group of deep ocean islands disposed in a non-linear orientation, 

located near the north-western African coast (~600 km) in a hydrographically complex region, 

strongly affected by seasonal atmospheric dynamics (Lázaro et al., 2005). In its vicinity, the Canary 

Current Upwelling System is one of the four large systems of Eastern Boundary Currents (Hagen, 



3 

 

2001, Chaigneau et al., 2009) and is considered one of the biologically most productive oceanic 

regions in the world (Pradhan et al., 2006; Pastor et al., 2008; Löscher et al., 2015). The latter is 

marked by the presence of several mesoscale features that can possibly have a profound effect on 

the regional oceanography, such as: filaments, that extend out to hundreds of kilometres from the 

adjacent coast to offshore (Van Camp et al., 1991; Gabric et al., 1993; Kostianoy and Zatsepin, 

1996; Lange et al., 1998); and eddies, that can have considerable impacts in the ocean (e.g., 

Chaigneau et al., 2009; Karstensen et al., 2015; Löscher et al., 2015; Fiedler et al., 2016; Hauss et 

al., 2016; Schütte et al., 2016a; 2016b). Several other studies strived to identify and explain the 

nature of many oceanic features in the region (e.g. Zenk et al., 1991; Löscher et al., 2015; Hauss 

et al., 2016), but all failed to integrate the Cape Verde Archipelago in the regional context, as well 

as the archipelago’s impact on the far-field incoming features.  

In what concerns the near field, Chavanne et al. (2002) were able to demonstrate for the first 

time theoretical evidences of a shadow effect induced by the islands topography, when a wake of 

weak winds, flanked by strong winds, was observed in the lee of all the major islands. It is now 

well established that this mechanism may drive the generation of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies 

in the island(s) wake (Calil et al., 2008; Jiménez et al., 2008; Yoshida et al., 2010; Jia et al., 2011; 

Couvelard et al., 2012; Caldeira et al., 2014), which in turn must have direct implications in the 

biological realm (e.g., Arístegui et al., 1997; Barton et al., 2000; Seki et al., 2001; Coutis and 

Middleton, 2002). Yet, the archipelago lacks empirical observations that support such 

phenomenon. Most likely as a consequence of the wind shadowing effect, Lázaro et al. (2005) 

identified a nearly permanent anticyclonic eddy south-southwest of the islands, which was more 

pronounced during the periods of strongest wind intensity (Varela-Lopes and Molion, 2014). The 

far-reaching implications of the archipelago were also introduced by Chavanne et al. (2002), as the 

authors suggested that the island-induced blocking of atmospheric flow could originate a zonal 

counter-current, following the same nature as the thoroughly described Hawaiian-Lee Counter 

Current (HLCC) (Qiu et al., 1997; Lumpkin, 1998; Xie et al., 2001). Other similar observations 

conducted at a regional scale further reinforce such hypothesis (e.g. Chelton et al. 2004; Chaigneau 

et al., 2009), though none had the specific objective of investigating the archipelago. 

All things considered, one may arrive to the conclusion that the archipelago’s exposure to 

regional dynamics, as well as the interaction between atmospheric and oceanic processes at a local 

scale, are important factors that to the present date are very poorly understood. Hence, the 



4 

 

investigation of such mechanisms is of utmost importance. The current study aims to fill this gap 

and thus better comprehend the relation between the far and near-field which affect the Cape Verde 

Islands. Special attention is regarded towards the nature and the interaction between the incoming 

and locally-generated eddies and, as a complementary investigation, the biological implications of 

such physical mechanisms are assessed, focusing in the analysis of surface Chlorophyll a (Chla) 

concentrations in the vicinity of the islands.  

This project is organised as follows: In the next sub-chapters, a brief introduction to the 

mechanisms in study is presented, in which eddies (in general), island-wakes and island-induced 

eddies are described. In Chapter 2, a literature review concerning the geographical setting is 

conducted, elucidating the reader to the physical background which affects the archipelago. In 

Chapter 3, the description of the datasets characteristics and processing methods is conducted. In 

Chapter 4, the best-suited results are presented and are subsequently discussed in Chapter 5. Lastly, 

the final conclusions are discussed in Chapter 6.  

1.1. Oceanic Eddies 

It has been well established that oceanic eddies (hereinafter referred as eddies) are ubiquitous 

features in the world’s oceans (Robinson, 2010). Basically, an eddy is defined as a self-rotating 

coherent body of water (Talley et al., 2011), which propagates through the ocean mostly from self-

advection and planetary vorticity effects (Cushman-Roisin et al., 1990; Chelton et al., 2011), 

though several other factors can influence their propagation (e.g., Simmons and Nof, 2000; 

Cenedese et al., 2005; Andres and Cenedese, 2013). These features can range between a few 

kilometres, to tens (sub-mesoscale) or even hundreds (mesoscale) in diameter, and are categorised 

according to their rotational flow (Talley et al., 2011). In the northern (southern) hemisphere, 

cyclonic eddies flow in the counterclock (clockwise) direction, while anticyclonic eddies flow in 

the clockwise (counterclockwise) direction (Tomczak and Godfrey, 1994). Due to the effect of 

earth’s rotation (also known as the Coriolis force), cyclonic eddies are characterised by a 

depression and negative sea surface anomaly at its core, while anticyclonic are associated with an 

elevation and consequent positive sea surface anomaly. With the advent of new technologies – 

especially satellite-based remote-sensing instruments – these features have been increasingly focus 

of investigation (Robinson, 2010), and it is now common knowledge that they can have profound 

implications in the physical, chemical and biological properties of the ocean (Robinson, 2010). 



5 

 

Such features are reported to be the one of the major sources of kinetic energy in the oceans 

(Richardson and Walsh,1986). Furthermore, they can transport water in their cores for long 

distances (Alpers et al., 2014, Romero et al., 2016), being even able to go across frontal zones 

(Barton, 1987). Depending on its nature (cyclonic or anticyclonic) and place of origin, these waters 

can have considerably different properties in relation to the surrounding waters. In that sense, 

eddies are able to create and sustain their own distinct environment, which can be characterised by: 

nutrient-rich waters from upwelling regions, that under favourable condition enhance biological 

productivity even in presumably oligotrophic regions (Löscher et al., 2015, Romero et al., 2016), 

and are thus potentially favourable for fish larval survival which in turn can act as a medium for 

transportation and colonization (Condie and Condie, 2016); oxygen-depleted waters that create 

“dead-zones” in the middle of the ocean (Karstensen et al., 2015, Hauss et al., 2016; Schütte et al., 

2016b); among many others.  

Apart from the horizontal advection of water, eddies can induce vertical fluxes in their interior 

(Arístegui et al., 1997; Gaube et al., 2013). As such, upwelling (downwelling) occurs in cyclonic 

(anticyclonic) eddies due to the divergent (convergent) movement of water at the surface because 

of the Coriolis force, which uplifts (deepen) the thermocline and thus enhances (decrease) nutrient 

availability through self-induced Ekman-suction (pumping) mechanisms (Lin et al., 2010; Gaube 

et al., 2013). For cyclonic eddies, this mechanism is an important source of cold, nutrient-rich water 

to the euphotic zone (Gaube et al., 2013), which in turn benefits the primary production and drives 

the local increase of Chla at the surface (Alpers et al., 2014, Romero et al., 2016). Subsequently, 

the latter favours the gathering of grazers and predators, acting as an “oases” in the open ocean 

(Lévy et al., 2001; Lin et al., 2010; Hauss et al., 2016). In contrast, anticyclonic eddies do exactly 

the opposite, as they inject water from surface to deeper layers. Eddies generation can be induced 

by the most diverse physical mechanisms in the ocean, such as: topography effects (Barkley, 1972; 

Heywood et al., 1990; Alpers et al., 2014); current shear (Chelton et al., 2011; Schütte et al., 

2016a); ocean-atmosphere interaction (Calil et al., 2008; Jiménez et al., 2008; Coulevard et al., 

2012; Hogg et al., 2016); or even eddy-eddy interaction (Sangrà et al., 2009; Chelton et al., 2011). 

However, one of the most interesting mechanisms in the generation of eddies is the island-induced 

processes, which deserve especial attention in the current study.

1.2. Island Wakes and Island-induced Eddies 

An island, or a group of islands, can produce distinctive signatures in the environment around 

them. One of the most characteristic features are known as island wakes and the subsequent eddy 

generation, typically streaming away in a dominant direction concomitant to the background wind 

or current flow (Robinson, 2010). It is important to note, however, that there are different ways to 

perceive such features.  

From the oceanographic point of view, there are two types of islands disturbances (Tomczak, 

1998). One occurs in shallow stratified shelf seas, where the current is clearly dominated by a tidal 

regime that moves water in both directions and gets blocked by the island bathymetry, generating 

a wake in the opposite side of the impinging flow (e.g., Pingree and Maddock, 1980; Hamner and 

Hauri, 1981; Heywood et al., 1990). Another takes place both in shallow and deep water, when a 

clear dominating flow passing an island generates a wake or zone of flow disturbance that can 

extend several island diameters, ultimately leading to the generation of eddies (e.g., Barton et al., 

2000; Caldeira et al., 2005). The scale of the eddies at their initial phase is normally not far from 

the diameter of the island which provoked it (Dong and McWilliams, 2007; Sangrá et al., 2009), 

with the exception when two identical vortices merge and create one eddy with the double diameter 

and rotation velocity of the original (Barton, 2001). Barkley (1972) introduced the first empirical 

case study of an island wake and consequent island-induced eddies through observations of fishing 

gear drift and surface currents measurements at Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, where the data 

showed a vortex-like drifting pattern. Subsequently, several other studies were conducted 

worldwide, providing a broader understanding and improving the scientific knowledge on this 

issue. 

Current wakes arise from the friction experienced by the flow field when the ocean currents 

intercept and get deflected by the island. This physical barrier forces the water to depart from a 

straight path inducing an acceleration perpendicular to the original direction, known as the inertial 

force (Tomczak, 1998). Another important force that must be taken into account is the frictional 

force associated with the boundary layer around the island. The balance of these two forces plays 

a crucial role determining the behaviour of the flow. If the frictional force dominates over the 

inertial force, the water transport gets dragged along the island’s coasts, but if the dominant forces 

are reversed the water flow is therefore thrown off its path and gets separated from the island. This 

balance is very closely related with the Reynolds number (Re), which takes into account the original 



7 

 

flow velocity, the width of the obstacle (in this case, an island) and the horizontal molecular 

viscosity.  

In an ideal case, Batchelor (1967) demonstrated that the Re is a good method for determining 

the turbulence in a fluid. The author found that by increasing the flow velocity or the obstacle 

diameter, the turbulence of the flow would equally increase, leading to the generation of a vortex 

pair with opposite rotation attached to the obstacle, periodic oscillation of the wake, eddy shedding 

and eventually to a Von Karman Vortex Street. Nonetheless, it is a proven fact that the ocean is far 

from being an ideal case, given that: it is rare to find a perfectly cylindrical and isolated island in 

deep ocean; the upstream flow velocity and direction is not constant, as it is under the influence of 

a variety of factors; and the molecular viscosity in the equation must be replaced by the eddy 

viscosity in the ocean, which is poorly understood (Barton, 2001). The application of such theory 

in a complex system – particularly Cape Verde Archipelago, which is dispersed in a non-linear 

orientation and under a non-laminar incident flow – is not a straightforward process. Thus, it is not 

considered in the current study. 

As from the atmospheric point of view, it is well known that the atmosphere-ocean interaction 

is responsible for a high transfer of energy. Surface wind stress is the principal factor forcing basin-

scale ocean circulation (Stewart, 2008; Talley et al., 2011) and is responsible for inducing local 

currents and turbulent features (Elken, 2016). Albeit the significant lower density in relation to the 

ocean, the atmosphere is subjected to the same kind of fluid dynamics when intercepting an 

obstacle. Hence, oceanic islands topography can – as for oceanic flow – disturb the atmospheric 

flow, ultimately generating one of the most remarkable and distinct island-induced features in the 

adjacent environment. The atmospheric effect occurs when the incident wind flow gets blocked by 

an island high topography and creates extended sheltered regions in the lee zone downwind with 

an occasional vortex-like trail of clouds (Figure 1.1), previous referred as a Von Karman Vortex 

Street (e.g., Chopra and Hubert, 1964; Caldeira et al., 2002; Couvelard et al., 2014; Spedding, 

2014).

São Nicolau and Fogo Islands, and wind wakes in the lee of Sal, Boavista, Maio and Santiago Islands. Source: Nasa. Georeferenced

This wind wake normally extends a few thousand kilometres from the island in the prevailing 

wind direction. The local response may be superficial, with the development of a diurnal 

thermocline in the sheltered region (e.g., Barton et al., 2000; Basterretxea et al., 2002; Caldeira, 

2002; Caldeira et al., 2005). In the case of persistent steady winds, however, the implications are 

more significant. Sharp horizontal wind shear lines may form on the edges of the island wake, 

resulting in rapid variations of the Ekman transport in the ocean (Barton, 2001; Robinson, 2010). 

At the western boundary of the lee, the upwelling of deeper waters must compensate the divergence 

- elevating the pycnocline closer to the surface - while at the eastern boundary, sinking of surface 

water through Ekman pumping must occur as a product of the convergence – deepening the 

pycnocline (Figure 1.2). Some authors argue that these processes are enhanced when the steady 

wind is capped by an atmospheric inversion layer (e.g., Barton et al., 2000; Hafner and Xie, 2003). 

According to Chavanne et al., (2002), this condition is well meet in the Cape Verde Islands, where 

it is possible to find strong and steady winds (~8 m.s-1) generated by the Azores High – Saharan 

Low system, with the addition of high altitude topography (1500-2800 m) which in turn is well 

above the inversion layer (500-700 m).

water in the lee of the island; white line corresponds to the pycnocline; big white arrows represent the wind; curved arrows represent 

the eddy cyclonic and anticyclonic movement which lead to upwelling and downwelling (vertical blue arrows), respectively. 

Retrived from Chavanne et al. (2001). 

For islands with high mountains where the prevailing wind is parallel to the dominant ocean 

current, it is difficult to access the nature of the eddies that are generated downstream, i.e. from 

current or wind induced processes (Barton, 2001). In Hawaii, Patzert (1969) concluded that the 

impinging flow was too weak for eddy generation, thus attributing the main cause to the local wind 

blowing through the narrow passage between the islands of Maui and Hawaii. In Canary Islands, 

Arístegui et al. (1994) noticed the presence of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies downstream of 

Gran Canaria. The authors suggested that these are more likely to be provoked by the island’s 

impact on the oceanic flow rather than by the influence of the wind, since eddies are recurrent even 

during periods of low wind intensity. The latter was further confirmed by Ródrigues et al. (1999) 

and more recently by Jiménez et al. (2008), who presented strong theoretical evidences (model 

results) that supports the previous hypothesis. Still, one must consider the possibility that wind and 

current island-induced disturbances may act as coupled mechanisms and thus enhance the 

production of eddies in such systems, especially when the two are not capable of acting alone 

(Barton et al., 2000; Basterretxea et al., 2002). 

In some extraordinary cases, the wind blocking effect can have a regional impact over the 

ocean, as it is the case of Hawaii. Xie et al. (2001) detected a wind wake induced by the islands 

sheltering of the north-easterly steady trade winds, extending 3000 km westward in the lee zone of 

the archipelago. The authors suggested that this feature is responsible for the existence of the 

Hawaiian Lee Counter Current (HLCC) that flows eastward in the opposite direction of both the 

trade winds and the westward Pacific North Equatorial Current (Sasaki et al., 2010), leaving a 



10 

 

warm surface and subsurface water signature stretching 8000 km away from the Asian coast (Xie 

et al., 2001). Following the same nature of Hawaii, Chavanne et al. (2002) introduced the 

possibility that similar (but weaker) features to the HLCC are likely to happen in Cape Verde, thus 

justifying additional studies in the region.

2. Geographic Settings  

To better understand the nature of the ocean circulation and features, one must initially 

construct knowledge regarding the geographic details of the region – including the regional 

bathymetry/topography, the wind field and its seasonality, among several other relevant factors for 

the study (Tomczak and Godfrey, 1994). As such, a brief literature review about the oceanic and 

atmospheric characteristics for the region of Cape Verde is presented in this chapter. 

2.1. Cape Verde Archipelago 

The Republic of Cape Verde is an island country composed by ten islands and thirteen islets  

arrayed in a west-facing horseshoe disposition, being all of them from volcanic origin (Ramalho, 

2011). Along with the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, the Cape Verde Archipelago is the 

southernmost group of islands which form the Macaronesia (EC, 2017). It is located in the North 

Atlantic and lies 450 – 600 km off the western coast of Africa, in a geographical area between the 

latitudes and longitudes of 14º40’ – 17º30’N and 21º30’ – 25º30’W, respectively. It occupies a 

total area of 4033 km2 unevenly distributed among the islands, with a significant total coast line of 

approximately 1020 km2 (DGA, 2004).

The islands are divided into two main groups (Figure 2.1): The Windward group, comprising 

the islands of Santo Antão, São Vicente, Santa Luzia, São Nicolau, Sal, and Boa Vista; and the 

Leeward group, comprising Maio, Santiago, Fogo, and Brava. However, in terms of 

geomorphology and accordingly to the regional bathymetry, the archipelago can be divided in two 

distinct groups: the northern chain, with a west-east orientation from Santo Antão to São Nicolau, 

probably constitutes a single elongated edifice; and an east-to-southern chain, starting in Sal and 

ending in Brava. Despite this division it is possible to consider Brava and Santiago as a detached 

edifice, since they are separated by a considerable depth of 3000 m. Between Boa Vista and Maio 

islands the bathymetry reveals a shallow area, known as João Valente bank with the highest summit 

having 14 m depth (Ramalho, 2011). The regional bathymetry also indicates the presence of several 

seamounts near the islands.  

The origins of the archipelago are attributed to the long-term mid-plate volcanism associated 

with the Cape Verde hotspot which rests upon the Cape Verde Rise. The volcanic activity was not 

continuous – meaning that there were different periods of activity –, leading to different formation 

ages. By the surface geomorphology one may conclude that the eastern group of islands (Sal, Boa 

Vista and Maio), which are characterized by long beaches and flat topography – evidences of 

erosion – were formed first. The other mountainous islands with higher peaks (Figure 2.2, Annex 

A.1) and sharper coastline are more recent.

2.2. Climate 

The islands are characterized by a tropical oceanic climate, with a small annual temperature 

amplitude in the range from 19 to 29 ºC (Ramalho, 2011). Due to its location in the Sahelian arid 

belt, the islands are exposed to very low precipitation levels – varying from ? 300 mm.yr-1 in low 

altitudes to ? 700 mm.yr-1 in higher altitudes (DGA, 2004) –, and a seasonal rainfall regime 

characterized by dry (November - June) and wet (July - October) seasons (DGA, 2004; Varela-

Lopes and Molion, 2014). The archipelago’s climate is under the direct influence of the 

Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and subjected to prevailing northeast trade winds occurring 

throughout the year (Figure 2.3), with a higher intensity in winter and spring (9 m.s-1 maximum 

mean speed; NCAS, 2017) (Fernandes et al., 2005; Lázaro et al., 2005; Varela-Lopes and Molion, 

2014; Faye et al., 2015). These are responsible for the intensity and direction of local wave and 

surface currents – which have asymmetrical characteristics between coastlines facing north and 

south (Ramalho, 2011) –, as well as for the sea level height (Gomes et al., 2015). Higher wind 

speeds are more frequent in the Leeward Islands than in the Windward Islands (DGA, 2004).  

  
Figure 2.3 – Representation of the seasonal mean wind speed and direction in the region of Cape Verde, between the years of 2003 

to 2014. The presence of the ITCZ can be easily identified as a wind confluence zonal region at lower latitudes. Data: QuikSCAT 

and ASCAT.  



14 

 

The ITCZ lies in the equatorial band and can be identified as a tropical belt of minimum wind 

speeds (Molinari et al., 1986), where deep convective clouds (Waliser and Gautier, 1993) lead to 

a maximum regional mean precipitation (Philander et al., 1996), and conversely to a regional solar 

radiation minimum (Tomczak and Godfrey, 1994). The latter results from the convergence of the 

southward and the northward warm and moist lower branches of the Hadley cell (from the northern 

and southern hemisphere, respectively) – known as the trade winds (Schneider et al., 2014). In the 

regional context, the ITZC follows the sun’s zenith point (Soares, 2015) and migrates between 9ºN 

in summer and 2ºN in winter (Schneider et al., 2014), also in response to the northward shift and 

weakening of the Azores High–Saharan Low system (Barton et al., 1998), thus governing the large-

scale surface currents (Stramma and Schott, 1999). 

2.3. Oceanographic setting  

The Cape Verde sea is a deep oceanic region, where the density stratification of the water 

column determines the hydrodynamics of the region (Gomes et al., 2015). This area is located at 

the eastern boundary of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre at the southern limit of the Canary 

Current (CC) (Fernandes et al., 2005). It can be regarded as a region of large-scale interactions 

(Figure 2.4) between the CC, the North Equatorial Current (NEC), the North Equatorial Counter-

Current (NECC) and the seasonal Mauritanian Current (MC) (Mittelstaedt, 1991). Also in its 

vicinity, two different water masses meet between Cape Blanc and the northernmost Cape Verde 

Islands, forming a large-scale frontal system coined by Zenk et al. (1991) as the Cape Verde Frontal 

Zone (CVFZ), which extends zonally across the entire length of the Atlantic Ocean from the 

Caribbean Sea do the African coast (Emery and Meincke, 1986; Lozier et al., 1995). It is marked 

by substantial thermohaline (Zhang et al., 2003) and even larger inorganic and dissolved oxygen 

gradients (Pelegrí and Peña-Izquierdo, 2015), separating the warmer and saltier North Atlantic 

Central Water (NACW) from the cooler, fresher and richer in nutrients South Atlantic Central 

Water (SACW) (e.g., Mittelstaedt 1983, 1991; Péres-Rodriguez et al., 2001; Meunier et al., 2012). 

Albeit strong temperature and salinity gradients (? 3 ºC per 40 km and 0.9 psu per 10 km, 

respectively), the front is density-compensated (Zenk et al., 1991; Pastor et al., 2008). Thus, it 

cannot be seen in the density field (Tomczak, 1998). Within this transition zone, an important eddy-

field exists (Barton, 1987; Meunier et al., 2012). The latter is more likely to arise from the kinetic 

energy associated with the currents interaction and topography effects at Cape Blanc, or by the 



15 

 

offshore advection developed along the upwelling front (Pastor et al., 2008) – since density-

compensated fronts are characterised by strong layering and intrusion, and only density fronts are 

associated with strong geostrophic jets and eddy formation (Tomczak, 1998). As such, this feature 

also acts as a source of offshore transport and lateral mixing, producing subsurface intrusions along 

the front (Zenk et al., 1991; Martínez-Marrero et al., 2008). Finally, its existence is – as for the 

interaction of the large-scale current system (Lázaro et al., 2005) – potentially favourable for the 

aggregation of large pelagic highly migratory fish species, being thus of great socio-economic 

importance (Fernandes et al., 2000). Given the complexity of the regional surface circulation, a 

detailed description of the main current systems follows.  

 

Figure 2.4 – Representation of the mean surface ocean currents and features: CC - Canary Current; NEC - North Equatorial Current; 

NECC - North Equatorial Counter-Current; MC - Mauritania Current; GD - Guinea Dome; CVFZ – Cape Verde Frontal Zone. Note 

the different colormaps. Data: GlobCurrent Geostrophic + Ekman. 

Canary Current (CC) – In its southern limit, this current transports cold water from north to 

south off the African coast, being stronger in summer near the African coast while in winter it is 

stronger west of the Canary Islands (Stramma and Siedler, 1988). At latitudes near Cape Blanc (20º 

– 25ºN in spring and autumn, respectively) it turns south-westward, leaving the African coast to 

become the NEC (Mittelstaedt, 1983, 1991; Stramma et al., 2005). The location of such departure 

from the coast is extremely relevant for the position of the CVFZ (Stramma and Siedler, 1988). 

Since it does not have a direct impact on the archipelago, this current is only pertinent because of 

the latter statements. 



16 

 

North Equatorial Current (NEC) – The southern part of the Atlantic tropical gyre – where 

subduction takes place (e.g., Schott et al., 2004; Stramma et al., 2005) – is characterised by a 10-

15 cm.s-1 mean speed with a dominant west/north-westward direction (Richardson and Walsh, 

1986; Stramma and Siedler, 1988; Zhang et al., 2003), although some authors argue that it has a 

predominant south-westward direction visible throughout the year (Lázaro et al., 2005). As past 

studies demonstrated (Arnault, 1987; Zhang et al., 2003; Lumpkin and Garzoli, 2005; Lumpkin 

and Pazos, 2007), this difference in current direction is entirely related with the nature of the 

method determining it, i.e. from purely geostrophic derivation (the latter) to the incorporation of 

the Ekman transport (the former). According to the Ekman theory, the wind-driven component of 

transport in the surface boundary layer is directed perpendicularly to the right (left) of the mean 

wind stress in the northern (southern) hemisphere (Ekman, 1905). Thus, it is reasonable to assume 

that wind-driven Ekman transport has a significant impact in the region, as it is further 

demonstrated by the representation of the Ekman volume transport (Figure 2.5).  

 

Figure 2.5 – Wind (black arrows) velocity and estimated Ekman volume transport per meter width (red arrows) represented over 

wind stress. Data: QuikSCAT and ASCAT.  

When NEC reaches the archipelago’s latitude it is divided in two branches (Figure 2.6), one 

turning south-westwards north of Cabo Verde islands and the other becoming a southwest flow 

south of the islands, both appearing to join at lower latitudes (Lázaro et al., 2005). This is more 

evident during the first half of the year whereas in the other half the flow migrates northwards, 



17 

 

following the identical displacement of the NECC - both forced by the ITCZ northward migration 

(Stramma and Schott, 1999). The current intensity follows an identical seasonal pattern, weakening 

and reaching its maximum speed in summer and in spring and fall, respectively (Arnault, 1987). 

North Equatorial Counter-Current (NECC) – With an eastward mean and maximum flow 

speed of approximately 42 cm.s-1 and 147 cm.s-1, respectively (Frantantoni, 2001), this current is 

particularly strong in summer and early fall (Arnault, 1987; Mittelstaedt, 1991) – when the ITCZ 

reaches its northernmost position (Lázaro et al. 2005; Schütte et al., 2016a). It is during this period 

that the current is most likely to have an influence in the southern side of the Cape Verde 

Archipelago (Fernandes et al., 2005). In the western part, however, the current does not follow a 

continuous advective pathway, as some parcels are carried to the southern edge of NEC through 

Ekman drift (Zhang et al., 2003; Lumpkin and Garzoli, 2005). During winter and spring the strong 

trade winds are responsible for the weakening of this current, being forced to migrate to the equator 

(Mittelstaedt, 1991). Regions of high Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE) are clearly associated with this 

current (Lázaro et el., 2005).  

Mauritania Current (MC) – It is a result from the interception of NECC with the African 

coast. Part of its flow is derived northward, carrying warm oligotrophic equatorial water to the 

tropical eastern Atlantic (Mittelstaedt, 1991). Thus, the strength of this current is strongly related 

to the seasonal varying NECC, with about 1-month time lag (Lázaro et al., 2005). MC only reaches 

the latitude of approximately 14ºN during winter and early spring, but due to the relaxation of the 

trade winds and the consequent northward displacement and strengthening of NECC, it reaches 

latitudes of approximately 20ºN during summer and early autumn (Figure 2.6) and it is partly 

responsible for the suppression of the regional costal upwelling (Mittelstaedt, 1991). Schütte et al. 

(2016a) suggested that this current is strongly associated with the formation of eddies that 

propagate westward in the direction of Cape Verde.  

The Guinea Dome (GD) – Located southwest of the archipelago, this geostrophic cyclonic 

feature is defined by a (cold) dome of the isotherms, and low hydrostatic pressure (Faye et al., 

2015), developed due to the Ekman suction (upwelling) driven by the local wind stress curl 

(Richardson and Walsh, 1986; Siedler et al., 1992; Yamagata and Iizuka, 1995). It exists 

permanently during the year and it is a constituent of the large-scale near-surface flow fields 

associated with the NEC, the NECC and the North Equatorial Undercurrent (Siedler et al., 1992). 

The NECC is responsible for the variability of the position, shape, and intensity of the such feature 



18 

 

(Lázaro et al., 2005). Thus, its signal is more evident between May and December, following a 

similar displacement as the NECC when it moves north-westward.  

 

Figure 2.6 - Representation of the seasonal mean surface currents, from 2003 to 2014. Note the different colormaps. Data: 

GlobCurrent Geostrophic + Ekman. 

Following the main large-scale surface currents description, a conspicuous seasonal signal has 

been documented (Figure 2.6) as the dominant aspect in the region (Mittelstaedt et al., 1991; Lázaro 

et al. 2005), being mainly induced by the variability of the trade winds (Stramma and Schott, 1999).   

Trade winds and the ITCZ generate large scale divergent Ekman transports along the western 

African coast (Faye et al., 2015), leading to one of the strongest and most productive upwelling 

systems in the world (Ould-dedah et al., 1999). Costal upwelling is permanent between 20º – 25ºN, 

reaching its maximum intensity during spring and autumn (Figure 2.7, Mittelstaedt, 1991; Ould-

dedah, et al., 1999). South of 20ºN this phenomenon is conspicuous during winter and early spring 

(Van Camp et al., 1991; Nykjær and Van Camp, 1994; Lázaro et al., 2005) and is associated with 

a significant enhancement of biological productivity (Pelegrí et al., 2006; Lathuilière et al., 2008, 

Demarcq and Somoue, 2015), which is also partially driven by the southward transport of cold, 

nutrient-rich water from the CC (Mittelstaedt, 1991). The strength and seasonal oscillation of the 

coastal upwelling depends mainly on the alongshore wind-stress and wind-stress curl seasonal 



19 

 

patterns (Hagen, 2001; Pradhan et al., 2006), and in the seasonal variation of the MC extension 

(Mittelstaedt, 1991; Siedler et al., 1992; Lázaro et al., 2005). 

 

Figure 2.7 - Sea Surface Temperature seasonal means from 2003 to 2014. It is worth noting the apparent warm wake in the lee of 

Santo Antão and Fogo Islands.  

This region experiences on of the largest Sea Surface Temperature (SST) cycles in the tropics 

(Faye et al., 2015). The SST variation has a considerable lower amplitude in offshore waters than 

in coastal waters (Figure 2.8), a fact that is conspicuously related to the coastal upwelling seasonal 

cycle (e.g., Mittelstaedt, 1991; Van Camp et al., 1991; Ould-dedah et al., 1999; Marcello et al., 

2011). In the area of Cape Verde Islands, maximum values (29 ºC) are achieved from July to 

November (Figure 2.7) – coincidently with higher pigment concentrations near Cape Verde 

(Fernandes et al., 2005) –, whilst minimum values (21 – 22ºC) are conversely seen between 

December and May (DGA, 2004).  



20 

 

 

Figure 2.8 – Sea Surface Temperature standard deviation showing the effect of the seasonal variability associated with upwelling 

off the western African coast.  

Acting as a source of organic matter, inorganic nutrients and phytoplankton in the region, it has 

been consistently reported the generation of giant filaments off Cape Blanc (e.g., Gabric et al., 

1993; Kostianoy and Zatsepin, 1996; Lange et al., 1998; Pastor et al., 2008; Meunier et al., 2012; 

Pelegrí and Peña?Izquierdo, 2015). The filament can have a significant impact on the archipelago’s 

biological productivity (Fernandes et al., 2005), acting as remote enrichment. This feature results 

from the intersection of the Mauritanian coastal upwelling system and the very complex and 

dynamic CVFZ, as intrinsically unstable upwelling currents interact with the Cape Verde front 

eddy field (Meunier et al., 2012). This phenomenon seems to be responsible for the transport of 

cold nutrient-rich water offshore and plays a crucial part in the generation of the Cap Blanc 

filaments (Meunier et al., 2012), which have reportedly increased their offshore spreading during 

the last years (Marcello et al., 2011). Lastly, it is important to note that the atmospheric deposition 

of Saharan dust is an important source of essential and limiting nutrients (Gelado?Caballero, 2015) 

– such as silicon, phosphorus, nitrogen, and iron. However, only 5% of the Chla variability in the 

region was related to the dust input (Ohde and Siegel, 2010).

3. Data Acquisition and Processing  

Taking into account the inherent complexity and variability associated to eddies and other 

pertinent mesoscale processes, the coupling of several satellite-based remote-sensing products is 

considered to be the most efficient approach for the study of the Cape Verde Archipelago. It is 

important to note that, given the exploratory nature of such investigation, the planning and structure 

of the current project is directly dependent on the preliminary results. Therefore, a behaviour-

oriented approach is executed, first by performing an initial characterisation of the regional setting. 

This preliminary investigation is defined at 10 – 50ºW and 4 – 24ºN, extending almost the entire 

zonal length of the Atlantic Ocean, from the western African coast to the eastern South American 

coast. It is important to note, however, that part of this characterisation was already described in 

the previous chapter. Then, the representation and analysis of sequential 8-day averages was 

performed, considering the recurrent period of most satellites and datasets being used (~4 days). 

Subsequently, simple statistical procedures were applied, along with the computation of 12-year 

and seasonal means. The seasonal grouping refers to the northern hemisphere (i.e., boreal seasons), 

such that: winter goes from January to March; spring goes from April to June, summer goes from 

July to September; and Autumn goes from October to December.  

Once the preliminary analysis was concluded, special attention was regarded towards the eddy 

field around and within the archipelago. Hence, two groups of eddies were defined: the far-field 

eddies – those that were created outside the Cape Verde Area (hereinafter referred as CV area) but 

at some point intersected the delimited CV area; and the near-field eddies – those created inside 

CV area, whether by island-induced mechanisms or by far-field eddy-island interaction. The 

statistics of these two groups of eddies were further described, along with the representations of 

their geographical distribution and associated kinematic properties. Then, a more detailed analysis 

of the far and near-field eddy dynamics was conducted. Lastly, the final focus of the study was 

directed to the biological implications of the such physical processes. 

The study period was set from 2003 to 2014 based the data availability of the selected variables 

(Table 3.1). Furthermore, MatLab was used for most the data download, subsampling and 

processing. The “cmocean” tool for MatLab was used for some plots, enabling a more realistic and 

effective representation of the data (Thyng et al., 2016). When necessary, plots were edited in 

Inkscape.

3.1. Wind 

The importance of the wind as a driver for oceanic surface currents has long been well 

established (Pond and Pickard, 1983; Tomczak and Godfrey, 1994; Talley et al., 2011). Given the 

nature of the mechanism in study and all that was mentioned before, wind data is undoubtedly an 

essential tool for the regional oceanographic characterisation at a large scale and for the 

investigation of the archipelago’s impact in the wind dynamics at a local scale. 

As such, wind speed and direction was provided by the QuikSCAT scatterometer-derived 

dataset (SeaPAC, 2016), considered to be an accurate representation of oceanic winds (Couvelard 

et al., 2012). It was produced by NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory and distributed by the NASA 

Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC). This instrument was part 

of a “quick recovery” mission (hence the naming of the project) designed to fill the gap created by 

the premature loss of the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) aboard the ADEOS-1 satellite in June 

1997 (Lungu, 2001). The scatterometer measured the wind roughened ocean surface – which is 

highly correlated with the near-surface wind field (Hoffman and Leidner, 2005) – through 

microwave pulses emitted by the rotating dish antenna at Ku-band (13.4 GHz) (Spencer et al., 

2000). The power of the “backscattered” signal is then used for inferring the wind speed and 

direction. The usage of a microwave radar (an active sensor) implies that data can be retrieved 

under all weather and cloud conditions (Moroni et al., 2013). However, there are some limitations, 

such as rain contaminations and high wind speed measurements. The satellite has a recurrent period

of approximately ~4 days (57 orbits) and the capacity for collecting an 1800 km-wide band. The 

combination of the orbital period (14.25 orbits/day) and inclination (98.62º) resulted in a 

remarkable 90% daily coverage of the global ice-free ocean (Moroni et al., 2013).  

Despite the original spatial resolution of the sensor, higher resolution is achieved through a 

slice composite technique from level 1 data (PO.DAAC, 2017). Thus, QuikScat data is available 

at 12.5 km and 25 km spatial resolution, yet with distinct levels of processing. The sparser 

resolution (25 km) is distributed at processing level 3, which means that the data is available at a 

daily or time averaged spatially fixed and uniform grid. However, the higher-resolution data (12.5 

km) is only available at level 2, meaning that the data is mapped over an along-track/cross-track 

non-uniform swath grid (i.e. organized by swath rows perpendicular to satellite path), and each file 

contains data of a single satellite orbit. Despite the advantage of a high processing level, one must 

consider that the Cape Verde Islands are relatively small and higher pixel size (wind vector cell) 

results in a lower resolution. The algorithm behind the 12.5 km resolution data processing was 

subjected to significant improvements recently, tackling issues such as rain contaminations, 

sampling limitations and ambiguous direction retrievals (Fore et al., 2014). Moreover, by 

incorporating an enhanced coastal processing method, the near-shore wind variations is now more 

accurate than ever before (PO.DAAC, 2017). That being said, the reprocessed QuikSCAT Level 

2B Version 3.1 product is considered to be the best suited dataset for the current study. The data 

subsampling and download was made through the “High-level Tool for Interactive Data 

Extraction” website (https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/hitide/). After download, the data was 

projected into a spatially uniform 12.5 km (~0.1º) resolution grid and averaged over 8 days, so that 

the gaps created by the satellite tracks could be minimised. This way, every place in the study area 

was covered at least two times. Albeit it exceeded its operational time expectancy, QuikSCAT data 

is only available until November 2009. Taking into consideration that most variables availability 

are overlapped from 2003 to 2014 (Table 3.1), a different dataset should be incorporated. 

The Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) is a real aperture radar based instrument aboard the 

MetOp-A and MetOp-B polar satellites, which became fully operational in May 2007 and 

September 2011, respectively, and remain active to date. The satellites were launched by the 

European Space Agency (ESA) and are operated by the “European Organisation for the 

Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites” (EUMETSAT, 2015). It uses a similar system as the 

QuikSCAT instrument, in the sense that it measures near-surface wind properties (at 10-m above

the sea surface) by inferring the sea surface roughness by microwave radar. Nonetheless, this sensor 

differs from the QuikSCAT in technical specifications and configuration. It is composed by two 

sets of three fixed antennas with 45º inclination, which pulsate radar beams at a frequency of 5.26 

GHz (C-band) – more robust in terms of rain contamination – on both sides of the satellite ground 

track, covering two 550 km-wide swaths separated by ~700 km (OSI SAF, 2016). The version 2.1 

of the ASCAT (MetOp-A) wind product is provided by the Remote Sensing System organisation 

(RSS, 2017), which underwent a reprocessing procedure by applying a new the Geophysical Model 

Function (GMF), based on the Ku-band GMF (QuikSCAT) methodology. As such, ASCAT is now 

in better agreement with the QuikSCAT dataset (Ricciardulli, 2016), being thus the best option to 

fulfil the purpose of the current study. The swath files at 12.5 km spatial resolution (Ricciardulli 

and Wentz, 2016) were downloaded from the company’s FTP server and processed with MatLab 

routines, made available by RSS (2017). After this, and following the same methodology as for the 

QuikSCAT, the data was gridded and time averaged, so that the two datasets could be merged. 

• Data Processing 

The wind itself can only have an influence in the ocean as a frictional force, which arises from 

the relative motion between the atmosphere and the ocean (Stewart, 2008). As such, the transfer of 

momentum is due to the input of energy (N.m-2) by the wind in the form of wind stress. However, 

wind retrievals from scatterometer instruments are calibrated against the equivalent 10-m neutral 

wind rather than wind stress, because the latter is difficult to measure directly (Chavanne et al., 

2002). Thus, the wind stress (?????) is calculated based on Gill (1982):  

 ????? =  ???? ?? ?
2 (1) 

where ????  is the density of the air (1.2 kg.m
-3), ?? is the non-linear wind-drag coefficient – based 

on Large and Pond (1981), modified for low wind speeds (Trenberth et al., 1990) –, and ? is the 

wind speed at 10 m above sea surface, which in turn is calculated by the metric: 

 ? = ??2 + ?2  (2) 

where ? and ? are the zonal and meridional wind components (m.s-1), respectively. Another 

valuable parameter is the wind stress curl (? × ????? ). It is calculated by the Equation 3:  

 
? × ????? =  

???
??

?
???
??

 (3) 



25 

 

where ?? and ?? are the zonal and meridional wind stress components, respectively. This parameter 

is directly proportional to the vertical water displacement in ocean’s interior. Thus, for the northern 

hemisphere, upwelling results from positive (divergent/cyclonic) wind stress curl and downwelling 

results from negative (convergent/anticyclonic) wind stress curl (Talley et al., 2011). Furthermore, 

upwelling is referred to Ekman suction, while downwelling is referred to as Ekman pumping. 

Lastly, the horizontal component of the wind-driven Ekman (volume) transport (??? ) is calculated 

according to Smith (1968) and Bakun (1973): 

 
??? =  

1

??? ?
????? (4) 

where ???  is the reference seawater density (1024 kg.m
-3) and ? is the Coriolis parameter, in which:  

 ? = 2? sin ? (5) 

where ? is the earth rotation rate (7.2921 × 10?5 rad.s-1) and ? is the latitude (Stewart, 2011).  

3.2. Ocean Surface Currents 

Ocean surface currents are the horizontal movement of water at the oceans mixed layer, which 

is the upper boundary layer (or Ekman layer) and a zone of momentum exchange from the 

atmosphere to the sea (Tomczak and Godfrey, 1964). The varying temporal and spatial scales, in 

conjunction with the countless number of factors which drive the motion of the ocean’s surface, 

makes the ocean currents to behave in a very complex manner. In-situ measurements are reliable 

but limited in spatial coverage and regularity. Satellite remote sensing, however, is an ideal tool 

for studying ocean surface dynamics at a large scale (Dohan and Maximenko, 2010), since it 

provides global observations at a regular basis. In order to assess the nature and behaviour of the 

oceanic currents at a regional and local scale, two similar datasets were considered.  

Ocean Surface Current Analyses Real-time (OSCAR) is a NASA funded research project – 

operated by Earth &amp;amp; Space Research institute (ESR) – that provides surface current velocities 

(averaged over the top 30 m of the ocean) calculated from the combination of several satellite 

sensed datasets, these being Sea Level Anomaly (SLA)1, Winds2 and SST3 (Dohan and

Maximenko, 2010). On the top of providing a near real-time global coverage of the ocean surface 

currents, one of the project’s main objective is to improve the knowledge of the mechanisms behind 

the transfer of momentum between the atmosphere and the ocean (ESR, 2017a). To that end, the 

model calculations take into account the principles of geostrophy – calculating the pressure 

gradient from the SLA – and the wind driven velocity components – calculating Ekman-Stommel 

equations, as well as thermal wind induced currents (Hausman et al., 2009). With a 5-day temporal 

resolution, this product extends from 1992 to present day and is spatially distributed over a 1/3º 

resolution grid. Substantial calibration and validation of the modelled data is regularly performed 

by ESR using drifter and mooring data (ESR, 2017b). The correlation coefficient between model 

and drifter data (for the period of 2005 to 2009) is ~0.55 for the area of Cape Verde (Annex B.1). 

Furthermore, the visual comparison between OSCAR’s and moored zonal and meridional 

velocities near to the archipelago (Annex B.2) indicates a similar general pattern, though far from 

being identical.    

GlobCurrent is another reliable product, based on the same processing principles of OSCAR. 

Funded by ESA Data User Element, this project relies on advanced processing tools and simulation 

models that used satellite4 and in-situ5 data for producing an optimized approximation of the global 

surface ocean circulation (ESA, 2015). Covering the period from 1993 to 2016, several datasets 

are provided, such as individual Geostrophic, Ekman and Stokes Drift current components, as well 

as the combined Geostrophic and Ekman currents at the surface and 15 m depth. All the datasets 

are available at a daily interval and at 1/4º resolution. However, one must consider that the effective 

temporal and spatial resolution for the combined Geostrophic and Ekman currents is of the order 

of 5-10 days and 50-100 km, respectively (ESA, 2015), which in turn is related with the sensor 

limitations of the altimetry product being used. Despite this, it remains to be a valid option, since 

mesoscale eddies and strong ocean currents are found at spatial scales that vary between tens to 

several hundred kilometres and timescales of days to years (Talley et al., 2011).  

Quantitative comparisons between the combined GlobCurrent, OSCAR and SVP-type drifter 

data6 were performed for the period ranging from September 2012 to September 2013 at a global

scale (Table 3.2). The 3-day low pass filter was applied to eliminate high-frequency ageostrophic 

signals which cannot be reproduced in the modelled data (ESA, 2015). Despite the minor 

differences in correlation, GlobCurrent is in better agreement with SVP data.

Taking all things into consideration, the GlobCurrent combined currents proved to be the best 

option for this study for two main reasons: higher temporal and spatial resolution (even though it 

is achieved by interpolation); and higher scores in the correlation between in-situ data. The data 

subset and download was performed in Matlab through GlobCurrent’s OpenDAP server 

(http://www.ifremer.fr/opendap/cerdap1/globcurrent/). These files were already provided at 

processing level 4, which means that no further data mapping or compilation was required.  

• Data Processing 

The Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE) for surface currents is a valuable measurement for the 

estimation of mesoscale variability, since it is directly linked to the input of kinetic energy 

exclusively induced by eddies (e.g., Lázaro et al., 2005; Calil et al., 2008; Chaigneau et al., 2008; 

Lathuilière et al., 2008; Yoshida et al., 2010; Jia et al., 2011; Caldeira et al., 2017). EKE was first 

derived from ship drift observations, but in current times it is easily constructed from surface drifter 

velocities (Richardson, 1983; Frantantoni, 2001) and from surface velocities derived from altimetry 

products (Talley et al., 2011) – as it is the case for the current dataset. As such, this parameter was 

computed using the following Equation (6): 

 
??? =

(?2 + ?2) (6) 

where ? and ? correspond to the zonal and meridional current velocity components, respectively.

3.3. Eddies 

Given the fact that mesoscale eddies have distinctive characteristics that can be used for this 

purpose – such as temperature anomalies (Caldeira et al., 2002;  Sangrà et al., 2004; Caldeira et 

al., 2014), surface roughness signature (Fu and Holt, 1983; Yamaguchi and Kawamura, 2009; 

Karimova, 2009), enhanced levels of primary production (Arístegui et al., 1997; Basterretxea et 

al., 2005; Gaube et al., 2013), sea surface elevation/depressions (Chelton et al., 2011; Schütte et 

al., 2016a), among others (Munk et al., 2000; Calil et al., 2008; Jia et al., 2011) – one may arrive 

to the false assumption that autonomous methods for eddy detection and tracking are easily 

achieved. The fact is that only altimetry can provide a regular and reliable monitoring capability 

for mesoscale eddies, since it performs well regardless of the cloud cover and oceanic conditions 

(Robinson., 2010). Still, altimetry-based tools are susceptible to errors, because it attempts to detect 

the presence of three-dimensional features using sea surface information that is subjected to a 

variety of processes other than eddies (Faghmous et al., 2015a). That being said, two very similar 

altimetry-based products were considered and are further discussed.  

The “Mesoscale Eddies in Altimeter Observations of SSH” dataset (hereinafter CSS11) was 

produced by Dudley Chelton and Michael Schlax at the Oregon State University (Chelton and 

Schlax, 2017). It relies on the usage of a SLA dataset (DT-2014 MSLA) provided by the Archiving 

Validation and Interpretation of Satellite Data in Oceanography (AVISO) to identify and determine 

eddy parameters, such as its nature (cyclonic/anticyclonic), swirl speed, amplitude and radius 

(Chelton et al., 2011). It is based on the premise that an eddy must be a propagating, compact and 

coherent structure in the space-time Sea Surface Height (SSH) fields (Schlax and Chelton, 2016). 

The latest version of this product is based on Williams et al. (2011) method, which defines an 

anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddy by first finding the local SLA maximum (minimum) and then 

connecting all the adjacent pixels that satisfy a set of five conditions7 (Chelton et al., 2011) and in 

which the corresponding SLA lies above a sequence of successively decreasing (increasing) 

thresholds (Schlax and Chelton, 2016). Despite its reliability, only eddies with a minimum 

amplitude and lifetime of 1 cm and 4 weeks, respectively, are retained. This is a big disadvantage 

since, according to Schütte et al. (2016a), the average eddy lifetime in the study area varies between 

                                                 
7 SLA values for each pixel must be above or below a given threshold; The delimited area of an eddy must be comprised 

between a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 1000 pixels; A local maximum/minimum must exist; The amplitude (SLA 

gradient) must be at least 1 cm; The distance between any pair of points cannot exceed a specified maximum.  



29 

 

24 and 32 days. The latter authors also suggest that some eddies may disappear from one timestep 

to another – due to the separation of satellite ground tracks – driving this kind of algorithms to 

falsely identify lost eddies as new. Nonetheless, the most limiting factor of this dataset is the 

occasional large jumps in eddy locations associated to the changing of a 7-day to daily SSH 

sampling frequency (Chelton and Schlax, 2017). Such jumps make eddy trajectories to be 

inaccurate, making this product unreliable. 

Keeping that in mind, an alternative dataset should be considered. Faghmous et al. (2015a) 

presented and made publicly available the OpenEddy tool. It differentiates from most of the eddy 

detection products in the sense that, besides providing a daily dataset containing eddy features and 

trajectories, the authors also provide the eddy detection and tracking source code (in Python and 

MatLab) so that the procedure can be carried based on the user’s research purpose. Similarly to 

CS11, Faghmous et al. (2015a) product relies on daily SLA maps from AVISO. Nevertheless, it 

strives to be as threshold-free as possible, since the only obvious limitation is related to the 

minimum eddy size (4 pixels, which corresponds to ~30 km radius), which in turn is intrinsically 

related to the SLA product’s resolution. Another (and possibly the biggest) advantage of this 

algorithm is the ability to search and find prematurely terminated eddies. This is achieved by 

searching for eddies with the same characteristics (size, amplitude, etc.) for a user-specified number 

of time-steps before terminating the track. Then, the search radius is attributed to the maximum 

translation distance of that eddy, by estimating its expected propagation speed (Faghmous et al., 

2015a). Nonetheless, it should be noted that the susceptibility to error in associating supposedly 

terminated eddies to interpolated tracks increases with the number of associated time-steps 

(Faghmous et al., 2015a).  

The biggest disadvantage of this tool is related with the eddy detection method. Considering 

that the geostrophic flow around eddies follows the closed contours of SLA, this algorithm 

identifies an eddy by determining the outermost closed contours of SLA containing a single 

maximum or minimum extreme (Figure 3.1). This can contribute to an overestimation of the eddy’s 

size and may also lead to the cancelling of small features that are close to each other, making the 

eddy identification less robust than CSS11 latest version. Despite this, the algorithm is still capable 

of recovering 96.4% of features identified by domain experts (Faghmous et al., 2015a).   

All things considered, the eddy tracking was performed using the OpenEddy MatLab scripts 

(https://github.com/jfaghm/OceanEddies) and an already processed dataset containing all 

https://github.com/jfaghm/OceanEddies

mesoscale eddy features that were at least 4 grid cells large (Faghmous et al., 2015b). The tracking 

procedure was constrained to the following conditions: every eddy, regardless of the lifetime, was 

included in the analysis; the minimum area was set to the lowest possible (radius of ~30 km); no 

threshold was set regarding the amplitude; and the tolerance number of timesteps in which a 

terminated eddy can be traced was set to 3 days – built on the assumption that an island-induced 

eddy takes on average 3 days to fully rotate on itself (Sangrà et al., 2005; 2007, Barton, 2001). 

Lastly, the final dataset was transformed into a CS11-like format to simplify further analysis.  

 

Figure 3.1 - The mesoscale eddies contours identified by the OpenEddy algorithm. Colors represent the number of experts that 

validated each feature. Retrieved from Faghmous et al. (2015a). 

From Figure 3.1 one may observe that most eddies detected by the algorithm do not necessarily 

have a perfectly circular shape to be considered as such. Thus, the algorithm determines the eddy 

radius (?) as a function of the area (?) – i.e., the radius of a circle with area equal to that within 

the closed contour of SSH – following Equation (2): 

 

? =  ?
?

?
 (7) 



31 

 

The eddy amplitude is also determined by the algorithm as the difference in height between the 

SLA extremes and is always given has an absolute value. The combination of the two previous 

parameters is then used for the determination of the geostrophic swirl speed. However, an issue 

was detected regarding this parameter, which is further discussed in Chapter 5.2. Lastly, the 

travelled distance (??) and translation speed (?) are two important parameters for the current study, 

but were not included in the OpenEddy algorithms. Thus, a MatLab script was created for the 

calculation of such parameters, using the coordinates of the detected eddies. The travelled distance 

is computed using the following Equation 8:   

 ?? =  
?. ?

180
 × cos?1( sin ?? . sin ?? + cos ??. cos ?? . cos??)   (8) 

where ? is earth’s radius (6378 km), ?? and ?? are the latitudes of point ? and point ?, respectively, 

and ?? is the longitudinal difference between both points (Movable Type Scripts, 2017). 

Subsequently, the eddy propagation speed (?) was estimated following Equation 9: 

 
? =  

??
??

 (9) 

where ?? is the time interval between point ? and point ?. 

3.4. Absolute Dynamic Topography 

The usage of altimetry-based products is fundamental for this study. The principle behind 

altimetry-sensed measurements is very similar to the wind scatterometer. However, instead of 

“sweeping” an area and relying only in the backscattered signal’s power, the sensor measures the 

shape and more importantly the signal’s travel time, estimating the distance of the satellite to the 

point directly below it – known as Nadir (Robinson, 2010). Albeit the eddy detection and tracking 

algorithms didn’t require this dataset, it is still essential to include this parameter in order to access 

its variability in space and time, and to facilitate the study of individual eddies. For this reason, the 

AVISO Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT) dataset (DT-MADT) was downloaded from the 

Copernicus Marine and Environment Monitoring Service8. It is part of the Ssalto/DUACS system, 

that processes data from all altimeter missions (Saral, Cryosat-2, Jason-1&amp;amp;2, T/P, Envisat, GFO,

ERS-1 &amp;amp; 2 and Geosat) in an attempt to provide a consistent and homogeneous dataset for various 

uses (AVISO, 2015). Furthermore, the combination of several altimetry datasets into one single 

product considerably improves the capacity for detecting mesoscale features such as fronts, eddies 

and even filaments (Pascual et al., 2006) 

The ADT is the sum of the SLA and the Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT) (Figure 3.2; Mertz 

et al., 2017), or in other words, ADT corresponds to the SSH, but with respect to the geoid (GOCE 

DIR-R4), because the SSH is referenced to the ellipsoid. The ADT is a relevant parameter for the 

computation of seasonal and annual means. For the identification of single features, however, the 

SLA is the most adequate parameter to use, since it represents the absolute signal variation from 

the time-averaged signal. There are two ways of computing the SLA: one is with respect to the 

ellipsoid, which corresponds to the SSH deviation from the Mean Sea Surface (MSS); another is 

with respect to the geoid, which corresponds to the ADT deviation from the MDT. Regardless of 

the method, the anomaly signal remains the same as long as the correct mean is used as a reference. 

Thus, the SLA was computed using the 12-year MDT previously calculated from the ADT field.

3.5. Chlorophyll a 

In the interest of determining the biological impact of the physical mechanisms being studied, 

as well as the remote-enrichment that may reach the Cape Verde Islands from the African coast 

(Fernandes et al., 2005; Lathuilière et al., 2008), monthly and 8-day averaged surface Chla satellite 

observations were retrieved from the “OceanColor” server 

(https://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODIS-Aqua/Mapped/) with a 4.63-km spatial resolution. 

Chla is the most important pigment in the respiration process of photosynthetic organisms, such as 

phytoplankton (Talley et al., 2011). It absorbs mostly blue wave light (440 nm) and reflects the 

green. This is called the blue/green ratio and can be used as a proxy for determining primary 

production (Robinson, 2010; Gove et al., 2016). However, this technique relies on passive sensors, 

which in turn are constrained by cloud coverage (Caldeira et al., 2014). This is a significant 

limitation for this particular study, since Cape Verde is often under cloudy conditions due to the 

seasonal positioning of the ITCZ (Fernandes et al., 2000; Karstensen et al., 2015). Furthermore, it 

is important to note that the overestimation of Chla concentration may occur – provoked by the 

presence of aerosols and dust load in the atmosphere, and suspended sediments in surface water 

(Helmke et al., 2005; Tilstone et al., 2011). This dataset was recorded by the Moderate Resolution 

Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument flying aboard NASA Aqua satellite. It has a 

viewing swath width of ~2330 km in a sun synchronous polar orbit, providing an almost complete 

global coverage in one day (Savtchenko et al., 2004).  

3.6. Sea Surface Temperature 

Lastly, SST was provided by the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature – a group 

composed by several international partners that assembles and delivers SST data obtained from 10 

different satellite sensors (GHRSST, 2017). It offers a wide variety of spatial resolutions, from 

infra-red high-resolution instruments limited by cloud cover, to microwave coarser-resolution 

instruments with little limitations (Kaiser et al., 2012). It is intended to be used as an auxiliary 

dataset for eddy identification, considering that anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddies have a distinct warm 

(cold) SST signature at its core (Robinson, 2010). It is also a valuable tool for the regional oceanic 

characterisation, since it can detect major mesoscale features, such as fronts, upwelling episodes 

and filaments that may originate at the Mauritanian coast (e.g., Mittelstaedt, 1983; Van Camp et 

al., 1991; Gabric et al., 1993; Barton et al., 1998; Lathuilière et al., 2008; Meunier et al., 2012).

4. Results  

Considering the exploratory nature of the current study, only the most relevant results are 

presented in this section. Further supplementary material – such as sequential 8-day average plots 

for wind, current, ADT, Chla, and SST – was produced in order to observe the mesoscale variability 

in space and time. As part of a preliminary analysis, these results are extremely relevant, in the 

sense that it determined with great extension the planning and execution of the study. However, 

given the substantial number of plots (and the digital memory size), only the SLA and eddy 

trajectories 5-day sequential plots are included in digital format as supplementary material.  

In the first part of this chapter a general approach was performed, converging into a more 

detailed characterisation along the process. Thus, the initial analysis is focused on the 12-year 

annual mean and seasonal description of the regional eddy signatures. Secondly, a zoom in 

approach is conducted in order to characterise the eddy field within and around the archipelago. At 

this stage, special attention is given to the geographical distribution and descriptive statistics of the 

eddy kinematic properties. Subsequently, far-field eddies that are generated at the Mauritanian 

coast and move westward into the Cape Verde area are assessed, with the main objective of 

determining spatial and temporal patterns, as well as the island-eddy interaction. For that, specific 

eddy trajectories are presented and further described. Then, following the same approach as the 

latter, the near-field eddy characterisation is conducted. Lastly, the local biological realm is 

characterised, along with the main mechanisms supporting it – i.e., remote enrichment and IME.  

Different eddy-lifetime thresholds were used, depending on the nature of the analysis being 

performed. It is very important to filter the spurious from the most relevant eddies and still have a 

sufficiently large population to execute a robust geographical and statistical characterisation. 

Conversely, many eddy trajectories plotted in a map can superimpose each other, masking 

important patterns such as their origins and evolution in space and time. A series of thresholds were 

tested (1, 7, 30, 60 and 90 days; Annex C: and Annex D:) in order to find the ones that, without 

compromising the most relevant signals and patterns, could be used for the two main analysis. As 

such, a 1, 30 and 60-day thresholds were set for the descriptive statistics (and respective graphical 

representations), for the eddy kinematic geographical distribution and for the characterisation of 

the far and near-field eddies dynamics, respectively.

4.1. Regional Eddy Signatures 

For the purpose of inferring the eddies dynamic signature in the regional oceanographic 

background, particularly their geographical and seasonal patterns, the 12-year annual and seasonal 

EKE field is further described. EKE is one of the most elementary parameters in this kind of studies, 

mainly because the representation of such parameter makes the main eddy hotspots and pathways 

obvious and easy to detect (Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2). Furthermore, EKE signals represent the 

energy exclusively induced by eddies in the environment, but it does not discriminate eddy hotspots 

from pathways. Only the intensity and the frequency of the such features can be traced. Given the 

fact that an area of extremely elevated EKE levels is present between the 4 and 9ºN, two different 

areas and respective colormaps were defined. A grey-scale colormap with a bigger range was used 

for the southernmost and northernmost area. These areas are of less interest and are hereinafter 

referred as the “grey area”. As for the main study area, a “rainbow” colormap with a smaller range 

was used. 

The most evident feature in the 12-year mean EKE map (Figure 4.1) is easily identified as a 

transversal band of high EKE values, varying from ~40 to more than 100 cm2.s-2. It extends the 

entire tropical basin (16 – 50ºW), from Cape Blanc to the south-westernmost region. Within this 

band, the highest values are detected in the proximity of Cape Blanc and north of the windward 

islands, with values reaching ~100 cm2.s-2. The latter signal is characterised by an elongated shape, 

and although it is still within the major transversal band of high EKE, one should not neglect the 

possibility of an independent pathway for far-field turbulent mesoscale features. 

Another area of great interest is located west of Fogo Island (25ºW), in the leeward group of 

islands. This feature is detached from the previous zonal band, because it is quite isolated from the 

latter and its signal is confined into a circular area. It has approximately 1º (~111 km) diameter and 

presents EKE values in the order of ~100 cm2.s-2.  

 Two other areas of significant EKE values are shown: one located in the African coast at 11ºN 

latitude; and another in the opposite side of the regional study area. However, due to their locations, 

these areas are not relevant for the present study. In the “grey area”, a significant EKE signal covers 

the entire zonal extend, with values reaching more than 1000 cm2.s-2 in the western section. 



36 

 

 

Figure 4.1 – Mean EKE for the 12-year study period in the region of Cape Verde.  

In respect to the seasonal EKE signal, Figure 4.2 shows significant differences between the four 

seasons. A characterisation for all seasons follows:  

Spring: the transversal band is not so pronounced as in the annual mean, but high values are 

still present near Cape Blanc and north of the windward islands (~140 and ~80 cm2.s-2, 

respectively). In this season, the most notable features are around the Cape Verde Archipelago. 

The previously described confined area west of Fogo Island presents a strong EKE signal, with 

values around 160 cm2.s-2. Furthermore, it is possible to observe what it seems to be a major eddy 

pathway south of Fogo Island with values between 60 and 140 cm2.s-2. The latter has an initial 

south-westward direction (from approximately 20ºW 15ºN to 26ºW 10ºN), turning westward in the 

final segment (for more 3º longitude). In the south-westernmost part of the figure, an extremely 

high EKE signal appears, but due to its location is not relevant for the current study. 

Summer: It is during this season that the transversal basin-wide band of high EKE is more 

evident, showing its maximum seasonal EKE values varying from 80 to 140 cm2.s-2. Features 

previously identified around the archipelago diminishes in area and strength or even disappear, as 

it is the case of the circular area west of Fogo Island, and the case of the major pathway previously 

identified south of the archipelago, respectively. Conversely, new features arise in the African 

coast. One band is located near Cape Vert, following very closely the coastline in a northward 

orientation. Another band is located up north, detaching from the coastline and seemingly merging 

the quasi-permanent signal at Cape Blanc.   



37 

 

Autumn: the background EKE signal decreases dramatically in the main study area, being the 

basin-wide band the most evident feature, especially northward of the windward islands. An 

extremely strong signal appears in the south of the regional study area, showing evidences of the 

“grey area” northward seasonal migration. Another signal appears in the coastal zone of Guinea-

Bissau, being of less interest due to its location.   

Winter: The transversal band of high EKE signal disappears almost completely. The elongated 

signal north of the windward group is still present, with values around 60 cm2.s-2, reinforcing the 

hypothesis of a pathway independent from the transversal band. High EKE signals (~100 cm2.s-2) 

reappear around the archipelago, more specifically between the windward and the leeward group, 

and downwind of the Fogo Island. It is difficult to define these signals as distinct eddy pathways 

or places of origin, due to the elongated shapes. An interesting feature extending the oceanic area 

between the African coast and the archipelago is the apparent eddy trail, with values around 60 and 

80 cm2.s-2. It originates near Cape Vert and then divides in two branches south-east of the 

archipelago, which then seemingly appear to merge the previously described areas (north and south 

of the leeward Island).

4.2. Eddy Statistics and Geographical Distribution 

In this section, the main characteristics of the eddy field within and around the archipelago are 

presented, together with the eddy kinematic properties and respective statistics. Two geographical 

areas are defined: the general study area (hereinafter referred as outside area) is set between 32 – 

13ºW and 9 – 23ºN; and the Cape Verde area (hereinafter referred as CV area), is set to be at 

approximately 2º (~222 km) distance from the nearest islands, covering the area between 27 – 

21ºW and 13 ? 19ºN. Although the general study area covers a significantly broader area, it is the 

coastal area that deserves special attention – since most of the far-field eddies are generated there. 

Nevertheless, CV is the area of greatest interest. The statistical graphical representation of the eddy 

kinematic properties (histograms, upper-tail cumulative histograms and boxplots) follows the 

previously described eddy classification, in which the upper panel includes all eddies (regardless 

of lifetime) that were created inside the CV area; and the lower panel includes exclusively the ones 

that were created outside CV, but still within the study area. Furthermore, eddies are classified in 

three main groups, based on minimum lifetime: short (&amp;lt;30 days), medium (? 30 days) and long-

lived (? 60 days) eddies. 

A total number of 14822 eddies are identified between 2003 – 2014 in the study area, in which 

2282 (15 %) are created in CV (Table 4.1). The polarity ratio remains evenly distributed for the 

study area, whereas in CV area anticyclonic eddies seem to be dominant over cyclonic eddies, 

increasing its dominance concurrently with the threshold’s increase. Expectedly, the total number 

of eddies decreases significantly with the threshold’s increase: 50%, 86% and 96% of the total 

population is lost when applying a 7, 30 and 60-day threshold, respectively (Table 4.1).

The exponential pattern is well represented in Figure 4.3, where red (anticyclonic) and blue 

(cyclonic) bars have a 7-day interval. Through the normal and the upper-tail cumulative histograms 

it is possible to observe that both areas follow a similar behaviour, and that the 

cyclonic/anticyclonic ratio is in equilibrium. Nevertheless, an initial ~10% difference is present 

between the two areas, as 70% and 80% of the CV and outside observations, respectively, is 

concentrated in the first 4 weeks. The boxplots confirm the previous observations, as CV eddies 

have on average slightly higher lifetime expectancy that the outside eddies (19.62 and 15.18 days, 

respectively; Table 4.2). Still, the maximum eddy lifetime recorded inside CV area was almost 250 

days, while for the outside eddies it reached ~370 days.  

 

Figure 4.3 – Lifetime statistical distribution. From left to right: Histograms, representing the number of eddies (two left panels); 

upper-tail cumulative histograms, representing the percentage of observations (third panel); and boxplots (forth panel).   

As the threshold increases to 7, 30 and 60 days, the percentage of CV eddies in relation to the 

entire study area also increases to 17 %, 21 % and 22 %, respectively (Table 4.1). These results are 

quite significant, since CV area accounts for only 16% of the total study area. The latter can be 

easily seen in Figure 4.4, which aims to assess eddy hotspots, as well as the prevailing eddy lifetime 

associated with such areas – i.e., short, medium and long-lived eddies.  

From a preliminary analysis it seems obvious that, as the lifetime threshold increases, the 

number of eddies originating in the coastal area loses its dominance to the CV area.  Regarding all 

eddies (? 1day lifetime), some hotspots are evident near Cape Blanc and in the southernmost 



40 

 

African coastal area, with values in the order of 200 and 170 – 220 eddies, respectively. Within the 

CV area, most of the boxes near the islands have a record of approximately 80 – 100 new eddies, 

which is significant but still not far from the background signal. For the 7-day threshold, however, 

the geographic patterns start to shift. The Cape Blanc area is still the main eddy hotspot, with ~110 

new eddies, whilst the southernmost coastal area loses most of its significance. The CV area retains 

most of the eddies seen in the previous threshold, becoming more highlighted. When applying a 

30-day threshold the result is even more evident. The area near Cape Blanc is close to the 

background values, with the generation of only ~20 eddies. The western African coast, especially 

near Cape Vert, shows some signals of long-lived eddies generation (17 – 24). The CV area, 

however, presents a considerable number of eddies generated in the lee of Santo Antão (~30) and 

Fogo (~27) islands. Finally, the 60-day threshold reduces significantly the number of eddy origins, 

as most of the background signal weakens. The most distinctive areas identified in the 1 and 7-day 

thresholds are lost, while the areas in the downwind regions south of Santo Antão and Fogo islands 

become even more pronounced. The area between Cape Vert and Cape Timiris also shows 

evidences of long-lived eddy generation, though not so evident as in CV area.

Regarding the eddy origins seasonal patterns, a brief characterisation is further presented, taking 

only into account medium and long-lived eddies. The most obvious patterns presented in Figure 

4.5 are located in the lee of the two highest islands – Santo Antão and Fogo. Spring seems to be 

the most homogeneous season – especially in CV area – with values between 5 and 9 evenly 

distributed in the area around the islands. During summer, however, the signal is concentrated in 

the lee of Santo Antão and Santiago Islands, while at the Mauritanian coast the signal expands 

meridionally in 3º. A similar pattern is present in Autumn, but the area southwest of Fogo Island 

becomes the dominant region – with the generation of 11 eddies –, while the area south of Santo 

Antão remains unchanged and the area between the windward and leeward groups reaches its 

maximum recorded values. Lastly in winter, the area near Cape Vert, Cape Blanc and south of 

Fogo Island have the highest number of eddies generation – these being 9, 9 and 12, respectively.

4.2.1. Eddy Kinematic Properties  

The study of the eddy kinematic properties is essential in order to understand their nature and 

behaviour. As such, the geographical distribution of the main eddy parameters is represented in 

Figure 4.6, in which every box represents the average value of all eddies generated there. Along 

with the characterisation of the latter, the eddy parameter descriptive statistics (Table 4.2) and 

respective graphical representations are also introduced. It is important to note that the geographical 

representation of such properties only includes eddies that have a minimum lifetime of 30 days (7 

and 60-day representation in Annex E:), but the descriptive and graphical statistical 

characterisation includes all eddies, regardless of the lifetime.

For the travelled distance (Figure 4.6a), there is no obvious pattern at first sight. This can be 

explained by the fact that some boxes have a very low number of eddies with lifetime ? 30 days 

(Figure 4.4), which leads the average travel distance to be disproportional in some cases, being 

ultimately misleading. The latter is reinforced in Annex E.1, where eddies with lifetime ? 7 days 

are considered. Considering that the travel distance is directly proportional to the eddy lifetime – 

with a considerable 0.9 linear correlation (Figure 4.7) –, one may assume that the mean 

geographical and statistical distribution for the eddy travel distance and lifetime are very closely 

related. A similar statistical representation as the one generated for the eddy lifetime (Figure 4.3) 

was conducted for the travelled distance, but due to the striking similarity it is provided in Annex 

G.1. Most eddies of both areas (CV and outside) have a short travel distance, as approximately 

60% of the total population do not exceed the 50-km distance (Annex G.1). Some eddies can travel 

for long distances (&gt;1000 km), though the mean value is about 94 and 79 km for CV and outside 

eddies, respectively.  



44 

 

 
Figure 4.7 – Scatter plot and linear correlation between eddy lifetime and travel distance. Colour scale represents data density. Red 

circle represents the longest eddy trajectory (C1), identified in Figure 4.23. 

The number of eddy terminations is represented in Figure 4.6b. In this subplot, each box 

accounts only the number of eddies that terminate there. The pattern seems to be randomly 

distributed, since the boxes with higher number are dispersed around the study area. The objective 

here was to verify if the far-field eddies intersection with the archipelago could leave a noticeable 

signature, but this is not the case.  

Regarding the eddy polarity distribution, the ratio between anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies is 

represented in Figure 4.6c. The latter was log10 transformed for the purpose of normalization. As 

such, positive (red) and negative (blue) values indicate the dominance of anticyclonic and cyclonic 

eddies, respectively, while empty boxes indicate an equilibrium between the two polarities. In 

general, this figure is in perfect agreement with Table 4.1, as a vast number of white boxes is 

observed and the number of red and blue boxes seem to be counterbalanced. Nevertheless, some 

areas appear to have a predominant polarity. Anticyclonic eddies are prevalent in the coastal zone 

and on most boxes inside the CV area, particularly the ones that have a higher than average number 

of eddy origins – in the lee of Santo Antão and Fogo islands (Figure 4.4). However, cyclonic eddies 

are scattered around the study area and do not show a distinctive pattern. Several boxes have a very 

strong signal (1 or -1), indicating that only cyclonic or anticyclonic eddies were generated there. 

This result is biased by the small number of eddies originated in the respective areas and should be 

neglected.  



45 

 

The average translation speed per box is represented in Figure 4.6d. A distinctive spatial 

pattern is present, as higher speed eddies (? 7 cm.s-1) seem to originate south and west of the CV 

area. In fact, CV area appears to act as an impediment to eddy propagation, since the boxes between 

the archipelago and the coastal area, as well as the ones within the delimited area, have predominant 

low translation speeds. From the statistical graphical representation (Figure 4.8), this pattern is also 

perceivable. CV eddies travel at a mean speed of approximately 5.54 cm.s-1 (4.78 km.d-1), while 

outside eddies travel at a mean speed of approximately 6.35 cm.s-1 (5.49 km.d-1) (Table 4.2). The 

difference in maximum values is even more impressive, since outside eddies can reach a mean 

maximum translation speed of approximately 30 cm.s-1 (25.92 km.d-1), while CV eddies do not 

exceed ~14 cm.s-1 (12.1 km.d-1) (Table 4.2). The latter is further reinforced by the boxplots in 

Figure 4.8, where the number of outliers is significantly higher for outside eddies. This parameter 

is the only one that follows a gaussian curve – meaning that the population is symmetrically 

distributed, with a higher concentration of values approximately at the centre of the distribution.  

 

Figure 4.8 – Translation speed statistical distribution. From left to right: Histograms, representing the number of eddies (two left 

panels); upper-tail cumulative histograms, representing the percentage of observations (third panel); and boxplots (forth panel).   

The average radius geographical distribution is represented in Figure 4.6e, along with the 

respective statistical representation in Figure 4.9. Considering that the eddies radius is calculated 

as a function of the area (Equation 7), it is reasonable to expect that the area associated with such 

features follows the same distribution of the eddies radius (Annex G.2) – as the correlation between 



46 

 

these two parameters is quite significant (0.93, Annex G.3). Furthermore, the scale of an eddy is 

highly dependent on the altimetry spatial resolution, leading the detectable eddies to have a 

minimum radius of approximately 30 km (Table 4.2). The most evident pattern in this subplot is 

very similar to the one described in the previous subplot, in the sense that higher values are located 

in lower latitudes. An interesting signal can be found in the lee of Fogo Island, an area that was 

identified in the previous Figure 4.4 as a hotspot for medium and long-lived eddies. Here, the mean 

radius reaches an approximate 105 km length, which is quite significant since the average for the 

CV and outside eddies is about 53 and 56 km, respectively (Table 4.2). Like the eddy distance 

(Figure 4.6a) and polarity ratio (Figure 4.6c), some boxes with very high values are identified in 

the map, but are biased from the small number of eddies being accounted for the mean and should 

be neglected. From the boxplots it is possible to observe that eddies generated outside CV have a 

slightly higher radius than the CV eddies. However, the latter can be explained by the fact the mean 

eddy radii tend to increase with lower latitudes, which in turn are mostly located outside CV area. 

The upper tail cumulative histograms confirm that the two groups of eddies follow each other’s 

distribution very closely, as an exponential distribution is easily observed. From the analysis of the 

geographical and the descriptive statistical distribution, one may conclude that the Cape Verde 

Archipelago does not have a major influence on the eddy radius, being the variation in latitude the 

principal factor.

tail cumulative histograms, representing the percentage of observations (third panel); and boxplots (forth panel).   



47 

 

Lastly, the eddies amplitude is further characterized. This parameter represents the difference 

in SSH from the higher (lower) extreme to the lower (higher) SSH contour of the cyclonic 

(anticyclonic) eddy. The geographical distribution in Figure 4.6f indicates that, in general, eddies 

generated in the coastal area have a higher amplitude (from 2 to 3 cm) in comparison with the rest 

of the study area. The mean values for CV and outside eddies are around 0.86 and 1.15 cm (Table 

4.2), respectively. Nevertheless, the most remarkable signal arises once again from the medium 

and long-lived eddy hotspot – in the lee of Fogo Island – exceeding a significant 5 cm amplitude. 

From the normal and the upper-tail cumulative histograms in Figure 4.10, an exponential 

distribution is evident, as most of the population is skewed to the low values area. For the CV area, 

cyclonic eddies appear to have a slightly higher amplitude than anticyclonic eddies, as the blue line 

(cyclonic) in the upper-tail cumulative histograms detaches from the red line (anticyclonic) at 

around 4 cm amplitude. The latter is also confirmed by the mean values, which are 0.89 and 0.81 

cm for cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, respectively (Table 4.2).

4.3. Far-field Eddies 

After a first statistical analysis, a more detailed characterisation is presented. The far-field 

eddies are defined as eddies that are originated outside CV area but pass by or terminate inside the 

delimited area. The main objective here is to characterise and assess the impact of these eddies on 

the archipelago (and vice-versa), as well as its nature and behaviour. Only long-lived eddies (? 60 

days lifetime) are accounted from this point onwards, representing approximately 23 % and 34 % 

of the total cyclonic and anticyclonic far-field eddies, respectively (Annex H.1). From this 

selection, eddies that are not relevant for the current analysis – those that are created near the CV 

area and trespass the delimitation, even if they do not pose a significant impact on the archipelago 

– are successfully eliminated, without jeopardising the eddies of interest (Annex C:).   

Far-field eddies trajectories and points of origin are presented in Figure 4.11. All eddies travel 

westward, with some meridional deflections along the way. Anticyclonic eddies seem to be the 

dominant polarity, as most trajectories and points of origin are represented in red. At latitudes 

comprising the archipelago (15 – 17ºN), it seems obvious that the incoming eddies cannot advance 

further than the islands. Thus, a shadow effect is created with the archipelago acting as a barrier. 

This effect is even more noticeable at higher latitudes, where the eddy trajectories do not intersect 

the islands and are thus able to continue their path, reaching longitudes as far as 30ºW.  

 

Figure 4.11 – Far-field long-lived (? 60 days) eddy trajectories (left panel) and points of origin (right panel). Blue and red colours 

represent cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, respectively. 

 

  



49 

 

 The easternmost islands of the archipelago are undoubtedly the most impacted by incoming 

eddies – specially Sal, Boa Vista, Maio and Santiago – because most far-field eddies are generated 

between those latitudes and, as they travel west, they end up interacting with the islands. The 

windward group (Santo Antão, São Vicente, Santa Luzia and São Nicolau; Figure 2.1) receives 

eddies mostly with a south-westward direction, although there are some exceptions from the east. 

The leeward group, however, only receives eddies that originate east of CV, with some exceptions 

coming from southeast. In fact, Fogo is the only Island that is not reached by any long-lived far-

field eddy, as it seems to be sheltered by the Santiago and Maio islands.  Regarding the eddy 

origins, anticyclonic eddies are predominant near Cape Vert and Cape Blanc, with the appearance 

of some cyclonic eddies near the Mauritanian coast. Many of the far-field eddies are created north 

of the archipelago, whereas very few of them are created in the south. 

As far-field eddies need to travel longer distances to be considered as such, their kinematic 

properties (Annex H.1) are generally higher than the ones created inside and outside CV area (Table 

4.2). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the incoming eddies are, in general, more robust than 

most of the others.  

All eddies show evidences of meridional deflections. These variations are presented in Figure 

4.12, as a function of longitudinal propagation. In the left panels, long-lived eddy trajectories are 

plotted from a common point of origin by subtracting the initial position (coordinates) from the 

trajectory. The right panels show the histograms of the meridional variation between the final and 

the initial position of each eddy. The histograms are skewed poleward for the cyclones and 

equatorward for anticyclones, with a mean azimuth of 0.29º poleward and 0.28º equatorward, 

respectively. The difference in the dominant meridional sign is quite significant, as 60 % of the 

cyclonic eddies have a predominant poleward deflection, while the anticyclonic have an almost 

identical result (57 %) in the opposite direction. Some of these patterns can be identified in Figure 

4.11, as red trajectories seem to have a predominant south-westward direction – mainly those 

created at higher latitudes (&gt; 17ºN), and blue trajectories seem to propagate mostly in the north-

westward direction – especially those created at lower latitudes (&amp;lt;15ºN). Furthermore, anticyclonic 

eddies appear to travel longer distances than the cyclones. However, Annex H.1 shows that long-

lived cyclonic eddies (? 60 days) travel, on average, ~11 km more than anticyclonic eddies, though 

the latter have higher maximum distances – which in turn is associated with those eddies that are 

generated at higher latitudes, intersect CV area but fail to interact with the islands (Figure 4.11).

Figure 4.12 - Meridional deflections of the cyclonic (upper panels) and anticyclonic (lower panels) long-lived (? 60 days) far-field 

eddies. The left panels show the changes in longitude and latitude relative to the initial location of each eddy. The right panels 

show histograms of the average azimuth of each eddy trajectory. 

Time-latitude plots (Hovmöller diagrams) were computed using a meridional cross-section set 

in the eastern CV boundary (21ºW) and between the latitudes from 12 – 19ºN. Although some 

eddies approach the archipelago from north and south, most of them come from east (Figure 4.11), 

thus the positioning of the cross section. The main objective here is to identify far-field eddy 

signatures and to assess its frequency in space and time. As such, two variables are represented in 

Figure 4.13, with the SLA (computed from the ADT and the 12-year MDT) in the upper panel, and 

the EKE in the middle panel. The usage of these two different (but intrinsically connected) datasets 

is based on the fact that both variables complement each other, in the sense that eddy-induced 

signals are easily detectable in the EKE panel, but the SLA panel holds information regarding their 

polarity. The latitudinal average for both variables is represented in the lower panel, where the 

anomaly (red for positive, blue for negative) and the light-blue linear plot represent the SLA and 

EKE datasets, respectively. It should be noted that, as all eddies travel westward, the x-axis (which 

represents time) orientation was shifted from left to right to facilitate the interpretation. Moreover, 

a SLA linear trend (~3.77 mm.yr-1) was found in the meridional cross-section (Annex I.1), and 

considering that the latter could bias positive and negative signals, the dataset was detrended. 



51 

 

The final months of all the years are characterised by positive SLA, whereas the first months 

are marked by negative values (Figure 4.13). Some punctual and localised positive (anticyclonic) 

and negative (cyclonic) SLA signals are identified, though the positive seem to be more frequent 

than the negative – which is in agreement with Figure 4.11. The EKE panel is marked by identical 

signals, which validates the relationship between both datasets. Cyclonic eddies seem to occur 

mostly during late spring and summer. Nevertheless, anticyclonic eddies are also found during that 

period, as it is the case of the year 2008 – when 4 anticyclones are evident in the SLA panel. Most 

of the strongest EKE signatures (~1000 cm2.s-2) are found between 12 –16ºN and are normally seen 

from late Autumn to spring. For example: in December 2003 (14 – 16ºN) and November 2005 (12 

– 14ºN) it is possible to identify one cyclonic (C0) and another anticyclonic eddy (A0), respectively 

(circled in black). Those signals extend 2º in latitude, indicating that the diameters of such features 

were ~222 km length. Nevertheless, there are some remarkable events occurring all year round, as 

it is the case of the years between 2008 and 2012. This period was, unequivocally, the one with the 

highest number of far-field eddies entering the CV area. It was also the one in which the eddy 

signatures were more distributed in space and time.

As a seemingly seasonal signal was identified for both variables, the seasonality of the SLA and 

EKE far-field zonal signatures were computed, where each day from January to December 

represents the average of the all respective days between the 12-year study period (Figure 4.14). In 

the SLA panel a seasonal pattern is evident. Minimum SLA values (~ -4.5 cm) are reached in May, 

while maximum values (~6.2 cm) are observed between October and December. The strong 

seasonal signal hampers the identification of eddy signals. In the EKE panel, however, a seasonal 

pattern seems to exist in the months of January and August, though with low maximum values 

(~300 cm2.s-2). Nevertheless, all the other months show evidences of relatively high EKE values 

(150 – 200 cm2.s-2), which leads to the conclusion that there are no obvious seasonal eddy 

signatures in this cross-section.

the anomaly plot (left axis) and the blue line (right axis), respectively.

4.3.1. Specific cases 

Far-field eddies are subjected to many processes in their transition to offshore, especially when 

interacting with the archipelago of Cape Verde. The main objective in this analysis is to assess the 

outcomes of such interaction. As such, the period of 19th March 2006 – 2nd May 2007 was selected 

for the characterisation of 9 eddy trajectories. The latter is divided in two parts, represented in 

Figure 4.15 and Figure 4.16. Many eddies are present in the selected timesteps, but only the ones 

most representative of the processes in focus are identified and characterised. A sequential 

characterisation follows, in which each paragraph is dedicated to each timestep.  

First in 19th of March 2006 (Figure 4.15a), three anticyclonic eddies arise at distinct locations: 

A1 is created west of Cape Vert, very close to the CV delimitation; A2 is created west of Mauritania 

coast; and A3 is created southwest of Cape Blanc.  

After almost 4 months (2nd July 2006, Figure 4.15b), A1 and A3 show a significant southward 

meridional deflection in their westward translation. Consequently, A1 avoids a direct interaction 

with the leeward group of islands, while the intersection of A3 with the windward group becomes 

more likely to happen. A2 continues at approximately the same latitude, with some minor 

meridional deflections along the way.  

Fifteen days later (17th July 2006, Figure 4.15c), A1 gets farther from the archipelago and 

continues propagating south-westward, while A3 propagates steadily in a westward orientation. 

A2, on the other hand, intersects the westernmost islands of the windward group (Santo-Antão, 

São Vicente, Santa Luzia and São Nicolau, Figure 2.1). At the same time that this eddy is under 

transformation and the outer perimeter extends in longitude, another eddy of the same polarity (A4) 

originates south-west of Santo-Antão. This eddy, however, seems to be part of the same SLA body 

as the A3. Still in the same date, a dipole SLA signal appears north of Cape Vert, giving origin to 

a cyclonic (C1) and anticyclonic (A5) eddy.  

Ten days later (27th July 2006, Figure 4.15d), A1 gets even farther away from the archipelago, 

while A3 keeps its westward propagation without any significant change. A2 however, is 

considered terminated by the eddy tracking algorithm, although some of its SLA signal remains 

visible. On the opposite side of the windward islands, A4 increases in amplitude and initiates a 

westward propagation to offshore, though it outer delimitation is still attached to the remaining A2 

SLA body. At the coast, the newly generated C1 and A5 eddies seem to be entangled, as the 

anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies moved north-westward and south-eastward, respectively.    



54 

 

Another 10 days latter (6th August 2006, Figure 4.15e), A1 loses its southward component and 

propagates exclusively to west, while A3 increases in area and continues its westward translation. 

A4 gets more robust while propagating westward – increasing in area and amplitude –, and the 

outer periphery becomes more compact. At the coast, C1 and A5 appear to continue entangled, 

though the former increases significantly in amplitude, while the latter almost disappears.  

Almost 2 months later (5th October 2006, Figure 4.15f), A1 is considered terminated after a 

short sequential southward and northward deflection, but some of its SLA signal remains visible. 

A3 deflects significantly to the south, entering in a collision line with the windward islands and 

extending its outer periphery. The A4 suffers a slightly southward deflection while propagating 

westward. An interesting behaviour is seen at the coast, when C1 and A5 detach from each other. 

At this moment, C1 inverts its direction from east to west, while the A5 ceases its northward 

direction and propagates almost exclusively westward.   

Ten days later (15th October 2006, Figure 4.15g), A3 is given as terminated after its 

southernmost area intersects Santo Antão Island, though its SLA body keeps propagating south-

westward (doted contour). A4 keeps its translation without any notable change, while C1 and A5 

suffer a minor southward deflection at approximately the same instant.  

Finalising the Part I of the selected period (4th November 2006, Figure 4.15f), the new A6 

arises from the terminated A3 SLA body, west of Santo-Antão. The A4 continues propagating west 

as previously observed. The A5 propagates south-westward, getting further away from the islands, 

while the C1 moves westward in the direction of the easternmost group of islands (Sal, Boa Vista 

and Maio, Figure 2.1). 

In the continuation of the previous sequences, Part II is represented in Figure 4.16. In 19th of 

November 2006 (Figure 4.16a), A4 and A6 continue their translation westward, along with C1, 

without any significant change. A5, however, is considered terminated as most of the SLA signal 

seems to dissipate.  

Almost 1 month later (14th December 2006, Figure 4.16b), A4 and A6 are given as terminated, 

as their SLA signal seems to have dissipated completely. Concurrently, C1 increases its amplitude 

(from -1 to -4 cm), becoming more robust and closer to the eastern islands, with the outer perimeter 

intersecting Boa Vista Island.  



55 

 

Approximately one month and a half later (2nd February 2007, Figure 4.16c), C1 intersects in 

its entirety the eastern group of islands. Consequently, the eddy seems to be deflected southeast, 

while the eastern branch gets elongated and extends zonally until it reaches Fogo Island.  

Only five days later (7th February 2007, Figure 4.16d), a new eddy arises (C2) in the northern 

side of Fogo, in what it seems to be part of the previously described elongated branch of C1. At the 

same time, C1 loses some of its amplitude and remains approximately at the same location, 

continuing interacting with Boa Vista and Maio Islands. 

Twelve days later (19th February 2007, Figure 4.16e), a second eddy (C3) is created southwest 

of Fogo, in what seems to be another elongated branch of C1 and C2. C2 increases in area and 

remains at approximately at same location, while C1 gets weaker and moves slightly to the west in 

the direction of Maio Island.  

In the 4th of March 2007 (Figure 4.16f), C1 is considered terminated, as all of its SLA signal 

is lost when intersecting Maio. C2 and C3 detach from the common SLA body, significantly 

increasing their amplitude by &gt;10 and 8 cm, respectively. Both eddies appear to have a similar 

propagation direction with a strong north-westward component.    

Ten days later (14th March 2007, Figure 4.16g), C2 is terminated as most of its SLA body 

seems to merge with C3. Consequently, the latter increases in amplitude and in size.  

In the last sequence (2nd May 2007, Figure 4.16h), C3 is considered terminated after 

propagating north-westward, but most of its signal persists in the SLA field, though significantly 

more elongated than before. In fact, after a cautious analysis of the supplementary material, it was 

observed that this eddy continues propagating westward until it vanishes completely from the SLA 

field at around 40ºW, between 9th and 16th of November 2007 (6 months later).

4.4. Near-field Eddies 

Following the same kind of analysis as the one conducted for the long-lived far-field eddies 

(previous sub-chapter), the long-lived near-field eddies are further characterised. These are defined 

as eddies that are created inside the CV area. What differs from the previous analysis is merely the 

nature and the mechanisms behind the generation of such features, which are most likely to be 

driven by the islands interaction with the atmosphere and/or the ocean. Nevertheless, it is also very 

likely that some of these eddies result from the interaction of the far-field eddies with the 

archipelago. Only 71 (~6 %) and 80 (~7 %) of the total near-field cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, 

respectively, were selected for this analysis (Table 4.1). In this case, the application of a 60-day 

filter was extremely important, since the number of eddies with lower lifetime is significantly 

higher than for the far-field eddies, hampering the analysis and interpretation of spatial patterns 

(Annex D:).  

That being said, long-lived near-field eddy trajectories (bigger panel) and points of origin 

(smaller panel) are represented in Figure 4.17. The most noticeable pattern is, as for the far-field 

eddies (Figure 4.11), the dominant westward orientation with some meridional deflections. A 

considerable number of eddies are observed to originate in the lee of the archipelago’s highest 

islands (Santo Antão and Fogo) – which in turn is in accordance with Figure 4.4. The majority of 

these eddies have an anticyclonic polarity. Some eddies are originated east and north of the islands, 

but in fewer numbers. Due to their location, the latter are most likely to be caused by processes 

other than island-induced perturbations, thus they are not so relevant for the current analysis. The 

length of the trajectories is considerably high, with a mean value of approximately 480 and 454 km 

for cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies (Annex J.1), respectively, which is expected due to the 

minimum lifetime threshold applied. One of the most interesting patterns is related to the 

propagation of the eddies that originate in the lee of Fogo Island. Here, almost all the red tracks 

have a very similar behaviour, with a clear south-westward orientation and identical extensions. 

Near this area, an agglomerate of long-lived cyclonic eddy origins appears to dominate the area 

between Fogo and Santiago islands. Despite the proximity to the former group of eddies, the latter 

have a predominant westward propagation. Still, the travelled distances seem identical, except for 

one large track (C1) that almost reaches 40ºW. This specific eddy has a very interesting behaviour, 

when at approximately 30ºW starts deflecting south-westward at a constant rate. Given the 

peculiarity of such eddy, some attention was regarded towards the characterisation of the latter in 



59 

 

the next section (Figure 4.23), being also identified in the previous Figure 4.7 and in the following 

Figure 4.18 as the longest eddy track on record, and in the following Figure 4.19 as the most 

distinctive eddy signal in the EKE field. In the windward group of islands, cyclonic tracks (blue) 

are more evident because of their extension, being able to reach longitudes far west of 35ºW. In 

fact, the maximum travelled distances for cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies is approximately 1600 

and 1091 km, respectively, though the mean values are only 15 km apart (Annex J.1).  

 

Figure 4.17 - Near-field long-lived (? 60 days) eddy trajectories (main panel) and points of origin (smaller panel). Blue and red 

colours represent cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, respectively.  

The difference in maximum travelled distance is well noticeable in Figure 4.18, where the 

meridional deflection for every track is presented. It is well clear that 6 specific cyclonic tracks 

have exceptional extensions (around 1100 – 1600 km). However, if these tracks were excluded, the 

average travel distance for cyclonic eddies would be quite lower, as the remaining eddies have a 

relatively short extension. Even more remarkable, however, is the difference in the main meridional 

track orientation. While cyclonic eddies do not show a significant trend for equatorward or 

poleward propagation, it is obvious that this is not the case for anticyclonic eddies. In fact, 63 % 

and 38 % of the anticyclones have a dominant equatorward and a poleward propagation, 

respectively. Moreover, the mean azimuth for such eddies is approximately 0.48ºS. On the other 

hand, cyclonic eddies are more evenly distributed, with 49 % and 51 % of the long-lived population 

C1 



60 

 

propagating equatorward and poleward, respectively. As expected, the mean azimuth for cyclonic 

eddies is considerably lower than for anticyclonic eddies (0.14ºN).  

 
Figure 4.18 - Meridional deflections of the cyclonic (upper panels) and anticyclonic (lower panels) long-lived (? 60 days) near-field 

eddies. The left panels show the changes in longitude and latitude relative to the initial location of each eddy. The right panels show 

histograms of the average azimuth of each eddy trajectory. 

Hovmöller diagrams were computed for the near-field eddies. Considering that many eddies 

propagate through the southern CV boundary, one additional meridional cross section was 

performed (Figure 4.17). Very few eddies are exported offshore through the northern CV boundary, 

and those that are, are most likely to be generated by mechanisms other than the ones in focus. 

Thus, these eddies are neglected from the current analysis.  

The zonal Hovmöller is set in the western CV boundary (26ºW) and covers the latitudes 

between 12 – 19ºN (Figure 4.19). The x-axis is oriented from right to left to simulate the westward 

eddy propagation. Furthermore, the SLA was detrended as trend of approximately 3.60 mm.yr-1 

was found (Annex K.1). The SLA seasonal pattern is not so evident in this diagram, although the 

dominance of positive values is recurrent in the last months of several years. The SLA panel shows 

evidences of an exceptional period between 2010 and 2012, when a predominant positive SLA 

signal is clear. This period is even more evident in the anomaly plot represented in the lower panel. 

C1 



61 

 

Several cyclonic (negative) and anticyclonic (positive) signals are dispersed throughout space and 

time, though cyclonic eddies are more often observed in the first half of the year.  

In the EKE panel, a remarkable number of high value signals is observed, following the same 

behaviour as the SLA. The latter is also evident in the lower panel, where the latitudinal averaged 

EKE is represented in blue and is marked by a highly dynamic pattern. The most evident pattern, 

however, is easily identified between 14 – 16ºN. This persistent band of high EKE values (? 1000 

cm2.s-2) is present in all the years, though with variable intensity. In conjunction with the upper 

panel, it is possible to link these signals to cyclonic eddies, while the anticyclonic eddies seem to 

be associated with lower EKE values. Judging from the EKE signal extensions, the eddy diameters 

can vary between 1º and 4º degrees in length (~111 and ~444 km, respectively). The perfect 

example of an eddy footprint is observed in late 2004 – beginning 2005 between 14 – 16ºN. This 

signal belongs to the previously identified C1 and is, undoubtedly, the clearest on the EKE record 

so far. As it propagates westward at low speeds, the eddy centroid distinguishes from the eddy 

perimeter as a point of low EKE values, circled by very high values (? 1000 cm2.s-2).

latitude-averaged SLA and EKE are represented by the anomaly plot (left axis) and the blue line (right axis), respectively.

In order to assess the seasonal behaviour of the SLA and EKE datasets, the 12-year daily 

average was computed and is presented in Figure 4.20. From the analysis of the upper panel, a 

seasonal pattern seems to exist, as positive values mark the final 3 months of the year. Cyclonic 

signals are recurrent in April, June and September, whereas anticyclonic signals are more difficult 

to determine. However, only the cyclonic signal identified in June has a corresponding counterpart 

in the EKE panel (though with a negative time-lag), with values exceeding 500 cm2.s-2. Besides 

this, some other EKE signals are observed, but do not show an obvious corresponding pattern in 

the SLA panel.  

 

Figure 4.20 – Seasonal zonal Hovmöller diagrams for SLA (upper panel) and EKE (middle panel along 26ºW and the latitudes from 

12 – 19ºN (western CV boundary in Figure 4.17). In the lower panel, the latitude-averaged SLA and EKE are represented by the 

anomaly plot (left axis) and the blue line (right axis), respectively.   

Longitude-time plots were computed along the southern CV boundary (13ºN) and for the 

longitudes between 21 – 27ºW.  This specific Hovmöller diagram differs from the previous, in the 

sense that the x and y-axis are shifted. As the eddy propagation follows a south-westward 

orientation at this location (Figure 4.21), the time axis (y-axis) starts from the top, in order to 

simulate the passage of eddies through the cross-section and facilitate the interpretation. The SLA 

dataset was detrended, after a trend of approximately 5.05 mm.yr-1 was found (Annex L.1).  



63 

 

Following the same behaviour as the previous Hovmöller diagrams (Figure 4.13 and Figure 

4.19), positive SLA characterise the final months of all year within the study period. However, the 

most evident pattern seen in both SLA and EKE panels is related to the orientation of the eddy 

signals. Most of the them start around 24ºW longitude and then propagate westward as time 

progresses, resulting in a tilted orientation. Furthermore, the SLA panel presents evidences of 

mostly positive signals, indicating the dominance of anticyclonic eddies. The latter two statements 

are in perfect conformity with the dominant eddy polarity and propagation in that area (Figure 

4.21). Regarding the time frequency, there seems to exist a recurrent anticyclonic signal in the first 

months of all years, at almost exactly the same location (24ºW). Cyclonic signals are sometimes 

visible, but do not show any significant spatial or temporal pattern. In fact, the latter appear to be 

associated with the low EKE signals dispersed through the middle panel.

longitude-averaged SLA and EKE are represented by the anomaly plot (lower axis) and the blue line (upper axis), respectively.

The seasonal behaviour for SLA and EKE is represented in Figure 4.22 and was computed 

following the same procedures as the previous seasonal diagrams. This figure is, undoubtedly, the 

one which better represents a seasonal signal in both far-field and near-field eddies. The 

predominant positive and negative SLA values are again well noticeable in the last and initial half 

of the year, respectively. Moreover, the previously observed south-westward signal orientation is 

evident in both panels. Two distinct EKE signals are observed in January and March-April (~350 

and ~500 cm2.s-2, respectively), very likely to be associated with the seasonal pattern observed in 

Figure 4.21. However, only the signal from March-April finds a correspondence in the SLA panel, 

which in turn is in conformity with the anticyclonic dominant polarity (Figure 4.21).

4.4.1. Specific cases 

Based on the results previously described, a great number of eddies are reported to originate 

in the lee of the major islands of Cape Verde. In order to investigate the nature and the evolution 

of such features, the period of 24th of December 2004 – 10th of August 2005 was selected, based 

on the number of eddies suitable for the purpose. Five seemingly island-induced eddies were 

identified and are represented in Figure 4.23. All eddies are most likely to be generated by the 

island interaction with the atmosphere and/or the oceanic background. The latter also means that, 

due to the complexity of the system, the possibility of a near-field eddy to result from the interaction 

of incoming far-field eddies with the archipelago, or even with near-field eddies, cannot be fully 

disregarded. As for the previous far-field eddy specific cases, many eddies are present in the 

selected timesteps, but only the ones most representative of the processes in focus are identified 

and characterised. As such, a detailed description of the latter follows.  

On the 24th December 2004 (Figure 4.23a), an anticyclonic eddy (C1) forms in the lee of Fogo 

Island.  Almost two months later (26th February 2005, Figure 4.23b), this eddy is seen propagating 

westward, after propagating first north-westward. Concurrently, one anticyclonic eddy (A1) 

originates almost at the same location of C1.  

On 14th of March 2005 (Figure 4.23c) one anticyclonic eddy (A2) originates in the lee of Santo-

Antão, while C1 continues translating west. A1 on the other hand, propagates eastward during the 

initial phase, becoming significantly larger – with a diameter of approximately 3º (333 km) – and 

increasing its amplitude (~10 cm). 

Almost 1 month later (13th April 2006, Figure 4.23d), another cyclonic eddy arises (C2) west 

of Fogo Island, though with very small dimensions. C1 continues its translation following the same 

orientation as before. A1 changes its course and initiates a south-westward propagation, while A2 

follows the same direction as A1. 

One month later (13th May 2006, Figure 4.23e), another cyclonic eddy is created south of 

Santo Antão, with an initial southward direction. At this time, 4 eddies are simultaneously 

interacting with each other, while C1 gets farther away from the islands. A1 travelled a remarkable 

distance of approximately 240 km in the south-westward direction, while A2 keeps its previous 

orientation. C2 continues its southward direction, but with a small deflection to west. 



66 

 

On 7th of June 2006 (Figure 4.23f), the eddy trajectories remain almost identical to the previous 

timestep, with minor changes. A1 loses some of its amplitude to ~6 cm. An interesting change is 

observed in the C2 trajectory, as it acquires a westward dominant direction. C1 also seems to deflect 

slightly southward, while it translates westward.  

Almost 1 month later (2nd July 2005, Figure 4.23g), A2 is given as terminated. Part of its signal 

seems to merge A1, which also appears to be in the process of dissipating, as its amplitude 

decreases and its diameter expands significantly. The C1 keeps its previous trajectory, but its 

southward component seems to increase. Even more interesting is the pattern observed in the C2 

and C3 eddies, as their trajectories changes dramatically, with a north-westward direction.  

Finally, all eddies are given as terminated after more than 1 month (10th August 2006, Figure 

4.23h). C1, C2 and A1, however, seem to have a premature termination, as part of their SLA signal 

is still present in the figure (delimited by a black dotted line). Now that all eddies are terminated, 

the most interesting pattern is linked to the distinct characteristics between cyclonic and 

anticyclonic eddy trajectories. Only C1 follows a different behaviour.

4.5. Biological Characterisation  

The primary productivity in the vicinity of Cape Verde is further characterised, with the main 

objective of inferring temporal and spatial patterns, the archipelago susceptibility to remote 

biological enrichment through far-field features (especially eddies), and the local biological 

enrichment (IME) through near-field island-induced eddies. For that, three approaches are 

introduced. First, the seasonal characterisation of the surface Chla concentration in the previously 

introduced general study area is conducted. Subsequently, a longitude-time diagram (Hovmöller) 

is presented for the determination of the temporal variation of the Chla extension from coastal to 

offshore waters. Lastly one specific case of remote enrichment and one specific case of IME are 

presented and characterised.   

The seasonal Chla mean for the study period are represented in Figure 4.24, overlapped by the 

seasonal mean ocean surface currents. The most obvious pattern is related with the resemblance 

between the two different datasets, in which the very pronounced seasonal patterns seem to follow 

each other very closely. During spring, the coastal Chla concentrations reaches its maximum 

extension offshore, spreading over an approximate 4º (~444 km) length. At the coast, the 

concentration almost exceeds a remarkable 30 mg.m-3, progressively decreasing to ~0.3 mg.m-3 

until the longitude of Cape Verde. In the archipelago it is possible to observe a localised Chla 

enhancement in the immediate proximity of the islands – especially Fogo – of up to 2 mg.m-3. The 

ocean surface currents have a linear south-westward orientation from the coast to the archipelago, 

becoming turbulent when intersecting the islands. One cyclonic and anticyclonic dipole feature is 

observed in the lee of Fogo Island, whereas one cyclonic eddy is observed in the lee of Santo Antão.  

During summer, the Chla concentration is pushed northward, concurrently with the northward 

ocean current at the coast. In fact, the coastal Chla seems to be supressed by the latter, which when 

intersecting the westward current near Cape Blanc creates a cyclonic gyre which then serves as an 

export mechanism of Chla to offshore waters. The extension of such mechanism almost reaches 

the archipelago from northwest, with some fragmentations of the latter with concentrations around 

1 mg.m-3 getting very close from the easternmost windward islands. In the lee of Fogo Island, a 

very pronounced anticyclonic eddy is perceivable.   

In Autumn, the costal ocean current reaches its northernmost extension. Consequently, Chla 

concentration is suppressed and pushed northward until it intersects the westward NEC at Cape 

Blanc (Figure 2.4). However, the extension of the offshore transport, in relation with the previous 



69 

 

season, is considerably shorter. A new – but less pronounced – offshore extension arises near the 

Cape Vert promontory with concentrations around 2 mg.m-3, though surface currents do not follow 

the same behaviour.  

Lastly in winter, high Chla concentration extend from the coastal zone to offshore, seemingly 

reaching the archipelago with concentrations at approximately 1 mg.m-3. As expected, the latter 

seems to be driven by the ocean surface currents, which follow a dominant westward direction. 

Pronounced patches of high Chla concentration are observed in the vicinity of the archipelago, 

with values between 1 – 2 mg.m-3. In fact, it is during this season when higher concentration are 

observed around Cape Verde. However, it is difficult to classify the origin of such enhancement, 

i.e., from remote or local enrichment. 

 

Figure 4.24 – Seasonal Chla surface concentrations (coloured) and currents (streamlines).   



70 

 

The inter-annual extension of the Chla surface concentration from the African coast to offshore 

is represented in Figure 4.25. As observed in the previous Figure 4.24, a seasonal pattern is well 

perceivable along the years. Highest concentrations are seen during the first and final months of all 

the years, with concentrations reaching ~30 and ~1 mg.m-3 at the coast and in the longitudes 

comprising the archipelago, respectively. The extension of the Chla signal reaches the westernmost 

position in late spring and early summer. At the longitudes between Santo Antão and Boa Vista, 

highest Chla concentrations take place between January and March, with values in the range of 0.5 

and 1 mg.m-3. Tough, there are some exceptions, as it is the case of 2009 and 2014 – when the 

coastal-offshore Chla export reaches the archipelago during June. The apparent connection 

between the coastal and offshore Chla concentrations hampers the distinction between remote and 

local Chla enrichment, making the quantification of the IME inconclusive.

4.5.1. Specific Cases  

Having into account the existence of two types of driving mechanisms for the local primary 

productivity, the periods from October 2013 to March 2014 and from October 2009 to January 

2010 were selected, being representative of a remote (Figure 4.26) and local biological enrichment 

scenario (Figure 4.27), respectively. Nevertheless, it has been observed that both mechanisms can 

coexist simultaneously. In fact, the interaction of both distinct mechanisms is the most frequent 

scenario in the region, being virtually impossible to find isolated cases for both mechanisms. In 

order to facilitate the interpretation, both representations only include the Chla surface 

concentration, but for the identification of the driving mechanisms responsible for such features, 

the computation of the mean ocean surface currents was also considered and are included in Annex 

M:. Furthermore, monthly Chla mean concentrations proved to be the best solution for the current 

analysis, avoiding large gaps that are provoked by the very frequent cloud cover.  

First, the remote enrichment scenario (Figure 4.26) is characterised. In October 2013 it is 

observed the apparent existence of a coastal filament with high Chla concentration in Cape Blanc. 

Within its offshore expansion, a fragment (circled in red, possibly an anticyclonic eddy; Annex 

M.1) detaches from the filament transporting significant Chla concentrations (~20 mg.m-3) in the 

direction of the archipelago. In November 2013, this feature continues propagating in the same 

direction, though with less pronounced Chla concentrations (1 – 2 mg.m-3), while the coastal 

filament near Cape Blanc retracts. In December 2013, the latter south-westward propagating 

feature intersects the archipelago, as the Chla concentrations in its vicinity increases substantially 

in relation to the previous months, reaching values as high as 5 mg.m-3. In the subsequent months, 

the local Chla concentrations remain constant, with values between 1 – 10 mg.m-3. Concurrently, 

the adjacent costal area is marked with enhanced Chla levels, especially near the Cape Vert 

promontory in February and March 2014. Some coastal filaments extend offshore, almost reaching 

the archipelago. Nevertheless, it is possible that some fragments reach the islands, promoting local 

primary production. An interesting Chla signal (circled in light blue) is observed during February 

2014 at approximately 28ºW – 13ºN. The latter can be a result of two scenarios: the advection 

induced by an anticyclonic eddy, or the nutrient injection induced by a cyclonic eddy. However, 

there are no evidences of such features in Annex M.1, which can be a result of the monthly average 

applied for the ocean current – as such procedure may indiscriminately filter mesoscale features – 

or the small eddy size that may not be detectable in the altimetry sensor.

areas represent remote and local enrichment, respectively. 



73 

 

Lastly, the local enrichment scenario is presented in Figure 4.27. One far-field feature (circled 

in red, possibly an anticyclonic eddy; Annex M.2) is observed in all the months. This patch of high 

Chla concentrations approaches the archipelago from the northeast, similarly to the previously 

described remote enrichment case (Figure 4.26), fainting away as it propagates. The most 

remarkable Chla signal, however, is depicted in the lee of Fogo Island in January 2010 (circled in 

light blue), reaching values of up to 20 mg.m-3. This signal is only present in January. Moreover, 

the area in which it arises has been linked to the generation of island-induced eddies in the previous 

sub-chapters. Therefore, such occurrence may be possibly linked to a punctual and localised 

biological response to the injection of nutrients from deep layers to the euphotic zone through 

Ekman-suction.

5. Discussion 

A great deal of results was presented and characterised in the previous chapter, which may lead 

the reader to be overwhelmed with such an amount of information. Thus, the main objective here 

is to link and discuss the most meaningful results, so that the big picture can be eloquently retained.  

5.1. Eddy Hotspots and Pathways 

The identification and characterisation of the predominant eddy birthplaces and pathways is 

extremely important for several reasons. First, it promotes the knowledge and comprehension of a 

localised oceanic region (e.g., a group of islands or a specific coastal area), and subsequently its 

impact on a regional scale. Secondly, it determines with great extension the nature of the eddies 

being generated there, such as their lifetime and propagation expectancy. Thirdly, it can provide 

valuable information about the biogeochemical characteristics of the water being transported in the 

interior of the eddies, which can have a significant impact in whatever comes in their way. 

Therefore, the far and the near-field eddies are further assessed.  

5.1.1. Far-field Regions 

Coastal areas have been largely associated with mesoscale variability (Chelton et al., 2011), 

especially when characterised by an upwelling system (Barton et al., 1998; 2004; Chaigneau et al., 

2008). Naturally, the northwest African coastal area is no exception (Mittelstaedt, 1983; Chaigneau 

et al., 2009, Schütte et al., 2016a).  

From current results, it has been observed that the Cape Blanc promontory is marked by an 

important EKE signal all year round (Figure 4.1), being more pronounced during spring and 

summer (Figure 4.2). This location is characterised by intense along-slope flow convergence and 

has been often linked to the generation of a giant filaments and eddies, that promote the transport 

of cold, nutrient-rich upwelled water to offshore (Van Camp et al., 1991; Gabric et al., 1993; 

Pelegri et al., 2006; Fischer et al., 2009; Nieto et al., 2012). The latter is further reinforced in Figure 

4.26 and Figure 4.27, where a filament appears to give origin to enhanced Chla patches that 

propagate offshore in the direction of Cape Verde Archipelago. In fact, this region has been 

recently recognized as a small eddy corridor (Sangrà et al., 2009). The designation of a major eddy 

hotspot is also supported in Figure 4.4, as the adjacent area holds a considerable number of newly-

generated eddies (~200 and ~100 for 1 and 7-day thresholds, respectively) – which in turn is in 



75 

 

good agreement with Schütte et al. (2016a). The latter authors detected (in the same region) the 

generation of at least 50 eddies with a minimum 7-day lifetime and 45-km radius, between 1995 

and 2013. The difference in the number of eddy origins between the latter and current studies is 

very likely related with the eddy-detection method being used, as Schütte et al. (2016a) relied on 

the Okubo-Weiss technique (Okubo, 1970; Weiss, 1991) instead of the SLA-based method 

(Faghmous et al., 2015a). It is important to note that this hotspot only exists when accounting for 

short-lived eddies (1 and 7-days thresholds), which leads to the conclusion that it is dominated by 

short-lived eddies. The latter also means that eddies originated here are very unlikely to reach the 

Cape Verde Islands, since a short lifetime implies a short propagation range (Figure 4.7). 

Considering that the archipelago is at a 600-km distance from Cape Blanc, eddies would need to 

be active for at least ~130 days to be able to reach the islands. This hypothesis is further validated 

in Figure 4.11, where very few of the represented far-field eddies originate near Cape Blanc.  

Cape Blanc also marks the starting point of a very pronounced thermohaline frontal zone, 

known as the Cape Verde Frontal Zone (CVFZ, Figure 2.4), which separates the salty, warm, 

nutrient-poor and oxygen-rich NACW from the fresh, cold, nutrient-rich and oxygen-poor SACW 

(Zenk et al., 1991; Stramma and Siedler, 1998; Zhang et al., 2003; Pastor et al., 2008). This front 

has been recognized as a major source of mesoscale eddies in the region (Onken and Klein, 1991), 

being also linked to the generation of the previously referred Cape Blanc filaments (Meunier et al., 

2012). Coincidently, it is the starting point of the transversal band of high EKE that goes across the 

entire zonal length of the tropical Atlantic Ocean, clearly depicted in Figure 4.1. The signal’s 

orientation seems to follow very closely the positioning of the CFVZ – which also goes across the 

entire Atlantic Ocean (Emery and Meincke, 1986; Lozier et al., 1995) – and the positioning of the 

westward propagating NEC, which is conversely related with the CVFZ (Zhang et al., 2003). The 

latter is in good agreement with Reverdin et al. (2003), who state that major current systems are an 

important source of EKE – especially in regions less affected by topography – and are thus 

important sources of eddies (Pond and Pickard, 1983). This also explains the reason why the 

southernmost latitudes present extremely high EKE (to the point that a different colour scale had 

to be implemented, Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2), directly linked to the presence of the NECC (Figure 

2.4, Lázaro et el., 2005).   

In the area between Cape Vert and Cape Timiris promontories, the EKE increases significantly 

in summer (Figure 4.2), merging the Cape Blanc branch at higher latitudes. This happens 



76 

 

concurrently to the maximum intensification and extension of the MC (Figure 2.6, Mittelstaedt, 

1991, Lázaro et al., 2005). Schütte et al., 2016a strongly associated the latter current to the 

formation of eddies that propagate westward in the direction of Cape Verde. Furthermore, the latter 

authors designated this season as the period of maximum eddy generation at the coast, and linked 

the eddy generation mechanisms to the dynamic instabilities associated with MC. This is further 

confirmed in the seasonal eddies origins (? 30 days) representation (Figure 4.5). Hence, this area 

can be defined as a seasonal hotspot for medium and long-lived far-field eddies9. In fact, two of 

the selected far-field eddies approaching the archipelago (C1 and A5, Figure 4.15) originate during 

this season. According to Schütte et al., 2016a, coastal-generated eddies created in June normally 

intersect the archipelago between boreal winter and spring. The latter is in good agreement with 

Figure 4.13, as most of the eddy signatures are perceivable during that period, though some are 

perceivable earlier in late Autumn (as it is the case of the previously referred C1 and A5 eddies) – 

which in turn is related to the fact that the latitudinal cross-section is 2º (~222 km or ~40 days 

travel time – Figure 4.7) east from the easternmost islands.  

Notwithstanding, an interesting EKE trail starting in the immediate vicinity of the Cape Vert 

headland is observed in winter – when the northwest African upwelling system reaches its 

southernmost extension (Van Camp et al., 1991; Nykjær and Van Camp, 1994; Lázaro et al., 2005) 

– possibly indicating an important far-field eddy pathway in the direction of the leeward group of 

islands (Figure 4.2). Several medium and long-lived eddies have been observed to originate in this 

location (Figure 4.4) – especially during winter (Figure 4.5) – being most of them of anticyclonic 

nature (Figure 4.6c)10. In this case, it is reasonable to assume that these eddies can transport nutrient 

and Chla-enhanced water at their cores, which in turn must have a direct impact on the 

archipelago’s biological realm. Alpers et al. (2013) documented the formation and evolution of a 

sub-mesoscale (not detectable on altimetry sensors) cyclonic eddy generated by the headland 

topographic effects on the wind. This eddy transported upwelled nutrient rich water through 

approximately 200 km offshore, causing a phytoplankton bloom in oligotrophic waters, until it 

disintegrated 31 days after being generated. Schütte et al., 2016a also documented a substantial 

number of eddies being generated near Cape Vert, in which cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies 

                                                 
9 Coastal-generated far-field eddies can only be medium and long-lived eddies, since coastal-generated short-lived 

eddies do not reach the archipelago (Annex C.1 andAnnex C.2). 
10 In fact, all the 4 long-lived far-field eddies originated in this area are anticyclonic (Figure 4.11). 



77 

 

dominated the areas north and south/southwest of the headland, respectively. Having into account 

that the latter authors used a 7-day minimum lifetime threshold, their results are consistent with the 

current study, when applying an equal threshold (Annex E.1). 

5.1.2. Near-field Regions 

From the far-field to the near-field, the CV area is further discussed. Deep ocean islands have 

been reported to induce significant disturbances in the adjacent environment (e.g., Xie et al., 2001; 

Chavanne et al., 2002), ultimately resulting in the generation of mesoscale eddies (e.g., Sangrà et 

al., 2005; 2007; 2009; Jia et al., 2011; Caldeira et al., 2014) and consequent nutrient injection and 

phytoplankton blooms in presumably oligotrophic environments (e.g., Simpson and Tett, 1986; 

Arístegui et al., 1994; Basterretxea et al., 2002; Hasegawa et al., 2004; 2009). The occurrence of 

mesoscale eddies in the immediate proximity of the Cape Verde archipelago have seldom been 

documented (Lázaro et al., 2005; Chaigneau et al., 2009; Schütte et al., 2016a) and the mechanisms 

supporting such features remain to be investigated. By contrast, such mechanisms have been 

subject of intense studies in other regions, mainly in the Hawaii (Calil et al., 2008; Yoshida et al., 

2010; Jia et al., 2011), Canary Islands (Arístegui et al., 1997; Sangrà et al., 2007; Jiménez et al., 

2008) and Madeira Island (Couvelard et al., 2012; Caldeira et al., 2014). Curiously, remarkable 

similarities can be found between these archipelagos and Cape Verde, in the sense that all groups 

are characterised by high topography – which in turn is well above the local inversion layer 

(Chavanne et al., 2002; Hafner and Xie, 2003) –, and are exposed to constant incident trade winds. 

Notwithstanding, the current case of Cape Verde differentiates from the previous studies in one 

particular – but extremely relevant – way. Such studies focused on the mechanisms and 

implications induced by the islands themselves – being by atmospheric or oceanic effects (or both) 

– but very few have considered the implications of the interaction between far-field eddies and 

island-induced eddies. Considering the archipelago’s exposure to such incoming features, it is thus 

reasonable to expect that some of the near-field eddies may be a product of the inevitable 

interaction between incoming far-field eddies and the islands. In that sense, the Cape Verde 

archipelago represents an exceptional case study, which should be regarded with caution.  

Considering the size of the delimited CV area in relation to the general study area, the number 

of medium and long-lived near-field eddies is quite remarkable (Figure 4.4; Table 4.1). The lee of 

Fogo and Santo Antão Islands – the highest of the archipelago, with 2829 and 1979 meters altitude, 



78 

 

respectively (Figure 2.2; Annex A.1) – are undoubtedly the most pronounced eddy hotspots (Figure 

4.4c and Figure 4.4d). However, these regions were only distinguished from the surrounding 

environments when applying a 30 and 60 lifetime threshold. This may be evidence that many 

spurious features were identified by the eddy tracking algorithm, hence the need for filtering the 

dataset and analysing only the most robust eddies. Such pattern is also depicted in the near-field 

long-lived eddy trajectories and origins representation (Figure 4.17), where anticyclonic eddies 

appear to be dominant (Table 4.1) – which is in agreement with Chaingneau et al. (2009) 

observations in the lee of Cape Verde and is also a characteristic in other regions (e.g., Sangrà et 

al., 2009; Chelton et al., 2011). According to Cushman-Roisin et al. (1990), this dominance is 

related to the fact that anticyclonic eddies are generally more robust and merge more freely than 

cyclones, and cyclonic eddies show a higher tendency for self-destruction. These near-field eddy 

hotspots are in perfect agreement with Schütte et al. (2016a), in which the areas previously referred 

are defined as the most prominent eddy hotspots away from the African coast. Furthermore, near-

field eddies have in general higher lifetime and translation distance than far-field eddies (Figure 

4.3 and Annex G.1). On the other hand, far-field eddies are associated with higher values for the 

eddy translation speed, diameter and amplitude (Figure 4.8, Figure 4.9 and Figure 4.10). These 

patterns are very likely associated with the fact that far-field eddies can be found in lower latitudes, 

which in turn influences such kinematic parameters (further discussed in the following chapter).   

Near-field eddies that are effectively generated by atmospheric effects should follow an 

identical seasonal behaviour as the wind. The prevailing northeast trade winds which affect the 

archipelago are under the direct influence of the seasonal migration of the ITCZ (DGA, 2003, 

Lázaro et al., 2005). As such, strong and steady winds are recurrent between December and May, 

while the remaining months are characterised by low intensity winds (Figure 2.3; Varela-Lopes 

and Molion, 2014). Naturally, such seasonal variation must be reflected in the wind stress curl 

(Figure 5.1). Dipoles of positive (upwelling) and negative (downwelling) curl appear in the lee of 

all the major islands, being spring and winter the seasons with the highest extension and intensity. 

The long-lived near-field eddy origins and trajectories are also represented in Figure 5.1. Most 

eddies are clearly created during the periods of highest wind intensity – especially in the leeward 

islands, where the wind regime is more constant (DGA, 2003) – further reinforcing the possibility 

that atmospheric-effects are indeed a key factor in the generation of such features.

Figure 5.1 – Seasonal average wind stress curl in Cape Verde Archipelago, overlapped by the long-lived near-field cyclonic (blue) 

and anticyclonic (red) eddy trajectories. Circled points represent the place of origin, but only the ones generated in the lee of the 

islands have a trajectory.   

Predictably, several very pronounced seasonal EKE signals are present in the immediate 

proximity of the leeward islands during spring and winter, though a less intense EKE signal is also 

perceivable during autumn (Figure 4.2). One remarkable EKE signal is perfectly depicted 

northwest of Fogo Island, with a circular and elongated shape in spring and winter, respectively 

(Figure 4.2). The almost perfectly circular shape may be evidence of a recurrent eddy generation 

signature in spring, while the elongated shape in winter is very likely to be an evidence of the 

previously described far-field eddy pathway which originates near the Cape Vert promontory. In 

fact, part of this far-field eddy pathway seems to merge the elongated EKE signal observed north 

off the leeward islands through the João Valente Bank (between Boa Vista and Maio Islands, Figure 

2.1). Furthermore, the specific case of a far-field eddy interaction with the easternmost islands 

reinforces this theory (Figure 4.15 and Figure 4.16). Hence, the combination of an eddy hotspot 

and pathway is the most probable designation for the area, which in turn gives rise to the possibility 



80 

 

of a major pathway for far-field eddy transformation, merging and splitting. The same can also 

resonate for the second remarkable EKE signal perceivable south of the leeward islands during 

spring and winter (Figure 4.2), also characterised by a seasonal varying shape. In winter, the other 

part of the previously referred far-field eddy pathway merges this EKE signal from the south, which 

can in the same manner represent an important pathway for far-field eddies. However, island-

induced eddies through atmospheric effects are also strongly associated with this region. Thus, the 

interaction between far-field and near-field eddies and possible island-induced forcing mechanisms 

is very likely to occur. In accordance with these findings, Lázaro et el. (2005) linked the presence 

of high EKE values in the lee of Fogo Island to a nearly permanent anticyclonic eddy, which 

reached maximum speeds in spring. More recently, García-Weil et al. (2014) observed a 

remarkable EKE signal in the same location while characterising the mesoscale dynamics in the 

Canary Islands. Curiously, this signal was significantly more pronounce than in the lee of Canary 

Islands, but did not receive any attention.  

In the current study, the EKE signal downwind of the southernmost islands takes a very 

interesting shape in spring (Figure 4.2). With an initial southwest orientation, turning west in the 

final segment, this conspicuous structure follows very closely the long-lived anticyclonic eddy 

trajectories evident in Figure 4.17 (and in Annex C.4, where a threshold of 90 days is applied), 

which in turn resemble with great detail the Canary Eddy Corridor described by Sangrà et al. 

(2009). The latter authors presented strong evidences that the wind-shadow effect induced by the 

Canary Islands plays a key role in the generation of long-lived11 eddies, which initially propagate 

southward and then deflect westward. Furthermore, the authors also suggested that similar long-

lived eddy corridors could be present in other oceanic regions, referring to the Hawaiian case as an 

example (Calil et al., 2008). Hence, there are strong possibilities that this major near-field long-

lived eddy pathway identified south of Cape Verde can be an important long-lived eddy corridor. 

However, such assumption requires further investigation.  

  

                                                 
11 The authors defined a 90 days minimum lifetime threshold for the designation of long-lived eddies.  



81 

 

5.2. Eddy Propagation Characteristics 

Throughout the study it has been observed that all long-lived near and far-field eddies 

propagate westward, with small meridional deflections along the way (Figure 4.11, Figure 4.12, 

Figure 4.17 and Figure 4.18). It has also been observed that the propagation speeds and radius are 

highest at lower latitudes (Figure 4.6d), patterns which have been extensively documented in the 

past. The westward propagation speed for long-lived eddies was found to be remarkably close to 

the phase speeds of nondispersive baroclinic Rossby waves (Chaingneau et al., 2009; Chelton et 

al., 2011), which in turn increases towards the equator as a function of the planetary vorticity 

gradient effect (known as the ?-effect, Cushman-Roisin et al., 1990; Van Leeuwen, 2007). In fact, 

it was recently demonstrated that eddies often propagate westward in the crests and troughs of a 

planetary Rossby wave, mostly in lower latitudes (Polito and Sato, 2015). Furthermore, the 

influence of the local planetary rotation rate on the propagation of an eddy is directly proportional 

to the eddy’s diameter (Cushman-Roisin et al., 1990). Hence, the higher the eddy’s size, the higher 

the influence of the ?-effect.  

Present results also indicate that cyclonic eddies tend to deflect northward, while anticyclonic 

eddies deflect equatorward (Figure 4.12 and Figure 4.21). This general behaviour has been globally 

(Chelton et al., 2011), regionally (Morrow et al., 2004; Chaigneau et al., 2009; Cheng et al., 2014) 

and locally (Calil et al., 2008; Sangrà et al., 2009) observed in past studies, and is strongly 

associated with the combination of the ?-effect and self-advection by nonlinearity (Chassignet and 

Cushman-Roisin, 1991; Chelton et al., 2011), in which by the metric of ?/?, ? is the maximum 

eddy swirl surface velocity and ? is the respective translation speed (Chelton et al., 2011; Schütte 

et al., 2016a). The latter also provides information about the efficiency of an eddy to trap water in 

its interior. As such, ?/? &gt; 1 indicates that fluid is advected within its interior and the exchange 

of water with the surrounding environment is reduced (Chelton et al., 2011). Although the 

computation of nonlinearity was considered in the current study, the latter was not possible to 

calculate. An issue regarding the eddy swirl speed – which the algorithm determines by estimating 

the geostrophic surface current through the SLA dataset (Faghmous et al., 2015a) – was detected, 

as three bands of significantly high values were present in the region, while the remaining areas 

were characterised by values close to 0 (Annex N:). Such behaviour is not possible to occur in the 

real world, since an eddy with null rotational speed would rapidly disintegrate. Several attempts 

were performed in order to solve this issue, but no solution was found.  Nevertheless, Chelton et 



82 

 

al. (2011) determined that almost 90% of the long-lived eddies (lifetime ? 16 weeks, or 112 days) 

within the tropical band (20ºS – 20ºN) were nonlinear, and all eddies outside this band were highly 

nonlinear. Furthermore, Schütte et al. (2016a) determined that all eddies (lifetime ? 7 days and 

radius ? 45 km) detected in the Cape Verde region were also nonlinear. Thus, considering the 

substantial similarities between the latter and the current study, it is assumed that all detected 

medium and long-lived far and near-field eddies are nonlinear, and thus it is suggested that the 

respective cyclonic and anticyclonic preference for poleward and equatorward meridional 

deflection is associated with such characteristic.    

The propagation of mesoscale eddies can still be influenced by many other factors, especially 

in an eddying environment such as Cape Verde. The eddy-eddy interaction has been suggested to 

have a substantial influence on the propagations of such features (Calil et al., 2008; Sangrà et al., 

2009). A remarkable example is observed in the specific case of near-field eddies evolution (Figure 

4.23), where the C2 and C3 cyclonic eddies appear to propagate southward in the initial phase, 

following the same pattern as the nearby A1 and A2 anticyclonic eddies. As A1 and A2 propagate 

further away from the C2 and C3, the cyclonic eddies deflect westward and northward before 

terminating. Such behaviour in cyclonic eddies was also observed by Lumpkin (1998), where the 

advection by nearby anticyclonic eddies was attributed as the main cause.  

The background flow in which an eddy propagates can also have important implications. 

Sangrà et al. (2009) suggested that the CC was responsible for the initial southward propagation of 

the anticyclonic eddies forming the Canary Eddy Corridor, which then drifted out of the CC and 

deflected westward as they became large enough for self-advection due to the ?-effect. 

Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the westward Pacific NEC can modify the propagation 

characteristics of island-induced eddies in the lee of Hawaii (Lumpkin, 2008; Calil et al., 2008), 

being even able to increase their translation speeds in favourable conditions (Holland and Mitchum, 

2001). Considering that eddies generated or modified by the Cape Verde Archipelago propagate in 

the direction of the Atlantic NEC, which has similar characteristics as the Pacific NEC, it is 

expected that the latter can also have an effect in the propagation of such features. Nevertheless, 

this is merely speculative and further investigation should be conducted regarding this issue. 

The wind, besides having an important role on eddy generation, can also influence their 

propagation. As previously observed, the area downwind of the leeward islands is marked by an 

extensive dipole wind stress curl signal, reaching approximately 12ºN (~ 300 km distance from 



83 

 

Fogo Island) in spring and winter (Figure 5.1). Besides Chavanne et al. (2002), such far-reaching 

atmospheric effects were documented by Chelton et al. (2004) when revealing the existence of 

persistent small-scale features in the global ocean, arguing that these previously unresolved 

features could have a substantial impact on the ocean. Curiously, the trajectories within the major 

anticyclonic eddy pathway downwind of the leeward islands seem to follow very closely the wind 

stress curl bands, especially in the negative (green) wind stress curl area (Figure 5.1). This can be 

an indicator of wind-mediated eddy-confinement, first introduced by Coulevard et al. (2012). In an 

exceptional novel approach, the latter authors showed strong theoretical evidences that eddies 

generated by wind shear leeward of Madeira Island were “trapped” in the wind-wake region, as the 

cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies propagated through the positive and negative wind stress curl 

bands, respectively. This phenomenon also seems to occur in the lee of Cape Verde, especially 

when looking at the specific case of the near-field anticyclonic eddies propagation plotted against 

the wind stress curl (Annex P.1). The A1 and A2 anticyclonic eddies propagate south-westward 

following the same orientation as the negative wind stress curl (green), while the C2 and C3 

cyclonic eddies show a different behaviour, which is very likely related with the interaction with 

A1 and A2 (discussed earlier). Therefore, it is strongly suggested that the wind-wake may be an 

important contributor to the containment of the oceanic eddies in the lee of Cape Verde 

Archipelago.  

5.3. Far-Field Eddy-Island Interaction  

The eddy propagation in the ocean is directly affected by topography, as the trajectory and 

structure of such features is prone to modifications driven by the interaction with a continental 

slope, a seamount or an island (Yang et al., 2016). As previously discussed, many of the eddies 

generated at the African coast often intersect the archipelago while propagating westward to 

offshore waters. Such eddies have recently been subject of numerous studies, in which the 

hydrographic (Schütte et al., 2016a) and biogeochemical (Fischer et al., 2016; Fiedler et al., 2016; 

Hauss et al., 2016; Karstensen et al., 2015; Löscher et al., 2015; Schütte et al., 2016b; Romero et 

al., 2016) properties were extensively characterised. However, the implications of the interaction 

of such features with the Cape Verde Archipelago has, to present date, received no attention. To 

current knowledge, most studies regarding the eddy-island interaction were conducted under 

laboratory (e.g., Cenedese, 2002; Adduce and Cenedese, 2004; Cenedese et al., 2005; Tanabe and 



84 

 

Cenedese, 2008; Andres and Cenedese, 2013) and model (e.g., Simmons and Nof, 2000; 2002; 

Stern, 2000) experiments, but empirical case studies are extremely rare (Chang et al., 2012). In an 

idealized case, Stern (2000) was able to simulate the splitting of an eddy when colliding with an 

island, a phenomenon which is believed to result in the transfer of energy, momentum, salinity and 

temperature to the surrounding environment through small, dissipative scales (Simmons and Nof, 

2000, Cenedese et al., 2005). More recently, Chang et al. (2012) described the collision between 

two anticyclonic eddies with Dongsha atoll, which resulted in the weakening/termination of the 

stronger eddy and in the splitting of the weaker one. Nonetheless, Yang et al. (2016) argues that 

the phenomenon of eddy-splitting – such as the one previously reported by Chang et al. (2012) – 

lacks sufficient observational data to systematically describe such process, and suggests that further 

empirical investigation must be conducted to better comprehend such phenomenon.  

From the previously observed far-field eddy trajectories (Figure 4.11), the Cape Verde 

Archipelago appears to act as an extremely effective barrier, as no far-field eddy trajectory is 

observed to overcome the islands. From these results, one may deceptively assume that all far-field 

eddies terminate when intersecting the archipelago. However, this is far from reality. From the 

analysis of the supplementary material, it is observed that most of these eddies undergo through 

complex transformation processes which give rise to (supposedly) new eddies in the opposite side. 

Thus, the most accurate way of perceiving such results is by assuming that no long-lived far-field 

eddy is able to keep its original form and kinematic properties when intersecting the archipelago. 

From the visual analysis of the sequential SLA maps and eddy trajectories (supplementary 

material), it was possible to determine that, for a total number of 74 long-lived far-field eddies: 45 

(61 %) were terminated without interacting directly with the islands; 13 (18 %) underwent a 

transformation process which made the eddy tracking algorithm to falsely identify such features as 

newly-generated eddies; 7 (9 %) were destructed without leaving a trail; 5 (7 %) resulted in eddy 

splitting, giving rise to 11 new near-field eddies; and 4 (5 %) were deflected and kept propagating 

in a different direction. Some specific cases of such interaction were selected, where the 

transformation of two anticyclonic eddies and the splitting of one cyclonic eddy are presented 

(Figure 4.15 and Figure 4.16).  

The case of the A2 far-field eddy is quite interesting. As the anticyclonic eddy intersects the 

windward islands from the northeast, another eddy of the same polarity forms on the opposite side. 

Consequently, a streamer appears to detach from the impinging A2 eddy and flows 



85 

 

counterclockwise around the islands, joining the body of the newly generated A4 eddy. However, 

it has been observed in laboratory experiments that, as a streamer detaches from the eddy when 

intersecting an island, it flows along the island’s perimeter in the same direction as the eddy’s flow 

(Andres and Cenedese, 2013). This means that, as an anticyclonic eddy rotates in the clockwise 

direction, it is expected that the resulting streamer flows around the island in the same clockwise 

direction. Hence, the specific case of A2 is contradictory to past studies.  

Nevertheless, one most consider that this is far from an idealized case, as several other factors 

can influence such interaction. After a detailed analysis of the sequential SLA maps (supplementary 

material), a new hypothesis arises: The A4 is very likely to be a result of the atmospheric or oceanic 

shedding effects induced by the windward islands, as early signs of formation emerge before the 

A2 interaction with the islands. If this is the case, part of the impinging A2 far-field eddy merges 

the newly generate A4 eddy – a recurrent phenomenon between anticyclonic eddies (Cushman-

Roisin et al.,1990) – giving the false impression that the A4 is a direct result of the A2 eddy-island 

interaction, though it may also be an important factor. As a cautionary note, such assumption should 

be regarded as speculative and – as Dong and McWilliams (2007) suggested – further studies 

should be conducted to better understand the physical processes occurring in a real oceanic island 

wake and thus better comprehend the implications of far-field eddies in the generation of island-

induced eddies.  

 Another interesting case occurred approximately at the same location. The A3 anticyclonic 

far-field eddy approaches the windward islands and is considered terminated by the tracking 

algorithm after intersecting Santo Antão, though most of the SLA body remains present. It is very 

likely that the latter is related with the consequent modification of shape and associated kinematic 

properties. The A6 anticyclonic eddy arises a few kilometres southwest, which is undoubtedly a 

product of the A3 eddy-island interaction. In fact, the most appropriate designation of such feature 

should be A3.1. The cases of A2 (former) and A3 (latter) are very likely to be a recurrent 

phenomenon in the windward region, as a very pronounced EKE signal is observed exactly in the 

same location, especially in spring and summer (Figure 4.2), Hence, it is possible that the very 

pronounced eddy hotspot observed in the lee of Santo Antão (Figure 4.4c and 4.4d) might be a 

combination of island-induced eddies and the transformation of far-field incoming eddies.  

 However, the most remarkable eddy-island interaction case is associated with the C1 far-field 

cyclonic eddy which arises north of the Cape Vert promontory, along with the A5 anticyclonic 



86 

 

eddy. In contrast with A5 – which is deflected southward and terminates before intersecting the 

archipelago – C1 intersects the easternmost islands. Consequently, the eddy perimeter interacts 

with Boa Vista Island, drastically changing the propagation speed and trajectory of the latter – a 

behaviour which is consistent with past studies. Yang et al. (2016) demonstrated that the 

topographic effects on an eddy were felt at some distance away from an obstacle, which lead to a 

notable change in the eddy propagation. The latter was also observed by Chang et al. (2012), as an 

anticyclonic eddy weakened at a 30-120 km distance from the Dongsha atoll.  

It is worth mentioning that the Cape Verde Archipelago is constituted by 2 main chains of 

islands with relatively shallow depths between them (except between Fogo and Santiago Islands, 

Figure 2.1). Such geomorphological disposition may lead the easternmost islands to act as a single 

attached edifice, obstructing the westward propagation of incoming eddies. The latter seems to be 

the case for C1, as the eddy is deflected southward when intersecting the João Valente bank 

between Boa Vista and Maio Islands (Ramalho, 2011) – a behaviour that was also observed in an 

idealised case (Andres and Cenedese, 2013). As the eddy stays approximately stationary, a streamer 

detaches from the eddy flowing in the counterclockwise direction along the northern side of the 

leeward islands, giving rise to the cyclonic eddy C2. According to Andres and Cenedese (2013), 

this kind of streamers are governed by the conservation of circulation momentum around the 

islands, which in turn results in a jet-like current between the island passage and the generation of 

other eddies downstream (Cenedese et al., 2005).  

As C2 increases in amplitude and size, a streamer is peeled off from the eddy, originating 

another cyclonic eddy southwest of Fogo Island (C3). Nevertheless, and following the same 

hypothesis as the previously discussed A4, the generation of C3 can also be influenced by 

atmospheric island-induced disturbances, since it occurs during the period of highest wind intensity 

(DGA, 2003; Varela-Lopes and Molion, 2014) at a location where positive wind stress curl 

(strongly associated with cyclonic eddies, Chavanne et al., 2002) is often very pronounced (Figure 

5.2). While strong evidences suggest that C2 is a direct product of the C1 intersection with the 

islands, it is likely that C3 arises from interaction of C2 with Fogo Island, which in turn is 

intensified by the wind shear effect provoked by same island. If this is in fact the case, this 

phenomenon further reinforces the idea that near-field eddy generation in Cape Verde is a rather 

complex phenomenon, which deserves special attention and should be regarded with caution – as 

a variety of factors, never documented elsewhere, are at work.

5.4. Biological Implications 

The enhancement of biological primary production – especially phytoplankton – is largely 

associated with the supply of nutrients into the euphotic zone (Arístegui et al., 2007). According 

to past studies, such nutrient availability in the region is mostly regulated by 3 mechanisms. First, 

the seasonal coastal upwelling in the western African coast stimulates phytoplankton growth 

(Figure 4.24, Demarcq and Samoue, 2015), which sometimes reaches the Cape Verde Archipelago 

through ocean current or filament advection (Figure 4.25, Fernandes et al., 2005; Lathuilière et al., 

2008). In fact, it has been estimated that half of the total upwelled water between 17-23ºN flows 

across the upwelling front in filaments (Kostianoy and Zatsepin, 1996). Second, atmospheric 

deposition of iron-rich Saharan dust can intensify phytoplankton growth, though with less 

pronounced implications (Lange et al., 1998; Pradhan et al., 2006; Ohde and Siegel, 2010; Fischer 

et al., 2016). Finally, nutrient injection (advection) induced by cyclonic (anticyclonic) coastal-

generated eddies can sustain enhanced levels of Chla at its core, transporting such unique 



88 

 

environments (Alpers et al., 2013, Fischer et al., 2015; Löscher et al., 2015; Karstensen et al., 

2015) and possibly impacting the archipelago in their transition to offshore waters. All these 

distinct mechanisms have one thing in common – the place of origin. Hence, their implication to 

the archipelago can be regarded as remote (far-field) biological enrichment. Notwithstanding, a 

new driving mechanism – which to present date has only been hypothesized in the region – is 

proposed: the island-induced biological enhancement through eddy-induced Ekman suction of 

deep nutrient-rich water to surface layers, a phenomenon often linked to the IME (Caldeira et al., 

2002). However, IME has often been regarded as an isolated mechanism, exclusively induced by 

the islands on the local environment (Gove et al., 2016). The present study challenges this idea, as 

the combination of both remote and local mechanisms is the most accurate way of characterising 

the archipelago’s biological realm.  

The representation of surface Chla concentration in two specific periods of time substantially 

supports this theory (Figure 4.26 and Figure 4.27). The main objective was to characterise isolated 

cases of remote and local enrichment, though it was virtually not possible since both mechanisms 

are detected in both periods and appear to work simultaneously. Nevertheless, some isolated 

features were identified, as it is the case of a large Chla patch which detaches from the extensively 

studied “giant filament” of Cape Blanc (Figure 4.26). Despite the non-identification of an eddy by 

the tracking algorithm and the difficulty in assessing the structure’s nature with the ocean currents 

representation (Annex M.1), Löscher et al. (2015) demonstrated that this feature was in fact an 

anticyclonic eddy, characterised by high Chla concentrations at the surface and abnormally low 

dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations at near-surface layers. The eddy then intersected the 

archipelago and a significant increase in Chla concentration emerged in its vicinity. Another similar 

case is observed in Figure 4.27. The tracking algorithm identified this feature as an anticyclonic 

eddy generated near the Mauritanian coast, though its trajectory was interrupted as it propagated 

westward (Figure 5.3) – most likely due to eddy pulsation, as suggested by Sangrà et al. (2005). 

Following its trajectory, the eddy is diverted slightly to north as it interacts with the windward 

islands and continues propagating west. This anticyclonic eddy was documented by Karstensen et 

al. (2015), who also detected severe hypoxic conditions (20 µmol.kg?1) at the ~120-m depth when 

it intersected the Cape Verde Ocean Observatory mooring, north of the leeward islands. Such DO 

depleted eddies are now thought to be recurrent in the region, and are very likely related with 



89 

 

phytoplankton blooms and subsequent sinking of detritus, which induces oxygen consumption at 

deeper layers (Karstensen et al., 2015; Ficher et al., 2016; Hauss et al., 2016).  

 

Figure 5.3 – Surface Chla concentration in January, along with the respective anticyclonic (red) and cyclonic (light blue) trajectories. 

Doted area represents eddies perimeter.   

Considering the nature of the previous anticyclonic far-field eddies, it is expected that the 

enhanced Chla concentrations were most likely advected from the highly productive coastal area, 

since such features are not able to self-inject deep nutrient-rich water to the surface. On the 

contrary, the observed decrease in Chla concentration is likely related with the deepening of the 

mixed layer by the downward self-induced Ekman-pumping mechanism (e.g., Sangrà et al., 2009), 

along with the phytoplankton’s nutrient-consumption and consequent depletion, and possible 

grazing by zooplankters (Hernández-León, 1991). Nonetheless, it has been documented that 

anticyclonic eddies have the potential to retain and support planktonic communities over many 

generations, being thus able to enhance larval survival for many invertebrate and fish species 

(Condie and Condie, 2016). Such finding implies that far-field eddies approaching the Cape Verde 

Archipelago might be a great medium for biological transportation, connecting this presumably 

isolated group of islands to the western African coast.  



90 

 

A very interesting case is the small patch of high Chla values observed in February 2014 (circle 

in red, Figure 4.26). Although no eddy could be associated with this feature, it is reasonable to 

assume that such occurrence might be associated with a localised vertical advection of nutrients 

induced by a cyclonic eddy (Gaube et al., 2013), since this region is remote and considered 

oligotrophic (Alpers et al., 2013; Löscher et al., 2015, Fiedler et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the lack 

of evidences hinders the association of such phenomenon to an island-induced mechanism. This 

kind of phenomenon has been documented in a variety of studies. In an idealized case study, Lévy 

et al. (2001) showed that sub-mesoscale physics associated with cyclonic eddies are responsible 

for more than 1/3 of the new production of phytoplankton in an oligotrophic regime, due to the 

increase of nutrient transport from the deeper layers within the surface layers. Similarly, Lin et al. 

(2010) investigated an unusual phytoplankton bloom in the south of China and suggested that the 

upward advection mechanisms associated with an observed cyclonic eddy were the main cause, 

further reinforcing current findings. 

The most remarkable observation, however, is undoubtedly associated with the phytoplankton 

bloom southwest of Fogo Island in January 2010 (Figure 4.27 and Figure 5.3). Despite the localised 

and punctual nature of this phenomenon, this bloom is almost certainly associated with a far-field 

cyclonic eddy that approaches the windward islands from southeast (Figure 5.3). The iron-

enrichment through island runoff was also considered, but since the bloom takes place in the dry 

season (DGA, 2003), such driving mechanism is unlikely to occur. The eddy’s trajectory is 

interrupted as it interacts with a nearby anticyclonic eddy (supplementary material), but as soon as 

the latter moves away, the cyclonic eddy is reactivated and substantially intensified as it remains 

approximately stationary in the wake of Fogo Island, giving rise to a very pronounced Chla signal. 

The eddy intensification may by driven by the input of energy induced by the wind in the lee of the 

island. Such occurrence has been documented in the lee of Hawaii, as Calil et al. (2008) observed 

the weakening and intensification of a cyclonic eddy as a causative effect induced by the wind. 

Furthermore, it is reasonable to expect that this mechanism can significantly stimulate 

phytoplankton growth at the surface, given the substantial amount of studies that demonstrated 

such phenomenon. In an idealized case, Hasegawa et al. (2009) investigated the development of 

phytoplankton blooms in the wake of an island and found that the upwelling of nutrients – 

especially nitrate – provoked by island-induced cyclonic eddies was a key factor. 



91 

 

Such findings have also been extensively reported in the Macaronesia islands, mainly in 

Madeira and Canary Islands, but never has this phenomenon been documented in the Cape Verde 

Archipelago. Using remote sensing tools and historical data, Caldeira et al. (2002) documented 

several episodes of sub-mesoscale cyclonic eddies generated in the western flanks of Madeira 

Island, accompanied by enhanced levels of Chla at the centre. Further studies conducted in the 

same region were able to replicate similar observations (Caldeira and Sangrà, 2012, Caldeira et al., 

2014), further reinforcing the idea that this is a recurrent phenomenon. In Canary Islands, 

Hernandez-Leon, (1991) first documented the accumulation of mesozooplankton in the wake of 

Gran Canaria Island as a causative mechanism of the IME, but only until later could the enhanced 

Chla surface concentrations – found in the wake of the islands – be associated with nutrient-

enrichment driven by island-induced cyclonic eddies (Aristegui et al., 1997, Basterretxea et al., 

2002). In the Azores, however, Caldeira and Jesus (2017) suggested that the ability of the islands 

to retain the incoming properties from the impinging flow was the main cause for the observed 

nutrient and/or biological local enrichment, being thus the remote enrichment though far-field 

features the principal driving mechanism for biological productivity in the archipelago. 

Considering the substantial amount of evidences presented here, it is therefore proposed that 

the exposure of the Cape Verde Archipelago to far-field eddies and consequent remote-enrichment, 

combined with the ability to self-generate eddies and consequently enhance local biological 

productivity, are the main factors driving the local primary production. Nevertheless, more detailed 

investigation must be conducted in order to better comprehend and quantify the relation between 

the near and the far-field affecting the archipelago.   



92 

 

6. Conclusions 

The current study focused on the regional and local characterisation of the oceanic processes 

which affect and are generated by the Cape Verde Archipelago, giving especial attention to the 

highly complex far-field and near-field mesoscale eddies, respectively. Although many studies 

have investigated the mechanisms and implications associated with eddy generation in the lee of 

islands, very few have considered the implications of far-field features in such near-field processes. 

In that sense, this study distinguishes from past studies in a very important way. As such, direct 

comparisons with other observations were always regarded with extreme caution.  

In accordance with existing knowledge, current results have consistently demonstrated that the 

archipelago sits in a rather complex oceanic region, highly constrained by the atmospheric 

dynamics induced by the seasonal behaviour of the ITCZ. Such patterns regulate several large-

scale processes, as it is the case of the oceanic surface currents and the upwelling system off the 

western African coast. Naturally, similar patterns are reflected at a local scale. In fact, it was 

observed that the wind punctual and seasonal behaviour can induce significant disturbances in the 

lee of the islands, followed by localised oceanic responses in the form of eddies. Several very 

pronounced medium and long-lived eddy hotspots were detected in the lee of the major islands of 

the Cape Verde Archipelago. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the archipelago is exposed to 

a remarkable number of far-field eddies, which interact with the islands and consequent island-

induced processes. These far-field eddies are mostly generated in the western African coast in 

summer and autumn and are likely associated with the intensification of the MC. As they propagate 

westward, they intersect the archipelago between winter and spring, which also coincides with the 

periods of highest wind intensity and near-field eddy generation. This kind of interaction brings 

considerable implications not only for the near-field eddies, but also to the propagation and 

evolution of the far-field eddies. In that sense, it was observed that the far-field eddy-island 

interaction resulted in four different outcomes. The most recurrent scenario was eddy 

transformation, which made the eddy tracking algorithm to falsely identify transformed eddies as 

newly-generated near-field eddies. The second most often observed scenario was associated with 

eddy termination. Subsequently, eddy splitting was the third most observed scenario, which 

resulted in the termination of the impinging eddy and in the generation of several other near-field 

eddies. Finally, it was also observed that topographic effects induced by the islands can divert 

eddies and consequently change their propagation characteristics.  



93 

 

Considering the substantial amount of evidences that support the systematic occurrence of far-

field eddy-island interactions, one may conclude that many near-field eddies are a direct product 

or by-product of such interaction. For this reason, it is very difficult to determine the nature of the 

eddies being generated in the archipelago, i.e. from island-induced mechanisms, far-field eddy-

island interaction or even far-field – near-field eddy interaction. As such, it is demonstrated that 

the combination of near and far-field processes are the main causes in the generation of mesoscale 

eddies in the archipelago, making Cape Verde a perfect location for the study of such interaction. 

Assuming that most medium and long-lived eddies in the region are very likely to be nonlinear 

(Chelton et al., 2011; Schütte et al., 2016a), it is suggested that the interactions between incoming 

far-field eddies and the archipelago can also have important implications in the local biological 

realm. In fact, several far-field eddies (October 2009 – January 2010 and October 2013 – December 

2013) have been observed to transport Chla-rich water in the direction of Cape Verde, enhancing 

Chla concentrations in its vicinity. Nevertheless, island-induced processes can also favour local 

biological productivity, as it was the case of a remarkable Chla signal (January 2010) strongly 

associated with the self-induced nutrient injection provoked by a cyclonic eddy. Curiously, this 

eddy was generated away from the islands, but further observations suggest that the latter was 

intensified by island-induced mechanisms (probably wind-shear effects) as it approached Fogo 

Island from the southwest, giving rise to a sudden phytoplankton bloom.  This is another perfect 

example of the interaction between the far and the near-field, further reinforcing the idea that both 

fields are intertwined in such a way that hinders the distinction and quantification of individual 

mechanisms. It also challenges the idea that the IME is a phenomenon exclusively induced by an 

island (or group of islands), being thus proposed that IME can in fact be developed and sustained 

by the combination and interaction of local and remote processes. 

One last note is regarded towards the efficiency of the eddy detection and tracking algorithm 

being used (Faghmous et al., 2015a). It was possible to determine that a considerable number of 

eddy trajectories were prematurely interrupted and restarted as false newly-generated eddies 

(suplementary material). Such occurrence poses significant limitations and implications for the 

current study, in the sense that the estimated lifetime and propagation extension of some eddies 

may be inaccurate, which in turn can compromise the determination and characterisation of certain 

eddy hotspots – mainly in the western African coastal area –, as well as the number of far-field 

eddies intersecting CV. Taking into account past and recent literature regarding mesoscale 



94 

 

variability in the western African coast, it is expected that a larger number of far-field eddies – 

mainly originating near the Cape Vert and Cape Blanc headlands – would intersect the archipelago, 

but only a few cases are detected. Because of the premature termination of eddies, many of these 

trajectories do not reach the CV area, though their SLA signal is still observed to go beyond the 

eastern CV area delimitation (supplementary material), often being designated as (false) newly-

generated near-field eddies as they are reactivated inside CV.  Therefore, it is very likely that the 

number of far-field eddies interacting with the archipelago is underestimated, while the number of 

near-field eddies is conversely overestimated. Furthermore, the real implications of the near-field 

eddies at a regional scale are very likely to be underestimated. This is supported by the fact that 

very few near-field eddy trajectories are observed to reach longitudes farther than 35ºW, though in 

the sequential representations of the SLA field and eddies trajectories (supplementary material), 

many prematurely terminated near-field eddies often do. Such results demonstrate that, despite the 

considerable advances in eddy identification and tracking procedures, it is still necessary to 

improve current methods in order to better comprehend the physical mechanisms and real 

implications that such features represent to regional and local oceanography.    

Summarizing the final conclusions of the study, the two initially proposed hypotheses are 

assessed. Can far-field features have considerable implications on oceanic islands and associated 

physical/biological processes, that have been neglected to present date? The answer is yes. Current 

results show that, despite being at ~ 600 km distance from the nearest coastal area, the interaction 

of far-field eddies with Cape Verde Archipelago is a recurrent phenomenon, which often hinders 

the distinction between local and remote-induced processes. Hence, to what extend can islands 

impact such far-field features? The impacts are quite remarkable. Results show that far-field eddies 

are always transformed when interacting with the archipelago, giving origin to new eddies through 

splitting, deflecting their trajectories or even terminating their existence.  

Notwithstanding, new hypotheses emerged along the study: can the archipelago induce 

significant regional implications in the ocean, such as a long-lived eddy corridor or a zonal basin-

wide countercurrent? Although the strong likelihood, further investigation must be conducted to 

fully elucidate such possibilities. Thus, this is proposed to be the starting point for futures studies.

Annex O: Meridional Deflections of Long-lived CV and Outside Eddie 

Considering the small number of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies being accounted for far and 

near-field long-lived eddies (30 and 44 for far-field, 71 and 80 for near-field, respectively), the 

meridional deflection representation was computed for all long-lived eddies in the general study 

region (CV and Outside eddies). A total number of 330 cyclonic and 346 anticyclonic eddies were 

included, making the statistical analysis more robust. An identical behaviour as the ones observed 

for far and near-field eddies is observed, with a dominant poleward deflection (58%) and mean 

azimuth of 0.20ºN for cyclonic eddies, and a dominant equatorward deflection (61%) and mean 

azimuth of 0.33ºS for anticyclonic eddies.  

 

Annex O.1 – Meridional deflections of the cyclonic (upper panels) and anticyclonic (lower panels) long-lived (? 60 days) eddies in 

the general study area. The left panels show the changes in longitude and latitude relative to the initial location of each eddy. The 

right panels show histograms of the average azimuth of each eddy trajectory.

Annex P: Near-field Specific Case – Wind Stress Curl  

  

Annex P.1 – Near-field eddies evolution from 24th December 2004 to 10th August 2005, plotted against wind stress curl maps 

(averaged from 8 days prior to respective date). Black square represents CV area. Blue and red colours represent cyclonic and 

anticyclonic eddies, respectively. Doted and solid lines represent active and terminated eddy tracks, respectively.
