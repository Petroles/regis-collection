this research. 

Nunca estaria na investigação se faz uns quantos anos atrás não tivesse 

encontrado a Cari nas escadas do departamento a me dizer, então, queres vir 

amanhã ao campo?  

Só pude colocar aquelas primeiras gotas de água no campo porque a Cat. 

Prof. Celeste Coelho tinha iniciado projetos para o estudo da hidrologia de 

áreas ardidas no Departamento de Ambiente e Ordenamento da Universidade

todas as que lhe seguiram não teriam sido possíveis sem os ensinamentos de 

Anne-Karine Boulet e de Antonio Ferreira. Claro que, sem o meu orientador 

Jacob Keizer, seus conselhos e sua motivação, nunca eu teria regressado 

para o mundo da ciência e muito menos ter feito um mestrado e um 

doutoramento. Obrigada Jacob pela tua infinita vontade de medir, assim este a 

chover, tronar ou faça sol, sem teu interesse esta tese não existiria.  

Devo e quero agradecer também a outras muitas pessoas que me

I am also gratefully indebted to my co-supervisor Peter Robichaud 

because he helped me to understand what the data taught me and the 

importance of the “big picture”. He also gave me the opportunity during the time 

that I spend in Moscow to learn about hydrology, forest fires, modeling, 

statistics and field work with him and the hydrology and soil erosion crew: Bill 

Elliot, Bob, Joe, Natalie, Sarah, Louise, Will, many thanks for the shared times. 

During field work in Montana I had the opportunity to learn and share moments 

with Lee MacDonald who had the patience to understand and improve my 

ideas about this thesis. Mary Ann helped me with the paper work, always a 

difficult issue. Also Martha, Patrick, Louise and Ann Storrar who hosted me as 

family. John Crock was a very good climber partner but also taught me about 

trees and plants in the amazing Idaho landscape. Thanks to all!

concepts and ideas. Especially the people from the FUEGORED research net:

Artemi, Merche, Vicky, Jorge, Andrea, Cesar, Antonio, Paulo, Xavi, Oscar, 

Angeles, Teresa, Joanet and many more....from who I had learned many 

things; not only about science but about life. Desde otros lugares de la 

Península me mostraron no solo que lo que hacemos interesa a todos sino que 

todos tenemos dificultades muy parecidas para superar. Obrigada e Força!

incêndio, escorrência, erosão, simulação de chuva, repelência à água do 

solo, lavrar, corte e extração, eucalipto, pinheiro, “hydromulch” 

 

 

Em todo o mundo tem sido verificado uma elevada reposta hidrológica e 

erosiva, e por vezes até extrema, em terrenos afetados por incêndios 

florestais. Contudo, no caso do norte-centro de Portugal, pouca investigação 

tem sido realizada sobre o impacte de vários tipos de gestão (como o tipo de 

lavragem, corte e retirada da madeira queimada ou tratamentos pós-fogo de 

mitigação da erosão) na resposta hidrológica e erosiva de áreas recentemente 

ardidas. Este estudo tem como objetivo a medição da escorrência e erosão do 

solo em plantações de eucalipto e pinheiro durante o primeiro, segundo e 

terceiro ano a seguir a um incêndio. O efeito de diferentes técnicas de 

preparação do solo (lavragem na direção do declive, lavragem seguindo as 

curvas de nível e terraços inclinados), do corte e retirada da madeira 

queimada, assim como da aplicação de “hydromulch” (tratamento pós-fogo) 

sobre a escorrência e erosão do solo, foi comparado com outras áreas ardidas 

mas não alteradas pela lavragem ou tratamentos pós-fogo. Uma 

monitorização intensiva da escorrência, erosão e das variáveis selecionadas 

foi realizada com o intuito de determinar os factores-chave nos processos de 

geração de escorrência e erosão pós-fogo, assim como de sua variação 

temporal e espacial. Uma especial atenção foi dada à repelência à água do 

solo dado seu suposto papel para a geração de escorrência. Experiências de 

chuva simulada (RSE’s) repetidas no tempo, parcelas de escorrência a micro-

escala e barreiras de sedimentos (“sediment fence”) foram executadas e/ou 

instaladas imediatamente depois do incêndio em sete encostas. Os dados de 

escorrência e erosão com chuva natural foram comparados com os dados de 

RSE’s, o que se revelou útil na avaliação da adequabilidade dos dados de 

precipitação simulada relativamente à natural. 

Comparando com estudos anteriores, os resultados apresentam 

coeficientes de escorrência (20-60%) comparáveis, mas perdas de 

sedimentos (125-1000 g m-2) inferiores, a outros no âmbito nacional e 

especialmente fora de Portugal. As discretas taxas de sedimentos são 

coerentes com um historial de intenso do uso do solo na região. Na avaliação 

dessas perdas de sedimentos deve ser considerada a pouca profundidade e 

pedregosidade destes mesmos, assim como a alta taxa de matéria orgânica 

(50%) nos sedimentos erodidos. Quanto às medições de erosão nos locais 

lavrados, estas foram limitadas pela disponibilidade de sedimentos, devido ao 

longo periodo ocorrido (vários anos) desde que as encostas foram lavradas.

A alteração da cobertura de manta morta devido às actividades de corte e 

extração da madeira pós-fogo incrementou substancialmente as perdas de 

sedimentos no eucaliptal e no pinhal. A efectividade do “hydromulch” na 

redução de escorrência (70%) e erosão (83%) foi atribuída ao efeito protetor 

proporcionado pelo tratamento. Este tratamento, também afetou 

significativamente a cobertura vegetal e outras propriedades do solo, que por 

sua vez também reduziram o risco de erosão. 

A quantidade de precipitação foi o primeiro factor em explicar a variância da 

escorrência, no entanto, uma mudança de quantidade, para intensidade da 

precipitação como factor principal foi detectada quando a cobertura do solo

aumenta, ou quando existe alguma capacidade de infiltração (condições de 

hidrofílicas). A perda de sedimentos foi controlada pela intensidade da 

precipitação e a cobertura do solo. O efeito da repelência à água do solo,

sobre a geração de escorrência, não é directo já que os valores totais de 

repelência não são suficientes para avaliar seu impacte hidrológico. Contudo, 

a repelência à água explicou a variabilidade na geração de escorrência nos 

modelos específicos por áreas, com maior eficácia que os modelos gerais. 

Adicionalmente, a humidade do solo está melhor relacionada com os níveis de 

repelência à água do solo do que a precipitação antecedente. Os resultados 

da chuva natural confirmaram que as RSE’s representaram bem as taxas 

específicas de perda de sedimentos, o seu conteúdo em matéria orgânica,

assim como as diferenças entre locais lavrados e não lavrados. As RSE’s 

também registraram a componente sasonal na produção de escorrência e 

sedimentos, atribuída ao efeito da repelência à água do solo.  

Estes resultados têm implicações para a modelação da erosão e práticas 

de conservação do solo em áreas ardidas da região, ou zonas com o mesmo 

tipo de uso de solo, clima e características do solo. As perdas de solo 

medidas em conjunto com a crescente frequência em que as áreas ardidas e 

não ardidas estão a ser lavradas, sugerem que a lavragem não é efectiva para 

a conservação do solo florestal. É recomendado o corte da madeira queimada 

com menos impacto, permitindo a conservação da manta morta para a 

proteção do solo. Dada a elevada eficiência do “hydromulch” em reduzir 

escorrência e erosão, esta técnica é indicada para áreas especialmente 

vulneráveis e sensíveis.

Abstract 
 

 

 

 

 

 

wildfire, runoff, erosion, rainfall simulation, soil water repellency, plough,

logging, eucalypt, pine, hydromulch  

 

Strong and sometimes extreme responses in runoff and soil erosion 

following wildfires have been reported worldwide. However, in the case of 

North-Central Portugal, little research had been carried out regarding the 

hydrologic and erosive impacts of several land management activities in 

recently burnt areas (such as ground preparation, post-fire logging or post-fire 

mitigation treatments). This study aims to assess post-fire runoff and soil 

erosion response on Eucalypt and Maritime pine plantations during the first, 

second and third years following wildfires. The effect of several pre-fire ground 

preparation operations (ploughed down-slope, contour ploughed and inclined 

terraces), post-fire logging activities (on both the eucalypt and pine plantations), 

as well as the application of hydromulch (a post-fire emergency treatment) on 

overland flow and soil erosion were compared to burnt but undisturbed and 

untreated areas. The intensive monitoring of runoff, soil erosion and selected 

soil properties served to determine the main factors involved in post-fire runoff 

and soil erosion and their spatial and temporal variation. Soil water repellency 

deserved special attention, due to its supposed important role for overland flow 

generation. Repeated rainfall simulation experiments (RSE’s), micro-scale 

runoff plots and bounded sediment fences were carried out and/or installed 

immediately after the wildfire on seven burnt slopes. Micro-scale runoff plots 

results under natural rainfall conditions were also compared to the RSE’s 

results, which was useful for assessing the representativeness of the data

obtained with artificial rainfall.  

The results showed comparable runoff coefficient (20-60%) but lower 

sediment losses (125-1000 g m-2) than prior studies in Portugal, but especially 

outside Portugal. Lower sediment losses were related with the historic intensive 

land use in the area. In evaluating these losses, however, the shallowness and 

stoniness of the soils, as well as the high organic matter fraction of the eroded 

sediments (50%) must not be overlooked. Sediment limited erosion was 

measured in all the ploughed sites, probably due to the time since ploughing 

(several years). The disturbance of the soil surface cover due to post-fire 

logging and wood extraction substantially increased sediment losses at both 

the pine and eucalypt sites. Hydromulch effectiveness in reducing the runoff 

(70%) and sediment losses (83%) was attributed to the protective high 

coverage provided by hydromulch. The hydromulch significantly affected the 

soil cover and other soil properties and these changes also reduced the soil 

erosion risk.

The rainfall amount was the main factor explaining the variance in runoff. 

However, a shift from rainfall amount to rainfall intensity was detected when 

either the surface cover or the infiltration capacity (hydrophilic conditions) 

increased. Sediment losses were controlled by rainfall intensity and surface 

cover. The role of soil water repellency on runoff generation was not 

consistent; the overall repellency levels alone were not enough to assess its 

hydrological impact. Soil water repellency explained runoff generation in the 

specific-sites model better than in the overall model. Additionally, soil moisture 

content was a better predictor for soil water repellency than antecedent 

rainfall. The natural rainfall results confirmed that RSE’s were able to capture 

the specific sediment losses and its organic matter content as well as the 

differences between the ploughed and unploughed sites. Repeated RSE’s also 

captured the seasonal variations in runoff and sediment losses attributed to 

soil water repellency. 

These results have implications for post-fire soil erosion modelling and 

soil conservation practices in the region, or areas with the same land use, 

climate and soil characteristics. The measured sediment loss, as well as the 

increasing frequency of ploughing in recently burnt and unburnt eucalypt 

stands, suggests ploughing is not an effective as a soil conservation measure. 

Logging activities with less impact are recommended in order to maintain the 

forest litter protecting the soil surface. Due to its high effectiveness in reducing 

runoff and soil erosion, hydromulch is recommended for highly sensitive and 

vulnerable areas.

Resumen 

 

 

 

 

 

incendio, escorrentía, erosión, simulación de lluvia, repelencia al agua del 

suelo, labrar, corte y extracción, eucalipto, pino, “hydromulch” 

 

En muchas partes del mundo y en terrenos afectados por incendios 

forestales se han registrado respuestas hidrológicas y erosivas  altas o 

extremas. No obstante, en el caso del centro-norte de Portugal, existe poca 

investigación sobre el impacto de varios tipos de gestión (como el tipo de 

labrado, tala y extracción de la madera quemada o tratamientos post-incendio 

para la mitigación de la erosión) en la respuesta hidrológica y erosiva de áreas 

recientemente ardidas. El objetivo de este estudio es la medición de la 

escorrentía y erosión del suelo en plantaciones de eucalipto y pino, durante el 

primer, segundo y tercer año tras el incendio. El efecto de diferentes técnicas 

de preparación del suelo (labrado a favor de la pendiente, siguiendo las curvas 

de nivel o terrazas inclinadas), de la tala y retirada de la madera quemada así 

como de la aplicación de “hydromulch” (tratamiento post-incendio) sobre la 

escorrentía y la erosión fue comparado con áreas ardidas pero no alteradas 

por el labrado o tratamientos post-incendio. Fue realizada una monitorización 

intensiva (aproximadamente semanalmente) de la escorrentía, erosión y 

algunas variables seleccionadas, con el objetivo de determinar los factores 

clave en los procesos de generación de la escorrentía y la erosión post-

incendio, así como su variación temporal y espacial. La repelencia al agua del 

suelo recibió una atención especial debido a su supuesto papel en la 

generación de escorrentía. Experiencias de lluvia simulada (RSE’s) repetidas 

en el tiempo, parcelas de campo a micro-escala y trampas de sedimentos 

(“sediment fence”) fueron ejecutadas y/o instaladas inmediatamente después 

del incendio en siete laderas. Los datos de escorrentía y erosión de lluvia 

natural fueron comparados con los datos de RSE’s, lo que resultó 

especialmente útil para evaluar la representatividad de los datos de lluvia 

artificial frente a la lluvia natural. 

Los resultados muestran valores de escorrentía (20-60%) comparables 

pero menores perdidas de sedimentos (125-1000 g m-2) que estudios 

anteriores en Portugal, pero especialmente fuera de Portugal. Las tasas bajas 

de sedimentos están en concordancia con un uso del suelo intensivo en la 

zona. Igualmente, para evaluar las bajas pérdidas de sedimentos deben ser 

considerados factores como la poca profundidad y pedregosidad de los suelos 

así como la alta tasa de materia orgánica (50%) en los sedimentos 

erosionados. En todas las áreas labradas, debido al tiempo transcurrido desde 

el labrado (varios años), la erosión fue limitada por la disponibilidad de 

sedimentos.

La alteración del cubierto de manta muerta debido a la tala y extracción de la 

madera quemada incrementó sustancialmente las pérdidas de sedimentos en 

el eucaliptal y el pinar. La efectividad del “hydromulch” para reducir la 

escorrentía (70%) y la erosión (83%) puede ser atribuida a la cubierta 

protectora proporcionada por el tratamiento. Adicionalmente, el tratamiento 

afectó significativamente la cobertura y otras propiedades del suelo, lo que 

también contribuyó a reducir el riesgo de erosión. La cantidad de lluvia fue el 

primer factor en explicar la variación de la escorrentía. Aunque, un cambio de 

cantidad a intensidad de lluvia como factor principal es detectado cuando 

aumenta la cubierta del suelo o bien alguna capacidad de infiltración está 

presente (condiciones de hidrofilia). La pérdida de sedimentos fue controlada 

por la intensidad de lluvia y la cobertura del suelo. El efecto de la repelencia al 

agua del suelo sobre la generación de escorrentía no es directo, ya que los 

valores totales de repelencia no son suficientes para evaluar su impacto 

hidrológico. La repelencia al agua explica la generación de escorrentía mejor 

en los modelos específicos por áreas que en los modelos generales. 

Adicionalmente, la humedad del suelo resulta ser un mejor indicador para la 

repelencia al agua del suelo que la precipitación previa. Los resultados de 

lluvia natural confirman que las RSE’s capturaron bien las tasas específicas 

de pérdida de sedimentos, su contenido en materia orgánica así como las 

diferencias entre laderas labradas y no labradas. Las RSE’s repetidas también 

capturaron la componente estacional de la escorrentía y sedimentos atribuida 

al efecto de la repelencia al agua del suelo. 

Estos resultados tienen implicaciones para la modelación de la erosión y 

prácticas de conservación del suelo en áreas ardidas de la región, o zonas 

con el mismo tipo de uso del suelo, clima y características del suelo. Las 

pérdidas de suelo medidas conjuntamente con la creciente frecuencia en que 

las áreas ardidas o no ardidas están siendo labradas, sugieren que el labrado 

no es efectivo para la conservación del suelo forestal. Son aconsejables talas 

y cortes cuidadosos de la madera quemada con menor impacto y que 

permitan la conservación de la manta muerta para la protección del suelo. 

Dada la alta efectividad del “hydromulch” para reducir la escorrentía y la 

erosión, se recomienda esta técnica para áreas especialmente vulnerables y 

sensibles.

1. Introduction 

1.1 The occurrence of wildfires in Portugal  

 

Portugal and the Mediterranean countries of Europe in general have a long land-use 

history, during which high density human populations have systematically managed 

and used the agricultural and forest lands (Moreira et al., 2001). In the past century, 

however, land use in the Mediterranean Basin has suffered major transformations. A 

generalized rural exodus caused land abandonment and, at the same time, 

afforestation of former agricultural land (Moreno, 1999). In north-central Portugal, there 

was first a shift from grazing lands to Maritime Pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) plantations in 

the 1930s. In the 1970s, eucalypt – an exotic tree species (Eucalypt globulus Labill.) - 

was introduced and, due to its faster growth and higher economic profitability, then 

gradually replaced the Maritime Pine stands (Coelho 1995a). Eucalypt has become the 

principal tree species in Portugal, covering 812.000 ha or 26 % of the forested area 

(AFN, 2011).  

The above mentioned changes in land use have raised widespread concerns about 

the sustainability of the current situation in Portugal, also because profound changes in 

the landscape are often associated with increasing rates of habitat loss and 

fragmentation (Teixido et al., 2010). The traditional agro-silvicultural system was 

characterized by the extensive exploitation of the forest resources for timber, fuel, 

grazing, livestock bedding, and cropping (Rego, 1992). Also, prescribed fires were 

used to clear forest lands for grazing and/or cropping. The resulting landscape was a 

highly heterogeneous and had a patchy organization of multiple habitats with elevated 

biodiversity but also low wildfire risk. This low fire risk was still evidenced during the 

decade from 1950 to 1960, when, on average, some 5.000 ha year-1 were burnt by 

wildfire in Portugal (Ferreira et al., 2009). By comparison, during the past three 

decades (1980-2010), over 3.000.000 ha were burnt in Portugal, which corresponds to 

roughly 110.000 ha year-1, (AFN, 2011) (Figure 1). This increase in wildfire incidence 

and burnt area is generally attributed to a combination of land abandonment and 

subsequent shrub encroachment, on the one hand, and, on the other, widespread 

afforestation with flammable tree species, both leading to an increase in fuel 

accumulation (Moreira et al. 2001; Lloret et al. 2002; Moreira et al. 2009; Carmo et al. 

2011; Shakesby, 2011).

Wildfires have become the most important factor for land cover change in Portugal 

(Pereira and Santos 2003). They also constitute a major threat to the economic viability 

of commercial forestry and to the ecological health of the ecosystems affected by high 

fire incidence (Nunes et al., 2005). A recent study estimated that the wildfire return 

interval for the various ecological regions in Portugal now varies between 23 and 52 

years, with the interval being shortest for the region where this research occurred 

(Fernandes et al., 2012).

1.2 The effects of wildfires on runoff and soil erosion 

 

Wildfires can be a major contributor of soil erosion and land degradation, provoking 

a disturbance whose impacts decrease with time during the so-called “window-of-

disturbance” (Cerdà and Doerr, 2005; Shakesby, 2011). Fires have been found to 

induce changes in soil’s physical, chemical and biological properties, in vegetation and 

fauna, and in geomorphological and hydrological processes, including water quality 

(Debano et al., 1998; Doerr et al., 2000; Shakesby and Doerr 2006; Vila-Escalé et al., 

2007; Doerr et al., 2009a; Llorret and Zedler 2009, Moody and Martin 2009; Mataix-

Solera et al., 2011; Campos et al. 2012). The changes in soil properties and the 

(partial) consumption of the protective vegetation and litter cover are frequently

considered to be the major factors enhancing post-fire runoff and associated sediment 

losses (Shakesby, 2011).  

Strong and sometimes extreme responses in runoff and erosion following wildfires 

have been reported worldwide (e.g. Blong et al., 1982; Díaz-Fierros et al. 1987; Soto et 

al., 1994; Inbar et al., 1997; Prosser and Williams, 1998; Soto and Díaz-Fierros, 1998; 

Úbeda and Sala, 1998; Robichaud et al, 2000; Cerdà and Doerr, 2005; Spigel and 

Robichaud, 2007; Fernández et al., 2011; as was extensively reviewed by Shakesby 

and Doerr, 2006 and specifically for the Mediterranean countries by Shakesby, 2011). 

Many factors affect the generation of overland flow and the following sediment 

transport in the rapidly changing post-fire environments. Rainfall and its characteristics 

are the main factors controlling soil erosion (Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald, 2005; 

Vega et al., 2005, Spigel and Robichaud, 2007; Scott et al., 2009). Time-elapsed since 

the fire within the window of disturbance is also an important factor, with the first rainfall 

events being the most erosive ones as the soils are still largely bare and most 

vulnerable (Wagenbrenner et al., 2006, Spigel and Robichaud, 2007, Gonzalez-Pelayo 

et al., 2006). Vegetation and litter cover also play an important role in soil erosion 

response through the direct protection of rainfall drops impacts, their water retention 

capacity and the protection of soil to overland flow (Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). The 

burning of the vegetation leads also to a reduction in transpiration and evaporation. 

Ash cover can initially enhance infiltration capacity and reduce overland flow (Cerdà 

and Doerr, 2008; Leighton–Boyce et al., 2007; Woods and Balfour 2008; Cerdà and 

Robichaud, 2009), but, in addition, ash can block the soil pores and increase the 

likelihood of overland flow (Scott et al., 2009). Bare soil exposure leaves the soil 

unprotected and more susceptible to rain drop impact and overland flow removal (Terry 

and Shakesby, 1993; Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald, 2005). In stony soils, rock 

fragment cover tends to delay runoff, increase infiltration rates and diminish the soil 

erosion rates (Cerdà, 2001; Zavala et al., 2010).  

Soil water repellency is widely considered one of the main factors in enhancing 

runoff generation following wildfire (e.g. Shakesby and Doerr, 2006; Leighton-Boyce et 

al., 2007; Sheridan et al., 2007; Cerdà and Robichaud, 2009). The effects of burning 

and its influence on soil water repellency can be highly variable (Doerr et al., 1996; 

Doerr et al., 2004). Infiltration excess overland flow (Horton overland flow) is generated 

as a result of post-fire soil water repellency, but the presence of a wettable surface 

layer above a strongly repellent layer can induce a shallow layer of saturation overland 

flow (Doerr et al. 2009a). In north-central Portugal, soil water repellency is widely held

to play a key role in the temporal patterns of the hydrological post-fire response, 

especially in eucalypt plantations (Prats et al., 2012; Malvar et al., 2011, 2013 (see 

chapter 2 and 3), Ferreira et al., 2000; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007; Coelho et al., 

2004). Both long unburnt and recently burnt eucalypt stands in the region are typically 

associated with very high to extreme repellency levels under dry soil moisture 

conditions (e.g. Doerr et al. 1998, 2003, 2006; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2005; Keizer et 

al., 2005a, 2005b, 2008). A recent review of fire effects on soils has identified the need 

for more research on the relative effects of soil water repellency, ground cover, soil 

sealing and soil disaggregation as well as the effects of rehabilitation treatments on 

post-fire infiltration and runoff (Cerdà and Robichaud, 2009). Additional studies are 

needed to determine the relationship between soil water repellency and infiltration rate 

measured either at point, plot or larger scale (Doerr et al., 2009a).   

Besides wildfire itself, post-fire forestry practices can contribute markedly to an 

enhanced hydrological and erosion response in recently burnt areas (Fernández et al., 

2007; Shakesby, 2011). In the region under study, rip-ploughing in down slope 

direction to prepare eucalypt planting was found to increase sediment losses to rates 

well beyond those immediately after fire (Walsh et al., 1995; Shakesby et al., 1996). 

Soil preparation operations, such as contour ploughing and terracing (Figure 2), are 

also regularly used in north-central Portugal, but their erosion implications have been 

poorly studied so far. The role of past operations in post-fire erosion (e.g. when the 

ploughing occurred several years before the wildfire) has equally received little 

research attention, even though the region’s forest lands are an intricate mosaic of 

terraced, ploughed and unploughed terrains (Figure 3).  

In north-central Portugal, several post-fire soil erosion studies, across spatial scales 

ranging from plot to small catchment, were carried out during the 1990’s and the early 

2000’s (e.g. Walsh et al., 1995; Shakesby et al., 1993,1994,1996; Ferreira et al., 1997; 

Coelho et al., 2004; Ferreira et al., 2005b, 2008). Nevertheless, most of these studies 

did not address the erosion in first 1-2 years after the fire and they were related mainly 

with pine (Ferreira et al., 2005b) rather than eucalypt stands. Likewise, other fire 

related erosion research needs, the evaluation of land management (Fernandez et al., 

2010; Shakesby, 2011) and soil conservation measures (Robichaud, 2005) had 

received less attention, with only a few studies (Walsh et al., 1995; Shakesby et al., 

1994; 1996; Prats et al., 2012).

1.3 Predicting soil erosion risk and its mitigation in recently burnt areas 

 

Given the typically elevated risk of soil erosion in recently burnt areas, operational 

tools are needed to help forestry managers assess the erosion potential and possible 

post-fire interventions, including “no management” (Fernandez et al., 2010). Many 

models exist for predicting runoff and erosion but only a few have been adapted to 

post-fire environment (Robichaud et al., 2009). Still, progress in understanding wildfire-

induced soil erosion might be best achieved by shifting to a paradigm of large-scale 

bioregional variants rather than continuing to try to apply a ‘one-size-fits-all’ post-fire 

soil erosion model to all regions (Shakesby et al., 2007).  A model-based risk 

assessment tool for the specific conditions of the Portuguese main forests (also 

including other regions in the N-W Iberian Peninsula) should take into consideration 

regional factors such as: (i) socio-economic factors affecting fire ignition and 

recurrence as well as land management and property; (ii) pronounced spatial variability 

as a consequence of multiple pre- and post-fire management options (unploughed, rip-

ploughing, terracing, logging, new planting, regrowth or no action) in small size land 

properties mosaic with a dense network of forests tracks and roads; (iii) pronounced 

temporal-seasonal variability in runoff and sediment losses. 

In Portugal, only after the severe fire seasons of 2003 and 2005 have forest fires 

become an important public concern (Ferreira et al., 2008) which motivated an 

institutional effort towards a post-fire soil erosion risk assessment and subsequent 

mitigation strategies (Figure 1). The National Water Institute (INAG) did, in fact, predict 

soil erosion risk in recently burnt areas, producing a nation-wide map based on the 

“Universal Soil Loss Equation” (USLE) (Wischmeier and Smith 1978, INAG, 2003; 

Brandão and Rodrigues, 2006). INAG’s application of USLE, however, had several 

drawbacks. First, the empirical-based USLE model was designed as a management 

tool for agricultural lands. Second, and perhaps most important, was the almost total 

lack of field data supporting the model’s suitability (calibration and validation) for post-

fire conditions (e.g. Laflen and Moldenhauser, 2003; Morgan, 2005). Such a lack is 

highlighted by the map legend showing soil erosion classes of 0-1, 1-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-16 

and &gt;16 t ha-1 year-1. Those values were well above most of data found in the literature 

for Mediterranean countries (many plot-scale studies recording first year post-wildfire 

losses of 1 t ha-1 and the majority were&amp;lt;10 t ha-1; e.g. Shakesby, 2011). Third, the map 

concerning the immediate post-fire situation had limited temporal variability, even 

though the natural conditions change rapidly after fire, including the intensive land

management. Subsequently, several government manuals to guide rehabilitation and 

restoration strategies were published (DGRF, 2005; SNIRH, 2005), but those manuals 

were focused on post-fire soil mitigation treatments, the selection of target areas was 

not mentioned, or the selection was based on USLE. Some research efforts have been 

made to verify USLE for post-fire conditions or to apply other models, such as the 

Morgan-Morgan-Finney model (MMF, Morgan, 2001) (Vieira et al., 2010). More 

recently, with the main aim of scientific knowledge transfer, a publication on fire 

ecology and burnt areas restoration (Moreira et al., 2010) provided an overview of the 

global and specific Portuguese research needs and forest conditions. In this book, the 

intervention areas selection criteria is a combined tool of high degradation risk, low 

regeneration capacity indicators and values at risk. The soil erosion hazard is 

calculated based on USLE.  

In Portugal, post-fire emergency treatments have rarely been employed, although 

this situation is changing due to the implementation of EU Rural Development 

Programme (2007-2013), such as PRODER-funded stabilization measures (under sub-

Action 2.3.2.1 “Restoring Forestry Potential”) for selected 2010 and 2012 burnt areas. 

Institutional technical reports were elaborated to propose and evaluate emergency 

treatments for specific wildfires (29 technical reports between 2010 and 2012; ICFN, 

2012). The selection of target areas was not mentioned, or was vaguely expressed as 

based on slope angle (slope angle &gt; 20º) or on field-based surveys. In the case of the 

Tavira 2012 wildfire (Algarve-South Portugal), the selection of the soil erosion risk 

areas was determined by using the Modified USLE model (MUSLE; Renard et al., 

1991). In that case, the Regional Forestry authority produced a map which predicted 

soil losses ranging from less than 5 t h-1 year -1 to more than 200 t h-1 year -1 (ICNF, 

2012). The predicted values were again an over estimation of most of the available 

post-fire erosion data in Portugal or other Mediterranean countries. In spite of the 

institutional effort, the lack of data and information, as well as the lack of 

communication between scientists and land managers, revealed limitations in the 

advancement towards appropriate post-fire management strategies. In addition, the 

majority of private forest owners are unfamiliar with post-fire intervention techniques. 

Their intervention relies on logging and (re)plantation with eucalypts, frequently after 

ploughing or terracing. Nonetheless, many land owners would be keen to learn more 

about these techniques and even would consider implementing them, if the financial 

burden is minimal (Coelho et al., 2011). At this early stage of post-fire mitigation 

treatments application, the problem is obtaining agreement among professionals and

researchers involved in forest fire management, as to how to identify areas for 

intervention (Ferreira et al., 2009). In such a context, the development of a predictive 

post-disturbance erosion model tool, tailored to the specificities of post-fire conditions 

in Portugal’s forests seems appropriate.  

 

1.4 Measuring post-fire runoff and erosion risk  

 

A major difficulty in developing a post-fire soil erosion risk assessment tool is the 

collection of representative data on runoff and erosion. Direct measurement of hillslope 

runoff and erosion may be expensive, complex, and labour-intensive but it is 

indispensable for developing and refining predictive models of the post-fire response, 

both with and without erosion mitigation measures (Robichaud, 2009). Few datasets 

provide the necessary detail to calibrate or validate the model performance accurately, 

especially when the description of the temporal-spatial heterogeneity of soil loss is a 

goal (Brazier 2004). Therefore, several reviews have noted the necessity to focus on 

monitoring soil erosion by field measurements rather than on modelling (Brazier 2004; 

Verheijen et al., 2009). Ideally, the approaches to field measurement would be 

developed in conjunction with process-based models (Verheijen et al., 2009) including 

temporal and spatial variations of soil water repellency (Lemmnitz et al., 2008). Thus, 

though monitoring of soil loss is vital for model improvement, it must also be treated as 

a goal in itself to aid soil conservation and to inform managers and policy makers alike 

as to the erodibility of soils (Brazier 2004). The EROSFIRE project (Keizer et al., 2006, 

2007) set out to develop a model-based risk assessment tool for Portugal conditions in 

a combined measurement and modelling approach. Rainfall simulation experiments 

(RSE’s) were selected as the principal method for gathering the data required for initial 

calibration of the process- based model MEFIDIS (Nunes et al., 2005) for post-fire 

conditions, much along the lines of the approach applied in Nunes et al. (2009a, 

2009b). 

In this thesis, elaborated on the framework of the EROSFIRE project, plot runoff and 

erosion were measured at medium-short term intervals under simulated and natural 

rainfall. RSE’s have been widely used to study hydrological and erosion processes in 

recently burnt woodland areas, especially at spatial scales of 1 m2 and less (e.g. 

Sevink et al., 1989; Imeson et al.,1992; Kutiel et al.,1995; Benavides-Solorio and 

MacDonald, 2001; Johansen et al., 2001; Cerdà and Doerr, 2005; Coelho et al., 2005; 



Introduction 

37 
 

Ferreira et al.,2005a; Rulli et al., 2006; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007; Sheridan et al., 

2007). Despite the temporal variability observed in post-fire runoff and sediment losses, 

the bulk of those RSE’s studies refer to a singular time span after wildfire. Only Cerdà 

and Doerr (2005) and Sheridan et al. (2007) measured runoff and sediment over 

various time periods after the fire. In Portugal, few field RSE’s studies have been 

carried out in recently burnt eucalypt stands (Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007) or in other 

prevailing forest types (Walsh et al., 1998; Coelho et al., 2004; Ferreira et al., 2005a).  

RSE’s remove the variability of natural rainfall, allowing rainfall and runoff 

measurements to be related to infiltration and erosion rates with more confidence 

(Cerdà and Robichaud, 2009a). RSE’s can avoid the confounding effects of temporal 

and spatial variability and, thus, facilitate the comparison of results obtained at different 

times after a particular wildfire, as well as in study areas burnt by different wildfires 

(e.g. Cerdà, 1998) or with different land management (e.g. Malvar et al., 2011, 2013, 

chapter 2 and 3). To overcome the difficulties of monitoring the high spatial-temporal 

variations of post-fire runoff and erosion, RSE’s were used as a comparatively cheap 

and fast method to gather significant amounts of data under distinct land management 

conditions. To capture the pronounced temporal variability in hydrological and erosion 

processes following wildfires, repeated RSE’s field campaigns were carried out in six 

field campaigns during a two years time period after fire. However, RSE’s have well-

known limitations in terms of reproducing natural rainfall events (e.g. Rickson, 2001). 

The additional monitoring of similar micro-plots, at the same sites and during the same 

two post-fire years, allowed the direct comparison of natural and artificial rainfall 

results. Few studies have employed both methods simultaneously thus this is an 

important advancement in science since exhaustive comparison of both methods had 

rarely been made.  

Dependency of erosion measurements on spatial and temporal scale is well known 

(Morgan, 2005; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006; Ferreira et al., 2008). At the micro-plot 

scale employed in this study, either with natural or artificial rainfall, the plots do not 

reflect the continuity of the system. However, the plots present some advantages, such 

as the control of the variables inside the plot (Morgan, 2005), allowing the quantification 

of overland flow and erosion rates at a given period per unit of area, an estimation of 

the water infiltrated, and a detailed spatial and temporal assessment of hydrological 

and erosion processes. Closed plots also provided a comparison of different responses 

at the same spatial scale. Nevertheless, variability between replicated plots is observed 

and it can be explained by natural variability and partly by the alteration of field

measurement (measurement variability) (Nearing et al., 1999). Long term monitoring 

periods are needed in order to produce realistic soil erosion assessment. However, a 

medium-short term monitoring period provided qualitative conclusions and the 

identification of areas that are especially exposed to erosion (Leser et al., 2002).  

 

1.5 Aim and objectives 

 

The main aim of this thesis is to contribute to a better knowledge of the hydrological 

and soil erosion response, at the patch scale, in recently burnt areas by focussing on 

the role of pre- and post-fire forest land management conditions. Furthermore, the 

collected runoff, erosion and ancillary data are envisaged as a basis for testing and 

adapting existing soil erosion models, for post-fire conditions. The specific objectives 

were to: 

1. Quantify post-fire overland flow generation and associated sediment losses at 

seven forest stands that typify the range of post-fire conditions in north-central 

Portugal, including : (i) eucalypt and maritime pine plantations, (ii) a range of soil 

preparation techniques that had been carried out before the wildfires (i.e. unploughed, 

rip-ploughed in down-slope direction and along contours, and terraced), (iii) three types 

of post-fire land management: no management, logging and tree removal and hydro-

mulching, which is a post-fire emergency treatment; 

2. Determine the spatial variation as well as temporal patterns in the post-fire 

runoff and erosion response during the first two years following fire, by implementing 

multiple-plot experimental designs and by repeated rainfall simulation experiments 

(RSE’s) on multiple occasions, and by monitoring erosion plots with a high temporal 

resolution (1 weekly intervals); 

3. Identify the key factors explaining post-fire runoff and soil erosion, in particular 

rainfall amount, (simulated) rainfall intensity and land-use related variables such as soil 

water repellency and ground cover, including effects of hydromulching; 

4. Address the similarities of repeated rainfall simulation experiments (RSE’s) 

with natural rainfall conditions, by comparing the runoff and erosion rates and their 

temporal patterns produced by the RSE’s with those by natural rainfall events;

contents. 

 

1.6 Thesis structure 

 

The present thesis was done as part of the framework of two FCT-“Fundação 

Ciência e Tecnología” funded projects; the EROSFIRE (POCI/AGR/60354/2004) and 

the EROSFIRE-II (PTDC/AGR-CFL/70968/2006) with co-funding by FEDER through 

the POCI2010 Programme and the research grant of the author 

(SFRH/BD/41320/2007). 

 The thesis is structured in three main topics: 

1.6.1 Part 1: Post-fire soil erosion risk assessment: 

Post-fire overland flow generation and soil erosion response was measured in two 

Portuguese forest types, Eucalyptus globulus Labill and Pinus pinaster Ait. The studied 

burnt areas were located in North-Central Portugal (Figure 4). Measurements were 

carried out with different methodologies under contrasting pre- and post-fire land 

management (Table 1).  

In Chapter 2 repeated rainfall simulation experiments (RSE’s) were used to gather 

post-fire runoff and soil erosion data in two eucalypt stands with two different pre-fire 

land management (unploughed vs. down slope rip-ploughing). Chapter 3 was an 

extension of Chapter 2 in two ways. On the one hand, it included pre-fire contour 

ploughing and terracing, two other pre-ground preparation operations that, unlike down 

slope ploughing, are well-established soil conservation practices. On the other hand, 

two additional unploughed eucalypt plantations that were burnt by a different wildfire in 

which one was logged during the study period (Table 1). In both chapters, two rainfall 

intensities were applied; high (45-50 mm h-1; intensity comparable to the maximum 

hourly rainfall for a 100-year return period measured at the Aveiro rainfall station) and 

extreme (80-85 mm h-1; maximum hourly rainfall ever recorded in Portugal). The RSE’s 

were done at fixed plots on four occasions during the first year following wildfire and on 

two additional occasions during the second year.

In Chapters 4 and 5, runoff and soil erosion was measured under natural rainfall 

conditions with high temporal resolution (weekly) across different plot size classes, 

from micro-plot (0.25 m2) to plot scale (10 m2).

1.6.2 Part 2: Simulated versus Natural rainfall: 

The RSE’s results of chapter 2 can be directly compared with the natural rainfall 

results of chapter 4 since the measurements were done with equal plot sizes, at the 

same sites and during the same post-fire period. The RSE’s require much less time 

and effort and are easily repeatable compared to natural rainfall plots. Therefore, direct 

dataset comparison is intended to asses RSE’s as an alternative method to gather 

erosion data. 

Statistical analyses were carried out, on both simulated and natural rainfall datasets, 

to get a further insight into the temporal and spatial variability of hydrological and soil

erosion response after fires. However, due to basic methodology differences (mainly in 

the number of observations) the statistical methods employed in each case were not 

the same. The limited number of samples gathered with simulated rainfall posed 

difficulties to verify the key assumptions underlying the parametric tests.

Therefore, rank-based descriptive statistics and non-parametric statistical tests were 

used. The Mann-Whitney U-test and the Kruskal–Wallis test were employed to test 

overall differences, whereas the Wilcoxon’s signed-ranks test and the Friedman test 

were used to assess differences in paired observations, either neighbouring plots or 

repeated RSE’s on the fixed plots. In the natural rainfall dataset, the runoff and erosion 

variables were transformed in order to fit the normality assumption. Over the 

transformed variables the repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA-2way) was performed

in order to determine the site and time influence on runoff and erosion measurements. 

Multiple regression models were used to determine the significance of a set of 

independent variables (related with rainfall characteristics, ground cover, soil water 

repellency and other selected soil properties) over the measured runoff and sediment 

losses. 

1.6.3 Part 3: Key factors affecting runoff and sediment losses: 

Intensive collection of ancillary data was done in conjunction with the monitoring of 

runoff and sediment losses measured with simulated and natural rainfall. This data 

collection, mainly to assess the degree and changes in plot surface cover and selected 

soil properties, allowed for the identification of key factors affecting the overland flow 

generation and the sediment losses in post-fire environments. Soil water repellency 

was a recurring factor across all the study sites and methodologies in this thesis. In 

Chapter 6 the soil water repellency temporal and spatial variation was analyzed in 

detail for an unploughed and down-slope rip-ploughed eucalypt sites. Antecedent 

rainfall and soil moisture were studied as possible explanatory variables for the 

observed temporal and spatial soil water repellency patterns. Soil water repellency was 

measured using the “Molarity of Ethanol Droplet” (MED-test). Since the ethanol 

concentrations were discrete values rather than continuous, non-parametric statistical 

tests were used to analyze the soil water repellency data.

The aim of this study was to improve the existing knowledge of the runoff and inter-rill erosion

response of forest stands following wildfire, focusing on commercial eucalypt plantations and

employing field rainfall simulation experiments (RSE’s). Repeated RSE’s were carried out in two

adjacent but contrasting eucalypt stands on steep hill slopes in north-central Portugal that suffered a

moderate severity fire in July 2005. This was done at six occasions ranging from 3 to 24 months after the

fire and using a paired-plot experimental design that comprised two pairs of RSE’s at each site and

occasion. Of the 46 RSE’s: (i) 24 and 22 RSE’s involved application rates of 45–50 and 80–85 mm h?1,

respectively; (ii) 22 took place in a stand that had been ploughed in down slope direction several years

before the wildfire and 24 in an unploughed stand.

The results showed a clear tendency for extreme-intensity RSE’s to produce higher runoff amounts

and greater soil and organic matter losses than the simultaneous high-intensity RSE’s on the

neighbouring plots. However, there existed marked exceptions, both in space (for one of the plot pairs)

and time (under intermediate soil water repellency conditions). Also, overland flow generation and

erosion varied significantly between the various field campaigns. This temporal pattern markedly

differed from a straightforward decline with time-after-fire and rather suggested a seasonal

component, reflecting broad variations in topsoil water repellency. The ploughed site produced less

runoff and erosion than the unploughed site, contrary to what would be expected if the down slope

ploughing had occurred after the wildfire instead of several years before it. Finally, sediment losses at

both study sites were noticeably lower than those reported by other studies involving repeat RSE’s, i.e.

in Australia and western Spain. This possibly reflected a history of intensive land use in the study

region, including in more recent times after the widespread introduction of eucalypt plantations.

1. Introduction

As thoroughly discussed by Shakesby and Doerr (2006),
through their effects on soil properties as well as on vegetation
and litter cover, wildfires can lead to considerable changes in
geomorphologic and hydrological processes. Previous studies in
various parts of the world, including Portugal (e.g. Shakesby et al.,
1993, 1996; Walsh et al., 1992, 1995; Ferreira et al., 2005b, 2008),
have revealed strong and sometimes extreme responses in runoff
generation and associated soil losses following wildfire, especially
during the earlier stages of the so-called ‘‘window-of-distur-
bance’’. Besides wildfire itself, post-fire forestry practices can

strongly influence overland flow and erosion in recently burnt
areas (e.g. Shakesby et al., 1994; Walsh et al., 1995; Ferna?ndez
et al., 2007). For example, rip-ploughing during the window-of-
disturbance was far more damaging in terms of soil loss than fire
(Shakesby et al., 1994).

The need for a model-based tool for assessing erosion risk
following wildfire and, ultimately, for guiding post-fire land
management, like the Erosion Risk Management Tool (ERMiT) for
the Western USA (Robichaud et al., 2007), is overtly evident in the
case of Portugal. Over the past decades, wildfires in Portugal have
devastated on average around 100.000 ha each year, with
dramatically higher figures for dry years like 2003 and 2005
(Pereira et al., 2005). Furthermore, the frequency of wildfires in
Portugal is expected to remain the same or to increase in the
future (Pereira et al., 2006). In relation to fire occurrence, the
widespread introduction of commercial eucalypt plantations
(principally of Eucalyptus globulus Ait.) in central Portugal
(including in the study area) in combination with their proneness
to fire deserves special reference. Furthermore, post-fire erosion
risk is expectedly higher in eucalypt stands than, for example,

Maritime Pine forest, another common and fire-prone forest type
in central Portugal, namely, eucalypt stands are typically
associated with pronounced soil water repellency (Doerr et al.,
1996, 1998; Keizer et al., 2005b, 2008; Leighton-Boyce et al.,
2005), on the one hand, and on the other, water repellency is
widely considered one of the main factors in enhancing runoff
generation and the associated soil losses following wildfire
(e.g. Shakesby and Doerr, 2006; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007;
Sheridan et al., 2007).

Following the dramatic wildfire season of summer 2003, the
EROSFIRE project (Keizer et al., 2006, 2007) set out to develop
such an erosion prediction tool tailored to the specificities of post-
fire conditions in Portugal’s forests. Field rainfall simulation
experiments (RSE’s) were selected as principal method for
gathering the data required for initial calibration of the process-
based model MEFIDIS (Nunes et al., 2005) for post-fire conditions,
much along the lines of the approach applied in Nunes et al.
(2009a, 2009b). In spite of the well-know limitations of RSE’s in
terms of reproducing natural rainfall events and emulating runoff/
erosion processes beyond small spatial scales (e.g. Rickson, 2001),
they have been widely used for studying hydrological and erosion
processes in recently burnt woodland areas, especially at spatial
scales of 1 m2 and less (e.g. Imeson et al., 1992; Kutiel et al., 1995;
Sevink et al., 1989; Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald, 2001;
Johansen et al., 2001; Cerd?a and Doerr, 2005; Coelho et al., 2005;
Ferreira et al., 2005a; Rulli et al., 2006; Leighton-Boyce et al.,
2007; Sheridan et al., 2007). However, the bulk of these studies
concerned singular moments in time-after-fire, not addressing for
example the seasonal component in post-fire runoff and erosion
that is often observed in longer-term plot monitoring studies
under natural rainfall conditions (e.g. Shakesby et al., 1993, 1994).
Also, the individual studies generally involved a single rainfall
intensity. As far Portugal is concerned, surprisingly few field RSE
studies have been carried out in recently wildfire-burnt stands of
eucalypt (Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007) or, for that matter, in other
prevailing forest types (Walsh et al., 1998; Coelho et al., 2004;
Ferreira et al., 2005a).

The main aim of the present work was to explore repeated
field campaigns of RSE’s for a better knowledge and under-
standing of overland flow generation and associated sediment
losses in recently burnt commercial eucalypt plantations. To this
end, RSE’s were carried out in two eucalypt stands on four
occasions during the first year following wildfire and on two
additional occasions during the second year. Two adjacent sites
were selected for expectedly representing contrasting risks of
post-fire erosion, with the site that had been rip-ploughed
presenting a greater risk than the neighbouring unploughed site.

The specific objectives were to determine how overland flow
generation and sediment losses varied at the micro-plot scale
with (i) high vs. extreme simulated rainfall intensity (45–50 and
80–85 mm h?1); (ii) time since fire and associated changes in
initial conditions, in particular soil water repellency; (iii) within-
and between-site characteristics at a ploughed vs. unploughed
slope.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Study area and sites

The present study was carried out in two adjacent commercial eucalypt

(Eucalyptus globulus Ait.) plantations in the Ac-ores locality of the Albergaria-a-

Velha municipality of north-central Portugal (Fig. 1). The two study sites were

located at approximately 401420N, 81290W and 60–70 m elevation, and comprised

steep but short slopes bounded by paths (Table 1).

The study sites burned during early July 2005 in a wildfire that affected a total

area of about 16 km2, which was largely covered by eucalypt plantations. The

complete consumption of the litter and herb cover, together with the partial

consumption of the shrub layer and tree crowns, suggested that fire severity at

both sites had been moderate (Shakesby and Doerr, 2006; Table 1). Judging by

remaining tree stumps, the two sites had undergone at least two eucalypt

(re)growth cycles prior to the fire. The two sites were selected for their contrasting

land management practices and, as mentioned above, expectedly distinct risks of

post-fire soil erosion. At the unploughed Ac-ores1 site, trees had been planted

without apparent evidence of mechanical ground operations, resulting in an

undisturbed soil profile. At the ploughed Ac-ores2 site, a clear pattern of shallow

ridges and furrows (up to 20 cm high) running down the slope was present. Rip-

ploughing (i.e. mechanical ploughing using a ripper with one to three teeth that

rupture the upper soil horizons in a vertical plane without altering their

disposition) in preparation for planting is a common practice in this region and,

judging by the stand age, would have taken place around 5 years prior to the fire.

The study area is situated at the transition of the region’s two major

physiographic units, the Littoral Platform dominated by Ceno-Mesozoic deposits

and the Hesperic Massif dominated by pre-Ordovician schists and greywackes and

Hercynian granites (Ferreira, 1978; Pereira and FitzPatrick, 1995). The soils are

mapped – at a scale of 1:1,000,000 – as a complex of Humic Cambisols and, to a

lesser extent, Dystric Litosols (Cardoso et al., 1971, 1973). At both the study sites,

two soil profiles were excavated in the middle and at the bottom of the study

slopes. The soils corresponded to Umbric or Dystric Leptosols (FAO, 1988),

depending on the depth of their A horizons. They were shallow (5–40 cm depth)

soils developed over schists and had sandy loam textures and high organic matter

contents (8.8–10.4%). These soil characteristics differed little between the two

sites, which also agreed with the fact that rip-ploughing supposedly does not alter

the disposition of the soil layers. Even so, the observed soil differences were duly

considered in the discussion of the RSE results.

The climate of the study area can be characterised as humid meso-thermal,

with a prolonged dry and warm summer (Ko?ppen Csb) DRA-Centro (1998). Fig. 1

shows the locations of the study sites as well as of the nearest climate station

(Estarreja: 401470N, 81350W, 26 m; 17.5 km distance) and the nearest rainfall

station (Albergaria-a-Velha: 401420N, 81290W, 131 m; 4 km distance). The long-

term mean annual temperature at the Estarreja station is 13.9 1C and the mean

monthly temperatures range from 8.8 1C in December to 19.1 1C in July (DRA-

Centro, 1998). The annual rainfall at the Albergaria-a-Velha station is, on average,

1229 mm and varies between 750 and 2022 mm (DRA-Centro, 1998). Fig. 1 also

depicts the stations’ seasonal variations in average monthly temperature and

rainfall, and the monthly rainfall amounts at the study sites during the first year

following wildfire. These latter data were obtained with a tipping-bucket rainfall

gauge (Pronamic Professional Rain Gauge) linked to a Hobo Event Logger of Onset

Computer Corporation, and were verified using the data from two totaliser rainfall

gauges. All three gauges were installed at the foot of the study sites on September

24, 2005. These data were used in this paper to calculate the antecedent daily

rainfall for the different field sampling days.

2.2. Rainfall simulation experiments

Between September 2005 and July 2007, a total of 46 rainfall simulation

experiments (RSE’s) were carried out in the field using two portable simulators as

originally designed by Calvo et al. (1988) and later improved by Cerd?a et al. (1997).

One simulator was equipped with the original nozzle and was calibrated in the

laboratory to produce artificial rain with an intensity of approximately 45 mm h?1.

The second simulator was equipped with a modified nozzle, using cone nozzle

HARDI-1553-14 instead of HARDI-1553-10, to produce intensities of around

80 mm h?1. The former intensity is comparable to the maximum hourly rainfall

for a 100-year return period of the Aveiro rainfall station (Brand~ao et al., 2001). The

latter is similar to the maximum hourly rainfall ever recorded in Portugal (Brand~ao

et al., 2001) but a prior RSE study in Portuguese eucalypt forests like Leighton-Boyce

et al. (2007) applied still higher intensities (100 mm h?1) and found infiltration

capacities exceeding this value. Hereafter, the two intensities will be referred

to as ‘‘high’’ and ‘‘extreme’’, respectively. Other modifications to the original

simulator design involved the use of a battery-driven pump system with pressure

vat and of an approximately square plot (consisting of a square area of

0.50 m?0.50 m and an outlet area of 0.03 m2), both of which were introduced by

De Alba (1997).

The 46 RSE’s were carried out during four separate field campaigns in the first

year after the wildfire, and two more campaigns in the second year (Table 2).

Before every campaign (with the exception of the second) the two standard and

two spare nozzles were (re-)calibrated in the laboratory. Each campaign involved

four RSE’s on both the ploughed and unploughed site, except in the case of the

October 2006 campaign when only the high-intensity RSE’s were carried out at the

unploughed site due to failure of the extreme-intensity pump system. The four

RSE’s at a particular site were in general performed on the same day and within

less than a week of those carried out at the other study site. Exceptions were the

first campaign on the ploughed site and the October 2006 campaign, which took

place on September 20 and 22, 2005, and October 12 and 31, 2006, respectively.

The four RSE’s at each site and date were carried out using a pair-wise

sampling design. High- and extreme-intensity RSE’s were run almost

M.C. Malvar et al. / Environmental Research 111 (2011) 222–236 223



simultaneously on two neighbouring plots located at about the same elevation on

the slope but separated across the slope by 3–5 m. The two pairs of neighbouring

plots on each site were placed randomly by installing them halfway the slope’s

upper and lower half. This was done in a horizontal section of the slope that was

specifically reserved for the RSE’s. The slope was further divided in a section that

was equipped with erosion plots and a section that was used to describe topsoil

characteristics at regular intervals (see Keizer et al., 2008). According to their

spatial lay-out, the RSE-plots at each site were designated as follows: 1 and 2 were

located on upper slope sections, 3 and 4 on the lower slope sections; 1 and 3

concerned high-intensity RSE’s, 2 and 4 extreme-intensity RSE’s. The prefixes ‘‘U’’

and ‘‘P’’ were used to indicate the plots on the unploughed and ploughed site,

respectively.

The RSE’s of the first campaign were immediately followed by destructive

sampling of the plots as soon as the runoff had stopped. The RSE’s of the second

and subsequent campaigns, however, were carried out on permanent plots, with

the repeat experiments on each plot involving the same intensity as established

randomly in October 2006. Each pair of RSE’s involved a third ‘‘control’’ plot for

destructive measurements and sampling of the initial conditions, in particular

regarding soil water repellency and moisture content at various depths. Non-

destructive characterisation of the RSE-plots was done prior to all experiments and

involved a standard procedure of quantifying the frequency of various cover

classes by recording their presence/absence in the 5 cm?5 cm cells of a

50 cm?60 cm grid laid out over the plots. Photographs were taken and used to

check the frequency estimates and convert them into decimal cover classes from

0 to 10.

The destructive sampling of the initial RSE-plots and control plots concerned

first and foremost the moisture content and water repellency of the topsoil at 2–3

and 7–8 cm depth. This involved the same methods, equipment and water

repellency severity ratings as described in Keizer et al. (2008). In a nutshell, soil

moisture content was measured using an ML2 ThetaProbeTM connected to a HH2

ThetaMeter (Delta T-Devices Ltd.) or, in case of probe failure, gravimetrically and

then converted based on Saxton et al. (1986) and Costa (1999). Water repellency

severity was measured using the ‘Molarity of an Ethanol Droplet’ (MED) test (e.g.

King, 1981; Doerr, 1998), by applying three droplets of increasing ethanol

concentration and employing their median ethanol concentration (%vol) as test

result. The following nine ethanol classes and corresponding ethanol concentra-

tions were used: 0–0%; 1–1%; 2–3%; 3–5%; 4–8.5%; 5–13%; 6–18%; 7–24%;

8–Z36%. Random roughness was determined using a pin profile metre and the

PMPPROJ software (developed by J. Kilpelainen, Agricultural Research Centre,

Jokioinen, Finland) for processing the photographs.

All RSE’s were carried out using a pre-established protocol and standard field

forms that were derived, with some modifications, from those employed in the

MEDAFOR project (Shakesby et al., 2002). The protocol’s principal elements were

the application of artificial rain from a height of 2 m during 1 h, runoff

measurements at 1-min intervals and the collection of up to five runoff samples

(i.e. one from the start of the runoff till its approximate stabilisation; one from the

end of the rainfall till the end of the runoff; three at the start, middle and end of

the remaining period). The collected runoff samples were later analysed in the

laboratory for their sediment and organic matter loads using the classical

evaporation protocol (APHA, 1998) and loss-on-ignition at 550 1C. Soil texture

classes were determined by the Soil Laboratory of the Coimbra Higher School of

Agriculture, using a combination of mechanical sieving and the pipette method.

2.3. Data analysis

Data analysis was carried out using STATISTICA for Windows Version 9.0, by

StatSoft Inc. Rank-based descriptive statistics and non-parametric statistical tests

were preferred, in particular because of the limited number of samples and the

resulting difficulties in verifying key assumptions underlying the parametric

equivalents. The Mann-Whitney U-test and the Kruskal–Wallis test were

employed to test overall differences, whereas the Wilcoxon’s signed-ranks test

and the Friedman test were used to assess differences in paired observations,

either neighbouring plots or repeat-RSE’s on the permanent plots. Besides

differences between individual RSE’s, also differences in average values of

concurrent high-/extreme-intensity RSE’s were included in the analyses for being

less susceptible to possible noise due to spatial variability. In the case of the

temporal patterns, only differences between consecutive campaigns were tested.

This was done to restrict the number of multiple, unplanned comparisons to a

minimum. Also the significance of the between-site differences of the individual

RSE’s was assessed using the standard type I error a¼0.05 and not using the
comparison-wise type I error a0¼0.025 following the Dunn–S?ida?k method for 2
unplanned comparisons (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981).

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Overall runoff and erosion rates

Table 2 summarises the overall runoff and erosion figures
obtained over the six field campaigns between September 2005
and July 2007. Direct comparison of the presented values is
hampered by the lack of extreme-intensity data at the un-
ploughed site for the October 2006 campaign. Nonetheless, the
main differences observable in Table 2 are similar to those for the
five common campaigns (explained below).

The two simulated rainfall intensities had a negligible effect on
the relative amounts of overland flow generation at the two study
sites; runoff coefficients were rather determined by site-specific
differences. For the five ‘‘common’’ periods, the overall runoff
coefficients amounted to 57–58% and 38–39% for the unploughed
and ploughed site, respectively. In terms of absolute runoff
amounts, the extreme-intensity RSE’s at each site therefore
produced, on average, about 70% more overland flow than the
high-intensity RSE’s on the same site. The extreme-intensity
values for the five ‘‘common’’ campaigns were 231 and 154 mm
for the unploughed and ploughed site, respectively; the corre-
sponding high-intensity values were 133 and 91 mm.

Total losses of soil and organic matter were determined by a
combined effect of site-specific factors and rainfall intensity. The
losses at the unploughed site exceeded those at the ploughed site.
For the five ‘‘common’’ campaigns, the total soil losses were 25
and 89 g m?2 vs. 14 and 21 g m?2, respectively, and the
corresponding total organic matter losses were 18 and 56 g m?2

vs. 10 and 14 g m?2. The between-site differences for the separate
rainfall intensities were more pronounced. The losses at the
unploughed site were almost twice as high in the case of the high-
intensity RSE’s and more than four times as high in the case of the
extreme-intensity RSE’s. The intensity-related differences in total
losses were bigger at the unploughed than ploughed site. The
extreme-intensity RSE’s produced, on average, roughly three
times more soil and organic matter loss than the high-intensity
RSE’s at the unploughed site but only 40–50% higher losses at the
ploughed site.

The intensity-related differences in total soil and organic
matter losses can in the case of the unploughed site be partly
attributed to higher specific losses. The specific losses were about
twice as high for the extreme- than high-intensity RSE’s. By
contrast, at the ploughed site the specific losses were basically the
same for the two intensities. The contribution of the specific
losses to the between-site differences was also not consistent.
They were of minor influence in the case of the high-intensity

RSE’s, but contributed with roughly a factor two in the case of the
extreme-intensity RSE’s.

The present results were perhaps most surprising in that the
ploughed site produced, on average, less runoff and lower total
sediment losses than the unploughed site. In a nearby area, down
slope rip-ploughing was found to substantially enhance overland
flow responses and sediment loss rates during the first three years
after ploughing (Shakesby et al., 1994; Walsh et al., 1995). These
results are not directly comparable to those presented here,
namely, they concerned much bigger plots (16 m2) and lower,
natural rainfall intensities. Even so, the overall sediment loss rates
of the high-intensity RSE’s of this study (0.09–0.16 g m?2 mm?1

rainfall) were much more similar to those reported by Shakesby
et al. (1994) for ‘‘natural recovery’’ post-burn sites (0.05–0.10 g
m?2 mm?1 rainfall) than for a recently rip-ploughed site do
(3.27 g m?2 mm?1 rainfall; see also Terry (1996)).

The lower-than-expected sediment losses at the ploughed site
could be related to the fact that ploughing took place several years
before the wildfire. Shakesby et al. (1994) estimated that sediment
losses decline rapidly following rip-ploughing. They attributed this
to the formation of a protective stone lag, particularly in the early
stages, and to the subsequent development of vegetation and litter
cover. There was, however, no evidence that surface stone cover in
the RSE-plots was noticeably higher at the ploughed than
unploughed site. Walsh et al. (1995) further suggested that rip-
ploughing ultimately decreased soil erodibility through selective
removal of the fine soil fraction by initial erosion events. This fits in
with the lower specific soil losses at the ploughed than unploughed
site, especially in the case of the extreme-intensity RSE’s. The topsoil
(0–5 cm) at the ploughed site has, in fact, somewhat smaller clay
and loam fractions than that at the unploughed site (median values
of 3 samples: 7 and 20 vs. 13% and 24%, respectively). Nonetheless,
the lower specific soil losses at the ploughed site could also be due
to its smaller runoff amounts as well as to the expectedly lower flow
velocities due to its less steep slope angle. Between-site differences
are further analysed below.

The overall runoff and erosion values are not easily compared with
those from literature, namely, the bulk of the field RSE studies
following recent forest wildfires concerned singular moments in time
(e.g. Sevink et al., 1989; Kutiel et al., 1995; Benavides-Solorio and
MacDonald, 2001; Johansen et al., 2001; Rulli et al., 2006). Focusing
on Portugal, only Leighton-Boyce et al. (2007) seem to have carried
out RSE’s in a recently burnt eucalypt plantation as well. In terms of
rainfall intensity (100 mm h?1) and pre-fire ploughing, their RSE’s
compare best with the extreme-intensity RSE’s at the ploughed site.
Compared with these RSE’s, both the mean runoff coefficient and
mean specific sediment loss of Leighton-Boyce et al. (2007) were
roughly twice as high (70% and 0.90 g m?2 mm?1 runoff).

RSE data are also scarce for recently burnt stands of another
common and fire-prone forest type in Portugal, that of Maritime
Pine. Using basically the same experimental set-up as here,

Coelho et al. (2004) and Ferreira et al. (2005a) found runoff
coefficients of 55–65%, which is comparable to the overall figure
for the high-intensity RSE’s at the unploughed site. The specific
sediment losses in Coelho et al. (2004), however, were 3–4 times
higher (0.90–1.20 g m?2 mm?1 runoff) than the corresponding
values of the present study. Walsh et al. (1998) reported lower
runoff coefficients (19–25%) but this was 2 years after a wildfire
and involved lower application rates (33–35 mm h?1) as well as
larger plots (1 m2).

Outside Portugal, wildfire-affected eucalypt stands were stu-
died in a particularly exhaustive manner in Australia by Sheridan
et al. (2007). This included eight subsequent campaigns of field
RSE’s but, unlike in this study, using different plots during each
campaign. With rainfall intensities of 100 mm h?1 applied (during
30 min) on unploughed soils, these RSE’s are best compared with
the extreme-intensity RSE’s at the unploughed site. Over the first
2 years after fire, Sheridan et al. (2007) found a somewhat lower
runoff coefficient (41%) than reported here but an almost six times
higher specific sediment loss (3.26 g m?2 mm?1 runoff), possibly
reflecting their larger plot size (3 m2).

Organic matter constituted an important fraction of the
sediment losses observed in the present study. It amounted, on
average, to some 40% and varied little between the two sites and
the two intensities (38–42%). This is held to reflect the export of
litter and especially ash particles, since the organic matter content
of the 0–5 cm topsoil at both sites was only some 10%
(unploughed site¼10.3%; ploughed site¼9.0%; median value of
three samples). Unfortunately, comparison with the other studies
cited in this section is not possible, since they do not present
separate data on organic matter losses.

3.2. Variation with rainfall intensity

Overall differences between the high- and extreme-intensity
RSE’s tended not to be statistically significant (Table 3). The
absolute runoff amounts constituted an exception, with signifi-
cant differences in three of the four tests. The extreme-intensity
RSE’s only did not produce significantly more runoff than the
high-intensity RSE’s in the case of the ploughed site. This can be
attributed to a greater spatio-temporal variability in the site’s
hydrological response, namely, the difference in median runoff
amounts is of the same of order of magnitude for the ploughed
site as for the unploughed site (approximately 20 vs. 25 mm).

The effect of rainfall intensity was more apparent from the
Wilcoxon’s Test results, i.e. when eliminating the variability due
to differences between the campaigns as well as between the plot
pairs. Besides runoff amounts, total soil and organic matter losses
revealed statistically significant differences. The significance of
these differences and their sign can be perceived from Fig. 2. Thus,
extreme-intensity RSE’s tended to produce significantly stronger

runoff and erosion responses than the simultaneous high-
intensity RSE’s on the neighbouring plots. This especially applied
to (i) absolute as opposed to relative measures; (ii) the two sites
together and the unploughed site alone as opposed to the
ploughed site alone. The runoff values at the ploughed site
revealed a suspicious pattern in Fig. 2, with an equal number of
points situated above and below the 1:1 line. Therefore, the
Wilcoxon’s tests were also applied to the site’s separate plot pairs,
even though the numbers of paired observations are small (n¼5).
For both plot pairs total runoff was significantly different.
However, whilst total runoff was significantly higher for the
extreme- than high-intensity RSE’s in one case (plots P1 and P2 on

the upper section of the slope), it was significantly lower in the
other case (plots P3 and P4). In the case of the former plot pair, the
extreme-intensity RSE’s also produced significantly higher total
soil and organic matter losses.

The deviant behaviour of especially one of the plot pairs on the
ploughed site could be related to the pre-fire ploughing, leading to
more heterogeneous micro-topographic and topsoil conditions in
comparison to the undisturbed soil profiles of the neighbouring
site. This could involve a combination of factors rather than a
single factor per se. For example, the slope angle of the high-
intensity plot on the lower slope section (P3: 201) was slightly
steeper than that of the adjacent extreme-intensity plot (P4: 181)

and, at the same time, its random roughness was somewhat
smaller (1.1 vs. 1.7). Also, spatial variability in topsoil water
repellency (0–5 cm) during the first year following the wildfire
tended to be more pronounced in the case of the ploughed than
unploughed site (Keizer et al., 2008). Litter cover could play a role
as well, since the P4 plot had a much higher litter cover than the
P3 plot from the second campaign onwards (Fig. 6). This was due
to the fall of leaves from scorched eucalypt crowns, which then
slowly decomposed in situ. Shakesby et al. (1994) also mentioned
this phenomenon in burnt eucalypt stands but expected its role in
limiting erosion to be short lived. The role of such a litter cover
could be direct – through interception storage and protection
against rain drop impact – or indirect – by increasing the
resistance to overland flow and/or by changing soil moisture as
well as water repellency (e.g. Imeson et al., 1992; Lavee et al.,
1995; Walsh et al., 1998; Doerr et al., 2000; Pannkuk and
Roubichaud, 2003; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007).

3.3. Temporal patterns

The timing of the RSE’s had a significant influence on runoff
response in general (Table 4). Overland flow generation varied
significantly between the five and six campaigns: (i) in absolute as
well as relative amounts; (ii) equally so for the average and
individual values of the two sites together as for the values of the
ploughed and unploughed site separately; (iii) in terms of both plot-
specific and overall differences. The same applied to the total soil
and organic matter losses. In the case of the specific losses, however,
only the individual values of the two sites together and of the
ploughed site separately varied significantly with time-since-fire.

Comparison of the consecutive campaigns revealed that sig-
nificant changes in hydrological and erosion processes principally
occurred between campaigns 2 (November 2005) and 3 (March/
April 2006) as well as between campaigns 5 (October 2006) and 6
(July 2007) (Table 4). These last two campaigns differed significantly
for all the variables studied here. Total runoff stood out amongst the
various variables in that the differences between campaigns 2 and 3
as well as between campaigns 5 and 6 were only statistically
significant on a plot-wise basis and not also in general. This probably
reflected the significant differences in runoff amounts between the

extreme- and high-intensity RSE’s (see Table 3), adding to campaign-
wise variability.

In close agreement with the above-mentioned statistical
results, the temporal variation in runoff and erosion revealed
two distinctive patterns (Fig. 3). First, the median values were
clearly higher for the first two and the last campaigns than for the
third to fifth campaigns. Second, median values of the first five
campaigns were noticeably lower than that of the last campaign.
The first pattern applied to the absolute and relative runoff
amounts as well as to the absolute sediment losses, whilst the
second pattern concerned the relative sediment losses. A
consistent element in the first pattern was further that the
median value of the fourth campaign (July 2006) was lower than
those of the third and fifth campaigns).

The temporal patterns in soil water repellency and other
potential explanatory variables are shown in Fig. 4. The significant
decrease in overland flow and total sediment losses between 4 and 9
months after the wildfire agreed well with a pronounced drop-off at
both sites in topsoil water repellency from extremely hydrophobic
to hydrophilic. The significant increase in runoff and erosion
between 16 and 24 months after the wildfire, however, was less
consistent with differences in repellency. Whilst at the ploughed site
median ethanol classes were higher in July 2007 than October 2006,
at the unploughed site they were basically the same. The limited
hydrological impact of the very strong repellency of the unploughed
soil in October 2006 could be due to the antecedent rainfall (10 mm
in the two preceding days), enhancing the spatial variability in
repellency and, thereby, opportunities for re-infiltration of overland
flow (e.g. Shakesby et al., 2000; Keizer et al., 2005a).

The results of the summer 2006 campaign also casted doubt on
the role of soil water repellency, with the ploughed site
presenting the most puzzling case. All four RSE’s at this site then
produced the least runoff, even though repellency was equally
strong as during the first two campaigns and also rather
homogeneous (range of ethanol classes: 6–8; n¼10). In the case
of the unploughed site, the reduced runoff production in July 2007
could be due to the moderate median repellency level as opposed
to the very strong/extreme level during fall 2005 and summer
2007. The discrepancy in water repellency between the un-
ploughed and ploughed site during the July 2006 campaign can be
explained by the 15 mm of rainfall that fell on July 19, 2006,

outcomes (a¼0.05) of the Kruskal–Wallis test, Friedman test, MW U-test and Wilcoxon S–R test are indicated with ‘‘K’’, ‘‘F’’, ‘‘M’’ and ‘‘W’’.

i.e. one vs. six days before the RSE’s at the unploughed and
ploughed site, respectively. On July 10 and July 24, 2006,
repellency was very strong at both sites (Keizer et al., 2008).

The overall importance of vegetation recovery in limiting
erosion during the study period was minor, as can be inferred
from the comparatively high soil and organic matter losses of the

last RSE campaign. Recovery of the ground vegetation was in fact
limited during these 2 years following the wildfire (Fig. 4). By July
2006, vegetation cover was less than 20% in seven out of eight

plots; by July 2007, it was less than 40% in all except the two plots
depicted in Fig. 4. Shakesby et al. (1994) also indicated that
ground vegetation in eucalypt stands recovered too slowly after

fire to be effective within the first 2 years. The possible role of
vegetation cover at the scale of individual plots is addressed next.

The RSE’s by Sheridan et al. (2007) revealed a better overall
agreement between the temporal patterns in runoff coefficient and
soil water repellency than found here. Their highest runoff values
were not restricted to the first few months after the wildfire but also
occurred some 3 years later. Even so, differences in runoff could not
be entirely attributed to water repellency, in particular the almost
twice as high runoff coefficient 3 years compared to 1 month after
fire under equally strongly repellent conditions. Clearly distinct from
the current results was Sheridan’s et al. (2007) finding of markedly
higher sediment concentrations during the first year after fire. Such
a decrease suggests a transition from transport- to sediment-limited
conditions, as is also commonly observed in post-fire erosion plot
studies under natural rainfall (see Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). Their
specific sediment losses during the first post-fire year (2.26–
7.19 g m?2 mm?1 runoff) clearly exceeded the present values. Their
values for the subsequent 2 years (0.13–1.59 g m?2 mm?1 runoff),
however, were comparable.

The only other study involving a time series of RSE’s in wildfire-
affected forests is that of Cerd?a and Doerr (2005) in Aleppo Pine
stands in eastern Spain. They employed the same simulator as in this
study (application rate of 55 mm h?1) and also permanent plots.
During the first 3 years following fire, their RSE’s produced higher
runoff coefficients under wet than under dry conditions. This
contrasting hydrological response could be explained by the low
water repellency levels during this initial post-fire period, likely as a
direct effect of fire. The erosion results of Cerd?a and Doerr (2005)
were also distinct from the present ones. The specific sediment
losses dropped sharply from the first to the second year after fire
and then more gradually afterwards. Only from the sixth year
onwards the specific losses in Cerd?a and Doerr (2005) fell below
0.40 g m?2 mm?1 runoff, thus becoming comparable to the bulk of
the high-intensity values presented here. Their values for the first
post-fire year (2.50–5.25 g m?2 mm?1 runoff) were not widely
different from Sheridan’s et al. (2007) above-mentioned figures for
the first post-fire year, even though application rate and plot size
were much smaller (55 vs. 100 mm h?1; 0.25 vs. 3 m2).

3.4. Spatial variability

Within-site differences. Overall differences between the same-
intensity plots were not significant for any of the sites or variables
(Table 5). This can be attributed to the above-mentioned,
significant temporal variability between the various RSE cam-
paigns. Campaign-specific differences, on the other hand, were
significant in various instances, all of which involving extreme-
intensity plots. The latter suggested that extreme events en-
hanced the inherent spatial variability in plot characteristics and,
consequently, erosion processes. These significant differences,
however, had different origins at the two sites. In the case of the
ploughed site, the runoff response of the two extreme-intensity
plots differed widely (Fig. 5). In turn, this discrepancy in runoff
caused significant different total soil and organic matter losses,
since the specific losses differed in the opposite sense. In the case
of the unploughed site, by contrast, significant differences in
specific soil losses contributed markedly to the significant
differences in total soil losses.

As discussed before, the significantly lower amount of over-
land flow generated at one of the extreme-intensity plots at the
ploughed site (plot P4) could be explained by its high litter cover
(Fig. 6), possibly in combination with other factors. The sig-
nificantly higher specific soil losses at plot U4 at the unploughed
site were more difficult to explain, also because plot-specific data
related to soil erodibility were not available. Post-fire vegetation
recovery could play a role, since it was basically lacking at plot U4
but pronounced at plot U2 (Fig. 6). It would especially help
explain why the plots’ specific losses differed considerably less in
July 2007 than in November 2005 (with a factor 3 and 6,
respectively).

In particular during the campaigns of November 2005 and July
2007, the specific sediment losses recorded at plot U4 stood out
amongst the present values. Compared to other studies, however,
these values (1.7 and 1.1 g m?2 mm?1 runoff) were hardly
suspicious. Leighton-Boyce et al. (2007) reported a mean value
of 2.3 g m?2 mm?1 runoff for an unburnt eucalypt site where the
litter was removed prior to the RSE’s. Specific sediment losses in

bility in specific sediment losses in concurrent RSE’s was not

The credibility of the relatively high losses at plot U4 was
further corroborated by the strong increase in the plot’s stone
cover (Fig. 6). It remained unclear, however, if this stone lag
already existed before the wildfire, becoming increasingly
exposed by the subsequent removal of the ash layer and the lack
of vegetation recovery, or whether it developed during the study
period. The former explanation is perhaps most likely, namely,
Shakesby et al. (1993) and Terry (1996) reported a much higher
specific sediment loss (11.9 g m?2 mm?1 runoff) for the initial
phase of stone lag formation in an eucalypt stand.

Between-site differences. The unploughed site revealed a
significantly stronger average runoff response than the ploughed
site (Table 5). This was true for both the absolute and relative
runoff amounts and for both the high- and extreme-intensity
RSE’s, as is also easily perceived from Fig. 7. By contrast,
significant differences in average sediment losses were restricted
to the total soil and organic matter losses of the extreme-intensity
RSE’s, again with the values at the unploughed site being highest.
Nonetheless, also the high-intensity RSE’s revealed some ten-
dency towards higher average soil losses at the unploughed site,
namely, the values at the unploughed site were highest in five out
of the six RSE campaigns.

Although the Wilcoxon’s test results for the individual plots
were indicative only, they allowed further insight in the average
between-site differences (Table 5). This especially applied to the
extreme-intensity RSE’s, namely, the significant difference in the
average extreme-intensity values was due to pronounced spatial
variation at the ploughed site and, more specifically, the deviant
behaviour of plot P4, as also readily appreciated in Fig. 5. Plot P4
not only produced, as mentioned above, consistently less sedi-
ment and/or runoff than the other extreme-intensity plot at the
ploughed site and even the neighbouring high-intensity plot but
also then the two extreme-intensity plots at the unploughed site.
Thus, the extreme-intensity results of this study were strongly
influenced by a highly localised and rather accidental factor like
litter fall from scorched crowns.

4. Conclusions

The main conclusions from this study include the following:

? Extreme-intensity RSE’s (80–85 mm h?1) tended to generate
larger amounts of runoff and, thereby, higher losses of soil and

organic matter than high-intensity RSE’s (45–50 mm h?1);
however, this tendency was not invariable either in space or, at
a certain location, through time.
? Within-site variability in runoff and erosion response was

more pronounced in the case of the extreme- than high-
intensity RSE’s, so that their modelling will require greater
efforts in terms of model calibration and/or obtaining plot-
specific information.
? Runoff and associated sediment losses varied significantly with

time-after-fire; however, this temporal pattern did not
correspond to a simple decrease with time but had a marked
seasonal component, which broadly agreed with the role of
topsoil water repellency in enhancing overland flow genera-
tion under dry antecedent weather conditions.
? The risk of enhanced runoff generation and erosion in recently

burnt eucalypt stands does not necessarily disappear with the
first significant rains after the wildfire but can persist through
most of the first autumn and also re-appear after subsequent
dry spells as long as 2 years later; this could be attributed to
the typically pronounced water repellency of eucalypt forest
soils combined with an often slow post-fire vegetation
recovery.
? Contrary to expected, the unploughed site produced more

runoff and erosion than the adjacent unploughed site. Besides
soil properties altered by ploughing, the difference in slope
angle between the two sites could play a role. These possible
explanations will be further explored using the MEFIDIS
erosion model as research tool.
? The sediment losses at the two study sites were low compared

to those obtained with similar methodologies (i.e. field rainfall
simulation experiments on small plots) following wildfires in
other parts of the world. Nonetheless, they need to be
evaluated against the typically shallow soil depths on the
steep hill slopes in the study area, with the elevated organic
matter fractions in the observed sediment losses requiring
special attention.

This study addressed the impacts of contrasting pre-fire ground preparation operations on post-fire runoff
and inter-rill erosion in six eucalypt plantations in north-central Portugal, with a special emphasis on the
role of soil water repellency in the seasonal patterns of overland flow generation. To this end, a down
slope ploughed, a contour ploughed and a terraced site were compared with three unploughed sites. Runoff
and erosion data were collected in the field by carrying out rainfall simulation experiments (RSEs) with two
intensities (45–50 and 80–85 mm h?1) at six occasions during the first one to two years following wildfires
in 2005 and 2006.
Overall runoff coefficients varied markedly amongst the six study sites and between the two intensities (7 to
55%). While runoff figures were comparable to those of prior RSE studies in recently burnt areas, overall sed-
iment losses were comparatively low (7–155 g m?2) but contained a substantial organic matter fraction
(29–74%). Apparently, the inter-rill erosion rates were essentially sediment-limited, fitting in with the long
history of intensive land use that is typical in the Mediterranean Basin. The hydrological and erosion impacts
of the three pre-fire ground preparation operations were minor, probably because these operations took
place several years before the latest wildfire. Overall, the two rainfall intensities produced the expected
differences but this effect was only statistically significant for simultaneous RSEs. Furthermore, the effect of
rainfall intensity varied markedly between the study sites and, occasionally, between the two plot pairs at
the same site. This impeded an erosion risk ranking of the six study sites that was consistent for both rainfall
intensities. Runoff and erosion rates did not decrease in a simple or pronounced manner with time-since-fire.
These temporal patterns could in part be attributed to changes in soil water repellency but other factors were
involved as well. Removal of the protective soil cover by litter in particular appeared to play a key role in the
increase in sediment losses following logging and wood extraction.

1. Introduction

Wildfires are a common phenomenon in present-day Portugal and
have affected an average of 100,000 ha of rural lands per year over
the past three decades (Pereira et al., 2005). Two key factors behind
the elevated wildfire incidence in Portugal are land abandonment and
widespread planting of highly flammable pines and eucalypts (Carmo
et al., 2011; Moreira et al., 2001). Due to the structural nature of these
underlying causes, combined with an increase in meteorological condi-
tions propitious to wildfire (longer and more frequent drought pe-
riods), wildfire occurrence in Portugal is also not expected to decrease
in the foreseeable future (Pereira et al., 2006).

Wildfires can produce marked changes in hydrological and erosion
processes (Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). Fire-enhanced runoff and erosion
rates are attributed to the (partial) removal of the protective vegetation
and litter cover, and to heating-induced alterations in soil properties con-
trolling runoff generation and soil erodibility such as soil water repellen-
cy and aggregate stability, respectively (Mataix-Solera et al., 2011;
Shakesby, 2011; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006; Varela et al., 2010). Strong
increases in runoff and erosion following wildfire have also been
reported for the two principal forest types in north-central Portugal,
i.e. Maritime Pine and eucalypt plantations (e.g. Coelho et al., 2004;
Ferreira et al., 1997; Shakesby et al., 1994). Eucalypt plantations are typ-
ically associated with elevated levels of soil water repellency (Doerr et
al., 1998, 2000; Ferreira et al., 2008; Keizer et al., 2005b, 2008; Scott,
2000), and their crucial importance for post-fire runoff generation was
demonstrated by Leighton-Boyce et al. (2007).

Post-fire forestry practices can contribute markedly to an enhanced
hydrological and erosion response of recently burnt areas (Fernández

et al., 2007; Shakesby, 2011). In the study region, rip-ploughing in down
slope direction to prepare eucalypt planting increased sediment losses
to rates well beyond those immediately after fire (Shakesby et al.,
1996, 2002; Walsh et al., 1995). Contour ploughing and terracing are
also regularly employed in recently burnt areas in the study region,
but their erosion implications remain to be studied. The role of
pre-fire ground preparation techniques (i.e. when ploughing and ter-
racing took place before the latest wildfire) has equally received little
research attention, in spite forest lands in north-central Portugal — as
is typical for many Mediterranean landscapes (Shakesby, 2011) — are
nowadays an intricate mosaic of terraced, ploughed and unploughed
terrains. Malvar et al. (2011) compared an eucalypt plantation that
had been ploughed in down slope direction several years before a wild-
fire with an adjacent unploughed eucalypt plantation, finding no
marked differences in immediate post-fire erosion rates.

While there is thus a strong need for an ERMIT-like tool (Robichaud
et al., 2007) for assessing soil erosion risk in recently burnt areas in
Portugal, its development is constrained by a lack of data for model pa-
rameterization and assessment. In the EROSFIRE project, field rainfall
simulation experiments (RSEs) were selected to overcome some of
these data constraints, focussing on the comparison of different pre-
fire ground preparation techniques. RSEs have well-known limitations
in terms of reproducing natural rainfall events and erosion processes
beyond small spatial scales (e.g. Rickson, 2001). However, they avoid
the confounding effects of seasonal and inter-annual variations in rain-
fall that are typical for erosion plot data (Cerdà and Doerr, 2005;
Shakesby et al., 1993; Spigel and Robichaud, 2007) and, thus, facilitate
the comparison of results obtained at different moments in time after
a certain wildfire as well as in study areas burnt by different wildfires
(e.g. Cerdà, 1998). Seasonal differences in erosion deserve special atten-
tion when studying eucalypt plantations, because of the supposed role of
soil water repellency in runoff generation (Doerr et al., 2006; Ferreira et
al., 2000; Keizer et al., 2005a; Sheridan et al., 2007), on the one hand, and,
on the other, the well-known variation in repellency with dry and wet
seasons (Doerr et al., 2000; Keizer et al., 2005b; Leighton-Boyce
et al., 2005). RSEs have been widely used in post-fire erosion studies
(e.g. Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald, 2001; Coelho et al., 2004;
Kutiel et al., 1995; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007; Sevink et al., 1989) but
only Cerdà and Doerr (2005), Sheridan et al. (2007) and Malvar et al.
(2011) did so at more than a single moment in time after fire.

The present study was an extension of Malvar et al. (2011) in two
manners. It included pre-fire contour ploughing and terracing, two
further pre-ground preparation operations that, unlike down slope
ploughing, are well-established soil conservation practices. Also, it in-
cluded two additional unploughed eucalypt plantations that were
burnt by a different wildfire and one of which was logged during
the study period (by chance). The specific objectives of the present
study were to assess and evaluate how post-fire runoff and erosion
rates: (i) differed amongst eucalypt plantations that had and had
not suffered contrasting ground preparation operations before the latest
wildfire; (ii) varied with time-since-fire and, in particular, with temporal
patterns in soil water repellency, vegetation recovery and post-fire forest-
ry operations; and (iii) differed between high- and extreme-intensity
simulated rainfall events (45–50 vs. 80–85 mm h?1).

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Study area and sites

Within the Aveiro District of north-central Portugal, the Açores
and Jafafe study locations were selected following a wildfire in July
2005, and the Soutelo study location following a wildfire in August
2006 (Fig. 1). Soutelo was the nearest 2006-burnt location to Açores
and Jafafe with the same geology (the distance is some 9 km towards
east). A total of six hillslopes — two per study location — were select-
ed to compare eucalypt plantations (Eucalyptus globulus Ait.) with and

without ground preparation techniques carried out before the latest
wildfire (Table 1). The three unploughed study sites were designated
as UP05_A1 (UnPloughed, 2005-burnt, Açores1), and UP06_S1 and
UP06_S2 (2006-burnt, Soutelo1 and Soutelo2); the three intervened
sites as DP05_A2 (Down slope Ploughed, Açores2), CP05_J1 (Contour
Ploughed, Jafafe1) and ST05_J2 (Slope Terraced — i.e. the terraces
were not constructed in perpendicular direction to the main slope
angle but at a considerable angle — Jafafe2). Judging by the remaining
eucalypt stumps, the ground preparation practices at all three sites
were carried out several years before the wildfire in 2005 but precise
estimates could not be obtained. Although logging immediately after
wildfire was commonly observed, only the UP06_S2 was logged during
the study period (in February 2007).

A general characterisation of the study sites was carried out as soon
as possible after their selection (Table 1). This involved a description of
terrain physiognomy, the assessment of fire severity using five simple in-
dices recorded at five points along a transect from the base to the top of
each slope, the description and sampling of two soil profiles at the base
and halfway each slope, and the laboratory analysis of these soil samples
with respect to bulk density (Porta et al., 2003), granulometric composi-
tion (Guitian and Carballas, 1976) and organic matter content (Botelho
da Costa, 2004). Wildfire severity was classified as moderate at all sites
due to the partial consumption of eucalypt canopies and shrub twigs,
the total consumption of the litter layer and the presence of black
ashes (Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). The soils at the two Açores sites
were identified in the field as Umbric Leptosols and those at the
remaining sites as Leptic Umbrisols (WRB, 2006). All soils were devel-
oped from pre-Ordovician schists of the Hesperic Massif (Ferreira and
de Brum, 1978; Pereira and FitzPatrick, 1995), and their upper 20 cm
had a coarse texture varying between sandy loam and clay loam, and a
high organic matter content ranging from 5 to 11%.

The climate at the study sites is Mediterranean with ocean influence,
and can be described as humid meso-thermal with prolonged dry and
warm summers (Köppen-Csb; DRA-Centro, 2001). The long-term
mean annual rainfall at the nearest rainfall station (Albergaria-a-Velha,
4 km north of the Açores sites; 1941–1991) was 1229 mm but annual
rainfall varied markedly from 750 to 2022 mm. The long-term mean
annual temperature at the nearest climate station (Estarreja, 17.5 km
north-east of the Açores sites; 1956–1977), with monthly mean tem-
peratures ranging from 8.8 °C in December to 19.1 °C in July. The rain-
fall during the study period was measured by installing at each study
location a tipping-bucket rainfall gauge (Pronamic Professional Rain
Gauge) linked to a Hobo Event Logger (Onset Corporation) as well as
one or more storage gauges for validation purposes.

2.2. Experimental design

The present experimental design differed from that of the bulk of
post-fire erosion studies employing field rainfall simulation experi-
ments (RSEs) in two respects, by repeating the RSEs at five or six oc-
casions on the same, permanent plots and by simultaneously carrying
out high- and extreme-intensity RSEs (45–50 vs. 80–85 mm h?1) on
adjacent, paired plots. At each study site, two pairs of permanent
plots were installed halfway in the lower and upper section of the
slope, and the two plots of each pair were randomly assigned the —
fixed — intensity to be applied throughout the study period. In the
case of the 2005-burnt sites, the permanent plots were installed dur-
ing the second and not the first campaign to allow for destructive soil
measurements and sampling within this first set of plots (immediate-
ly following the end of the RSEs). In addition to each pair of RSE plots,
a third plot with the same dimensions was used for measuring initial
soil conditions, with a special interest in topsoil water repellency.
Because of the destructive nature of these measurements, the control
plots were relocated between subsequent field campaigns but always
such that they were at similar distances to the two associated RSE
plots (generally at 3–5 m).

70 M.C. Malvar et al. / Catena 108 (2013) 69–83



In total, 10 field campaigns were carried out between September
2005 and July 2007 (Table 2). The six campaigns at the 2005-burnt
sites concerned the first two years after fire, whereas the six cam-
paigns at the 2006-burnt sites had to be limited to the first year
after fire (due to the project's end). At all study sites the first RSE
campaign was carried out within the first two months after the wild-
fire but marked differences in antecedent rainfall (30–120 mm) could
not be avoided (Fig. 1). From the total of 144 RSEs that were originally
foreseen, 12 could not be carried out due to occasional malfunctioning
of the extreme-intensity simulator in particular.

2.3. Rainfall simulation experiments

The RSEs were carried out with two portable rainfall simulators
following the design by Cerdà et al. (1997) and with modifications
by De Alba (1997), including a square plot of 0.28 m2. The high
(45–50 mm h?1) and extreme intensities (80–85 mm?1) were
obtained using two distinct nozzles, the HARDI-1553-10 and -14,
respectively. The two intensities were chosen to represent the maxi-
mum hourly rainfall at the Aveiro rainfall station for a 100-year re-
turn period and the maximum hourly rainfall ever recorded in
Portugal (Brandão et al., 2001). The two default nozzles and two
spare nozzles were (re-)calibrated in the laboratory before basically
every field campaign. This involved calibrating the rainfall intensity
as well as its homogeneity using a minimum threshold of 75% for the
Christiansen uniformity coefficient (Christiansen, 1941 in Stewart and
Howell, 2003).

In the field, the RSEs were performed according to a fixed protocol
(Shakesby et al., 2002). Prior to applying the artificial rain, the cover
of the plots was described by recording the presence–absence of var-
ious cover classes (stones, bare soil, litter, vegetation) in each of the
5 cm×5 cm cells of a 50 cm×60 cm grid laid out over the plot. The
simulations themselves involved the application of the selected in-
tensity during 1 h, the measurement of runoff at 1-minute intervals,
and collection of up to five runoff samples (one from the start of the
runoff until its approximate stabilization, one from the end of the
rainfall until the end of the runoff and three at the start, middle and
end of the remaining period). These runoff samples were then later
analysed in the laboratory using the classical evaporation method
(APHA, 1998) and the loss-on-ignition method (Botelho da Costa,
2004) to determine their sediment and organic matter concentra-
tions. Random roughness of the RSE plots was measured using a pin
profile meter and the PMPPROJ software (developed by J. Kilpelainen,
Agricultural Research Centre, Jokioinen, Finland). This was done at a
single occasion at the end of the RSE campaigns, and involved placing
the meter at three fixed positions within each RSE plot (at one, two
and three quarters along the plot's length).

2.4. Soil water repellency, moisture and resistance measurements

At five fixed points within the control plots, soil water repellency
was measured in situ at the soil surface as well as between 2–3 and
7–8 cm depth (see Keizer et al. (2008) for further details). This was
done using the “Molarity of Ethanol Droplet” (MED) test, as specified
in Doerr (1998) and slightly modified in our prior work (Keizer et al.

Fig. 1. Location of the three study sites and 4-day antecedent rainfall prior to the first rainfall simulation experiment at the six study sites (see Table 1 for site codes and Table 2 for
timing of first experiments).

(2005a, 2005b, 2008). Three droplets of increasing ethanol concen-
tration classes (decreasing surface tension) (0, 0%; 1, 1%; 3, 3%; 3,
5%; 4, 8.5%; 5, 13%; 6, 18%; 7, 24%; and 8, 36% or &gt;36%) were applied
to fresh parts of the soil until infiltration of at least two of three drop-
lets of the same concentration that occurred within 5 s. The median
ethanol concentration was then used as test result.

Following the repellency measurements, readings of volumetric
soil moisture content were made at the same five sampling points
and the two sampling depths (2–3 and 7–8 cm) using an ML2 Theta
Probe TM (Delta T-Devices Ltd.) inserted horizontally into the soil.
In the case of probe failure, a soil sample was collected and its mois-
ture content determined gravimetrically, as further detailed in Keizer
et al. (2008).

Prior to the repellency and moisture measurements, the resistance
of the soil surface to shear stress and penetration was measured at

the same five points within the plots, using a pocket vane tester and
a penetrometer.

2.5. Data analysis

Data analysis was carried out using the SAS 9.2 software package (SAS
Institute, Inc., 2008). Rank-based and non-parametric tests were pre-
ferred, also because of the small number of observations (Ott and
Longnecker, 2001). Testing focused on the differences between the two
rainfall intensities, the differences within and between the study sites,
and the differences between the successive field campaigns. The Mann–
Whitney U-test (MWU-t) and the Kruskal–Wallis test were used to assess
overall differences between two and more than two groups of obser-
vations, respectively. The Wilcoxon's signed-ranks test (WSR-T) was
employed to evaluate difference between paired observations or two

sets of repeated observations, and the Friedman test to compare three of
more sets of repeated observations. The Spearman rank correlation coef-
ficient (?) was used to explore the relationships of runoff and erosion
rates with soil cover and soil resistance.

3. Results

3.1. Overall runoff and inter-rill erosion rates

The hydrological and soil erosion response at the six study sites was
summarized for the six field campaigns together in Table 3. The high-
and extreme-intensity RSEs produced different rankings of the six euca-
lypt plantations in terms of overall runoff coefficients. The rankings
contrasted most pronouncedly for CP05_J1 and UP06_S2. At CP05_J1 the
overall runoff coefficient of the high-intensity RSEs was twice as high as
that of the extreme-intensity RSEs, whereas the opposite was true for
UP06_S2. If the risk of post-fire runoff generation at the different study
sites is evaluated using the maximum runoff coefficient of the two inten-
sities, the resulting ranking was surprising in two respects. First, the risk
was highest at the contour-ploughed CP05_J1 as well as at two of the
three unploughed sites (UP05_A1 and UP06_S2); second, the risk at the
third unploughed site (UP06_S1) was lowest.

Total soil and total organic matter losses at the micro-plot scale
depended strongly on overland flow generation (Fig. 2). For the entire
set of 24 micro-plots, both losses were significantly and strongly correlat-
ed with total runoff (Spearman rank correlation coefficient=0.92–0.94;
psb0.01). Correlation coefficients were similar when analysing the
high- and extreme-intensity RSEs separately (Fig. 2). Consequently, the
high- and extreme-intensity RSEs also did not produce entirely consistent
rankings of the six eucalypt plantation in terms of overall inter-rill erosion
rates. Likewise, erosion risk assessment based on the highest losses of the
two intensities was surprising in that the risk was clearly highest at two of
the three unploughed sites (UP05_A1 and UP06_S2) and, at the same
time, lowest at the third unploughed site (UP06_S1).

As suggested by the strong correlations between erosion and run-
off rates, the specific soil and organic matter losses revealed mostly
minor differences (Fig. 2). The bulk of the values ranged from 0.14
to 0.22 g of soil m?2 mm?1 runoff and from 0.08 to 0.13 g of organic
matter m?2 mm?1 runoff. Comparatively high specific losses were
produced by the extreme-intensity RSEs at the unploughed
UP05_A1 and UP06_S2 sites, which in part explained the high total
losses of these RSEs. In the case of the UP06_S2 site, these high values
were largely due to a roughly 10-fold increase in specific losses
following manual logging (with a chain saw) and mechanised wood
extraction. No such increase was observed for the high-intensity
RSEs at the UP06_S2 site.

3.2. Variation with rainfall intensity

The data set as a whole revealed that the high- and extreme-
intensity RSEs produced significantly different responses in runoff and
inter-rill erosion (Table 4). This was true for the individual RSEs as
well as for the average responses of the simultaneous RSEs. The signifi-
cant role of application rate was, however, location- and RSE campaign-
specific, as indicated by the fact that significant differences were
restricted to the Wilcoxon's signed ranks test. Thus, there was an overall
tendency for extreme-intensity RSEs to produce significantly larger
quantities of overland flow and significantly greater total as well as spe-
cific soil and organic matter losses than the high-intensity RSEs carried
out at the location (plot pair or study site) and same time.

The role of rainfall intensity was less straightforward at the level of
the individual study sites (Table 4; Fig. 3). Significant differences be-
tween the paired RSEs were basically limited to four of the six study
sites, i.e. the terraced and the three unploughed sites. In agreement
with the overall pattern for the entire data set, the extreme-intensity
RSEs produced significantly higher runoff and inter-rill erosion rates
than the high-intensity RSEs at UP05_A1, UP06_S2 and ST_05_J2. The op-
posite, however, was true at UP06_S01. From the two remaining sites,
CP05_J1 revealed a similar tendency as UP06_S1 whereas DP05_A2
lacked an apparent pattern, with its paired observations almost evenly
distributed above/below the 1:1 line or coinciding with it.

The unexpected and unclear differences at UP06_S1, CP05_J1 and
DP05_A2 were further explored by comparing the results for the two
plot pairs separately, both graphically (Fig. 4) and statistically (Wilcoxon's
signed-ranks test). In the case of the down slope ploughed DP05_A2 site,
the extreme-intensity RSEs produced significantly more runoff than the
high-intensity RSEs at the upper slope section but significantly less at
the lower slope section. Also one of the plot pairs at CP05_J1 as well
as at UP06_S1 revealed consistently lower runoff quantities for the
extreme- than high-intensity RSEs, while the other plot pair revealed at
least a tendency to the same effect. As illustrated in Fig. 4, consistent dif-
ferences between neighbouring plots were not limited to time-invariant
properties such as micro-topography but also included protective litter
and/or vegetation cover. This resulted from highly localized litter fall
from scorched tree canopies as well as the generally sparse recovery of
the spontaneous vegetation.

3.3. Spatial variability

3.3.1. Within-site variability
The RSEs did not tend to produce significantly different runoff and

inter-rill erosion responses at the two plots subjected to the same appli-
cation rates at each study site (Table 5). The extreme-intensity RSEs at
the down slope ploughed DP05_A2 and unploughed UP06_S2 sites

were an exception, with significant differences that were campaign-
specific as indicated by the Wilcoxon's signed-ranks test. In the case of
the down slope ploughed site (DP05_A2), the significant differences at
DP05_A2 were consistent with differences in protective vegetation
and especially litter cover throughout the six campaigns (Fig. 4).
Those at UP06_S1, however, lacked an obvious relationship with the
available plot data. For example, the runoff differences in May 2007
agreed with the differences in median levels of soil water repellency
(extreme-ethanol class 8 vs. strong-ethanol class 5) but the runoff dif-
ferences of the other campaigns did not.

3.3.2. Between-site variability
The same-intensity RSEs produced various significant runoff and ero-

sion differences amongst the 2005-burnt eucalypt plantations (Table 6).

Significant differences were more common for the individual RSEs
than for the sites' average responses, for runoff than soil and espe-
cially organic matter losses, and for total than specific soil losses.
Furthermore, many significant differences were strictly campaign-
specific as indicated by the discrepancies in the results of the
Wilcoxon's signed-ranks test and Mann–Whitney U-test. The significant
differences produced by the high-intensity RSEs coincided with those of
the extreme-intensity RSEs in three out of the six cases. In one of these
cases, however, the two application rates resulted in opposite differ-
ences. The high-intensity RSEs produced significantly more runoff and
greater soil losses at the contour-ploughed CP05_J1 site than at the
terraced ST05_J2, whereas the opposite was true for the extreme-
intensity RSEs (Fig. 5). The latter reflected the fact that one of the
extreme-intensity plots at CP05_J1 stood out for produced exceptionally

little runoff throughout the study period, possibly also due to the plot's
marked litter cover (Fig. 4).

Significant differences between the two 2006-burnt sites were
restricted to the extreme-intensity RSEs (Table 6). They were consistent
for the individual RSEs and their average responses, as well as consistent
throughout the first year after fire and not just campaign-specific. They
did, however, reflect somewhat deviant behaviour of the extreme-
intensity plots at UP06_S1. These plots mostly produced less runoff and
erosion than the paired high-intensity plots, due to factors unrelated to
vegetation-litter cover (Figs. 4, 5).

3.4. Temporal patterns

Runoff generation and inter-rill erosion at the 2005-burnt sites
varied significantly amongst the six field campaigns (Table 7). Signif-
icant variation existed in total as well as specific runoff and erosion
rates, for the individual RSEs as well as their site-wise mean values,
and in terms of overall differences (Kruskal–Wallis test) as well as
specific differences between repeated observations (Friedman test).
In the case of the 2006-burnt sites, however, significant differences
amongst the six campaigns were largely restricted to the erosion
rates, the individual RSEs and the repeated observations.

A sharp contrast between the 2005- and 2006-burnt study sites
was also evident from the test results for the pairs of consecutive

campaigns (Table 7). The 2005-burnt sites revealed significant overall
(Mann–Whitney U-test) as well as plot-specific (Wilcoxon's signed-
ranks test) differences in two instances and these differences
concerned basically all parameters. Runoff and erosion rates decreased
significantly from the 2nd to the 3rd campaign and increased signifi-
cantly from the 5th to the 6th campaign (Fig. 6). The 2006-burnt sites
also revealed the majority of significant differences in two instances
but these differences were plot-specific and especially concerned total
losses in soil and organic matter. The plots produced significantly small-
er losses in February 2007 than in both December 2006 and May 2007.
The increase in erosion rates between February and May 2007 was not
restricted to the site that was logged in that period (UP06_S2). Total
losses of soil and organic matter of the 132 RSEs were strongly correlat-
ed with runoff volumes (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient=
0.93–0.94; pb0.01). Further analysis of the above-mentioned signifi-
cant differences between consecutive campaigns therefore focussed
on overland flow generation and, in particular, on the role therein of
soil water repellency. Changes in water repellency at the 2005-burnt
sites agreed well with both the decrease in runoff between November
2005 and April 2006, and its increase between October 2006 and July
2007. This was true for changes in median repellency levels as well as
for changes in the frequency of extreme repellency (ethanol class&gt;7;
Fig. 7). The remarkably low runoff in July 2006, however, fitted in poorly
with the very strong median repellency level (ethanol class 7) but not

with the low frequency of extreme repellency (0–30%). In the case
of the 2006-burnt sites, the significant decrease in runoff between
December 2006 and February 2007 seemed unrelated to soil water
repellency since the median ethanol class was 0 at both occasions. The
subsequent increase in runoff, on the other hand, coincided with a pro-
nounced rise in repellency severity, both in terms of median ethanol
classes and frequency of extreme repellency.

The role of the three ground cover classes and the two soil erodibility
parameters was tested as well (Table 8). Runoff volumes and total
losses could be explained best by differences in litter cover in particular,
whereas specific losses were most closely associated to variations in re-
sistance to especially shear stress. Litter covers above 35–40% effectively
reduced inter-rill erosion rates (Fig. 8). Contrary to litter cover, ash
cover seemed to enhance overland flow generation and the associated
losses. The limited role of vegetation cover reflected a slow and spatially
heterogeneous post-fire recovery, as well-illustrated by the fact that
only 2 out of 24 plots had attained a vegetation cover of over 30% one
year after the wildfire.

4. Discussion

4.1. Overall runoff and inter-rill erosion rates

The observed runoff and inter-rill erosion rates suggested that
pre-fire ground preparation practices were not a key factor in post-
fire erosion risk. This not only applied in relation to down slope
ploughing, confirming the findings by Malvar et al. (2011), but also to
contour ploughing and the construction of sloping terraces. Specific
soil loss rates tended to vary little with either runoff volumes or the
two rainfall intensities, suggesting that inter-rill erosion at the six
study sites was by and large sediment-limited. Even so, the results at
the UP05_A1 and UP06_S2 sites indicated that extreme rainfall events
can provoke comparatively high specific soil losses at recently burnt eu-
calypt plantations with relatively undisturbed soil profiles and, suppos-
edly, greater sediment availability.

Comparison of the overall runoff and erosion rates of this study with
those of prior RSE studies was not straightforward, mainly because the

bulk of the prior studies concerned singular moments in time after fire. In
the case of Portugal, this was well illustrated by e.g. Coelho et al. (2004),
Ferreira et al. (2005a, 2005b), Leighton-Boyce et al. (2007) and Walsh et

al. (1998). The overall figures at the Jafafe and Soutelo sites did not differ
markedly from those at the Açores sites, confirming the principal points
that emerged from the comprehensive comparison with literature in
Malvar et al. (2011). They were that, while the observed runoff coeffi-
cients were comparable to those from prior RSE studies in recently
burnt areas, the specific soil losses were generally lower than those
reported earlier, particularly outside Portugal. The elevated organic mat-
ter content of the eroded sediments, especially compared to the topsoil,
was also confirmed by the Jafafe and Soutelo results. This preferential re-
moval of a mixture of partially combusted plant material, black ashes and
charcoal with soil organic matter, was not reported by existing RSE stud-
ies, as they typically seemed to lack information on organic matter losses.
Thomas et al. (1999) and Fernández et al. (2007), however, also found
high organic matter fractions (25–80%) in sediments eroded under natu-
ral rainfall conditions from recently burnt pine and eucalypt stands in
north-central Portugal and north-west Spain.

4.2. Effects of rainfall intensity

The two rainfall intensities applied in this study had noticeable effects
on runoff volumes and inter-rill sediment losses. These effects, however,
depended strongly on time-invariant plot- and site-specific properties as
well as on changes in soil conditions with time-since-fire. Overall, the
role of rainfall intensity was less well-defined at the two ploughed sites
than at the other four sites. This could involve a chance factor,
reflecting the increased spatial heterogeneity in micro-topographic
and/or topsoil characteristics produced by ploughing. Such a random
effect was most clearly suggested for the down slope ploughed site
(DP05_A2), as the two plot pairs revealed contrasting differences
between the two intensities.

Runoff and erosion rates have been found to increase with rainfall in-
tensity but not always in a simple manner or in a general sense (Arnaez
et al., 2007; Parsons and Stone, 2006; Tejada and Gonzalez, 2007). Thus,
although perhaps surprising, the present results were not extraordinary
in that the extreme-intensity RSEs produced significantly more overland
flow and erosion than the high-intensity RSEs at three study sites and, at
the same time, significantly less at another site. There was a tendency for
a clearer role of rainfall intensity on erosion than runoff rates, in agree-
ment with RSE studies comparing constant vs. variable application
rates s (Dunkerley, 2008; Frauenfeld and Truman, 2004; Parsons and
Stone, 2006; Truman et al., 2007).

The complex role of rainfall intensity could be due to an increase
in steady-state infiltration rate with increasing rainfall intensity, as

found by Hawkings (1982 in Paige et al., 2002) Flanagan and Nearing
(1995 in Paige et al., 2002) and Holden and Burt (2002). The authors
attributed such an increase to the phenomenon of “partial area con-
tribution”, in which higher rainfall intensities simply produce greater
fluxes of infiltration into those plot parts where infiltration capacities
exceed the simulated rainfall intensities. This phenomenon could be
especially relevant in water repellent soils in recently burnt areas.
The ponded hydraulic conductivity of a burnt forest in Australia
revealed a very pronounced spatial variability, due to the presence
of macro-pores in a soil matrix that was otherwise water repellent
(Nyman et al., 2010). Ferreira et al. (2005a) and Shakesby and Doerr
(2006) likewise stressed the importance of spatial patterns in infiltration
rates, particularly due to soil water repellency, for overland flow

generation in recently burnt areas. Possibly, technical limitations
might have confounded the role of rainfall intensity in at least
some of the paired experiments. The extreme-intensity nozzles
were more difficult to calibrate than the high-intensity nozzles,
especially in terms of the uniformity threshold and in spite of the
somewhat limited sensitivity of the Christiansen coefficient
(Lascelles et al., 2000). Furthermore, the extreme-intensity nozzles
were found to produce less constant soil moisture readings during
the field experiments than the high-intensity nozzles, suggesting
less constant extreme- than high-intensity application rates.

4.3. Within- and between-site spatial variability

Significant within-site differences between the plots subjected to the
same intensities were by and large limited to the extreme-intensity RSEs.
Apparently, the typically elevated spatial variability in soil erosion data
(e.g. Nearing et al., 1999; Sheridan et al., 2007) was masked by applying
45–50 mm h?1 as opposed to 80–85 mm h?1. The observed significant
within-site differences proved difficult to explain in terms of individ-
ual controlling factors, also because of changing plot characteristics
(e.g. vegetation and litter cover) and soil conditions (e.g. water

repellency) during the study period. Shakesby and Doerr (2006)
likewise argued that the role of soil water repellency in recently
burnt areas is difficult to untangle from that of other factors by
means of field studies.

The between-site differences sustained Malvar et al.'s (2011) find-
ing that pre-fire ground preparation operations lacked a clear impact
on post-fire runoff and inter-rill erosion rates. An obvious explanation
was that these operations had occurred sufficiently long ago for run-
off and erosion rates to return to the background levels of long
undisturbed forest stands. Shakesby et al. (1994) estimated that sed-
iment losses declined rapidly after rip-ploughing, which Walsh et al.
(1995) attributed to a rapid increase in soil erodibility through selec-
tive removal of the fine soil fraction by the initial erosion events.
These sediment losses after rip-ploughing were mainly due to
concentrated flow in down slope direction following the furrows.
Therefore, the small plot size employed here could help explain the
limited impact of ground preparation operations, especially in the
case of the down slope ploughed site (DP05_A2).

4.4. Temporal variability with time-since-fire

The timing of the RSEs had a prominent effect on the runoff and
inter-rill erosion rates. The joint analysis of the four sites burnt in

2005 agreed well with the analysis of two of them (UP05_A1/A2) in
Malvar et al. (2011). The contrasting temporal patterns at the
2006-burnt sites could be related to the timing of the RSEs and, in
particular, to the wetter antecedent rainfall conditions of the first
two campaigns in October and November 2006. The comparatively
minor temporal variation in runoff generation at the 2006-burnt
sites could furthermore help explain the lack of overall as opposed
to plot-specific differences. The shorter, 1- as opposed to 2-year
study period at the 2006-burnt sites seemed of little influence; none-
theless, the last two campaigns at the 2005-burnt sites contributed
markedly to the significant differences amongst their six campaigns.

In agreement with the two prior studies that also employed
repeated RSEs to study post-fire runoff and erosion (Cerdà and
Doerr, 2005; Sheridan et al., 2007), the temporal patterns in over-
land flow generation could not be easily attributed to changes in
topsoil water repellency alone. This might be due to the fact that
the soil water repellency measurements were destructive and, thus,
were not carried out in the RSE plots themselves but in neighbouring
plots. On the other hand, descriptors such as median ethanol class
or its range might not fully capture the hydrological implications
of soil water repellency, especially under heterogeneous repellency
conditions.

The temporal patterns in inter-rill erosion rates with time-since-fire
were less straightforward than the pronounced decreases reported by
Sheridan et al. (2007) and especially Cerdà and Doerr (2005). Thus,
the eucalypt plantations studied here did not reveal the marked transi-
tion from transport- to sediment-limited erosion typically reported by
post-fire erosion studies, including under natural rainfall conditions
(see Shakesby, 2011; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). On the other hand,
the present soil loss figures did agree well with the tendency for low
erosion rates in the Mediterranean region due to its long land-use histo-
ry (Shakesby, 2011). The elevated surface stone cover that emerged as
the ash layer was removed from the study sites together with the most-
ly shallow soil depth fitted in with an intensive use of the study sites in
the past.

Although post-fire forestry operations and in particular logging
were commonly observed in the study areas, they only took place at
one of the six study sites. After logging and wood extraction, three
of the four plots of the UP06_S2 site revealed an increased runoff
and inter-rill erosion. This logging effect could be attributed to a
marked decrease in litter cover at all three plots. The litter cover
also decreased at the fourth, “exceptional” plot but this was “compen-
sated” by an exceptional increase in vegetation cover, attaining 70%.
These results fitted in well with the findings of Fernández et al.
(2007) that logging operations did not seriously affect soil erosion,
except where they resulted in significant exposure of bare soil.

5. Conclusions

The principal conclusions of this study into post-fire runoff and
inter-rill erosion in six recently burnt eucalypt plantations in north-
central Portugal by means of repeated, high and extreme-intensity
field rainfall simulation experiments (RSEs) were as follows:

(i) Erosion rates depended strongly on runoff volumes but
seemed essentially sediment-limited. Namely, sediment losses
were markedly lower than in prior RSE studies in the study
region but especially outside Portugal, and did not reveal the
commonly observed, sharp decrease with time-since-fire;

(ii) Mechanical ground preparation operations carried out several
years before the latest wildfire did not have major impacts on
post-fire runoff and erosion rates. There were no striking differ-
ences between the three practices, despite contour-ploughing
and terracing being commonly regarded as soil conservation
techniques as opposed to ploughing in down slope direction.
Furthermore, the terraced and the two ploughed plantations

revealed intermediate sediment losses compared to the three
unploughed plantations;

(iii) Unlike the pre-fire practices, post-fire logging and wood extrac-
tion seemed to increase sediment losses substantially. However,
further work on the effect of logging is needed as the present ev-
idence was based on a single study site;

(iv) There was an overall tendency for extreme-intensity RSEs
(80–85 mm h?1) to produce significantly more runoff and great-
er soil and organic matter losses than their paired high-intensity
RSEs (45–50 mm h?1). Nonetheless, the role of rainfall intensity
was unexpected in that it differed markedly amongst the six study
sites as well as between the two plot pairs at some sites. This and
especially the lack of obvious explanations for the deviant results
seriously hampered a consistent ranking of the six study sites in
terms of post-fire erosion risk.

Abstract 

Increases in runoff and erosion have been reported during the first post-fire year in 

eucalypt plantations of north-central Portugal, but little information is available about 

the effect of slightly longer time intervals as well as pre-fire management practices. 

Eight micro-plots (0.28 m2) were installed at two adjacent eucalypt stands representing 

typical management activities in the region, i.e. unploughed vs. down-slope rip-

ploughed several years before the 2005-fire studied here, and runoff and erosion 

measured weekly during two post-fire years. In order to assess some key factors 

controlling the hydrological and erosive response, an intensive monitoring (two-weekly) 

of selected soil properties was carried out.  

Rainfall was 35% higher during the second than first year following the fire, but the 

runoff coefficient was around 20% for both sites and study years. By contrast, overall 

sediment losses differed significantly between the unploughed and the ploughed site 

during the first post-fire year (415 vs. 125 g m-2 year-1), and even more during the 

second one (515 vs. 54 g m-2 year-1). The organic matter fraction of the eroded 

sediment amounted to ca. 50 % throughout the study period. Time since fire played a 

role in runoff and erosion; however, post-fire runoff and erosion did not decrease 

gradually in the course of the study but revealed a marked seasonal component, with 

clear peaks surrounding the driest seasons.  

Runoff generation could be explained best by rainfall amount or maximum rainfall 

intensity during fifteen minutes (I15) and then by surface cover and soil water 

repellency. Maximum rainfall intensity substituted rainfall amount as main factor when a 

protective surface cover was attained or when soils were wettable. The sediment 

losses were explained best by I15 followed by surface cover. 



82 
 

Post-fire runoff and erosion at the study sites was also studied by repeated rainfall 

simulation experiences (RSE’s). Comparison of the results obtained under natural and 

simulated rainfall suggested that the RSE’s captured well the specific sediment loss 

rates, the organic matter contents of the eroded sediments, and erosion rates 

differences between sites. The important role of soil water repellency in post-fire runoff 

generation in eucalypt stands was also evident from both methodologies

1. Introduction 

In Portugal, the introduction of flammable tree species (pine and eucalypt 

plantations), together with a decline in traditional practices (grazing, coppicing, etc) 

generated a fire prone forest formation, which begun to suffer an increase in wildfire 

frequency since the 1980s (Shakesby et al., 1996). Furthermore, the frequency of 

forest fires is expected to remain the same or increase in the future (Pereira et al., 

2006). Especially since the severe fire seasons of 2003 and 2005 (during both of which 

over 300.000 ha burnt; AFN, 2011), forest fires are now an important public concern in 

Portugal (Ferreira et al., 2008).  

Wildfires constitute a disturbance with a relatively severe but temporary impact 

(Cerdà and Doerr, 2005). Fires can reduce soil infiltration capacity and, consequently, 

increase runoff and erosion (Spigel and Robichaud, 2007; Cerdà and Robichaud, 2009; 

Scott et al., 2009), thereby provoking on-site land degradation impacts such as soil 

fertility losses (Thomas et al., 1999; Verheijen et al., 2009), soil organic matter/carbon 

losses (Spigel and Robichaud, 2007; Prats et al., 2012) as well as downstream 

pollution with, for example, pyrolitic toxic compounds (Vila-Escalé et al., 2007; Campos 

et al. 2012).  

Large increases in runoff and erosion following wildfires have also been reported 

for the two principal forest types in north-central Portugal, i.e. maritime pine and 

eucalypt plantations (e.g. Shakesby et al., 1994; Ferreira et al., 1997; Coelho et al., 

2004). These prior studies commonly observed a pronounced temporal variability in 

post-fire runoff and erosion, associated to inter and intra-annual rainfall variability as 

well as post-fire vegetation recovery (Shakesby et al., 1993; 1994, 1996). An important 

role in the seasonal variations in erosion has frequently been attributed to soil water 



83 
 

repellency (Ferreira et al., 2000; Coelho et al., 2004; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007; 

Malvar et al., 2011; Prats et al., 2012). This is especially the case for the eucalypt 

plantations in this region, as both long unburnt and recently burnt stands are typically 

associated with very high to extreme hydrophobicity (e.g. Doerr et al. 1998, 2003, 

2006; Keizer et al., 2005a, 2005b; 2008; Malvar et al., 2011; Prats et al., 2012). These 

factors limit the establishments of links between post-fire disturbances and enhanced 

runoff and erosions rates. 

The most commonly-used techniques to quantify post-fire runoff and erosion are 

rainfall simulation experiments (RSE’s) (e.g. Sevink et al., 1989; Imeson et al., 1992; 

Kutiel et al., 1995; Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald, 2001; Johansen et al., 2001; 

Cerdà and Doerr, 2005; Coelho et al., 2005; Ferreira et al., 2005a; Rulli et al., 2006; 

Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007; Sheridan et al., 2007) and runoff-erosion plots of various 

dimensions (e. g. Blong et al. 1982; Díaz -Fierros et al.1987; Soto et al. 1994; 

Shakesby et al. 1996; Soto and Díaz-Fierros, 1998; Ferreira et al., 2000; Dragovich 

and Morris, 2002). RSE’s have the advantages of producing repeatable rainfall events 

and, and being more time and cost-effective but, at the same time, have the 

disadvantage of producing artificial rainfall events that, in general, have a constant 

intensity, a low kinetic energy and fall onto small surface areas (e.g. Rickson, 2001). 

The representativeness of RSE results for post-fire runoff and erosion under natural 

rainfall condition constitutes an important research gap, since few studies have made a 

comprehensive comparison of RSE- vs. plot-based runoff and erosion values. To 

address this knowledge gap, the present, plot-based study concerns the same two 

sites as where Malvar et al. (2011) carried out RSE’s at six occasions during the first 

two years after a wildfire.  

The main goal of this research was to assess the role of management practices in 

post-fire runoff and erosion in eucalyptus plantations in north-central Portugal. To this 

end, overland flow generation and the associated losses of soil and organic matter 

were compared for two contrasting eucalypt plantations, one of which had been 

ploughed before the wildfire whereas the other had not. This was done using micro-

plots of the same dimensions as those used by Malvar et al. (2011) for repeated RSE’s 

at the same two sites. The specific objectives of this study were to: (i) determine the 

between-site variability in runoff and erosion; (ii) assess the temporal patterns in runoff 

and erosion with time since fire; (iii) identify the key factors explaining the spatial and 

temporal runoff and erosion patterns; (iv) compare the runoff and erosion rates 



84 
 

produced under natural rainfall conditions with those produced by artificial events of 

high and extreme intensity (45-50 vs. 80-85 mm h-1). 

 

2. Materials and methods  

2.1 Study sites 

This study was conducted near the Açores locality of the Albergaria-a-Velha 

municipality, north-central Portugal, in an area that was burned by a wildfire during 

early July 2005. Two adjacent commercial eucalypt (Eucalyptus globulus Ait.) 

plantations were selected for their contrasting pre-fire land management practices, both 

which are commonly found in the study region. At the “unploughed” site, trees had 

been planted without mechanical ground operations, so that the soil profile was 

undisturbed. At the “rip-ploughed” site, a clear pattern of ridges and furrows (up to 20 

cm high) running down the slope was present. Judging by the remaining tree stumps, 

both study sites had undergone at least two eucalypt regrowth cycles prior to the 2005-

fire. Both sites has steep slopes but were relatively short, due to extensive network of 

paths in the area (Table 1). The 2005-fire had burnt the two sites with moderate 

severity, according to simple field indicators such as the consumption of tree canopies, 

the undergrowth and litter layer as well as the colour of the ashes (Shakesby and 

Doerr, 2006; Table 1). The soils at both sites were described by digging two soil 

profiles (at the base and halfway the slope) and collecting various samples. The soil 

samples collected at 0-5 cm depth were analysed in the laboratory with respect to bulk 

density (Porta et al., 2003), soil texture (Guitian and Carballas, 1976) and organic 

matter content (Botelho da Costa, 2004). The soil profiles corresponded to Umbric 

Leptosols (WRB, 2006) that were developed from pre-Ordovician schists of the 

Hesperic Massif (Ferreira and de Brum, 1978; Pereira and FitzPatrick, 1995). The top 5 

cm of the soils had a coarse texture, varying between sandy clay loam to clay loam, 

with an organic matter content of 10% (Table 1). 

The climate at the study sites is Mediterranean and has an oceanic influence. It 

can be classified as humid meso-thermal with prolonged dry and warm summers (Csb, 

according to Köppen; DRA-Centro, 2001). The long-term mean annual temperature at 

the nearest climate station (“Estarreja”, 17.5 km north-west of the study sites)was 13.9 

ºC, with monthly mean temperatures ranging from 8.8 °C in December to 19.1 °C in 

July (reference: 1956-1977). The long-term mean annual rainfall at the nearest rainfall 



85 
 

station (“Albergaria-a-Velha”, 4 km north of the study sites) was 1229 mm but annual 

rainfall varied markedly from 750 to 2022 mm (reference: 1941-1991).  

 

2.2 Experimental design 

Each site was instrumented with two pairs of square micro-plots (0.28 m2) installed 

halfway in the lower and upper sections of the slope. Erosion episodes from a few 

rainfall events (up to 80 mm) occurred between the fire and the installation of the plots. 

Afterwards, during a period of 22 months, including 83 field trips, data was collected on 

runoff, soil erosion and several explanatory variables. 

Rainfall was measured with a tipping-bucket rainfall gauge (Pronamic Professional 

Rain Gauge, Ringkøbing, Denmark). Surface runoff was accumulated and measured in 

tanks, weekly 1.5 l runoff samples were taken for laboratory determinations, which 

included sediments concentration, following the classical evaporation method (APHA, 

1998) and organic matter fraction on the eroded sediments following the loss-on-

ignition method (Botelho da Costa, 2004). Plot surface cover was described every two 

weeks by recording the presence–absence of five cover categories in each of the 5 cm 

× 5 cm cells of a grid (50 cm x 60 cm) laid out over the plot. The described cover 

categories were: stones (including rock outcrop and stones higher than 2 mm 

diameter), bare soil, litter (including all dead plant materials such as leaves, bark, 

stems, etc.), vegetation and ashes. Every two weeks, one transect of five (or three, 

from June 2006 onwards) equidistant sampling points along the slope length was 

selected to measure several soil properties. At each sampling point, the resistance of 

the soil surface to shear stress and penetration was measured three times using a 

pocket vane tester and a penetrometer. At the same spot, three soil water repellency 

(SWR) measurements were done in situ at the soil surface and between 2–3 and 7–8 

cm depth. This was done using the “Molarity of Ethanol Droplet” (MED) test (Doerr 

(1998), Keizer et al. 2005a, 2005b, 2008). Three droplets of increasing ethanol 

concentration classes (decreasing surface tension) (0, 0%; 1, 1%; 2, 3%; 3, 5%; 4, 

8.5%; 5, 13%; 6, 18%; 7, 24%; and 8, 36% or &gt;36%) were applied to undisturbed parts 

of the soil until infiltration of at least two of three droplets of the same concentration had 

occurred within 5 s. Following the repellency measurements, at the same sampling 

points and depths, readings of volumetric soil moisture content were done (ML2 Theta 

Probe TM; Delta T-Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK), (see Keizer et al. (2008) for further 

details). The random roughness of the plots was also determined, using a pin profile 



86 
 

meter. This was done by placing the device at three fixed positions within each plot (at 

one, two and three quarters along the plot's length) (Table 1). 

 

2.3 Data analysis 

Rainfall amount, maximum rainfall intensity in 15 minutes (I15), rainfall kinetic 

energy (KE), erosivity (R) (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978), and total event intensity were 

calculated on rainfall event basis. Events were separated by periods of at least 6 h with 

no precipitation. When multiple rainfall events occurred in a period between the weekly 

runoff and erosion measurements, total rainfall amount and erosivity, maximum I15, 

maximum KE and maximum of total event intensity were the rainfall characteristics 

associated to the measured runoff and sediment. SWR measurements in ethanol class, 

at soil surface and 2-3 cm depth, were used to calculate the median ethanol 

concentration, the frequency of strong (SWR&gt; 5 ethanol class; Freq5), very strong 

(SWR&gt; 6 ethanol class) and extreme repellency (SWR&gt; 7 ethanol class).  

Data analysis was carried out using the SAS 9.2 software package (SAS Institute, 

Inc., 2008). The significance level for all the statistical tests was 0.05. Repeated 

measures analysis (ANOVA-2 way) was performed in order to determine the site and 

time influence on runoff and erosion measurements, with the plot as subject of 

repeated measured. The time factors tested were the annual and monthly values. 

When the overall effect was significant, a post-hoc LS-Means adjusted Tukey’s test 

was used to assess in which periods the sites produced significantly different runoff 

and erosion values (Littel et al., 2006). In order to fit the normality assumption, the total 

runoff was log-transformed and square root transformation was used for the runoff 

coefficient, the erosion variables were fourth root transformed and the organic matter 

content was not transformed. The variance-covariance structure for the dependent 

variables was selected according to the smaller -2 restricted log likelihood (Littel et al., 

2006). 

Forward stepwise regression analysis was used to determine the influence on the 

weekly runoff and erosion measurements of the following 16 explanatory variables: (i) 

Related with rainfall: rainfall amount, rainfall Kinetic energy, erosivity, I15, event 

intensity and antecedent rainfall; (ii) Related with soil water repellency: frequency of 

strong, very strong and extreme repellency; (iii) Related with soil: soil moisture, soil 

resistance to shear stress and penetration; (iv) Related with plot: position (top, bottom), 

slope angle, plot roughness and plot surface cover (ash, bare, litter, stone, vegetation). 

Collinearity diagnostics was used to determine the explanatory variables which were 



87 
 

related, removing those with condition index higher than 10 (Belsley et al., 1980). To 

better achieve the normality of the model residuals, periods with rainfall less than 10 

mm and therefore runoff less than 4 mm were removed. 

The differences between sites of the explanatory variables, including plot basis 

(surface cover) and transect basis measurements (soil moisture, soil water repellency 

and soil resistance), were tested through Mann-Whitney U-test (MWU-t) and 

Wilcoxon’s signed-ranks test (WSR-T). 

 

3. Results 

3.1 Annual rainfall, runoff and erosion rates. 

Table 2 summarizes the annual rainfall, runoff and erosion rates measured in the 

micro-plots. Rainfall volume was 35% higher during the second than from the first study 

year (1048 vs. 1608 mm). Compared to the long-term mean annual rainfall (1229 mm), 

the rainfall amount on the first post-fire year was 15% lower whereas on the second 

year it was 30% above. I15 was also higher during the second year, and consequently, 

the rainfall erosivity of the second study year was twice that of the first one (3115 vs. 

1412 MJ mm ha-1 h-1).  

Following the increase in rainfall amount, the average runoff amount also increased 

from year 1 (228 mm) to year 2 (368 mm, 40% increase), but this was more 

pronounced in the case of the unploughed site (426 mm, 47% increase) when 

compared to the ploughed site (310 mm, 26% increase). The analysis of variance 

(Table 2) revealed that there was a significant difference in runoff between the two 

post-fire years (F=8.84; p&lt;0.05), but not between the two sites (F=5.40; p&gt;0.05). 

However, year-to-year differences were only significant in terms of runoff amount. In 

fact, the runoff coefficient was about 20% for both sites and post-fire years. Opposite 

from the runoff results, erosion variables did not follow variations in annual rainfall. 

Sediment losses were equal for post-fire year 1 and 2 (averaging 270 vs. 284 g m-2), 

while specific sediment losses were significantly higher in year 1 than year 2 

(averaging 1.18 vs. 0.68 g m-2 mm-1 runoff). Despite the similar runoff patterns between 

sites, there was a strong site effect on the erosion response (Table 2). The sediment 

losses as well as specific rates were significantly higher in the unploughed than in the 

ploughed site, probably due to lower sediment availability at the ploughed site. 

However, time (annual) effect over erosion was not consistent between sites and also 

between total and specific sediment rates. The sediment losses increased from the first 



88 
 

year to the second in the unploughed site but decreased in the ploughed site. This also 

led to an increase in the differences in sediment losses between sites with time. 

Nevertheless, lower sediment availability on the second year was indicated by a 

significantly reduction in specific sediment rate for both sites. Finally, the organic matter 

fraction was roughly half of the eroded sediments, with an increasing trend with year 

since fire but no significant differences between sites. 

The annual runoff and erosion values by plot pointed out that erosion was rather 

sediment than transported limited, as sediment transport did not simple increased with 

runoff amounts, especially on the second year (Figure 1). In the unploughed site, both 

runoff and sediment losses increased similarly for all the plots between year 1 and 2 

(Figure 1a). In the ploughed site, runoff increased from year 1 to year 2 in all the plots 

but decreased in plot 8, whereas sediment losses decreased in all but plot 6. Despite 

these inconsistent plot patterns, the specific sediment losses invariably decreased 

between year 1 and 2 (Figure 1b).  

The plot variability within-site in terms of runoff, but mainly in the erosion response 

was consistently higher in the first than in the second post-fire year, and in the 

ploughed compared to the unploughed site (coefficient of variation of sediment losses 

87 and 19% respectively). Probably as consequence of the increasing in specific-plot 

characteristics variability by the ploughing (see Table 1). 

 

3.2 Temporal patterns  

3.2.1. Temporal patterns of surface cover, soil water repellency and soil moisture 

The surface cover evolved following the washing up of the ashes, the subsequent 

exposure of a stone lag, and the development of a vegetation and litter. Ash cover 

decreased as the other categories increased (Figure 2). Besides these similarities, 

there were differences between sites. Litter fall from burned eucalypt trees and 

vegetation regrowth was lower in the unploughed compared to the ploughed site. 

Conversely, stone cover was higher in the unploughed site. Those differences were 

statistically significant globally (MW U-test) and also temporally specific (Wilcoxon’s S–

R test) (Table 3). For example one year after the fire, the mean litter plus vegetation 

cover in the unploughed site was 25% whereas in the ploughed site was 50%. At the 

same time, stone cover in the unploughed site was about 40% and 18% in the 

ploughed site. Additionally, bare soil was lower than 5% for both sites during all the 

study period. Furthermore, the within-site variability of plot surface cover also increased 

progressively with time since fire, as surface cover evolved. 



89 
 

In both sites, the overall soil water repellency of the near surface measurements 

was dominated throughout the 22 months post-fire study period by a very strong 

severity level (median ethanol class 7; depth 2-3 cm). Consequently, the median 

frequency of strong soil water repellency (SWR &gt; 5 ethanol class) was around 65%. At 

the same time, the volumetric soil moisture medians were also similar (7% at 2-3 cm 

depth). Although overall soil moisture and water repellency levels were the same for 

both sites, spatial variability between sites occurred, but it was irregular in time and 

poorly related to overall values. In spite of the overall predominance of very strong 

repellency levels, non-repellent conditions also occurred, mainly after rainfall periods, 

when higher soil moisture was also recorded (Figure 3). During the first post-fire year, 

the ploughed site registered more frequent hydrophobic conditions than the 

unploughed site (percentile 25 was 6 vs. 3 ethanol class, respectively). However, 

during the second post-fire year, the ploughed site registered less hydrophobic 

conditions than the unploughed (percentile 25 was 0 vs. 4 ethanol class, respectively). 

Hence, statistically significant differences between the sites’ soil water repellency 

variables were not found, besides some caution is required in the Wilcoxon’s S–R test 

results analysis because the sites’ sampling dates were not the same (Table 3). 

 

 

3.2.2. Temporal patterns of rainfall, runoff and erosion rates 

Over the 22 months there were registered 254 rainfall events monitored in 72 

weekly periods. Those events produced runoff in 65 weeks and sediments in 54 weeks 

at the unploughed site, whereas at the ploughed site they produced 59 weeks with 

runoff and 48 with sediments.  

Rainfall amount and intensity presented a marked seasonal component in both 

studied years. Even so, rainfall amount, intensity and their seasonal and monthly 

variations were higher in the second year (Figure 4a), especially during the autumn 

where the highest rainfall volumes (around 300 mm per month) were measured and the 

I15 increased from the common maximum value of about 20 mm h
-1 until 40-70 mm h-1.  

Time since fire (month) was a significant factor for all the studied variables whereas 

site differences were significant for all variables but organic matter fraction (Table 4). 

However, the runoff variables were more affected by time, whereas the erosion 

variables showed a stronger site effect judging by the highest F values. Still, the 

significant interaction (site*month since fire) indicated that the site differences on runoff 

and erosion were not significant for all the months. The temporal trend in runoff and 



90 
 

sediment production was not a simple decline with time since fire. Both runoff and 

erosion registered a high seasonal and monthly variation, with several peaks observed 

one and two years after the fire related with rainfall variations and SWR conditions 

(Figure 4 and Figure 5). Following the highest rainfall amounts, runoff amount was 

higher also during both autumn seasons. Similarly, runoff coefficient peaks were higher 

in the first autumn but not during the second autumn. On the other hand, in the first 

summer high runoff coefficient peaks occurred with low rainfall and runoff amount. 

These discrepancies between the peaks reached by runoff amount and coefficient 

coincided with extreme rainfall conditions (high and low), and therefore with either very 

strong soil water repellency or non repellent situations. During the wetter second 

autumn, the high rainfall amount (897 mm) generated a high total overland flow 

(averaging 130 mm) but the percentage converted to runoff (14%) was no higher than 

in other periods. In contrast, in the driest months of the first summer, rainfall (60 mm) 

and runoff amount (averaging 25 mm) were the lowest measured but the runoff 

coefficient (45%) was higher than in the other periods. The SWR effect was also 

evident during the first rainfall storms after dry periods, when soil moisture was about 

5% (see Figure 3). The highest monthly runoff coefficient (50-60%) of October-05, 

September-06 and June-07 coincided with mean extreme soil water repellency level (8 

ethanol class) and frequency of strong soil water repellency between 70-100%.  

Additionally, significant differences in overland flow generation between sites 

coincided with differences between sites in soil water repellency levels. The analysis 

with LS-means differences, identified the runoff response in the unploughed site 

significantly higher mainly during the second winter and spring (from January 2007 

throughout May 2007; Figure 4). At the same time, over that period, median repellency 

levels and the frequency of strong soil water repellency were higher in unploughed site 

even when the soil moisture was lower (see Figure 3). 

Total as well as specific sediment losses were significantly higher at the unploughed 

compared to the ploughed site, except for a small period  when the erosion was low 

and therefore the differences between sites were not significant (Table 4; LS-means, 

Figure 5). Both erosion variables were significantly affected by time since fire, but not in 

a unique way. On one hand, the time effect was greater for absolute values than for 

specific rates (Table 4). On the other hand, sediment rates peaks were a follow-up of 

runoff generation whereas in the case of specific sediment rate, they also coincided 

with runoff coefficient peaks in the dry seasons as in the first summer.  Although annual 

specific sediment losses indicated a significantly reduction in specific rates from the 



91 
 

first to the second year in both sites, the monthly values showed that peaks as high as 

in the first post-fire autumn happened in the second autumn (Figure 5). 

 

3.3 Relationship of runoff and erosion with key explanatory variables: 

The multiple regression model results revealed that the set of used independent 

variables accounted for 50% of variation in (log-transformed) runoff generation (Table 

5). Rainfall amount was the main factor explaining 27% variation, the influence of SWR 

was reflected in the importance of the frequency of strong soil water repellency variable 

(Freq5; explaining 10% of runoff variation) and in the negative sign of the antecedent 

rainfall parameter estimate. The water retention capacity of litter and ash cover 

variables was represented by their negative parameter estimates and explained around 

10% of runoff variation. The ploughed site regression analysis exhibited different 

covariates compared to the general and the unploughed site model, showing I15 as the 

main factor explaining 28% of runoff variation. Also in this site, the soil water repellency 

influence was slightly higher than in the unploughed site (12% vs. 7%), (Table 5). The 

differences in ground cover between sites were reflected in the site specific models; 

while the ash cover influence was higher in the unploughed site, the litter effect was 

only visible in the ploughed site. 

The I15 followed for cover related variables accounted for 30-50% variation in 

(fourth root) sediment losses (Table 5). Ground cover differences between sites were 

represented by the different importance of I15 and the cover related variables in the 

sites specific model. The lower model performance at the ploughed compared to the 

unploughed site (R2 0.45 vs. 0.57) may have caused by higher within-site variability on 

erosion rates, lower rates and a worse relationship between sediment losses and I15 at 

the ploughed site (Figure 6a). In both sites, plots summing more than 70% of litter and 

vegetation cover hardly had high sediment rates (Figure 6b). The relationship of 

sediment losses with runoff generation was represented by the effect of some runoff 

related variables as soil moisture and Freq5. The effect of hydrophobicity in the 

ploughed site was higher and represented by the influence of Freq5 (13%) on the 

sediment losses variation.  

Since the Freq5 was a variable present in the runoff and sediment regression 

models, the data was divided in categories according to its frequency 

(SWR1=Freq5?32; SWR2=32&lt;Freq5&lt;66; SWR3= Freq5?66). The regression analysis 

was done for those categories individually to better evaluate the soil water repellency 

influence (Table 5). A shift in the first variable to explain runoff generation from I15 to 



92 
 

rainfall amount was detected as the soil water repellency increased. So, in the lowest 

soil water repellency category, I15 was the main factor explaining 35% of runoff 

variation. For the most repellent conditions, rainfall amount explained 45% and 27% of 

runoff generation. At the same time, the influence of the cover variables with retention 

capacity (litter + ash) diminished with the increase in soil water repellency conditions.  

 

4. Discussion 

4.1. Overall runoff and erosion rates 

Relatively few reports exist concerning post-fire runoff and inter-rill erosion in 

commercial eucalypt plantations. Comparison of this study results with other research 

in Portugal revealed that the first post-fire year runoff (22%) was similar to that of Prats 

et al. (2012) (30%), both of which were higher than the range registered by Shakesby 

et al. (1996) (4-16%). In terms of specific rates, the unploughed site rate (0.4 g m-2mm-1 

rain) was similar to the one recorded by Prats et al. (2012) (0.33 g m-2mm-1 rain), both 

of which were comparable to the maximum values recorded by Shakesby et al. (1996) 

(0.07-0.34 g m-2mm-1 rain), while the ploughed site rate (0.12 g m-2mm-1 rain) was 

comparable to their minimum values. The lower rainfall amounts in Shakesby et al. 

(1996) (645 mm), compared to Prats et al. (2012) (1684 mm) and this study (1048 mm) 

are probable related with those differences between studies. Also the latter studies 

used bigger plots (16m2) and generally, a reduction in runoff and erosion is expected 

as the contributing area increases (Le Bissonais et al., 1998; Bagarello and Ferro, 

2004; Boix-Fayos et al., 2006). However, a different trend can be detected depending 

on the processes involved. The similarity of runoff and erosion data between the 

present study and those of Shakesby et al. (1996) but specially those of Prats et al. 

(2012) suggested that inter-rill erosion was the main process in all of the three studies. 

Blong et al. (1982) and Dragovich and Morris (2002) carried out plot studies (8 m2) in 

recently burnt eucalypt forest in Australia. They found specific sediment losses of 0.33 

to 1.08 g m-2mm-1 rain. Only the highest sediment losses at the unploughed site (0.4 g 

m-2mm-1 rain) can be compared to their minimum rates. 

Runoff and erosion values at the unploughed site can be compared with other 

reported values for burnt eucalypt stands in the region, however when comparing with 

reported values outside Portugal the erosion figures only compare with the minimum 

values. The adjacent ploughed site presented comparable runoff amounts but lower 

sediment losses. Rip-ploughing (down-slope or contour) let the soil in a vulnerable 



93 
 

condition and a few storms can easily cause severe soil losses (Verheijen et al., 2009). 

In fact, in a recently rip-ploughed eucalypt site, Shakesby et al. (1994) found specific 

sediment losses as high as 3.27 g m-2 mm-1 rain. Then, the erodibility should decrease 

gradually after the first events through selective removal of the fine soil fraction by 

initial erosive events, the formation of a protective stone lag, and the subsequent 

development of vegetation and litter cover (Shakesby et al., 1994; Walsh et al., 1995). 

The low sediment availability in the ploughed site of the present study, can be 

explained by the time elapsed since ploughing (as much as 20 years or 2 eucalypt 

production cycles). At the same time, the low post-fire disturbance erosion figures 

indicate sediment exhaustion, at least of the finer particles than can be transported by 

inter-rill erosion at micro-plot scale. In commercial eucalypt stands, ground preparation 

involving uprooting the old stumps occurred at least every 30-40 years (3-4 eucalypt 

cycles) (Shakesby et al., 1996) and, in recent times, it is often done after fires. Since 

ground preparation usually involves rip-ploughing and even terracing, sediment 

exhaustion at the ploughed site clearly shows the consequences and the threat for soil 

conservation of this type of management. On the other hand, Mediterranean erosion 

rates are generally lower than those in other areas; this is mainly attributed to the high 

soil stoniness, shallow soils and long intensive land use (Cerdan et al., 2010; Shakesby 

2011). The lower erosion rates do not necessarily mean that erosion is a lesser threat 

for the soil resource, as the soil is already thin and therefore any additional loss may be 

considered detrimental (Cerdan et al., 2010). Additionally, the systematically high 

organic matter fraction on the eroded sediments (40-50%) founded in the area 

(Thomas et al., 1999; Malvar et al., 2011; Malvar et al., 2011; Prats et al., 2012) 

indicates a loss of soil organic matter which may affect soil fertility (Thomas et al., 

1999) as well as caused off-site pollution (Spigel and Robichaud 2007; Vila-Escalé et 

al., 2007; Campos et al. 2010). 

 

4.2. Key factors on hydrological and soil erosion response and its temporal 

variation 

Rainfall amount was the main factor explaining runoff generation, followed with 

equal importance by the ash plus litter cover and the frequency of strong soil water 

repellency. The same factors were described by Prats et al., (2012) for untreated 

(eucalypt + pine) plots. A shift in the first descriptor from rainfall amount to 15-minutes 

rainfall intensity (I15) was detected from the unploughed site to the ploughed site model. 

It was probably caused by the higher protective surface cover (litter + vegetation) in the 



94 
 

ploughed site (25% more). The higher importance of I15 as surface cover increased 

over the plots was also detected between the eucalypt and the pine plots with higher 

litter cover of Prats et al. (2012). Equally, Vega et al. (2005), studying shrubs with a 

vegetation cover as high as 37% immediately after a prescribed fire, also found rainfall 

energy (accumulated kinetic energy) to be the main factor for runoff generation 

followed by litter depth.  

The coverage of both litter and ashes (8% more in the ploughed than in the 

unploughed site) could explain about 10% reduction in runoff. Other authors have 

found that the interception and storage capacity of both litter and ash layer have 

reduced overland flow (Shakesby et al., 1996; Leighton–Boyce et al., 2007; Woods and 

Balfour 2008; Cerdà and Doerr, 2008; Bodí et al, 2011; Prats et al., 2012). Woods and 

Balfour 2008 attributed this retention to the highly porous nature of the ash layer, 

whereas Leighton–Boyce et al. (2007) suggested that the wettable patchy ash layer 

may have provided some moisture storage. Bodí et al. (2011) demonstrated that ash is 

not necessarily wettable, as widely assumed, but can be water repellent and therefore 

its effect over soil wettability will depend on the ash layer wettability. This study’s 

measurements over the ash layer confirmed its wettability (the overall two post- fire 

years’ median was “0” ethanol class and percentile 75 was “1” ethanol class). 

The effect of the spatial and seasonal variation of soil water repellency on runoff 

generation founded by other authors in the same region (Ferreira et al., 2000; Keizer 

2005a; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007; Malvar et al., 2011; Prats et al., 2012) was 

detected in the general and site-specific runoff regression models. However, the spatial 

variability of the soil water repellency was irregular in time and poorly related to overall 

values. Keizer et al. (2008), at the same sites and during the first post-fire year, 

founded that the ploughed site exhibited greater repellency levels than the unploughed 

site. Further analyses founded that the opposite was true for the second post-fire year. 

At both sites, Keizer et al. (2008) confirmed a seasonal pattern of high repellency in dry 

periods and reduced or no repellency following prolonged rainfall. The intensive 

monitoring allowed distinctions in the key factors explaining runoff generation between 

those soil water repellency conditions. Under no repellency, I15 was the main factor 

controlling overland flow with a great importance (21%) of the interception (litter+ ash) 

layer. As repellency increased, the main factor changed from I15 to rainfall amount, and 

the interception layer decreased in importance (7%). It can be stated that, under 

repellent conditions, high rainfall volumes with medium I15 events were able to generate 

enough overland flow to transport sediments even with high protective cover. In 



95 
 

unburnt eucalypt stands, Keizer et al., (2005a) suggests how the discrimination 

between (none to extreme) soil water repellency conditions could help to isolate the 

effect of repellency on overland flow generation. However, the soil water repellency 

effect was not straightforward, since exceptions of low runoff generation for high rainfall 

amounts under high soil water repellency conditions were also measured. So, the 

repellency measurement method is not accurate enough to fully capture the temporal-

spatial dynamics. Keizer et al., (2008), detected significant increases and decreases in 

repellency severity over time intervals as short as 6–7 days. Further studies will have to 

verify if a higher temporal resolution of water repellency measurements can help to 

determine a closer relationship with runoff response. Ideally, this should be done in 

constant feedback with modelling approaches that considering temporal and spatial 

variation in soil water repellency, in order to enhance model performance and point out 

the necessary measurement resolution.  

Sediment losses were controlled by I15 followed by litter cover. Previous studies 

have also reported the importance of rainfall intensity (Fernandez et al., 2004; Vega et 

al., 2005; Spigel and Robichaud 2007; Robichaud et al., 2008; Prats et al., 2012) and 

the contribution of cover-related variables (Shakesby et al., 1996; Robichaud et al., 

2000; Wagenbrenner et al., 2006; Prats et al., 2012) in determining post-fire sediment 

losses. Erosion was also related with the variables that affect runoff, i.e., soil water 

repellency, soil moisture, and ash cover. Thus, the highest sediment losses did not 

occur only in the first months after fire (when the protective cover categories were the 

lowest), but also in the second post-fire year autumn when the I15 was higher or 

coinciding with runoff coefficient peaks following the dry seasons. 

 

4.3. Natural vs. simulated rainfall  

Malvar et al. (2011) carried out repeated rainfall simulation experiments (RSE’s) at 

the same unploughed and ploughed eucalypt stands. 46 RSE’s were performed, 

applying two rainfall intensities: high intensity with 45-50 mm h-1 (n= 12 in each site) 

and extreme intensity with 80-85 mm h-1 (n= 12 at the unploughed and n=10 at the 

ploughed site). The RSE’s were executed in six successive field campaigns during the 

first two years following wildfire, using the same plot type, size (0.28 m2), number and 

slope position than the present natural rainfall study. Therefore, the present runoff and 

erosion results can be used to address the representativeness of the RSE-data of 

Malvar et al. (2011) for natural rainfall conditions.  Inherent differences between the 

measurement techniques were the lower rainfall amount and kinetic energy in the 



96 
 

RSE’s. Oppositely, the maximum intensity recorded in a natural event (24 mm h-1 with 

an I15=33 mm h
-1) was much lower than the simulated rainfall intensity (45-85 mm h-1). 

RSE’s intensities were only comparable to the two maximum I15 recorded (I15=44 mm h
-

1 and I15=71 mm h
-1) at two single occasions.  

Differences between the results were lower in terms of runoff response than 

sediment losses. In the unploughed site, the simulated rainfall was 70% lower than 

natural, generating 36% less runoff amount and 90% less sediment losses. In the 

ploughed site, 75% less rainfall originated 54% less runoff amount and 83% less 

sediment losses with simulated than with natural rainfall. Relative variables (runoff 

generation coefficient and specific sediment losses) were more appropriate to compare 

both methods. The average runoff coefficient generated by the RSE’s (45%) was 

double than that under natural rainfall (22%). However, specific sediment rates 

remained comparable with the two techniques (Figure 7). In the unploughed site, 

specific sediment losses under natural rainfall (0.35 g m-2 mm-1 rain) were double than 

those with high intensity RSE’s (0.16 m-2 mm-1 rain) but very similar to those from 

extreme intensity RSE’s (0.31 g m-2 mm-1 rain). This means that the 12 extreme 

intensity RSE’s executed in six campaigns during two post-fire years, were able to 

capture the same erosion rates than those of 4 natural rainfall micro-plots monitored 

during the same period (254 events monitored in 71 weekly periods). In the ploughed 

site, the natural rainfall micro-plots produced 0.06 g m-2 mm-1 rain whereas high (n=12) 

and extreme (n=10) intensity RSE’s produced 0.08 g m-2 mm-1 rain. The absence of 

differences in specific sediment losses between both techniques was probably due to 

sediment exhaustion several years after it was ploughed. Independently of the 

technique or site, the organic matter fraction on the eroded sediments was around 40-

50% with the implications above mentioned of such a high organic matter loss. In 

summary, the main similarities between both techniques were:  

(i) The RSE’s represented relatively well specific erosion rates, organic matter 

fraction losses and differences between sites. Both natural and artificial rainfall 

indicated that the ploughed site had comparable runoff amounts but less sediment 

losses than the unploughed site. However, the fact that only extreme intensity RSE’s 

were able to capture the erosion figures in the unploughed site created uncertainty 

about the fitting of the RSE’s methodology in sites with higher erosion rates.  

(ii) The significant effect of time since fire on runoff and sediment losses had been 

captured by natural rainfall monitoring as well as repeated RSE’s methodology. On one 

hand, both micro-plot scale techniques detected the role of topsoil water repellency in 



97 
 

enhancing overland flow generation under dry antecedent weather conditions. On the 

other hand, runoff and sediment losses measurements as high as one month after the 

fire were also measured two years after the fire using both methodologies. 

 

5. Conclusions 

Runoff and sediment losses were measured in two burnt eucalypt sites, with 

different pre-fire management (unploughed and down-slope rip-ploughed), during two 

post-fire years using micro-plots (0.28 m2), the main conclusions are the following: 

The runoff response was consistently around 20% of the rainfall, independently of 

the site and post-fire year; this was comparable to other studies in the region. The 

erosive response of the unploughed site (4.15 Mg ha-1 year-1) was comparable to other 

Mediterranean studies, but it was very low for the ploughed site (1.25 Mg ha-1 year-1), 

probably due to the limited sediment supply. The time elapsed since ploughing can 

explain the lower sediment availability and sediment exhaustion. Ploughing increased 

within-site variability in sediment rates, probably by enhancing specific-plot variability. 

The measured sediment exhaustion at the ploughed site should consider ploughing as 

an additional risk for forest soils in this area, especially since ploughing and slope 

engineering (terracing), in both recently burnt and unburnt eucalypt stands, are 

increasingly more frequent in the region. Independently of the management, the 

organic matter fraction was around 40-50% of the eroded sediments. Despite the low 

measured erosion rates, the high overland flow generation highlighted the possible 

post-fire erosion risk. The importance of that risk should be considered due to the poor 

soils in this area, the historical and present intensive land use, as well as the 

importance of organic matter fraction on the eroded sediments.  

Time since fire had a significant effect over runoff and sediment production. 

However, the observed temporal trend in runoff and sediment production was not a 

simple decline with time since fire, but had a marked seasonal component. High runoff 

and erosion peaks were measured two years after fire. This was mainly related to the 

role of soil water repellency in enhancing overland flow. Nevertheless, a moderate 

decline in specific sediment rates was observed. 

Post-fire overland flow was controlled first by rainfall amount, followed with a 

similar contribution of surface cover and topsoil water repellency. However, site and 

temporal characteristics did influence that relationship. When either a protective 

surface cover (vegetation + litter) or some infiltration capacity (hydrophilic conditions) 



98 
 

were present, there was detected a shift from rainfall amount to I15 as main factor 

controlling runoff generation. Independently of the site and/or temporal variation, 

sediment losses were controlled by the I15 followed by cover related variables. 

Variables that were proved to affect runoff (soil water repellency, soil moisture, ash 

layer) were also related to sediment losses. 

The natural rainfall results confirmed that rainfall simulation experiences (RSE’s) 

produced higher runoff coefficient but were able to capture the specific sediment losses 

and its organic matter content as well as differences between the ploughed and 

unploughed sites. The methodology of repeated RSE’s also captured the role of soil 

water repellency in enhance runoff and subsequent sediment losses following the dry 

seasons, even two years after the fire. Soil erosion models will need to consider the 

role of soil water repellency in enhancing post-fire runoff.

ABSTRACT

Forest fires can greatly increase runoff and surface erosion rates. Post-fire soil erosion control measures are intended to minimize this response and
facilitate ecosystem recovery. In a few recent cases, hydromulch has been applied, and this consists of a mixture of organic fibers, water and seeds.
The objectives of this research were to (i) analyze the effectiveness of hydromulch in reducing post-fire runoff and sediment production and
(ii) determine the underlying processes and mechanisms that control post-fire runoff and erosion. After a wildfire occurred in August 2008,
14 plots ranging in size from 0·25 to 10m2 were installed on a 25 degree slope in a burnt pine plantation that had also been subjected to salvage
logging. Half of the plots were randomly selected and treated with hydromulch. One of two slope strips adjacent to the plots was also hydromulched
and used for monitoring some soil properties. Measurements made in each of the first 3years following the wildfire included (i) the plot-scale runoff
volumes and sediment yields; (ii) soil shear strength, soil moisture, and soil water repellency; and (iii) surface cover. The hydromulch reduced over-
land flow volume by 70% and soil erosion by 83%. The decrease in runoff was attributed to the increase in soil water retention capacity and the
decrease in soil water repellency, whereas the reduction in soil erosion was initially attributed to the protective cover provided by the hydromulch
and lately to an enhanced vegetative regrowth in the third year after burning. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION

Soil erosion is a key process in the functioning of
Mediterranean ecosystems (Cantón et al., 2001; Ceballos
et al., 2003; Cerdà et al., 2010), and wildfires represent
one of a number of disturbances in forests and shrublands
that can greatly increase soil and fertility losses (Cerdà,
1998a, 1998b; Shakesby &amp;amp; Doerr, 2006; Shakesby,
2011). The consumption of the vegetation and litter layer
by fire increases both overland flow—because of the
reduction of rainfall interception and resistance to flow—
and sediment losses by increasing the splash erosion by rain-
drops (Soto &amp;amp; Diaz-Fierros, 1997; Llorens &amp;amp; Domingo,
2006). Additionally, the fire-induced heating of the soil can
reduce aggregate stability, decrease porosity, and increase soil
water repellency (SWR), and these changes can decrease
infiltration and increase soil erodibility (DeBano, 2000;
Ferreira et al., 2008; Keizer et al., 2008; Malvar et al., 2011;
Prats et al., 2012).
The association of wildfire with on-site soil erosion and

downstream flooding and massive sediment deposition has
become increasingly recognized (Kraebel, 1934) and, in
the early part of the last century, led to the first systematic
soil erosion control treatments following wildfires (Munns,
1919). The first post-fire rehabilitation efforts consisted of

building engineering structures (check dams) in stream
channels to trap the sediments and of seeding hillslopes to
increase ground cover (Wohlgemuth et al., 2009). However,
it was proved to be unrealistic to build check dams in the
short periods between the occurrence of the wildfires and
the occurrence of the erosion-producing rains; also, various
studies started to question the effectiveness of seeding to
reduce soil erosion during the 1980s (Gautier, 1983; Taskey
et al., 1989).
During the 1990s and the 2000s, research on post-fire

erosion mitigation concerned seeding (e.g., Pinaya et al.,
2000; Fernández-Abascal et al., 2003; Beyers, 2004;
Robichaud et al., 2006; Groen &amp;amp; Woods, 2008; Peppin
et al., 2010), construction of erosion barriers by using logs
(Wagenbrenner et al., 2006; Robichaud et al., 2008), and
straw mulching (Bautista et al., 1996; Badía &amp;amp; Martí,
2000; Wagenbrenner et al., 2006). In a nutshell, these
studies found seeding to be effective in some cases but not
in others, log erosion barriers to be ineffective unless
rain events are few and small, and mulching to be
highly effective. The effectiveness of mulching was also
well-established for agriculture lands (Harris &amp;amp; Yao,
1923; Meyer et al., 1970; Lyles et al., 1974; Meyer et al.,
1999; Wilson et al., 2004; García-Orenes et al., 2009,
2010; Giménez-Morera et al., 2010; Jordán et al., 2010),
cut slopes, and unpaved roads (Grismer &amp;amp; Hogan, 2005;
Jordán &amp;amp; Zavala, 2008).
Post-fire straw mulching at rates of c.a. 2 Mg ha?1 has

been proved to reduce sediment yields by more than 80%

(Bautista et al., 1996; Badía &amp;amp; Martí, 2000; Wagenbrenner
et al., 2006; Groen &amp;amp; Woods, 2008; Fernández et al.,
2011; Robichaud et al., 2013b). However, straw may be
available in only limited quantities in certain regions,
including Portugal (Prats et al., 2012), and may be
redistributed by strong winds as a result of its low weight
(Robichaud et al., 2000). Straw application can also
introduce invasive weeds and inhibit native species recovery
(Kruse et al., 2004). Despite the increased application costs,
other mulches of higher specific weight have also been
tested. Forest residues, at application rates of 8 Mg ha?1 in
Prats et al. (2012) and 46 Mg ha?1 in Shakesby et al.
(1996), or wood strands mulch, at rates of 4–12 Mg ha ?1

in Robichaud et al. (2013a), were found to be as effective
as straw mulch, whereas wood chips mulch was found to
be much less effective (Kim et al., 2008; Fernández
et al., 2011).
Mulching is effective against erosion because it

reduces runoff and erosion rates by two mechanisms.
First, it increases interception storage capacity, which
reduces the amount of rain available for producing
runoff, it reduces runoff velocity, and it increases soil
moisture (Bautista et al., 2009). Second, mulch protects
the soil surface against the kinetic energy of rainfall
drops and decreases the hydrodynamic power of flowing
water (Smets et al., 2008).
A recent variant of mulching is that of hydromulching,

which refers to the application of a water-based mixture
of organic fibers, seeds and a green colorant. It is easily
applied because it can be sprayed onto slopes by a jet hose
(Naveh, 1975). It also tends to bind strongly to the soil
surface by the action of the soil-binding agent, so it is
particularly useful on steep slopes and strongly modified
areas such as quarries, construction sites, and cut and fill
slopes along roads (Emanual, 1976; Benik et al., 2003;
Robichaud et al., 2010). Runoff and soil erosion will be
reduced because the hydromulch increases interception
storage and protects the soil surface. Additionally, the
introduced seeds are intended to increase the vegetative
cover, especially when the mulch starts decompose. In
burnt areas, seeding requires careful selection of species
that are adapted to the target environment, both to guaran-
tee that the seeding produces an adequate cover and to
avoid that the introduced species come to behave as inva-
sive weed (Kruse et al., 2004). An important disadvantage
of hydromulching is its elevated costs, which can range
from $3,700.00 to $10,300.00 per ha for aerial application
(Hubbert et al., 2012). By contrast, the costs for straw
mulching are on the order of $600.00 and $1,200.00 per
ha for application by helicopter and by hand-spreading,
respectively (Napper, 2006). Despite this greater expense,
hydromulching has been used especially in the USA after
some fires when access was difficult, the slopes were too
steep or subject to wind to use straw mulch and when
there were particularly important ‘values at risk’, such as
water reservoirs, cultural or natural heritage sites, or
industrial plants.

The effectiveness of hydromulching in reducing post-fire
runoff and erosion has not yet been fully established.
Although Robichaud et al. (2013b) found no marked
decrease in post-fire runoff, Hubbert et al. (2012), Rough
(2007), and Robichaud et al. (2010, 2013a) did report
substantial reductions in erosion rates (with 65–95%).
However, these reductions were restricted to the first year
after hydromulching, which the authors attributed to the
rapid breakdown of the mulch layer. Wohlgemuth et al.
(2011) also found hydromulching to markedly reduce
overall erosion rates (by 60–80%) but not the sediment
losses produced by high-intensity storms. Robichaud et al.
(2010) suggested that hydromulching would be most effec-
tive on short slopes (10–20 m), where interrill erosion is
the dominant process and the hydromulch mat is less likely
to be detached by rill incision. However, Rough (2007)
found aerial hydromulching to be highly effective on long
hillslopes with elevated rill densities (0·1 rill m?2).
Given the elevated potential of hydromulching for post-

fire rehabilitation, there is a clear need to test its effective-
ness in geographical regions outside the USA. Although
hydromulch can include surfactants, the effectiveness of
hydromulching has been poorly assessed for vegetation
types associated with strong or extreme SWR, such as the
eucalypt and pine plantations that dominate in north-central
Portugal (Ferreira et al., 2008, Keizer et al., 2008; Prats
et al., 2012). Also, the effectiveness of hydromulching after
post-fire salvage logging is poorly known in spite of being
perhaps the most common practice following wildfires in
north-central Portugal. Salvage logging was typically being
used to recover timber values and reduce the risk of insect
infestation (McIver &amp;amp; Starr, 2000), but it can trigger runoff
and soil erosion through soil alteration and forest floor
disturbances (Rab, 1994; Castillo et al., 1997; Edeso et al.,
1999; Fernández et al., 2004, 2007).
The overall aim of the present research was to study the

effectiveness of hydromulching to reduce runoff and
erosion over a three-year period in a recently burnt and
logged pine plantation in north-central Portugal. The
specific objectives were to (i) assess the effectiveness of
hydromulching in reducing runoff volumes and sediment
yields at the plot scale; (ii) analyze the changes in runoff
and soil erosion over time and across plot size (0·25, 0·5,
and 10 m2 plots); and (iii) determine the effect of
hydromulching on key soil properties, surface cover, and
vegetative recovery, and the extent to which these
mulching-induced changes can explain the observed differ-
ences in runoff and erosion between the hydromulched and
untreated plots.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Study Area and Site

This study was conducted near the village of Colmeal in the
Góis municipality of north-central Portugal (N 40º08?42?, W
7º59?16?; 490 m asl). On 27 August 2008, a wildfire burnt
68 ha of forest lands. A west-facing 25 degree steep hillslope

was selected to study post-fire vegetation recovery (Maia
et al., 2012a, 2012b), and, at a later stage, also for this study.
The hillslope had been planted with maritime pine (Pinus
pinaster Ait.) some 25 years before the wildfire, at a density
of 2,600 saplings per ha. The undergrowth was composed of
a mixture of Mediterranean and Atlantic shrubs and was
dominated by Calluna vulgaris I. and Arbutus unedo L.
(Maia et al., 2012b). The study area has a Mediterranean
climate with a mean annual temperature of 10–12·5°C
(according to Köppen; APA, 2011). The annual precipita-
tion as recorded by the nearest weather station (Cadafaz, N
40º08?02?, W 8º32?40?; 12 km W?1 from the study area;
25 years of data) was, on average, 1,130 mm but varied from
717 mm to 1,872 mm (SNIRH, 2012). The soils were
shallow, 30- to 35-cm deep Humic Cambisols (WRB,
2007), overlying schist, as was observed from four soil pits
dug during November 2008 (Table I). A soil sample was
collected at 0–5 cm depth in each pit, and later analyzed,
using standard laboratory methods, for bulk density (Porta
et al., 2003), porosity, and grain-size distribution (Guitian
&amp;amp; Carballas, 1976). Percent organic carbon was determined
by a carbon analyzer (Flash EA 1112 series by Thermo
Finnigan, USA) and multiplied by the van Bemmelen factor
(1·724) in order to obtain the organic matter content on the
soil (Jackson, 1958).

Experimental Design, Field Data Collection, and
Laboratory Analyses

At the location selected for this experiment, the 2008
wildfire had completely consumed the pine crowns, so

there was basically no needle cast after the fire (Table I).
On 11 December 2008, 106 days after the fire, more than
half of the soil surface corresponded to black ashes, a
third to stones, and less than 10% to bare soil. The fire
severity was classified as moderate according to various
severity indices described in Maia et al. (2012b) at
locations some 5–10 m distance from the present experi-
ment. For example, the maximum temperature reached
(Guerrero et al., 2007) by the soil at 0–3 cm depth, esti-
mated with near-infrared spectroscopy, was, on average,
78°C; the twig diameter index ( Maia et al., 2012a),
which ranged between 0 (unburnt) and 1 (very intense
wildfire) was, on average, 0·4 (Table I).
Because the National Forestry Authority had decided to

log the stand as soon as possible because of the risk of
nematode infestation, the experimental set up of this study
involved four phases. The first phase comprised the installa-
tion of a tipping-bucket rain gage (Pronamic professional
rain gauge with an event logger) in combination with a
storage gage for validation purposes. This was carried out
on 15 September 2008, prior to any rainfall following
the wildfire. After that, the rainfall was measured weekly
from the storage gage, and the maximum weekly or
monthly 30-min rainfall intensity (‘I30’, in mm h?1)
was calculated for each period from the tipping-bucket
rain gage data series.
On 5 November 2008, the pretreatment period started

with the installation of four plots bounded with metal sheets.
Two were micro-plots of approximately 0·5 × 0·5 m,
whereas the other two were small plots of approximately
0·5 m wide and 1·0 m long. The outlets of each plot were
connected, using garden hose, to 30 L tanks, where the run-
off was collected. The runoff volume in each tank was mea-
sured at 1- to 2-weekly intervals, depending on rainfall, from
5 November 2008 to 12 October 2010, except during March
2008 when the runoff measurements had to be interrupted
because of the logging activities. This 23-month period
was divided in a pretreatment and posttreatment period, as
further specified in Table II. Whenever runoff exceeded
250 ml, a sample was collected for determination of
sediment and organic matter contents by using standard
laboratory methods (filtration at 14 ?m, drying for 24 h at
105°C and loss-on-ignition for 4 h at 550°C; APHA, 1998).
The third phase began on 30 March 2009, after the log-

ging had been completed, when two more micro-plots
and two more small plots were installed at close distances
from the previous micro-plots (&lt;5 m) along with six sedi-
ment fences (Robichaud &amp;amp; Brown, 2002) that had been
set up at some 10–20 m distance in the upslope direction.
Following the design by Fernández et al. (2011), these
sediment fence plots (‘SF plots’) of roughly 2-m wide
and 5-m long were bounded by means of a geotextile fabric
and delimited by metal sheets to avoid run-on into the
plots. The geotextile fabric filtered the runoff, and only
the sediments accumulated at the bottom of the SF plots
were collected at monthly intervals from 31 March 2009
to 12 October 2010. Afterwards, the SF plots were emptied

on a single occasion, on 28 November 2011, comprising
the fourth phase of this study. The collected sediments
were later analyzed for their moisture and organic matter
contents by using standard laboratory methods (drying for
24 h at 105°C and loss-on-ignition for 4 h at 550°C;
APHA, 1998).
On 31 March 2009, the hydromulch was applied to two of

the four micro-plots, two of the four small plots, and three of
the six SF plots, all of which were selected randomly. In
addition, it was applied to one of two adjacent soil strips
of 5-m wide and 10-m long, which had been delineated for
monitoring of selected soil properties by using destructive
techniques. The hydromulch was provided and applied by
Serraic, Lda. by using a jet hose operated by a person on
foot. It consisted of an aqueous mixture of wood fibers,
seeds, a surfactant, nutrients, a natural bio-stimulant and a
green colorant applied at a nominal ratio of 3.5 Mg ha-1.
The formulation is confidential, but the company guaranteed
that the components are nontoxic for humans or the environ-
ment. The seed composition was also confidential, but
detailed descriptions of the floristic composition in the SF
plots suggested that it included grass (e.g., Lolium perenne L.)
as well as shrub species [Cytisus striatus (Hill), Ulex
minor Roth.].
Ground cover was measured at seven occasions be-

tween 31 March 2009 and 12 October 2010 and finally
on 11 November 2011. The ground cover was recorded
at each intersection point of a 5 × 5-cm grid in the case
of the micro-plots and small plots, and of a 10 × 10-cm
grid in the case of the SF plots, that is, at 100, 200, and
400 points, respectively. Each recording involved classify-
ing the ground cover according to seven categories: stones

bigger than 2 mm (‘Stone’), bare soil (‘Bare’), ashes
(‘Ash’), litter (‘Litter’), hydromulch (‘Hm’), native
vegetation (‘Natveg’), and vegetation introduced by
hydromulch (‘Introveg’). The data also were grouped into
two lumped categories: total vegetation (‘Tveg’) and total
protective ground cover (‘Hlv’), with the latter being the
sum of hydromulch, litter, and vegetation.
The soil strips were sampled at monthly intervals from

22 April 2009 to 11 August 2010 for a total of 17 occa-
sions. Sampling involved destructive measurements of soil
shear strength, using a torvane (vane tester, Eijkelkamp),
and of SWR, using the molarity ethanol drop (Doerr,
1998). At the bottom of each 50 m2-strip, 15 equally
spaced measurements were made along a horizontal tran-
sect, and this transect was then shifted approximately
0·5 m upslope for the next sampling occasion. Before mea-
suring shear strength or repellency, any hydromulch,
stones, litter, or ashes were removed. The molarity ethanol
drop test was slightly modified in accordance with our
prior studies (e.g., Keizer et al., 2005a, 2005b, 2008). In
this study, three drops of pure water were applied to the
soil surface, and, if two of the three drops did not infiltrate
within 5 s, three drops with successively higher ethanol
concentrations were applied until two of the three drops
infiltrated within 5 s. The nine ethanol concentrations used
were 0, 1, 3, 5, 8·5, 13, 18, 24, and 36%. In data analysis,
the overall median of the relative frequency of any ethanol
concentrations higher than 0%, calculated over the total
measurements in each strip, was called SWR frequency.
Volumetric soil moisture content was monitored at a

depth of 0–5 cm at eight locations: four within the untreated
SF plots and four within the hydromulched SF plots. This

was carried out using eight EC-5 sensors linked to two
Em5b data loggers (Decagon Devices, Inc.) and recording
data at 10 min intervals. For each read-out period, initial soil
moisture content (‘Sm’) was calculated as the soil moisture
at the start of the largest rainfall event during that 1- to 2-
weekly period by using the data of the automatic rainfall
gage to identify this event.

Data Analysis

For the statistical analyses described in the succeeding text,
runoff volumes and (specific) soil losses were fourth-root
transformed so that the residuals did not fail the assumption
of normality according to the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test at
? ? 0·05, whereas runoff coefficients were square-root
transformed for the same reason. Furthermore, 16 read-outs
with low rainfall amounts (less than 6 mm) had to be
removed from the data set to prevent non-normality of the
residuals.
The effects of hydromulching, plot size, and time-since-

hydromulching on the dependent variables (runoff volume,
runoff coefficient, soil losses, specific soil losses, and
organic matter content of the eroded sediments) were
assessed by means of a three-way repeated measures analy-
sis of variance (ANOVA) (Ott &amp;amp; Longnecker, 2001). The
variance–covariance structure of each dependent variable
was selected according to the lowest values of the Akaike
information criterion and the restricted maximum likelihood
(REML) fit (Littell et al., 2006). The heterogeneous first-
order auto-regressive variance–covariance structure was
selected for all dependent variables except runoff coefficient,
for which a spatial power structure was selected. In addition,
specific contrasts between the treated and control plots, for
each individual read-out as well as between the three plot
sizes, were tested by means of the least squares means and
adjusted by the Tukey–Kramer method (Kramer, 1956).
Repeated measures ANOVA was also used to test the treat-
ment and time effects on the seven ground cover categories
and the initial soil moisture content. In the case of soil
resistance and SWR frequency, however, the treatment effect

could only be tested using a nonparametric test, that is, the
Mann–Whitney U-test (? ? 0·05).
Stepwise multiple linear regressions using the REG

procedure in SAS (Littell et al., 1996) were used to determine
how well the weekly runoff volumes (n = 35) and the
monthly soil losses (n = 17) could be explained by a set of
independent variables. These variables were selected
sequentially in a forward selection procedure, in order of
decreasing significance by using a minimum p value of
0·05. The 16 independent variables were plot size (‘Plotsz’),
rainfall amount (‘Rain’), 30-min maximum rainfall intensity
(‘I30’), days since the last rainy day (‘Drain’), the seven
individual (‘Stone’, ‘Bare’, ‘Ash‘, ‘Litter‘, ‘Hm’, ‘Natveg’,
and ‘Introveg’), the two lumped categories (‘Tveg’ and
‘Hlv’), soil shear strength (‘Storv’), SWR frequency, and
initial soil moisture content (‘Sm’). Especially because the
various cover categories can be expected to reveal strong
correlations, collinearly tests were included in the stepwise
procedure, removing independent variables with a condition
index higher than 30 (Belsley et al. 1980) from the regres-
sion models.

RESULTS

Rainfall Amount and Intensity

Rainfall was considerably lower during the first year after
the wildfire (1,014 mm) than during the two subsequent
years (1,464 and 1,527 mm, respectively; Table II). Even
though this study did not commence until 8 December
2008 and had to be interrupted, because of the salvage
logging, during March 2009, the present analysis covered
almost 90% of the rainfall during the first post-fire year
(891 mm; Figure 1). From these 891 mm, 609 mm fell before
the logging and the hydromulch application (designated here
as ‘pretreatment period’), and 282 were measured until the
end of post-fire year 1. The highest rainfall amounts were
measured during winter, in January 2009 and 2010 with
244 and 262 mm, respectively. The highest rainfall intensi-
ties, however, occurred during different times of the first

post-fire year, during May 2009 and September 2009 with
maximum I30 of 29 mm h?1 and 21 mm h?1. During the
second post-fire year, I30s of 15 mm h?1 occurred at least
once a month from October 2009 to April 2010.

Ground Cover

At the start of this study, in December 2008, half of the soil
surface was covered by ashes, and less than 10% was bare
(Figure 2; Table I). By 26 March 2009, after the logging
had been completed, ash cover had decreased to 28%, the
bare soil cover had increased to 17%, and the stones had
become the predominant cover category with, on average,
42%. The recovery of the vegetation was very slow on the
control plots, as vegetative cover continued to be near zero
1 year after the fire (August 2009), but reached 30% after
the second year (October 2010) and a mere 36% at the
beginning of the fourth post-fire year (November 2011).
Immediately after its application, on 31 March 2009, the
hydromulch provided a cover of 80% on average, but this
cover was significantly higher at the two micro-plots and
two small plots (90% ± 4%) than at the three SF plots
(64% ± 2) (ANOVA, p &amp;lt;0·05). This difference was no
longer significant after five months (August 2009), even
though the hydromulch cover continued higher at the four
runoff plots (64% ± 12) than at the three SF plots (47% ± 7;
ANOVA, p = 0·06). There was a marked decrease (5·3%
per month) in the average of the hydromulch cover during
the first 5 months after its application. After 1 year from
the application (1 April 2010), the hydromulch cover
decreased to 27% on average (an annual decay rate of
4·6% per month). This decrease in hydromulch cover was,
by and large, compensated by an increase in protective soil
cover due to the native and introduced vegetation (including
the litter it produced). The cover of the introduced vegeta-
tion was at its maximum (22%) in June 2010 and became
practically zero by November 2011. The native vegetation
recovered slowly on the hydromulched plots as well but by

November 2011 did attain a clearly higher cover than at
the control plots (52% vs. 36%). The total protective ground
cover (lumped into the ‘hlv’ category) was around 75%
through all the post-treatment period. When the stone cover
is included, a protective layer consistently covered 90% of
the surface.

Soil Properties

The monthly values of soil shear strength, frequency of
SWR, as well as the soil moisture content over the post-
treatment period are depicted in Figure 3. The three
variables oscillated across the monitoring period according
to the rainfall amounts. Soil shear strength and soil moisture
varied in the wake of the rainfall variations. By contrast,
SWR showed the lowest values during the rainiest months.
Overall, soil resistance to detachment was lower at the

untreated than treated strip (2·4 ± 0·7 kg cm?2 vs.
2·8 ± 0·5 kg cm?2; U-test: Z = ?5·04; p &amp;lt;0·01). Shear
strength was clearly lowest at the control strip during 12
out of 17 months as opposed to 2 months at the
hydromulched strip, when shear strength was also greater
than during the remaining months.
The hydromulched strip, overall, was less repellent than

the control (15% vs. 35% SWR frequency; U-test:
Z = ?6·07; p &amp;lt;0·01) and consequently had higher soil mois-
ture (18·1% volume ± 9·7 vs. 14·3% ± 6·7; ANOVA: F = 7;
p &amp;lt;0·05). In certain periods, however, the opposite was true,
as is well-illustrated by Figure 3. In the case of soil moisture
content, these periods were confined to the dry season of
summer 2009; in the case of SWR, it also happened during
summer 2010.

Overall Runoff and Soil Losses

Roughly half of the rainfall was converted into runoff on
the control plots (Table II). This corresponded to 360 mm
of runoff [runoff coefficient (rc) = 60%] during the pre-
treatment period, 140 mm during the post-treatment

period of the first post-fire year (rc = 50%), and 691 mm
during the second post-fire year (rc = 47%). These
differences coincided with the variations in rainfall amount.
However, the same was not true in the case of soil losses.
The control plots produced, on average, 86 g m?2 during the
pre-treatment period, 217 g m?2 during the post-treatment
period of the first post-fire year, and 361 g m?2 during the
second post-fire year. There was a fivefold increase in the spe-
cific soil losses between the pre-treatment and post-treatment
periods (from 0·14 to 0·77 g m?2 mm rain?1), and after that,
the specific soil losses decreased progressively until reaching
values similar to those prior to the logging during the third
year (0·16 g m?2 mm rain?1; Table II).

Hydromulching was highly effective in reducing overland
flow, with, on average, 56% during the first post-fire year
and even 78% during the subsequent year (Table II).
Hydromulching effectiveness in decreasing soil losses
exceeded the effectiveness at reducing overland flow to a
marked extent, amounting to 83% during both years. During
the third post-fire year, however, the effectiveness in
mitigating erosion reduced to 56%. Hydromulching did,
however, increase somewhat the relative amounts of organic
matter in the eroded sediments to 57% as opposed to 50%
and 52%.
The ANOVA analysis of Table III showed that the treat-

ment effect strongly influenced all the variables, especially

POST-FIRE HYDROMULCHING REDUCED RUNOFF AND SEDIMENT LOSSES

in the case of runoff coefficient (F value of 176) and less
important in the case of the organic matter content (F = 9).
The strong treatment effect, especially in the case of runoff
coefficient as highlighted by the big F value (176),
contrasted with the lack of effect of the plot size.
In Figure 4 it can be observed that the differences in

runoff between plot sizes were very low (in the order of
12–20%, for micro-plots and small plots, respectively).
The runoff on the control plots decreased with increasing
plot size mainly because of the low runoff amount of one
of the small plots (684 mm), whereas the same was true
but in the opposite sense in the case of one small
hydromulched plot (309 mm). These opposite tendencies
resulted in a higher hydrological effectiveness of
hydromulching for the micro-plots compared with the small
plots (on average, 80% vs. 68%). Plot size also did not play
a clear-cut role in soil losses, but the variance increased,
especially in the case of the control SF plots (up to 70%).
Consequently, the overall reduction in soil losses on the
micro-plots and small plots was somewhat higher compared
with the SF plots (90%, 89%, and 76%, respectively).

Temporal Patterns in Overland Flow and Soil Losses

The average monthly runoff amounts produced by the
untreated plots revealed a marked seasonal pattern in which
peak runoff values appeared to antecede the maximum
monthly rainfall values during the winter season (Figure 5a).
As a result, runoff coefficients were highest during the
autumn months, varying between about 80% to 90% in
December 2008, November 2009, and October 2010. High
runoff coefficients were also observed during late spring
and early summer, when rainfall amounts were compara-
tively small (&lt;53 mm), attaining 62% in July 2009 and
81% in June 2010. The average monthly soil losses at the
untreated plots revealed a less obvious temporal pattern
(Figure 5b). The four peak losses of 50 g m?2 month?1 or
more occurred during autumn (December 2008, September
and November 2009) and spring (May 2009). Apparently,
the latter peak was associated with the elevated maximum
rainfall intensity (I30 = 29 mm h?1), whereas the December
2008 and November 2009 ones were rather related to runoff

peaks. The average specific soil losses suggested a contrast
between the two months with the highest maximum rainfall
intensities—that is, May and September 2009—and the
remaining months. The specific losses during these two
months amounted to 0·8 and 1·2 g m?2 mm rain?1, respec-
tively, as opposed to the baseline monthly average of
0·25 g m?2 mm rain?1 for the rest of the study period.
The hydromulched plots produced, on average, consis-

tently lower amounts of monthly runoff as well as monthly
soil losses than the untreated plots (Figure 5a and 5b). In
the case of runoff, these monthly differences were statistically
significant from July 2009 onwards, with the exception of the
summer 2009 and 2010 months with little to no rainfall. In the
case of soil losses, however, the monthly differences were
also statistically significant for the first 2 months following
hydromulching and, thus, for basically all of the 19 months
with noticeable rainfall. Even so, the three-way ANOVA
results indicated that hydromulching did not have an unequiv-
ocal statistically significant effect on monthly soil losses, as
the triple interaction term of treatment x time-since-mulching
x plot size was statistically significant (Table III). The same
applied to the corresponding specific soil losses as well as
to the 1- to 2-weekly runoff volumes and mutatis mutandis
(i.e., because of a significant treatment x time-since-mulching
interaction) to the runoff coefficients and the organic matter
content of the eroded sediments.
Hydromulching failed to produce significant reductions in

overland flow generation (average 1- to 2-weekly values)
across the whole range of maximum rainfall intensities
(Figure 6). There was, however, a tendency for the hydrolog-
ical effectiveness of hydromulching to decrease with maxi-
mum rainfall intensity, reflecting first and foremost the
comparatively low effectiveness (&lt;50%) for the two more
intense measurement periods that happened in May and
September 2009. Also, the effectiveness of hydromulching
to reduce average monthly soil losses was comparatively
low for these two highest maximum rainfall intensities, albeit
it still amounted to some 80% and corresponded to a statisti-
cally significant difference between the hydromulched and
untreated plots. In overall terms, however, the reduction in soil
losses lacked an obvious relationship with rainfall intensity.

Key Factors Explaining Runoff and Soil Losses

Stepwise multiple linear regression with all eight
hydromulched and untreated runoff plots together (‘global
model’) revealed that the total protective ground cover

(‘hlv’) stood out as the principal factor in overland flow
generation, explaining more than twice as much of the
variation in fourth-root transformed runoff amount than the
second factor, I30 (31% vs. 13%; Table IV). The hydrolog-
ical response of the untreated plots alone, however, could
clearly be explained best by rainfall amount (41% of
variance), whereas that of the hydromulched plots alone
was mainly controlled by maximum rainfall intensity, albeit
to a lesser degree (19% of variance). Initial soil moisture
content was the second most important (and significant)
explanatory variable of the runoff produced by the untreated
but not the hydromulched plots. The negative sign of its
coefficient suggested that the role of initial soil moisture
was indirect, with SWR increasingly enhancing overland
flow generation as soils dry out. Figure 7 illustrated well that
the hydrological response of the untreated plots was stronger
under drier than wetter soil conditions. A similar tendency
was suggested for the hydromulched plots but just for rain-
fall amounts below 60 mm, as higher rainfall amounts were
associated with wetter soils at the hydromulched than
untreated strips.
The predominant role of total protective ground cover

(‘hlv’) was even more pronounced in the case of the global
model for soil losses than that for runoff volumes,
explaining over half of the variation (55%; Table IV). The
most conspicuous contrast between the erosion and runoff

results, however, was evidenced by the treatment-specific
models. Bare soil cover clearly outranked rainfall amount/
intensity as the prime factor explaining soil losses, not only
at the untreated plots (26% vs. 11% of variance) but also at
the hydromulched plots (35% vs. 8% of variance).

DISCUSSION

Post-Fire Hydrological and Erosion Response in Pine Sites
of Central Portugal

Post-fire runoff coefficients as high as observed here were
also reported by previous studies in north-central Portugal,
such as Ferreira et al. (2008) and Malvar et al. (2011) by
using rainfall simulation experiments. Both prior studies
related their strong hydrological response to extreme SWR.
In the present study, however, the role of SWR would be
limited to the first year after the wildfire, when repellency
was moderate, and mostly hydrophilic after November
2009. This reduced importance of SWR was also suggested
by the multivariate linear regression model that was fitted to
the runoff data from the control plots. The global regression
model attested that it was rather ground cover that played a
key role in overland flow generation. Pierson et al. (2009)
likewise argued that ground cover exerted a greater
influence on post-fire hydrological response than SWR.
Various studies in Portugal (Shakesby et al., 1996; Ferreira
et al., 2008; Prats et al., 2012) have furthermore attributed
low post-fire runoff coefficients in pine stands to needle cast
from scorched tree crowns (Shakesby et al., 1996; Cerdà &amp;amp;
Doerr, 2008; Ferreira et al., 2008; Prats et al., 2012).
The soil losses from the control plots during the first post-

fire year (302 g m?2) were higher than the range of
80–220 g m ?2 year?1 reported by other studies in burnt pine
plantations (Shakesby et al., 1996; Fernández et al., 2007;
Ferreira et al., 2008; Prats et al., 2012). This could be due
to the salvage logging activities that took place during late
winter/early spring 2009, as was also suggested by the
markedly higher specific soil losses immediately after log-
ging than during the pretreatment period. Logging-enhanced
erosion rates were also reported by Inbar et al. (1997) and

suggested by Malvar et al. (2013) but not by Fernández
et al. (2007). The latter authors attributed their findings to
the low severity of the fire, the low rainfall erosivity, and
the reduced perturbations of the soil by the machinery
employed. To minimize the erosion effects of post-fire
logging, it is widely recommended to delay the logging
activities until litter fall from scorched tree canopies has
provided a ‘natural’ mulching (Rab, 1994; Castillo et al.,
1997; Edeso et al., 1999; Fernández et al., 2004, 2007;
Cerdà &amp;amp; Doerr, 2008).
The soil losses during the first post-fire year fitted in well

with the low values that were reported by Shakesby (2011)
for moderate severity on field plots in the Mediterranean
region (321 g m?2 year?1), which was attributed to an
intensive land-use history. By contrast, in regions of lower
forest interventions such as North America, post-fire erosion
rates can be one order of magnitude higher, amounting to
2,500 g m?2 year?1 (Spigel &amp;amp; Robichaud, 2007). The
discrepancy between these two geographical regions seems
to be much smaller for organic matter losses, with values
of 200 and 150 g m?2 year?1. High losses of organic matter
are of particular relevance as they can easily compromise
soil fertility and, thus, on-site land-use sustainability and
downstream surface water quality through pollution with
toxic pyrogenic organic compounds (Vila-Escalé et al.,
2007; Campos et al., 2012).
A protective ground cover was also the most important

factor explaining the monthly soil losses observed in this
study and the differences therein between the treated and
untreated plots. This agreed well with the bulk of post-fire
soil erosion studies (e.g., Benavides-Solorio &amp;amp; MacDonald,
2001; Pannkuk &amp;amp; Roubichaud, 2003; Benavides-Solorio &amp;amp;
MacDonald, 2005; Fernández et al., 2008; Larsen et al.,
2009). At the same time, bare soil cover played a key role
in the differences in soil losses among the hydromulched
plots, as well as among the control plots. Pietraszek (2006)
equally attested to the relevance of bare soil cover for soil
losses from untreated areas. It could explain 50% of the
variability in soil erosion produced by ten sites that had
burnt from less than one up to 10 years earlier.

POST-FIRE HYDROMULCHING REDUCED RUNOFF AND SEDIMENT LOSSES

Copyright © 2013 John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons, Ltd. LAND DEGRADATION &amp;amp; DEVELOPMENT, (2013)



Effectiveness of Hydromulching in Reducing Runoff and
Soil Losses
The hydromulch was a complex mixture which contained
water, wood fibers, seeds, surfactants, seed-growing bio-
stimulants, nutrients and a green colorant. It is intended that
each component affected some of the pieces of the post-fire
runoff erosion process.
Runoff was highly reduced at the treated plots, between

56% and 73%, which is higher than in other post-fire
mulching experiments, both with straw (Bautista et al.,
1996; Groen &amp;amp; Woods, 2008) and forest residues (Shakesby
et al., 1996; Prats et al., 2012). Probably, this high effective-
ness could be related to the effect of the wood fibers,
because it increases the surface water storage capacity, but
also due to the effect of the surfactants, a wetting agent that
reduces SWR and increases soil infiltration (Leighton-Boyce
et al., 2007; Madsen et al., 2012).
Soil losses were highly reduced in the hydromulch plots

during the 3 years after the wildfire. Ground cover was
pointed out as the main factor controlling soil losses, but the
hydromulch mat showed a rapid decay during the first year
after the application. This was identified as one of the
disadvantages of hydromulchings (MacDonald &amp;amp; Robichaud,
2007). In the present study, the decayment rates of the
hydromulch ranged between 4% and 6% per month, very
similar to other research with hydromulch (Hubbert et al.,
2012; Robichaud et al., 2013a). In contrast to those sites,
our hydromulch was highly conducive to germination and
growth of plants from seeds. Thus, the introduced seeds
compensated for the loss of hydromulch with progressively
more plant and litter cover, which resulted in more than
70% protective ground cover since the hydromulch applica-
tion until the third post-fire year (Figure 2).
Besides the composition, the application technique can

influence the hydromulch effectiveness. In this study, the
area was already logged and the plots were small, which a
priori will facilitate the spread of the hydromulch from a
jet hose operated on foot. However, the hydromulch cover
was significantly lower on the SF plots despite being suffi-
cient to reduce soil erosion. Rough (2007) and Robichaud
et al. (2010) reported that the hydromulch sprayed from
vehicles was intercepted by the standing trees, and they
recommended special caution when applying the mixture
in areas with a high density of dead trees and from long dis-
tances. Aerial hydromulch can be a better and less expensive
option, but Hubbert et al. (2012) checked that the intended
application rates of 50% and 100% hydromulch cover
resulted in only 20–26% and 56%.
Unsuccessful hydromulch experiences were first attrib-

uted to extreme rainfall events (Wohlgemuth et al., 2011)
or to the long length of the plots (Napper, 2006). Robichaud
et al. (2010) pointed out that hydromulch effectiveness
depended on slope length, only being effective at slopes
shorter than 10–20 m, when interrill erosion was the
dominant process instead of rill erosion. The former authors
hypothesized that in their long slope sections, the smooth
and dense hydromulch mat had little resistance against the

sheer force of concentrated flow. But on the other hand,
the research of Rough (2007) showed that aerial
hydromulching was highly effective and was carried out at
the hillslope scale (2,500 m?2, on average), where rills were
frequent (0·1 rills m?2) and after extreme rainfall events
(I30 = 40 mm h?1). Many other hydromulch formulations
are available and are being evaluated for their capacity to
reduce soil losses. As concluded by Robichaud et al.
(2013a), the differences in hydromulch components,
application techniques, and application rates can greatly
impact hydromulch effectiveness. However, Napper (2006)
referred that one of the major problems is the difficulty in
knowing the specific chemical composition that was applied
in a given situation because most of the hydromulch formu-
lations are kept confidential.

Hydromulching Effects in Soil Properties

Soil properties in agriculture had been typically improved
by mulching (Smets et al., 2008) by materials such as
manure, stones, straw, forest residue, and wood shreds
(Harris &amp;amp; Yao, 1923; Mulumba &amp;amp; Lal, 2008; Foltz &amp;amp;
Copeland, 2009). Regarding post-fire soil shear strength,
the results are not conclusive. Bautista et al. (1996) and
Fernández et al. (2011) found no differences between
control and straw mulch plots. Fernández et al. (2007)
found lower figures in logged compared to unlogged
plots. They related these lower values to the absence of
roots, once that the logged plots showed a much lower
vegetation cover. Agreeing with them, the statistically
higher soil shear strength measured on the hydromulch
strip could be related to a higher vegetation cover
compared to the control strip. Regarding soil water prop-
erties, our results are consistent with other mulch experi-
ments (Smets et al., 2008; Bautista et al., 2009; Prats
et al., 2012) in which higher soil moistures were found
on the mulched areas. The hydromulching layer acted
as a water adsorbent dense mat, which effectively
increased the soil water retention capacity. It prevented
sunlight from reaching the soil surface and thereby
decreased soil temperatures. Still, the surfactants included
on the hydromulch could have a role in increasing soil
infiltration and improve the seed germination (Madsen
et al., 2012). Besides the positive impacts over plant
recovery and soil microbial activity (Bautista et al.,
2009), a major insight suggested by Prats et al. (2012)
supported the fact that mulching affected the SWR
regime of the burnt forest, promoting the hydrophilic soil
conditions. However, this was not true during the dry
seasons. Probably, the higher plant cover of the
hydromulch (13% vs. 3% during the first post-fire
summer) could increase the transpiration and thus lower-
ing soil moisture and increasing SWR. Brainard et al.
(2012) reported a higher water demand of plants during
water stress periods in agriculture, and Soto &amp;amp; Diaz-
Fierros (1997) found lower soil moisture on the vegetated
areas as compared with bare and burnt plots during the
first post-fire summer.

CONCLUSIONS

The main conclusions of this study in the effectiveness of
hydromulching to reduce runoff and erosion in a recently
burnt and logged pine plantation were as follows: (i)
hydromulching, providing coverage of 80%, produced
marked changes in SWR and soil moisture, especially in
the soil cover. Despite a decrease of up to 30% after 1 year
from the application, the treatment induced a highly protec-
tive ground cover because of an increase of both vegetative
and litter cover; (ii) hydromulching was highly effective
during the first 19 months after its application, reducing total
runoff volumes by 70% and total soil losses by 83%, and
continued effectively during the third year following the
wildfire, reducing erosion by 56%; ( iii) hydromulching
was less effective in reducing runoff (around 30%) but not
in reducing soil losses (80%) for the more intense storms
(I30 higher to 20 mm h?1); (iv) the protective soil cover
provided by hydromulch, in combination with litter and
vegetation, explained runoff and soil losses better than any
other variable, however, rainfall intensity and soil moisture
explained a considerable portion of the variation in runoff
generation; (v) the application of hydromulch was lower
than expected on the larger plots (only a 64% hydromulch
cover as compared with 90% in the smaller plots), despite
both applications having significantly reduced soil losses.
Further research will be needed to determine the effective
ground cover in order to match hydromulch decayment rate
and vegetative cover increase over time, especially to mini-
mize application costs; and (vi) soil losses were similar
across the range of plot sizes studied here (0·25–10 m 2).
This, plus the small size of the plots, indicates that interrill
erosion was the dominant erosion process. Further research
is needed to determine how the effectiveness of hydro-
mulching may vary with increasing slope length when rill
erosion is more likely to occur.

Abstract

The aim of this study is to improve our knowledge of the temporal and spatial variations of soil water repellency following wildfire, in
particular for the eucalypt stands that now dominate the landscape of north-central Portugal.

Topsoil water repellency was monitored on 21 occasions over a 10-month period, starting in September 2005, six weeks after a moderately
severe wildfire. This was done, on mostly alternating dates, in two neighbouring commercial eucalypt plantations, one with an undisturbed and
one with a ploughed soil profile, in the foothills of the Gralheira Massif in north-central Portugal. Water repellency severity was measured in situ
at soil depths of 2–3 and 7–8 cm using the ‘Molarity of an Ethanol Droplet’ (MED) test, and accompanied by soil moisture measurements using a
ThetaProbe™ or, at a few occasions, sample analysis in the laboratory for gravimetric content.

The results show a broadly seasonal pattern of overall very high water repellency in dry periods and reduced or no repellency following prolonged
rainfall. This was more pronounced at the undisturbed compared to the ploughed site, as the latter exhibited strong to extreme water repellency at
almost all sampling dates. Significant changes in repellency severity, including major increases, occurred within periods as short as 6–7 days,
suggesting that the sampling intervals used here may have not captured the full dynamics of topsoil repellency. Repellency severity was consistently
lower at greater soil depth, in particular when considering the whole study period. Soil moisture was found to relate to the temporal variations in
repellency. As found in previous studies, however, soil moisture alone was not sufficient to predict the temporal variations in water repellency.

1. Introduction

The present study was carried out in the framework of a larger
project (EROSFIRE; Keizer et al., 2006, 2007), which aimed at

modelling soil erosion at the slope scale in recently burnt euca-
lypt stands in north-central Portugal. Fire-induced soil water
repellency has been identified in the 1960s as a key factor in
enhanced soil erosion in southern California chaparral following
wildfires (see DeBano, 2000). Fire-induced or -enhanced soil
water repellency is widely regarded as an important factor in
enhanced runoff response and accelerated soil erosion on re-
cently burnt hillslopes (see e.g. DeBano, 2000; Shakesby and
Doerr, 2006). Its relative importance in post-fire catchment
responses, compared to other factors such as litter and vegetation
destruction, however, has remained uncertain (Shakesby and
Doerr, 2006), and its inclusion in soil erosion modelling is still in
its infancy (Miller et al., 2003; Larsen and MacDonald, 2005;
Robichaud et al. 2007).

It is generally accepted that soil water repellency and its
hydrological and erosional impacts tend to be transient, with
repellency often varying between wet and dry seasons and,
where affected by fire, with time since burning (e.g. Doerr et al.,
2000; Shakesby et al., 2000). Determining the patterns of tem-
poral variation in water repellency, however, has been the focus
of relatively few studies. One of the better studied environments
in this context is eucalypt forests. For example, in Australia

Crockford et al. (1991) have provided some insight into the soil
water repellency fluctuations between wet and dry periods, and
Doerr et al. (2006a) have determined inter-annual changes
following burning. In north-central Portugal, Keizer et al.
(2005b,c) and Leighton-Boyce et al. (2005) have monitored
repellency at regular intervals over extended periods. In the
latter study, repellency levels and soil water content were
measured concurrently on the basis that water content is one of

the key variables relating to short-term (days to weeks)
temporal fluctuations in water repellency (Doerr and Thomas,
2000; Dekker et al., 2001).

In the context of fire-affected environments, eucalypt stands
appear to constitute a somewhat unusual case in that very high
water repellency levels have commonly been reported also for
(long-)unburned stands under summer dry conditions in
Australia (Doerr et al. 2006a), South Africa (Scott, 2000) and
Portugal (Doerr et al., 1998). In the latter study, long unburned
stands showed similar repellency levels to recently burned
stands. Thus, for wildfire-affected sites of this type, a major
difficulty lies in attributing the observed post-fire water repel-
lency patterns to a fire-related and/or a fire-independent (i.e.
pre-fire) component. A further complication in these eucalypt
stands is that monitoring temporal repellency patterns is often
limited by the typically rapid post-fire intervention (harvesting,
ploughing). Irrespective of any fire-effects on water repellency
in these eucalypt forests, it is clear that the greatest impact of
water repellency on soil hydrological and erosional response is
in the post-fire period until some protective ground cover is re-
established (Shakesby et al., 2000).

The main aim of the present work was therefore to determine
the variations in soil water repellency in eucalypt stands in
north-central Portugal at two different depths following a
wildfire from shortly after burning to the onset of dry conditions
in the following summer, ten months later. Special consideration
is given to common, but contrasting forest planting practices in
the region by including a ploughed and an unploughed site. Soil
moisture content and antecedent rainfall are explored as poten-
tial factors in explaining the observed variations in repellency.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Study area and sampling sites

The work was carried out in two adjacent commercial tree
plantations in the foothills of the Gralheira Massif in north-
central Portugal (Fig. 1). The two study sites are located at
approximately 40° 42? North, 8° 29? West at an elevation of
60–70 m a.s.l., and are within the Açores locality of the
Albergaria-a-Velha municipality. The sites' slope length, angle
and aspect are presented in Table 1.

The study sites were burnt by a wildfire that occurred in early
July 2005 and affected an area of about 16 km2. The complete
consumption of the litter and herb cover, in conjunction with the
only partial consumption of the shrub layer, suggests that the
fire had been of moderate severity (Shakesby and Doerr, 2006;
see Table 1 for more details). At the time of the fire, the two sites
were – like most of the burnt area – covered with eucalypt trees
(Eucalyptus globulus Ait.) and, judging by the remaining tree
stumps, had experienced at least two prior harvesting and
regrowth cycles. Eucalypt plantations have been introduced
widely in Portugal since the mid 1950s, stimulated by the
demand from cellulose and paper industries (Daveau, 1998;
Radich and Alves, 2000), and now dominate the hills and
mountains of central Portugal. The two sites were selected for
their different land management practices typical for this region.

At Açores1, trees had been planted without heavy mechanical
ground operations, resulting in a relatively undisturbed soil
profile. At Açores2, a clear pattern of ridges and furrows (up to
20 cm high) running down the slope is present. Rip-ploughing
in preparation for planting is a common practice in this region
and, judging by the stand age, would have taken place around
5 years prior to the fire.

The study area is situated at the transition of the region's two
major physiographic units, the Littoral Platform dominated by
Ceno-Mesozoic deposits and the Hesperic Massif dominated by
pre-Ordovician schists and greywackes and Hercynian granites
(Ferreira, 1978; Pereira and FitzPatrick, 1995). The soils of
the area are mapped – at a scale of 1:1.000.000 – as a complex
of Humic Cambisols and, to a lesser extent, Dystric Litosols
(Cardoso et al., 1971, 1973). At both study sites, two soil
profiles were excavated in the middle and at the bottom of the
study slopes. The sites’ soils correspond to Umbric or Dystric
Leptosols (FAO, 1988), depending on the depth of the A
horizon. They are developed over schists and have sandy loam
textures and high organic matter contents (8.8–10.4%) (Lucena,
2006).

The climate of the study area can be characterised as humid
meso-thermal, with a prolonged dry and warm summer
(Köppen Csb) (DRA-Centro, 1998). Mean annual temperature
at the nearest meteorological station, located at circa 17.5 km
from the study sites (Estarreja: 40° 47? N., 8° 35? W., 26 m a.s.
l.; 1956–1977) is 13.9 °C, with monthly means ranging from
8.8 °C in December to 19.1 °C in July (DRA-Centro, 1998).
The nearest rainfall station, located at circa 4 km distance from
the study sites (Albergaria-a-Velha: 40° 42? North, 8° 29? West,
131 m a.s.l.; 1941–1991) has an average annual rainfall of
1229 mm and yearly values varying between 750 and 2022 mm
(DRA-Centro, 1998). The rainfall data used for the study period
were obtained with a tipping-bucket rainfall gauge (Pronamic
Professional Rain Gauge) linked to an ONSET Hobo Event
Logger that was installed at the foot of the Açores1 study site on
September 24 2005. The data prior to this date were obtained
with the same instrumentation at a site at less than 1 km
distance. The locations of the study sites and of the climate and
rainfall station are given in Fig. 1. Monthly rainfall over the
study period, which shows the pronounced seasonal variation,
is also depicted in Fig. 1. Rainfall from November 2005 to

January 2006 at the study sites was roughly half of the long-
term average of the nearby Albergaria-a-Velha station (i.e. 280
vs. 520 mm).

2.2. Field sampling and data analysis

Over a period of 10 months, starting September 20 2005 and
ending July 24 2006, a total of 1125 field soil water repellency
measurements and 861 accompanying soil moisture readings/
samples were taken, divided more or less equally between the
two study sites. The lower number of soil moisture values arose
from initial soil moisture sensor malfunctioning and the occa-
sional presence of stones, which impeded the insertion of the
sensor into the soil. At both sites, sampling was carried out at 21
occasions separated by intervals of typically two weeks, and
occasionally one, three or four weeks. For logistic reasons, the
two sites could not be sampled on the same dates but had to be
sampled on alternating dates, except on six occasions more
towards the end of this study.

On both sites, sampling was carried out within an area
roughly 30 m wide. This area corresponds to one of the three
slope parts in which the study sites were divided to carry out the
various tasks of the EROSFIRE project (Keizer et al., 2006,
2007). The central slope part was reserved for the installation of
eight erosion plots, whilst the two lateral parts were selected
randomly for either rainfall simulation experiments or the pre-
sent work. On each sampling occasion, a transect was laid out
across the full length of the slope section (see Table 1), starting
at one corner of the area and shifting its location at subsequent
sampling dates by fixed distances of roughly 1 m across the
width of the slope. Along each transect, five sampling points
were selected, except at the last four sampling occasions in June
and July 2006, when only three points were sampled. Thus, the
transects were divided in five (and later three) sections of the
same length, each of which with the sampling point in the
middle.

At each transect point, a grid of 50 cm wide by 60 cm long
and divided in cells of 5 by 5 cm was laid out and soil water
repellency was measured at three fixed points within this grid:
the middle cell and the third cell left and right of it. Where rock
outcrops or tree stumps coincided with these points, measure-
ments were made as close as possible to these points. At each
grid cell, soil water repellency was determined in situ at depths
of 2–3 and 7–8 cm in order to provide direct comparability with
soil moisture values obtained for these depths (see below).
Water repellency severity was measured using the ‘Molarity of
an Ethanol Droplet’ (MED) test (e.g. King, 1981; Doerr, 1998).
This involved applying three droplets of increasing ethanol
concentration to fresh parts of the soil surface until infiltration
of at least two of three droplets of the same concentration
occurred within 5 s. Test results are given as median ethanol
concentrations (vol.%) and associated median concentration
classes. These are given in Table 2, together with corresponding
molarity of ethanol and surface tension (?) values, which are
included as a look-up table for comparison of the present results
with those of studies presenting molarity or surface tension
values. Repellency measurements were normally followed

by in situ volumetric soil moisture determinations using an
ML2 ThetaProbe™ connected to a HH2 ThetaMeter (Delta T-
Devices Ltd.), except where the presence of stones did not allow
insertion of the probe. The probe was inserted horizontally into
the soil at 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depth, using the hole dug for the
purpose of the repellency measurements. 5 cm is the minimum
soil depth required to acquire moisture data given the spacing of
the probe’s prongs. For the first three (Açores1) or four
(Açores2) sampling occasions, due to technical problems with
the probe, three samples were taken for determining soil mois-
ture content gravimetrically by drying at 105 °C for 24 h and
converting this to volumetric estimates based on Saxton et al.
(1986) for saturated soil moisture content and Costa (1999) for
specific density.

Statistical analyses were carried out using STATISTICA for
Windows Release 5.5, by StatSoft Inc., except for the “runs test
above and below the median” which was computed manually
following Sokal and Rohlf (1981) and Rohlf and Sokal (1981).
Since the ethanol concentrations utilised in the MED test do not
correspond to an ordinal scale with a constant measurement
unit, rank-based descriptive statistics and non-parametric sta-
tistical tests using the ethanol classes were used. Comparison-
wise type I errors ? were computed for the multiple, unplanned
comparisons between water repellency measurements of sub-
sequent sampling dates (Table 4), and of median ethanol classes
and median soil moisture contents with antecedent rainfall
amounts (Table 7). This was done following the Dunn–Šidák
method (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981).

The independence of the soil water repellency and soil
moisture values obtained for a certain sampling depth and date
was tested using the “runs test above and below the median”
(see Sokal and Rohlf, 1981). The three measurements at the
three to five transect points were arrayed in their natural order of
increasing numbering of transect and grid point numbers.
Whenever a series of values differed significantly from a ran-
dom sequence, only the median values of three to five transect
points were retained for further analysis and, thus, considered to
constitute the individual measurements. A lack of independence
was detected more frequently in the case of the moisture
measurements than the repellency measurements, i.e. in 17 and
11 instances out of 84, respectively. The latter can be identified

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Temporal variations in water repellency

Overall water repellency levels of the near-surface samples
are dominated throughout the 10-month measurement period by
very strong to extreme severity (ethanol classes 6 to 8; Fig. 2).
High levels of soil water repellency under Eucalyptus spp.
stands have previously been reported: (i) in the region for fire-
affected soils of similar texture (Shakesby et al, 1993; Coelho
et al., 2005) and for unburned eucalypt stands on coastal dune
sand (Keizer et al., 2005a, c); (ii) from their native Australia
(e.g. Burch et al., 1989; Crockford et al., 1991); and (iii) other
areas such as northern and southern Africa (e.g. Scott, 1993;
Coelho et al., 2005) and north-western Spain (e.g. Varela et al.,
2005; Rodríguez-Alleres et al., 2007b).

At both sampling depths, overall repellency levels are higher
for the ploughed (Açores2) than the unploughed (Açores1) site
(ethanol classes 8 and 7 vs. 6 and 5). According to Shakesby
et al. (1993), deep-ploughing can render previously hydro-
phobic soils hydrophilic. The higher repellency levels at the
ploughed site suggest that the effect of ploughing in lowering
water repellency does not last for more than the 4 to 5 years that

have passed since the ploughing of this site. Broadly in line with
the present results, Doerr et al. (1996) found similar repellency
values for air-dried surface samples from an undisturbed euca-
lypt site and from one that had been ploughed six years before.
In a later study, Doerr et al. (1998) found that the effect of
ploughing could be as short-lived as two years, in particular
locally around young eucalypt trees. In a more detailed study in
the same region, Leighton-Boyce et al. (2005) suggested that a
period as short as six months could be sufficient for the wide-
spread development of water repellency from the soil surface up
to a depth of 20 cm.

Notwithstanding the overall predominance of very strong to
extreme median repellency levels, non-repellent median condi-
tions occur on six (Açores1) and three (Açores2) occasions
(Fig. 2), corroborating the transient nature of topsoil water
repellency reported from burnt and unburned eucalypt stands
(e.g. Crockford et al., 1991; Doerr and Thomas, 2000; Coelho
et al., 2005; Keizer et al., 2005a). The most straightforward
temporal pattern of water repellency (median ethanol class
values) is evident for the upper sampling depth of the un-
ploughed (Açores1) site. Its median repellency levels are very
strong to extreme before January 2006 and after April 2006, and
non-repellent from February to April 2006. This pattern agrees
reasonably well with the broadly seasonal cycle of low re-
pellency frequency during wet winter conditions and greatest
repellency frequency in late summer that Leighton-Boyce et al.

(2005) reported for burnt and unburned eucalypt stands, despite
the below average rainfall received during the study period (see
Section 2). Similar rainfall-related seasonal patterns in soil
water repellency have also been suggested for other vegetation
types (see review by Doerr et al., 2000). The ploughed
(Açores2) site presents a somewhat contrasting situation, with
non-repellent median conditions being restricted to only two
sampling dates (March 20 and May 2 2006). A similar brief
intermission of mostly wettable soil has also been reported for
an unburned eucalypt stand but its brevity was considered
somewhat atypical and due to unusually low rainfall (Keizer
et al., 2005c).

The present results, supported by findings in Keizer et al.
(2005c) in which similar sampling intervals were used, reveal
that major changes in repellency levels can occur within a
period of a few weeks. Changes of five or more ethanol classes
are common, occurring between three and five times at each of
the two sampling depths at both sites and occurring mostly
simultaneously at the two depths of each site. These simul-
taneous major changes occur on three subsequent occasions, i.e.
between December 19 2005 and February 6 2006 in the case of
unploughed (Açores1) site, and between March 20 and May 8
2006 in the case of the ploughed (Açores2) site. The statistical
significance of these and other changes is addressed in Section
3.2. Relatively rapid increases in water repellency under euca-
lypts have previously been reported by Keizer et al. (2005b: 3–
4 weeks) and Leighton-Boyce et al. (2005: 22 days) and
Crockford et al. (1991: 6–9 days). In the latter study, however,
initial repellency levels had not been quantified. The fact that
changes from non-repellent to extreme repellent conditions
occur over such short time intervals implies that an adequate
description of the temporal dynamics of water repellency under
field conditions requires frequent sampling, especially during
soil wetting and drying phases. This would be best achieved
by a non-destructive measurement technique, which, ideally,
would also be applicable during rainfall events as also advo-
cated by Leighton-Boyce et al. (2005). Such a technique is
currently not available and frequent field visits using destructive
sampling techniques thus remain the best available option. With
respect to the results of the current study, the dramatic changes
between subsequent sampling dates imply that caution is re-
quired in comparing the data from the two sites as their sam-
pling dates were not identical.

Two of the four temporal patterns in Fig. 2 correspond to time
series that differ significantly from random sequences (Table 3).
They are that of the upper sampling depth of the unploughed
(Açores1) site and that of the lower sampling depth of the
ploughed (Açores2) site. Fig. 3 clearly shows that the two non-
random patterns are rather distinct. That of the unploughed site
reveals two periods with “equal and above median” values
(before January 2006 and after April 2006), whereas that of the
ploughed site reveals just a single period with “equal and above
median” values (before March 2006). In other words, the test
results seem to imply that water repellency breaks down earlier
and, thus, more readily to “below-median” levels at the un-
ploughed than ploughed site (January vs. March 2006). Re-
pellency also restores earlier and, thus, more readily to prior
“above-median” levels at the unploughed than ploughed site
(May vs. after July 2006). This earlier recovery, however, does
not coincide with noticeably higher median repellency values at
the ploughed than unploughed site from May 2006 onwards. The
earlier fall in median repellency levels at the unploughed site
constitutes the most conspicuous difference with the ploughed
site. This difference could be related to greater water losses at the
ploughed site through: (i) enhanced overland flow, channelled
downslope through the furrows, as found by Ferreira et al.
(2000); and/or (ii) accelerated preferential infiltration, through
cracks resulting from the destruction of the soil profile, as sug-
gested by e.g. Scott (2000).

Although the temporal pattern of the upper sampling depth at
Açores2 (Fig. 2) appears quite similar to that of the site’s lower
depth, it is not significantly different from a random series
(Table 3). This is due to the fact that none of the individual
values is “above the overall median value (Fig. 3), thereby

hampering the respective runs test. The number of individual
values that is equal to the overall median value (and, thus, does
not contribute to the runs) is also high in three of the other runs
tests in Table 3. This, together with the large number of ties in
other statistical tests (Tables 4 and 5), suggests the need for a

more extended repellency measurement scale for studies in
eucalypt stands. Indeed a higher concentration (50%) has
already been introduced in the recent study by Leighton-Boyce
et al. (2005). This, however, has to be balanced against the
increased demand in terms of the additional effort and sampling
space required.

3.2. Temporal patterns of spatial variability

The spatial variation in repellency at the different sampling
dates, expressed here by the inter-quartile ranges of the indi-
vidual ethanol class values, is shown in Fig. 4 for both study
sites and both sampling depths. In all four cases, spatial vari-
ability varies substantially throughout the sampling period, with
inter-quartile ranges covering the entire or almost entire span of
ethanol class values from zero to eight.

The temporal patterns in inter-quartile ranges (Fig. 4) are
more complex than those in median levels (Fig. 2). The upper
sampling depth of the unploughed site (Açores1) is an excep-
tion, with spatial variability being low (?1) before mid January
2006 (except on December 5 2005) and, again, after April 2006.
According to the “runs test above and below the median”,
however, none of the four temporal patterns differs significantly
from a random series (Table 3). The relationship between spatial
variability and median levels of repellency is also not straight-

forward. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients (rho=
?0.09, 0.25, ?0.40 and ?0.20 for the upper and lower sampling
depths of Açores1 and Açores2, respectively) do not differ
significantly from zero (at ?=0.05) for any of the two sites and
depths. Furthermore, extreme median severity levels can be
equally associated with high or low spatial variability, and so
can non-repellent median levels. This is particularly well il-
lustrated by the lower sampling depth of the ploughed site and
the upper sampling depth of the unploughed site. In the latter
case, for example, on November 21 and December 5 2005
median ethanol classes are 8 and inter-quartile ranges are 0.5
and 5, whereas on March 13 and April 3 2006 median ethanol
classes are 0 and inter-quartile ranges are 7 and 0.5.

The results obtained here confirm earlier observations in
burnt and unburned eucalypt stands that repellency can be
spatially homogeneous (e.g. Doerr et al. 1998, 2006a; Keizer
et al., 2005c). Even though (largely) uniform conditions –
extremely repellent but also wettable – are not exceptional in
the current study, transitional states between these two extremes
prevail. An adequate descriptor of the various states-of-repel-
lency would ideally combine overall repellency level and de-
gree of spatial variability, in view of their distinct temporal
patterns and poor correlation. Even though such a combined
index would not take into account the spatial organisation of
repellent patches per se, it would also be useful for analysing

Fig. 4. Temporal variation in inter-quartile ethanol class ranges at 2–3 and 7–8 cm depth on the two study sites.

repellency’s spatial contiguity and the associated effects in
terms of repellency enhancing overland flow and erosion risk,
as postulated by Shakesby et al. (2000).

The spatial variability explains why only half of the above-
mentioned major changes in median ethanol classes correspond
to statistically significant differences (Table 4). This propor-
tion is higher for the ploughed (Açores1) than unploughed
(Açores2) site, i.e. six out of nine as opposed to two out of seven.
Five of these six differences at the unploughed site coincide with
the above-mentioned three simultaneous major changes at the
two sampling depths, i.e. the drops between December 19 2005
and January 9 2006 and between January 23 and February 6
2006 as well as the intermittent rise. The two significant and
major differences at the ploughed site also occur simultaneously
at the two depths but they concern the rise between May 2 and
May 8 2006 and not the antecedent reductions.

The seasonal fall in water repellency in winter is rather
distinct at the two sites. Not only does it occur later at the
ploughed than unploughed site but it is also less well-defined
statistically. That the winter reduction at the ploughed site is
masked statistically by a more pronounced spatial variability
tallies with non-uniform infiltration and, as mentioned before,
profile disturbance by ploughing. On the other hand, the lower
sampling depth of the unploughed site equally reveals an initial
major fall that is not statistically significant, probably associated
with to the high inter-quartile range on December 5 2005 in
particular.

In contrast to the winter reduction in repellency, the spring
re-establishment to prolonged repellent conditions is remark-
ably similar for the two sites as well as the two sampling depths.
It occurs at roughly the same period (i.e. between April 18 and
May 8 2006) and involves statistically significant changes in all
four cases, even in that of the lower sampling depth of the
unploughed (Açores1) site where the difference amounts to
just three ethanol classes. The spring re-establishment at the
ploughed (Açores2) site is worth further reference for involving
a period as short as six days (May 2 to 8 2006). This agrees well
with the 6–9 days suggested, as referred earlier, by Crockford
et al. (1991). A similarly short period of seven days is involved
in the statistically significant change at the upper sampling
depth of the unploughed (Açores1) site between May 8 and 15
2006 but this concerns a decrease and just a minor one of only
one ethanol class. These three instances of rapid significant
changes further substantiate the earlier observation that even a
comparatively intensive monitoring scheme as applied in this
study may not capture the complete temporal dynamics of water
repellency.

From the 13 statistically significant differences listed in
Table 4, four correspond to particularly minor changes in me-
dian repellency levels of just one ethanol class. All four are
restricted to the upper sampling depths and involve low spatial
variability at both of the sampling dates under comparison.
Also, the differences occur roughly simultaneously at the two
sites and, in each period, have the same sign. Whereas the
decrease at the unploughed site between May 8 and 15 2006
was already mentioned in the previous paragraph, that at the
ploughed site occurs between May 8 and 22 2006 and, thus,

equally after the spring re-establishment to prolonged repellent
conditions. The other two changes occur in the initial phase of
this study, between September 26 and October 10 2005 at the
unploughed site, and between October 3 and 17 2005 at the
ploughed (Açores2) site. They could indicate a gradual
recovery of subsurface repellency following its (partial)
destruction by the wildfire or, alternatively, a gradual increase
in pre-fire repellency following downward translocation of
hydrophobic substances from the burned/heated overlying litter
and topsoil (see e.g. DeBano, 2000). The former hypothesis is
perhaps less likely for the lower than upper sampling depth, also
because of the moderate severity of the wildfire. In eucalypt
stands, the removal of topsoil repellency during burning has
been reported to a depth of 3 cm by Scott (1993) and of 5 cm by
Doerr et al. (2006a), with a well-documented role of fire
severity in the latter case. While Scott (1993) did not find
conclusive evidence for intensification of repellency at greater
soil depths, such evidence was found in the study by Doerr et al.
(2006a) and in studies examining other vegetation types (e.g.
Huffman et al., 2001; Mataix-Solera and Doerr, 2004; Hubbert
and Oriol, 2005).

3.3. Water repellency variation with soil depth

At both study sites, the temporal patterns in median ethanol
classes at the two sampling depths are strongly correlated. The
Spearman rank correlation coefficient is 0.71 and significantly
different from zero at ?=0.01 for both sites. However, as evident
in Fig. 2, the median ethanol classes at the upper sampling depth
tend to be systematically higher from those at the lower depth.
According to the Wilcoxon’s Signed-Ranks Test (and notwith-
standing the considerable numbers of ties (9 and 12)), this
tendency is statistically significant (at ?=0.05) for both study
sites (Z=2.59 and 2.00 for Açores1 and Açores2, respectively).

The Wilcoxon’s Signed-Ranks Test was also used to
compare the two sampling depths on the individual sampling
dates (Table 5). In agreement with the results mentioned in
the previous paragraph, all six instances of statistically
significant differences involve higher ethanol classes at the
upper than lower sampling depth. They include three of the
four differences in median repellency values that amount to
three or more ethanol classes, i.e. on May 8 and July 24
2006 at the Açores1 and on June 19 2006 at the Açores2. The
fourth of these larger differences (Açores1, December 5 2005)
is by the far largest comprising eight ethanol classes, but it is
exceptional in involving pronounced spatial variability at both
sampling depths. The remaining three depth-related and
statistically significant differences (Açores1, November 21
and December 19 2005; Açores2, May 8 2006) concern
differences in median ethanol classes ranging from two down
to zero. All three cases, however, typically involve an upper
sampling depth with extreme and homogeneous water
repellency conditions.

It is not clear if the observed tendency for less severe
repellency at greater depth can be attributed to the wildfire, in
particular through a decreased influx of hydrophobic
substances with depth or a decreasing degree of heat-induced

structural alteration of organic compounds already present
(Doerr et al., 2006a). In (long-)unburned soils under
eucalypts, decreasing occurrence and/or severity of repellency
with increasing depth has been reported in a range of studies,
for example, in South Africa (Scott, 2000), Australia (Doerr
et al., 2006a) or Spain (Rodríguez-Alleres et al., 2007a),
whereas little or no differences between depths were found in
Portugal by Leighton-Boyce et al. (2005: 10 vs. 20 cm depth)

and Keizer et al. (2005a,b: 2–3 vs. 7–8 cm depth). Evidence
from burnt soils under eucalypts is even scarcer, but equally
inconsistent. In studies in Portugal, Doerr et al. (1996)
reported a lack of consistent patterns and Leighton-Boyce et
al. (2005) observed no substantial differences between 10 and
20 cm depth. In burnt sites in Australia, however, Doerr et al.
(2006a) reported a substantially higher frequency of wettable
samples at 0–2 than 2–5 cm depth.

3.4. Relationship of soil water repellency with soil moisture
and antecedent rainfall

Fig. 5 depicts the median volumetric soil moisture values
of the individual sampling dates for both sites and sampling
depths. In agreement with the commonly reported inverse rela-
tionship between soil water repellency and soil moisture (see
review by Doerr et al., 2000), overall soil moisture levels
at both sampling depths are higher at the overall less repel-
lent unploughed than ploughed site (5.9 vs. 5.2% and 9.6 vs.
7.1 vol.%). Accordingly, they are lower at the upper than lower
soil depth at both sites (5.9 vs. 9.6 and 5.2 vs. 7.1 vol.%). As for
water repellency, median moisture values at the two sampling
depths are, throughout the study period, strongly correlated
(Spearman's rho=0.80 for Açores1 and 0.81 for Açores2;
psb0.01) as well as systematically different (Wilcoxon's
Signed-Ranks Test Z=3.49 for Açores1 and 3.93 for Açores2;
psb0.01).

At the level of the individual measurements, the above-
mentioned inverse relationship of water repellency with mois-
ture content is statistically significant for both study sites and
both sampling depths (Table 6). At both sites, the correlation is
noticeably stronger for the lower than upper sampling depth but,
at each depth, it differs little between the two sites. The median
values of the sampling dates, however, reveal a significant
monotonic correlation for the two sampling depths at Açores1,
but not at Açores2 (Table 6). Especially for the upper Açores2

depth, the coefficients are rather distinct for the two data sets.
The particularly weak correlation for the median values seems
to correspond to some sampling artefact (involving a strong
skew towards high median ethanol classes in a small sample)
rather than to indicate some location-specific repellency–mois-
ture relationship. Such a specific relationship is neither sug-
gested by the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for all
84 median values (rho=?0.51; pb0.01), nor is it evident from
Fig. 6.

For eucalypt soils, a broad inverse relationship between
water repellency and moisture content, as found here, is
perhaps more commonly accepted than substantiated.
Whereas some datasets are consistent with such relationship
(Walsh et al., 1994; Coelho et al., 2005; Keizer et al., 2005a),
others are not (Crockford et al., 1991; Ferreira et al., 2005;
Rodríguez-Alleres et al., 2007a). The most detailed previous
studies in Portugal (Doerr and Thomas, 2000; Leighton-
Boyce et al., 2005) and elsewhere (Dekker et al. 2001; Doerr
et al, 2006b) reported a general association of wettable soil
conditions with moist soil status and high repellency with dry
soil, but also suggest soil moisture alone is insufficient to
explain temporal fluctuations in water repellency. The current
study supports these findings and demonstrates that this
applies equally to unburned and recently burnt eucalypt
stands. A transition zone, rather than a distinct threshold
demarcating wettable and repellent conditions (Dekker et al.,
2001; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2005), can also be detected in
the data obtained here (Fig. 6), especially at Açores1. For this
site, the transition zone encompasses a narrower soil moisture
range (9–11 vol.%) than in the case of Leighton-Boyce et
al.’s mature eucalypt site (14–27 vol.%).

Fig. 5 also shows the cumulative rainfall amounts over the
14-day periods preceding the sampling dates. This 14-day pe-
riod was chosen over shorter periods for presenting, on overall,
the best correlation with median soil moisture values (Table 7).
It is worth noting, however, that none of the Spearman's rank
correlation coefficients in Table 7 is significantly different from
zero when the multiple-comparison correction following the
Dunn–Šidák method is taken into consideration. Overall, it is
clear that median ethanol class values correspond better to
median soil moisture contents than to antecedent rainfall. This
is to be expected since, in addition to water repellency,

spatial variability in rainfall, interception, evapotranspiration
and preferential flow will determine how much rainfall is
available to ultimately penetrate the soil matrix.

It is therefore not surprising that the existing findings on the
relationship of water repellency with antecedent rainfall for
eucalypt stands show even less consistency than those for the
repellency–soil moisture relationship. Thus, Keizer et al.
(2005b) found a monotonic correlation for repellency at 2–
3 cm below the soil surface, which is comparable (i.e. statis-
tically significant at ?=0.05) to that reported here with soil
moisture content, whereas Leighton-Boyce et al. (2005) re-
ported an only very generalised relationship with antecedent
rainfall totals. In the present case, the poor relationship is well
illustrated by Açores1, where four subsequent 2-week periods
of 50–100 mm and a total of 300 mm rainfall do not result in a
significant decrease in repellency, but 65 mm of rain precede the
distinct reduction in repellency in early January. Clearly other
factors such as rainfall intensity, temperature, microbial activity
and other seasonally variable factors may play a role in deter-
mining temporal changes in water repellency.

4. Conclusions

The main conclusions arising from this study concerning the
temporal variation in water repellency as measured for in situ
topsoil of two recently burnt eucalypt stands on steep hillslopes
in north-central Portugal are as follows.

– Overall severity levels of soil water repellency reveal broad-
ly seasonal variations, however, specific temporal patterns in
spatial variability are more irregular and poorly related to
overall levels. Therefore, overall levels alone are not suf-
ficient to assess the likely impact of repellency on soil
hydrological behaviour.

– Statistically significant increases and decreases in repellency
severity were detected over time intervals as short as 6–
7 days, suggesting that a higher sampling frequency than that
used here is required to fully capture the temporal dynamics
of soil water repellency in this environment.

– The ploughed and unploughed sites show perceptible
differences in their overall levels of repellency and its
temporal variations. Although ploughing has been shown to
destroy repellency by mixing repellent and wettable soil, the
site ploughed 4–5 years ago shows overall similar or greater
levels of repellency than the unploughed site examined here.

– It is not clear whether burning had any effect on water
repellency levels at the two soil depths examined in this
study. The decrease of water repellency with depth is similar
to those reported from unburnt forests examined elsewhere.

– Soil moisture content is a better predictor for water repel-
lency levels than antecedent rainfall, however, its value for
predicting repellency occurrence is limited.

7. Overall discussion and general conclusions 

7.1 Overall runoff and erosion rates 

 

This research provides an understanding into post-fire runoff and soil erosion, at the 

micro- and small- plot scales, related with different pre- and post- fire land management 

operations under natural and artificial rainfall. The research was carried out in six 

eucalyptus plantations and in one pine plantation.  

The maximum and minimum plot values of runoff and specific sediment losses, during 

two years following the wildfire highlighted the effects of: (i) land use (pine vs. eucalypt); 

(ii) pre-fire ploughing and (iii) application of the hydromulch treatment (Chapter7, Figure 

5). The land use had an effect on runoff production (runoff coefficient of 22% on the two 

eucalypt sites vs. 56% on the pine site) but it was not a key factor in post-fire erosion risk 

(415 g m-2 for the unploughed eucalypt vs. 549 g m-2 for the pine site). At the eucalypt 

sites, the ploughing did not influence overland flow generation, whereas there were 

marked differences on the erosion response (415 g m-2 for the unploughed compared to 

125 g m-2 on the pre-fire down-slope ploughed). Additionally, at the pine site, the 

hydromulch significantly reduced both variables, whereas plot size (0.25, 0.5, 10 m2) did 

not have significant differences in the hydrological or soil erosion response. Invariably, the 

pine treated plots generated the lowest runoff amounts but only similar specific sediment 

losses compared to the down-slope ploughed eucalypt site. 

Lower hydrological and soil erosion response in pine compared to eucalypt stands 

had been reported earlier in North-Central Portugal (Prats et al., 2012; Shakesby et al., 

1996). It was attributed to lower soil water repellency levels and to the presence of a pine 

needle “carpet”. Actually, overall soil water repellency levels at the untreated pine site 

were much lower than at the eucalypt sites (median “0” ethanol class vs. median “7” 

ethanol class, respectively; Figure 6) but those lower repellency levels did not produce 

lower runoff generation. In addition, the logging at the pine site caused the removal of the 

protective litter cover (mean litter cover 5% just after logging). The few studies that have 

monitored the first post-fire year runoff and sediment losses, on unlogged pine sites in 

Portugal (Table 2; Prats et al., 2012; Ferreira et al., 2008 and Shakesby et al., 1996), 

found lower runoff coefficient (6-16% versus 56%) and sediment losses (38-220 vs. 302 g 

m-2) than the Colmeal pine site. In fact, these studies differed mainly in soil cover (they 

reported more than 50% of needle carpet), which could reflect a difference in the

monitored time since fire, in fire intensity or in the disturbance caused by logging. 

Probably due to logging, the pine site had higher runoff coefficient and sediment losses 

than previous Portuguese studies but lower rates compared to other studies outside the 

Mediterranean region (Shakesby, 2011). In agreement with the soil cover importance in 

reducing runoff and sediment losses, the hydromulching effectiveness was attributed to 

the increase of soil cover. The present study results coincided with other experiments with 

post-fire mulch (Prats et al., 2012; Bautista et al., 1996; Shakesby et al., 1996).

Overall discussion and general conclusions 

155 
 

The post-fire logging activities (manual chain saw + mechanised wood extraction) at 

both pine and eucalypt sites, had a marked impact in increasing sediment losses (Figure 5 

and Figure 7). In fact, increases in the specific sediment losses by plot of 5 to 10-fold were 

described at both logged sites. Fernández et al. (2007) also found that logging operations 

affect soil erosion mainly through changes in the significant exposure of bare soil.  

 

Figure 6. Frequency of topsoil (soil surface + 2-3 cm) water repellency levels at eucalypt (two 

post-fire years) and pine sites (one post-fire year). 

At the eucalypt sites, the contrasting pre-fire soil preparation techniques were not a 

key factor on post-fire hydrological response (Figure 7a). However, the pre-fire ploughed 

areas consistently showed the lowest specific sediment losses figures (below 0.20 g m-2 

mm rain-1); either with natural rainfall, high or extreme intensity simulated rainfall (Figure 

7b). These facts suggested that erosion at the three ploughed sites was sediment limited. 

In a recently rip-ploughed eucalypt site, Shakesby et al., (1994) found specific sediment 

losses as high as 3.27 g m-2 mm-1 rain. They also estimated that sediment losses decline 

rapidly following rip-ploughing due to the formation of a stone lag and the development of 

the protective vegetation and litter cover. The decline in sediment losses could also be 

related with the selective removal of the fine soil fraction by the initial soil erosions events 

(Walsh et al., 1995). However, unequivocal lower fine fraction or higher stone cover in all 

the ploughed compared to the unploughed sites was not observed. The time elapsed 

since ploughing (as much as 20 years or 2 eucalypt production cycles, judging by the 

remaining tree stumps) could be related with the low sediment rates registered on all the 

ploughed sites. So, sediment exhaustion was probably a consequence of severe initial 

erosion periods which occurred just after ploughing. The recorded sediment exhaustion, 

even under supposedly soil conservation practices (i.e. contour ploughing and terracing)

well describes the threat of this type of land management. Even because, in commercial 

eucalypt stands, ground preparation involving uprooting the old stumps would be needed 

at least every 30-40 years (3-4 eucalypt cycles) (Shakesby et al., 1996) and recently is 

also often done after the fire. This ground preparation usually involves rip-ploughing 

(down-slope or contour) and even slope engineering (terracing), which compromise the 

soil conservation.

In Portugal, post-fire runoff and soil erosion in eucalypt commercial plantations under 

natural rainfall, had been studied with larger plots (16 m2) (Table 2; Prats et al., 2012; 

Thomas et al., 1999 and Shakesby et al., 1996) mainly at unploughed sites. The range of 

runoff generation reported in the former studies (6-30%) can be compared to both

eucalypt sites (22%, Figure 5). However, the specific sediment losses range (0.07-0.33 g 

m2 mm-1 rain) can only be compared with the most erosive unploughed site (0.40 g m2 mm-

1 rain), while the ploughed site (0.12 g m2 mm-1 rain) corresponded to their minimum 

range. These results can suggest either that our measurements were comparatively low 

(plot size effect) or that our results can be compared. In the latter case, rill erosion did not 

take place on their 16 m2 plots, inter-rill erosion being the main process in all the three 

studies. Outside Portugal, other post-fire studies carried out using 8 m2 plots in burnt 

eucalypts stands in Australia showed higher erosion rates. Dragovich and Morris (2002) 

and Blong et al. (1982) found specific sediment losses of 0.39 g m-2mm-1 rain to 1.08 g m-

2mm-1 rain (Table 2). Only the unploughed site values can be compared to their minimum 

range, although comparison is limited by differences in historic land use and the wild 

nature of eucalypt forest in Australia.  

RSE’s in burnt eucalypt stands in Portugal were done only in one study by Leighton-

Boyce et al., (2007). They used a similar set up as here (100 mm h-1 applied rainfall 

intensity in a ploughed site), although their study was done in a single moment after fire 

instead of the repeated RSE’s approach used in the present thesis. The runoff coefficient 

reported by them (70 %) was 2-4 times higher than the measured range at the ploughed 

sites (15- 49 %), but their specific sediment losses (0.63 g m-2 mm-1 rain) were 5-10 times 

higher than the present study values (0.04 -0.15 g m-2 mm-1 rain; Table 2). Other RSE’s 

studies in Portugal were done at pine sites (Ferreira et al., 2005a; Coelho et al., 2004 and 

Walsh et al., 1998) also in a unique moment after fire. Their runoff coefficients were 

comparable to the present study values (5-65%) but in terms of sediment losses, they 

showed much higher values than those registered at the unploughed and unploughed + 

logged sites (0.3 to 1.67 g m-2mm-1 rain vs. 0.31 -0.39 g m-2mm-1 rain; Table 2). Repeated 

RSE’s after wildfires were carried out in Australia in eucalypt forests (Sheridan et al., 

2007; during three years) and in Aleppo Pine in Eastern Spain (Cerdà and Doerr, 2005; 

during 11 years). To allow comparison, their results for the two first post-fire years have 

been summarized in Table 2. Although runoff generation between studies was 

comparable, even the highest specific sediment losses registered at the unploughed sites 

(0.4 g m-2mm-1 rain) were three times and roughly twelve times lower than the highest 

ones measured by Cerdà and Doerr, 2005 (1.32 g m-2mm-1 rain)  and Sheridan et al., 

2007 (4.88 g m-2mm-1 rain ) respectively. 

To summarize, the low recorded erosion rates coincide with the generally lower 

Mediterranean erosion rates as compared to other areas. This is mainly attributed to the 



Overall discussion and general conclusions 

159 
 

high soil stoniness, shallow soils as well as long intensive land use (Shakesby 2011, 

Cerdan et al., 2010). The lower erosion rates do not necessarily mean that erosion is a 

lesser threat for the soil resource, as the soil is already thin, any additional loss may be 

considered detrimental (Cerdan et al., 2010).  

On other hand, the organic matter fraction on the eroded sediments was high (40-60 

%) when compared with its content on the top soil (5-10 %); independently of land use, 

pre and post-fire management, and measurement technique. The bulk of the studies do 

not present separate data on mineral and organic matter losses. However, Prats et al., 

(2012), Thomas et al., (1999) and Fernández et al., (2007) also found high organic matter 

losses (40-50 %). These high values can be related to moderate fire severity; once that 

the incomplete combustion could allow the presence of substantial amounts of charcoal 

over the soil surface. Furthermore, high organic matter contents in the sediments seemed 

to be consistent with low soil losses (Fernández et al., 2007). The large fraction of organic 

matter not only compromises the soil fertility, but also has consequences for off-site 

pollution (Campos et al., 2012; Vila-Escalé et al., 2007).

Overall discussion and general conclusions

7.2 Temporal patterns in runoff and erosion  

 

A decline in post-fire runoff and sediment rates within the “window of disturbance” is 

generally assumed. The decreasing rates are due to the transition from transport- to 

sediment-limited erosion typically reported by post-fire erosion studies (see Shakesby, 

2011; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). The temporal variability had also been associated with 

inter and intra-annual rainfall variability and post-fire vegetation recovery (Shakesby et al., 

1993; 1994, 1996). Independently of the land use, soil preparation technique and 

measurement methodology, the observed temporal patterns (two post-fire years) did not 

correspond to a simple decrease with time, but had a marked seasonal component.  As a 

result, higher runoff coefficient and specific sediment losses values surrounding the driest 

seasons were observed. During these periods, at both eucalypt and pine sites, the weekly 

runoff and specific sediment losses were as high as the initial values measured 

immediately after the wildfire (see Chapter 2, 3, 4 and 5; Figures 3, 6, 4 and 5 and 3, 

respectively). The temporal patterns in the pine hydromulched plots were somewhat 

similar, but with smaller amplitudes. On the other hand, the hydromulch effectiveness to 

reduce runoff and sediment losses lasted for three post-fire years. Although the 

hydromulch cover decayed after the second winter, it was compensated for the vegetation 

recovery. At both logged sites, the logging disturbance impact over the sediment losses 

was larger than the time since fire. So, just after logging the specific sediment losses 

increased sharply, but two years after the fire the specific sediment losses reached similar 

figures to just after fire. Since RSE’s avoid the variability of natural rainfall, they were 

useful to compare results obtained at different moments in time after fire. The two prior 

studies that also employed repeated RSE’s to study post-fire runoff and erosion (Cerdà 

and Doerr, 2005; Sheridan et al., 2007), reported pronounced decreases in inter-rill 

erosion rates with time-since-fire. The decrease in overland flow and erodibility was 

related to the degree and type of vegetation cover as well as its influence over the soil 

hydrophobicity (Cerdà and Doerr, 2005). Equally, the repeated RSE’s carried out at six 

eucalypt sites confirmed the fact that time had a significant influence over the runoff and 

erosion response. However, RSE’s executed two years after the fire measured specific 

sediment losses as high as the initial RSE’s.  

Consequently, for all seven sites and measurement techniques a risk of enhanced 

runoff and erosion response was observed two years after the fire, probably due to the 

soil water repellency effect increasing runoff generation and the observed slow and

sparse post-fire vegetation recovery (mean vegetation cover two years after the fire was 

28 % for untreated pine plots and about 40 % for the eucalypt sites).  

 

7.3 Key factors explaining runoff and erosion 

 

Overland flow generation analysis, and the role therein of several factors, represented 

a focus since the total sediment losses of the 132 RSE’s, as well as the eucalypt and pine 

natural rainfall plots (n=1584), were strongly correlated to runoff volumes (Spearman's 

rank correlation coefficient 0.90–0.95; p &amp;lt;0.01).  

Multiple regression models for the weekly runoff measurements under natural rainfall, 

in the eucalypt (Chapter 4; Table 5) and in the untreated pine plots (Chapter 5; Table 4), 

revealed that rainfall amount was the main factor explaining runoff generation. This was 

followed by surface cover factors (litter, ash, vegetation) related either to an increase in 

the resistance to flow and or the interception capacity (Smets et al, 2008). A shift in the 

first descriptor from rainfall amount toward rainfall intensity was detected as surface cover 

increases over the plots. Differences between the partial regression models of the 

unploughed and down slope ploughed (with higher protective surface cover) eucalypt 

sites, as well as untreated and hydromulched plots highlighted that shift. Prats et al., 

(2012) described the same alteration on the first descriptor between eucalypt and pine 

plots (with high needle carpet cover) regression models. Equally, Vega et al., (2005) over 

plots with high vegetation cover (37% immediately after a prescribed fire) found rainfall 

energy (accumulated kinetic energy) to be the main factor for runoff generation.  

The results confirm the effect of the seasonal and spatial variation of soil water 

repellency on runoff generation addressed by other authors in the same region (Prats et 

al., 2012; Malvar et al., 2011; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007; Keizer 2005a; Ferreira et al., 

2000). However, this effect on runoff generation is not consistent. The overall soil water 

repellency levels alone are not sufficient to assess the whole impact of repellency. 

Actually, the runoff coefficient was lower at the more hydrophobic eucalypt sites 

(frequency of not wettable measurements 70-80 %) compared to the untreated pine plots 

(frequency of not wettable measurements 20-40 %), (Figure 5 and Figure 6). Despite that, 

the regression model indicated that soil water repellency explained better runoff 

generation at the more hydrophobic sites. Soil water repellency represented the second 

factor explaining runoff variation (11%) at the eucalypt sites, whereas at the pine site was

detected only through the negative sign in the soil moisture parameter estimate. At the 

eucalypt sites, further insight on the soil water repellency role was provided through the 

partial models of runoff generation under different repellency conditions. As the soil was 

more hydrophobic there was a shift from rainfall intensity to rainfall amount as the main 

factor controlling overland flow. At the same time, the importance in the protective-

interception layer (litter+ ash) was decreasing. As a consequence, under repellent 

conditions, medium rainfall intensity events (I15 = 20 mm h
-1) were able to generate 

enough overland flow to transport sediments even with high protective cover.  

In agreement with previous studies employing repeated RSE’s (Cerdà and Doerr, 

2005; Sheridan et al., 2007), the RSE’s temporal patterns of overland flow cannot be 

attributed only to changes in soil water repellency. The observed changes in overland flow 

generation between RSE’s campaigns coincided well with changes in soil water 

repellency assessed by means and/or with the frequency of extreme repellency (ethanol 

class&gt;7) (see Chapter 3: Figures 6 and 7). However, there were exceptions in which low 

runoff generation was associated to strong soil water repellency levels. This could be 

attributed to the role of antecedent rainfall, enhancing the spatial variability in repellency 

and, thereby, creating opportunities for re-infiltration (e.g. Shakesby et al., 2000; Keizer et 

al., 2005a). This could also be attributed to the fact that the soil water repellency 

measurements were destructive and, thus, were not carried out in the RSE’s plots 

themselves but in neighbouring plots. On the other hand, descriptors such as median 

ethanol class, its range or frequency of a soil water repellency class, might not fully 

capture the hydrological implications of soil water repellency, especially under 

heterogeneous repellency conditions. 

At both eucalypt sites, multiple regression models showed that sediment losses were 

controlled mainly by rainfall intensity followed by litter cover. The relationship of sediment 

losses with runoff generation was represented by the presence of variables that were 

proved to affect runoff (soil water repellency, soil moisture, and ash cover). Previous 

studies have also reported the importance of rainfall intensity in determining post-fire 

sediment losses (Prats et al., 2012; Robichaud et al., 2008; Spigel and Robichaud 2007; 

Vega et al., 2005; Fernandez et al., 2004). In contrast, at the pine site, the first explaining 

factor was always a cover related variable, either organic cover (hydromulch + litter + 

vegetation) or bare soil depending in the treatment specific models. The results enhance 

the importance of increasing the soil cover for a successful control of soil erosion. Bare 

soil exposure related to fire intensity (Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald, 2005) or post-



Assessing the combined effect of land management and wildfire on runoff and soil erosion in north central

166 
 

fire logging operations (Fernández et al., 2007) had previously been found to explain 

sediment losses variability. In agreement with that, the increase after logging in specific 

sediment losses by plot of 5 to 10-fold, at the pine and the eucalypt sites respectively, was 

related to the marked decrease in litter cover after logging disturbance. Although 

increments in sediment losses after clear-cutting had been reported for unburnt forest 

(e.g. Croke et al., 1999; Powers, 2002; Hartanto et al., 2003), the research on post-fire 

logging is less frequent (Fernandez et al., 2007). Independently of the origin (low fire 

intensity, post-fire treatment) the contribution to reducing soil erosion of the cover-related 

variables has already been documented (Bautista et al., 1996; Prats et al., 2012; 

Robichaud et al., 2000; Shakesby et al., 1996; Wagenbrenner et al., 2006). The results 

agree well with those findings highlighting the importance of surface cover variables to 

mitigate post-fire soil erosion. As a consequence, from a soil conservation point of view, 

land managers are strongly encouraged to cautiously carry out logging activities, taking 

into account the importance of keeping the needles and the logging litter over the soil. 

 

7.4 Natural versus simulated rainfall 

 

Natural and simulated rainfall experiment measurements were equal in terms of study 

sites, post-fire monitored period, plot size and plot experimental design (Chapters 2 and 

4). Since total rainfall amount and intensity were very different between both 

methodologies, the absolute runoff and erosion values can hardly be contrasted (Table 3). 

However, relative differences between them were well represented, both natural and 

simulated rainfall results reported that both sites had comparable runoff amounts but the 

sediment losses at the pre-fire ploughed site were significantly lower. On the other hand, 

the organic matter fraction of the eroded sediments was around 40-50%, independently of 

the site and methodology. Once divided by rainfall amount, both techniques results could 

be better assessed. At both sites, the runoff coefficient was consistently higher (roughly 

double) under simulated compared to natural rainfall, possibly reflecting the higher 

simulated rainfall intensity (Table 3). Sediment exhaustion at the ploughed site was 

pointed out as the cause underlying the lack of differences in specific sediment losses 

between natural, extreme and high intensity RSE’s (ca. 0.07 g m2 mm-1 rain) (Figure 8). 

Similarly, sediment exhaustion at the other ploughed eucalypt sites was also recorded by 

the RSE’s erosion results. The specific sediment losses ranged from 0.05 to 0.20 g m2 

mm-1 rain, and varied very little between high and extreme intensity RSE’s (see Figure 



Overall discussion and general conclusions 

167 
 

7b). In contrast, when sediments are available, the extreme intensity RSE’s recorded 

comparatively high sediment losses. So, at the unploughed site the extreme intensity 

RSE’s (0.31 g m2 mm-1 rain) were able to capture similar specific sediment losses 

compared to the natural rainfall plots (0.35 g m2 mm-1 rain) (Figure 8). Equally, extreme 

intensity RSE’s at the logged eucalypt site captured the values recorded with natural 

rainfall plots at the logged pine site (ca. 0.50 g m2 mm-1 rain; see Figure 5b and Figure 

7b).

Other studies reporting post-fire runoff and soil erosion from RSE’s and natural 

rainfall plots were carried out with different objectives than the comparison of 

methodologies. Therefore, high dissimilarities between techniques were present. For 

example, at the burnt pine stands in Portugal, Ferreira et al., 2008 also reported higher 

runoff coefficient but lower sediment losses in RSE’s than in natural rainfall plots. Besides 

inherent differences between methods, the comparison is also restricted by differences in

7.5 Soil water repellency  

 

Soil water repellency measurements were carried out simultaneously during the six 

RSE’s field campaigns in the first and second post-fire years. The different soil 

preparation techniques did not show a clear trend in soil water repellency levels (Figure 

10). Although some caution is required in comparing the data because the sites’ sampling 

dates were not the same, the lack of relationship between the ploughing and soil water 

repellency levels was probably related to the time elapsed since ploughing. In the same 

region, Shakesby et al. (1993) suggested that deep-ploughing can render previously 

hydrophobic soils hydrophilic. Doerr et al. (1998) found that the hydrophilic nature of the 

soil recently ploughed was only temporary (as short as two years) until the planted 

eucalyptus trees grow and provide inputs of hydrophobic substances from the litter and 

root development. Further research in the area suggested that recently rip-ploughed areas 

can become repellent in a period as short as six months (Leighton-Boyce et al., 2005). 

Soil burning could also affect the soil water repellency levels, but the effects of burning 

can be highly variable, depending mainly on the type of organic matter consumed, the soil 

heating and the amount of oxygen available during burning (Doerr et al., 2009a). Besides 

this, eucalypt stands constitute a somewhat unusual case in which the long unburned 

stands can show similar repellency levels compared to the recently burned stands (Doerr 

et al., 1998). On the other hand, since fire severity was classified as moderate in all the 

eucalypt stands, to attribute the observed post-fire water repellency spatial pattern to a 

fire-related component was not possible. Although, wildfire severity was classified through 

the use of simple indicators such as canopy and shrub twigs consumption, ash colour, etc 

(see Chapter 3, Table 1).

logging and unploughed_SI sites. Number of observations is shown in brackets. 

A seasonal cycle of low soil water repellency conditions during the wet winter and 

greater repellency during the dry periods have been reported for unburnt and burnt 

eucalypt plantations in Portugal (Doerr and Thomas 2000; Ferreira et al., 2000; Keizer et 

al., 2005a; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2005; Prats et al., 2012) and for other vegetation types 

around the world (Doerr et al., 2000). All six eucalypt sites showed overall strong to 

extreme soil water repellency median values, but non-repellent conditions also occurred, 

revealing rainfall-related seasonal variations (see Chapter 3; Figure 7). The more frequent 

(2-weekly interval) soil water repellency measurements, at 2-3 and 7-8 cm depth, in the 

unploughed_AI and down-slope ploughed eucalypt site also showed a seasonal pattern 

(see Chapter 6; Figure 2). Although it was not possible to give the precise time required 

for repellency to break down or become re-established, strong changes in repellency level 

were observed within a period of two weeks. At the unploughed_A1 site, spatially 

homogenous transitions, i.e. from entirely extreme repellent (median ethanol class 8; 

inter-quartile range =0) to entirely wettable (median ethanol class 0; inter-quartile range 

=0) occurred within 22 days. The opposite, i.e. change from entirely non-repellent (median 

ethanol class 0; inter-quartile range =0) to entirely extreme repellent conditions (median 

ethanol class 8; inter-quartile range =0) occurred within 15 days. It appears that non-

spatially homogenous re-establishment of soil water repellency was even shorter (6 days). 

Relatively rapid changes in water repellency under eucalypts have previously been 

reported by Keizer et al. (2005b: 3–4 weeks) and Leighton-Boyce et al. (2005: 22 days) 

and Crockford et al. (1991: 6–9 days). The rapid change over such short time intervals 

implies that an adequate description of the temporal dynamics of water repellency under 

field conditions requires frequent sampling, especially during soil wetting and drying 

phases, and when the assessment of the hydrological soil water repellency impact is a 

goal. 

In addition to the temporal dynamics, the spatial variability between sites was irregular 

in time, and poorly related to overall values. In spite of the overall very strong repellency 

levels in the unploughed and ploughed eucalypt sites, there was a shift from less soil 

water repellency in the unploughed site in the first post-fire year, to more repellent during 

the second year (Figure 11). Since fire severity was moderate in both cases and rainfall 

patterns were the same, the spatial differences in soil moisture content can be the cause 

underlying the observed differences between sites. Overall soil moisture content was 

higher at the less repellent unploughed than ploughed site (7.3 vs. 5.8 vol. %) during the 

first year, whereas the opposite was true during the second (6.7 vs. 9.4 vol. %). However, 

the soil moisture alone is insufficient to explain the observed temporal fluctuations and/or 

spatial differences in water repellency levels. An inverse relationship of soil moisture and 

soil water repellency had been observed for eucalypt sites in the region (Walsh et al., 

1994; Doerr and Thomas 2000; Coelho et al., 2005; Keizer et al., 2005a; Leighton-Boyce 

et al., 2005). Above a certain moisture content (i.e. critical threshold), a repellent soil 

becomes entirely wettable (Dekker and Ritsema 1994; Soto et al. 1994; Doerr et al. 2009). 

Afterwards, Dekker et al. (2001) revised the concept suggesting that, a transition zone 

could be more appropriate, rather than a distinct threshold separating wettable and 

repellent conditions. The transition zone detected in this study for the two post-fire years 

was at lower soil moisture content at the unploughed than ploughed site (8-12 vs. 10-14 

vol. %; Figure 12). These results implied that the unploughed site maintained hydrophilic 

conditions at lower soil moisture figures than the ploughed site. In both cases, the soil 

moisture range was narrower than the 14-27 vol. % described by Leighton-Boyce et al., 

2005 in a mature eucalypt site of the region. The results agree with previous findings in 

the detection of a transition zone (Doerr et al., 2000; Dekker et al., 2001; Leighton-Boyce 

et al., 2005) and also with the fact that temporal and spatial water repellency patterns 

cannot be explained only by the soil moisture content.

7.6 General conclusions 

 

The main conclusions of the present PhD study into the hydrological and erosion 

response of recently burnt forest plantations in north-central Portugal were as follows:  

1. Post-fire runoff amounts at the seven study sites tended to be comparable to 

those reported by other studies in and outside Portugal. The associated sediment losses, 

however, were low compared to those found by earlier studies, not only in Portugal but 

especially in other parts of the world. Even so, the present sediment losses must be 

appreciated against a background of typically shallow soils, presumably, reflecting a long 

history of intensive land use and, in recent decades, a high recurrence of wildfires. The 

organic matter contents of the eroded sediments were consistently high (50%), both 

across the various study sites and throughout the 1- to 2-year study periods. Whilst 

organic matter losses by post-fire runoff have received little research attention, they do 

seem of crucial importance for fire-induced soil fertility losses and pollution of downstream 

aquatic habitats. 

2. Contrary to what was expected based on prior research, the pine study site 

generated more overland flow than the unploughed eucalypt site but similar sediment 

losses. The present results, however, did not allow clarifying whether this was due to 

differences in land cover (pine vs. eucalypt) or in post-fire forestry operations (salvage 

logging vs. natural regeneration). Even so, salvage logging did increase sediment losses 

at the pine site, as was also suggested by the rainfall simulation experiments that were 

carried out at another eucalypt study site. These increases in sediment losses after 

logging could be explained by disturbance of the protective litter cover and the resulting 

increase in bare soil cover. As a precautionary principle, post-fire logging activities should 

therefore pay due attention to maintaining or promoting a protective litter cover, as for 

example provided by the needle cast from scorched pine canopies or by logging residues. 

3. The three eucalypt study sites that had been ploughed (prior to the last wildfire) 

produced similar amounts of overland flow but lower sediment losses than the three 

eucalypt study sites that appeared never to have been ploughed. This difference in 

sediment losses was attributed to sediment exhaustion, resulting from enhanced erosion 

following ploughing. At the same time, however, post-fire sediment losses did not differ 

markedly between the three types of ploughing operations studied here. This was 

somewhat surprising, as contour ploughing and terracing are commonly advocated as soil

conservation techniques, whilst down-slope ploughing has been found to markedly 

increase erosion rates. A probable reason was that the erosion impacts of ploughing were 

shorter-lived than the time that had elapsed since the ploughing. Since especially 

terracing is becoming an increasingly widespread practice in the study region, it would 

seem urgent to address in more detail its implications for land-use sustainability.  

4. Hydro-mulching was highly effective in reducing runoff and sediment losses 

during the first 19 months following its application in a recently logged pine stand. The key 

factor explaining this effectiveness was the elevated protective soil cover that was first 

provided by the hydro-mulch alone but, in later stages, in combination with litter and 

vegetation cover. Besides litter and vegetation cover, hydro-mulching has an effect on 

topsoil moisture content and topsoil water repellency, these changes also played a role in 

reducing runoff. 

5. During the first two years after the wildfires, time-since-fire had a marked effect 

on overland flow generation and the associated sediment losses. This effect was 

observed at all study sites, independent of their land cover or pre-fire land management, 

and for both measurement techniques (rainfall simulation experiments and runoff-erosion 

plots). The observed temporal patterns, however, did not correspond to a simple decrease 

in runoff or erosion with time-since-fire. In general, clear peaks in runoff and erosion 

occurred following dry seasons or dry spells. These peaks could often be explained by 

elevated levels of soil water repellency, associated to dry soil conditions and in the 

absence of a vigorous regeneration of the understory and ground vegetation.  

6. Rainfall amount and ground cover were the main factors explaining runoff 

volumes, respectively for the eucalypt and pine sites. However, the specific models -

carried out independently at the ploughed and unploughed eucalypt sites, control and 

hydromulch plots at the pine site- revealed that the first factors were rainfall amount or 

intensity. Rainfall amount was the first variable on sites with low ground cover or during 

periods of high soil water repellency, whereas rainfall intensity became the main factor on 

sites with high ground cover or during low soil water repellency conditions.  

7. In general, sediment losses at the study sites were strongly correlated with runoff 

volumes. In terms of independent variables, however, they could be explained best by 

rainfall intensity followed by cover-related parameters.  

8. Comparison of post-fire runoff and erosion rates produced by simulated and 

natural rain indicated that rainfall simulation experiments (RSE’s) captured well key

aspects such as the difference between a ploughed and an unploughed eucalypt 

plantations, their specific sediment losses (i.e. per mm of runoff), and the organic matter 

content of the eroded sediments. Repeated RSE’s furthermore evidenced the marked 

seasonal variations in runoff and sediment losses, and the apparent role therein of soil 

water repellency.  

9. Overall levels of soil water repellency during two years following a wildfire did not 

reveal an obvious impact of ploughing for two neighbouring eucalypt plantations, one 

ploughed and one unploughed, possibly because the ploughing had occurred several 

years before the wildfire. Differences in water repellency were observed between the two 

study sites but they were highly irregular through time. Furthermore, temporal patterns in 

water repellency proved hard to capture, since significant changes were detected over 

time intervals as short as 6 to 7 days. Soil water repellency levels were less strongly 

correlated with antecedent rainfall than with soil moisture content, but the latter 

relationship is clearly of less import for the purpose of predicting water repellency.
