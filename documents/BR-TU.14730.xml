ABSTRACT. The incorporation of technologies has resulted in increased productivity and the more 
rational management of peach palm, with irrigation being an important tool for certain regions. Thus, 
studies leading to proper crop management are extremely important, such as the estimate of the effective 
depth of the root system, which is indispensable for proper irrigation management. The objective of this 
study was to evaluate the effects of different irrigation depths, as applied by drip irrigation, on the 
distribution of the root system of peach palm. This experiment was conducted in Ilha Solteira, São Paulo 
State, Brazil, with drip irrigation, with the two systems (flow of 0.0023 m3 h-1) consisting of four irrigation 
treatments corresponding to 0, 50, 100 and 150% of Class ‘A’ pan evaporation. After five years, an analysis 
of the Bactris gasipaes root system was performed at a distance of 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0 meters from the trunk, 
collecting sampling at two depths (0.0 to 0.3 m and 0.3 to 0.6 m) via the auger method (volumetric 
analysis). We concluded that the effective depth of the root system used for irrigation management should 
be a maximum of 0.3 meters. 
Keywords: Bactris gasipaes, roots, localized irrigation, irrigation management. 

Distribuição do sistema radicular da pupunheira irrigada por gotejamento 

RESUMO. A incorporação de tecnologias vem trazendo aumento de produtividade e manejo mais racional 
da pupunheira, sendo a irrigação uma ferramenta importante para algumas regiões produtoras. Nesse 
sentido, estudos que levem ao manejo adequado da cultura são de extrema importância, como a estimativa 
da profundidade efetiva do sistema radicular da cultura, indispensável para o correto manejo de irrigação.  
O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar os efeitos de diferentes lâminas de irrigação, aplicadas por gotejamento, 
sobre a distribuição do sistema radicular da pupunheira. Este experimento foi conduzido em Ilha Solteira, 
Estado de São Paulo, com irrigação por gotejamento, com dois gotejadores autocompensantes de 0,0023 m3 h-1 
por planta, constando de quatro tratamentos de irrigação que corresponderam a 0, 50, 100 e 150% da 
evaporação da água do tanque Classe ‘A’. Após cinco anos, foi realizada a análise do sistema radicular das 
pupunheiras, à distância de 0,0; 0,5 e 1,0 metro do estipe, com amostragens em duas profundidades, de 0,0 
a 0,3 m e 0,3 a 0,6 m, pelo método do trado (análise volumétrica), concluindo-se que a profundidade efetiva do 
sistema radicular da pupunheira, utilizada para o manejo da irrigação, deve ser de, no máximo, 0,3 metro.

Introduction 

Hernandez et al. (2001) noted that the current 
methods for the production of peach palm hearts are 
still predominantly based on irrational exploitation 
and extraction, a fact that is causing the extinction of 
the production species, particularly when 
considering the very long life cycle of these trees. 

As indicated by Fernandes et al. (2002), peach 
palm is cultivated in different regions of Brazil, but 
predominantly in Southeast Brazil. The expansion 
of cultivated areas, including the semi-arid region, 
has been accompanied by an advance in technology, 

with the use of liming, fertilization and irrigation, 
and these techniques have enabled more rapid 
production. 

With the use of irrigation, as shown by Marques 
and Coelho (2003), peach palm has proved to be an 
excellent economical choice for both human 
consumption and for use in animal feed (ALVES 
JÚNIOR et al., 2004, 2005; LOPES et al., 2004; 
RODRIGUES NETO et al., 2001). 

Earliness is a great stimulus to the cultive peach 
palm, because the harvest initial is at around 18 
months, generating a more rapid financial return. 
Furthermore, due to the uneven distribution of 



318 Lopes et al.

rainfall and the very shallow root system of this 
plant with a high economic value, the practice of 
irrigation can provide a higher production yield 
(ROSA et al., 2004).  

A knowledge of the quantity, quality and 
distribution of roots is useful in agricultural 
production to provide information on the location 
of fertilizer application, spacing, intercrops, soil 
management and irrigation (FRACARO; PEREIRA, 
2004). 

The root systems of palms are generally 
composed of primary, secondary, tertiary and 
quaternary roots, all lacking absorbent hairs 
(JOURDAN; REY, 1997). 

According to Fante Júnior et al. (1994) the 
assessment of such factors as the volume of soil 
explored, root length and root activity is a difficult 
task, and great difficulties are encountered in any 
sampling technique, including the time spent, 
limited information obtained and great variability 
of results. According to Vasconcelos et al. (2003), a 
perfect method for evaluating roots does not exist 
because the suitability of a method for the 
evaluation of the root system depends on the in 
situ conditions. 

The objective of the present study was to 
evaluate the effects of different irrigation levels 
estimated by the Class ‘A’ pan method, as applied by 
drip irrigation, on the distribution of the root system 
of Bactris gasipaes in Ilha Solteira, the northwest 
region of the State of São Paulo, Brazil. 

Material and methods 

This work was conducted at the Experimental 
Area of Irrigated Agriculture, Ilha Solteira, São 
Paulo State, Brazil, Engineering Faculty of the 
UNESP - Universidade Estadual Paulista. The 
geographical coordinates are 20º25’23”S and 
51º21’13”W, and the average elevation is 335 m. 
According to the Köppen classification, the climate 
is type Aw, defined as tropical humid with a rainy 
season during the summer and a dry winter; the 
average annual precipitation is 1,259 mm, the mean 
annual temperature is 24.7°C, and the mean annual 
insolation is 7.4h day-1. The soil in the area is 
classified as Acrisol; the particle size is shown in 
Table 1.

(Ilha Solteira, Brazil).

Peach palm seedlings were planted in 1993 at a 
spacing of 2.0 x 1.0 m, and irrigation was performed 
by two drip irrigation systems with a flow of 0.0023 
m3 h-1. The irrigated treatments received fertigation 
four times a year, according to the soil analysis and 
recommendations of Bovi and Cantarella (1996). 

The experimental design was completely 
randomized in a 4 x 3 x 2 factorial scheme of four 
irrigation treatments at three distances from the 
stem and two depths, with four replications. The 
treatments were implemented based on the 
replacement of Class ‘A’ pan evaporation (CAE) 
corresponding to no irrigation (NI), 50% CAE, 
100% CAE and 150% CAE. 

An analysis of the root system of peach palm was 
performed in November 1999 when the adult plants 
were five years old and considered to have a stable root 
system. The sampling occurred at 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0 m 
from the trunk, between the planting lines, and at two 
depths, 0.0 to 0.3 m and 0.3 to 0.6 m. For this purpose, 
an auger was used, and both the soil and roots were 
collected in a receptacle of known volume (4.03 dm3); 
the material (root + soil)was washed in the laboratory 
and dried in an oven at 65°C for 48h. 

The results were expressed in grams of roots per 
cubic decimeter of soil (g dm-3); the data were 
subjected to an analysis of variance, and the means 
were compared suing the Tukey test at a 5% 
probability. The selection of the equation of best fit 
was based on the significance of the regression 
effect, the deviations of the regression tested by the 
F-test at 5% and the highest coefficient of 
determination (R2). 

Results and discussion 

The drip irrigation system used resulted in an 
elevated soil moisture in the monitored area, which 
was between the planted rows. An understanding of 
the wet bulb area, the movement of water in the soil 
via percolation and the extraction by the plants as 
functions of the treatment is necessary for studying a 
root system under drip irrigation. 

Table 2 shows that there was an increase in the 
amount of dry root biomass as the irrigation depth 
increased, results that are consistent with those of 
Reichardt (1993), reporting that the root system of a 
plant is proportional to the soil moisture. Reichardt 
and Tim (2004) also reported that the amount of 
water absorbed by plants is a function of both the 
water potential in the soil and also the ability of the 
roots to absorb water from the soil with which they 
are in contact, in addition to soil properties for the 
provision and transmission of water to the roots at a 
rate that meets the requirements of transpiration.

CAE).  

Although the root system of peach palms is very 
shallow, a better root distribution was observed (in 
percentage) without irrigation (NI). In all of the 
treatments studied (except NI), over 90% of the 
roots were found at depths from 0 to 0.3 m, which 
indicates that 0.3 m is the effective depth of the root 
system for the purpose of irrigation management. 
This value was higher than that found by Ramos  
et al. (2009), who reported that 65% of the root 
system of this palm is concentrated in the top 0.2 m 
of soil, noting that this depth can be considered for 
the proper management of water and fertilizer 
applications. However, in the present study, there 
was a decrease in the root content when approaching 
the middle of the row (Figure 1).

the evaporation of the Class A pan (100% CAE) and 150% of the

It can be observed in Table 3 that there was 
interaction effect between the irrigation treatment 
and the root depth and for the treatment of root 
depth and irrigation, resulting in significant 
differences for the interaction between the 
treatments of root depth in all of the irrigation levels 
studied in this work.

evaporation of the Class A pan (100% CAE) and 150% of the evaporation of the Class A 
pan (150% CAE). 

The root dry mass at a depth of 0.0 to 0.30 m 
showed a linear response, increasing with the 
increase of the systematic provision of water based 
on the CAE and treatment with application of 150% 
CAE averaged 3.86 g dm-3. 

In evaluating the development of the root system 
of peach palm in the field, Vega et al. (2005) found 
that the root system in one year-old trees was 
concentrated mostly in the topsoil (0.0-0.2 m deep) 
and at distances up to 0.5 m from the plant, as also 
indicated in the present study. This palm species 
exhibited a high concentration of roots near the 
stem and at shallow depths (Figure 2). 

Under the conditions of the study area, irrigation 
management should prevail, with the adoption of a 
more frequent irrigation frequency such that there is 
no percolation of water in the soil profile and, 
therefore, no accumulation of water below the 
effective depth of the root system. 

With the irrigation managements NI, 50% CAE, 
100% CAE and 150% CAE, the proportions of the 
total dry root mass in the 0.0 to 0.3 m layer were 
78.3, 90.4, 93.3 and 92.8%, respectively. When 
evaluating peach palm in sandy and clayey texture 
soils in the São Francisco valley in the semi-arid 
region of northeastern Brazil, Bassoi et al. (1999) 
observed that the root system of peach palm grown 
at a spacing of 2.0 x 1.0 m and with irrigation 
performed by farrows presented shallow rooting and 
that approximately 90% of the roots were 
concentrated in the top 0.4 m of the soil. 

Figure 2 shows the linear regression equations of 
decreasing root dry mass for each irrigation 
management as a function of the distance from the

trunk. It can be noted that the dry mass between the 
treatments of 50% CAE and 100% CAE showed a 
negligible variation at 0 m from the trunk. In 
contrast, at one meter away from the trunk of peach 
palm, all of the irrigation management treatments 
showed similar root dry weights, such that this was 
most likely not influenced by the irrigation.

trunk of peach palm in relation to the irrigation treatment. No 
irrigation (NI), 50% of the evaporation of the Class A pan (50% 
CAE), 100% of the evaporation of the Class A pan (100% CAE) 
and 150% of the evaporation of the Class A pan 150% CAE) (Ilha 
Solteira, Brazil). 

Ferreira et al. (1995) observed by regression 
analysis that the mass of the root system of peach 
palm decreases dramatically at a distance exceeding 
0.50 m from the trunk. Bassoi et al. (2003) observed 
that a depth maximum rooting of 0.40 m at 6 
months and 1.0 m at 12 and 24 months after 
planting. Furthermore, between rows, these authors 
reported that the roots reached a distance of 0.6 m 
from the trunk at 6 months after planting but the 
presence of the root system was observed at a 
distance of 1.0 m from the stem after 12 months, 
indicating entanglement among the roots of 
neighboring plants. This was also observed in all of 
the treatments of the present study. However the 
strategy of irrigation management should be to 
provide a water supply to the surface layer (up to  
0.3 m); in the case of drip irrigation, this should be 
performed close to the trunk, not exceeding 0.5 m. 
For a better efficiency of water use, irrigation should 
be performed frequently, preferably daily for drip 
irrigation in Acrisol and at least every 5 days for 
sprinkler irrigation. 

It can be observed in Table 3 that the root dry 
mass was influenced by the interaction between the 
irrigation treatment and the depth of 0.0 to 0.3 m. 
The NI treatment showed the lowest value, 
differing from the other irrigation treatments and 
showing a difference of 1.14, 1.63 and 2.56 g dm-3 in 
relation to treatments 50% CAE, 100% CAE and 
150% CAE, respectively. It may be noted that, at a 
5% probability, the irrigation treatments did not 
influence the root dry mass for the depth of 0.3 to 
0.6 m. 

Conclusion 

It is recommended that the effective depth of the 
root system used for irrigation management in peach 
palm, which is at maximum 0.3 meters.
