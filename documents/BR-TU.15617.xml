Abstract: Aim: The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of daily changes in 
surface water abiotic factors on the abundance of Odonata larvae and the genus richness 
in a lateral lake isolated from a tropical river during the nycthemeral cycle in dry and 
wet seasons; Methods: Macrophytes were sampled on a single day at 6-hours intervals 
for 24 hours (at 12:00 AM, 6:00 AM, 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM) in dry and wet periods. 
At each site, abiotic factors were measured as follows: air temperature, surface water 
temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and electric conductivity. Canonical correspondence 
analysis (CCA) of abiotic and biological data and sampling periods was made using 
CANOCO program; Results: A total of 249 and 265 Odonata larvae from six genera 
(Acanthagrion, Cyanallagma, Telebasis, Erythemis, Erythrodiplax and Tauriphila) were 
sampled in association with macrophytes in wet and dry seasons, respectively. Telebasis 
presented the highest frequency of occurrence and was collected in all nycthemeral cycle 
sampling periods in both seasons. The highest abundance of dragonflies was recorded 
at 6:00 AM and 12:00 AM in wet and dry seasons, respectively. Anoxia was detected 
in wet season during the entire nycthemeral cycle, while in the dry season, the highest 
variability in oxygen content was observed during sunlight. Canonical correspondence 
analysis showed that the abundances of Telebasis and Erythemis were positively related 
to water electrical conductivity, temperature, and depth, while for Acanthagrion and 
Tauriphila, abundance showed a positive relationship to water oxygen and pH. The 
variability of the abundance of Odonata due to surface water temperature, dissolved 
oxygen, electrical conductivity, pH, and depth during the daily cycle was therefore 
evidenced; Conclusions: We suggested that the better sampling period Odonata larvae 
must to be carried in the morning , since that we recorded the highest densities of both 
wet and dry stations at that hour. We point out that our data must to be examined with 
caution because the low sampling effort and the reduced taxonomic resolution.

1. Introduction

Nycthemeral studies in tropical lakes are 
extremely important due to the high variability of 
chemical and physical characteristics of water, such 
as dissolved oxygen and temperature (Esteves et al., 
1988). Both water dissolved oxygen concentration 
and temperature directly affect the abundance 
of Odonata larvae. The amount of dissolved 
oxygen in water affects the behavior, metabolism, 
and survival of Odonata larvae (Corbet, 1999; 
Hofmann and Mason, 2005). Variations in oxygen 
availability in lacustrine (low oxygenation) and lotic 
(high oxygenation) environments determine the 
diversity of Odonata species (Voshell and Simmons, 
1978; Corbet, 1999; Fulan  et  al., 2008). Water 
temperature also has an effect on the abundance 
and development of Odonata larvae (Lutz, 1974; 
Ward, 1992; Corbet, 1999). Sites with high 
temperatures, such as thermal springs, tend to 
present low abundance and diversity of Odonata 
species (Corbet, 1999). However, when considering 
aquatic insects, Odonata are characterized by a high 
tolerance to changes of surface water temperature 
(Kondratieff and Pyott, 1987; Cobert, 1999). The 
importance of abiotic factors like water dissolved 
oxygen and temperature for the presence of 
Odonata larvae near macrophytes was also shown 
for a lake lateral to Paranapanema River, Brazil 
(Fulan and Henry, 2006). According to the authors, 
Enallagma, Homeura and Telebasis were highly 
sensitive to variations in dissolved water oxygen 
concentration and temperature during the year. 
Besides environmental variables, biotic factors such 
as predation risk can also affect macroinvertebrate 
distribution during the 24-hours period. Flecker 
(1992) recorded that Ephemeroptera larvae 
presented nocturnal habits to avoid predators such 
as fish, which are usually more active during the 
day. Odonata larvae are top predators and can feed 
on a great diversity of macroinvertebrates (Corbet, 
1999). Nevertheless, Odonata larvae are also preyed 

on by fish and can present different behaviors. 
Despite the significant effect of predation on 
Odonata larvae, the current investigation has been 
limited to the effects of seasonal and nycthemeral 
variations in the abiotic factors on aquatic insects.

According to Corbet (1999), environmental 
variables and biotic factors, as predation, had 
an important effect on Odonata larvae density. 
As indicated before, a daily modification on 
environmental factors can occurred in distinct 
stations of the year. Thus, it should be expected 
that Odonata larvae presented a response to 
environmental variables as it was mentionned in 
literature. So, our paper intends to respond to the 
following question: Can environmental factors, 
as oxygen and temperature, explain nictemeral 
variation in Odonata larvae abundance in a tropical 
lake? 

2. Material and Methods

2.1. The study area

Cavalos Lake, 23° 29’ S and 48° 37’ W, is located 
at the mouth zone of the Paranapanema River. 
It flows into the Jurumirim Reservoir, located in 
São Paulo State, Brazil (Figure 1). It is lateral and 
superficially isolated from the Paranapanema River, 
but it may be affected by the river by underground 
water exchange. In a 16-month study, Carmo 
(2007) showed that underground water flowed in 
the river-lake direction during 64% of the time and 
otherwise in the remaining period.

2.2. Macrophyte and Odonata larva sampling

Three great stands were selected in dry and 
wet seasons, according to the arrangement shown 
in Figure 1 (P1, P2, and P3). In each stand, only 
one macrophyte sampling was carried out; thus 
totaling three samples each for the wet and dry 
seasons. Macrophytes were sampled on a single day 

período seco a maior variabilidade de oxigênio foi observada durante o dia. A Análise de 
Correspondência Canônica mostrou que as abundâncias de Telebasis e Erythemis foram 
positivamente correlacionadas com a condutividade elétrica, temperatura e profundidade, 
enquanto que Acanthagrion e Tauriphila mostraram correlação positiva com o oxigênio 
e com o pH. Portanto, foi observada uma variância na abundância de Odonata com 
temperatura, oxigênio, condutividade, pH e profundidade durante o período de 24 horas; 
Conclusões: Nós sugerimos que o melhor período de amostragem de larvas de Odonata 
deve ser pela manhã, pois neste período registramos as maiores densidades nas estações 
seca e chuvosa. Destacamos que os resultados deste trabalho devem ser interpretados com 
cautela devido ao baixo esforço amostral e reduzida resolução taxonômica.

inserted below S. auriculata in the selected sites and 
the plants with Odonata larvae were transferred to 
plastic bags. In the laboratory, Odonata larvae were 
carefully removed by moving the plants in circular 
movements in three buckets containing 8 and 4% 
formaldehyde, and water, respectively (Fulan and 
Henry, 2006). The content of each bucket was 
filtered with a 0.25-mm mesh net sieve. Odonata 

at 6-hours intervals for 24 hours (at 12:00  AM, 
6:00 AM, 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM) in dry and 
wet periods. The 6-hours interval corresponds to 
the minimum time necessary to wash the plants 
and carry out physical and chemical analyses in 
laboratory. Aquatic plants were sampled with a 
0.25-mm mesh net mounted on a 0.07-m2 square 
metal frame. The sampling equipment was carefully

Tauriphila) were sampled in wet (249 larvae) and 
dry (265 larvae) seasons. The highest abundances 
were observed at 6:00 AM in wet season and at 
12:00  AM in dry season. Telebasis presented the 
highest frequency of occurrence, being observed 
in all sampling periods during the nycthemeral 
cycle and in both wet and dry seasons (Table 1). 
In Table 2, we can observe that the surface water 
dissolved oxygen concentration was zero in all 
periods (except at 6:00 PM) of the wet season, 
while in the dry season, the highest dissolved 
oxygen concentration (3.74 mg.L-1) was found at 
12:00 PM. The values of surface water temperature, 
electric conductivity, and depth were higher in wet 
season.

The CCA Monte Carlo test revealed that the 
first axis (F = 4.829, p &amp;lt;0.02) and all the canonical 
axes together (F = 4.132, p &amp;lt;0.02) were significant 
and represented relationships between abiotic 
and biological variables. The first and second axes 
explained together 70.3% of the data variability 
(auto-values 0.579 and 0.124 for axes 1 and 2, 
respectively).

Telebasis, Erythemis and Acanthagrion presented 
significant correlations with axis 1, while Tauriphila 
did with axes 1 and 2 (Table 3). Water dissolved 
oxygen, temperature, electrical conductivity, 

larvae retained on the sieve were preserved in 70% 
alcohol and identified using an identification key 
(Costa et al., 2004).

2.3. Abiotic factors

At each site, abiotic factors were measured as 
follows: air temperature by alcohol thermometer, 
surface water temperature by Toho Dentam 
thermistor, dissolved oxygen by Golterman  et  al. 
(1978), pH by Micronal B-380 pHmeter, and 
electric conductivity corrected to 25  °C by 
Golterman et al. (1978).

2.4. Data analysis

Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of 
abiotic and biological data and sampling periods 
was made using CANOCO program (Ter Braak 
and Smilauer, 2002). The significance level of the 
first two canonical axes was tested with the Monte 
Carlo test (499 permutations, p &amp;lt;0.05) and the 
probability of hazard distribution of data was 
determined. CCA data were log (y + 1) transformed 
for performing CANOCO.

that the oxygen concentration affected Telebasis 
and Erythemis negatively and Acanthagrion and 
Tauriphila positively during the nycthemeral cycle. 
An annual study of Odonata larvae conducted in 
a lake lateral to the Paranapanema River showed 
a different result as compared with those of the 
present investigation. Acanthagrion, Erythemis and 
Tauriphila did not exhibit any correlation with 

and depth presented a correlation with axis 1 in 
sampling periods 6:00 AM, 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM 
as well (Tables 4 and 5).

The abundances of Telebasis and Erythemis were 
positively affected by water electrical conductivity, 
temperature, and depth, while the abundances of 
Acanthagrion and Tauriphila showed a positive 
correlation with water dissolved oxygen and pH 
(Figure 2).

4. Discussion

Daily changes on environmental variables affect 
the distribution of aquatic insects. In this paper, 
more evidences were added showing the effects of 
environmental variables during the diurnal cycle 
on Odonata larvae.

In aquatic ecosystems, oxygen availability is one 
of the limiting factors of the survival of insect larvae, 
such as Odonata (Gaufin  et  al., 1974; Corbet, 
1999; Hoback and Stanley, 2001; Apodaca and 
Chapman, 2004). In the dry season, CCA showed

highly tolerant to pH variation when compared 
with Anisoptera, such as Tauriphila (Corbet, 1999). 
However, both Acanthagrion and Tauriphila are 
little tolerant to water pH variation during the 
nycthemeral cycle.

None of the measured environmental variables 
completely explains the Odonata distribution in 
the 24-hours period. Predation risk of Odonata 
larvae by fish must also be considered, since it 
directly affects the larval behavior. Carvalho et al. 
(2005) studied the monthly variation of fish 
composition and distribution in Cavalos Lake from 
July, 1998 to June, 1999. According to the authors, 
5481 individuals of four orders, Characiformes, 
Siluriformes, Gymnoformes, and Perciformes, were 
captured in the lake. Despite Cavalos Lake being a 
small and isolated lake, a significant density of fish 
that inhabit this environment may prey on Odonata 
larvae. Flecker (1992) observed in an experiment 
that Ephemeroptera larvae are conditioned to search 
refuge, including in the absence of predators. Also, 
Bass (2004) recorded that in natural conditions, 
the number of invertebrates recorded during the 
nocturnal period was approximately four times 
higher than in the diurnal period, due to a lower 
predation risk at night. Similar to Bass’ (2004) 
observations, we found the highest number of 
larvae at 12:00 AM (nocturnal period) in the dry 
season. This observation shows that predation 
can be a determinant of Odonata distribution. 
However, during the wet season, we recorded a very 
low number of larvae. In this period, the abiotic 
factors may have important effects on the Odonata 
larvae distribution. In the wet season, we recorded 
anoxia on the water surface in all sampling periods 
and also an increase of more than 100% in water 
conductivity as compared with the dry season.

All the six Odonata genera (Acanthagrion, 
Cyanallagma, Eryrhemis, Erythrodiplax, Tauriphila 
and Telebasis) described in this work had already 
been reported near macrophytes (Carvalho and 
Nessimian, 1998; Fulan and Henry, 2006). 
However, despite sharing the same habitat, Odonata 
were diversely affected by abiotic factors, the most 
important ones being water dissolved oxygen and 
temperature. As their affects on the abundance 
of aquatic insects during the daily cycle is highly 
relevant, the sampling period of Odonata must be 
reported. In future works, involving environmental 
monitoring of Odonata larvae, we suggested that 
the better sampling period must to be carried in 
the morning , since that we recorded the highest 
densities of both wet and dry stations at that hour. 
We point out that our data must to be examined 

dissolved oxygen concentration, and Telebasis 
was positively influenced by dissolved oxygen 
(Fulan and Henry, 2006). Apparently, Acanthagrion, 
Erythemis, Tauriphila, and Telebasis are thus more 
susceptible to changes of oxygen availability during 
the daily cycle rather than during the annual 
cycle. Although the changes of oxygen availability 
affected four of the six Odonata genera observed 
in this study, Cyanallagma and Erythrodiplax were 
tolerant enough of environmental variations, 
including of oxygen availability. Morphological, 
physiological, and behavioral adaptations in low 
water oxygenation conditions had already been 
observed for macro-invertebrates (Hoback and 
Stanley, 2001; Apodaca and Chapman, 2004).

Besides oxygen, the surface water temperature 
also influenced the distribution of Odonata larvae. 
Only four orders of aquatic insects (Odonata, 
Hemiptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera) are resistant 
to significant changes in water temperature (Corbet, 
1999). Odonata larvae tolerate changes in water 
temperature through an enzymatic mechanism that 
promotes a fast physiological response (Schott and 
Brusven, 1980). In the present study, only 
Cyanallagma and Erythrodiplax tolerated variations 
in surface water temperature. Temperature changes 
positively affected Telebasis and Erythemis and 
negatively affected Acanthagrion and Tauriphila. 
Some Anisoptera and Zygoptera families are 
sensitive to variations in water temperature, as was 
reported for Acanthagrion, Erythemis, Telebasis and 
Tauriphila. (Corbet, 1999; Fulan and Henry, 2006).

In addition to the water dissolved oxygen 
concentration and surface temperature, other 
environmental factors, such as electrical conductivity, 
pH, and depth also had an effect on the abundance 
of Odonata larvae. CCA showed positive effects 
of electrical conductivity and depth on the 
abundance of Telebasis and Erythemis and of pH 
on the abundances of Acanthagrion and Tauriphila. 
Erythemis also showed a positive relationship 
with electrical conductivity in a lake lateral to the 
Paranapanema River, Brazil (Fulan and Henry, 
2006). Differently from what was observed in the 
present work, Telebasis and Erythemis exhibited a 
negative correlation with depth (Corbet, 1999). 
High pressure in sites with high depth directly 
affects the larvae tracheal system, reducing gas 
exchange (Corbet, 1999). Although depth can affect 
Odonata larvae negatively during the daily cycle, we 
recorded a positive effect on Telebasis and Erythemis. 
Water pH, as well as depth, showed a positive effect 
on the abundances of Acanthagrion and Tauriphila. 
Zygoptera larvae, such as Acanthagrion., are actually
