Abstract 
The rationale under Merger and Acquisitions (M&amp;amp;A) has a huge spectrum, but it is always assumed 
to be a way of increasing shareholders value. The recent downturn in the oil and gas (O&amp;amp;G) market 
has been creating some speculations where M&amp;amp;A arises as a way to join companies that together 
can be more efficient in handling periods of low prices. In fact, this is a great opportunity for those 
with solid financial positions to invest in undervalued companies, and thus, strengthen their 
competitiveness in the future. 

This dissertation focuses in assessing the potential value added from a deal between ExxonMobil 
and Anadarko. The former with an integrated business model and a strong balance sheet, and the 
latter, solely dependent on the upstream segment which means being more exposed to fluctuations 
in oil prices. 

Thereafter, an in-depth company and industry analysis is conducted in order to establish which 
assumptions to apply to the valuation methods. The individual and combined analysis is supported 
by a literature review on valuation and M&amp;amp;A. Based on a theoretical framework, the merged entity 
valuation is developed, followed by a proposed price, method of payment and acquisition strategy.  

Anadarko’s standalone valuation suggests that its average share price during 2015 is undervalued 
with 13% upside potential. Due to synergies of $33,96Bn, the proposed deal has a premium of 49% 
and the final suggestion being an all-cash offer.

Resumo 
Várias são as razões apontadas para justificar fusões e aquisições, mas todas têm subjacente o 
pressuposto da criação de valor para os acionistas. Num período de queda histórica do preço do 
petróleo, estas surgem como uma alternativa para a criação de estruturas mais eficientes. A 
fragilidade financeira experienciada pelo setor emerge também como uma oportunidade. Empresas 
menos vulneráveis às oscilações dos preços podem aumentar a sua competitividade futura 
investindo em empresas que viram o seu valor de mercado desvalorizar significativamente. 

Assim, esta dissertação foca-se na análise da criação de valor que pode resultar da aquisição da 
Anadarko, uma empresa unicamente dependente da exploração e produção de petróleo, pela 
ExxonMobil, com um modelo de negócios integrado que vai desde a exploração até à 
comercialização. 

Uma análise detalhada à indústria e a ambas as empresas permite estabelecer os pressupostos 
necessários para o desenvolvimento dos modelos de avaliação e da estratégia de aquisição. 
Adicionalmente, uma análise da literatura académica sobre modelos de avaliação e fusões e 
aquisições sustenta os modelos desenvolvidos, bem como as recomendações relativas ao preço, 
modo de pagamento e estratégia de aquisição.  
A avaliação da Anadarko sugere que o preço médio por ação verificado ao longo do ano de 2015 
está subavaliado em 13%. Assim, com sinergias avaliadas em $33,96 biliões, a aquisição proposta 
tem um premium de 49% e deverá ser paga unicamente em dinheiro.

Introduction 

The recent downturn in the oil and gas (O&amp;amp;G) market has been creating some speculations about 

Merger and Acquisitions (M&amp;amp;A) deals between companies with strong balance sheets and others 

which are struggling with financial pressure. Those with solid financial positions invest in 

undervalued companies and thus strengthen their competitive position in the future, which is the 

case with ExxonMobil and Anadarko. 

Both are O&amp;amp;G companies based in the United States with operations worldwide. However, 

ExxonMobil has an integrated business model which has so far proven to be strong enough to deal 

with the fluctuations of oil prices. In contrast, Anadarko is entirely dependent on its upstream 

segment, and consequently, it has been struggling with the current historically low commodity 

prices. 

A consolidation process between the two companies requires an extensive look at the strategic and 

financial reasoning behind it. In order to proceed with the evaluation of this deal a literature review 

has been developed, and covers the existing academic literature about valuation methods and an 

analysis of the most common issues related to M&amp;amp;A deals. These foundations will be crucial to 

develop the forecast models and to propose the best acquisition strategy and payment methods. 

Thereafter, an in-depth industry and company analysis will be conducted in order to establish the 

right assumptions to develop the forecast for the standalone valuations. Once the individual 

analysis is done, an integrated perspective will be developed in order to evaluate the consolidation 

benefits. 

Finally, the last section focuses on the details of the acquisition process, providing the final 

recommendations in terms of premium, method of payment and acquisition strategy.

Literature Review  
1. Valuation Overview 

While conceptually there is one correct value for a firm, in practice there are multiple ways of 

calculating it. As a result, the important question is which valuation technique offers the easiest 

and most accurate way which is comparable against other models. 

1.1. Cash-Flow Methodology 

The DCF method emerged in the 1970s as the best way to value corporate assets. The logic behind 

this method is the relationship between present and future value, where timing and risk need to take 

place following the uncertainty of the future business CF. This uncertainty is translated in an 

opportunity cost represented by the time value and the risk premium. The following topics will 

analyse some of the different variations of DCF methods. 

Four different DCF approaches are based on the nature of the used CF and the discount rate: APV, 

CCF, FCFF and CFE (Oded &amp;amp; Michel, 2007). The first three are based on EV and the latter on 

equity values. The DDM is another CF method that follows an equity based approach. 

1.1.1. Equity Value Perspective: DDM 

Foerster and Saap (2005) considered the DDM a useful approach to value the equity of firms with 

mature dividend-payment polices by discounting all future expected dividend payments, supported 

by the intrinsic assumption that changes in dividends explain changes in asset prices.  

The generalized DDM approach was later replaced by the Gordon Growth Model that relies on the 

assumption of constant dividend growth: 

 

 

 

However, a constant growth is not always applicable due to different life cycles and consequently, 

this model is only suitable for companies with stable growth rates (Damodaran, 2005).

Despite some studies continuing to present DDM as a reliable method, studies with longer time 

series, which are considered to be more reliable, tend to question these results. Since the payout 

ratio is dependent on many factors, forecasting future dividends requires a significant amount of 

speculation.  

1.1.2. EV Perspective: APV and WACC 

The more common version of the DCF is based on the WACC, a discount rate that applies the debt 

and equity costs to the capital structure ratios with the respective adjustment for the tax shield. The 

simplicity of WACC has the drawback of considering the interest tax shield straight away and not 

taking into account the potential changes in the company’s capital structure over time. 

In order to avoid misevaluation, complex capital structures requiring a WACC should be adjusted 

per project and period. Cash, timing and risk have distinctive structural features that WACC does 

not recognize in a very accurate way and consequently, other complementary tools should be 

considered (Luehrman, 1907). However, Oded &amp;amp; Michel (2007) argued that when the debt 

rebalancing policy is applied consistently, all valuation methods produce equivalent results.  

However, the APV, as suggested by Stewart Myers from MIT, is one of the proposed models that 

according to Luehrman (1997) outperforms WACC by considering separated CF from business 

operations and financing strategies. For Luehrman (1997) “APV always works when WACC does, 

and sometimes when WACC does not”.  

When executing the APV method, the first step is to determine the forecasted CF, which is then 

discounted as if the company was fully financed by equity. The value associated with the financing 

programme is evaluated separately.  

However, there is no consensus amongst academics for the discount rate used to value the financing 

programme. The risk associated with the tax shields is seen by some academics as the same as debt 

obligations and therefore, the tax shields should be discounted using the cost of debt. Whereas 

others agree that the use of leverage will be dependent on the operational performance, and 

therefore, should be discounted at the same discount rate as operational CFs. Grinblatt and Titman 

(2002) argued that the tax shield should be discounted with different discount rates based on the 

rebalancing assumption.

Putting both pieces together, business operations CFs and the value of the financing side effects, 

valuation through APV is obtained. 

1.1.3. Critical issues related with DCF methods 

1.1.3.1. CAPM 

The CAPM establishes the relation between risk and expected return, calculated through the sum 

of risk-free (rf), which represents the time value of money, with the product between the systematic 

risk (?) and the risk premium required by investors (rm-rf). In fact, under this approach investors 

are solely concerned with the systematic risk, mathematically translated by the covariance between 

the stock and the market returns.  

Despite contradictory academic evidence and some more modern approaches (e.g. arbitrage pricing 

theory) CAMP is still one of the most accepted methods to calculate the cost of equity.  

Gene Fama and Ken French (1992) argued that the stock returns were related with the size and 

book-to-market ratios of the firm, which contradict the systematic risk measure denoted by CAPM. 

However, later Kaplan and Ruback (1996) developed a study based on CAPM which proves that 

the implied risk premium is positively related to firm and industry betas, as opposed to firm size or 

pre-transaction book-to-market ratios. 

1.1.3.2. Risk-Free Rate 

Due to the more frequently errors associated with risk-free determination (Fernández, 2004) it is 

desirable to use a risk free rate with the same duration of the analysed cash-flows. 

1.1.3.3. Risk-Premium 

There is some disagreement between which is the best approach: LT arithmetic average (1) or a 

geometric average (2) of the historical return spread between a stock market index and risk-free 

bonds.  

Kaplan &amp;amp; Ruback (1996) developed a study based on the LT arithmetic average approach (1), the 

most common in finance texts, which proved that APV works best with arithmetic average. For 

DCF methods, there was no evidence that the arithmetic approach would have improved its 

performance. However, Fernández (2004) argued that “the required MRP is an expectation and 



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 19  

has little to do with history”, but since he did not present any alternative, this analysis will use the 

arithmetic average. 

1.1.3.4. Beta 

There are two main issues that should be pointed out for beta: the time period and the source of the 

market index.  

Beta estimation is based upon historical betas but Fernández (2004) and Damodaran (2001) 

supported that calculated betas change dramatically and depend on the period used to estimate 

them. They ignore potential recent variations on the business operation, leverage and other 

important variables that impacts the firm’s systematic risk. Thus, Damodaran (2002) recommended 

the use of bottom-up betas, which includes recent updates in operating and leverage levels. 

Measuring the systematic risk (?) could follow three different approaches in terms of source that 

were applied by Kaplan &amp;amp; Ruback (1996): firm (1), industry (2) and market (3). This study proved 

that the firm-based method is the less accurate, with industry and market outperforming it. The 

statistical noise of individual beta made industry betas more stable and consistent.  

Copeland, T. et al. (1991) suggested using the public estimation of beta for listed companies, while 

still taking into account the existing industry betas and other reliable sources to validate this 

assumption. The reasoning behind validation also aligns with the conclusion of Kaplan &amp;amp; Ruback, 

(1996) that individual beta estimates vary widely and industry average beta are usually more 

reliable. 

Nevertheless, the challenge here is to find reliable comparable companies able to guarantee 

consistency and a representative sample. 

1.1.3.5. Terminal Value 

The TV is calculated though a terminal CF that is assumed to grow in perpetuity at a constant 

nominal growth rate (Kaplan &amp;amp; Ruback, 1996). It carries a significant weight on the present value 

of any valuation. Consequently, its underlying assumptions are very important and a sensitivity 

analysis is greatly recommended. 

Normally, the TV proceeds a forecasting time frame that is defined individually, based on the 

specifications of each project or business stage in terms of CAPEX. Considering the perpetuity 



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 20  

growth rate, CAPEX should be aligned with D&amp;amp;A (Kaplan &amp;amp; Ruback, 1996) and should also reflect 

the nominal GDP growth (Steiger, 2008). 

1.1.4. Return-based Approach  

The return-based logic has two main approaches: ROE and EVA. Dynamic ROE, the equity 

approach, is calculated based on the current BV plus the discounted future excess returns. On the 

other hand, the EVA uses the EV approach. EVA is achieved by the sum of the current capital 

stock plus the discounted value of future EVA. Some academics argue that the inconsistency of the 

usage of BV and the imperfections between EVA and stock returns make these approaches less 

used as a firm valuation tool. 

1.2. Option Theory 

The high uncertainties and risks at every stage of petroleum projects, along with limited maturities, 

make O&amp;amp;G companies considerably hard to value. Real options are especially valuable for this 

industry since it provides different methods to value such uncertainties (Copeland &amp;amp; Keenan, 

1998), Black-Scholes and the Binomial model being the most important.  

Luehrman (1997) considered Black-Scholes, a model developed by Fischer Black and Myron 

Scholes and modified by Robert Merton (Black &amp;amp; Scholes, 1973), his favourite because of its 

versatility and simplicity. However, in this analysis, the option theory will not be considered since 

it would not be suitable to apply it to an integrated company like ExxonMobil. 

1.3. Multiples 

Whereas the previous valuation methods are based on assumptions related with the firm being 

valued, relative valuation estimates the company’s value based on historical markets and 

transaction values of comparable companies. However, both types of valuation demand important 

assumptions: that comparable companies are aligned in terms of growth and risk. The market-based 

approach assumes that the value of comparable companies will fluctuate in direct proportion to the 

varying performance measurements used (Kaplan &amp;amp; Ruback, 1996). Foushee et al (2012) adds that 

truly comparable companies also have to compete in the same markets. According to Kaplan and 

Ruback (1996) having these conditions fulfilled, the relative valuation approach can be valuable 

since it already includes updated market expectations. 



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 21  

The market multiples can also be separated based on their fundamental determination. Investors 

tend to use enterprise-value multiples since they are not manipulated by differences in the capital 

structure (Foushee, et al., 2012). Goedhart et al (2005) highlight that EV-to-EBITDA is also 

preferred because it does not take into account non-operating expenses.  

Despite multiples providing the advantage of including market expectations, they also have their 

weaknesses. Kaplan and Ruback proved that DCF methods were more accurate, but the most 

reliable estimates were the ones that used both. 

2. M&amp;amp;A Issues 

2.1. Synergies 

The rationale behind M&amp;amp;A is essentially explained by the synergies that arise from combining two 

firms.  

Damodaran (2005) grouped synergies into operating and financial synergies. Operating Synergies 

includes economies of scale, higher bargaining power, growth opportunities and a combination of 

different operating strengths, all with the potential outcome of an increased operating income. 

Financial Synergies could arise from a combination of firms with excess cash and limited project 

opportunities, higher debt capacity and diversification, which could result in higher cash-flows or 

lower cost of capital. A study conducted by Bhide (1993) concluded that for one third of takeovers, 

operating synergy was the primary driver. 

However, several challenges are posed when it comes to their effective implementation. In terms 

of financial synergies, the ones that arise from diversification tend to fail in creating value and 

consequently, markets usually react negatively to the announcement of diversifying acquisitions 

(Doukas, et al., 2001).  

In fact, there are some academics that propose synergy analyses based on the difficultness of 

achieving them. Cullian, et al. (2004) proposed an interesting framework that mapped synergies 

according to their easiness in terms of implementation. Eccles, et al. (1999) pointed out that due to 

the difficulty in estimating revenue synergies, some analysts neither include nor discount them 

heavily.  



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 22  

Damodaran (2005) proposed a way to value synergies based on three steps: value the firms 

independently (1); value of combined firm with no synergy (2) and revalued the combined firm 

with synergies (3), where the difference between (2) and (3) is the value of synergies. However, 

the forecasting CF of the combining firms should be discounted at an appropriate rate that is 

imposed on the new firm. 

Cullian, et al. (2004) also highlights the importance of a rigorous DD process that identifies the 

most common financial tricks, such as overoptimistic projections. In the end, it is the acquisition 

price that will determine whether an acquisition result is value increasing or value destroying. 

2.2. The Announcement reactions and Post-merger results  

Mckinsey and Co. developed a study which intended to analyse if the return on the amount invested 

in an acquisition exceeded the cost of capital, and if the acquisition helped the parent companies 

outperform. The study proved that around 48% failed both tests and 10% failed at least one test. 

Eccles, et al. (1999) also concluded that the total market-adjusted return of the acquirer went down 

at the time of the announcement for 59% of the deals. 

Such negative reactions of the markets are a result of investor scepticism regarding the acquirer’s 

ability to sustain the original value of each company and achieve the synergies needed to justify 

the premium of that acquisition (Sirower &amp;amp; Sahni, 2006).  

In order to avoid mistakes of excess premium, Sirower and Sahni (2006) created an important 

guideline, the MTP line, which defines the up-limit of the acquirer, and any deal below the MTP 

line is considered worthless. 

Sirower and Sahni (2006) also proposed a three-three matrix which results in three types of deals: 

joining companies with the same capabilities (cost synergies); or companies with different 

capabilities (revenue synergies); and deals that bring completely new capabilities (both).  

In contrast with the scepticism exposed above, Bruner (2014) argues against them with evidence 

that M&amp;amp;A does pay-off: there is a tendency to “exaggerate the extent of failure” without a location-

based approach which goes beyond the simple goals-outcome analysis. For Bruce (2014) all M&amp;amp;A 

is local. 



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 23  

In conclusion, despite several studies supporting the failure of M&amp;amp;A, the analysts should evaluate 

case by case without creating straightforward assumptions from a particular sample. It is crucial to 

adopt the best DD and post-merger approach while bearing in mind the main reasons for the failure 

of historical cases.  

2.3. Method of Payment  

Regarding payment methods, stock tends to be associated with negative returns due to the market 

signal of managers believing that shares are overpriced.  

Therefore, when payments are due in cash, the returns of target shareholders are significantly high 

in comparison with stock. In terms of materiality, the payments in stock are lower, despite the 

significantly positive returns (Bruner, 2014). Bruner (2014) also highlighted that normally larger 

deals are likely to step up the positive and negative returns, for cash and stock payment methods 

respectively.  

The main issue associated with the payment method is that with cash, the risk is solely on the buyer 

side. While in stock transactions, the targets share the risk (Rappaport &amp;amp; Sirower, 1999). 

2.4. Premium 

The most unsuccessful cases of M&amp;amp;A resulted from the inflated premiums paid by companies.  The 

high premiums can be justified in part by some failure in the DD process or post-merger issues.  

Damodaran (2005) presented three possible explanations why bidders overpay: a biased evaluation 

process, managerial hubris and failure to have a plan to effectively implement synergies. Normally, 

this overpayment is even larger in hostile acquisitions and tender offers (Huang &amp;amp; Walkling, 1987). 

However, the premiums paid are in part a reflection of the market conditions. An analysis 

conducted by Jarrell, Brickley and Netter (1998) concluded that premiums ranged between 19% 

and 35% between 1980 and 1985, suggesting that premiums are not only dependent on the value 

of synergies. 

Furthermore, Dennis &amp;amp; McConnell (1986) developed a study based on the 10 days before and after 

the announcement of an acquisition, showing that in fact nearly half the premium is already 

reflected in the acquisition price (Figure-1).

Industry Overview  
1. Market Conditions and Business Environment  

The proposed acquisition is analyzed under a context of substantial uncertainty for O&amp;amp;G 

companies. Until 2014, normal price levels ranged between $90-100/barrel, currently, prices are 

below $40/barrel: upstream O&amp;amp;G companies have been facing huge challenges with revenues 

dropping by more than 50%. 

The upstream, oilfield services and midstream sectors are the ones which have suffered intense CF 

pressure as opposed to downstream sectors which have profited from higher refining margins. 

Changes in supply and demand help justify the plummeting oil prices (Appendix 1). First, there is 

the overproduction of oil in the U.S., and the collapse of China’s economy; second, the global 

decrease in consumption results in rising storage levels, which means global crude oil supply 

exceeds demand growth. 

EIA predicts that a continuing fall in U.S. oil production throughout 2016, and an economic 

retrenchment in countries economically dependent on oil, might significantly reduce their ability 

to invest in this sector (IEA, 2015).   

Figure 1 - Cumulative Excess Return to Target Company Stock (Source: Damodaran 2005) 



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 25  

These factors imply that supply will gradually adjust to the current demand levels, though a rapid 

recovery is not anticipated because of the high stock levels.  As a result, upstream companies started 

to react with several cost saving measures in 2015. 

1.1. Supply and Demand 

Besides the ST drivers for supply and demand, others factors such as government policies, 

technological developments and global climate changes, should also be considered on a medium 

and LT perspective (Appendix 2).  

Population and economic growth are considered the two biggest drivers for energy demand 

(Figure-2): by 2040, global population is expected to grow from 7.2Bn to 9Bn and global GDP will 

be doubled (ExxonMobil, 2016) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Outlook for Energy (ExxonMobil, 2016) predicts that by 2040, oil and NG will continue to 

represent around 60% of global demand. Globally, the demand for energy is expected to rise 25% 

by 2040, 45% of which will be from non-OECD countries (Figure-3).

GDP (GDP, 2016) and Oil Prices (Crude Oil , 2016)

In terms of oil, OECD has projected an annual average growth of 1.2% on global demand until 

2021 (Table-1). The supply levels have risen throughout 2015, however, due to a significant 

number of projects deferred and cancelled, the annual average growth rate until 2021 is expected 

to be just 0.7% (OECD; IEA, 2016). Following this forecast, supply and demand of oil will only 

be aligned in 2017. 

 

 

 

 

 

As for gas, global demand is expected to rise by 50% from 2014 to 2040 (ExxonMobil, 2016) 

1.2. Prices 

The golden days where oil companies got over $100/bbl are not likely to reoccur, not even in the 

long term (Appendix 3). NG prices have also declined significantly since 2013.

Company Analysis 
1. ExxonMobil  

1.1. Overview 

ExxonMobil is the largest of the vertically integrated oil majors, with divisions and affiliated 

companies worldwide. This American multinational corporation headquartered in Texas from a 

regional U.S. company to the largest publicly traded petroleum and petrochemical enterprise in the 

world.  

With a well-diversified and integrated portfolio, ExxonMobil achieved their lead market position 

with high-quality operations.  Having upstream, downstream, chemical and NG and power 

marketing as its business segments, and reaching the worldwide market through three well-known 

brands - Exxon, Esso and Mobil - ExxonMobil has been able to reduce their exposure through 

operational and geographical diversification. 

A. Upstream  

The upstream segment includes a diverse portfolio of exploration opportunities and production of 

conventional, heavy oil, tight gas, shale gas, deepwater NG, arctic and sour gas projects. 

ExxonMobil currently has active upstream E&amp;amp;P in 36 countries with a leading resources and assets 

industry base. The Americas (35%) and Asia (34%) being the leading locations. 

ExxonMobil was able to continue to increase its portfolio by adding 1.4Bn OEB (liquids grew by 

3.2%, but NG decreased by 6%) and maintain their industry-leading resource base at approximately 

91Bn oil equivalent barrels (OEB)  with 16 years shelf life at current production rates (Appendix 

6).  

Going forward, ExxonMobil is planning to complete 10 projects in 2016 and 2017 as its near-term 

activity and its continued work of developing their large unconventional liquids-rich resource base 

in the U.S.  

B. Downstream  

ExxonMobil downstream operations are market leaders in terms of petroleum products and 

finished lubricants, leveraged by its worldwide distribution network with refining facilities in 14 



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 29  

countries and with over 5.000 owned/leased retail stations (Appendix 7). ExxonMobil has built a 

strong worldwide distribution network and its results in 2015 proved the value of its integrated 

business model.  

ExxonMobil is the leader in the industry, with 80% of its refining capacity integrated with chemical 

and lube base-stock production facilities, which are translated in important synergies and 

significant cost optimization. Innovation, world-class brands and an integrated supply chain leaves 

ExxonMobil in a good position for long-term growth.   

C. Chemical  

Finally, the chemical segment operates in 16 countries, with a major presence in North America 

(45%) and Asia Pacific (40%). The company manufactures and sells petrochemicals including 

olefins, polyolefin, aromatics, and a wide variety of specialty products.  

Globally, ExxonMobil is the largest manufacturer of aromatics and one of the largest of olefins, 

some of the highest-growth petrochemical commodities. ExxonMobil has been investing to meet 

growing demand, especially through integration with nearly 90% of its chemical capacity being 

integrated with large refineries and NG processing plants. The demand for chemical products is 

expected to grow nearly 45% over the next decade and ExxonMobil is projected to double its 

exports by 2025. 

1.2. Financials 

Taking into consideration the industry’s challenging environment, the results of 2015 demonstrated 

that ExxonMobil has a strong financial performance in relation to its peers, partly justified by its 

integrated businesses model and performance efficiency.  

Lower commodity prices and higher cost production of non-conventional oil justify the lower 

earnings of $16.2Bn, 50.3% less compared with 2014 (Figure-5). As expected, the earnings were 

down mainly as a consequence of upstream activities, which decreased $20Bn from 2014. This 

decrease was offset smoothly with an increase of $3.5Bn in the downstream and $103M in the 

chemical segments. 



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 30  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Even with lower level of earnings, its performance still reveals that ExxonMobil is a strong 

company, with assets reaching $336,758Bn and its equity representing 52,5% of assets. Total 

liabilities in 2015 were 5% less compared with 2014, however the LTD increased to $19,2Bn which 

reflects the issuance of $8Bn of LTD. Moreover, its unused committed ST and LT credit, $6Bn 

and $0,4Bn respectively, reinforces ExxonMobil’s financial strength. ExxonMobil’s 

creditworthiness is also translated by its fixed-charge coverage and consolidated debt-to-capital 

ratios of 17,6 and 18,0, respectively.  

In terms of liquidity, ExxonMobil also reached a total cash and cash equivalents of $3,7Bn, $1Bn 

less than last year. In 2015, cash and cash equivalents were used partly to purchase shares of 

ExxonMobil stock ($4Bn) and dividends ($12,1Bn). Concerning dilution, the earnings per share 

were $0,67 in 2015, a decrease of 57%.  

The cash provided by operations and asset sales totalled $33Bn, outperforming its peers 

(ExxonMobil, 2016). The company also reached an industry-leading return on average capital 

employed of 7,9% in 2015. However, due to low commodity prices and worldwide oversupply, 

ExxonMobil reacted immediately by adjusting its investment and lowering its CAPEX to $31,1Bn 

in 2015, 19,4% lower than in 2014 (Figure-6).

Nevertheless, even with a more conservative investment approach, ExxonMobil seems to be 

committed to project execution and effective cost management. ExxonMobil has been investing 

through the cycle, creating long-term shareholders’ value - its 5-years cumulative total returns 

always being higher than the industry levels prove this (Figure-7). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In general, despite the industry’s downturn, it is possible to acknowledge the superior results of 

ExxonMobil in relation to the overall industry.

2. Anadarko 

2.1. Overview 

Anadarko, founded in 1959, has its 

headquarters in Texas and is one of the 

world’s largest independent E&amp;amp;P 

companies in the O&amp;amp;G industry. With 

approximately 2,1Bn BOE of proved 

reserves, Anadarko develops, acquires 

and explores oil and NG resources 

onshore in the U.S. and in high-potential 

offshore worldwide.  

Anadarko’s asset portfolio includes U.S. onshore and Gulf of Mexico. Worldwide, Anadarko has 

activities in Algeria, Ghana, Mozambique, Colombia, the Ivory Coast, New Zealand and Kenya 

(Figure-8). 

Anadarko is organized in three main segments: O&amp;amp;G E&amp;amp;P, midstream and marketing. According 

to the ExxonMobil’s segmentation, these three segments fall under ExxonMobil’s upstream 

segment.  

A. Upstream 

The E&amp;amp;P segment has activities worldwide involving oil, condensate, NG and LNG, but the 

midstream segment is based in the U.S. and is involved in gathering, processing, treating, and 

transporting its own as well as third-party production.  

The upstream segment has its main activity in the U.S. (89% of sales), where Anadarko’s 

operations are resumed to 48 states, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and onshore Alaska (Appendix 8). 

Internationally, activities are mainly based in Algeria and Ghana, and also include LNG 

development activities in Mozambique. (Appendix 9).  

In terms of sales-volumes, the company’s product mix increased to 53% liquids in 2015 compared 

with 49% in 2014, due to the lower production levels of NG since 2013. 

Figure 8 - Anadarko's Worldwide Activity (Anadarko Petroleum Corp, 2016) 



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 33  

The gathering, processing, treating and transportation activities are crucial in order to complement 

the company’s production activities with further advantages in terms of cost management, timing 

control and value enhancement (Appendix 10). 

The midstream activities are destined both to internal and third-party customers. This segment 

includes the subsidiary WES LP which operates midstream assets (Appendix 11).  

Finally, the marketing segment is responsible for selling Anadarko’s production as well as third-

party purchased volumes. The company’s activities include oil, NG and NGLs in the U.S., but 

internationally, only oil and NGLs. (Appendix 12). 

2.2. Financials 
The company’s performance during 2015 was highly affected by the lower commodity prices with 

significant impact on its revenues, operational CF, CAPEX and future growth rates. As opposed to 

ExxonMobil, Anadarko is entirely dependent on its sales of oil, NG and NGL production, without 

an integrated business model to offset its upstream downward slope.  

Since 2014, Anadarko has had a net loss, however, the -$1,75Bn in 2014 contrasts with the loss of 

$6,7Bn in 2015 (Appendix 13). The net loss is mainly explained by the 42% decrease in sales 

revenues, following the YOY growth since 2012. In fact, even with the operating income reaching 

$8,81Bb ($5,4Bn in 2014), Anadarko was able to reduce its operating expenses by 13% while 

sustaining its production levels.  

The company’s assets have also decreased by almost 24% since 2014 and its capital structure has 

felt the imbalances, with equity representing 33% (37% in 2014) of its assets.  

As of December 2015, Anadarko had $15,72Bn of LTD. In terms of liquidity, Anadarko had 

$4,75Bn of borrowing capacity and $939M of cash available at the end of 2015. Furthermore, 

during 2015 it was also able to monetize $2,0Bn and achieved a decrease of 36% in CAPEX. 

Through these adjustments, Anadarko has been dealing with a more challenging environment 

which was also reflected in its $1,9Bn cash ($8,5Bn in 2014) from operating activities. 

Despite the compromise with enhancing operational efficiencies and reducing CAPEX, its ROCE 

decreased to -21% (6% in 2013).  



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 34  

As for dividends, Anadarko paid $553M to its common stockholders in 2015 ($505M in 2014). 

The cumulative 5-year total return of Anadarko’s common stock compared with the S&amp;amp;P500 index 

and a peer group of 11 companies1 was lower than the industry levels, as well as the S&amp;amp;P 500, 

especially since 2012 (Figure-9). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Standalone Firm’s Valuation 
In this section, ExxonMobil and Anadarko’s valuation will be developed separately through the 

APV, WACC and Relative Valuation. 

The APV and WACC valuation models are established through analyses of the company’s 

performance over the last five years and forecast for the next ten years. The last five years’ 

performance enables us to disregard not only some financial crisis effects, but more importantly, 

the lower oil commodity prices of late. Due to the lowest of oil prices in 2015, and the steady 

growth expected for the coming years, it is reasonable to forecast the CF for 10 years, when the 

main growth driver of both companies will achieve stable and sustainable price levels again.  

The relative valuation approach will be developed based on a peer group analysis and an overall 

industry perspective.  

Finally, considering the dependency of the overall industry performance on oil commodity price, 

it is important to consider the main macroeconomic drivers applied to the forecast models.

1. Macro Inputs  

The forecast model is mainly determined along with the expected evolution of oil prices, both for 

the explicit period and TV. The assumption used for the TV was based on the expected worldwide 

average of the annual percentage change of GDP (2012-2040) (U.S.EIA, 2016) (Table-3).  

The different GDP growth scenarios based on the potentially higher or lower oil prices (U.S.EIA, 

2016), will be under the assumption of different bull and bear scenarios (Table-4).  

 

 

Other macro inputs are used but they will be considered in the following section for each company 

separately.

2. ExxonMobil Standalone Valuation 
2.1. Revenues  

2.1.1.  Upstream  

The upstream revenues represent on average 9% of the total operating revenues over the last five 

years, but in absolute terms, they have been decreasing significantly, (-15% CARG). The decrease 

of upstream revenues has followed the same pattern as oil prices, but in operational terms, it has 

had different performances among liquids and NG (Figure-10). NG production and revenue has 

decreased since 2011. 

Going forward, the company’s production of liquids is expected to increase (4.3M BOE by 2017) 

with ten new projects expected to be completed by 2017. However, the geographic mix and type 

of resource are expected to be different - North America is assuming an increasingly powerful 

position. 

Even with considerable growth perspectives, the company’s revenues are limited to the growth of 

oil prices. The driver used to estimate the upstream revenues is aligned with the forecasted growth 

for crude oil prices. However, the new projects that are coming online, an outstanding performance 

in terms of operational efficiency and a strong financial flexibility, are enough to establish a growth 

of upstream revenues that outpace the commodity price growth. 

 Following this rationale, after prices hit rock bottom, revenues are expected to increase around 

6,67% until 2025 (Figure-11). Due to the delay in recovering oil prices, revenues in 2016 are 

expected to have the same downward pattern as in 2015 (-27%). 

Figure 10- ExxonMobil's Revenues and Production Levels (2011-2015) (Company Annual Reports) 



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 37  

  

 

2.1.2.  Downstream  

Downstream revenues have represented, on average, around 81% of total revenues since 2011, but 

have decreased as ExxonMobil has looked to diminish its footprint in this segment (81,07% in 

2011 to 79,89% in 2015).  

The production forecast is based on the forecasted demand for petroleum and other liquids 

(excluding petrochemicals) which is expected to decrease slightly over the next ten years (Annual 

Energy Outlook 2015 (U.S EIA)). 

The correlation between the evolution of unit revenues for downstream products and crude oil 

prices is clear. Therefore, the unit revenue will follow the same pattern as crude oil prices, except 

in 2016, when downstream revenues are not expected to be in direct correlation with oil prices.  

Overall, ExxonMobil’s average revenue per barrel of refined products is expected to move in close 

correlation with global crude oil prices. Product sales are expected to decline modestly throughout 

the forecast period (Appendix 14). 

2.1.3. Chemical  

Chemical revenues represented around 10,8% of the total sales in 2015 (8,9% in 2011). Chemical 

revenues historically have also been closely linked to oil prices and therefore the forecast will 

follow the same driver. In terms of production, chemical product sales remained stable since 2011. 

Looking ahead, due to ExxonMobil’s investments and increased capacity, their production is 

expected to increase. The forecast is based on the demand for petrochemical products (between 3% 

Figure 11 - Forecast of ExxonMobil's Upstream Revenues 



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 38  

and 3,6% until 2025) (U.S.EIA, 2016). Overall, chemical revenues are expected to grow around 

6% from 2015 until 2025. 

2.2. EBITDA Margin  

The EBITDA margin analysis highlights the value of ExxonMobil’s integrated business model, 

with EBITDA being less volatile to weak periods of lower oil prices. Over the last four years, the 

EBITDA margin on average was 17% (Figure-12). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The upstream EBITDA margin is specially affected by oil prices, but hydrocarbon production costs 

and labour costs also play an important role. Since 2012, the EBITDA margin of upstream activities 

has decreased by 7,5% (CARG) (Appendix 15).  

Going forward, it is expected that the recovery of oil prices will positively affect the EBITDA 

margin, along with growth in liquids production against NG. Conversely, the transition to 

unconventional energy sources are factors which will increase the company’s upstream expenses.  

The other two segments, downstream and chemical, are positively affected by lower crude oil 

prices (increased EBITDA YOY of 2,6% and 4,6% in 2015, respectively). Still, there are other 

important issues that should be considered (Appendix 16).  

Looking ahead, margins in the downstream segment are expected to sustain higher levels in 2016. 

Thereafter, they should return to the average level of the last four years (2,7%).

In terms of chemical products, margins have been increasing consistently since 2012 (10% to 17%). 

Going forward, they are expected to reach even higher margins in 2016, but afterwards, they should 

decrease as crude oil price recovers. 

Overall, total EBITDA margins should not change significantly over time, as seen over the last 

years.  

2.3. CAPEX, D&amp;amp;A and Working Capital  

ExxonMobil announced its plans to cut on CAPEX in reaction to lower oil prices ($23,2Bn in 2016, 

$8Bn less).  

Historically, the upstream segment has accounted, on average, for more than 85% of the total 

CAPEX. In absolute terms, net upstream CAPEX has increased significantly as the company 

focuses on new upstream growth projects. In line with what happened in 2015, the next two years 

are expected to have smaller absolute levels of CAPEX and going forward, it should increase 

gradually, along with oil price recovery (6% CARG 2015-2025). 

Following the strategy of ExxonMobil to reduce its focus on the downstream sector in favour of 

upstream exploration, the downstream CAPEX has fallen since 2009. However, due to its recent 

investments, ExxonMobil reached more than 25% growth YOY in 2015. Going forward, 

downstream’s CAPEX should average at the same levels as the last four years.  

The Chemical segment’s CAPEX clearly highlights the large projects that ExxonMobil has been 

investing in. After a growth of 20% since 2011, these projects are expected to still demand CAPEX 

until 2017. Going forward, it is expected that chemical’s CAPEX will decline gradually.  

Overall, in the next two years CAPEX is expected to decrease, but afterwards it should grow along 

with oil prices recovery (Table-5). New assets will depreciate at the rate of the existing assets (7% 

- average depreciation rate since 2011).

The working capital for the forecast period is the net of free cash and STD (Table-6). The forecast 

BS separates operational cash and free-cash: operational cash is based on the average weight of 

total revenues, and the free-cash results from the earnings that will be generated over the forecast 

period, net of dividends, investments in CAPEX and debt obligations. The additional notes and 

forecasted FS are detailed in the appendix 17. 

 

2.4. Valuation 

2.4.1. APV 

APV, according to Luehrman (1997), outperforms WACC by separately considering CF from 

business operations and financing strategies. Different assumptions were made, especially to 

determine the discount rate, the TV and the BC.  

Firstly, the CAPM is used to determine the discount rate, consequently, risk-free, MRP and beta 

are needed. The risk-free is assumed as the yield on the U.S.’s 10-year TB (Copeland, Koller, &amp;amp; 

Murrin, 1991), based on the geometric mean of the last 10 years (2,53%). Since the TB yield in the 

U.S. ranged between 4,7% and 1,76% over the last decade, it seems more accurate to use this 

average in order to avoid the volatility of special one-time events. Furthermore, it is important that 

the risk-free has the same duration as the analysed cash-flows, consequently, the U.S.’s 10-year 

TB are also more adequate than bonds with a lower maturity. 

Regarding MRP, the same approach was used since it was considered the arithmetic average of the 

implied premium verified during the last decade, which results in a premium of 5,32%.  

Considering the beta of ExxonMobil’s peer group (1,145), and after adjusting this beta to the capital 

structure of ExxonMobil, the unlevered beta used is 0,89. Applying the CAPM, the unlevered cost 

of capital is 7,27% (Appendix 18).  

In order to calculate the tax shield, the CTR applied was 35%, the U.S. federal statutory income 

tax rate. Despite an ongoing debate regarding the discount rate used to value the tax shields, the

perspective (as supported by most academics) of using cost of debt to discount tax shields, was 

used. 

The third step is to evaluate the expected BC.  In theory, this requires the estimation of the 

probability of default and the BC - the more challenging part since they cannot be deducted directly. 

Therefore, one way is to estimate a bond rating and use the respective empirical estimates of default 

probability. For a company with the same credit rating as ExxonMobil, the cumulative probability 

of default over ten years is 0,03% (Damodaran A. , The Cost of Distress: Survival, Truncation Risk 

and Valuation, 2006). Throughout the following formula, it is possible to convert the cumulative 

probability of default on an annual basis: 

1?(1??????????)
?, where ????????? is the annual probability of distress 

Thus, the annual probability of default is 0,003%. In terms of BC, there are different studies that 

have looked at this issue, but the one considered here was the method proposed by Korteweg 

(2007), where the BC are found to be around 2,6% of the firm’s unlevered value (Appendix 19). 

 

 

 

 

 

The total amount of BC discounted at the risk-free is $12,34M (Table-7). The financial distress 

CFs should not be discounted at a discount rate above the risk-free (Almeida &amp;amp; Philippon, 2004) 

Finally, for the TV, the growth rate was based on the expected annual average per cent change of 

GDP worldwide. After considering the weight of future demand for O&amp;amp;G energy for OECD and 

non-OECD countries, the growth rate used was 3,32%.  

In conclusion, according to APV, the Entreprise Value of ExxonMobil is $403,98Bn and the Equity 

Value is $362,79Bn (Table-8) (Appendix 20).

2.4.2. WACC 

Besides the steps already developed, the cost of debt is needed to value ExxonMobil through the 

WACC. Capital structure and the adjusted cost of equity based on a levered beta is detailed above.   

The cost of debt was computed through the risk-free plus the default-risk spread according to the 

company’s probability of default. Thus, following the estimation presented by Korteweg (2007), 

the company’s cost of debt is 3,28%. This was the method that seemed to be the most appropriate 

since the cost of debt calculated through the ratio of interest expenses (excluding non-debt related 

expenses) over net debt, fluctuated significantly. 

Lastly, the element needed to reach the cost of capital is the company’s capital structure. Over the 

last few years, the company’s debt-to-value ratio has ranged widely between 3% and 10,7%, 

averaging 6%. Using the average leverage level of the last four years seems to be the more 

reasonable assumption. 

Considering this capital structure, the levered beta used to calculate the cost of equity was also 

adjusted through the following formula: 

??=[1+(1??) 
?

?
]?? 

Finally, with all assumptions described, the WACC is 7,13% (Appendix 21), the company’s EV is 

$413,65Bn and the Equity Value is $372,48Bn (Table-9) (Appendix 22).

2.4.3. Relative valuation  

Relative valuation is an important complement to the WACC and APV method, since it brings the 

advantage of including market expectations and confronts them with company specific 

assumptions. The peer group selection was determined based on two main drivers: risk levels and 

business models (Appendix 23).  

 

 

ExxonMobil has been historically traded at a premium compared to its peers (Table-10). It has the 

highest market capitalization, the lowest leverage level and the highest return on capital.  

In terms of price to EV-to-EBITDA and Price-to-FCF, ExxonMobil stands out, reflecting the 

market’s confidence in the company’s future stocks (Appendix 24).  However, its price-to-earnings 

ratio is below its peers’ average, probably due to the maturity level of ExxonMobil. 

The price-to-market ratio of ExxonMobil is higher than its peers, which could mean overvaluation. 

However, it does not necessarily mean that the company is overvalued, instead it translates the 

market premium due to the company’s resilience to deal with peaks of low and high prices.  

Nevertheless, as a consequence of different capital structures, the EV ratios are usually the best to 

accurately develop a relative valuation. Between EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT, since this industry

has high levels of capital invested, the ratio in relation to EBITDA also has the advantage of being 

insensitive to depreciations. 

Table-11 summarizes the relative valuation of ExxonMobil based on peers and on general industry 

multiples (Damodaran A. , Damodaran, 2016) 

 

  

Indeed, after applying these multiples, the results based on EV/EBITDA are the most aligned with 

the other valuation methods already developed and the market consensus.  

2.5. Sensitivity Analysis   

Considering the volatility and complexity of the oil industry, developing a sensitivity analysis is 

essential. The bull and bear scenario are defined upon two different growth rates applied to the TV: 

the bull scenario applies a growth rate for the TV of 3,5%, contrasting with 3,14% applied to the 

bear scenario. These different growth rates reflect the higher or lower potential prices for oil in the 

future. 

Furthermore, in order to reflect these scenarios over the explicit forecast period, the growth rate for 

crude oil prices also changed by plus and minus 2% for the bear and bull scenario, respectively. 

 

 

 

 

 

Following this analysis, the share price of ExxonMobil changes between $73,69 and $102,71 

considering the APV model, and $75,44 and $105,77 considering the WACC model (Table-12).

2.6. Valuation Output 

Comparing the valuation results from the different methods, two main conclusions can be 

highlighted: there is a reasonable consensus within the lowest value provided by each method 

($70,22 and $78,5), however the highest value changes significantly, which can be justified by 

some of the limitations of particular methods (Figure-13).  

The WACC and APV results are similar and are relatively aligned with the market consensus 

(Appendix 25), both for the lowest and highest valuations. However, the multiples approach, 

especially the one based on the overall industry, provided unreasonable values for ExxonMobil. 

3. Anadarko Standalone Valuation 
3.1. Revenues 

The analysis of sales volume and price evolution of oil, NG and NGL over the last four years 

provide some important inputs to develop the forecast and understand the company’s strategic 

decisions.  

The following graph highlights the consistent growth of oil and NGL volume sales since 2011 as 

opposed to NG. Anadarko derives all of its NG production from the U.S. where the over-supply 

has resulted in depressed domestic NG prices, with liquids becoming far more profitable.  

The forecast applied to the sales volume followed the same pattern as worldwide oil and NGL 

production, as well as that of NG consumption.

The oil volume sales had such a significant growth over the last four years (10,1% CARG 2011-

2015) that it is not expected to be as significant for the forecast period (2,7% CARG 2015-2020 

and 1,5 % CARG 2020-2025). The recent decline in oil prices has obligated Anadarko to claw 

black on CAPEX, however, after 2020 it should start to recover with the predicted higher oil prices 

(Appendix 26). 

The correlation between NGL and crude oil prices result in these two commodities tending to 

follow the same pattern, both in terms of price and production. NGL production will reach 3% 

CARG 2015-2025 (4,9% CARG 2011-2015) 

After a decrease from 7,2% (2011) to -9,8% (2014), NG production will follow the same decreasing 

pattern over the forecast period, reaching -3,8% in 2020. Afterwards, it is expected to recover again, 

slowly reaching a 1,7% CARG in 2025. The growth rate assumption used to forecast the volumes 

of NG production follows the expected growth for the worldwide NG consumption, but after 2020, 

it is expected to outpace it by 1% due to predicted recovery prices and the increased pace of 

development of Anadarko’s onshore assets. 

Following on from this, liquids are expected to represent, on average, 57% of the sales volume-

mix, contrasting with the 46% verified over the historical period. The unit prices closely follow the 

estimated prices provided by the U.S. EIA.  

 
3.2. EBITDA Margin 

Anadarko’s EBITDA margin reached 57% in 2012,  at its peak of high commodity prices. But 

since 2014, this figure has decreased significantly to negative values. In 2015, the company 

EBITDA margin was less than -48%. 

It is expected that Anadarko's EBITDA margin will increase gradually over time with commodity 

prices recovering to around 46% by the end of the forecast period (Figure-14).

The depreciation rate used was 6,1% for the existing assets, which is the average depreciation rate 

since 2011. For the new assets, the depreciation rate applied was 7%.  

The WC for the forecast period is the net of STD, and the other components of current assets and 

current liabilities are calculated through the average weight of the last four years in relation to 

revenues (Table-14).The additional notes and forecasted FS are detailed in the appendix 28. 

3.4. Valuation 

3.4.1. APV 

The steps developed to calculate Anadarko’s valuation throughout APV were the same already 

explained for ExxonMobil. Due to both companies operating in the same industry and being based 

in the same country with worldwide operations, most of the assumptions applied followed the same 

reasoning. 

The discount rate based on the unlevered beta calculated throughout the CAPM for Anadarko is 

7,45%, and the risk-free (2,53%) and MRP (5,32%) used was exactly the same as ExxonMobil 

(Appendix 29). However, the unlevered beta was calculated based on Anadarko’s peer group, and 

adjusting it to its capital structure. Anadarko’s peer group’s unlevered beta is 1,58 for an average 

debt-to-equity ratio of 1,09, which after adjustments resulted in an unlevered beta of 0,92. 

The CTR used was 35%, the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and the tax shield were 

discounted using the cost of debt.

The BC were determined throughout the same pattern as ExxonMobil, but considering that 

Anadarko has a bond rating of BBB, its cumulative probability of default on an annual basis is 

0,435%. Anadarko had a negative EBIT in 2015, thus its negative ICR would mean a spread 

equivalent to a D2/D rating. Thus, the applied rating was based on its rating of LTD established by 

S&amp;amp;P and Fitch as of December 31, 2015. The BC applied were also based on a percentage 

suggested by Korteweg (2007) (2,6%) (Table-15). 

 

 

 

 

Finally, the assumption under the growth rate applied to the TV was also 3,2%. In conclusion, 

using the APV method, the EV of Anadarko is $40,9Bn and the equity value is $23,5 Bn (Table-

16) (Appendix 30). 

 

 

 

 

3.4.2. WACC 

The valuation of Anadarko through the WACC demands for further assumptions. The cost of debt 

combines the risk-free of 2,53% plus the default-risk spread of 2,25%. As explained before, the 

default-risk spread was determined based on a rating of BBB, which corresponds to 2,25% of the 

spread.  Thus, the cost of debt of Anadarko is 4,78%.  

The capital structure of Anadarko has changed quite significantly over the last year, with its debt-

to-equity ratio changing from around 40% to more than 60%. However, considering the forecast 

for oil prices, it is not expected that Anadarko will be able to go back to the usual debt-to-equity

ratios in the ST. Although, the assumed target debt-to-asset ratio was 44%, since Damodaran 

proposes this for upstream O&amp;amp;G companies. Moreover, by assuming this capital structure, the debt-

to-equity ratio of 79% is in line with the average of the forecasted leverage (78% in BV). 

Assuming this capital structure, the levered beta of Anadarko is 1,40, after the respective 

adjustment based on its peer group’s beta. Finally, the cost of capital under the WACC is 6,94% 

(Appendix 31), the company’s EV is $ 42,59Bn and the equity value is $25,19Bn (Table-17) 

(Appendix 32). 

 

 

 

 

3.4.3. Relative Valuation 

Applying the relative valuation has some particularities that limit the usage of this approach with 

Anadarko. Multiples as EV-to-EBITDA and EV-to-EBIT are not material if EBITDA and EBIT 

are negative, which is the case of Anadarko as of December 2015.  

Due to the different capital structures of Anadarko’s peer group (Table-18), with debt-to-equity 

ratio ranging from 0,34 to 3,42, EV ratios are the more accurate. Thus, EV-to-EBITDA and EV-

to-EBIT should be applied.  Nevertheless, since both figures, EBITDA and EBIT, are negative, the 

way to apply them is through normalized or forward values. Applying the forward average of 

EBITDA for the next five years seems to be an accurate alternative.

The relative valuation of Anadarko was based on a peer group composed by seven companies, all 

based in the U.S with only upstream activities. (Appendix 33). 

Following this peer group and after applying the Forward EV-to-EBITDA and Forward EV-to-

EBIT to Anadarko, the final results are significantly different from the ones reached with APV and 

WACC. The Forward EV-to-EBITDA (5y) is the only one which provides a valuation that can be 

considered, since it is not so different from the market consensus (Table-19) (Appendix 34).  

3.5.  Sensitivity Analysis   

The sensitivity analysis was developed based on the same assumptions as ExxonMobil (Table-20). 

 

 

 

 

 

Following this analysis, the share price of Anadarko ranges between $24,09 and $74,36 for APV 

and $22,81 and $83,63 considering WACC.  

3.6. Valuation Output 

The valuation output for Anadarko reached very different results (Figure-15). In terms of multiples, 

the only one which is rather aligned is the Forward EV-to-EBITDA (5y). The optimistic scenario 

based on the WACC presents the highest valuation, but considering the base case scenario, both 

WACC and APV are aligned with the market consensus.

Merged Entity 
1. Rationale for this transaction 

Although the decrease in oil prices recently suffered presents a challenging period for most 

companies in the industry, at the same time it is an opportunity for companies with strong BS who 

can use their cash reserves and their lower leverage ratios to engage in deals that benefit them with 

undervalued assets and that can reaffirm their competitive position in the future.  

ExxonMobil is one of the few companies that can easily benefit from the underpriced targets 

available in the market, due to its strong BS and cash availability. 

Looking for the potential targets of ExxonMobil, different companies could be interesting targets 

in terms of underpricing. However, a financial driver alone cannot explain the rationale behind a 

buyout, operational synergies are also demanded to justify such a decision during this challenging 

period.

Besides being one of many that has become a lot cheaper, Anadarko emerged as an interesting 

target due to its high-quality asset base in the Gulf of Mexico and US shale.   

Major international O&amp;amp;G companies have faced competition from mini-majors such as Anadarko, 

which have been assuming an important position in North American shale production. ExxonMobil 

is one of the majors which has invested more determinedly in order to face this threat, and the XTO 

Energy acquisition in 2009 was part to this strategic move. 

Acquiring Anadarko would make ExxonMobil one of the largest onshore U.S. operators which is 

in-line with the company’s strategy. Furthermore, significant cost savings can arise from common 

areas where both companies are operating. 

Obviously, when considering a company such as ExxonMobil which already produces 2.3% of the 

world’s oil and is recognized for its safety practices and leadership in delivering projects on time, 

there are few mini-majors that can significantly influence the production and efficiency levels of 

ExxonMobil. However, in a period of low oil prices, ExxonMobil has the financial conditions to 

capture high-quality assets and low-risk development opportunities through the acquisition of 

undervalued companies such as Anadarko.   

2. Valuation of the Merged Entity 

Following the model proposed by Damodaran (2005), the valuation of the merged entity will be 

split into three steps: value of combined firm without synergies (1); revalued the combined firm 

including synergies (2) and calculate the synergies through the difference between the first and 

second step (3).  

Thus, ExxonMobil and Anadarko will be valuated first, based on the same assumption used over 

the standalone valuation, and consequently, the value of the merged entity with no synergies must 

be exactly the same as the sum of the values of each independent firm. Secondly, the valuation of 

the combined firm should include all the synergies that arise from their combination. Lastly, the 

value of synergies can be isolated by subtracting the valuation with and without synergies.   

2.1 Valuation without synergies 

The valuation with no synergies must guarantee that the combined entity is based on the same 

structural assumption. From the valuation methods used for standalone valuation, only the WACC 



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 54  

will be considered in this section, since APV and WACC resulted in a similar conclusion in the 

standalone analysis. 

The new combined IS and BS stand up from the simple and direct sum of all rubrics existing in 

each company’s standalone FS (Appendix 35). Still, some elements should be explained in more 

detail. 

Starting with the revenues, it is important to clarify that the combined revenues impacted only the 

upstream segment. 

The other important issue which deserves clarification is the discount rate. Regardless of all scale 

differences, both companies are equally exposed to the same industry challenges and the same 

governmental regulations, since they both have their headquarters in the U.S.. Accordingly, both 

ExxonMobil and Anadarko will have the same Risk-free, MRP and CTR. 

However, the companies’ debt leverage is significantly different, and consequently, the 

independent capital structure and cost of debt are dissimilar. These differences impact the beta and 

the spread used to calculate the discount rate. Following that, the best approach to value the 

combined entities without changing the original assumptions was to consider a weighted average 

approach based on each individual EV. Finally, the growth rate applied for the TV was the same 

for both companies and, therefore, the one used for the merged company.  

In conclusion, considering this approach, the final EV value of the combined firm was $456,04Bn, 

which differs slightly from the $456,26Bn obtained through the simple sum of both companies’ 

EV. A potential explanation for this difference is the impact that different discount rates can have 

across the different assets since this impact is not always in the same proportion. However, since 

this difference is not significant, it will be ignored and the EV value to be used in the last step to 

calculate synergies will be the one based on the sum of both companies. 

This approach ignores the potential fact that existing shareholders still do not want their part in the 

new entity and therefore it is assumed that there is no need for increasing debt and making changes 

on the capital structure.

2.2 Synergies  

After developing the first step, it is important to do a careful analysis over why one plus one could 

be bigger than two, i.e. synergies which make this deal valuable.  

Damodaran (2005) grouped synergies into operating and financial. Both will be discussed in this 

section.  

2.2.1 Operating  

2.2.1.1 Revenues 

The literature review already mentioned that revenue synergies are the most difficult to implement. 

However, if they are normally problematic, for natural resources companies they are even more so. 

In O&amp;amp;G companies, the challenge arises from the fact that they do not have control over market 

prices (Appendix 36).  

Another way to increase revenues could be through increasing production, however for O&amp;amp;G 

companies, it takes time to have projects up and running (Appendix 37). 

In conclusion, for both sources of revenue synergies, either an increase in unit price or an increase 

in production volumes are difficult to achieve, and that is why revenue synergies are not going to 

be considered in this case.  

2.2.1.2 Operating Costs 

As opposed to revenue synergies, costs are the most reliable sources of synergies. Reducing costs 

is normally easier because they are more dependent on internal issues. Asides from this, the fact 

that they are fast to implement and have perpetual results, makes them more attractive. 

However, looking in particular at the O&amp;amp;G industry, it is interesting to realize that the M&amp;amp;A’s role 

has different drivers according to changes in commodity prices. During periods of increasing oil 

prices, the dominant driver is growth, whereas in flat or depressed periods, improvements on ROIC 

through cost reduction and capital efficiency are the most common drivers. 

The latter being the one behind the rationale of this deal, thus cost synergies are crucial to determine 

the value of this acquisition. There are a couple of cost synergies which could be highlighted in 

this deal, especially due to the adjacency of ExxonMobil and Anadarko’s operations in the U.S..  





Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 57  

Looking at the combined IS, the synergies can arise from cutting costs in O&amp;amp;G operating activities; 

transportation; production and manufacturing; exploration and G&amp;amp;A expenses.  

Reducing headcount and G&amp;amp;A function is highly probable when considering a parent company 

such as ExxonMobil, with hundreds of thousands employees. Probably both companies have 

headquarters in common cities and no longer need two separate buildings. Potential synergies can 

also arise from exploration costs. Being as both use the Successful Effort method of accounting, 

these will simply be considered as other operating costs.  

Lastly, the remaining operating costs related with sales-based taxes cost synergies should not be 

considered, as these are controlled by government and industry-wide regulations. 

Therefore, most benefits from this deal are likely to arise during the post-merger integration process 

through its substantial divestments - which are crucial when looking for opportunities to 

significantly reduce costs in today’s environment. 

However, with not enough information to be able to go into detail and create reasonable 

assumptions for each cost category, the synergy model was developed based on the following 

statistics: on average, M&amp;amp;A deals in the O&amp;amp;G industry result in 2,4% of combined target sales 

(BCG; TUM, 2013) ; 67% of cost synergies are successfully captured (PwC’s Deals M&amp;amp;A, 2014) 

and in the former deal between Exxon and Mobil, from the total synergies, Exxon realised two-

thirds of cost savings (Appendix 39) (Christopher, Harris, &amp;amp; Chavan, 2012) 

Based on the above sources and considering that Anadarko’s U.S. revenues account for 31% of the 

combined upstream revenues, the cost synergies stemmed in approximately 0,02% of the total 

combined entity’s operating costs. This percentage seems to portray quite a conservative scenario, 

but in fact, it should be remembered that this deal is affecting just one segment of the combined 

company and it is bringing together two companies from completely different scales.  

Finally, in order to calculate the total cost synergies, CAPEX potential synergies should be 

considered. Since ExxonMobil and Anadarko are operating in common areas, some overlap in 

terms of projected investments is expected. Due to the lack of information in terms of CAPEX 

projections for these regions, the assumptions used were also conservative: 5% reduction for 

Anadarko and 10% for ExxonMobil. For ExxonMobil, this percentage was applied to the 

proportion of upstream CAPEX in the U.S. (average of 26% since 2011). For Anadarko, it was 



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 58  

applied to the total amount of CAPEX since the existing information does not distinguish between 

U.S. and non-U.S. CAPEX. 

 Nonetheless, since CAPEX synergies are assumed to be PP&amp;amp;E, the depreciation expenses were 

deducted proportionally to the reduction in CAPEX (Table-21). 

It should be noted that CAPEX synergies will not have a direct positive impact in the earnings. 

However, the main objective with a basin- and regional-density deal driven by cost reduction and 

improved ROIC is to optimize the combined portfolio in order to have the most capital-efficient 

projects. Indirectly, reaching a better ROIC means to create higher shareholder returns.   

2.2.2 Financial 

In terms of financial synergies, three different drivers stand out in M&amp;amp;A deals: 

? Combining the excess cash and few investment opportunities of one company to one with 

high-return projects and yet, little available cash to invest;  

? Tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses or higher depreciations  

? Higher debt capacity 

ExxonMobil is a company with excess cash, however in terms of investment opportunities and 

attractiveness there is no significant differences between both companies.  

As for the second driver, Anadarko’s EBIT was only negative at the 2015 year-end and there is no 

significant net operating losses accumulated to consider this as a source of financial synergies. In 

terms of depreciations, neither ExxonMobil nor Anadarko are expected to be able to increase their 

depreciation.  

Lastly, considering standalone figures and looking at the new capital structure, Anadarko will 

definitely benefit in terms of debt capacity. Consequently, even considering the higher leverage of 

Anadarko, due to ExxonMobil’s cash availability and lower debt leverage, the combined firms 

should be considered safer.

In theory, this safeness should be translated in higher debt capacity and in lower cost of debt. After 

combining both companies without synergies, the new debt-to-equity ratio considering market 

values is 16%. In contrast, ExxonMobil had a ratio of 10,7% in 2015 and an average of 6% over 

the last five years.  

Including synergies, the average debt-to-asset ratio of the explicit forecast period is 7% and 

therefore this was the basis for the target capital structure. Following this capital structure, it is not 

expected that the interest rates used to value ExxonMobil will change. Which means higher savings 

in terms of interest expenses which are partly offset as a consequence of the interest-tax shield.  

Finally, the cost of debt was also determined in the standalone valuation, considering the same risk-

free and the ICR of 9,42 translated in a spread of 0,75%. This last element was based on forecasted 

figures for 2016. The beta used was based on the ExxonMobil’s peer group beta. This peer group 

is still the most appropriate for the new merged entity. Then, the new discount rate applied to 

WACC is 7,11% (Appendix 40).  

2.3 Integration Costs 

For the synergies analysis, high consideration was given to cost reduction, but these types of 

synergies involve a great effort in terms of integration. Consequently, it is important to take into 

account integration costs and discount them from the total value of synergies.  

However, this is a demanding process which involves detailed knowledge about the specific 

synergies and inside information to clearly evaluate them. Thus, a generic assumption will be made.  

Summarizing, the integration costs can be separated into two phases: transaction process and the 

steps needed to exploit synergies. During the first phase, the typical costs are related to law firms, 

existing taxes and consulting assistance. Going forward, in order to proceed with workforce 

adjustments, build a new entity, integrate all operational adjustments and internally recreate the 

new entity’s culture and structure, significant investments will be required.  

The assumption used was based on the survey developed by EY in 2013 which argues that, on 

average, companies spend 14% of the total deal value on integration costs (Ernst and Young, 2014).

2.4 Valuation with Synergies  

The last step to value the merged entity with synergies is finally possible. Through the WACC 

method, the merged entity including synergies is $490,22Bn, which means that they account for 

$33,96Bn (Appendix 41). Considering integration costs of $ $4,75Bn, the EV is $485,47Bn (Table-

22).   

 

 

 

 

Comparing the value of the net synergies of integration costs with the value reached for Anadarko, 

highlights the relative magnitude of this amount. The net synergies account for $29,20Bn, more 

than Anadarko’s equity value ($25,19Bn). 

Following the same assumptions applied before in the sensitivity analysis, the value of the merged 

entity ranges between $353,7Bn and $518,87Bn (Table-23).

The Acquisition 

There are advantages and disadvantages associated with the different ways of proceeding, however 

the spectrum is not completely free.  

This deal is obviously only possible in one way: the first acquires the second. However, Anadarko 

has some provisions which could make the negotiation process more challenging. Minimizing the 

size of the control premium and the transaction costs will be part of the strategic objectives of 

ExxonMobil and, therefore, will be addressed in this analysis.   

1. Mode of Acquisition 

The negotiation process can be carried out as a friendly takeover, which means that settlements are 

made in an informal dialogue that allows for an agreement to be reached early in the process. 

However, it can also be subject to a hostile acquisition. 

The reasons behind hostile takeovers are many and different theories try to explain them. The 

history of hostile takeovers shows that they are more common during periods when the stock 

market is not soaring (DePamphilis, 2010), since shareholders are more willing to accept offers 

when their shares are overvalued.  

In fact, considering the current low valuation of the majority of O&amp;amp;G companies due to low 

commodity prices, the perception for shareholders is probably that the shares are undervalued. 

Therefore, using a hostile takeover approach would be apparently the right way for ExxonMobil. 

However, Anadarko has certain provisions on its restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws 

which limit the suitable approaches available to ExxonMobil.  

Anadarko has some common takeover defences (Appendix 42), but besides that, it is also subject 

to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (D.G.C.L.) (Appendix 43) which imposes 

restrictions on business combination with interested stockholders – i.e. owning at least 15% of the 

outstanding voting stock. Obviously, all these provisions do not make the deal impossible, but will 

demand for a higher premium. 



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 62  

Therefore, and since these provisions do not apply if Anadarko's board approves the transaction 

before ExxonMobil becomes an interested stockholder, ExxonMobil should begin negotiations by 

approaching the board in a friendly manner.  

Thus, ExxonMobil should initiate an informal dialogue with Anadarko’s top management and try 

to reach an agreement on the key issues, namely, long-term business strategy of the new merged 

entity, key management positions and short-term operations. Until it has the standstill agreement, 

ExxonMobil will not make any investment in Anadarko before the corporate board approves this 

transaction.  

This acquisition is based on the assumption that ExxonMobil views Anadarko as an undervalued 

company, but the existing anti-takeover provisions will demand for a significant premium. 

However, due to the implications of the lowest commodity prices in history on the company’s 

valuation, this is the best time to go forward with this acquisition. 

2. Distribution of Synergy Benefits 

Looking at the degree of relatedness, this deal is clearly a horizontal acquisition, where both 

companies will essentially benefit from their adjacency. 

A great percentage of synergies arise from cost synergies, and neither company has an operating 

competitive advantage or a special market position over the other. However, a proportional division 

of synergies based on EV would not be reasonable since ExxonMobil has an EV almost 10 times 

bigger than Anadarko. The rationale behind this deal is a result of ExxonMobil’s strategy to 

increase its share in the upstream segment in North America, and consequently, using the 

percentage of upstream sales seems a more reasonable approach to split synergies. Thus, 

ExxonMobil and Anadarko will receive 69% and 31% of the total amount of synergies, respectively 

(Figure-17).

3. Premium Offered  

Anadarko’s standalone valuation suggests an equity value of $27,83Bn, 13% upside potential 

compared with $24,69Bn - its average market capitalization during 2015. Consequently, the new 

equity value with synergies is $36,81Bn, 32% upside potential compared to the standalone 

valuation. Thus, the value of synergies, along with Anadarko’s undervaluation, results in a 

premium of 49% (Table-24). 

 

 

4. Method of Payment  

The existing fundamentals to choose between cash or stock tends to support deals financed with 

cash rather than stock. The lack of confidence assumed with stock offers, due to the opportunity to 

share risk, is one of the reasons that justify the worst market reactions. In this case, since synergies 

were calculated under a conservative scenario (67% probability of realization), there is no reason 

to use stocks to share the risk with Anadarko’s stockholders.  

This argument further supports the initial position of proceeding with a deal based on a cash 

payment. However, the company’s ability to effectively pay with cash without harming its capital

structure or negatively impacting its current capital structure is an important factor that must be 

considered.  

As suggested by Damodaran (2006), the ICR can be used as a proxy to estimate the maximum 

amount of debt that the company can take and still have the same investment grade. Since this deal 

involves the acquisition of a company which is 10 times smaller than the acquirer, it would be 

unreasonable to assume that Anadarko would be able to really affect ExxonMobil’s credit rating. 

In fact, the merged entity’s synergies has an ICR in line with a rating of Aaa/AAA.  

The merged entity without synergies has an ICR of 9,01 (Table-25) and in order to maintain a 

minimum of 8,5 ICR, it can have a maximum amount of debt of $97,48Bn, which means being 

able to issue another $47,46Bn. This new amount of debt already represents 129% of the total price 

offered for this acquisition ($36,81Bn). 

 

However, considering that ExxonMobil also has $ 3,56Bn available in cash and unused committed 

ST and LT lines of credit with a total amount of $6,4Bn, it has in total $57,42Bn available, which 

is more than the total price offered. Thus, it is possible to assume that ExxonMobil can acquire 

Anadarko with cash and still maintain its financial flexibility (Table-26).

5. The Takeover Bid 

Overall, an offer with a 49% premium and the ability to proceed with a cash offer, are reasons to 

believe that ExxonMobil’s offer will be perceived as friendly, which is truly important due to the 

Anadarko's takeover restrictions, in particular the D.G.C.L.. Still, having a detailed DD that is able 

to clarify the value added with this deal is crucial for the friendly takeover to be successful.  

  



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 66  

Conclusion  

All companies in the O&amp;amp;G industry experienced a drop in valuation due to the current prices. This 

has resulted in increasing financial pressure and significant market uncertainty. Despite being a 

challenging period for most companies in the industry, it is also an opportune time to invest in 

undervalued assets. 

The rationale of this proposed deal emerged as a consequence of ExxonMobil’s strong BS, together 

with its desire to build on its upstream activity in North America and pursue its goal of remaining 

at the forefront of the industry worldwide. Through cash reserves and lower leverage ratios, 

ExxonMobil can look for a target with valuable resources such as Anadarko. 

Anadarko is deemed an attractive target due to its valuable resources in North America, but 

specially due to the potential for cutting overhead costs and optimizing on overlapping operations. 

Being operationally efficient and able to cut costs without losing competitiveness is the desired 

scenario of every company in the industry at the moment. 

Thus, due to the strategic reasons behind this deal, costs account for the majority of the estimated 

synergies. The uncontrolled market prices of a standalone company explain why revenue synergies 

were not considered in this case. Besides cost synergies, financial synergies were also accounted 

to a lesser extent. In total, net synergies accounted for $29,2Bn, which represent 69% of 

Anadarko’s EV.  

Concerning the acquisition, ExxonMobil should acquire Anadarko through a friendly approach 

supported by a cash offer with a premium of 49%.

Appendixes 
Appendix 1: How to justify the collapse of oil and gas prices? 

During 2015, supply continued to feed the storage levels, especially in Saudi Arabia, with OPEC 

giving priority to protect their market share. Furthermore, the cut of U.S.’s production levels has 

been lower than what was predicted by industry analysts. In addition, there is uncertainty regarding 

the potential increase in production that is expected to arise from Iran, a country which was freed 

from nuclear sanctions and wants to recover market share. 

Despite the efforts to decrease total U.S. production since the middle of 2015 and the agreement 

established between some OPEC members and Russia in mid-February to freeze production to the 

levels of January 2016, there is still doubt about the effectiveness of such measures regarding the 

oil price.  

Upstream companies started to react to this low price environment in 2015 with cash conservation 

measures, plans for cost reductions through manpower layoffs, renegotiation or cancellation of 

supply contracts and postponement of capital projects. 

Appendix 2: Global demand and supply of oil and gas 

Technical innovations have been assuming a critical influence concerning cost reduction and access 

to new exploration areas which was impossible to explore in the past. This fact along with 

improvements in energy efficiency and changes in major economies of developing countries 

explain the world peak of oil supply.  

Concerning oil, OPEC and U.S. are the leaders with production levels of more than 1 million and 

0.8 million barrels per day, respectively (OECD; IEA, 2016). 

In relation to gas, the rising of renewables along with very cheap coal have shown sluggish growth 

in the gas demand in the OECD countries, particularly in Japan where demand is expected to fall. 

The price-demand sensitivity of non-OECD Asian countries is an uncertainty (IEA, 2015) and in 

the medium-long term, it is questionable if gas will be competitive enough to be more than a 

shortage option. The environmental restriction will be indisputably a strong incentive, but not 

enough to have a radical impact on demand.  



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 68  

According to International Energy Agency (2015), the global LNG export capacity will represent 

more than 40% of the current capacity. However, due to the capital intensive investment associated 

with LNG and considering the current low prices, it is expected that part of the new LNG plants 

will struggle to be effectively concretized.  

Appendix 3: Oil Prices 

The World Bank (2016) is changing its forecast for lower oil prices, both for short and long-term 

perspective. In the short-term perspective the forecasted average price is $37/bbl in 2016, 

contrasting with $51/bbd expected in January of 2015 and in the long-term, the forecast changed 

from $100/bbd to $82,6/bbd. 

Appendix 4: Unconventional energy sources 

Technology-driven supplies explain the difference between the 1 trillion barrels of recoverable 

crude and condensate resources estimated to exist in 1981 by U.S. geological survey and the 4,5 

trillion barrels currently estimated. These energy sources along with renewal energy are expected 

to be enough to face the global demand growth beyond 21 century (IEA, 2015).  

Following The Outlook for Energy (ExxonMobil, 2016)all energy sources will grow until 2040 

with massive increase in cleaner fuels, in particular, natural gas which will grow 70% comparing 

with levels of 2014. From the natural gas growth, one-third is due to unconventional gas and arises 

mostly from North America (60%).   

Still, this new era of unconventional energy sources and renewable energy is full of uncertainties 

and the consequences for oil and gas companies are not entirely understood. However, lower prices 

are already demanding for efficient structures able to reduce cost production and increase unit 

margins. 

Investing strongly in technology is critical not just to be able to reach unconventional sources of 

energy but also to deal with these price forces.  

Appendix 5: Legal, Regulatory and Financial Environment 

The end of the U.S. crude export ban: Established in December 2015 as a consequence of the 

existing price parity between West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent Crude, which eliminate 

opportunities for price arbitrage. On a more local perspective, this regulatory change is expected 



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 69  

to increase light sweet oil demand from Europe and Asia and for the overall oil market. Having 

U.S. as an exporter means that WTI will be a truly International benchmark adding more efficiency 

to the global trading market. 

More restricted financing policies: Senior secured debt, bonds and junior subordinated debt were 

the sources used to fund the push of domestic production in U.S. However, due the collapse of 

prices in more than 65%, some oil and gas companies are experiencing unsustainable levels of 

debt. Along with this financial pressure, the lenders of these companies are experiencing double 

pressure from the Office of the Controller of the Currency and FDIC to develop more demanding 

stress tests. Consequently, a significant reduction of financing options will be available (Heroux, 

2016).  

Environmental taxes: Regulatory policies have also increased pressure on the oil and gas industry 

worldwide, but the U.S. has been particularly held down with higher environmental taxes in 2016 

and additional bans and restrictions implemented by local voters. For example, banning the use of 

hydraulic fracturing, initiatives include increasing mandatory operations setbacks and empowering 

local governments to regulate oil and gas operations. 

Compliance Rules: Compliance rules have being implemented with the final goal of obligating 

oil and gas companies to detail more and more their emissions during their operations. The 

challenge for these companies will be to show that their production is respecting the low-carbon 

environment. 

Appendix 6: ExxonMobil’s Upstream Segment  

Looking at recent data published in the Financial &amp;amp; Operational Review of ExxonMobil 

(ExxonMobil, 2016), in terms of upstream is important to highlight six major projects completed 

in 2015, specifically the two capital-efficient deepwater projects in offshore West Africa which 

started ahead of schedule and below budget. 



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 70  

From the 91 billion oil-equivalent barrels, 73% are proved reserves with installed production 

facilities. The components of ExxonMobil’s resources base is made up of around 60% liquids and 

in terms of development type, 73% comprised conventional oil and gas, unconventional oil and 

gas, and heavy oil/oil sands resources. 

 

 

Appendix 7: ExxonMobil’s Downstream Segment  

From crude oil conversion into fuels for transportation, lubricants and chemical plant feedstocks 

for plastics and many other consumer and industrial products, ExxonMobil reaches a worldwide 

market through 8.000 miles of active pipelines globally, 24 lubricant plants and about 225 fuel 

terminals around the world. 

In North America, ExxonMobil has nine refineries distributed through the United States and 

Canada and has the capacity to process about 2,3 million barrels of crude oil per day which is 

equivalent to 45% of its global refining capacity. Europe represents 30% and Asia represents 20% 

of ExxonMobil’s global refining capacity.  

Bases basestock, the major component of lubricating oils, and finished lubricants represent part of 

the committed investment that has been made and in 2015 was completed one lubricant plant 

expansions in Texas, China and Finland to serve strong lubricant demand growth in many focus 

markets.  

Appendix 8: Anadarko’s upstream activity in the United States 

The Rocky Mountains Region Anadarko is expected to be a focus area for Anadarko in 2016. 

During 2015, Anadarko was focused on production and adding reserves through horizontal drilling 

and infill drilling, resulting in an increase in liquids sales volumes of 11% in relation to 2014. The 

Southern and Appalachia Region is where Anadarko has been focused on finding and developing

natural gas and liquids from shales, tight sands and fractured-reservoir plays. In 2016, it expects to 

proceed with its horizontal drilling program with a special focus on the Delaware basin. In the Gulf 

of Mexico has 60% of working interest in 279 blocks, operates in eight active floating platforms 

and holds interest in 34 fields. In Alaska its main activity is concentrated on the North Slope and 

in the last quarter of 2015 it has four out of seven producing wells coming online from the Alpine 

West infrastructure. 

Appendix 9: Anadarko’s upstream activity internationally  

Anadarko possessed 40 gathering systems and 54 processing and treating plants. 

In Algeria the product is sold by tankers Saharan Blend and in Ghana through Jubilee Oil, both 

high-quality crude that supplies refiners with significant quantities of premium gasoline, diesel and 

jet fuel, within others. Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, Mozambique, New Zealand and Kenya are the 

other countries where Anadarko has operations. In 2016 Anadarko will have a particular focus in 

its explorations in Colombia and Côte d’Ivoire. 

The international proved reserves are composed of a mix of 35% oil and condensate, 48% of natural 

gas and 17% of NGLs. 

Appendix 10: Anadarko’s midstream activities 

These plants are based mainly on its onshore producing facilities located in Wyoming, Colorado, 

Utah, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Texas. In 2015, liquids-rich resources 

were the main focus of Anadarko in terms of growth, including Wattenberg, the Delaware basin, 

the Eagleford shale and the Marcellus shale dry-gas play. In 2016, the company is planning to focus 

on the Delaware basin.   

Appendix 11: Western Gas Partners, LP (WES)  

In the limited partnership, Western Gas Equity Partners, LP (WGP), a publicly traded consolidated 

subsidiary, owns interest in WES and at the end of 2015 Anadarko’s ownership interest in WGP 

was 87,3% as limited partner interest and the entire non-economic general partner interest. WGP’s 

ownership interest in WES was 34,6% limited partner interest, the entire 1,8% general partner 

interest and all of the WES incentive distribution rights. Through other subsidiaries, Anadarko also 

has 8,5% limited partner interest in WES. 



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 72  

Appendix 12: Anadarko’s marketing activities 

Minimizing market-related shut-ins, maximizing prices and managing credit-risk exposure are the 

main goals of the marketing segment. Anadarko’s worldwide oil, condensate, natural-gas and 

NGLs product sales are normally marketed at the currently market prices at the time of the sale. 

As the midstream segment, Anadarko also sells products from third parties, especially the ones 

which come from neighbour producers. Throughout this strategy, Anadarko can aggregate volumes 

that together guarantee the maximization of its transportation, storage and fractionation capacity. 

Therefore, Anadarko is able to reach more competitive prices and a more efficient performance.   

The products are marketed at fixed-price and cost escalation-based agreements within a variety of 

contract structures. However, to hedge its risk exposure to changes in market prices, Anadarko 

engages in limited trading activities, since it normally has a net short position as an oil’s seller, 

natural gas and NGLs agreements which is offset by the Company’s natural long position as a 

producer.  

Appendix 13: Anadarko’s Net Loss 

From this net loss, $5,1 billion are related to impairments primarily due some U.S. onshore and 

Gulf of Mexico properties, but also impairments of exploration assets, as some unproved 

properties, write-off of suspended exploratory well costs in Brazil and losses on divestitures.  

Appendix 14: ExxonMobil’s Downstream Revenues  

The rational under the forecast demand for refined products is based on the long-term outlook of 

intense competition in terms of supply, where new capacity is expected to outpace the growth of 

global demand.   

Furthermore, the proposed carbon policy, specific climate-related regulations worldwide and the 

growth of biofuels supply are potential factors to impact the downstream segment negatively. In 

terms of unit revenue, even with a scenario of lower crude prices, the future profitability will be 

small due the worldwide supply and demand imbalance. 

Appendix 15: ExxonMobil’s Upstream EBITDA 

The decrease in EBITDA margins in the upstream segment was in part a consequence of lower oil 

prices but also a reflection of its shift to unconventional energy sources. Unconventional energy 



Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 73  

source explorations are typically more costly, both for exploration and refinery treatment. 

Furthermore, the production mix of liquids and natural gas also affect the expenses regarding the 

upstream segment since normally liquids are more profitable to produce than natural gas.  

Appendix 16: ExxonMobil’s downstream EBITDA  

Downstream EBITDA margins did not have the same trajectory over the last few years, ranging 

between 1,5% and 4%. The main reasons to explain the lowest EBITDA margins in 2013 and 2014 

are the industry overcapacity and lower WTI and Brent crude oil spreads. 

Spreads in benchmarked oil prices are not likely to significantly affect downstream EBITDA 

margins hereafter, especially since the U.S. crude oil export ban was lifted which is expected to 

narrow the spread between North Sea Brent and U.S. WTI. However, refining margins should still 

feel the pressure of new capacity additions which will probably be enough to beat growth in global 

demand. Furthermore, the potential increase of heavy crude oil supply from the upstream segment 

also could impact refinery margins since it requires more advanced techniques and has negative 

environmental impacts.

Notes: Concerning leverage, ExxonMobil had a historical debt to equity ratio (BV) of 11,3% 

(2007-2015). However, it has increased over the last years. In 2015, ExxonMobil had a debt to 

equity ratio of 22% after issued $8 billion of long-term debt in the first quarter of 2015. Going 

forward, the long-term debt obligations until 2020 are $9.902M and $10.023M in 2021 and beyond. 

Due this schedule, the $9.902M amount was equally split between 2017 and 2020 and after 2021 

ExxonMobil is assumed to have the same long-term debt amount of $10.023M. Following this 

reasoning, the debt to equity ratio will decrease over the forecast period and with an average of 9% 

which is in line with the historical data.  

The interest expenses were calculated separately for short and long-term debt: the interest-rate for 

short-term debt were based on the weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings of the

Appendix 22: ExxonMobil’s Valuation with WACC 

Appendix 23: ExxonMobil’s Peer Group 

The two main drivers, the level of risk and business model, are correlated since being a company 

with an integrated business model influences its level of risk and the inherent vulnerability to 

changes in commodity prices. From this selection, only non-state-owned companies were 

considered. Furthermore, since Exxon Mobil is part of Big Oil, the peer group was easily defined 

based on the supermajors which are also part of this group. Still, there are differences among the 

supermajors that should be taken into account over the relative valuation. 

Appendix 24: Price to Free Cash-Flow 

Due the particularities of the oil industry and significant amounts of debt applied to future 

production, having future cash flows is crucial to maintain financial flexibility. Even with a 

consistent net income, focusing on cash flow metrics is important for this industry. Non-cash items 

such as depreciation, depletion, amortization and significant deferred taxes are some of the reasons 

why price-to-FCF is a ratio which should be consider among ExxonMobil peers.

Appendix 25: Market Consensus of ExxonMobil Valuation  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix 26: Anadarko’s Upstream revenues 

Hydrocarbon production in onshore assets and working interest in the Gulf of Mexico are some of 

the important production basis which are expected to ramp up the company production volumes. 

This paired with higher commodity prices help predict that the oil sales volumes will outpace the 

worldwide supply growth in 2% in 2020.  

The same reasoning is applied to the natural gas liquid since the increase in NGL production is 

expected to result in oversupply with low prices in the short-medium term. 

Appendix 27: Anadarko’s exploration expenses  

It has been increasingly difficult to explore hydrocarbon reserves, especially in deepwater areas, 

as the Gulf of Mexico. In these areas, the time between discovery and production tends to be higher 

and the decommissioning activities are more costly than in shallower waters.

Appendix 28: Anadarko’s Forecasted FS and Notes 

 

NOTES: 

The absolute value for LT Debt of Anadarko has been stable ranging between 13k and 15k. The 

lower equity value explains the significant variation of the LTD to Equity ratio from 55% in 2013 

to 102% in 2015.

Joana Marcelino                          M&amp;amp;A: The Case of ExxonMobil and Anadarko             Page | 80  

The forecast for Anadarko’s leverage was based on the schedule for debt obligations detailed in 

the company’s Annual Report of 2015. Following that, Anadarko is expected to pay back $5.749M 

until 2020 which means to have a LTD of $10.725M in 2020. This amount was assumed to be 

stable over the forecast period. 

The short-term debt was determined according to the obligations which will be faced in each 

specific year added to other short-term needs. Following this reasoning, the debt to equity ratio is 

expected to recovery from 111% in 2016 to 38% in 2025, with an average of 72% over the explicit 

forecast period. The higher level of short-term debt is needed to face more challenging periods over 

the next years of lower commodity prices.  

The interest rates used to calculate the amount corresponding to debt related interest expenses were 

the existing rate associated with commercial paper for short-term debt and the weighted average 

interest rate calculated from the current obligations for the long-term debt. Thus, the short-term 

interest rate is 0,98% and the long-term interest rate is 5,26%.   

In the working capital calculations, the current asset retirement obligations, interest payable, other 

taxes payable and accrued expenses are the current liability rubrics which were considered to be 

stable over the forecast period, since they are not correlated with sales and there is no further 

information to predict future variations.

Appendix 36: The impact of not have control over market prices in Revenue Synergies  

In this industry, the revenues are dependent on market prices for oil, gas and NLG which are 

determined based on supply and demand. Consequently, if in some industries a merger can be a 

source of lower customer bargaining power, this is not an option in this case. For a company as 

Anadarko or even ExxonMobil which is part of the big oil, they together still very small in the 

global scheme to impact on the price determination. In fact, the Middle East companies, which 

have a bit more power, wouldn’t be able to have control over the commodity price.  

The only way which could be a source of synergies from the revenue side would be a potential 

adjustment on the hedging strategy of both companies. But in fact, there is not enough information 

to measure potential synergies that could arise from canceling any derivatives instruments used by 

both companies or by change hedging positions.  

Appendix 37: Increase production in oil and gas industry 

Normally projects have a development cycle between 5 and 10 years thus no near-term synergies 

would be expected on the revenue side. Furthermore, Exxon Mobil is a global company which has 

activity almost everywhere in the world while Anadarko is a company with production mainly from 

North America, thus even if revenues synergies would be considered, they would have a slight 

impact. 

Appendix 38: Common exploration and production areas of Anadarko and ExxonMobil 

In the Gulf of Mexico Anadarko has active floating platforms in 34 fields and 60% interest in 279 

blocks, which includes Lucius and Heidelberg. In 2015, ExxonMobil had an average net production 

in the Gulf of Mexico of 64 thousand barrels of liquids and 257 million cubic feet of gas per day, 

from a portfolio of 1.1M net acres. In this area, ExxonMobil has deep water exploration in Keathley 

Canyon (KC) (including a participation of 23% in Anadarko-operated Lucius development) and in

Walker Ridge (WR) (including 95% in the Anadarko-operated Heidelberg project). ExxonMobil 

also has conventional and LNG production activities in these areas. 

Anadarko’s Southern and Appalachia Region properties are mainly located in Texas, Pennsylvania, 

Louisiana, and Kansas and the main exploration areas are Eagleford shale in South Texas, the 

Delaware Basin in West Texas, the Marcellus shale in north-central Pennsylvania, and the 

Haynesville shale in East Texas and Northern Louisiana. In these regions, Anadarko explores and 

produces both natural gas and liquids. ExxonMobil also has a substantial position in this area: 

527.000 net acres in the Marcellus Shale and explorations in Eagleford shale (common area with 

Anadarko). 

Finally, in the Rocky Mountains region, Anadarko has assets located in Colorado, Utah, and 

Wyoming (Land Grant) which totals 11.000 wells and interests in near 4.000 non-operated wells. 

This area is considered by Anadarko one of the most valuable areas since it creates completive 

advantage through higher returns from production, drilling without expiration and royalties from 

third-party activity. ExxonMobil also has exploration activities in the Mid-continent states, 

including the Land Grant. In the company operating report there is no further information, but since 

they are operating in the same regions potential synergies should arise. 

Appendix 39: Deal of Exxon and Mobil 

“The major motivations behind the Exxon-Mobil merger, completed in November 1999, were both 

cost- and market-based. By combining complementary assets, Exxon-Mobil sought a stronger 

presence in the regions of the world with a high potential for future oil and gas discoveries. 

Complementary exploration and production operations existed in West Africa, Russia and Eastern 

Canada. Because of the increased size of the company it would also be in a stronger position to 

invest in programmes involving large outlays and high prospective risks and returns. At the time 

of the merger operating synergies of $2.8 billion were predicted. Two-thirds of the benefits would 

come from eliminating duplicate facilities and excess capacity. Additional synergy benefits would 

come from combined general and administrative costs, and by applying each company’s best 

business practices through the world. By 2000 Exxon-Mobil reported that synergies reached $4.6 

billion.” (Christopher, Harris, &amp;amp; Chavan, 2012)

Appendix 42: Anadarko’s Takeover Defences 

Anadarko has the following takeover defences: fair price provisions, cumulative voting, advance 

notice procedures for director nominations and stockholder proposals, the prohibition of 

stockholder action by written consent, special meetings of stockholders and preferred stock 

issuances. 

Appendix 43: Delaware Anti-Takeover Law 
 
“Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of 
control of Anadarko, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders. 
Our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may make a change 
of control of Anadarko difficult, even if it may be beneficial to our stockholders, including 
provisions governing the nomination and removal of directors, the prohibition of stockholder 
action by written consent and regulation of stockholders’ ability to bring matters for action before 
annual stockholder meetings, and the authorization given to our Board of Directors to issue and 
set the terms of preferred stock. 
In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on 
mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our 
outstanding common stock.” (Anadarko Petroleum Corp, 2016)
