1. Resumo 

As poças de maré, em zonas rochosas, são um importante refúgio e áreas de viveiro 

para as larvas e juvenis de peixes de várias espécies com interesse comercial. Os 

objectivos deste trabalho foram: 1) determinar a diversidade de espécies de larvas e 

juvenis de peixes marinhos que usam as poças de maré, em zonas rochosas, 

localizadas a oeste da costa portuguesa, 2) a sazonalidade do uso destes habitats por 

estas espécies, 3) a condição desses indivíduos através da determinação do índice K de 

Fulton, 4) a estrutura de tamanhos ao longo do ano, 5) a composição da dieta das 

larvas e juvenis dos peixes marinhos transientes mais abundantes, Diplodus sargus e 

Atherina spp., e o seu papel trófico nestes habitats. Para este estudo, foram 

seleccionadas quatro poças de maré em zona rochosa. Estas poças localizam-se em 

duas praias rochosas expostas (praia A e praia B) na costa ocidental Portuguesa. Cada 

poça foi caracterizada em termos de profundidade e área. As amostragens foram 

realizadas mensalmente, durante dois anos, de Janeiro de 2011 a Dezembro de 2012, 

na primeira baixa-mar do mês, com uma altura de cerca de 0,7 m, sempre em período 

de marés-vivas. A temperatura da água de cada poça de maré foi registada, bem como 

se procedeu à caracterização do substrato e formas de vida dominantes. As larvas e 

juvenis dos peixes marinhos transientes foram capturados utilizando camaroeiros de 

malha fina. Os peixes capturados foram colocados em sacos de plástico devidamente 

identificados e transportados numa pequena arca congeladora para o laboratório onde 

foram armazenados à temperatura de -20 °C. Os procedimentos laboratoriais incluíram 

a medição das larvas e dos juvenis dos peixes capturados com precisão de 1 mm, a sua 

pesagem com precisão de 0,01 g, excisão dos estômagos das larvas e juvenis, 



2 
 

preservação em álcool a 70% e identificação dos conteúdos estomacais. O estágio de 

desenvolvimento das larvas pós-flexão das espécies de peixes transientes foi 

classificado como larva a, b, c, d e e para D. sargus e larva a, b e c, para Atherina spp.. 

Os procedimentos analíticos incluíram o cálculo de índices alimentares (índice 

numérico, índice volumétrico e índice de ocorrência) e do índice de condição K de 

Fulton. 

Neste estudo foram identificadas 6 espécies de peixes transientes que utilizam as 

poças de maré das zonas rochosas: o sargo legítimo, Diplodus sargus, o peixe-rei, 

Atherina spp., a taínha, Liza ramada, o bodião de Bailloni, Symphodus bailloni, o sargo-

veado, Diplodus cervinus e a sardinha Europeia, Sardina pilchardus. Uma elevada 

variabilidade inter-anual, tanto nas densidades, como na altura de colonização das 

poças, foi observada. Enquanto que em 2011 as poças foram colonizadas em Março, 

em 2012 apenas foram colonizadas em Maio. O número de meses de colonização 

também foi inferior em 2012. A colonização das poças, tanto por D. sargus, como por 

Atherina spp. começou na Primavera e terminou no Outono. As densidades mais 

elevadas foram registadas para D. sargus em todas as poças, seguidas das de Atherina 

spp. com a excepção da poça 2 da praia B onde Atherina spp. estiveram ausentes. O 

número de espécies que colonizou as poças de maré variou entre dois (D. sargus e 

Atherina spp.) na poça 1 da praia A e cinco, tanto na poça 2 da praia A (D. sargus, 

Atherina spp., L. ramada, S. bailloni, D. cervinus), como na poça 1 da praia B (D. sargus, 

Atherina spp., L. ramada, D. cervinus and S. pilchardus). Os picos de densidade de D. 

sargus foram mais pronunciados na primavera enquanto que os de Atherina spp. 

foram mais pronunciados no Verão. Os picos de densidade foram ainda mais elevados 

em 2011 do que em 2012, quer para D. sargus, quer para Atherina spp. em todas as 



3 
 

poças e meses. As espécies transientes raras (L. ramada, S. bailloni, D. cervinus e S. 

pilchardus) estiveram presentes principalmente na Primavera-Verão, com uma grande 

variabilidade entre poças, e num maior número de meses em 2012 do que em 2011. 

As larvas pós-flexão de D. sargus colonizaram as poças em Março e Abril de 2011 e em 

Maio de 2012, no primeiro estágio (larva a), os juvenis apareceram em Junho, em 

ambos os anos. Atherina spp., nas poças 1 e 2 da praia A, apareceram pela primeira 

vez no segundo estágio de desenvolvimento (larva b), enquanto que na poça 1 da praia 

B todos os estágios de desenvolvimento estiveram presentes, os juvenis começaram a 

aparecer em Junho de 2011 e Agosto de 2012. A condição de D. sargus aumentou ao 

longo do ano, em ambos os anos, com excepção da poça 2 da praia B. Para Atherina 

spp. a condição manteve-se na poça 2 da praia A e decresceu na poça 1 da praia B. O 

tamanho médio de D. sargus e Atherina spp. mostrou frequentemente um aumento 

contínuo da Primavera para o Outono, em ambos os anos.  

Relativamente à dieta de D. sargus, esta apresenta uma grande variabilidade de grupos 

de presas: algas, cnidários, platielmintes, entoproctas, anelídeos, crustáceos, insectos, 

acarídeos, moluscos e teleósteos. Por outro lado, Atherina spp. consumiram uma 

menor diversidade de presas que D. sargus, as suas  presas incluem apenas crustáceos, 

insectos, acarídeos e moluscos. Sendo, tanto D. sargus como Atherina spp., 

consideradas espécies generalistas. 

A dieta das larvas a e b de D. sargus é principalmente constituída por copépodes 

harpacticoides, larvas de insecto da família Chironomidae e ostracodes; nas larvas c e 

nos juvenis os ostracodes foram substituídos, em termos de importância na dieta, por 

anfípodes e nas larvas d e e por insectos adultos da família Chironomidae. 



4 
 

A dieta das larvas a, b e c e dos juvenis de Atherina spp. é principalmente constituída 

por copépodes harpacticoides, ostracodes e gastrópodes. Foram detectadas diferenças 

estatisticamente significativas entre as larvas e adultos de D. sargus. À medida que as 

larvas de D. sargus se desenvolvem, a proporção de copépodes harpacticoides na sua 

dieta diminui, sendo mínima nos juvenis. Além disso, os juvenis de D. sargus 

alimentam-se de algas, sendo D. sargus considerado uma espécie omnívora. Por outro 

lado, Atherina spp. não se alimentam de algas em nenhuma fase do seu 

desenvolvimento. Anfípodes e isópodes só começam a aparecer na dieta de D. sargus 

e Atherina spp. no segundo e terceiro estágio do desenvolvimento larvar, 

respectivamente. Este resultado pode estar relacionado com a dimensão destas presas 

relativamente ao tamanho das larvas destas espécies nos primeiros estágios de 

desenvolvimento. Ao longo do desenvolvimento ontogénico, tanto D. sargus como 

Atherina spp., consomem presas de maiores dimensões, o que pode estar relacionado 

com um aumento das necessidades energéticas. Os juvenis de D. sargus apresentam 

uma maior diversidade de itens alimentares que os estágios de desenvolvimento 

anteriores, incluindo, para além das algas, o isópode Cyathura sp., o quíton 

Lepidochitona cinerea (Linnaeus, 1767) e poliquetas. D. sargus e Atherina spp. são 

espécies oportunistas, como algumas espécies de peixes residentes nas poças de maré, 

tirando proveito da elevada disponibilidade de presas do ambiente em que vivem.  

Neste trabalho foi possível concluir que as espécies de peixes transientes D. sargus e 

Atherina spp. provavelmente utilizam as poças de maré de costas rochosas como zona 

de viveiro, dado as elevadas densidades das larvas e juvenis destes indivíduos nos 

meses mais favoráveis em termos de temperatura e de disponibilidade de alimento. 

Estudos futuros permitirão avaliar a importância da contribuição dos peixes que 



5 
 

ocorrem nestes habitats durante a fase de pós-larva e juvenil para os mananciais de 

adultos das respectivas espécies. 

 

2. Summary 

 

Transient marine fishes were sampled monthly in four tidal pools of a rocky reef, for 

two years, in the west Portuguese coast. Species diversity was higher than that found 

in previous studies in other parts of the world. The transient fish population was 

comprised of six species: Diplodus sargus, Atherina spp., Liza ramada, Symphodus 

bailloni, Diplodus cervinus and Sardina pilchardus. Fish abundance varied seasonally, 

between years and among pools, with peak numbers in spring and summer. D. sargus 

and Atherina spp. were present in most pools, from spring to autumn, with their size 

often increasing along this period, in both years. Rare species were present mostly in 

spring-summer. In most pools, the overall condition of D. sargus increased throughout 

the year, in both years; whereas in Atherina spp. it was maintained or decreased. The 

diet composition of larvae and juveniles of D. sargus and Atherina spp., was 

investigated. D. sargus consumed Algae, Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Entoprocta, 

Annelida, Crustacea, Insecta, Acari, Mollusca and Teleostei. Atherina spp. only 

consumed Crustacea, Insecta, Acari and Mollusca. The diet of D. sargus was composed 

mainly of harpacticoid copepods, chironomid larvae, ostracods, chironomid adults and 

amphipods; whereas the diet of Atherina spp. was composed mainly of Harpacticoid 

copepods, ostracods and gastropods. Along the ontogenetic development, the 

proportions and diversity of food items in the diet of D. sargus varied. The importance 

of harpacticoid copepods decreased with increasing size, while the importance of 



6 
 

amphipods and isopods increased. The trophic role of larvae and juveniles of D. sargus 

and Atherina spp. occurring in tidal pools of rocky reefs is that of opportunistic 

consumers. The species richness, the high densities of larvae and juveniles, their 

continuous growth and the food items consumed, strongly emphasize the importance 

of these environments for larvae and juveniles of D. sargus and Atherina spp.. 

 

3. General introduction 

 

Rocky intertidal communities are very valuable as a model system for the study of the 

mechanisms that generate community patterns and structure, since intertidal 

organisms are easily manipulated and the access to this habitat is easily granted 

(Dayton, 1971; Paine, 1974; Menge, 1976, 1995; Lubchenco, 1978). 

Plants and animals inhabiting the shores are closely related to fully marine species. For 

them, the environmental gradient formed between low water and the limit of the 

influence of the sea in the splash zone represents stress conditions (Raffaelli and 

Hawkins, 1996). Organisms experiment air temperatures and relative humidity more 

variable than those in the sea; also precipitation and evaporation can affect the salinity 

of rock pools and water on the rock surface (Raffaelli and Hawkins, 1996). Since 

aquatic organisms require some degree of moisture, the most important stress in 

temperate and tropical areas is desiccation due to the combination of heat and low 

relative humidity. In polar and boreal regions, extreme cold is a major problem at high 

shore levels (Raffaelli and Hawkins, 1996). At increasingly higher shore levels, marine 

organisms spend increasingly longer periods of time emmersed, being exposed to 

harsh terrestrial conditions of extreme temperatures and water loss (Bertness and 



7 
 

Leonard, 1997). The shore represents a unidirectional vertical stress gradient for most 

marine animals, referred commonly as the intertidal gradient. Along this gradient, 

species are ordered according to their responses to physical processes (e.g. heat, 

desiccation) and variation in their responses to biological processes (e.g. competition 

and predation) (Lewis, 1964; Connell, 1972; Carefoot, 1977; Paine and Levin, 1981; 

Menge and Sutherland 1987; Denny, 1988; Little and Kitching, 1996). This ordering is 

reflected in the zonation patterns observed on rocky shores. On these habitats, the 

biological features like habitat structure and complexity, biological productivity, 

species diversity and the intensity of biological interactions increase towards the lower 

shore, being environments rich in a variety of species. (Underwood, 1996, 2000; 

Zander et al., 1999). A universal classification scheme for classifying the zones of all 

rocky shores was suggested by Stephenson and Stephenson (1972) and it has been 

used nearly everywhere (Southward, 1958; Lipkin and Safriel, 1971). In this scheme, 

shore is divided into three major zones: 

? a high-shore area, the supralittoral fringe, characterized by encrusting lichens, 

Cyanobacteria (bluegreen bacteria) and small snails, the periwinkles; 

? a broad midshore zone, midlittoral zone, dominated by suspension-feeding 

barnacles, mussels or sometimes oysters; 

? a narrower low-shore zone, the infralittoral fringe, dominated by red algae 

including pink, calcareous, encrusting forms, often with large kelps (brown 

seaweeds),  or in some places in the Southern Hemisphere, large filter-feeding 

tunicates (sea squirts). 



8 
 

In the Portuguese coast, the supralittoral fringe is dominated by lichen Verrucaria 

maura Wahlenberg, 1803 and the gastropod Melaraphe neritoids (Linnaeus, 1758), 

with the exceptions of some shores like Avencas and Meco where V. maura may be 

absent (Boaventura et al., 2002). The grey upper zone is composed of cyanobacteria 

and M. neritoides, however, it can be dominated by green algae like Enteromorpha sp. 

if near to a freshwater runoff (Boaventura et al., 2002). The midlittoral zone is 

dominated by sessile filter feeders such as barnacles and mussels. The barnacle 

Chthamalus montagui Southward, 1976 dominates on the upper mid-shore zone 

where lichen Lichina pygmaea (O.F.Müller) C. Agardh, 1820 is also present (Boaventura 

et al., 2002). Mussels occur in the lower mid-shore zone of more exposed shores. 

Xantho incisus Leach, 1814, Carcinus maenas (Linnaeus, 1758), Necora puber 

(Linnaeus, 1767), Pirimela denticulata (Montagu, 1808) and Pilumnus hirtellus 

(Linnaeus, 1761) can be observed in the lower zone of the central Portuguese coast; 

Pachygrapsus marmoratus (Fabricius, 1787) and Eriphia verrucosa (Forskål, 1775) 

exploit all the intertidal range (Flores and Paula, 2001). Algae like Corallina spp., 

Caulacanthus ustulatus (Mertens ex Turner) Kützing, 1843, Mastocarpus stellatus 

(Stackhouse) Guiry, 1984 and Lithophyllum lichenoides Philippi, 1837 can occur 

together with mussels.  Throughout the midlittoral zone, gastropod species like 

Littorina saxatilis (Olivi, 1792), Phorcus lineatus (da Costa, 1778), Gibbula umbilicalis 

(da Costa, 1778) and Nucella lapillus (Linnaeus, 1758) are common. Amongst grazing 

limpets, Patella vulgata Linnaeus, 1758, Patella rustica Linnaeus, 1758, Patella 

depressa Pennant, 1777 and Patella ulyssiponensis Gmelin, 1791 inhabit the midlittoral 

zone along the Portuguese coast (Boaventura et al., 2002). 



9 
 

The infralittoral fringe is occupied by an agglomeration of macroalgae. Northern shores 

present large Brown algae such as Laminaria spp., Saccorhiza polyschides (Lightfoot) 

Batters, 1902 and Himanthalia elongata (Linnaeus) S. F. Gray, 1821. In the infralittoral 

fringe of the Centre and South shores dominate Corallina spp., Plocamium 

cartilagineum (Linnaeus) P. S. Dixon, 1967, C. ustulatus, Gelidium spp. and Laurencia 

pinnatifida (Gmelin) Lamouroux. On more exposed shores, Corallina spp. dominate 

over the other algal species. The abundant animal species in the infralittoral fringe are 

P. ulyssiponensis, Paracentrotus lividus (Lamarck, 1816), Sabellaria alveolata (Linnaeus, 

1767) and Pollicipes pollicipes (Gmelin, 1790) (Boaventura et al., 2002). 

The fishes inhabiting the pools formed by tide cycles on the rocky shore can be 

classified as either residents or transients, depending on the time spent in this 

environment (Gibson, 1969, 1982; Thomson and Lehner, 1976; Grossman, 1982; 

Mahon and Mahon, 1994; Griffiths, 2003a). Fishes that spend all their life cycle in 

tidepools are defined as resident and are generally small benthic fishes, such as the 

blennies and gobies; while the transient ones are defined as those that only spend part 

of their life in this environment, they are primarily infralittoral, but occur in tidepools, 

particularly as juveniles. (Gibson, 1982; Castellanos-Galindo et al., 2005). Generally, 

the pattern observed is that higher pools are dominated by resident species and lower 

pools are occupied by a greater proportion of transient species (Castellanos-Galindo et 

al., 2005). Rocky tidal pool fish communities have been widely investigated in many 

parts of the world. In Brasil, the principal resident species are Bathygobius soporator 

(Valenciennes, 1837) (Gobiidae), Parablennius pilicornis (Cuvier, 1829) (Blenniidae), 

Gobiesox barbatulus Starks, 1913 (Gobiesocidae) and Labrisomus nuchipinnis (Quoy 

and Gaimard, 1824) (Labrisomidae), while the transient species are Abudefduf saxatilis 



10 
 

(Linnaeus, 1758) (Pomacentridae), Epinephelus marginatus (Lowe, 1834) (Serranidae) 

and Diplodus argenteus (Valenciennes, 1830) (Sparidae) (Barreiros et al., 2004). 

In South Africa, Cryptic Tripterygiidae, Clinidae, Blenniidae, Gobiidae, Acanthuridae 

and Gobiesocidae represent the resident families, while Pomacentridae, Serranidae, 

Sparidae, Labridae, Cheilodactylidae and Mugilidae represent the transient families 

(Beckley, 1985, 2000). 

In Colombia, the resident fish include Gobiidae (Bathygobius ramosus Ginsburg, 1947), 

Labrisomidae (Malacoctenus zonifer (Jordan and Gilbert, 1882)) and Gobiesocidae 

(Gobiesox adustus Jordan and Gilbert, 1882) and the transient fish include 

Pomacentridae (Abudefduf concolor (Gill, 1862), Abudefduf troschelii (Gill, 1862), 

Microspathodon bairdii (Gill, 1862)), Mugilidae (Chaenomugil proboscideus (Günther, 

1861)), Labridae (Halichoeres aestuaricola Bussing, 1972) and Muraenidae (Echidna 

nocturna (Cope, 1872)) (Castellanos-Galindo et al., 2005). 

The fish community in Australia is mainly composed of resident fish from the families 

Clinidae, Blenniidae, Tripterygiidae, Gobiidae, Gobiesocidae and Girellidae, the 

transient families are Kuhliidae, Apogonidae, Scatophagidae, Chaetodontidae and 

Pleuronectidae (Griffiths, 2003a, b). 

In India, Blenniidae and Gobiidae represent the resident fishes, more abundant in the 

pools, and Mugilidae (Mugil cephalus Linnaeus, 1758) and Terapontidae (Terapon 

jarbua (Forsskål, 1775)) represent the transient fishes (Tsering et al., 2012). 

In Japan, Gobiidae, Blenniidae, Pomacentridae, Labridae and Tripterygiidae are the 

dominant families, Gobiidae and Blenniidae include both resident and transient fish, 

while Pomacentridae (Abudefduf sordidus (Forsskål, 1775), Abudefduf notatus (Day, 

1870), Plectroglyphidodon leucozonus (Bleeker, 1859)), Labridae (Thalassoma cupido 



11 
 

(Temminck and Schlegel, 1845), Thalassoma purpureum (Forsskål, 1775)), and 

Tripterygiidae (Enneapterygius philippinus (Peters, 1868),  Enneapterygius etheostoma 

(Jordan and Snyder, 1902)) only include transient fish. Other families that include 

transient fishes are the Gobiesocidae (Pherallodus indicus (Weber, 1913)), Kyphosidae 

(Girella leonina (Richardson, 1846), Girella mezina Jordan and Starks, 1907), Kuhliidae 

(Kuhlia mugil (Forster, 1801)) and Syngnathidae (Choeroichthys sculptus (Günther, 

1870)) but are less represented families (Murase, 2013). 

In California, Stichaeidae (Anoplarchus purpurescens Gill, 1861, Xiphister atropurpureus 

(Kittlitz, 1858)) and Gobiesocidae (Gobiesox maeandricus (Girard, 1858)) represent the 

resident fish families. Cottidae comprises both resident and transient fish (Oligocottus 

maculosus Girard, 1856 and Oligocottus snyderi Greeley, 1898 as resident species and 

Hemilepidotus spinosus Ayres, 1854 as a transient species). Other families that include 

transient fish are Paralichthyidae (Citharichthys stigmaeus Jordan and Gilbert, 1882), 

Hexagrammidae (Hexagrammos decagrammus (Pallas, 1810), Hexagrammos 

lagocephalus (Pallas, 1810)), Scorpaenidae (Sebastes melanops Girard, 1856, Sebastes 

mystinus (Jordan and Gilbert, 1881)) and Liparidae (Liparis florae (Jordan and Starks, 

1895)) (Grossman, 1982; Moring, 1986). 

In New Zealand, Tripterygiidae (Bellapiscis medius (Günther, 1861), Forsterygion 

lapillum Hardy, 1989) and Gobiesocidae (Trachelochismus pinnulatus (Forster, 1801), 

Gastroscyphus hectoris (Günther, 1876)) represent the resident fishes and Labridae 

(Notolabrus celidotus (Bloch and Schneider, 1801)) represent the transient ones (Willis 

and Roberts, 1996). 



12 
 

In Azores, Blenniidae (Parablennius ruber (Valenciennes, 1836), Parablennius 

incognitus (Bath, 1968), Parablennius sanguinolentus parvicornis (Valenciennes, 1836), 

Ophioblennius atlanticus (Valenciennes, 1836), Coryphoblennius galerita (Linnaeus, 

1758), Lipophrys trigloides (Valenciennes, 1836)) constitute the dominant resident fish 

family in the intertidal pools, the other families of resident fish include Gobiidae 

(Gobius paganellus Linnaeus, 1758), Labridae (Centrolabrus trutta (Lowe, 1834)) and 

Gadidae (Gaidropsarus guttatus (Collett, 1890)); the transient fish include Carangidae 

(Trachinotus ovatus (Linnaeus, 1758)), Mugilidae (Chelon labrosus (Risso, 1827)), 

Serranidae (Epinephelus marginatus (Lowe, 1834)) and Sparidae (Diplodus sargus 

(Linnaeus, 1758)) (Santos et al., 1994). 

In western Portugal, Blenniidae (C. galerita, Lipophrys pholis (Linnaeus, 1758)), 

Gobiidae (Gobius cobitis Pallas, 1814, G. paganellus) and Gobiesocidae (Lepadogaster 

lepadogaster purpurea (Bonnaterre, 1788)) constitute the resident fish families in the 

intertidal pools. Sparidae (D. sargus) and Atherinidae (Atherina presbyter Cuvier, 1829) 

constitute the transient fish families (Faria and Almada, 1999; Almada and Faria, 2004). 

 

Tide pools are commonly used by various species of transient fish in their early stages 

of development that later move to subtidal waters as adults (Randall, 1955; Norris, 

1963; Major, 1978). It is generally agreed that this happens because tide pools provide 

refuge from predators through structural complexity (vegetation cover, debris and 

substratum rugosity) (Bennett and Griffiths, 1984; Davis, 2000), favorable 

temperatures for growth (Gibson, 1994) and suitable food availability (Grossman, 

1982).  



13 
 

Recent definitions of nursery areas include higher survival, faster growth, higher 

density and higher contribution to the adult habitats (Steves et al., 1999; Beck et al., 

2001). Important efforts have been made to quantify the contribution of different 

marine ecosystems that function as nurseries areas, to adult populations, so that 

habitats which contribute most can be identified and protected (e.g. Gillanders and 

Kingsford, 1996; Yamashita et al., 2000; Beck et al., 2001; Gillanders, 2005, Dahlgren et 

al., 2006).   

Alterations to the habitat quality and efficiency of nurseries may be a major cause of 

adult fish stock decrease (Riley et al., 1981), since the larval and juvenile phases of 

fishes are crucial for future recruitment to the adult stocks (e.g. Haedrich, 1983; Miller 

et al., 1985). This way, it is of the utmost importance to indentify and evaluate the 

importance of all ecosystems and habitats as nusery areas for the most important fish 

species. However, this is still largely unkown for tide pools of rocky reefs. 

 

The current work is a first step in the investigation of the importance of rocky tide 

pools as nursery areas for fish and is composed of two scientific articles with the 

following titles: “Use of rocky intertidal pools as nursery areas by marine fish larvae 

and juveniles” and “Trophic role of marine fish larvae and juveniles that use rocky 

intertidal pools”.

4. Use of rocky intertidal pools as nursery areas by marine fish 

larvae and juveniles  

 

4.1 Summary 

 

Fishes were sampled monthly, in four tidal pools, for two years, in the west Portuguese 

coast. Species diversity of transient fish was higher than that found in previous studies, 

in other parts of the world. The transient fish population comprised six species: the 

white seabream, Diplodus sargus, sand smelt, Atherina spp., the thinlip grey mullet, 

Liza ramada, the Baillon's wrasse, Symphodus bailloni, the zebra seabream, Diplodus 

cervinus and the European pilchard, Sardina pilchardus. Fish abundance varied 

seasonally, between years and among pools, with peak numbers in spring and 

summer. The most abundant species, both as larvae and juveniles, was D. sargus, in all 

pools. D. sargus and Atherina spp. were present in most pools, from spring to autumn. 

Rare species were present mostly in spring-summer. Lower mean sizes were registered 

in the beginning of spring of 2011 (March-April) and in the end of spring/ beginning of 

summer of 2012 (May-June), when pools were colonized. Mean size often showed a 

continuous increase from spring to autumn in both years. The highest density peaks 

were due to the high number of post-larvae entering the pools in spring. In most pools, 

the overall condition (Fulton’s K) of D. sargus increased throughout the year, in both 

years. The overall condition of Atherina spp. was maintained or decreased throughout 

the year, in both years. The species richness, the high densities of larvae and juveniles 

and their continuous growth, observed in tidal pools, strongly emphasize the 



23 
 

importance of these environments for larvae and juveniles of several transient marine 

fishes.

4.2 Introduction  

 

Often, marine juvenile fish enter nursery areas after metamorphosis, having been 

spawned somewhere else in the sea. They spend months to years in these habitats and 

then move to their adult ones (Randall, 1955; Norris, 1963; Major, 1978). This pattern 

of habitat utilization has long been recognized and it is known to occur because 

sheltered habitats provide advantages over the marine environment regarding 

protection from predators and an abundant food supply (Clark, 1974; Cushing, 1975; 

Lenanton, 1982; Boesch and Turner, 1984; Gibson, 1994).  

Nursery habitats have also been described as being areas where growth and survival of 

settled juveniles are enhanced (Gibson, 1994), or areas where post-settled juvenile fish 

can prevail and grow prior to first spawning (Steves et al., 1999). Recent definitions of 

nursery areas are based on four factors: higher survival; faster growth; higher density 

and contribution of nurseries to the adult habitats (Steves et al., 1999; Beck et al., 

2001). Important efforts have been made to quantify the contribution of different 

marine ecosystems that function as nurseries areas, to adult populations, so that 

habitats which contribute most can be identified and protected (e.g. Gillanders and 

Kingsford, 1996; Yamashita et al., 2000; Beck et al., 2001; Gillanders, 2005, Dahlgren et 

al., 2006).  



24 
 

Alterations to the habitat quality and efficiency of nurseries may be a major cause of 

adult fish stock decrease (Riley et al., 1981), since the larval and juvenile phases of 

fishes are crucial for future recruitment to the adult stocks (e.g. Haedrich, 1983; Miller 

et al., 1985).  

Various coastal habitats are well known as nurseries for juvenile marine fish (Clark, 

1974; Lenanton, 1982). These include estuaries (Wallace and Van Der Elst, 1975; Day et 

al., 1981; Wallace et al., 1984, Costa and Bruxelas, 1989; Vinagre et al., 2010), coastal 

lagoons (Franco et al., 2006; Abecasis et al., 2009; Ribeiro et al., 2012), salt marshes 

(Veiga et al., 2006), coral reefs (Nagelkerken et al., 2000), mangroves (Nagelkerken et 

al., 2000; Dorenbosch et al., 2004), surf zone reefs (Berry et al., 1982), seagrass beds 

(Nagelkerken et al., 2000; Dorenbosch et al., 2004; Verweij et al., 2008) and the sandy 

beach surf zone (Lasiak, 1981, 1983). 

Estuarine nurseries are the best documented to date, with numerous studies, from as 

early as the larval phase of numerous fish species (e.g. Miskiewicz, 1986; Roper, 1986; 

Boehlert and Mundy, 1988; Whitfield, 1994; Harris and Cyrus, 2000). Rocky tidal pools 

are probably the least studied nurseries for marine fish, leaving a considerable 

research gap worldwide. 

Several studies have been developed in rocky tidal pools that include transient juvenile 

fish, concerning their recruitment in tidal pools of South Africa (Beckley, 2000) and 

New Zealand (Willis and Roberts, 1996); species diversity and seasonal changes, in 

Brazil (Barreiros et al., 2004), India (Tsering et al., 2012) and California (Moring, 1986); 

community structure, in Colombia (Castellanos-Galindo et al., 2005), Australia 

(Griffiths, 2003a), Azores (Santos et al., 1994), Japan (Murase, 2013), Barbados (Mahon 

and Mahon, 1994) and Brazil (Cunha et al., 2008); concerning spatial and temporal 



25 
 

dynamics in Australia (Griffiths, 2003b), Japan (Arakaki and Tokeshi, 2006), spatial and 

vertical patterns in Hawaii (Cox et al., 2011),  re-colonization after experimental 

elimination, in California (Thompson and Lehner, 1976; Grossman, 1982) and in South 

Africa (Beckley, 1985b) and feeding guild structure in Colombia (Castellanos-Galindo 

and Geraldo, 2008). However, the only studies that investigated the nursery function 

of these habitats were carried out in South Africa (Beckley, 1985a; Bennett, 1987; 

Gibson and Yoshiyama, 1999). 

Among the fish that use rocky tidal pools, the best studied fish are from the families 

Gobiidae and Blenniidae (Almada et al., 1983, 1990, 1992, 1994; Almada and Santos, 

1995; Faria et al., 1996, 1998a, 1998b; Faria and Almada, 2001). However, these are 

resident fish. Larvae and juveniles of some marine transient fish species are often also 

observed in these environments (Gibson, 1982; Beckley, 1985a; Santos et al., 1994; 

Almada and Faria, 2004; Barreiros et al., 2004). In southern Europe, the very high 

densities of early forms of marine fish in rocky tidal pools are indicative that these 

habitats may be important nurseries for highly commercial fish species, like the white 

seabream Diplodus sargus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Garcia-Rubies, 1997).  

The use of tidal pools during early ontogeny may enhance the growth, condition and 

survival chances of the individuals that use them (Thompson and Lehner, 1976; 

Moring, 1986, 1990; Mahon and Mahon, 1994; Macpherson, 1998). Refuge from larger 

predators is granted in tidal pools during ebb tide, because larger animals remain in 

the subtidal (Metaxas and Scheibling, 1993; Mahon and Mahon, 1994; Gibson, 1994). 

In spring and summer, water in tidal pools is warmer than in subtidal environments 

because they are exposed to the warmer atmospheric temperatures (Prochazka, 

1996). This allows faster development of early fish stages, since temperature is a 



26 
 

crucial variable for growth (Haedrich, 1983). Tidal pools may also be preferential 

feeding grounds for marine juvenile fish, since these highly structured environments 

harbor high biodiversity, abundant macroalgae and small invertebrates that are 

potential prey for juvenile fish (Beckley, 1985a; Moring, 1986; Amara and Paul, 2003; 

Cunha et al., 2007). 

 

This study aims to investigate 1) the species diversity of marine fish larvae and 

juveniles using rocky tidal pools, in a southern European coast, 2) the seasonality of 

the use of these habitats by these species, 3) the condition of the individuals and 4) 

the size structure throughout the year. 

 

4.3. Materials and Methods 

 

Four rocky tidal pools were selected for this study. They were located in 2 exposed 

rocky beaches, distanced 1.4 km, in the central coast of Portugal (Fig. 1). Each tidal 

pool was characterized in terms of depth and approximate area (Table 1). These pools 

were studied monthly, during 2 years, from January 2011 to December 2012. They 

were visited every month in the first diurnal spring tide of the month, when tide height 

was approximately 0.7 m. Tides at this latitude are semi-diurnal. Water temperature 

was registered (Fig. 2), as well as the dominant substrata and biota. Whenever larvae 

and/or juveniles of marine fish were present, they were collected with hand nets, with 

a stretched mesh of 1 mm, transported to the laboratory in refrigerated bags and 

preserved at -20 °C.

In the laboratory, fish were identified to the species level, measured to the nearest 

mm and weighed with a precision of 0.1 g. The ontogenetic stage of the species was 

identified according to García and Moyano (1990). Post-larval stages were classified as 

larvae a, b, c, d and e, for D. sargus, and larvae a, b and c, for Atherina spp.. Condition 

was estimated based on Fulton’s K, according to the equation: 

K = 100Mt/Lt
3 

where Mt is total wet mass (mg) and Lt is total length (mm) (Ricker, 1975). 

 

4.4. Results 

 

Pools’ depth varied between 30 cm and 63 cm and their area ranged between 1.14 m

A total of 6 species of non-resident fish were identified in the pools: the white 

seabream, D. sargus, sand smelt, Atherina spp., the thinlip grey mullet, Liza ramada 

(Risso, 1827), the Baillon's wrasse, Symphodus bailloni (Valenciennes, 1839), the zebra 

seabream, Diplodus cervinus (Lowe, 1838) and the European pilchard, Sardina 

pilchardus (Walbaum, 1792) (Table 1). 

A high inter-annual variability in both densities and time of pool colonization was 

observed. In 2011, the fish colonized the pools earlier, in March, while in 2012 it 

occurred in May. In 2011 the number of months with marine fish larvae and juveniles 

was also longer, than in 2012. In 2011, D. sargus, colonized the pools in spring (March-

April) and left the pools in autumn (September-November); in 2012, it colonized the 

pools in May-June and left in September-October. In 2011, Atherina spp. colonized the 

pools in March and left the pools in September; in 2012, colonization started in June 

and fish left in September (Fig. 3).

The highest densities were registered for D. sargus in all pools, followed by Atherina 

spp. with the exception of pool 2 of Beach B, where Atherina spp. were absent (Fig. 3). 

The number of species within the pools was very variable. L. ramada was present in 

pool 2 of Beach A and in pool 1 of Beach B; S. bailloni was present in pool 2 of both 

Beach A and Beach B; D. cervinus was present in all pools of Beach B but only was 

present in pool 2 of Beach A; S. pilchardus was only present in pool 1 of Beach B (Table 

1).  

 

D. sargus was present in all pools in both years with the exception of pool 2 of Beach 

B, where it was absent in 2012 (Fig. 3). In 2011, density peaks were registered from 

April to July, with variability among pools, the density peak was more pronounced in 

April in all pools with the exceptions of pool 2 of Beach A, where the peak was more 

pronounced in May, and pool 1 of Beach A where the peak was more pronounced  in 

July. In 2012, the density peaks were observed from June to September (Fig. 3). 

 

Atherina spp. were the second most abundant marine transient fish in the pools in 

both years, with the exceptions of pool 1 of Beach A where they were absent in 2012 

and pool 2 of Beach B where they were absent in both years. In 2011, the density 

peaks occurred in June and August; in 2012, the density peak occurred only in August 

(Fig. 3).  

 

The density peaks were higher in 2011 than in 2012, for both D. sargus and Atherina 

spp., in all pools and months (Fig. 3). Rare species were present mostly in spring-

summer (Fig. 3) with a great inter-annual variability (e.g. S. pilchardus was only present 



31 
 

in 2011, on only one occasion, and S. bailloni was only present in 2012). Great 

variability was registered both among pools and months. No rare species were found 

in pool 1 of Beach A. Rare species appeared in more months in 2012, than in 2011. 

 

Post-larval stages of D. sargus colonized the pools in March-April of 2011 and May of 

2012, in the first post-flexion larval stage (larvae a). As the months passed, the stage of 

development changed and the larvae reached the ultimate stage of larval 

development. In June of both years, early juveniles started to appear in the pools, with 

variability among pools (Fig. 4a). 

 

 In pool 2 of Beach A, post-larval stages of Atherina spp. started to appear in the 

second post-flexion larval stage (larvae b); in pool 1 of Beach A, post-larval stages of 

Atherina spp. were only present in the third post-flexion larval stage (larvae c). In pool 

1 of Beach B, all the ontogenetic larval stages of the development were present. The 

early juveniles started to appear in June of 2011 and in August of 2012, with variability 

among pools (Fig. 4b).

In all pools, the overall condition of D. sargus increased throughout the year, in both 

years, with the exception of pool 2 of Beach B where the overall condition decreased 

(Fig. 5). The mean Fulton’s K varied between 0.6 and 1.8 in 2011 and between 0.6 and 

1.3 in 2012 (Fig. 5).

In pool 2 of Beach A, it was observed the maintenance of the overall condition of 

Atherina spp. in the months that they were present (summer-autumn). In pool 1 of 

Beach B, a decreasing of the overall condition (spring-autumn) was observed, in both 

years. The mean Fulton’s K varied between 0.2 and 0.4 in 2011 and between 0.3 and 

0.6 in 2012 (Fig. 5). 

 

Sizes of the most abundant fish, D. sargus and Atherina spp. were different among 

months for all pools. Lower mean sizes were registered in the beginning of spring of 

2011 (March-April) and in the end of spring/beginning of summer of 2012 (May-June) 

(Fig. 6). Mean size often showed a continuous increase from spring to autumn in both 

years (Fig. 6).

4.5. Discussion 

 

This study showed the importance of tidal pools for late stage larval and early juveniles 

of marine fish, especially for D. sargus and Atherina spp., given the high densities and 

continuous growth observed. The tidal pools studied were used by larvae and juveniles 

of six species of marine fishes. Previous studies on other rocky tidal pools reported a 

lower number of non-resident fish species, typically three or four (Santos et al., 1994; 

Barreiros et al., 2004; Tsering et al., 2012). 

 

The white seabream, Diplodus sargus (Linnaeus, 1758), was the most abundant 

transient species in the present study, both as larvae and juveniles. It was also the 

species that used these habitats in a more consistent way and within a longer 

timeframe. It is a species with a coastal rocky reef distribution, although it also occurs 

in estuaries, ranging from the Mediterranean to the eastern Atlantic (from the Bay of 

Fig. 6 - Variation of mean length throughout the sampling period (bars indicate standard deviation).

Biscay to South Africa) (Vigliola et al., 1998) and constitutes an important fishery 

resource along its coasts (Gordoa and Molí, 1997). After one month of larval life, it 

settles in very shallow benthic habitats mainly from May to June, where it remains for 

several months (Gordoa and Molí, 1997). Changes in habitat use with growth have 

been described for D. sargus in Mediterranean rocky reefs, from inhabiting specific 

settlement habitats within the nursery, to colonizing the whole nursery and finally 

leaving the nursery to join the adult stock (Harmelin-Vivien et al., 1995; Biagi et al., 

1998; Macpherson, 1998; Vigliola and Harmelin-Vivien, 2001). 

 

Sand smelt, Atherina spp., includes various species of this genus, most often A. 

presbyter and A. boyeri, which are very difficult to distinguish by visual observation. It 

was the second most abundant marine transient fish found in the present study. These 

are euryhaline fish which inhabit coastal and estuarine waters, as well as lagoons, salt 

marshes and shallow brackish water ecosystems. They occur in the Mediterranean and 

in the Atlantic coast of Europe (Hendersen and Bamber, 1987). It is a relatively 

important commercial fish in some countries. The reproductive period lasts from the 

start of March to the end of July (Leonardos and Sinis, 2000), it hatches as a post-larva 

and forms schools in sheltered, inshore waters (Hendersen and Bamber, 1987). 

 

Early stages of L. ramada, S. bailloni, D. cervinus and S. pilchardus were also found in 

the tidal pools, although in lower numbers. These are also typical shallow water 

transient marine species of west-European coasts (Henriques and Almada, 1998; 

Nicolas et al., 2010; França et al., 2011; Ribeiro et al., 2012). 



36 
 

In this study, transient fish were observed in the tidal pools from spring to autumn and 

left in winter. This pattern had been previously observed for various marine fish 

species that use estuaries as nursery areas (e.g. Elliott and Dewailly, 1995; Cabral and 

Costa, 1999; Power et al., 2000; Amaral and Cabral, 2004; Vinagre et al., 2005), 

including D. sargus (Ribeiro et al., 2006). This reinforces the results of previous studies 

from temperate regions, demonstrating that the abundances of species and individuals 

increase in late spring and summer due to the influx of juveniles of transient species 

following their breeding seasons (Gibson and Yoshiyama, 1999).  

 

The highest density peaks registered were due to the high number of post-larvae 

entering the pools in spring. The mean density and species richness of rockpool fish 

decreased in autumn. This is attributed to a decrease in recruitment of transient 

species into the rockpool environments. Population densities and diversity of fish 

species indicate that rocky intertidal pools may have seasonal importance as nursery 

areas for juveniles of coastal species.  

 

The period of time when these habitats were used by early stages of transient fish 

presented inter-annual variability for all species studied, which is in accordance with 

previous studies (Shulman, 1985; Fowler et al., 1992, Doherty and Fowler, 1994). 

Temporal variability in species abundance and richness between years may be 

associated with the different precipitation regime among the years analyzed. Intense 

winter rainfall in 2011 may have enhanced the productivity of coastal waters due to 

increased terrestrial run-off of organic matter, an effect that has been demonstrated in 

other coastal areas adjacent to major rivers (Darnaude et al., 2004). The coastal area 



37 
 

studied in this work receives organic matter of terrestrial origin carried by the plume of 

the river Tagus (Vinagre et al., 2011; 2012), the second largest river in the Iberian 

Peninsula in terms of drainage. 

 

Terrestrial run-off may also increase the amount of chemical cues in coastal waters 

used by larval fish to direct their movement towards nursery areas (Miller, 1988). The 

effect of the intensity of the Tagus river plume on juvenile fish recruitment to 

estuarine nurseries has been shown for other coastal fish, such as the soles, Solea 

solea (Linnaeus, 1758) and Solea senegalensis Kaup, 1858 and the European seabass, 

Dicentrarchus labrax (Linnaeus, 1758) (Vinagre et al., 2007, 2009) and may also be 

important for the species reported in the present study. 

 

While 2011 had intense rainfall in winter, 2012 was a draught year. The lower numbers 

of transient fish larvae and juveniles found in the pools in 2012, may be due to lower 

recruitment, consequence of a decrease in the intensity of chemical cues reaching the 

spawning areas and to a general lower enrichment in organic matter of this coastal 

area that possibly lowered the amount of food available for these early life-stages. 

The change from larvae to juveniles, as time passed, as well as the gradual increase in 

mean size registered for the most abundant species, D. sargus and Atherina spp., 

indicates that these fish continuously use tidal pools during the period when these 

habitats are favorable.  

 

K values of D. sargus were lower in spring and reached its highest in autumn. The fact 

that K values increased along the months indicates that the fishes enhanced their 



38 
 

overall condition while they were using the pools, indicating that this is a favorable 

habitat for this species’ growth. Exception made to Atherina spp. that showed 

maintenance of K values throughout the months. 

 

Long-term data time-series would allow the investigation of inter-annual patterns of 

tidal pool colonization and how they relate to environmental factors, like already 

known for estuaries (e.g. Vinagre et al., 2007, 2009). Investigations into the differential 

survival and recruitment to adult stocks of the individuals that use tidal pools versus 

the ones that do not, or that use estuaries as nurseries, should clarify how important 

tidal pools are for the maintenance of adult stocks of important commercial species, 

such as D. sargus. This has been accomplished for fish that use estuarine nurseries 

using otolith microchemistry analysis (e.g. Gillanders and Kingsford, 1996; Thorrold et 

al., 1998; Yamashita et al., 2000; Gillanders, 2005) but remains unknown for transient 

fish that use rocky reef tidal pools during early life-stages. 

 

Future studies should elucidate if the individuals visiting the pools during ebb tide are 

always the same. This would reveal if these species have site fidelity to each pool or if 

the occupation of these habitats is occasional and if individuals that inhabit coastal 

subtidal waters occasionally use tidal pools during ebb tide. Tagging and release 

studies would bring new insights into this question.

5. Trophic role of marine fish larvae and juveniles that use 

rocky intertidal pools  

 

5.1. Summary 

 

Transient marine fishes were sampled monthly, in four tidal pools of a rocky reef, for 

two years, in the west Portuguese coast. The diet composition and trophic role of the 

most abundant marine fish larvae/juveniles in the tidal pools, Diplodus sargus and 

Atherina spp., were investigated. The stomach contents of 483 individuals (354 D. 

sargus ranging from 7 mm to 87 mm and 129 Atherina spp. ranging from 10 mm to 38 

mm) were analyzed. D. sargus consumed a great variety of prey groups, including 

Algae, Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Entoprocta, Annelida, Crustacea, Insecta, Acari, 

Mollusca and Teleostei. Atherina spp. presented a lower diversity of food groups than 

D. sargus; these included Crustacea, Insecta, Acari and Mollusca. The diet of D. sargus 

was composed mainly of harpacticoid copepods, chironomid larvae, ostracods, 

chironomid adults and amphipods; whereas the diet of Atherina spp. was composed 

mainly of Harpacticoid copepods, ostracods and gastropods. Along the ontogenetic 

development, the proportions and diversity of food items in the diet of D. sargus 

varied. The importance of harpacticoid copepods decreased with increasing size, while 

the importance of amphipods and isopods increased. The trophic role of larvae and 

juveniles of D. sargus and Atherina spp. occurring in tidal pools of rocky reefs is that of 

opportunistic consumers with a wide range of prey, that take advantage of these 

habitats’ high prey availability.

Keywords: Rocky reefs, tidal pools, habitat use, trophic ecology, diet. 

 

5.2. Introduction  

 

Ontogenetic shifts in habitat use are a common phenomenon in marine fishes (Beck et 

al., 2001; Gillanders et al., 2003) and occur as an adaptive response to reduce 

predation, enhance food availability and reduce competition (Clark, 1974; Cushing, 

1975; Lenanton, 1982; Boesch and Turner, 1984; Macpherson, 1998). Several species 

of fish use nursery grounds in the larval and juvenile stages and move to subtidal 

waters as adults (Randall, 1955; Norris, 1963; Major, 1978).  

The use of tidal pools during early ontogeny is likely to enhance growth, condition and 

survival chances of the individuals that use them (Thompson and Lehner, 1976; 

Moring, 1986, 1990; Gibson, 1994; Mahon and Mahon, 1994; Macpherson, 1998; 

Strydom, 2008). These habitats are highly structured providing many refuges, having 

high biodiversity, abundance of potential prey and, during spring and summer, they 

warm during the ebb tide attaining temperatures that are more favorable for fish 

growth than those of subtidal waters (Beckley, 1985a; Moring, 1986; Amara and Paul, 

2003; Cunha et al., 2007). Rapid growth enables young fishes to achieve refuge and 

exclude a major part of the size-selective predation (Pihl and Van der Veer, 1992; 

Gibson, 1994; Leggett and DeBIois, 1994; Van der Veer et al., 1994).  

Various coastal habitats are well known as nurseries for juvenile marine fish (Clark, 

1974; Lenanton, 1982). These include estuaries (Wallace and Van Der Elst, 1975; Day et 

al., 1981; Wallace et al., 1984, Costa and Bruxelas, 1989; Vinagre et al., 2010), coastal 

lagoons (Franco et al., 2006; Abecasis et al., 2009; Ribeiro et al., 2012), salt marshes 



57 
 

(Veiga et al., 2006), coral reefs (Nagelkerken et al., 2000;), mangroves (Nagelkerken et 

al., 2000; Dorenbosch et al., 2004), surf zone reefs (Berry et al., 1982), seagrass beds 

(Nagelkerken et al., 2000; Dorenbosch et al., 2004; Verweij et al., 2008) and the sandy 

beach surf zone (Lasiak, 1981, 1983). 

Estuarine nurseries are the best documented to date, with numerous studies, from as 

early as the larval phase of numerous fish species (e.g. Miskiewicz, 1986; Roper, 1986; 

Boehlert and Mundy, 1988; Whitfield, 1994; Harris and Cyrus, 2000). Rocky tidal pools 

are probably the least studied nurseries for marine fish, leaving a considerable 

research gap worldwide. 

Several studies have been developed in rocky tidal pools that include transient juvenile 

fish, concerning their recruitment in tidal pools of South Africa (Beckley, 2000) and 

New Zealand (Willis and Roberts, 1996); species diversity and seasonal changes, in 

Brazil (Barreiros et al., 2004), India (Tsering et al., 2012) and California (Moring, 1986); 

community structure, in Colombia (Castellanos-Galindo et al., 2005), Australia 

(Griffiths, 2003a), Azores (Santos et al., 1994), Japan (Murase, 2013), Barbados (Mahon 

and Mahon, 1994) and Brazil (Cunha et al., 2008); concerning spatial and temporal 

dynamics in Australia (Griffiths, 2003b), Japan (Arakaki and Tokeshi, 2006), spatial and 

vertical patterns in Hawaii (Cox et al., 2011), re-colonization after experimental 

elimination, in California (Thompson and Lehner, 1976; Grossman, 1982) and in South 

Africa (Beckley, 1985b), feeding guild structure in Colombia (Castellanos-Galindo and 

Geraldo, 2008) and nursery function in South Africa (Beckley, 1985a; Bennett, 1987; 

Gibson and Yoshiyama, 1999). Castellanos-Galindo and Geraldo (2008), studied the 

juveniles’ diet of transient fish species in Colombia, namely Abudefduf concolor (Gill, 

1862), Abudefduf troschelii (Gill, 1862), Halichoeres aestuaricola (Bussing, 1972), 



58 
 

Chaenomugil proboscideus (Günther, 1861) and Echidna nocturna (Cope, 1872). In that 

study, A. concolor and A. troschelii were considered herbivorous and specialist feeder 

species, feeding mainly on macroalgae and diatoms; H. aestuaricola was considered a 

carnivorous species, feeding on bivalves, copepods and amphipods; C. proboscideus 

was considered an herbivorous and a macroalgae specialist feeder species and E. 

nocturna was considered an exclusively carnivorous species, feeding on shrimps, 

brachyurans and stomatopods. 

It is widely acknowledged that food abundance affects organisms’ distribution patterns 

(Van der Veer and Witte, 1993; Gibson, 1994; Vinagre et al., 2006). Fish concentrate in 

areas of more abundant prey even if other environmental variables are suboptimal 

(Lockwood, 1974; Pearcy and Hancock, 1978; Imabayashi, 1980; Poxton et al., 1982; 

Marchand, 1988; Vinagre et al., 2006). 

In southern Europe, the very high densities of early forms of marine fish in rocky tidal 

pools (personal observation) are indicative that these habitats may be important 

nurseries for various abundant marine fish species, like the white seabream Diplodus 

sargus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Garcia-Rubies, 1997) and the sand smelt Atherina spp.. Even 

though these species’ diet is well-known in other habitats (Moretti et al., 1959; Castel 

et al., 1977; Christensen, 1978; Marfin, 1981; Ferrari and Rossi, 1983–84; Gon and Ben-

Tuvia, 1983; Rosecchi, 1987; Mantilacci et al., 1990; Danilova, 1991; Rosecchi and 

Grivelli, 1992; Mirto et al., 1994; Trabelsi et al., 1994; Gisbert et al., 1996; Sala and 

Ballesteros, 1997; Sanchez and Norbis, 1997; Pepe et al., 1998; Scilipoti, 1998; Mariani 

et al., 2002; Bartulovic et al., 2004; Figueiredo et al., 2005; Sá et al., 2006; Crisafi et al., 

2007; Leitão et al., 2007), there is a knowledge gap in what concerns their diet and 

trophic role in tidal pools. That information is important for the understanding of the 



59 
 

reasons why such juveniles use these environments in high numbers in spring and 

summer. 

This study aims to investigate the diet composition of the most abundant marine 

transient fish larvae and juveniles in tidal pools of the Portuguese coast, D. sargus and 

Atherina spp., and their trophic role in these habitats. 

 

5.3. Materials and Methods 

 

Four rocky tidal pools were selected for this study. They were located in 2 exposed 

rocky beaches, distanced 1.4 km, in the central coast of Portugal (Fig. 1). Each tidal 

pool was characterized in terms of depth and approximate area (Table 1). These pools 

were studied monthly, during 2 years, from January 2011 to December 2012. They 

were visited every month in the first spring tide of the month, when tide height was 

approximately 0.7 m. Tides are semi-diurnal. Water temperature was registered (Fig. 

2), as well as the dominant substrata and biota. Whenever larvae and/or juveniles of 

marine transient fish were present they were collected with hand nets, transported to 

the laboratory in refrigerated bags and preserved at -20 °C.

In the laboratory, fish were identified to the species level, measured to the nearest 

mm, weighed with a precision of 0.1 g. The ontogenetic stage of the species was 

identified according to García and Moyano (1990). Post-larval stages were classified as 

larvae a, b, c, d and e, for D. sargus, and larvae a, b and c, for Atherina spp. and their 

stomach excised for the identification of its contents. Fish used for diet analysis were 

captured in spring and summer. The stomach contents of 483 individuals (354 D. 

sargus ranging from 7 mm to 87 mm and 129 Atherina spp. ranging from 10 mm to 38 

mm) were analyzed. Dietary indices were calculated according to Hyslop (1980). The 

relative importance of each prey item in the diet was evaluated by three indices: the 

numerical index (NI) – percentage of the number of individuals of a prey over the total 

number of individuals of all prey; the occurrence index (OI) – percentage of non-empty 

stomachs in which a prey occurred over the total number of occurrences; and the 

volumetric index (VI) – percentage in volume occupied of a prey over the total volume 

of all prey. In order to assess diet variation throughout the ontogeny, the dietary 

Fig. 2 – Water temperature in the pools during the sampling period. 



62 
 

indices were calculated for each developmental stage. Vacuity was assessed as 

percentage of empty stomachs. 

 

A chi-square test was conducted to evaluate differences in both numerical and 

occurrence indices among different stages of development of both D. sargus and 

Atherina spp.. A significance level of 0.05 was considered.  

 

5.4. Results 

 

Pools’ depth varied between 30 cm and 63 cm and their area ranged between 1.14 m
2
 

and 22.00 m
2
 (Table 1). Temperature varied between 7 °C and 25 °C in 2011 (January 

and September, respectively) and between 9 °C and 25 °C in 2012 (January and 

September, respectively) (Fig. 2). The pools’ algal communities were dominated by 

Ellisolandia elongata (J. Ellis and Solander) K. R. Hind and G. W. Saunders, 2013, 

Phymatolithon calcareum (Pallas) W. H. Adey and D. L. McKibbin, 1970, Asparagopsis 

armata Harvey, 1855 and Ulva lactuca Linnaeus, 1753. 

 

The percentage of empty stomachs was very low for both species. It ranged between 

0% and 6% for D. sargus and 0% and 15% for Atherina spp. (Table 2, 3). In Atherina 

spp. it decreased with development, reaching 0% in larvae c and in juveniles (Table 2, 

3).

D. sargus’ larvae b diet was also comprised mainly of Harpacticoid copepods (NI = 89.8; 

VI = 68.2; OI = 47.1). The second most important item was chironomid larvae for all 

indices (NI = 6.5; VI = 20.8; OI = 23.5) and ostracods were the third most important 

item, also for all indices (NI = 2.9; VI = 3.1; OI = 13.4) (Table 2). 

 

D. sargus’ larvae c diet was also comprised mainly of Harpacticoid copepods (NI = 89.8; 

VI = 53.4; OI = 33.5). The second most important item was chironomid larvae for all 

indices (NI = 4.5; VI = 12.6; OI = 15.9) and amphipods were the third most important 

item according to all indices (NI = 2.5; VI = 11.2; OI = 12.9) (Table 2). 

 

D. sargus’ larvae d diet was also comprised mainly of Harpacticoid copepods (NI = 67.3; 

VI = 30.4; OI = 25.9). While numerical and occurrence indices have chironomid larvae 

as the second most important food item (NI = 17.5; OI = 20.9), the volumetric index 

has chironomid adults at the second position (VI = 23.9), leaving chironomid larvae in 

the third position in terms of volumetric index (VI = 22.7) and chironomid adults as the 

third most important food item according to the numerical and occurrence indices (NI 

= 7.8; OI = 17.7) (Table 2). 

 

For D. sargus’ larvae e, Harpacticoid copepods and chironomid larvae were the most 

important food items according to both numerical and occurrence indices (NI = 46.3; 

OI = 22.0 and NI = 37.3; OI = 20.8, respectively) (Table 2). Volumetrically chironomid 

larvae was the most important food item while Harpacticoid copepods were less 

important (VI = 32.2 and VI = 13.9, respectively). Chironomid adults were the second 

most important group volumetrically (VI = 20.2) and the third most important item in 



66 
 

terms of both numerical and occurrence indices (NI = 7.6; OI = 17.9). Amphipods were 

the third most important group volumetrically (VI = 14.6) (Table 2). 

 

D. sargus juveniles’ diet was comprised mainly of Harpacticoid copepods (NI = 46.8; VI 

= 10.3; OI = 19.0). While numerical and occurrence indices have Harpacticoid copepods 

as the most important food item (NI = 46.8; OI = 19.0), the volumetric index has 

amphipods at the top position (VI = 10.3 and VI = 21.1, respectively) (Table 2). The 

second most important item in terms of numerical index was chironomid larvae (NI = 

16.6), but it had lower volumetric and occurrence indices (VI = 11.0; OI = 12.1) than 

amphipods and chironomid adults (VI = 21.1; OI = 14.5 and VI = 17.7; OI = 15.5, 

respectively). Ostracods were the third most important group in terms of numerical 

index (NI = 11.7) (Table 2). 

 

Atherina spp.’s larvae a diet was comprised mainly of Harpacticoid copepods (NI = 

77.1; VI = 63.6; OI = 45.0). Ostracods were the second most important group in terms 

of numerical index (NI = 10.8) and the third in terms of occurrence index (OI = 10.0). 

Although ostracods have a greater numerical index than gastropods (NI = 10.8 and NI = 

9.6, respectively), gastropods had both greater volumetric and occurrence indices than 

ostracods (VI = 9.1; OI = 20.0 and VI = 8.2; OI = 10.0, respectively), occupying the 

second position in terms of volumetric and occurrence indices and the third position in 

terms of numerical index (Table 3). 

 

Atherina spp.’s larvae b diet was also comprised mainly of Harpacticoid copepods (NI = 

71.3; VI = 74.0; OI = 43.9). The second most important item in terms of both numerical 



67 
 

and occurrence indices was gastropods (NI = 15.6; OI = 23.2) and the third in terms of 

volumetric index (VI = 10.8). Ostracods were the second in terms of volumetric index 

(VI = 11.6) and the third most important item in terms of both numerical and 

occurrence indices (NI = 10.2; OI = 19.5) (Table 3). 

 

Atherina spp.’s larvae c diet was also comprised mainly of Harpacticoid copepods (NI = 

75.6; VI = 66.0; OI = 35.2). The second most important item concerning all indices was 

ostracods (NI = 9.3; VI = 13.1; OI = 26.6), followed by gastropods (NI = 7.8; VI = 7.8; OI = 

21.1) (Table 3). 

 

Atherina spp. juveniles’ diet was comprised mainly of Harpacticoid copepods (NI = 

90.5; VI = 70.9; OI = 32.1). Ostracods occupied the second position for all indices (NI = 

4.6; VI = 9.6; OI = 22.6). Gastropods occupied the third position in terms of numerical 

and occurrence indices (NI = 2.6; OI = 14.2) and chironomid larvae occupied the third 

position in terms of volumetric index (VI = 5.3) (Table 3).  

 

Chi-square test’s results indicated that there were significant differences among 

different stages of development in D. sargus, in both numerical and occurrence indices 

(p-value &amp;lt;0.05) and there were no significant differences among different stages of 

development in Atherina spp., in the both numerical and occurrence indices (p-value &gt; 

0.05).

5.5. Discussion 

 

Harpacticoid copepods were the most important prey for D. sargus in all the 

ontogenetic stages, with the exception of larvae e, for whom chironomid larvae were 

also highly relevant prey. All the indices estimated for harpaticoid copepods gradually 

decreased from the stage larvae a to the juvenile stage, which is in agreement with 

other studies on this species’ diet that showed that along the ontogenetic 

development, the proportion of harpacticoid copepods in the diet decreased 

(Christensen, 1978; Rosecchi, 1987). This may be related with the fact that, once they 

are small prey, as D. sargus grows, it would prefer bigger food items that provide more 

energy.  

 

Chironomid adults, amphipods and isopods were present in all stages of D. sargus, 

with the exception of larvae a. This probably happened due to their large size, since 

larvae a are small, they could not eat prey of that size. Along the ontogenetic 

development, their importance in D. sargus’ diet increased. 

 

Polychaetes, Cyathura sp., Lepidochitona cinerea (Linnaeus, 1767) and algae, namely 

brown algae, Ulva sp. and Ellisolandia elongata; were only eaten by juveniles, with the 

exception of polychaetes that were also eaten by larvae e. These food items presented 

low importance in terms of indices values, but accounted for the increase of food 

items diversity consumed by juveniles of D. sargus. On the other hand, Palaemon spp. 

had some importance in juveniles’ diet, which may be related with its high energetic 



69 
 

value (Velasco et al., 2010). Hydrozoans, entoprocts, Paragnathia formica (Hesse, 

1864), platyhelminthes and acarids were present, but with very low importance. 

 

Harpacticoid copepods, ostracods and gastropods were present in all stages of 

Atherina spp. with high indices values. Bivalves and chironomid larvae were also 

present in all stages but with low indices values, with the exception of chironomid 

larvae’s occurrence index that was high in juveniles. Amphipods and isopods were only 

present in both larvae c and juveniles’ stomachs. Cirripede larvae and acarids were 

present, but with low importance in terms of indices values. 

 

As D. sargus and Atherina spp. larvae developed, they started eating prey of larger 

size, like amphipods and isopods, and their diet became more diversified, although 

statistical significant differences were only found for D. sargus. This behavior has been 

recorded for other marine fish larvae (Govoni et al., 1983; Fortier and Harris, 1989; 

Vinagre et al., 2008), possibly as a consequence of the increased energy requirements 

during larval growth (Hunter, 1981). It is also generally recognized that the size of prey 

consumed by most fishes increases with increasing predator size (Keast and Webb, 

1966; Persson, 1990; Juanes, 1994). In addition to the faster swimming speeds and 

increased mouth gape size that occur as the fish grow, it is likely that both visual acuity 

and reaction distance to prey also markedly increase (Breck and Gitter, 1983; Wahl et 

al., 1993; Walton et al., 1994; Piet et al., 1998). Body size of both predator and prey 

have been linked directly to foraging success, since the escape response of prey is also 

strongly related to body size (Folkvord and Hunter, 1986; Blaxter and Fuiman, 1990). 



70 
 

The data presented indicates that D. sargus is an omnivorous and a generalist species, 

which is in line with previous studies in the South African marine littoral (Christensen, 

1978), in the Natal Coast of South Africa (Joubert and Hanekom, 1980), in the Medes 

Islands (Sala and Ballesteros, 1997), in the Lakes Fogliano and Caprolace (Mariani et al., 

2002), in the shallow coastal areas of Faial Island (Figueiredo et al., 2005) and in the 

Caprolace coastal lagoon (Costa and Cataudella, 2007). D. sargus is carnivorous earlier 

in its life and gradually increases the proportion of algae in its diet; it may ingest algae 

to collect their epiphyte diatoms (Joubert and Hanekon, 1980), to extract nutrients 

directly from the algae (Mann and Buxton, 1992) or to optimise the digestion of 

animals (Lobel, 1981). On the other hand, Atherina spp. are carnivorous and generalist 

species (Gon and Ben-Tuvia, 1983; Vizzini and Mazzola, 2005).  Both D. sargus and 

Atherina spp. have been described as opportunistic feeders in other habitats, such as 

subtidal rocky reefs and coastal lagoons (Mariani et al., 2002; Figueiredo et al., 2005; 

Vizzini and Mazzola, 2005). 

 

The food spectra characterized in the present study were in accordance with previous 

data on the same species in Golfe de Lion in France (Rosecchi, 1987), shallow coastal 

areas of Faial Island in Azores (Figueiredo et al., 2005) and in South African marine 

littoral (Christensen, 1978), for D. sargus, and in the Lagoon of Bardawil in Egypt (Gon 

and Ben-Tuvia, 1983), Laguna dello  Stagnone in Sicilia (Mirto et al., 1994) 

and Trichonis lake in Greece (Chrisafi et al., 2007), for Atherina spp..

Resident fishes of intertidal rock pools of the Portuguese coast, like Gobius paganellus 

Linnaeus, 1758, Gobius cobitis Pallas, 1814, Lipophrys pholis (Linnaeus, 1758) and 

Coryphoblennius galerita (Linnaeus, 1758) are omnivorous (Couch, 1877; Wheeler, 

1960, 1969; Velasco et al., 2010), and as they grow larger their diet changes to include 

larger organisms (Gibson, 1970), as observed in D. sargus. Their diet is similar to both 

D. sargus and Atherina spp.’s diet, including harpacticoid copepods, amphipods, 

isopods and gastropods. This suggests that resident fish in rock tidal pools are 

opportunistic feeders like D. sargus (Mariani et al., 2002; Figueiredo et al., 2005; Leitão 

et al., 2007) and Atherina spp. (Castel et al., 1977; Gon and Ben-Tuvia, 1983; Bartulovic 

et al., 2004; Chrisafi et al., 2007), that take advantage of the environment they inhabit 

since benthonic prey like Copepoda Harpacticoida, Amphipoda and Isopoda are very 

common in rocky tidal pools (Vizzini and Mazzola, 2005). 

 

The present study found that intertidal feeding habits of D. sargus change considerably 

as larvae and juveniles grow, consuming larger and more diverse prey along the 

ontogenetic development. In rocky intertidal pools, sessile invertebrates, algae, and 

plants provide habitat and food for a wide variety of mobile invertebrates, including 

amphipods, isopods, crabs, shrimp, polychaetes, gastropods, and chitons, that are 

major components of the diets of rocky intertidal fishes, which take advantage of the 

high prey availability of these habitats.  

 

Given that such small fish typically have very fast gastric evacuation rates (Bromley, 

1994) it is likely that the food found in the stomachs was consumed in the pool, during 

the ebbing tide, and not in the surrounding environment. The very low percentage of 



72 
 

empty stomachs found indicates that these fish use tidal pools as feeding grounds and 

not just as refuge from predators or because of the higher temperatures attained.  

 

Future studies should look at the differences in prey availability in tidal pools and 

adjacent subtidal environments, in order to further clarify the role of food abundance 

in the selection of tidal pools as habitats by transient marine fish larvae and juveniles.

6. General conclusions and Future work 
 

D. sargus and Atherina spp. were the most abundant transient marine fish within the 

rocky tidal pools. Other species of coastal marine fish also used tidal pools, but more 

inconsistently and in lower numbers (L. ramada, S. bailloni, D. cervinus and S. 

pilchardus). The use of tidal pools is seasonal, being the highest density peaks 

registered in spring due to the entering of high numbers of post-larvae in the pools. 

The density and species richness of rockpool fish is maximum in spring-summer due to 

the favorable conditions of this habitat and minimum in autumn.  

D. sargus and Atherina spp., continuously use tidal pools during the period when these 

habitats are favorable, we can see that in the change from larvae to juveniles, as well 

as the gradual increase in mean size and enhancement of the overall condition, along 

the time spent in the pools (spring-autumn). Exception made to Atherina spp. whose 

overall condition was maintained throughout the months.  

Abiotic factors, like rainfall patterns, may affect the time of arrival and the number of 

the transient fish encountered in tidal pools and explain the differences in species 

composition, densities, temporal patterns of colonization and habitat use found 

between 2011 and 2012. 

D. sargus consumed a greater variety of prey groups than Atherina spp.. It consumed 

Algae, Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Entoprocta, Annelida, Crustacea, Insecta, Acari, 

Mollusca and Teleostei, while Atherina spp. only consumed Crustacea, Insecta, Acari 



91 
 

and Mollusca. These food items are very common within tidal pools. Intertidal feeding 

habits of D. sargus change considerably as larvae and juveniles grow, consuming larger 

and more diverse prey along the ontogenetic development, only consuming algae in 

the juvenile stage. In D. sargus, the importance of harpacticoid copepods decreased 

along the development; whereas the importance of amphipods and isopods increased.  

D. sargus is an omnivorous, generalist and opportunistic species; whereas Atherina 

spp. are carnivorous, generalist and opportunistic species.  

 

The food items consumed for both D. sargus and Atherina spp. were similar to the 

ones consumed by the resident fish in the pools, which are also opportunistic species 

that take advantage of the high prey availability of these habitats. It was concluded 

that it is likely that the food found in the stomachs was consumed in the pool, during 

the ebbing tide, and not in the surrounding environment. Given that such small fish 

typically have very fast gastric evacuation rates, the very low percentage of empty 

stomachs found indicates that these fish use tidal pools as feeding grounds and not 

just as refuge from predators or because of the higher temperatures attained.  

 

Future works should include long-term data time-series to allow the investigation of 

inter-annual patterns of tidal pool colonization and how they relate to environmental 

factors. Investigations into the differential survival and recruitment to adult stocks of 

the individuals that use tidal pools versus the ones that do not, or that use estuaries as 

nurseries, should clarify how important tidal pools are for the maintenance of adult 

stocks of important commercial species.  



92 
 

It is also important to know if the individuals visiting the pools during the ebb tide are 

always the same. Tagging and release studies would reveal if these species have site 

fidelity to each pool or if the occupation of these habitats is occasional, and if 

individuals that inhabit coastal subtidal waters occasionally use tidal pools during ebb 

tide.  

 

The study of prey availability and diversity in tide pools and adjacent subtidal 

environments, should further clarify the importance of high food availability in the 

selection of tidal pools by transient marine fish larvae and juveniles.
