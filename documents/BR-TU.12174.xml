Abstract 

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are ubiquitous, underground, symbiotic 

associations involving a wide diversity of plants (approximately 80%) and obligate 

symbiotic fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota thought to have originated 400–500 

million years ago. In this intimate association the obligate biotrophic fungi provide 

terrestrial plants with minerals, nutrients (particularly inorganic phosphate) and water 

increasing the host resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, including pathogens, 

water limitation and environmental pollutants in return for photosynthates. Diversity of 

AMF is generally higher in natural and semi-natural systems than in more intensively 

managed agroecosystems, where it can be strongly reduced. The objective of this 

study was to investigate whether land use type can be characterized by their 

arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities, and to test the potential effect of 

AMF indigenous as inoculants on crops productivity and host tolerance to root-knot 

Meloidogyne incognita. 

AMF community structure associated to Holcus lanatus L. root was studied during two 

years in two land uses: semi-natural (Pico do Galhardo- PX; Terra Brava- TB) and 

intensive (Agualva 1- RP1; Agualva 2- RP2) pastures of Terceira Island (Azores). The 

spore community composition of AMF associated to Holcus lanatus L. root was 

determined by taxonomic identification of AMF spores. Thirthy-nine AMF species 

representing eight genera were detected in the land uses studied. The most 

representative genera of AMF spore community were Glomus, Acaulospora and 

Scutellospora.  Land use type had no significant effect on AMF spore diversity and 

total abundance. This also was confirmed by molecular methods (PCR-DGGE) on 

roots of H. lanatus. In Azorean pastureland the input of fertilisers is lower than average 

inputs to pastures on the European mainland, which presumably did not contribute to 

occurrence of an evident pattern of AMF diversity. However, the reverse was observed 

for colonisation of different AMF structures (arbuscules, vesicles and hyphae) on H. 

lanatus root, where the highest of AMF colonisation was in semi-natural use. 

Colonisation of different AMF structures on H. lanatus root showed a seasonal pattern 

between sampling dates. The higher abundance of AMF structures in the summer than 

in autumn/winter could be related to nutrient exchanges, host metabolic pathway, 

phenology and climatic variations.

Striking differences were found in AMF spores composition between land uses. 

Species of Glomus were dominant in intensive land uses, while Acaulospora and 

Scutellospora predominated in semi-natural ones. Different strategies of colonisation 

among AMF and soil nutrient levels may be the most important factors influencing the 

AMF community. Members of Glomaceae have a highly infective extra-radical 

mycelium that could allow colonising immediately plant roots (early succession), while 

members of Gigasporaceae are only capable of propagation via spore dispersal, 

therefore colonize plant roots more slowly than members of Glomaceae. Both spore 

densities of Glomus, Acaulospora and Scutellospora genera, as well as root 

colonisation were related with soil nutrients (N, K, Mg, Ca, OM), but no correlation was 

found with soil phosphorus (P). Our results confirm that the degree of AMF benefit to a 

host plant depends on plant species. Lolium perenne L. was the most mycorrhizal 

dependent plant (DM= 62%), followed by Holcus lanatus L. (DM= 40%) which resulted 

in an increase of foliar biomass more than 30 % in both plant species caused by 

inoculation with native AMF. Conversely, Lolium multiflorum L. was the less 

mycorrhizal dependent (DM= 27%) plant and also the less colonised. 

In more than 90% of the samples, inoculation with the native AMF conferred protection 

to H. lanatus from the root-knot Meloidogyne incognita. Among the mechanism 

proposed to explain the protective effect of AMF, we suggest that plant growth 

promotion by AMF, and direct competition between AMF and the nematode for host 

colonisation sites and photosynthates were involved.  

We conclude that: either AMF spore diversity or AMF diversity on H. lanatus root were 

independent of land use intensity; However,  in the intensive management regime,  

there was a trend to an increased incidence of certain AMF, especially from the 

Glomus indicating a potentially severe loss of ecosystem functions under this land use 

type; colonisation of different AMF structures was higher in semi-natural land use and 

showed a marked seasonal pattern, dependent of plant phenology and metabolic 

pathway and climatic conditions. Inoculation with indigenous AMF significantly 

increased plant productivity and tolerance to root-knot M. incognita, but degree of AMF 

benefit to a host plant varies in function of plant species. Thus, AMF may play an 

important role in ecosystems functioning, since their appropriate management can 

reduce the use of chemical and energy in agriculture and consequently lead to more 

economical and sustainable production systems.

Resumo 

Os fungos micorrízicos arbusculares (FMA) são associações simbióticas envolvendo 

uma ampla diversidade de plantas (aproximadamente 80%), e fungos simbiontes 

obrigatórios do filo Glomeromycota cuja origem estima-se ter ocorrido há 400-500 

milhões de anos. Nesta íntima associação o fungo biotrófico obrigatório supre a planta 

com minerais, nutrientes (particularmente fosfato inorgânico) e água, aumentando 

deste modo, a resistência da planta hospedeira a stresses bióticos e abióticos, 

incluindo agentes patogénicos, stress hidríco e poluentes ambientais em troca de 

produtos fotossíntetizados. A diversidade de FMA é geralmente mais elevada em 

sistemas naturais e semi-naturais do que em agro-ecossistemas mais intensivos, 

onde poderá ser fortemente reduzida. O objectivo deste estudo foi investigar se as 

comunidades de fungos micorrízicos poderão servir de ferramentas na caracterização 

do tipo de maneio do solo, e testar o potencial efeito da inoculação com fungos 

nativos na produtividade das culturas, bem como na sua tolerância a nemátodes 

formadores de galhas - Meloidogyne incognita. 

A estrutura da comunidade micorrízica associada às raízes de Holcus lanatus L. foi 

estudada durante dois anos em dois sistemas de uso do solo: pastagens semi-

naturais (Pico do Galhardo- PX; Terra Brava- TB) e intensivas (Agualva 1- RP1; 

Agualva 2- RP2) da ilha Terceira (Açores). A composição da comunidade de FMA 

associada a H. lanatus foi determinada tendo em conta as características 

morfológicas dos esporos de FMA. Nos dois sistemas de maneio do solo foram 

detectadas 39 espécies de FMA distribuídas por 8 géneros. Os géneros mais 

representativos foram Glomus, Acaulospora e Scutellospora. A diversidade de 

esporos de FMA, assim como, a sua abundância não foi afectada pelo tipo de maneio 

do solo. Este resultado também foi confirmado por via molecular (PCR-DGGE), em 

relação à diversidade de espécies da comunidade fúngica nas raízes de H. lanatus. 

Os níveis de fertilizantes aplicados nas pastagens açorianas são em média muito 

mais baixos, do que os aplicados em pastagens do continente Europeu, o que 

presumivelmente não terá contribuído para a obtenção de um evidente padrão de 

diversidade micorrízica. Contudo, a quantificação da colonização das diferentes 

estruturas micorrízicas (arbúsculos, vesículas e hifas) exibiu o padrão diferente, tendo 

sido mais elevada nas pastagens semi-naturais do que nas intensivas. Além disso, as 

diferentes estruturas micorrízicas exibiram um marcado padrão sazonal entre épocas 



16 
 

de amostragem, tendo sido mais abundantes durante o Verão do que no 

Outono/Inverno. Este facto, poderá estar relacionado com as trocas de nutrientes, a 

via metabólica do carbono da planta hospedeira, o estado fenológico e com as 

variações climáticas. Foram encontradas profundas diferenças na composição de 

espécies entre os dois sistemas de uso do solo. Nos sistemas semi-naturais os 

géneros mais representativos foram Acaulospora e Scutellospora, enquanto nos 

intensivos dominaram as espécies pertencentes ao género Glomus. O tipo de 

estratégia de colonização adoptado pelos diferentes FMA, bem como, os níveis de 

nutrientes do solo, poderão ser os principais factores responsáveis por essas 

diferenças na comunidade micorrízica. Os membros da família Glomeraceae possuem 

um micélio extra-radicular altamente infectivo que lhes permite uma rápida 

colonização radicular, enquanto os membros da família Gigasporaceae, visto serem 

apenas capazes de se propagarem via dispersão dos esporos apresentam uma taxa 

de colonização mais lenta. A densidade de esporos dos géneros Glomus, 

Acaulospora e Scutellospora assim como, a colonização radicular estiveram 

correlacionados com o nível de nutrientes do solo (N, K, Mg, Ca, MO), excepto com o 

fósforo (P). Os nossos resultados confirmam que, os benefícios resultantes da relação 

simbiótica dependem da espécie de planta hospedeira. Lolium perenne L. foi a planta 

que exibiu maior dependência micorrízica (DM= 62%) seguida de Holcus lanatus L. 

(DM= 40%), o que originou um incremento na biomassa foliar superior a 30 % em 

ambas as espécies de plantas. Contrariamente, Lolium multiflorum Lam. foi a espécie 

de planta com menor percentagem de colonização micorrizica, e por conseguinte a 

menos dependente da micorrização (DM= 27%).  

A inoculação com FMA nativos aumentou a tolerância de H. lanatus à infecção por 

Meloidogyne incognita em mais de 90 % das amostras. Entre os vários mecanismos 

propostos para explicar o efeito protector dos FMA, destaca-se o aumento no vigor da 

planta resultante da colonização micorrízica, e a competição por espaço e compostos 

fotossíntetizados que se estabelece entre o FMA e o nemátode. 

Com base neste estudo podemos concluir que: quer a diversidade de esporos de 

FMA, como a diversidade de FMA que colonizam as raízes de H. lanatus não 

dependem da intensidade do sistema de maneio; no entanto, nos sistemas intensivos 

há uma tendência para uma maior ocorrência de certos FMA, especialmente os 

pertencentes ao género Glomus, assistindo-se por conseguinte a uma potencial perda 



17 
 

da funcionalidade dos ecossistemas neste tipo de maneio do solo; a colonização das 

diferentes estruturas micorrízicas foi mais elevada nas pastagens semi-naturais, e 

exibiu uma marca sazonalidade relacionada com a fenologia e metabolismo de 

carbono da planta hospedeira, e com as condições climáticas. A inoculação com FMA 

nativos aumentou significativamente a produtividade das plantas e tolerância à 

infecção por nemátodos galhadores – M. incógnita, mas todavia depende da 

especificidade da planta hospedeira. Deste modo, os FMA poderão desempenhar um 

papel importante na funcionalidade dos ecossistemas, uma vez que o seu uso 

adequado poderá reduzir a aplicação de produtos químicos, bem como, os custos 

energéticos na agricultura e consequentemente conduzir a uma agricultura mais 

sustentável e económica.

General introduction 

In almost all terrestrial ecosystems mutualistic interactions between plants and 

microorganisms in the soil play a major role for the structure and dynamics of plant 

communities (van der Heijden et al. 1998). An important group of mutualists are 

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), an exceptional group of beneficial fungi. They are 

present in most soils and are capable of forming associations with the root systems of 

the great majority of plant species, where they act as bioregulators and protectors, and 

facilitate the uptake of mineral nutrients (Smith and Read, 1997).  

 

1.  The importance of soil microorganisms 

Much of the terrestrial biosphere lives in the soil (Brussaard et al., 1997). Although soil 

provides a physical substrate for almost all human activities, the study of soil biota 

remains relatively uncommon, especially in systems such as  conventional agriculture 

where soil is used exhaustively used (Whipps, 2001; Barea et al., 2005). This is 

inattention is partly to a lack of recognition of the role of soil biota on determining soil’s 

chemical and physical properties and potential productivity (Whipps, 2001; Barea et 

al., 2005). In addition, knowledge of soil microbial diversity is partly limited by 

taxonomic and methodological challenges associated with studying these organisms 

(Torsvik and Øvreås, 2002; Kirk et al., 2004). The soil organisms are not only 

inhabitants of the soil, but they are also integral parts of it; they influence such diverse 

properties as hydrology, aeration and gas composition. These factors can have a 

major effect on primary production through the decomposition of organic residuals 

(Brussaard et al., 1997). The current shift toward sustainable land use, has contributed 

to an increasing awareness of soil biota among the planet’s forms of life (Gianinazzi et 

al., 2008). Microorganisms’ activities in the so-called “rhizosphere” promote the 

establishment, development, nutrition and health of plants, and are mutually, enabled 

by physical and nutritional support from the exudates of roots (Barea and Jeffries, 

1995). 

There are three main groups of beneficial microorganisms in soil-plant systems, and 

these groups are considered key to the sustainability of agro-ecosystems, namely: 

mycorrhizal fungi, N2-fixing bacteria, and plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria 



Chapter I_____________    ________________________________________________________  ____

(PGPR). N2-fixing bacteria contribute to the symbiotic fixation of atmospheric N, which 

represent the essential access of nitrogen (N) in ecosystems (Barea and Olivares, 

1998). Rhizobacteria which colonise the rhizosphere, are distinguished by their effects 

in promoting plant rooting and the biogeochemical cycling of plant nutrients (Barea, 

1997). Mycorrhizal fungi are ubiquitous plant mutualists that comprise a large fraction 

of fungal biomass in the rhizosphere. These symbiotic organisms are found inside 

roots, in the rhizosphere itself and in the bulk soil, and they interact in all these zones 

with other organisms (Fitter and Garbaye, 1994; Azcón-Aguilar et al., 2002). The 

internal mycelium interacts principally with the root itself, though at the same time, it 

can interact with other organisms and even with pathogenic fungi. The AMF external 

mycelium developed in the soil improve plant’s nutrient and water uptake and, interact 

with many organisms, such as bacteria, other fungi, protozoa, nematodes, arthropods 

and even large animal such as mammals (Fitter and Garbaye, 1994; Azcón-Aguilar et 

al., 2002). In this  association, the obligate biotrophic fungi provides terrestrial plants 

with minerals, nutrients (particularly inorganic phosphate) and water, increasing the 

host resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, including pathogens, water limitation and 

environmental pollutants in exchange for photosynthates (Smith and Read, 1997).  

 

2.  Mycorrhizal fungi  

Among favourable plant-microbe interactions, the mycorrhizal symbiosis is now known 

to be an essential component of any plant community due to the beneficial role of fungi 

on plant growth and protection (Smith and Read, 1997). The term “mycorrhiza” was 

proposed for the first time in 1985 by the botanist A.B. Frank, to describe the peculiar 

association between tree roots and ectomycorrhizal fungi. It comes from the (Greek) 

mycos-rhiza, which means “fungus-root”. Fossil records from the Devonian of the first 

vascular plants show that arbuscular mycorrhizal associations were present in 

underground rhizomatous structures, confirming the presence of this mutualistic 

association at least 400 million years ago (Remy et al., 1994). Evidence that the first 

land plants already possessed this association suggests that their aquatic ancestors 

also harboured these fungi. Redecker et al. (2000) have documented spores from the 

Ordovician period (460 Ma) that are similar to present-day spores of Glomalean fungi, 

indicating that earlier associations with non-vascular plants were likely.

Mycorrhizal fungi are present in almost all terrestrial habitats from aquatic (Nielsen et 

al., 2004; Wolfe et al., 2006) ecosystems to deserts (Díez et al., 2002; Shi et al., 2007) 

tropical forests (Husband et al., 2002; Mangan et al., 2004), at high latitudes and 

altitudes (Allen, 1991). It has been estimated that mycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic 

associations with more than 85 % of plant species (Smith and Read, 1997). Only a few 

botanic families as Crucifereae, Ciperaceae, Poligonaceae, Juncaceae and 

Chenopodiaceae have non-mycorrhizal plant species (Brundrett, 2002; Peterson et al., 

2004). There is evidence that these nonmycotrophic groups may have mycorrhizal 

fungal invasions, though the physiological relationships are not well understood (Allen, 

1991; Peterson et al., 2004). 

Seven different categories of mycorrhizal symbiosis have been distinguished on the 

basis of their morphological characteristics and the fungal and plant species involved, 

namely: arbuscular mycorrhiza, ectomycorrhiza, ectendomycorrhiza, arbutoid 

mycorrhiza, monotropoid mycorrhiza, ericoid mycorrhiza and orchid mycorrhizas(Smith 

and Read, 1997; Peterson et al., 2004; Finlay, 2008). 

 

3. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 

 Arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) belong to the phylum Glomeromycota, and form 

association with most of land plants (about 80-90%) (Smith &amp;amp; Read, 1997). These 

fungi are obligate biotrophic symbionts, since they can only complete their life cycle in 

the presence of their host plant. The main morphological characteristic of these fungi 

is the repeated dichotomous branching as they penetrate the cortical cells of the root 

to form of arbuscules, highly branched tree-like structures typical of colonisation 

structures by these fungi. Initially, the fungus grows between the cortical cells, but it 

then rapidly penetrates the host cell wall of the host and develops inside the cortical 

cells. 

 In this type of association neither the cell walls of the fungus or the host cellular 

membrane are ruptured. As the fungus develops, the host cellular membrane 

invaginates and surrounds the fungus, forming a new compartment where material of 

high molecular complexity it is deposited (Bonfante &amp;amp; Perotto 1995).This apoplastic 

space prevents direct contact between the plant and the cytoplasm of the fungus, 

while allowing the transfer of nutrients between symbionts. Thus, arbuscules (Fig. 1)

are the main sites of metabolite exchange and the primary physiological structures of 

the symbiosis. They generally have a short life span (less than 15 days), after which 

they degenerate, returning the cell to normal activity (Smith and Smith, 1990).Other 

structures produced by some AMF include vesicles, auxiliary cells and asexual spores. 

Vesicles are globose, inter- or intracellular, between 30 to 100 mm in size and rich in 

lipids (Fig. 1). Their primary function is to reserve organs, however, they can also 

serve as reproductive propagules for the fungus.  

All arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi form arbuscules, but some such as Gigaspora spp. or 

Scutellospora spp., do not form vesicles. This observation underlies, the argument to 

change the designation of "vesicular–arbuscular mycorrhiza" to "arbuscular 

mycorrhiza" (Walker, 1995). AMF can produce auxiliary cells in the extraradical 

mycelium (Peterson et al. 2004; Smith &amp;amp; Read 1997). Auxiliary cells are initiated as 

lateral branches that rapidly expand into globose structures of varying colour and with 

ornamented walls. They can occur singly or in clusters. Auxiliary cells formed in the 

soil may be “nodulated” or “coiled”, and their function is unknown (Peterson et al., 

2004). Reproductive spores (Fig. 1) are produced on the extraradical hyphae, but they 

can also grow within the colonised roots, e.g. for Glomus intraradices, Glomus clarum 

and Glomus fasciculatum (Schenck &amp;amp; Smith 1982). Some AMF also form sporacarps 

or spore clusters (Redecker et al. 2007).

3.1 The AMF life cycle 

AMF are obligate biotrophs that live symbiotically in the roots of the host plants. For 

the establishment of the symbiosis, the key events in the life cycle of AMF are spore 

germination and the pre-symbiotic mycelial growth phase, differential hyphal 

branching, appressorium formation, root colonisation and arbuscule development 

(Giovannetti et al. 1994).  

Under favourable environmental conditions, the AMF spores germinate and the 

hyphae colonise susceptible roots (Smith and Read, 1997). AMF are able to 

distinguish their hosts from other species, both non-mycorrhizal or non-arbuscular 

mycorrhiza through chemical of signals emitted by the roots to the fungus. These 

signals promote a specific morphogenesis, of profuse hyphal branching and 

proliferation (Giovannetti et al. 1994). Among the compounds released in root 

exudates, flavonoids have been suggested to be involved in the stimulation of pre-

contact hypal growth and branching (Giovannetti and Sbrana, 1998). However, these 

compounds are not strictly necessary for the establishment of mycorrhizal symbiose 

(Bécard et al., 1995). Similar to the branching factors, which are produced by plants as 

a compatibility signal for the fungus, the branched fungal hyphae produced a diffusible 

signal to the roots (Kosuta et al. 2003). Thus, a “crosstalk” between the plant and the 

fungus is established. 

After the recognising the host plant root, the hyphae form appressoria on the root 

epidermis (the root hair or other epidermal cell). AMF penetrate the root surface by 

enzymatic activity or mechanical force (Bonfante and Perotto 1995). The entry of the 

fungus is assisted by the plant by the establishment of a special cytoskeletal 

arrangement, the prepenetration apparatus (Genre et al. 2005). The appressorium 

formation is followed by hyphal penetration of the cell lumen and proliferation of the 

intraradical hyphae in the upper cell layers of the root cortex. Furthermore, the hyphae 

enter the middle and inner cortex of the root. However, the fungus never enters 

meristems or vascular cylinders, perhaps because of its inability to degrade suberin 

and lignin in the endodermal cell walls (Bonfante and Perotto 1995). When growing 

inside fungi are always surrounded by the intact plasma membrane of the plant host. 

In the deeper cortical layers, the fungal hyphae may form arbuscules. As part of this 

intracellular development, the periarbuscular membrane where nutrient exchange 

occurs between the plant and the wall of the fungus, is formed from the plasma

membrane (Gianinazzi-Pearson, 1996). Once fungal colonisation has been 

established in the root, extensive growth of the extraradical mycelium (ERM) begins. 

This is well adapted to the exploration of soil pores, mineral nutrient uptake and 

association with soil particles and, thus, stabilisation of soil aggregates. The ERM 

forms a complex network, that can link the roots of plants of the same or different 

species (Smith and Read 1997). The life cycle of the AMF is completed by the 

formation of spores or sporocarps on the ERM or rarely inside the roots. 

 

3.2. Paris- and Arum- type colonisation 

There are three important components of any mycorrhizal root systems: the root itself 

and two associated mycelial systems, one within the root apoplast and the other in the 

soil (Brundrett, 2004). The two mycelial systems grow and develop in diverse 

environments: the first it is very constant through root homeostasis, and the second is 

highly variable. According to Gallaud (1905), depending on the species of plant, 

mycorrhizal colonisation can fall into one of two general anatomical groups, the Arum-

type and Paris-type (Figs. 2; 3).

In plants with Arum AMF associations (Fig. 2), the fungus spreads relatively rapidly in 

the root cortex via intercellular hyphae, which extend along well developed intercellular 

air spaces. Short side branches penetrate the cortical cells and branch dichotomously 

to produce characteristic arbuscules. Hyphal coils may be formed, particularly in the 

hypodermal (exodermal) cell layers of the root, but they are not usually a major 

component of the intraradical mycelium (Smith and Read, 1997; Brundrett, 2004). In 

contrast, in plants with Paris AMF associations (Fig. 3), colonisation of the roots is 

characterised by the extensive development of intracellular coiled hyphae that spread 

directly from cell to cell within the cortex. Arbuscules grow from these coils, and there 

is very little, if any, intercellular growth.  

The two AMF types differ not only in their morphology but also in the kinetics of root 

colonisation. The development of Paris-type colonisation within the root is much 

slower than in the Arum-type organism (Azcon- Aguilar et al. 1994). However, the two 

types of colonisation have similar metabolic activity. Whereas arbuscules appear to be 

the main site of P transfer to Arum-type (Ezawa et al., 2002), in the Paris-type, transfer 

might occur in both hyphal and arbuscular coils (Van Aarle et al., 2005) 

The type of AMF colonisation seems to be largely determined by the host plant 

genotype, as the same AMF species known to form the Arum-type in some host plant 

species, and produces the Paris-type in other (Demuth and Weber 1990; Sykorová et 

al. 2003; Ahulu et al. 2006).

3.3. Ecology of Arbuscular Mycorrhizae 

3.3.1. Host specificity 

The varying responses of plants to mycorrhizal infection have a profound impact on 

plant interactions and community structure. Depending on their response to 

mycorrhizal colonisation, plant species have been classified in three categories: 

obligate mycorrhizal, facultatively mycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal, if they have high, 

intermediate or variable or no level of mycorrhizal association, respectively (Brundrett 

and Abbott, 2002; Brundrett, 2004). Obligate mycorrhizal plants are defined as those 

that will not survive to reproductive maturity in their natural habitats without their 

mycorrhizal fungi, while facultatively mycorrhizal plants have intermediate 

associations, where the plant’s benefits are conditional on soil fertility.  

Experiments have shown that these plants benefit from AMF only when soil P levels 

are relatively low. These plants typically have relatively long, narrow and highly 

branched roots with long root hairs compared to obligately mycorrhizal species. 

Facultatively mycorrhizal plants apparently have the capacity to limit the extent of their 

associations to reduce costs in cases where fungi provide little benefit (Koide &amp;amp; 

Schreiner, 1992). Non-mycorrhizal plants have roots that are highly resistant to 

colonisation by mycorrhizal fungi and do not form functional associations (Brundrett, 

2002; Brundrett, 2004).  

The responsiveness of plants to mycorrhizal colonisation further varies between 

species and cultivars and is markedly influenced by nutrient supply. This 

responsiveness is frequently referred to as mycorrhizal dependency and expressed as 

the percentage difference in dry matter between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal 

plants grown in the same soil (Gerdemann, 1975). Responsiveness is strongly 

affected by both the capacity of the plant to absorb nutrients independently and its 

capacity to support a heterotrophic symbiont with 'excess' photosynthate are important 

and may be genetically and environmentally influenced (Read and Smith, 1997). 

Variation in mycorrhizal dependency among species, have potentially important 

applications to agroecosystem functioning and management.

3.3.2. Plant succession and mycorrhizal colonisation 

In natural ecosystems, unrelated plant species with different nutrient uptake strategies 

and different AMF responsiveness occur together. Experimental evidence suggests 

that warm-season perennial C4 grasses and perennial forbs are highly responsive to 

AMF colonisation (in terms of dry weight accumulation) and some even obligate 

mycorrhizal plants. Conversely, cool-season perennial C3 grasses and annual and 

biennial forbs are both less responsive and somewhat less colonised (Wilson and 

Hartnett, 1998). The responsive warm-season grasses normally have less fibrous root 

systems, lower specific root length and a more plastic architecture than cool-season 

grasses, and their degree of branching is reduced when they become colonised. All of 

these characters are regularly associated with high responsiveness. Annual and 

biennial species with lower responsiveness are often associated with disturbed 

patches where interspecific competition is relatively low. In these environments 

investment in finer roots with high turnover rates appears to be a more advantageous 

strategy. Plant with facultative AMF status can presumably overcome occasional 

nutrient deficiencies and competitive stresses (Smith and Read, 1997). 

AMF can thus influence the dominant plants in a community by mediating competition 

between plants of differing mycotrophy (Grime et al. 1987; Wilson and Hartnett 1998; 

van der Heijden et al. 1998; Hartnett and Wilson 1999; Eom et al. 2000; Hart et al., 

2003). This interaction can be extended to a model of succession where the 

mycotrophy of dominant plants changes as the community develops (Johnson et al. 

1991).  

During primary succession only non-mycorrhizal pioneer plants can colonise, due to 

the lack of AMF propagules which gives the advantage to these plants (Janos, 1980). 

During this time of dominance by non-mycorrhizal plants, succession may be slowed 

or completely arrested until the establishment of facultatively mycorrhizal plants begins 

to build a community of AMF. This period paves the way for the establishment of 

obligately mycorrhizal plants, which eventually dominate the community (Gemma and 

Koske1997). In this way, the mycotrophy of the dominant plants can be used to 

indicate the successional trajectory of a community (Reeves et al., 1979).  

There is evidence that AMF mediated sharing of nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and 

phosphorus) allows the survival of subordinate seedlings that act as nutrient sinks to

the dominant source plants (Grime et al. 1987). It has also been suggested that 

invasive plants can act as parasites, using the web of AMF to draw resources from 

native vegetation (Marler et al. 1999). Whatever the case, it is clear that AMF affect 

competition and thereby influence the level of diversity found in plant communities. 

Plant diversity can either be increased or decreased by the presence of AMF 

depending on the mycotrophy of the dominant species. Smith et al. (1999) reported 

that removal of the dominant warm-season C4 grass species in a tall prairie, which 

exhibits high mycorrhizal responsiveness, increased plant diversity once the 

abundance of the dominant species declined in number, and subdominant cool-

season C3 grass and forb species increased in abundance. To generalize, increased 

diversity and spatial heterogeneity of AMF will increase the diversity of plants when a 

variation in host plant mycotrophy is present (van der Heijden et al. 1998; Hartnett and 

Wilson 2002). The diversity of AMF is affected by the diversity of the plant community 

(Eom et al. 2000). Monocultures of mycorrhizal plants may have lower AMF diversity 

than communities dominated by nonmycorrhizal plants (Johnson et al. 2004). While 

this pattern may seem counterintuitive at first, it is analogous to the situation where 

AMF increase the competitive dominance of mycorrhizal plants in tall grass prairies 

and, thereby reduce the overall diversity of the plant community. The successional 

status of the plant community also dramatically impacts AMF communities, with AMF 

diversity increasing along the successional gradient (Koske and Gemma 1997). 

Following the change in the level of diversity, there is a change in species 

composition, with a different group of AMF species represented in early and late 

successional communities (Johnson et al. 1991). The endomycorrhizal relationship is 

truly a two-way street; it is still unclear whether the AMF is the driver or the passenger 

in this relationship, or whether this distinction can be made (Hart et al. 2001). 

 

3.4. Genetics of AMF 

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are obligate symbionts, and then only complete its life 

when associated to a compatible host. These fungi have an aseptate network 

(cenotytic) that enables them a quick drive cytoplasmic, facilitating the uptake of 

nutrients belonging to the depletion zone. Compared to others fungi, AMF have bigger 

spores, ranging between 22 and 1050 µm (Schüßler et al., 1994).

Depending of the species, these spores may have hundreds or thousands of nuclei 

(Bever and Morton, 1999; Pawlowska and Taylor, 2004). Hijri and Sanders (2005) 

characterised the size, complexity and ploidy of the genome of a strain of Glomus 

intraradices. Their results indicate this AMF is haploid and has a small genome of 

approximately 16.54 Mb, which is at the lower limit of eukaryotic genomes. However, it 

is important to emphasise that other glomeromycota showed genome larger than that 

of G. intraradices; like Gigaspora margarita has three times higher more nuclear 

content than Glomus versiforme (Bianciotto and Bonfante, 1992). Such differences in 

genome size probably reflect differences in ploidy in addition to the, amount of 

repetitive sequences. 

Glomeromycota probably follow an asexual reproductive cycle (i.e., clonal 

reproduction) by spore formation or by formation of a coenocytic (multinucleate) hypal 

network. Only one case of sexual reproduction has been reported in Gigaspora 

decipiens (Tommerup and Sivasitham, 1990), but never was truly confirmed. There is 

evidence of recombination among the Glomeromycota (Vandenkoornhuyse, 2001; 

LoBuglio and Taylor, 2002; Pawloska 2005). Molecular evidence suggests AMF is 

haploid but there is some controversy about whether their genome structures is homo- 

or heterokaryotic. Two basic organizational structures have been advocated. First, it is 

possible that all intra-cellular variation is present within individual nuclei and all of the 

nuclei within a cell are identical, i.e., homokaryosis (Pawlowska and Taylor 2004; 

Pawloska 2005). Alternatively, much of the genetic variation may be distributed 

between nuclei, with each cell containing multiple genomes, i.e., heterokaryosis (Bever 

and Morton 1999; Hijri and Sanders, 2005). These two scenarios have very different 

implications for our understanding of the inheritance and maintenance of genetic 

variation and maintenance of this genetic variation in AMF.  

Pawloska (2005) argued that according to non- Mendelian genetic systems and, based 

on the heterokaryotic character of Glomeromycota (Sanders, 2002), these fungi must 

have developed a nuclear recombination process, identical to the first steps of the 

parasexual cycle. The parasexual cycle is characterised by occurrence of 

anastomoses followed by nuclear change among species or individual genetically 

different, but with vegetative compatibility. Initially, the parasexual cycle leads to 

heterokaryosis. However, heterokaryosis is an unstable condition; distinct nuclei fuse, 

resulting in a diploid nucleus that, may suffer chromosomal losses. These losses 



Chapter I_____________    ________________________________________________________  ____             
   

32 
 

cause a return to haploid status (Schardl and Craven, 2003), and consequent to the 

homokaryosis.  

The genetic structure of AMF is currently a topic of intense discussion. Further 

investigation is necessary to understand the mechanisms by which different genetic 

features shape the ecology, evolution and symbiotic efficiency of the Glomeromycota. 

 

4. Arbuscular mycorrhiza: 

4.1. Nutritional benefits 

Some of the most interesting and important questions about mycorrhizae concern the 

nutritional benefits that these symbioses confer to each participant. The symbiosis 

between AMF and autotrophic plants is generally regarded as mutualistic; the 

mutualism assumed as the bidirectional transfer of nutrients. With the exception of a 

few achlorophyllous species, AM host plants are autotrophic and, although normally 

colonised by mycorrhizal fungi in the field, they are usually capable of satisfactory 

growth in the absence of colonisation, if mineral nutrient supplies are adequate. In 

contrast, AMF do not complete their life cycle in the absence of symbiosis with a host 

root. This limitation gives some insight into the role of AMF and their contribution to 

nutrient absorption (Smith and Read, 1997). In the absence of a host root, AMF germ-

tubes stop growing and do not produce new resting spores, even when large number 

of carbon (C) forms is added to the culture medium. One proposed explanation is that 

AMF experiences a failure or deficiency of the C metabolism in the asymbiotic state 

thus, understanding C metabolism in this stage of AMF development is of potential 

practical importance (Pfeffer et al., 1999; Bago et al., 2000). In the symbiotic 

interaction, the fungus enters the inner cortical root cells to form specialised haustoria 

called arbuscules. There is increasing evidence that phosphate, translocated from the 

soil through the fungus, is deposited at the arbuscular interface, where it is taken up by 

plant transporters. However, little is known about where the exchange of carbon takes 

place (Pfeffer et al., 2001; Requena et al., 2003). 

The assimilate transfer includes sucrose breakdown into glucose and fructose, their 

export across the plant plasma membrane and their active uptake by hexose 

transporters across the fungal plasma membrane, driven by an increased H+ -ATPase 



                                                                                                                                                                        Chapter I 

33 
 

activity at the arbuscular membrane (Gianinazzi-Pearson et al. 2000). The function of 

H+ -ATPase is to generate the proton electrochemical gradient across the plasma 

membrane that is required for effective cellular function. The, enzyme thus provides 

the driving force for the uptake and efflux of ions and metabolites through an interface 

otherwise impermeable to them and allows for the regulation of intracellular pH 

(Requena et al., 2003). The exchange of metabolites and ions across the plasma 

membrane is particularly important at the symbiotic mycorrhizal interface because it 

enables the control of exchanged nutrients between the soil, fungus and plant 

“compartments.” This exchanges maintains the equilibrium that defines the association 

as mutualistic and not as parasitic. In plants, H+ -ATPase is encoded by a large 

multigene family (Gianinazzi-Pearson et al. 2000; Ferrol et al., 2002; Ezawa et al., 

2005) and may be recruited at different developmental stages to respond to the 

different requirements of symbiosis (Requena et al., 2003). 

In the fungal cytosol, the hexoses are converted into triacylglycerides or, amino acids 

or incorporated into glycogen pools. The major storage forms of carbon in spores and 

hyphae are lipids, trehalose and glycogen (Pfeffer et al. 1999). 

Hyphae from colonised roots extend into the soil and aid root hairs in absorbing water 

and mineral nutrients. AMF are recognised for their ability to stimulate plant growth via 

enhanced uptake of phosphate despite its low mobility and availability in soil, and they 

thus play important roles in the terrestrial phosphorus cycle (Ezawa et al., 2002). In the 

symbiotic phase, AMF take up inorganic phosphate (Pi) from the soil through fungal 

phosphate transporters, which in an extensive network of extraradical hyphae is 

rapidly converted into inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) and transported into the 

intraradical hyphae (Ezawa et al., 2004). In the arbuscules, polyphosphate is 

hydrolysed by enhanced phosphatase activity and released into the periarbuscular 

space (Ohtomo and Saito 2005). Phosphate is then taken up by the plant through a 

transmembrane transporter. As with carbon, the uptake of phosphate and other 

nutrients by arbuscular plant cells may be linked to the high plant and fungal H+- 

ATPase activity observed at the periarbuscular membrane (Gianinazzi-Pearson et al. 

2000). Although most of the nutrient transfer between the two symbiotic partners takes 

place in the arbuscules, they do not seem to be the sole site of nutrient exchange (Van 

Aarle et al., 2005).

4.2. Other beneficial features  

 This symbiosis is characterised by the bidirectional flow of nutrients. The plant 

through the compounds photosynthates promotes the growth and reproduction of the 

fungus. In turn, the fungus enhances the uptake of water and nutrients, especially 

immobile nutrients like phosphorus that are present beyond the depleted zones that 

develop around plant roots (Allen, 1991; Smith &amp;amp; Read, 1997).  

However these fungi can also provide many other benefits to the host including: 

increased resistance to foliar-feeding insects through a reduction in the palatability of 

plant tissues, alteration in nutritional quality, or increase in the concentrations or types 

of defence compounds in the plant tissue (Gange and Weast, 1994; Master and 

Brown, 1997; Borowicz, 1997; Gange et al., 1999; Goverde et al., 2000; Wearn and 

Gange, 2007). AMF colonisation may also lead to an increased in overall plant fitness 

and resistance against nematodes (de la Peña et al., 2006; Rodriguez-Romero et al., 

2005; Rodriguez-Echeverria et al., 2009) and pathogens (Smith et al., 1999; 

Klironomos et al., 2000; Idoia et al., 2004). These effects can, to a certain extent, 

reduce the need for pesticides and other synthetic chemical in agricultural practices. 

AMF also improves crops’ tolerance of abiotic stresses, such as drought (Augé et al., 

2001). The resistance to water stress is likely associated with the extraradical network 

of hyphae which are far more resistant to drought than fine roots and can resume 

growth immediately after drought conditions cease (Miller et al., 1995). AMF can also 

increase tolerance to salinity and heavy metals (Al-Karaki et al., 2001; Mohammad et 

al., 2003). Furthermore, AMF contributes to soil aggregation not only through the 

development of hyphal network builds into a macroporous structure that facilities 

circulation of water and air and prevents erosion but also through the action of 

glomalin, a glycoprotein produced AMF (Rilling et al., 2003; Piotrowski et al., 2004; 

Cavagnaro et al., 2006; van der Heijden et al., 2006). Another important role of AMF is 

their contribution as drivers of plant community composition (Grime et al., 1997; 

Wilson and Hartnett, 1997; van der Heijden et al., 1998; Hartnett and Wilson, 1999).

5. Identification, systematic, phylogeny and diversity of the Glomeromycota 

5.1. Systematics and phylogeny of the Glomeromycota 

Before 1974, most of AMF were included in the genus Endogone, until Gerdemann 

and Trappe (1974) placed them in four different genera in the order Endogonales: 

Glomus, Sclerocystic, Gigaspora and Acaulospora. Previously, AMF had been 

assigned to the order Glomales, which included six genera and in the phylum 

Zygomycota (Morton and Benny 1990). The Zygomycota is no longer accepted as a 

monophyletic clade. However, based on their obligate symbiotic habit, the apparent 

lack of zygospores (i.e., spore produced through the conjugation of specialised hyphae 

during sexual reproduction) and the DNA ribosomal (rDNA) phylogeny, Schü?ler et al. 

(2001) defined the phylum Glomeromycota as a sister clade of Basidiomycota and 

Ascomycota. Glomeromycota currently comprises approximately 200 described 

species distributed among ten genera, most of which were defined primarily based on 

the morphology of their spores or spore-bearing structures 

(http://www.lrz.de/~schuessler/amphylo/).  

Recently, DNA sequences have also been used to describe some AMF taxa and their 

phylogenetic relationships (e.g. Schwarzott et al. 2001; Redecker and Raab 2006). 

However, the possible sequence variation within individuals makes it difficult to 

interpret molecular community data when sequences are obtained from colonised 

plant roots, especially when studies were made on organisms that were not well 

characterised and correctly identified. As a result, about half of the described species 

are not actually known from their molecular characters, and some are barely known 

from morphology because of very poor descriptions and lack of definable type material 

(C. Walker personal communication). Hence, a conservative approach in the 

evaluation of phylogenetic analyses is advisable; e.g. such as defining a monophyletic, 

well-supported sequence cluster as an AMF phylotype (i.e., sequence type). Presently, 

the phylogeny of all genera of AMF is largely based on analyses of small subunit of the 

ribosomal DNA gene (SSU rDNA). Although additional genes have begun to be 

sequenced from some taxa (e.g. Helgason et al. 2003; Corradi et al. 2004; Redecker 

and Raab 2006), phylogenetic hypotheses based on multilocus DNA sequence data 

have yet to be incorporated into the AMF classification. Four orders, containing nine 

families and fourteen genera have been described within the Glomeromycota (Figs. 4).

The largest genus within this phylum, Glomus, was originally defined by spore 

morphology and formation and was later revealed by molecular data to be polyphyletic 

(Schwarzott et al. 2001). Therefore, this genus was divided into the following five 

genera: Glomus, Paraglomus, Archaeospora (Morton and Redecker 2001), Pacispora 

(Oehl and Sieverding 2004) and Diversispora (Walker and Schübler. 2004).  

Schwarzott et al. (2001) further analysed this largest genus of the AMF and 

established a new family structure by dividing the remaining Glomeraceae into the 

Diversisporaceae and Glomeraceae. The Glomeraceae family contain the subgroups 

“Glomus group A” (including e.g., G. intraradices, G. proliferum, G. clarum and G. 

mosseae; Fig. 5) whose members are the dominant and most diverse AMF in many 

field sites (Öpik et al. 2006), and “Glomus group B” (including e.g., G. claroideum, G. 

etunicatum G. lamellosum; see Fig. 5) whose members are difficult to distinguish

(Rodriguez et al. 2005). These two subgroups form two clades, that are separated 

phylogenetically by a distance equal to that found between others families (Fig.5). 

 

 

 

 

 

A further change was the establishment of the Ambisporaceae within the paraphyletic 

genus Archaeospora, while the family Archaeosporaceae was maintained with its type 

species (Walker et al. 2007). A new family Entrophosporaceae, was established 

(Sieverding and Oehl 2006), but its phylogenetic position is unclear. It is not included 

in the phylogenetic tree implementing the most recent phylogenetic analysis of the 

Glomeromycota (Fig. 4). Other recently erected families and genera have arisen from 

the by splitting of the Gigasporaceae (Oehl et al. 2008); their status is strongly debated 

in the scientific community (Morton &amp;amp; Msiska in press) and they are not included Fig.

Several AMF genera share morphological spore features, which are easy to observe 

but might represent plesiomorphic characters (e.g., the mode of spore formation; 

Redecker &amp;amp; Raab 2006). Therefore, detailed microscopic analyses are required for the 

identification of anatomical subtleties, such as spore wall layers. 

Spore formation has been an important criterion for the identification of genera. 

Members of Glomus (Berch and Fortin 1984), Pacispora (Oehl and Sieverding 2004), 

Diversispora (Walker and Schü?ler 2004), Ambispora (Walker et al. 2007) and 

Paraglomus (Morton and Redecker 2001) develop spores by blastic expansion of a 

hyphal tip (glomoid spores). However in Ambispora, a second spore type occurs (even 

within the same “dimorphic” species) that is typical of Acaulospora (Gerdemann and 

Trappe 1974) and Archaeospora (A. trappei; Morton and Redecker 2001); a 

sporiferous saccule forms blastically at the hyphal tip, and the acaulosporoid spore is 

develops at the “saccule neck” (the side of the subtending hypha). Entrophospora 

(Ames &amp;amp; Schneider 1979) develops spores directly from the saccule neck, not laterally 

but within the subtending hypha (the entrophosporoid mode of spore formation). The 

fourth, gigasporoid, type of spore formation characterises both Gigaspora (Gerdemann 

and Trappe 1974) and Scutellospora (Walker and Sanders 1986). Spores are formed 

from a morphologically specialised bulbous base (25-50 ?m in size) that is continuous 

with the structural spore wall. 

Other distinguishing characteristics besides of spores are the presence or absence of 

flexible inner walls and type of germination, which occurs through the hyphal 

attachment (e.g. Glomus) or through the spore wall. In the latter mode of germination, 

germ tubes can arise from i) a germination orb (Pacispora);  ii) a germination shield 

(Scutellospora) a structure that is occurs before spores germinate by penetrating the 

spore wall; or iii) a warty layer, typical for Gigaspora. The mode in which the spore is 

formed on the hypha ("mode of spore formation") has been an important criteria for 

defining genera and families; the number of walls, the structure of their layers and 

ornamentation have been used to distinguish species (Walker, 1983). Although these 

characteristics may be specific, they can differ according to environmental conditions 

and by the stage of the spore. Aged, dry or decaying spores can look different, even if 

they belong to the same species. However, many of these characteristics are just 

generic or significant only at the higher level, such as family (C. Walker personal 

communication). Moreover, it is quite difficult and requires expert knowledge to 



                                                                                                                                                                        Chapter I

distinguish and classify spores by their morphology, and, there is no coherent systems 

that allows the non-taxonomist to determine species with accuracy (C. Walker, 

personal communication). 

Geosiphon pyriformis is a glomeromycotan species belonging to the order 

Archaeosporales. It is the only fungus in the Glomeromycota currently known to form a 

symbiosis with a cyanobacterium: it produces bladders that harbor symbiotic Nostoc 

punctiforme (Schü?ler et al. 1994). Despite its different morphology and life strategy, 

molecular phylogenetic analysis has shown that Geosiphon is a member of the 

Glomeromycota (Schwarzott et al. 2001). 

 

6. Methods for AMF identification 

6.1. Morphological methods  

Breakthroughs in AMF taxonomy were obtained after the taxonomic reviewed of 

Endogonaceae by Gerdemann and Tappe (1974). These authors not only restructured 

the relationships of genus and family but also established a basis for species 

identification and description. Previously to identify AMF such characteristics as 

presence of a subtending hypha, colour, diameter, and the presence of inner walls 

were used. However, Walker (1983) introduced the concept of “murographs” to 

describe and compare the layered structure of spore walls more easily. Thereafter, the 

descriptions of new AMF followed this methodology, but when they did not easily fit the 

“murographs” concept, the new AMF species found were described by others authors 

(Morton 1986; Walker, 1986; Spain et al., 1989). The AMF identification is still based 

on the patterns described by Walker (1983). Morton (1988) extensively reviewed the 

concepts and characters used in AMF identification. The way the spore is formed on 

the hypha has been an important criterion with which to circumscribe genera and 

families, and the layered structure of the spore walls is used to distinguish species. 

However, despite the progress in AMF taxonomy, many species were described 

before the formulation of these traditional taxonomic concepts; thus, additional 

description of these taxa is necessary to decrease the challenges of found on 

identification (Walker, 1992). 



Chapter I_____________    ________________________________________________________  ____             
   

40 
 

A new model of AMF description based on spore ontogeny was proposed (Franke and 

Morton, 1994; Bentivenga and Morton, 1995; Morton, 1995; Stürmer and Morton, 

1997; 1999). According to this model, the wall of the spore is divided into two main 

groups:  the “structural wall” and “germinal wall”, and each group bis subdivided into 

layers. Despite its complexity, the ontogenic method is more coherent and logical. In 

addition, the morphology of the spore, and the vegetative structures, can be used on 

the family identification of some genera. However, traditional studies on AMF have 

showed methodological limitations. Taxonomic identification of AMF spores collected 

directly from the field is quite difficult because they are often unidentifiable due to 

degradation or parasitism by other organism. AMF are obligate symbionts, thus they 

cannot be cultivated in the absence of their host. Catch plants are often used to 

produce identifiable spores (Bever et al., 2001). Although useful for the isolation and 

propagation of some AMF species, this indirect culture strategy is time-consuming. It 

also introduces biases by plant preferences for particular AMF species, different 

growth conditions and other environmental factors. These limitation hinder its 

suitability in characterising AMF communities (Jansa et al., 2002; Oehl et al., 2003). 

Furthermore, mycorrhizal root colonisation and spore numbers (Clapp et al. 1995) 

might not reflect AMF populations in the soils, but only the sporulation stage of the 

AMF life cycle (a dormant phase) rather than activity within a symbiosis. This result of 

the fact that not all AMF present as spores form active mycorrhizas and many taxa 

present in the roots may not be sporulating. Moreover, fungal spore diversity differs 

seasonally, with some fungi sporulating in late spring and others at the end of summer. 

In most cases, taxonomic identification to the species level thus requires a very 

experienced investigator. 

However, an advantage of analysing spore numbers and morphology is that they can 

indicate over longer time periods (e.g., over months) the structures of the AMF 

community (Douds and Millner,1999; Oehl et al. 2003) with the exception of putative 

non-sporulating AMF species. Additionally, extracting spores from the soil can be done 

rapidly, and it may reveal taxa not easily detected by molecular methods, and provided 

the user has reasonable taxonomic expertise. Intensive soil sampling, including the 

use of successive trap culturing, typically takes much longer but reveals significantly 

greater diversity than ‘one-off’ methods of spore extraction (Oehl et al., 2004).

6.2. Molecular methods  

Molecular methods allow the AMF to be identified in the host plant roots or directly in 

the soil. However, because Glomeromycota are obligate symbionts, it is difficult or 

even impossible to obtain their pure biomass, which is necessary for the development 

of molecular markers. Only some AMF can be cultivated in sterile conditions using 

transformed plant roots (Fortin et al. 2002), while others must be cultivated in non-

sterile greenhouse pot cultures (Oehl et al. 2005) or are probably completely non-

cultivable or non-sporulating. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that AMF spores 

or sporocarps from filed or trap cultures can host numerous non-Glomeromycotans 

including other fungi and bacteria (Hijri et al., 2002).  

Molecular markers have been employed to characterise AMF communities genetically. 

Molecular markers include: i) analysis of isoenzymes (Sander et al., 1992); ii) and; 

analysis of the genomic profile of the rDNA (ribosomal DNA) (White et al., 1990; 

Lanfranco et al., 2001) and mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) (Bruns et al., 1991). Most 

molecular research investigating AMF identification and detection at species and 

isolate level has used techniques based on PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), which 

allow the characterisation of nucleic acids from small amounts of fungal DNA (White et 

al., 1990). These molecular techniques include: RAPD (Random Amplified 

Polymorphic DNA) (Wyss and Bonfante, 1993), RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length 

Polymorphism) (Sanders et al., 1995; Helgason et al., 1998; Redecker, 2000; Appoloni 

et al., 2008), DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) (Kowalchuk et al., 

2002; Ma et al., 2005; Santos et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2007) and qRT-PCR 

(Quantitative real-time PCR) (Alkan et al., 2004; 2006; Jansa et al., 2008). 

All molecular tools described above have proven to be useful tools for characterizing 

the AMF community, and in the future they could be combined with avaible 

morphological tools to yield a better understanding of AMF community structure 

(Redecker et al., 2003). However, these molecular tools are costly and time-

consuming, and they lack sufficient sensitivity to quantify AMF (Oehl et al., 2004; 

Egerton-Warburton et al., 2007). Hijri et al. (2006) noted that not all AMF taxa present 

as spores were detected in roots by PCR, probably because not all taxa were 

symbiotically active at the time or because they colonised the roots at levels below the 

detection threshold. There is, still uncertainty as to whether there are other AMF 

present that remain undetected because they are occur infrequently in intraradical 



Chapter I_____________    ________________________________________________________  ____             
   

42 
 

structures, or if there are other reasons why techniques still partly fail (Oehl et al., 

2004; 2010). 

 

6.2.1. Marker genes for AMF community studies 

Since Clapp et al. (1995) initiated field studies using molecular tools, several different 

molecular markers have been developed; improvements are still nede and in 

development. Target genes are the nuclear-encoded small subunit (SSU) ribosomal 

RNA sequences (Helgason et al. 1998), and the large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA 

sequences (Van Tuinen et al., 1998; Kjøller and Rosendahl 2000; Wu et al. 2007). The 

polymorphism of the latter is higher and, LSU is therefore more suitable for the 

development of group-specific primers (Rosendahl 2008; Robinson-Boyer et al. 2009). 

The first designed AMF-specific-primer, the VANS1 primer for the 5’ end of the SSU 

(Simon et al,. 1992), does not amplify all glomeromycotan lineages (Clapp et al., 

1995). Helgason et al. (1998) designed the AM1 primer, which in combination with the 

universal primer NS31 amplifies the variable central region of the SSU. However, it 

does not amplify this region in Archaeosporaceae, Paraglomeraceae or Glomus group 

B. 

In another approach, Lee et al. (2008) developed the primer pair AML1/AML2 which 

targets the SSU and claimed that this marker detects all published AMF sequences in 

this gene region except for Archaeospora trappei. Generally, the resolution of 

phylotypes from this gene region is lower than in approaches using internal transcribed 

spacers (ITS). Several markers targeting the ITS have been developed and applied in 

field studies. For example, Renker et al. (2003) used a nested PCR for the ITS with an 

intermediate restriction digest, designed to prevent the amplification of other fungi than 

AMF that contain the restriction site. However, in a later publication, these authors 

clarified that the restriction digest misses certain AMF species in the detection 

procedure (Hempel et al. 2007).  

Furthermore, this method amplified yeast species relatively frequently, which 

paradoxically allowed investigation of the biodiversity of basidiomycete yeasts 

inhabiting AMF-colonised roots or AMF spores (Renker et al. 2004). Other authors 

have constructed primers targeting the LSU of rDNA (Kjoller and Rosendahl 2000; 



                                                                                                                                                                        Chapter I 

43 
 

Gollotte et al. 2004). Similar to the AM1/NS31 primer pair, these primers also amplify 

only a subset of the Glomeromycotan taxa. 

To reduce the risk of missing AMF species in plant roots, Redecker (2000) developed 

group-specific nested PCR approaches for the SSU-ITS, covering all families of the 

Glomeromycota. Like the approach of Renker et al. (2003), this method was applied in 

several studies (Wubet et al., 2003; Hijri et al. 2006; Appoloni et al., 2008). Öpik et al. 

(2006) and Robinson-Boyer et al. (2009) summarised several of these studies using 

different target genes mentioned so far. It is obvious that all of these approaches have 

their advantages and disadvantages. The best approach depends on the scientific 

aim, e.g., if a resolution on the genus or species level is required.  

Recently, Krüger et al. (2009) developed a nested PCR approach to overcome several 

of these problems. To avoid the need for several PCR reactions to detect all members 

of the Glomeromycota, mixed primer sets were used in the same reaction and 

successfully tested against several members of AMF families spanning the whole 

phylum. The target fragment includes all ribosomal gene regions that have been 

broadly used in other studies, resulting in approximately 1800 bp in the first and 1500 

bp in the second PCR. Therefore, this approach permits comparison with previous 

studies on the same taxonomic level. In particular, the SSU fragment allows broad 

phylogenetic analyses, as this gene region exists in the majority of different AMF taxa 

(Rosendahl 2008). The ITS region allows resolution to the species level. However, his 

approach has still to be tested intensively under field conditions as possible primer 

matches have been found in other fungi and plants, even though no misamplifications 

were observed in few initially tested environmental samples (Krüger et al., 2009).  

The approach of Krüger et al. (2009) might lead to considerable sequence information 

about many unknown AMF taxa from various environments.  

 

7. AMF and Agriculture 

Agricultural practices have dramatic impacts on soil and soil organisms, and AMF are 

no exception. Several studies have shown that agriculture reduces the diversity of the 

AMF community (Helgason et al. 1998; Daniell et al. 2001; Oehl et al. 2003). This 

reduction has been attributed to physical disturbance from tilling (Kabir et al., 1997; 



Chapter I_____________    ________________________________________________________  ____             
   

44 
 

Jansa et al., 2003), the effects of supplemental fertilisers (Linderman and Davis 2004) 

and the use of fungicides and soil fumigants (Menge 1982).Tillage has been shown to 

have a significant influence on AMF colonisation (Douds and Miller, 2000; Jansa et al., 

2003; Schalamuck et al., 2006; Garcia et al., 2007). The extra-radical network of AMF 

mycelium functions as both the nutrient absorbing organ of mycorrhizae and as 

inocula for the colonisation of new roots. Thus, disruption caused by tillage can result 

in delayed or reduced root colonisation, and a decrease in the soil volume exploited by 

the AMF which may affect nutrient uptake by mycorrhizae (Evans and Miller, 1990; 

Boddington and Dodd, 2000). Moreover, tilling transports hyphae and colonised root 

fragments to the upper soil layer, decreasing and diluting their activity as viable 

propagules for subsequent crops. A potentially opposing effect is that phosphorus (P) 

uptake is generally increased with tillage, due partly to an improved distribution of P 

and increased P availability (Borie et al., 2006; Garcia et al., 2007). Not only 

agricultural practices such as tilling and fertilising cause a decline in AMF diversity; but 

there is also substantial evidence that they produce a shift in the composition AMF 

community (Boddington and Dodd 2000; Egerton-Warburton and Allen 2000; Jansa et 

al., 2003). Evidences suggests a homogenisation of AMF community structures under 

high-input fertiliser systems, which tend to be dominated by generalist AMF species 

such as Glomus, due to their large ecological plasticity to support disturbed systems. 

This plasticity could be related to differences in propagative units between the 

glomalean families (Hart and Reader, 2002; Jansa et al., 2003; Castillo et al., 2006). 

Conversely, the non-Glomus species have a tendency to inhabit niches characterised 

as specialist as they are only present in specific soil types preferentially organic soils 

(Oehl et al., 2010). 

However, these agriculturally adapted AMF have been shown to be slower to infect, 

faster to sporulate, and to produces fewer arbuscules (Johnson 1993; Scullion et al., 

1998; Oehl et al., 2003). These findings all suggest that the altered AMF community is 

draw more resources from the plant while providing less in return. The ramifications of 

these altered AMF communities may not be especially great as long as the field is kept 

under agricultural production. 

Soil types differ in their soil chemical and physical characteristics. It has been well 

documented that pH (Ezawa et al., 20001; Oehl et al., 2010), nitrogen (N) (Jonhson et 

al., 2003; Egerton-Warburton et al., 2007) organic matter (OM) (Boddington and Dodd 



                                                                                                                                                                        Chapter I 

45 
 

2000) and soil phosphorus (P) availability (Oehl et al., 2004) influence the composition 

of AMF communities. An extreme pH (Clark et al., 1999; Ezawa et al., 2001; Khanam 

et al., 2006) may also create conditions in which AMF confers for little or no benefit to 

the host plant. Some AMF species (e.g., Glomus) prefer alkaline and neutral soil, while 

others (e.g., Acaulospora) sporulate more abundant in acid soils (Gai and Li, 2003). 

Also Oehl et al. (2010) reported that pH had a strong influence on AMF species genus 

and on the relative density of Glomus species. In addition to affecting plant 

performance, these factors also influence the host’s plant dependency on AM 

symbiosis and the level of root colonisation.  

Grazing has also been found to dramatically reduce AMF colonisation and spore 

density (Gange et al., 1993; Gehring et al., 1994; Lugo and Cabello, 2002; Dhillion and 

Gardsjord, 2004). This trend may be due to a decrease in leaf area and an increase in 

root/shoot ratio resulting in a decreased source capacity to satisfy root and AM fungi 

sink demands. 

 

8. Study areas 

8.1.1. Island overview 

This study was conducted in the Terceira Island, the third island of the Azorean 

archipelago in terms of size (402 km2). Terceira is a roundish island formed by four 

main volcanic complexes (Serra de Santa Bárbara, Serra do Morião, Pico Alto and 

Serra do Cume) (Zbyszewski et al., 1971). The highest point (Serra de S. Bárbara, 

1023 m) is simultaneously the most recent of the three major island’s complexes of 

0.025 Ma B.P. (Martins, 1993). The eastern flatted part of the island is its older part of 

about 3.52 My (Borges et al., 2009). Recent historical volcanic activity is evident in the 

western part of the island, where several well preserved lava tubes and volcanic 

chimneys are present (Borges et al., 1993). The Azores archipelago have a temperate 

oceanic climate characterised by high levels of relative atmospheric humidity that 

could reach 95% at high altitude native forests and ensures slight thermal variations 

throughout the year (Azevedo et al., 1999). The average temperature is 17.5° C in low 

altitudes, while the maximum temperature is in August and minimum in February 

(Azevedo, 1996). The pluviometric regime reaches its peak in January-February and 

minimum and July (Azevedo, 1996): Angra do Heroísmo (47 m): 969 mm year (140

mm in January and 40 mm in July) and Serra de S. Bárbara (1,023 m): 3,000 mm year 

(Borges, 1997).  

 

8.1.2. Studied pastures 

The sampling areas were cattle-grazed upland pastures of two different types: semi-

natural pastures (managed for more than 50 years, with a higher diversity of grasses 

and forbs; see Borges and Brown 2001) and intensive pastures (managed for more 

than 20 years, characterised also by a poor vascular flora of five or less dominant 

species).The semi-natural pastures are included in a site of communitarian interest 

(SIC- Serra de Santa Barbara e Pico Alto) inside of Rede Natura 2000: Pico Galhardo 

(PX) (Latitude 38º 41’ 51.71’’ N; Longitude 27º 13’ 25.34’’ W) and Terra Brava (TB) 

(Latitude 38º 41’ 59.74’’ N; Longitude 27º 12’ 41.37’’ W) (Fig. 6). 

These pastures show a high floristic diversity, and they are dominated by the grasses 

Holcus lanatus and Agrostis castellana, perennial grasses that covers around 100% of 

sites (Dias, 1996; Borges, 1997). Frequently present in these pastures are also other 

grasses like Anthoxanthum odoratum, Lolium multflorum, Holcus rigidus and Poa 

trivialis and spontaneous species without forage value as: Lotus uliginosus, Rumex 

acetosella ssp. angiocarpus, Potentilla anglica, Hydrocotyle vulgaris, Plantago 

lanceolata, Lobelia urens, Cerastium fontanum, Conyza bonariensis, Anagallis 

arvensis, Hypochoeris radicata, Ranunculus repens, Pteridium aquilinum, Juncus 

effusus (Dias, 1996; Borges, 1997).   

The intensive pastures are included on exotic forest of Eucalyptus. Agualva 1(RP1) is 

located at: Latitude 38º 45’ 27.18’’ N; Longitude 27º 11’ 41.55’’ W; and Agualva 2 

(RP2) at: Latitude 38º 45’ 24.44’’ N; Longitude 27º 11’ 42.24’’ W (Fig. 6). In these 

pastures the dominant grasses are usually Holcus lanatus and Lolium perenne (plant 

cover of 100%). Another species with high cover is Trifolium repens (Dias, 1996; 

Borges, 1997). In these pastures, other common species are: Plantago lanceolata, 

Cyperus esculentus, Mentha suaveolens, Cerastium fontanum, Rumex 

conglomeratus, etc. (Dias, 1996; Borges, 1997).

8.2. Land use history and soil management 

8.2.1. Land use in past 

At the time of islands Human settlement, early colonizers have developed subsistence 

crops, namely wheat and vegetables were produced, as well as, the cattle that, in 

most cases, were released in native forest. The development of the islands Human 

population took place with these new European crops: sugar cane, pastel, wheat, wine 

and citrus fruits (Brito &amp;amp; Poeira, 1991). Sugar cane cultivation was also tested in this 

period, but, unlike Madeira, the climatic conditions in the Azores, mild temperatures 

and high cloudiness, did not help to develop this culture and so, the agricultural 

tendency of the Azores was itself divided between the area sown to cereals (wheat, 

rye, barley) and pastures (Brito &amp;amp; Poeira, 1991). Due to the small size of the islands 

and the high humidity levels of the cereal stubble, the livestock sector has been 

gradually adapting to the island environment (Armas, 1982).The cycle of cattle 

breeding, milk production, dairy and meat persists since the 19th century. 

The cultural system then was based on livestock and agricultural production in the 

recent mobilized soils, so it can be considered as an agro-pastoral system, with a 

focus on export and subsistence in areas of low to medium altitude. In higher altitudes, 

the system consists in a silvopastoral, where the livestock left free in the middle of 

natural vegetation in the forest, called the "criações" (creations) or "serra aberta" (open 

mountain) as is known in Pico, Faial and Sao Jorge. On the island of Terceira, in these 

areas of open field, has been always created the wild cattle and goat cattle.

The Azorean agriculture was based in the family system of land uses, relatively 

balanced with the natural environment, which modulate a landscape of fenced fields 

divided by stone walls, mostly in the lowland and medium altitude where soils are 

more productive. The stone-walls are the first building structure of the organization of 

agrarian space, which consist in limited fields.  In the higher altitudes, the permanent 

pastures are dominant, characterized by closed fields in large dimensions with wooded 

fencerows of Cryptomeria japonica, whose suitability of the soil is agro-forestry. In the 

case of Terceira, this stratification is very clear: in the lowlands, from the coast to the 

mean average elevation of 200 to 300 m, the pastures are dominant in rotation with 

corn; in the middle altitudes, the multi-sown and the spontaneous pastures (Gomes, 

2010); at higher altitudes (&gt; 400 m), major permanent pasture fields (“bacia leiteira”) 

with wooded Cryptomeria japonica fencerow, which is a communal lands, designated 

as “baldios” under Forest Service administration (Gabriel, 1994).  

In lowland from the coastline up to 200 m, a period of dormancy of two months occurs 

during the summer. Between 200 and 400 m, the grasslands do not present a cycle of 

vegetative dormancy, but an annual production of grass for 9 to 10 months. From 400

m to 600 m, the pastures have a winter dormant period of 3 months. In uplands (&gt; 600 

m) grass production is limited by a dormant period of at least 5 months, restricting it 

only in summer (Oliveira, 1989). 

 

8.2.2. Land use today 

The current Azorean farming system is based on a Ley farming ruled by rotations of 

sown grasses and leguminous pastures and corn crops for silage (Altieri, 1998). This 

system is based on multi-annual pasture (grasses and leguminous intercropping) with 

a rotation of annual crops - corn for fodder during spring-summer and autumn such as 

Lollium multiflorum Lam. and Avena sativa L., according to altitudinal zoning of land 

altitude and the season of the year. This farming system creates serious problems of 

soil conservation, since it is unprotected during the winter, when the erosion is more 

intense (PRA, 2001). However, this system permits increase production levels with 

little annual and seasonal fluctuation in rotational grazing system with pasture, corn 

silage, grass silage, bales and concentrates to ensure economic stability and comfort 

of farmers. 

About 83 % of utilized agricultural area of the Azores is occupied by pasture (Lopes, 

1999). According to North- American Land Use Land Classification, that was adapted 

to the Azores, and according to Pinheiro et al. (1987), there are seven classes, whose 

limit of intensity increases from I to VII, and the first four classes correspond to arable 

land and the others to non-arable land.   In the case of Terceira Island, 45% of its soils 

are arable land (classes I to IV). 

When Portugal joined the European Union Market, in 1986, there was a gradual 

specialization of the farming system from the traditional Azorean to the Ley farming 

system in detriment of other arable cultures, caused a deep impact on the economy 

and land use. In these islands with favorable soil and with weather conditions optimal 

for the production of milk and meat, farmers faced a new and major challenge to 

optimize production to levels to reach the level of large agricultural or farming regions 

of northern Europe. The quota system of milk production imposed by EU as 

membership served as a driving mechanism for the modernization of farms.  

The agricultural policy then, encouraged farmers to intensify production with the first 

Community Support Framework.  With the second and third EU framework in action,

demands to reverses the situation of intensification and advances to an extensive 

production, and diverse cultures implementation and agro ecosystems balance in 

order to implement a sustainable agriculture.   

In the dairy production, the certification was implemented and denomination of 

geographical protected origin of cheeses was created, especially for São Jorge 

cheese. Meat production is also regulated and classified as a protected geographical 

origin. 

Nowadays, the implementation of a sustainable agriculture is associated with plant 

cultivation. So, the first explorations of organic farming emerge together with a growing 

local market demand. On the other hand, the conventional agriculture is dominant, 

heavily dependent on imported inputs, such as fossil fuels, imported seeds of pasture 

and maize, fertilizers and specialized agricultural machinery, with increasing water 

consumption by livestock due to increased stocking. Agri-livestock farms have been 

declining in number, but have been increasing its utilized arable superficies to meet 

the technical requirements of the farming system and market. The closed fields tend to 

be resized with the removal of stone walls between parcels and have increased the 

number of contiguous parcels. 

The stocking rate average is 2.1 animals per hectare in the Azores. Terceira has a 

higher stocking rate of 2.5, but under the current common agricultural policy the island 

aim at reducing to the value of 2.0 animals per ha in the coming years (PRA, 2001). 

However, the cultural landscape of the Azores is moving to a uniform system of land 

use patterns, characterized by pastures, planted forests and wooded fencerows of 

Cryptomeria  japonica (PROTA, 2000), associated with losses of biodiversity, of 

natural resources, environmental quality and aesthetic and cultural values.

9. Aims of this dissertation 

The aims were to: 

1) Study the AMF species composition and diversity using the classic characteristics of 

spore morphology, to highlight both qualitative and quantitative differences in semi-

natural and intensive pastures on Terceira Island in the Azores archipelago;  

2) Study the effect of land use type on AMF diversity using molecular tools, and 

analyse the occurrence of seasonal patterns in colonisation of AMF associated with 

the host plant Holcus lanatus L. in the two land use systems. Holcus lanatus L. was 

the selected for its commonness in the two land use systems and the Azores; 

3)  Assess the control mechanisms of AMF in protecting Holcus lanatus L. from the 

root-knot nematode; 

4) Address the question of the preferences of these root-colonising AMF for the three 

most abundant grasses used in pastures of the Azores: Holcus lanatus L., Lolium 

multiflorum Lam. and Lolium. perenne L.; and identify the implications for plant 

productivity.

1. Introduction 

 

AMF are ubiquitous, underground, symbiotic associations involving a wide diversity of 

plants (approximately 80%) and obligate symbiotic fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota 

thought to have originated 400–500 million years ago (Schülbler et al., 2001). In this 

intimate association the obligate biotrophic fungi provide terrestrial plants with 

minerals, nutrients (particularly inorganic phosphate) and water increasing the host 

resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, including pathogens, water limitation and 

environmental pollutants in return for photosynthates (Smith and Read, 1997).  

These beneficial effects of AMF are important in natural ecosystems, although they 

may be unimportant in high-input agriculture (Barea and Jeffries 1995; Galvez et al. 

2001). Clearly, agricultural practices such as the intensity of cultivation, the quality and 

quantity of fertilisers applied and the plant protection strategies used may have 

dramatic impacts on soil and soil organism, and the AMF community structure is not 

an exception (Sieverding, 1989; Douds and Millner, 1999; Oehl et al., 2003; Li et al., 

2007). 

There have been some recent reports comparing the AMF community structures within 

farming systems differing in management practices such as tillage, fertiliser input, 

pesticide use and crop rotation (reviewed by Douds and Millner, 1999). Some 

agricultures practices, such as tillage and fertilisation, can affect the structure of 

communities causing a decline in AMF diversity and producing a shift in the AMF 

composition (Boddington and Dodd, 2000; Egerton-Warburton and Allen, 2000; Jansa 

et al., 2002; 2003).  

The extra-radical network of AMF mycelium functions as both the nutrient absorbing 

organ of mycorrhizae and as inocula for the colonisation of new roots. Thus disruption 

caused by tillage can result in delayed or reduce root colonisation, and a decrease in 

the soil volume exploited by AMF which may affect nutrient uptake by mycorrhizae 

(Miller et al., 1995). 

In addition, Jansa et al. (2002) reported that tillage affected significantly the community 

structure of AMF, decreasing the sporulation of some non-Glomus like Gigaspora, 

Scutellospora and Entrophospora in tilled treatment. 

Also Oehl et al. (2004) found that differences between land use systems (conventional 

versus organic) did not only reflect in species richness but also in species composition. 



Chapter II

Although they have detected no change in abundance of Glomus species between 

land uses, the same pattern was not observed in relation to spore abundances of 

Acaulospora and Scutellospora species which were more abundant in organic 

systems. These findings suggest that in high-input fertilisers systems tend to occur a 

homogenisation of AMF community composition, almost dominated by AMF generalist 

species, since the non-Glomus species have a tendency to inhabit determinate niches 

being characterised as specialist as they are only present in specific soil types, 

preferentially organic soils (Oehl et al., 2010). It have been shown these agriculturally 

adapted AMF have slower rates of  infection, are faster to sporulate and to produce 

fewer arbuscules, the site of nutrients transfer to the host (Johnson, 1993; Scullion et 

al. 1998; Oehl et al. 2003). These findings suggest that the altered AMF community is 

draw more resources from the plant while providing less in return. Thus, we could 

assist to a loss in AMF species diversity during agricultural use which may result in a 

diminished biodiversity of the reestablishing plant community (Van der Heijden et al. 

1998). 

Soil types differ in soil chemical and physical characteristics. Recent works have 

showed that pH (Ezawa et al., 2001; Oehl et al., 2010), nitrogen (N) (Jonhson et al., 

2003; Egerton-Warburton et al., 2007) organic matter (OM) (Boddington and Dodd 

2000) and phosphorous (P) availability (Oehl et al., 2004) influence the composition of 

AMF communities. It has been showed in several studies that pH it is an important 

factor influencing the AMF species composition. Some AMF species (e.g., Glomus) 

prefer alkaline and neutral soil, while other (e.g., Acaulospora) sporulate more 

abundantly in acid soils (Gai and Li, 2003). Also Oehl et al. (2010) reported that pH 

had strongly influence in AMF species genus and on relative density of Glomus 

species. Nitrogen (N) has also proved to be a preponderant factor in determining AMF 

composition via carbon (C) allocation. This way, N enrichment generally decreases 

allocation to AMF structure at the field site with ample soil, but it increases allocation to 

mycorrhizae at sites with P-deficient soils (Johnson et al., 2003). Extraradical 

structures are more responsive to N enrichment than are intraradical. Hence, one time 

that Gigasporaceae produce more extraradical hyphae than Glomacaeae and 

Acaulosporaceae, both Gigasporaceae spores and extraradical hyphae decrease with 

N-enrichment in high-P soil and the opposite occurred in low-P soils (Johnson et al. 

2003). 



                                                                                                                                                        Chapter II  

  

                                                                                                                                                   57 
  

Organic matter (OM) is also susceptible to influence AMF composition via increase or 

decrease the species abundance of some AMF. Zhang et al. (1999) reported that 

frequency of occurrence of Glomus mosseae decreased with increasing OM content, 

while Glomus sinuosum and Glomus taiwanense were found only when soil organic 

matter content was less than 1.5%.  

Some authors have suggested that differences in AMF composition between 

conventional and organic systems can be explained by balance of nutrients applied 

which combined produce variables levels of soil P (Eason et al., 1999; Oehl et al., 

2004).  The largest effect of AMF is on P nutrition. It is well know that higher soil P can 

reduce AMF formation and the inhibition may be due to a direct effect on external 

hyphal growth or be indirect associated with host P status (Sanders, 1975). Glomus 

due to its large ecological plasticity is generally the genus with greater number of 

species found in intensively management (Oeh et al., 2003; 2004). Johnson (1993) 

detected an increase on relative abundance of Glomus intraradices in response in 

fertilisation witch classify it in P-tolerant, as well as, a decrease in relative abundance 

of Gigaspora gigantea, Gigaspora margarita, Scutellospora calospora and Paraglomus 

occultum. Also Bhadalung et al. (2005) showed that long-term fertilisation caused 

decreases in AMF total spore numbers and also relative spore abundance varied with 

species and sampling time. They found a decreased in absolute number of species 

Intraspora scheckii, Glomus mosseae, Glomus sp.1, Glomus geosporum-like and 

Scutellospora fulgida with fertilisation, which were classified as AMF species 

insensitive to fertilisation.  

Despite ecological importance of AMF community, little is known about their population 

biology and diversity in natural ecosystems. Due to methological limitations, only about 

200 morphospecies were described. Inoculum of AMF in soil appears in three forms: 

spores, soilborne hyphae and colonised roots. Traditional studies on AMF diversity are 

based mainly on spore morphology (Walker, 1992). However, taxonomic identification 

of AMF spores collected directly from the field is quite difficult because they are often 

unidentifiable due to degradation or parasitism by other organism, and thus do not 

necessarily reflect the AMF populations in soil (Clapp et al., 1995). Adding, fungal 

spore diversity differs seasonally, with some fungi sporulating in late spring and others 

at the end of summer. 

However, an advantage is that spore numbers are indicators over a longer time period, 

i.e. over months, which allow us to described AMF community structures based on 



Chapter II

spore morphology (Douds and Millner,1999; Oehl et al., 2003), with the exception of 

putative non-sporulating AMF species. Providing the user has reasonable taxonomic 

expertise, the extraction of spores from soil is a rapid method, and it may reveal taxa 

not easily detected by molecular methods. Moreover, intensive soil sampling, including 

the use of successive trap culturing, takes much longer but reveals significantly 

greater diversity than a ‘one-off’ spore extraction (Oehl et al., 2004). Recently, 

alternative molecular methods have been developed (Clapp et al., 1995; Helgason et 

al., 1998; Redecker, 2000). These molecular tools have proved to be useful tools for 

characterising of the AMF community, and in the future could be combined with the 

morphological tools available to a better understanding of AMF community structure. 

However, the molecular tools are costly and time-consuming, and AMF populations 

cannot as yet be quantified by these techniques, because they lack sufficient 

sensitivity detecting only the most abundant taxa (Oehl et al., 2004; Egerton-

Warburton et al., 2007). Hijri et al. (2006) noted that neither all AMF taxa present as 

spores were detected in roots by PCR, probably because they were not symbiotically 

active at the respective time or because they colonise the roots at levels below the 

detection threshold. Then, it is still uncertain whether there are other AMF that remain 

undetected because their percentage of intraradical structures are low, or if there are 

other reasons for these techniques still partly to fail (Oehl et al., 2004). 

  

The Azores archipelago has an extended area of pastures (Martins, 1993) including 

natural, semi-natural and intensive pastures (see Borges et al., 2008). Trough time, 

native forests have been destroyed by human activities and replaced by agricultural 

land. These disturbances can significantly alter the proportion of mycotrophic versus 

nonmycotrophic plant species in a community, and consequently affect the dynamics 

of the AMF community and its sporulation patterns (Violi et al., 2008). After several 

economical cycles, and some catastrophic experiences with different types of 

monocultures (e.g. wheat Triticum spp.; "Pastel" Isatis tinctoria L.; orange-tree Citrus 

spp.) (Martins, 1993), during the second half of the 20th century cattle milk production 

has grown in importance (Martins, 1993; Borges, 1997). In order to respond to the high 

density of cattle milk, pastures became the dominant landscape in the Azores 

archipelago, covering 67.7 % of the arable land, and there are also semi-natural 

pasture comprising 11.2 % of the total area (Garcia and Furtado, 1991). Most semi-

natural pastures are located at high altitude in recent infertile acid volcanic soils (e.g. 



                                                                                                                                                        Chapter II  

  

                                                                                                                                                   59 
  

Terceira and Pico), or in more mature but still poor soils (e.g. S. Maria) (Borges, 1997). 

The floristic composition of pastures is dominated by introduced grasses and 

leguminous forbs, while native forbs (e.g. Lotus uliginosus), grasses, rushes, sedges 

and ferns are more frequent in the poorly managed old semi-natural pasture (Borges, 

1997).  

To date, little is known about the diversity and composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal 

fungal (AMF) communities in this environment as affected by changing land use. 

Therefore, in this study we assessed the AMF community structure based on the 

classic spore morphology characteristics in order to highlight both qualitative and 

quantitative differences in semi-natural and intensive pastures in Terceira Island 

(Azores).  

 

 

2. Materials and methods 

2.1. Study sites 

This study was conducted in the Terceira Island, the third island of the Azorean 

archipelago in terms of size (402 km2). Terceira is a roundish island formed by four 

main volcanic complexes (Serra de Santa Bárbara, Serra do Morião, Pico Alto and 

Serra do Cume) (Zbyszewski et al., 1971). The highest point (Serra de S. Bárbara, 

1023 m) is simultaneously the most recent of the three major island’s complexes of 

0.025 Ma B.P. (Martins, 1993). The eastern flatted part of the island is its older part of 

about 3.52 My (Borges et al., 2009). Recent historical volcanic activity is evident in the 

western part of the island, where several well preserved lava tubes and volcanic 

chimneys are present (Borges et al., 1993). The Azores archipelago have a temperate 

oceanic climate characterised by high levels of relative atmospheric humidity that 

could reach 95% at high altitude native forests and ensures slight thermal variations 

throughout the year (Azevedo et al., 1999). The average temperature is 17.5° C in low 

altitudes, while the maximum temperature is in August and minimum in February 

(Azevedo, 1996). The pluviometric regime reaches its peak in January-February and 

minimum and July (Azevedo, 1996): Angra do Heroísmo (47 m): 969 mm year (140 

mm in January and 40 mm in July) and Serra de S. Bárbara (1,023 m): 3,000 mm year 

(Borges, 1997).  

The sampling areas were cattle-grazed upland pastures of two different types: semi-

natural pastures (managed for more than 50 years, with a higher diversity of grasses 



Chapter II

and forbs; see Borges and Brown 2001) and intensive pastures (managed for more 

than 20 years, characterised also by a poor vascular flora of five or less dominant 

species).The semi-natural pastures are included in a site of communitarian interest 

(SIC- Serra de Santa Barbara e Pico Alto) inside of Rede Natura 2000: Pico Galhardo 

(PX) (Latitude 38º 41’ 51.71’’ N; Longitude 27º 13’ 25.34’’ W) and Terra Brava (TB) 

(Latitude 38º 41’ 59.74’’ N; Longitude 27º 12’ 41.37’’ W) (Fig. 1). 

These pastures show a high floristic diversity, and they are dominated by the grasses 

Holcus lanatus and Agrostis castellana, perennial grasses that covers around 100% of 

sites (Dias, 1996; Borges, 1997).  Frequently present in these pastures are also other 

grasses like Anthoxanthum odoratum, Lolium multflorum, Holcus rigidus and Poa 

trivialis and spontaneous species without forage value as: Lotus uliginosus, Rumex 

acetosella ssp. angiocarpus, Potentilla anglica, Hydrocotyle vulgaris, Plantago 

lanceolata, Lobelia urens, Cerastium fontanum, Conyza bonariensis, Anagallis 

arvensis, Hypochoeris radicata, Ranunculus repens, Pteridium aquilinum, Juncus 

effusus (Dias, 1996; Borges, 1997).   

The intensive pastures are included on exotic forest of Eucalyptus. Agualva 1(RP1) is 

located at: Latitude 38º 45’ 27.18’’ N; Longitude 27º 11’ 41.55’’ W; and Agualva 2 

(RP2) at: Latitude 38º 45’ 24.44’’ N; Longitude 27º 11’ 42.24’’ W (Fig. 1). In these 

pastures the dominant grasses are usually Holcus lanatus and Lolium perenne (plant 

cover of 100%). Another species with high cover is Trifolium repens (Dias, 1996; 

Borges, 1997). In these pastures, other common species are: Plantago lanceolata, 

Cyperus esculentus, Mentha suaveolens, Cerastium fontanum, Rumex

2.2. Sample collection 

Soil sample were collected in August 2007 from the root zones of the dominant and 

common plant species Holcus lanatus L., to a depth of 20 cm at 10 different locations 

in each sampling area (PX, TB, RP1 and RP2). 

 

 

2.3. Study plant 

The Azorean pastures are dominated by Holcus lanatus L. a non-indigenous plant with 

a frequency more than 50% (Dias, 1996; Silva and Smith, 2006; Kueffer et al., 2010). 

In Terceira Island in a total of 30 exotic vascular plants, H. lanatus L. was the third 

more frequent (Silva and Smith, 2006). This plant is a C3 perennial, 20–110 cm tall, 

tufted grass (Ross et al., 2003). It is very common, growing in all kinds of soil but the

optimal growth occurs in moist conditions (Franco, 1984). H. lanatus grows well in very 

wet conditions and can survive moderate periods of drought (Franco, 1984). 

 

 

2.4. Soil analyses 

The soils of semi-natural and intensive pastures are andossols and sandy-loam 

(Pinheiro, 1990). The soil analyses were performed only with soil samples collected in 

August 2007. The 10 samples of rhizospheric soil from each site were pooled and 

analysed as a single sample. Chemical soil parameters for each soil are presented in 

Table 1. They were measured in the University of Azores Soil Laboratory (CITA-A), 

according to standard methods. Potassium, calcium and magnesium were extracted 

with sodium acetate (1/5) at pH 7, and were determined using a Varian ICP atomic 

emission spectrophotometer. Soil pH was determined on a soil/water paste (1/2.5) and 

available phosphorus as described by Olsen and Sommers (1982) by extraction with a 

0.5 M NaHCO3 solution at pH 8.5, using AAS. Total soil nitrogen content was 

estimated using the Kjehldahl method (Allen, 1989). The organic carbon (OC) and 

organic matter (OM) present in the soil were estimated using the dry ashing method. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.5. Establishment of a trap culture 

Trap cultures were established from fresh soil samples mixed with autoclaved sand 

and “bagacina” (volcanic soil type) in a ratio of 2:1:1. A 1.5-kg aliquot of the mixture 

was placed in each pot to produce trap culture from each sample (Fig. 2). Corn (Zea 

mays L.) was used as host plant. Seeds of corn were surface sterilised by immersion 

in alcohol (96 %) for 30 sec, 4 % bleach for 2 min, and rinsed twice in sterile distilled

water. Then, they were sown in pots on sterilised sand soil and left to germinated in 

the greenhouse. After one week of growth, seedlings were transplanted to pots 

containing the fresh soil samples mix. A total of 4 seedlings were used per plot. Trap 

cultures in 40 plots were grown in glasshouse for 5 months and then harvested. All 

pots were watered every 2 days with distilled water, and no nutrient solution was 

added to the pots. One month before harvested, we left watering the pots to stimulate 

the sporulation. 

 

 

 

2.6. AMF spore extraction and identification 

Spores were extracted from each soil sample using a centrifugation technique 

modified from that used for extracting nematodes from soil (Jenkins, 1964). A 

subsample of about 50 cm3 was weighed and sieved (2 mm) to remove some debris 

and lumps. Next, the sample was placed in an erlemeyer (1000 mL) containing a 

solution of sodium polyphosphate (NaPO3)n, stirred vigorously for 4 min on a stirrer 

and allowed to settle for 15 sec. Then, the supernatant was gently poured to a stack of 

1000-, 500-, 250-, 100-, and 45 µm sieves. This operation was repeated more than 2 

times but it was used only distilled water as a solution. Then, we proceeded to the 

collection of the material found in each sieve to two 50-mL plastic centrifuge tubes, 

and centrifuged for 5 min at 4000 r.p.m. on horizontal centrifuge. The supernatant was 

discarded and the tubes were filled with sucrose solution at a concentration of 480 g/ L 

(specific gravity, 1.18). Their contents were then stirred thoroughly and centrifuged for 

3 min at 3000 r.p.m. The supernatant was quickly poured onto a 38 µm sieve and

sluiced with tap water to remove the sugar. The material retained on this last sieve 

was transferred to a 50-mL plastic centrifuge tube and stored at 4 ?C in autoclaved 

distilled water until count could be made. After, tubes containing the spores were 

discharged into a glass Petri plate (9 cm diameter), all spores were counted into at a 

2-mL plastic tube and stored at 4 ?C in autoclaved distilled. Next each plastic tube 

containing all spore extracted from each sample (a total of 40 samples) were sent to a 

specialist, AMF spore in identification, Dr. Christopher Walker which made its 

morphological identification.  

Species description was based on recommendations of Dr. C. Walker, as well as, on 

current species descriptions and identification manuals (International Culture 

Collection of Arbuscular and Vesicular-Arbuscular Endomycorrhizal Fungi 

[http://invam.caf.wvu.edu/Myc_Info/Taxonomy/species.htm]). 

This work was a preliminary study of AMF diversity and composition only based on 

species extracted from trap culture, caused by low spore number, parasitism of 

spores, and age and environmental alteration of spores (e.g., discoloration) in field 

which could hinder accurate identification, Hence, it’s probable that has occurred some 

bias from the use of this technique.  

Discrepancies between trap culture roots and field-collected roots are likely to be the 

result of the conditions in the pot cultures, which may favor certain AMF taxa. 

Consequently, trap culture may provide a different picture of AMF communities than 

analysis of field-collected roots. Such a difference in AMF species composition 

between trapping and direct spore extraction had been report in several studies 

(Brundrett et al. 1999; Oehl et al. 2003). Brundrett et al. (1999) found that most 

species of Scutellospora, Acaulospora and Gigaspora were obtained primarily from 

field-collected spores, but only 50% of these culture attempts were successful. With 

Glomus, they found the opposite pattern. Several Glomus spp. rarely detected in field 

soil were dominant in trap cultures. Oehl et al., (2004) reported three out of 35 species 

recorded at a field site failing to produce spores in traps. Hijri et al. (2006) noted that 

Paraglomus was never detected in trap cultures, although it occurred frequently in the 

field site experiment. However, the opposite was observed by them in relation to 

Archaeospora trappei which only be detected in trap cultures. 

Also Wang et al., 2008 found a distinct difference in AMF diversity in the two sets of 

intensively managed agricultural soil in Sichuan Province of SE China. Only five 



                                                                                                                                                        Chapter II  

  

                                                                                                                                                   65 
  

species out of thirty were detected both by direct extraction (soil set 2) from soil and by 

trap culturing (soil set 1).  

However, despite all limitations of trap culture it’s know that identification of species at 

a site and quantification of diversity, dominance, etc., actually it’s limited to the 

sporulating species, and that non-sporulating species only can be detected via trap 

culture. The differences between isolation methods often is pronounced with 

prolonged (Oehl et al., 2003) or repeated trapping (Stutz and Morton, 1996). However, 

it is clear that several isolation methods should be used simultaneously to obtain a 

more complete picture of the AMF species composition in soil. Brundrett et al. (1999) 

studied four different techniques for isolating AMF, i.e. (1) spores separated from soil, 

(2) soil trap cultures, (3) root samples or (4) transplanted seedlings. They found that all 

these techniques complemented each other because they often produced cultures 

dominated by different species from the same soil sample. 

Furthermore, although morphological identification of AMF is the most widespread 

method and in many cases still unavoidable, it should be carried out concomitantly 

with other (e.g. molecular) methods for mutual confirmation. 

 

 

2.7. Data analysis 

Spore density, richness, occurrence and relative abundance were based on spore 

identification extracted from the trap culture. The ecological parameters were 

calculated as follows: i) spore density was expressed as number of fungal spores in 50 

g dried soil; ii) relative of abundance was defined as the number of spore of a given 

specie or genus divided by the total number of spores in each soil type; iii) frequency 

of occurrence was calculated as the number of samples from which particular species 

or genus were isolated; iv) species richness was defined as the number of AMF taxa 

found in particular field site.  

To analyse the relatedness of sampling sites in respect of AMF species composition a 

hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) using Ward’s minimum variance method was 

performance in CAP 4 (Community Analysis Package 4, CAP4), to determine the 

similarity (more precisely: dissimilarity) with respect to AMF species composition 

between land use, based on the ?2 distance. We also used Principal Correspondence 

in CAP 4, to study the contribution of each sampled site to the total variation based on 



Chapter II                                                                                                                                                           

   66 
 

their AMF species composition, as well as the contribution from each AMF species 

based on their abundance along sampled sites. 

Pearson correlations coefficients was calculated between chemical proprieties of each 

soil type and the total AMF density, as well as between AMF spore density of the more 

representative genera (Acaulospora, Glomus and Scutellospora).  

The sampling design was nested hierarchical, with field sites nested within land use 

type. Then, to investigate the variation on species richness between land uses and 

between field sites within each land use we used Nested ANOVA (Minitab, version 

13.31, 2000). The same proceed was made to estimated the variation on total AMF 

spore density, and the variation on AMF spore density of the more representative 

genera (Acaulospora, Glomus and Scutellospora) between land uses and between 

field sites within each land use. All data were tested for normality when required to 

fulfil assumptions of the Nested ANOVA.  

 

3. Results 

3.1. AMF species recorded 

Thirthy-nine AMF species representing eight genera were detected in two land uses 

studied (Table 2). Nineteen species could not clearly be named at the species level, 

the majority of them bellowed to the genus Glomus (13), Paraglomus (2) following by 

genera Acaulospora, Ambispora, Gigaspora and Scutellospora each with just one 

species not morphologically identified to the species level (Table 2). 

The two most representative genera were Glomus and Acaulospora with 19 and 10 

species respectively, following from the genera Paraglomus and Scutellospora with 3 

species each. The other AMF species detected were two from the genus one species 

(Table 2).

Ambispora sp. 

Spores singly in the soil, globose, 70 x 70 µm, pale pinkish cream, with a roughened 

appearance due to degradation of outer wall component. Spore wall structure of 3 

groups. Group A of two components: component 1 evanescent, becoming roughened 

through degradation; component 2 laminated. Group 2 composed of a single flexible 

component. Group 3 of two tightly adherent flexible components. This appears to be 

an undescribed species in the genus Ambispora with some similarity to A. fennica, the 

type species of the genus, but the spores are much smaller and as yet no link has 

been made with a glomoid morphotype. Further work will be required to verify its 

identity though isolation followed by molecular and morphological study.

3.3. AMF species composition 

The number of species found at both land uses types was almost identical, as the 

semi-natural and intensive pastures contained 24 and 28 AMF species respectively. 

Then, no significant differences was found between land uses (Nested Anova: F= 

2.44; d.f= 1. 2; p= 0.13) neither between field sites within each land uses (Nested 

Anova: F= 1.31; d.f= 1. 36; p= 0.28). 

However, the AMF species composition appeared to differ between both land uses. 

The hierarchical cluster analyses showed that land use intensity was the dominating 

factors which separated the similarities in AMF species composition between field 

sites (Fig. 4). The semi-natural sites with lower levels of land use intensity (PX; TB), 

are clearly separated clearly from intensives sites (RP1; RP2). 

 

 

  



Chapter II

The contribution of AMF spore abundance and land use type to the total variation in 

species composition was analysed via Principal Component Analyses (PCA) (Fig. 5). 

Figure 5 presents the biplot for the first and second PCA axes, which explained 76.2% 

of total variation. The first axis which contributed with 46.50 % to the variance in 

species composition separated clearly the 2 land use types. In fact, only 18% of AMF 

species had “a generalist” behaviour, having been detected in both land uses, like 

Acaulospora paulinae, Acaulospora laevis, Acaulospora myriocarpa, Scutellospora 

calospora, Scutellospora pellucida, Glomus clarum and Glomus rubiformis.

We detected that some AMF species occurred exclusively in just one land use type or 

in just one field site. In this way, Acaulospora sp. and Ambispora sp. were only 

observed in the semi-natural land use (Fig. 5) while G. etunicatum and Paraglomus 

brasilianum was only found in the intensive ones (Fig. 5). In fact, Acaulospora and 

Scutellospora were not only the two genera with higher frequency of occurrence (Fig. 

6 a; 6 b) but also the most abundant (Fig. 7 a; 7 b) in semi-natural sites, having been 

S. calospora and A. myriocarpa the dominant species of these genera (Fig. 5). On the 

other hand, in intensive land use Glomus was the more frequent genus having been 

present in more than 90 % of the samples (Fig. 6 c; 6 d). Glomus was the most 

abundant genus (Fig. 7 c; 7 d), having contributed with about 40% of the total AMF 

spores density of intensive land use field sites. Between the various species of 

Glomus, G. etunicatum was the most representative species of this genus (Fig. 5). 

Paraglomus also was more frequent in intensive field sites than in semi-natural ones 

(Fig. 6 c; 6 d), as well as more abundant (Fig. 7 c; 7 d). 

Interesting was the frequency of occurrence of Acaulospora, having been present in 

almost all samples of intensive land use (Fig. 6 c; 6 d), especially the relative density 

of A. paulinae, that made it in the dominant species of this genus in RP2 (Fig. 6 d). 

 Furthermore, other species were more or less restricted to specific field sites which 

contributed to enhance, the role of management systems as key factor in species 

composition between semi-natural and intensive land uses. Thus, in relation to the 

field sites of semi-natural land use we observed that Acaulospora delicata, 

Acaulospora thomii, Glomus intraradices, Intraspora schenckii and Gigaspora sp. only 

occurred in PX, whereas Acaulospora excavata, Acaulospora tuberculata, Glomus sp. 

3 and Glomus sp. 4 were detected only in TB (Fig. 5). On the other hand, we also 

noted that some species exclusively occurred in RP1, like Acaulospora elegans, 

Glomus sp. 5, Glomus sp. 6, Glomus sp. 8 and Glomus sp. 9 (Fig. 5). Finally we 

observed that 9 AMF were only detected in RP1, most of them belong to genus 

Glomus, such Glomus lamellosum, Glomus globiferum, Glomus sp. 9, Glomus sp. 10, 

Glomus sp. 11, Glomus sp. 12, Glomus sp. 13. Also only presented in RP2 field site 

were Paraglomus sp. 2 and Entrophospora infrequens (Fig. 5).

3.4. Soil nutrient parameters 

The correlation coefficient of soil nutrient parameters which influenced the total AMF 

spore density as well as the AMF spore densities belong to the genera: Acaulospora, 

Glomus and Scutellospora is present in the Table 3. The total AMF spore density was 

not significantly correlated with any soil nutrients. However, a different scenario was 

obtained when we analysed the AMF spore densities of the 3 more representative 

genera (Acaulospora, Glomus and Scutellospora).

The AMF spore density belong to the Acaulospora genus was positively correlated 

with N (r= 0.446), Mg (r= 0.406) and OM (r= 0.443) at p&amp;lt;0.01. Significant and positive 

correlations were also observed between Acaulospora spores density and Ca (r= 

0.383, p&amp;lt;0.05). Negative and significant correlations existed between Glomus spores 

density and all soil nutrients analyzed except with P, with which had also a negative 

but statistically insignificant correlation. Thus, Glomus spore density was negatively 

correlated with N (r= -0.502), Mg (r= -0.494), Ca (r= 0.474) and OM (r= -0.508) at p&amp;lt;

0.01 as well as with K (r= -0.404, p&amp;lt;0.05). Contrary to Glomus spore density, AMF 

spore density belong to Scutellospora genus was positively correlated with all soil 

nutrients, except with P, with which expressed a positive but insignificant correlation. 

This way, Scutellospora spore density was positive and significantly correlated with N 

(r= 0.415), Mg (r= 0.461), Ca (r= 0.460) and OM (r= 0.444) at p&amp;lt;0.01. Scutellospora 

spore density also had a positive and significant correlation with K (r= 0.337, p&amp;lt;0.05). 

 

 

3.5. AMF spore density 

The AMF spore densities did not differ among the two land use in question (Nested 

Anova: F= 0.16; d.f= 1. 2; p= 0.696), neither between field sites within each land use 

(Nested Anova: F= 0.59; d.f= 2. 36; p= 0.558). Nevertheless, when we analysis the 

genus which had more weight to the spore density of each field site the result was 

interestingly different (Table. 4). The spore density of Acaulospora genus, Glomus 

genus and Scutellospora genus differed significantly among the various soil types and 

depended on land use. Then, the AMF spore density belong to Acaulospora genus 

varied significantly between management systems (Nested Anova: F= 6.70; d.f= 1. 2; 

p= 0.014) (Table 4). However, there were no significant differences among field sites 

within each land use (Nested Anova: F= 2.13; d.f= 2. 36; p= 0.134) (Table 4).

                                                                                                                                                   85 
  

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

In fact, the relative abundance of Acaulospora genus was higher in the semi-natural 

land use than in intensive ones, having been the dominant genus in both semi-natural 

field sites, especially in PX with a relative abundance of 46% (Fig. 8). The same 

patterns of results was observed for the AMF spore density belong to the genus 

Glomus, which also varied significantly between the two managements systems 

(Nested Anova: F= 9.73; d.f= 1. 2; p= 0.004) (Table 4). However, we did not observe 

significant differences among the field sites within each land use (Nested Anova: F= 

1.53; d.f= 2. 36; p= 0.231) (Table 4). Glomus was the most abundant genus in 

intensive land use, having contributed with more than 40 % to the AMF spore density 

of each intensive field sites (Fig. 8).

Finally the AMF spore density belong to the Scutellospora genus, also was 

significantly influenced by the land use type (Nested Anova: F= 9.06; d.f= 2. 36; p= 

0.005) (Table 4). But, there were no significant differences between field site within 

each land use (Nested Anova: F= 1.23; d.f= 2. 36; p= 0.303) (Table 4). Like 

Acaulospora genus, Scutellospora also was one of the most abundant genera in semi-

natural land use, contributing with approximately 40% in the AMF spore density of 

each semi-natural field site (Fig. 8). 

 

 

4. Discussion 

 

AMF species diversity 

Pasture management can affect the structure of AMF communities causing a decline 

in AMF diversity and producing a shift in the AMF community composition (Boddington 

and Dodd, 2000; Jansa et al., 2003). In the current study we found that based on 

spore morphology there was no differences in AMF diversity in semi-natural and 

intensives pastures. A similar result was obtained in relation to AMF spore density, 

which although it was slightly higher in semi-natural systems was not statistically

significant. Lack of consistent differences across the two managements practices 

investigated are opposite to previous reports of lower diversity and abundance of AMF 

spores in disturbed than in more pristine soils (Boddington and Dodd 2000; Oehl, et 

al., 2003; Gai et al., 2006). Among others, Eason et al. (1999) detected root 

colonisation and AMF spore density was significantly lower in conventional grassland 

than in organic ones. Oehl et al. (2004) noted that AMF spore abundance and species 

diversity was significantly higher in the organic than conventional systems. Also 

Castillo et al. (2006) observed that the number of AMF spore was affected by the 

tillage systems, have been higher under no-tillage than under no-tillage conditions. 

Gai et al. (2009) found that the lowest species richness, spore density and Shannon 

index of AMF in the montane scrub could be explained by the intensity of land use, 

once these grasslands are severely disturbed as result of agriculture practices. 

However our result was consistent with found by some authors. Among others, Jansa 

et al. (2002) found that spore abundance was not significantly affected by soil tillage. 

Also Sjoberg et al. (2004) did not find significant differences in spore densities 

between semi-natural grassland and ploughed fields. Schalamuk et al. (2006) found 

spores of at least 24 species belonging to 6 genera of AMF in non-tilled and tilled 

wheat soils in Argentina. In this study, tilling or fertilisation did not seem to affect the 

diversity of spores present, instead spore communities were affected by other factors 

particular wheat phenology. 

More recently, Jefwa et al. (2009) found along a land use gradient, that land use type 

had not significant effect on AMF spore abundance.  

 

AMF spore composition 

However, striking differences were found in species composition between land uses. 

Species in Glomus were dominant in intensive land uses, indicating adaptability in 

adjusting patterns of sporulation to environmental conditions as evidenced by its global 

distribution (Gai et al., 2009). Prevalence of Glomus species in agricultural soil is 

widely reported (Jansa et al., 2002; Oehl et al., 2003; Mathimaran et al., 2005; Wang 

and Vestberg, 2008). 

Oehl et al. (2003) found that some species that had a “generalist” behavior, most of 

them belong to Glomus genus, were prevalent in intensively managed systems. The 

same author pointed out not only a decreased in AMF species richness with increase 

of land use intensity, but also a preferential selection of species that colonised roots 



Chapter II

slowly but formed spores rapidly. Also Jansa et al. (2003) found that in conventional 

tilled soils, almost exclusively AMF belonging to Glomus spp. were present, and that 

this could be explain by a stimulatory effect of tillage on hyphae growth and/or by the 

lower completion for root colonization cause by the absence of other AMF species. 

Lately, Castillo et al. (2006) in same field site conditions also noted that Glomus spp. 

constituted about 65 % of total spores in both cultivation systems. Mathimaran et al. 

(2005) only detected Glomus genus in Swiss agricultural soil. 

 

Colonisation strategies of AMF  

The dominance of Glomus genus in such disturbed systems could be related to 

differences in propagative units between the glomalean families (Jansa et al., 2003; 

Castillo et al., 2006). Members of Glomaceae have a highly infective extra-radical 

mycelium that could allow colonising immediately plant roots (Hart and Reader, 2002). 

Adding, Glomus forms anastomose between mycelia and possibility therefore has the 

ability to re-establish an interconnected network after mechanical disturbance (Daniell 

et al., 2001). Contrary members of Gigasporaceae, those are only capable of 

propagation via spore dispersal or infection from an intact mycelium would colonise 

plant roots more slowly than members of Glomaceae. Spore dormancy and specific 

environmental conditions for spore germination probably slow the rate at which 

regenerating AMF can colonise plant roots (Hart and Reader, 2002). Then, these 

differences can explain the dominance of the Glomaceae over members of the 

Gigasporaceae in an environment with repetitive severe physical disturbance, for 

example ploughing between crop cycles. 

The most striking effect of different managements systems concerned the spore 

abundance of AMF species not belonging to the genus Glomus. Many of these 

species appeared to prefer or even to be restricted to the semi-natural field sites. This 

was the case for most species of Acaulospora, Scutellospora as well as 

Entrophospora. Jansa et al. (2002) argued that tillage had a significant influence on 

sporulation of some species and non-Glomus AMF tend to be more abundant in the 

no-tilled soil. Then they have reported, although not significant, a slight increased in 

the incidence of Gigaspora, Scutellospora and Entrophospora in the no-tilled soil. The 

absence or lower abundance of non-Glomus AMF under tillage condition might be 

attributed to the yearly disruption of the extraradical hyphae of these fungi induced by 

this management practice (Jansa et al., 2003).  



                                                                                                                                                        Chapter II  

  

                                                                                                                                                   89 
  

This trend towards an increase in AMF belong to genera Acaulospora, Scutellospora 

as well as Entrophospora under long-term reduced tillage managements was also 

observed  by Oehl et al. (2004) in organic farming. These authors argue that some 

species, especially Acaulospora, Scutellospora, Cetrapora and Gigaspora have 

specific and rather narrow, inhabitating preferably organic farming systems, which 

could be probably related with lower nutrient level (especially available P) in these 

agroecosystems (Oehl et al., 2010).  

Also Börstler et al. (2006) found in a study development in an extensively/ intensively 

farmed meadows that Acaulospora was only detected at the extensively ones.  

However, despite Acaulospora has been not only the most abundant but also the more 

frequent genus in semi-natural land use, it is interesting to note that in intensive ones 

Acaulospora also was one of the most frequent genus and together with Glomus 

genus formed the highest proportion of spores in intensive field sites. A similar result 

was found by Castillo et al. (2006) who reported a tendency for a slightly higher 

relative presence of spore of Acaulospora spp. under conventional-tillage than under 

no-tillage sytems. Also, Jefwa et al. (2009) point out that AMF species spore 

abundance was a response to stress with Glomaceae and Acaulosporaceae 

responding to harsh conditions by producing spores, which making them to persist and 

dominate disturbed landscapes longer. 

 

Soil nutrient availability 

Nutrient availability affects the composition of AMF communities in the soil (Ezawa et 

al., 2001; Titus and Leps, 2000). In fact, the density of 3 genera most representative 

Acaulospora, Glomus and Scutellospora was correlated with almost soil nutrients. 

Boddington and Dodd (2000) observed the development of indigenous AMF by adding 

organic matter. Khanam et al. (2006) also found in important available agricultural 

crops in Bangladesh a positive correlation between soil nutrients levels (N, K, OM) and 

spore numbers. Nevertheless, the opposite was observed in relation to total AMF 

spore density, which corroborated the generalisation that inorganic fertilisers always 

have a lowering effect on all glomale species (Jefwa et al., 2006). 

Among soil nutrients phosphorus is widely known to inhibit the composition and 

diversity of AMF communities as well as spore and mycelium densities in temperate 

and tropical systems (Agwa and Al-Sodany, 2003; Jansa et al., 2005; Khanam et al., 

2006). Kahiluoto et al. (2001) demonstrated reduced AMF colonisation of roots and 



Chapter II

AMF spore density in soil with increasing P fertilisation for several crops on two soils 

with low and intermediate concentrations of available P. 

However in our study no correlation statically significant was obtained between AMF 

spore density and this soil nutrient. A similar result was reported by Mathimaran et al. 

(2005) who not found an effect of P fertilisation on spore density in field site and in trap 

culture, either by Rodriguez-Echeverria et al. (2007) who also not detected a 

correlation between AMF abundance and soil fertility. It is interesting to note that the P 

level in the two land use under study was low and below to the level considered 

prejudicial to AMF, this may have been reflect in the way how other soil nutrients, 

particularly nitrogen, may affect AMF community. Under P-limited conditions, the 

investment of a host plant in AMF genus or species should be strengthened to 

maintain the uptake of-limiting nutrients (Johnson et al., 2003). So as predicted by the 

functional equilibrium model, in low-P soil, relative allocation to arbuscules, coils and 

extraradical hyphae is generally increased by N enrichment and vice-versa (Johnson 

et al., 2003). Consequently, we can observe an increase in AMF productivity, species 

richness and diversity with N fertilisation, being in these conditions the most 

responsive AMF taxa Acaulospora, Scutellospora and Gigaspora. The opposite occur 

in P-rich with N fertilisation application, observing an intensification of AMF community 

due to the loss of rare AMF species and the increase on abundance of Glomus 

species (Egerton-Warburton et al., 2007). Then, changes in AMF community may be 

explained by changes in the soil N:P ratio. 

Our results were consistent with found by Johnson et al. (2003) and Egerton-

Warburton et al. (2007). In fact, the spore densities of Acaulospora and Scutellospora 

were positively correlated with N soil nutrient, but the opposite occurred with spore 

density of Glomus genus, which was reflected in a greater abundance of genera 

Acaulospora and Scutellospora in semi-natural land use, as well as, in higher 

abundance of Glomus genus in intensive ones. 

 

We conclude that land use type had no significant effect on AMF spore diversity and 

total density. However clear differences were found in AMF spores composition 

between land uses. Species of Glomus were dominant in intensive pastures, while 

Acaulospora and Scutellospora predominated in semi-natural pastures. This could be 

explained through different strategies of colonisation adopted by AMF and by soil 

nutrient levels. Members of Glomaceae have a highly infective extra-radical mycelium 



                                                                                                                                                        Chapter II  

  

                                                                                                                                                   91 
  

that could allow colonising immediately plant roots, while members of Gigasporaceae 

are only capable of propagation via spore dispersal, colonising plant roots more slowly 

than members of Glomaceae. Moreover, Glomus forms anastomose between mycelia 

therefore has the ability to re-establish an interconnected network after mechanical 

disturbance.  

On the other hand, the spore densities of the three most representative genera – 

Glomus, Acaulospora and Scutellospora were correlated with soil nutrients.Thus, the 

improvement of soil fertility, especially the availability of K, N, Ca and Mg, provided 

favourable environment for mycorrhizal formation and function in these systems. 

However, a correlation between spore density and soil P content was not found. The 

low level of soil P content and its implication on absorption of the other soil nutrients, 

particularly N, could explained some change in the AMF spore composition.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are obligate mutualistic symbionts that colonise 

more than 85% of terrestrial plants (Smith and Read, 1997; Smith et al., 1999; 

Ronsheim and Anderson, 2001; Wilkinson, 2001). In addition AMF are essential 

components of soil microbiota in most agroecosystems (Smith and Read, 1997; 

Boddington and Dodd, 2000).  By forming an extended hyphal network, AMF can 

improve the growth of different plant species due to enhanced nutrient uptake, 

particularly immobile nutrients like phosphorus, because the hyphae can reach farther 

that the nutrient depleted zones that build up around plant roots (Smith and Read, 1997; 

Clark and Zeto, 2000). As symbionts of plants, AMF fungi can indirectly affect 

herbivores by reducing acceptability of the plant tissue, altering the nutritional quality, or 

increasing concentrations or types of defence compounds in the plant tissue, which can 

alter host resistance to these enemies (Gange and Weast, 1994; Master and Brown, 

1997; Borowicz, 1997; Gange et al., 1999; Goverde et al., 2000; Wearn and Gange, 

2007). AMF colonisation commonly improves tolerance of crops to other forms of biotic 

stress, such as nematodes (de la Peña et al., 2006; Rodriguez-Romero et al., 2005, 

Rodriguez-Echeverria et al., 2009) and root pathogens (Smith et al., 1999; Klironomos 

et al., 2000; Idoia et al., 2004) as well as to a abiotic stresses, such as drought and 

metal toxicity (Gonzalez-Chavez et al., 2002). Furthermore, AMF contribute to soil 

aggregation because the hyphal network builds up of a macroporous structure that 

facilities penetration of water and air and prevents erosion ( Rilling et al., 2003; 

Piotrowski et al., 2004; Cavagnaro et al., 2006; Van Der Heijden et al., 2006).  Another 

important role of AMF is their contribution as drivers of plant community composition 

(Van der Heijden et al., 1998; Wolfe et al., 2006). 

AMF are therefore beneficial for plant performance, playing a crucial role for the 

sustainability of natural and agriculture ecosystems (Bareae et al., 2005). However, the 

distribution and colonisation by AMF are affected by various physico-chemical factors of 

soil such as pH, moisture and temperature (Abbott and Robson, 1981). Furthermore, 

agricultural practices like tillage, crop sequence and the composition and application of 

chemicals alter AMF populations, species composition and root colonisation (Eason et 

al., 1999; Boddington and Dodd, 2000; Jansan et al., 2002; Oehl et al., 2003; Purin et 

al., 2006). Tillage has been shown to have a significant influence on AMF colonisation 

(Douds and Miller, 1999; Jansa et al., 2003; Schalamuck et al., 2006; Garcia et al., 



Chapter III

2007). The AMF hyphal network is the main source of AMF inoculum in soils, and tillage 

causes severe disruption to the mycorrhizal network resulting in delayed or reduced root 

colonisation and a reduction in the volume of soil that is exploited by AMF (Evans and 

Miller, 1990; Boddington and Dodd, 2000). In the same way, hyphae and colonised root 

fragments are transported to the upper soil layer, decreasing and diluting their activity 

as viable propagules for subsequent crops. On the other hand, phosphorus (P) uptake 

by plants is generally increased with tillage, due partly to an improved distribution of P 

and increased P availability (Borie et al., 2006; Garcia et al., 2007). Castillo et al. (2006) 

reported that, under conditions of no tillage AMF root colonisation rates as well as the 

species richness and number of spores were higher than in tillage conditions. However, 

Jansa et al. (2002) found no significant effect of tillage on diversity indices of the AMF 

community, and Schalamuk et al. (2006) observed a higher number of AMF species in 

conventional tilled soils than in non-tilled soils cropped with wheat, suggesting that is 

not always detrimental to AM biodiversity. 

Mycorrhizal benefits are usually reduced when soil nutrients are abundant. For 

instance, an increase in soil P availability negatively affects mycorrhizal colonisation of 

plant roots (Al-Karaki and Clark, 1999; Eason et al., 1999; Bhadalung et al., 2005; Li et 

al., 2006). Other edaphic factors such as an excess of nitrogen (N) (Blanke et al., 2005; 

Bradley et al., 2006; Porras-Alfaro et al., 2007) and extreme pH (Clark et al., 1999; 

Ezawa et al., 2001; Khanam et al., 2006) may also create conditions in which there is 

little or no benefit to the host plant from AMF. In addition to affecting plant performance, 

these factors also influence host plant dependency on AMF symbiosis and the level of 

root colonisation. 

Grazing has also been found to dramatically reduce AMF colonisation and spores 

densities (Gange et al., 1993; Gehring et al., 1994; Lugo and Cabello, 2002; Dhillion 

and Gardsjord, 2004). This may be due to a decrease in leaf area and an increase in 

the root/shoot ratio that results in a decreased source capacity that is insufficient to 

satisfy root and AMF sink demands. Indeed, Dhillion and Gardsjord (2004) found a 

significantly higher level of AMF colonisation in ungrazed grasslands than in grazed 

ones. 

Nevertheless, Eom et al. (2000) found that root colonisation by AMF was greater under 

moderate and intense grazing in a tallgrass prairie when compared to ungrazed sites. 

Frank et al. (2003) also observed that mycorrhizal communities differed markedly in 

grazed and fenced grassland. The spore abundance, species richness and diversity of

AMF were all higher in grazed soil compared to ungrazed soil as result of grazing 

stimulating a greater allocation of energy belowground increasing the investment in the 

mycorrhizal symbiosis. Similarly, Wearn and Gange (2007) also found that moderate 

grazing by rabbits had a rapid and persistent positive effect on the mycorrhizal 

colonisation of roots of three grasses studied in two grasslands.  

In many terrestrial ecosystems, temporal changes in AMF colonisation show a seasonal 

pattern correlated with several factors such as plant phenology, with the highest rates of 

colonisation occurring during flowering and fruiting (Titus and Leps, 2000; Lugo and 

Cabello, 2002; Böhrer et al., 2004) when demand for phosphorus is high (Sanders and 

Fitter, 1992). Likewise, AMF colonisation is also influenced by the host metabolic 

pathway (Wilson and Hartnett, 1997; Lugo et al., 2003; Busso et al., 2008; Collins and 

Foster, 2009), because the growth responses of AMF fungal species depend on the 

particular host/fungus combination, i.e. whether the host species is a facultative (C3) or 

an obligate (C4) mycotroph. So, some symbiotic relationships are more favoured than 

others. Nutrient exchanges (Eom et al., 2000; Titus and Leps, 2000) and climatic 

variations (Kachi and Rorison, 1990; Heinemeyer and Fitter, 2004; Gavito et al., 2005) 

also have been reported to affect temporal changes in AMF colonisation.  

The Azores archipelago has an extended area of grasslands (Martins, 1993), including 

natural grasslands, semi-natural pastures and intensive pastures (see Borges et al., 

2008). Through time, native forests have been destroyed by human activities and 

replaced by agricultural land. After several economic cycles and some catastrophic 

experiences with different types of monocultures (e.g. wheat Triticum spp.; "Pastel" 

Isatis tinctoria L. and; orange-tree Citrus spp.) (Martins, 1993) during the second half of 

the 20th century cattle milk production has grown in importance (Martins, 1993; Borges, 

1997). In order to respond to the high density of cattle milk farms, pastures became the 

dominant landscape in the Azores archipelago, covering 67.7 % of the arable land, and 

there are also semi-natural pastures that comprise 11.2 % of the total area (Garcia and 

Furtado, 1991). Most semi-natural pasture are located at high altitude in recent infertile 

acidic volcanic soils (e.g. Terceira and Pico), or in more mature but still poor soils (e.g. 

S. Maria) (Borges, 1997). The floristic composition of pastures is dominated by 

introduced grasses and leguminous forbs, while native forbs (e.g. Lotus uliginosus), 

grasses, rushes, sedges and ferns are more frequent in the poorly managed, old, semi-

natural pastures (Borges, 1997). Relatively little is known about the AMF community 

structure in these agroecosystems and their role in maintaining pasture productivity. 



Chapter III

Whether there are differences in the AMF community between the semi-natural and 

intensively managed pastures is also unknown. Therefore, in order to better understand 

the basic biology of AMF and their role in these agroecosystems, it is necessary to 

analyse the AMF diversity and seasonal patterns of the AMF communities in these 

agroecosystems.  

Several approaches have been developed to study AMF community structure. 

Traditional studies on AMF diversity are based mainly on spore morphology (Walker, 

1992), but taxonomic identification of AMF spores collected directly from the field is 

quite difficult because they are often unidentifiable due to degradation or parasitisation 

by other organisms. Furthermore, as they are obligate symbionts, they cannot be 

cultivated in the absence of their host. Catch plants are often used to produce 

identifiable spores (Bever et al., 2001). Although useful for the isolation and 

propagation of some AMF species, this indirect culture strategy is time-consuming, and 

biases are often introduced by plant preferences for AMF species, different growth 

conditions, and other environmental factors, which hinder its suitability for the 

characterisation of AMF communities (Jansa et al., 2002; Oehl et al., 2003). 

Furthermore, mycorrhizal root colonisation results, as well as spore numbers (Clapp et 

al. 1995), do not necessarily reflect the AMF populations present in soils but only the 

sporulation stage of the AMF life cycle (a dormant phase) rather than the activity within 

a symbiosis. This results of fact, that not all AMF present as spores form active 

mycorrhizae and that many taxa present in roots may not be sporulating.  

Recently molecular methods based on the amplification of DNA from soil or roots by 

polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in combination with denaturing gradient gel 

electrophoresis (DGGE) have proved to be useful tools for characterising of AMF 

community (Kowalchuk et al. 2002; Ma et al. 2005; Santos et al. 2006). Kowalchuk et 

al. 2002 reported discrepancies between the AMF-like groups detected in spore 

population versus direct 18S rDNA (small subunit of ribosomal DNA) analyses of root 

material by DGGE, corroborating previous suggestions that spore inspection alone may 

poorly represent actual AMF population structure. Similarly, Zhu et al. (2007) found that 

PCR-DGGE profiles clearly revealed the difference between the native AMF 

community structures in roots at two different pH levels (5.0 and 6.0). They detected 

more bands in the samples from pH 5.0 pots than from pH 6.0 pots (Fig. 1), indicating 

higher diversity of the native AMF at pH 5.0, i.e. the pH value similar to their original 

environmental pH.

In this molecular approach, PCR amplicons sharing the same length are separated 

electrophoretically in a sequence-dependent manner based on their GC-content 

(Rodriguez-Echeverria et al. 2009). The increasing gradient of denaturing components 

along the gel causes the double-stranded amplicons to denature into single stranded 

DNA through melting domains that decrease their mobility (and thus their position in the 

gel). A GC-clamp attached to the 5’ end of one of the PCR primers prevents the 

amplicons from completely denaturing. Different sequences have different origins of 

melting domains and, consequently different positions in the gel where DNA fragments 

halt (Rodriguez-Echeverria et al. 2009). This strategy provides a robust means of 

detecting and identifying AMF-like species without the use of trap plant cultivation 

methods (Kowalchuk et al. 2002). 

The main objective of this study was to determine the effects of land use and the 

sampling time on the community structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi associated 

with Holcus lanatus L. (Poaceae) in two land use systems: semi-natural and intensive 

pastures. 

 
 
2. Materials and methods 

2.1. Experimental design 

AMF community structure was studied during two years (2006, 2007) in two land uses: 

semi-natural and intensive pastures. Two sites were selected in each land use type: 

Pico do Galhardo (PX) and Terra Brava (TB) in the semi-natural pastures; Agualva 1 

(RP1) and Agualva 2 (RP2) in the intensive pastures. In the first year of study, the study 

of AMF community structure was performed in two sampling dates (July and 

September), while in the second year of study was performed in August and November. 

Then, we have the fowling nested hierarchical design: 2 land uses x 2 sites x 2 

sampling dates. 

 

2.2. Site description  

This study was conducted in the Terceira Island, the third island of the Azorean 

archipelago in terms of size (402 km2). Terceira is a roundish island formed by four 

main volcanic complexes (Serra de Santa Bárbara, Serra do Morião, Pico Alto and 

Serra do Cume) (Zbyszewski et al., 1971). The highest point (Serra de S. Bárbara, 1023 

m) is simultaneously the most recent of the three major island’s complexes of 0.025 Ma 

B.P. (Martins, 1993). The eastern flatted part of the island is its older part of about 3.52

My (Borges et al., 2009). Recent historical volcanic activity is evident in the western part 

of the island, where several well preserved lava tubes and volcanic chimneys are 

present (Borges et al., 1993). The Azores archipelago have a temperate oceanic 

climate characterised by high levels of relative atmospheric humidity that could reach 

95% at high altitude native forests and ensures slight thermal variations throughout the 

year (Azevedo et al., 1999). The average temperature is 17.5° C in low altitudes, while 

the maximum temperature is in August and minimum in February (Azevedo, 1996). The 

pluviometric regime reaches its peak in January-February and minimum and July 

(Azevedo, 1996): Angra do Heroísmo (47 m): 969 mm year (140 mm in January and 40 

mm in July) and Serra de S. Bárbara (1,023 m): 3,000 mm year (Borges, 1997).  

The sampling areas were cattle-grazed upland pastures of two different types: semi-

natural pastures (managed for more than 50 years, with a higher diversity of grasses 

and forbs; see Borges and Brown 2001) and intensive pastures (managed for more 

than 20 years, characterised also by a poor vascular flora of five or less dominant 

species).The semi-natural pastures are included in a site of communitarian interest 

(SIC- Serra de Santa Barbara e Pico Alto) inside of Rede Natura 2000: Pico Galhardo 

(PX) (Latitude 38º 41’ 51.71’’ N; Longitude 27º 13’ 25.34’’ W) and Terra Brava (TB) 

(Latitude 38º 41’ 59.74’’ N; Longitude 27º 12’ 41.37’’ W) (Fig. 1). 

These pastures show a high floristic diversity, and they are dominated by the grasses 

Holcus lanatus and Agrostis castellana, perennial grasses that covers around 100% of 

sites (Dias, 1996; Borges, 1997).  Frequently present in these pastures are also other 

grasses like Anthoxanthum odoratum, Lolium multflorum, Holcus rigidus and Poa 

trivialis and spontaneous species without forage value as: Lotus uliginosus, Rumex 

acetosella ssp. angiocarpus, Potentilla anglica, Hydrocotyle vulgaris, Plantago 

lanceolata, Lobelia urens, Cerastium fontanum, Conyza bonariensis, Anagallis 

arvensis, Hypochoeris radicata, Ranunculus repens, Pteridium aquilinum, Juncus 

effusus (Dias, 1996; Borges, 1997).   

The intensive pastures are included on exotic forest of Eucalyptus sp.. Agualva 1(RP1) 

is located at: Latitude 38º 45’ 27.18’’ N; Longitude 27º 11’ 41.55’’ W; and Agualva 2 

(RP2) at: Latitude 38º 45’ 24.44’’ N; Longitude 27º 11’ 42.24’’ W  (Fig. 1). In these 

pastures the dominant grasses are usually Holcus lanatus and Lolium perenne (plant 

cover of 100%). Another species with high cover is Trifolium repens (Dias, 1996; 

Borges, 1997). In these pastures, other common species are: Plantago lanceolata,

Cyperus esculentus, Mentha suaveolens, Cerastium fontanum, Rumex conglomeratus, 

etc. (Dias, 1996; Borges, 1997). 

 

 

 

 

 

2.3. Study plant 

The Azorean pastures are dominated by Holcus lanatus L. a non-indigenous plant with 

a frequency more than 50% (Dias, 1996; Silva and Smith, 2006; Kueffer et al., 2010). In 

Terceira island in a total of 30 exotic vascular plants, H. lanatus L. was the third more 

frequent (Silva and Smith, 2006). This plant is a C3 perennial, 20–110 cm tall, tufted 

grass (Ross et al., 2003). It is very common, growing in all kinds of soil but the optimal 

growth occurs in moist conditions (Franco, 1984). H. lanatus grows well in very wet 

conditions and can survive moderate periods of drought (Franco, 1984).

2.4. Rhizosphere extraction 

Samples were collected in July 2006, September 2006, August 2007 and November 

2007. Holcus lanatus rhizospheric samples (including soil and root fragments) were 

collected at the depth of 20 cm. The distance between samples was approximately of 

15 meters approximately.  

 

 

2.5. Soil analyses 

The soils of semi-natural and intensive pastures are andossols and sandy-loam 

(Pinheiro, 1990). The soil analyses were performed only with soil samples collected in 

August 2007. The 10 samples of rhizospheric soil from each site were pooled and 

analysed as a single sample. Chemical soil parameters for each soil are presented in 

Table 1. They were measured in the University of Azores Soil Laboratory (CITA-A), 

according to standard methods. Potassium, calcium and magnesium were extracted 

with sodium acetate (1/5) at pH 7, and were determined using a Varian ICP atomic 

emission spectrophotometer. Soil pH was determined on a soil/water paste (1/2.5) and 

available phosphorus as described by Olsen and Sommers (1982) by extraction with a 

0.5 M NaHCO3 solution at pH 8.5, using AAS. Total soil nitrogen content was estimated 

using the Kjehldahl method (Allen, 1989). The organic carbon (OC) and organic matter 

(OM) present in the soil were estimated using the dry ashing method.

2.6. AMF root colonisation assessment 

The collected roots were stored in 50 % ethanol until staining. Roots were cleared in 

2.5% KOH for 1h at 90 ?C. Subsequently they were left to acidify overnight in 1% HCl. 

Staining was done with blue ink (Parker Quink) for 30 min at 60 ?C, followed by 

distaining  in lactoglycerol. The amount of colonisation was estimated using a grid-

intersect method with examination of 100 intersects under a compound microscope at 

200x magnification (McGonigle et al., 1990). Root-intersects that contained vesicles, 

arbuscules or hyphae were scored as mycorrhizal. The decision to score hyphae as 

mycorrhizal was based on the absence of septate hyphae, and to presence of vesicles, 

arbuscules and spores associated. In total, 80 samples were examined to score 100 

intersections in each (McGonigle et al., 1990). 

 

 

2.7. Diversity of AMF communities 

2.7.1. Root sampling  

In each sampling date (July-September/2006; August-November/2007) five out of ten 

samples of Holcus. lanatus roots collected from field were randomly selected. A total of 

80 sampled roots were used for the molecular analysis. About 1g of fine roots per 

sample were stained with ink (see above) to access AMF colonisation and the 

remaining preserved in alcohol 48%, until to be use to DNA extraction.  

 

 

2.7.2. DNA extraction from roots 

DNA was extracted from 80 samples of H. lanatus roots using the REDExtract-N-Amp 

Plant PCR KIT (Sigma). Aliquots (1 g) of fresh roots sampled in each sample were firstly 

carefully cleaned with tap water and washed several times with sterile water to remove 

the alcohol, and then finely crushed, macerated and transferred into a 1,5-ml Eppendorf 

tube. After adding an equal volume of glass beads, the roots were macerated again, 

and stirred in a vortex for 4 min. Afterwards, 200 µl of extraction solution was added to 

the extraction mix and the roots were incubated at 60 ?C for 30 min. Then a dilution 

solution was added (200 µl) to the roots, and the mix was stirred in a vortex for 30 sec. 

The supernatant was separated by root fragments by centrifugation (8000 r.p.m) and a 

4 µl aliquot was used for PCR amplification of 28 S ribosomal subunit gene.

2.7.3. PCR and DGGE analysis 

A nested-PCR was used to selectively amplify fungal DNA from the extracts. The DNA 

purified was used to the first PCR amplification of the 5’ end of Large subunit of rDNA 

(LSU rDNA) sequences. We used the primers LR1 (Trouvelot et al. 1999) specific of 

eukaryotic and FLR2 (van Tuinen et al. 1998) specific of fungi. A 25 µl reaction mix 

contained 12.5 µl of Red Extract solution, 1.25 µl each primer and 5 µl of PCR-grade 

water. PCR was performed on a Gene Amp. PCR system 2700 Thermo Cycler (Applied 

Biosystems, Faster City, California) and the program was a followed: 93 ?C for 1 min, 58 

?C for 1 min and 72 ?C for 10 min (35 cycles), followed by 10 min at 72 ?C. The PCR 

products were used as templates for the second PCR with the primer FLR3-GC (FLR3 

plus a GC at the 5’ end) and FLR4 under the same PCR condition. FLR3 and FLR4 

were described by Gollote et al.(2004) as specific for Glomeromycota fungi. The PCR 

products were run on 2 % (W/V) agarose gel in 1 X TAE buffer and visualised under UV 

light after staining with ethidium bromide. About 0.4 µg of DNA from each sample was 

used for DGGE analysis (Rodriguez-Echeverria et al. 2009). Gels contained 8% (w/v) 

polyacrylamide (37:1 acrylamide/bis-acrylamide) and 1 X TAE. The linear gradient used 

was from 27% to 43% denaturant, where 100% denaturing is defined as containing 7M 

urea and 40% (v/v) formamide (Muyzer &amp;amp; Smalla, 1998). Electrophoresis was run at 

20V for 15 min, and afterwards at 200V for 330 min with a constant temperature of 60 

?C in a DGGE-2401 system from CBS Scientific (CA, USA). Afterwards, gels were 

stained with ethidium bromide and visualized in a UV transilluminator. Digital images 

were captured using a Vilber Loumat system and analyzed with GelCompar II version 

4.0 (Applie dMaths, Kortrijk, Belgium). 

 

 

2.8. Detection of dominant AMF species (Development of molecular markers) 

2.8.1. Establishment of trap culture 

Trap culture were established from fresh soil samples collected from each field site, 

mixed with sterilised sand and volcanic soil (“bagacina”) in a ratio of 2:1:1. A 1.5 Kg 

aliquot of the mixture was placed in each pot to produce culture from each sample. Zea 

mays L. was used as host plant. Seeds of Zea mays L. were surface sterilised by 

immersion in 96% alcohol for 30 sec, 0.4% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min and rinsed 

twice in sterile distilled water. They were then sown in pots on a sterilised sand soil and 

left to germinate in greenhouse. After 1 week of growth, seedlings were transplanted to

the pots. Trap cultures in 40 pots (10/field site) were grown in a glasshouse for 5 month 

and then harvested. All pots were watered every 2 days with distilled water, and no 

nutrient solution was added to the pots. After 4 month of sowing we left watering the 

pots to stimulate the sporulation. 

 

 

2.8.2. Spore assessment 

 AMF spores produced in the trap culture were extracted by sieving and decanting 

(Gerdemann and Nicolson, 1963). The procedure included the passage of 50 cm3 of 

harvested trap culture substrate from each pot through 1000-, 500-, 250-, 100-, and 45 

µm sieves. The material retained in 250 µm, 100 µm and 45 µm was collected to 

different petri dish and AMF spores were counted under a stereoscopic microscope 

(Leica MZ 12). 

 

 

2.8.3. Culture of AMF  

Seeds of H. lanatus were surface sterilised using the same procedure applied to the Z. 

mays seeds (see above). Then, they were sown in boards on a sterilised sand soil and 

left to germinate in greenhouse. After 1 week of growth, seedlings were transplanted to 

pots containing 1.5 Kg of sterilised soil. Their roots were then carefully exposed and 250 

spores and 1g colonised root pieces obtained from trapping or sieved materials were 

pipetted on to them. Sterilised sand was added to the surface of each pot to reduce the 

risk of cross-contamination. All pots were watered every 2 days and fertilized with 

Hoaglands-billeason nutrient solution monthly. Plants were harvested 5-6 months after 

sowing. 

 

2.8.4. DNA extraction 

DNA from 14 samples of Holcus lanatus roots collected from a trap culture was 

extracted using the REDExtract-N-Amp Plant PCR KIT (Sigma) following the protocol 

described above.

2.8.5. PCR amplification 

The DNA isolated from the roots of Holcus lanatus collected from a trap culture was 

subject to a first PCR using the primer pair LR1/FLR2. A 20 µl reaction mix contained 10 

µl of Red Extract solution, 1 µl each primer and 4 µl of PCR-grade water. PCR was 

performed on a Gene Amp. PCR system 2700 Thermo Cycler (Applied Biosystems, 

Faster City, California) and the program was a followed: 93 ?C for 1 min, 58 ?C for 1 min 

and 72 ?C for 10 min (35 cycles), followed by 10 min at 72 ?C. The PCR products were 

used as templates for the second PCR with the primer pair FLR3/FLR4 under the same 

PCR condition. The PCR products were run on 2 % agarose gel in 1 X TAE buffer and 

visualised under UV light after staining with ethidium bromide.  

 

 

2.8.6. DNA purification and sequencing 

The PCR products generated from roots of Holcus lanatus using the primers FLR3 and 

FLR4 were purified using GenElute PCR Clean-up Kit (Sigma) with a final elution 

volume of 30 µl, and then sequenced on MegaBace using the DYEnamic ET Dye 

Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequences 

were compared to known sequences using BLASTN. 

Using the sequence information we designed using Citing Primer3 software the primer 

pair to specifically amplify five disjunctive groups of AMF (Table 2). The primers were 

synthesized from Sigma-Genosys Ltd

2.8.7. Molecular identification of AMF in the roots 

DNA extracted from the 80 H. lanatus samples roots collected from field sites, was first 

used in the same nested PCR protocol as previously described to confirm the AMF 

presence on roots. After that, five separated PCR reactions were performed with five 

different primer pairs (Table 2) on each DNA sample. Presence/absence of reaction 

product was scored after electrophoresis of a 5 µl aliquot on 2% agarose gel in 1 x 

buffer and visualised under UV light after staining with ethidium bromide. 

 

 

2.9. Data analysis 

The sampling design was nested hierarchical design, with sampling date nested within 

field sites and field sites nested within land use. Then, to investigate the variation on 

percentage of colonisation of different AMF structures between land uses, between field 

sites within each land use and between sampling dates within each sites we used 

Nested ANOVA (Minitab, version 13.31, 2000). AMF diversity was estimated via the 

number of bands with different positions in the acrylamide gel per sample and 

subsequently per field site and land use. Then, a Nested ANOVA was performed to 

estimate de variation on species richness between land uses, between field sites within 

each land use and between sampling dates within each field site. The same proceed 

was made to investigate the variation on occurrence of five AMF species (Glomus 

etunicatum, Glomus intraradices, Glomus mosseae, Glomus claroideum and Glomus 

microaggregatum) between land uses, between field sites within each land use and 

between sampling dates within each field site. All data were tested for normality, and 

data of percentage of colonisation of different AMF structures were arcsine-transformed 

when required to fulfil assumptions of the Nested ANOVA. Since only complete abiotic 

data were available for the year 2007, the correlation analyses between the abiotic 

factors and the proportion of colonisation of different AM structures and between 

occurrence of five AMF species (G. etunicatum, G. intraradices, G. mosseae, G. 

claroideum and G. microaggregatum) were only performed for the 2007 data using the 

Pearson correlation coefficient.

3. Results 

 

3.1. Root colonisation 

Over this study the percentage of AMF colonisation was strongly influenced by the land 

use and the month/season in which the harvest took place within each local (Table 3). 

Thus, for the first year of study (2006), we found that the percentage of AMF 

colonisation varied significantly between land use (Nested Anova: F= 31.43; d.f= 1. 2; 

p&amp;lt;0.001), with the sampling time (Nested Anova: F= 5.72; d.f= 4. 72; p&amp;lt;0.001) as well 

as between field sites with each land use (Nested Anova: F= 4.43; d.f=2. 4; p= 0.01) 

(Table 3). The average percentage of AMF colonisation was higher in the first sampling 

date (July, 2006) than the second (September, 2006) in the semi-natural land use 

especially in TB field site (Fig. 2 a; 2 b). The same result was obtained to percentage of 

AM hyphal colonisation, which also varied significantly between land use (Nested 

Anova: F= 33.61; d.f= 1. 2; p&amp;lt;0.001), with the sampling time (Nested Anova: F= 5.86; 

d.f= 4. 72; p&amp;lt;0.001) as well as between field sites with each land use (Nested Anova: 

F= 4.53; d.f=2. 4; p= 0.01) (Table 3). The average percentage of AMF colonisation was 

higher in the first sampling date (July, 2006) than the second (September, 2006) in the 

semi-natural land use especially in TB field site (Fig. 2 a; 2 b).  

The percentage of AMF vesicle colonisation varied significantly between land use 

(Nested Anova: F= 39.10; d.f= 1. 2; p&amp;lt;0.001) and between field sites within each land 

uses (Nested Anova: F=5.07; d.f= 2. 4; p= 0.009) (Table 3). The average percentage of 

AMF vesicle colonisation was higher in the semi-natural than in the intensive land use 

particularly in PX field site (Fig. 2 a; 2 b).

However, there were no significant differences between sampling dates in each field 

sites (Nested Anova: F= 0.79; d.f= 4. 72; p= 0.54).The same pattern of results was 

observed for the percentage of AMF arbuscule colonisation, which varied significantly 

between field sites within each land use (Nested Anova: F= 7.93; d.f= 2, 4; p= 0.001) 

and between land uses (Nested Anova: F= 5.89; d.f= 1. 2; p= 0.02) (Table 3). The 

average percentage of AMF arbuscule colonisation was higher in the semi-natural than 

in the intensive land use especially in TB field site (Fig. 2a, b). However, there were no 

significant differences between sampling dates in each field sites (Nested Anova: F= 

0.18; d.f= 4. 72; p= 0.95). 

For the second year of harvesting (2007) the AMF colonisation also varied significantly 

between land uses (Nested Anova: F= 151.18; d.f= 1. 2; p&amp;lt;0.001), with the sampling 

date in each field site (Nested Anova: F= 4.97; d.f= 4. 72; p= 0.001) (Table 3), and 

between field sites with each land use (Nested Anova: F= 4.68; d.f= 2. 4; p= 0.01) 

(Table 3).  

In fact, the average percentage of AMF colonisation in the first sampling date (August, 

2007) was higher than in the second (November, 2007) in all field sites, and was also 

higher in sites of semi-natural pasture compared to the sites of intensive pasture (Fig. 

2c; 2d). The same result was observed in the percentage of AMF hyphal colonisation, 

which varied significantly between land use (Nested Anova: F= 95.67; d.f= 1. 2; p&amp;lt;

0.001), with the harvest date in each field site (Nested Anova: F= 5.46; d.f= 4. 72; p= 

0.001) and between field sites within each land use (Nested Anova: F= 3.68; d.f= 2. 4; 

p= 0.03) (Table 3). The average percentage of AMF hyphal colonisation in the semi-

natural land use was higher than in intensive particularly in the summer harvest 

(August, 2007) in all field sites (Fig. 2c, 2d). The percentage of AMF vesicle varied 

significantly between land uses (Nested Anova: F= 26.53; d.f= 1. 2; p&amp;lt;0.001), with the 

sampling time in each field site (Nested Anova: F= 4.29; d.f= 4. 72; p= 0.004) and 

between field sites within each land use (Nested Anova: F=3.35; d.f= 2. 4; p= 0.04) 

(Table 3).

The average percentage of AMF vesicle colonisation in the semi-natural land use was 

higher than in the intensive in the first harvest (August, 2007) in all field sites, especially 

in PX (Fig. 2 c). Finally, the percentage of AMF arbuscule colonisation also varied 

significantly between land uses (Nested Anova: F= 13.36; d.f= 1. 2; p&amp;lt;0.001) and with 

the time of sampling within each field site (Nested Anova: F= 5.64; d.f= 4. 72; p= 0.001) 

(Table 3). 

 

The average percentage of AMF arbuscule colonisation in the semi-natural land use 

was higher than in the intensive especially in the first harvest (August, 2007). However, 

there were no significant differences between field sites within each land use (Nested 

Anova: F= 2.94; d.f= 2. 4; p= 0.06) (Table 3).  

 

 

3.2. Species richness 

A total of 80 root collected in 2006/2007 was subjected to DNA extraction. PCR 

products of the expected size were obtained from a total of 66 samples (82.5% of 

roots). The 80 root samples produced a total of 214 bands of AMF, 58% of them in 

2007.

Over the two years of study the species richness exhibited the same pattern of result. 

Thus, in the first year (2006) the species number varied significantly between field sites 

within each land use (Nested Anova: F= 7.47; d.f= 2. 4; p= 0.002) and with the sampling 

time in each field site (Nested Anova: F= 4.30; d.f= 4. 29; p= 0.003) (Table 4). The 

average of species richness was higher in PX and RP1, especially in the second 

sampling time (September). Indeed, bands of AMF were detected in 100 % of 

September samples, but only in 35 % of the samples taken in July. 

Although the number of detected AMF bands having been higher in semi-natural (51 

bands) than in intensive (42 bands), we did not found significant differences between 

land uses (Nested Anova: F= 1.51; d.f= 1. 2; p= 0.23) (Table 4). However, the number 

of bands/sample was higher in the semi-natural land use than in the intensive (Fig. 3 a). 

In the second year (2007) the species number also varied significantly between field 

sites within each land use (Nested Anova: F= 10.10; d.f= 2. 4; p&amp;lt;0.001) and with the 

sampling time in each field site (Nested Anova: F= 4.31; d.f= 4. 32; p= 0.007) (Table 4). 

The average of species richness was higher in TB and in RP1, especially in the first 

sampling time (August). Indeed, in August we detected 83 bands of AMF against 47 

detected in November, i.e. about the double of the bands were detected in summer. 

Again, there were no significant differences between land uses (Nested Anova: F= 0.36; 

d.f= 1. 2; p= 0.55) (Table 4). In fact the number of bands per land use was very similar, 

a total of 69 and 61 bands of AMF were detected in semi-natural and intensive land 

uses respectively. Nevertheless, the number of bands/sample was in the semi-natural 

land use than in intensive Fig. 3 b). Thus, seems that in the intensive land use the 

plants are colonised by dominant AMF species.

1.07; d.f= 4, 32; p= 0.39) (Table 5), as well as between land uses (Nested Anova: F= 

0.20; d.f= 1. 2; p= 0.66) (Table 5). 

However, when we separately analysed the presence of each species there were 

significant differences between sampling dates. In the first year of our study the 

presence of G. etunicatum varied significantly with the harvest date within each field site 

(Nested Anova: F= 2.67; d.f= 4. 32; p= 0.05) (Table 5). The occurrence of G. 

etunicatum in the first sampling date (July, 2006) was higher than the in second 

(September, 2006) in all field sites (Fig 5 a). G. etunicatum was one of the dominant 

species, present in 100% of all samples in July, and only in 70% in September. 

However, there were no significant differences between land uses (Nested Anova: F= 

0.89; d.f=1. 2; p= 0.35) (Table 5) or between field sites within each land use (Nested 

Anova: F= 0.89; d.f= 2. 4; p= 0.42). The occurrence of G. intraradices varied 

significantly with the sampling time in each field site (Nested Anova: F= 4.50; d.f= 4. 32; 

p= 0.005), between land uses (Nested Anova: F= 4.17; d.f=1. 2; p= 0.05) as between 

field sites within each land use (Nested Anova: F= 4.17; d.f= 2. 4; p= 0.02) (Table 5). In 

fact, this species was mostly found in the second month of sample collection particularly 

in the intensive land use (Fig. 5 b).  

The presence of G. intraradices in all the samples increased from 15% in July to 60% in 

September.  

Moreover, the occurrence of G. mosseae (Fig. 5 c) did not vary with the sampling date 

within each field site (Nested Anova: F= 1.00; d.f= 4. 32; p= 0.42) (Table 5), or between 

field sites within each land use (Nested Anova: F= 1.00; d.f= 2. 4; p= 0.38) (Table 5), as 

well as between land uses (Nested Anova: F= 0; d.f= 1. 2; p= 1.00) (Table 5). Like G. 

etunicatum, this species was one of the dominants, being present in the same 

frequency of occurrence (95%) in two sampling dates. G. claroideum (Fig. 5 d) 

presence varied significantly between land uses (Nested Anova: F= 5.33; d.f=1. 2; p= 

0.03) and with the date of harvest within each site (Nested Anova: F= 2.67; d.f= 4. 32; 

p= 0.05) (Table 5). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



Chapter III

In fact, this species only occurred in semi-natural land use in the first year of study, and 

its frequency of occurrence was higher in the second sampling date (10% in 

September) than in the first (5 % in July). The presence of G. microaggregatum (Fig. 5 

e) did not vary significantly with the sampling date in each field site (Nested Anova: F= 

2.25; d.f= 4. 32; p= 0.09) (Table 5) or between field sites within each land use (Nested 

Anova: F= 1.25; d.f= 2. 4; p= 0.30) (Table 5), as well as between land uses (Nested

Regarding the presence of our 5 species, we verified that the occurrence of G. 

etunicatum varied significantly with the sampling date in each field site (Nested Anova: 

F= 3,00; d.f= 4. 32; p&amp;lt;0.03) (Table 6). The occurrence of this species in the first date of 

harvest was higher than in the second in TB and RP2, but the opposite was found in 

sites PX and RP1 (Fig. 6 a). G. etunicatum remained the dominant species, with a 

frequency of occurrence of 80% in August and 70% in November. 

However, no significant differences were found in the presence of G. etunicatum 

between field sites within each land use (Nested Anova: F= 2.67; d.f= 2. 4; p= 0.09) 

(Table 6), or between land uses (Nested Anova: F= 0.67; d.f= 1. 2; p= 0.42) (Table 6). 

A similar result was found to G. intraradices; the presence of this species varied 

significantly with the sampling date in field each site (Nested Anova: F= 2.57; d.f= 4. 32; 

p&amp;lt;0.05) (Table 6). The occurrence of this species in the first date of harvest was higher 

than the second in PX and RP1, but it was found the opposite in sites TB and RP2 (Fig. 

6 b). However, no significant differences were detected in the presence of G. 

intraradices between field sites within each land use (Nested Anova: F= 2.86; d.f= 2. 4; 

p= 0.07) or between land uses (Nested Anova: F= 0; d.f= 1, 2; p= 1.00) (Table 6). The 

presence of G. mosseae (Fig. 6 c) did not vary significantly with the sampling date 

within each field site (Nested Anova: F= 0.93; d.f= 4. 32; p= 0.46) or between field sites 

within each land use (Nested Anova: F= 0.67; d.f= 2. 4; p= 0.52) as well as between 

land uses (Nested Anova: F= 0.13; d.f= 1. 2; p= 0.72) (Table 6). As in the first year of 

study, G. mosseae continued to be one of the dominant species, and showed little 

changes in its occurrence between the two harvesting dates (80% in August and 70% in 

November). 

A similar result was found for G. claroideum (Fig. 6 d), which did not vary significantly 

with the harvest date in each field site (Nested Anova: F= 1.00; d.f= 4. 32; p= 0.42) or 

between field sites within each land use (Nested Anova: F= 0.33; d.f= 2. 4; p= 0.72) as 

well as between land uses (Nested Anova: F= 0.33; d.f= 1. 2; p= 0.57) (Table 6). 

Finally, the presence of G. microaggregatum varied significantly between land uses 

(Nested Anova: F=32.67; d.f= 1. 2; p&lt;0.001) with the sampling date within each field 

site (Nested Anova: F= 19.33; d.f= 4. 32; p&amp;lt;0.001) and between field sites within each 

land use (Nested Anova: F=6.00; d.f= 2. 4; p= 0.006) (Table 6). This species was only 

present in the first harvest date in semi-natural field sites, showing a frequency of 

occurrence of 35 % in PX and TB (Fig. 6 e).

3.4. Soil nutrient parameters 

The correlation coefficient of soil nutrient parameters which influenced the percentage 

of AMF colonisation during the first sampling date of 2007 (August) is present in Table 

7. The percentage of AMF colonisation was significantly correlated with all soil nutrients 

except phosphorus. The percentage of AMF colonisation was significantly positive 

correlated with K (r= 0.793), N (r= 0.624), OM (r= 0.708), Ca (r= 0.836), Mg (r= 0.805) 

and OC (r= 0.699) at p&amp;lt;0.001. A similar result was obtained with the percentage of 

hypal colonisation, which was significantly correlated with K (r= 0.713, p&amp;lt;0.001), N (r= 

0.449, p&amp;lt;0.01), OM (r= 0.532, p&amp;lt;0.001), Ca (r= 0.698, p&amp;lt;0.001), Mg (r= 0.805, p&amp;lt;

0.001) and OC (r= 0.711, p&amp;lt;0.001). The percentage of vesicle colonisation also 

exhibited significant correlation with K (r= 0.344, p&amp;lt;0.05), OM (r= 0.307, p&amp;lt;0.05), Ca 

(r= 0.380, p&amp;lt;0.05), Mg (r= 0.366, p&amp;lt;0.05) and OC (r= 0.314, p&amp;lt;0.05). At the same 

time, percentage of arbuscule colonisation was significantly positive correlated with K 

(r= 0.468, p&amp;lt;0.01), N (r= 0.385, p&amp;lt;0.05), OM (r= 0.438, p&amp;lt;0.01), Ca (r= 0.509, p&amp;lt;

0.01), Mg (r= 0.496, p&amp;lt;0.01) and OC (r= 0.442, p&amp;lt;0.01).

The phosphorus content of soil expressed significant positive correlation with K (r= 

0.389, p&amp;lt;0.05), N (r= 0.408, p&amp;lt;0.01) OM (r= 0.346, p&amp;lt;0.05) and OC (r= 0.439, p&amp;lt;

0.01). The potassium content also showed positive and significant correlation with N (r= 

0.610), M.O (r= 0.712), Ca, Mg (r= 0.906) as well as with OC (r= 0.733) all at p&amp;lt;0.001. 

At the same time nitrogen content was significant correlated with OM (r= 0.986, p&amp;lt;

0,001), Ca (r= 0.805, p&amp;lt;0.001), Mg (r= 0.906, p&amp;lt;0.001) and OC (r= 0.986, p&amp;lt;0.001). 

Soil organic matter was significant correlated with Ca (r= 0.889, p&amp;lt;0.001), Mg (r= 

0.963, p&amp;lt;0.001), and OC (r= 0.995, p&amp;lt;0.001). The calcium content also had a positive 

and significant correlation with Mg (r= 0.976) and OC (r= 0.887) at p&amp;lt;0.001. Finally, the 

magnesium content of soil was significantly correlated with OC (r= 0.906, p&amp;lt;0.001). 

For the same sampling period, we also analysed the correlation between soil nutrients 

level and the total species occurrence of G. etunicatum, G. intraradices, G. mosseae, G. 

claroideum and G. microaggregatum present in each site within each land use (Table 

6). The total species occurrence was significantly correlated with N (r= 0.444); M.O (r= 

0.505), Ca (r= 0.523), Mg (r= 0.554) and C.O (r= 0.456) at p&amp;lt;0.05. However when we 

analysed each species separately, only the presence of two species seemed to be 

affected by soil nutrients, especially phosphorus (Table 8). This way, the occurrence of 

G. etunicatum was significantly and negative related with P (r= -0.558, p&amp;lt;0.05), and 

also the occurrence of G. intraradices had a negative and significant correlation with P 

(r= -0.574, p&amp;lt;0.01). 

The phosphorus content of soil expressed significant positive correlation with OC (r= 

0.439, p&amp;lt;0.05). The potassium content was positively correlated with N (r= 0.610, p&amp;lt;

0.01), OM (r= 0.712, p&amp;lt;0.001), Ca (r= 0.942, p&amp;lt;0.001), Mg (r= 0.852, p&amp;lt;0.001) as well 

as with OC (r= 0.986, p&amp;lt;0.001). At the same time N level was significantly positive 

correlated with OM (r= 0.986), Ca (r= 0.805) Mg (r= 0.906) and OC (r= 0.955) at p&amp;lt;

0.001. The organic matter of soil had positive and significant correlation with Ca (r= 

0.889, p&amp;lt;0.001), Mg (r= 0.963, p&amp;lt;0.001) and OC (r= 0.995, p&amp;lt;0.001). The calcium 

content was significantly positive correlated with Mg (r= 0.976, p&amp;lt;0.001) and with OC 

(r= 0.887, p&amp;lt;0.001). Finally Mg content was significantly positive correlated with OC (r= 

0.954, p&amp;lt;0.001).

4. Discussion 

 

Fungal intraradical structures  

For the first time in the Azores we provided key insights into patterns of root colonisation 

by AMF, which was strongly constrained by land use type. Over the two years of study, 

root colonisation was always higher in semi-natural land use than in intensively 

management pastures. This result is in agreement with those found by several authors. 

Among others, Eason et al. (1999) reported that AMF root colonisation was lower in 

grassland soils with a history of high-input and, conventional management than in soil 

with a low-input or organic management. Kahiluoto et al. (2001) demonstrated reduced 

AMF colonisation of roots and reduced AMF spore density in soil with increasing P 

fertilization for several crops on two soils with low and intermediate concentrations of 

available P. Similarly, Oehl et al. (2003) found higher colonisation levels in plants grown 

on organic soils compared to ones grown conventionally. Also Gryndler et al. (2006) 

found that long-term mineral fertilisation and manure addition had a negative effect on 

AMF root colonisation, measured by AMF hyphal length in soil. 

The abundance of fungal structure also showed a marked seasonality, particularly in the 

second year of study. This could have been related to nutrient exchanges, host plant 

phenology, host metabolic pathways and climatic variations (Titus and Leps, 2000; Lugo

and Cabello, 2002; Lugo et al., 2003; Bohrer et al., 2004; Heinemeyer and Fitter, 2004; 

Rodriguez-Echeverria et al., 2007). In the studied semi-natural and intensive pastures 

H. lanatus was the dominant species. This species is a weakly mycotrophic species as 

it is a C3 plant (Cornelissen et al., 2001). Allen and Allen (1988) postulated that the 

presence of facultative mycorrhizal plant species can result in increased mycorrhizal 

inoculum levels in disturbed soils, which may help obligatory mycorrhizal plant species 

to become established later in the succession. Egerton-Warburton et al. (2007) found a 

higher hyphal length in C3 plants than in C4 plants, and they suggested that this could 

be related with the greater energetic investment for carbon (C) and P acquisition from 

soil by C3 plants. Another possibility is the that phenological differences between C3 and 

C4 plants enhance the preemption of space; in other words, AMF in C3 plants take over 

any soil space vacated by AMF associated with C4 plants. 

All fungal structures (hyphae, vesicles and arbuscules) were more abundant in summer 

harvests. This result is consistent with Titus and Leps (2000) and Lugo et al. (2003). 

These authors found that in B. subaristata (C3) root colonisation measured as the 

number of arbuscules and vesicles changed with season and reached at maximum in 

summer. 

The abundance of intraradical structures is usually closely related to host growth, 

flowering and fruit production (Smith and Read, 1997). Thus the high percentage of 

AMF root colonisation in our summer sampling periods matches the start of the 

reproductive phase of Holcus lanatus at the sites. During flowering and/or fruiting the 

phosphorus demand is high and thus AMF colonisation levels were also high. This can 

also be demonstrated by the higher percentage of AMF arbuscule colonisation during 

this season. Likar et al. (2009) also found another peak in arbuscule formation during 

flowering, in Cruciata laevipes and Mentha piperata and argue that the rate of arbuscule 

formation can be enhanced during periods of extensive productivity in plants, such 

flowering. Arbuscules are the places where nutrients are exchanged between a plant 

and fungus, and a high percentage of AMF arbuscule colonisation indicates intense 

symbiotic activity (Titus and Leps, 2000; Greipsson and DiTommaso, 2006).  

 

Molecular diversity 

We found that AMF diversity in semi-natural pastures had a marked seasonal pattern. 

Over the two years of the study larger number of DGGE bands was found during the

summer, coinciding with the flowering and /fruiting phase of H. lanatus, i.e., the 

phenological stage during each nutrient demands are highest. 

However, among the two managements systems established there was a higher AMF 

diversity in semi-natural pastures than in intensively managed pastures, though the 

difference was not significant. Several authors reported larger AMF diversity for 

organically managed fields compared to conventionally managed fields. Among these, 

Oehl et al. (2003; 2004) found that the intensification of land use and conventional 

farming practices, as opposed to organic farming practices cause a reduction in AMF 

spore abundance and AMF species richness in agroecosystems of Central Europe. 

Rodriguez-Echeverria and Freitas (2006) also reported that the diversity associated with 

Ammophila arenaria ssp. arundinacea was higher in the least disturbed sites. However, 

our result is consistent with the work by Börstler et al. (2006) that found a similar 

diversity in intensively farmed fields (with 11 species) compared with the non-intensively 

farmed ones (with 10 species). Similarly, Galván et al. (2009) also found that AMF 

diversity of organically grown onions did not differ from that those conventionally grown. 

The similarity in species richness between land uses could be related to: a) the fact that 

the AMF communities are highly generalist; b) the levels of intensification of the well-

managed intensive pastures are low enough to allow similar patterns to semi-natural 

pastures. In Terceira, the influence of human activities on the simplification of 

ecosystems is quite dramatic with very few endemic arthropods occurring in intensive 

pastures (Cardoso et al., 2009). In fact, it is known that the input of fertilisers and 

pesticides and several other management practices (e.g., grazing intensity) are 

important in defining the quality of the pasturelands for AMF (e.g. Gange et al., 1993; 

Dhillion and Gardsjord, 2004). However, the input of fertilisers to Azorean pastureland is 

lower than average inputs to pastures on the European mainland (Garcia &amp;amp; Furtado, 

1991). This fact gives support to our second hypothesis, which means that at Terceira, 

both semi-natural and intensive pastures are reasonably benign habitats for AMF. 

On the other hand, certain lanes in some gels produced double bands. This is a well-

known and common problem when using DGGE, in which two bands with the same 

sequence can appear very close to each other (Ma et al., 2005; Santos et al., 2006). 

This observation may complicate the interpretation of field DGGE profiles, because any 

AMF isolate may represented by two or more bands. Therefore, the actual number of 

AMF in a field DGGE profile may be less than half of what is visually detected by 

DGGE.

Moreover, the molecular identification system used in this study is known to miss certain 

groups of AMF (Kr?ger et al., 2009). In general, the LSU rDNA region allows for 

species-level resolution, and thus, the LSU primer pair FLR3–FLR4 (Gollotte et al., 

2004) was used for species level community analyses. However, FLR4 in particular is 

not phylogenetically inclusive (Gamper et al., 2009) and it does not amplify many 

lineages, including Diversisporales, Archaeosporales and Paraglomerales, which results 

in a strong bias in community analyses towards the Glomeraceae. The primer FLR3 

binds to the DNA of many non-target fungi. It has no mismatch to more than 1300 

basidiomycete sequences and some ascomycete sequences in the public databases 

(Kr?ger et al., 2009). Therefore, it is very likely that this study has missed a 

considerable portion of the AMF diversity. 

Although AMF diversity did not differ between management systems, it varied between 

field sites within each land use. Our data unequivocally show that some arable soils 

show an unexpectedly high diversity of AMF (especially RP1), which is in strong 

contrast to the studies by Helgason et al. (1998) and Daniell et al. (2001). Hijri et al. 

(2006) also reported variation in AMF diversity within management systems. Despite 

having checked for differences between organic and conventional field sites, they also 

reported differences between two organic field sites. At lower AMF diversity was 

observed in conventional field sites and in one organic field site. These authors argue 

that, in some agroecosystems, the farming systems do not influence AMF diversity, but 

rather the specific management practices (e.g., crop rotation, tillage) or environmental 

conditions (pH, P) may contribute to the maintenance of a more diverse AMF 

community. In fact, RP1 had the lower level of phosphate in the soil and the two semi-

natural field sites had the higher levels. Thus, as high phosphate concentration is known 

to reduce AMF root colonisation, it is very likely that AMF diversity is concurrently 

reduced in these field sites. Moreover, in RP1, Trifolium repens is one of the most 

abundant species of plants, and it is know that the continuous cultivation of this plant 

might favour the presence of more AMF species in the long term (Gosling et al. 2006; 

Hijri et al. 2006).

Occurrence of G. etunicatum, G. intraradices, G. mosseae, G. claroideum and G. 

microaggregatum. 

 

In the present study, we only found isolates from the Glomaceae in H. lanatus roots. 

Previous studies have also showed that the genus Glomus is usually a dominant group 

in AMF communities in agricultural soil ecosystems (Helgason et al., 1998; Daniell et 

al., 2001; Jansan et al., 2002; Oehl et al., 2003, 2004; Mathimaran et al., 2005). Some 

Glomus species have high plasticity to a range of habitats and are present even in the 

most intensively managed fields. These species are typically called “AMF generalists” 

(Oehl et al., 2003).  

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi have distinct colonisation strategies that are related to 

taxonomic differences at the family level (Daniell et al., 2001). Hart and Reader (2002) 

showed that isolates of Glomaceae were faster colonisers than Acaulosporaceae and 

Gigasporaceae because they regenerate primarily from hyphal fragments and produce 

an extensive mycelium in roots rather than in soil. Furthermore, Giovannetti et al. (1999) 

have shown that Glomus (but not Gigaspora or Scutellospora) readily form 

anastomoses between mycelia and might therefore have the ability to re-establish an 

interconnected network after mechanical disruption. Such differences can explain the 

dominance of the Glomaceae over members of the Gigasporaceae in disturbed 

environments. On the other hand, the Glomales have traditionally been thought to be 

non-specific, but there is evidence suggesting that, while there may not be host 

specificity per se, partners may show preferences (van der Heijden et al., 1998). 

 Finally, the absence of other AMF species in this study could be related also to other 

factors, like the number of cycles of trap culture, sampling times, local environmental 

factors or host plant regulation of carbon expenditure, that enable the species to 

produce spores and persist as infective hyphae in roots or soil (Douds and Millner, 

1999). 

The total species occurrence (of the detected G. etunicatum, G. intraradices, G. 

mosseae, G. claroideum and G. microaggregatum) H. lanatus roots only varied with 

sampling date in the second year of study. Probably, the proximity of sampling periods 

in the first year (July and September) contributed to the lack of an evident seasonal 

pattern. Species occurrence was highest in August, coinciding with the reproductive 

phase of H. lanatus (Smith and Read, 1997; Titus and Leps, 2000; Lugo et al., 2003) 

and with the highest colonisation levels.

The occurrences of five AMF species varied with sampling time over the two years of 

study. Glomus mosseae was the most abundant and constant species, and it was the 

only species for which the frequency did not change with sampling time. Helgason et al. 

(1998) also found that in arable field sites the dominant arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal 

type was a putative G. mosseae. The same authors argue that the absence of this 

species in the woodland studied was related to differences in propagative units between 

glomalean families. In fact, this species sporulates abundantly and colonises readily 

from spores, which may be more important in a field that is ploughed annually than in a 

woodland. 

G. claroideum and G. microaggregatum were less abundant, both spatially and 

temporally, and can be considered as rare species in some of the sites sampled. The 

symbiotic performance of AMF isolates depends on two main parameters; colonisation 

ability and efficiency. The rate of colonisation is influenced by the ability of AMF to 

spread rapidly and extensively across plants and is affected by factors linked to spore 

germination, presymbiotic mycelial growth and appressorium formation (Avio et al., 

2006). In fact, G. mosseae and G. etunicatum were the two dominant species at all 

sampling dates; this may be related to competitive advantages for carbon uptake during 

early root colonisation by these species (Jansa et al., 2008).  

Jansa et al. (2008) observed that G. mosseae was the most effective competitor out of 

three AMF species (G. mosseae, G. intraradices, and G. claroideum) due to its fast rate 

of colonisation and early peak in colonisation. According to this same study, G. 

claroideum was the weakest competitor, and G. intraradices was intermediate between 

the two of them. 

Farmer et al., (2007) noted that in a study done under field conditions, G. etunicatum 

introduced either as a pure inoculum or mixed with G. mosseae and G. intraradices had 

great success and was, detected in the roots of nearly all samples. However, our results 

suggest that the high efficiency of G. etunicatum in establishing a mycorrhizal symbiosis 

could explain the cross contamination of G. mosseae during inoculation production. 

 

Soil parameters and root colonisation 

AMF root colonisation levels have been associated with soil nutrient acquisition in 

perennial grasses (Jackson and Caldwell, 1996). In fact, the percentage of all fungal 

structure and the total species occurrence (considering G. etunicatum, G. intraradices, 

G. mosseae, G. claroideum and G. microaggregatum) were positively correlated with

soil nutrient levels. Thus, the improvement of soil fertility, especially the availability of K, 

N, Ca and Mg, provided a favourable environment for mycorrhizal formation and 

function in these systems. A similar result was found by Oliveira and Oliveira (2005). 

These authors observed a strong influence of edaphic factors, such as soil moisture, 

pH, Mg, K and Mn on symbiotic associations in the acidic soils and nutrient-limited soils 

of Central Amazonia. Khanam et al. (2006) also noted a positive correlation between 

root colonisation and soil moisture, OM, total N and K. However, as shown in other 

studies (Mathimaran et al., 2005; Ezawa et al., 2005; Rodriguez-Echeverria et al., 

2009), a correlation between the percentage of AMF colonisation and soil P content was 

not found. The two investigated land uses (semi-natural and intensive pastures) had a 

soil P content clearly above the P concentrations that limit AMF colonisation and within 

the P concentrations that limit plant growth (P&amp;lt;10 ppm). Miller (2000) has speculated 

that the narrow ranges of P (0–35.8 ppm and 2.5–15.7 ppm, respectively) in their study 

sites caused the lack of a significant correlation between AMF colonisation and soil P. 

Johnson et al. (2003) reported an increased allocation to AMF structures with nitrogen 

enrichment in mesic grasslands where ambient soil nitrogen was highest and 

phosphorus availability lowest. These same authors point out that AMF responses to N 

and P enrichment are mediated by ambient N and P availability, and this response 

could be caused by allocation plasticity within individual AM fungal taxa, changes in the 

species composition of the AMF community, or both. 

Because the soil P levels are so low, and the range in soil P is so small in our study, it is 

not possible to speculate on whether or not large fluxes of P in other pastures habitats 

would significantly influence the extent of AMF colonisation at any given time.  

Nevertheless, the presence of two AMF species (G. etunicatum and G. intraradices) 

was negatively correlated with soil P content. This result contrasts with that of Johnson 

(1993), who showed that fertilisation of soils tended to decrease the abundance of AMF 

species such as Scutellospora calospora, and increase others like G. intraradices.  

In summary, this study shows that AMF diversity did not differ between semi-natural and 

intensively managed pastures, and that AMF communities associated with both pasture 

types are mainly dominated by five Glomus species. All of these species, except G. 

mosseae, show seasonal variations that are reflected in the variation of fungal 

structures found at different sampling times. These temporal changes in fungal 

structures are also related with plant phenology, showing that flowering is a time of high 

nutrient demand for the plant, which translates into a higher proportion of arbuscules

and a greater hyphal colonisation. This study also shows that the poorer soils were 

limiting for the development mycorrhizal fungi. Three of the five species found (G. 

mosseae, G. intraradices and G. etunicatum) were quite abundant in the studied 

systems, independent of soil management, therefore behaving as AMF generalists. The 

structure of mycorrhizal communities is complex even in recent habitats such as 

islands. Thus, to obtain a better understanding of the seasonal dynamics of AMF 

communities, more intensive sampling distributed throughout the season, with 

measures of both colonisation and species composition, as well as other ecological 

factors, would be necessary.

1. Introduction 

Nematodes are a major component of all soil food webs and thus comparisons of 

abundance, biomass and community structure can be made across ecosystems 

(Brussaard et al., 1997). However, it’s well know the damage that they cause to 

agriculture crops, which can be traduced into a decrease of plant productivity, 

disruption of plant nutrient and water transfer, as well as, a decrease of fruit and tuber 

quality and size (Sipes and Schmitt, 1994; Cofcewicz et al., 2001). Some studies, also 

have pointed to changes in composition of plant communities as consequence of 

feeding herbivores (de la Peña et al., 2006; Pi?kiewicz et al., 2008; Rodriguez-

Echeverria et al., 2009). 

De la Peña et al. (2006) showed that root feeding herbivores affected not only the 

plant performance of Ammophila arenaria in coastal dunes, but at same time altered 

the composition of plant communities. The same authors reported that mycorrhizal 

communities associated with the roots of A. arenaria were almost represented by 

Glomus sp. i.e. the genus with great plasticity to environmental disturb, and probably it 

represents the fraction of soil that can survive and grow to effect of root feeding 

herbivores. Thus, it’s seems that root feeding herbivores may have a selective 

pressure in AMF communities, benefiting the species considered “generalist” at the 

expense of the species classified as “rare” (Oehl et al., 2004). 

 An identical result was also reported by Rodriguez-Echneverria et al. (2009) who 

found that root-herbivores can alter mycorrhizal community associated to A. arenaria, 

although the total percentage of root colonisation is not affected by its presence. Since 

the degree of sensitive to herbivory varies among AMF species, the herbivore effect 

could benefit some AMF species in detriment of the other in terms of root colonisation. 

Various physical, chemical, and agronomic measures have been proposed to control 

root-nematode disease (van der Putten et al., 2006). Chemical nematicides are most 

effective in inhibiting nematode infestations but most of the active ingredients are 

prohibited due to their detrimental effects on human health and the environment. 

Agronomic practices including crop rotations, fallow, and cover crops can also reduce 

disease incidence but these methods are difficult to practice under Chinese conditions 

due to the limited land area and intensive cultivation systems. Biological control

techniques are preferable because of their limited effects on the environment and the 

land can be used continuously for economic production. 

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are ubiquitous plant mutualists which represent a 

large fraction of fungal biomass of the rhizosphere. These symbiotic organisms are 

found inside roots, in the rhizosphere itself and in the bulk soil, interacting in all these 

zones with other organism (Fitter and Garbaye, 1994; Azcón-Aguilar et al., 2002). The 

internal mycelium interacts principally with the root itself, but at the same time with 

other organism even pathogens fungi. The AMF external mycelium developed in the 

soil helping plant nutrient and water uptake, interacts with many organisms such 

bacterial, other fungi, protozoa, nematodes, arthropods and even large animal as 

mammals (Fitter and Garbaye, 1994; Azcón-Aguilar et al., 2002). Then, it’s well 

evident the several benefits that AMF may provide to their host plants, including better 

phosphorus (P) nutrition (Jaizme-Vega and Azcón-Aguilar, 1995; Guissou, 2009), 

increased abiotic stress (Augé, 2004; Smith et al., 2009) and increased disease 

resistance (Jaizme-Vega et al., 1998; Idoia et al., 2004; Al-Askar and Rashad, 2010). 

Due to these beneficial effects of AMF on host plants, they are suggested to have the 

potential to serve as both biological fertilisers and biological control agents (Barea et 

al., 2005; Mukhopadhyay and Maiti, 2009).  

Both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and root knot nematodes are indigenous soil 

organisms and share plant roots as resources of food. Consequently, there is interest 

in AM-nematode interactions because of the possibility of enhanced resistance or 

tolerance of AMF- infected plants to nematodes (Whipps, 2001; Hol and Cook, 2005). 

The mechanism proposed to explain this protective effect includes: direct competition; 

mechanism mediated by alteration in plant growth, nutrition and morphology; 

biochemical and molecular changes in mycorrhizal plants that induce pathogen 

resistance, and alterations in the soil microbiota and development of pathogens 

antagonism (Azcón-Aguilar et al., 2002; Vierheilig et al., 2008). 

However the control mechanisms of root-feeding nematodes appear to be dependent 

on the feeding type of the nematode i.e. if they are ectoparasites, sedentary 

endoparasites or migratory endoparasites (Borowicz, 2001; Hol and Cook, 2005; 

Wehner et al., 2010), as well as, on the species of nematode (de la Peña et al. 2006; 

Pi?kiewicz et al. 2008). In general interactions between AMF and ectoparasitic 

nematodes are less strong than those endoparasites, because ectoparasites feed on

superficial cells, and do not reach the cortical cells colonised by AMF. Thus, 

ectoparasitc nematodes are more likely to be affected indirectly by AMF-induced 

changes in plant physiology than directly by competition with the fungus (Hol and 

Cook, 2005). Sedentary endoparasites include two nematodes groups – root-knot and 

cyst nematodes, both induce changes in plant cells and feed on modified cells. The 

feeding cells induced within the vascular cylinder by these endoparasites may invade 

the endodermis and proliferate into the cortex, where we can find the cells colonised 

by AMF, occurring competition by space between these two organisms (Hol and Cook, 

2005). 

Finally de migratory endoparasites, such as root-lesion and burrowing nematodes feed 

and move within the cortex, thus they can feed on cells appropriate for AMF 

colonisation (Hol and Cook, 2005). On the other hand, AMF can change root 

morphology with consequences for penetration and movement of migratory 

nematodes. AMF will colonize much faster than nematode resulting in alteration of root 

physiology of host like increasing wall thickness and changing the chemical 

composition of root exudates. 

Much work has been done on AMF-nematode interactions especially on specific 

groups on nematodes, i.e. root-knot (Meloidogyne spp.) and root lesion (Pratylenchus 

spp.) nematodes given its economic importance. AMF have interactions with root 

nematodes of many crop plant species including fruit tree (Pinochet et al., 1996; 

Jaizme-Vega et al., 2005) banana (Jaizme-Vega et al., 1997; 2005), tomato 

(Cofcewicz et al., 2001; Shreenivasa et al., 2007) and cucumber plants (Zhang et al., 

2009).  

Jaizme-Vega et al. (1997) noted that inoculation with Glomus mosseae favours growth 

of banana plants by enhancing plant nutrition and by suppressing M. incognita 

reproduction and galling during the early stages of plant development. Shreenivasa et 

al. (2007) also reported that decrease on plant height, dry biomass weight as well as 

fruit weight in tomato plants infected with root-knot Meloidogyne incognita was 

minimized in presence of AMF. 

Jaizme-Vega and Pinochet (1997) point out that mycorrhizal inoculation on the first 

stages of banana’s development could increase host tolerance to P. goodeyi by 

enhancing plant nutrition and by reducing the nematode induced lesions in the root. 



Chapter IV____________   __________________________________ _________    ______________   _ 
 

138 

Also Elsen et al. (2008) noted that AMF have the ability to induce systemic resistance 

against plant parasitic nematodes in banana root system, since AMF reduced more 

than 50% the populations of two nematode Radopholus similis and P. coffeae. 

Likewise, Rodriguez-Echeverria et al. (2009) showed in inoculation experiment that 

Ammophila arenaria roots infection by P. penetrans and P. dunensis was reduced in 

all mycorrhizal plants when compared to no-mycorrhizal plants. 

The Azores archipelago has an extensive area of pastures, in these agroecosystems, 

herbivorous nematodes take up as much as one quarter of the net primary production 

(Stanton 1988). Rosa et al. (1996) in a study aiming to harvest and genetic 

characterization of entomopathogenic agents in the Azores, namely in Terceira, 

reported that 33.7 % of soil samples showed nematodes, most of them of free living 

and phytoparasitic, and 20% of which had been collected in pastures. In Azores 

evident effects of endoparasite nematodes, especially root-knot, have been detected 

in some horticulture crops such banana (Musa sp.), cucumber plants (Cuccumis melo 

L.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), but there is no peer-reviewed on subject. 

The first record of M. incognita in Azores islands, especially in S. Miguel, was made by 

Vovlas et al. (2004) in tabaco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). Little is known about how the 

variation of these plants along their range affects their relationship with root-feeding 

nematodes, as well as, with their symbiotic organism like AMF. This way, would be 

interesting to evaluate the potential contribute of indigenous AMF not only on 

nematode control but also in increasing productivity of these crops. Thus, a study was 

developed to assess the contribution of AMF in reducing nematode infection and 

reproduction by using Holcus lanatus, due its extensive occupation in Azorean lands 

(Dias, 1996; Silva and Smith, 2006; Kueffer et al., 2010). 

 

2. Material and methods 

2.1. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 

In July of 2006, soil was collected from the rhizosphere of ten different H. lanatus 

plants in Pico Galhardo (PX), Terra Brava (TB), Agualva RP1 (RP1) and Agualva 

(RP2) and used to set up trap cultures of the AMF community. The fresh soil samples 

were mixed with autoclaved sand and “bagacina” (volcanic soil type) in a ratio of 2:1:1. 

A 1.5-kg aliquot of the mixture was placed in each pot to produce trap culture from

each sample. Corn (Zea mays L.) was used as host plant. Seeds of corn were surface 

sterilised by immersion in alcohol (96 %) for 30 sec, 4 % bleach for 2 min, and rinsed 

twice in sterile distilled water. Then, they were sown in pots on sterilized sand soil and 

left to germinated in the greenhouse. After one week of growth, seedlings were 

transplanted to pots containing the fresh soil samples mix. A total of 4 seedlings were 

used per plot. Trap cultures in 40 plots were grown in glasshouse for 5 months and 

then harvested. All pots were watered every 2 days with distilled water, and no nutrient 

solution was added to the pots. After 4 month of sowing we left watering the pots to 

stimulate the sporulation. 

 

2.2. AMF root colonisation assessment 

After 5 months, plants were harvested and root examined to confirm AMF colonisation. 

A portion of roots were cleared in 2.5% KOH for 1h at 90 ?C. Subsequently they were 

left to acidify overnight in 1% HCl. Staining was done with blue ink (Parker Quink) for 

30 min at 60 ?C, followed by distaining  in lactoglycerol. The amount of colonisation 

was estimated using a grid-intersect method with examination of 100 intersects under 

a compound microscope at 200x magnification (McGonigle et al., 1990). Root-

intersects that contained vesicles, arbuscules or hyphae were scored as mycorrhizal. 

The remaining corn roots were cut into 2-cm pieces, and disinfected by immersion in 2 

% chloramines T for 3 min and in an antibiotic solution (streptomycin 200 mg l-1 + 

penicillin 100 mg l-1) for 3 h. After this time root were rinsed in autoclaved water and 

dried (de la Peña et al., 2006). 

 

2.3. Spore assessment 

AMF spores produced in the trap culture were extracted by sieving and decanting 

(Gerdemann and Nicolson, 1963). The procedure included the passage of 50 cm3 of 

harvested trap culture substrate from each pot through 1000-, 500-, 250-, 100-, and 45 

µm sieves. The material retained in 250 µm, 100 µm and 45 µm was collected to 

different petri dish and AMF spores were counted under a stereoscopic microscope 

(Leica MZ 12). Spores from 4 genera were detected in trap culture, namely 

Acaulospora, Ambispora, Glomus and Scutellospora.

2.4. Nematode inoculation procedure 

The nematode inoculum consisted of a population of Meloidogyne incognita isolated 

from a culture of tomato originally collected in the North-East of Tenerife (Valle de 

Guerra). The nematode inoculum was prepared by macerating infected roots in a 

blender for 15 s at 14 500 rpm in a 0.12 - 0.15% NaClO solution (Hussey and Barker, 

1973). Eggs and juveniles (J2) were collected using a 25-µm-pore sieve and rinsed 

with tap water. The inoculum was adjusted to deliver a suspension of 1150 nematodes 

per plot through two 3 cm deep holes located at 5 cm distance from the base of the 

plant in the nematode treatments. 

 

2.5. Experiment 

Seeds of H. lanatus were surface sterilised by immersion in 96% alcohol for 30 sec, 

0.4% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min and rinsed twice in sterile distilled water. They 

were then sown in boards on a sterilised sand soil and left to germinate in greenhouse. 

After 2 week of growth, seedlings were transplanted to the pots. Four seedlings of H. 

lanatus were planted in 2-l pots filled with a pasteurized substrate contained, soil, sand 

and “bagagina” (volcanic soil type) in a ratio of 2:1:1 soil.  

The experiment include four treatments with 14 replicates per treatment: an 

uninoculated control (C), inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), 

inoculation with M. incognita (Mi), simultaneous inoculation with AMF and M. incognita 

(AMF + Mi). At the time of H. lanatus seedling transplantation’s each pot for inoculation 

with AMF, as well as, for combined inoculation with AMF and M. incognita received 

250 spores and 1g of dried corn roots from trap cultures, which was used as AMF 

inoculum. We also inoculated four additional plots with AMF inoculum, to assessment 

the mycorrhizal colonisation after 2 weeks and 4 weeks after inoculation. Plots were 

disposed in the greenhouse in a completely randomised design. Every 2 days pots 

were watered and one time per month they were fertilized with 100 ml of half-strength 

modified (P-free) Hoagland’s solution. Afterwards, the H. lanatus seedlings were left to 

growth for 6 additional weeks to obtain roots enough to split.

plants; H.l+M.i – plants inoculated with M. incognita; H.l+AMF+m.i- plants inoculated with M. 

incognita and AMF. 

  

Then, after the AMF colonisation has been confirmed the roots of each plant were 

placed into a new plot with a sterilised mixture composed by sand, “bagacina” and soil 

in a ratio of 3:1:1. The substrate surface was then covered by a volcanic ash layer in 

order to keep the substrate humid and avoid the contamination. Ten days later we 

proceed to the inoculation with M. incognita, which consisted in adding 10 ml of 

nematode suspension to each plot. The experiment was conducted from June 2007 

until October 2007. 

 

2.6. Harvest and data collection 

Plants from experiment were harvested 14 weeks after nematode inoculation. The 

following physical parameters were measured: fresh root weight, aerial fresh root 

weight, total fresh root weight (aerial and root) and aerial dry weight. After taking the 

root fraction for assessing AMF colonisation (5% in fresh weight), the remaining plant 

material was dried at 72 ºC for 48 h to estimate plant biomass. AMF colonisation was 

determined by the same method used for assess mycorrhizal infection in H. lanatus 

roots from trap culture (see above). 

For nematode were estimated the following parameters: the number of nematode per 

gram of root, number of nematode per root and the reproduction rate (final 

population/initial population). The nematode extraction method from roots was similar 

to that used for inoculums preparation. Nematodes were concentrated using 150-, 74-

and 25-µm-pore sieves. The suspension of 25- µm sieve was collected and 

concentrated in order to determine number of nematodes per ml by using a Hawksley

slide under a light microscope. Nematodes in any developmental stage were taken as 

a positive count. 

 

2.7. Statistical analysis 

The statistical analysis was performed with ANOVA General Linear Models and 

Tukey’s multiple range tests for overall comparison (Minitab, version 13.31, 2000). All 

data were tested for normality when required to fulfil assumptions of the ANOVA.  AMF 

colonisation and nematode reproduction data were arcsine (x/100) transformed to 

reduce the variance in the data. 

 

3. Results 

3.1. Effect of AMF on plant development 

The importance of shoot growth and aerial biomass production on H. lanatus seedlings 

inoculated with native AMF compared to the non-inoculated control plants and plants 

inoculated with M. incognita are displayed in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.

There were differences highly significant between treatments on fresh root weight of H. 

lanatus (Anova: F= 11.52; d.f.= 3, 52; p&amp;lt;0.001) (Table 1). The Tukey HSD post hoc 

test showed that average of fresh root weight was significantly greater in plants 

inoculated with the combination AMF and nematode ( x = 71.25 ± 4.44) (Fig. 3 a), but 

root infection only by nematode had significantly the lowest weight (43.86 ± 1.31) (Fig. 

3 a).   

The fresh weight of H. lanatus plants also varied significantly between treatments 

(Anova: F= 22.80; d.f.= 3, 52; p&amp;lt;0.001) (Table 1). Take in account the Tukey HSD 

post hoc test, we can observed that the mycorrhizal plants had significantly the largest 

average of aerial fresh weight ( x = 86.92 ± 5.05) (Fig. 3 b), and the nematode 

presence caused a decreased of about 50% on average of aerial fresh weigh of H. 

lanatus plants. Furthermore, in treatment with inoculation of nematode and AMF, 

although average of aerial fresh weight of plants ( x = 67.16 ± 3.24) had been lower 

than only in presence of AMF, did not differ significantly from the weight of non-

mycorrhizal plants (Fig. 3 b).

The total fresh weigh was similar to previous, i.e. there were significant differences in 

average of total fresh weight of H. lanatus plants among treatments (Anova: F= 18.07; 

d.f.= 3, 52; p&amp;lt;0.001) (Table 1). The Tukey HSD post hoc test showed a highly 

significant effect of AMF in fresh biomass of H. lanatus plants (Fig. 3 c). In fact, 

average of fresh biomass of mycorrhizal plants ( x = 139.55 ± 7.82) was higher than in 

the other all, and the plants inoculated with nematode alone had the lowest average of 

total fresh weight ( x = 86.96 ± 2.81). By other side, there were not significant 

differences between total fresh weight of plants simultaneously inoculated with AMF 

and nematode and non-mycorrhizal plants, as well as, between mycorrhizal plants.  

The aerial dry weight of H. lanatus plants followed the same trend, had being 

significantly different between treatments (Anova: F= 10.06; d.f.= 3, 52; p&amp;lt;0.001) 

(Table 1). The Tukey HSD post hoc test revealed a significantly great of AMF effect on 

average of aerial dry weight of H. lanatus, which was higher in mycorrhizal plants ( x = 

27.50 ± 2.58) than in the other treatments (Fig. 3 d). Adding, in the presence of 

nematode the average of aerial dry weight decreased about 40% (Fig. 3 d).

3.2. Effect of AMF on root-feeders 

Concerning to effect of AMF in the number of nematode per gram of root, there were 

significant differences between the mycorrhizal plants and the plants infected only by 

nematode (Anova: F= 321.54; d.f.= 1. 26; p&amp;lt;0.001) (Table 1). In fact, the average of 

number of nematode per gram of root was drastically reduced by the presence of AMF 

than in its absence (Fig. 4 a), in other words, AMF cause a reduction of 323 individuals 

per gram of root in plants of H. lanatus infected by nematode. 

 The same result was obtained in relation to the number of nematode on H. lanatus 

root which also varied among the 2 treatments (Anova: F= 211.14; d.f.= 1. 26; p&amp;lt;

0.001) (Table 1) with the micorrhizal plants had the lower average number of 

nematode on root  ( x = 339 ± 339) than plants infected only by nematode ( x = 14521 

± 915) (Fig. 4 b), i.e,  the number of individuals was less than 13606 in plants infect by 

nematode and AMF.  

These results were reflected in reproduction of nematode which also varied 

significantly among the 2 treatments (Anova: F= 207.29; d.f.= 1. 26; p&amp;lt;0.001). Again, 

the AMF had a significant effect in reducing the reproduction rate of nematode which 

range between 0.3 % and 13% in presence and absence of AMF respectively (Fig. 4 

c).

3.3. Mycorrhizal colonisation 

Mycorrhizal colonisation was detected 4 weeks after inoculation with AMF. The 

average percentage of AMF colonisation ranged between 50 % and 60% at the end of 

experiments in treatments with simultaneous inoculation with AMF and nematode, and 

in treatments inoculated with AMF respectively (Fig.). However, although H. lanatus 

treated with nematode showed a lower mycorrhizal colonisation percentage, no 

significant differences of the presence of nematode were observed on percentage of 

root colonised by AMF (Anova: F= 3.81; d.f.= 1. 26; p= 0.062).

4. Discussion 

In general native AMF reduced M. incognita population in H. lanatus plants. This 

confirmed previous works on a wide variety of crops. Among them, Jaizme-Vega et al. 

(1997) reported that the association between AMF and the banana plantlet increased 

the host tolerance to M. incognita, compensating for de damaged caused by 

nematode, mainly by enhancing plant nutrition.  

Jaizme-Vega et al. (2005) in a study with papaya also showed that M. incognita 

infection was significantly reduced in mycorrhizal plants. Shreenivasa et al. (2007) 

found that application of Glomus fasciculatum increased yield of tomato in plants 

inoculated with M. incognita, whose population was reduced about half in the presence 

of AMF. 

Zhang et al. (2009) also reported in a study to investigate the tolerance of cucumber 

plants (Cucumis sativus L.) to root-knot nematode M. incognita, that the number of 

root galls and the number of egg masses, eggs and J2 were significantly lower on 

plants inoculated with Glomus intradices, indicating that G. intraradices has the 

potential to confer enhanced tolerance to root-knot nematode infestation to cucumber. 

Many hypotheses have been proposed on the mechanism of the AMF-induced 

resistance against plant pathogens (Azcón-Aguilar et al., 2002; Hol and Cook, 2005, 

Vierheilig et al., 2008). Based on our results we can suggest that increased capacity 

for nutrient uptake by the mycorrhizal association may allow host plant to be more 

vigorous and, consequently, more resistant or tolerant of pathogen attack (Azcón-

Aguilar et al., 2002). In fact, root biomass of H. lanatus plants simultaneously 

inoculated with AMF and M. incognita was significantly higher than in the others 

treatments. The AMF presence may have promoted this increase in root biomass to 

compensate tissue damage and decay of root sections by the pathogen and 

consequently reduce significantly disease symptoms. This result was consistent with 

found by Cofcewicz et al. (2001) who found that the increase of number of galls in 

tomato roots simultaneously inoculated with AMF and M. javanica could be related 

with increase of root systems promote by AMF, which put at disposal of nematode a 

greater number of sites for infection. 

Furthermore competition for host colonisation sites and photosynthates may also 

explain our results. Really, the lack of significant differences in AMF root colonisation 



Chapter IV____________   __________________________________ _________    ______________   _ 
 

150 

between mycorrhizal plants and plants with combined inoculation, suggest that there 

was a competitive interaction between M. incognita and AMF on H. lanatus plants by 

space. AMF might occupy infection sites on the root surface needed by M. incognita to 

penetrate root, or cells in the root already occupied by the AMF cannot be colonised 

any further by the root-knot. This result was consisted to found by others authors. 

Between them, de la Peña et al. (2006) reported that when both AMF and P. 

penetrans were together in the same root compartment of A. arenaria occurred 

competition between these organisms, although root colonisation by AMF was not 

affect the nematode. Also Rodriguez-Echeverria et al. (2009) showed that suppression 

of P. penetrans and P. dunensis could be explain trough direct competition, one time 

this is one of the mechanisms which regulated the relative abundance of nematodes in 

the rhizosphere of A. arenaria.  

Adding like AMF, M. incognita growth also depends on carbon from photosynthesis. 

Since plants colonised by AMF much carbon is used by the symbiotic AMF, less 

carbon could be available for nematode colonisation (Azcón-Aguilar et al., 2002; 

Vierheilig et al., 2008). Our findings were similar to the results obtained by Osman et 

al. (1991), who associated the decreased of M. incognita population in Phaseolus 

vulgaris colonised by AMF, to a mechanism of competition for space and food supply 

in the root systems between the two organism. Also Jaizme-Vega et al. (1997) point 

out that the suppression of M. incongnita on micropropagated banana inoculated with 

Glomus mosseae could be associated with competition for space or physiological 

changes in the root that make it an unfavorable food source for the nematode. 

A significant increase on plant growth was observed in mycorrhizal plants compared to 

the others treatments, which is in agreement as observed in other work (Jaizme-Vega 

and Azcón-Aguilar, 1995; Regvar et al., 2003; Al-Askar and Rashad, 2010).  

Regvar et al.(2003) showed that an indigenous mixture of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 

(AMF) containing Glomus mosseae, Glomus fasciculatum, Glomus etunicatum, 

Glomus intraradices and Scutellospora sp. significantly increased the plant biomass 

parameters of pepper, and parsley and the root biomass of carrots. 

The main AMF benefits to the plants it’s the growth improvement due to enhanced 

nutrient uptake, particularly immobile nutrients like phosphorus, because the hyphae 

can reach farther that the nutrient depleted zones that build up around plant roots

151 

(Smith and Read, 1997; Clark and Zeto, 2000). Furthermore, in mycorrhizal plants 

nematode presence did not appear to have affected plant development. In fact, either 

aerial fresh weight or total fresh weight and dry weight of H. lanatus plants 

simultaneously inoculated with AMF and nematode were higher than in non-

mycorrhizal plants or in plants only inoculated with nematode. A same result was 

found by Shreenivasa et al. (2007) who reported that maximum plant height, dry shoot 

and root weighties, as well as, total dry weight and fruit weight per plant were higher in 

tomato plants simultaneously inoculated with Glomus fasciculatum and M. incognita 

than in control or in plant only inoculated by nematode. 

This study concludes that inoculation with native AMF could be a new nematode 

management approach in Azores ecosystems by increasing plant resistance (a case 

of induced resistance) to the nematode where root galling and nematode reproduction 

is negatively affected and plant growth enhanced by the endophyte. However, due to 

the complexity of AMF-nematode interactions more nematodes species should be 

tested and the mechanism need to be further elucidated.

1. Introduction 

Associations between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are common in 

natural and agricultural ecosystems (Smith and Read, 1997). In this intimate 

association the obligate biotrophic fungi supply inorganic nutrients to plants in return to 

photosynthates. Thus, the main benefit of AMF to their host is principally the increased 

uptake of relatively immobile phosphate ions, due to the ability of the hyphal network 

to grow beyond the phosphate depletion zone that quickly develops around the root 

(Smith and Read, 1997). However these fungi can also provide many other benefits to 

the host as: increased resistance to foliar-feeding insects ( Wearn and Gange, 2007), 

improved drought resistance (Augé et al., 2001), increased resistance to soil 

pathogens (Filion et al., 1999; Borowicz, 2001; Idoia et al., 2004) and increased 

tolerance to salinity and heavy metals (Al-Karaki et al., 2001; Mohammad et al., 2003). 

Increased uptake of macronutrients other than P, including nitrogen (N) potassium (K) 

and magnesium (Mg) has also been measured (Smith and Read, 1997; Clark and 

Zeto, 2000) as well as increased uptake of some micronutrients (Ryand and Angus, 

2003; Cho et al., 2009). Thus in face of their effects on plant fitness and soil quality, 

AMF may play an important role in ecosystems functioning, since their appropriate 

management can reduce the use of chemical and energy in agriculture and 

consequently lead to a more economical and sustainable production systems (Barea 

et al., 2005). Therefore, it’s important to increase our understanding about the 

ecological functioning of these mutualistic microbial symbionts, in order to facilitate its 

manipulation as inoculants because not all plants species form AMF associations and 

not all AMF plant show an evident nutritional improvement from colonisation by AMF 

under all growth conditions (van der Heijden et al., 1998; Hart and Reader, 2002). 

AMF show varying degrees of host specificity, even in colonisation ability or 

functioning, since the outcome of the symbiotic interaction is affected by factors 

related to host plant and fungal symbiont genotypes (van der Heijden et al., 1998; Hart 

and Reader, 2002).  

The symbiotic performance of AMF isolates depends on two main parameters: 

colonisation ability and efficiency. The rate of colonisation is influenced by the ability of 

AMF to spread rapidly and extensively in plant roots, and is affected by factors linked

to spore germination, presymbiotic mycelial growth and appressorium formation (Hart 

and Reader, 2002). However, the ability of particular AMF genotype to infect and 

colonise root systems may depend on the presence of particular host plant species 

(Croll et al., 2008). Hart and Reader (2002) found that Acaulosporaceae isolates were 

superior only in presence of Poa annua, a plant species considered as unresponsive 

to AMF (Gange et al., 1999; Smith et al., 1999). This suggests that host genotypes 

influence the response to mycorrhizal symbiosis both in terms of plant growth or 

protections against pathogens (Azcón-Aguilar et al., 2002). Thus, depending on the 

species of plant two general anatomical groups can be distinguished in mycorrhizal 

colonisation, namely Arum-type and Paris-type (Smith and Read, 1997; Brundrett, 

2004; Peterson et al., 2004). In the Arum-type arbuscular mycorrhiza, the hypha that 

penetrates into the epidermis generally forms a coil either in the epidermal cell or first 

cortical cell layer before it enters the intercellular spaces of the cortex. In this type, 

roots can become rapidly colonized along the root axis due to the free movement of 

hyphae in the intercellular spaces. In the Paris-type mycorrhiza, the intraradical 

hyphae pass from cell to cell, forming complex coils in both epidermal and cortical 

cells. Species of plants developing Paris-type mycorrhizas lack conspicuous 

intercellular spaces in the root cortex so that the growth of hyphae in the longitudinal 

direction of the root is slower than in the Arum-type (Smith and Read, 1997; Brundrett, 

2004; Peterson et al., 2004).  

Turn, efficiency of colonisation is correlated with the ability of different isolates to 

promote plant growth by improving mineral nutrition and increasing tolerance to biotic 

and abiotic stresses (Giovannetti and Avio, 2002; Jakobsen et al., 2002). There is 

evidence that intra-family variation in mycelium size and host specificity, may affect the 

relationship between mycelial size and host benefit, indicating that family with the 

largest internal mycelium (Glomaceae) confer the most host benefit. (Hart and Reader, 

2002). Furthermore, Koch et al. (2004) obtain 16 different isolates of one AMF 

species, Glomus intraradices, from one site. They observed that these isolates (which 

were genetically different from each other) varied from each other in that they 

produced different amounts of hyphae. Therefore in face to exposed, plant 

communities may often include species with varying response to the presence of AMF. 

According to their response to mycorrhizal colonisation, they may be classified in 3

categories (Brundrett and Abbott, 2002), i.e. i) obligate mycorrhizal: are defined as 

those which will not survive to reproductive maturity without being associated with 

mycorrhizal fungi in their natural habitats; ii) facultative mycorrhizal: plants that benefit 

from mycorrhizas only in infertile soils or iii) non-mycorrhizal: plants with roots that are 

resistant to colonisation by mycorrhizal fungi.  

Mycorrhizal dependency is defined by Gerdemann (1975) as 'the degree to which a 

plant is dependent on the mycorrhizal condition to produce its maximum growth on 

yield at a given level of soil fertility'. Growth responses to AMF associations are 

measured by comparing the growth of plants with and without mycorrhizas in a 

particular soil. (Brundrett and Abbott, 2002). The morphological as well as 

physiological properties of root system can influence the P absorption of plants in soil, 

and therefore the beneficial effects observed on mycorrhizal plants. Therefore, root 

architecture and morphology has been as one of the most sensitive indicators of plant 

response to mycorrhizal. Plants with facultative or non-mycorrhizal mycorrhizal 

associations normally have much finer roots and longer root hairs than obligate 

mycorrhizal species. Since relatively less energy is directed to root formation, 

mycorrhizal plants showed a greater shoot production, and consequently a lower 

root:shoot ratio in response to a greater increment of shoot mass relative to root mass 

(Azcón-Aguilar and Barea, 1997). 

However, despite these discrepancies between different plant growth responses to 

AMF, there is some evidence that it may be temporally variable and age-dependent 

(Dodd et al., 2000; van der Heijden et al., 2006). Santo-González et al. (2007) noted in 

semi-natural grassland that AMF community not only varied significantly among 

Prunella vulgaris and Antennaria dioica, but also through growing season. P. vulgaris 

showed a high AMF diversity along the entire growth season while the level of AMF 

richness associated to A. dioica decreased dramatically in autumn. This pattern of host 

specificity has been observed in many systems, including agricultural fields (Douds 

and Miller, 1999). Accumulating evidence indicates that mycorrhizal associations can 

be important determinants of diversity in ecosystems and can modify the structure and 

functioning of plant communities in complex ways (Grime et al. 1987; Wilson and 

Hartnett, 1997; Van der Heijden et al. 1998; Hartnett and Wilson 1999; Eom et al. 

2000; Hart et al., 2003). 



Chapter V___ _________   __________________________________ _________    ______________   _

Grime et al. (1987) found that community structure could be significantly altered by 

mycorrhizal activity in species-rich mixtures of plants in experimental microcosm. The 

presence of mycorrhizas can increase floristic diversity (Grime et al., 1987) and 

species richness (Gange et al., 1990). However, this may depend on identity and 

mycorrhizal responsiveness of dominant plant species (Smith et al. 1999; O’ Connor et 

al., 2002; Vogelsang et al., 2006; Jansa et al., 2008)). Consequently, host-specific 

changes in the AMF community could lead to increases in the relative growth rates of 

the most abundant plant species (i.e., positive feedback) or to decreases in the relative 

growth rates of the most abundant (i.e., negative feedback). These two dynamics lead 

to very different predictions for the community. Positive feedback causes 

strengthening of the mutualism between plant and fungal guilds, but a decline in 

species diversity. Negative feedback causes a weakening of the mutualism, but can 

contribute to the coexistence of competing plant species (Bever, 2002; Hart et al., 

2003). Then, differential responses of AMF to host plant species may play an 

important role in regulation of plant intraspecific interactions as well as in the 

composition of plant communities (Hartnett and Wilson, 1999; Smith et al., 1999). 

Smith et al. (1999) reported that removal of the dominant warm-season C4 grass 

species in tall prairie, which exhibits high mycorrhizal responsiveness, increased plant 

diversity, once the dominant species declined in abundance, and number of 

subdominant cool-season C3 grass and forb species increased in abundance. Thus 

AMF may affect plant community indirectly by influencing the pattern and strength of 

plant competitive interactions. Eom et al. (2000) also point out that the different level of 

responses of host plant species to mycorrhizas may result in differences in AMF 

community structure. The same authors report that four of the host plant species 

examined in their studies, Solidago missouriensis Nutt., Baptisia bracteata Muhl. ex 

Ell., Panicum virgatum L., and Sporobolus heterolepis (A. Gray) A Gray, are obligate 

mycotrophs and are highly responsive to mycorrhizal colonisation. By contrast, Poa 

pratensis L. is non-mycorrhiza-dependent and shows no significant growth response to 

mycorrhizal colonisation. O’ Connor et al. (2002), also found that plant species 

diversity increased when mycorrhizal colonisation was suppressed because growth of 

the highly mycorrhiza-responsive dominant Medicago minima was reduced and 

subordinate plant species were released from competition. More recently, Karanika et 

al. (2008) argued that AMF suppression declined the growth of subordinate, more 

mycotrphic and P demanding perennial forbs and most legumes with compensatory

increases of the less P demanding Doricnium herbaceum L. and less mycotrophic and 

P demanding C3 grass. Grasslands can be characterized by the composition of their 

plant community (Rodwell, 1992) with unimproved (typically Agrostis, Festuca 

dominated), semi-improved (Holcus dominated) and improved (Lolium dominated) 

grasslands often found adjacent to each and maintained through different levels of 

management (particularly inputs of lime and fertiliser). In the Azores, upland semi-

natural and intensive pastures are usually dominated by the grass species Holcus 

lanatus. In contrast, L. multiflorum and L. perenne are characteristic of lowland 

improved pastures receiving regular imputs of fertilizer (Dias, 1996; Borges, 1999). 

These three plant species are C3 and their mycorrhizal responses may range from 

facultative to non mycorrhizal plants (Wilson and Hartnett, 1998).  

Mycorrhizal dependency among species has potentially important applications to 

agroecosystems functioning and management. The purpose of current study was to 

assess patterns of interspecific variation in host-plant benefit (i.e., growth response) 

from the symbiosis with AMF among the three most abundant grasses used in 

pastures of the Azores. 

 

2. Material and methods 

2.1. Study plants 

The Azorean pastures are dominated by Holcus lanatus L. and Lolium perenne L.  

(Dias, 1996; Silva and Smith, 2006). These two grasses are among the thirty non-

indigenous vascular plants with high importance value, whose frequencies in pastures 

are 50.5% and 54.2 % respectively to L. perenne and H. lanatus (Silva and Smith, 

2006). Although less dominant, Lolium multiflorum Lam. is also widely distributed 

along the nine islands of the Azores archipelago (Silva et al., 2005). L. multiflorum is 

usually used in crop rotation with Zea mays L. in lowland pastures during the winter 

given its high productivity and diseases resistance under adverse climatic conditions 

(Fernandes et al., 2006). 

 

2.2. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi collection and culture 

In July of 2006, soil was collected from the rhizosphere of ten different H. lanatus 

plants in Pico Galhardo (PX), Terra Brava (TB), Agualva RP1 (RP1) and Agualva

(RP2) and used to set up trap cultures of the AMF community. The fresh soil samples 

were mixed with autoclaved sand and “bagacina” (volcanic soil type) in a ratio of 2:1:1. 

A 1.5-kg aliquot of the mixture was placed in each pot to produce trap culture from 

each sample. Corn (Zea mays L.) was used as host plant. Seeds of corn were surface 

sterilised by immersion in alcohol (96 %) for 30 sec, 4 % bleach for 2 min, and rinsed 

twice in sterile distilled water. Then, they were sown in pots on sterilized sand soil and 

left to germinated in the greenhouse. After one week of growth, seedlings were 

transplanted to pots containing the fresh soil samples mix. A total of 4 seedlings were 

used per plot. Trap cultures in 40 plots were grown in glasshouse for 5 months and 

then harvested. All pots were watered every 2 days with distilled water, and no nutrient 

solution was added to the pots. One month before harvested, we left watering the pots 

to stimulate the sporulation. 

 

2.3. AMF root colonisation assessment 

After 5 months, plants were harvested and root examined to confirm AMF colonisation. 

A portion of roots was cleared in 2.5% KOH for 1h at 90 ?C. Subsequently roots were 

left to acidify overnight in 1% HCl. Staining was done with blue ink (Parker Quink) for 

30 min at 60 ?C, followed by distaining  in lactoglycerol. The amount of colonisation 

was estimated using a grid-intersect method with examination of 100 intersects under 

a compound microscope at 200x magnification (McGonigle et al., 1990). Root-

intersects that contained vesicules, arbuscules or hyphae were scored as mycorrhizal. 

The remaining corn roots were cut into 2-cm pieces, and disinfected by immersion in 2 

% chloramines T for 3 min and in an antibiotic solution (streptomycin 200 mg l-1 + 

penicillin 100 mg l-1) for 3 h. Then, roots were rinsed in autoclaved water and dried (de 

la Peña et al., 2006). 

 

2.4. Spores assessment 

 AMF spores produced in the trap culture were extracted by sieving and decanting 

(Gerdemann and Nicolson, 1963). The procedure included the passage of 50 cm3 of 

harvested trap culture substrate from each pot through 1000-, 500-, 250-, 100-, and 45 

µm sieves. The material retained in 250 µm, 100 µm and 45 µm was collected to 

different petri dishes and AMF spores were counted under a stereoscopic microscope

(Leica MZ 12). Spores from 4 genera were detected in the trap culture, namely 

Acaulospora, Ambispora, Glomus and Scutellospora.  

 

2.5. Experimental design 

The experiment was performed with the three grasses with the widest application in 

the pastures of the Azores, i.e. H. lanatus, L. multiflorum Lam and L. perenne. Seeds 

of these three plant species were surface sterilised by immersion in 96% alcohol for 30 

sec, 0.4% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min and rinsed twice in sterile distilled water. They 

were then sown in boards on a sterilised sand soil and left to germinate in greenhouse. 

After 2 week of growth, seedlings were transplanted to the pots. Four seedlings of 

each plant species were planted in 2-l pots filled with a pasteurized substrate 

contained, soil, sand and “bagagina” (volcanic soil type) in a ratio of 2:1:1 soil. To each 

plant species was made two treatments with 14 replicates per treatment: an 

uninoculated control (C) and an inoculation with a mixture of native arbuscular 

mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) (Fig. 1). The experience included a total of 84 pots. 

 

 

 

 

At the time of transplantation each pot containing 4 seedlings of each plant species for 

inoculation with AMF, received 250 spores and 1g of dried corn roots from trap 

cultures, which was used as AMF inoculum. Pots were covered by a volcanic ash layer 

in order to keep the substrate humid and avoid the contamination, and then arranged 

in the greenhouse in a completely randomised design. Every 2 days pots were 

watered and once per month they were fertilized with 50 ml of half-strength modified 

(P-free) Hoagland’s solution. The experiment was conducted from June 2007 until 

October 2007.

2.6. Harvest and data collection 

Plants were harvested 16 weeks after mycorrhizal inoculation. The following physical 

parameters were measured: fresh root weight, aerial fresh root weight, total fresh root 

weight (aerial and root) and aerial dry weight. After taking the root fraction for 

assessing AMF colonisation (5% in fresh weight), the remaining plant material was 

dried at 72 ºC for 48 h to estimate plant biomass. AMF colonisation was determined by 

the same method used to assess mycorrhizal infection in Z. mays roots from trap 

culture (see above). 

 

2.7. Data analysis 

The statistical analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA (Minitab, version 13.31, 

2000) to compare between the 3 plant species species (H. lanatus, L. multiflorum and 

L. perenne) for percentage colonisation of all mycorrhizal structures. These data were 

arcsine (x/100) transformed to reduce the variance in the data. We also used a two-

way ANOVA to test for treatment (non-mycorrhizal plants - control and mycorrhizal 

plants -AMF) and plant species (H. lanatus, L. multiflorum and L. perenne) and all 

interactions on the fresh root weight, aerial fresh weight, total fresh weight and aerial 

dry weight. For post hoc comparison we used the Tukey’s multiple range tests 

(Minitab, version 13.31, 2000). Mycorrhizal dependency (DM) was calculated for each 

plant species as follows. Percentage mycorrhizal responsiveness 5 [(dry mass 

mycorrhizal plant 2 dry mass nonmycorrhizal plant)/dry mass mycorrhizal plant] 3 100 

(Hetrick et al.,1992). 

Pearson correlations coefficients were calculated between mycorrhizal root 

colonisation and plant growth parameters (fresh root weight, aerial fresh weight, total 

fresh weight and aerial dry weight), as well as, between mycorrhizal dependency (DM) 

and root colonisation.

3. Results  

3.1. Mycorrhizal colonisation 

Non-mycorrhizal control plants showed no colonisation. The AMF root colonisation 

was well establish and ranged between 60 % and 30 % in H. lanatus and L. 

multiflorum respectively, and most of the observed fungal structures corresponded to 

hyphae and vesicles (Table 1; Fig. 1). Furthermore, percentage of root colonisation by 

AMF was strongly affected by the host plant. Thus, we found that AMF total 

colonisation varied significantly with plant spp. (Anova: F= 23.17; d.f.= 2, 39; p&amp;lt;

0.001). The Tukey HSD post hoc test showed that average percentage of AMF total 

colonisation was significantly higher in H. lanatus ( x = 0.62 ± 0.035) than in L. 

perenne ( x = 0.40 ± 0.041) and L. multiflorum ( x = 0.31 ± 0.025). Moreover, there 

were no significant differences in average percentage of AMF total colonisation 

between L. multiflorum and L. perenne (Fig. 2 a).

The percentage of AMF hyphal colonisation also varied significantly among plant

test revealed significant differences in average of AMF hypal colonisation among the 3 

plants inoculated, which was significantly higher in H. lanatus ( x =0.43 ± 0,035)  than 

in the L. multiflorum ( x = 0.27 ± 0.021), but did not differ significantly from  L. perenne

The same result was obtained with the percentage of AMF vesicles colonisation, which 

differed significantly with the host plant (Anova: F= 12.78; d.f.= 2, 39; p&amp;lt;0.001) (Table 

1). In fact, vesicles were present in approximately half of the micorrhizal colonisation of 

H. lanatus, hence this plant species had significantly greater average percentage of 

AMF vesicles colonisation ( x =0.26 ± 0.042) than L. perenne ( x =0.10 ± 0.033) or L. 

multiflorum ( x = 0.04 ± 0.014) (Tukey multiple comparison test p&amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 1 c). 

However, no significant differences were found between L. perenne and L. multiflorum 

(Fig.2 c).   

The percentage of arbuscule colonisation followed the same trend, i.e. varied 

significantly with the plant species (Anova: F= 6.79; d.f.= 2, 39; p= 0.003) (Table 1). 

The Tukey HSD post hoc test showed that average percentage of AMF arbuscule 

colonisation was significantly higher in H. lanatus ( x = 0.11 ± 0.018)  than in L. 

multiflorum ( x = 0.04 ± 0.015), but did not differ significantly from L. perenne ( x = 0.07 

± 0.010)   (Fig. 2 d).   

 

3.2. Mycorrhizal dependency 

L. perenne showed the greater response to mycorrhizal colonisation compared with 

the remaining plant species. Mycorrhizal dependency (MD) values were about 62 %, 

40 % and 27 %, respectively, in L. Perenne, H. lanatus and L. multiflorum. Moreover, 

the relationship between mycorrhizal dependency and root colonisation was 

significantly positive (r= 0.306, P&amp;lt;0.05). 

 

3.3. Effects of AMF species on plant growth   

The importance of native AMF inoculation on aerial biomass production of H. lanatus, 

L. multiflorum and L. perenne seedlings are displayed on Figure 3.

The two-way Anova showed that the type of treatment as well as the plant species had 

a significant influence on plant parameters (Table 2).Thus there were highly significant 

effects of treatments (two-way Anova: F= 21.87; d.f.= 1, 78; p&amp;lt;0.001), plant species 

(two-way Anova: F= 34.70; d.f.= 2, 78; p&amp;lt;0.001) and the interactions between these 2 

factors (two-way Anova: F= 10.46; d.f.= 2, 78; p&amp;lt;0.001)  on the fresh root weight 

(Table 2). The fresh root weight was negatively correlated with AMF root colonisation 

(r= - 0.493, p&amp;lt;0.001). In fact, L. perenne control plants ( x = 86.44 ± 2.74) had the 

highest fresh weigh root, and H. lanatus mycorrhizal plants ( x = 52.63 ± 3.04) as well 

as, the H. lanatus control plants ( x = 54.83 ± 3.71) the lowest fresh root weight (Tukey 

multiple comparison test p&amp;lt;0.05) (fig. 4 a). However, fresh root weight of L. perenne 

control plants did not differ significantly from the L. multiflorum control ( x = 81.99 ± 

3.28) or mycorrhizal plants ( x = 76.62 ± 2.95) (Tukey multiple comparison test p&amp;lt;

0.05) (fig. 4 a). 

 

 

 

The same result was also observed in relation to aerial fresh weight, which also was 

significantly affected by the 2 main factors in question, as well as, by the interaction 

between them. This way, there were greater significant effects of treatment (two-way 

Anova: F= 45.81; d.f.= 1, 78; p&amp;lt;0.001), plant species (two-way Anova: F= 36.85; d.f.= 

2, 78; p&amp;lt;0.001) and the interaction among these 2 factors (two-way Anova: F= 12.15; 

d.f.= 1, 78; p&amp;lt;0.001) in aerial fresh weight among control plants and mycorrhizal 

plants (Table 2).

The aerial fresh weight was significant and positively correlated with AMF root 

colonisation (r= 0.375, P&amp;lt;0.05). Thus, the aerial fresh weight of L. perenne mycorrhizal 

plants ( x = 89.13 ± 6.66) was significantly higher than L. multiflorum mycorrhizal 

plants ( x = 44.33 ± 1.28) and control ones ( x = 42.88 ± 0.94) (Tukey multiple 

comparison test p&amp;lt;0.05), but was identical to the aerial fresh weight of H. lanatus 

mycorrhizal plants ( x = 86.92 ± 5.05) (Tukey multiple comparison test p&amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 4 

b). 

The total fresh weight was affected by the presence/absence of AMF and by species 

of plants (Table 2). Then, there were significant differences between the 3 species of 

plants (two-way Anova: F= 5.63; d.f.= 2, 78; p&amp;lt;0.01) (Table 2) on total fresh weight, 

which was significantly more high in L. perenne ( x = 141.30 ± 3.78)  than in L. 

multiflorum ( x = 122.91 ± 2.64), but it was identical to H. lanatus ( x = 128.90 ± 5.42)  

(Fig. 4 c). The total fresh weight also varied significantly between the 2 treatments 

performed, but much less markedly (two-way Anova: F= 4.33; d.f.= 1, 78; p&amp;lt;0.05) 

(Table 2). In fact, the total fresh weight was higher in mycorrhizal plants ( x = 135.79 ± 

3.81) than in control plants ( x = 126.28 ± 3.08) (Fig. 4 c). However, there were no 

significant differences of the interaction between the 2 main factors on total fresh 

weight (two-way Anova: F= 2.58; d.f.= 2, 78; p= 0.08) (Table 2). 

The aerial dry weight was also significantly affected by the treatments (two-way 

Anova: F= 55.78; d.f.= 2, 78; p&amp;lt;0.01), plant species (two-way Anova: F= 55.56; d.f.= 

2, 78; p&amp;lt;0.01) as well as, by the interactions between these 2 factors (two-way Anova: 

F= 14.03; d.f.= 2, 78; p&amp;lt;0.001) (Table 2). Again, the effect of AMF was evident on this 

parameter, i.e. aerial dry weight was significant and positively correlated with the AMF 

root colonisation (r= 0.534, p&amp;lt;0.001). In fact, the aerial dry weight of H. lanatus 

mycorrhizal plants was significantly higher than the others combinations ( x = 27.50 ± 

2.58) (Tukey multiple comparison test p&amp;lt;0.05), and the opposite was observed in 

relation to aerial dry weight of L. multiflorum which was significantly lower in non-

mycorrhizal plants ( x = 8.69 ± 0.20) as well as in presence of AMF ( x = 8.71 ± 0.25) 

(Tukey multiple comparison test p&amp;lt;0.05) (Fig. 4 d).

4. Discussion 
 
The establishment of the AMF in the root cortex is known to change many key aspects 

of plant physiology. These include the mineral nutrient composition of plant tissues, 

the hormonal balance, and the patterns of C allocation. Therefore, the AMF symbiotic 

status changes the chemical composition of root exudates, while the development of 

an AMF soil mycelium, which can act as a carbon source for microbial communities, 

introduces physical modifications into the environment surrounding the roots. AM-

induced changes in plant physiology affect the microbial populations, both 

quantitatively and qualitatively, in either the rhizosphere and/or the rhizoplane. 

Therefore, the rhizosphere of a mycorrhizal plant can have features that differ from 

those of a non-mycorrhizal plant (Barea et al. 2005). 

Root colonisation percentage 

The three plant species used in this study showed multiple colonisation morphology, 

i.e. Arum-type and Paris-type. Thick wall of intercellular hyphae with projections and H 

connections and intercellular vesicles (Arum-type), as well as, intercellular coils and 

terminal arbuscules (Paris-type) were observed in the three host plant (Smith et al., 

2003). On the other hand, the three plant species displayed different, but well 

described physiological alterations as a result of mycorrhizal colonisation. 

In fact, the percentage of colonisation of almost all AMF structures was significantly 

higher in H. lanatus followed by L. perenne and L. multiflorum. Thus H. lanatus and L. 

perenne behaved as a typical mycorrhiza-responsive plant species, having relatively 

high levels of mycorrhizal dependency (40 % and 61 % respectively). Conversely, L. 

multiflorum, was overall less responsive to mycorrhizal colonisation, whereby it had 

lower mycorrhizal dependency (approximately 27 %). Smith and Read (1997) reported 

that the extent to which typical AMF colonise root systems varies with species of 

plants. Also, Bever (2002) showed in a microcosm experiment evident differences of 

host-specific in the AMF communities between 4 host plants (P. lanceolata, A. 

odoratum and P. sphaerocarpon). He reported that biovolume of AMF spores after the 

first generation was great with Allium and least with Anthoxathum. On the other, it was 

also noted that there are differences in the extent of infection between genotypes of 

the same species (Burleigh et al., 1998; 2002; Croll et al., 2008). Burleigh et al. (2002)  



                                                                                                                                                                       Chapter V

demonstrated that large differences may exist between plant species in how they 

respond at molecular level to AMF colonisation, since seven species on AMF varied 

widely in their influence on the root expression of the Mt4 gene from Medicago 

truncatula, whose expression is down-regulated by both phosphate starvation and 

mycorrhizal colonisation (Burleigh et al., 1998) as well as on the expression of LePT1 

and TPSI1 of Lycopersicum esculentum. The same author noted that M. truncatula 

colonisation by Glomus mosseae resulted in the greatest reduction in MtPT2 and Mt4 

gene expression and the highest level of P uptake and growth, but the opposite 

occurred in M. Truncatula root colonisation by Gigaspora rosea. However, little 

variation was detected in the expression of LePT1 and TPSI1 within roots of the seven 

mycorrhizas. Mathimaran et al. (2005) observed that host plant was an important 

determinant of AMF species composition, once Glomus intraradices and Glomus 

caledonium showed significant preferences to leek and sunflower respectively. 

Recently, Croll et al., (2008) found that among four different trap host species (Allium 

porrum, Plantago lanceolata, Glycine max and Helianthus annuus) the number of AMF 

genotypes was significantly higher in A. porrum and H. annus both with 9 isolates, 

than in G. max and P. lanceolata with 4 and 1 isolates respectively. They concluded 

that this fact could provide in field site a heterogeneous environment, since host plant 

may encourage certain genotypes. 

Plant productivity 

Mycorrhizal colonisation affects a wide range of morphological parameters in 

development root systems, a greater root branching being the most described effect 

(Regvar et al., 2003; Cho et al., 2009).  Sohn et al. (2003) reported at transplanting 

stage of chrysanthemum plant (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat), that inoculation of 

AMF resulted in greater height, number of lateral roots, tap root length, and fresh and 

dry weight of shoots and roots compared to non-AMF treatment. Turkmen et al. (2008) 

noted that fresh and dry weights of shoots and roots of pepper seedlings were 

increased in presence of AMF species. However, our result did not agree with the 

previous work, we detected a decrease on fresh root weight of the 3 plants species in 

the mycorrhizal treatment compared to the control. A similar result was also found by 

Azcón and Ocampo (1981) who reported that mycorrhizal dependency among 13 

wheat cultivars decreased as the root weight increased. Also Saif (1987) noted that

inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi favored the development of shoots more than roots, 

leading to a significant decrease in the root/shoot ratio of fourteen host plants. 

According to Azcón-Aguilar and Barea (1997) plants forming mycorrhizae tend to have 

a lower root:shoot (R:S) ratio, which means a greater biomass efficiency, since less 

energy is directed to root formation. Using micropropagated pineapple, Guillemin et al. 

(1992) were even able to demonstrate the existence of a negative correlation between 

the mycorrhizal effects on root and shoot development. According to the authors, the 

higher the root:shoot ratio, the less efficient the system for shoot production. This 

mycorrhizal effect on root development is partly due to architectural changes in the 

root system, as has been demonstrated in particular for micropropagated woody 

species such as grapevine (Schellenbaum et al., 1991) and Prunus (Berta et al., 

1995). These studies show that mycorrhiza formation changes root topology from a 

herringbone pattern to a more dichotomous pattern, the latter being more efficient for 

scavenging of the soil nutrients. Pacovisky et al. (1986) reported that P-deficient plants 

lacking AMF symbiosis tend to have a high root:shoot ratio, which is usually 

associated with nutrient-stressed plants. More recently, van der Heijden et al. (2006) 

also noted in an experimental grassland microcosm with different AMF taxa and host 

plants, that root biomass was, on average, 26 % higher in control microcosm 

compared with microcosm inoculated with AMF.  

It has been well documented that morphology of root is extremely important factor in 

determining mycorrhizal dependency. Plants with roots that are comparatively thick, 

with little branching and few or no root hairs tend to show greater positive growth 

responses to mycorrhizal colonisation than plants with fine, highly branched long roots 

with numerous root hairs (Hetrick et al., 1992; Wilson and Hartnett, 1998). Research 

has showed that the length and the density of roots hair are indicator of the 

mycorrhizal dependency (MD) of plants species or cultivar (Janos, 2007). Our result 

followed this trend, since fresh root weight was negatively correlated with AMF root 

colonisation, i.e. L. multiflorum had the largest root biomass and it was less 

mycorrhizal dependent than H. lanatus and L. perenne. Moreover, a significant 

correlation between root colonisation and mycorrhizal dependency was observed 

which may suggest that plant that do not rely on the symbiosis regulate mycorrhizal 

colonisation in some way and, thus, control carbon expenditure of the fungus (Wilson  



                                                                                                                                                                       Chapter V

and Hartnett (1998). In fact, the three grasses are described as cool-season (C3), and 

particularly L. multiflorum was the less responsive and also the less colonised by the 

fungi.  

The symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) increases the performance of 

plants by improving nutrient acquisition, resulting in positive effects on growth and 

reproduction (Smith and Read 1997). In fact, the intensity of root mycorrhizal 

colonisation, which quantify the biomass of AMF in plants roots significantly differ 

between the 3 grasses. The high root colonisation observed in H. lanatus as well as in 

L. perenne, although less marked, promoted a significant increase in aerial fresh root, 

total fresh weight as aerial dry weight. This result could be associated with the 

increase of nutrient uptake by mycorrhizal roots. As the colonisation rate of roots 

increases, a mycorrhizal root system can explore a bigger soil extension. This result 

was consistent to previous works, among them Jaizme-Vega and Azcón-Aguilar 

(1995) who reported that growth of some tropical and subtropical cultures, like 

avocado, papaya, pineapple and banana, improved when they were inoculated with 

selected AMF during the first phase of growth. Likewise, Regvar et al. (2003) showed 

a significant increase on biomass parameters of pepper and parsley as a result of 

mycorrhizal inoculation. 

Guissou (2009) also found a significant increase in shoot growth, total dry weight and 

nutrient uptake in seedlings of jujube (Ziziphus mauritiana Lam.) plants as result of the 

high rate of root colonisation observed in this plant. 

Conversely, significantly lower total aerial fresh weight was recorded in L. multiflorum 

plants inoculated with AMF compared with non-mycorrhizal plants. Reduced growth as 

a result of mycorrhizal colonisation was also observed in some Tagetes cultivars 

(Linderman and Davis, 2004). No effect of root inoculation with Glomus intraradices on 

shoot biomass was earlier recorded in Callistephus chinensis grown in P-deficient soil 

under field conditions (Gaur and Adholeya, 2005). It is well known that mycorrhizal 

colonisation can depress plant growth primarily by sink competition for photosynthates 

(Douds et al. 1998). Some studies have indicated that plant growth depression due to 

mycorrhizal colonisation is attributed to greater carbon expenditure in a colonised root 

system (Peng et al., 1993).  



Chapter V___ _________   __________________________________ _________    ______________   _ 
 

174 
 

 

In field cultivation mycorrhizal roots can explore more soil volume than non-

mycorrhizal ones, due to their extramatricial hyphae (Sawaki and Saito, 2001); it is 

impossible in pot culture in very limited volume of growing media. Results obtained on 

Typha latifolia (Dunham et al., 2003) also suggest that under greenhouse conditions, 

AMF act to reduce plant growth despite increased mineral nutrition and photosynthetic 

activity. On the other hand, the time period of seedlings could have been too short to 

record a higher colonisation percentage, and consequently their effects on aerial 

biomass, since the root system infected normally increases with time sigmoidally 

(Smith and Read, 1997). Adding, according to van der Heijden et al. (2006) plant 

growth responses to AMF were temporally variable and some species obtained the 

highest biomass with different year, thus it may be beneficial for plant to be colonised 

by different AMF taxa in different seasons. However, though L. multiflorum is a weakly 

mycotrophic plant, there is evidence that it can maintain a viable AMF community in 

monoculture even when more strongly mycorrhizal plants are lacking (Teutsch et al., 

2006). 

To sum up, the inoculation with a mix of native AMF inoculum increased plant 

productivity. This agrees with other studies which show that native AMF are important 

contributors to plant biodiversity and ecosystem productivity (van der Heijden et al., 

1998; Requena et al., 2001, Klironomos, 2003; Regvar et al., 2003). Furthermore, our 

results indicate that mycorrhizal inoculated at the first phase of development of the 

plant production system confer the greatest benefit to these plant species (Jaizme-

Vega and Azcón, 1995; Regvar et al., 2003). However, the three grasses responded 

differently to AMF inoculation indicating that AMF is host-dependent (Eason et al., 

1999; Hartnett and Wilson, 1999; Bever, 2002). This result underlines to the impact 

that cropping with a weak or non-mycorrhizal crop may have on AMF colonisation, 

nutrient uptake and yield of subsequent AMF reliant crop, especially if it is highly 

mycorrhizal dependent (Douds et al., 1997; Miller, 2000).  

Our findings are of crucial importance to the agriculture systems of the Azores 

archipelago, a region where more than 80 % of the useful agricultural surface (SAU) is 

occupied by permanent pastures, where L. perenne and H. lanatus are the dominants 

plant species (Dias, 1996; Borges, 1997; Lopes, 1999). In these systems we have

assisted to a loose of biological diversity caused by the increasing input of fertilizers 

and pesticides to respond to the needs of high number of animals per  

 

hectare (“livestock”). Therefore, in face to the relevant mycorrhizal responses of L. 

perenne and H. lanatus, the appropriate management of this symbiosis could enable 

the reduction of chemical fertilizer and pesticide inputs, a key aim of sustainable 

grassland plant production approaches (Azcón-Aguilar and Barea, 1997).

General conclusions  

 

Arbuscular mycorrhiza is an ancient symbiosis between the majority of land plants and 

fungi from the phylum Glomeromycota. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonise 

plant roots and contribute to the mineral nutrient uptake of the hosts in exchange for 

carbohydrates. AMF species diversity and identity was reported to have a decisive 

influence on the composition and productivity of natural plant communities. Only 

around 200 glomeromycotan species described so far were thought to colonise the 

majority of higher plant species and thus, their host specificity was thought to be very 

low. Determining how AMF biological communities are assembled and the factors that 

influence its distributions are fundamental challenges in ecology. 

It is well documented that agricultures practices can affect the structure of arbuscular 

mycorrhizal communities. These changes reflect not only in species diversity but also 

in species composition, with the most of studies indicating a decrease with the level of 

land use intensification. However, our study showed that diversity of AMF spores as 

well as the diversity of AMF on Holcus lanatus L. roots did not change between the 

semi-natural and intensive land uses. The absence of different patterns of AMF 

species diversity, between the two land uses types could be related with the low level 

of land use intensification. In fact, it is known that the input of fertilisers and pesticides 

and several other management practices (e.g. grazing intensity) are important in 

defining the quality of the pasturelands for AMF. However, the input of fertilisers to 

Azorean pastureland is lower than average inputs to pastures on the European 

mainland, which enables the occurrence of endemic species even in most intensive 

land uses. On the other hand, striking differences in AMF spore composition were 

found between semi-natural and intensive land uses. Species in Glomus were 

dominant in intensive pastures, not only as reproductive spores but also in roots of H. 

lanatus, which conferred its status of “generalist” species due its high ecological 

plasticity occurring in a wide range of habitats inclusive in the most disturbed. In 

contrast, Acaulospora and Scutellospora were the two most representative genera in 

semi-natural pastures. Many of these species appeared to prefer or even to be 

restricted to a land use intensity or field site, and thus characterised as “specialist”. 

This was the case for most species of Acaulospora sp. and Ambispora sp. only found 

in semi-natural land use, while Glomus etunicatum and Paraglomus sp. just found in 

intensive ones. This suggests that these species have specific and rather narrow

niches. Distinct colonisation strategies adopted by AMF, even at family level and 

nutrient availability could explain these differences on species composition between 

land uses. Members of Glomaceae have a highly infective extra-radical mycelium that 

could allow colonising immediately plant roots. Hence, G. mosseae and G. etunicatum 

dominance may be related to competitive advantages for carbon uptake, which make 

them the most effective competitor due to its fast rate of colonisation and early peak in 

colonisation. Moreover, Glomus forms anastomose between mycelia therefore has the 

ability to re-establish an interconnected network after mechanical disturbance. 

Conversely members of Gigasporaceae, those are only capable of propagation via 

spore dispersal colonise plant roots more slowly than members of Glomaceae. 

In order to better understand the role of AMF in natural ecosystems, as well as their 

basic biology, it is important to document seasonal changes of mycorrhizal 

colonisation. The fungal structure quantification in H. lanatus roots such as arbuscules, 

vesicles and hyphae was higher in semi-natural land use than in intensive ones, and 

showed a marked seasonality. This could be related with plant phenology and 

metabolic pathway, as well as with climatic conditions. Fungal structures were more 

abundant in the summer, the season with high temperature as well as solar radiation. 

Moreover, the higher abundance of fungal structure in H. lanatus root during this 

season could be related with plant phenology. This period matches with the start of the 

reproductive phase of Holcus lanatus at the sites. During flowering and/or fruiting the 

phosphorus demand is high and thus AMF colonisation levels were also high. This can 

also be demonstrated by higher percentage of AMF arbuscules colonisation during this 

season. Arbuscules are the place for exchange of nutrients between plant and fungus, 

and its high percentage of colonisation indicates an intense symbiotic activity.  

Nutrient availability also affects the species composition and root colonisation of AMF 

communities. The density of spore of the most representative genera – Glomus, 

Acaulospora and Scutellospora, was correlated with soil nutrients. The percentage of 

AMF root colonisation showed the same pattern. Thus, the improvement of soil fertility, 

especially the availability of K, N, Ca and Mg, provided favourable environment for 

mycorrhizal formation and function in these systems. Among soil nutrients, 

phosphorus is widely known to inhibit the composition and diversity of AMF 

communities as well as spore and mycelium densities. However, a correlation between 

percentage of AMF colonisation and spore density with soil P content was not found. 

This may be due to low soil Pcontent in semi-natural and intensive pastures, which is 



                                                                                                                                                                     Chapter VI 

                                                                                                                                                                                   181   

above the P concentrations that limit AMF colonisation and plant growth (P&amp;lt;10 ppm), 

that could affect the absorption of other soil nutrients. Under P limited conditions, the 

investment of a host plant in AMF genus or species should be strengthened to 

maintain the uptake of limiting nutrients. So, as predicted by the functional equilibrium 

model, in low P soil, relative allocation to arbuscules, coils and extraradical hypae is 

generally increased by N enrichment and vice-versa. Then, changes in AMF 

community may be explained by changes in the soil N:P ratio. 

In fact, the spore densities of Acaulospora and Scutellospora were positively 

correlated with N soil nutrient, but the opposite occurred with spore density of Glomus 

genus, which was reflected in a greater abundance of genera Acaulospora and 

Scutellospora in semi-natural pastures, as well as, in higher abundance of Glomus 

genus in the intensively managed pastures. 

The main AMF benefits to the plants is the growth improvement due to enhanced 

nutrient uptake, particularly immobile nutrients like phosphorus, because the hyphae 

can reach farther that the nutrient depleted zones that build up around plant roots. 

Thus, AMF may play an important role in ecosystems functioning, since their 

appropriate management can reduce the use of chemical and energy in agriculture 

and consequently lead to a more economical and sustainable production systems. 

However, host genotypes influence the response to mycorrhizal symbiosis both in 

terms of plant growth or protections against pathogens.  According to their response to 

mycorrhizal colonisation, host plant can be classified in 3 categories: obligate, 

facultative or non-mycorrhizal depending if they show high, intermediate or non level of 

arbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation. Mycorrhizal response is usually measured in 

terms of mycorrhizal dependency. The tree plant studied – H. lanatus L., Lolium 

multiflorum Lam. and Lolium perenne L. are facultative mycorrhizal plants, but showed 

different degrees of response to native AMF inoculation. L. perenne was the most 

mycorrhizal dependent plant, followed by H. lanatus, which reflected in a higher root 

colonisation and thus higher plant biomass production. In contrast, L. multiflorum was 

the less responsive and also the less colonised by the fungi, which resulted in lower 

plant productivity when combined with mycorrhiza.  

Mycorrhizal dependency among species has potentially important applications to 

agroecosystems functioning and management. In the Azores, upland semi-natural and 

intensive pastures are usually dominated by the grass species Holcus lanatus. In 

contrast, L. multiflorum and L. perenne are characteristic of lowland improved pastures

receiving regular imputs of fertiliser. Moreover, in lowland during the winter L. 

multiflorum is usually used in crop rotation with Zea mays L. an obligate mycorrhizal 

plant. Our findings suggest that in this soil management called “outonos” the AMF root 

colonisation of highly mycorrhizal dependant crop (Z. may), and subsequent 

production , can be committed due to lower AMF infectivity resulting from the previous  

weak mycorrhizal crop (L. multiflorum).In addition to increased inorganic nutrient 

acquisition, other potential benefits of AMF colonisation to host plant include enhanced 

resistance or tolerance to biotic stress, such as nematodes and root pathogens. In 

fact, the inoculation with native AMF increased the tolerance of H. lanatus to root-knot 

Meloidogyne incognita. Among the mechanism proposed to explain the protective 

effect of AMF, we suggest that plant growth promotion by AMF, and direct competition 

for host colonisation sites and photosynthates between AMF and nematode were 

involved.  

AMF indigenous inoculum promoted the growth of the host plant, which was evident in 

a higher fresh and dry foliar biomass of mycorrhizal plants than in others treatments. 

Thus, there was an apparent increase in the vigor of the mycorrhizal plants that made 

them more resistant to nematode infection. However, root biomass was higher when 

plants were inoculated simultaneously with the two organisms, indicating that in 

presence of the nematode, AMF increase root biomass to compensate tissue damage 

and decay of root sections by the pathogen and consequently prevent significantly 

disease symptoms.  

Both AMF and root-knot M. incognita share the same ecological niche, i.e. root of host 

plants. However, the nematode presence did not cause a decrease on mycorrhizal 

colonisation, indicating that probably a competitive interaction occurred between these 

two organisms on H. lanatus roots by space. On the other hand, as in mycorrhizal 

plants much carbon is used by the symbiotic AMF, less carbon could be available for 

nematode colonisation, preventing the infection by the nematode. 

 

This was the first study about AMF community structure in Azores. It provides basic 

information about AMF species diversity and composition in semi-natural and intensive 

pastures of Azores, as well as the main factors that can contribute to differences 

between them. Moreover, the results also underline to the role of indigenous AMF as 

potential inoculums in pastures, either by its contribute to plant productivity or 

protection against nematodes. Thus, the correct use of AMF will help to decrease

fertiliser input yet maintain the same level of growth and production, which will be the 

crucial importance from the point of view of sustainable agriculture. However, much 

works will be needed to better clarify the patterns of AMF distributions in these 

systems. It will be interesting to further investigate whether these AMF differ in other 

functional traits that are of agronomic importance.
