resumo 
 

 

O presente trabalho visa o estudo da preparação e caracterização de 
dispositivos biomédicos com capacidade de suscitar diferentes respostas 
biológicas. Os compósitos de poliuretano e óxido de zinco (PU/ZnO) mostram-
se promissores, pois qualquer dos materiais, em separado, tem revelado 
propriedades biomédicas interessantes. No entanto, as propriedades da 
mistura de ambos ainda não estão totalmente esclarecidas. Às próprias 
nanopartículas ou nanoestruturas de ZnO são apontados desempenhos 
ambíguos, que tornam imprevisíveis as respectivas respostas biológicas.  
Este trabalho tem, assim, como principal objectivo, estudar o efeito da 
concentração, forma e tamanho de partícula de ZnO nas propriedades de 
compósitos PU/ZnO, designadamente na sua bioactividade in vitro e resposta 
celular. Com esse objectivo sintetizaram-se partículas de ZnO 
nanoestruturadas, por precipitação química, que foram caracterizadas 
comparativamente com nanopartículas de ZnO comerciais. Avaliaram-se as 
fases presentes, cristalinidade, forma e tamanho de partícula, área superficial 
específica e porosidade. Posteriormente formularam-se compósitos de matriz 
polimérica (poliuretano), carregados com as partículas de ZnO (2% e 50% em 
peso) e submeteram-se os compósitos a ensaios de bioactividade in vitro e de 
viabilidade celular (linha MC3T3). Os ensaios de bioactividade revelaram que 
os compósitos com 50% ZnO, nomeadamente os compósitos com nanoesferas 
de ZnO, são potencialmente mais bioactivos que o poliuretano ou os 
compósitos com 2% ZnO. Por seu lado, os estudos de viabilidade celular 
revelaram que os compósitos com 2% ZnO e o polímero são os que 
apresentam maior viabilidade celular. Verificou-se que no caso das partículas 
comerciais ou nanoestruturadas o efeito de 50% de carga é similar ao efeito 
das próprias partículas, induzindo citotoxicidades muito semelhantes. Os 
compósitos que continham nanoesferas de ZnO (50% em peso) evidenciaram 
citotoxicidade superior aos outros. Estes comportamentos são discutidos com 
base na quantidade de catiões Zn

2+
 libertados para o meio.  

Em conclusão, os resultados obtidos mostram que é possível controlar a 
bioactividade e citotoxicidade dos compósitos PU/ZnO através da manipulação 
da concentração ou morfologia de partícula de ZnO e, por esta via, desenhar 
compósitos com potencialidades para aplicações ortopédicas (compósitos com 
2% em peso) e compósitos para aplicações em que se pretende travar a 
proliferação celular, como no tratamento do cancro (compósitos com 50% em 
peso).

abstract 

 
The present work is focused on the preparation and characterization of 
biomedical devices able to elicit different biological responses. 
Polyurethane/zinc oxide composites (PU/ZnO) appear as very promising 
materials as they may combine the interesting biomedical properties of ZnO 
and PU. However the properties of the composites, particularly in what the 
biological response is concerned, are far from being completely known. They 
are even unpredictable when ZnO nanoparticles or nanostructures are involved 
as ambiguous behaviours have been pointed out to nanometric sized ZnO 
particles. 
The main objective of the present work is to study the effects of the shape, size 
and concentration of ZnO particle on the properties of PU/ZnO composites, 
particularly on its bioactivity and cellular response.  
For this purpose ZnO nanoparticles/nanostructures were synthesized by a 
chemical precipitation method and subsequently characterized in terms of 
crystal phase composition, crystallinity, shape and particle size, specific surface 
area and porosity. These properties were further compared to those of 
commercial ZnO nanoparticles counterparts. PU/ZnO composites were then 
formulated by loading a PU matrix with ZnO particles (2 and 50%wt) and then 
submitted to in vitro bioactivity tests in SBF and to cell viability assays using a 
MC3T3 cell line. The bioactivity assays revealed that 50%wt ZnO loaded 
composites, namely those loaded with ZnO nanospheres, are potentially more 
bioactive than both PU and 2%wt PU/ZnO composites. Regarding cell viability, 
2%wt PU/ZnO formulations were found to be the composites ensuring the 
higher cell viability. It was also shown that the toxicity effects of the 50%wt 
PU/ZnO composites prepared either with commercial or precipitated 
nanostructured ZnO particles were very similar to the toxicity effects of the 
corresponding isolated ZnO particles. As for the composites prepared with ZnO 
nanospheres (50%wt Pu/ZnO), their toxicity was higher than the remaining 
composites. These behaviours were discussed based on Zn

2+
 release to SBF 

media. 
As a conclusion, the obtained results show that it is possible to control PU/ZnO 
composites bioactivity and cytotoxicity by manipulating the concentration and/or 
ZnO particle morphology, thereby enabling the design of composites with 
potential usefulness for orthopaedic applications (2 %wt PU/ZnO) or for 
biomedical purposes  intended to retard cellular proliferation like cancer 
treatment (50 %wt PU/ZnO).

1. Introduction 

 

Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a wide band gap piezoelectric semiconductor with large exciton 

binding energy used in numerous electronic applications. Moreover, under specific light 

wavelengths ZnO may undergo free-radical reactions and exhibit cytotoxicity and 

antibacterial/fungi properties which suggest its medical usefulness. Furthermore, being a 

broad spectrum UV reflector, ZnO is also a primary choice as sunscreen additive for 

cosmetic products. ZnO is also a Food and Drug Agency (FDA) approved compound. 

However, as observed for nanosized materials in general, the biological effects of 

nanosized or nanostructured ZnO particles are still poorly understood. There is a large 

controversy on the effects these particles on both human health and environment, as many 

contradicting aspects being reported. Nanosized particles are generally addressed to be 

potentially harmful to human health if not properly controlled and thus the interest of 

confinement in a polymer matrix is very appealing. This strategy may be useful when 

aiming at a local targeted action [1-35]. 

Polyurethanes (PUs) are materials of extreme relevance due to their chemical properties, 

mechanic and possible biodegradability. These characteristics allied to the facile 

processing methods allows their regular use in the medical area as ventricular devices, 

diaphragms, heart valves, bioactive vascular grafts, catheters and other devices. PUs, 

namely tecoflex SG80A PU, is also an FDA approved material and even with its own 

intrinsic limitations presents itself as potential confining matrix as a way to control the 

exposure level of these particles [36-47]. 

PU/ZnO composites are reported for nerve guide channels, catheters or osteoconductive 

strategies. The addition of ZnO nanoparticles/nanostructures to PU will inevitably change 

the polymer properties, but as such changes have been inconsistently reported, the 

biological response to the composite itself also becomes unpredictable [5, 10]. 

The purpose of the present work is to study the potential of polyurethane/zinc oxide 

(PU/ZnO) nanocomposites for biomedical applications. The manipulation of some specific 

properties of ZnO particles such as shape, size and porosity, are carried out and their

impact on polyurethane/ZnO composites properties are evaluated, while accessing the 

resulting composites in vitro behaviour. 

 

1.1. Nanocomposites 

 

Composite materials combining a polymer matrix and nanometric sized particles 

(nanoparticles) are envisaged as promising materials for the near future, referred here as 

nanocomposites, as they offer the superior properties of nanoparticles while benefiting  

from the polymer processing technology [1]. 

It can be roughly stated that polymer/nanoparticles nanocomposites can be prepared 

through four routes, [1]: 

? Solution method: consists on the dissolution of the polymer followed by the 

dispersion of the nanoparticles in the polymer solution and then by the evaporation 

of the solvent. 

? Melt mixing: the polymer is melted and mixed with the filler and then 

homogenised. 

? In-situ polymerization: the nanoparticles are dispersed in the pre-polymer solution 

and polymerization is subsequently promoted. 

? Template synthesis: using polymer templates the nanoparticles are precipitated 

within the polymer pores from a precursor solution (particle size is strongly 

dependent on the polymer pore size distribution). 

 

Nanometric sized particles (nanoparticles)  are known since several decades but their 

effects and properties as polymer nanofillers are not yet clearly known. Furthermore as 

nanoparticles themselves still pose some challenging issues, they will be specifically 

addressed in the next section.

A. Nanoparticles 

 

In the XXI century nanoparticles production revealed itself as a key technology that would 

allow a technological and industrial development as the automobile, computers and 

communication technologies did in the last century [2]. 

Prompted by the exceptional properties exhibited by nanoparticles, the research efforts of 

the scientific community to develop nanoparticles (NPs) and nanotechnologies (NT) have 

increased in the latest years. The global market also sticks to this tendency as the 

investment has kept increasing throughout the years with an increase in the nanomaterials 

business value (figure 1 and table 1) [2, 3].

Part of the interest raised by the nanoparticles relies on the fact that as the particle size 

diminishes its specific surface area ‘SSA’ increases, providing larger contact areas, 

enhanced reactivity and a higher number of surface atoms or defects per unit area. The 

physical and chemical properties of the materials can change drastically as the particle size 

goes down to the nanometric scale and thus become significantly different from those of 

the bulk material. Various examples include insulator materials that become conductive, 

insoluble becoming more soluble and cytotoxicity changes as well. Some newly discovered 

particles worthy of mention have generated a particular interest in the chemical and 

semiconductors industries, namely some metallic oxides as aluminium, cerium, iron, zinc, 

titanium, silicon oxides, nanoclays, some metals like silver and gold, some polymers 

including dendrimers, fluorenes and polystyrene, and others as carbon black and nanotubes 

[2]. 

The health area is raising a great interest for nanoparticles as observed in the drug delivery 

field as their high surface area and adsorptive properties allow the fixation and transport of 

relevant biological compounds or drugs to specific sites, improving the performance of 

controlled drug delivery systems [3, 4]. 

Tissue engineering is also an area with great expectations regarding nanoparticles because 

their nanometric size allows the mimetization of nanosized proteins and their high SSA 

and topographical nanoroughness allows the adsorption of specific proteins, a critical stage

in cell adhesion and proliferation as cells do not adhere directly to the material but to the 

initially adsorbed proteins [5]. Other applications in biology or medicine include 

Fluorescent biological labels, detection of pathogens or proteins, probing of DNA 

structure, tumour control, separation and purification of biological molecules or cells, 

contrast fluid and phagokinetic studies [6] 

Depending on their origin nanoparticles can either natural (volcanic/lunar dust, mineral) or 

anthropogenic. The anthropogenic nanoparticles can be unintentionally released, like in 

fossil fuels combustions, or can be engineered and designed to suit a certain purpose 

(engineered nanoparticles) [1].  

Nanometric sized particles are normally classified in the following categories (figure 2): 

nanoparticles, nanosheets, and nanorods [1]: 

 

Figure 2. Shape of nanomaterials: nanoparticles, nanotubes and nanosheets, adapted from 

[1]. 

Nanoparticles are those particles in which all the three dimensions are under 100 nm, 

nanotubes are those that have a high length/diameter ratio (fibers, tubes, rods) and two 

dimensions under 100 nm and nanosheets have only one dimension under 100 nm [1]. By 

extending the concept of aspect ratio, nanosized materials can also be conveniently

addressed and classified according with their dimensionality: one-dimensional - 1D 

(sheets, thin films), two-dimensional - 2D (tubes, rods and wires – may be attached on a 

substrate) or three-dimensional 3D (particles) if one, two or three dimensions are in the 

nanometre size, respectively. 2D particles have the largest aspect ratio as opposed to 3D 

like particles [7]. 

There is some controversy regarding this classification (table 2), since the imposed 100 nm 

as the upper limit is somewhat arbitrary. This limit is commonly considered to be the one 

at which the properties of the particles differ from the properties of the corresponding bulk 

materials, but there is no scientific solid evidence to support this statement and the change 

of properties may occur above this limit [3, 8].

the properties of bulk materials and single atoms or 

molecules."

of which have one or more dimensions of the order of 100 

nm or less, including structures, agglomerates or 

aggregates, which may have a size above the order of 100 

nm but retain properties that are characteristic to the 

nano-scale."

Kreyling, et al [8] point out that in broad size distributions the current nanoparticle 

definitions are difficult to apply, as they generally take in account only the average particle 

size. Most of the definitions also do not take into account nanostructure agglomerations, 

partially nanostructured materials and high surface area sub-micrometre particles [8]. 

As some materials may contain or accidently release a small amount of nanoparticles, it is 

important to correctly classify what can be considered or included in the nanoparticle 

definition, not only from the legal side but mainly to classify the risk associated with 

handling the materials and adequate the processes and exposure levels for minimizing the 

associated risk [2, 8]. 

Several attempts to correctly define a nanoparticle have been made throughout the years, 

taking into account agglomerates and suspensions, as well as limiting certain properties (at 

least a specific area ‘   ’ of 60 m
2
/g) [8]. There are particles that are sized under 100 nm 

that have a specific surface area under 60 m
2
/g which are obviously nanoparticles. 

Therefore Kreyling, et al [8] propose limiting the minimum specific surface area per unit 

of volume ‘    ’ to 60 m
2
/cm

3
 as a way to complement the nanoparticle definitions. 

Doing so, these authors consider that it is possible to easily classify nanosized materials, 

nanostructured materials, as well as nanodispersions. The VSSA can be calculated by 

relating the ‘   ’ [m
2
/g], determined by BET procedure, and the material density ‘ ’ 

[g/cm
3
] by equation 1 [8]: 

                 (equation 1) 

 

An uncontrolled nanoparticles release may have a great impact on the environment and on 

the society itself. As most of nanoparticle toxicity studies are focused on the effects and 

impact of accidently discharged and inhaled nanoparticles originated by combustion 

processes, the effect of engineered nanoparticles remains obscure. As combustion 

generated nanoparticles are often considered as accounting for several health problems [3], 

the extrapolation that engineered nanoparticles have the same adverse effects cannot be 

ruled out without further toxicity studies. Considering the possibility of nanoparticle 

hazardous impacts it seems mandatory to characterize several nanoparticle parameters such 

as [2, 3]:

? Chemical composition and purity.  

? Crystal structure and crystallinity. 

? Particles size distribution and morphology. 

? Specific surface area.  

? State of aggregation. 

? Surface condition (zeta potential, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, etc.).  

? Solubility.  

? Synthesis method and post-synthesis changes. 

The three pathways for obtaining nanoparticles imply a solid to solid or a liquid to solid or 

a gas to solid conversion. Examples as high energy milling, sol-gel process and vapour 

phase deposition are popular approaches (table 3) for nanoparticle production. However for 

bioaplications a strict control of particle size and topography is required and most of these 

techniques do not respond as desired to these needs. In many solution routes the use of 

surfactants, capping agents and templates has been useful for controlling the size and the 

shape of the nanoparticle [6].

However the available options for producing nanoparticles with controlled particle shape 

and size are limited to a few (table 4), often needing additional steps like calcination or 

milling that are prohibitively expensive and ruinous for the sake of morphology control. 

Therefore the development of simpler and effective synthesis processes, ideally at low 

temperature is required to further supply the demand. From this point of view chemical 

solution precipitation methods appear very attractive and worthy of research investment.

B. Nanocomposites bioapplications 

 

There are several applications benefiting from the combination of polymers and 

nanoparticles properties as found in many different areas as tissue engineering, specifically 

in nerve guide channels and bone implants, or in other fields as antimicrobial materials. 

The next section will review few representative examples of such applications. 

  

B1. Nerve guide channels 

 

In the late 80’s tissue engineering research grew exponentially, namely nerve regeneration 

therapy [10]. Current grafting techniques can be summarized as [11]: 

? Autografts: the graft is collected from the patient’s body bearing full 

biocompatibility and no immune response. Being, considered as a gold standard its 

drawbacks are related to its limited availability. 

 

? Allografts: this type of graft is provided by a donor other than the patient and 

although it has the same capabilities as an autograft, the immune response may be 

superior, the availability is also low and there is an associated risk of disease 

transmission. 

 

? Xenografts: for this type of graft the implantation source is other species, and it 

carries itself an increased immune response probability and higher disease 

transmission risk.   

As each of these approaches poses some risks, particularly the used materials in allograft 

or xenograft and the lack of reliable sources, the development of mimetic materials seems 

to be a promising approach. In the last decade nerve tissue regeneration strategies have 

been revised because clinical trials did not confirm the growth factors effects observed in 

in vitro studies. Some difficulties emerged also from other issues such as the cellular 

complexity of the nervous system which requires different approaches for different cell 

types, or the difficulties of transposing laboratory modelling to the operation site [10]. 



Compósitos PU/ZnO para aplicações biomédicas                             Universidade de Aveiro

Early attempts of nerve defects repair often resulted in failure. However as micro-surgery 

concept was consolidated, the trials success rate improved allowing the individual 

alignment of the nerves and minimizing the tension generated from stretching and suturing 

the two nerve ends directly. For the successful achievement nerve guide channels play an 

important role. Guide channels are tubes within which the two ends of a damaged nerve are 

allowed to grow and attach and thus recover faster. There may exist a lot of materials that 

can be possibly used as guide channels. However some key properties are required such as 

[5, 10]: 

? To be easily processed for allowing the achievement of the desired diameter and 

wall thickness. 

? To be of simple implantation through microsurgery. 

? To be sterilizable.  

? To be biocompatible and biodegradable. 

Permanent inert materials, as opposed to biocompatible and biodegradable materials, can 

also be used in nerve repair strategies, but not only they carry higher risk of infection, they 

also elicit connective tissue responses, can compress nerves or become dislodged [10]. 

The peripheral nerve tissues ‘PNS’ may spontaneously recover or are easier to be aided in 

recovery (figure 3A). Contrarily central nervous system ‘CNS’ tissues generally need the 

aid of guide channels to regenerate, as there are several factors such as inhibitory cues or 

absence of stimulatory cues that prevent spontaneous tissue recovery (figure 3B) [5].

system (PNS) recovery. B) Central nervous system (CNS) auto-inhibition, adapted from

Synthetic materials are a promising choice to replace the autologous material and its 

associated risks, as it is possible to incorporate several strategies as cell transplants, 

topographic and electrical stimulation. These strategies alo ne have been proved to work 

well but their combined efficiency is not known yet in nerve guide channels, thus requiring 

further studies to develop and evaluate the next generation of nerve guide channels [5]. 

   

B2. Bone implants 

 

In our current society bone fractures and several bone diseases, like cancer, osteoporosis, 

and osteoarthritis are becoming more and more common, due to the increased human life 

expectancy and to the modern life style. The limited life time of the common implants 

results from several issues like implant loosening, inflammation, infection and debris 

release, which makes urgent the development of novel materials able of a better bone 

bonding with larger life time and bone regeneration abilities [13]. 

These objectives have pushed orthopaedic medicine to study bone tissue regeneration and 

growth, as osseous defects greatly influence human quality of live and longevity. 

Biologically bone tissue is a very dynamic and extremely complex system, with a great 

regenerative capacity. Bone tissue is composed of a myriad of interleaved components 

which give rise to a complex structure. Healthy bone is roughly composed by 70% of a 

nanohydroxyapatite mineral phase and by 30% of collagen organic phase. Other elements 

present in smaller quantities include citrate, carbonate, sodium, magnesium, zinc, 

potassium and a wide variety of noncollagenic proteins [14]. 

The needs underlying the regeneration of severe bone defects resulting from traumas, 

tumours or anomalies require the application of implants or grafting techniques 

(autografting, allografting, xenografting). To date the limitations to these techniques come 

from the unavailability of the biological material, the immunologic adverse responses or 

from the inadequacy of the synthetic materials [14].  



Compósitos PU/ZnO para aplicações biomédicas                             Universidade de Aveiro 

15 

 

There is a need to develop new grafting materials able of mimicking the biological 

components ability to [14, 11] induce osteoblasts adhesion and proliferation as well as 

vascularisation [15]. 

 

It was observed that electric current promotes osteogenesis, and thus it has been 

hypothesised that the internal forces induced by an external electric field generate electric 

signals that transport information to bone cells allowing the regulation of their biological 

functions [15]. Collagen fibers are aligned polar proteins, and thus when deformed they 

generate an electrical current and vice-versa (piezoelectricity). It has been proposed that 

piezoelectricity may have a fundamental role in bone growth, remodelling and 

regeneration. Piezoelectric materials with mimetization capabilities are attractive an 

approach in skeletal regeneration [16]. 

 

B3. Inert bioimplants 

 

Sometimes an approach different from that intended to the promotion of cell adhesion and 

proliferation may be required. In many devices, like catheters, heart valves or sensors, 

among the various failure reasons are the interactions at the body/material interface like the 

adhesion and proliferation cells which are not desired at the body/material interface. 

Catheters are particularly prone to bacterial film formation and subsequent infection 

especially in a long term usage. This film is formed soon after implantation, a process 

called surface conditioning, and its composition is manly conditioned by the chemical 

nature and the design of the implant. The main problem is that even non-pathogenic 

entities may cause infections which require the removal of the implant with its associated 

risks. Therefore the development of new materials able of reducing the bacterial film 

formation and the interaction with body fluids is needed in order to improve implant life 

and body acceptance [17].

1.2. Zinc oxide 

 

Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a binary semiconductor that in normal pressure and temperature 

condition crystallises preferably in Wurtzite hexagonal structure (figure 4) and appears in 

nature as zincite mineral. The hexagonal ZnO belongs to the space group P63mc or C6v
4
, 

point group 6 mm or C6v and its typical lattice are [18, 19]: 

      

           

           

 
Figure 4. ZnO wurtzite hexagonal structure, adapted from [URL1]. 

 

Each ion present is tetrahedrically coordinated, meaning that an ion is surrounded by four 

ions of opposite signal, and the distribution occurs in ab plane intercalated sheets of cations 

‘Zn
2+

’ and sheets of anions ‘O
2-

’ along the c axis [18, 19]. 

The terminal surfaces of this crystalline structure in the c axis are the (    ) of Zn
2+

 

cations and the (    ) of O
2- 

anions. The strong polarity of these terminations gives rise to 

like piezoelectricity or spontaneous polarization. The chemical bond classification lies 

between pure covalent and pure ion as in this material exists sp3 bonding as well as a 

strong ion character in the Zn-O bonding [18, 19]. 

The interest in ZnO for optoelectronics application lies in properties such as a wide band 

gap (~3,37 eV) or large exciton binding energy (~60 meV). As the work wavelength of 

ZnO lies between ultraviolet (UV) and blue radiation, ZnO research was electronic

oriented and it was based almost solely bulk properties (i.e. crystal growth, doping, band 

structure, lasers or sensors) [18, 19]. 

 

A. ROS formation 

 

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can spontaneously form in the nanoparticles surface, more 

particularly in the crystalline defect present in them. Generally they appear by reaction in 

the materials surface of adsorbed oxygen species and electron/hole pairs. The more 

electron/hole pairs exists in the material surface the more ROS are formed. This can be 

enhanced by rising the number of interstitial zinc that leading to electron/hole pairs ‘    ? ’ 

[20]. 

Typically these electronic species can be achieved by irradiating the material with 

electromagnetic radiation, namely UV, promoting valence electrons to the conduction band 

leaving behind the corresponding holes. With nanoparticles it is expected that with the 

increased of surface area the site defects (i.e. interstitial Zn) also increase leading to more 

available electronic defects even in the absence of radiation [20].  

Even if the mechanisms of ROS formation are not fully understood several mechanisms 

have been proposed. One of those will be used to illustrate what possibly happens in 

aqueous solutions (Figure 5) (electronic species    and    are written in Kröger-vink 

notation and radical species are noted with a dot ‘ ’ on the left to avoid misinterpretations) 

[20].

Through UV radiation one electron/hole pair is formed in the material surface. The 

electronic hole ‘  ’ reacts with one water molecule to form the ion pair ‘ +    ? ’ while 

the free electron ‘  ’ reacts with one oxygen molecule to form the superoxide radical anion 

‘   
 

’ (1). The ‘   
 

’ radical may react with the ‘ +’ ion forming the hydroperoxyl 

radical ‘    ’ that may further react with another free electron originating the hydrogen 

peroxide anion ‘   
 

’ (2). The reaction can end if a peroxide molecule ‘    ’ is formed 

by the reaction of the ‘ +’ ions and ‘   
 

’ (3) [20]. 

 

B. Bio zinc oxide 

 

It is expected that with particle size reduction below the nanometre range, namely sub 

micrometre and nanometre, that the materials properties are greatly enhanced and 

improving and potentiate their applicability in the biomaterials area. In this area the 

cytotoxic effects of ZnO nanoparticles are not fully known and therefor it is a major topic 

in biomaterials research and investigation [1-4]. 

Nanoparticles properties can be adverse to biological systems, but several studies shows 

the possibilities of their usefulness to potentiate and valorise those same properties in 

biological applications to improve the humankind quality of life. ZnO appears to have a 

great potential to be a key item in biomedical applications, namely in controlled drug 

delivery, cellular regeneration or biomarker, and therefor ZnO nanoparticles cytotoxicity 

must be fully evaluated so its effect can be known [4]. 

It is accepted that ZnO cytotoxicity (figure 6) is related to two fundamental factors [4]: 

? Surface effects: ROS release form the particles surface that reacts with cellular 

walls and breaks them by means of lipid peroxidation, exposing the cellular 

nucleus. ROS can then penetrate the cell and react with nucleic acid and proteins 

(i.e. enzyme deactivation). Even cells with great anti-oxidant potential can be 

broken and enter oxidative stress if the natural antioxidants are fully depleted. 

 

? Mechanical effect: Stress originated from the interface particle/cell and it is related 

with the size and form of the particles.

B1. Controlled drug delivery systems 

 

Nanoparticles have the advantage of being in the same size order of biomolecules or 

biological structural units, and by so they can dynamically interact with the cellular surface 

or interior or penetrate barriers that micrometre particles can’t. This was possible by the 

advances, in recent years, of the comprehension of the human body to the molecular and 

nanometric levels but the treatment methods that could benefit from this knowledge didn’t 

follow this lead [23]. 

Currently none or few alternatives exist to chemo/radiotherapy in cancer disease treatment. 

Both treatments are often accompanied by several adverse effects, such as medullar tissue 

suppression, neurotoxicity and poor selectivity, as its administration can hardly be called

local. Nanotechnology and nanomedicine open new doors in focussed treatment which 

could obviate these troubles as nanoparticles can act as an active principle, drug carrier or 

both [23]. 

 

B1.1. Selective cytotoxicity 

 

When Cory Hanley, et al [23] investigated the effect of ZnO exposition in cultures 

activated T cells lines it was observed that to a concentration of 10 mM of ZnO activated T 

cells were less viable than the non-activated counterparts. Further, in complementary tests 

of co-cultures of cancerous cells and healthy cell lines viability of the cancerous ones were 

several times less than the healthy ones. It is also verified that the cytotoxicity of ZnO 

nanoparticles is dose dependant, as with increased dose cytotoxicity of the system 

increases to both types of cells, but there is an evident selectivity of toxic effects to the 

unhealthy cell lines. Other tests indicate that ZnO nanoparticles induce cell apoptosis by 

means of ROS, which leads to say that the toxicity is in fact related to the proliferation rate 

of the exposed cells (cancerous replicate extremely fast) [23]. Other authors observed the 

same pattern and behaviour in other systems, namely Mariappan Premanathan, et al [24] in 

cultures of leukaemia cells (HL60) and mononuclear blood cells (PBMC), stating that ZnO 

nanoparticles exert a strong cytotoxic effect on the leukaemia line, inducing apoptosis 

through lipid peroxidation [24]. 

 

B1.2. Synergy action 

 

Photo dynamic therapy (PDT) is currently being studied as a mean to obviate cancer’s 

normal treatment methods. If the cells are resistant to chemicals and drugs normal 

treatment methods can be inhibited. The action of a specific wave length radiation on a 

photosensitiser located in specific target sites will promote the release of ROS with 

capability do destroy and avoid the proliferation of malignant cells. [4]. 



Compósitos PU/ZnO para aplicações biomédicas                             Universidade de Aveiro 

21 

 

As zinc oxide is a known photosensitiser, Dadong Guo, et al [4] studied the synergetic 

effect of ZnO NPs loaded with daunorrubicin drug in PDT of leukaemia multiresistant 

cancer cell lines. The cytotoxic effect of ZnO NPs was observed on both cell types 

(leukaemia and multiresistant counterparts), and the action on both cell lines was the same 

at higher concentrations. The effect is enhanced by the radiation as the ROS released from 

ZnO NPs break the cellular wall resulting in cytoplasm efflux, more drug and ROS cell 

penetration which results in cell death [4]. The same phenomenon was observed by 

Jingyuan Li, et al [25] and Haijun Zhang [21] in other types of cell lines. 

 

B1.3. Role of particle size 

 

Particle size may influence the material cytotoxicity, especially in nanometre scale. 

Dadong Guo, et al [4] observed practically no difference in the toxicity of 20, 60 and 100 

nm particles at the same concentrations in leukaemia normal and multiresistant cell line 

[4]. 

However at concentrations above 25 µg/ml cell viability greatly decreased on both types of 

cultures, but being more pronounced in multiresistant leukaemia cell line [4]. 

On the other hand Shantikumar Nair, et al [26] observed that cytotoxicity had a strong 

dependency on the particle size in cultures on cancerous osteoblasts. In their investigations 

at low concentrations smaller size particles were more cytotoxic but at higher 

concentration levels the behaviour of those same particles was the same. Particles under 

350 nm were more effective at lower concentration than micrometric particles, as the toxic 

behaviour can be seen at 100 µM and it reaches the maximum at 500 µM [26].  

 

B1.4. Role of particle morphology 

 

As the size of particle may influence toxicity of NPs, particle morphology can also 

influence NPs toxicity. Rizwan Wahab, et al [27] investigated the influence of the 



Compósitos PU/ZnO para aplicações biomédicas                             Universidade de Aveiro 

22 

 

concentration of several types of nanostructures (NS) in U87 and HeLa cell lines. The NS 

investigated were microflowers of nanorods (MFR), microflowers of nanosheets (MFS) 

and nanoparticles aggregated microspheres (NAM) that were compared to loose 

nanoparticles [27]. 

These authors, as the others mentioned above, observed that NP and NS cytotoxicity in 

both cultures rise in a dose dependent way. These authors also observed that NAM and 

MFS were more toxic than nanoparticles alone and MFR. According to these authors 

nanoparticles morphology can be related to cytotoxicity, but further studies are still needed 

in determining the specific effect and mechanisms behind this influence [27]. 

  

B1.5. Role of zinc ions 

 

Zinc oxide has low solubility in aqueous medium, but some authors point out the 

possibility that the ‘   +’ ions originated from the nanoparticles dissolution may influence 

and actively participate on the cytotoxicity of ZnO nanoparticles [28].  

W. Song, et al [28] show that when Ana-1 cell lines are exposed to NPs concentration 

below ZnO solubility the cells are more exposed to ‘   +’ ions and therefor they associate 

the toxicity to this ion. When the cell lines are exposed to NPs concentration above ZnO 

solubility the cation concentration is so low that their contribution practically irrelevant, in 

favour of the effects associated with particle specified above [28]. 

On the other hand P. J. Moos, et al [29] didn’t found any correlation between ‘   +’ 

cation release on the ZnO cytotoxicity in RKO colon cancerous cell lines and affirm that to 

those cells cytotoxicity is due to particle cell contact. 

In agreement with P. J. Moos, et al [29], M. Ahamed, et al [30] also didn’t attributed ZnO 

NPs cytotoxicity to the cations released from nanorods in contact with A549 cell lines. It is 

however observed that the cytotoxic effect of higher concentration of this ion is lower that 

the oxidative stress imposed by the same amount of ZnO nanorods.

B2. Antibacterial/fungi properties 

 

ZnO particles also have antibacterial/fungi properties, as O. Yamamoto [31] finds a string 

size a concentration dependency on antibacterial activity in Escherichia coli (E. Coli) and 

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteria cultures. The effect of particle size reduction 

from 800 to 100 nm was more pronounced in the E. Coli bacteria colony [31]. 

The proposed action mechanisms of antibacterial activity are attributed to [26]: 

? ROS release from the particles surface 

? Ion release from the particles surface 

? Bacteria cell membrane rupture 

? Internalization of the particles 

As a photo-active material, ZnO antibacterial studies often rely on UV radiation of the 

material, which shows the importance the ROS released on the fotocatalitic activity of the 

material. On the other hand there are some reports that even without the UV radiation this 

material presents inhibitory properties relatedly to E. Coli bacteria [26, 32].  

Taking into account another route, S. Nair, et al [26] discuss the effect of surfactant agents 

on the antibacterial properties of NPs, as diethyleneglycol surfactant for example can 

damage gram-positive S. Aureus bacteria’s membranes undermining the evaluation of the 

effect of NPs themselves. It is quite relevant to determine if the surfactant has any effect on 

these properties as it may unintentionally come from the NPs production stage. There are 

studies that indicate that polyethyleneglycol acts as free radical trap site obstructing their 

action on bacteria’s membranes leading to antibacterial activities in the interaction 

particle/membrane. On this account there is an increased effect on gram-negative E. Coli 

than in gram-positive S. Aureus, possibly attributed to the thicker membrane which resists 

more effectively to the mechanical action of ZnO NPs [26].  

Conversely M. Premanathan, et al [24] observed a stronger effect on the gram-positive S. 

aureus, when they studied the antibacterial activity in E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. 

Aeruginosa) e S. aureus strains, possibly to the inexistence of surfactant agents which 

allows the action of other mechanisms besides the mechanical action [24].

B3. Bone tissue regeneration 

 

In search of new biomimetic materials it was found that the ‘   +’ ion besides being 

osteoconductive stimulates also osteogenesis [33]. Zinc is also a trace element in bone 

structure, and is often associated with bone development, as it intervenes in the 

calcification mechanism, participates in numerous biological phenomena, and zinc 

deficiency promotes late bone growth [34]. ZnO nanoparticles appear as a biomimetic 

particle that could supply the bone surround with ‘   +’ ions and induce osteoconduction 

by its piezoelectric properties.  

J. K. Park, et al [35] observed the growth and osseointegration of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts 

cell line in ZnO nanoflowers deposited in silicon substrates. These authors observed a 

rapid proliferation of the osteoblasts throughout the ZnO nanostructures potentiated by the 

samples roughness. In vivo evidence shows that it possible to integrate this material in live 

bone matrix and that ZnO may have an active role in adhesion, proliferation and growth 

bone matrix [35]. 

 

B4. Nerve guide channels 

 

Biomimetic materials capable of better interactions with the body are needed to improve 

current guide channel implants, and by so the approach of multi-stimuli is being 

investigated [12]. This way nanoZnO polymer composites can be engineered into scaffolds 

that mimic the natural neural support tissue with the possibilit y of electrical charge neuron 

regeneration aid. ZnO nanoparticles natural antibacterial properties may reduce infection 

risks associated with the implantation of the device. J. T. Seil and T. J. Webster (2008) 

have studied a polyurethane/ZnO nanocomposite for as nerve guide channel in CNS 

recovery. These composites not only possess two of the mentioned strategies they also 

have the characteristic of decreasing astroglial cell adhesion and proliferation, the cells that 

create the most prominent factor that alts the CNS regeneration, the glial scar [5].

1.3. Polyurethane 

 

Polyurethanes (PUs) are a vast family of synthetic polymers of complex chemical structure 

when compared with simpler polymers, such as polyethylene or polypropylene. The 

complex structure is formed when three distinct monomers are combined through specific 

chemical reactions originating the polymer chains. The monomers, diisocyanate, 

macroglycol and chain extender, can react and organize in multiple ways, giving rise to an 

infinity of materials with distinct mechanic and physico-chemical properties. The 

versatility of these materials arises from the fact that it is possible to alter its chemistry 

depending on the needed application. The changes can be carried out by altering either the 

raw materials or the processing conditions [36]. 

PUs were first synthesized in 1937 by Otto Bayer and coworkers and till today have been 

typically applied as elastomers, foams, adhesives and paints. Besides the named 

applications, polyurethanes found niche market as a biomaterial as they possess unique 

mechanical properties, especially fatigue resistance. The biological response and bio-

stability of these materials is conditioned by the surface properties, and those are greatly 

influenced by the chemistry and synthesis procedure, as both variables influence the 

composition and distribution of the carbonated chains through the material [36]. 

 

A. Polyurethane’s chemical structure 

 

The combinations of the diisocyanate, polyol and chain extender originate two different 

micro-domains that typically characterise a PU. One is a hard segment originated by the 

reaction of diisocyanate and chain extender and the other is a soft segment originated by 

the oligomer polyol. Typical polyurethanes can be represented by [37]: 

  ( (  )   )  

Were ‘ ’ is the polyol, ‘ ’ the diisocyanate and ‘ ’ the chain extender. As these three 

elements can be differently combined, the PUs properties will depend of the hard/soft 

segment ratio and the monomers nature [37].

A1. Diisocyanate 

 

The diisocyanate is a chemical compound of low molecular weight with two isocyanate 

terminal groups. The isocyanate terminations allow this monomer to chemical bond to a 

polyol or chain extender forming linear chains, or ramifications if more isocyanate groups 

are added, either aliphatic or aromatic. From the industrial or biomedical point of view 

diphenylmethane-diisocyanate (MDI) (4), hydrogenated diphenylmethane-diisocyanate 

(HMDI) (5) and toluene diisocyanate (TDI) (6) are the most important ones.

Polyurethane synthesis works by either reactions of urethanes links formation, as an 

isocyanate terminal group reacts with hydroxyl groups (polyol or chain extender (7), or by 

urea links formation if a diamine is used as chain extender (8) [36].

       +                                 (8) 

                                                                
  
   

      

 

Isocyanate groups are so reactive that they easily react with hydrogen in acid medium and 

can originate either a foam or high urea content, and so reactions with water (9) should be 

avoided as they will lead to by-products formation, not always desired [36].

The near perfect packing of the ring structures [ (    )   or  (     )  ] present in the 

diisocyanate and the strong intermolecular interactions, namely hydrogen and urethane 

groups bonding, give rise to rigid microdomains in opposition to the polyol part. The 

segregation of the hard segment segregation from the bulk is dependent on the type of 

monomer used, and determines the microdomains formation, crystallinity and the 

mechanical properties of the compound. Chain packing is also influenced by the size, 

symmetry and ring rotation, in a way that compact, rigid and symmetrical  diisocyanate 

molecules leads to better packing than asymmetric and flexible ones, and by so increases 

the mechanical properties. The bulk properties also depend on the type of ring presented by 

the diisocyanate. The rigidity of the molecule is higher in the presence of an aromatic ring 

as the   electrons delocalization through the ring does not allow boat/chair conformations 

making the molecule stiffer [36]. 

 

A2. Polyols 

 

The polyol monomer is the polyurethane chain soft segment former. Polyols are oligomer 

macromolecules with hydroxyl terminal groups and have repeating units based on 

polyether or polyester, (10) and (11) respectively [36]: 

                        (10) 

                       (11) 

             
  
   

 

 

 

In which ‘  ’ is the hydroxyl group, ‘ ’ e ‘  ’ are carbonated chains, ‘ ’ is oxygen and 

‘ ’ and ‘ ’the number of monomers. The aliphatic structure and low intermolecular 

interaction allows the macromolecules some degree of rotation and bending by which 



Compósitos PU/ZnO para aplicações biomédicas                             Universidade de Aveiro 

28 

 

segregation from the bulk originates soft microdomains. Branched or reticulated structures 

are obtained by the use of more hydroxyl groups per molecule. [36]. 

Typical polyol macromolecules are polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMO, PTMEG or 

PTMG) (12), polypropylene glycol (PPG) (13), polyethylene adipate (PA) (14) and 

poly(1,6-hexyl 1,2 ethyl carbonate)diol (PHECD) (15).

Chain packing of polyols also influences the mechanical properties of the polymer, and it 

is achieved by structural regularity and symmetry of the molecule [36]. 

Chemical or hydrolytic degradations are extremely influenced by the polyol choice. 

Polyester-urethanes hydrogen bonding through ester groups enhances the mechanical 

properties of the bulk at the expense of an increase in hydrolytic degradation susceptibility. 

The alternative, polyether-urethanes, are highly chemical resistant with oxygen bond 

cleavage occurring in acidic medium, which prevents hydrolytic degradations, but instead 

they oxidize in contact with air [38] with release of peroxides and impoverishment of 

mechanical performance [36].

A3. Chain extender 

 

The chain extender is a hydroxyl or amino terminated small molecule that plays a key role 

in the mechanical properties of the PUs. The direct reaction of polyols and diisocyanates 

often results in soft rubber. When the chain extender molecules react with the 

diisocyanates ones they form a hard segment that segregates from the bulk, which acts as 

both a filler and reticulation spot increasing  the overall mechanical properties. 

Polyurethane or polyurethane-urea can be achieved by using either dyols or diamines 

respectively, typically 1,4-buthanediol (BD) (16) or ethylenediamine (ED) (17) [36]. 

   (   )             (16) 

  

                                    

    (   )                                             (17) 
 

 

The mechanical resistance of the polyurethanes is influenced by the type of chain extender 

molecules that act in the same way as the polyol. Another key aspect is the monomer 

concentration, as a large concentration originates a large quantity of hard segments by 

diisocyanate reaction and microdomain segregation, leading to harder, stiffer and more 

resistant polyurethanes [36]. 

 

B. Thermal history 

 

Hard and soft micro-domain distribution depends not only on composition but also on the 

thermal history of the polyurethane. PUs based in MDI/BD, for example, form semi-

crystalline compact domains during annealing, but a change in micromorphology may 

occur if stretching is also applied. As the micro-domains take an elongated shape, the 

melting point of the bulk material also changed to lower values. Polymorphs can also form 

during the material processing which may impact the final properties of the material. The 

mechanical and thermal properties of a PU may be highly affected by the bulk thermal 

history [36].

C. Polyurethanes bioaplications 

 

The selection of a biomaterial should be made by finding a material which suits the 

application, taking into account that their characteristics and behaviour should be as 

proximate as possible to the chosen substitution part. The bio-stability and biological 

response characteristics, often determined by surface properties, are the decisive criteria 

when choosing a biomaterial. In this way mechanical properties are often disregarded as it 

is difficult to balance them with the host response and the high clinic requisites [36]. 

Polyurethanes are regarded as heterogeneous materials because of the two dist inct micro-

phases segregation that occurs in the bulk. The hard/soft segment segregation appears due 

to the nature of the antagonistic interactions between the polar urethane and the non-polar 

polyol segments. The segregation may preferably take place in certain locations depending 

on the interface polymer surface/surrounding environment. In this way when the polymer 

is surrounded by hydrophobic medium, such as air, the non-polar soft segment rises to the 

surface. Contrarily if surrounded by biological fluids (hydrophilic) the hard segments are 

the ones that segregate in the bulk surface. This indicates that the surrounding environment 

changes the surface characteristics of bulk polyurethanes and by doing so it also changes 

its biological response [36]. 

Biocompatibility of PUs has been reported in several studies. B. Saad, et al [39] produced 

PU formulations that didn’t induce cytotoxicity and were able to promote the adhesion, 

growth and activity of fibroblasts (3T3 cell line) demonstrating the usefulness of PU in 

bone implant fixation. 

Besides bone implants [40], polyurethanes are widely used as inert materials in many 

biomedical devices, such as heart valves [41] or catheters.  

Controlled drug delivery systems (CDDS) may be achieved by (bio)degradable 

polyurethanes. E. Jabbari and M. Khakpour [42] have shown that polyurethane 

microspheres can effectively be used in CDDS, and also proved that changes in chain 

extender concentration can drastically alter the polymer matrix porosity, a relevant 

parameter in engineered biomaterials. The authors showed that till 50% molar of chain 

extender there was a reduction in the pore size from 950 to 600 nm as the chains lose their 



Compósitos PU/ZnO para aplicações biomédicas                             Universidade de Aveiro 

31 

 

mobility. For higher concentrations, namely 60 and 67%, the chains became stiffer and 

porosity formation was inhibited [42]. 

The use of biodegradable polyurethanes instead of an inert matrix can be very interesting 

in delivery systems as they convert themselves into simpler organic products that can be 

mineralized and redistributed through biological cycles (carbon, nitrogen and sulphur) 

[43]. A challenging proposal by W. N. Sivak, et al [44] suggests that instead of loading the 

drugs (one or more) in the matrix, they could be chemically bonded to carbonated chains of 

a biodegradable PU. The authors stress that the implantation of such a device will 

gradually degrade along time releasing the drugs in a much more controlled way [44].

2. Materials &amp;amp; methods 

 

2.1. Procedure  

 

All the reagents and materials were used as purchased without any further purification. The 

Zn salt used was a 136.28 g/mole molar mass zinc chloride (Merck) and the chelating 

agent was a 210.14 g/mole molar mass citric acid monohydrate (Riedel-de Haën and 

Sigma-Aldrich). Zinc oxide commercial nanosized powder (&lt;100 nm) was acquired from 

Sigma-Aldrich (denominated cZnO) and polyurethane pellets (medical grade tecoflex 

SG80A polyurethane) were acquired from Fluka analytical. ZnO nanoparticles suspensor 

was a Fluka analytical 1,2-dichloroethane, polyurethane solvent was a Carlo Erba reagents 

chloroform. The base used was Akzo Nobel sodium hydroxide pellets and the absolute 

ethanol was a Carlo Erba reagents absolute ethanol. The tecoflex SG80A polyurethane and 

ZnO particles are food and drug administration (FDA) approved products. The polymer 

used, tecoflex SG80A, is a HMDI (diisocyanate), PTMEG (macrodiol) and BDO (chain 

extender) based linear polyurethane suitable for solvent evaporation casting, with a typical 

chemical structure (figure 7). According to the products data sheet this polyurethane 

properties can be found in table 5 [45]:

A. Nanoparticles production &amp;amp; characterization 

 

Different types of ZnO particles were obtained by a chemical precipitation method. The 

dissolution of citric acid (Cit) and zinc chloride [(Cit)/(ZnCl2) molar ratio = (3:1) to ensure 

the chelation of Zn
2+ 

ions] in 20-25 ml of deionized water under vigorous stirring was the  

common step to all the used precipitation procedures. Such solution will be referred as 

stock solution. The Zn concentration in the stock solution was 1.89 mmol/ml. After 20 

minutes of stirring the stock solution was clear and fully transparent. Three types of 

powders were produced by changing the processing conditions (figure 8): 

Method A: NaOH solution (10 molar) was added in a drop wise manner at an average rate 

of 6.15 ml/min to the stock solution under vigorous stirring till the formation of a white 

precipitate at pH 13.5. The final Zn/Na ratio in the precipitating medium was 0.3 (m/m) 

The precipitate was filtered and washed with deionized water and then dried at a moderate 

temperature (50 to 110 °C). This powder will be referred as pZnO.

Method B: A second type of powder was obtained by adding an ethanolic solution of 

NaOH (43%(v/v) ethanol) to the stock solution using the same adding rate as referred for 

pZnO so as to achieve a final Zn/Na ratio of 0.3 (m/m). The formed white precipitate was 

centrifuged and washed and then dried at 50 °C. This powder was labelled as mZnO. 

Method C: The third type of powder was produced by adding a NaOH solution (10 M) to 

an ethanolic solution of ZnCl2. This etanolic solution was obtained by adding ethanol and 

NaOH to the stock solution (43%(v/v) ethanol); the final pH of the resulting solution was 

~12. The addition rate of NaOH solution to the ethanolic solution of ZnCl2 was the same as 

in (i) and (ii). The obtained precipitated powder was centrifuged, washed and then dried 50 

°C. This powder is named as rZnO.

All powders were observed by SEM on a SU-70 Hitachi SEM. Crystalline phase and 

crystallite size were accessed by XRD on a rigaku geiguflex diffractometer in a 10° &amp;lt;2? &amp;lt;

80° range, speed 3°/minute and a step of 0.02°. Crystallite size of the powders were 

determined for 2?=46.5°, a coinciding peak of the ZnO powder and the diffractometer 

internal pattern, with a         =     
  rad and form factor of 0.9. Elemental phase 

composition was confirmed by EDS equipment coupled with the electron microscope. 

Specific surface area, pore size and pore size distribution were determined by N2 isotherm 

analysis obtained with a micromeritics datamaster equipment with a purge temperature 200 

°C and saturation pressure of 102 kPa. 

 

B. PU/ZnO composite films production and characterization 

 

All the composites (0, 2 and 50 %wt ZnO) samples were prepared by a solvent evaporation 

method using an adaptation of the J. T. Seil and T. J. Webster procedure (figure 9) [5]. To 

produce pure tecoflex SG80A films, the polyurethane pellets were dissolved in chloroform 

(2.47%wt PU) till complete dissolution and casted on a 10 ml glass cup. The solvent 

evaporation occurred during at least 12 hours at 37 °C. 

Chloroform’s mass and volume was adjusted to correspond the desired weight to either 

produce 2%wt or 50%wt ZnO composite films, maintaining the same PU/chloroform ratio. 

The powders used were: the commercial cZnO and the precipitated pZnO, mZnO and 



Compósitos PU/ZnO para aplicações biomédicas                             Universidade de Aveiro 

 

 

39 

 

rZnO. The chosen powders reflect the desire to determine the influence of the different 

morphologies and crystallinity of the powders in the properties of the composites. 

For producing 2%wt PU/ZnO composites 0.239 %wt ZnO particles ZnO powder were mixed 

with 1,2-dichloroethane and sonicated during 5 minutes. The sonicated powder was mixed 

with the PU solution and sonicated further for 10 minutes. Solvents evaporation occurred 

at 37 °C overnight. The composites (98:2 %wt PU/ZnO) were nominated as C2, P2 or R2 

according to the used ZnO powder label, i.e. cZnO, pZnO and rZnO, respectively. 

The 50%wt ZnO composites were obtained following the same procedure, adjusting the 

mass/volume of PU solution and maintaining the same PU/chloroform ratio. Roughly the 

ZnO powder was mixed with 1,2-dichoroethane (5,65 %wt ZnO) and  sonicated during 5 

minutes, followed by mixture with PU solution and sonicated during 10 minutes. The 

solvents evaporation occurred overnight at 37 °C, and the resulting films (50:50 %wt 

PU/ZnO) were nominated C50, P50 or R50 according to ZnO nomenclature, cZnO, pZnO 

and rZnO, respectively.

The polyurethane and composites films were 250 µm thick shaped disks (diameter 20 

mm). The PU film was completely transparent and its opacity increased with increasing 

ZnO particles concentration, in such a way that with 50 %wt the films were completely 

opaque. 

The composites preparation is summarized in table 7.

(at least 10 counts/sample). DSC analysis was performed on pure PU films and 

P2 and P50 composites on a shimadzu dsc-60 differential scanning calorimeter, from -80 to 

200 °C and at a heating speed of 25 °C/min. Polyurethane samples were tested as casted 

and dried at 70 °C, while P2 and P50 composites were tested only after drying and at least 

two runs were made by sample.

C. Composites In vitro assays 

 

C1. Bioactivity assay  

 

The bioactivity assay was carried out following T. Kokubo, et al procedures and 

recommendations [47]. Briefly 10 samples of pure PU, 2%wt and 50%wt composites films 

were deposited in 30 ml flasks. After sterilization with UV light the flasks were filled with 

corrected synthetic body fluid (SBF) and sterilized again. The samples were incubated at 

37 °C and collected after 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days of soaking (two samples each). All the 

samples were observed by SEM and characterized by EDS. The remaining SBF solutions 

of 1, 7 and 21 days of immersion were analysed by ICP on a Jobin-Yvon JY70 plus 

equipment for accessing their Ca, P and Zn ion contents. The results displayed as the mean 

± standard deviation. 

 

C2. Cell viability  

 

The resazurin metabolic assay (resazuin reduction to fluorescent resorufin) was employed 

to determine cytotoxicity and biocompatinility of the produced nanocomposites to MC3T3 

pre-osteoblastic cell line following S. Pina, et al [48] procedure at 50% cell confluence. 

The test was conducted with 2%wt C2 and P2 composites, 50%wt C50, P50, R50 as casted 

and R5021 (SBF 21 days) and the controls used were cells incubated in a well, pure PU film 

and cZnO and pZnO powders, after UV light sterilization. All experiments were conducted 

in triplicate (except R50 samples that were only one) and expressed as the mean   

standard error. The essay was carried by covering 24 well plates with the 

polymer/composite samples and 50 mg of either one of the ZnO powders. 1x10

 cells were 

prior deposited in each well (cell density was 1x10

) and cultured in cell medium. 

The cell medium contained 2mM glutamine (with minimum essential ?-medium in Eagle’s 

balanced salt solution supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum), 1% (v/v) of U 

mg/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin solution (Gibco BRL, Invitrogen) and 3.7 g/l 

NaHCO3. Cell culture occurred at 37 °C in humified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The

resazurin assay was carried by replacing the growth medium with fresh medium containing 

10% resazurin (Sigma Aldrich) in phosphate buffer saline (0.1 mg/ml - Pierce, Perbio). 

After 4 hours of incubation the medium was collected and cell viability was evaluated by 

detecting resazurin reduction at 570 and 600 nm with a varian cary 50 BIO spectrometer.

2.2. Techniques description 

 

A. X-ray diffraction – XRD 

 

The X-ray diffraction is a powerful technique that allows the identification of the 

crystalline phases of a crystalline material. This technique s is based on the constructive 

phenomenon of diffracted radiation by verifying the Bragg law [49, 50]: 

                     (equation 2) 

 

Where ‘  ’ is the constructive phase difference, ‘    ’ is distance between two parallel 

planes and ‘ ’ the reflection angle between a crystallographic plane and the incident 

radiation with content wavelength ‘ ’ [49]: 

For each of hkl planes present in the material a characteristic peak appears in the 

difractogram that can be identified by comparison with datasheets of well identified 

materials [49]. 

The crystallite size ‘ ’ may be estimated from a difractogram by following the Debye-

Scherrer equation [51]: 

  
  

     
         (equation 3) 

 

Where ‘ ’ is a form factor (0.89 to spherical surfaces), ‘ ’ the X-ray wavelength (typically 

1,54056  ?), ‘ ’ the width at half height of the peak (in radians) at ‘ ’ degrees (radians) 

were the diffraction occurred. 

‘ ’ can be established by relating the half height of the sample and pattern, ‘       ’ and 

‘       ’ respectively, for the same diffraction angle following the equation: 

          
 
        

 
       (equation 4)

B. N2 Isotherm analysis 

 

Isotherm is the relation at constant temperature of the gas quantity adsorbed at the surface 

of a material and the partial pressure at which it occurs. According to Braunauer, Emmet 

and Teller (BET), four basic steps can describe the gas adsorption on a material surface 

(figure 10) [52- 54]. 

 

 

Figure 10. Four steps in BET gas adsorption theory: initial adsorption process, monolayer 

formation, multilayer formation and pores filling [54]. 

 

On the first stage (1) the gas molecules adsorb at material surface through Van der Waals 

forces. With the raise of pressure more gas molecules adsorb till a complete monolayer is 

formed (stage 2) and with further pressure increase new gas adsorbed layers are formed 

(stage 3 and 4). This simplistic model can’t fully describe isotherms other than the 

International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) type II isotherms, as other 

phenomena, such as capillary condensation within mesopores, may give rise to other 

behaviours and consequentially to other isotherms [52]. 

 



Compósitos PU/ZnO para aplicações biomédicas                             Universidade de Aveiro 

 

 

45 

 

Capillary condensation is a phenomenon that occurs after the multilayer formation in 

which the gas further adsorbed condenses in the remaining pore volume. The liquid phase 

formed is separated by gaseous phase through a meniscus [52]. 

The IUPAC defines a pore as a cavity in which its depth is larger than its length.   

According to IUPAC pores are classified in function of the diameter ‘  ’ [52]: 

? Macropores:      50 nm 

? Mesopores: 0.2      50 nm 

? Micropores:     0.2 nm 

 

IUPAC predicts six isotherm patterns, i.e. type I to type VI isotherms as illustrated in 

figure 11:

? Type I: This isotherm is also known as Langmuir isotherm. This behaviour is found 

in microporous solids with low external surface area (activated carbon or zeolites). 

As the curve rises with increasing partial pressure it reaches a plateau near the end 

limited by micropore volume. 

 

? Type II: This isotherm is rather common to nonporous or macroporous solids and is 

associated to a monolayer formation (point B) and multilayer adsorption without 

restriction. 

 

? Type III: Type III isotherms are rare cases and generally do not have the B point. 

Some cases however present an undefined B point and in those cases the 

interactions adsorbate-adsorbate are more relevant than the adsorbate-adsorbent. 

 

? Type IV: Like type II this isotherm is characterized by multilayer formation and has 

a hysteresis loop cycle resulting from capillary condensation within mesopores. 

 

? Type V: Type V isotherm is also characterized by a hysteresis loop cycle, but 

instead of a multilayer formation it follows type III tendency in which the 

interaction of adsorbate-adsorbent are rather weak. 

 

? Type VI: This isotherm generally represents a step multilayer adsorption on 

nonporous uniform surfaces and each step is related to one layer formed.  

Isotherms IV and V hysteresis loops can exhibit four different patterns (H1 to H4 – see 

figure 12) normally associated to capillary condensation in mesopores with different 

geometry [52]: 

? Type H1: Related to agglomerates of spherical particles with narrow pore size 

distributions. 

 

? Type H2: Extremely difficult to interpret; network pore connectivity effects must 

be considered as the ink bottle pore shape approach as proven to be too simplistic 

 



Compósitos PU/ZnO para aplicações biomédicas                             Universidade de Aveiro 

 

 

47 

 

? Type H3: This loop pattern is exhibited by platelet aggregates with slit shaped 

pores. 

 

? Type H4: As in type H3, platelet aggregates may give rise to this pattern when slit 

pores are very narrow.

B1. BET specific surface area 

 

According to Braunauer, Emmet and Teller (BET) methodology, the specific surface area 

(SSA) may be determined from the linear part of the adsorption isotherm in the partial 

pressure range 0.05 to 0.30 through the BET equation (equation 5) [53]: 

 

  

 (  
 

  
)
 

   

   
 

 

  
+

 

   
       (equation 5) 

In which ‘
 

  
’ is the gas partial pressure, ‘ ’ is the amount of adsorbed gas, ‘  ’ the 

monolayer capacity and ‘ ’ is a constant related to the energy of monolayer formation é 

[53]. 

After the determination of ‘  ’ from the BET equation the SSA may be calculated by the 

equation: 

    
        

 
         (equation 6) 

In which ‘ ’ is the sample mass, ‘  ’ is the Avogadro constant and ‘  ’ is the area 

occupied by one molecule of adsorbate in the complete monolayer. Considering that the 

adsorbed N2 gas gives rise to a compact monolayer formation ‘  ’ equals 0,162 nm
2
 [53]. 

To be noted that in type II and IV isotherms associated to large mesopores the BET 

equation linearity is verified between 0.05 &amp;lt;
 

  
 &amp;lt;0.35. However for rather small 

mesopores  the linearity is verified at lower partial pressures, 0.05 &amp;lt;
 

  
 &amp;lt;0.20, and SSA is 

generally overestimated [55]. 

It is possible to determine the sphere equivalent particle size ‘SED’ from the SSA 

determined from the BET procedure [51]: 

    
 

     
        (equation 7) 

Were ‘ ’ is the theoretical density and ‘   ’ the specific surface area determined by BET 

procedure.

49 

 

B2. BJH pore volume and area distribution 

 

The isotherm desorption branch is used to correlate the quantity of lost gas to the pore 

average size for the case of the pores being emptied during each step of desorption. A pore 

loses its condensed liquid at a particular relative pressure that is related to the kelvin radius 

‘  ’ [52, 55], according to Kelvin equation: 

   
        

    (
 

  
)
         (equation 8) 

Were ‘  ’ is the Kelvin radius, ‘
 

  
’ partial pressure were the condensation occurs, ‘   ’ is 

the condensed surface energy, ‘  ’ is the condensed molar volume, ‘ ’ is the gas constant 

and ‘ ’ the temperature. An adsorbate layer is then left behind whose thickness ‘ ’ is 

determined by Halsey equation [52, 55] 

      [
  
 

  
]

     

       (equation 9) 

 

The adsorbate layer becomes thinner upon the partial pressure decrease. The total amount 

of desorbed gas ‘  ’ at a given pressure is equal to the amount of the lost condensed liquid 

‘  ’ plus the amount of the evaporated gas from the pores previously emptied ‘ ’ [47, 49], 

i.e.:  

     +                                                                (equation 10) 

 

Taking this into account it is possible to analyse type IV and V isotherms and determine 

the specific pore volume, the porosity, the pore size distribution and the average pore size 

[55]. 

Following Barret, Joyner, Halenda (BJH) procedure the following assumptions regarding 

pore morphology have to be kept in mind [55] 

 



Compósitos PU/ZnO para aplicações biomédicas                             Universidade de Aveiro 

 

 

50 

 

? The pores are regularly shaped and rigid  

? That micropores are negligible 

? The pore size distribution doesn’t continuously extend from meso range to macro 

range 

      

The average pore size ‘   ’ can be then determined by [55]: 

 

    
    

 
         (equation 11) 

Were ‘  ’ is the total volume of pores and ‘ ’ is the pore cumulative surface area. 

 

C. Scanning electron microscopy – SEM 

 

The scanning electron microscopy is an observation technique that with its high spatial and 

focus depth, nanometre range resolution and a heavy magnification capacity enables the 

observation the morphology and topography of a material’s surface [50, 49]. 

The basic work principle lies in the bombardment of a materials surface with an electron 

beam from which results the emission of electrons or photons from the surface that after 

being detected and conveniently treated give life to the surface image topography [50]. 

Samples for SEM can have any form but the sample setup should have the minimum 

operation to preserve surface characteristics. Normally a conductive thin coat is sputtered 

on the materials surface to ensure conductivity. Thicker coatings may lead to undesired 

artefacts crystallization or rupture and distortion of the original surface [49]. 

From the many interactions of the materials surface and the electron beam, the decay of 

excited electrons from high energy levels with liberation of characteristic X-rays may 

occur. If the intensity of this X-ray is detected and plotted against the energy it is possible 

to identify the element that is the origin of the X-ray, as each element releases its own 

specific X-ray that carries a specific energy. This is the basics of energy dispersive

spectroscopy (EDS) that is normally coupled with SEM systems and allows the analysis of 

elements in a material [49]. 

 

D. Differential scanning calorimetry - DSC 

 

The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is used for the determination of the thermal 

events (exo/endothermic) that occur on materials when heated or cooled. These events may 

be phase transformations, glass transitions, crystallizations or melting and the method is 

based on the comparison of the material behaviour with that of a reference material which 

is not subjected to changes at those temperatures. Therefore in a typical polymer DSC 

curve it is possible to observe the endothermic changes (glass transition, melt and 

degradation) and the exothermic reactions (crystallization and oxidation) [49]. 

 

E. Attenuated total reflectance Fourrier transform infrared spectroscopy: ATR-

FTIR 

 

Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) is a spectroscopic method used to gain information 

about the chemical bonding in a material, and so it is very useful to study a chemical bond 

of interest rather than being a generic probe. This technique studies the changes of 

intensity of an IR beam as a function of its wavelength (200 to 4000 cm
-1

) when it interacts 

with the sample, and each intensity peak can be related to a specific known chemical bond. 

If a sample is opaque the use of attenuated total reflection (ATR) crystal may be employed, 

and thus exploit the reflection of the beam as it propagates throughout the sample and 

crystal enhancing the signal [50].

F. Bioactivity assay 

 

It is generally accepted that the formation of bonelike apatite on the surface of a material is 

a requirement to improve the bone bonding capability of the material, as long as it does not 

induce cytotoxicity to the cells. Kokubo et al [47] found that this in vivo behaviour can be 

reproduced and predicted in vitro with simulated body fluid (SBF) with ion concentration 

near to that of human blood plasma (HBP). The SBF assay is relatively accurate in 

defining the bioactivity (bone bonding capability) of a material. In some cases no apatite 

materials can bond to human bone and in others apatite materials do not do so. The reason 

this occurs is manly related to antibody foreign reaction that prevents the bonding [47]. 

Because the original SBF solution (table 8) did not contain the correct amount of SO4
2+

, a 

modified SBF solution was proposed to obviate this problem. The modified SBF Cl
-
 and 

HCO3
-
 ion content differ from those in HBP, the stability and reproducibility of the results 

is no different from the new formulations that more accurately reproduce HBP. It should 

be mentioned that modified SBF it’s easier to prepare that the new formulations [47].

G. Resazurin cell viability assay 

 

The resazurin cell viability assay is a rapid quantitative method to determine the growth 

state of living cells. It is a reversible nontoxic method that lies on the conversion of the 

non-fluorescent dye resazurin (7-hydroxy-3H-phenoxazin-3-one-10-oxide) to the highly 

fluorescent resorufin (7-hydroxyphenoxazin-3-one). This change occurs as a response due 

to cell growth. The medium maintains a reduced state when cells are growing and an

oxidized one if growth is inhibited, so the redox indicator changes from the oxidized 

purple colour resazurin to the reduced state pink resorufin when the environment is 

reduced by cell growth. The colorimetric signal is proportional to the number of living 

cells in the sample. It should be noted that resorufin can be converted in hydroresorufin, 

which is colourless and non-fluorescent, and that causes the signal to decrease even with 

cell growth. Final resazurin value ‘   ’ is determined as the ratio of the absorbance 

detected at 570 nm ‘OD570’ and the intensity at 600 nm ‘OD600’ minus 1 [48, 56].

3. Results and discussion 

3.1. Zinc oxide particles 

A. Crystal phase composition, shape and particle size 

 

The XRD patterns of all the particles synthesized by chemical precipitation method (pZnO, 

rZnO, mZnO) as well as that of the commercial ZnO powder (cZnO) confirm that a single 

Wurtzite hexagonal phase (JPCDS 00-036-1451) is obtained (figure 13). 

 

Figure 13. XRD patterns of the commercial (cZnO) and precipitated ZnO particles (pZnO, 

mZnO and rZnO). 

 

The cZnO powder appears to have higher crystallinity than the precipitated powders, 

probably reflecting a high temperature processing. The rZnO shows incipient 

crystallisation, as its peaks intensity is lower than those of the remaining powders. pZnO 

and mZnO developed a well-defined crystal structure reflected by their sharp and intense 

XRD peaks.

The average crystallite sizes of cZnO, pZnO and mZnO powders, determined by Debye-

Scherrer equation, were 67, 46 and 56 nm respectively. It was not possible to determine 

accurately the crystallite size of rZnO powder due to its poorly defined XRD pattern. 

The purity of all the ZnO powders was further confirmed by EDS spectra (figure 14) which 

revealed that the elements present in the samples are uniquely Zinc and Oxygen. The 

detected aluminium and carbon are attributed to the used aluminium sample holder and 

deposited carbon on the samples for SEM observation, respectively, indicating absence of 

powder contamination. 

 

Figure 14. EDS analysis of ZnO particles (cZnO, pZnO, mZnO and rZnO). 

SEM observation of the commercial powders (figure 15) reveals a mixture of large 

aggregates of merged ZnO nanosized spherical, platelet and nanosized particles. This 

powder appears to be extremely uneven regarding particle size, size distribution and 

morphology. This feature probably reflects its industrial processing mode that is based on 

high temperature treatments of either Zn metal or ore. The high cristalinity and crystalite 

size of the powder previously commented are in line with this reasoning.

The electronic images of pZnO (figure 16 A and B) and mZnO (figure 16 C and D) 

powders reveal complex structures which appear as spherical assemblages of nanometric 

sized platelets or fine dendrites with an average thickness of about 50 nm.  Regarding rZnO

particles (figure 17), they present themselves with morphology rather different as 

compared to the other powder particles: rZnO particles are nanometric sized spheres with 

an average diameter of about 100 nm. The average crystallite sizes stated above are in 

according to the corresponding SEM images, as the thicker structures have a larger 

crystallite size. 

      

Figure 17. A) and B): SEM images of precipitated rZnO powder particles at different 

magnifications. 

The morphology differences exhibited by the precipitated particles reflect the differences 

among their synthesis conditions.  In the case of rZnO particles, the used ethanol was 

added to Zn
2+ 

solution prior to the start of precipitation. Ethanol thus could act not only as 

surfactant but also as a modifier of the precipitation medium chemical composition. It is 

here suggested that ethanol might have decrease ZnO solubility in the ethanolic 

precipitation medium thus contributing to enhance supersaturation and thereby favour the 

ZnO nucleation rate. Favouring the nucleation rate, ethanol would contribute to the genesis 

of a large number of nuclei which would grow to a less extent as compared to the smaller 

number of nuclei formed in the other different conditions which would be allowed to grow 

more. In the case of mZnO powders which also grow in etaholic medium, nucleation was 

differently affected by ethanol as ethanol was added during precipitation, thus implying a 

low concentration of ethanol at the early stage of nucleation. 

These results thus suggest that ethanol concentration in the precipiating medium is a 

critical condition impacting strongly the nucleation rate of ZnO particles. Similar effects

on ZnO nucleation were already reported for etanolic medium where nanometric sized 

ZnO particles were precipitated [57]. 

   

B. Porosity and specific surface area 

 

The isotherm adsorption/desorption branches and the corresponding pore size distributions 

(insets) respecting  cZnO, pZnO, mZnO and rZnO are represented in figure 18, 19, 20 and 

21 respectively. 

cZnO isotherm (figure 18) is very close to a IUPAC type II isotherm [52] which is a 

characteristic isotherm of non-porous or macroporous materials. Although a pore size 

distribution has been determined with an average pore size of 7 nm (table 9), the pore 

volume is rather small as compared to pore volume of the remaining powders and thus the 

mesopores exist in a small amount. Micropores were not found in this material. On the 

other hand pZnO, mZnO and rZnO powders present type IV isotherms [52] (figures 19, 20 

and 21 respectively) which are characteristic of mesoporous materials displaying mesopore 

capillary condensation. Furthermore both pZnO and mZnO present type H3 hysteresis loop 

branches which are indicative of a platelet aggregates with slit like pores [52]. This 

indication is in line with the powders morphology revealed by SEM, particularly in the 

case of mZnO which exhibits slit like pores between its nanometric sized platelets. The 

average pore sizes of pZnO and mZnO were determined as 14 and 12 nm respectively 

(table 9). Concerning rZnO nanopowder, it exhibits an H4 type hysteresis loop [52] which 

is normally associated to very small slit like pores; in this case the average pore size was 

determined as 7 nm, which is indeed a lower value than the previous ones. It is necessary 

to keep in mind that the BJH procedure of pore size and the pore size distribution 

calculation may underestimate the pore size as it assumes that all pores are cylindrical in 

shape.

The specific surface areas (SSA) (table 9) determined according to BET equation were 15, 

29, 45 and 21 m
2
/g for cZnO, pZnO, rZnO and mZnO respectively. As expected the rZnO 

exhibited the highest surface area because of its nanometric particle size and of its 

mesopore walls contribution. Contrarily cZnO being a very aggregated and almost pore 

devoid powder, it exhibits the lowest surface area. The surface areas of pZnO and mZnO 

are in a range between cZnO and rZnO values. The pZnO and mZnO powders have similar 

morphology and very similar SSA values as well. The main difference between these two 

powders is due to the thicker plate of mZnO which originate a more clustered and dense 

nanoflower like structure as compared to pZnO. The more open structure of pZnO also 

explains its larger pore volume as determined by BJH procedure. The precipitated ZnO 

particles have thus larger specific surface area and larger pore volume than the commercial 

ZnO nanoparticles.  

The cumulative surface area of the powders cZnO, pZnO, rZnO and mZnO, determined by 

BJH procedure, are respectively 17, 41, 62 and 31 m
2
/g (table 9). As these values are 

superior to the corresponding BET based values (15, 29, 45 and 21 m
2
/g, respectively), it is 

indicative of the existence of bottle shaped pores that favours small diameters, for a given 

volume of absorbed gas, thus  leading to an overestimation of the surface area [55]. 

Taking into account the BET surface areas and assuming the powders to be spherically 

shaped, the equivalent sphere diameter (ESD) was calculated as 71, 37, 24 and 51 nm for. 

cZnO, pZnO, rZnO and mZnO, respectively. This result means that despite their particle 

size exceeds 100nm which is considered to be the limit dimension for “nano” classification 

[8], their surface area is equivalent to that of a spherical particle under 71 nm, and as such 

their particle should be considered as a nanoparticle or nanostructured particle. 

Furthermore the fact that all the surface areas per unit of volume (m
2
/cm

3
) are 84, 161, 252 

and 118 m
2
/cm

3
 for cZnO, pZnO, rZnO and mZnO respectively, staying above 60 m

2
/cm

3
 

which is lower limit for “nano” classification [8], corroborates the adequateness of the 

“nano” label for the powders synthesized in the present work. 

The particles characteristics are summarized in table 9 and their relevance will be 

addressed in the coming sections.

As a final conclusion of the present sections it is worthy to emphasize that the 

manipulation of the chemical composition of the precipitating medium by ethanol addition 

allowed the control of the morphology, i.e. shape and size, of the final precipitate while 

maintaining its chemical composition and purity. 

 

3.2. Polyurethane characterization 

  

The importance of the characterization of one material is extremely important in the 

biomedical area. It is relevant to understand the material and its reaction with the human 

body as it could lead to a cascade of events with arising problems if the inserted material is 

not known. Therefor even if the material is FDA approved, such as tecoflex SG80A 

polyurethane, the evaluation of its structure and properties is still needed, as a way to 

predict and understand its behaviour in vitro and in vivo.

A. Attenuated total reflectance Fourrier transform infrared spectroscopy: 

ATR-FTIR 

 

Figure 22 presents the ATR - FTIR spectrum of the polyurethane used in the present work, 

Tecoflex SG80A polyurethane.  The identification of the various peaks and bands is 

presented in table 10 where some literature data are also presented for comparative 

purposes. The wavenumbers values are very close to those referred by C. Guignot, et al 

[58]. PU typical peaks were found at 3294 cm
-1

 (figure 22 - B) attributed  to H-bounded 

NH stretching, at 2916, 2845 and 2783 cm
-1

 (figure 22 – C, D and E respectively) assigned 

to C-H stretching from both polyether and cyclohexane (table 22 for details) and at 1716 

cm
-1

 ascribed to free C=O stretching (figure 22 - F). The peak corresponding to free N-H 

could not be identified (around 3445 cm
-1

 – table 10) in the present analysis thus indicating 

that practically all the NH groups are bonded and actively reinforcing the bulk. The peaks 

found at 1093 and 1035 cm
-1

 (figure 22 – N and Q) are attributed to C-O-C stretching of 

the polyether and the urethane components respectively, confirming that this is indeed a 

polyether-urethane polymer. Other peaks identification, available in table 10, further 

corroborates this evidence [46, 58, 59].

B. Differential scan calorimetry: DSC 

 

The differential calorimetric assay underwent by Tecoflex SG80A in the temperature range 

of -60 ºC &amp;lt;T &amp;lt;200 ºC is described in figure 23 where a typical behaviour of a linear 

polyether-urethane polymer is displayed. On figure 23 the DSC curves of tecoflex SG80A 

are presented as run1, run2 and cast. The cast curve refers to the polyurethane film that was 

after solvent evaporation at 37 °C without any subsequent thermal treatment. Run1 refers 

to the same polymer but submitted to a drying step at 70 °C after casting in order to release 

the moieties that might have been present.Run2 refers to the same sample used in run1 

which further was subjected to the same assay as a way to clear undesired peaks and reveal 

more accurately the PU behaviour. Typically polyurethanes have at least one glass 

transition temperature originated by the soft segments mobility increase, one crystallization 

temperature associated to the hard segments ordering and a melt temperature at which the 

polymer is in a viscous state. The common features to all the samples are the glass

transition temperature Tg under 0 °C, given by the endothermic inflection point, the 

crystallization temperatures, revealed by the exothermic transformations above 60 °C and a 

melt temperature above 140 °C, given by the endothermic transformations. 

 

Figure 23. DSC curves of the biomedical grade PU tecoflex SG80A. Run 1 and 2 (curves 

blue and green, respectively) stand for PU dried at 70 °C to release adsorbed moeties being 
the second run carried out to reveal more acurate exo/endothermic behaviours location; the 

yellow curve respects the PU as casted, without any thermal treatment after solvent 

evaporation at 37 °C.   

 

Regarding the cast polymer some phenomena are evidenced along its DSC curve pathway. 

The first one, attributed to the softening of the soft segment, is identified at -15 °C (Tg) 

[37]; the second one appearing at 35 °C is probably due to the release of solvents. At 95 ºC 

and 112 °C the exothermal peaks are attributed to the crystallization temperatures reactions 

occur with the softening of the hard segments [37]. Both peaks may correspond to two 

different packings associated to hard chain segments with different lengths. The meltdown 

of the polymeric mass occurs at 170 °C. After drying the polymer at 70 °C (run1), the DSC 

curve changes as the glass transition temperature (Tg), the crystallization and melt 

temperatures are now detected at different values as compared to the cast sample. The peak

previously detected at 35 °C is now completely absent thus agreeing with the former 

assignment of such peak to solvents release or degasification. The increase of Tg to about -

4 °C may be viewed as a consequence of a better packing of the macromolecular soft 

segments enabled by the referred solvent degasification. As the solvents affected 

negatively the soft segment packing they were helping the hard segment packing. As this 

helpful contribution for packing consistency is lost, crystallization occurs sooner, at about 

66 and 84 °C, and meltdown occurs in a broader temperature range, from 137 °C to about 

190 °C. The second run of the same polymer denounces a more refined structure. Tg does 

not change too much as it appear at ~ -3 °C, indicating that the soft segments could not 

improve further their packing, but the effective changes in crystallization and melt 

temperatures (71, 82 and 140 °C respectively) point to a better packing of the hard 

segments [60]. 

 

3.3. Composites characterization 

 

A. Attenuated total reflectance Fourrier transform infrared spectroscopy: 

ATR-FTIR 

 

The ATR-FTIR spectra of ZnO composites with 2%wt and 50 %wt nanoparticles can be 

observed in figure 24 and 25 respectively. The 2%wt composites FTIR spectra show almost 

no difference relative to the pure PU spectra, indicating no new covalent bonding between 

PU and ZnO particles. It was reported elsewhere [61] that in polyurethanes membranes 

filled with nanosized ZnO there is a new peak at 1619 cm
-1

 with the attenuation of the 

1687 cm
-1

. In 2%wt composites a new peak at 1614 cm
-1

 was found confirming the binding 

of ZnO to the polymer but no attenuation was detected. Also the change in peak at 3294 

cm
-1

 due to H-bounded NH stretching indicates that ZnO particles may be bonded to it, 

thus acting in the reinforcement of the polymer matrix.  

The 50%wt composites were so heavily loaded with ZnO particles that the spectra were 

completely deformed when compared to pure PU. As the typical peaks of PU disappear,

the characteristic peaks of ZnO are found near the limit range of the equipment (between 

500 - 600 cm
-1

), and so they are not represented [62].

B. Differential scan calorimetry: DSC 

 

The effects of pZnO content on the PU matrix can be observed on figure 26. Two major 

changes occur, namely in the glass transition temperature and in the crystallization 

temperatures. With 2%wt ZnO particles the glass transition temperature diminishes from -3 

°C to -13 °C and crystallization temperatures increases from 71 and 82 °C to, respectively,  

77 and 93 °C. The presence of ZnO polar particles probably disrupts the packing of the 

non-polar soft segments of the PU and contributes to the higher packing of the polar hard 

segments. Considering the P2 composite structure as a whole, it seems that the addition of 

2%wt ZnO to PU facilitates the chains mobility when heating during the thermal treatment, 

which corresponds in the DSC curve to a decrease in the glass transition temperature, when 

compared with the unfilled PU [62]. As to the crystallization temperature, assuming that 

ZnO particles promote a denser packing of the rigid PU segments by linkage with urethane 

group [62], it is likely that a higher temperature should be required to rearrange the PU 

structure in the composite. The melting temperatures basically remain the same, at 140 °C.  

The PU loaded with 50%wt ZnO particles has suffered heavier changes, namely the 

appearance of two Tgs, at -20 °C and 15 °C. The Tg diminished to about -20 °C due to ZnO 

particles influence which also aided in the hard chains packing leading to a raise in 

crystallization temperatures to 81 and 98 °C. The new Tg at 15 °C (figure 26) appears 

because of particles agglomeration, as some zones of the polymeric mass becomes free of 

the interaction of ZnO particles and hard segments influence, the soft segments could 

organize themselves better reflected on the new Tg. With this ZnO content the melt 

temperature also doesn’t change.  

It should be stressed that in both composites ZnO particles appeared well connected with 

the PU, thus acting as reinforcing filler and both formulations remain stable at 

temperatures between 34 and 42 °C, the range of the human body temperatures.

C. In vitro tests 

 

C1. Bioactivity 

 

Bioactivity assays were performed on 2%wt ZnO composites (C2, P2, and R2) and 50%wt 

ZnO composites (C50, P50 and R50) - where C, P and R refer to the type of ZnO filler, 

respectively cZnO, pZnO and rZnO and on pure polyurethane. Tests were carried out for 

time periods up to 21 days. 

The pure polyurethane didn’t show any calcium-phosphor compounds precipitation at the 

surface even after 21 days of immersion (figure 27), and thus, as expected, it is concluded 

to be a non-bioactive material.

Figure 27. SEM images of polyurethane surface: A) after 1 day of immersion in SBF and 

B) after 21 day of immersion in SBF. 

 

The C2 composite after 1 day of SBF immersion appears to have a very thin layer of 

precipitate (figure 28A), but after 7 days no precipitate was found (figure 28B) and after 21 

days some agglomerates were found (figure 28C).  

The formed precipitates after day 1 correspond possibly to a transient precipitate which is 

thought to be mainly related to a Zinc compound as revealed by EDS analysis (figure 28D) 

although the phase could not be identified by XRD due to its low amount. The peak in 

EDS analysis at 1 keV can be also attributed to sodium, Na, which is present in the SBF 

solution, and thus the possibility of sodium compounds being formed is not ruled out. The 

ICP analysis showed that some Zn
2+

 ions were released to SBF media (figure 31) from the 

very beginning confirming the idea of a Zinc precipitate being formed whereas phosphate 

and calcium SBF solution depletion were negligible even after 21 days of immersion 

(figures 30 and 29, respectively). It is thus concluded that the formed precipitated is mainly 

a Zn-based precipitate with a minor amount of a calcium phosphate being detected after 21 

days according to EDS analysis as ICP analysis appear to be less sensitive to the  Ca and P 

withdraw from SBF solution. It is reported that the Zn
2+

 released from bone cements 

enhances apatite phases formation [33, 34] and in some cases these are formed in 

polyurethanes in hydrophilic segment of polyetherurethanes, through calcium attraction to 

the oxygen ether bond [40].

In this way although the pure polyurethane films did not  show any precipitates formation, 

even after 21 days of SBF immersion (figure 27), with the aid of released Zn
2+

 ions the 

formation of precipitated phases could be enhanced.

Figure 31. Zn ion concentration of the SBF solution after immersion of C2 composites

The P2 composites behaviour followed basically the same pattern of C2 composites, 

showing some spots of precipitated phases at the end of 1, 7 and 21 days (figure 32: A, B, 

C respectively) accompanied by the release of  Zn
2+

 ions from the composite films to the 

liquid media (figure 35). The EDS analysis (figure 32D) confirms that the elements present 

are P, Zn and Ca. The P2 behaviour is further confirmed by ICP analysis (figures 33 and 

34), with small amounts of Ca and P being lost by the SBF solution and a simultaneous 

Zn
2+ 

enrichment. These results further confirm the possibility of phosphorus, zinc and 

calcium compounds being formed during the SBF assay.

R2 composites followed the same trend of both C2 and P2 composites, as small amounts of 

precipitate were deposited during the 21 days of immersion (figure 36A, B, C and D).  The 

ICP analysis (figure 39) detected small amount of Zn
2+

 ions in the SBF solution released 

by the composite, with a minor loss of calcium and phosphorus (figures 37 and 38, 

respectively). Once again the phases formed are thought to be possibly phosphorus, 

calcium and zinc compounds.

Figure 39. Zn ion concentration of the SBF solution after immersion of R2 composites 

(dashed lines serve to guide the eyes). 

 

The C50 composites exhibit the behaviour shown in figure 40: A, B and C. The addition of 

50%wt of cZnO particles to PU did not change the behaviour of the PU as very small 

quantities of precipitate were deposited on the composites surface throughout the 21 days, 

which are believed to be phosphorus; calcium zinc compounds (figure 40 D). The low 

quantities of Zn
2+

 released (figure 43) to the SBF solution are probably due to the low 

surface area and high crystallinity of the powder; After 7 days of immersion the quantity 

diminishes and this can be possibly explained  by the incorporation of Zn ions in the 

precipitated phases. The aluminium detected in EDS belongs to the sample holder. It seems 

that the crystallization of the new phases is not enhanced when commercial ZnO powder 

having a low specific surface area and a high crystallinity is involved in the composite 

formulation.

The P50 composites show a different behaviour when compared to the other samples as 

larger quantities of precipitate were deposited on the surface of the films (figure 44A, B, 

C). The EDS (figure 44D) analysis confirms that the elements present are P, Ca and Zn and 

ICP spectroscopy (figure 45) reveals that almost all of the calcium consumption from the 

SBF solution took place during day 1.

ICP also reveals that both the calcium and phosphorus (figure 46) amounts consumed from 

the SBF solution were much larger than those observed for the composites analysed before 

(C2, P2, R2 and C50), as well as the Zn
2+

 ions released from the composite (figure 47). 

There are two main factors that have to be taken into account for explaining this behaviour: 

the specific surface area and the crystallinity of the powders. This powder has large 

specific surface area (SSA) and thus is more reactive than the one with lower surface area 

as cZnO, It seems that its lower crystallinity and high SSA enhance ZnO dissolution. P50 

composite results also indicate the possibility of Zn
2+

 ions being incorporated in the 

phosphorus and calcium compounds network. The effect of Zn
2+

 in calcium phosphates 

phase formation was addressed before, and the high released amount of Zn
2+ 

could 

promote further precipitation by saturating the solution with Zn
2+

 ions that could possibly 

lead to the formation of new Zn-based compounds. Contrarily to the powder referred 

before this powder seems to be bioactive.

R50 composites exhibit heavy amounts of precipitate (figure 48 A-E) layers formed from 

day 1 till the end of the bioactivity assay at 21 day, which makes this composite probably 

bioactive. SEM images correspond to days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 (Figure 48A, B, C, D, E

and Zn. The Zn
2+

 ions release is heavier that for the previous composites, and thus Zn
2+

 

incorporation on calcium phosphate compounds network was also the largest as observed 

in the ICP analysis of SBF (figures 49-51).  This powder, pZnO, was the one having the 

highest SSA and crystallinity as compared to the other powders, and thus supports the idea 

that high surface area and less crystallinity enhances Zn
2+

 ion release which in turn may 

favour new precipitate formation. Thus the diminishing of the Zn
2+

 ions from the solution 

is possibly due either to ionic adsorption by the precipitated calcium phosphate phases or 

to the formation of other Zn compounds. This effect was not obviously observed in the 

other composites because the layer formation was not a so evident and the Zn
2+

 release was 

not so intense.

In this case it is possible to identify the precipitated phases from XRD patterns (figure 52) 

as the deposited layers cover the whole surface of the samples. Most of the peaks are due 

to zinc oxide embedded on the polymer matrix and the peaks from A to N are associated to 

the new phases formed (table 12), and its incipient crystallization. The phases that were 

taken into consideration were calcium phosphate (CP), monetite (M), brushite (B), 

hydroxyapatite (HA) and zinc phosphate (ZP) (table 11).

Table 12. Possible fits of the new identified peaks in R50 samples XRD patterns to various 

crystalline phases after immersion in SBF during 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days. 

 

 

After 1 day of immersion the layer formed on the R50 sample is revealed on the XRD 

pattern by the peaks A and B. The peak A (2? = 28.62) can be attributed to calcium zinc 

phosphide, zinc phosphate and possibly brushite. The B peak (2? = 32.64) can possibly be 

attributed to several calcium phosphate compounds, namely hydroxyapatite or monetite. 

This evidence suggests that in early stages this composite leads to the formation of several 

phosphorus compounds that depend on the Zn
2+

 ions released to the medium that can 

enhance the formation of those phases. After 3 days of immersion the precipitated phases 

shift to more specific phases, as the C peak (2? = 31.18) can only be attributed to 

hydroxyapatite or possibly monetite. The D peak (2? = 59.58) can be attributed to several 

compounds, namely calcium phosphate, hydroxyapatite or zinc phosphate. After 7 days of 

immersion the sample shows the same pattern as that corresponding to 3 days of 

immersion as, the C peak corresponds to the E peak (2? = 31.72) and the D peak to the F

peak (2? =59.38). After 14 days of immersion the XRD patterns slightly change as four 

peaks can be identified instead of two. As the amount of Zn
2+

 ions released to the medium 

enhanced the formation of calcium phosphorus phases till the 10
th
 day of the assay; (figure 

51) at day 14 the Zn
2+

 ions concentration started decreasing in the medium probably due to 

further precipitation of a zinc phosphorus phase or to the incorporation of zinc ions in the 

network of the already formed phases which reflected on the appearance of new peaks due 

to new compounds formation. The possible formed phases are brushite (2? = 28.72), 

calcium phosphate (2? = 32.06, 56.56, 59.40), hydroxyapatite (2? = 32.06, 56.56, 59.40), 

monetite (2? = 32.06) or zinc phosphate (2? = 28.72, 56.56, 59.40). After 21 days of 

immersion the samples reflects the same behaviour as the one socked 14 days. These 

results show that a myriad of phosphorus compounds can be formed during the 21 days of 

immersion in SBF. It appears that initially both calcium phosphates and zinc phosphates 

are precipitated on the composites surface. As SBF media become enriched in Zn2+ ions 

more of these compounds are formed with consequent losses of phosphorus and calcium 

ions that give rise to the phosphorus calcium rich phases. The stabilization of calcium loss 

from the SBF solution further enhances the idea that at later times the phosphorus 

compounds formed are zinc rich as the Zn2+ ions are depleted from the SBF solution. The 

loss of ZnO phase is possible to be detected on the XRD patterns as ZnO peaks lose their 

intensity from day 1 to 21.

C2. Cell viability 

 

The results of the resazurin cell viability assay performed on 50 mg of nanopowders, 

polyurethane, 2%wt (C2, P2) and 50%wt composites (C50, P50, R1 and R2) can be 

observed on figure 53. 

  

 

Figure 53. Resazurin cell viability assay of MC3T3-preosteoblastic cell line on 50 mg of 

commercial nanopowder (cZnO) or precipitated nanoflowers (pZnO), pure polyurethane 

(PU), PU composites with 2%wt of either commercial or precipitated nanoflowers (C2, P2, 

respectively), 50%wt composites of commercial or precipitated nanoflowers (C50 and P50, 

respectively) and composites with 50%wt nanospheres before and after SBF assay (R1 and 

R2, respectively). 

 

When observing the behaviour of the materials alone, namely the PU and both powders, it 

can be seen two distinct behaviours, the rise of 15% in cell viability for the PU sample and 

a decrease of 20 and 25% for the nanopowders, commercial (cZnO) and nanoflowers 

(pZnO). The diminishing values shows that 50 mg of both these nanoparticles alone may 

induce cell death, probably due to the release of ROS species, Zn

 excess ions release and

mechanical action, but contrarily to the observed growth and osseointegration of MC3T3-

E1 osteoblasts on ZnO nanoflowers by J. K. Park, et al (2010) [35]. As the toxicity of the 

nanopowders is not 100%, the difference in results may be due to ZnO particles 

concentration, and at smaller quantities growth and proliferation may be observed due to 

Zn
2+

 ions feed to the media and particle agglomeration. The increase of cell viability shows 

the biocompatibility of the selected polymer, and what may be the cause of failure in some 

applications when cell proliferation is not desired. The result shows the possibility of use 

in the orthopaedic area as a bioactive material that can improve the bonding at the interface 

prosthesis/bone. The surprising fact is that both composites loaded with 2%wt nanoparticles 

have an increase in cell viability of 70 and 50%, cZnO and pZnO powders respectively, 

which shows an enhancement on capability of cell proliferation of the polymer alone. This 

was probably due to the release of Zn
2+

 ions and to the changes in the polymer surface 

caused by the ZnO particles. With 50% nanoparticles loading the decreases in cell viability 

are evident, with a decrease of about 22 and 30% (C50 and P50, respectively), very similar 

to the effect of the powders alone. This fact supports the idea that the Zn
2+ 

excess ion 

release diminishes the cell viability and that in the case of these composites cell viability is 

regulated by Zn
2+

 ions released to the media, and cytotoxicity is not majorly related to 

ROS liberation or mechanical action.  The trial tests on R1 and R2 composites shows 

interesting results, as both composites shows a decrease in cell viability. The R1 composite 

(50%wt rZnO) show a 60% decrease in cell viability, probably due to a large amount of 

Zn
2+ 

release, related to both nanoparticles heavy concentration, larger SSA and low 

crystallinity. The R2 composite (50%wt rZnO) shows a cell viability decrease of only 20% 

very similar to the composites (C50 and P50). The heavy release of Zn
2+

 ions occurred 

during the SBF assay, and the release of this composite probably is very low and similar to 

the C50 and P50 composites. Besides the Zn
2+

 effect, it cannot be taken outside the 

possibility of nanoparticles action or the calcium phosphate layer possible inconvenience 

to cell proliferation. In this case the fact that cell proliferation diminished with 50%wt of 

ZnO particles may be useful in applications were cell proliferation is a cause of failure, 

namely in mechanical devices or catheters or in cases were toxicology is needed, like 

cancer treatment.

4. Conclusions and future work 

 

4.1. Conclusions 

 

In the medical area novel biomaterials are needed to comply with the various demands and 

requisites of the many applications. Zinc oxide establishes itself as a polyvalent material 

that is suitable for many applications in the medical area, not only for its electrical 

properties (such as sensors or biomarker) but also for its antibacterial properties and 

cytotoxic effects. Engineered nanoparticles show to be highly promising in the biomedical 

area as a novel material, but as this type of particles are not fully known, accurate 

characterization and careful properties evaluation is needed. As the processing of such fine 

particles is extremely difficult and the size results often lye in a broad size range with poor 

particle shape control, suitable processing methods are needed. 

In this work we successfully obtained pure phase ZnO nanopowders by a chemical 

precipitation method. Through a careful manipulation of the precipitation conditions 

nanoflowers-like particles consisting of agglomerated 50 nm thick ZnO platelets and 100 

nm ZnO nanospheres were engineered. These powder particles when compared with 

commercial ZnO nanopowders exhibit higher SSA, narrower size range and distribution 

which make them suitable for uses in biomedical applications such as drug carriers. 

Although appearing suitable for drug transport these nanoparticles have a slight cytotoxic 

effect on MC3T3 cell line and the toxicity may be related to an excess Zn
2+

 ion release to 

the media.     

The bioactivity assay revealed interesting behaviours from the composites produced with 

the engineered ZnO nanoparticles. The used polymer, a medical grade thermedics SG80A 

polyurethane, did not exhibit bioactivity in SBF because after 21 days of immersion no 

calcium phosphate layer was formed. In spite of this the cell viability assay with MC3T3 

cell line showed that this polyurethane induces a small cell growth, thus confirming its 

biocompatibility. Problems of mechanical device failure in vivo may arise from its use in 

inert devices as heart valves or catheters induced either by cell adhesion or proliferation. 

Such problems may be solved by adding an adequate quantity of ZnO particles (50w%) to 



Compósitos PU/ZnO para aplicações biomédicas                             Universidade de Aveiro

the polymer that induces cell mortality. This cytotoxicity is thought to be due to the Zn
2+

 

ion release to the medium as most of the particles are entrapped in the polymer matrix. 

Moreover it closely correlates to the higher SSA of the nanospheres which have higher 

Zn
2+

 ion release capability. The 50%wt nanospheres loaded composite was surprisingly 

bioactive as inferred from its calcium phosphates compounds forming capability but was 

also the composite with the highest mortality rate. Although not tested, these particles may 

also help reducing biological films that form at the surface of medical devices thus helping 

to reduce infections and device failure. 

In the framework of the ZnO particles cytotoxicity which is being currently addressed for 

new cancer therapies, it was shown that depending on the ZnO load, some of the produced 

composites may carry such potential as is the case of the 50 w% composites. However, less 

loaded composites such as the ones with 2%wt ZnO showed the higher cell viability rate 

thus predicting its usefulness in aiding the bonding of prosthesis to the bone in spite of 

their negligible capability of inducing calcium phosphates compounds, it was thus 

observed that the cytotoxicity of the produced composites varies between the noncytotoxic 

(2%wt) and the cytotoxic (50%wt) loaded composites, being the highest toxicity associated 

to the highest SSA of ZnO particles.  

As a final conclusion it may be pointed out that engineered ZnO particles with different 

properties allowed producing PU/ZnO composites with the ability of eliciting distinct cell 

responses, i.e. enhanced cell viability or, contrarily, enhanced cell toxicity effects. 

Consequently, PU/ZnO composites may be designed for applications where bone growth is 

required or for applications where the aim is to block the growth and spread of cells, as in 

targeted cancer therapies.

4.2. Future work 

 

In this work two limits of ZnO loading in which cytotoxicity to MC3T3 pre-osteoblastic 

cell line lies were found, but further works are needed to carefully characterize both 

nanoparticles and composites. Accurate evaluation of particles properties should be 

extended to include Zeta potential, solubility, hydrophobic character, electronic related 

properties, reactivity and toxicity for enabling the identification of new applications for 

these particles, namely in areas like cancer treatment or nerve regeneration. 

Furthermore the study carried out in this project was focused on surface properties of 

films, and thus the bulk properties must be evaluated and balanced among composition, 

materials engineering and cells response.  

The clear identification of distinct toxicity limits induced by the developed composites 

pushes to the need of investigating in vitro behaviour of other compositions both in 

acellular and in the presence of different cell lines in order to establish a comprehensive 

panel of applications suggested by the specific responses obtained.
