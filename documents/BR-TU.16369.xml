This study aims to evaluate the role of surface treatments performed on plain carbon fiber posts, in relation to serrated
carbon fiber posts, in the retention of the composite core. Fifty carbon fiber posts received surface treatments in order
to verify their influence on the retention of the core material. An acrylic resin mold was developed in order to precisely
fit the post, leaving a machined space to accommodate a self-curing composite resin. After the surface treatment, a pri-
mer was applied on the coronal portion of all posts, which were then dried. They were fitted to the mold and received a
3 mm composite core. All specimens were thermocycled and then stored in distilled water for a week. Tension test was
performed at a speed of 0.5 mm/min until there was lack of adhesion or fracture of the core. The conclusions were:
a) the values of retention related to aluminum oxide spray (group A), depth cutter diamond burs (group C) and posts
with machined coronal portion (group D) were comparable to those of serrated posts (group E), although no statisti-
cally significant difference between these groups was found; b) the mean values of core retention in group B (medium
grit diamond burs) were statistically lower than those of other groups.

INTRODUCTION

Over the past few years, improvements in den-
tal materials have led to a decrease in the utiliza-
tion of metal, enhanced aesthetics and good me-
chanical properties. However, researches have
focused on restorative materials, with almost no
concern about post and core materials. Endo-
dontic treatment techniques have also been devel-
oped, with more predictable results. Conse-
quently, endodontically treated teeth have their
longevity increased. Despite all modern restorative
materials, there are still a lot of controversies
about the need for intraradicular retention and the
type of coronal reconstruction2,16,19,20,26,29. SOREN-
SEN; MARTINOFF28 (1984) stated that there is no
root reinforcement related to the placement of a
post; they have also pointed out the importance of
coronal reconstruction in endodontically treated

teeth located in the posterior region. VIRE31 (1991)
evaluated the possible causes of failure in 116
endodontically treated teeth, and concluded that
59.4% of them failed for prosthetic reasons, all re-
lated to the post.

Many authors agree that the placement of posts
is directly related to the need for a retention and
resistance form1,2,13,17,21. The retention and resis-
tance form depends directly on the amount of
sound tooth structure, tooth position, restorative
choice and occlusal relationship.

Although metal-free restorations are aimed at
in many recent studies, most posts used are still
metallic. Many investigations have been carried
out in order to find out about the possible effects of
corrosion products and also to comprehend the
behavior of various post materials inside the root
canal, especially their modulus of elasticity.

DURET et al.5 affirmed that the ideal restoration
for endodontically treated teeth should have a
shape identical to that of the root canal, the same
mechanical properties as dentin and effective ad-
hesion to the tooth. Carbon fiber posts were intro-
duced due to their better mechanical properties in
relation to metallic posts: their modulus of elastic-
ity is closer to that of dentin5 and they have ele-
vated resistance to fatigue7. Maybe these proper-
ties are responsible for the occurrence of more
retrievable fractures related to carbon fiber posts
when compared with pre-fabricated posts and cast
posts in other studies8,12,13,22,27,30. Metallic posts have
a modulus of elasticity that can be ten times grater
than that of dentin7, resulting in greater tension in
the root structure6,32. There is also a difference
when comparing cast posts with posts and cores:
according to YAMAN; THORSTEINSSON32 (1992),
cast posts cause greater tension in the apical por-
tion, whereas posts and cores, in the cervical re-
gion. Perhaps this fact can explain the greater
number of failures with posts and cores in
periodontally compromised teeth. Fatigue is a dis-
advantage in metallic posts when compared with
carbon-fiber posts; the high percentage of fibers
probably leds to incomplete fractures in these
posts13.

Metal-free restorations are an aim in current
dentistry, because of aesthetics and the absence of
corrosion products2,9,22,23,25. HORNBROOK; HAS-
TINGS10 (1995) pointed out that cast posts and
amalgam cores can be apparent through the root
surface, thus they indicate tooth-colored cores for
better aesthetic results. Regardless of the presence
of a luting agent, avoidance of different metal al-
loys for posts and crowns is recommended by
DEUTSCH et al.4 (1983). The chemical stability
presented by carbon fiber posts is advantageous
when compared with that of metallic posts9.

Posts should fit dentin apically; the high per-
centage of unidirectional carbon fibers (64%) en-
sures good resistance to fatigue8. According to
PURTON; LOVE23 (1996), the main advantages of
carbon fiber posts are: high resistance to fatigue,
resistance to corrosion and chemical compatibility
with Bis-GMA. FREEDMAN7 (1996) states that car-
bon fiber posts have less transmission of stress
when compared with titanium posts (about 63%)
and nickel-chromium posts (about 33%). ISIDOR
et al.12 (1996) applied intermittent load to teeth re-
stored in three ways: carbon fiber posts and resin
cement, Para-Posts and cast posts and zinc-phos-
phate cements; while 85% of the Para-Posts and

100% of the cast posts failed against tensile
strength, no carbon fiber post failed. Therefore,
carbon fiber posts seem to be a good alternative to
metallic posts and their presumed compatibility
with composite resins would avoid corrosion prod-
ucts. Some studies8,12,18,27 concluded that the appli-
cation of force caused less damage to the structure
of teeth restored with carbon fiber posts when
compared with those restored with metallic posts;
SIDOLI et al.27 (1997) affirmed that there were
more retrievable fractures with carbon fiber posts
than with other posts. KING; SETCHELL13 (1990)
pointed out the ease to remove them when endo-
dontic retreatment is necessary.

Some investigations12,24 affirmed that the main
problem with carbon fiber posts is the lack of ad-
hesion to the core material. In order to solve this
problem, manufacturers have introduced a ser-
rated version. This version gained retention to the
core while lost rigidity; this mechanical property of
the serrated version is now closer to that of metal-
lic posts but smaller than that of plain carbon fiber
posts15.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Fifty carbon fiber posts (C-Post, #3, BISCO,
USA) were divided into five groups. Four groups
contained plain posts that received modifications
in the coronal portion before the placement of the
core. Surface alterations were performed as fol-
lows: Group A - sandblasting; Group B - medium
grit diamond bur; Group C - diamond burs used to
determine the depth for laminate veneers (depth
cutter); Group D - change of the head form. The
last group (Group E) consisted of posts serrated by
the manufacturer.

In Group A, sandblasting (with 50 µm alumi-
num oxide) was carried out at a distance of 1 mm,
over a length of 3 mm, on the coronal portion.
Posts from Group B also had a length of 3 mm pre-
pared with a medium grit diamond bur (Diamond
Burs, number 315, Moyco, USA) in a direction par-
allel to their long axis; each bur was discarded af-
ter being used in one specimen. Group C received
the same preparation with a depth cutter (Dia-
mond Series, number S4, Moyco, USA); each bur
was discarded after a single use. Group D had their
head machined as shown in Figure 1.

All posts received a double coat of Primer B
(All-Bond, BISCO, USA) and were dried. A ma-
chined acrylic resin mold was developed and di-
vided in two halves, where a #3 C-Post fitted ex-
actly (Figure 2); at the coronal end, a 3 mm space

was created in order to receive a composite resin
core. A fine brush with a thin layer of solid Vaseline
lubricated the coronal end before the placement of
the core.

Then, a composite resin especially developed for
core build-up (Core-Flo, BISCO, USA) was mixed
as recommended by the manufacturer and then
inserted in the 3-millimeter space. The post was
then placed and both halves of the mold were
screwed and kept under pressure; according to
DURET et al.6 (1990) it is essential to push the
composite material with some pressure into the
microscopic retentions of the post, in order to link
it with the matrix of the carbon fiber post. The
composite resin that exceeded the capacity of the
mold was removed with a spatula before setting.
Any remaining excess of composite was trimmed
with abrasive paper discs (Mooreplastics, garnet
fine, Moore) placed in a handpiece mandrel.

The samples were thermocycled (600 cycles,
30 seconds, 5ºC and 55ºC) and then kept in dis-
tilled water for one week.

The specimens were submitted to tension test
in an Instron machine (model 4,301). A mandrel
was adapted to the Instron machine and a metallic
frame was developed in order to transmit the force
exactly in the long axis of the samples (Figure 3), at
a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. The test was
stopped when there was lack of adhesion or frac-
ture of the core.

RESULTS

The data were submitted to a test of analysis of
variance (ANOVA), with a confidence interval of
5%. There was statistical difference between the
groups at a level of 5%. The Tukey comparison test
demonstrated statistically significant difference
between Group B and the other groups. There was
no statistically significant difference related to the
retention of the core between Groups A, C, D
(treated plain posts) and E (serrated posts).
Graphic 1 presents the mean values for all experi-
mental conditions.

Regarding the type of failure, there was also a
visual difference between the groups: the samples
from Group B presented only dislodgment of the
core, which was a completely different result from
those of the other Groups. In 80% of the specimens
from Group A, there was dislodgment of the core
with partial or total fracture of the composite resin.
In Groups C, D and E there was core fracture in all
specimens (Figure 4).

DISCUSSION

As stated by LOVE; PURTON15(1996), plain car-
bon posts are mechanically superior to serrated
ones, because of their greater rigidity. In spite of
that, smaller adhesion to the core compromises
the retention and resistance form that retains the
crown. The results of this study concluded that the
macroscopic retention encountered in Groups C,

D and E is favorable to the retention of the core,
which corroborates the results of other
studies3,15,16,24. The surface treatments performed in
Groups C and D transformed plain carbon posts
into good clinical alternatives to serrated posts be-
cause of their mechanical properties. Comparing
the results obtained by LOVE; PURTON15 (1996)
with the results of this study, it is possible to ob-
serve that the same kind of failure that occurred in
Groups C, D and E was found, i.e., fracture of the
core in all samples, which reflects the tension in-
duced in the core material, depending on the
shape of the head. The alteration produced in
Group D is inconvenient for clinical purposes, but
it is important to suggest that the manufacturers
keep the posts plain in the root portion and alter
the coronal end for greater retention.

From the clinical standpoint, non-catastrophic
failures (100% in Group B and 20% in Group A) are
not only failures of the restoration – they may also
cause great damage to the tooth because of the
time interval between the failure and its detection,
allowing the development of microleakage and root
caries. The catastrophic failures in Groups C, D
and E11 are clinical failures of the restorations and
demand their immediate substitution.

The use of composite resins as core materials is
more popular nowadays because they are easy to
handle and can be immediately prepared2. How-
ever, many factors can contribute to the integrity
of the interface between the post and the core. The
possible effect of thermal stress in composite res-
ins is otherwise minimized because there is less
transmission of heat under a crown than it would
be expected in a direct composite restoration, but
further studies are necessary. CHANG; MILL-
STEIN3 (1993) considered posts and cores less reli-

able when compared with cast posts because of the
greater number of interfaces. DURET et al.6 (1990)
stated that the different moduli of elasticity of the
post material and the core material can affect the
bonding resistance. The chemical compatibility
between the composite resin of the core and the
epoxy matrix of carbon posts would lead to a better
interface; however, the heat treatment performed
during the fabrication of carbon posts can play an
important role in this adhesion, resulting in a
worse interface.

The mechanical tension between posts and
radicular dentin is also related to the type of core
material15,16,32. Tension is greater for cast posts
when compared with posts and composite cores,
according to YAMAN; THORSTEINSSON32 (1992).
Failures related to the use of composite resins as
core materials are mainly related to their low
modulus of elasticity29. KOVARIK et al.14 (1992)
pointed out that failures with composite resin
cores occur at the interface, stressing the impor-
tance of a good interface; a good quality interface
should be expected with chemical and mechanical
adhesion.

tention to the core, producing values comparable
to those of serrated posts, with no statistically sig-
nificant difference.

• The surface treatment recommended by the

manufacturer – with medium diamond burs
(Group B) – produced the least retention to the
core, which was statistically significant in relation
to the other Groups and contraindicated this alter-
ation for clinical purposes.

Foi avaliado o possível efeito de tratamentos superficiais em pinos de fibra de carbono lisos, quando comparados aos
pinos serrilhados, na retenção à resina composta empregada na confecção de núcleos de preenchimento. Foram
utilizados cinqüenta pinos de fibra de carbono, divididos em cinco grupos: os quatro primeiros grupos eram
constituídos por pinos do tipo liso, cujas superfícies foram tratadas, e o último grupo por dez pinos do tipo serrilhado.
Foram desenvolvidas matrizes de resina acrílica com um leito ajustado para conter o pino, com um alargamento na
porção coronária para posterior preenchimento com resina composta. Após o tratamento superficial, todos os pinos
receberam camadas de “primer”, foram secos e então ajustados à matriz de resina, colocando-se a resina composta
autopolimerizável na porção coronária para um núcleo de preenchimento de 3 mm. As amostras foram submetidas a
termociclagem e armazenadas em água destilada por uma semana. Os espécimes foram testados por meio de ensaios
mecânicos de tração, à velocidade de 0,5 mm/min, até o deslocamento do conjunto ou a fratura da resina do núcleo.
As conclusões foram as seguintes: a) o tratamento superficial nos grupos tratados por meio de jateamento (Grupo A),
pontas diamantadas marcadoras de profundidade para facetas laminadas (Grupo C) e alteração da morfologia da
extremidade coronária (Grupo D) conferiu aos pinos lisos valores de retenção comparáveis aos dos pinos serrilhados
(Grupo E) nos ensaios de tração, porém sem diferença estatisticamente significativa entre estes grupos; b) os pinos
tratados por meio de pontas diamantadas de granulação média (Grupo B) obtiveram valores de retenção menores que
os demais grupos.
