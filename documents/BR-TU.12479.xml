abstract: An optode based on thymol blue (TB), an acid-based indicator, has been constructed and 
evaluated as a detector in FIA system for CO 2 determination. The dye was chemically immobili-
sed on the surface of a bifurcated glass optical fibre bundle, using silanisation in organic media. 
In FIA system, hydrogen carbonate or carbonate samples are injected in a buffer carrier solution, 
and then are mixed with phosphoric acid solution to generate CO2, which diffuses through a PTFE 
membrane, in order to be collected in an acceptor carrier fluid, pumped towards to detection cell, 
in which the optode was adapted. The proposed system presents two linear response ranges, from  
1.0 x 10 -3 to 1.0 x 10 -2 mol l -1,  and from 2.0 x 10 -2 to 0.10 mol l -1. The sampling frequency was 
11 sample h -1, with good repeatability (R.S.D &amp;lt;4 %, n = 10). In flow conditions the optode 
lifetime was 170 h. The system was applied in the analysis of commercial mineral water and 
the results obtained in the hydrogen carbonate determination did not differ significantly from 
those obtained by potentiometry, at a confidence level of 95 %.

Keywords: CO2, FIA, thymol blue, silanisation, pH-optode.

1 - introduCtion

Quantification of carbon dioxide is an im-
portant parameter in areas such as medicine, envi-
ronmental and industrial process [1,2], principally 
due to its important role in animal and plants meta-
bolism and in the process of photosynthesis. Thus, 
measurement in vivo or in real time of blood PCO2  
in intensive care units is considering an essential 
parameter in monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment 
of critically ill patients subject to surgery [1,2]. 
In the atmosphere the CO2 presence is the result 
of plant respiration  (production) and photosyn-
thesis (consumption). However, human activities, 
such as heading systems, transportation, industrial 

combustion, etc., and natural phenomenas, such 
as burning and degradation of biomass or volca-
nic eruptions, are responsible for much higher le-
vels of this gas in some regions [3]. In this sense, 
CO2 analysis is considered an essential element of 
environmental research [2]. CO2 determination is 
also vital in many biochemical industries, where 
it serves for the process control. The continuous 
analysis of the fermentation process on line is cri-
tical for high product yields, minimal unwanted 
metabolic by products and an overall optimised 
control strategy [2].

With the aim of CO2 determination, nume-
rous analytical procedures are known in gases and 
fluids. Determination of CO2 can be accomplished

by spectrophotometry based on pH-indicator sys-
tems [4], turbidimetric method [5] and infrared 
(IR) spectrometry [6,7]. Generally, these metho-
dologies are fast and produces reliably quantita-
tive results. However, they are expensive, bulky 
and not very much robust. 

 It is enough notorious than in all 
process for determination of CO2, measurements 
in continuous form will be very convenient. In this 
aspect, flow systems become powerful tools; prin-
cipally due to they are simple, reliable and allow a 
high sample throughput. For the other hand, che-
mical sensors are excellent devices for coupled in 
flow systems. 

 Between, the chemical sensors, 
that based on optical fibres, are usually sensiti-
ve, robust, cheap and easily miniaturised [8], also 
the optical sensors offer the possibility of remote, 
continuous, multianalyte analysis in low volume 
locations [2]. Thus, for the CO2 determination 
numerous optodes have been developed. Since 
those reported by Zhujun and Seitz [9] and Optiz 
and Lübbers [10] in 1984, based on Severinghaus 
electrode [11]. In these optodes [12-19], the CO2 
molecules diffuse through a hydrophobic membra-
ne, which separates the sodium bicarbonate buffer 
internal solution from the sample, the carbon dio-
xide is converted to HCO3

- in the internal solution, 
changing its pH, which one is followed by using 
colorimetric or fluorescent pH indicators. Howe-
ver, the greater problems in these optodes are the 
internal solution use to detect the pH variations, 
and the type of membrane used to separate the in-
ternal and the analysed solutions. Consequently, 
these CO2 optodes present limited lifetime and 
long response times [17] difficult their coupling 
in flow systems. 

Due to the drawbacks presented by the op-
todes based on Severinghaus principle, gradual 
configurations have been proposed in order to ob-
tain optodes with response times suitable for use 
in flow systems, and also to avoid the use of the 
internal bicarbonate solution.

In the ion-pairing method [6,7,20-24], ion-
pair between a pH indicator and a phase transfer 
such as tetraoctylammonium hydroxide is entrap-
ment in a layer of hydrophobic material such as si-
licone, permeable to CO2 but not for H

+ [25]. The-
se optodes show extremely fast response times, 

when applied in gas phase measurements, but in 
liquid phase the sensor should be covered with a 
permeable membrane for the continuous and pro-
longed use [2].

Other configurations including the 
development of films sensors for CO2  
[26-29]; coupled the fibre optic in flow cell contai-
ning the indicator in solution [30] and copolyme-
rised the dye in polymeric matrices [31]; or still 
immobilising polysiloxane directly on the glass 
optical fibre [32]. 

Previously, we report [33,34] optodes for 
pH measurements, constructed immobilised che-
mically acid–base indicators in a bifurcated boro-
silicate optical fibre bundle using the silanisation 
procedure in organic media. These optodes were 
evaluated in several flow systems showed respon-
se times and lifetime satisfactory for its use in 
these systems [33], and evaluated in the indirect 
determination of oxalate in food samples, which 
the CO2 generated by the enzymatic reaction be-
tween oxalic acid and oxalate oxidase [34], was 
satisfactorily monitored.

Despite of the numerous optodes reported 
in literature, still exist the necessity to developed 
new experimental procedures for CO2 determina-
tion. In this sense, this work describe the results 
obtained in the evaluation of the performance of a 
pH optode based on thymol blue (TB) acid-based 
dye, chemically immobilised on the glass optical 
fibre through silanisation, in the indirect determi-
nation of CO2, as an alternative to the other exis-
ting methods.

2.1 - reagents and Solutions

All chemical reagents were of analytical 
grade. Buffer solutions were prepared using dis-
tilled water and the actual pH of the solutions was 
determined by employing a pH electrode connec-
ted to a pH-meter (Micronal B374).

For the construction of the pH optode, nitric 
acid (Merk), ethanol (Nuclear), o-Xylene (Mallin-
ckrodt), 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (Aldrich) 
and thymol blue (Synth), were used. o-Xylene 
was previously dried overnight with anhydrous 
Na2SO4 before using in the silanisation.

2.2 - Construction of tb optode

The optode was constructed as previous-
ly described [33,34], by employing a bifurcated 
borosilicate optical fibre bundle (5 mm diameter), 
made with fibres of 70 µm i.d. The surface of the 
common end of the optical fibre bundle was ini-
tially treated with ethanol, nitric acid and ethanol, 
and allowed to dry at room temperature. Then, 
the silanisation was carried out by introducing 
the common end of the bundle into a 5.0 % (v/v) 
3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane in o-xylene. After 
this step, the silanised common end was rinsed 
with o-xylene, in order to eliminate any excess 
of silane, then with ethanol, to clean off the sol-
vent, and allowed to dry at room temperature. The 
immobilisation of the dye was done by introdu-
cing the common end of the bundle into a 0.04 
% (w/v) TB solution, containing 8.6 x 10-4 mol l-1 
NaOH, and rinsed with deionised water. After all 
this steps the tip of the optical fibers showed an 
intense purple colour, indicating that the immobi-
lisation was successful. 

2.3 - instrumentation

The instrumentation employed in this work 
consisted of a radiometric source (Oriel 6883), 
with a quartz-halogen lamp (12 V, 100 W), whose 
radiation was modulated at 200 ± 2 Hz by means of 
an optical chopper (Oriel 75152) and focused onto 
one arm of the optical fibre bundle. The modula-
ted light source was guided to the common end of 
the optical fibre, where the TB was immobilised. 
The reflected radiation was focused onto the en-
trance slit of a monochromator (Oriel 77250) and 
detected by a photomultiplier tube (Oriel 77340), 
connected to a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Resear-

ch System SR 510), provided with a pre-amplifier 
(Stanford Reasearch System SR 552). The lock-in 
amplifier was synchronised to the frequency of the 
optical chopper. A PC-AT 486 microcomputer was 
employed to control the monochromator and the 
lock-in amplifier, through an electronic interface 
(ADLink ACL-811). Software was written in Mi-
crosoft VisualBasic 3.0 to perform these tasks.

2.4 - flow manifold and procedure

The flow manifold was assembled as sho-
wn in Figure 1. Was employing a peristaltic pump 
(Ismatec? IPC8), furnished with tygon tubes to 
propel the solutions. In the FIA system, hydrogen 
carbonate or carbonate samples were injected into 
a 0.1 mol l-1 phosphate buffer at pH 7.6 stream 
(PBS), using a sliding central bar sampling val-
ve  [35], and then were mixed with a phosphoric 
acid solution, in order to generate CO2. The CO2 
diffused through a PTFE (Black Swam MFG. Co.) 
membrane placed in the gas diffusion cell “2” 
[36], and was collected by an adequate acceptor 
fluid, which was continuously pumped towards to 
detection system “D”, that include the TB opto-
de. The change of the pH in the acceptor fluid, 
causes a colour change of the TB immobilised on 
the optical fibre bundle, generating a variation in 
the reflectance intensity, which was proportional 
to sample concentration.

2.5 determination of hydrogen carbonate in mineral water samples 

Six commercial mineral water samples collected in the Campinas city (São Paulo – Brazil) 

were analysed, in which the total concentration of hydrogen carbonate was determined. Each 

sample was injected directly into the FIA system, and the reflectance intensity variation was 

monitored. The concentration of hydrogen carbonate in the sample was determined by interpolation, 

employing the analytical curve obtained with NaHCO3 standards solutions. These results were 

compared with those obtained by potentiometric titration [37], using a pH-meter (Micronal B374) 

equipped with a glass electrode. The hydrogen carbonate titration in the samples was carried out 

used a 0.0100 mol l-1 HCl standard solution.

Thymol blue (TB) was chosen due to its aqueous solution presents two pH regions of colour 

change (from 1.2 to 2.8 and from 8.0 to 9.6). On the other hand, studies carried out by Gonçalves et 

al. [4] have demonstrated the efficiency of the TB dye in aqueous solution for CO2 determination, 

using FIA system and spectrophotometric detection. When TB was immobilised in a optical fibre 

bundle, the pH optode presented two linear response ranges, allowing to detect pH changes from 4.0

3.1 - Characteristics of the thymol blue optode

Thymol blue (TB) was chosen due to its 
aqueous solution presents two pH regions of co-
lour change (from 1.2 to 2.8 and from 8.0 to 9.6). 
On the other hand, studies carried out by Gonçal-
ves et al. [4] have demonstrated the efficiency of 
the TB dye in aqueous solution for CO2 determi-
nation, using FIA system and spectrophotometric 
detection. When TB was immobilised in a optical 
fibre bundle, the pH optode presented two linear 
response ranges, allowing to detect pH changes 
from 4.0 to 11.0 as showed in Figure 2. It is a 
good result, because generally, optodes based on 
acid-base dyes presented a response range of two 
pH units or pKa ± 1. This peculiar profile of the 
TB optode can be probably explained considering 
the TB dye characteristics, which presents two-pH 
range of colour change in aqueous solutions. The 
extended ranges can be attributed to the chemi-
cal immobilisation of the colorimetric reagent on 
different sites of the optical fibre bundle surface, 
as explained previously [33], where the indicators 
molecules can be either strongly or weakly bon-

3.2 - optimisation of the fia system

In the determination of the CO2 with the proposed FIA system, parameters such as composition, 
pH and concentration of the acceptor fluid (AF) have important effects on the sensitivity and linear 
response range of the method. Thus, was carry out a study on different acceptor fluids. Solutions of 
different compositions were employed with pH values in the range from 4.0 to 11.0, considering the 
color changes of the TB optode. The results obtained with acceptor solutions with pH lower than 5.0 
were not reproducible, due to the formation of small bubbles of CO2. For 1.0 x 10

-3 mol l-1 phosphate 
buffer solution (pH 7.5) provided the best results for CO2 determination in the FIA system, were ob-
tained (Table 1). On the other hand, in basic solutions (pH &gt; 9) a little leaching of the TB immobilised 
was observed.

The effect of the acceptor fluid ionic strength on the FIA system performance was evaluated. 
This study was carried out because is known that optodes constructed using acid-base dyes are sensitive 
to variation of ionic strength leading to incorrect results [38]. In this study, the ionic strength of the 
acceptor fluid was adjusted in 0.01, 0.05 and 0.10 mol l-1 with NaCl. The analytical curves showed in 
Figure 3 indicate that the ionic strength adjusted to 0.01 mol l-1 provides the best results, mainly for the 
more diluted range.

samples in a carrier of 0.1 mol l-1 phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) with 0.1 mol l-1 NaCl and 1.0 x 10-3 mol l-1 EDTA. 
The acid solution was 0.50 mol l-1 H3PO4 and accepter fluid 1.0 x 10

-3 mol l-1 buffer solution (pH 7.5) with 
1.0 x 10-2 mol l-1 NaCl in a rate of 1.60 ml min-1.

At Figure 5 it can be observed two linear response ranges, the first from 0.001 to 0.010 mol l-1 and 
the second response range from 0.020 to 0.10 mol l-1, which presented the following linear regressions, 
respectively;

?Reflectance  = -0.103(± 0.017) + 109.597(± 2.007) [CO2] (r=0.9991, n=8)   (1)

?Reflectance  = 1.115(± 0.033) + 27.164(± 0.621) [CO2] (r=0.9982, n=9)   (2)

This peculiar profile of this FIA system can be probably explained considering the response pro-
file of TB optode as a function of pH (Figure 2). When hydrogen carbonate or carbonate samples, are 
injected the pH of the accepter fluid changes. These pH changes are detected by TB optode, which res-
ponds linearly until the concentration of the sample causes a pH change in the acceptor fluid of 6.6 (see 
Figure 2). In the proposed FIA system, the injection of samples with concentrations higher than 0.015 
mol l-1, causes a pH shift in the acceptor fluid for values smaller than 6.6 (Figure 2), corresponding to the 
straight line with minor inclination of Figure 5. For concentrations higher than 0.015 mol l-1, a straight 
line from 0.020 to 0.10 mol l-1 is obtained.

The repeatability of the FIA system was evaluated by ten successive injections of 5.0 x 10–2 mol 
l-1 sodium carbonate solutions, obtained a relative standard deviation value (R.S.D.) of 3.5%. This result 
indicates the good performance of the proposed FIA system.

The TB optode lifetime in flow conditions was c.a. of 17 days, which is in accordance with others 
optodes, previously reported [33,34].

The chemical immobilisation of TB dye on a borosilicate optical fibre bundle allowed the prepa-
ration of a pH optode, which presented response times sufficiently short and long lifetime to be used as a 
detector in a FIA system. The results show that this system is able to determine satisfactorily carbonate, 
with good repeatability and accuracy.

timol (TB) e sua aplicação como detector de um sistema para análise por injeção em fluxo (FIA) para 
determinação de CO2. O indicador foi quimicamente imobilizado na superfície de um feixe bifurcado 
de fibras ópticas de vidro, usando silanização em meio orgânico. No sistema FIA, amostras de carbo-
nato ou bicarbonato são injetadas em uma solução tampão carregadora, e a seguir são misturadas com 
solução de ácido fosfórico para gerar CO2, o qual se difunde através de uma membrana de PTFE, para 
ser coletado em um fluido carregador aceptor, o qual é bombeado em direção à cela de detecção, na qual 
encontra-se o optodo. O sistema proposto apresenta duas faixas lineares de resposta, entre 1,0 x 10-3 e 
1,0 x 10-2 mol l-1, e entre 2,0 x 10-2 e 0,10 mol l-1. A freqüência de amostragem foi de 11 amostras h-1, 
com boa repetibilidade (R.S.D &amp;lt;4 %, n = 10). Sob condições em fluxo o tempo de vida do optodo foi de 
170 h. O sistema proposto foi aplicado na análise de águas minerais comerciais, e os resultados obtidos
