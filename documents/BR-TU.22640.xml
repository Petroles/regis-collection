Resumo 
 
 

As remoções de manganês e de sulfato são importantes desafios no tratamento de águas 

de mina. O manganês é de difícil remoção devido a sua alta solubilidade em meio ácido 

ou neutro e pode ser encontrado em altas concentrações nessas águas, conforme a 

mineralogia das rochas. Por outro lado, a presença de íons sulfato é normalmente devida 

à oxidação de minerais sulfetados e também pode ser encontrado em concentrações 

elevadas nas drenagens de mina. Portanto, este trabalho investigou a remoção do 

manganês e do sulfato das águas neutras de mina, com experimentos em tanques 

agitados e em colunas de leito fixo. Para a remoção de manganês, este estudo envolveu 

a precipitação dos íons Mn (II) presentes em águas de mina com concentração de 

140 mg.L
-1

 e pH 6,5, aplicando misturas do carbonato de sódio e do calcário. Observou-

se que, além da concentração total do carbonato, o pH também influenciou na 

precipitação do carbonato de manganês. Uma remoção de 99,9% do manganês foi 

alcançada com íons carbonatos, para pH da solução acima de 8,5. Avaliou-se também a 

aplicação do calcário para adsorção do manganês nas águas de mina para baixa 

concentração do elemento (1,5 e 15,0 mg.L
-1

). Observou-se que o equilíbrio da adsorção 

pode ser descrito pelas equações de Freundlich ou de Langmuir, sendo o carregamento 

máximo alcançado de 0,91 mgMn.g
-1

 calcário em sistemas agitados. Os modelos de 

Thomas, de Yoon e Nelson e de Dose-resposta apresentaram uma boa correlação com 

os resultados obtidos em coluna de leito fixo. O modelo BDST conformou o baixo 

carregamento de manganês, ou seja 0,057 mgMn.mL
-1

 leito, para concentração de 

15,0 mgMn.L
-1

 e vazão de 1 mL.min
-1

. Nos experimentos de remoção do sulfato, em 

sistema contínuo a concentração deste íon foi reduzida de 588 para 87 mg.L
-1

, em 

210 minutos. Os experimentos de equilíbrio mostraram que o carregamento do sulfato 

no calcário pode ser descrito pela isoterma de Langmuir, com carregamento máximo de 

23,7 mgSO4 
2-

.g
-1

 de calcário. O processo de adsorção em leito fixo pode também ser 

descrito por modelos de Thomas, de Yoon e Nelson e de Dose-resposta. Nestes 

sistemas, para partículas de calcário na faixa granulométrica entre 0,42-0,59 mm, o 

carregamento foi de 20 mgSO4
2-

.L
-1

 leito. A espectrofotometria no infravermelho 

indicou a presença de íons sulfato e de carbonato do manganês na superfície do calcário. 

Observou-se que o calcário é efetivo na remoção do manganês somente para baixa 

concentração do metal (1,5 mg.L
-1

). Entretanto, pode ser utilizado como etapa de 

polimento para água neutra de mina contendo entre 250 e 1200 mg.L
-1

 de sulfato, onde 

a precipitação de gesso não é mais efetiva.

Abstract 

 
Both sulfate and manganese removals are important challenges in the treatment of mine 

waters. Manganese is difficult to remove due its high solubility in acid or neutral 

effluents. It can be found in high concentrations in mine waters, depending on the rock 

mineralogy. On the other hand, the presence of sulfate ions is normally due to the 

oxidation of sulfide minerals. Therefore, this work investigated the removal of 

manganese and sulfate from neutral mine waters, through experiments in agitated tanks 

and fixed-bed columns. The study addressed Mn(II) precipitation in mine waters 

containing 140 mg.L
-1

 Mn at pH 6.5, applying mixtures of sodium carbonate and 

limestone. It was observed that, in addition to the carbonate concentration, pH also 

influenced manganese precipitation as MnCO3. A removal of  99.9% Mn was reached 

with carbonate ions, provided the solution pH was above 8.5. In addition, the 

application of limestone as a sorbent for low concentration Mn waters (1.5 mg.L
-1

 and 

15.0 mg. L
-1

) was also assessed. It was observed that sorption can be described by either 

Freundlich or Langmuir equations with 0.91 mgMn.g
-1

 limestone as the maximum 

value. The models of Thomas, Yoon and Nelson and Dose-response were able to 

describe manganese sorption in fixed-bed columns. The BDST model confirmed the 

low manganese loading on limestone, as a maximum of  0.057 mgMn.mL-bed
-1

 was 

observed for a 15.0 mgMn.L
-1

 mine water, at a flow rate of 1 mL.min
-1

. In the 

experiments of sulfate removal, the concentration of this ion was reduced from 

588 mg.L
-1

 to 87 mg.L
-1

, in 210 minutes. Sulfate sorption on limestone was described 

by the Langmuir isotherm, with maximum loading of 23.7  mgSO4
2-

.g
-1

. The adsorption 

process was also modeled with the Thomas, Yoon and Nelson and Dose-response 

models, whereby sorption parameters were determined. With a limestone particle size 

between 0.42 and 0.59 mm, a bed loading of 20 mgSO4
2-

.L
-1

 was observed. Infrared 

spectrofotometry indicated the presence of sulfate ions and manganese  carbonate on the 

limestone surface. It was observed that the limestone is effective in the removal of 

manganese only at low metal concentration (1.5 mg.L
-1

). However, it can be applied in 

sulfate removal from neutral mine waters containing between 250 mg.L
-1

 and 

1200 mg.L
-1

, for which gypsum precipitation is not effective.  

 

 

Key-words: manganese, sulfate, limestone, adsorption, mine water, sorption models, 

sodium carbonate.

1.1 - Introdução  

A indústria minero-metalúrgica é uma grande consumidora de água, e em vários de seus 

diferentes processos esta é utilizada com especial destaque nas etapas de tratamento a úmido 

de minérios. Merecem destaque os processos de tratamento de minérios (moagem, 

espessamento, flotação, deslamagem, entre outros) e os que formam a chamada “Metalurgia 

Extrativa dos Metais Não-Ferrosos”, mais especificamente os Processos Hidrometalúrgicos, 

ou Hidrometalurgia. A Hidrometalurgia visa à produção de metais (ouro, prata, zinco, 

cobre, níquel, cobalto, entre outros) através de reações que se realizam em meio aquoso. Os 

impactos dessas atividades sobre os corpos de água são diversos, uma vez que se faz 

necessário devolver aos leitos dos rios e lagos a água utilizada nesses processos de 

produção. Porém, essa devolução não pode ser feita de qualquer maneira, já que existem 

contaminantes que podem provocar danos ao meio ambiente. Os efluentes líquidos 

industriais, por exemplo, precisam primeiro, ser tratados para retornar à natureza e, para 

isso, existem políticas e normas a serem seguidas, que estabelecem a quantidade de 

contaminantes que podem ser lançados no meio ambiente. 

 

 

Os principais contaminantes encontrados nos efluentes da indústria mineral são os cátions 

e ânions, como sulfato e cloreto, entre outros. As remoções do manganês e do sulfato são 

consideradas, atualmente, um dos principais desafios no tratamento de efluentes da 

indústria mineral no país.  O manganês não é facilmente removido pelo fato de sua química 

em solução ser mais complexa que a dos outros metais, tais como zinco, ferro, cromo e 



 2 

cobre, uma vez que sua precipitação não ocorre pelo simples ajuste do pH, a prática mais 

utilizada na indústria. Além disso, como ocorre associado ao ferro, é muito comum nas 

minerações, tanto de metais ferrosos quanto de não-ferrosos (Silva, 2007). A presença de 

elevados teores de íons sulfato em efluentes líquidos é devida ao uso do ácido sulfúrico, 

um reagente barato e estável, em diversos processos, como por exemplo: nas indústrias de 

produção de cobre e de níquel; nas linhas de galvanização de aços; na produção de ácido 

fosfórico; na remoção ácida de impurezas; entre outros (Rampinelli, 2007). Outra fonte de 

poluição por sulfato na indústria mínero metalúrgica é a formação da drenagem ácida de 

mina (DAM). A DAM é formada pela oxidação, catalisada por micro-organismos de 

sulfetos de ferro como pirita (FeS2) e pirrotita (Fe1-xS). O baixo valor de pH da DAM 

favorece a dissolução dos metais presentes na rocha e por isso diferentes íons metálicos 

podem ser encontrados em elevadas concentrações dependendo da mineralogia da rocha. 

Muitos desses íons são removidos durante o tratamento da DAM com substâncias 

alcalinas, pois o aumento do pH provoca a precipitação de vários metais, entretanto, 

elementos como, arsênio e manganês são de difícil remoção. Quando na rocha há a 

presença de minerais portadores de alcalinidade, a acidez da DAM é neutralizada, tendo-se 

a drenagem neutra de mina. Nesse caso, a concentração de metais dissolvidos é menor, 

mas ainda podem ser encontrados níveis elevados de sulfato e de manganês.  

 

 

Em termos de efeitos sobre a saúde humana, o manganês pode produzir irritação neuro 

muscular (WHO, 1981). O consumo de água contaminada com sulfato em níveis elevados 

deve ser evitado, principalmente por crianças e gestantes, pois ainda não são 

completamente conhecidos os riscos à saúde humana decorrentes do consumo de teores 

elevados de ânions. Estima-se que estes íons também possam estar correlacionados à 

ocorrência de problemas renais, além de diarréia, (WHO, 2004). Devido aos seus efeitos 



 3 

tóxicos, o descarte de efluentes líquidos é regulado pelo Conselho Nacional do Meio 

Ambiente - CONAMA, através de sua Resolução nº 357 art. 24, e pelo Conselho Estadual 

de Política Ambiental - COPAM / Conselho Estadual de Recursos Hídricos - CERH – MG, 

através de sua Deliberação Normativa Conjunta 001, que afirmam: “os efluentes de 

qualquer fonte poluidora somente poderão ser lançados, direta ou indiretamente, nos 

corpos de água, após o devido tratamento e desde que obedeçam às condições, padrões e 

exigências dispostos nesta (...) e em outras normas aplicáveis”. Segundo esses órgãos, o 

padrão de lançamento contendo manganês para efluentes é de 1,0 mg.L
-1

  e para águas de 

Classe 2 é de 0,1 mg L
-1

, e o padrão de lançamento de sulfato é de 250,0 mg. L
-1 

para águas 

de Classe 2. 

 

Segundo o International Network for Acid Prevention (2003), o tratamento de efluentes 

contendo altos teores de sulfato, geralmente, inclui a combinação das etapas de 

neutralização e precipitação com cal, osmose reversa, eletrodiálise, adsorção, troca iônica, 

entre outras. Entretanto, algumas dessas técnicas têm sido pouco utilizadas, por serem 

economicamente inviáveis ou ineficientes. A remoção de sulfato pode ser obtida por 

precipitação com a adição de hidróxido de cálcio (Ca(OH)2) ou carbonato de cálcio 

(CaCO3) (Garcia et. al., 2001). Entretanto, a concentração residual de sulfato, quando há 

precipitação de gesso, situa-se entre 1500 e 2000 mg.L
-1

, ou seja, muito acima do requerido 

pela legislação. Kothari (1988) e Laus et al. (2005) observaram que a remoção de 

manganês pode ser alcançada por meio de vários métodos e que o tipo de tratamento 

depende da água a ser tratada. Podem ser citados como exemplos de métodos para a 

remoção de manganês: a precipitação (Silva, 2007; Aziz et al., 2008), a troca iônica 

(Dayube e Trindade, 2004) e a adsorção (Babel e Kurniawan, 2003; Mohan e Chander, 

2006; Barakat, 2008; Lee et al., 2009; Emmanuel e Rao, 2009).  



 4 

Dentre os métodos de remoção de manganês e sulfato citados, a adsorção é uma das 

técnicas mais aplicadas no mundo. Viu-se na aplicação da técnica e na utilização do 

calcário uma opção para remoção do manganês e do sulfato, pois o calcário é um material 

amplamente disponível no país e pode ser uma alternativa viável para esse processo de 

remoção, ao se considerar a aplicabilidade técnica, a simplicidade do processo e o custo-

eficácia como sendo fatores chaves na escolha do tratamento mais adequado para efluentes 

inorgânicos (Sengupta, 1993; Silva, 2007; Barakat, 2008). Por outro lado, os efluentes das 

minerações brasileiras contêm teores de manganês maiores que os encontrados em outras 

águas de mina ao redor do mundo. Estes elevados teores não são facilmente removíveis 

apenas por adsorção, dessa forma, outras técnicas, como a precipitação, precisam ser 

avaliadas, sendo a precipitação com o íon carbonato solúvel uma das alternativas em 

potencial. A remoção dos metais presentes em um efluente industrial é feita, normalmente, 

pela elevação do valor do pH até que os metais tenham sua concentração em solução 

reduzida ao limite requerido pela legislação, entretanto, para os elementos cuja química em 

solução é mais complexa, como é o caso do manganês e o sulfato, essa alternativa não é 

efetiva. No processo de remoção de manganês, é preciso ter em conta a sua origem, a 

forma com que este elemento se encontra presente na água, a sua concentração, a 

quantidade de água a tratar e os aspectos econômicos (Dayube e Trindade, 2004).  

 

1.2 – Parâmetros e Processos  

 

Existem parâmetros importantes para a avaliação de qualquer sistema de remoção do 

manganês e do sulfato de efluentes industriais, como: concentração dos contaminantes, 

valor do pH inicial, tipo de agente precipitante ou adsorvente, tamanho de partícula do 

precipitante ou do adsorvente.

Nos resultados obtidos nos diferentes artigos, observa-se que a maioria dos autores utilizou 

solução de manganês com concentração baixa (&lt;10,0 mg.L

). Já nos artigos referentes à 

remoção de sulfato, usam como adsorvente resinas de troca iônica (Haghsheno et al. 2009), 

Ladeira e Gonçalves (2007), Feng et al. 2000)), zeólitas (Oliveira, 2006), goetita (Rietra et

O presente projeto caracteriza-se pelo desenvolvimento de um processo para a remoção de 

sulfato e de manganês, com alta concentração, de efluentes da indústria mineral; esse 

estudo justifica-se uma vez que a indústria mineral tem solicitado à comunidade científica 

o desenvolvimento de tecnologia para remoção de manganês e sulfato de seus efluentes, 

como uma etapa para a recirculação de água na indústria.   

 

 

Dessa forma, a presente tese de Doutorado, parte integrante do projeto CT-HIDRO 

040/2006, foi realizada com o intuito de estudar como o sulfato e o manganês são 

removidos com a utilização do calcário e/ou carbonatos solúveis. Como parte dos 

resultados desta tese, tem-se a publicação dos três artigos científicos submetidos a 

periódicos internacionais, apresentados nesta Tese. 

 

1. 3 – Atividades Desenvolvidas e Organização da Tese  

 

Com base nas considerações que foram apresentadas previamente, o presente trabalho teve 

como objetivo estudar a remoção de manganês e sulfato com solução sintética, e,

posteriormente, um efluente da indústria minero-metalúrgica. Trata-se de uma drenagem 

neutra de mina (pH 6,5) contendo elevados teores de manganês (até 140 mg.L
-1

) e 

moderados níveis de sulfato (600-1100 mg.L
-1

). Os objetivos específicos foram: 

 

? Realizar ensaios de remoção de manganês e sulfato, em sistema batelada e 

contínuo, em reatores de mistura perfeita e em coluna de leito fixo, com soluções 

sintéticas e efluentes da indústria minero-metalúrgica;

carbonato de sódio) na remoção do manganês, por precipitação. 

? Observar a influência do tempo de ensaio e a massa de calcário na remoção do 

sulfato; 

? Observar o carregamento de manganês e de sulfato em sistemas de adsorção em 

leito fixo; 

? Caracterizar os resíduos sólidos obtidos durante o processo de remoção em sistema 

batelada e contínuo, por meio das técnicas de Espectroscopia no Infravermelho (IR) 

e Microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV). 

 

A tese foi organizada em Capítulos, sendo que no Capítulo 2 será apresentado o artigo

Abstract 

 

This study addressed manganese removal from mine waters in stirred-tank as well as fixed 

bed experiments. Manganese sorption in limestone is a slow process, which can be 

described by pseudofirst order kinetics. Equilibrium sorption could be successfully 

modeled by the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms, and limestone showed a maximum 

manganese loading of 0.91 mg.g
-1

. Fixed-bed sorption was also studied, and limestone 

uptake was observed to increase with the flow rate at low manganese concentration 

(1.5 mg.L
-1

) but decreased for mine water containing 15 mgMn.L
-1

. The Bed Depth 

Service Time (BDST), Thomas, Yoon and Nelson, Wolborska and Dose response models 

were fitted to breakthrough curves to determine the characteristic design parameters of the 

column. With the exception of the Wolborska model, all studied equations could describe 

the sorption process well. The maximum uptake was 0.0033 mg.g
-1

 for a 15 mg.L
-1

 

manganese solution at 1 mL.min
-1

, and zeta potential determinations showed that the 

limestone surfaces were negatively charged. The solid residues obtained during the 

removal process were characterized using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning 

electron microscopy (SEM) to identify the reaction product. The presence of manganese 

carbonate (MnCO3) on the limestone surface was verified during the experiments with 

mine water.

2.1 - Introduction 

 

Water in the mining industry has been a source of concern because of its contamination by 

toxic metals and other substances that require treatment before discharge. Such treatments 

must be carried out using operations and processes that aim to reduce the contaminant 

concentration to levels required by environmental regulations or alternatively to those that 

enable water recycling in the production process. Manganese removal is one of the most 

difficult challenges for water management in the mining industry. The removal of this and 

other elements is one of the required steps for effective water recycling.  

 

Manganese is one of the most abundant toxic elements in both superficial and underground 

waters (Aziz and Smith, 1996; Franklin and Morse, 1983) as well as in the effluents and 

drainages of several mining companies. Its solubility in natural waters is influenced by 

such factors as redox potential, pH and the presence of complexing agents such as 

bicarbonate and sulfate (Hem and Lind, 1994). Nevertheless, manganese is usually present 

in mining effluents as Mn
2+

.  

 

Manganese removal from wastewaters can be carried out by different approaches (Kothari, 

1988; Laus et al., 2006). Mn
2+

 oxidation and precipitation as MnO2 followed by 

clarification is a common method. Oxidation can be performed by applying strong 

oxidizing agents such as potassium permanganate, hypochlorite or ozone (Silva et al., 

2010). Nevertheless, the presence of both ferrous iron and organic matter increases oxidant 

consumption such that iron removal is required prior to manganese oxidation. Manganese 

can also be removed by precipitation as manganese carbonate (MnCO3) in the presence of 

alkalinity (Hem and Lind, 1994) or bio-oxidized to Mn(III), precipitating as oxy-

hydroxides. 



 14 

Limestone is commonly used as a neutralizer for acid effluents and acid mine drainages 

(Sun et al., 2000). Limestone was studied as a reactive barrier for acidic waters (pH 2.2), 

and its efficiency was compared with that of red mud (Komnitsas et al., 2004). Limestone 

increased the solution pH to 8, which facilitated iron and aluminum removal, while 

manganese and zinc uptakes were not as effective because the solution pH decreased when 

reactivity was lost as a result of iron precipitation over the limestone surface. For neutral 

drainages, limestone can also be applied as an adsorbent for toxic metals. Aziz et al. (2008) 

studied the sorption of a series of metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Ni, Cr) on limestone in batch 

experiments where monovalent metal solutions (2 mg.L
-1

) were equilibrated with 

powdered limestone (2.36-4.77 mm) at pH 8.5. The sorption data were fitted to the 

Langmuir isotherm, and nickel showed the highest loading (38 mg.Kg
-1

 limestone) 

compared with the other metals. Similarly, experiments were performed for lead and 

cadmium sorption at neutral pH (5.0-7.0). Lead (40 mg.Kg
-1

) showed a higher affinity for 

limestone compared with cadmium (1 mg.Kg
-1

); this was attributed to a stronger 

interaction with the limestone surface due to a smaller hydrated ionic radius (Rangel-

Porras et al., 2010).      

 

Early studies on Mn
2+

 calcite interactions indicated strong sorption at low concentrations 

(below MnCO3 solubility) (Franklin and Morse, 1983). The lack of a sorption maximum 

was interpreted to be an indication that both precipitation as well as adsorption accounted 

for Mn
2+

 uptake by calcite. Zachara et al. (1991) suggested that manganese sorption on 

calcium carbonate occurs by either sorption, precipitation on the solid surface or formation 

of solid MeCO3(s)-CaCO3(s) solutions. Manganese carbonate or hydroxide formation was 

also proposed by Komnitsas et al. (2004) as well as Silva et al., 2010.   

 



 15 

Despite its widespread use as neutralizer for acidic effluents, the application of limestone 

in the treatment of neutral drainages and effluents is far less studied.  In addition, no 

comprehensive investigation has been undertaken regarding its utilization in fixed bed 

sorption of manganese, which is considered the most difficult toxic metal to remove from 

mine waters. Therefore, this work was undertaken to study the potential of applying 

limestone for manganese sorption in both stirred and fixed bed reactors.  

2.2 - Materials and methods  

 

2.2.1 - Calcite limestone and mine waters 

 

A limestone sample (2.68 ton/m
3
) assaying 40.3% calcium and 1.23% magnesium was 

kindly provided by Brazilian producers. Calcite was confirmed as the main mineral phase 

by XRD diffraction. The solid material was first dry sieved using Tyler sieves and the 

&lt;45 mm fraction was selected for dry grinding in a vibrating cup mill (Pulverisette 9, 

Fritsch). Its particle size distribution was assessed by laser diffraction (CILAS - 

Compagnie Industrielle Des Lasers 1064) and resulted in a d50 value of 8.6 µm.  Surface 

and micropore areas were determined as 1.54 m
2
.g

-1
 and 1.90 m

2
.g

-1
, respectively, by N2 

adsorption (Nova 1000, Quantachrome). This solid sample was utilized in experiments in a 

stirred reactor. Another limestone sample with a particle size between 590 µm and 850 µm 

(0.569 m
2
.g

-1
 specific surface area, 0.365 m

2
.g

-1
 micropore area) was tested in both 

equilibrium and fixed bed experiments.  

 

ICP-OES was applied to assess the composition of two different mine waters.  

 

 



 16 

2.2.2 - Stirred-tank experiments 

 

Preliminary manganese removal experiments were carried out batchwise with the low 

manganese mine water (1.5 mg.L
-1

). A volume of 0.12 L of mine water was transferred to 

erlenmeyer (0.25 L capacity) flasks and mixed with fine calcite limestone (d50= 8.6 µm) to 

produce different pulp densities. The pulp was stirred in an orbital shaker (News 

Brunswick) at 300 min
-1

, pH 8.0 and 23?2
o
C, during 10 hours. At the end of the 

experiment, the pH was measured, the pulp was filtered (45 µm porosity), and the 

manganese concentration in the aqueous phase was determined. This experiment was 

performed to define the mass of limestone and the residence time for continuous testing. 

 

Continuous experiments were carried out in a 1.67 L capacity stirred reactor at 23?2
o
C and 

pH 8.0 with the low-manganese water (1.5 mg.L
-1

). The latter was fed separately with (i) 

mine water and (ii) a pulp made up of limestone and distilled water. The solid content of 

the pulp was defined so that 4.2 g.L
-1

 limestone was achieved within the reactor (after 

mixing both streams). Both flows were pumped at 24.0 mL.min
-1

 (mine water) and 

4.0 mL.min
-1

 (limestone pulp) into the reactor. The residence time was set at 60 minutes, 

and experiments were run for at least 9 residence times to ensure steady-state conditions. 

Every 60 minutes, an aliquot was withdrawn from the reactor, filtered and the manganese 

content was determined by ICP-OES (Varian, 725); the solid residue was preserved for 

further analysis (MEV-EDS and infrared spectrophotometry). Prior to and during the 

experiments, the mine water was stored in plastic containers at room temperature. 

 

The subsequent experiments were performed with the 590-850 µm particle size fraction. 

 



 17 

2.2.3 - Kinetics experiments 

 

 

Kinetics modeling was applied to the sorption data and the pseudo-first-order and 

pseudosecond-order models were tested. These experiments were performed by mixing 

1.5 L of the low manganese water at pH 8.0 containing 1.5 mg.L
-1

 Mn
2+

 and 25 g.L
-1

 

limestone in an orbital shaker at 300 min
-1

 and 23?2
o
C. Another experiment was carried 

out following the same procedure with the 15 mg.L
-1

 Mn
2+

 mine water at pH 6.5 (initial 

value), which increased to 7.7 during the experiment. In both cases, samples were 

withdrawn after 5 minutes in the first half hour and after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 24 hours. At 

the end of the experiment, the pulp pH was measured, the slurry was filtered, and the 

manganese concentration in the aqueous phase was determined. Manganese concentration 

in the solid phase was determined by mass balance. 

 

2.2.4 - Equilibrium experiments  

 

A pseudo-sorption isotherm was drawn from the batch data using synthetic solution so that 

the maximum limestone loading could be assessed. The procedure involved shaking at 

300 min
-1

 in an orbital shaker, 0.12 L of the limestone pulp (3 g.L
-1

 solids) added to 0.25 L 

erlenmeyer flasks. Manganese concentrations varied from 1.5 to 25 mg.L
-1

 at pH 8.6-8.9 

and the experiments were run for 10 hours. Afterwards, the sorption process was modeled 

according to the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms. 

 

2.2.5 - Fixed –bed experiments 

 

These experiments were performed with the low and high manganese mine waters 

(Table 2.1).  Limestone particles with an average diameter of 720 µm (590-850 µm particle 



 18 

size range) were transferred to a glass column (2 cm diameter).  The column to particle 

diameter ratio was approximately 23, which is considered sufficient to minimize wall 

effect. Glass wood felts were placed on the top and bottom of the fixed bed to prevent loss 

of the solid particles. Experiments were carried out with bed heights (Z) varying from 100 

to 250 mm, which correspond to a limestone mass ranging from 38.57 to 98.71 g. The 

column height exceeds 100 particle diameters, thus backmixing may be disregarded. After 

loading, distilled water was passed through the limestone bed (during 60 min) to remove 

any fine particles that could have been loaded in the column. The column was fed upward 

by peristaltic pumps (Milan) to either avoid or minimize low resistance pathways for the 

solution, and the flow rate was varied from 1 to 3 mL.min
-1

. Effluent samples were 

collected from the column every 30 minutes. These samples were then analyzed with 

respect to manganese concentration, and metal loading on limestone was determined by 

mass balance.   

 

2.2.6 - Sorption characterization 

 

A limestone sample was pulverized (d90&lt;10 µm) and analyzed in a Zetasizer Nano ZS 

zetameter (Malvern). A pulp containing 0.5% solid and deionized water was prepared 

under agitation, and either NaOH or HCl was used to obtain the desired pH (6-12).  

 

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the morphology of the leach 

residues. The samples were coated with graphite by electro-deposition using a JEOL JEE 

4C instrument and investigated by a JEOL JSM 5510 scanning electron microscope (SEM) 

with an accelerating voltage 0.5–30 kV equipped with a spectrometer for micro-analysis 

based on an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy system (EDS).  

 



 19 

Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses were carried out in a Nicolet Nexus 470 model 

spectrophotometer equipped with a Centaurus microscope, an attenuated total reflectance 

(ATR) apparatus (Thermo) and a ZnSe internal reflection device. Medium infrared 

measurements were produced with a KBr beam splitter and a HgCdTe detector. The 

samples were pressed against a flat glass surface and mounted under the ATR apparatus. 

The spectra were collected in the 400-4000 cm
-1 

region with a minimum of 32 scans at a 

resolution of 4 cm
-1

. 

 

Both mine waters were analyzed before and after the experiments with respect to metal 

concentration by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, 

Varian 725) or atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) (Perkin Elmer AAnalist 100). 

Unless otherwise stated, the detection limit for manganese was determined using the 

procedure proposed by Osório Neto (1996) and was calculated to be 0.02 mg.L
-1

. 

 

2.3 - Modeling 

 

Batchwise sorption kinetic models have been extensively discussed in the literature, and a 

review can be found in the work of Qiu et al. (2009). Here, this matter will be briefly 

reviewed.  

 

Manganese loading kinetics on limestone can be modeled according to the general 

differential equation

 20 

Pseudo-first-order kinetics is followed when a = 1, and by integrating equation 2.1 

equation 2.2 is achieved. A plot of ln(1-U) versus t produces a straight line.

Equations 2.2 and 2.3 were applied to model batch manganese sorption kinetics on 

limestone. 

 

Different models were applied to the breakthrough curves, namely, (i) Bohart-Adams 

(1920), (ii) Thomas (1944), (iii) Yoon and Nelson (1984), (iv) Wolborska (1989) and (v) 

Dose-response (Yan et al., 2001). The Bohart-Adams equation was applied in the Bed 

Depth Service Time (BDST) model. These models have also been reviewed (Singh et al., 

2009; Wolborska, 1989; Yan et al., 2001), and the corresponding equations are presented 

in Table 2.1. The Bohart-Adams model assumes that the sorption rate is controlled by 

surface reaction, which is proportional to both the sorbent residual capacity and the 

adsorbent concentration (Calero et al., 2009). Thomas model assumes plug flow behavior 

in the solid bed; moreover, it also assumes that the sorption isotherm can be described by 



 21 

the Langmuir equation and that sorption kinetics is described by a second-order reversible 

equation. Therefore, this model is suitable for sorption processes that are not controlled by 

film or surface diffusion. The main assumption of the Yoon and Nelson model is that the 

rate of decrease in the sorption probability of each molecule is proportional to the 

probability of sorbate sorption and that of sorbate breakthrough (Calero et al., 2009). 

Wolborska (1989) aimed to model the low-concentration region of the breakthrough curve 

during mass transfer control by either film or axial diffusion.

The model applies to the linear part of a ln(C/C0) versus t curve in which both the 

adsorbate concentration in solution and at the sorbent at a determined level of the bed is 

considered constant and mass transfer is at a steady state. Finally, the modified Dose-

response model is an empirical equation proposed by Yan et al. (2001) to model fixed-bed 

biosorption, which was later applied to zinc (Senthilkumar et al., 2006) and chromium 

(Calero et al., 2009) removal in fixed-bed columns.

2.4 - Results and discussions   

 

In this work, two approaches were studied to investigate manganese removal by limestone, 

namely, (i) manganese sorption by finely powdered limestone in a stirred reactor and (ii) 

manganese removal in fixed-bed columns.  

 

2.4.1- Experiments in stirred tank with fine ground limestone 

 

Preliminary batch experiments using manganese-laden mining water (Table 2.2) were 

carried out to verify the mass of fine powdered material (&lt;45 mm, d50 = 8.6 µm) required 

for metal removal (C0 = 1.5 mg.L
-1

), and the value of 4.2 g.L
-1

 was chosen. This value 

enabled the manganese concentration to be reduced from 1.5 mg.L
-1

 to 0.28 mg.L
-1

 within 

60 minutes; this time was considered to be the residence time in the subsequent continuous 

experiments.  

 

As shown in Table 2.2, in addition to sulfate, the low manganese mine water contained 

1.5 mg.L
-1 

manganese while the high-manganese mine water contained 15.0 mg.L
-1

 

manganese.

Figure 2.1 shows the influence of time in both manganese removal and pulp pH for the 

low-manganese mine water (1.5 mg.L
-1

) in a continuous experiment. Both manganese 

removal and the pH increased with time. Within 60 minutes, the residual manganese 

concentration reached 1.28 mg.L
-1

, and the solution pH was 8.6; after 300 min, the pH 

level increased to 8.8, and the manganese concentration was reduced to 0.1 mg.L
-1

; after 9 

residence times, the residual manganese concentration was 0.07 mg.L
-1

 and this 

corresponds to a loading of 0.34 mg Mn.g
-1 

limestone. Franklin and Morse (1983) observed 

manganese removal to be defined by the mass of limestone but not by the initial 

manganese concentration. The authors also observed metal removals varying from 90 to 

99% from diluted manganese solutions (0.55 mg.L
-1

) whereas Silva et al. (2010) noticed 

that by increasing the limestone mass in the pulp the residual manganese concentration 

decreased.

Under similar experimental conditions, (1.64 L reactor, 60 minutes residence time and 

23±2
o
C), Silva et al. (2010) studied the effect of pH on manganese removal from mine 

waters and observed 97% removal from a 15.0 mg.L
-1

 manganese-containing mine water at 

pH 8.3-8.5 in the presence of 20.8 g.L
-1

 calcite limestone (0.77 mgMn.g
-1 

limestone). 

Therefore, stirred-reactor sorption can be an option for treating mine waters containing low 

to moderate manganese concentrations, as was also pointed out by Rose et al. (2003) in a 

review of AMD treatment with limestone.   

 

In addition to manganese, other metals present in the mine water were also removed from 

the low manganese water as shown in Table 2.2. The sulfate concentration in particular 

decreased from 564.0 mg.L
-1

 to 12.0 mg.L
-1

, indicating the high sorption affinity between 

sulfate and limestone. This observation is consistent with the work of Silva et al. (2010), 

which revealed the presence of sulfate on a limestone surface after mixing with mine 

water. Notwithstanding, this phenomenon is currently being investigated. 

 

2.4.2 - Experiments with the coarser limestone particles 

 

Given the low manganese concentration in the mine water, fixed-bed sorption is also an 

alternative method of manganese removal because sorption is especially suitable for the 

treatment of low-concentration effluents. In this regard, a series of experiments were 

carried out with the two mine water samples (Table 2.2) and a coarser (590-850 µm) 

particle size of the limestone particles.  

 

 



 25 

2.4.3 - Kinetics testing 

 

First, the manganese sorption kinetics in the coarser particle size fraction was assessed. 

Figure 2.2a depicts the influence of time on manganese removal in a batch system for both 

low and high manganese mine waters. For the experiment carried out with 15.0 mg.L
-1

 

manganese mine water, it can be observed in Figure 2.2a that a fast reduction in 

manganese concentration occurred within the first 15 min, followed by a slower step 

between 15 min and 60 min and a third phase (60–180 min), when the removal kinetics 

increase again. Therefore, both the pseudofirst order and the pseudosecond order models 

could not successfully describe the sorption kinetics. This is because such simple models 

sometimes cannot account for sorption on solid surfaces, which are usually 

inhomogeneous. Furthermore, the sorption mechanism can be complex.

 limestone, 1.5 L 

manganese solution, 1.5 mg.L

 and pH 8.0 or 15 mg.L

 and pH 6.5, 23±2°C. 

 

However, if a two-step sorption process is considered, the entire sorption process can be 

modeled by applying a pseudo-first-order model Figure 2.2b. The manganese sorption can 

be described by a rate constant value of  2.2x10

 (r

). The different values for the rate constant characterize 

manganese sorption as a multiple pseudofirst order process (Ho and McKay, 1999), 

representing different sorption mechanisms. The first stage corresponds to the binding of 

manganese atoms to the active sites on the adsorbent surface and manganese carbonate 

nucleation. Afterward, this manganese carbonate acts as a catalyst for further sorption on 

the adsorbent surface (Franklin and Morse, 1983). This sorption mechanism will be 

discussed later in this work. 

 

For the experiment with 1.5 mg.L

were increased to 4.98x10

  and 11.8x10

(1983), who also observed that manganese sorption follows a pseudofirst order model with 

a rate constant of 3.0 L.g
-1

.min
-1

. When both manganese concentrations are compared, for a 

ten-fold increase in the manganese concentration, there is an approximately 50% reduction 

in the rate constant values. 

 

2.4.4 - Equilibrium experiments 

 

After defining the time required for sorption equilibrium, a pseudo-sorption isotherm was 

produced so that the maximum sorption capacity could be determined (Figure 2.3). The 

sorption process can be described by both the Freundlich (r
2
 = 0.98) and Langmuir 

(r
2 

= 0.98) models. From the latter equation, maximum manganese loading of 

0.91 mgMn.mg
-1 

limestone was achieved on the coarse limestone fraction. McBride (1979) 

studied manganese sorption on fine limestone (0.49 m
2
.g

-1
 surface area) and found a 



 27 

maximum uptake value of 0.0034 mg.g
-1

, whereas Aziz et al. (2008) observed limestone 

loadings varying from 0.012 mg.g
-1

 (Zn) to 0.038 mg.g
-1

 (Ni) while studying Cu, Zn, Ni, 

Pb, Cd and Cr(III) on limestone. These values are lower than that observed for manganese 

sorption on zeolites (7.1 mg.g
-1

), for instance (Taffarel and Rubio, 2009).

2.4.5 - Fixed-bed experiments 

 

Fixed-bed experiments were performed to study the effects of bed height, flow rate and 

initial metal concentration on manganese sorption by limestone. Table 2.3 depicts the most 

important experimental parameters of the breakthrough curves presented in Figure 2.4. The 

breakthrough point was defined as 0.05 C0 and the saturation point was defined as 0.95 C0.

For the low manganese mine water (1.5 mgMn.L
-1

), Figures 2.4(a) and 2.4(b) show the 

effect of different bed lengths, varying from 10 cm to 25 cm, on the breakthrough curve for 

flow rate values of 1 cm.min
-1

 and 3 cm.min
-1

, respectively. As the bed height increased 

from 15 cm to 25 cm, the breakthrough curves changed from being steep to being flatter 

and concave. The evolution of the breakthrough curve of the longer bed (25 cm) was 

particularly gradual, meaning that the column was difficult to exhaust completely. The 

20 cm length bed seems to produce a suitable S shape; thus, the optimum length to 

diameter ratio for manganese sorption in a fixed-bed column should not be higher than 10.  

 

The effect of flow rate (1 mL.min
-1

 – 3 min.min
-1

) on the breakthrough curve can be 

observed in Table 2.3 for a bed length of 20 cm and initial manganese concentrations of 

1.5 and 15 mg.L
-1

. For decreasing flow rates, the breakthrough time tb and therefore the 

breakthrough volume Vb (volume of solution treated at the breakthrough point), increase, 

as was observed by Haghsheno et al. (2009) and Hussain et al. (2007). This is due to an 



 29 

increase in the Empty Bed Contact Time (EBCT), Table 2.3, because the front of the 

sorption zone reaches the top of the column later at smaller flow rates (Cooney, 1999). 

Thus, the breakthrough time decreased from 120 min to 90 min and the saturation time 

from 390 min to 340 min when the flow rate increased from 1 to 3 mL.min
-1

 in the 

experiments with 1.5 mgMn.L
-1

 (C0) and a 20 cm bed.  

 

Higher initial manganese concentrations (15 mg.L
-1

) resulted in earlier breakthrough points 

(Figure 2.4c), and tb values were reduced from 63 min to 9 when the flow rate increased; 

therefore, the saturation time was also reduced from 312 min (1 mL.min
-1

) to 50 min 

(3 mL.min
-1

) (Table 2.3). This result indicates the faster exhaustion of sorption sites and 

therefore bed saturation. At this initial concentration, a slight difference is observed in the 

breakthrough curves when the flow rate is changed from 2 mL.min
-1

 to 3 mL.min
-1

. 

Furthermore, the mass transfer zone (MTZ, Table 2.3) represents at least 70% of the bed 

height.

2.4.6 - Breakthrough modeling 

 

To model the breakthrough curves produced during manganese sorption by calcite limestone, 

the following models were applied: (i) Bed Depth Service Time (BDST); (ii) Thomas; (iii) 

Yoon and Nelson, (iv) Wolborska and (v) the Dose-response. The last model is an empirical 

equation that is widely used in biosorption studies (Calero et al., 2009; Senthilkumar et al., 

2006).  

 

From the Bohart-Adams equation (Table 2.1), the Bed Depth Service Time (BDST) model is 

developed when that equation is linearized to produce the following:

Equation 2.5 shows that the sorptive capacity of the bed (N0) is directly proportional to its 

height (Z) at 50% breakthrough; thus, N0 can be calculated from the slope in a plot of t0.5 

versus Z, and a straight line passing through the origin is expected. 

 

Figure 2.5 shows the BDST plot for the removal of manganese for bed heights varying from 

10 to 25 cm at both 5% and 50% breakthrough time and different flow rates. The bed sorption 

capacity was calculated from the slope of the 50% breakthrough plot as 2.24x10
-3

 mg.mL
-1 

in 

the experiments performed at 1 mL.min
-1

. As the flow rate increased to 3 mL.min
-1

, the bed 



 32  

 

 

sorption capacity increased to 7.92x10
-3

 mg.mL
-1

. The bed capacity was also determined for 

5% breakthrough and values corresponding to 1.38x10
-3

 mg.mL
-1

 and 3.78x10
-3

 mg.mL
-1

 

were observed at flow rates of 1 mL.min
-1

 and 3 mL.min
-1

, respectively. The sorption rate 

constant could be determined from the 5% breakthrough plot, and equation 2.4 predicts that 

the intercept should be a negative value.

As shown Figure 2.5, the intercepts at both 1 and 3 mL.min
-1

 are positive, which is a violation 

of the BDST theory. Therefore, the rate constant was not determined applying the BDST 

theory. Along with the fact that the linear plot does not pass through the origin, it is postulated 

that manganese sorption on limestone is complex (Srivastava et al., 2008). Nevertheless, 

comparing the intercepts at 5% breakthrough, this parameter is reduced (from +61.5 to +36.9) 

for increasing flow rates, which suggests that mass transfer in the fluid is more important than 

in the solid phase; otherwise, the observed intercept values would not be significantly affected 

by changes in the flow rate, as discussed by Cooney (1999). This might be likely ascribed to 



 33  

 

 

the low surface area of the limestone sample, which does not present significant porosity; 

therefore, sorption on the external surface seems to be more important than on pore walls. 

Figures 2.6-2.8 present the experimental and theoretical breakthrough curves for the 

experiments performed with both low and high manganese mine water samples. In addition, 

Tables 2.4 and 2.5 depict the values achieved by fitting equations 2-5 (Table 2.1) to the 

experimental data. With the exception of the Wolborska model (Table 2.5), all equations 

produced good correlation coefficients between the theoretical and the experimental data 

(r
2
?0.99) when the low manganese water was studied (1.5 mg.L

-1
).  

 

The Thomas equation reproduces the sorption process fairly accurately at low manganese 

concentrations (Figure 2.6). This model shows solid phase (q0) and bed loading (N0) values, 

which decrease with increasing bed lengths, at the same flow rate.

For instance, an increase in column height from 10 to 25 cm resulted in a reduction in 

limestone loading from 0.017 mgMn.mL
-1 

bed to 0.005 mgMn.mL
-1 

bed for of 1.5 mgMn.L
-1

 

(Table 2.4). Similarly, at the same bed depth (20 cm), when the influent flow rate increased, 

the volumetric bed capacity also increased from 0.005 mgMn.mL
-1 

bed (1 mL.min
-1

) to 

0.013 mgMn.mL
-1 

bed (3 mL.min
-1

). Furthermore, the higher inlet concentration (15.0 mg.L
-1

) 

enabled a better utilization of the limestone sorption capacity as higher bed and particle 

loadings were achieved (at lower flow rates) compared with those of the low-manganese 

water (Table 2.4). The values predicted by the Thomas equation are larger than those 

produced by the BDST model because the former calculates loading from the whole area 

above the breakthrough curve whereas the latter determines bed loading only for either 5% or 

50% breakthrough. 

 

Nevertheless, manganese sorption in limestone is small and decreased from 0.033 to 

0.010 mgMn.g
-1 

limestone for 15.0 mg.L
-1

 Mn
2+ 

(C0) mine water when the flow rate increased. 

Similar flow rate effects were observed by Singh et al. in studying furfural sorption by 

activated carbon (2009). Kinetic factors account for the smaller uptakes observed in the 

column experiments with respect to the values predicted by the isotherm presented in 

Figure 2.2 due to short mean residence times. 

 

The values of the rate constant kYN and the time required for 50% sorbate breakthrough (t0.5) 

achieved from fitting the Yoon and Nelson model to the experimental data can be observed in 

Table 2.5. The values t0.5 are similar to the experimental values (Table 2.3 and Figure 2.7).

Furthermore, the Dose–response model also shows very good agreement with the 

breakthrough points (Figure 2.8). The values of manganese loading in limestone, q0, are 

similar to those determined with the Thomas model (Table 2.4) and decrease with bed length 

for the lower manganese concentration (1.5 mg.L

), for constant flow rates.

However, it does not show good fitting to the experiment carried out at a flow rate of

a slightly worse fitting was observed, especially for the experiments performed at 3 mL.min

The Wolborska model in particular did not produce good fittings to the experimental data 

with the 15 mgMn.L
-1

 mine water, and the predicted bed manganese loadings were different 

from those predicted by the Thomas model (Table 2.5). The ? parameter in the Wolborska 

model reflects the effect of both mass transfers in the liquid phase and axial dispersion during 

manganese sorption on limestone (Srivastava et al., 2008; Wolborska, 1989). The observed ? 

values decreased with the bed length (same flow rate), implying an increased resistance to 

mass transfer in the liquid phase. Moreover, because axial dispersion can be neglected in 

liquid phase systems (Cooney, 1999), the increasing of ? with flow rate is also consistent with 

film diffusion control, especially at lower manganese concentrations (1.5 mg.L
-1

).  

 

2.5 - Manganese uptake characterization 

 

 

The determination of the zeta potential enabled the assessment of the sorption mechanisms. 

Figure 2.9 presents the zeta potential data for calcite limestone as a function of pH. The 

isoelectric point (IEP) of the raw sample is 9.8, which is consistent with the values reported 

elsewhere (Morse, 1986; Salinas-Nolasco et al., 2004; Somasundaran and Agar, 1967). 

During the column experiments, the pH increased to values above 8.15, thus electrostatic 

interaction between the negatively charged limestone surface and Mn
2+

 as well as specific 

interactions between manganese and the carbonate (or hydroxide) ions on the limestone 

surface may account for sorption in the fixed-bed column.

The solid residue produced during the experiments using the low-manganese water was 

characterized by infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy 

dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Figure 2.10a shows an image of the surface of the 

residue alongside manganese mapping. The figure shows that manganese is distributed 

throughout the limestone surface and is not concentrated in a particular site, suggesting a 

possible adsorption mechanism. Figure 2.10b shows the spectrum of a selected point in 

Figure 10a as determined by dispersive X-ray energy. The presence of copper can be 

observed, which can be explained by its presence in the mine water (Table 2.2). Manganese is 

not observed in the EDS spectrum because of its dispersion on the limestone surface 

(Figure 2.10a).

The presence of manganese carbonate on limestone surfaces has been proposed by different 

authors. Blanchard and Baer (1992) proposed that the Mn
2+

 ion is incorporated in calcium 

carbonate, forming a CaCO3-MnCO3 solution. Zachara et al. (1991) also suggested solid 

solution formation and included chemical sorption and precipitation on limestone surfaces as 

potential mechanisms. Metals with ionic radii smaller than the radius of calcium (0.99 Å), 

such as manganese (0.80 Å) for example, can form solid solutions with limestone. The 

authors suggested an exchange reaction on limestone surfaces (equation 2.6), which could 

also explain the results observed during manganese sorption from mining water on fine 

powered limestone.

The results suggest that manganese can be sorbed by calcite limestone; however, low loading 

capacities are expected. Manganese removal can be improved if particle size is reduced, and 

sorption can be carried out in stirred reactors instead of fixed-bed columns. 

 

2.6 - Conclusions 

 

Limestone can be applied for manganese sorption from mine waters. Equilibrium sorption can 

be described by either Freundlich or Langmuir equations, resulting in a maximum uptake of 

0.91 mg.g
-1

 limestone. The sorption kinetics can be divided into two steps, both following a 

pseudo-first-order model with rate constant values varying from 2.2x10
-3

 L.(min.g)
-1

 to 

11.8x10
-3

 L.(min.g)
-1

. The Thomas, Yoon and Nelson and Dose-response models were 

suitable in describing the observed sorption behavior. The Wolborska model showed a poor 

fit with the experimental data, especially for the high-manganese mine water. FTIR showed 



 43  

 

 

the presence of manganese carbonate on the limestone surface, and the zeta potential 

suggested that the limestone surface is negatively charged during sorption. Metal uptake was 

low and increased with flow rate for the low-manganese mine water but decreased when the 

metal concentration in the solution was high (15 mg.L
-1

). During fixed-bed experiments, 

maximum uptake (0.057 mg.mL
-1 

bed) was observed for 15 mgMn.L
-1

 at the lower flow rate 

(1 mL.min
-1

). The BDST model confirmed low manganese uptake at breakthrough, but 

alternatively manganese can also be removed in stirred reactors.

Abstract 

 

Manganese is one of the most difficult elements to remove from mine waters, due to its high 

solubility in both acid and neutral conditions; thus it can be found in quite high 

concentrations, depending on the rocks mineralogy. Metal carbonate can be an effective way 

for its removal, as manganese carbonate has been detected in net alkaline mine waters. 

However, limestone is effective in removing manganese only if the metal content is low. This 

work sought to study manganese precipitation from high manganese (140 mg.L
-1

) mine 

waters applying sodium carbonate and limestone mixtures. It was observed that besides total 

carbonate concentration, pH plays a key role on manganese carbonate formation. Provided the 

pH solution is above 8.5, 99.9% manganese removal can be achieved with carbonate ions. 

Although not required for manganese precipitation, limestone acts as a solid substrate for the 

nucleation of fine manganese carbonate grains. Infrared spectroscopy showed manganese 

carbonate precipitation on the limestone surface. Magnesium was also removed from the mine 

water but magnesium carbonate formation was not observed.

3.1 – Introduction 

 

 

Manganese is a toxic element usually found in the effluents of many industries, as well as in 

mine waters, either neutral or acid (AMD). AMD is produced from the oxidation of sulfide 

minerals as a result of exposure to both oxygen and water during the mining and processing of 

metal sulfides and coal [1]. Besides manganese, the large content of other elements (mainly 

iron, aluminium, sulphate and other dissolved materials during acid attack on the mining 

tailings) found in the AMD is also a concern. Most of these elements can be removed by just 

increasing drainage pH, which is achieved usually by lime addition. Since metal solubility is 

reduced as pH increases, lime is able to reduce metal concentrations and enables drainage 

compliance with environmental regulations. Metal sulfide precipitation is also applied to 

remove the transition metal elements, since the residual metal concentrations are very low [2, 

3]. Nevertheless, neither lime nor sulfide ions are effective in removing manganese, as this 

element is soluble over a wide pH range and very difficult to remove from contaminated 

waters; requiring pH above 11 for an effective removal as hydroxide [4].       

 

 

Mn
2+

 oxidation and precipitation as MnO2 followed by clarification is also an alternative to 

treat manganese-containing drainages. Chemical oxidation can be performed by aeration or 

applying strong oxidizing agents, such as potassium permanganate, hypochlorite or ozone [5]. 

Notwithstanding, the presence of both ferrous iron and organic matter increases oxidant 

consumption so that iron removal is required prior to manganese oxidation [6, 7]. Biological 

processes are an alternative, specially in low manganese waters [8]. The metal can also be 

precipitated as carbonate, since manganese-bearing carbonate minerals such as rhodochrosite 

(MnCO3) and kutnahorite (CaMn(CO3)2), have been identified in mine affected waters; thus 



 50  

 

 

materials capable of releasing CO3
2-

 or HCO3
- 
anions have application potential. Kutnahorite 

precipitation was detected in mine waters with a  high content of dissolved calcium, 

magnesium, manganese and CO2 and its precipitation was enhanced by higher pH values [9]. 

It is also proposed that dissolved manganese could precipitate as MnCO3, replacing calcium 

in calcite or co-precipitating with the latter, provided there is supersaturation with respect to 

both calcite and rhodochrosite [10]. 

 

Limestone is the most common neutralizing agent for acid waters [11] due to its availability 

[12] and low-cost in many countries and it is likely to be either the first option for metal 

removal from many wastewaters or be combined with other treatment technologies such as 

sulfate reduction [13]. In addition, dissolved carbonate is paramount for manganese carbonate 

formation; otherwise manganese oxy-hydroxides are produced as already observed in mine 

waters [10]. Previous work on manganese uptake by limestone showed efficient removal for 

low to moderate manganese concentrations (16 mg.L
-1

), as well as the presence of manganese 

carbonate on the limestone surface [5]. Bamforth et al. [14] studied manganese (~3 mg.L
-1

) 

removal from a mine water with a total alkalinity of 3 meq.L
-1

 by dolomite, limestone, 

magnesite and quartzite. Besides this, the authors observed kutnahorite formation on 

quartizite while magnesium-rich calcites were identified in the dolomite and magnesite 

reactors, suggesting that the magnesium from the substrate minerals may have inhibited 

manganese carbonate formation. The authors concluded that the nature of the solid substrate 

does not affect manganese removal. 

 

When alkalinity is not sufficient for manganese precipitation, soluble carbonate sources can 

be added to the reacting system. Zhang et al. [15] studied manganese removal with sodium 

carbonate (Na2CO3) from effluents produced in hydrometallurgical operations. From a 



 51  

 

 

1.76 g.L
-1

 Mn solution at pH 5.9, manganese precipitation occurred at pH above 7.5, reaching 

90 % at pH 8.0. Higher removals could have been achieved provided pH was further 

increased. In addition, mineral carbonates such as limestone have been shown to affect the 

manganese precipitation pathway, hindering manganese carbonate formation. Accordingly, 

this work was undertaken to assess the effects of both soluble carbonate and limestone on 

manganese removal from mine water with high manganese content.    

 

3.2 – Experimental 

 

A calcite limestone sample assaying 39.5% calcium and 1.23% magnesium was kindly 

provided by Brazilian producers. This sample was first sieved and subsequently dry ground in 

a vibrating cup mill (Pulverisette 9, Fritsch) and had its particle size distribution assessed by 

laser diffraction (CILAS - 1064), which showed d50 and d90 values of  5.6 µm and 18 µm, 

respectively. The limestone surface area (1.52 m
2
.g

-1
) was measured by the N2 adsorption 

method (Quantachrome Nova 1000). 

 

Manganese removal experiments were carried out with synthetic solutions as well as with 

mine water. Part of the batch experiments were performed with calcite limestone mixed with 

sodium carbonate (Na2CO3); the other part being performed with a mixture of bicarbonate 

(NaHCO3) and sodium hydroxide. Synthetic solutions containing 140-2000 mg.L
-1

 

manganese (MnCl2.4H2O) prepared at pH 2.3-6.5 were studied. The experiments were 

completed with mine water assaying 140.0 mg.L
-1

 manganese (at pH 6.5). A volume of 

120 mL solution (synthetic or mine water) was transferred to 250 mL erlenmeyer flasks and 

mixed with different limestone (4.2 to 20.8 g.L
-1

) and sodium carbonate amounts (0.39 to 

0.92 g.L
-1

). The flasks were kept under agitation (450 min
-1

), during 90 minutes and at 



 52  

 

 

23±2
o
C. When the experiments were finished, the pH value was recorded (Handylab 1, 

schott), the solid phase was filtered and the aqueous solution was analyzed for manganese. 

The effect of time on manganese precipitation was determined in a 2.0 L open erlenmeyer 

flask where 1.5 L manganese solution was mixed with both limestone (12.5 g.L
-1

) and 

calcium carbonate (0.67 g.L
-1

), at pH 6.5 (initial value). This flask was stirred at 450 min
-1

, 

23±2
o
C and samples were withdrawn at every 5 minutes for manganese determination.  

 

Continuous experiments were carried out in a stirred reactor with a 1.67 L capacity, at 

23±2
o
C. The latter was fed separately with (i) a 140 mg.L

-1
 manganese-bearing mine water or 

synthetic manganese solutions and (ii) a blend made up of limestone (12.5 g.L
-1

)
    

and sodium 

carbonate (0.67 g.L
-1

). One experiment was carried out with only sodium carbonate (same 

concentration); that is, in the absence of limestone. The stirring rate was set at 1200 min
-1

 and 

pumping was provided by two peristaltic pumps (Milan 628); one feeding the manganese 

solution at 24.0 mL.min
-1

 and the second, the limestone sodium carbonate (4.0 mL.min
-1

). 

Residence time was set at 60 minutes and experiments ran for at least 9 residence times to 

ensure steady state conditions. After every 60 minutes, an aliquot was withdrawn from the 

reactor, filtered and the manganese content and pH were determined. The solid residue was 

preserved for further analysis (MEV-EDS and Infrared spectrophotometry). Prior to and 

during the experiments, the mine water was stored in plastic containers at room temperature. 

 

 

3.2.1 – Characterization 

 

 

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the morphology of the 

precipitates. The samples were coated with graphite by electro-deposition, using a JEOL JEE 

4C instrument. They were then investigated by a JEOL JSM 5510 scanning electron 



 53  

 

 

microscope (SEM), with an accelerating voltage 0.5 – 30 kV, equipped with a spectrometer 

for micro-analysis based on an energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy system (EDS). 

 

Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyzes were carried out in a Nicolet Nexus 470 model 

spectrophotometer, equipped with a Centaurus microscope, an attenuated total reflectance 

(ATR) apparatus (Thermo) and a ZnSe internal reflection devise. Medium infrared 

measurements were produced with a KBr bean splitter and an HgCdTe detector. The samples 

were pressed against a flat glass surface and mounted under the ATR apparatus. The spectra 

were collected in the 400-4000 cm
-1 

region with a minimum of 32 scans at 4 cm
-1 

resolution. 

 

The mine water was analyzed, before and during the experiments, for metals by inductively 

coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Varian 725) or atomic absorption 

spectrometry (AAS) (Perkin Elmer AAnalisty 100). 

 

3.3 - Results and discussions 

 

 

The cleaner production principles applied to the mine waters include: (i) reducing the 

production of contaminated mine waters and (ii) recycling and reuse. Specifically, improving 

effluent quality and optimizing the treatment process so as to comply with the effluent 

regulations are two of the most applied approaches [16]. In this regard, manganese removal is 

currently one of the greatest challenges. 

 

The mine water was analyzed, before and during the experiments, for metals by  ICP-OES or 

AAS and the results are depicted in Table 3.1.

Manganese can be removed from both mine waters and industrial wastewaters as different 

compounds and the form of removal is defined by the water chemistry, specially pH and Eh 

values. In oxidizing conditions, manganese oxy-hydroxides are formed, while manganese 

bearing carbonate minerals, such as rhodochrosite (MnCO3) and kutnahorite (CaMn(CO3)2), 

are observed to precipitate naturally in the presence of carbonate ions, if the pH is above the 

7-8 region. Figure 3.1 presents manganese solubility when considering the precipitation of 

either manganese carbonate or hydroxide.

Manganese carbonate solubility was calculated by equation 3.1, presented by Lloyd et al. 

[17], which includes MnHCO3

and MnOH

+
 complexes on the manganese solubility as well as 

the total carbonate concentration. This equation was shown to predict fairly accurately 

aqueous manganese concentrations in equilibrium with manganese carbonate [17]. Also 

included in Figure 3.1 is the theoretical manganese hydroxide solubility at 25

 dissolved carbonate concentrations and pH values above 8, the manganese 

concentration is reduced to values below 10

.   

 

To achieve the same residual metal concentration, a pH value of 10 or higher is required when 

hydroxide precipitation is used. Therefore, carbonate precipitation ensures lower residual 

manganese concentrations in neutral pH values as compared to metal hydroxide removal. This 

observation is consistent with the findings of Dayube [18], who stated that alkalinity is one of 

the most cost-effective methods for manganese removal from mine waters. Another outcome 

from Figure 3.1 is that carbonate precipitation enables easier compliance with environmental

In this work, the approach utilized by Bamforth et al. [14] was followed; thereby a 

combination of limestone and soluble carbonate sources was studied. Experiments with 

synthetic solutions were carried out to determine the amount of both limestone powder 

(&lt;0.045 mm) and sodium carbonate required for manganese removal from a 140 mg.L
-1 

synthetic manganese solution, which is the same as the metal concentration in the mine water 

studied in the present work (Table 3.1). It can be observed in Figure 3.2, that limestone alone 

does not remove manganese effectively at such high concentrations. The metal concentration 

was reduced to 120 mg.L

 when 25 g.L

 limestone was applied (Figure 3.2a), which is 

equivalent to a manganese uptake of 0.98 mgMn

This is due to the manganese sorption on calcium carbonate as observed in a previous work 

carried out by Silva et al. [5]. The authors also observed a pH increase during manganese 

removal by limestone and determined that 1.28 mgMn
2+

.g
-1

 limestone was the maximum 

loading in continuous experiments. 

 

Unlike powdered limestone, sodium carbonate precipitates manganese extensively 

(Figure 3.2b), as expected. In the presence of 0.67 g.L
-1

 sodium carbonate, the solution’s pH 

reaches 9.6 and the manganese concentration is reduced to values below the detection limit 

with the synthetic solution. Lower carbonate concentrations produce smaller final pH values 

and thus higher residual manganese concentrations in the aqueous phase as demonstrated in 

Figure 3.1. These results are consistent with the studies carried out by Zhang et al. [15] during 

manganese removal from effluents produced in hydrometallurgical operations, which also 

observed that a pH value above 8.0 is needed to produce residual manganese concentrations 



 58  

 

 

below 1 mg.L
-1

. Similarly, Costa and Teixeira [19] observed smaller residual manganese 

concentrations for increasing pH values. 

 

The effect of time on manganese removal is shown in Figure 3.3 for experiments comprising 

the application of 12.5 g.L
-1

 limestone mixed with either different carbonate sources or 

sodium hydroxide. It can be observed that calcium carbonate reduces the manganese 

concentration to 124 mg.L
-1

, within 100 minutes; that is, only 11% of the manganese was 

removed from the solution. When stoichiometrical concentrations of sodium bicarbonate 

(0.21 g.L
-1

) are mixed with a 140 mg.L
-1

 manganese solution, only a minor effect on metal 

removal (15%) was noticed and the final manganese concentration reached 120 mg.L
-1

, which 

is similar to the value observed when only calcium carbonate was applied. When the Na2CO3 

concentration is increased to 0.67 mg.L
-1

, manganese concentration is reduced to 81.8 mg.L
-1

 

for a final pH value of 8.0. This behavior should be compared to the experiments carried out 

with sodium carbonate (Figure 3.4). With 0.26 g.L
-1

 Na2CO3 (stoichiometrical amount to 

precipitate 140 mg.L
-1

 Mn
2+

), removal efficiency is improved to 47 % and the manganese 

concentration is reduced to 74.7 mg.L
-1

. For the optimum value defined in Figure 3.2b, the 

residual manganese concentration in solution is below the detection limit; in other words, 

100% removal was achieved. Figure 3.3 also shows the effect of pH on the aqueous 

manganese concentration. After 100 minutes, residual metal concentration is 6.5 mg.L
-1

 when 

the pH is maintained in 10 with NaOH. With sodium hydroxide, manganese is removed as 

manganese hydroxide, which is more soluble than manganese carbonate (the expected species 

in the presence of high carbonate concentrations).

From the data presented in Figures 3.3 and 3.4, it is clear that the presence of soluble 

carbonate species is not the only factor accounting for metal removal, but instead, the pH has 

a leading role on the removal efficiency [20]. Even at higher carbonate concentrations, lower 

removal efficiencies were observed with sodium bicarbonate as compared to sodium 

carbonate (final pH 9.8) or even sodium hydroxide at pH 10.0. Figure 3.1 explains this 

behavior as it shows smaller equilibrium metal concentrations when the pH increases in the 

presence of carbonate ions. Figure 3.4 also shows a fast reduction on aqueous manganese 

concentration during the first five minutes, followed by a slower decrease in metal 

concentration with time and suggests that 90 minutes are sufficient for the manganese 

concentration to be stabilized.

In addition, manganese removal from the mine water by sodium carbonate limestone mixtures 

is slower than that observed from the synthetic solution. The manganese concentration was 

reduced to 1 mg.L
-1

 within 60 minutes in the experiments with the latter, while 90 minutes 

was required for the metal concentration to reach 0.18 mg.L
-1

, at pH 8.6, when the mine water 

was tested. 

 

In addition to mine drainages, manganese can be also present in effluents of 

hydrometallurgical operations as well as other industries and concentrations above 1 mg.L
-1

 

may be found [15]. The element can be also present in leaching liquors for instance during sea 

nodules and nickel laterite leaching. In these solutions, manganese concentrations are high 

and carbonate was shown to precipitate manganese selectively with respect to calcium and 

magnesium [21]. The carbonate efficiency in increasing pH, as well as the manganese 

removal, was assessed from synthetic solutions, in which the manganese concentration varied 



 61  

 

 

from 300.0 mg.L
-1

 to 2000.0 mg.L
-1

, prepared at an initial pH value of 2.3. Figure 3.5 shows 

that high manganese removal can be achieved provided sufficient carbonate is added to the 

system.

A residual manganese concentration below 1 mg.L
-1

, as well as solution pH values above 8.8, 

was observed for all tested manganese concentrations. These results are consistent with the 

work of Jimenez et al. [22] and Silva et al. [5]. 

 

Continuous experiments were carried out as a preliminary step of a future pilot scale test. 

Such experiments were performed with both the synthetic solution and the mine water. 

Manganese removal is faster when synthetic solutions are studied, as the metal concentration 

is reduced from 140 mg.L

 to 0.8 mg.L
-1

 in the presence of both limestone (12.5 g.L

When the mine water was treated with limestone and sodium carbonate, the manganese 

concentration reached a concentration of 0.81 mg.L

 at pH 8.8, after 8 resident times 

(480 min). In the experiment carried out only with sodium carbonate, the final concentration 

was similar (0.81 mg.L
-1

); however, with a slower precipitation rate likely due to the absence 

of limestone in the reactor which would act as a surface for heterogeneous nucleation. This 

finding is supported by Aziz et al. [23], who stated that the presence of solid limestone 

improves metal removal efficiencies. When the initial pH is 2.3, manganese removal was also 

high because a higher sodium carbonate concentration was applied (0.83 g.L
-1

) that increased 

the solution pH to the 7.1 - 9.2 range.

It was also noticed that sulfate removal (Table 3.1) did not impair manganese precipitation. 

This phenomenon was observed in a previous work when powdered limestone was applied for 

manganese removal from a 16 mg.L
-1

 Mn
2+

 and 2400 mg.L
-1

 sulfate solution [5].  

 

 

These authors observed a reduction in manganese removal from mine waters as compared to 

synthetic solutions and this was ascribed to sulfate precipitation on the limestone surface. As 

shown in Table 3.1, the sulfate concentration (determined as total sulfur by ICP-OES) was 

reduced from 918 mg.L
-1

 to 265 mg.L
-1

 (equivalent to an uptake of 52.2 mg.g
-1

), which is 

slightly above the 250 mg.L
-1

 discharge limit set by many countries worldwide. Other 

transition metal elements, although in low concentrations were also removed during 

treatment. These metals were shown to precipitate as either carbonates (FeCO3 and ZnCO3) or 

mixed hydroxide-carbonate compounds [24], which seems to be the case for copper and lead 

in the present work. Nevertheless, sulfate may have affected manganese removal kinetics, 

since its removal from mine water was slower than from synthetic solutions and this was also 

observed in batch experiments. Notwithstanding, sulfate sorption by limestone is currently 

being investigated. 

 

As high carbonate concentration and pH values were utilized in the present work, manganese 

removal as carbonate was expected; thereby infrared spectroscopy was applied to confirm 

manganese carbonate formation. This was achieved by analyzing the solid material produced 

during manganese removal by limestone-sodium carbonate blends. Figure 3.7 shows the 

spectra of limestone before and after contact with the manganese-laden solutions.

The spectrum of a sample of pure manganese carbonate is also presented for comparison. For 

pure calcite limestone, a characteristic band assigned to the C=O shift is seen at 712 cm
-1

. 

This absorption band is seen at 724 cm
-1

 for pure manganese carbonate, as proposed by the 

Nassrallah-Aboukais et al. [25], who found this characteristic band at 726 cm
-1

 for 

rhodocrosite. Also, Makreski and Jovanovski [26] observed C=O shifts at 712 cm
-1 

and 

722 cm
-1

, assigned to CaCO3 and MnCO3 in kutnahorite (CaMnMg(CO3)2). Similarly, this 

C=O band was observed at 728 cm
-1

 for manganese carbonate by Santillán et al. [27]. In 

addition to the C=O band at 712 cm
-1

 (limestone), Figure 3.7 also shows a smaller IR shift at 

724 cm
-1

 in the manganese-containing limestone produced in the experiments with the mine 

water and those carried out with synthetic solutions containing 300 mg.L
-1

 (ppt. I) and 



 65  

 

 

1500 mg.L
-1

 (ppt. II) manganese (Figure 3.5). The formation of manganese carbonate was 

confirmed by IR spectroscopy and the C=O band at 724 cm
-1

 is easily seen when the mass of 

precipitated manganese carbonate is larger (ppt. II). These results are supported by XPS 

studies on manganese - calcite interactions [28].   

 

Bamforth et al. [14] studied metal carbonate precipitation in the presence of limestone aiming 

to treat a mine water containing up to 5 mg.L
-1

 manganese in the presence of calcium 

(~200 g.L
-1

) and magnesium (80-100 mg.L
-1

). Manganese carbonate was not observed on the 

surface of limestone even though the mine water presented 2 meq.L
-1

 total alkalinity. 

Contrarily, magnesium calcite was the only described precipitate in the surface of either 

dolomite, magnesite or limestone and it was suggested that the presence of magnesium 

inhibited manganese carbonate formation. For the mine water studied in the present work, 

Table 3.1 suggests that the calcium removal was negligible, likely derived from limestone 

dissolution during the experiments as previously discussed (Figure 3.2). Conversely, 

magnesium was also removed from the mine water as its concentration was reduced from 90.0 

to 21.3 mg.L
-1

. Nevertheless, MgCO3 which has the C=O characteristic band at 749 cm
-1

 [29]
 

could not be detected in Figure 3.7, possibly due to the low MgCO3 amount co-precipitated 

with manganese. The findings of Bamforth et al. [14] seem to be related to the high Mg/Mn 

ratio (&gt; 20) in the mine water studied, which does not seem to be the case in the present work, 

where the initial Mg/Mn ratio was 0.64. 

 

The precipitates were also analyzed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy 

dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Figure 3.8 depicts limestone particles containing 

manganese produced in different conditions. Figures 3.8a and 3.8b show both images and 

EDS spectra of the solid material produced in the experiment with the mine water, while 



 66  

 

 

Figures 3.8c and 3.8d show limestone particles containing manganese precipitated in the 

experiments with 300 mg.L
-1

  and 2.000 mg.L
-1

 manganese, respectively.  All EDS spectra 

show calcium which is an indication that the larger particles are limestone, whereas 

Figures 3.8b and 3.8c show manganese mapping. While the EDS spectra identify manganese 

on the surface of all the analyzed limestone particles, Figures 3.8b and 3.8c suggest that 

manganese carbonate precipitates as very fine crystals, which is further supported by (i) an 

increase in both surface and micropore areas from 1.54 m

 and 2.20 m

 to 4.45 m

, respectively; as well as (ii) a reduction on d50 of the particle size distribution 

from 5.6 µm to 3.6 µm, indicating a higher proportion of fine particles. 

 

The produced manganese carbonate, although contaminated with magnesium can be blended 

with manganese carbonate and smelted in the production of manganese ferroalloys. 

Magnesium carbonate is always present in these ores and is applied in the slag production 

step [30]. It can also be applied in the production of manganese dioxide, since manganese 

carbonate is easily soluble in sulfuric acid solutions [31] without requiring any reducing 

agent. It is very likely that mine waters or process effluents with high manganese 

concentrations will be generated in a manganese mine or a manganese producing plant. 

Therefore, this blending could likely be carried out in a cost-effective way.

Figures 3.1-3.3 explain manganese removal efficiency with sodium carbonate solutions. 

Besides the carbonate concentration, pH control is also an important parameter for effective 

manganese carbonate precipitation. Manganese carbonate solubility increases quickly with 

acidity and even for high carbonate/metal ratios, but at lower pH values, precipitation may not 

be complete. Bamforth et al. [14] observed low manganese removal (30%) with a mine water 

containing an average of 3 mg.L
-1

 manganese, irrespective of the solid substrate utilized, at 

pH 8.1. Conversely, Silva et al. [5] observed complete manganese removal from a 16.0 mg.L
-1

 

mine water at pH 8.8 with fine powdered limestone. The reason for the low removal observed 

in the former work is likely the lower pH of the mine water, which cannot support extensive 

manganese carbonate formation. For those mine waters containing high manganese and 

relatively low calcium and magnesium concentrations, manganese carbonate can be actually 

observed on limestone surfaces, provided the mine water pH is increased. When limestone is 

present, the removal kinetics is improved and a denser solid residue is produced with likely 

better settling features than the manganese carbonate alone. Future pilot scale experiments 

will aim at determining process parameters and economics of an industrial scale process.   

 

3.4 – Conclusions 

 

Limestone-sodium carbonate blends are beneficial for manganese removal from mine waters. 

Sodium carbonate can provide carbonate ions to precipitate high manganese contents in mine 

water and industrial effluents, whereas powdered limestone induces the heterogeneous 

nucleation of manganese carbonate. Manganese removal efficiency is defined by pH with 

values above 8.5 resulting in massive metal removal from the solution. Manganese carbonate 

precipitation was confirmed by both infrared and EDS spectroscopy. Powdered limestone

enhances manganese precipitation kinetics and produces denser solid residue with potential 

advantages regarding settling properties.

Abstract 

 

The precipitation of sulfate, iron and aluminum is the main factor accounting for armoring 

during limestone treatment of acid mine drainages, which renders the acidity neutralization 

processes ineffective. Accordingly, limestone can be an option for sulfate removal, 

particularly from neutral mine drainages. This work investigated sulfate removal from neutral 

mine waters through sorption on limestone in stirred-tank and fixed-bed experiments. The 

continuous stirred-tank experiments reduced the sulfate concentration from 588 to 87 mg.L
-1

 

at a 210 min residence time. The batch equilibrium tests showed that sulfate loading on 

limestone can be described by the Langmuir isotherm, and a maximum loading of 23.7 mg.g
- 1 

limestone was achieved. Fixed-bed experiments were utilized to produce breakthrough curves 

at different bed depths and flow rates. The BDST model was then applied, and it indicated 

sulfate loadings of up to 20.0 g SO4
-2

.L
-1 

bed as the flow rate increased from 1 to 10 mL.min
-1

. 

Thomas, Yoon-Nelson and Dose response models showed good correlations with the 

experimental data, predicting a particle loading of 20 mg.g
-1 

limestone. Infrared spectrometry 

indicated the presence of sulfate ions and manganese carbonate on the limestone surface, with 

the latter being the main toxic metal in the mine water. Sulfate sorption on limestone seems to 

be an alternative to treating mine waters with moderate sulfate concentrations (below the 

1500-2000 mg.L
-1

 range), where lime precipitation is not effective. In addition, this approach 

does not require alkaline pH values, as in the ettringite process.

4.1 - Introduction  

 

Sulfate is a major anion occurring in both natural waters and industrial effluents, such as those 

of the chemical and metallurgical industries [1, 2], as well as acid mine drainage (AMD) [3]. 

AMD is generated by the oxidation of sulfide minerals in the presence of water and oxygen, 

producing acidic effluents with large sulfate, iron, aluminum and manganese concentrations 

as well as hazardous trace elements, such as arsenic and uranium, depending on the 

mineralogy of the ore [4].  

 

Compared with toxic metals, sulfate is only mildly hazardous. Therefore, many countries have 

no set guidelines for sulfate in drinking water. However, sulfate can affect the taste of water 

and can have laxative effects at concentrations above 600 mg.L
-1

. The World Health 

Organization recommends that health authorities be notified if sulfate concentrations rise 

above 500 mg.L
-1

  in drinking water [5]. Likewise, environmental agencies in mining 

countries have set values varying between 250 and 500 mg.L
-1

 in mine drainages or effluents. 

When there is no limit for sulfate, it is common to define limits for total dissolved solids, 

implying that sulfate concentrations must comply with that value [6]. Considering the high 

concentrations typically found in AMD, regulating sulfate is a considerable task.  

 

Established methods for sulfate removal from mine waters include the following: (i) chemical 

precipitation as gypsum, barium sulfate or ettringite; (ii) biological treatment with sulfate 

reducing bacteria; and (iii) sorption technologies, including membrane and ion exchange [3]. 

The selection of the wastewater treatment technique usually depends on the type of 

wastewater, the removal kinetics, the sulfate concentration [7], the contaminant concentration 

defined by environmental regulations [8] and costs. When there is a market for the drinking 



 75  

 

 

water produced from AMD, more expensive technologies may be applied, such as in the 

Emalahleni Water Reclamation Plant in South Africa [9].  

 

Adsorption methods are usually applied in environmental engineering because of their good 

selectivity [3] and their production of high-quality water [10]. Well-designed sorption 

processes have high efficiencies, and the treated water can either be recycled or disposed of 

[11]. A fixed-bed column is an effective option for sorption process applications, and the 

successful design of a sorption system requires the prediction of the concentration-time 

breakthrough curve [12].  

 

The use of limestone and other alkaline reagents has proven to be effective in increasing pH 

and thereby removing metals present in mine waters [13] through precipitation and/or 

adsorption [4]. Limestone itself is widely applied as a neutralizer for acid mine drainages 

[14], but its efficiency as a neutralizer is reduced if the mine water is only mildly acidic. The 

armoring effect, which is the precipitation of iron and aluminum oxyhydroxides or calcium 

sulfate on the limestone surface, also contributes to this lower reactivity. Nevertheless, 

because sulfate can be effectively sorbed on limestone (armoring), sorption can be an option 

for lowering the anion concentration, particularly in neutral mine waters. Calcium based 

neutralizing agents precipitate gypsum and thereby decrease sulfate concentrations in mine 

waters [13]. However, because of solubility constraints, residual sulfate concentrations remain 

high, within the 1500-2000 mg.L
-1

 range. In the present work, a different approach is 

proposed where limestone is applied for sulfate sorption, particularly in those mine waters 

with moderate anion concentrations (below 1500 mg.L
-1

) that remain above the discharge 

limit set by environmental agencies. Accordingly, this work was performed to assess the 

principal parameters related to such an approach.

4.2 - Materials and methods  

 

4.2.1 - Calcite limestone and mine waters 

 

A calcite limestone sample assaying 53.7% calcium and 0.28% magnesium was kindly 

provided by Brazilian producers. The sample was dry-sieved using Tyler sieves. Two particle 

size ranges were selected for the experiments. One, with a particle size between 0.42 mm and 

0.59 mm (0.774 m
2
.g

-1
 specific surface area), was used in fixed-bed experiments. The other, 

with a particle size&amp;lt;0.045 mm (2.048 m
2
.g

-1
 specific surface area) was selected for batch 

testing in a stirred reactor.  

 

4.2.2 - Batch experiments 

 

Sulfate removal experiments were performed by mixing 1.5 L of mine water at pH 6.5 (initial 

value) containing  588.0 mg.L
-1

 SO4
2-

 with 25 g.L
-1

 limestone in an orbital shaker at 300 min
-1

 

and 23?1
o
C. Both particle size fractions were utilized in these experiments. Samples were 

withdrawn after 5 minutes in the first half hour and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 hours. At the end 

of the experiment, both the pulp pH and Eh were measured, the slurry was filtered and the 

sulfate concentration in the aqueous phase was determined. Unless otherwise stated, sulfate 

(and metal) concentrations in the aqueous phase were determined by ICP-OES (Varian 725), 

whereas the anion content on the solid phase was calculated by mass balance. 

 

A pseudo-adsorption isotherm was produced from batch data using synthetic sulfate solutions 

so that the maximum limestone loading could be assessed. The procedure consisted of 

shaking (at 300 min
-1

) limestone particles (0.42-0.59 mm) added to 250 mL erlenmeyer flasks 



 77  

 

 

containing 120 mL of sulfate solutions. The anion concentration varied from 50.0 to 

3000.0 g.L
-1

 (pH 9.6-9.8). The pulp contained 25.0 g.L
-1

 solids, and the experiments were run 

for 9 hours. Afterward, the sorption process was modeled according to the Freundlich and 

Langmuir equations.  

 

4.2.3 - Continuous experiments 

 

Continuous experiments were carried out in a stirred reactor with a 1.67 L capacity at 23?1
o
C. 

The reactor was fed separately with (i) 588.0 mg.L
-1

 SO4
2-

 mine water with a pH of 6.5 and 

(ii) a pulp made of limestone (25.0 g.L
-1

) with a particle size&amp;lt;0.045 mm and distilled water. 

The stirring rate was set at 1200 min
-1

, and pumping was provided by two peristaltic pumps 

(Milan 628), one feeding the mine water at 4.0 mL.min
-1 

and the other feeding the limestone 

pulp (at the same flow rate) to the reactor. The residence time was set at 210 minutes, and the 

experiments ran for at least 9 residence time periods to ensure steady-state conditions. After 

every 210 minutes, an aliquot was withdrawn from the reactor and filtered, and both the pH 

and sulfate content were measured. Prior to and during the experiments, the mine water was 

stored in plastic containers at room temperature. 

 

4.2.4 - Fixed-bed experiments 

 

In the fixed-bed experiments, limestone particles (91.92 g, 86.94 g, 81.10 g and 52.85 g) with 

an average diameter of 505 µm were transferred to a glass column (20 mm diameter) to 

produce different bed lengths (Z): 250, 200, 150 and 100 mm. After loading, distilled water 

was passed through the column (60 min) to remove any fine particles that may have been 

loaded in the column. The column was fed upward by peristaltic pumps so that any 



 78  

 

 

preferential pathway for the solution would be avoided, and the flow rate (Q) was varied 

between 1 and 10 mL.min
-1

. Samples were collected regularly from the column effluent. The 

sulfate concentration in these samples was analyzed by ICP-OES (Varian, 725). Sulfate 

loading on limestone was determined by mass balance.   

 

4.2.5 - Infrared analysis and scanning electron microscopy 

 

Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) measurements were carried out by transmission (KBr 

pellet) method using a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer from the ThermoElectron 

Corporation that was equipped with a DLaTGS (deuterated lanthanum triglycine sulfate) 

detector and sealed CsI optics. The samples were mixed with KBr and mounted under the 

spectrometer apparatus. FT-IR spectra were recorded in the transmittance mode in the 400-

4000 cm
-1 

region, with a minimum of 32 scans at a 4 cm
-1 

resolution. Automatic atmospheric 

suppression was applied during collection of the spectra. 

 

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the morphology of limestone 

particles before and after sulfate sorption. The samples were observed in a low vacuum 

scanning electron microscope, Inspect S50 (FEI) equipped with the software Esprit 1.9 – 

QUANTAX 200. The samples were mounted in an epoxy resin, before observation at 15kV 

voltage. An energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy system (EDS) was utilized for elemental 

mapping.      

 

 

 



 79  

 

 

4.3 - Kinetics modeling 

 

Sulfate sorption on limestone in the fixed-bed experiments was modeled by applying the 

following models: (i) Bohart-Adams, (ii) Thomas, (iii) Yoon and Nelson and (iv) Dose-

response. These models have been reviewed [12,15,16], and their corresponding equations are 

listed in Table 4.1.

The Bohart-Adams equation assumes that the sorption rate is controlled by the surface 

reaction, which is proportional to both the sorbent residual capacity and the sorbate 

concentration. This equation is applied in the development of the BDST model [17]. The 

Thomas model assumes that the sorption isotherm can be described by the Langmuir equation 

and the plug flow behavior in the bed. The model also assumes that the sorption kinetics are 



 80  

 

 

described by the second-order reversible reaction. Therefore, this model is suitable for 

sorption processes that are not controlled by film or surface diffusion. The main assumption 

of the Yoon and Nelson equation is that the rate of decrease in the sorption probability of each 

molecule is proportional to the probability of sorbate sorption and that of sorbate 

breakthrough [18]. The modified Dose-response model is an empirical equation proposed by 

Yan et al. [12] to model fixed-bed biosorption, which was later applied to zinc [19] and 

chromium sorption [18].  

 

4.4 - Results and discussion 

 

In this work, two approaches were applied to study sulfate sorption on limestone: (i) stirred-

tank experiments utilizing fine powdered (&lt;0.045 mm) limestone and (ii) sulfate removal in 

fixed-bed columns with a coarser limestone particle size (0.42-0.59 mm). The experiments 

were performed with neutral mine water (pH 6.5) samples, assaying 588.0 - 1100 mg.L

sulfate (Table 4.2).

4.4.1 - Removal in stirred tanks 

 

Preliminary experiments were carried out to compare limestone performance during sulfate 

sorption from either mine waters or synthetic solutions, and no significant difference was 

observed in the obtained results (data not shown). Therefore, only experiments performed 

with mine waters are reported here.  

 

Initially, batch experiments using sulfate-containing mine waters were carried out to define 

the mass of powdered limestone (particle size&amp;lt;0.045 mm) required for the anion removal, 

and 25.0 g.L
-1

 was selected for further experiments. This value enabled the sulfate 

concentration to be reduced from 588 mg.L
-1

 to 162.6 mg.L
-1

 within 210 minutes (Figure 4.1), 

while the pH increased from 6.5 to 8.2. This time span was set as the residence time in the 

subsequent continuous experiments because it produced sulfate concentrations below 

250 mg.L
-1

 (the maximum discharge value allowable by the environmental regulations of 

many mining countries).  

 

The sulfate concentration leveled out at 91 mg.L
-1

 within 360 min at the same pH value, 

which represents a loading of 20 mg SO4

limestone. The overall removal kinetics could

 (r

(k = 3.3x10

ion exchange resin), a maximum loading of 10 g.L

resin was observed [7], whereas an 

uptake of 4.5 mg.g

 (at pH 4.0) was observed during sulfate loading on coconut coir pitch 

[20]. Similarly, Guimarães and Leão reported 41 g.L
-1 

resin loading on the polyacrylic resin 

Amberlite IRA 458 at pH 2 [21]. Therefore, the limestone shows sulfate uptakes between the

ion exchange resins and biological materials. Given limestone’s low price, it could be a cost 

effective alternative for sulfate removal from mine waters.

An alternative to stirred reactors is fixed-bed columns, which require a coarser limestone 

particle size fraction. Therefore, a 0.42-0.59 mm particle size range was utilized in the fixed 

bed experiments.  

 

4.4.2 - Fixed-bed sorption 

 

Prior to the fixed-bed experiments, a pseudo-sorption isotherm was produced so that the 

maximum sulfate sorption capacity could be determined (Figure 4.3). Sulfate sorption on 

limestone was described by the Freundlich (r

 = 0.99) isotherm, and a maximum sulfate 

loading of 23.7 mg SO4

During sulfate removal from industrial wastewater by the anion exchange resin Lewatit 

K6362, the data were better fitted to the Freundlich than to the Langmuir isotherm [7]. 

Similarly, Bazer-Bachi et al. [22] investigated sulfate sorption on soil samples and observed 

that the Langmuir model produced a maximum loading value of 90.2 mg.kg
-1

. Likewise, rice 

straw, a lignocellulosic agricultural residue, was chemically converted into a strong basic 

anion exchanger and applied for sulfate removal, showing 74.4 mg.g

 as the maximum 

adsorption capacity (Langmuir isotherm), in contrast to that of raw straw (11.7 mg.g

) 

[3].Fixed-bed testing was applied to sulfate removal from three different mine water sample

. The effects of bed height (Z),

assessed. Table 4.3 depicts the most important experimental parameters of the breakthrough 

curves presented in Figure 4.4. The breakthrough point was defined as 0.1 of C0, while the 

saturation point was taken as 0.9 of C0. Figures 4.4(a) to 4.4(d) show the effect of different

concentration, tb, increased with increasing bed depth (Table 4.3). In addition, for the two 

higher bed depths, 20 cm (Figure 4.4c) and 25 cm (Figure 4.4d), the steepness of the curves 

changed and were more gradual than those achieved for the two smaller bed lengths. These 

effects are more pronounced for the highest flow rate (10 cm.min
-1

), which might be ascribed 

to increased flow resistance at longer bed depths [16].

As expected, both breakthrough time (service time) and te (saturation time) decreased at larger 

flow rates because of a decrease in the empty bed contact time (EBCT) because, at higher 

flow rates, the sorption front reaches the top of the column earlier [15]. Nevertheless, the 

breakthrough and saturation volumes increased with flow rate, along with the number of bed 

volumes treated at breakthrough, Nb (Table 4.3), at the same bed depth.  

 

The breakthrough and saturation times were also reduced when the initial sulfate 

concentration was increased from 588 to 1100 mg.L
-1

 (at a 25 cm bed depth). For instance, at 

800.1 and 1100.1 mg.L
-1

, the breakthrough time was reduced to 98.0 and 77.3 min, 

respectively. This result can be ascribed to the faster exhaustion of sorption sites, i.e., because 

the total number of sites available for sorption was limited, an increase in the initial 

concentration resulted in a decrease in sulfate sorption [16]. 

 

 

The Empty Bed Contact Time (EBCT), equation 4.1 and the adsorbent usage rate (AUR), 

defined as the weight of sorbent saturated per volume of treated solution (equation 4.2), are 

also given in Table 4.3.

The EBCT affects the volume to breakthrough and the shape of the breakthrough curve, as 

previously discussed. From Figure 4.5, it can be seen that for the 15 to 25 cm bed lengths, the 

sorbent usage rate decreases with increasing EBCT, as was also observed by Srivastava et al.

al. [23], represents between 50 % and 70 % of the bed depth.

4.4.3 - Breakthrough modeling 

Sulfate sorption on calcite limestone was modeled by applying the equations depicted in 

Table 4.2, namely: (i) Bohart-Adams; (ii) Thomas; (iii) Yoon and Nelson; and (iv) Dose-

Response [16,18].   

 

From the Bohart-Adams equation (Table 4.2), the Bed Depth Service Time (BDST) model is 

developed when that equation is linearized to produce:

Equation 4.4 shows that the sorptive capacity of the bed (N0) is directly proportional to its 

height (Z) at 50% breakthrough. Thus, N0 can be calculated from the slope (the right hand 

side of equation 4.4 in a plot of t0.5 versus Z. It is implicit in equation 4.4 that the bed sorption 

capacity is independent of the column height. Figure 4.6 shows the BDST plot for sulfate 

sorption on limestone for bed heights varying from 10 to 25 cm at both 10% and 50% 

breakthroughs and for four different flow rates (1 to 10 mL.min
-1

).

The bed sorption capacity (N0) was calculated from the slopes of both the 10% and 50% 

breakthrough plots, and the results are shown in Table 4.4. It can be observed that the sulfate 

loading on limestone beds increases with flow rate until reaching 20.5 g.L
-1 

bed (at 

10 cm.min
-1

), which is close to the maximum loading (23.7 mg.g
-1

) indicated by the Langmuir 

equation (Figure 4.3).  

 

The sorption rate constant can be determined from the 10% breakthrough plot, and equation 

4.3 predicts that the intercept should be a negative value. As shown in Table 4.4, the 

intercepts at both 1 and 2 mL.min
-1

 are positive, which is a violation of the BDST theory. 

Therefore, the rate constant was not determined for such flow rate values. Nevertheless, the 

flow rate value of 3 mL.min
-1

 seems to provide faster limestone sorption on limestone (k = 

1.056x10
-3 

L.(g.min)
-1

) compared with the experiments carried out with a 10 mL.min
-1

 flow 

rate (k = 1.12x10
-4 

L.(g.min)
-1

). Furthermore, as predicted by equation 4, the plot of t0.5 versus 

Z should be a straight line passing through the origin. However, Figure 4.6 shows that the 

linear plot does not demonstrate such behavior, which indicates that the sulfate sorption on 

limestone is a complex phenomenon that likely involves more than one rate limiting step, as 

will be discussed further in this work [16]. Comparing the intercepts at 10% breakthrough, it 

can be observed that this parameter is reduced (from +44.8 to 33.4) for increasing flow rates. 

This result suggests that the mass transfer resistance in the solid phase is not predominant; 

otherwise, the observed intercept values would not be significantly affected by changes in the 

flow rate, as discussed by Cooney [24]. This scenario may likely be a result of the low surface 

area of the limestone particles, which do not present significant porosity. The BDST theory 

also predicts (equation 4.4) that the service time at different flow rates should increase 

linearly with the inverse of the axial velocity (U). However, this correlation is not followed in 



 92  

 

 

the present work because the slope at 50% breakthrough actually increased with the flow rate 

(from 2 to 10 mL.min
-1

), as shown in Table 4.4.

In addition to the BDST model, 3 different equations were applied to model the breakthrough 

curves produced during sulfate sorption on calcite limestone: (i) Thomas, (ii) Yoon and 

Nelson and (iii) Dose-response [16,18]. Figures 4.7-4.9 present the experimental data points 

and theoretical breakthrough curves for the experiments performed with the 588 mg.L
-1

 mine 

water. In addition, Tables 4.4 and 4.6 depict the values achieved by fitting such equations to 

the experimental data. For experiments with the three mine water samples (588.0 mg.L
-1

 -

1100.1 mg.L
-1

), all equations produced good correlation coefficients between the models and 

the experimental data (r
2
=0.99).  

 



 93  

 

 

Applying the Thomas model to the experimental data, the values of the kinetic constant (kT) 

and the limestone sorption capacity (q0) were determined, as shown in Table 4.5. The 

breakthrough curves are shown in Figure 4.7. It can be observed in Table 4.5 that the values 

of the sorption capacities increased with increasing flow rates (Q).

The sulfate loading values were below 2.0 mg SO4

, but they 

increased to at least to 8.7 mg SO4
2-

 limestone when the flow rate was set at 10 mL.min

. 

These results agree with other research studies involving different solute-sorbent systems 

[15,18,25].  Therefore, an increase in flow rate causes a decrease in the film resistance and a 

positive effect on mass transfer [10]. This relationship is highlighted in the analysis of the rate 

constant, i.e., higher flow rates resulted in larger k values, which implies that the sorption 

process is mainly controlled by film diffusion. Film diffusion varies with flow rate, but 

surface diffusion does not; surface diffusion is independent of fluid flow, as mentioned in 

[24,26].

At 10 mL.min
-1

, the effect of the bed depth on the rate constant becomes stronger compared 

with the shorter bed lengths. It can be observed that up to a 3 mL.min
-1

 flow rate, the rate 

constant, k, is approximately 20% a 25% higher for the 10 cm bed depth compared with the 

25 cm bed depth. Nevertheless, at 10 cm.min
-1

, the rate constant achieved for the lower bed 

depth is 2.5 times the value determined for the 25 cm bed length (Table 4.5), a result of 

increased flow resistance at larger bed depths. At higher concentrations (800.1 and 

1100.1 mg.L
-1

), there is also an increase in the rate constant, which means improved mass 

transfer in the liquid film [26].

Table 4.6 indicates that the determined t0.5 values are similar to the experimental values, as 

also observed in other studies [16,18]. The rate constant (kyN) along with the Thomas rate 

constant (kT) are affected by flow rate only for the 10 and 15 cm bed depths, which highlights 

the increased flow resistance for longer bed depths.

By applying the Dose-response model to the experimental data (Table 4.6) e Figure 4.9, it can 

be seen that the sulfate loadings on the limestone particles, q0, were similar to those 

determined by the Thomas model and that they increased with flow rate at the same bed 

depth. 

 

Conversely, limestone loading was not particularly affected by bed depth (at the same flow 

rate), excluding the experiment carried out with the 10 mL.min
-1

 flow rate, in which limestone 

loading increased with bed depth. Such a result is likely due to a larger contact time between 

the sulfate-containing mine water and the limestone particles.

The Bohart-Adams model assumes a rectangular isotherm [24], which is an approximation of 

the actual isotherm depicted in Figure 4.3. In addition, the straight line describing service time 

versus bed depth does not pass through the origin, which indicates that the sorption process is 

complex. Chemical reactions, which are not thought to control the sorption process kinetics, 

may play an important role in the sulfate sorption on limestone.  

 

The sorption mechanism was analyzed by Infrared spectroscopy, and the Figure 4.10 shows 

an infrared spectrum for the limestone particles after sulfate uptake in stirred tank experiments 

(Figure 4.2). Also shown are the spectra of both pure limestone and di-hydrate calcium 

sulfate. The sulfate ions show fundamental vibrations due to symmetric (at 981 cm
-1

) and 

asymmetric (1104 cm
-1

)
 
stretching vibrations. Symmetric and asymmetric bending vibrations 

are observed at 451 and 613 cm
-1

, respectively. In the range of 400-800 cm
-1

, CaSO4.2H2O 

shows a doublet at 668 cm
-1

 and 603 cm
-1

 due to ?4(SO4
2
) bending vibrations [27]. Pure 

limestone shows a strong C=O IR shift at 712 cm
-1

 [28]. The spectrum of the sulfate-loaded 

limestone shows a peak at 668 cm
-1

, which suggests the presence of sulfate ions on the 

limestone surface, but the absence of the 603 cm
-1

 band indicates that a different calcium 

sulfate compound has actually formed. Nevertheless, this observation requires further 

investigation. Another important outcome observed in Figure 4.10 is the peak at 725 cm
-1

, 

which can be ascribed to the presence of manganese carbonate on the limestone surface. As 

shown in Table 4.1, this mine water contains 30-45 mg.L
-1

 manganese, which has been shown 

to sorb on limestone as manganese carbonate [8].

mine water in fixed bed experiments. Figure 4.11b and 4.11c shows, respectively, oxygen and 

calcium mapping confirming the nature of limestone particles. A composed image (Figure 

4.11e) showing limestone particles and sulfur mapping (red) suggests sorption as the only 

removal mechanism. Bulk calcium sulfate precipitation, which might have occurred from 

limestone dissolution (which is observed when acid water is treated with the latter) did not 

seem to be important herein because the studied mine water is neutral (pH 6.5). This is 

supported by the results on Table 4.2 that show low calcium dissolution during sulfate 

removal.     

 



 100  

 

 

An analysis of some of the chemical species present in the three studied mine water samples 

(Table 4.2) suggests that these species were removed during treatment with limestone. 

Manganese is a major toxic element in this mine water, and it cannot be completely removed 

by limestone, although soluble carbonate sources would improve its precipitation. 

Nevertheless, the manganese concentration was reduced in the best case to 1.5 mg.L
-1

, which 

implies that the mine water would require further treatment for its removal before discharge. 

Minor toxic metals, such as copper and zinc, were also removed.

Sorption (either precipitation or adsorption) on the limestone surface is the mechanism 

accounting for such removal [29]. The findings of the present work suggest that surface 

reaction is part of the sorption mechanism. The second order kinetics observed in the batch 

studies; the good fitting to the Langmuir isotherm along with the infra-red results support 

sulfate chemisorption on limestone. From the hypothesis of each tested model for fixed bed 

sorption, the Thomas model appears to be the most suitable for describing the breakthrough 

curves.     

 

The main species in the mine water, sulfate, was removed to leave concentrations that comply 

with environmental regulations, as discussed in this work. In those mine waters with high 

sulfate concentrations, lime precipitation still seems to be the best choice because of its high 

efficiency in reducing sulfate concentrations to the 1500-2000 mg.L
-1

 range. However, if the 

sulfate concentration in the mine water is below this range (as in the three mine water samples 

currently studied), and the lime precipitation is not effective, limestone sorption could be a 

cost-effective alternative compared with other sulfate removal techniques, such as ettringite 

precipitation and membrane or ion exchange technologies. The removal efficiency of 

limestone can be increased if a fine powder material is applied in stirred tanks, as has been 

shown. This technology would be particularly suitable for those countries where water is 

widely available and where mine water treatment costs must remain as low as possible 

because there is no possibility to commercialize the treated water. 

 

 4.5 - Conclusions 

 

This work showed that limestone can be a cost-effective alternative to treating mine waters 

with sulfate concentrations (1500 and 2000 mg.L
- 1

) below the values defined by gypsum 



 103  

 

 

solubility and where only more expensive processes are available. Sulfate sorption on 

limestone can be described by the Langmuir isotherm, which showed a maximum uptake of 

23.7 mg.g
-1 

limestone. Fine powdered limestone (&lt;0.045 mm) can be applied to treat 

moderate sulfate concentrations (588 mg.L
-1

) in stirred reactors, whereby sulfate 

concentrations can be lowered to below 100 mg.L
-1

. Alternatively, fixed-bed experiments can 

be utilized to produce sulfate uptakes as high as 20 g.L
-1 

bed, while the sorption process can 

be described by simple models, such as the Thomas, Yoon and Nelson and Dose-response 

equations. The BDST model can be applied for design purposes, whereas the process seems to 

be mostly film diffusion controlled because the flow rate has important effects on the fixed 

bed sorption.

5.1 - Considerações Finais 

 

 

Os resultados dos ensaios efetuados no presente estudo mostraram que, em altas 

concentrações de manganês, 140,0 mg.L
-1

, o calcário, sozinho, não é efetivo na remoção do 

íon. Entretanto, a remoção pode ser conseguida pela adição de fontes solúveis de carbonatos 

como o carbonato de sódio. Nesse caso, o mecanismo que contribuiu para a remoção do metal 

em solução é a precipitação, no qual o precipitante utilizado é o íon carbonato solúvel. Essa 

afirmação foi corroborada pelas análises dos resíduos sólidos caracterizados no FTIR e no 

MEV, que demonstraram a formação do precipitado de carbonato de manganês. 

 

O calcário pode ser aplicado para adsorção do manganês nas águas de mina para baixa 

concentração do elemento, e o equilíbrio da adsorção pode ser descrito pelas equações de 

Freundlich ou de Langmuir, sendo o carregamento máximo alcançado de 0,91 mg Mn.g

calcário. Os modelos de Thomas, de Yoon e Nelson e de Dose- response descreveram o 

comportamento da adsorção em coluna. O potencial zeta sugeriu uma adsorção específica do 

manganês na superfície do calcário, o que foi confirmada pela espectrofotometria no 

infravermelho (FTIR) que mostrou a presença de carbonato do manganês na superfície do 

mesmo, ou seja, ocorreu a adsorção química do manganês na superfície do calcário. Em 

coluna de leito fixo, o carregamento do metal foi baixo e aumentou com a vazão (1,0 para 

3,0 mL.min
-1

) para a água de mina com baixa concentração de manganês (1,5 mg.L
-1

), mas 

diminuiu quando a concentração do metal na solução aumentou (1,5 para 15,0 mg.L
-1

). 

Durante experimento na coluna de leito fixo, o carregamento máximo (0,057 mgMn.mL

leito) foi observado para 15,0 mgMn.L
-1

 com uma vazão de 1 mL.min
-1

. O modelo BDST 

confirmou o baixo carregamento do manganês, mas alternativamente, observou-se que o 

manganês pode ser removido de água de mina em reatores agitados.   

 

Este trabalho mostrou que o calcário pode ser adsorvente promissor e uma alternativa de 

baixo custo para tratar água de mina da indústria minero-metalúrgica com as concentrações do 

sulfato abaixo dos valores definidos pela solubilidade da gipsita (1500-2000 mg.L
-1

). A 

adsorção do sulfato no calcário pode ser descrito pela isoterma de Langmuir, que mostrou um 

carregamento máximo de 23,7 mgMn.g
-1

 calcário. O calcário fino (&lt;0,045 mm) pode ser 

aplicado para tratar as concentrações moderadas do sulfato (588,0 mg.L
-1

) em reatores 

agitados, e por meio deste, as concentrações do sulfato podem ser reduzidas para valores 

abaixo dos definidos pela legislação pertinente. Alternativamente, a adsorção em coluna de 

leito fixo pode ser utilizada para produzir os carregamentos do sulfato de até 20 mgSO4

leito. O processo de adsorção pode ser descrito por modelos como o de Thomas, de Yoon e 

Nelson e de Dose-response.

6.1 - Contribuições ao Conhecimento 

 

O trabalho modelou, pela primeira vez, o uso de calcário, como adsorvente, para a remoção 

do sulfato de água de mina de uma indústria minero-metalúrgica com concentrações de 600,0 

a 1100 mg.L
-1

 e determinou os parâmetros de adsorção em colunas de leito fixo. Neste 

sistema, com a partícula de calcário na faixa granulométrica entre 0,42-0,59 mm, o 

carregamento foi de 20 mgSO4

 leito.    

 

Os estudos com água de mina contendo altas concentrações de manganês (140,0 mg.L
-1

) são 

pouco abordados na literatura internacional, e esta é uma demanda da indústria nacional com 

a qual este trabalho contribuiu. Observou-se que para altas concentrações do elemento, o uso 

do carbonato de sódio como agente precipitante é uma opção para a remoção do elemento em 

sistema contínuo. A adsorção ocorre para baixas concentrações do manganês em solução, 

15,0 mg.L
-1

 e o carregamento máximo alcançado foi de  0,057 mgMn.mL
-1

 de leito. 

 

Bamforth et al. [14] propôs que carbonato de manganês não é formado quando calcário é 

utilizado com o adsorvente para baixas concentrações de manganês contido em águas de 

mina. No presente trabalho, entretanto, foi confirmado por diferentes técnicas a formação de 

carbonato de manganês, na superfície do calcário.

7.1 - Sugestões para o trabalho futuro 

 

 

? Estudar outros sistemas de adsorção (resinas, zeólitas) para a remoção do manganês e 

comparar os desempenho obtido com aquele apresentado pelo calcário. 

? Usar o calcário com o tamanho de partícula menor (&lt;0,42 mm), para conseguir um 

melhor carregamento dos metais/ânions presentes em água de mina. 

? Caracterizar o resíduo após o ensaio com água de mina contendo sulfato a fim de 

identificar o sulfato de cálcio (CaSO4) que foi formado.
