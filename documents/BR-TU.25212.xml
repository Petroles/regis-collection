ABSTRACT

Principal component analysis is applied to 309 groundwater chemical data information from wells in the Serra Geral

Aquifer System. Correlations among seven hydrochemical parameters are statistically examined. A four-component

model is suggested and explains 81% of total variance. Component 1 represents calcium-magnesium bicarbonated

groundwaters with long time of residence. Component 2 represents sulfated and chlorinated calcium and sodium

groundwaters; Component 3 represents sodium bicarbonated groundwaters; and Component 4 is characterized by

sodium sulfated with high fluoride facies. The components’ spatial distribution shows high fluoride concentration

along analyzed tectonic fault system and aligned on northeast direction in other areas, suggesting other hydrogeological

fault systems. High fluoride concentration increases according to groundwater pumping depth. The Principal Com-

ponent Analysis reveals features of the groundwater mixture and individualizes water facies. In this scenery, it can be

determined hydrogeological blocks associated with tectonic fault system here introduced.

Key words: fractured aquifer, geostatistics, GIS, groundwater, hydrogeology.

INTRODUCTION

Water scarcity and increasing human consumption re-
quires new sources of water with adequate potability.
Therefore, an emergent necessity to understand ground-
water resources is evident. Low cost treatment and tech-
nical advances in exploration turns groundwater into a
vital and precious natural resource.

Fluoride content in water, like other chemical spe-
cies, is beneficial to human health but can be toxic when

in excess. High fluoride contents in groundwater are
responsible for human and animal health problems caus-
ing dental and skeletal fluorosis, which is detected world-
wide, like in China (Lin et al. 2004, Genxu and Guodong
2001), India (Kumar et al. 2001), Kenya (Moturi et al.
2002), and Israel (Kafri et al. 1989), among other coun-
tries. In the Rio Grande do Sul State, southern Brazil,
the endemic fluorosis has been detected in several dis-
tricts (e.g. Venancio Aires, Santa Cruz do Sul, Pantano
Grande, General Camara). It is accepted that fluoride
anomalies in groundwater could be related to anthro-

pogenic contamination (fertilizer application, brick and
aluminum smelters, sewage piles and other sources) or
to a natural origin, such as prolonged water-rock inter-
actions (Nordstrom et al. 1989). The drinking water
limit recommended by the World Health Organization
for fluoride is 1.5 mg/L (WHO 2002), and in a moderate
concentration (0.7-1.2 mg/L) prevents dental cavities.

The main aim of the current study is to understand
the distribution of high-fluoride waters in the Serra Geral
Aquifer System (SGAS) and to identify the hydrochemi-
cal types and their spatial distribution, using the Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is an important tool
for understanding the large quantity of data involved in
extended aquifer studies (Invernizzi and Oliveira 2004).
This aids to define geological sources and pathways for
high fluoride, consequently, assisting future well loca-
tions and management of SGAS waters. Investigations
about the source of high fluoride concentrations in
previous studies had shown a relationship with tectonic
structures and with pumping of deep groundwater.

GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY OF THE STUDY AREA

The study area is located in the Rio Grande do Sul State,
southern Brazil and extends from 27?S to 31?S and
from 50?W to 57?W, corresponding approximately to
164.207 km2 in the Parana Basin. The region is covered
by a basaltic to rhyolitic Mesozoic volcanic sequence
belonging to the Serra Geral Formation (SGF), whose
thickness varies from 50 to 1000 meters (average of 550
meters), constituting a fractured aquifer that provides
public water supply to more than 80% of the cities in
the area.

SGAS hydrochemical characteristics indicate the
influence of water mixing with other sedimentary aquifer
belonging to the Parana Basin (Szikszay et al. 1981,
Fraga 1992, Portela Filho et al. 2002, 2004). This
aquifer is directly superimposed by the Guarany Aquifer
System/GAS (Campos 2000) that has been the focus of
several studies in the last few years, due to its spatial
extent and storage potentiality as a transnational aquifer.

Tectonic structures cut the SGF controlling terrain
surface and hydrochemical characteristics of the related
aquifer. These structures are connected to the South
Atlantic Ocean opening, causing NE and NW dominant
directions (Fig. 1). The main fault systems define sectors

that may be considered as hydrogeological blocks (Lis-
boa 1996, Lisboa and Menegotto 1997, Machado 2005).
The tectonic block limited by the Terra de Areia-Posadas
Fault System and Mata-Jaguari Fault System is uplifted
in the south-central area. The adjacent block to the north
shows a gradual terrain lowering from east to west, con-
ditioned by NE normal faults, parallel to the Leao and
Perimpo fault systems.

The identification of different water facies for SGAS
focused on tectonic block separations is important to
define structures where high fluoride groundwater can
ascend from deep levels to SGAS. This tectonic control
for the high fluoride groundwaters has been reported in
other regions (Licht 2001). In the study area the SGAS
fluoride average concentrations are around 0.24 mg/L,
with a minimum value of 0.02 mg/L, and the highest
at 3.03 mg/L. Machado (2005) describes the influence of
Ca2+HCO?3 meteoric recharge on the SGAS and mixture
mechanisms between the SGAS and the GAS inputing
Na+HCO?3 with SO

MATERIALS AND METHODS

HYDROCHEMICAL DATA

Hydrogeological data represent a network of 309 deep
wells (Fig. 1) that exposes only SGAS groundwater used
in public and private water supply. All data informa-
tion was provided by governmental groundwater man-
agement agencies.

This study regarded only seven major parameters
to evaluate hydrochemical facies in the piper diagram,
namely fluoride, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO?3 , SO

2?
4

and Cl?.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

The PCA was performed using SPSS version 8 soft-
ware (Nie et al. 1975) and tested for two, three and four
principal components using the eigenvalue equal to 1 cri-
terion (Kaiser 1958). Before this procedure, outlier sup-
pression was carried out through boxplots and dispersion
charts for all variables. The Varimax orthogonal rotation
was used (Kaiser 1958), in order to facilitate Factor Anal-
ysis interpretation (Invernizzi and Oliveira 2004). Princi-
pal component scores performed in the Cluster Analysis
(K-Means Method) allow to group wells into homoge-
neous clusters.

Areia-Posadas, (3) Perimpo, and (4) Leao.

SPATIAL ANALYSIS

Spatial distribution and interpretation of principal com-
ponents defined by PCA was performed on Geograph-
ical Information System (GIS) with Quantum GIS ver-
sion 0.7.4 software (Sherman et al. 2005). Cluster results
were classified, considering the most important chemical
parameter as an identification name.

The relationship between depth and fluoride con-
centration considers the maximum absolute groundwater
pumping depth in each well. This procedure was carried
out with Labplot version 1.5 software (Gerlach 2004)
in order to investigate whether fluoride concentration in
SGAS increases with depth.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS

Table I presents the correlation coefficient matrix for
hydrochemical data in SGAS.

The solution using the eigenvalue criterion results in
four components that explain 81% of the total variance.
Component 4 is highly weighted by fluoride (Table II).

Component 1 is mainly influenced by HCO?3 ,
Ca2+, and Mg2+, and explains 37.43% of the total vari-
ance, representing calcium-magnesium bicarbonate
groundwaters with long residence time, evidenced by
Mg2+. Component 2 is defined by SO2?4 and Cl

?, and
represents sulfated and chlorinated, calcium and sodium
groundwaters.

Component 3 is explained by HCO?3 and Na
+,

defining sodium bicarbonated groundwaters.
Component 4 is defined by F, followed by Na+

and SO2?4 , corresponds to sodium sulfate with high flu-
oride facies.

Fluoride participates with similar intensity on
Components 2 and 3, suggesting two groundwater
sources that contain relatively high fluoride concentra-
tion. Therefore, fluoride was associated with sulfated
and sodium bicarbonated groundwaters.

Based on the above, cluster analysis was performed
and selected a solution with nine clusters, since it showed
the best water facies individualization. Using this crite-
rion the results pointed out a minimum number of wells
with meteoric water facies (212).

The cluster interpretation was based on final center
scores. Thus, each cluster was renamed using related ion
predominance (Table III). In order to facilitate the read-
ing it was decided to designate Component 1 as CaMg,
Component 2 as SO4, Component 3 as Na, and Compo-
nent 4 as F.

It can be defined that clusters 3 and 4 are com-
posed predominantly by F component groundwaters.
Clusters 1 and 7 comprise the CaMg water facies. Clus-
ter 8 is composed by Na component. The remaining
groups show more than one component in high concen-
tration.

In the water facies, components SO4, Na, and F
were added to the main water facies. Therefore, these
clusters were called SO4Na, SO4F, and NaF, due to
their final centroid intensities. This components com-
bination is a result of the interference of different geo-
chemical water sources and/or mixture features.

HYDROCHEMISTRY

The geochemical data were plotted in a piper diagram
(Fig. 2), with the four renamed cluster defined by
the PCA. The majority of wells (212 out of 309 wells)
have a composition related to meteoric waters with
Ca2+HCO?3 nature and do not include high fluoride
waters. In this case, 212 samples are not represented
in the diagrams, in order to obtain a better fit by the
other groups.

The CaMg facies represents a predominant HCO?3
water type where Mg+2 appears in more than 50% of
the wells (Fig. 2).

The Na group shows their typical distribution in
the piper diagram, representing Na+HCO?3 waters.

F distribution in the piper diagram maintains an as-
sociation with sulfated and bicarbonated groundwaters.
These hydrochemical characteristics are also related to

different groundwater sources or point out to mixture
features during groundwater ascending recharge.

SO4Na, SO4F, and NaF facies appear only in
two wells each. Both wells compose distinct groups as
showed in Figure 2.

The spatial distribution of water facies confirms that
fluoride has a relationship with the analyzed fault sys-
tems Mata-Jaguari, Terra de Areia-Posadas, Perimpo,
and Leao (Fig. 3).

Meteoric Waters occurs in all SGAS, but more
significantly in the tectonic block limited by Terra de
Areia-Posadas, Jaguari-Mata and Perimpo Fault Sys-
tems, due to the uplift condition of this block.

The CaMg facies is spatially related to discharge
zones of SGAS in the west, northwest, and southeast
regions, representing waters at the final percolation stage
under long time residence.

The Na facies is dominant in the northwest region,
where SGF achieves the maximum thickness in the study
area, suggesting a hydrogeological tectonic block. This
characteristic indicates that ascendant waters in this re-
gion present only Na+ enrichment, as a result of water-
rock interaction in SGF. Thus, the non-interference of
GAS in this scenery is evident, probably due to the
maximum thickness of SGF.

SO4Na facies appears only in the northeast align-
ment direction of the Uruguay River, showing a close
relationship to this regional alignment. SO4F facies
presents a similar behavior, but occurs only in the east-
west section of the Uruguay River.

NaF facies is spatially linked to the Na hydrogeo-
logical block which has a poor fluoride content. The NaF
with high fluoride appears only in two wells at a similar
distance from the Uruguay River, suggesting a particular

hydrogeological condition.
The F group related that high fluoride groundwaters

are distributed in the central-northeast portion of SGAS.
Aligned wells associated with the main tectonic fault
systems (Terra de Areia-Posadas, Leao and Perimpo)
suggest a water ascension recharge. New tectonic fault
systems are introduced in the present study, correspond-
ing to the linear distribution of wells belonging to F
facies in the central portion of SGAS, which receive
the nomination Fontoura Xavier-Parai and Victor
Graeff-Barracao hydrogeological alignments (Fig. 3).
It must be stressed that the introduced structures are
parallel to Leao and Perimpo Fault Systems.

The distribution of NaF facies is similar to the Na
facies (Fig. 3). Both are chemically very similar and
distinguished by a more intensive fluoride participation
in the NaF facies.

The SO4F and SO4Na facies are scarce and closely
associated with major regional structures that delineate
the Uruguay River (Fig. 3). The SO4F facies occurs in
the north sector while the SO4Na facies occurs prefer-
entially in the west sector of the study area.

The composition of the volcanic rocks belonging
to the SGF does not comprise fluorine rich minerals to
provide anomalous fluoride content in the SGAS. This
enrichment could be better explained by the ascending
groundwater recharge crossing older Parana Basin sed-
imentary sequences combined with long residence time
and extreme confination conditions.

The A-D geological cross-section (Figs. 1 and 4)
demonstrates the east-west gradual terrain lowering, due
to tectonic block accommodation, where hydrogeologi-
cal ascension structures are represented. Near the well
“B” (Fig. 1) the Na block limit is registered.

Fig. 2 – Water facies distribution in the Piper Diagram, showing two fluoride hydrochemical types (I – sulfated; II – bicarbonated).

The depth variation shows fluoride concentration
increase according to groundwater pumping depth
(Fig. 5). It can be demonstrated that beyond F facies,
all the other facies increase the fluoride content with the
depth. This behavior probably is related to the influ-
ence of confined GAS and the proximity of other older
aquifer systems.

CONCLUSIONS

The PCA methodology was efficient to discriminate
hydrochemical water facies in a collection of more than
300 wells located in the SGAS in Rio Grande do Sul
State, southern Brazil, with special emphasis to the fluo-
ride content. As a result a comprehensive spatial model

was achieved, using seven chemical components that
validate six hydrochemical facies were distinguished in
the SGAS, three of them containing substantial fluoride
contents in combination with Na+ and SO2?4 . The spa-
tial distribution of these facies confirms the presence of
hydrogeological blocks limited by tectonic alignments.

Two tectonic structures are apparently present in
the central area, indicated by linear distribution of high
fluoride groundwater wells. An aquifer system status
for SGAS is reaffirmed, considering complex chemical
mixtures, recharge processes and percolation through the
fractured reservoir. The ascending recharge processes
are considered to define ionic enrichment, especially in
Na+, F?, SO2?4 and Cl

?.
