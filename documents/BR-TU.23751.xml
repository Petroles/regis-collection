ABSTRACT: The spatial and temporal variation of soil CO
2
 emission is influenced by several soil

attributes related to CO2 production and its diffusion in the soil. However, few studies aiming to
understand the effect of topography on the variability of CO

2
 emissions exist, especially for cropping

areas of tropical regions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the spatial and temporal changes
of soil CO

2
 emission and its relation to soil attributes in an area currently cropped with sugarcane

under different relief forms and slope positions. Mean CO2 emissions in the studied period (seven
months) varied between 0.23 and 0.71, 0.27 and 0.90, and 0.31 and 0.80 g m–2 h–1 of CO

2 
for concave

(Conc), backslope (BackS) and footslope (FootS) positions, respectively. The temporal variability of
CO

2 
emissions in each area was explained by an exponential relation between the CO

2 
emission and soil

temperature and a linear relation between CO2 emission and soil water content. The Q10 values were
1.98 (± 0.34), 1.81 (± 0.49) and 1.71 (± 0.31) for Conc, BackS and FootS, respectively. Bulk density,
macroporosity, penetration resistance, aggregation and oxidizable organic carbon content explain the
changes in soil CO

2
 emission observed, especially when the Conc position was compared to BackS.

The effect of relief form and topographic position on soil CO2 emission variation was dependent on
the time of measurement.

INTRODUCTION

Soil CO2 emission is an important component
of the global carbon cycle (Raich &amp;amp; Schlesinger,

1992), which is basically controlled by two processes:
CO2 production within the soil and its transport from
the soil into the atmosphere (Fang &amp;amp; Moncrieff, 1999).
Microbial activity and root respiration are the major

sources of CO2 production, and the transport of the
gas is governed by diffusion. These processes, in turn,
are influenced by several attributes that establish the
spatial and temporal variations of soil CO2 emission.
Soil temperature and soil water content, or the inter-
action between both, are the main controlling factors
of the variability of soil respiration (Kang et al., 2003;
Kang et al., 2000). Besides temperature and water, the
spatial variability of soil respiration is also controlled
by organic carbon, microbial biomass, root biomass,
litter, nutrients (N, Mg, Ca, P), pH, cation exchange
capacity, iron oxide content, bulk density and poros-
ity (Epron et al., 2006; Xu &amp;amp; Qi, 2001; La Scala Júnior
et al., 2000; Fang et al., 1998).

Changes in CO2 emissions and soil chemical,
physical and biological properties have been reported
to be related to land exposition and slope length (Kang
et al., 2006; Kang et al., 2003), microtopography (Jia
et al., 2003), slope position (Risch &amp;amp; Frank, 2006;
Hanson et al., 1993), slope angle (Silva et al., 2004)
and relief form (Souza et al., 2006; Souza et al.,
2004a,b,c; Souza et al., 2003). Such topographic as-
pects affect ground and underground water flows,
constituting the major cause of spatial variability of soil
attributes (Daniels &amp;amp; Hammer, 1992).

Nowadays, in the worldwide scenario, Brazil
is the main sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) producer, with
6.96 million cropped hectares. This area represents al-
most 11.5% of the total cropped area with the main
Brazilian agricultural products. São Paulo is the major
sugarcane producer state, with 3.68 million hectares,
corresponding to 52.9% of the total area cropped with
sugarcane in Brazil. Considering that the total area
cropped with sugarcane increases every year, reach-
ing a 13% increase in 2007/2008 in relation to 2006/
2007 (Conab, 2008), studying the spatial and tempo-
ral changes of soil CO2 emission in such agrosystem
is of great interest.

The objective of this work was to identify the
topographic effect on spatial and temporal variations
of soil CO2 emission in an area currently cropped with
sugarcane in the Southeastern region of Brazil, and to
determine the soil attributes that control such varia-
tions.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The experiment was carried out on the Santa
Isabel Farm located at 21º17’ to 21º18’ S and 48º08’
to 48º10’ W, in Jaboticabal, São Paulo state, Brazil,
where sugarcane has been cropped for over 60 years
and mechanically harvested (green) for over the last
ten years. The climate of the region is characterized
by tropical rainy summers and dry winters, being clas-

sified as Aw by Köepen. The average temperature is
24.3ºC and 18.8ºC for January and July, respectively,
while the average year precipitation is around 1425
mm, with total monthly precipitations of 239.5 mm and
25.3 mm for January and July, respectively. The soil
is classified as Typic Eutrustox.

The topography of the area presents two re-
lief forms, one concave occurring in the highest posi-
tion of the landscape, and the other linear, towards the
hillside, as described in Souza et al. (2003). The sam-
plings were performed in a 100 × 100 m limited area
in the concave form (Conc) and in two positions in
the linear form, backslope (BackS) and footslope
(FootS) (Figure 1).

Soil CO2 emission measurements were con-
ducted during 17 days, from April 28 (one month af-
ter sugarcane plantation) to November 23, 2004, with
ten randomized replicates for each area in each sam-
pling day. The evaluations were conducted in the
morning (9–11 h) or in the afternoon (14–16 h), and
in some days with measurements conducted in morn-
ings and afternoons, using a flux chamber (LI-6400-
09 CO2, LI-COR, NE, USA) according to Healy et al.
(1996). The chamber is a closed system with an in-
ternal volume of 991 cm3 and soil exposed area of 71.6
cm2, and coupled to a LI-6400 photosynthesis system
that analyzes the CO2 concentration by infrared gas
absorption. The chamber was placed on the top of
PVC soil collars installed in the field, between rows,
some days before the measurements, eliminating the
CO2 flush out effect due to the ring insertion in soil.

Soil temperature (T) was evaluated by a sen-
sor connected to the chamber on each one of the ten
evaluation points of CO2 emission at a depth of 0–0.15

m on the 17 sampling days. Gravimetric soil water con-
tent (GM) was determined on 11 of the 17 days of
study, in the same replicates and depths (Gardner,
1986).

Soil analysis was made on disturbed and un-
disturbed soil samples, with five replicates in each area.
Soil bulk density was determined on undisturbed soil
cores (0.04 m long and 0.05 m diameter) (Embrapa,
1997). Total porosity (TP) was calculated based on
soil bulk density. Pore size distribution (macroporosity
- Macro; microporosity - Micro) was determined based
on soil water retention using a tension table (Embrapa,
1997).

Aggregate stability (Kemper &amp;amp; Rosenau, 1986)
was determined by sieving in water, with aggregates
that passed through a 7.93-mm sieve and were retained
in a 4.76-mm sieve, and then separated in classes us-
ing a set of sieves of meshes of 4.76 mm, 2 mm, 1
mm, 0.5 mm and 0.25 mm. Results were expressed
in terms of geometric mean diameter (GMD), percent-
age of aggregates larger than 2 mm (? &gt; 2 mm), per-
centage of aggregates  between 2–1 mm (? 2-1 mm)
and percentage of aggregates smaller than 1 mm (?
&lt;1 mm).

The soil sampled with an auger was passed
through a 2-mm sieve to determine particle-size dis-
tribution (pipette and sieving method, after the soil
samples had been dispersed chemically in a 0.1 M
NaOH solution and mechanically in low-rotation agi-
tation for 16 hours, modified by Embrapa (1997)),
Fe2O 3 content (extracted with sulphuric acid)
(Embrapa, 1979) and oxidizable organic carbon con-
tent (CO) (Raij et al., 1987).

Penetration resistance (PR) was measured us-
ing an impact penetrometer (IAA/PLANALSUCAR -
STOLF), according to Stolf (1991), with ten replicates
in each area, down to the depth of 0.15 m. When per-
forming the penetration resistance tests, soil samples
were taken for GM determination, down to the same
depth.

All soil attributes were evaluated by the analy-
sis of variance using the following models for each
set of response variables: (1st) soil CO2 emission, soil
temperature and soil water content: Yij = m + Pi +
Error(a) + Tj + PiTj + Error(b), Yij being the value of
each observation, m the general mean, Pi the effect
of the topographic position i, Error(a) the plot error,
Tj the effect of time j, PiTj the effect of the interac-
tion between topographic position and time, Error(b)
the general error; and (2nd) for other evaluated at-
tributes: Yij = m + Pi + Error(geral), Yij being the value
of each observation, m  the general mean, Pi the ef-
fect of the topographic position i, Error(geral) the gen-
eral error. Tukey’s test was applied for the multiple

comparisons of the means with 10% of probability. All
statistical results were obtained by the SAS/Statistical
Analysis Systems software package (SAS Institute,
1998).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Soil CO2 emission variability
Soil CO2 emission throughout the 7-month pe-

riod in different landscape positions (Figure 2), had
mean values for Conc, BackS and FootS of 0.38, 0.47
and 0.45 g CO2 m

–2 h–1 (Table 1), respectively, and their
variation during this period was above 200%. The
BackS area presented mean emissions values between
0.27 and 0.90 g CO2 m

–2 h–1. This variation is a con-
sequence of the local climate. The lowest emissions
are observed in the winter (June 20 to September 21,
2004, Figure 2), which is characterized by lower pre-
cipitation and temperatures. Campos (2003) reports
smaller values for annual means of soil CO2 emission
in sugarcane areas in both the traditional slash and burn-
ing manual harvesting system (0.13 g CO2 m

–2 h–1) and
the mechanized harvesting without trash burning (0.14
g CO2 m

–2 h–1). Despite these lower values, the author
also found a variation of 200% in CO2 emission (0.07
to 0.21 g CO2 m

–2 h–1) throughout the 11-month cul-
ture cycle.

The great temporal variability in CO2 emission
presented in our study shows the importance of
evaluating emissions in different land conditions and
time scales. Since CO2 emission is affected by a large
number of factors, when extrapolating emissions for
larger areas it is important to take into account its
spatial and temporal controls, like soil temperature,
moisture, texture, litter stocks and topographical po-
sition (Sotta et al., 2006). Indirect estimates based
on the difference in soil organic carbon stocks are

also used for predictions of soil carbon losses.
Changes in soil organic carbon stocks due to land
use in Brazil were estimated using a map of different
s o i l - v e g e t a t i o n  a s s o c i a t i o n s  c o m b i n e d  w i t h
results from a soil database (Bernoux et al., 2001,
2002).

Differences (p &amp;lt;0.1) found in mean soil CO2
emissions on a same day, when topographic positions
were compared, indicate seasonallity dependence (Fig-
ure 2). Hanson et al. (1993) also found differences in
CO2 emission in some evaluations, but not for the
whole period of study, when comparing emissions
from areas in different topographic positions (top, slope
or valley). The topography effect on soil CO2 emis-
sion was observed especially in the first days of the
experiment, when the soil was found almost bare with
no vegetation. The fact that the differences in the emis-
sions between the positions were not maintained dur-
ing the whole experiment is probably related to other
factors, such as the contribution of root respiration with
the development of the root system of the sugarcane,
in agreement with Parkin et al. (2005). According to
these authors, root respiration masked the effect of
topography on soil CO2 emission, since such effect is
greater on maize crops, a grassy crop like sugarcane,
than on soybean crops.

During the first days of the experiment, the
BackS area presented the highest emissions in relation
to those observed in the Conc and FootS areas (p&amp;lt;
0.10) (Figure 2), indicating that soil CO2 emission is
different in relation to topographic positions. Other au-
thors report a significant increase in soil CO2 emission
in the descending direction of the hillside, with higher
emissions in the lower positions of the hillslope when
compared to top positions. This is related to the con-
tribution of erosion, since, in the lowered parts, an in-
crease in soil surface biomass (Risch &amp;amp; Frank, 2006),
thickness and organic matter content of the A horizons
and crop productivity (DeJong, 1981) is observed.
However, the increase in CO2 emission in our study
did not occur in this direction along the hillside. The
soil cover from crop residues has probably provided
greater protection against erosion processes, prevent-
ing soil loss and reduction in surface organic carbon,
since the area in the higher positions presented higher
soil CO2 emission and organic carbon content (Table
1). On the other hand, when comparing Conc with lin-
ear relief forms (BackS and FootS), it was observed
that the relief form did not always determine differ-
ences in CO2 emission at the beginning of the experi-
ment, since on some days no difference was observed
between Conc and FootS emissions.

Soil CO2 emission of sugarcane fields 8 1

Sci. Agric. (Piracicaba, Braz.), v.66, n.1, p.77-83, January/February 2009

Variation in soil attributes
BackS had the lowest soil bulk density, high-

est macroporosity, highest geometric mean particle di-
ameter, highest percentage of aggregates with diam-
eter larger than 2 mm, the smallest percentage of ag-
gregates with diameter between 2 and 1 mm, smallest
percentage of aggregates with diameter smaller that 1
mm, smallest soil penetration resistance and highest
oxidizable organic carbon content when compared with
Conc (p &amp;lt;0.1) (Table 1). Considering the same soil
attributes, the values for FootS were between those
found for the Conc and BackS areas, differing from
BackS in relation to bulk density and from Conc in re-
lation to macroporosity only. These results reinforce
the influence of topographic position and/or relief form
on soil attributes.

The area presenting the smallest bulk density
and penetration resistance and the highest
macroporosity was the one that presented the highest
CO2 emission (BackS) (Table 1 and Figure 2). This
result shows the importance of the soil porous space
for gaseous transport and, consequently, for micro-
bial activity, which is in aggreament with the results
found by Xu &amp;amp; Qi (2001). Higher total porosity fa-
cilitates oxygen entrance into the soil, favoring respi-
ration and, consequently, increasing CO2 emissions
(Fang et al., 1998). Although total porosity values
for Conc, BackS and FootS were similar, the highest
emissions were observed on the sites with
higher macroporosity. This indicates the influence
of pore size distribution on emissions, since soil
gas diffusion, according to Fick’s law:

 (where ECO2 is
the soil CO2 emission, arCOD 2?  the diffusion coefficient
of the gas in the air, (TP – M) the water free porosity,
and (L / Le)2 the tortuosity factor) (Alvenäs &amp;amp; Jansson,
1997), is not only dependent on total porosity (TP),
but also on tortuosity. Thus, macro and micropore dis-
tribution determines the possible trajectories of gases
in the soil, affecting both the entrance of O2 and the
release of CO2.

Differences observed in Fe2O3 and oxidizable
organic carbon content between topographic positions
are coherent with the results obtained for aggregate
stability indexes (GMD,&amp;lt;?2 mm, ?2-1 mm and&amp;lt;1
mm, Table 1), confirming the positive relation between
these attributes and aggregation (Oades, 1984;
Schwertmann &amp;amp; Taylor, 1989). Despite the physical
protection by the organic matter associated with ag-
gregation, the highest CO2 emissions were observed
in BackS, which was probably due to the higher oxi-
dizable organic carbon content of this area. A positive
association between CO2 emissions and soil organic
carbon was also found by Xu &amp;amp; Qi (2001) and La

Scala Júnior et al. (2000). Yoo et al. (2006) reported
higher emissions in relation to higher soil organic car-
bon content available for microbial activity.

CO2 temporal emission and its relationship with
soil temperature and moisture

Soil temperature throughout the period varied
between 17.8 and 30.6ºC, the lowest value being ob-
served in Conc and the highest in FootS. Mean values
for each day varied between 17.9 to 30.2ºC, 18.8 to
29.1ºC and 18.9 to 30.6ºC for Conc, BackS and FootS,
respectively. Comparing the areas, the major differ-
ences of daily mean temperature were observed be-
tween Conc and FootS, being higher in FootS in 9 of
the 17 sampled days (Tukey, p &amp;lt;0.1). The tempera-
tures for BackS did not differ from the other areas in
most of the observations. Considering the data from
the 17 evaluations, the coefficient of variation (CV) for
temperature was 16.43%. Analyzing the data from
each day, this variation is lower, with CV values be-
tween 1.39 and 8.25%, except for one observation
where CV was 13.15%.

The temporal variability of soil CO2 emission
in the different positions was explained by an expo-
nential relation of emission to soil temperature (Fang
&amp;amp; Moncrieff, 2001; Xu &amp;amp; Qi, 2001; Lloyd &amp;amp; Taylor,
1994). Model ECO2 = ae–bTSOIL  (Equation 1) was fit-
ted to a linear relationship, thus obtaining a model of
the type  Ln (ECO2) = a + b TSOIL (Equation 2), which
presented the best adjustment based on the coefficient
of determination of the model (R2) for Conc in rela-
tion to other linearly located areas (Table 2). Tempera-
ture accounted for 24 to 51% of the CO2 emission
changes, which is related to the smaller variation in
soil temperature (CV of 1.39 to 13.15%) in relation to
the variation of CO2 emission (CV of 19.3 to 61.3%).

The estimation of Q10, which represents the
sensitivity of CO2 emission to a 10-degree-celsius in-
crease in soil temperature was calculated by the equa-
tion Q10 = e10b (Equation 3) for each topographic posi-
tion, where b stems from Equation 2 previously pre-
sented. The results obtained for Conc, BackS and
FootS were 1.98 (± 0.34), 1.81 (± 0.49) and 1.71 (±
0.31), respectively, being close to values previously
reported in the literature (Lloyd &amp;amp; Taylor, 1994; Raich
&amp;amp; Schlesinger, 1992). By comparing topographic po-
sitions Conc and BackS, it was observed that Conc
presented a lower Q10 value and better aggregate sta-
bility (Table 1). This result, according to Davidson &amp;amp;
Janssens (2006), may stem from greater physical pro-
tection from soil organic matter and, consequently,
from a reduction in emission sensitivity in relation to
soil temperature in these areas. Nevertheless, when
considering the three topographic positions, it was not

possible to draw any conclusions concerning this re-
lationship between aggregation and Q10, since FootS
presented the lowest Q10 value, and did not differ from
the other areas in relation to aggregation.

Considering the studied period the mean soil
water content varied from 13.2 to 29.7%, 14.6 to
30.5% and 12.6 to 28.5% for Conc, BackS and FootS,
respectively. Soil water contents were affected by the
position in the slope, since the major differences were
observed between BackS and FootS (Tukey, p &amp;lt;0.1).
The CV value for the total period was 28.68%, and
analyzing the variation during each day, the CV varied
from 5.72 to 24.37%.

The temporal variability of CO2 emission could
be explained by a linear relation with soil water con-
tent (E(CO2) = a + b MSOIL) (Equation 4) in Conc and
BackS only (p &amp;lt;0.1) (Table 2). Soil water content ac-
counted for 31 and 43% of the emission variation for
those areas, respectively. The lack of relationship be-
tween soil water content and emissions in FootS sug-
gests that the effect of the soil water content is de-
pendent on the topographic position.

In summary, soil temperature affected the
temporal changes in soil CO2 emission in all areas while
the effect of soil water content was evident only in
Conc and BackS. Other researchers report the effect
of these factors on emission changes. Soil respiration
was dominantly controlled by temperature in a moun-
tain area in China, since the influence of moisture was
observed only when it was a limiting factor (Li et al.,
2007). Reth et al. (2005) also related a relation between
soil moisture and CO2 emission only in the dry period
of the year. Results obtained in the eastern Amazonian
area (Brazil) (Sotta et al., 2006) and in a tropical

rainforest (Asia) (Kosugi et al., 2007) show that the
temporal variability of soil CO2 efflux was depended
mainly on soil water content. Strong effects of soil
temperature and soil water content on CO2 were ob-
served in managed forests in Canada (Peng &amp;amp; Tho-
mas, 2006).
