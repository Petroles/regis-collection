RESUMO 

FERREIRA, P. C. G. Função esplênica e eventos de adesão celular em Anemia 
Falciforme e em Esferocitose Hereditária. 2018. Tese (Doutorado). Faculdade de 
Medicina de Ribeirão Preto, Universidade de São Paulo. 

INTRODUÇÃO: As Anemias Hemolíticas compreendem um grupo de doenças em 
que há redução acentuada na sobrevivência dos glóbulos vermelhos circulantes e a 
medula óssea não é capaz de compensação, mesmo aumentando sua produção, o 
que causa anemia desde os primeiros anos da vida da pessoa. Dentre as doenças 
deste grupo, a Anemia Falciforme (SCA) e a Esferocitose Hereditária (HS) destacam-
se por se tratarem de enfermidades com defeitos genéticos intrínsecos das células 
vermelhas (RBCs) que geram complicações multissistêmicas agudas e crônicas em 
seus portadores. Por vias patofisiológicas distintas, reticulócitos e respectivas 
hemácias defeituosas de tais doenças, falciformes e esferócitos, são continuamente 
aprisionados e fagocitados no baço, importante órgão de destruição de células velhas 
e/ou defeituosas via hemólise extravascular, o que leva progressivamente à disfunção 
e eventual perda da função esplênica. OBJETIVO: Avaliar o papel do baço em 
relação à habilidade e ao fenótipo adesivos de reticulócitos (ret) e eritrócitos (erit) em 
pacientes com SCA e HS, com e sem função esplênica preservada. METODOLOGIA: 
Amostras de sangue de 37 pacientes (22 SCA and 15 HS) com função esplênica e 
19 pacientes (13 SCA e 6 HS) sem ela foram avaliadas. Ainda, sangue de 22 crianças 
com SCA foi coletado em estudo longitudinal dos 6 e 29 meses de vida. Todas as 
amostras de sangue foram analisadas quanto à função esplênica (Contagem de 
células PIT e de corpúsculos de Howell-Jolly - HJB), quanto ao perfil imunofenotípico 
celular (em % e em média de intensidade de fluorescência - MFI) e quanto à 
habilidade de adesão das células vermelhas à laminina e à linhagem celular endotelial 
HMEC-1. RESULTADOS: A análise da transição da perda de função esplênica 
demonstrou que a mesma se intensificou a partir dos 3 anos de idade (PIT: r=0,8; 
p&lt;0,0001; HJB: r=0,7; p&lt;0.0001). Quanto à imunofenotipagem celular, a contagem 
PIT se correlacionou positivamente, principalmente com os marcadores CD147 
(%ret: r=0,6; p&lt;0,0001; MFIret: r=0,6; p&lt;0,0001; %erit: r=0,7; p&lt;0,0001; MFIerit: 
r=0,6; p&lt;0,0001), LuBCAM (%ret: r=0,5; p=0,004; MFIret: r=0,6; p&lt;0,0001; %erit: 
r=0,6; p&lt;0,0003; MFIerit: r=0,4; p&lt;0,004) and CD58 (%ret: r=0,4; p=0,006; MFIret: 
r=0,5; p&lt;0,0013; %erit: r=0,4; p&lt;0,009; MFIerit: r=0,6; p&lt;0,0001). Na comparação 
imunofenotípica entre ausência ou presença do baço, a perda de sua função exerceu 
influência no aumento da expressão de adesão de RBCs em SCA, principalmente 
CD147 (%ret: p=0,002; MFIret: p=0,003; %erit: p&lt;0,0001; MFIerit: p=0,005), 
LuBCAM (%ret: p=0,0001; MFIret: p&lt;0,0001; %erit: p&lt;0,0001; MFIerit: p&lt;0,0001) e 
CD58 (%ret: p=0,007; MFIret: p=0,006; %erit: p=0,003; MFIerit: p=0,0004), embora 
a adesão celular tenha diminuído em pacientes HS esplenectomizados. Na 
comparação entre as doenças, pacientes HS com o baço apresentaram maior 
freqüência de adesão celular em relação aos SCA, notavelmente em relação ao 
LuBCAM (%ret: p=0,0008; MFIret: p=0,03; %erit: p&lt;0,0001; MFIerit: p=0,0002), 
CD58 (%ret: p=0,0009; %erit: p=0,003) e CD44 (%ret: p=0,009; %erit: p&lt;0,003). No 
entanto, as amostras SCA sem função esplênica tiveram maior expressão de adesão 
celular para CD147 (%ret: p=0,006; MFIret: p=0,02; %erit: p=0,02), LuBCAM (%ret: 
p=0,004; MFIret: p&lt;0,0001), CD36 (%ret: p=0,0002; MFIret: p=0,01), CD242 (%ret: 
p=0,0008; %erit: p=0,05) e CD49d (%ret: p=0,04). Em relação ao Ensaio de Adesão 
in vitro, na ausência de baço, os RBCs SCA apresentaram maior adesividade à 



laminina do que os RBCs SCA com função esplênica preservada em todas as taxas 
de fluxo de tensão de cisalhamento empregadas (0,5 dyne/cm2: p=0,01; 1 dyne/cm2: 
p=0,02; 2 dynes/cm2: p=0,03; 3 dynes/cm2: p=0,03; 5 dynes/cm2: p=0,04 e 7 
dynes/cm2: p=0,03). Especialmente, reticulócitos de pacientes sem baço 
apresentaram maior adesividade à HMEC-1 em baixas tensões de cisalhamento (1 
dyne/cm2) em ambas as doenças (SCA: p=0,03; HS: p=0,03). Por fim, reticulócitos 
apresentaram maior habilidade adesiva à células endoteliais em indivíduos SCA do 
que em pacientes HS, com (0,5 dyne/cm2: p=0,04; 1 dyne/cm2: p=0,03) ou sem baço 
(0,5 dyne/cm2: p=0,02; 2 dynes/cm2: p=0,01; 3 dynes/cm2: p=0,03; 5 dynes/cm2: 
p=0,02 e 7 dynes/cm2: p=0,03). CONCLUSÃO: Nossos resultados indicam que 
embora pertençam ao grupo de Anemias Hemolíticas, as patofisiologias e evoluções 
clínicas distintas de SCA e de HS levam a padrões imunofenotípicos diferentes de 
expressão da adesão celular. Na SCA, a ausência de função esplênica teria direta 
relação com o aumento do fenótipo pró-adesivo e com a adesividade de RBCs SCA, 
o que traz sérias consequências clínicas aos pacientes, enquanto na HS sem baço, 
de maneira geral, os eventos de adesão celular são minimizados, embora ainda 
apresentem reticulócitos e eritrócitos adesivos circulantes após a esplenectomia.

ABSTRACT 

FERREIRA, P. C. G. Splenic function and cellular adhesion events in Sickle Cell 
Anemia and in Hereditary Spherocytosis. 2018. Thesis (Doctorate). Ribeirão Preto 
Medical School, Univerity of São Paulo. 

INTRODUCTION: Hemolytic Anemias comprise a group of diseases in which there is 
marked reduction in the survival of circulating erythrocytes and the bone marrow is not 
capable of compensation, even by increasing its production, which causes anemia 
from the first years of the person's life on. Among the diseases of this group, Sickle 
Cell Anemia (SCA) and Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) stand out for being diseases 
with intrinsic genetic defects of red blood cells (RBCs) that generate acute and chronic 
multisystemic complications in their patients. By distinct pathophysiological pathways, 
reticulocytes and these disease’s respective defective erythrocytes, sickle and 
spheroid ones, are continuously trapped and phagocytosed in the spleen, important 
organ of destruction of old and/or defective cells via extravascular hemolysis, which 
progressively leads to dysfunction and eventual loss of splenic function. OBJECTIVE: 
To evaluate the role of the spleen in relation to the reticulocyte (ret) and erythrocyte 
(eryt) adhesive ability and adhesion phenotype in patients with SCA and HS, with and 
without preserved splenic function. METHODOLOGY: Blood samples from 37 patients 
(22 SCA and 15 HS) with splenic function and 19 patients (13 SCA and 6 HS) without 
it were evaluated. Still, blood from 22 children with SCA was collected in a longitudinal 
study from 6 to 29 months of age. All blood samples were analyzed for splenic function 
[pitted cells (PIT) and Howell-Jolly bodies (HJB) counting], for the cellular 
immunophenotypic profile (in % and in mean fluorescence intensity - MFI) and for the 
adhesive ability of RBCs to laminin and to endothelial cell line HMEC-1. RESULTS: 
Analysis of the splenic function loss transition showed that it intensified from 3 years 
of age on (PIT: r=0.8, p&lt;0.0001; HJB: r=0.7, p&lt;0.0001). Regarding the cellular 
immunophenotyping, PIT count correlated positively, mainly with CD147 markers 
(%ret: r=0.6, p&lt;0.0001; MFIret: r=0.6, p&lt;0.0001; %eryt: r=0.7, p&lt;0.0001; MFIeryt: 
r=0.6, p&lt;0.0001), LuBCAM (%ret: r=0.5, p=0.004; MFIret: r=0.6, p&lt;0.0001; %eryt: 
r=0.6, p&lt;0.0003; MFIeryt: r=0.4, p&lt;0.004) and CD58 (%ret: r=0.4, p=0.006; MFIret: 
r=0.5, p&lt;0.0013; %eryt: r=0.4, p&lt;0.009; MFIeryt: r=0.6, p&lt;0.0001). In the 
immunophenotypic comparison between spleen absence or presence, the loss of its 
function exerted influence on the increase of RBCs adhesion expression in SCA, 
mainly on CD147 (%ret: p=0.002; MFIret: p=0.003; %eryt: p&lt;0.0001; MFIeryt: 
p=0.005), LuBCAM (%ret: p=0.0001; MFIret: p&lt;0.0001; %eryt: p&lt;0.0001; MFIeryt: 
p&lt;0.0001) e CD58 (%ret: p=0.007; MFIret: p=0.006; %eryt: p=0.003; MFIeryt: 
p=0.0004), although cell adhesion has been decreased in splenectomized HS 
patients. In the comparison between diseases, HS patients with spleen showed higher 
cell adhesion frequency compared to SCA, notably in relation to LuBCAM (%ret: 
p=0.0008; MFIret: p=0.03; %eryt: p&lt;0.0001; MFIeryt: p=0.0002), CD58 (%ret: 
p=0.0009; %eryt: p=0.003) and CD44 (%ret: p=0.009; %eryt: p&lt;0.003). However, 
SCA samples without splenic function had higher cell adhesion expression for CD147 
(%ret: p=0.006; MFIret: p=0.02; %eryt: p=0.02), LuBCAM (%ret: p=0.004; MFIret: 
p&lt;0.0001), CD36 (%ret: p=0.0002; MFIret: p=0.01), CD242 (%ret: p=0.0008; %eryt: 
p=0.05) and CD49d (%ret: p=0.04). Concerning the in vitro Adhesion Assay, in the 
spleen absence, SCA RBCs showed greater adhesiveness to laminin than SCA RBCs 
with preserved splenic function did at all shear stress flow rates applied (0.5 
dyne/cm2: p=0.01, 1 dyne/cm2: p=0.02, 2 dynes/cm2: p=0.03, 3 dynes/cm2: p=0.03, 



5 dynes/cm2: p=0.04 and 7 dynes/cm2: p=0.03). Especially, reticulocytes from 
patients without spleen showed higher adhesiveness to HMEC-1 at low shear stresses 
(1 dyne/cm2) in both diseases (SCA: p=0.03; HS: p=0.03). Finally, reticulocytes 
showed greater adhesion ability to endothelial cells in SCA subjects than in HS 
patients, with (0.5 dyne/cm2: p=0.04 and 1 dyne/cm2: p=0.03) or without spleen (0.5 
dyne/cm2: p=0.02, 2 dynes/cm2: p=0.01, 3 dynes/cm2: p=0.03, 5 dynes/cm2: 
p=0.02 and 7 dynes/cm2: p=0.03). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that although 
both diseases belong to the Hemolytic Anemias group, SCA and HS distinct 
pathophysiologies and clinical evolution lead to different immunophenotypic patterns 
of cell adhesion expression. In SCA, the absence of splenic function may have a direct 
relation with the increase of SCA RBCs pro-adhesive phenotype and adhesiveness, 
which brings serious clinical consequences to the patients, whereas in HS without 
spleen, in general, cellular adhesion events are minimized, although they still present 
adhesive circulating reticulocytes and erythrocytes after splenectomy.

1. INTRODUCTION 

1.1. Hemolytic Hemolitic Anemias 

 Hemolytic Hemolytic Anemias comprise a group of diseases in which there 

is a marked reduction in the survival of circulating red blood cells and the bone 

marrow is not capable of compensation even by increasing its production. There 

are several diseases included in the Hemolytic Anemias group. They may occur 

due to intrinsic or extrinsic defects of the red blood cells. The present study deals 

with the first classification of defects, the intrinsic ones, which in turn can be 

subdivided into three categories: 1) hemoglobin abnormalities; 2) abnormalities 

of the RBC membrane; 3) abnormalities of erythrocyte enzymes. (Dhaliwal, et al., 

2004; Zago, et al., 2013). Of the two diseases addressed in this work, the first 

one, Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) is caused by a hemoglobin abnormality and the 

second one, Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS), is due to an abnormality of the RBC 

membrane. 

 Hemoglobin (Hb) is a protein abundant in red blood cells, composed of two 

types of globin chain in vertebrates. In humans, it can be encoded from seven 

paralogous genes (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? and ?) that are transcribed at different stages of 

development. The ?-globin gene is expressed in the early embryo, ? in the late 

embryo and in the fetus, and ? and ? are expressed mainly in adults. Each Hb 

molecule is a complex of two chains of two types (for example, two ? chains and 

two ? ones – ?2?2), which form four binding sites (heme groups) to the iron atom. 

The oxygenation process, in its turn, takes place with the iron interaction with the 

oxygen molecule. That process allows a reversible cooperative allosteric 

modification in the Hb as it binds to oxygen and releases it (Alberts, et al., 2010). 

 There are two mechanisms of hemolysis: the intravascular and the 



 
 
 

3 

extravascular. In the first mechanism, there is the destruction of red blood cells 

in the circulation with the release of cell contents into the plasma. Mechanical 

trauma from a damaged endothelium, complement fixation and activation on the 

cell surface, and infectious agents may cause direct membrane degradation and 

cell destruction. In its turn, extravascular hemolysis is the removal and destruction 

of red blood cells with membrane alterations by the macrophages of the spleen 

and liver (Dhaliwal, et al., 2004). 

 In the natural hemolysis process, when RBCs rupture, the released 

hemoglobin is phagocytosed by macrophages. Globin chains of hemoglobin are 

then broken down to individual amino acids that are metabolized or used to build 

new proteins. Iron is released from the heme fraction of the hemoglobin and the 

remaining structure is converted into biliverdin, which is then converted into 

bilirubin by the enzyme biliverdin reductase. Iron is transported by transferrin in 

the blood to some tissues, such as liver and spleen, for storage or to the bone 

marrow for making new hemoglobin, while free bilirubin is transported by albumin 

in the blood to the liver. Hepatocytes conjugated bilirubin which is excreted as 

part of the bile in the small intestine and intestinal bacterias convert bilirubin into 

bilirubin derivatives which contribute to the color of feces. Some of the bilirubin 

derivatives are absorbed into the blood and are excreted from the kidneys. 

Elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood together with other laboratory tests with 

further markers of hemolysis may be indicative of intravascular hemolysis 

(Embury, et al., 1994; Zago, et al., 2013).  

 In this context, intravascular hemolysis may be related to important 

implications of the Hemolytic Anemias pathophysiology. For instance, Nouraie et 

al (2013) derived a hemolytic component from well-known markers of hemolysis 



 
 
 

4 

and confirmed based on this component that associations between the patients’ 

hemolytic rate and important clinical outcomes in SCA, such as systemic 

hypertension, increases in Doppler-estimated pulmonary systolic pressures, 

endothelial dysfunction and mortality, are determined in part by the process of 

intravascular hemolysis. 

 

1.2. Sickle Cell Anemia  

 Of the intrinsic defects of the red blood cells that can lead to Hemolytic 

Anemias, the first aforementioned, the hemoglobin abnormality, encompasses a 

very important group of disorders, the Sickle Cell Diseases (SCD). Such group is 

divided into ethnic subgroups of geographically distinct regions according to the 

haplotype of ?-globin S that they carry, which include Senegal (SEN), Benin 

(BEN), Bantu or Central African Republic (CAR), Cameroon (CAM) and Arabic-

Indian (ARAB) (Logetto, 2013). The highest prevalence of SCD takes place in the 

sub-Saharan Africa. Data from the World Health Organization in 2008 have 

estimated that over 330,000 children are born annually affected with some 

hemoglobin disorder, and of this number, 83% account for Sickle Cell Disorders 

(Modell and Darlison, 2008) 

 SCD distribution of the disease worldwide is due to two main factors: the 

selection of carriers for their advantage over endemic areas of malaria and to the 

population migration. SCA genes have arisen in areas where the protozoan 

parasite Plasmodium falciparum that causes malaria is endemic and it is believed 

that the high levels of prevalence of such genes in these regions confer 

resistance of the sickle RBC to the protozoan. Therefore, this fact introduced 

selective pressure in the human genome and erythrocytes became the main 



 
 
 

5 

target for evolutionary adaptation. In fact, the greater resistance of the sickle cell 

trait carriers that is, asymptomatic carriers, to malaria is considerable and infected 

asymptomatic heterozygous children have lower parasite densities than healthy 

children and are 50%-90% less likely to progress to a severe form of malaria or 

to die from the disease (Bunn, 2013). According to the historical origin of the Afro-

descendant population in Brazil as a result of the slave trade, the most common 

haplotype of ?-globin S is CAR, followed by BEN, mainly in the northeastern and 

southeastern regions of the country (Loggetto, 2013). 

 Individuals with SCD necessarily inherit a maternal and a paternal 

mutation. Inherited mutations may be homozygous (SS), the only genotype that 

can be termed as "Sickle Cell Anemia”, or compound heterozygous, that is, the 

disease is caused by the inheritance of hemoglobin S (HbS) in combination with 

another defect (structural or synthetic) in Hb [SC, SD, SE, S beta-thalassemia 

(SBetaTAL), S alpha-thalassemia or S rare mutant]. It is estimated that 4% of the 

Brazilian population carries the sickle cell trait (simple heterozygosis) and that 

25,000 to 50,000 people have the disease in the homozygous state (SS – SCA) 

or in compound or double heterozygous (SC, SE, SD, SBetaTAL – SCD) 

(Ministério da Saúde – Brasil, 2016). 

 SCA is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease that gives rise to 

hemoglobin S (HbS), an abnormal Hb. This defect happens due to a point 

mutation in codon 6 of the ?-globin gene that is present on the short arm of 

chromosome 11. The alteration causes the substitution of the adenine nucleotide 

for thymine (from GAG to GTG) which leads to the generation of the mutant amino 

acid valine instead of the normal amino acid glutamic acid (Maier-Redelsperger, 

et al., 1998; Lodish, et al., 2002; Voskaridou, et al., 2012).  



 
 
 

6 

 This mutation leads to serious consequences for the individual, such as 

RBCs sickling. In it, HbS polymerizes reversibly when it undergoes 

deoxygenation in low oxygen stress situations and forms fibrous intracellular 

crystalline aggregates that harden the erythrocyte membrane, increase viscosity 

and cause dehydration due to the escape of potassium and the influx of calcium 

into the cell. RBCs morphology of the red blood cells changes and acquires a 

sickle shape, which causes the cells to lose the ability to carry oxygen and to 

travel through small capillaries properly (Darghouth et al., 2011; Voskaridou, et 

al., 2012). Sickle RBCs specifically alter the adhesion molecules expression 

pattern on their surface and start adhering abnormally to the endothelium of 

smaller vessels. Microvascular vasoconstriction and immature erythrocyte 

destruction processes are established and lead the patient to severe Hemolytic 

Anemia state (Darghouth et al., 2011; Voskaridou, et al., 2012; Rees, et al., 

2010). Although this sickling phenomenon may be reversible with reoxygenation, 

when systematically repeated, it may intensify the functional alterations and the 

cell becomes irreversibly sickled (Naoum and Naoum, 2004). 

 The symptoms that result from this genetic alteration are, therefore, 

serious and worthy of mention. Erythrocytes of affected individuals become rigid 

and their traffic through the capillaries becomes blocked, which causes severe 

pain and tissue injury (Lodish, et al., 2002). Vasocclusion events promote 

ischemia, hemolysis and tissue inflammation, which leads to acute pain, acute 

chest syndrome, hyposplenism, osteonecrosis and nephropathy in patients, 

among other complications. Reperfusion episodes may also lead to pulmonary 

hypertension, priapism, leg ulcers, and cerebrovascular disease (Embury, et al., 

1994; Rees, et al., 2010). 



 
 
 

7 

 Thus, the rate of hemolysis and the degree of anemia have important 

pathophysiological and clinical consequences in sickle cell anemia. A decreased 

hemoglobin concentration leads to decreased delivery of oxygen to the tissues. 

Intravascular hemolysis leads to the release of hemoglobin and arginase-1 into 

the plasma, into the scavenging of plasma NO by cell-free hemoglobin, and into 

the depletion by arginase-1 of plasma arginine, the obligate substrate for the NO 

synthases.  These processes may contribute to reduced NO bioavailability and 

vascular dysfunction, which leads to the endothelium activation and a cicle of 

RBC sickling and to the vasoclusive events. (Chiang and Frenette, 2005; Nouraie 

et al., 2013). 

  

1.3. Hereditary Spherocytosis 

  Hereditary spherocytosis is a type of Hemolytic Anemia, responsible for 
qualitative and/or quantitative alterations of the erythrocyte membrane proteins. 

Some typical morphological alterations are high osmotic fragility and increased 

density and spherical shape which leads to decreased survival of the erythrocytes 

due to marked degradation carried out by the spleen (An and Mohandas, 2008; 

Gallagher, 2013). 

 HS prevalence is high in northern European populations (approximately 

50/1000,000), lower in latin white populations (20 to 30/100,000) and even 

smaller in black and yellow populations. Hereditary spherocytosis is a genetic 

autosomal dominant disorder. However, about 10% of those people affected do 

not present any type of family history related to the disease, in which case the 

pathology comes from some type of mutation (Granjo et al, 2003).   



 
 
 

8 

 The disease genetic alterations generate modifications in erythrocyte 

membrane proteins, such as spectrin, band-3 protein, protein 4.2, but mainly on 

ankyrin. The membrane proteins, associated to the lipid bilayer are supposed to 

provide rigidity and integrity to the erythrocyte membrane. Nevertheless, due to 

the genetic alteration, erythrocytes lose vertical linkage between membrane 

skeleton and lipid bilayer and undergo microvesiculations formation, which 

decrease the surface area without altering the cell volume. Importantly, the 

severity of anaemia is directly related to extent of membrane surface area loss. 

With decrease in pH, glucose concentrations, ATP and the increase in the 

number of circulating free radicals, events like loss of elasticity and difficulties in 

the passage through the endothelial cells and the spleen may become frequent 

and eventually lead to great splenic vascular congestion (An and Mohandas, 

2008; Gallagher, 2013; Zago, et al., 2013). 

 Main HS clinical symptoms encompasses jaundice, likely to happen with 

hemolysis of any kind, splenomegaly and gallstones formation. To indentify HS, 

the most characteristic feature is increase of MCHC (mean corpuscular 

hemoglobin concentration) due to the dehydration caused by loss of K+ ions and 

water (Gallagher, 2013; Zago, et al., 2013).  

 Regarding the HS treatment, splenectomy is generally recommended for 

patients from 5 years of age on who present splenomegaly, reticulocytosis, 

hypoplastic and aplastic crises, growth deficit or cardiomegaly. However, once 

considered routine, growing recognition of the longterm risks of splenectomy, 

including cardiovascular disease, thrombotic disorders, and pulmonary 

hypertension, as well as the emergence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci, a 

concern for infection in overwhelming postsplenectomy infection, have led to re-



 
 
 

9 

evaluation of the role of splenectomy.  Vaccinations have been shown to play an 

important role in reducing the number of cases of sepsis mortality after 

splenectomy (An and Mohandas, 2008; Zago, et al., 2013). 

 

1.4. Spleen  

 The spleen is an intraperitoneal organ located on the left side of the body, 
right below the ribs and it lies in the left upper quadrant, under the diaphragm. 

This organ is covered by a capsule and consists of two major types of tissue: the 

red pulp and the white pulp. The red pulp is where the red blood cells (RBCs) 

undergo a refined quality control while the white pulp is part of the immune 

system, in which by the way, the spleen has a very important role by scanning 

the blood for evidence of bacterial infection (Embury, et al., 1994)  

 There are two circulatory routes through the splenic pulp: open and closed 

circulation. In a nutshell, a closed “fast flow” circulation drains blood directly into 

the venous sinusoids, flowing together to become trabecular veins. In an open 

“slow flow” circulation, blood flows into a reticular fibrous framework of the red 

pulp and/or via the marginal zone of the lymphatic tissue before reaching the 

sinusoids (Vancauwenberghe, et al., 2015).  

 So, the blood system in the spleen holds a unique open system consisted 

of trabeculae coming within the tissue. Blood comes in through the trabecular 

artery and into the central artery. In its surrounding area, there are a lot of 

lymphocytes forming the periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths (PALS), that are a 

massive lymphoid tissue consisted mainly of T cells and macrophages, which 

screens the blood for the presence of bacteria and viruses and initiates antibody 

responses against those as well as producing antibodies. Surrounding the PALS, 



 
 
 

10 

there is another lymphoid tissue called the marginal zone, which is made of 

predominantly macrophages. Within this tissue, there are other lymphatic tissues 

called follicles, which are essentially surrounded by the marginal zone and 

contain immune B cells. Together, the PALS, the marginal zone and the follicles 

form what so-called white pulp of the spleen (Vancauwenberghe, et al., 2015; 

Steiniger, 2015; Embury, et al., 1994). 

 On the blood way into the spleen, splenic arteries go into capillaries which 

eventually break down, lose their wall structure and the RBCs end up in 

formations called venus sinuses. In the natural splenic physiology, RBCs very 

slowly migrate in these very large sinuses in the presence of many macrophages 

that, in their turn, scan the red cells for any evidence of dysfunction, in order to 

remove old damaged red cells from the blood. Between the end arteries and the 

venus sinuses, there is an area of tissue called the cords, which contains plenty 

of macrophages. Together, the cords and the venus sinuses make up the red 

pulp above-mentioned. The white pulp represents around 25% of the splenic 

tissue, which makes the other 75% consisted of the red pulp, but the ratio of white 

to red pulp increases with age due to accumulated antigenic exposure and 

stimulation (Brousse, et al., 2014; Steiniger, 2015).  

 Thus, the main role of the splenic red pulp is to destroy or filter abnormal, 

unhealthy or older RBCs. To do so, the slits presented between the endothelial 

cells of the venus sinuses are important. When these cells move into the venus 

sinuses, they are drained into the collecting veins before being drained into the 

splenic vein. However, old and defective RBCs are unable to pass through the 

slits effectively and thus are phagocytized by the surrounding macrophages. 



 
 
 

11 

Then, the cleaned or healthy RBCs are released back into the splenic vein and 

into the blood system (Embury, et al., 1994; Brousse, et al., 2014). 

 If the spleen is removed from a person, one will produce lower amounts of 

antibodies and will be at an increased risk of infection. Besides that, the blood of 

an splenectomized person presents an increased number of abnormal RBCs in 

the circulation, such as those containing Howell-Jolly bodies (HJB), which are 

remnants of the nucleus from the erythropoiesis maturation process (Corazza, et 

al., 1990; Brousse, et al., 2014). HJB presence is also related to hyposplenism, 

even when the spleen remains with a normal size or enlarged, the so-called 

functional hyposplenism (Covas and Zago, 1987; Sears and Udden, 2012). Still, 

another important marker of splenic dysfunction observed in splenectomized 

individuals is the presence of vacuoles on RBCs surface when observed under 

Interference Contrast Microscopy, which has also become another diagnostic 

factor for hyposplenism (Natham and Gunn, 1966; Brousse, et al., 2014). 

 On the other hand, one of the criteria used for the diagnosis of 

hypersplenism is the presence of splenomegaly. Enlargement of the splenic 

volume occurs in proportion to the increase in the RBC volume stored in the 

expanded extra sinus spaces. In this situation, normal RBCs penetrating the 

splenic red pulp face adverse conditions represented by high hematocrit (Hct) 

and decrease in the energetic substrates levels and in ph levels. Together, these 

factors lead to the drop of ATP levels with consequent instability and loss of 

membrane components, decrease in deformability and consequent erythrocytes 

retention and lysis (Covas, 1985). 

 Briefly, splenic injury is generally silent and progressive. It can be clinically 

overt with acute splenic sequestration of red cells, an unpredictable and life-



 
 
 

12 

threatening complication in infants. Splenomegaly, with or without hypersplenism, 

can also occur and can coexist with loss of function. Hyposplenism, in its turn, 

increases the susceptibility of SCA children to infection with encapsulated 

bacteria, which is notably reduced by penicillin prophylaxis and immunization 

(Brousse, et al., 2014). 

 

1.5. Cellular adhesion interactions 

 The bone marrow is responsible for the process of erythropoiesis, which 

consists of several stages of differentiation, from erythroid colony forming units 

to mature red cells. Such process may also occur extramedullary in other organs, 

such as the spleen in specific cases (Chasis, 2006; Zago, et al., 2013). 

 Macrophages are known for the major role in terminal erythropoiesis in a 

specialized microenvironment called the erythroblastoside island. In this 

structure, erythroblasts receive the necessary conditions for their maturation and 

their expelled nucleus undergoes phagocytosis by the central macrophage 

(Chasis, 2006; De Back, et al., 2014). The close relationship between 

macrophage and erythroblasts is evidenced in the expression of various surface 

markers such as VCAM-1 and ?V integrin in macrophages and ?4?1 and ICAM-

4 integrin in erythroblasts (Chasis, 2006; De Back, et al., 2014).  

 	With the release of sickle erythrocytes, in SCA, and of early reticulocytes 

in Hemolytic Anemias in general into the circulation, the spleen plays a crucial 

role in the clearance of these abnormally more adhesive cells because it already 

naturally has a destructive role in the recycling process of old erythrocytes, when 

extravascular hemolysis takes place (Manwani and Bieker, 2008). Therefore, it is 

relevant to analyze the adhesion molecules expression pattern of immature or 



 
 
 

13 

defective cells released into the circulation in the absence and presence of this 

organ in Hemolytic Anemias. 

 Nowadays, there are some methods available that allow us to assess the 

splenic function and some adhesion molecules that may be important in spleen 

function absence. In addition to conducting the immunophenotypic study of the 

cells of interest, one of the possible approaches to investigate the adhesive 

abilities of the pathophysiological characteristics of Hemolytic Anemias in vitro is 

to evaluate patients' blood regarding their rheological properties. Knowing the 

RBCs adhesion behavior against some substrates via molecular interactions is 

of great importance in the study of Hemolytic Anemias, particularly at low shear 

stress flow rates that mimic the natural microcapillaries flow, once it can provide 

information on cell-cell and on cell-extracellular matrix interactions via, for 

instance, an adhesion assay (El Nemer, et al., 2008).

HYPOTHESIS 
 



 
 
 

15 

2. HYPOTHESIS 

 The chronic hemolysis observed in SCA causes early release into the 

circulation of young reticulocytes that, together with the disease characteristic 

circulating sickle erythocytes, express greater number of adhesion molecules, 

which stimulates the vasocclusive phenomenon. In this context, the investigation 

of the splenic role on the cellular adhesion profile and on the cellular 

adhesiveness in SCA becomes as necessary as in other Hemolytic Anemias, 

such as HS for instance. However, by presenting chronic hemolysis caused by a 

different pathophysiological mechanism, HS offers, in turn, a counterpoint to the 

process of red blood cell sickling and of VO crisis in SCA and their consequences 

for the splenic function, that is noteworthy. 

 Besides the role in the removal of old erythrocytes, the spleen has an 

important protective function, contributing to the decrease of peripheral blood 

cells that abnormally express adhesion molecules on their surface, such as sickle 

erythrocytes and those with membrane defects. Therefore, the loss of splenic 

function would initially have a direct relationship with the increase of pro-adhesive 

phenotype and adhesiveness of reticulocytes and red blood cells in the peripheral 

circulation of patients with SCA and HS.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

4. MATERIAL AND METHODS 

4.1. Experimental design 

 The groups were divided according to the type of disease and, within the 

group of patients with Sickle Cell Anemia, according to the transition range of the 

splenic dysfunction evolution considered in the literature, which points to the 

period between 1 and 2 years of age (Pearson, et al., 1985; Rogers et al., 2011). 

Thus, for the purpose of categorization, patients with up to 2 years and 5 months 

of age were included in the group called SCA with preserved splenic function, 

and in turn, the SCA group without preserved splenic function was constituted of 

individuals 3 years old or older participating in the research. 

 

4.1.1. Follow-up of the splenic function loss transition 

• SCA group with preserved splenic function - in this first group 

approach, a longitudinal study has been conducted in order to evaluate the 

spleen parameters of individuals affected by SCA with up to 2 years and 5 months 

of age, specifically in the following time Windows of 4 months each: from 6 to 9, 

from 10 to 13, from 14 to 17, from 18 to 21 and from 22 to 29 months of life. 

 

4.1.2. Analysis of splenic function loss in SCA and in HS patients 

 Groups of patients whose blood samples were collected for this analysis 

are as it follows: 

• SCA group with preserved splenic function – children mentioned 

above were also considered in this second approach of the study, as the group 

that has not completely lost splenic function yet and that, therefore, is in this 

transition. 



 
 
 

20 

• SCA group without preserved splenic function – SCA patients from 

3 years old, as the group without splenic function or with almost complete loss of 

it. 

• HS group with spleen - HS patients who still have the spleen. 

• HS group without spleen –HS splenectomized patients. 

 Patients who presented any disease in their health history that might affect 

their immunity or splenic function, blood transfusion within the previous 3 months 

of collection or a severe sepsis episode were excluded. This selection has been 

made based on the analysis of the exams held in the patients' medical records, 

so that no additional examination has been requested for this project’s 

development.  

 

4.2. Sample obtention 

  This is an observational study whose permission for sample obtention was 

previously approved by the Research Ethics Committee of HC-FMRP and by 

CONEP (CAAE: 46629915.0.000.5440). The Informed Consent Form for the 

collection and use of biological material and the Informed Consent Form for the 

storage of biological material given to the participants are shown respectively in 

Appendices 8.1 and 8.2.  

 

4.3. Red blood cell freezing and thawing 

 From each fresh blood sample collected in EDTA tubes, 2 mL were 

separated to be frozen and stored. Blood samples were centrifuged at 2500 rpm 

for 10 minutes at 4ºC. Plasma was discarded and the erythrocytes were 

incubated in 40% Glycerol solution (Formule 548 - INTS, Paris, France) at a 



 
 
 

21 

volume ratio of 1:2, for 10 minutes and then transferred to cryogenic 0.5 mL 

straws (Cryo Bio System, Saint Ouen sur Iton, France).  Glycerol is an attractive 

red blood cell cryoprotective agent because it is relatively nontoxic at high 

concentrations and it readily permeates the cell at 37ºC (Scott, et al., 2005). The 

blood was subjected to a slow cryopreservation process in the Freezal freezing 

machine (Air LiquideTM, Paris, France) in order to prevent excessive cell volume 

reduction and the lethal concentration of electrolytes and to prevent inappropriate 

formation of ice crystals which can cause rupture of the red blood cells (Scott, et 

al., 2005; Stolzing A, et al., 2012). The freezing curve has been standardized 

after several tests in which, besides different rates of temperature decline having 

been applied, two parameters have been considered post-thawing of the tested 

samples: calculation of the free hemoglobin concentration and visual 

classification of hemolysis. The adopted curve consists of two stages of freezing 

speed: 1st) from 5 to -40ºC (decline of 1ºC/minute) and 2nd) from -40ºC to -100ºC 

(decline of 10ºC/minute). After this procedure, the samples were stored in liquid 

nitrogen (-196ºC) for later use in the Adhesion Assay described below. 

 Once thawed, the blood samples were diluted in 10% Glycerol solution 

(Formule 534 - INTS, Paris, France) at a volume ratio of 1:3 and centrifuged at 

2500 rpm for 10 minutes at 4ºC. After the supernatant was discarded and the red 

blood cell pellet was resuspended in 8% (1:3) Sorbitol solution (Formule 533-

INTS, Paris, France), further centrifugation under the same conditions was 

performed. The pellet of red blood cells was then sequentially washed in 0.9% 

physiological solution (JP Indústria Farmacêutica S.A., Ribeirão Preto, Brazil) 

and centrifuged 5 times before being resuspended in a stabilizing formulated 

glycine buffered saline (ID-Cell Stab, BioRad®, Lagoa Santa, Brazil) at a 



 
 
 

22 

concentration of 0.8%. Samples were then stored overnight at 4ºC, ready to be 

used in the Cell Adhesion Assay in the following day. 

4.4. Pitted cells counting 

 One of the ways to assess the splenic function loss is to quantify the 

circulating erythrocytes that present depressions in their cell membranes, the so 

called pitted cells, which, under normal physiological conditions, appear gradually 

in higher frequency as the cells age and, under pathophysiological conditions, 

appear on a larger scale due to splenic dysfunction.  For each sample, two drops 

of fresh blood were fixed immediately after its collection in 0.3 mL of 3% 

formaldehyde in buffered solution, at pH 7.4. After 30 minutes, one drop of the 

material has been transferred to a slide and covered with a coverslip for 

observation under a microscope with immersion oil, magnification of x63. Five 

hundred cells per patient were evaluated and the percentage of cells that had 

one or more depressions was quantified. Images of pitted cells were also 

recorded by the microscope software. The erythrocytes have been analyzed with 

Normasky's Microscopy or Differential Interference Contrast Microscopy – DIC 

(Axio Observer A1 - Carl Zeiss®, Jena, Germany). 

 

4.5. Howell-Jolly bodies counting 

 Howell-Jolly bodies (HJB) are nuclear remnants presented in circulating 

red blood cells which have not been properly removed by the spleen (Brousse et 

al., 2014). For quantification of the frequency of red cells that contain such 

remnants, fresh blood smears previously collected in EDTA were analyzed with 

immersion oil (x100) under light microscopy after May-Grünwald and Giemsa 

staining (Lewis et al., 2006). Ten microscopic fields were considered for each 



 
 
 

23 

blood smear, with 100 erythrocytes analysed in each field, in order to obtain an 

estimate of the cell percentage with HJB in a sample of 1000 erythrocytes per 

patient. After quantification, images of cells with HJB were performed on a 

microscope equipped with a digital camera in the AxioVision™ software (Axio 

Observer A1 - Carl Zeiss®, Jena, Germany). 

  

4.6. Cellular immunophenotyping 

 Immunophenotyping of erythrocytes and reticulocytes was carried out on 

blood samples collected after 60 hours of storage at 4ºC in stabilizing formulated 

glycine buffered saline at 0.8%. The red blood cells concentrate was diluted in 

0.2% BSA PBS solution and incubated with primary antibodies (ABs) against the 

surface molecules IgG, CD36, CD44, CD47, CD49d, CD58, CD99, CD108, 

CD147, CD151, CD239 (LuBCAM) and CD242, for 60 minutes at room 

temperature (RT). Excess of AB was removed with two washes at 1200 rpm for 

3 minutes at RT. Secondary ABs conjugated with phycoerythrin (PE) fluorophore 

were used to label the primary antibodies at a 1/150 dilution, for 45 minutes at 

RT in the dark. Further washes were performed and all tubes containing the 

above-mentioned antibodies were later labeled with ReticCount™ reagent 

(thiazole orange) (BD Biosciences®, San Jose, USA), for 30 minutes at RT in the 

dark, for further analysis of the mean intensity fluorescence (MFI) and of the 

reticulocytes and red blood cells frequency of expressing the adhesion molecules 

adopted in this study. FACSDiva™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences®, San Jose, 

USA) was used to analyse the results, using FACSDiva Version 6.1.1 software 

(BD Biosciences®, San Jose, EUA) for acquisiton of data, in order to eliminate 

possible cell agregates or doublets presented in the samples, which could 



 
 
 

24 

generate false-positive results. Furthermore, on the day of each collection, 5 ?L 

of fresh blood from each patient were labeled with 1 mL of ReticCount™, for 30 

minutes in the dark at RT, in order to determine the percentage of reticulocytes 

in the total human peripheral blood analyzed. These samples were processed on 

the FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences®, San Jose, USA). Negative 

controls were performed both for antibody labeling and for ReticCount™ labeling. 

Both systems were calibrated for the evaluation of at least 10,000 events in each 

determination.  

   

4.7. Cellular adhesion assay  

4.7.1. Expansion of the HMEC-1 lineage 

 Transfected human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) 

(ATCC, Chicago, USA) were grown in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental 

Biology (MCDB) 131 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) supplemented with 

10 ng/mL of epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, USA), 1 

?g/mL of hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), 10 mM of glutamine 

(Gibco™, Grand Island, USA), 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Logan, 

USA), 100 U/mL of penicillin (Sigma, Steinheim, Germany) and 100 ?M of 

streptomycin (Sigma, Steinheim, Germany) at pH 7.4.  

 Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator, with HEPA grade 100 

filter (Thermo Electron Corporation, Marietta, USA), at 37 ºC and 5% CO2 and 

manipulated in vertical laminar flow (Thermo Electron Corporation, Marietta, 

USA). Once having reached about 80% of confluency, the endothelial cells were 

washed twice with PBS. Then, enzymatic cleavage has been performed with 

0.025% trypsin solution (Sigma, Steinheim, Germany) with 0.5 mM of EDTA and 



 
 
 

25 

1 mM of sodium pyruvate (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) for 5 minutes. Cells detached 

from the plastic bottles were resuspended in RPMI with 10% FBS, centrifuged at 

1200 rpm for 10 minutes at RT and seeded into Vena Flux Endothelial+™ 

biochips with eight parallel microcapillaries 0.8 mm wide (Cellix®, Dublin, Ireland) 

at a concentration of 2x107 cells/mL in 20 ?l of complete MCDB131 medium in 

each biochip channel. Such channels had been previously pretreated with 0.1 

mg/mL type I collagen (Corning®, Wiesbaden, Germany) for at least 15 minutes 

at 37ºC. Seeded channels with HMEC-1 were incubated for 2 hours before being 

connected to the closed Kima pump system (Cellix®, Dublin, Ireland). 

 

4.7.2. Treatment with laminin 

 In the meantime, while the microcapillaries were seeded with HMEC-1, 

others were treated with 20 ?l of laminin solution (Biolamine, Stockholm, Sweden) 

in each channel, at 10 ?g/mL overnight in a humid chamber at 4ºC. On the day 

of the experiment, each laminin-treated channel was saturated with a 0.5% BSA 

solution in PBS, one hour prior to the experiment, in order to avoid non-specific 

binding between endothelial cells and red cells receptors. 

 

4.7.3. Adhesion assay preparation 

 The Dynamic Adhesion Platform is a tool that allows the user to mimic 

venous and arterial physiological flow and blood shear stress by means of a 

system that includes the biochips with microcapillaries previously mentioned and 

a set of microfluidic syringe pumps (ExiGo™, Cellix®, Dublin, Ireland) controlled 

by a LabVIEW interface with the aid of Exigo™ flow sensors (Cellix®, Dublin, 

Ireland) (Cooke et al., 1993).  



 
 
 

26 

 After 2 hours of incubation at 37ºC, the biochip coated with HMEC-1 cells 

was connected to the Kima pump, which allows the intermittent pumping of 

culture medium onto the endothelial cells. Its running is carried out via wireless 

connection to an iPod Touch whose iKima application has been programmed to 

execute the flow of culture medium in two steps: 1st) flow rate of 600 ?L/minute 

and perfusion time of 30 seconds; 2nd) without flow for 40 minutes. After 8 hours 

of incubation, TNF-a at a concentration of 5x10-3 ?g/mL was added to the system, 

in order to promote activation of endothelial cells. The cells remained a total of 

24 hours connected to the Kima pump. 

 On the experiment day, biochips previously seeded with HMEC-1 or 

treated with laminin were taken to the Adhesion Platform microscope where they 

were connected to the syringe pump system and its sensors. Such sensors allow 

the user to precisely dispense a certain volume of liquid at specific flow rates into 

the capillaries. Channels treated with HMEC-1 cells remained at a temperature 

of 37ºC. 

 

4.7.4. Blood sample preparation 

 On the experiment day, the red cell pellet previously thawed, washed and 

stored in ID-Cell Stab has been washed again twice with physiological solution 

and diluted in 1 mL of Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) 

containing 3.7 g/L of sodium bicarbonate (Sigma, St. Louis, USA), 10 mM of 4- 

(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (Sigma, St. Louis, 

USA), 100 U/mL of penicillin, 100 ?M of streptomycin, 0.5 M of calcium chloride 

(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), 0.5 M of magnesium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. 



 
 
 

27 

Louis, USA) and 0,4% of human serum albumin (HSA) (Vialebex®, Lille, France) 

at pH 7.4. 

 In order to observe the red cell adhesion ability to laminin, the blood pellet 

was diluted to a Htc of 0.5% and for the channels seeded with HMEC-1, blood 

was diluted to 1% Hct. The biochip was then fed on one side by the diluted blood 

sample and aspirated on the other side by the sensor-controlled microfluidic 

syringe pump system. Each patient sample has been run in duplicate for the two 

cell adhesion conditions at six different and progressively higher rates (0.5, 1, 2, 

3, 5 and 7 dyne/cm2), according to the program shown in Figure 1. Such program 

consisted of two steps: 1st) Perfusion, in which red blood cells flow remained at 

0.5 dyne/cm2 for 15 minutes and 2nd) Wash, in which the other mentioned speeds 

were applied for 5 minutes each. A photograph was recorded at each speed 

adopted, in six representative areas along the biochip channel, by using 

AxioVision™ software (Carl Zeiss®, Jena, Germany) so that adhered cells to 

laminin or to HMEC-1 endothelial cells could be quantified later with the aid of the 

same software.

successive increase of speed every 5 minutes at flow rates 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 dynes / cm2. Axis x 
represents the time, in minutes.  
 

4.8. Statistical analysis 

 Statistical analysis was performed using GraPhpad Prism version 7.00 

software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, USA). For evaluation of the proportional 

relation between the percentage of pitted cells, cells with HJB and patients age, 

Spearman's non-parametric linear correlation test has been applied. Evaluation 

of median between the compared conditions and the calculation of the descriptive 

statistics, containing the subjects hemolysis data, have been performed by 

applying the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test and data are expressed as 

[Median ± (Interquartile Interval)]. Also, the former test was used for further 

quantitative analysis. Findings obtained for the Immunophenotypic Assay are 

shown as percentage and MFI expression. Cell Adhesion Assay contains data 

expressed as adherent RBCs/mm2. Differences have been considered significant 

when p&lt;0.05.

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

5.1. Splenic function quantification 

5.1.1 Splenic function quantification in SCA children between 6 to 29 

months 

 HJB and vacuoles on the red blood cell surface (PIT) are known cellular 

characteristics that make it possible to evaluate the filtering and cleaning function 

of old or defective circulating cells performed by the spleen. Literature findings 

indicate that a percentage greater than or equal to 3.5% of pitted cells is indicative 

of splenic dysfunction (Pearson, et al., 1985). In its turn, values higher than 0.03% 

of cells containing HJB corpuscles were associated with loss of splenic filtration 

function (Rogers et al., 2011). 

 In the present study, the follow-up study of the pitted cells percentage (r = 

0.6, p = 0.006) and those with HJB (r = 0.5, p = 0.01) showed that the splenic 

function slightly decreased as the first months of life passed in the SCA group 

with patients between 6 and 29 months of life (Figure 2).

5.1.2.  Splenic function quantification in SCA subjects from 3 years of life 

on and in HS subjects 

 When the aforementioned SCA group with individuals up to 29 months of 

age was compared to SCA patients 3 years old or older, there was a significant 

decrease in splenic function in the last group (PIT: r = 0.8, p&amp;lt;0, 0001 and HJB: r 

= 0.7, p&amp;lt;0.0001) (Figure 3A-B). Still, HJB counting and PIT counting correlation 

was significant (r = 0.5; p = 0.001) (Figure 3C). Also, there was a significant 

correlation between HJB counts and PIT counts (r = 0.5; p = 0.001) in SCA 

patients 3 years old or older, in accordance with previous findings (Corazza, et 

al., 1990).

HJB. 

5.1.3. Markers of hemolysis and splenic function loss  

 Some clinical signs are also predictive of an anemic state and of splenic 

function loss, and are thus considered markers of hemolysis (Zago, et al., 2013). 

 As shown in Table 1, of the hemolysis markers compiled in this study, 

levels of indirect bilirubin [1.61 (1.15 - 3.5) mg / dL; p = 0.01] and platelets [484 

(411.5-706.5) x 103 / ?l; p &amp;lt;0.03) were higher in asplenic SCA patients in 

comparison to subjects with preserved splenic function [1.02 (0.5 - 1.5) mg / dL; 

p = 0.01] and [387.5 (324.5 - 462.5) x 103 / ?L; p &amp;lt;0.03], respectively. On the 

other hand, despite the important function of the spleen in cleaning defective 

circulating cells, splenectomy in HS patients, as a general rule, decreases the 

levels of some important markers of hemolysis in the circulation, improving 

certain pathophysiological aspects of the disease (An and Mohandas, 2008). In 

fact, the data analyzed in this study demonstrated that circulating reticulocytes 

[2.36 (1.25 - 3.0) %; p = 0.03], indirect bilirubin levels [0.5 (0.3 – 1.35) mg / dL; p 

= 0.01],] and LDH [300.5 (283-333) U / L; p = 0.0003] decreased in

 In this study, the intensity of splenic dysfunction was also inversely 

proportional to the amount of HbF in the red blood cells of SCA patients. Thus, 

as spleen’s phagocytic protective function gradually decreased, peripheral 

circulation of HbF levels declined (r = - 0.65; p &amp;lt;0.0001) (Figure 6), reflecting 



 
 
 

36 

what is commonly observed in the SCA pathophysiology (Maier-Redelsperger et 

al., 1994).

5.2. Cellular immunophenotyping 

5.2.1. Adhesion markers versus PIT counting comparison 

 Of the two biomarkers of splenic function evaluated in this study, PIT 

counting showed a higher correlation directly proportional to the aging of the 

patients (Figure 3). In fact, PIT counting represent a more sensitive method for 

evaluation of splenic function (Corazza, et al., 1990). Thus, the study objective in 

this new phase was to investigate whether the splenic function loss would be 

correlated with the increase of circulating adhesive reticulocytes and erythrocytes 

in SCA and HS patient samples. 

 The immunophenotypic expression analysis in this study used 11 surface 

markers normally adopted to characterize reticulocytes and red blood cells 

regarding their adhesive profile. The correlation of the pitted cell percentage 

versus the frequency and versus the MFI expression on the surface of 

reticulocytes and erythrocytes regarding each adhesion markers was compared.

 When evaluating the amount of adhesive epitopes expressed on the 

reticulocyte and erythrocyte membrane, we observed higher frequency and 

higher MFI for the markers CD147, LuBCAM and CD58 in SCA patients with no 

splenic function compared to patients with preserved splenic function (Figures 7-

9, A-D top), confirming the prominent adhesive role of these molecules in the 

interaction with the activated endothelium and the pro-thrombotic phenotype 

observed in SCA, at the same time that highlights the importance of the splenic 

activity in controling the adhesive phenotype of some adhesion markers in 

patients with SCA (El Nemer, et al., 2008, Rees, et al., 2010, El Nemer, et al., 

2010). 

 Both types of HS samples, with and without spleen, haven’t differed in 

frequency or MFI expression for CD147, LuBCAM and CD58 (Figures 7-9, A-D 

bottom).

 Adhesion marker CD242 has shown to be more frequently expressed, in 

percentage (Figure 10A-B top), in reticulocytes and erythrocytes of SCA patients 

without preserved splenic function, although the MFI expression hasn’t differed 

(Figure 10C-D top). On the other hand, only erythrocytes positive for CD99 and 

CD108 were more frequent in those SCA patients without spleen compared to 

SCA subjects with preserved splenic function (Figures 11-12B top). There was

5.2.2 Spleen absence/presence comparison 

  In the first part of the cellular immunophenotypic analysis in relation to the 

splenic function loss, it was observed that there was a distribution pattern of pitted 

cell percentages, in which two main groups were detected: one group with PIT 

value lower than 20% and another one with PIT cell frequency higher than 20%. 

Based on that, SCA patients were categorized again and considered in two 

groups with the following conformation: 

• SCA group with preserved splenic function – patients who 

presented a PIT cell frequency lower than 20%, without loss or with partial splenic 

function loss; 

• SCA group without preserved splenic function - patients who 

presented 20% or more of circulating pitted cells, with total splenic function loss.  

 In this second part of the immunophenotypic analysis, we aimed to explore 

the reticulocytes and erythrocytes behavior in the presence or absence of splenic 

function.  

 Data obtained showed that the splenic function loss condition presented 

increased frequency and MFI expression of CD147, LuBCAM and CD58 on SCA 

reticulocytes and erythrocytes of subjects without splenic function in relation to 

those SCA samples with preserved splenic function (Figure 18A-D top). Besides 

that, CD242, CD99 and CD108 also stood out in frequency on both RBCs 

population surface (Figure 18A-B top). There was also an increased MFI 

expression of CD44+ reticulocytes (Figure 18C top).  

 On the other hand, reticulocytes LuBCAM+ and CD36+ were in lower 

frequency and showed decreased MFI expression in HS splenectomized patients 

compared to those ones with spleen (Figure 18A and C bottom), although the 



 
 
 

50 

frequency of CD108 positive erythrocytes was higher in the first HS group 

mentioned (Figure 18B bottom). 

 In a nutshell, data obtained when comparing the spleen absence/presence 

in the two Hemolytic Anemias evaluated indicated that CD147, LuBCAM and 

CD58 are noteworthy adhesive markers in SCA pathophysiology. Regarding HS 

disease, there was a low adhesion marker expression pattern on both RBCs 

population in general. LuBCAM and CD36 were especially in significant lower 

frequency on reticulocytes surface of splenectomized individuals.

samples from subjects with (n = 15) and without (n = 6) spleen (bottom). (C-D) MFI expression in

5.2.3. Disease type comparison 

 The next study approach took into account the type of disease, considering 

that, on one hand, the diseases evaluated in this study present different 

pathophysiology, but on the other hand, they share similarities as they are both 

Hereditary Hemolytic Anemias.  

 Analysis of the SCA and HS samples from patients with spleen has shown 

that reticulocytes and erythrocytes LUBCAM+ were more frequent and showed 

higher MFI expression in HS samples with spleen than the SCA samples in the 

same condition (Figure 19A-D top). Likewise, reticulocytes and erythrocytes 

positive for CD44 and CD58 were presented in higher frequency in HS blood with 

spleen than in those SCA ones. Although, in the presence of the spleen, HS 

patients present a higher percentage of circulating cells positive for LuBCAM, 

CD44 and CD58 than SCA patients in the same condition, the frequency of these 

two adhesive populations of RBCs is high in patients with both diseases, of 40%, 

or higher as shown in Figure 19A-B top. In contrast, CD36, CD242 and CD49d 

positive SCA reticulocytes were seen in higher percentages and with more 

surface epitopes expressed than in HS, in the presence of spleen (Figure 19A 

and C top). These findings show that the pattern of adhesive phenotype of 

patients with spleen in these two hemolytic anemias is variable, which highlights 

the importance of the intrinsic pathophysiologies of each illness. 

 By analyzing the adhesive phenotypic pattern between SCA and HS 

patients without spleen, it has been found that after the splenic function loss, 

reticulocytes from SCA patients presented significant higher amount of positive 

circulating adhesive cells for the adhesion markers CD147, LuBCAM and CD36, 

as well as higher MFI expression of the same markers when compared to HS 



 
 
 

53 

splenectomized patients (Figure 19A-C bottom). Still, SCA samples have also 

shown higher frequency of circulating reticulocytes for the markers CD99, CD49d 

and CD242 in relation to HS patients splenectomized (Figure 19A bottom). 

Focusing on the erythrocytes population in the SCA group without splenic 

function, we also detected a higher frequency of such cells positive for CD147 

and CD242 (Figure 19B bottom), although the expression of the surface epitopes 

(MFI) did not differ in relation to the HS group in the same condition (Figure 19D 

bottom). 

 Together, the data have shown that, in the presence of spleen, HS patients 

presented higher frequency of adhesive circulating RBCs and higher intensity of 

expression of the corresponding molecules than the SCA subjects. However, 

once devoid of splenic function, SCA patients demonstrated greater adhesion 

molecules expression in RBCs, especially in reticulocytes, along with their 

increased MFI expression, in comparison to the HS group.

5.3. Cellular adhesion ability   

 After the immunophenotypic profile analysis of reticulocytes and 

erythrocytes from patients affected by SCA and HS, we have undertaken the 

analysis of these cells effective adhesive potential. To do so, we have performed 

a cellular adhesion assay at an in vitro Platform that allows studies on cell-cell 

interaction (with prior cellular or non-cellular activation) or on cell-proteins of 

interest in adhesion, migration, transmigration, and other assays (Rainger et al., 

1995, Gauthier et al., 2010, Munir H et al., 2015). 

 In the present work, the above-mentioned Platform has allowed us to 

evaluate the adhesion abilities of red cells to endothelial cells (HMEC-1 lineage) 

and to laminin, an abundant multiadhesive glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix 

essential in cellular adhesion processes and several others (Lodish et al., 2002).  

  Again, two types of comparison were established. In the first one, we 

aimed to evaluate possible differences within the two diseases studied under the 

spleen presence/absence condition. The second analysis compared the cellular 

adhesive performance between the diseases under the same condition, that is, 

both with preserved splenic function or both without it. 

 

5.3.1 Spleen absence/presence comparison 

 When SCA samples without preserved splenic function were compared to 

SCA with it, the first group’s RBCs presented significant increase in adhesiveness 

to laminin in all the six flow speeds applied (Figure 20A). However, not only the 

overall adhesive ability to HMEC-1 was considerably inferior than the one 

detected against laminin, but also there was no difference between the RBCs 

quantification of SCA subjects before and after the splenic function loss (Figure 



 
 
 

56 

B). But then, when quantified RBCs that were adhered to HMEC-1 were 

subdivided into reticulocytes and erythrocytes, significant higher adhesiveness 

was observed in SCA reticulocytes from individuals without preserved splenic 

function compared to those with spleen at the rate of 1 dyne/cm2, which mimics 

the closest blood flow speed in vivo (Figure 20C). Noteworthy, of all the RBCs 

adhered to HMEC-1 lineage, most of them were composed of erythrocytes, but 

no difference was observed regarding the erythrocytes adhesive ability to HMEC-

1 (Figure 20D). Anyhow, reticulocytes and erythrocytes were resistant to wash-

off by increasing shear stress and remained adhered until the last flow rate 

applied.   

 Regarding the spleen absence/presence analysis on the HS groups, there 

was no significant difference between groups, although the adhesive potential of 

HS reticulocytes and erythrocytes has also shown resistance to wash-off at an 

increasing shear stress in general, and, although adhesion to laminin has been 

visually higher in the HS splenectomized group compared to the one with spleen 

(Figure 21A-B). Worthy of comment, the high variation of the standard deviation 

bars indicates the need of increasing the number of samples evaluated (n = 4), 

in order to improve the robustness of the analysis. 

 Nevertheless, observing the subpopulations of HMEC-1 quantified, the 

adhesive reticulocytes from splenectomized HS patients were detected in higher 

amount than the samples of HS subjects with spleen at the rate of 1 dyne/cm2 

again (Figure 21C). Still, of all the RBCs adhered to HMEC-1 lineage, most of 

them were composed of erythrocytes again but the small amount of reticulocytes 

that adhered couldn’t resist the increasing shear stress washing imposed, unlike 

the erythrocytes (Figure 21C-D).  



 
 
 

57 

 In a summary, in the spleen absence condition, SCA RBCs exhibited 

higher adhesive ability to laminin rather the corresponding group with preserved 

splenic function. Moreover, it should be also pointed out the reticulocyte higher 

adhesive ability against HMEC-1 in both Hemolytic Anemias at a shear stress 

flow rate similar to the blood flow in vivo.

5.3.2. Disease type comparison 

 Data obtained from the comparison of the disease type showed that once 

in the condition of spleen presence, SCA and HS samples did not differ in 

adhesiveness to laminin and to HMEC-1 (Figure 22A-B). However, the quantified 

reticulocyte subpopulation that adhered to HMEC-1 presented significant higher 

adhesive potencial in the SCA samples than in the corresponding HS group at 

low shear stress rates (0.5 and 1 dynes/cm2) (Figure 22C).  

 Lastly, after splenic function loss, SCA and HS cells showed no significant 

difference in adhesiveness against laminin (Figure 23A), although SCA samples 

tended visually to show a more adhesive pattern than HS cells. This event may 

have happened due to the high variation observed by the standard deviation bars 

which makes it important to reiterate the need of increasing the number of HS 

samples (n = 4) evaluated in order to obtain more representative outcome. 

 Focusing on the analysis of RBCs to HMEC-1 adhesive ability, the overall 

quantification showed higher adhesiveness of RBCs only at 5 dynes/cm2, a high 

flow rate. But then, the observation of reticulocytes and erythrocytes 

subquantification revealed that SCA reticulocytes were more adhesive to HMEC-

1 in almost all the shear stress flow rates applied (0.5, 2, 3, 5 and 7 dynes/cm2), 

unlike the lack of singnificant difference in the adhesive potential between the 

groups’ erythrocytes against HMEC-1 (Figure 23D). 

 Together, these findings show that reticulocytes may present a higher 

adhesive potential against endothelial cells in SCA individuals than in HS 

patients, in both conditions, either with or without the spleen. Data also showed 

that, in general, RBCs had a greater adhesive binding to laminin than to HMEC-

1 lineage.

6. CONCLUSION 

 - Splenic function quantification presented a slight decrease with aging in 

the first months of life (6 to 29 months). However, from 3 years of life on splenic 

function significantly decreased with aging in patients with SCA; 

 - Immunophenotypic findings showed that, in general, the more advanced 

the splenic function loss (higher PIT count) was, the more frequent in circulation 

RBCs positive for the erythrocytes markers CD147, LuBCAM and CD58 were in 

SCA samples. 

 - Spleen absense played a notable role in the increase of reticulocytes and 

erythrocytes adhesion expression in SCA, although it led to decrease of cell 

adhesion expression pattern in splenectomized HS patients. CD147, LuBCAM 

and CD58 positive reticulocytes and erythrocytes adhesion expression stood out 

in SCA patients without splenic function. 

 - Regarding the disease type comparison, HS patients with spleen 

presented higher frequency of cell adhesion expression. However, SCA samples 

without splenic function showed remarkable greater cell adhesion expression in 

comparison to HS splenectomized individuals. LuBCAM, CD44 and CD58 

positive reticulocytes and erythrocytes adhesion expression was noteworthy in 

HS patients with splenic function, although CD36, CD242 and CD49d positive 

reticulocytes expression was higher in SCA with and without spleen. 

 - Focusing on the adhesion ability assay, in the spleen absence, SCA 

RBCs exhibited higher adhesive ability to laminin than the SCA RBCs with 

preserved splenic function. Reticulocytes of patients without spleen presented 

higher adhesiveness against HMEC-1 at low shear stress (1 dyne/cm2) in both 



 
 
 

65 

Hemolytic Anemias, considering the due proportions of being in much larger 

numbers in SCA patients. 

 - Furthermore, disease type comparison in the adhesion assay detected 

that reticulocytes presented a higher adhesive potential against endothelial cells 

in SCA individuals than in HS patients, either with or without spleen. Data also 

showed that, RBCs had a greater adhesive binding to laminin than to HMEC-1. 

 Together, our results indicate that although both diseases belong to the to 

Hemolytic Anemias group that encompasses RBCs intrinsic defects, SCA and 

HS distinct pathophysiologies and clinical evolution lead to different 

immunophenotypic patterns of cell adhesion expression. In SCA, the absence of 

splenic function may have a direct relation with the increase of SCA RBCs pro-

adhesive phenotype and adhesiveness, which brings serious clinical 

consequences to the patients, whereas in HS without spleen, in general, cellular 

adhesion events are minimized, although they still present adhesive circulating 

reticulocytes and erythrocytes after splenectomy.

8.1. Appendix I – Informed consent form for the collection and use of 
biological material 
 
Research Name: Splenic function and cellular adhesion events in Sickle Cell 
Anemia and in Hereditary Spherocytosis. 

Researchers in charge: MSc Priscilla Carnavale Gomes Ferreira, PhD Ana 
Cristina Silva Pinto and PhD Dimas Tadeu Covas. 

 

 We would like to invite you to participate in this research project. This 

invitation is being made to a number of patients with Sickle Cell Anemia and with 

Hereditary Spherocytosis that undergo the clinical follow-up in the 

Hemoglobinopathies clinic at the Clinical Hospital (HC) of the Ribeirão Preto 

Medical School of the University of São Paulo (FMRP-USP). 

 Participation is voluntary. To take part in the study, it is necessary to read 
this document carefully and listen to our explanations in case of doubts. If you 

are interested in participating, we will ask you to sign this document. 

 

Why will this research be performed? 
  

 Sickle Cell Anemia and Hereditary Spherocytosis represent a major health 

problem in Brazil. They are hereditary diseases and therefore have no cure. The 

production of blood in our body occurs in the bone marrow. In certain special 

areas of the bone marrow, called erythroblastoid islands, there are important 

cells, called macrophages, responsible for making our red blood cells mature to 

circulate in blood vessels. 

 The spleen is an organ that has the important function of destroying the 

circulating old red blood cells, besides contributing also to the maturation of the 

red blood cells under specific conditions. 

 In patients with sickle cell disease and other Hemolytic Anemias, such as 

Hereditary Spherocytosis, the circulating blood cells, called reticulocytes, are 

immature and adhere abnormally to blood vessels, which leads to several serious 

side effects in patients. In this context, the spleen plays a fundamental role in the 



 
 
 

73 

clearence of these abnormal cells, which gradually becomes overloaded and 

might eventually lose its function. 

 The purpose of our research is to investigate the role of the spleen in 

patients with Sickle Cell Anemia and Hereditary Spherocytosis with and without 

preserved splenic function in relation to the adhesive characteristic of 

reticulocytes and erythrocytes. 

 
Why is your participation important? 
 

 For performing the research, it is necessary to analyze the blood of the 

patients with Sickle Cell Anemia and with Hereditary Spherocytosis and to 

compare them with the parameters that we intend to investigate. 

 This comparison serves to observe the real importance of the spleen in 

the clearance process of old and/or defective red blood cells, in the maturation of 

red blood cells and in the clinical evolution of the patient in general. 

 

How will this research be conducted? 
 

 After you have agreed to participate in the study and have signed this 

Consent Form, we will collect a blood sample from your vein/your dependent's 

vein. For children with Sickle Cell Anemia, 5 blood collections (one collection 

each 3 months for a period of 1 year) will be required. For adults with Sickle Cell 

Anemia and for patients with Hereditary Spherocytosis, only one collection will be 

performed. 

 The collection of peripheral blood will be done by vein puncture of the arm 

after asepsis of the skin by the Hemocentro of Ribeirão Preto nursing team on 

the day of your return to the clinic. In addition, relevant clinical data will be 

extracted from your medical record in a second moment, preserving the 

confidentiality of it. 

 

How long will the research last? 
 It will take the total of 3 years to complete the research and it may be 

necessary to collect new blood samples if the first one is not enough. 

 



 
 
 

74 

What risks can occur? 
 Risks that may occur are: bruising at the site of venous punctures, pain 

and, more rarely, infection at the venipuncture site. 

 

What happens if you do not agree to participate? 
 

 If you do not want to participate, your follow-up assistence in our clinic will 

continue the same, without any interference on your treatment. 

 

Are there any expenses or benefits in this study? 
 

 There will be no expense and no cash gain. The only benefit will be to help 

us better understand the function of the spleen in your disease. 

 We affirm that all the data obtained will be kept in a confidential way and 

that the names of the participants will not be disclosed at any time. 

 For any questions about this research, get in touch with MSc. Priscilla 

Carnavale Gomes Ferreira by the telephone: (16) 2101-9300, extension: 9699.
