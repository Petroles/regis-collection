Abstract: Aim: This study aimed to evaluate, comparatively, the influence of distinct 
environmental impacts in the watershed on the rivers Capivara, Lavapés, Araquá and 
Pardo and the transference of effects downstream. Methods: The limnological/water 
quality study was carried out in rainy (March/2007) and dry (September/2007) seasons, 
considering 17 sampling stations. Results: Variables such as channel width and depth, 
water velocity and temperature increased towards the river’s mouth; water transparency, 
velocity and dissolved oxygen were higher in the upstream regions. Light penetration was 
total at most sampling stations and pH was predominantly acid. The sampling stations 
impacted by pollution sources, Lavapés and Araquá Rivers, exhibited higher values 
of electric conductivity, suspended solids, total nitrogen, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, 
total dissolved phosphorus, BOD, and thermotolerant coliforms. Higher values of 
electric conductivity, turbidity and suspended solids were observed in the rainy season, 
whereas higher chlorophyll concentrations occurred in the dry season. The Lavapés 
River exhibits the worst environmental condition, while Capivara River is under better 
state of conservation. This study shows that it is urgent the implementation of measures 
for preservation and restoration of these regional aquatic ecosystems. All studied rivers 
were influenced by seasonal variation, sewage discharges and by watershed use and 
occupation. The TSI is a good analysis tool. The studied rivers export organic matter and 
TN, TP and SS loads to Tietê and Paranapanema rivers. Conclusions: This study show 
the importance of river management and that the accelerated degradation of the river 
systems indicates the little progress of the Brazilian legislation in terms of preservation 
and good management practices and that the interface between science, law, management 
and conservation need to be improved.

Keywords: pollution, CONAMA 357, trophic state index, loads.

Resumo: Objetivo: O presente trabalho buscou avaliar, comparativamente, a 
influência dos distintos tipos de impactos ambientais na bacia hidrográfica sobre os 
rios Capivara, Lavapés, Araquá e Pardo, e transferências de efeitos para a jusante. 
Métodos: O estudo limnológico/qualidade de água foi realizado nos períodos chuvoso 
(março/2007) e seco (setembro/2007), sendo consideradas 17 estações de amostragem. 
Resultados:  Variáveis como largura, profundidade, vazão e temperatura da água 
aumentaram a jusante; velocidade, transparência e oxigênio dissolvido foram maiores 
nos trechos superiores. A penetração de luz na água foi total em quase todas as estações 
de amostragem e o pH predominantemente ácido. Os rios que sofrem impacto da área 
urbana, com fontes pontuais de poluição foram Lavapés e Araquá, apresentando maiores 
valores de condutividade elétrica, material em suspensão, nitrogênio total, nitrato, nitrito, 
amônia fósforo total, fosfato total dissolvido, DBO e coliformes termotolerantes. No 
período chuvoso foram observados maiores valores de condutividade elétrica, turbidez 
e material em suspensão, enquanto que concentrações mais elevadas de clorofila-a 
ocorreram no período seco. O rio Lavapés foi o que apresentou a pior condição ambiental,

the Brazilian government for the assessment of the 
water quality standards (Brasil, 2005).

The increase in nutrient concentration, such as 
nitrogen and phosphorus, is usually associated to 
pollution from domestic and industrial activities. 
Therefore the analysis of these compounds in river 
systems is necessary for environmental diagnostics.

Data from river sediments are also of fundamental 
importance. The superficial sediment of freshwater 
ecosystems is the compartment where intense 
decomposition of the organic matter and the 
nutrient cycling occur and it is also inhabited by a 
diversified and numerous benthic fauna (Håkanson 
and Jansson, 1983; Mozeto et al., 2006).

Despite the growing demand from the Brazilian 
society for the maintenance of satisfactor y 
environmental standards of the freshwater 
ecosystems, there is a weak linkage between 
legislation, practical management and science, with 
many technical difficulties and lack of appropriate 
framework for classifying rivers according to the 
specific legislation (Brasil, 2005). It is also important 
to keep as a reference that the eutrophication process 
promotes drastic changes in aquatic ecosystems, 
which will be hardly mitigated.

This investigation aimed: (a) to assess the water 
quality condition of Araquá, Capivara, Lavapés and 
Pardo Rivers by analysis of physical and chemical 
variables of water and sediment; (b) to assess the 
downstream impact of medium and small size 
rivers on higher order aquatic systems, in terms 
of transportation of phosphorus, nitrogen and 
suspended solids loads.

2. Material and Methods

The studied rivers, Araquá, Capivara, Lavapés 
and Pardo, are located in the municipality of 
Botucatu, center region of São Paulo State 
(Figure  1). Geographic positioning and general 
characteristics of each sampling point are shown 
in Table 1.

1. Introduction

The increasing multiple uses of the water 
resources have caused major modifications on 
the aquatic ecosystems. Nevertheless, it is very 
difficult to determine precisely the effects of the 
environmental impacts due to the human activities, 
as they are continuous and ubiquitous with multiple 
direct and indirect consequences (Tundisi, 2003; 
Allan, 2004; Heathwaite, 2010).

Medium and small size rivers can be considered 
as highly representative freshwater ecosystem in 
the State of São Paulo, if considered their wide 
distribution and high frequency in the local 
and regional landscapes. Due to the differential 
positioning among other Brazilian States, in 
terms of higher economic production and higher 
demographic density, in addition to the limited 
efficiency of the public environmental conservation 
policies, a severe degradation of the surface waters 
is widely disseminated in São Paulo State.

The small rivers flowing in different Brazilian 
biomes constitute a dense and widespread structural 
collecting net of all kind of allochthonous material, 
which is transported to higher order river systems 
(Tundisi, 2003). In urbanized and in mono-
cultured areas (e.g. vast sugar-cane plantation) 
the small rivers transport high loads of nutrient, 
sediments and contaminants, due to the intensive 
use and occupation of each individual watershed. 
This process can result in a considerable impact 
(magnification of loads introduction) on larger 
rivers or reservoirs downstream located, as already 
observed for southeast (Paranapanema River in 
São Paulo State - Ferrareze et al., 2006) and central 
(savanna-cerrado streams  –  Fonseca  et  al., 2014) 
Brazil.

Water physical and chemical characteristics 
are good indicators of the environmental health 
and integrity, as they are key factors determining 
the ecosystem functioning. Additionally, there 
is also a practical applicability for this kind of 
measurements, as they are primarily considered by 

em contraste com o rio Capivara em melhor estado de conservação. Os rios estudados 
foram fortemente influenciados pela variação sazonal e por despejos de esgoto e uso e 
ocupação da bacia hidrográfica. O IET mostrou ser uma boa ferramenta de análise. Os 
rios estudados impactam a jusante com a exportação de matéria orgânica e cargas elevadas 
de NT, PT e SS para os rios Tietê e Paranapanema. Conclusões: O estudo mostrou a 
importância da gestão desses ambientes e que a degradação dos rios demonstram que 
a legislação brasileira avançou pouco na preservação, gestão e manejo dos ecossistemas 
aquáticos e que a interface entre ciência, legislação, gestão e preservação de ecossistemas 
aquáticos precisa ser melhorada.

Araquá, Capivara, Lavapés belong to the Tietê 
River basin and Pardo to the Paranapanema River 
basin, both important rivers of Paraná-La Plata 
basin upper region. The considered rivers receive 
different kind and intensity of human interferences. 
The Lavapés River, right after its headwater zone, 

receives almost all the urban discharges, partially 
treated, from Botucatu (ca. 130.000 inhabitants). 
The other rivers have their courses integrally located 
in rural areas, but one sampling point of the Araquá 
River (station A2) is influenced by a small tributary 
that receives the effluent of a sewage treatment plant

3. Results

The data variance explicability of the principal 
components analysis (PCA) (Figure  2) was high, 
54.69% in the axis 1, 14.66% in axis 2. Water 
variables were mainly related with axis 1, and 
sediment variables with axis 2. The water variables 
better correlated with the axis 1 were electric 
conductivity (r=0.72), suspended organic solids 
(r=0.579), chlorophyll-a (r=0.532), total (r=0.668) 
and thermotolerant (r=0.759) coliforms, TN 
(r=0.924) and TP (r=0.9), ammonium (r=0.796), 
nitrite (r=0.869), nitrate (r=0.913), organic 
(r=0.606) and inorganic (r=0.927) dissolved 
phosphorus and total dissolved phosphorus (r=0.93) 
and silicate (r=0,509). The sediment variables better 
correlated with the axis 2 were organic matter 
(r=-0.823), NT (r=-0.784) and PT (r=-0.693) and 
grain size (r=-0.690).

Electric conductivity was a water variable that 
showed a wide variation between studied places 
(Figure  3), with very high values measured in 
sampling stations under direct influence of sewage 

from a campus of the State University of São Paulo 
(UNESP), with large human and a veterinarian 
hospitals.

Samplings were taken in the upstream, middle 
and low stretches of each river, except for Pardo, 
which is a much longer river and the lower stretch 
was not analyzed. Water and sediment were collected 
in 17 sampling stations during the rainy (March 
/2007, late summer) and dry (September/2007, 
late winter) periods (Figure 1; Table 1).

Table  2 presents the list of the measured 
variables and parameters and the methods used for 
determinations.

A Principal Component Analysis (Pcord-win) 
was performed in order to ordinate the sampling 
points distribution according to the limnological/
water quality factors.

Instantaneous loads of nutrient (total nitrogen 
and total phosphorus) and suspended solids were 
calculated (kg/day) through the multiplication of 
concentrations by flow.

upstream tributary (Cintra River) (Gralhóz and 
Nogueira, 2006). Relatively high values were also 
observed in the final stretches of Araquá (A5) and 
Lavapés (L4) rivers, were the terrain declivity is low 
and under influence of the eutrophic influence of 
Barra Bonita reservoir (Tietê River) (Moretto and 
Nogueira, 2003).

Total and thermotolerant coliforms were higher 
in dry season (Figure 4), especially in Araquá and 
Lavapés Rivers. For thermotolerant coliforms the 
highest values occurred in the middle and low 

discharges (A2, L4). Lower values were measured 
in Pardo River.

The suspended solids values in the studied river 
are low, mainly in the dry season. Higher values 
of organic and inorganic fractions of suspended 
solids were observed at station L3. Inorganic solids 
predominate compared to organic (Table 3).

The highest value of chlorophyll-a, 91 µg/L 
at A2 (Table  3), is related to phytoplankton 
exportation from an upstream sewage treatment 
plant (stabilization lagoons) located in a small

headwater (L1). Nitrite (Table  4) concentration 
was lower at P2 and L1 in the dry season and 
higher at L3 in the rainy season. The lowest nitrite 
concentration occurred in Pardo River and Lavapés 
River exhibited the highest value. Nitrate was 
frequently the main nitrogen compound. This 
pattern is expected in lotic ecosystem with oxygen 
availability (Hynes, 2001; Pérez, 2003).

The results of TP, IP and OP are shown in 
Table 4. The lowest TP mean value was determined 
for Pardo River in rainy-summer and the highest in 

Lavapés, showing the direct influence of domestic 
effluent discharges.

The water variables most strongly related to 
axis 1 were dissolved phosphorus, TN, nitrate, TP 
and nitrite. The highest nitrogen concentrations 
were observed in Lavapés River and the lowest in 
the Pardo River (Table  4). Nitrate (Table  4) was 
not analytically detected at C1, L1, P2 and P4 
in the rainy season and at L4 the concentration 
was the highest. The lowest nitrate concentration 
was measured in Capivara River and the Lavapés

2014, vol. 26, no. 4, p. 404-419   411Differential environmental impacts on small and medium size rivers…

L3, L4 and P3), due to the continuous erosional 
process and soil transportation along the basins. 
The sediment of the other sampling stations was 
classified as medium sand.

The organic matter percentage (Table  5) and 
nitrogen concentration (Figure 5) in the sediments 
were influenced by the predominant particle size. 
Thus, the stations A5, C4, L3, L4 and P3, with finer 
sediment particles, exhibited higher organic matter 
percentage and nitrogen concentration. There was 
no clear correlation between nitrogen concentration 
in water and sediment.

3.1. The trophic index

The trophic index – TSI was also calculated in 
this study aiming to classify rivers according to their 
eutrophication degree (Table 4). Higher values of 
TSI were determined for the sampling station A2, 
considered hypereutrophic due to the excessive 
concentration of chlorophyll-a. The lowest TSI was 
determined for P2, considered ultra-oligotrophic, 
which may be related to low nutrient availability 
in the water. The TSI was generally higher in dry 
season with an increase downstream tendency, 
except in A2 and P1 directly under influence of 
sewage discharges. Lower TSI was calculated for 
Pardo River in the rainy-summer period.

3.2. Loads

Higher loads of TN and TP are transported by 
Lavapés River and lower by Pardo River (Figure 6). 
Nutrient loads were higher in the rainy season, 
except for TP in Lavapés River that should be 
related to sewage concentration in dry season. 

Lavapés River during the dry-winter. The inorganic 
phosphate was lowest in P2 and highest in A2. The 
organic phosphate was lowest in C3 and highest in 
L2. Lavapés River had the highest inorganic and 
organic phosphate concentration. Capivara River 
showed the lowest inorganic and organic phosphate 
concentrations

Total and dissolved nutrient concentration were 
higher in dry period (Table 4). Sampling stations 
with domestic and industrial sewage impact were 
the ones with higher nutrient concentration (A2, 
L2, L3, L4 and P1). Lavapés River always showed 
high nutrient concentration, mainly in the medium 
river stretch, right after the headwater stretch (L1), 
and concentrations in Capivara River were generally 
lower.

DBO, pH and OD are important water 
variables that do not show up in PCA analysis. 
The BOD values were high in Lavapés and Araquá 
rivers, especially in the rainy season (Table 3). Acid 
conditions predominated in the studied rivers, 
mainly in dry season (Figure  3). In the sampling 
station L2, with a direct influence of domestic 
sewage discharges, the pH values were high in 
both periods. Higher concentrations of OD were 
observed during the dry season, due to a positive 
influence of lower temperatures. In summer higher 
differences were observed among the rivers mean 
values.

Concerning the sediment analysis, some 
upstream stations exhibited consolidated sediment 
like coarse gravel (A2 and C2) or even a continuous 
rock bed (L2 and P1) (Table 5). In the lower river 
stretches the sediment was fine sand (A4, A5, C4,

load was 1337.12  kg.day–1 in rainy season and 
231.63  kg.day–1 in dry season. Capivara, with 
higher percentage of forests in the watershed (47%) 
(Figure 7) is the river with the lowest contribution 
of SS exportation.

4. Discussion

Based on the integrated analysis (PCA) of 
data, which discriminated the main tendencies of 
variation, the discussion of the results was organized 
in the following topics: seasonality, longitudinal 
variation, impacts and management.

4.1. Seasonality

The rivers width, depth, velocity, flow, suspended 
solids, electric conductivity, turbidity and BOD 
at the different sampling stations were generally 
higher in summer/rainy season (Table 6). The rain 
effects on soil material transportation into the 
rivers are amplified by diminution of retention 
mechanisms (low permeability, soil compactness 
and deforestation). Similar results were observed 
by Moretto and Nogueira (2003) in a previous 
comparative study of Capivara and Lavapés rivers.

According to Brigante and Espíndola (2003) 
most Brazilian rivers are naturally turbid, due to 
the geological characteristics of the basins and 
effects of the strong tropical rains. Additionally, the 
suppression of the vegetal coverage, increasing soil 
susceptibility to erosion, is the most frequent human 
activity that causes turbidity increases of freshwater 
ecosystems (Pérez, 2003).

High variation in chlorophyll and dissolved 
oxygen concentration between rainy and dry season 
was also observed (Table 3). The chlorophyll-a and 
DO were higher in dry season, probably because 

For nitrogen the increase between rainy and dry 
period was proportionally higher in Araquá River, 
5.3 times. This result is related to sewage impact in 
the upstream and intensive agricultural land use in 
the watershed area (63%) (Figure  7). Suspended 
solids were higher in Araquá and Lavapés rivers in 
the rainy season. Lower SS load was calculated for 
Pardo River during dry season.

The rivers Lavapés, Capivara and Araquá 
together export 27.42 kg.day–1 of TP in the rainy 
season and 21.11 kg.day–1 in the dry season. The 
largest contribution is from Lavapés River (63% 
in rainy season and 85% in dry season). The 
considered rivers TN exportation is 531.73 kg.day–1 
in rainy season and 247.05 kg.day–1 in dry season, 
with higher contribution also from Lavapés River 
(74% in rainy and 84% in dry season). The 
total (Araquá, Capivara, Lavapés and Pardo) SS

2014, vol. 26, no. 4, p. 404-419   413Differential environmental impacts on small and medium size rivers…

The nutrient concentration and also the trophic 
(TSI) state was higher in dry season, that is related to 
chlorophyll-a and TP increase; however loads of TP, 
TN and SS were higher in rainy season due to the 
considerable increase in the rivers flow rate. Pérez 
(2003) considers that water nitrogen main sources 
are associated to organic effluents and agriculture 
activities and nitrite and ammonium indicate recent 
contamination (organic).

In Pardo River the loads transportation increase 
6.2 times for TP and 27 times for SS in rainy season 
when compared to dry the season. The Lavapés, 
Capivara and Araquá rivers loads exportation of TP 
to Tietê River were 1.3 times higher in rainy season 
and for TN it was 2.15 higher.

the diminution of the washout effect, in case of 
chlorophyll-a, and lower temperature, favoring 
oxygen solubility.

The TN, nitrite, nitrate and ammonium 
concentration in the water increased in dry season, 
directly related with water flow decrease and 
diminution of dilution effect. König et al. (2008) 
also observed higher values of nutrients during 
winter, in small streams from south Brazil, superior 
than the values of total phosphorus accepted 
by CONAMA/357 (Brasil, 2005). Phosphates 
concentration was approximately twice higher in the 
dry season, with the predominance of the organic 
fraction. Similar trend was observed by Gralhóz and 
Nogueira (2006) in a small and heavily polluted 
tributary of Araquá River.

A5, L3, L4 and P3). These stations were also 
grouped in the PCA because of the sediment 
organic matter, NT, PT and grain size (axis 2). The 
downstream accumulation of fine sediment and 
its negative impact on benthic invertebrates is a 
clear impairment indicative (Buendia et al., 2013; 
Suriano et al., 2011).

In streams impacted by sewage effluents (Araquá 
and Lavapés) the amount of nutrients is probably 
much higher than the biota consumption, and 
phosphorus tends to accumulate downstream 
in the bottom sediment. In streams with no 
significant organic sewage discharges (Pardo 
and Capivara) there is an opposite tendency, 
phosphorous concentration in the sediments 
decreases downstream, probably related to biota 
incorporation. Kuhlmann et al. (2014) considered 
that organic pollution and erosion impacts in the 
Paraibuna River were buffered by the depuration 
process and protective action of the riparian 
vegetation of the surrounding area.

4.3. Impacts

T h e  a n a l y z e d  r i v e r s  u n d e r g o  d i s t i n c t 
environmental impacts that are related with point 
and non-point sources impairments, such as urban 
sewage and intensive soil use for agriculture.

The PCA analysis grouped the river stretches 
under direct influence of punctual sources of 
pollution  -  Lavapés (L2, L3), Araquá (A2) 
and Pardo (P1). It is related with the sewage 
discharges that promoted the increase of SS, EC, 
chlorophyll-a, total and thermotolerant coliforms, 
TN and TP, ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, organic 
and inorganic dissolved phosphorus and total 
dissolved phosphorus in water, that were water 
variables better correlated with this axis 1.

In polluted waters there is a conspicuous 
increase of conductivity due to the direct effect 
of higher ions concentration (Brigante and 
Espíndola, 2003; Gralhóz and Nogueira, 2006; 
Lussier et al., 2008). Ternus et al. (2011) observed 
significant conductivity increase in river courses 
passing through urban areas with no marginal 
vegetation. Conductivity also provided to be useful 
to differentiate ecological conditions and correlation 
with biota (Braun et al., 2014; Cunha et al., 2014; 
Mazzoni et al., 2014; Suriano et al., 2011).

In sampling sites affected by sewage sources 
the organic fraction of suspended solids was much 
higher than the mineral one (e.g. A2 station) as 
observed by Brigante and Espíndola (2003) in the 
Mogi Guaçu River and concluded that these results 

The dilution effect is remarkable in rainy season, 
but the runoff contributes to higher P, N and SS 
loads during this season. Kuhlmann et al. (2014) 
considered that the transport of erosional material 
from surface runoff to the upstream section of 
Paraibuna and Ipiranga rivers (SP), were positively 
correlated with rainfall. Banner  et  al. (2009), 
studying phosphorus dynamics in streams of 
Kansas - USA, found that 88% of the total annual 
load is transported during flows that occur only in 
10% of the time.

4.2. Longitudinal variation

The upstream stations exhibited higher velocity, 
water transparency and dissolved oxygen and also 
gravel substrate. Downstream stations had higher 
width, depth and water temperature, fine sediment 
and higher organic matter percentage and nitrogen 
in the sediment. The TSI tend to be lower in 
upstream sampling stations.

The electric conductivity, suspended solids and 
turbidity have a tendency to increase downstream 
in Capivara and Lavapés rivers and the temperature 
and BOD in all studied rivers (Table 3). The PCA 
also evidenced a better environmental condition 
in the upstream sampling stations (L1, C1 and 
P2). This is a result of longitudinal accumulated 
impacts from agriculture, deforestation, soil erosion 
and domestic sewage discharges. Dodds and Oakes 
(2008) pointed out the important role of headwater 
riparian areas on the downstream water quality 
maintenance. The nutrient and sediments loads 
results demonstrate the impact of small and medium 
size rivers on higher order rivers and reservoirs 
downstream located.

In Araquá, Capivara and Lavapés rivers 
DO decreased towards the mouth due to the 
turbulence decrease (lower declivity) and increase 
in decomposition processes, higher temperature 
and lentic characteristic due to the influence 
of Barra Bonita reservoir. High increase in 
chlorophyll-a concentration at A5 and L4 stations 
and the reduction of the sediment size in the 
river mouths stations was influenced by the 
lentic characteristics of Barra Bonita reservoir, 
appropriated to phytoplankton development. In 
Lavapés river is noteworthy the DO concentration 
decline in L3 station, after the sewage discharge 
(L2), diminution of the water velocity and the 
replacement of lotic by lentic characteristics.

Stations downstream located, with lower river 
declivity, showed higher organic matter percentage 
and nitrogen concentration in the sediment (A4, 



2014, vol. 26, no. 4, p. 404-419   415Differential environmental impacts on small and medium size rivers…

pollution, streams siltation, and loss of riparian 
vegetation. In the United States the distinct stream 
segments in watersheds are classified by criteria of 
the Department of Agriculture Natural Resources 
Conservation Service (NRCS), which is comparable 
to the Brazilian CONAMA, searching for primary 
management capacity in regions of high agricultural 
threats (Fore et al., 2014).

The impact related with deforestation and 
erosion was particularly observed in Araquá River 
basin. As seen in Figure  7, the Araquá River has 
only 12% of the watershed composed by forested 
or reforested areas, and Capivara River has 47%, the 
highest forest percentage in this study. In our study 
Araquá and Lavapés Rivers exhibited higher spatial 
and seasonal amplitude of variation for temperature. 
Differences in temperature can be related to the 
distinct proportion of preserved riparian forest 
in each basin (Ternus et al., 2011). Fonseca et al. 
(2014) consider that the smallest median values 
reported for water temperature from sites classified 
as “natural” is a consequence of shading effects 
promoted by riparian vegetation.

The sampling station A2 (Cintra River) showed 
the highest chlorophyll–a concentration, due to 
the direct influence of upstream phytoplankton 
inoculums derivate from primary sewage treatment 
lagoons. The survival of the phytoplankton 
populations along the downstream stretches 
could be favored by increasing tendency of light 
penetration, as the marginal forest has been 
removed. Harding et al. (2006) observed increase 
about 100 to 600% of periphyton growth in 
impacted sites of agriculture areas with low riparian 
forest.

The loads results are related to the characteristic 
of the watershed area as for Pardo River where 50% 
is pasture, 31% agriculture and 14% forest. For 
Dodds and Oakes (2008) the land use characteristics 
are the main stressor for water quality variation 
among watersheds. In Araquá and Pardo rivers 
the runoff impact that carries TN, TP and SS 
from the soil to the water is mainly associated 
to the watershed use and occupation and loads, 
especially of TN, increased in the rainy season. 
Silicate higher concentrations are also associated 
to intensive soil use/deforestation for agriculture, 
as observed by Moretto and Nogueira (2003). 
According to Liu et al. (2014), the losses of P and 
N in farmland plains are positively correlated with 
the rainfall intensity and the antecedent conditions 
of soil moisture, and negatively correlated with the 

reflected the sum of both natural conditions and 
human impacts.

Nutrient concentration in stream water is too 
different when compared polluted and non-polluted 
conditions (Strieder et al., 2006; Cunha et al., 2011; 
Ternus et al., 2011). According to Odum (2007) 
human occupation accelerated the circulation 
of many earth materials and the auto-regulation 
processes, which tend to maintain the ecosystems 
homeostasis, became less operational, hence the 
nutrients cycles tend to be imperfect or acyclic 
resulting in a paradoxical situation with excess in 
some places and scarcity in others.

Nitrogen availability, especially associated to 
phosphorus, can regulate or limit the productivity 
in freshwater ecosystems (Carmouze, 1994). The 
concentration of chlorophyll-a in the studied river, 
as showed in the PCA, is positively correlated with 
pollution and eutrophication process. According 
to Pérez (2003) the phosphorus amount is much 
lower comparing to nitrogen, but its effect for 
eutrophication is higher. In this study the TP 
concentration were about eight times lower than 
nitrogen. Cunha  et  al. (2011) consider that TP 
point discharges from urban centers represent a 
higher risk of eutrophication for São Paulo State 
rivers than the diffuse sources. The authors also 
found lower TP concentration in rivers with 
presence of riparian vegetation.

The loads analyses also showed that high TP, TN 
and SS transported by Lavapés River are strongly 
related to point sources of pollution. According to 
Moretto and Nogueira (2003) this river receives 
huge loads of urban sewage, partially treated, just 
after its headwater.

The nonpoint source impacts were the ones 
associated with intensive watershed uses and 
occupation, such as the absence of riparian forest, 
soil compactness, soil erosion and agriculture 
impact. Better water quality conditions were 
associated to Capivara and Pardo rivers, which 
were grouped in the opposite side of PCA axis 1. 
Regionally these rivers indicate a relatively good 
conservation status. Riparian forests and whole 
watershed land cover are significantly correlated 
with the water quality metrics, particularly nutrient 
concentrations, and the agricultural and/or urban 
lands are the most important predictors of water 
quality degradation (Dodds and Oakes, 2008; 
Kuhlmann et al., 2014; Mazzoni et al., 2014).

Fonseca et al. (2014) consider that agriculture 
and planted pasture have caused major impacts on 
river watersheds of Cerrado Domain, such as water 



416 Oliveira, PCR., Nogueira, MG. and Sartori, LP. Acta Limnologica Brasiliensia

uses, conservation and restoration of wetlands and 
reduced applications to match crop needs (Allan, 
2004; Carpenter  et  al., 1998; Dodds and Oakes, 
2008; Hoffmann  et  al., 2009; Fore  et  al., 2014; 
Kuhlmann et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014).

The legislation is also an important management 
instrument, because it establishes norms and 
standards to be followed for good practices in water 
use and conservation (Kuhlmann et al., 2014). The 
interpretation of particular water variables, such as 
DO and BOD, is commonly made for water supply 
and sewage companies in Brazil, but it can generate 
deficient interpretations. In this study the DO 
and BOD did not show strong relationship with 
pollution, as observed for SS, EC, chlorophyll-a, 
coliforms, Nitrogen e Phosphorus in water.

The specific resolution of the Brazilian Council 
for the Environment, CONAMA 357, that 
considers a range of standards can be considered 
an advance for the Brazilian environmental policy. 
It establishes limits for water variables according to 
the current and future uses, and classifies freshwater 
systems in five classes (especial, 1, 2, 3 and 4).

The results of some studied variables were 
confronted with the standards of the CONAMA 
357 resolution for class 1, due to its good quality 
and multiple uses possibilities. Maintenance or 
restoration in order to achieve class 1 condition 
should be a target for the society distinct sectors.

In general the OD and turbidity of most sampling 
stations, as well as chlorophyll-a concentration 
except at stations A2, A5 and L4 (in summer), 
could correspond to class 1 river standards. Most 
of pH values were inappropriate. However, it is 
important to consider that acid water can be a 
natural condition (Odum, 2007).

All BOD values, TP concentrations, TN 
concentrations in L2, L3 e L4, thermotolerant 
coliforms in Araquá, Lavapés and P1 were 
higher than the permitted to class 1 rivers. 
According to Cunha  et  al. (2011), the reference 
standard for nutrients should be revised, e. g. 
nitrogen concentrations that are naturally low and 
limiting condition in many tropical watersheds. 
Fonseca et al. (2014) consider that systems classified 
as “very impacted” in their study presented TP 
values lower than the proposed for class 1 rivers.

From “Class 1” to “Class 4,” water quality 
decreases, and upper limits for different water 
variables are fixed. Lavapés River that receives 
effluents discharge is included in class 4. Class 
4 rivers are only intended for navigation and 
landscape harmony and its quality standards are 

vegetation cover. Longer and more intense rainfall 
resulted in a higher loss of N and P.

Violin  et  al. (2011) consider that pollutant 
concentrations increase not only due to higher 
inputs from point and non-point sources but also 
as a result of decreased nutrient removal efficiency 
in hydrological disconnected riparian zones and 
streambeds. Changes in riparian vegetation are 
notorious in the studied rivers. In case of Araquá 
River it is observed only 12% of forested areas in 
the watershed, with the predominance of pasture, 
19%, and agriculture, 63%.

4.4. Management

The obtained results can certainly subsidize 
regional environmental policies. Lavapés River 
is the most affected by urbanization, followed 
by Araquá River and they are impacted mainly 
by sewage, whose treatment efficiency should be 
urgently improved. The disposal of untreated sewage 
into rivers is still a common practice in Brazil and 
generates large impact downstream.

The Lavapés River passes through the city of 
Botucatu and the population is in contact with 
very polluted stretches of the river, providing 
an unhealthy environment, taking off aesthetics 
scenarios, preventing the water to be used for 
water supply, irrigation, fishing and leisure despite 
its great potential. Moreover this study also shows 
the river exports large amounts of N, P and SS 
to Tietê basin, increasing its eutrophication and 
siltation. Therefore, the Lavapés River pollution 
surpasses municipality borders and impacts cities 
downstream.

Pardo, Araquá, Lavapés and Capivara rivers are 
impacted by rural uses of the watershed, mostly 
monocultures (especially sugar-cane plantation) 
and cattle pastures without proper soil conservation 
practices and native forest preservation.

For effective management Carpenter  et  al. 
(1998) consider essential to understand the 
hydrological processes of retention, related to the 
mechanisms of nutrient mobilization and transport. 
It is important developing a strategic environmental 
assessment that aims to integrate environmental and 
sustainability considerations into strategic decision 
making (Bidstrup and Hansen, 2014).

The P and N soil losses and transport to 
surface waters by erosion and runoff occurs over 
larger spatial scales or landscape scale and may be 
reduced by increasing vegetation cover and gallery 
forest, maintaining buffers zones or other passive 
land uses in headwater streams, regulate the land 



2014, vol. 26, no. 4, p. 404-419   417Differential environmental impacts on small and medium size rivers…

sized rivers studied export large amount of NT, TP 
and SS, mainly to the Tietê River basin/Barra Bonita 
reservoir. The assessment of Araquá, Capivara, 
Lavapés and Pardo rivers conditions demonstrates 
that management measures at punctual and 
watershed levels are urgent and that environmental 
law standards should be reconsidered and improved.

very permissive. According to Araújo and Santaella 
(2001), the management concept that domestic and 
industrial wastewater can be disposed into water 
bodies due to their ability to dilute and degrade the 
waste and pollutants is primitive and must be more 
intensively fought. The law consideration that a river 
can receive wastewater with high concentration 
of pollutants is harmful to the society, especially 
considering that São Paulo States is presently in 
the worst water crisis in the history. Therefore, 
all the rivers should have a minimum quality for 
nobler purposes than only navigation and landscape 
harmony.

The applicability and efficiency limitations of the 
legislation for management purposes may be related 
to continuous aquatic environment degradation 
as observed in this study. The CONAMA/357 
Resolution seems to be inadequate to different 
environmental impacts, not considering regional 
typologies and not addressing specific ecosystem 
features. This can mask the reality and generates 
false interpretations. The study also shows that 
the CONAMA/357 could be improved, in order 
to consider important variables, such as sediment 
quality, water electric conductivity, the influence 
of ecological process and be more restrictive to 
nitrogen concentration. In case of phosphorus 
it seems to be too restrictive. By assessing the 
general watershed condition and multiple threats, 
management agencies can prioritize conservation 
actions and investments based on the types and 
severity of the threats, and the degree of primary 
management capacity (Fore et al., 2014).

In China environmental protection policies 
have been implemented to prevent soil erosion 
and nonpoint source pollutions, resulting in a 
considerable percentage of change, close to 60%, 
of water flow, sediment, organic N, and organic P 
at watershed level (Ouyang et al., 2008).

The establishment of standards should be related 
to scientific knowledge. In Brazil, different from 
some more advanced experiences (e.g. USA, China 
and the European Union), the interface between 
science, law, management and conservation of 
aquatic ecosystems is still incipient and needs to be 
urgently improved.
