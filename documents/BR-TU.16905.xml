Summary

Coconut water is popular worldwide, mainly because of its pleasant sensory 
characteristics, nutritional value and low calorie density. However, coconut water is 
a highly perishable product due to the presence of enzymes such as peroxidase 
and polyphenoloxidase, which cause undesirable changes in colour, and also 
because of its susceptibility to microbial spoilage. The use of chemical additives 
has been adopted by the industry with the intent of increasing product shelf life. 
In this study, the efficiency of the preservatives potassium sorbate and sodium 
metabisulphite was assessed using a Central Composite Rotational Design (CCRD) 
to determine the stability of carbonated coconut water, varying the concentrations 
of potassium sorbate from 0 to 500 mg.L–1, and of sodium metabisulphite from 
0 to 100 mg.L–1. The chemical evaluations included carbonation volume, pH, 
soluble solids, dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide, acidity, ascorbic acid, 
polyphenoloxidase and peroxidase activities, colour and turbidity attributes. 
The microbiological evaluations considered the total aerobic plate count and 
the enumeration of yeasts and moulds. It was observed that concentrations of 
375 mg.L–1 of potassium sorbate and 75 mg.L–1 of sodium metabisulphite gave 
the best quality attributes with respect to minor changes in acidity and colour 
of the coconut water, providing that the raw material had low microbiological 
contamination.

Key words: Coconut water; Carbonation; Potassium sorbate; Sodium 
metabisulphite; Microbiological quality.

Resumo

A água de coco é muito popular em todo o mundo, principalmente em virtude 
das suas características sensoriais agradáveis, do valor nutricional e das baixas 
calorias. No entanto, a água de coco é um produto altamente perecível em função 
da presença de enzimas – tais como peroxidase e polifenoloxidase, que causam 
alterações indesejáveis na cor – e também em função da sua susceptibilidade 
à deterioração microbiana. O uso de aditivos químicos tem sido adotado pela 
indústria com a intenção de aumentar a vida de prateleira do produto. Neste 
estudo, a eficiência dos conservantes sorbato de potássio e metabissulfito de 
sódio foi avaliada considerando-se a estabilidade da água de coco carbonatada 
por meio do delineamento composto central rotacional (DCCR), variando as 
concentrações de sorbato de potássio entre 0 e 500 mg.L–1, e de metabissulfito 
de sódio entre 0 e 100 mg.L–1. Foram realizadas avaliações físico-químicas de 
volume de carbonatação, pH, sólidos solúveis totais, oxigênio e dióxido de 
carbono dissolvidos, acidez, ácido ascórbico, atividade de polifenoloxidase e 
peroxidase, cor e atributos de turbidez. As análises microbiológicas realizadas 
foram de contagem total de aeróbios, bem como de enumeração de bolores 
e leveduras. Observou-se que as concentrações de 375 mg.L–1 de sorbato 
de potássio e 75 mg.L–1 de metabissulfito de sódio apresentaram os melhores 
atributos de qualidade, no que diz respeito a pequenas alterações na acidez e 
à cor da água de coco, desde que a matéria-prima apresentasse contaminação 
microbiológica baixa.

of 139 °C for 10 seconds plus the addition of 200 mg.L–1 of 
ascorbic acid provided the best physicochemical stability 
for aseptically packed coconut water.

Sulphites are widely used to prevent browning, 
either by enzymatic or non-enzymatic means. They are 
also used in the control of microorganisms as antioxidants 
or reducing agents, amongst other functions. However, 
due to its adverse health effects, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) limits the use of sulphur dioxide 
(SO

2
) in processed food products to a maximum daily 

dose of 0.7 mg.kg–1 of body mass (QUEIROZ et al., 2008; 
FAO, 1967).

Although sulphur dioxide and sulphites are 
generally recognized as safe (GRAS) substances, their 
use in wines is limited to 0.035 % because higher levels 
could lead to undesirable flavours. The use of sulphites 
is not allowed in foods that are considered as sources of 
thiamine since they inactivate this vitamin (MAGA and TU, 
1994; MITCHELL, 1990).

According to Maga and Tu (1994), the intake 
of sulphite at normal levels in foods does not result in 
accumulation in the body, because it is rapidly oxidized 
into sulphate and excreted in the urine. However, a dose 
above tolerable levels (such as 62 mg.kg–1 of body mass) 
of sulphur dioxide has resulted in neurological problems in 
rats, including polyneuritis, visceral atrophy, bone marrow 
atrophy, renal dysfunction and growth limitation. In direct 
contact with the eyes, SO

2 
is quickly absorbed and gets 

into the cornea, causing acute inflammation. However, in 
general, no mutagenic, teratogenic or carcinogenic effects 
of SO

2
 have been observed in rats or mice (MAGA and TU, 

1994; MITCHELL, 1990). However, sulphites have been 
associated with asthmatic attacks and other allergenic 
effects, and in extreme cases they are able to cause death 
due to hypersensitivity.

Sorbic acid and sorbates are generally used in the 
control of microorganisms in industrialized food products, 
with a maximum recommended daily intake of 12.5 mg.kg–1 
of body mass (MITCHELL, 1990; FAO, 1967). For the 
microbiological preservation of coconut water, many 
authors have used pre–determined concentrations of 
preservatives such as: 40 mg.L–1 of sodium metabisulphite 
(CARVALHO et al., 2007a, b); 500 and 600 mg.kg–1 of 
potassium metabisulphite (CHOWDHURY et al., 2005); 
45 mg.L–1 of sodium metabisulphite and 124 mg.L–1 of 
sodium benzoate (SILVA et al., 2003), despite the fact that 
no study has been carried out to determine the minimum 
concentration necessary to preserve coconut water.

The present research analyzed the combined action 
of potassium sorbate at concentrations ranging from 0 to 
500 mg.L–1 with sodium metabisulphite at concentrations 
from 0 to 100 mg.L–1. These concentrations were chosen 
in order to obtain samples containing only one of the 
preservatives and also concentrations above those 

1 Introduction

Coconut water is a beverage appreciated worldwide. 
It is a drink with a slight sweet and acid flavour (pH 5.5), it 
is somewhat cloudy and it is constituted mainly of minerals 
and sugars, and in smaller proportions, by nitrogenous 
substances (amino-acids), lipids and vitamins. Due to 
its rich composition in salts, it is considered as a natural 
isotonic drink (MEDINA et al., 1980; MACIEL et al., 1992; 
CAMPOS et al., 1996).

Coconut water is a highly nutritious beverage 
which favours microbial spoilage. The product is also 
susceptible to browning due to high oxido-reductase 
enzyme concentrations such as polyphenoloxidase and 
peroxidase.

Polyphenoloxidase catalyzes two types of oxidative 
reactions: hydroxylation of monophenols into o-diphenols 
and the oxidation of the latter compounds, which are 
colourless, into dark toned o-quinones (DUARTE et al., 
2002). 

Peroxidase, on the other hand, catalyzes a great 
number of oxidative reactions using hydrogen peroxide as 
the substrate, or, in some cases, oxygen as a hydrogen 
acceptor. Peroxidase is considered to be the most 
heat stable vegetable enzyme and its inactivation has 
conventionally been used as an indicator of blanching 
efficacy in vegetable processing (FREITAS et al., 2008).

Enzymatic browning is usually undesirable and 
therefore chemical and physical methods have been 
developed aiming at its inhibition, which can be achieved 
by the elimination or complexation of one or more essential 
components of the reaction such as oxygen, enzyme, 
copper or substrate (GUERRERO-BELTRÁN et al., 2005).

The only normative instruction in Brazil concerning 
processed coconut water applies to its physicochemical 
characteristics (BRASIL, 2009), and there is no specific 
legislation concerning the use of preservatives for this 
product. Thus different compounds are used according 
to the specific legislation for fruit juices, that is, 
0.004 g.100 mL–1 of sodium sulphite and 0.03 g.100 mL–1 of 
sorbic acid in the carbonated beverages (BRASIL, 2007). 
Ascorbic acid is frequently used to prevent enzymatic 
browning, and has been shown to be more effective than its 
isomer, iso-ascorbic acid. This acid acts as an antioxidant, 
reducing the quinine produced by polyphenoloxidase, 
and contributing to a drop in the pH value. However, 
ascorbic acid can also participate in the non-enzymatic 
browning process by forming furfural derivatives in the 
presence of low pH and heating, producing dark pigments 
(QUEIROZ et al., 2008; TORALLES et al., 2008).

In a study by Abreu and Faria (2007), ascorbic acid 
was applied at concentrations of 0, 100 and 200 mg.L–1, 
together with heat treatments varying between 138 and 
144 °C for 10 seconds. They found that a heat treatment

(2007). This step consisted of injecting carbon dioxide into 
the beverage under pressure to obtain the desired degree 
of carbonation. The drink was packaged into PET bottles, 
previously cleaned with a sodium hypochlorite solution 
(200 mg.L–1) and stored at room temperature (20 ± 1 °C) 
for 62 days. The preservatives were added before 
carbonation. The concentration used was established by 
a Central Composite Rotational Design (CCRD) with two 
independent variables (potassium sorbate and sodium 
metabisulphite) at concentrations varying from 0 to 
500 mg.L–1 and 0 to 100 mg.L–1, respectively, as shown 
in Table 1. The responses obtained were statistically 
analyzed using the STATISTICA 7 program.

3.1 Evaluation of stability

To evaluate the stability, the carbonation volume 
w a s  a n a l y s e d  a c c o rd i n g  t o  t h e  A S T M  F 1 1 1 5 - 9 5 
standards (ASTM, 2001); the pH was determined using 
a Digimed potentiometer (Sao Paulo – SP, Brazil), model 
DM-20 at 25 °C; the soluble solids were determined 
using a portable refractometer (Optech, model RCZ, 
Guarulhos – SP, Brazil); dissolved O

2
 was assessed using 

an O
2 
meter (Mettler Toledo, model MO128, Barueri – SP, 

Brazil); dissolved CO
2 
was evaluated using a CO

2 
electrode 

(Thermo Scientific, model Orion 720A - represented in 
Brazil by Analyser, Sao Paulo - SP); colour and turbidity 
were determined in a colorimeter (Hunterlab, model 
Colorquest ll, using the CIELAB system with the illuminant 
D65, observer’s angle of 10°, TTRAN-type calibration and 
HAZE measurement - turbidity).

Titratable acidity was determined based on method 
942.15 of AOAC (HORWITZ, 1997). The ascorbic acid 
concentration was determined by titrating 10 mL of sample 
with 50 mL of a 1 % oxalic acid solution standardized 
with a solution of 2 g.L–1 dichloroindophenol (DCFI). A 
spectrophotometer (Beckman, model DU-70) was used 
to determine the peroxidase and polyphenoloxidase 
activities. For polyphenoloxidase, 1.3 mL of 0.35M 
phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 0.7 mL of 0.2M catechol and 
2 mL of the coconut water sample were mixed at room 
temperature, and the absorbance read at 425 nm in a 
spectrophotometer at zero time and after 10 minutes of 
reaction. For peroxidase, 1.3 mL of 0.35M phosphate 
buffer (pH 5.5) at 35 °C was used, and 2 mL of the 
coconut water sample added together with 0.5 mL of an 
alcoholic solution of 0.5 % guaiacol and 0.2 mL of 0.1 % 
hydrogen peroxide . The absorbance was read at 470 nm 

permitted by the Brazilian law. The effect of carbonation 
was also assessed, since it is generally known to provide 
a refreshing sensation and also because of a possible role 
in microbial growth inhibition.

2  Experimental procedures

2.1 Materials

Green coconuts of the dwarf variety were used with 
maturity levels of approximately 6 to 7 months, bought from 
the Central Supply Unit in Campinas – SP (CEASA), Brazil. 
For standardization of the coconut water (Brix = 7 °Brix 
and pH between 4.3-4.5), refined sugar was used as a 
source of sucrose (Caravelas brand, Usina Colombo, 
Ariranha – SP, Brazil), and citric acid (Synth brand, 
Labsynth, Diadema – SP, Brazil). Ascorbic acid (Nuclear 
brand, Casa da Química, Diadema – SP, Brazil) was 
used at a concentration of 200 mg.L–1, and the chemical 
preservatives potassium sorbate (Vetec brand, Vetec, 
Rio de Janeiro – RJ, Brazil) (varying from 0 to 500 mg.L–1) 
and sodium metabisulphite (Synth brand, Labsynth, 
Diadema – SP, Brazil), (varying from 0 to 100 mg.L–1) were 
also employed.

A s  f o r  t h e  p a c k a g i n g  s y s t e m ,  t r a n s p a re n t 
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles were used, 
provided by Minalba (Minalba, São José dos Campos - SP). 
The characteristics of the bottles were: weight of 
16.49 ± 0.05 g, volumetric capacity of 348.58 ± 1.32 mL 
and oxygen permeability of 0.047 ± 0.001 cm3/bottle.
day.atm at 25 °C. High density polyethylene screw caps 
containing Bericap seal liners (Sorocaba-SP) were used 
to close the bottles,.

3 Methods

Before extracting the water from the fruits, they 
were sanitized using a solution of sodium hypochlorite 
(200 mg.L–1). The water was then standardized to a 
pH between 4.3-4.5 and 7 °Brix using citric acid and 
sucrose. At this point, 200 mg.L–1 of ascorbic acid were 
added to the water. The drink was clarified by passing 
through a 1 ?m pore opening filter, pasteurized at 90 °C 
for 30 seconds, and rapidly cooled to 2 °C in a plate heat 
exchanger (model Micro Plak Jr., manufactured by Suma 
Brand Indústria e Comércio Ltda., Campinas – SP, Brazil), 
with a nominal flow rate of 300 L.h–1, fed with a positive 
displacement pump (Netzsch brand, Pomerode – SC, 
Brazil). The coconut water was carbonated to 2 to 
3 volumes in a carbonating machine developed by Faria

All regressions were significant with a significance

surfaces for each attribute as presented in Figure 1.

The response surface for carbonation volume 
(Figure 1a) showed an inverse correlation, with lower 
concentrations of the two preservatives giving greater 
carbonation volumes. However, the inverse behaviour was 
observed for pH (Figure 1b), with lower concentrations of 
the two preservatives giving lower pH values.

For the microbiological evaluations, the total 
aerobic plate count was obtained by pour plating 1 mL of 
each dilution into Plate Count Agar (PCA). The colonies 
were counted after 48 hours of incubation at 35 °C and 
expressed as Colony Forming Units per mL (CFU.mL–1). 
The yeast and mould count was obtained by surface 
plating 1 mL of each dilution in Potato Dextrose Agar 
(PDA) and counting after 5 days at 23 °C (SILVA et al., 
2010). The microbiological evaluation was carried out at 
zero time and after 30 and 61 days of storage.

4 Results and discussion

The samples were evaluated during 62 days of 
storage at room temperature (20 ± 2 °C). At the end of 
the storage period, it was shown that the concentration of 
the preservatives influenced the results with a significance 
of 10 % for the carbonation volume, pH, dissolved CO

concentrations of the preservatives, and samples E and 
G only contained sodium metabisulphite and potassium 
sorbate, respectively. These results indicated there was 
a certain synergism between the two preservatives with 
respect to microbial control. The other samples, D, F, H 
and K, showed no significant microbial development at 
any point.

For the yeast and mould counts, samples A, B, C, 
E, G and I presented detectable counts after 30 days 
of storage, with E and G having counts above 105 CFU.
mL–1. After 61 days, there was an increase in the yeast 
and mould counts for samples A, E and G, with E and 
G showing total counts above 106 CFU.mL–1, a fact that 
confirms the efficacy of the combined action provided by 
the two preservatives.

The activities of the enzymes polyphenoloxidase 
and peroxidase were not significant in any of the samples 
during the storage time, indicating that the thermal 
processing applied to the samples was sufficient to 
inactivate them. As in the study of Murasaki-Aliberti et al. 
(2004), heat processing with shorter holding times can 
minimize the nutritional and sensory losses in coconut 
water and promote 90 % enzymatic inactivation.

Based on the present results, concentrations of 
375 and 75 mg.L–1 of potassium sorbate and sodium 
metabisulphite, respectively, caused less changes in all 
the attributes evaluated. However, such concentrations 
are not allowed by the Brazilian legislation (BRASIL, 
2007), with limits of 260 mg.L–1 for potassium sorbate and 
40 mg.L–1 for sodium metabisulphite. According to the 
present results, this combination would also be sufficient 
to preserve the product, and thus additional confirmatory 
trials were carried out using these concentrations, as well 
as the optimal combination. However, these confirmatory 
trials showed very high microbiological contamination, 
with counts of over 108 CFU.mL–1 over a period of 
20 days of storage for both samples, indicating that these 
concentrations of the preservatives were not sufficient to 

In the determination of dissolved CO
2,
 (Figure 1c), 

only sodium metabisulphite showed a significant 
response, with lower concentrations of this preservative 
giving rise to greater quantities of dissolved gas. As for 
acidity (Figure 1d) only potassium sorbate was significant, 
and the lower its concentration, the higher the acidity 
developed in the sample.

In the deter mination of ascorbic acid, only 
potassium sorbate showed a significant response, and 
the lower the concentration of potassium sorbate, the 
greater the degradation of ascorbic acid, as seen in 
Figure 1e. Lima et al. (2009) also found a decrease in 
ascorbic acid concentration in coconut water-acerola 
fruit juice supplemented with caffeine, at a rate of 
1.24 mg.100 mL–1.day–1.

For the b* colour attribute, low sodium metabisulphite 
concentrations, and very low or very high potassium 
sorbate concentrations favoured the development of a 
yellow colour (higher values for b*) (Figure 1f). However 
for turbidity, only sodium metabisulphite had a significant 
effect, with lower concentrations allowing for the 
development of more turbidity in the samples (Figure 1g). 
These results could be associated with the growth of 
microorganisms forming gas and acid, since the sample 
would be less protected due to the lower concentrations 
of preservative, as shown in Table 4.

The microbiological evaluations of the samples 
(formulations presented in Table 1) were carried out 
at zero time and after 30 and 61 days of storage at 
room temperature, according to Table 4. Samples A, 
B, C, E and G presented a total microbial count above 
103 CFU.mL–1 after 30 days of storage. Samples A, B 
and C showed decreases in the microbial counts after 
61 days, which could be attributed to the start of the 
decline phase of microbiological development. Samples 
E and G showed an increase in the microbial count at 
the end of the observation period. With the exception 
of sample B, all the samples contained the lowest

maintain the microbiological quality of the product through 
the storage period when the raw material had a high 
microbiological load. In these confirmatory trials, the initial 
counts were over 102 CFU.mL–1 for the total count and 
almost 101 CFU.mL–1 for the yeasts and moulds. This last 
result highlights the importance of good manufacturing 
practices in order to reduce or avoid contamination of 
the product.

5 Conclusion

The present results indicated that the samples 
presented less alterations when higher concentrations 
of the preservatives were added. However, such 
concentrations were above the limits established by 
Brazilian law. For the sample with concentrations of 
260 mg.L–1 of potassium sorbate and 40 mg.L–1 of sodium 
metabisulphite, which are the limits established by the 
legislation, good stability of the carbonated coconut water 
was observed for approximately 60 days of storage at 
room temperature, provided the initial microbial counts 
were low. It was also observed that the samples that 
received only one type of preservative presented less 
stability, demonstrating a possible synergistic effect 
between potassium sorbate and sodium metabisulphite. 
Moreover, this study showed that the addition of CO

2
 to the 

coconut water, besides giving a more refreshing sensation 
to the beverage, also contributed to its conservation 
because it helped to reduce the pH value of the product, 
as well as reducing the amount of dissolved oxygen.
