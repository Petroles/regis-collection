ABSTRACT. Atlantirivulus riograndensis (Costa &amp;amp; Lanés, 2009) is a fish registered to the basin of Patos lagoon and the adjacent coastal plains in 
southern states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, Brazil, found in shallow water courses with that have large quantities of aquatic vegetation 
and forest edges. The objective of this study was to investigate the reproductive strategy and tactics of this species including the sex ratio, the length 
at first maturity, spawning type, fecundity and the possible associations among reproduction and abiotic factors. Sampling of specimens occurred in 
perennial wetlands within the Banhado dos Pachecos wildlife refuge, in the city of Viamão, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, which is a conservation 
unit that belongs to an area of environmental protection in the Pampa Biome. The capture of 30 A. riograndensis specimens per month occurred from 
January to December of 2012. A total of 188 females and 172 males were captured and the total sex ratio was 1:1 in the sampled population. Sexual 
maturity of the species occurs after 13.59 and 11.92 mm (SL) for females and males, respectively. Both a multiple spawning and a long reproductive 
period (since August to March) were confirmed by the presence of post-ovulatory follicles that were observed through histological analysis and 
the values of the gonadosomatic index in females considered spawning capable. The average absolute fecundity of the species is of 19.33 (± 6.18) 
vitellogenic oocytes in mature ovaries. No significant relationship was found between mean GSI and the abiotic data. Reproductive tactics presented 
by A. riograndensis indicate a species with an opportunistic reproductive strategy, following the pattern of other species of the Rivulidae family.

KEYWORDS. Atlantirivulus riograndensis, gonadal development, multiple spawning, fecundity.

RESUMO. Estratégia reprodutiva de um rivulídeo não anual em um banhado perene. Atlantirivulus riograndensis (Costa &amp;amp; Lanés, 2009) é 
uma espécie de peixe registrada para a bacia da laguna dos Patos e planícies costeiras adjacentes, nos estados do Rio Grande do Sul e sul de Santa 
Catarina, Brasil, encontrada em corpos d’água rasos, com grande quantidade de vegetação aquática e em bordas de mata. O objetivo deste estudo 
consistiu em investigar a estratégia e as táticas reprodutivas desta espécie, incluindo a proporção sexual, o comprimento de primeira maturação, o 
tipo de desova, a fecundidade e possíveis associações entre a reprodução e fatores abióticos. As amostragens de exemplares da espécie ocorreram em 
um banhado perene no Refúgio da Vida Silvestre Banhado dos Pachecos, município de Viamão, estado do Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil, que constitui 
uma área de proteção ambiental em uma unidade de conservação no bioma Pampa. A captura de trinta indivíduos de A. riograndensis por mês, 
ocorreu de janeiro a dezembro de 2012. Foram amostradas 188 fêmeas e 172 machos e a proporção sexual total foi de 1:1 na população amostrada. A 
maturação sexual da espécie ocorre a partir de 13,59 e 11,92 mm (CP) para fêmeas e machos, respectivamente. As análises histológicas demonstraram 
uma desova parcelada com a presença de folículos pós-ovulatórios em fêmeas consideradas aptas a desovar e um período reprodutivo longo, de 
agosto até março, confirmado pelos valores do índice gonadossomático. A fecundidade média absoluta da espécie foi de 19.33 (± 6.18) oócitos 
vitelogênicos em ovários maduros. Não houve relação significativa entre as médias de IGS e os dados abióticos. As táticas reprodutivas apresentadas 
por A. riograndensis indicam uma espécie com estratégia reprodutiva oportunista, seguindo o padrão das demais espécies da família Rivulidade. 

PALAVRAS-CHAVE. Atlantirivulus riograndensis, desenvolvimento gonadal, desova múltipla, fecundidade.

The Rivulidae family consists of nearly 409 valid 
species of annual fish from seasonal and ephemeral habitats 
whose adults die in dry seasons, and also of non-annual 
fish (Costa, 2009, 2011; Volcan et al., 2010; Eschmeyer 
&amp;amp; Fong, 2015). The non-annual rivulids of Atlantirivulus 
riograndensis (Costa &amp;amp; Lanés, 2009) are the object of 
this study. This species is included on the list of species 
threatened by extinction in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, 
and classified as in danger (Rio Grande do Sul, 2014).

Non-annual rivulids dwell in perennial wetlands 
that are subject to floods during the wet season, and stay 
preferably in shaded areas near herbaceous edges (Costa 
&amp;amp; Lanés, 2009; Costa, 2011), which are usually sensitive 
to anthropogenic pressures. On the state of Rio Grande do 
Sul, natural areas in the Pampa Biome, occupied by rivulids, 
are being lost or altered by agriculture and silviculture, 
endangering species extinction or damaging the population 
batches (Pillar et al., 2009).

The annual reproductive strategy rivulids is well 
known and described for various species. The reproductive 

success of these fish with annual cycle is associated with 
the ability to survive in unstable habitats, with elaborate 
courtship behaviors, complex processes of embryonic 
development, and the immersion of eggs into the substrate 
where they may remain in diapause until the next rainy 
season when larvae hatching occurs (Lowe-McConnell, 
1999; Arenzon et al., 2001; Arezo et al., 2005; Costa, 
2011). Other reproductive tactics presented by annual 
rivulids are rapid initial growth, early maturation, low 
fecundity, multiple spawning, long reproductive period 
during floods (Arenzon et al., 1999, 2001, 2002; Shibatta, 
2005; Volcan et al., 2011).

Non-annual rivulids, on the other hand, inhabit areas 
with year-round water availability and their spawns occur 
on the substrate or on plants (Costa, 2009). Studies related 
to reproductive biology of this group are scarce and are 
available only for Melanorivulus punctatus (Boulenger, 
1895) species, which presents a long reproductive period 
and a multiple spawn (Cassel et al., 2013).

of A. riograndensis therefore becomes fundamental for 
an understanding of its reproductive process in its natural 
habitat and its population dynamics. The study aimed to 
characterize the reproductive strategy of A. riograndensis 
in order to define their breeding season, sex ratio, length at 
first maturity, spawning type, fecundity, and the possible 
associations among reproduction and abiotic factors 
(temperature, photoperiod, and precipitation).

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The A. riograndensis specimens were collected 
in perennial, preserved wetlands at the Refúgio da Vida 
Silvestre Banhado dos Pachecos in the town of Viamão, 
state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (Fig. 1). This refuge 
is a conservation unit and covers an area of 2.560 ha 
of  sandbank brush, swampy forests and countryside 
vegetation that are associated with wetlands and form a 
mosaic (Secretaria do Meio Ambiente do Estado do 
Rio Grande do Sul, 2010a,b). The Banhado dos Pachecos 
belongs to the Banhado Grande area of environmental 
protection in the hydrographic basin of Patos lagoon.

The collection site (30°05’44’’S, 50º50’59’’W) 
corresponds to an area three to four meters wide that forms 
a strip of still, turbid water near a swamp forest (Fig. 2). It 
features lots of submerged, emergent, floating and marginal 
vegetation. The depth varies from 10 cm to one and a half 
meters and the substrate is muddy, as is characteristic of 
wetlands.

Fish samples were taken with authorization from the 
Secretaria do Meio Ambiente do Estado do Rio Grande do 
Sul (number 52/2012 and register number 395). This study 
was conducted in accordance with protocols approved in 
their ethical and methodological aspects, for the use of fish, 
by the Ethics Committee on Animal Use of the Universidade 
Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (Permit Number: 24434). 

The collections of biological material occurred from 
January to December of 2012, with a monthly sampling of 
30 specimens of A. riograndensis. Sampling occurred with 
500 mm x 300 mm dip nets with mesh of one mm between 
adjacent knots, exploring different extracts of the water 
column to sample from juveniles to adults. Specimens were 
euthanized with eugenol (clove oil) with a concentration of 
75 mg L-1, fixed in 10% formalin while still in the field and 
conserved in the laboratory in 70% alcohol. The voucher 
specimens were deposited in the ichthyology collection of 
the Departamento de Zoologia at the Universidade Federal 
do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS 17266, 17267).

Water temperature was recorded during collection 
expeditions with a thermometer at a depth of 20 cm, along 
the vegetation and around 12 pm. The monthly amounts 
of precipitation in millimeters and length of sunshine in 
hours were both obtained at the 8th District of Meteorology 
of Porto Alegre, recorded at station 83967 and publicly 
available at the bank of Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia, 
Brazil (Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia, 2013).

The data for standard length (SL) in millimeters, 
total weight and gonad weight in grams were recorded for 
each captured individual. The observations of dichromatic 
sexual dimorphism, i.e., the presence of an ocellated black 
spot on the caudal peduncle of the females (Costa, 2011), 
and macro/microscopic analysis of the gonads were used 
for sexing the individuals. The reproductive period was 
identified by analyzing the variation of gonadal maturation 
phases, and the gonadosomatic index (GSI) (Vazzoler, 
1996). Monthly variations of the GSI were tested with an 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and subjected to the post-
hoc Tukey HSD test (honestly significant difference) with 
multiple comparisons (Zar, 1999). Residue analysis using 
ANOVA were utilized to verify the normality of the data 
(Legendre &amp;amp; Legendre, 1998).

The gonads of 110 individuals in different phases 
of maturation were submitted to histology embedded in a 
glycolmethacrylate resin on a slide three ?m in thickness 
and stained with hematoxylin-eosin or toluidine blue. 
These gonads were classified into phases of gonadal

maturation (Brown-Peterson et al., 2011). All of the 
individuals macroscopically classified as immature were 
submitted to histology to confirm the sex and phase of 
gonadal maturation.

A multiple regression with stepwise method was 
used to test the mean monthly variation of GSI (dependent 
variable) in relation to the average monthly water 
temperature, photoperiod (in hours), and rainfall. Abiotic 
data were log-transformed to meet the assumptions of the 
statistical test. Residue analysis using multiple regression 
were utilized to verify the normality of the data (Legendre 
&amp;amp; Legendre, 1998).

The total and monthly sex ratio was evaluated 
by chi-square test (?²) (Legendre &amp;amp; Legendre, 1998). 
Statistical tests were performed using the R Project for 
Statistical Computing version 3.0.2. and vegan package 
version 2.0.

The absolute fecundity of the species was established 
from the counting of vitellogenic oocytes from 15 spawning 
capable females (sensu Brown-Peterson et al., 2011), 
as these possessed the highest GSI values among the 
captured females. The relative fecundity was expressed 
as the number of vitellogenic oocytes per milligram of 
total weight (Adebisi, 1987).

The same 15 spawning capable females were used to 
estimate the spawning type. Therefore, the total number of 
oocytes present in the ovaries was counted and measured. 
The spawning type was inferred based on the distribution 
of the modes of oocyte diameters, and also the histological 
analysis based on the oocyte developmental stages and the 
presence of post-ovulatory follicles and atretic oocytes 
(Brown-Peterson et al., 2011).  Histological analysis 
contributed in the identification of spawning types in 
function of the possible presence of post-ovulatory follicles 
and maturing oocytes on ovaries that were considered 
mature.  These are ovaries with high GSI values, which 
indicate that at the same time in which some oocytes are 
being spawned, others are in both early and late stages of 
maturation and will be released in the current reproductive 
period forming a batch spawn (Brown-Peterson et al., 
2011). 

RESULTS

The collections of biological material resulted in 
the capture of 188 females (SL between 10.59-44.53 mm) 
and 172 males (SL between 11.92-41.35 mm). Histological 
analysis revealed that males and females with standard 
lengths of less than 20 mm can be confused when only 
their external appearance is evaluated, because not show 
apparent sexual dimorphism of coloration. Therefore, 
the classification of specimens into male or female can 
follow sexual dimorphism of coloration only after they have 
reached 20 mm of standard length. Previous to this, males 
may present coloration equal to the females, including a 
spot equal to the ocellated black dot they present on the 
caudal peduncle.

Regarding the phases of gonadal maturation the 
female’s ovaries were classified as immature, developing, 
spawning capable, regressing and regenerating. Immature 
females were those that never spawned, showing ovaries 
with little space between the oocytes and an absence of 
evident muscle bundles or atresia and germinate cells 
in oogonia stage or oocytes in primary growth (Fig. 3). 
The immature phase concludes before the presence of 
oocytes with cortical alveolar vesicles (Fig. 4). Developing 
ovaries presented primary oocytes and primary and 
secondary vitellogenesis, and the tertiary vitellogenesis 
or post-ovulatory follicles were absent (Fig. 5). Spawning 
capable females showed large ovaries with prominent blood 
vessels, germinate cells in a state of primary, secondary and 
tertiary vitellogenesis, mature and macroscopically visible 
oocytes and post-ovulatory follicles (Fig. 6). Regressing 
females showed small, flaccid ovaries, interspaced cells, the 
presence of atresia and some vitellogenic oocytes (Fig. 7). 
Regenerating females exhibited small ovaries, a reduction 
of blood vessels, a thick and aged ovarian wall, and the 
presence of primary oocytes and oogonia. The regenerating 
phase was characterized in only one individual of large 
size (SL: 44.53 mm) in January (Fig. 8).

Males of immature, regressing, and regenerating 
phases were not observed among specimens of A. 
riograndensis captured in Banhado dos Pachecos. The 
male gonads of A. riograndensis presented themselves 
as reproductive (able to spawn) in all months of the year. 
Developing and spawning capable phases are identified 
by presenting, respectively: a continuous germinative 
epithelium, spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids, 
but without the release of spermatozoa in the lumen of the 
sperm ducts or lobules; and testes that can show all stages 
of spermatogenesis, with the release of spermatozoa in the 
lumen and duct (Figs. 9, 10, 11).

The male testes are classified as restricted lobulars 
(Figs. 9, 10, 11), with spermatogonias occurring in cysts 
only in the distal portion of the lobes. The cysts are 
maintained during spermatogenesis and rupture to release 
the spermatozoa.

Histological analysis showed that spawning capable 
females occurred from August to March, coinciding with 
seasons of higher temperatures (an average of 21°C in the 
spring and 23°C in the summer) and longer sunshine (an 
average of 231 hours in the spring and 262 hours in the 
summer, although there was no significant relationship 
between mean GSI and these abiotic data, nor with rainfall 
(females: F = 1.16, p = 0.38; males: F = 0.49, p = 0.69).

Spawning was most evident in the months of 
November, December and March, corresponding to the 
falls in the GSI values of females and males (Figs. 12, 
13). The months of April and May, mainly, corresponded 
to a period of regression of female gonads and the months 
of June and July marked the beginning of the developing 
phase (Fig. 14). GSI values differed over these months 
confirming a reproductive period set between the spring 
(October, November and December) and summer (January,

Only five female gonads (taken from specimens with 

a standard length ranging between 10.59 and 13.91 mm) 
were classified as immature. Females with greater standard 
lengths were classified as in the developing phase because

oocytes. The smallest female found with gonads in early 
development had 13.59 mm of standard length (Fig. 4). The 
smallest male found was 11.92 mm long and histological 
sections showed a developing gonad with the presence of 
spermatozoa, although in reduced numbers. Based on these 
data, the size of the first gonadal development for females 
and males of A. riograndensis was estimated.

The sex ratio of males and females in relation to 
the total sampled population was 1:1 as shown in the chi-
square test (?² = 0.71, p &gt; 0.05, df = 1), however a higher 
incidence of males was registered in June (?² = 0.71, p &amp;lt;
0.05, df = 1) (ratio of 2.3:1) and of females in the months 
of August (?² = 0.71, p &amp;lt;0.05, df = 1) and September (?² 
= 0.71, p &amp;lt;0.05, df = 1), (ratio of 2.3:1).

The estimated average absolute fecundity was 19.33 
(± 6.18) oocytes, with minimum and maximum values of 
nine and 34 vitellogenic oocytes (respectively) and the 
average relative fecundity was 0.06 (± 0.01) oocyte per 
milligram of total weight. The maximum diameter of the 
vitellogenic oocytes was 2.14 mm and the average was 
1.57 (± 0.32) mm. 

Analysis of the distribution of the total number of 
oocytes per diameter class revealed more than two modes, 
characterizing a synchronous oocyte development into 
more than two groups (Fig. 15). Histological analysis in 
gonads of females considered spawning capable confirmed 
this multiple spawning showing batches of oocytes at 
different stages of development with intermediate and final 
vitellogenic oocytes and evidence of previous spawning 
with the presence of post-ovulatory follicles.

DISCUSSION

The long reproductive period described for A. 
riograndensis in this study is quite well known among 
individuals of the Rivulidae family (Arenzon et al., 1999; 
Arezo et al., 2007; Gonçalves et al., 2011; Cassel et al., 
2013). Among annual rivulids, Austrolebias charrua Costa 
&amp;amp; Cheffe, 2001 showed all phases of sexual maturation 
from May to December, with December characterized as 

the month of senescence since the adults of this species 
die in the dry season (Arezo et al., 2007). Cynopoecilus 
multipapillatus Costa, 2002, on the other hand, has no 
defined breeding season; spawning continually and with 
gonadal maturation, interrupted only by the death of adult 
fish during the dry season (December to January) (Arenzon 
et al., 1999). 

Atlantirivulus riograndensis reproduced in the 
spring and summer seasons like M. punctatus, another 
representative of the non-annual rivulids, which showed 
females in the developing phase from May to September 
and a breeding season corresponding to the months from 
October to March (Cassel et al., 2013). Moreover, the 
pattern amongst males of being spawning capable year 
long (characteristic of A. riograndensis) also occurs in M. 
punctatus whose male reproductive cycle was characterized 
as continuous, largely uninfluenced by environmental factors 
and in which phases of gonadal maturation and regressing 
and regenerating phases were unobserved (Cassel et al., 
2013). The regenerating phase also seems to occur very 
quickly for female rivulids since in A. riograndensis only 
one female was captured in this phase of gonad maturation 
and in M. punctatus this phase cannot be registered among 
females of the species (Cassel et al., 2013). According to 
statistical analysis, environmental factors studied did not 
affect the reproduction of A. riograndensis in Banhado 
dos Pachecos, just like the males of M. punctatus (Cassel 
et al., 2013)

Atlantirivulus riograndensis presented females 
with gonads in early development starting at 13.59 mm 
of standard length and C. multipapillatus presented this 
phase of development between the total length of 8.20 and 
14.20 mm (Arenzon et al., 1999). In the ovaries of A. 
charrua, about 45 days after larval eclosion, vitellogenic 
oocytes were present in some individuals and cortical 
alveolar vesicles in others (Arezo et al., 2007), which 
correspond to the final stage of oocytes in primary growth 
and the initiation of vitellogenesis - thus characterizing 
females as in early gonadal development.

Classification between male and female A. 
riograndensis with standard lengths less than 20 mm can be 
confusing when histological analyzes are not performed and 
only sexual dimorphism in color or macroscopic analysis 
of the gonads are considered. This is because females 
of less than 20 mm may present very similar gonads to 
those of males due to the absence of macroscopically 
visible oocytes. Furthermore, sexual dimorphism in color 
in this length range still may not have been developed in all 
individuals of the population, with some males presenting 
an ocellated black spot on the caudal peduncle equal to that 
of females and an absence of a greenish tint throughout the 
body that, according to the descriptive article of the species 
(Costa &amp;amp; Lanés, 2009), characterizes them.

Regarding population composition, rivulids have 
been found with different sex ratios, e.g. with females 
being more abundant in the species A. riograndensis,

&amp;amp; Scaglia de Paulete, 1964) and Simpsonichthys boitonei 
Carvalho, 1959 (Shibatta, 2005; Laufer et al., 2009; Lanés 
et al., 2012, 2013), more abundance male in Austrolebias 
luteoflammulatus (Vaz-Ferreira, Sierra de Soriano &amp;amp; Scaglia 
de Paulete, 1964) and Cynopoecilus melanotaenia (Regan, 
1912) (Laufer et al., 2009; Gonçalves et al., 2011), or 
equal distribution, as in Austrolebias cheradophilus (Vaz-
Ferreira, Sierra de Soriano &amp;amp; Scaglia de Paulete, 1964), C. 
melanotaenia (Laufer et al., 2009) and A. riograndensis, 
considering the population throughout the present study. 
Differences in the sex ratio may unbalance the population, 
increasing competition and agonistic behaviors especially in 
species with territorial males or those that present courtship 
behavior (Gonçalves et al., 2011).

The female population majority of A. riograndensis 
in the months of August and September, on the other hand, 
may be related to a range of factors not identified in this 
study.  These factors could be included the susceptibility 
of females for capture during the reproductive period due 
to the weight of the gonads, or the selectivity of sampling 
techniques as mentioned by Dala-Corte &amp;amp; Fialho (2014) 
for Deuterodon stigmaturus (Gomes, 1947).

The synchronous maturation of oocyte lots which 
are released at intervals throughout the reproductive season 
suggests a multiple spawn (Ganias, 2013). This pattern 
of oocyte development was identified in A. riograndensis 
and registered for the annual Austrolebias toba Calviño, 
2006, Austrolebias nigrofasciatus Costa &amp;amp; Cheffe, 2001, C. 
melanotaenia, C. multipapillatus and S. boitonei (Arenzon 
et al., 1999; Calviño, 2006; Shibatta, 2005; Gonçalves 
et al., 2011; Volcan et al., 2011, 2013) and the-non 
annual M. punctatus (Cassel et al., 2013). For fish of 
lentic habitats, multiple spawning during the reproductive 
period may reduce competition among larvae when they 
have a lower rate of dispersion (Godinho et al., 2010) 
and also represent an advantage in unstable environments 
regarding abiotic factors, since they allow for some batches 
of oocytes to be released in relatively better environmental 
conditions which increases the chances of survival for 
young offspring. This reproductive tactic seems especially 
essential in annual rivulids as they can often find habitats 
in extremely variables conditions. Adaptive advantages 
associated with multiple spawns can consist in the survival 
of some batches of oocytes when conditions are unfavorable 
due to fluctuations in water levels (Lowe-McConnell, 
1999), or an increase in the quantity of produced oocytes 
being more than the size permitted by the species in a total 
spawn (Ganias, 2013). This reproductive tactic for C. 
melanotaenia was reported as a way to increase the survival 
of juveniles in unpredictable environmental (Gonçalves 
et al., 2011).

In long reproductive periods, multiple spawning is 
related to undetermined fecundity rates (Ganias, 2013). 
In these situations only the oocyte batches in advanced 
maturation fail to indicate the annual fecundity of the 

species, because new oocyte batches in primary growth 
are recruited during the breeding season whereas mature 
oocytes are eliminated in a pattern of oocyte recruitment 
that completely overlaps the spawn (Ganias, 2013). With 
multiple spawning occurring during the breeding season, 
the count of vitellogenic oocytes present in the ovaries 
can therefore be underestimated, thus explaining the low 
fecundity found for A. riograndensis, compared to the 
fecundity rate of other rivulids (Arenzon et al., 1999).  
For this very same reason, the low number of oocytes 
present between diameters 1.43 to 1.71 and 1.86 to 2.14 
mm is explained, which show two distinct modes of oocyte 
development.

Although a pattern of indeterminate fecundity 
characterizes the species, the estimated fecundity values 
for A. riograndensis can be useful in comparing them 
to annual rivulids and characterizing their reproductive 
strategy. Fecundity seems to be mainly regulated by habitat, 
based on evidence of fish population units with a wide 
geographic distribution and genera with populations that 
inhabit distinct environments and present differences in 
the estimates of the number of oocytes produced in each 
breeding season (Ganias, 2013).

The fecundity and oocyte size found for A. 
riograndensis meets other species of annual killifish, such 
as: Austrolebias toba presented an approximate fecundity 
of 57 oocytes per female per week with diameters ranging 
between 1.4 and 1.6 mm; A. nigrofasciatus apresentou 
21.5 oocytes per female per week and an average diameter 
of 1.5 mm; C. melanotaenia averaged 19 oocytes in the 
reproductive period; C. multipapillatus presented fecundity 
varied between 49 and 219 oocytes with a mean diameter 
of 1.15 mm; S. boitonei was estimated at three oocytes 
per female for every day of spawning with an average 
diameter of 1.6mm (Arenzon et al., 1999; Calviño, 
2006; Shibatta, 2005; Gonçalves et al., 2011; Volcan 
et al., 2011). Production rates (by number) and egg size, 
as registered by Moshgani &amp;amp; Van Dooren (2011) for 
Austrolebias nigripinnis (Regan 1912), can be influenced 
by environmental conditions or by the presence of males, 
such that the female-male interaction effect contributes to 
variation in the reproductive effort of these fish.

Based on these data, rivulids show a high energy 
investment in producing better quality oocytes with larger 
quantities of yolk and the attempt to increase the number 
of oocytes recruited by breeding season (since the priority 
of energy investment is in the size of these oocytes) occurs 
therefore with the tactic of multiple spawning over a long 
reproductive period. This results in a fecundity that far 
exceeds female body mass in these species of small size 
(Winemiller &amp;amp; Rose, 1992).

Large oocytes is a reproductive tactic that reported 
equilibrium strategy, while for opportunistic strategists 
the allocation of energy mainly for fast reproduction is 
cited, seeking numerous offspring to compensate for 
the high mortality rates of juveniles in their ephemeral 
and unfavorable habitats (Stearns, 2000; Reznick

et al., 2002; Mims &amp;amp; Olden, 2012). Atlantirivulus 
riograndensis, although it possesses large oocytes, 
cannot be considered an equilibrium strategist because 
it presentes a set of opportunistic tactics that allow for 
rapid habitat colonization, as described for the order of 
Cyprinodontiformes by Winemiller (1989) in studies of 
the families Cyprinodontidae and Poeciliidae. The tactics 
that characterize opportunistic strategy for A. riograndensis 
are a small body size, a prolonged spawing period, and a 
parceled spawn with small oocyte batches.

Opportunistic fish, however, may also present 
mechanisms that seek to increase survival rates of juveniles 
in variables habitats. The tactic of producing large oocytes 
that is present in some opportunistic fish (as identified in A. 
riograndensis in this study) is one of these mechanisms and 
seeks to ensure that the early stages of larval development 
can utilize the large quantity of yolk as an important source 
of energy in adverse conditions (Winemiller &amp;amp; Rose, 
1992).

In order to contain the mortality of juveniles, 
opportunist fish invest in high rates of early growth with 
early sexual maturation and thus maximize the rates 
of intrinsic population growth by reducing the average 
generation time (Winemiller &amp;amp; Rose, 1992; Fonseca &amp;amp; 
Cabral, 2007). The probability of survival of larvae in 
the early stages of life increases with rapid initial growth 
because, among other advantages, larger larvae have 
higher feeding rates and reduced vulnerability to predators 
(Fonseca &amp;amp; Cabral, 2007).

Atlantirivulus riograndensis presents, therefore, 
the same reproductive tactics found in annual rivulids with 
the exception of those associated with annualism. Thus, 
the species is characterized as an opportunistic strategist, 
with a long reproductive period (spawning capable females 
from August to March and males in the extrusion capable 
phase year round) and increase in fecundity rates through 
a parceled spawn.
