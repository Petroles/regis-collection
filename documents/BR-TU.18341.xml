RESUMO 

A membrana celular é composta por uma ampla variedade de lípidos e proteínas. Através do 

estabelecimento de interacções entre lípidos e proteínas, quer membranares quer solúveis, 

podem ser originadas heterogeneidades espaciais, levando à formação de ‘jangadas lipídicas’. 

Estes domínios transitórios desempenham um papel fundamental em diferentes cadeias de 

sinalização celular. Apesar da investigação desenvolvida na área, a membrana celular é ainda 

hoje um dos componentes celulares menos bem compreendidos. 

Nas últimas décadas têm vindo a surgir um conjunto de diferentes metodologias in vitro que 

permitem o estudo de variados processos biológicos sob condições definidas e controladas. 

Neste sentido, foram desenvolvidos variados modelos membranares minimalistas, como GUVs 

(giant unillamelar vesicles), GPMVs (giant plasma membrane vesicles) and SLBs (supported 

lipid bilayers), permitindo a análise das interacções lípido-proteína até a um nível 

unimolecular. Quando correctamente aplicados estes modelos permitem simplificar o sistema 

isolando virtualmente o fenómeno ou a partícula de interesse retendo, porém, as suas 

características fundamentais. Apesar da vantagem evidente do uso destes modelos, estas 

abordagens experimentais são tediosas, envolvendo geralmente o uso de amostras de elevado 

volume e em que a variação de certas características membranares (como a difusão lipídica) é 

apenas possível por alteração da composição lipídica ou da temperatura. 

As monocamadas lipídicas são historicamente descritas como o primeiro sistema lipídico 

observado, formando-se por distribuição espontânea de moléculas lipídicas sobre a interface 

água - ar e formação de filmes finos sobre superfícies. Dado o seu design único, a mobilidade e 

compactação lipídica podem ser facilmente ajustadas neste sistema modelo por compressão 

da monocamada depositada na interface. Apesar de o seu uso em ensaios de ligação proteica, 

este sistema tem sido negligenciado na investigação membranar recente devido à sua restrita 

aplicação. Mais concretamente, as tinas de Langmuir comercialmente disponíveis não são 

compatíveis com microscopia confocal, estando assim limitadas à monitorização da pressão 

superficial (?). Além disso, dado o volume de cada amostra relativamente elevado (cerca de 

100 mL), são necessárias elevadas quantidades de proteína purificada, comprometendo assim 

a sua aplicação em estudos biológicos. 

Neste estudo, foi utilizada uma nova tina miniaturizada de área fixa, desenvolvida no grupo 

por Chwastek (Chwastek &amp;amp; Schwille, 2013). As suas dimensões reduzidas permitem não só o 

uso de amostras de pequeno volume (cerca de 200 µL) como também conferem a 

versatilidade necessária para o seu acoplamento a um microscópio confocal. Deste modo, é 

possível aplicar técnicas de imagiologia de alta resolução (permitindo a eliminação de ruído de 

fundo, o controlo de profundidade de campo e a compilação de secções ópticas de amostras 

espessas oferecido pelo microscópio confocal), assim como espectroscopia de correlação de 

fluorescência (FCS – técnica espectroscópica cuja sensibilidade advém do uso de baixas 

concentrações de sonda e na consequente medição de flutuações espontâneas da intensidade 

de fluorescência que resultam de desvios estocásticos do sistema relativamente ao seu 

equilíbrio térmico).

O objectivo global deste projecto prende-se com a melhor compreensão da interacção 

estabelecida entre proteínas e monocamadas lipídicas. Mais concretamente foi medida a 

ligação a monocamadas lipídicas de duas proteínas estruturalmente bem caracterizadas: a 

estreptavidina – proteína tetramérica solúvel com elevada afinidade de ligação para a biotina 

(KD ? 10
-15

 M); e a toxina da cólera – enterotoxina, secretada pela bactéria Vibrio cholerae, 

constituída por um anel homo-pentamérico de subunidades B (CtxB5), responsável pela sua 

ligação ao receptor membranar gangliósido GM1 (KD ? 10
-9

 ou 10
-10

 M), e uma subunidade A 

com actividade de ribosilação que é parcialmente internalizada pelas células do hospedeiro, 

perturbando cascatas celulares de sinalização e desencadeando a infecção colérica. Foram 

realizadosensaios de ligação proteica a monocamadas lipídicas homogéneas e com separação 

de fases, na ausência ou presença dos respectivos ligandos específicos, de modo a distinguir e 

caracterizar os diferentes comportamentos proteicos. Em última análise, procurou-se 

desenvolver e optimizar um ensaio universal e quantitativo de ligação proteica a membranas 

lipídicas. 

Previamente aos estudos das interacções proteína-monocamanda, procedeu-se à 

caracterização morfológica das monocamadas lipídicas, assim como da mobilidade lipídica, 

recorrendo a microscopia confocal e a FCS, respectivamente. Observou-se pois que a fluidez e 

homogeneidade global das monocamadas é acompanhada pelo aumento linear do coeficiente 

de difusão em função da densidade lipídica no intervalo estudado (50 a 90 MMA – área 

molecular média em Å
2
), tal como se prevê do modelo de área livre (free area model). Mais, os 

valores obtidos para o ponto crítico do DMPC (36.0 ± 4.7 e 37.2 ± 13.5 Å
2
 em misturas 

marcadas com sondas diferentes) encontram-se dentro do erro dos valores descritos na 

literatura. Apesar da robustez demonstrada pelo sistema, é porém necessário ter em conta a 

possibilidade de ocorrerem desvios em extremos de densidade lipídica (50 e 100 MMA), por 

formação de fases S (sólida) e G (gás), respectivamente. 

Após validação da metodologia proposta, procedeu-se ao estudo da influência da 

compactação lipídica na ligação proteica à monocamada – quer com a estreptavidina, quer 

com a CtxB5 observou-se uma preferência para a ligação a monocamadas de baixa densidade 

lipídica e, correspondentemente baixa ? e elevada difusão lipídica. Estes resultados são ainda 

suportados pelas experiências realizadas em misturas lipídicas com separação de fase – ambas 

as proteínas apresentam uma elevada afinidade para a fase fluida LE (liquid expanded) em 

comparação com os domínios compactos LC (liquid condensed). Adicionalmente, resultados de 

titulações de monocamadas com CtxB5 apontam para a mesma tendência visto que a 90 MMA 

se obtêm intensidades de fluorescência proteica ao nível da monocamada superiores que a 50 

MMA. Este comportamento já tinha sido proposto no início da década de 80 tendo por base a 

análise de variações de ? por adição proteica a monocamadas lipídicas (Phillips et al, 1975; 

Fidelio et al, 1981; Cumar et al, 1982). Porém, no caso da estreptavidina observa-se ainda um 

comportamento extraordinário de acumulação nas bordas de domínios quando a diferença na 

organização lipídica entre diferentes fases é muito elevada. 

A especificidade de ligação foi apenas possível para a CtxB5 por incorporação de GM1 na 

monocamada. Titulações de monocamadas demonstraram que a presença de uma baixa 

concentração do gangliósido (0.1 mol %) é suficiente para aumentar fortemente a ligação da 

proteína à monocamada. Além disso, em sistemas lipídicos homogéneos a proteína retém a 



 
xi 

preferência por baixas densidades lipídicas. Porém, na presença de separação de fases, a 

presença de GM1 promove a ligação de CtxB5 a domínios LC, dado que este se incorpora 

preferencialmente em domínios rígidos. 

Apesar da elevada reprodutibilidade associada às medições em lípidos, a aplicação do sistema 

a proteínas tem um erro associado bastante elevado que impede ainda uma quantificação 

exacta da sua ligação aos lípidos. É de salientar que para além da elevada sensibilidade do 

sistema de detecção usado, as monocamadas lipídicas formadas sobre a interface água-ar são 

altamente sensíveis a diferentes factores externos (p.e. oxidação lipídica, formação de menisco 

e não homogeneidades da compactação lipídica aquando da deposição lipídica, evaporação da 

subfase, deposição proteica, etc.) que ainda não são totalmente controladas. Deste modo, é 

ainda necessário proceder à optimização do método de modo a poder determinar-se KD da 

ligação de proteínas à superfície lipídica. 

Este projecto resultou pois na obtenção de novos dados semi-quantitativos de que a 

compactação lipídica desempenha um papel importante na interacção proteína-membrana. A 

separação de fases surge pois como um mecanismo de regulação da ligação proteica, não só 

por controlo da mobilidade lipídica mas também por segregação de ligandos. 

Em suma, a abordagem aqui proposta surge como uma alternativa poderosa para estudos de 

interacções membrana-proteina, permitindo o fácil ajuste de parâmetros membranares como 

a compactação lipídica, difícil de regular em sistemas de bicamadas. A sua combinação potente 

com a microscopia confocal e espectroscopia de correlação de fluorescência resulta não só 

numa elevada resolução temporal da mobilidade de partículas lipídicas, como também na alta 

resolução espacial da ligação proteica. Deste modo, o trabalho apresentado contribuiu para a 

aproximação ao desenvolvimento de um novo ensaio quantitativo global de ligação proteica a 

membranas lipídicas.

ABSTRACT 

Cellular membranes are composed of a wide variety of lipids and proteins which can lead to 

spatial heterogeneity and formation of so-called ‘lipid rafts’, which play an important role in 

signaling processes. 

To investigate these features of lipid bilayers various in vitro models have been developed. 

Although a variety of experimental assays exist, they very often require large samples volume, 

are complicated and the membrane features can be varied only by changes in lipid 

composition or temperature. 

Here, a fixed-area miniaturized monolayer trough was used. Due to its unique design, lipid 

mobility in monolayers is easily accessible while keeping other factors constant. The system 

utilized in this study allows the use of small sample volumes (200 µL) and can be combined 

with a confocal microscope and thus providing access to high resolution imaging and sensitive 

fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) technique. 

The goal of the project was to design a quantitative assay by which protein-monolayer 

interactions can be studied. Thus, monolayers were investigated in terms of morphology and 

lipid mobility. Further, interactions of well-known ligand-protein pairs were studied: cholera 

toxin (Ctx)/ganglioside GM1 and streptavidin/biotin. The influences of phase separation and 

presence of lipid ligands were investigated. 

It was shown that the membrane affinities of cholera toxin B (CtxB5) and streptavidin depend 

on the surface density of lipid molecules. Moreover, FCS measurements indicate a correlation 

between higher protein binding and increased lipid mobility. When phase separated lipid 

monolayers were used, both proteins bound preferentially to liquid expanded phase (LE). 

However, in case of CtxB5, in the presence of the ganglioside, the protein mostly binds to the 

liquid condensed phase (LC). 

In summary, protein binding to lipid monolayers was studied by means of fluorescence 

microscopy and spectroscopy. During the studies, an appropriate methodology was developed 

and several experimental scenarios were tested. 

 

Key words: protein binding assay, confocal microscopy, FCS, lipid packing, monolayers, 

protein-monolayer interaction

MOTIVATION 

The cell is the ‘building block’ of life– from bacteria to higher eukaryotes, cell is the structural 

and functional unit. It consists of a protoplasm, enclosed within a lipid membrane. At the 

molecular level, cells are composed of proteins, the so-called 'cellular tools' and nucleic acids 

known as a 'hereditary database'. From complex networking between these components 

emerge vital functions, which allow cells to sense and react to changes taking place in the 

environment. This versatility enables cells to evolve and organize into various organisms, 

which could successfully survive an evolutionary pressure. 

Therefore, a better understanding of the biochemical and biophysical nature of individual 

components of the cell and their interactions is fundamental for broadening the knowledge of 

the principles of life. Due to the complexity of biological systems, one has to apply a 

reductionist approach, by which the system is simplified to such an extent that the 

component/phenomenon of interest is virtually isolated but still retains its main features. 

Cell membrane, especially its organization and the role in fundamental cellular processes, is 

probably one of the least understood components of the cell. Even though great 

advancements have taken place in this field of research over the last three decades, 

interactions between lipid membranes and a variety of integral and peripheral membrane-

binding proteins are still far from being fully understood. 

GOAL 

Thus, the general aim of this project was a better understanding of the interaction of proteins 

with lipid monolayers. More specifically, the binding of two well-characterized proteins 

(cholera toxin – Ctx, and streptavidin) to lipid monolayers was measured. A new, miniaturized 

monolayer setup was used to manipulate lipid packing and to investigate its influence on 

protein binding to lipid monolayers. Particularly, the project was focused on improvement and 

development of the monolayer technique by combining it with confocal microscopy and 

fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The aim was to make protein-binding assays used in 

other model membrane systems available to lipid monolayers.

I. THEORETICAL INTRODUCTION 

1. CELL MEMBRANE 

Since the 20th century, lipid membrane is no longer recognized as a simple physical barrier 

which separates intracellular and extracellular environments, and defines diverse intracellular 

organelles (Gennis, 1989), but rather as a sophisticated organelle itself which directly or 

indirectly participates in a variety of cellular processes such as protein and lipid synthesis, 

metabolite transport and cell signaling. 

Nowadays, scientists focus on the structural diversity of biological membranes, the asymmetry 

of lipid distribution between membrane leaflets and lateral heterogeneity of lipid bilayers in 

order to propose a coherent view of the cell membrane, which will cover the major biological 

aspects of this organelle (de Almeida &amp;amp; Loura, 2004). It is widely accepted that the cell 

membrane is structurally composed of two lipid leaflets (hence its name – the lipid bilayer) 

(Gorter &amp;amp; Grendel, 1925). Moreover, it contains almost 50 % w/w of proteins in its lipid core 

(Singer &amp;amp; Nicolson, 1972) and shows structural and functional heterogeneity, as proposed by 

the so called ‘lipid-raft model’ (Simons &amp;amp; Ikonen, 1997) – fig. 1. 

 

Fig. 1: Schematic representation of the ‘lipid-raft’ model. (van Meer et al, 2008). 

*1.1. PROTEIN INTERACTION WITH LIPID MEMBRANES 

Proteins are polymers of amino-acids folded in a unique manner which defines their function 

and specificity. Several levels of protein organization can be distinguished. At a first level, 

individual amino-acids are covalently attached through amide linkage forming polypeptide 

sequences. An amino-acid sequence then folds due to free rotation of the amino and acid 

groups and consequent interaction between close neighbors (mainly hydrogen bonds) forming 

secondary motifs (fig. 2.A) – ?-helix, ?-sheet and ?-turns. Further folding is driven by 

hydrophobic forces and stabilized by salt bridges and disulfide bonds, which bring in close 

proximity distant parts of the sequence (fig. 2.B). The overall structure of the protein is 

therefore dependent on the size, orientation and specific amino-acid sequence, determining 



Theoretical Introduction

the general function of the protein. While there are plenty of small monomeric proteins, some 

of these can be used as subunits to form major complex multi-domain structures. In many 

cases, the subunits preserve their original function and the resulting protein complex exhibits 

increased functionality (fig. 2.C).

and ? subunit respectively (PDB ID 1GZX). 

The wide variety of proteins found in the cell takes part in a complex network of interactions 

which very often are responsible for the sensing and transduction of signals from and into the 

cell. Therefore, in the membrane, one can find different sets of integral and membrane-

anchoring proteins which facilitate those processes. Integral membrane proteins are 

embedded in the lipid bilayer through hydrophobic domains such as ? barrels or ? helix 

bundles (fig. 3). On the other hand, anchoring proteins are soluble proteins with membrane 

binding domains which allow them to bind directly or indirectly to the lipid interface. 

In nature, a variety of membrane binding domains has evolved and they are an essential part 

of proteins like protein kinase C (PKC) (Takai et al, 1979), epsin (Ford et al, 2001) and 

amphiphysin (Lichte et al, 1992). Although different binding domains have the same 

functionality, the anchoring mechanism to the membrane can be different. For example, 

plekstrin homology domain (PH) specifically binds to phosphatidylinositol (PI) by amphipatic 

helixes (Manna et al, 2007) while FYVE domains do it through coordinated zinc ions (Gaullier et 

al, 1998). Epsin N-terminal homology domain (ENTH) binds specifically to PI(4,5)P2 by positively 



 
 

 
5 

charged pockets in its structure (Ford et al, 2001). On the other hand, BAR domains (Bin-

Amphiphysin-Rvs) can interact with the membrane through electrostatic interaction (Henne et 

al, 2007) or anchor to the bilayer through rather hydrophobic amino acid residues (Gallop et al, 

2006). Besides the ‘specific’ nature of membrane-protein interaction, one should take into 

account rather unspecific interactions raised by the chemical nature of both components.

- 1.1.1. CHOLERA TOXIN 

Cholera toxin (Ctx) is the enterotoxin secreted by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, resulting in 

the massive fluid release characteristic to the cholera infection (Middlebrook &amp;amp; Dorland, 

1984). This toxin exhibits a heterohexameric ??5 arrangement (Mr = 85.620 kDa) (fig. 4). The 

five identical ? subunits (CtxB5) (fig. 4.A) which are arranged in a highly stable pentameric ring 

(Zhang et al, 1995), are responsible for the toxin binding to the cell surface. The natural 

receptor of the toxin is a sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipid – ganglioside GM1 (fig. 5) which 

is localized on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelial cells (Sattler et al, 1978). The five 

binding sites are equivalent and have a dissociation constant (KD) in the order of 10
-9

 / 10
-10 

M 

(Fishman et al, 1978; Ludwig et al, 1986; Reed et al, 1987). The ? subunit of Ctx is a loosely 

folded chain composed of disulfide-linked segments ?1 and ?2 aligned through the central 

CtxB5 pore that has ADP-ribosilation activity (fig. 4.C). The ? chain is cleaved by bacterial 

endoprotease prior to internalization (Tomasi et al, 1979) and the ?1 peptide crosses the cell 

membrane (Mekalanos et al, 1979) and disrupts cell signaling cascades (Holmgren, 1981; 

Galloway &amp;amp; van Heyningen, 1987; Peterson &amp;amp; Ochoa, 1989). 

Therefore, CtxB5 binding to GM1 is widely studied as a model of multivalent lipid-protein 

binding (e.g. Shi et al, 2007; Sorre et al, 2009). The specificity of the interaction also allows the 

use of CtxB5  as a tool in GM1 distribution studies in different lipid membrane models (e.g. Rock 

et al, 1991; de Almeida et al, 2005). Additionally, due to apparent preferential distribution of 

GM1 into ordered phases (Vié et al, 1998; Yuan &amp;amp; Johnston, 2000; Menke et al, 2002) cholera

- 1.1.2. STREPTAVIDIN 

Streptavidin, the bacterial equivalent of the hen egg-white protein avidin, is a tetrameric 

protein (fig. 6) with extraordinary ligand binding affinity (Kd ? 10

 M) (Chaiet &amp;amp; Wolf, 1964) to 

biotin (fig. 7). Each monomer is folded in a simple ?-barrel structure (fig. 6.A) with eight 

strands in a right-handed helical course and it is stabilized through hydrogen-bonds 

(Hendrickson et al, 1989). The quaternary structure with dihedral D2 molecular symmetry 

arises from intermolecular hydrophobic interactions between specific segments of ?-strands in 

each monomer. Biotin binds streptavidin quite deeply in the barrel and only carboxylate 

oxygens and ureido-ring nitrogen protrude to the outside. Carboxylate groups of biotins bound

in neighbouring streptavidin subunits are separated by a constant distance of ? 20 Å. This 

structural characteristic might impose a limit to the nature of conjugating groups used in 

different binding assays. Many evidences from the native X-ray structure and different point 

mutation approaches suggest that biotin binding is stabilized by numerous van der Waals 

interactions and hydrogen-bonds evolving the numerous tryptophan residues buried in the 

barrels (e.g. Hendrickson et al, 1989; Sano &amp;amp; Cantor, 1995; Hyre et al, 2006). 

The biological function of streptavidin and avidin is poorly understood and most of the studies 

on these proteins are performed for a better understanding of the chemical basis of the 

extreme avidity for biotin and its exploitation in several biotechnological applications, as well 

as their optimization (e.g. Diamandis &amp;amp; Christopoulos, 1991; Livnah et al, 1993; Nordlund et al, 

2003; Laitinen et al, 2007; Vogel &amp;amp; Schwille, 2012; Heinemann et al, 2013). 

2. LIPID SYSTEMS FOR IN VITRO STUDIES 

In the last few decades, a number of in vitro methods have been developed that allow the 

investigation of different biological processes under defined and controlled conditions. A 

variety of minimal membrane systems (reviewed in Arumugam et al, 2011), as giant 

unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) (Angelova &amp;amp; Dimitrov, 1986; Merkle et al, 2008; Herold et al, 2012), 

supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) (Tamm &amp;amp; McConnell, 1985; Chiantia et al, 2006) and lipid 

monolayers (Fidelio et al, 1981; McConnell et al, 1984; Bianco et al, 1989; Brockman, 1999), 

allow the study of lipid-protein interactions down to a single-molecule level. These systems, 

though highly simplified in their composition and topography, when properly employed, retain 

the core of the interaction under investigation and minimize the number of variables in the 

analysis. 

* 2.1. LIPID ORGANIZATION 

Lipids are a broad group of naturally occurring molecules which include fats, waxes, sterols, 

vitamins, mono-, di- and triglycerides and phospholipids. The major components of lipid 

membranes are phospholipids and sterols (fig. 8). The exact composition of the lipid bilayer is 

not only greatly variable between species, but it can be also specific to particular tissues in the 

same organism and even asymmetric between both leaflets of the same lipid bilayer. 

Membranes are formed by spontaneous self-organization of lipid molecules. Due to their 

amphipathic nature – these molecules have one polar group which coordinates preferentially 

with the water (hydrophilic) and one non-polar group (fig. 8), which is buried in the 

hydrophobic core of the bilayer. The character of the lipid molecule depends therefore on the 

balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic moiety of the lipid. Hence a common way to 

characterize lipids is through the determination of the partitioning coefficient of a particular 

lipid in between oil-water suspension. 



Theoretical Introduction

Fig. 8: Structure of representative molecules of common membrane lipid groups – A. DOPC 

(phospholipid) and B. Cholesterol (sterol). Lipid amphipathic nature is depicted by different colors – red 

for hydrophobic regions and blue for polar areas. 

Besides the amphipathicity of lipid molecules, another factor playing an important role in the 

membrane assembly is a theoretical lipid shape. It is called 'shape factor' S and it depends on 

molecule dimensions as well as on the chemical nature of the headgroup, according to: 

                   (eq. 1) 

where V is the volume of the molecule, A0 is the ‘optimal’ area of the lipid headgroup taking 

into account its dimensions and chemical properties of the molecule and LC is the length of the 

straight acyl chain. Pure lipids of different shapes form spontaneously different phases (fig. 9): 

when S &gt; 1 (conical shape) the inverted HII phase is favorable (inverted micelle); for S = 1 

(cylindrical shape), lamellar structures as bilayers are formed; when S &amp;lt;1 (inverted conical 

shape) micelles are formed. A0 parameter is mostly dependent on the molecules charge, which 

can change with the protonation state of the head group. Hence it is directly related to the pH. 

On the other hand, in case of phospholipids, the LC and AH parameters are mainly dependent 

on the saturation of the acyl chains. In nature, membranes are formed by a wide variety of 

lipid species of different shape factors. Therefore, it is plausible to form lamellar structures by 

compensation of conical shapes of one lipid species by the inverted conical shape of another, 

resulting in a net S ~ 1.

lipid molecule. B. Representation of lipids with different shape factor S – cone shaped (left), cylindrical 

shape (center) and inverted cone shape (right). (Chwastek, 2013) 

The properties of the lamellar phase formed by lipids are temperature dependent. Thus, it is 

possible to distinguish different lipid organizational order, so called 'phases' (fig. 10) – fluid or 

liquid disordered (ld), gel phase or ordered solid (gel) and liquid ordered phase (lo). Under 

 



 
 

 
9 

physiological conditions, the most representative phase of biological membranes is the ld 

phase. The bilayer in this phase is relatively thinner and lipid molecules show high lateral 

mobility. Lipid chains are mostly in a gauche conformation or have cis-double bonds which 

lead to a less tight packing in the plain of the membrane and an apparent shortening of the 

acyl chains (de Almeida &amp;amp; Loura, 2004). With the lowering of the temperature, at certain point 

(called phase transition temperature - Tm), lipids undergo change in their packing which results 

in an abrupt reduction of the acyl chain mobility. The highest order of lipid takes place in the 

so-called gel phase. In this phase, the thickness of the membrane is maximal and lipids are 

tightly packed due to the presence of ordered acyl chains in trans conformation. This leads to 

almost complete arrest of lateral lipid diffusion. The intermediate lo phase, on the other hand, 

though it is characterized by a high lipid order, still retains lipid diffusion (Chiantia et al, 2006). 

In contrast to gel and ld phases that are found for all pure lipids, lo phase is characteristic of 

mixed bilayers, especially those containing sterols. Generally, this phase forms domains, so 

called 'lipid rafts', in a ld matrix. There is a growing number of evidence pointing towards the 

biological importance of this phenomenon, especially as an important mechanism in the 

regulation of signaling pathways in the cell (Simons &amp;amp; Ikonen, 1997).

* 2.2. LIPID MONOLAYERS 

Historically, lipid monolayers are described as the first lipid systems which originate from the 

natural lipid spreading at the water-air interface and thin layer formation over available 

surfaces (reviewed in Dynarowicz-Latka et al, 2001). The major advances in the field occurred 

during the 19th century: Irving Langmuir studied the surface pressure dependence on 

molecular density of individual lipids at the water-air interface and, with Katherine Blodgett, 

developed the lipid film transfer method on to solid surfaces – Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. 

Despite the technological and scientific advances which took place in the field in the 20th 



Theoretical Introduction 

 

 
10 

century, the principle of the method remains the same – molecules with amphipathic 

properties, when deposited on a water-air interface, spontaneously orient themselves in a way 

that minimizes the overall energy of the system, i.e. the more hydrophilic part of the molecule 

coordinates with the water subphase whereas the hydrophobic part sticks out towards the air 

(fig. 11).  

Modern Langmuir-Blodgett troughs are composed of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) 

container, movable barriers and a micro-balance (fig. 12). The surface pressure (?) is measured 

through a thin plate of platinum or ash-free filter paper (called Wilhelmy plate) attached to the 

micro-balance and immersed in the subphase (Martin &amp;amp; Szablewski, 2004). When the ? of the 

monolayer varies, the Wilhelmy plate is exposed to the corresponding force (F) given by 

equation 2, generated by the surface tension (ST) change due to rearrangement of lipid 

packing: 

  (     )  (     )   (   )(  )          (eq. 2) 

where ?P and ?L are respectively the plate and subphase densities, l/w/t 

(length/width/thickness) are the plate dimensions, dwt (where d is the depth of immersion) 

are the upthrust volume (fig. 13), g represents the gravity and the last term describes the 

change in ST. Since ? is the change in surface tension and the sum of both these parameters is 

constant, it is thus possible to follow ? variation. 

 

 

Fig. 11: Schematic representation of lipid deposition on an air-

water interface, forming a lipid monolayer. Subphase water 

molecules penetrate the monolayer to some extent coordinating 

with the polar headgroups. The hydrophobic acyl chains are 

completely excluded from water subphase sticking out towards 

the air. (Chwastek, 2013)

(Chwastek, 2013) 



 
 

 
11 

Thus, knowing that ST in standard conditions is 72.8 mN/m, it is possible to calculate ?. As the 

weight plate and the upthrust (first and second term respectively) are constant during the 

measurement and ? (contact angle of the subphase to the plate) is 0 
o
 for Wilhelmy plates, eq. 

2 can be simplified to eq.3: 

                            (eq. 3) 

Although the system lacks essential features of a biological membrane, it enables a fine tuning 

of parameters hardly accessible for a constant lipid composition in bilayer assays – such as lipid 

packing and surface pressure – which are of great relevance for every lipid-protein interaction. 

Despite the validation of lipid monolayers in protein binding assays (Brockman, 1999), this 

classical model system has rather been neglected in recent membrane research due to its 

restricted applications. Importantly, most of the commercially available troughs are not 

compatible with confocal microscopes, being limited to ? monitoring. On the other hand, the 

relatively big subphase volume needed for each monolayer experiment (? 100 mL) demands 

huge amounts of purified protein, which renders the applicability in biological studies. Despite 

the possibility of overcoming these problems through LB films usage, their properties might be 

influenced by both the solid support and the transfer process.

Wilhelmy plate – its dimensions and

* 2.3. NEW MINIATURIZED SYSTEM 

Very recently, Chwastek and Schwille proposed a small and versatile monolayer setup which 

allows the combination of confocal microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy with 

lipid monolayers (fig. 14) (Chwastek &amp;amp; Schwille, 2013). 

This setup is constituted of a PTFE spacer, with a hole of 15 mm diameter, glued to a glass 

cover slip. A small volume of subphase (? 200 µL) is added to the chamber on top of which 

defined volumes of chloroform lipid solutions are deposited and form lipid monolayers (see 

Methods; fig. 15). This small chamber volume renders it useful for application in protein-

binding assays as well, in which only limited amount of material is available. On the other 

hand, in contrast to standard monolayer technique, where ? measurement is performed, the 

physical state of the monolayer is monitored by measurement of the diffusion coefficient (D) 

through fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (see section 3.3. and Methods). This 

parameter is commonly used to characterize lipid packing in model membrane systems (Kahya 

et al, 2003; Chiantia et al, 2009). In monolayers, it has been theoretically predicted (Galla et al, 

1979) and experimentally shown (Gudmand et al, 2009) that D varies linearly with the mean

3. FLUORESCENCE-BASED METHODS 

Current biological research is highly focused on the physico-chemical characterization of 

elementary processes at the level of single molecules. Among techniques used in these 

studies, highly sensitive and non-invasive fluorescence-based methods are one of the most 

popular. 

* 3.1. FLUORESCENCE 

All substances absorb energy in form of light resulting in the excitation of molecules or atoms 

to a higher quantum state. The spontaneous relaxation to the ground state is accompanied by 

light emission – luminescence. According to Jablonski’s diagram (fig. 16.A), depending on the 

quantum nature of the relaxation phenomena, luminescence can be classified in 

phosphorescence and fluorescence. Phosphorescence occurs in the millisecond to second time 



 
 

 
13 

scale and results from the intersystem crossing conversion (ICC) to the triplet state. 

Fluorescence, on the other hand, is a much faster process – in the nanosecond regime – which 

is the result of the relaxation from a singlet excited state to the ground state S0. (Reviewed in 

Valeur, 2002; Lakowicz, 2006) 

The energy of the emitted photons is in general lower than the absorbed one due to fast non-

radiative internal conversion (IC), not only from S2 to S1 states but also from higher vibrational 

states to the ground level of S1. Moreover, the relaxation often occurs to higher vibrational 

levels of S0. This energy loss results in a red shift of the emission spectrum relative to the 

excitation spectrum known as Stokes’ shift (fig. 16.B). 

 

Fig. 16: A. Jablonski diagram. Light absorption is accompanied by atom/molecule excitation to one of the 

vibration levels (depicted by 0, 1, 2 and 3) of the singlet excited states S1 (b) or S2 (a). Excited molecules 

undergo internal conversion (IC) to the ground vibrational level of S1 (c). From S1 further relaxation can 

occur by direct light emission through fluorescence (d) or intersystem crossing conversion (ICC) to the 

triplet state T1 I, a much slower process. From T1, energy is released as phosphorescence. Both 

phenomena might be therefore distinguished by their lifetime – in the nanosecond time scale for 

fluorescence compared to the second time scale for phosphorescence. B. Emission and excitation 

spectra for a fluorophore. The red shift of the emission spectra (Stoke’s shift) are due to the energy loss 

in the non-radiative processes (IC and ICC). (Chwastek, 2013) 

The main parameters, which should be considered when using fluorescent probes in biological 

studies are the absorption cross-section, quantum yield (Q) and fluorescence lifetime which 

should be suitable to the experimental design. The quantum yield is given by the ratio of the 

number of emitted photons (Dr – rate of S1 to S0 decay) to the total number of observed 

photons (Dr + Dnon, where Dnon is the rate of all the processes leading to non-radiative energy 

dissipation) – eq. 4. Fluorescence lifetime is the average time which molecules/atoms stay in 

the excited state. Moreover, for membrane probing, both in vivo and in vitro, fluorescent dyes 

must be amphipathic or hydrophobic in order to incorporate into lipid membranes allowing its 

characterization. The partition coefficient (Kp) is often used to report probes preference to 

incorporate into lipid membranes or specific lipid phases. 

  
  

       
           (eq. 4) 

 



Theoretical Introduction

* 3.2. Confocal microscopy 

The basic concept of confocal microscopy was originally developed by Marvin Minsky in the 

middle of 16th century. In 1979, G. Fred Brakhenhoff developed the first scanning confocal 

microscope and two decades later appeared the first commercial instruments. Since then, 

many technological and theoretical advances were made to improve resolution and versatility 

of confocal microscopes. (Reviewed in Claxton et al, 2005) 

Though confocal microscopy provides only a marginal improvement in both axial and lateral 

optical resolution, the greatest innovation over widefield microscopy is the elimination of out-

of-focus light or glare in thick samples (over the immediate plane of focus) through the use of 

spatial filtering techniques. Thus, the laser beam (excitation source) passes through a pinhole 

aperture localized in a confocal conjugate plane with the scanning point in the sample and a 

second pinhole aperture positioned in front of the photomultiplier tube (detector) – fig. 17.A. 

During sample scanning with the laser, reflected by a dichromatic mirror, secondary 

fluorescence emitted from points on the sample pass back through the dichromatic mirror and 

are focused as a confocal point at the detector pinhole aperture. As only a small fraction of the 

out-of-focus emission is delivered through the pinhole aperture, being rather projected onto 

the aperture as Airy disks. Therefore, most of this extraneous light is not detected by the 

photomultiplier and does not contribute in the image formation. 

Importantly, the focusing mechanism of laser illumination in confocal microscopy also allows 

reduction the focal volume (fig. 17.B) – the laser light is first expanded to fill the objective rear 

aperture, and then focused by the lens system to a very small point in the focal plane. 

 

Fig. 17: A. Schematic representation of the optical 

pathway and the main components in a laser 

scanning confocal microscope. B. Widefield versus 

confocal microscopy illumination volumes, 

demonstrating the difference between widefield 

excitation and point scanning light beams. (Claxton 

et al, 2005) 

 

In laser scanning confocal microscopy the focused beam is scanned across the defined sample 

area in a raster pattern controlled by two-high speed oscillating mirrors driven with 

galvanometer motors, allowing for the formation of images of extended samples. 

In the whole, confocal microscopy is advantageous over conventional widefield optical 

microscopy as it offers the ability to control depth of field, to eliminate or highly reduce the 

background information and to collect serial optical sections from thick samples.

* 3.3. FLUORESCENCE CORRELATION SPECTROSCOPY 

Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) principle was introduced for the first time by 

Magde, Elson and Webb in 1972 (Reviewed in Schwille &amp;amp; Haustein, 2002). Unlike other 

fluorescence techniques, FCS primary parameter of interest is not the fluorescence intensity 

but rather its fluctuations which appear due to the system stochastic deviations from thermal 

equilibrium. Therefore, FCS is based on the time correlation of fluorescent signal fluctuations 

induced by the fluorophore movement in and out of the detection volume (fig. 18). The 

acquired signal is characteristic to particular particle species and conditions. In order to resolve 

the movement of single molecules, measurements are usually conducted at very low dye 

concentration to avoid the saturation of the detection volume. The implementation of 

confocal detection to the FCS setup by Rigler and co-workers allowed the reduction of the 

detection volume below one femtoliter (Rigler et al, 1999). The consequent reduction of the 

average number of detected molecules enables FCS measurement at higher biologically 

relevant concentrations. Its applicability is nonetheless limited by the resolution scale (&gt; 200 

nm) and still sets an upper limit for label concentrations. An alternative arises from the 

combination of FCS and fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (FIDA) with sub-diffraction-

resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy (Kastrup et al, 2005; Ringemann et 

al, 2009). This approach, with an effective observational area down to 20-30 nm in diameter 

(note that the selective deactivation of fluorophores accomplished by double pulse of light 

enables image enhancement in the region), allows the study of nano-scale dynamics and may 

be applied to larger, often endogenous concentrations. 

 

Fig. 18: Principles of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). A. Fluorophores (grey) diffuse 

randomly into the focal spot (pink) where the laser beam (red) is strongly focused. Fluorophores start 

immediately to emit light (green) as a result of the absorbed energy. B. Detected signal is directly 

related to the number of fluorescent molecules in the focal spot. (Numbers at the graph correspond to 

the numbers at the drawings.) (Chwastek, 2013) 

In theory, the fluorescence fluctuations ?F(t) are deviations from the average fluorescence 

signal and corresponds to the average number of particles.

Theoretical Introduction 

 

 
16 

Assuming that fluorophores undergo Brownian motion, one can conclude that the number of 

molecules in the focal volume, hence the fluorescence intensity, depends strongly on the 

mobility of particles. Therefore, fluorophore diffusion determines the characteristic decay of 

the temporal autocorrelation function. 

The detection volume – effective focal volume Veff – is a three dimensional Gaussian 

approximation (eq. 7), where r0 is the waist of the focal spot at which the Gaussian 

approximation of the emitted light decays to 1/e
2
 and z0 is the dimension along the z axis. 

      
 

    
              (eq. 7) 

The autocorrelation function which describes the diffusion of fluorescent specie has a 

following form 

 ( )  
 

       
(  

 

  
)  (  

 
  
  

 
  

)   ?        (eq. 8) 

where Veff&lt;C&gt; is the average number of molecules&amp;lt;N&gt; in the focal volume and ?D is the 

characteristic diffusion time of the fluorescent species. By knowing the diffusion coefficient of 

the molecule it is possible to estimate the dimension of Veff using the relation:  

   
  
 

  
           (eq. 9) 

Further, by bringing together the number of particles and the estimated detection volume one 

can extrude the concentration of the fluorophore (eq. 10). 

 ( )  
 

   
 

 

        
         (eq. 10) 

For a more accurate description of the fluorescence signal fluctuations, besides molecule 

motion, one needs to consider other fluorescence aspects that might interfere with the 

measured signal (fig. 19). 

The inherent fluorophore blinking due to ICC from S1 to T1 interferes with fluctuation arose 

from lateral mobility of the fluorophore. This phenomenon can be taken into account in the 

autocorrelation function  

( )  
 

   
(  

 

   
     ? )(  

 

  
)  (  

 

    
)   ?       (eq. 11) 

where T corresponds to the triplet fraction, ?T the diffusion time, S is the structural parameter 

defined by the ratio     ?  and the triplet blinking is described by an exponential decay 

(Schwille et al, 2000). This three dimensional model can be also applied to two dimensional 

situation (like in case of lipid membrane) since S approaches zero: 

( )  
 

   
(  

 

   
     ? )(  

 

  
)          (eq. 12) 

As a result the detection volume in this two dimensional model is approximated by a circle 

allowing to exclude the third term of the 3D model. Notice that thermal instability of the 

membrane may induce additional fluorescence fluctuation in the 2D situation especially when 



 
 

 
17 

applied to free-standing membranes which might move in and out of the focal spot. Thus an 

additional component describing these fluctuations (F fraction with ?F diffusion time) should be 

used (Petrov &amp;amp; Schwille, 2008) – eq. 13.

Fig. 19: Influence of different factor on the shape of the autocorrelation curve. A. An autocorrelation 

curve presents characteristic amplitude G(0) and ?1 diffusion time – (a). In presence of higher 

concentration of the same fluorophore specie (b), even though the overall signal increases, the 

amplitude of the correlation drops (G’(0)) accordingly with the equations 8 and 10. Importantly, the 

characteristic diffusion time is retained. On the other hand, a fluorophore in the same concentration as 

in (a) but with lower mobility will raise a curve with the same amplitude G(0) but shifted towards longer 

diffusion times – (c). B. Influence of triplet blinking and membrane undulations – for a fluorophore with 

a characteristic diffusion time ?D (b), its triplet state will appear at shorter lag times (?T – (a)), as blinking 

is a much faster process in comparison to lateral diffusion of the molecule; the relatively slow process of 

membrane undulations will give rise to and additional slow component – ?F (c). (Chwastek, 2013)

perchlorate (DiO – D3898) were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). In figure 1 are 

represented the spectra of the dyes used in the main studies. Consumables and machinery are 

indicated in the next sections. 

2. LIPID HANDLING 

Lipids were stored at -20 
o
C in chloroform (1.02447.0500 – Merck kGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) 

filled with argon to prevent oxidation and sealed with silicon tape to prevent evaporation. On a 

daily basis, the lipid concentration was estimated by gravimetric method. Stock solution 

concentrations which were suspected to be changed over time were determined using 

Rouser’s modified method. 

3. ROUSER’S METHOD 

This method is based on molibdate ability to form complexes with free phosphorus under 

acidic conditions. Phospholipids are decomposed into CO2, H2O and PO3
4-

 when incubated at 

high temperature in perchloric acid. The resulting orthophosphate forms phosphomolybdate 

(VI) [(NH4)3Pmo12O40] in presence of molybdenum ammonium under acidic conditions. This 

compound is reduced by ascorbic acid to a mixture of molybdenum oxides (IV) and (VI) MoO2 x 

MoO3 – molybdenum blue. The amount of the later is estimated by absorption measurement. 

Note that this method cannot be used to measure lipid suspensions containing phosphates as 

all the inorganic phosphorus will contribute for the total mass of measured phosphorus. 

Lipids (10 to 100nmols) were pipetted to glass test-tubes. After complete solvent evaporation, 

500 µL of water and 300 µL of perchloric acid were added. Short vortexing was proceeded by a 

3 hour incubation time at 180 
o
C to assure full lipid mineralization and complete phosphorus 

release.

% w/v) were added to the test tube. After vortexing, test-tubes were kept at 100 
o
C for 15 min. 

After cooling down under the tap water stream, absorption at 812 nm was measured with a 

spectrophotometer (Varian, Cary). Simultaneously with the analyzed samples, a standard curve 

was prepared, using a phosphorus standard solution instead of lipids. 

4. SURFACE PRESSURE (?) – AREA (A) ISOTHERMS 

Standard isotherms were measured using NIMA 112 Langmuir-Blodgett trough equipped with 

micro-balance. Before use, the trough was thoroughly cleaned with Kimptech paper tissues 

sequentially soaked in chloroform (C/4960/17 – Fisher Scientific, Leics, UK) and ethanol (32205 

– Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), and dried in between with clean tissue, in three rounds. During 

the cleaning procedure, powder free gloves were used. Subsequently, the trough was 

repeatedly (three times) filled with pure water and the water-air interface was vacuum 

cleaned. A Wilhelmy plate made of ash-free filtration paper was attached to the microbalance 

and let to soak for 15 min. After reaching the equilibrium, barriers were closed with a speed of 

150 cm
2
/min and the surface pressure at the air/water interface was monitored. The system 

was considered ready for use if the surface pressure through the whole closing process (from 

80 cm
2
 to 25-30 cm

2
) would not vary more than 0.3 mN/m. Otherwise, the washing steps 

would be repeated. 

Isotherms of lipid mixtures were measured from a starting zero surface pressure with a 

compression rate of 5 cm
2
/min. The typical lipid concentration was 1 mg/mL. Each lipid 

mixture was measured at least twice, both on water and on buffer used later for the subphase. 

5. MICRO-CHAMBER FOR MONOLAYER STUDIES 

Chamber spacers were cut from 2 mm thick sheet of PTFE by a laser cutter (Trotec Laser Inc., 

Ypsilanti, MI, USA). Glass cover slips 24 x 24 mm
2
 with 150 µm thickness (Gerhard Menzel 

GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) were fixed to the spacer by glue. Prior to use, chambers were 

washed interchangeably with ethanol and water, dried with stream of nitrogen and then 

plasma-cleaned for 10 min, so the glass surface acquires hydrophilic character. For protein 

assays, the chambers were further incubated with 2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) 

solution for 30 min in order to passivate the glass surface and prevent protein deposition. 

Buffer filled chambers (200 µL of SLB buffer – 10 nM HEPES (05288.100 – BIOMOL GmbH, 

Hamburg, Germany), 150mM NaCl (27810.295 – VWR International BVBA, Radnor, 

Pennsylvania), pH 7.4) were incubated at 40 
o
C for 5 min and lipid monolayers were deposited 

by drop-wise deposition of a chloroform solution of the desired lipid composition on the 

buffer–air interface (fig. 2.A-B). The typical lipid concentration was 0.1 mg/mL. After lipid 

deposition, the sample was covered by a 22 x 22 mm
2
 coverslip and allowed to cool down to 

room temperature (? 23 
o
C) at least for 5 min. A small volume was removed from the subphase 

to assure monolayer positioning in the range of the working distance of the objective (fig. 2.C-

D), usually 300 – 600 µm above the cover slip surface. Samples were imaged using a confocal 

laser scanning microscope (LSM 510, ConfoCor2/3, Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with an LD

C-Apochromat (40x, 1.1 NA) objective with a working distance of 0.62 mm. The focus was 

placed at the monolayer following laser scattering at the sample interfaces – the first intensity 

peak corresponds to the water glass-interface (the lower surface of the cover slip); the second 

to the scattering of the light at the glass-water interface (upper coverslip surface) and the 

upper reflection corresponds to the buffer-air interface. The right positioning was confirmed 

by monitoring the fluorescence intensity of the probe incorporated in the monolayer. All 

image analysis was done using ImageJ 1.47i.

Schwille, 2013). 

6. FCS MEASUREMENTS 

FCS measurements were performed using LSM 510 ConfoCor 2/3 microsocpe (Zeiss, Jena, 

Germany). Dichoric 288/543/633 mirror was used as a main beam splitter. Pinholes for APDs 

(Avalanche Photo Diodes) were set to 72 (for 488 nm laser line), 80 (for 543 nm laser line) and 

94 (for 633 nm laser line). Before each measurement the correction ring of the objective (LD C-

Apochromat 40x, 1.1 NA, 0.62 mm working distance) was adjusted to maximize the signal and 

the system pinhole positions were automatically adjusted using GUI, with the focus placed at 

the monolayer. 

For single measurements, 5 second independent traces were averaged (typically 20). Focus 

correction was necessary over the measurements due to evaporation caused by increased 

temperature and altered traces were removed from analysis. Data were fitted using Zeiss 

software after discarding traces over which focus correction was done. Since monolayers are 

very prone to mechanical instability and inherent undulations due to thermal fluctuations it 

was necessary to fit a two-component two-dimensional diffusion model with a triplet state 

(eq. 13) in order to correct for the additional slow component appearing in the correlation 

curve. Nevertheless, only data in which the slow component was smaller than 5 % were 

considered. The faster component was used to determine the diffusion time of the lipid dye. In 

order to calculate the lipid diffusion coefficient, the system was calibrated with Alexa 488 and 

Alexa 546 dyes which diffusion coefficient are known – 435 µm
2
/s and 341 µm

2
/s respectively 

(Petrasek &amp;amp; Schwille, 2008). In this case, correlation curves were fitted to one component 



 
 

 
23 

three dimensional diffusion model with a triplet state (eq. 12) and the focal waist was 

calculated according to equation 9. 

7. PROTEIN BINDING ASSAY 

The protein solution (in SLB buffer) was applied by dipping the pipette tip through the 

monolayer. After 1 min period of incubation the excess added volume was removed by dipping 

the pipette tip. Protein FCS was measured at the interface as previously described (see FCS 

measurements) 

As FCS data did not allow for proper correlation analysis due to fluctuations in the fluorescence 

signal originating mainly from protein aggregation upon binding, another approach was used. 

Count rate obtained during FCS measurement was used as an estimation of the amount of the 

protein bound to the monolayer and freely diffusing in the solution – eq. 14, where IF and I0 

represent the intensity of emitted light and the light source respectively, k’ is the logarithmic 

conversion of the geometrical/instrumental factor G, Q is the quantum yield, ? the molar 

absorptivity, l the sample length and c its concentration. 

    
                  (eq. 14) 

For that, it was assumed that the fluorescence collected at the interface has an apparent 

intensity (Capp) as the measured signal has a complex nature. In an ideal case, the focal spot is 

positioned in such a way that the monolayer is exactly in the middle of the focal spot Veff (fig. 

3) so that the upper part is above the monolayer and the lower one is below the interface. 

Thus, the collected Capp  is a sum of the signal from the monolayer itself (Cinter) and the signal 

from the lower part of the focal volume, which corresponds to half of the intensity collected in 

the subphase (Csub). Therefore, 

            
    

 
? .         (eq. 15) 

Finally, to express protein binding to the monolayer, the ratio           ?  was used. 

 

Fig. 3: Schematic representation of Veff positioning in relation to the monolayer (grey). A. When the focal 

spot is positioned at the interface, ideally the monolayer is oriented in a way that results in the 

submersion of a half of the Veff in the subphase. Capp is therefore a sum of Cinter and Csub/2. B. Positioning 

of the focus of the laser beam in the subphase allows the collection of signal coming only from the 

protein in solution. (Chwastek, 2013)

8. DISSOCIATION CONSTANT (KD) DETERMINATION 

To determine the dissociation constant, the lipid monolayer was titrated with protein by 

adding successively increasing protein concentrations to the subphase. As previously, protein 

was applied in 100 µL aliquots in SLB buffer and excess volume was removed after 1 min 

incubation. At each step, APD system was used to measure protein fluorescence intensity in 

the subphase and at the interface. The measurement was terminated once the saturation 

plateau was reached. Collected data were plotted versus initial protein concentration, knowing 

the concentration of used protein solution and assuming the subphase volume was constant 

over the duration of the experiment. Assuming protein fluorescence intensity proportional to 

protein concentration, fitting the Hill equation to a plot of protein intensity at the surface 

against total protein concentration allows determination of protein KD (Shi et al, 2007). 

Applying it for monolayers, fluorescence intensity at the monolayer level (F) is a sigmoidal 

function of protein concentration (x) as described by equation 16, where Fmax is the maximum 

fluorescence intensity at the interface and n is the Hill coefficient, which describes 

cooperativity of the interaction.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

1. LIPID MIXTURE CHARACTERIZATION 

* 1.1. ?-A ISOTHERMS 

In order to study the influence of lipid packing on lipid-protein interactions, a lipid monolayer 

approach was chosen. Due to the risk of lipid oxidation by carbon-chain exposure to air after 

lipid deposition in the air-water interface, fully saturated DMPC was used as a representative 

glycerophospholipid. Even though the Tm (? 23 
o
C) (reviewed in Koynova &amp;amp; Caffrey, 1998) is 

very close to the room temperature (? 23.3 
o
C), it is predicted that the DMPC monolayer 

presents as homogeneous fluid phase – liquid extended (LE). Only at high surface pressures 

near the collapsing point of the monolayer, it should be possible to obtain a solid phase (S). 

The surface pressure (?)-area (A) isotherms obtained either on water or on buffer (fig. 1) go in 

agreement with those described in literature (Sabatini et al, 2008; Wilke et al, 2010). The 

isotherm compression is accompanied by an increase in surface pressure till monolayer 

collapses around 45 MMA (mean molecular area, in Å
2
). The absence of a plateau or a sudden 

change in the isotherm points towards a homogeneous LE phase in the whole range of 

compression. Also, the used SLB buffer shows no apparent influence in the isotherm shape and 

lipid behavior. 

 

Fig. 1: Representative ?-A isotherms of DMPC, DMPC:GM1 99:1 and DMPC:DOPE-Ncap-Biotin 95:5 on 

water (A) and on SLB buffer (B) subphase. The arrows point possible phase transitions from LE to S for 

non-pure DMPC monolayers and the * corresponds to the collapsing region of the monolayers.  

Besides the characterization of pure DMPC monolayer, mixtures containing small percentage 

of GM1 and DOPE-Ncap-Biotin were analyzed in order to study the effect of specific ligand on 

protein-monolayer interaction for choleratoxin and streptavidin, respectively. 5 mol % DOPE-

Ncap-Biotin and 1 mol % GM1 were used in order to ensure monolayer homogeneity (Rock et al, 

1991; Shi et al, 2007). The respective isotherms (fig. 1), both on water and on buffer, were 

slightly shifted to higher surface pressures. The effect of GM1, even though in smaller molar 

percentage, was superior to that of DOPE-Ncap-Biotin, especially on buffer, most probably due 

to its large area/volume occupied by the head group of this lipid (65 Å
2
 for GM1 compared to 

42.5 Å
2 

for DMPC). Even though, the critical area at which the collapse pressure is reached 

didn’t suffer any change with the presence of both GM1 and DOPE-Ncap-Biotin, as it would be

26 

expected from the small concentration in which they are present. Moreover, in accordance 

with published data for other lipid mixtures containing GM1 (Yuan &amp;amp; Johnston, 2000; Kycia et al, 

2011), the shape of the isotherm was not heavily modified, indicating a monolayer in LE phase 

up to ? 60 MMA. Around this value, for both mixtures a small kink in the isotherm was 

observed which can be an evidence for a phase transition to the S state. Once again, the SLB 

buffer did not show any major impact on shape of isotherms. 

* 1.2. STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION 

For further characterization, monolayers at different MMA were imaged using to miniaturized 

chambers coupled with confocal microscopy (Chwastek &amp;amp; Schwille, 2013). As a fluorescent 

dye, Chol 542 was added to DMPC, DMPC:GM1 99:1 and DMPC:DOPE-Ncap-biotin 95:5 lipid 

mixtures at concentration which assure monolayer visualization and do not interfere with the 

monolayer organization. In accordance with previous studies, a Chol 542 concentration of 0.05 

mol % was used with no influence on the monolayer isotherm, as observed in control 

measurements (not shown). Lipid monolayer imaging (fig. 2) revealed that in the range of 

analyzed MMA (50 to 100 Å
2
), the three analyzed mixture have a mostly homogeneous 

deposition at the air-water interface. However both at low (100 MMA) and high (60 – 50 

MMA) pressures the monolayer shows slight variations. At 100 MMA, some rapidly diffusing 

gas domains (G) are still formed due to the small amount of lipids deposited at the interface 

and low surface tension resulted from loose molecular packing. On the other hand, with the 

increase in surface pressure, dye clusters tend to form. Moreover, some small non-defined 

domains can be found at 50 MMA. The presence of fast-diffusing domains due to air flow, 

sample tilt and microscope/table vibration may hamper APD usage for further studies as the 

stability of the signal is compromised. Nonetheless, whether pure DMPC or its mixtures with 

GM1 or DOPE-Ncap-Biotin, monolayers have a general homogeneous appearance, irrespectively 

from the type of subphase. Thus this system fulfills requirements for being used in FCS studies. 

* 1.3. DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT DETERMINATION 

In order to confirm the stability and reproducibility of the system, FCS studies were performed 

on DMPC monolayers deposited at different ? in a buffer-air interface, as previous studies 

showed a very small influence of SLB buffer on lipid diffusion (Chwastek &amp;amp; Schwille, 2013). To 

avoid APD saturation, a concentration of around 0.01 mol % Chol 542 was used. From the time 

correlation of the signal and its fitting to a 2D 2 component model (eq. 13), which accounts not 

only for the two dimensional diffusion of the dye, but also for the monolayer vibration and the 

fraction of particles that transit for the triplet state, lipid diffusion can be determined through 

equation 9. For that, a previous system calibration is needed – several dilutions of Alexa 546 (D 

= 341 µm
2
/s (Petrasek &amp;amp; Schwille, 2008)) were used to determine r0

2
 through correlation curve 

fitting to a 3D model (eq. 12). 

Previous studies have shown that an increased lipid density slows lipid mobility (Gudmand et 

al, 2009). This is also observed in the current system (Chwastek &amp;amp; Schwille, 2013), shifting the 

correlation curves towards slower diffusion times (fig. 3.A). Analyzing the corresponding 

diffusion coefficients as a function of MMA, a linear tendency is obtained as expected from the

free area model (FAM) (Galla et al, 1979) and previously experimentally proved (Gudmand et 

al, 2009; Chwastek &amp;amp; Schwille, 2013) (fig. 3.B). The intersection of the obtained linear fit with 

the horizontal axis corresponds to the theoretical MMA at which the lipid diffusion coefficient 

equals zero – critical point (ac). In the above experiment, ac was 36.0 ± 4.7 Å

deviates slightly from previously reported values for the same lipid (42.5 ± 7.5 Å
2
 (Chwastek &amp;amp; 

Schwille, 2013) / ? 47 Å
2
 (Gudmand et al, 2009)) most probably due to the error associated 

with the extreme points of the fit – 100 MMA when the presence of small gas phases can 

influence the measurements and at 50 MMA when the high pressure and formation of S phase 

may influence lipid deposition. Moreover, control experiments showed that the presence of 

GM1 or DOPE-Ncap-Biotin in the monolayer did not alter significantly lipid mobility (not shown).

and corresponding linear fit (dashed line). 

* 1.4. DYE DISTRIBUTION 

With the increase of lipid density at lower MMA, it is expected that the number of particles N 

in the focal volume Veff increases. Nonetheless, that was not observed in the performed 

experiments (fig. 4) – not only the distribution of the lipid dye was not increasing 

proportionally to ?, but also the fluorophore showed a non-homogeneous distribution within 

the monolayer. 

In order to address the problem of abnormal dye distribution it was first investigated whether 

the effect is was due to the dye sterol nature the Chol 542 label was substituted by an 

equivalent concentration of DiO – a lipophilic carbocyanine. On the other hand, given the 

DMPC Tm temperature in the range of the room temperature and the possibility of small 

temperature gradients within the monolayer caused by the laser heating, N variation with 

MMA in monolayers formed of phospholipids with lower Tm was also studied. Therefore pure 

DOPC, an unsaturated phospholipid with Tm = – 18 
o
C (reviewed in Koynova &amp;amp; Caffrey, 1998), 

labeled with 0.01 mol % Chol 542 was used in order to eliminate the influence of temperature.

Fig. 4: Variation of number of particles of Chol 542 N in a DMPC monolayer deposited at different lipid 

densities on a SLB buffer subphase. Values obtained through fitting of eq. 13 to the corresponding 

correlation curves. 

In both mixtures – DMPC 0.01 mol % DiO and DOPC 0.01 mol % Chol 542 – diffusion coefficient 

shows the same trend previously verified for DMPC 0.01 mol % Chol 542 – with increasing lipid 

density the lipid mobility decreases linearly (fig.5.A-B). The critical point is 37.2 ± 13.5 

Å
2
/molecule for DMPC (in agreement with the previous results) and 32.7 ± 12.7 Å

2
/molecule 

for DOPC. Having in mind its molecular area (72.2 Å
2 

obtained in SLBs at 30 
o
C (Tristram-Nagle 

et al, 1998)), the obtained ac value for DOPC is deviated from the expected, most probably due 

to errors at the extremes of lipid density in study (70 and 120 MMA). Note that the 

experiments presented here were performed at a lower temperature (23 
o
C) which should 

contribute for a lower ac as the thermal motion of the free rotating bonds is reduced. 

Nevertheless, the diffusion coefficient variation with lipid packing seems to be in good 

agreement with the predicted by FAM. Nevertheless, as for DMPC labeled with Chol 542, the 

number of fluorophore particles in the monolayer does not vary linearly with increased lipid 

density. So, neither fluorescent probe nor phospholipid nature seems to influence the 

detected number of particles. The study of probe partition in different lipid monolayers at 

increasing surface pressures could probably give a hint about the reason for its abnormal 

distribution within the monolayer. 

Nevertheless, the system appears to be quite reproducible regarding lipid monolayer 

deposition, packing and mobility. Thus, it is possible to proceed to further studies, namely 

protein binding assays.

2. STREPTAVIDIN BINDING TO LIPID MONOLAYER 

* 2.1. INFLUENCE OF LIPID PACKING IN HOMOGENEOUS MONOLAYERS 

In order to study protein-monolayer interaction, an APD system was used to measure 

streptavidin-Alexa488 fluorescence intensity at the SLB buffer subphase and at the interface 

(fig. 6). DMPC lipid monolayers were deposited at the buffer-air interface with different lipid 

densities. After confirming the integrity of the monolayer (as described in Results and 

discussion; 1.1. to 1.3.), 100 µL protein solution was added to the subphase in order to reach 

an initial concentration of 100 nM, as it is expected that streptavidin doesn’t bind strongly to 

the lipid interface. Each sample was measured after 1 min incubation and removal of excess 

volume. 

Fluorescence intensity of streptavidin is much higher at the monolayer interface than in the 

subphase, which is in accordance with the difference in count rate per molecule of Alexa 488 



 
 

 
31 

in presence and absence of lipids, as described in literature for a variety of fluorescent probes 

(reviewed in Valeur, 2002; Lakowicz, 2006). Due to the difference in polarity of surrounding 

medium, the non-radiative processes are increased in the buffer subphase which contributes 

to the reduction of the probe’s quantum yield. Moreover, at a constant protein concentration, 

the fluorescence intensity at the interface increases with increasing MMA, while it remains 

constant in the subphase (excluding 50 MMA) which points towards the dependence of 

protein binding on lipid packing. A quantification of the ratio between the interface and 

subphase fluorescence intensities indicates that streptavidin binding to DMPC monolayer 

might be dependent on lipid packing (fig. 7.A) and therefore also on the lipid diffusion (fig. 

7.B), being higher at a loose packing. Interestingly, this tendency had already been proposed 

four decades ago based on surface pressure variation studies induced by protein addition to 

PC monolayers at different physical states (Phillips et al, 1975) and glycosphingolipid

monolayers at different ? (Fidelio et al, 1981). However, at lower lipid density (100 MMA), 

where the lipids are loosely packed and formation of G phases is possible (fig. 2), streptavidin 

binding reduces again. Moreover, in a pure buffer-air interface streptavidin binding is relatively 

low (Ci/Cs = 14.0 ± 8.1), which suggests that the protein is not surface active and requires lipid 

for proper binding to the interface. Thus the data suggest that streptavidin establishes weak 

interactions with lipid molecules but further studies are needed to characterize the precise 

nature (hydrophobic or electrostatic) of the this interaction. This can be analyzed by varying 

the buffer conditions (pH, ion concentration and composition) as well as the chain length and 

saturation of monolayer phospholipids. 

* 2.2. INFLUENCE OF PHASE SEPARATION 

In order to illustrate the dependence of the protein-monolayer interaction on lipid packing, 

protein behavior in presence of different phase separated lipid monolayers was studied. The 

reason for this is that the liquid condensed (LC)/ S phase lipid molecules are more tightly 

packed then in the LE phase. After obtaining the ?-A isotherms of DMPC:DSPC 1:1, DPPC, 

DOPC:bSM:Chol 1:1:1 and DPPC:Chol 7:3 lipid mixtures (fig. 8), lipid monolayers were 

deposited at a similar surface pressure (7-12 mN/m) in order to obtain phase separation. This 

surface pressure is in the range of the isotherm plateau observed for pure DPPC – at this 

constant ?, phase coexistence is possible by gradual transition of lipid molecules from LE to LC 

solid-like phase, resulting in a decrease in MMA (Phillips &amp;amp; Chapman, 1968). In the other 

mixtures, no plateau is observed as the lipids organize spontaneously in two phases (LE and LC 

in case of DOPC:bSM:Chol 1:1:1 and DPPC:Chol 7:3; LE and S in case of DMPC:DSPC 1:1) due to 

their physico-chemical nature (Kim et al, 2001; Yun et al, 2003; Sabatini et al, 2008; Wilke et al, 

2010). All mixtures were labeled with 0.05 mol % Chol 542 – previous studies had shown that 

in monolayers, as in bilayers, the probe preferentially partitions into the LE phase in 

comparison to S or LC (corresponding to ld, gel and lo phases respectively in bilayers) 

(Chwastek &amp;amp; Schwille, 2013). An initial concentration of around 50-100 nM streptavidin was 

added and samples were imaged through confocal microscopy (fig. 9). 

 

Fig. 8: ?-A isotherm of DMPC:DSPC 1:1, DPPC, DOPC:bDM:Chol 1:1:1 and DPPC:Chol 7:3 lipid mixtures. 

All monolayers showed a phase separation, with dark S/LC domains in a bright homogeneous 

LE background (fig. 9). The poor contrast in case of DMPC:DSPC 1:1 is probably due to the high 

S phase content of the sample even though it was expected to occupy 25 % of the area (Wilke

phases are marked. 

et al, 2010). According to the observed dependence of protein binding on lipid packing (fig. 7), 

a higher protein fluorescence intensity was expected in LE phase in comparison to the LC/S 

phase in phase separated mixtures. In contrast, in DMPC:DSPC 1:1, DPPC and DOPC:bSM:Chol 

1:1:1 monolayers streptavidin tends to accumulate at domain boarders, the interface of the 

fluid and solid phases. Moreover, no significant difference in fluorescence intensity of protein 

was observed between the phases. Only DPPC:Chol 7:3 monolayer streptavidin shows a 

behavior coherent with the binding curves (fig. 7) – there is a preference in binding to the LE 

phase compared to LC phase. This results might be explained by the difference in lipid packing 

between LC/S and LE phase – in DMPC:DSPC 1:1 the phase separation is extreme, between a 

highly packed S phase and a fluid LE phase; pure DPPC phase separates in LE and LC gel-like 

phases; DOPC:bSM:Chol 1:1:1 and DPPC:Chol 1:1 are both raft-like phase separations. 

Nonetheless, DPPC:Chol 1:1 presents a lower difference in lipid packing between phases when 

compared to DOPC:bSM:Chol 1:1:1, according to previous studies in phase separated GUVs

labeled with Laurdan dyes (Bagatolli &amp;amp; Gratton, 2000; Sezgin unpublished results on giant 

plasma membrane vesicles). Moreover, other molecules – such as fatty acids and various 

peptides – tend to accumulate in the grain boundaries of domains with high lipid order (line 

defects with increased hydration) or are distributed in the interface of phases with high lipid 

packing difference (Nuscher et al, 2004; Franquelim et al, 2010; Yarrow &amp;amp; Kuipers, 2011; 

Khmelinskaia et al, 2013). Thus, it is not surprising to see a similar effect in streptavidin binding 

to phase separated monolayers. In summary, the results imply an important role of phase 

separation in controlling protein binding and its sorting at the membrane. 

* 2.3. INFLUENCE OF THE PRESENCE OF A BIOTINYLATED LIPID 

Proceeding further, the studies aimed at exploiting the strong binding of streptavidin to biotin 

by incorporating a biotinylated lipid – DOPE-Ncap-Biotin – into the monolayer. Thus, binding 

curve of streptavidin to DMPC:DOPE-Ncap-Biotin 95:5 monolayers were obtained (fig. 10). 

 

Fig. 10: Streptavidin-Alexa 488 (100 nM) binding (Ci/Cs) to DMPC, DMPC:DPPE-Ncap-Biotin 95:5, 

DMPC:DSPE-PEG2000-Biotin 99:1 monolayers as a function of MMA (A) and pressure (B). Pressure 

values are averaged from the respective ?-A isotherms (fig. 1 and 13). 

Interestingly, the presence of DPPE-Ncap-Biotin instead of increasing streptavidin 

concentration at the interface, reduced this interaction. Although this biotinylated lipid is 

widely used for specific binding assays, usually an altered form of streptavidin/avidin is used 

that abolishes unspecific binding (e.g. Sarmento et al, 2012; Vogel &amp;amp; Schwille, 2012; 

Heinemann et al, 2013). Additional evidences of strongly suppressed streptavidin binding to 

DPPE-Ncap-Biotin due to steric hindrance or inaccessibility of biotin for the binding spot from 

the actin-myosin minimal system (Vogel &amp;amp; Schwille, 2012), might partially explain the obtained 

result. Note that for biotin binding to neighboring subunits in streptavidin, a fixed distance of 

20 Å should be retained as otherwise the binding will be sterically hindered (Hendrickson et al, 

1989). It is also possible that the addition of DPPE-Ncap-biotin to the monolayer increases the 

surface pressure in a way that prevents streptavidin binding. Nevertheless, ?-A isotherm (fig. 

1) previously showed that the increase in surface pressure is not significant and thus this 

possibility is overruled (fig. 10.B). 



 
 

 
35 

In Vogel and Schwille 2012, this problem was overcome by using DSPE-PEG2000-Biotin. Thus 

this molecule appeared as a valid alternative for a specific membrane ligand for streptavidin. 

However, the protein binding curve obtained for DMPC:DSPE-PEG2000-Biotin 99:1 monolayer 

at different lipid densities showed the same trend observed with DPPE-Ncap-Biotin – 

streptavidin binds very poorly to the monolayer at all analyzed lipid densities and even lower 

than in absence of a biotinylated lipid (fig. 10). One possible reason could be the inaccessibility 

of biotin to streptavidin binding due to PEG2000 tail conformation in the monolayer. 

Moreover, in lipid monolayers long-chained PEG molecules present three conformations (fig. 

11) – at high MMA PEG molecules assume a pancake conformation in which the PEG tails are 

extended along the water-air interface; when the lipid density increases, PEG tails assume 

globular mushroom conformation; at high surface pressures, PEG chains extend towards the 

subphase in a brush conformation (Baekmark et al, 1995). 

 

Fig. 11: Schematic representation of the three possible conformations for long-chained PEG-ylated lipid 

– pancakes (A), mushroom (B) and brush (C) conformation. Adapted from (Baekmark et al, 1995). 

Moreover, in the mushroom conformation, DSPE-PEG2000 has a molecular area two orders of 

magnitude higher (3719 Å
2
 (Allen et al, 2002)) than that of regular phospholipids (40-70 Å

2
). 

Thus, surface coverage by PEG chains plays an important role in protein interactions with lipid 

layers (Kim et al, 2000; Auguste et al, 2008). 

Taking into account the head area of DSPE-PEG2000 and the number of molecules of 

PEGylated lipids present in the monolayer at different lipid densities, it was possible to 

calculate the surface coverage by PEG tails in mixtures containing different concentrations of 

DSPE-PEG2000-Biotin (fig. 12), as done for other systems (Allen et al, 2002). At low DSPE-

PEG2000 concentrations (0.1 mol %), the surface coverage is almost independent of the lipid 

density and it never excesses 10 %. When the concentration increases to 1 mol % the surface 

coverage increases strongly with MMA decrease from 40 to 80 %. At 5 mol %, PEG side chains 

completely cover the surface at all MMA. 

Furthermore, literature suggests that due to the high molecular area and the possibility of 

three chain conformations, the presence of long-chain PEGylated lipids will modify monolayer 

properties (Tanwir &amp;amp; Tsoukanova, 2008; Tsoukanova &amp;amp; Salesse, 2008). Thus, the obtained ?-A 

isotherm for DMPC:DSPE-PEG2000-Biotin (fig. 13) not only is strongly shifted towards higher 

MMA in comparison to pure DMPC but also presents two main discontinuities – a pseudo

plateau around 11 mN/m corresponding to the mushroom to pancake transition and a second 

one due to DMPC transition from LE to S and consequent monolayer collapse, as described for 

other lipid mixtures containing the DSPE-PEG2000 (Tanwir &amp;amp; Tsoukanova, 2008).

Fig. 13: ?-A isotherm of DMPC:DSPE-PEG2000-Biotin 99:1 lipid mixtures. Pure DMPC isotherm is also 

represented for a better comparison – dashed line. 

Moreover, monolayer imaging revealed the presence of undefined dark PEG-rich domains in 

the entire range of MMA studied, in accordance to previous studies (Tanwir &amp;amp; Tsoukanova, 

2008), even at concentrations as low as 0.2 mol % DSPE-PEG2000-Biotin and at low lipid 

densities (fig. 14). Additionally, lipid dye appears to cluster in presence of larger domains, 

contributing to a non-homogeneous signal. Thus, the conformational transitions of the long 

PEG chains might explain the shielding of streptavidin binding to DMPC monolayers containing 

DSPE-PEG2000-Biotin (fig. 10). 

Since in literature, the conformational transitions and domain formation and their effect on 

model membranes are mainly described for PEG molecules with long chains (Rex et al, 1998; 

Georgiev et al, 2007; Tsoukanova &amp;amp; Salesse, 2008; Stepniewski et al, 2011), DMPC mixture 

containing 0.1 mol % DOPE-PEG350 was morphologically characterized by confocal microscopy 

(fig. 15).

Despite the much shorter PEG chains and lower molecular area (468 Å
2
/molecule for DSPE-

PEG350 (Allen et al, 2002)) of the functionalized lipids and thus a lower surface coverage, the 

DMPC monolayers didn’t present a homogeneous morphology – several irregular domains 

were observed, which point towards a similar behavior to that observed with DSPE-PEG2000-

Biotin. 

A further possibility to obtain the specific streptavidin – biotin binding would be substituting 

native streptavidin for ExtrAvidin or NeutrAvidin – mutant (strept)avidin forms which retain 

the high protein stability and binding avidity but reduces the unspecific binding. Both protein 

forms were successfully used in assays involving correspondingly DPPE-Ncap-Biotin and DSPE-

PEG2000-Biotin incorporation in lipid bilayers (Sarmento et al, 2012; Vogel &amp;amp; Schwille, 2012; 

Heinemann et al, 2013). 

3. CHOLERA TOXIN ? BINDING TO LIPID MONOLAYER 

* 3.1. INFLUENCE OF LIPID PACKING ON CTXB5 BINDING TO MONOLAYERS WITH 

DIFFERENT GM1 CONTENT 

Besides streptavidin, Ctx binding to lipid monolayers was studied as this protein has a natural 

ligand – the ganglioside GM1 – that incorporates in lipid layers. Due to its lack of toxicity and 

retained GM1 binding activity, the pentameric CtxB5 ring was used. Fluorescence intensity 

measurements of CtxB5-Alexa 488 in the subphase and at interface was used to assess the 

influence of not only lipid packing, but also GM1 and protein concentrations on CtxB5 binding to 

the monolayer. The MMA was varied under three conditions (fig. 16): pure DMPC monolayer

incubated with 100 nM and also 5 nM protein and DMPC monolayer containing 0.1 mol % GM1 

incubated with 5 nM protein. The GM1 content was reduced from 1 mol % (fig.1) to 0.1 mol % 

in order to avoid any possible influence on the monolayer morphology, taking into account the 

experience previously had with lipid mixtures containing a biotinylated lipid. Control ?-A 

isotherm (not shown) didn’t show any major alterations in comparison to pure DMPC, as 

previously shown for the mixture containing higher GM1 concentration (fig. 1). 

 

Fig. 16: Fluorescence intensity of Cholera toxin ?-Alexa 488 in the subphase (A) and interface (B) of 

DMPC monolayer system with different GM1 content deposited at the SLB buffer-air interface – pure 

DMPC incubated with 5 nM and 100 nM CtxB5; DMPC containing 0.1 mol % GM1 incubated with 5nM 

CtxB5. 

As previously observed for streptavidin (fig. 6), CtxB5 fluorescence intensity at the monolayer 

interface is dependent on the lipid packing, especially at the high protein concentration (100 

nM), while in the subphase it remains mainly constant, pointing towards a plausible 

dependence of protein binding on monolayer MMA. Also, the intensity of the protein at the 

monolayer level is generally higher than in the subphase, as expected from the change in Alexa 

488 quantum yield according to polarity of surrounding medium. However, the difference in 

CtxB5 intensities between subphase and interface appears to be much lower than the one 

observed for streptavidin at the same concentration (note the higher fluorescence intensity in 

the subphase of CtxB5 (? 10 a.u.) compared to that of streptavidin (? 1 a.u.) – fig. 16.A and 6.A 

respectively). This implies a lower membrane binding of Ctx compared to streptavidin. As 

fluorescence intensity is proportional to fluorophore concentration (eq. 14), an increase of 

fluorescence intensity in both subphase and monolayer interface at higher protein 

concentrations is observed. For further analysis, protein binding was quantified through ratio 

of interface and subphase intensities (see Materials and Methods; 7) (fig. 17). 

The previously observed streptavidin binding dependence on monolayer lipid packing (fig. 7.A) 

is manifested only at high protein concentrations in case of CtxB5. At a starting protein 

concentration of 100 nM, CtxB5 binding increases with lipid MMA in pure DMPC monolayers, 

suggesting that protein binding is dependent on surface pressure which is in accordance with 

previous studies (Fidelio et al, 1981). On the other hand, at a concentration as low as 5 nM, 

protein concentration appears to be rather independent of lipid packing. Thus, the 



 
 

 
39 

concentration of protein reservoir influences CtxB5 binding to lipid monolayer, as had been 

proposed four decades ago in Ctx, melittin and myelin penetration in ganglioside monolayers 

(Fidelio et al, 1981; Cumar et al, 1982). Further, when comparing streptavidin binding to pure 

buffer-air interface (Ci/Cs = 14.0 ± 8.1) to that of CtxB5 (Ci/Cs = 150.8 ± 32.8) at the same initial 

protein concentration (100 nM), the latter protein reveals rather higher surface activity. 

Nevertheless, the overall binding of streptavidin to the monolayer (Ci/Cs &gt; 10 – fig. 7) is higher 

than that one of CtxB5 (Ci/Cs &amp;lt;= 10 – fig. 17). This distinct protein behavior must be related to 

protein structure as the interaction with the interface emerges from the establishment of 

several weak interactions of its components with protein amino-acid residues. So, additional 

binding assays in different buffer conditions are needed in order to understand the nature of 

the protein-monolayer interaction. 

 

Fig. 17: CtxB5-Alexa 488 binding (Ci/Cs) to DMPC monolayers with different GM1 content as a function of 

MMA – pure DMPC incubated with 5 nM and 100 nM CtxB5; DMPC containing 0.1 mol % GM1 incubated 

with 5nM CtxB5. 

When analyzing the influence of GM1 presence in the monolayer, an increase of CtxB5 binding 

to the monolayer is expected due to the specificity of the ligand-protein binding. Accordingly, a 

slight increase of CtxB5 binding is observed when a small concentration (0.1 mol %) of 

ganglioside is incorporated. Interestingly, the observed trend relative to lipid density at low 

protein concentration is the same in absence or presence of GM1 – the protein binding is 

mainly constant through the studied lipid densities. This suggests that even at high pressures 

GM1 is homogeneously distributed in the monolayer in a way which allows CtxB5 binding. 

Nevertheless, at 50 MMA CtxB5 binding to monolayer is not influenced by GM1 presence, 

probably due to increased ganglioside density that hinders protein-ligand interaction (Shi et al, 

2007). 

At 100 MMA, both protein and GM1 concentration effects are canceled – note the big error 

bars associated with the measurements. This might be explained by the possible formation of 

gas phases and variation of protein binding to zones of different lipid packing due to meniscus 

formed by subphase deposition or sample tilting. The increase in surface pressure associated 

with lipid deposition at the interface reduces the meniscus angle, thus reducing the variation 

in lipid density.

* 3.2. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF PROTEIN BINDING 

For a better comparison of the influences of lipid packing and GM1 content on CtxB5 binding to 

DMPC monolayers, lipid monolayer was titrated with increasing CtxB5 concentration in order 

to obtain KD values by fitting the Hill equation to the titration curve (eq. 16). At each 

concentration, protein fluorescence intensity was measured through APD system in the 

subphase and at the monolayer level. Four different conditions were studied: pure DMPC and 

0.1 mol % GM1 containing DMPC monolayers, both at 50 and 90 MMA. Since the Alexa 488 

signal was observed to have a high reflection component, due to the imperfect cut-off of the 

excitation wavelength by the available filter system, CtxB5-Alexa 647 was used as the 

wavelength cut-off is much better aligned allowing a more accurate data acquisition. 

The subphase CtxB5 concentrations shows mostly linear dependency with increasing initial 

concentration at all conditions, not presenting major dependence either on GM1 content or 

lipid density (fig. 18.A). On the other hand, at the interface CtxB5 appears to have a tendency 

to saturate the monolayer as at high protein concentration (above 70 nM) it becomes difficult 

to increase the membrane binding (fig. 18.B). A similar saturation was described on ganglioside 

monolayers and GM1 containing POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) SLBs 

(Cumar et al, 1982; Shi et al, 2007). Nonetheless, the values at which the protein saturates the 

surface are widely spread, not only due to difference in method accuracy but also in the 

protein pool available to bind the surface – note that the ratio of surface area and reservoir 

volume does influence the protein binding, as the same total amount of protein when 

available for a bigger area will appear as lower concentration of the protein on the membrane. 

At low protein concentrations, no difference between conditions is observed, as it is predicted 

from the CtxB5 binding curve (fig. 17). However, with increasing protein concentration the 

fluorescence intensity at 90 MMA reaches higher values than at 50 MMA, suggesting a 

preferential CtxB5 binding to less packed monolayers. Additionally, these results uncover the 

influence of GM1 on CtxB5 binding to lipid monolayers that were not clear in the previous 

binding curve (fig. 17) – in presence of 0.1 mol % of ganglioside, the fluorescence intensity 

increases globally as the amount of protein binding to the monolayer increases. Also, subphase 

concentration is in general never higher than that of the interface, in accordance with the 

higher fluorophore quantum yield when inserted in a non-polar environment. It’s predicted 

that this behavior is overcome once the saturation plateau is established and the protein 

accumulates in the subphase reaching much higher concentrations – note that at high protein 

concentration (90-130 MMA) in absence of GM1, the protein fluorescence intensity in subphase 

and at interface is comparable. 

The predicted sigmoidal behavior of CtxB5 binding to the lipid monolayer by Hill equation (Shi 

et al, 2007) it’s not easily observed in the case of this study. This might be caused by high 

standard deviation associated with measurements (fig. 19) – not only is the protein 

distribution in the monolayer during a single titration not homogeneous, but also there is a 

high degree of variability associated with independent samples. Various factors could 

contribute in the inhomogeneity of APD signal within a sample – firstly, protein clusters may 

form when it interacts with the lipid interface; secondly, the presence of meniscus in the lipid 

monolayer or other variations in the lipid packing which appear during lipid solution deposition

at the interface could also alter protein binding to the monolayer. Furthermore, there are 

several factors that are still not fully controlled and thus vary between independent samples 

such as subphase evaporation, lipid oxidation or protein deposition at the glass cover slip. 

Thus, the data do not allow relevant fit and no reproducible trends or quantitative conclusions 

about protein binding can be obtained (fig. 19). Some of these concerned could be addressed 

by using a ROS (reactive oxygen species) scavenger in order to reduce lipid oxidation or by 

modifying chamber structure and treatment for a better control of subphase evaporation and 

protein deposition.

* 3.3. PROTEIN BINDING TO PHASE SEPARATED MONOLAYERS WITH DIFFERENT GM1 

CONTENT 

Based on CtxB5 binding trend with lipid packing on homogeneous DMPC monolayers and 

differential GM1 partitioning suggested by literature (see below), a comparative study of its 

behavior in phase separated DOPC:bSM:Chol 1:1:1 monolayers with different GM1 content –0, 

0.1 and 1 mol % was conducted (fig. 20). Lipid monolayers were imaged through confocal 

microscopy at each step of protein titration (till a maximum concentration of 130 nM) and, in 

order to proceed to a semi-quantitative analysis, fluorescence intensity profiles of 

representative cross-sections were taken (fig. 20). 

Further image analysis allowed to assess mean CtxB5 fluorescence intensity separately in LE 

and LC phase and to quantify the relative binding of the protein in these phases (fig. 21). 

In absence of GM1, CtxB5 binds preferentially to the LE phase (fig. 21.A) as expected from earlier 

studies (Chwastek &amp;amp; Schwille, 2013) and previously presented results (fig. 17). Moreover, 

protein partitioning is dependent on the initial protein concentration – the ratio of 

fluorescence intensities between LE and LC phase increases with the concentration (fig. 21.C) 

as lipid binding curves suggest (fig. 17). Note that this behavior is apparently not reverted even 

at high protein concentration. When a small concentration of GM1 (0.1 mol %) is incorporated 

in the monolayer, there is no significant difference between CtxB5 binding to LE or LC phase. 

Nonetheless, at low protein concentration (bellow 30 nM), CtxB5 is enriched in LC phase as 

compared to LE phase (fig. 21.B and C) as expected from closely related work (Chwastek &amp;amp; 

Schwille, 2013), due to preferential incorporation of GM1 in ordered domains (Rock et al, 1991; 

Vié et al, 1998; Yuan &amp;amp; Johnston, 2000; Menke et al, 2002). As the available GM1 for binding is 

easily saturated, this tendency is reversed and LE phase show an increased CtxB5 binding when 

compared to LC phase at total protein concentrations higher than 30 nM. On the other hand, 

when GM1 concentration in the monolayer is increased to 1 mol % the CtxB5 enrichment in LC 

phase as compared to LE phase is stabilized (fig.20) as GM1 saturation is not reached in the 

range of analyzed protein concentrations (1 – 130 nM). Moreover, this trend is even more 

obvious as the initial protein concentration increases –at higher protein concentrations the 

laser power used during the imaging (generally kept at 5 %) was reduced to avoid channel 

saturation (0.2 %). 

Thus, these results suggest that phase separation might be a mechanism of controlling protein-

membrane interactions through differences in protein packing, as had already been shown in 

streptavidin experiments (fig. 9). Additionally, the roles of protein concentration (Phillips et al, 

1975; Fidelio et al, 1981; Cumar et al, 1982) and membrane GM1 content (Shi et al, 2007) in 

CtxB binding are also confirmed.

4. CONCLUSIONS 

* 4.1. LIPID MONOLAYER CHARACTERIZATION 

The developed miniaturized trough is shown to allow for robust characterization of 

morphology and mobility of monolayers. More specifically, monolayer homogeneity 

measurements at the studied MMA were accompanied by FCS assay which revealed a linear 

tendency of diffusion coefficients as a function of lipid density, as expected from the free area 

model proposed by Galla et al. in 1979. Moreover, the obtained ac values for DMPC (36.2 ± 

4.72 / 37.2 ± 13.75 Å
2
 in samples with different labels) are in good agreement with the 

literature. Nevertheless some deviations are expected at extreme lipid densities (50 and 100 

MMA) as small variations in lipid deposition result in great lipid packing differences – 

formation of S and G phases respectively, which will influence the monolayer mobility. 

* 4.2. PROTEIN-MONOLAYER BINDING 

For both proteins, the results uncover the influence of lipid packing, and thus of lipid mobility 

and ?, on protein binding – streptavidin and CtxB5 bind stronger to the membrane at low lipid 

densities and, accordingly, low ? and high lipid mobility. Although streptavidin appears to bind 



 
 

 
45 

stronger to lipid monolayers, CtxB5 present a stronger surface activity as its binding to clean 

buffer-air interface is higher. Moreover, phase separated mixtures illustrate this behavior – 

proteins show higher affinity for loose LE phase then for tightly packed LC domains. 

Nonetheless, the surface non-active protein streptavidin tends to accumulate in the domain 

boundaries when the difference in lipid organization between domains is very high– for 

example in LE/S phase separations. Furthermore, titration experiments with CtxB5 support this 

result as at 90 MMA the interface protein intensity is higher than at 50 MMA. Interestingly, 

these results confirm predictions made four decades ago through surface pressure variation 

study of different lipid monolayers on protein addition (Phillips et al, 1975; Fidelio et al, 1981; 

Cumar et al, 1982). 

A specific binding could be obtained for CtxB5 only by incorporation of GM1 in the monolayer. 

Although binding curves do not show it clearly, titration experiments reveal that the presence 

of 0.1 mol % GM1 is enough to highly increase protein binding to the monolayer. Also, the 

previously observed influence of lipid density is retained in presence of a specific ligand. 

However, in phase separated mixtures containing GM1, protein binds preferentially to LC 

domains, as the ganglioside is preferentially distributed in these rigid domains (Rock et al, 

1991; Vié et al, 1998; Yuan &amp;amp; Johnston, 2000; Menke et al, 2002). 

Besides the influences of lipid packing and presence of ligand, it was also shown that the pool 

of available protein have an impact on the obtained results, in accordance with previous 

studies (Phillips et al, 1975; Fidelio et al, 1981; Cumar et al, 1982). This could be mediated by 

both the protein concentration and the ratio between available surface area and protein 

volume.

FINAL REMARKS 

Protein-lipid interactions are one of the major focuses of membrane research as they play a 

central role in membrane organization, metabolism and signaling processes. Although a 

possible influence of lipid packing on protein binding to lipid layers had been proposed four 

decades ago (Phillips et al, 1975; Fidelio et al, 1981; Cumar et al, 1982), the methods available 

at the time were not enough to prove it. 

Lipid monolayer is a classical model system which has been rather neglected in recent 

membrane research, even though it allows easy manipulation oflipid packing. Here, it is shown 

that despite its simplicity, the assay can be used to address current challenging biological 

problems, by convenient coupling with high resolution and high sensitivity techniques, such as 

confocal microscopy and FCS. 

The miniaturized trough recently developed by Chwastek and Schwille is shown here to allow 

the deposition of monolayers with highly robust morphological and lipid mobility 

characteristics. Due to its reproducibility, low volume and technical versatility, the applied 

system can be easily used in protein binding assays. Two well-characterized proteins – 

streptavidin and CtxB5 – were chosen for the validation of the proposed method, based on 

protein fluorescence measurement at both monolayer interface and subphase. 

Here, by using this system in a semi-quantitative way, new evidence of the importance of lipid 

packing in protein-membrane interaction is achieved. It is shown that proteins easily penetrate 

the monolayer at low lipid densities, while at high ?, the interaction is reduced. Phase 

separation serves as a mechanism of regulation of protein binding regulation not only through 

differential lipid packing but also ligand segregation. In addition, protein pool and available 

surface affect the binding as a function of protein concentration. 

The presented system provides a powerful alternative approach to study protein-membrane 

interactions, allowing tuning of membrane parameters as lipid packing, which cannot be easily 

regulated in bilayers. The robust combination with confocal microscopy and spectroscopy, not 

only results in a high temporal resolution of particle mobility, but also achieves high spatial 

resolution in an assay. Altogether, the presented work was the first attempt to develop 

fluorescence-based quantitative assay which could be used to monitor binding of the protein 

to lipid monolayers.

FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 

Despite the robustness of the method when applied to lipid analyses, some problems remain 

to be solved – the lipid probes do not distribute homogeneously in the monolayer. Thus, at 

increasing ? one does not observe a consistent increase in the number of molecules in the Veff. 

It is possible that at high surface pressures probe Kp between the water subphase and the 

monolayer is decreased, resulting in its partial exclusion from the monolayer. On the other 

hand, the increase in lipid density can increase weak interactions between different particles, 

resulting in dye clustering. Thus, further studies are needed to understand fluorophore 

behavior in lipid monolayers. 

A better characterization of CtxB5 and streptavidin unspecific binding to monolayers remain to 

be done. The nature of protein interaction with lipids can be further studied by manipulation 

of buffer conditions (e.g. salt content and concentration, pH). Also, variation of the amount of 

the ligand in the monolayer can give new insight into ligand-protein interactions. For 

streptavidin, in order to study its specific binding to monolayer surface, one could substitute 

streptavidin for the mutant form ExtrAvidin or Neutravidin which have shown better results in 

lipid bilayers. 

Additionally, accurate protein binding quantification and KD determination was not yet 

achieved. The high standard deviations associated to the binding assays seem to be related to 

a non-homogeneous incorporation of the protein in the lipid monolayer. Some of the error 

might originate from meniscus formation and discrepancies introduced during monolayer 

deposition and protein addition. Thus further standardization of applied lipid and protein 

solution volume, concentration and condition should be done. 

Further, additional factors such as lipid oxidation, subphase evaporation and ? difference are 

neither monitored nor controlled here. The use of a ROS scavenger system added to the 

subphase could help to reduce lipid oxidation, even though the hydrophobic carbon tails are 

pointed towards the air. Also, the creations of a tiny well around the chamber would allow for 

a better sample sealing when filled with water, helping to control evaporation. Due to the 

small chamber size the use of a Wilhelmy plate for ? monitoring is hindered. Nonetheless, it is 

possible to calculate ? through physical wave formation and its decay analysis. 

In future, it is expected to get a more complete and quantified characterization of streptavidin 

and Ctx binding to lipid monolayers; particularly, the influences of lipid packing and ligand 

content. For example, the application of fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) 

technique could provide a more concrete analysis of specific interaction between the protein 

and its ligand. Ultimately, monolayers have the potential to provide a quantitative protein 

binding assay, which would be easily applied for other biologically relevant proteins – such as 

FCHo2, an F-BAR protein responsible for sensing and inducing membrane curvature.
