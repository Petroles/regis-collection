Resumo 
 

A presente tese de doutoramento tem por objectivo contribuir para o conhecimento geral 

dos cocolitóforos na transição costeiro-neritico-oceânica, a sua distribuição ao largo de 

Portugal, e o seu potencial enquanto traçador (paleo)ecológico e (paleo)ceanográfico no 

contexto de canhões submarinos. Para compreender a relação entre os coccolitóforos e as 

condições ambientais, os resultados foram interpretados numa perspectiva multidisciplinar, 

integrados num conjunto significativo de dados relativos às características ecológicas e 

hidrológicas das massas de água superficiais da margem Portuguesa central (i.e. nutrientes, 

clorofila, temperatura, salinidade, turbidez, dados de vento e de satélite), e às caracteristicas 

sedimentológicas dos fundos marinhos (i.e. composição, textura e acumulação sedimentar). 

As variações ecológicas mais significativas observadas nas comunidades de cocólitoforos 

ao largo de Portugal ocorreram ao longo do gradiente costa-oceano. Dois grupos taxonómicos 

principais de comportamento ecológico oposto foram observados na zona fótica, marcando a 

transição de espécies adaptadas a regimes mais estáveis (K-selected) preferencialmente 

distribuídas no domínio oceânico, para espécies oportunistas (r-selected) mais frequentes nas 

regiões neritico-costeiras. Este gradiente também foi observado nas associações de cocólitos 

preservadas nos sedimentos superficiais do fundo marinho, tanto ao longo dos canhões 

submarinos como nas suas áreas adjacentes, embora várias diferenças tenham sido reconhecidas 

entre os dois tipos de ambientes. 

Na zona fótica, as espécies Emiliania huxleyi e Gephyrocapsa oceanica revelaram um 

comportamento claramente r-selected, tendo sido as principais responsáveis pelo bloom de 

cocolitóforos observado ao largo do Cabo Carvoeiro. Este bloom ocorreu em resposta à 

combinação favorável de descarga fluvial de final de inverno com ventos predominantes de 

norte sobre a plataforma, e condições de céu limpo. Em apenas alguns dias, as concentrações de 

cocolitóforos e biomassa de fitoplâncton (Chl-a) mais do que triplicaram, indicando claramente 

a capacidade destes organismos em tirar partido das condições favoráveis em luz e nutrientes 

providenciadas pela pluma fluvial superficial. As duas espécies desenvolveram-se em conjunto 

com outros fitoplânctónicos oportunistas (Chaetoceros s.l., Thalassiosira s.l, Skeletonema s.l.), 

confirmando o seu papel enquanto espécies r-selected de primeiro estádio da sucessão 

fitoplanctónica, caracterizadas por terem um potencial de desenvolvimento rápido em ambientes 

ricos em nutrientes. Coronosphaera mediterranea e Syracolithus dalmaticus também 

responderam positivamente às condições favoráveis no decorrer do cruzeiro, embora menos 

notavelmente do que as espécies anteriores. Pelo contrário, os grupos Syracosphaera spp. e 

Ophiaster spp. revelaram características típicas de espécies K-selected, consistentemente mais 

abundantes em águas mais oceânicas e menos eutróficas, afastadas da influência da pluma 

fluvial, ou distribuídas em níveis abaixo da pluma nas regiões mais neritico-costeiras. 

Gephyrocapsa ericsonii e Gephyrocapsa muellerae dominaram a comunidade de cocolitóforos 

sob condições de baixa produtividade na plataforma, mas não quando as águas de regiões 

nerítico-costeiras se tornaram favoráveis ao bloom de espécies oportunistas. 



Resumo

No sedimento superficial de fundo, enquanto as espécies C. mediterranea, Helicosphaera 

carteri e a G. oceanica (e, em menor grau, Coccolithus pelagicus) registaram uma distribuição 

marcadamente costeira, os cocólitos produzidos pelas espécies Calcidiscus leptoporus, 

Umbilicosphaera sibogae, Umbellosphaera irregularis e Rhabdosphaera spp. foram observados 

preferencialmente distribuidos para offshore e para sul, possivelmente indicadoras de uma maior 

influência da ENACWst na zona mais meridional da area de estudo (i.e. a sul do Esporão da 

Estremadura). G. muellerae revelou ser, de longe, a espécie mais abundante e amplamente 

distribuída, embora geralmente mais oceânica, particularmente nas regiões adjacentes aos 

canhões submarinos. Enquanto certas especies mais robustas (i.e. C. leptoporus, C. pelagicus, 

H. carteri) tiveram um registo mais relevante no sedimento em comparação com a coluna de 

água, géneros de morfologia mais frágil e de menores dimensões (i.e. Syracosphaera spp., 

Ophiaster spp., S. dalmaticus) não foram observadas no sedimento, provavelmente traduzindo 

os efeitos da dissolução e fragmentação selectiva. No entanto, quando considerando 

percentagens de espécies de cocólitos de dimensão semelhante (?3 µm), não foi observada 

qualquer evidência mais consistente de que tenha havido transporte ou preservação preferencial 

de especies individuais, confirmando que o signal preservado no sedimento apresenta uma forte 

componente (paleo)ecológica, e não meramente tafonómica. 

Em termos de dinâmica de canhão submarino, o Canhão da Nazaré foi observado a ter o 

efeito de conduta preferencial de águas oceânicas para regiões bastante proximais da plataforma 

continental Portuguesa, as quais se encontravam empobrecidas em nutrientes em comparação 

com as massas de água neríticas e costeiras durante o período de final de inverno monitorizado 

durante o cruzeiro. A ocorrência singular de Discosphaera tubifera e Palusphaera vandelii na 

cabeceira do canhão, juntamente com C. leptoporus é interpretada enquanto traçadora do 

deslocamento preferencial de ENACWst intensificado ao longo do troço superior do canhão, 

durante o inverno. Um “hotspot” de diversidade de cocolitóforos foi observado na coluna de 

água desta área, incluindo tanto espécies oceânicas-oligotróficas como espécies costeiras 

oportunistas, tendo sido interpretado enquanto reflexo da capacidade do canhão em promover 

trocas de massas de água entre regiões neritico-costeiras e regiões mais oceânicas, 

particularmente durante o inverno. Adicionalmente, a persistente ocorrência de elevadas 

concentrações de Chl-a à superfície obtidas por imagens de satélite, particularmente entre 

Março e Outubro (2006-2011), sugerem a cabeceira do Canhão da Nazaré como sendo o sector 

mais persistentemente produtivo do troço superior-médio do canhão. Percentagens mais 

elevadas de cocólitos de espécies costeiro-neriticas em sedimentos da parte superior do Canhão 

da Nazaré corroboram esta hipótese, possivelmente traduzindo a forte proximidade da sua 

cabeceira à linha de costa, resultando numa maior influência da dinâmica costeira e na sua 

intensificação na cabeceira e área adjacente (i.e. upwelling, ondas internas), e em condições 

mais dinâmicas e ricas em nutrientes para as quais as espécies r-selected estão melhor 

adaptadas.  

Pelo contrário, percentagens mais elevadas de cocólitos de espécies oceânicas no Canhão 

de Lisboa-Setúbal parecem traduzir um ambiente em geral mais oceânico-pelágico neste

canhão, resultante da sua maior distância aos efeitos da dinâmica costeira e ausência de 

transporte sedimentar significativo ao longo do seu talvegue, na actualidade. 

Uma mistura mais acentuada de cocólitos produzidos pelas duas associações 

(paleo)ecológicas, i.e. a costeiro-neritica e a oceânica, foi observada nos sedimentos dos 

canhões, em comparação com as regiões da plataforma e vertente regiões adjacentes aos 

canhões onde o gradiente (paleo)ecológico costa-oceano é mais distintivo. Esta assinatura nos 

canhões confirma a capacidade destas estrutura em promover trocas de massas de água costeiras 

e oceânicas (sinal ecológico), embora o importante papel das ondas internas e dos ocasionais 

fluxos gravíticos de sedimentos em perturbar e homogeneizar o registo sedimentar (sinal 

tafonómico) nos canhões deva ser sempre considerado. 

Ao evitar os problemas estatísticos tipicamente associados às determinações percentuais, 

a Análise de Dados Composicionais (i.e. a abordagem isometric log-ratio) permitiu validar e 

confirmar o gradiente ecológico costa-oceano observado nas associações de cocólitos no 

sedimento. A boa concordância entre os dois métodos sugere que o sinal (paleo)ecológico 

preservado na cobertura sedimentar da margem Portuguesa central é robusto, mesmo junto à 

costa e no contexto das condições dinâmicas vigentes nos canhões submarinos. 

Pelo contrário, tanto as concentrações de cocólitos (nanno/g) como os fluxos 

(nanno/cm
2
/yr) revelaram padrões de distribuição espacial onde as relações ecológicas inter-

espécies parecem estar “mascaradas” por factores sedimentares/tafonómicos, particularmente 

nas zonas costeiras e nos canhões. O aumento de cocólitos para offshore reflecte não só a 

natureza primordialmente oceânica dos cocolitóforos, mas também a ocorrência de selecção 

textural, resultando na acumulação preferencial de cocólitos em regiões menos energéticas da 

vertente continental média e inferior, e em certas zonas dos canhões as quais funcionam como 

armadilhas morfológicas temporárias de sedimentos. Fluxos mais elevados nos troços superiores 

dos canhões reflectem o seu papel enquanto depocentros preferenciais de sedimentos finos na 

plataforma continental, tanto de origem litogénica como biogénica, incluindo cocólitos 

provenientes de fluxos verticais (produtividade – sinal ecológico) e laterais (resuspensão e 

advecção – sinal tafonómico). 

Este estudo ilustra cabalmente a rapidez de resposta dos cocolitóforos a variações 

meteorológicas e hidrográficas de curto-prazo e ao surgimento de condições ambientais 

favoráveis na costa Portuguesa, contrariando a noção amplamente aceite de que estes 

organismos representam um grupo fitoplanctónico calcário uniforme típico de ambientes de 

baixa turbulência, baixo conteúdo nutritivo e intensa luminosidade. Embora haja ainda muito 

trabalho a fazer no que respeita ao impacto dos canhões submarinos sobre a dinâmica 

oceanográfica e fitoplanctónica ao largo de Portugal, as associações de cocólitos preservados no 

sedimento revelaram-se úteis enquanto traçadores de gradientes (paleo)ecológicos e 

(paleo)oceanográficos vigentes na margem Portuguesa central. Os resultados confirmam estudos 

anteriores focados na complexa dinâmica hidro-sedimentar vigente nos canhões submarinos da 

Nazaré e de Lisboa-Setúbal.

Abstract 
 

This thesis aims to contribute to the knowledge of coccolithophores from coastal-neritic-

oceanic transitional settings, their distribution offshore central Portugal, and their potential as 

(paleo)ecological and (paleo)ceanographic proxy in the context of submarine canyons. In order 

to achieve a good understanding of the relationship of coccolithophores with the environmental 

setting, results were interpreted on a multidisciplinary basis, integrating a significant data set 

concerning the hydrological characteristics of surface waters of the central Portuguese margin 

(i.e. nutrients, chlorophyll, temperature, salinity, turbidity, wind data) and seabed 

sedimentological characteristics (i.e. sediment bulk composition, particle size and sediment 

accumulation).  

The most striking variations in phytoplankton communities off central Portugal occurred 

along the coastal-oceanic lateral gradient. Two principal groups of taxa of opposite ecological 

behaviour were observed in the photic layer, with K-selected taxa preferentially distributed in 

the open ocean, and r-selected taxa preferentially occurring in more coastal-neritic regions. Such 

gradient was also reflected in coccolith assemblages preserved in surface sediments on the 

seabed, both along the submarine canyons and on the adjacent shelf and slope areas, although 

several differences were noticed between the two environments. 

In the photic layer, Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica exhibited the typical 

behaviour of r-selected species, being the main responsible for a coccolithophore bloom 

occurring in the Nazaré Canyon region (off Cape Carvoeiro). This bloom occurred in response 

to late winter continental runoff combined with northerly winds prevailing over the shelf, under 

clear sky conditions. Within a few days, coccolithophore cell densities and associated 

phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) more than tripled, indicating that phytoplankton was taking 

profit from favourable nutrient and light conditions provided by the superficial buoyant plume. 

The two species were developing together with other opportunistic phytoplankton genera 

(Chaetoceros s.l., Thalassiosira s.l, Skeletonema s.l.), confirming their role as early succession 

r-selected taxa, capable of rapid growth within nutrient-rich environments. Coronosphaera 

mediterranea and Syracolithus dalmaticus also responded to the favourable conditions, but less 

so than E. huxleyi and G. oceanica. On the contrary, Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. 

revealed typical characteristics of K-selected species, being consistently more abundant in more 

oceanic and less eutrophic waters, away from the influence of river runoff, and extending well 

below the nutrient-rich surface layer in the more coastal-neritic regions. Gephyrocapsa ericsonii 

and Gephyrocapsa muellerae dominated the coccolithophore community under steady-state 

low-productive conditions over the shelf, until shelf and coastal waters became favourable for r-

selected species to bloom. 

In the seafloor sediment, coccoliths from C. mediterranea, Helicosphaera carteri and G. 

oceanica (and to a lesser extent, Coccolithus pelagicus) exhibited a markedly coastal 

distribution, whereas coccoliths from Calcidiscus leptoporus, Umbilicosphaera sibogae, 

Umbellosphaera irregularis and Rhabdosphaera spp. were preferentially distributed further

offshore and southwards, possibly tracing the preferential onflow of ENACWst into the 

southern part of the central Portuguese shelf (i.e. south of Estremadura spur). G. muellerae was 

by far the most abundant and broadly distributed species in the sediment, with highest 

abundances in the more oceanic areas, particularly outside the canyons. Whereas larger and 

more robust coccolith species (i.e. C. leptoporus, C. pelagicus, H. carteri) were better 

represented in the sediment in comparison to the overlying water column, smaller and more 

delicate species from the genera Syracosphaera spp., Ophiaster spp. and S. dalmaticus were not 

found in the sediments, most likely due to selective dissolution and breaking. Yet, considering 

the coccolith species assemblage preserved in the sediment, no consistent evidence for selective 

transport or preservation of individual taxa in relation to coccolith size was found, strongly 

suggesting the signal within the sediment is mostly (paleo)ecological rather than merely 

taphonomical.  

In terms of canyon dynamics, the Nazaré Canyon was observed to act as a preferential 

conduit for oceanic waters into very proximal regions of the Portuguese shelf, which were 

nutrient-depleted in comparison to neritic and coastal water masses during the monitored late 

winter period. The single occurrence of Discosphaera tubifera and Palusphaera vandelii in this 

proximal area, together with C. leptoporus, is interpreted as tracing the onflow of ENACWst 

intensified along the upper canyon during winter. A coccolithophore diversity “hotspot” was 

noticed in the canyon head, including both oligotrophic-oceanic and opportunistic-coastal taxa, 

interpreted as reflecting the canyon’s capacity to promote exchange of water masses between 

neritic-coastal and oceanic regions during winter. In addition, Chl-a time series obtained from 

satellite data (2006-2011) revealed that the canyon head is often the stage of high productivity 

between March and October, which makes this region the most persistently productive part of 

the upper-middle canyon and nearby shelf. Highest percentages of coastal-neritic coccoliths in 

sediments from the upper Nazaré Canyon support this hypothesis, possibly reflecting the greater 

proximity of the head of this canyon to the coastline. The stronger influence of coastal dynamics 

and their intensification in this area (i.e. upwelling, internal waves), gives rise to more dynamic 

and nutrient-rich conditions to which r-selected coccolithophore species are better adapted.  

On the contrary, higher percentages of coccoliths from oceanic taxa in the Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon suggest that a generally more oceanic-pelagic environment prevails in this canyon, 

explained by its greater distance from coastal dynamics and present-day lack of down-canyon 

sediment transport. Enhanced percentages of G. muellerae in the upper Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon 

may be indicating preferential onflow of oceanic water masses through the canyon and/or up-

canyon transport of resuspended coccoliths in the bottom boundary layer. 

More pronounced mixing of coccoliths from both coastal-neritic and oceanic coccolith 

assemblages was observed in sediments from the canyons, in comparison to the canyons 

adjacent shelf-slope regions where the coast-ocean (paleo)ecological gradient is more 

distinctive, confirming the capacity of these structures in promoting the exchange between 

coastal and oceanic water masses (ecological signal). Nevertheless, the role of internal tides and 

occasional sediment gravity flows in disturbing and homogenizing the sedimentary record 

within canyons (taphonomical signal) should also be considered. 



Abstract

While avoiding the major statistical problems potentially associated with percentages, 

Compositional Data Analysis involving the use of isometric log-ratios allowed validation of 

coast-to-ocean ecological trends determined from sediment coccolith percentages. The good 

agreement between the two methods suggests that the coccolith (paleo)ecological signal 

preserved in sediments of the central Portuguese margin is robust, even near the coast and in the 

context of the highly dynamic submarine canyons. 

On the contrary, both coccolith concentrations (nanno/g) and fluxes (nanno/cm
2
/yr) 

showed spatial trends in which ecological inter-relationships appear to be masked by 

sedimentary/taphonomical factors, especially towards the coast and in the submarine canyons. 

The general increase of coccoliths further offshore reflects the oceanic nature of 

coccolithophores, but also physical sorting, resulting in preferential accumulation of coccoliths 

within finer-grained hemipelagic sediments that accumulate in more calm environments of the 

middle and lower slope and in certain parts of the canyons acting as temporary sediment 

morphological traps. Highest coccolith fluxes in the upper canyons reflect their role as 

preferential depocenters of fine-grained particles both lithogenic and biogenic. Biogenic fine 

particles include coccoliths from vertical (productivity - ecological signal) and lateral fluxes 

(resuspension and advection – taphonomical signal). 

 This study strikingly illustrates the rapid response of coccolithophores to short-term 

meteorological and hydrographic variability creating favourable conditions for growth off 

central Portugal. These results contradict the accepted notion of coccolithophores being a 

uniform functional group of calcifying phytoplankton thriving in low-turbulence, low-nutrients 

and high-light environments. Whereas much work still needs to be done concerning the impact 

of the canyons on both oceanography and phytoplankton dynamics off central Portugal, 

coccoliths preserved in the seabed sediment appeared to be useful tracers of the prevailing 

(paleo)ecological and (paleo)oceanographic trends. The results support previous studies focused 

on the complex hydro-sedimentary dynamics prevailing in the Nazaré and Lisbon-Setúbal 

canyons.

General Introduction 

1.1. Coccolithophores 

Coccolithophores are marine, unicellular phytoplankton organisms, belonging to the 

Kingdom Chromista, phylum Haptophyta and division Prymnesiophyceae. They represent the 

main component of extant calcareous nannoplankton (Jordan and Chamberlain, 1997; Jordan et 

al., 2004). Coccolithophores are one of the main groups of marine phytoplankton, 

distinguishable from other groups by the presence of a calcified exoskeleton at some stage in 

their life cycle, composed of numerous minute calcified scales (1-16 µm across), the coccoliths. 

These coccoliths, produced by biomineralization of minuscule calcite crystals arranged 

according to characteristic arrays, exhibit morphological and optical patterns that have 

taxonomic and phylogenetic meaning (Pienaar, 1994; Young, 1994).  

Coccolithophores are among the most important pelagic calcifying organisms in the 

moderns oceans (Baumann et al., 2004; Hay, 2004). Their coccoliths abound in seafloor 

sediments and present one of the most abundant and continuous fossil records since the Late 

Triassic to the present day (e.g. Bown et al., 2004). Coccoliths preserved in the geological 

archive store valuable information on (palaeo)environmental conditions from the photic zone 

(McIntyre and Bé, 1967; Roth, 1994; Baumann et al., 2000; Boeckel and Baumann, 2008) and 

thus can be used as indicators of paleoceanographic processes, sea surface water masses, 

productivity and climate change (e.g. Beaufort et al., 2001; 2011; Flores et al., 2000; Ziveri et 

al., 2004; Silva et al., 2008). 

It is estimated that about 20–60 % in weight of marine pelagic carbonate is produced by 

coccolithophores (Brand, 1994; Winter et al., 1994). Coccoliths are, by far, the most common 

(sub)fossil structure than can be found in a simple smear of ocean sediment, particularly in 

oozes. Therefore, coccolithophores are not only important in the marine ecosystem as primary 

producers, but also as contributors of inorganic carbon to the marine carbonate pump (Bown, 

1998; Rost and Riebesell, 2004). In addition, they are likely to produce additional feedback on 

global climate due to enhanced albedo resulting from the highly reflective masses of detached 

coccoliths and production of dimethylsulphonium propionate – DMSP, thought to play a role in 

reducing solar irradiation (Westbroek et al., 1993; Malin and Steinke, 2004).

Morphology and Biology 

The taxonomy of coccolithophores is based on the morphology and optical properties of 

the coccoliths covering the cell. The crystallographic features of calcite are used to identify 

different coccolithophore species, i.e. the birefringence and extinction patterns of calcite crystals 

when viewed in cross-polarized light, which are distinct for different coccolithophore genera 

according to the specific crystallographic arrangement of their coccoliths (e.g. Young and 

Bown, 1991). 

There are two major groups of coccoliths:  the holococcoliths, composed of numerous 

minute euhedral calcite crystals, whose biomineralization is supposed to occur outside the cell; 

and the heterococcoliths, which are the most common forms in the sediment, composed of 

radially continuous series of variably shaped crystal units biomineralized intracellularly (see 

Piennar, 1994; Young et al., 1997; Young and Henrikson, 2003).  

Within these basic groups, a high morphological diversity is observed. Among the 

heterococcoliths, the most important morphological categories are: placoliths (e.g. Emiliania 

huxelyi, Gephyrocapsa spp., Coccolithus pelagicus s.l., Calcidiscus leptoporus, 

Umbilicosphaera sibogae), helicoliths (e.g. Helicosphaera carteri), caneoliths (e.g. 

Syracosphaera spp., Ophiaster spp., Coronosphaera mediterranea) and rhabdoliths 

(Rhabdosphaera spp., Discosphaera tubifera) (see Young et al., 1997; Cros, 2000) (Figure 1.1). 

 

 

 

Figure 1.1 - Examples of different types of coccospheres and coccoliths (http://www.geo.uni-bremen.de). 

The term “nannoliths” refers to nannofossils which are thought to be related to coccolithophores, but 

exhibiting structures that are neither heterococcoliths nor holococcoliths (e.g. Braarudosphaera 

bigelowi).

General Introduction 

 25 

Coccolithophore cells may have coccoliths that are all of the same size and morphology, 

but they may also have different coccolith forms (i.e. dimorphism and polymorphism e.g. 

Syracosphaera spp.) and sizes. Most coccolithophores have different types of coccoliths for 

distinct life-stages (e.g. C. pelagicus s.l.) (see Piennar, 1994). In most cases, coccoliths are 

arranged in a single layer outside the body organic scales, whereas some taxa may exhibit two 

distinct layers of heterococcoliths of different types (i.e. dithecatism) (Cros, 2000). Others 

produce multi-layered coccospheres composed of numerous uniform coccoliths (e.g. E. huxleyi) 

(see Billard and Inouye, 2004). 

Various explanations have been given for the function of coccoliths: protection of the cell 

membrane, protection from predation, cellular buffering, ballast for increasing sinking rate, 

aiding nutrient absorption in turbulent environments (e.g. placolith-bearing taxa), enhancing 

surface area to decrease sinking in low turbulence environments (e.g. spines and spiral 

coccoliths), light focusing aiding photosynthesis in low-light environments (see Young, 1994). 

The high morphological diversity of coccoliths and coccospheres may also reflect distinctive 

ecological strategies preferred by different coccolithophore taxa; e.g. placolith-bearing taxa are 

more associated to eutrophic environments, such as upwelling areas and shelf-seas, where light 

and nutrient levels are favourable for rapid population growth (r-selected), whereas 

“umbelliform” taxa are more often associated to low-latitude oligotrophic environments (K-

selected) (see Young, 1994) (Figure 1.2) . 

 

 

Figure 1.2 –Ecological distribution of coccolithophore types representing a transect from continental shelf 

to mid-ocean at low latitudes. Arrows represent nutrient supply driven from river runoff and coastal 

upwelling between the continental shelf and slope. Dashed lines are delimiting the lower photic zone 

(adapted from Young, 1994). 

 

 

The life cycle of coccolithophores is heteromorphic, with alternating haploid (mobile and 

flagellate) and diploid generations (non-mobile, without flagellates), produced by mitotic 

division and syngamy, respectively (Figure 1.3). Typically, diploid cells produce 

heterococcoliths, whereas haploid cells produce holococcoliths (see Billard and Inouye, 2004; 

Houdan et al., 2003). “Combination coccospheres” composed of both types of coccoliths are 

interpreted as cells that were captured right after a life-cycle transition (Cros et al., 2000; Geisen 

et al, 2002; Frada et al., 2009). Whereas little is known yet about the factors that trigger phase 



Chapter 1 

 26 

changes in coccolithophores, it has been proposed that phase changes represent an evolutionary 

mechanism for genetic recombination in marine planktonic organisms that are forced to deal 

with constantly changing environmental conditions (Baumann et al., 2005). Other authors have 

proposed that their ability to grow under two phases may have a primary ecological 

significance, either as strategy for a species to exploit a wider range of environmental conditions 

(e.g. Cros et al., 2000), and/or to rapidly escape negative selection pressures carried on one 

stage, such as grazing, parasitic attack or viral infections (Frada et al., 2008), or abrupt 

environmental changes (Noel et al., 2004). 

Reproduction rates observed in the laboratory were highest for Emiliania huxleyi (up to 

2.7 divisions per day), followed by Gephyrocapsa oceanica and Calcidiscus leptoporus (1.2 

div. per day) (Brand, 1982). Field observations by Cachão and Moita (2000) indicated a growth 

rate of 1.4 divisions per day for Coccolithus pelagicus during a moderate upwelling event 

offshore Portugal.

heterococcoliths and holococcoliths, respectively, here illustrated by scanning electron microscope 

images of Calcidiscus leptoporus (left) and Calcidiscus quadriperforatus (right), respectively. The 

combination coccosphere shown in the middle, which has both types of coccoliths, represents a transition 

from haploid to diploid phase (from Young and Henriksen, 2003).

Ecology and Biogeography 

Coccolithophores, like all other photosynthesizing plankton groups, are restricted to the 

photic zone of the oceans. Within this upper ocean layer, turbulence is important in controlling 

access of phytoplankton to light and nutrient. According to the “Margalef Mandala”, which 

classifies phytoplankton groups in terms of their response to nutrients vs. turbulence following a 

mixing event, coccolithophores occupy an intermediate position between diatoms, – fast-

growing r-selected organisms adapted to profit from nutrient availability in eutrophic and 

turbulent environments -, and dinoflagellates – slower-growing K-selected organisms adapted to 

stratified, low-nutrient environments ( Margalef, 1978) (Figure 1.4). However, the “Margalef 

Mandala” was mostly based on the ecological behavior of E. huxleyi, which is nowadays known 

to be a somewhat atypical coccolithophore, often acting as an early succession r-selected species 

and reported to produce extensive blooms in various regions of the ocean (e.g. Winter et al., 

1994; Tyrell and Merico, 2004; Souza et al., 2011).  

As a group, the coccolithophores are considered to be K-selected, as they reach their 

highest diversity and relative abundance within the phytoplankton community in warm, 

stratified oligotrophic waters from low and middle latitude regions, as opposed to eutrophic 

environments such as coastal-neritic waters, where they are less diverse and surpassed in 

abundance by diatoms (e.g. McIntyre and Bé, 1967; Winter et al., 1994; Brand, 1994; Ziveri et 

al., 2004). Nevertheless, several taxa reveal a clear r-selected behaviour, e.g. placolith-bearing 

taxa such as E. huxleyi and G. oceanica, as indicated by their occurrence in blooms in the 

oceans (e.g. Knappertsbusch and Brummer, 1995; Souza et al., 2011) (Figure 1.5), and within 

turbulent coastal and mature upwelled waters (e.g. Ziveri et al., 1995; Baumann et al., 2000; 

Cachão and Moita, 2000; Moita, 2001; Moita et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2008). Overall, 

coccolithophore species appear to be distributed along nutrient gradients from the eutrophic 

coastal and polar regions to oligotrophic central gyres, thus reflecting r- and K-selection 

biological characteristics respectively (Brand, 1994).

The general biogeography and habitat characteristics of coccolithophores are known from 

plankton and seafloor sediment surveys (McIntyre and Bé, 1967; Brand, 1994; Roth, 1994; 

Winter et al., 1994; Young, 1994; Ziveri et al., 2004). Temperature controls the largest-oceanic 

scale distribution following broad latitudinally defined biogeographical zones related with the 

major oceanic water masses (McIntyre and Bé, 1967; Winter et al., 1994). Five major floral 

zones have previously been defined by McIntyre and Bé (1967): Subarctic/antarctic, Temperate, 

Subtropical and Tropical. This broad-scale zonation, however, does not take into account local 

phenomena such as coastal currents, gyres, eddies, upwelling, river runoff, which regionally 

affect their distribution (Cachão and Moita, 2000; Andruleit et al., 2003; Ziveri et al., 2004; 

Andruleit, 2007; Silva et al., 2008; Guerreiro et al., 2013 – see Chapter 2).  

Changes in temperature will most likely affect sub-polar and temperate populations 

whose ecology is dependent on the seasonal thermocline, as opposed to species from subtropical 

regions where a permanent thermocline is present: whereas coccolithophore species are present 

in the tropics during the entire year, in temperate regions, they are only abundant in spring-

summer (e.g. Brand, 1994; Andruleit et al., 2003). Whereas most coccolithophore species 

preferentially dwell in the upper 50–80m of the photic layer, most species appear photo-

inhibited very close to the surface. E. huxleyi, however, stands out for its tolerance to high light 

levels, possibly contributing to its capacity to dominate coccolithophore assemblages (Tyrell 

and Merico, 2004). Other species of coccolithophores live almost exclusively between 100 and 

200 m, in the lower photic zone (e.g. Florisphaera profunda, see Brand, 1994).

General Introduction 

 29 

Vertical Transport and Sedimentation  

Coccoliths provide a particularly useful calibration link with ecological and 

oceanographic conditions since they reflect the hydrological patterns persistent or strong enough 

to be preserved in the fossil record as revealed by several studies. Indeed, although subjected to 

a variety of post-mortem (biostratonomical) processes after death of the coccolithophore cell, 

studies indicate that coccolith thanatocoenosis in surface sediments can be closely related to the 

coccolithophore communities dwelling in the overlying photic layer (e.g. Abrantes and Moita, 

1999; Baumann et al., 2000; 2005; Kinkel et al., 2000; Sprengel et al., 2002; Boeckel and 

Bauman, 2008). Such is the particular case of heavier calcified and resistant forms (C. 

leptoporus, C. pelagicus, H. carteri), which have higher preservation potential, and high cell 

densities species (E. huxleyi, Gephyrocapsa spp.) which are more abundant due to seasonal high 

productivity (e.g. Baumann et al., 2000; Ziveri et al., 2004; Baumann et al., 2005; Boeckel and 

Baumann, 2008). This good correspondence, as well as the good preservation of coccoliths even 

in sediments below the calcite compensation depth, can be attributed to their rapid transfer from 

the photic zone to the sediment through incorporation in fast-sinking faecal pellets produced by 

grazing zooplankton and within marine snow aggregates (Roth, 1994; Steinmetz, 1994; Balch, 

2004). Otherwise, taking the very slow settling of individual coccoliths into account, being on 

the order of a few cm per day, it would take a single coccolith on the order of a century to reach 

the bottom of the ocean, making it very unlikely that it would escape from dissolution and 

displacement by currents far beyond the production area (see Steinmetz, 1994). Faecal pellets, 

in addition to providing rapid transport of intact coccospheres and individual coccoliths at 

average sinking rates of 200 m/day, they also provide protection to coccoliths by enclosing them 

in an organic membrane that acts as a chemical barrier. Whereas one single pellet may carry 

100,000 coccoliths, the mismatch between coccoliths and coccospheres in sediment traps seems 

to be 3-4 order of magnitude (e.g. Broerse et al., 2000; Ziveri et al., 2000ab). This happens 

because the latter are fragile and easily disintegrate after organic membranes holding the 

coccoliths together have been digested by herbivorous zooplankton or metabolized by bacteria 

during transport to the seafloor, while lying on the seafloor, or after burial (Roth, 1994).  

Because of the importance of faecal pellets in the vertical transport of coccoliths, 

coccolith-rich sediments are more commonly found below mixed, productive surface waters 

where coccoliths may not be the dominant phytoplankton group but where grazing is important, 

rather than below oligotrophic waters where coccolithophores are dominant but where grazers 

are less abundant (Balch, 2004). 

Despite the efficiency of faecal pellets in protecting coccoliths and accelerating their 

vertical transport, the correspondence between living coccolithophore communities and 

coccolith assemblages preserved in the seabed is still complex. In the first place because the 

seabed sediment contains a time-integrated collection of the seasonally variable flux of 

coccoliths arriving from the ocean surface layer. Subsequent bioturbation of the uppermost few 

centimetres of sediment will easily mix coccoliths produced over a timespan of hundreds of 

years. On top of that, resuspension of surface sediments by bottom currents may result in sorting 



Chapter 1 

 30 

and selective destruction of coccoliths, whilst coccoliths from allochtonous production or 

reworked from older deposits may be introduced. The result will be a more or less homogenised 

coccolith taphocoenosis. The gradual loss of primary ecological information occurring from the 

initial production of coccolithophores in the photic layer until the final incorporation of 

coccoliths in the sedimentary record was well illustrated by studies performed in the Arabian 

Sea, where coccolithophore species composition in water samples, sediment trap samples and 

surface sediments were compared (Andruleit et al., 2003; Andruleit and Rogalla, 2002; 

Baumann et al., 2005). The study demonstrated that the great variability in plankton samples 

was not preserved in the annual cycle from the sediment traps, whereas the annual mean 

composition from the traps closely resembled the sedimentary record, which represented a 

mixed signal of intra-annual species succession. According to these authors, the good 

correspondence of species composition and relative abundance between the annual mean of 

sediment trap samples and surface sediments suggests that the information record from the traps 

is likely to be transformed into the sediment almost without biases in the species relative 

abundances (Baumann et al., 2005).  

 

 

Coccoliths as (paleo)ecological proxies in coastal regions  

Whereas coccolithophores are generally studied in the oceanic domain where the highest 

concentrations and diversity occur, several studies demonstrated the ability of this group to 

profit from the high nutrient conditions driven by coastal upwelling and river runoff (e.g. 

Cachão and Moita, 2000; Silva et al., 2008; Guerreiro et al., 2013 – Chapter 2). However, the 

relationship between living communities and coccolith species assemblages preserved in the 

seabed may be particularly complex within shallower marine environments such as continental 

shelves (e.g. Steinmetz, 1994; Roth, 1994).  

Dilution by terrigenous material and dissolution caused by oxidation of organic matter in 

sediments are additional factors that affect the concentration and composition of coccolith 

assemblages in sediments from shallow marginal seas (Roth, 1994). In addition, the increasing 

bottom water hydrodynamics towards the coast will expectedly have a major control on 

coccolith accumulation in the sediment; whereas winnowing by waves and currents hampers the 

accumulation of coccoliths in coarse-grained deposits of the shelf and upper slope, coccoliths 

will preferentially accumulate in fine-grained hemipelagic deposits that accumulate in more 

quiescent environments of the middle and lower slope (see Chapter 4). Reworking of sub-fossil 

or fossil specimens by strong bottom currents in continental shelf and slope regions may also be 

a problem when making ecological inferences from sediment coccolith assemblages (e.g. 

Ferreira et al., 2008). Complexity further increases in heterogeneous and dynamic regions such 

as submarine canyons, where the factors above are known to be intensified (i.e. intensified 

coastal dynamics; bottom resuspension by internal tides and gravity flows; De Stigter et al., 

2007; 2011). A deep knowledge of the oceanographic and sedimentary processes prevailing in 

these areas is essential to study coccolith sedimentation in marginal-marine settings, for which a

close cooperation between nannoplankton specialists and physical, chemical and biological 

oceanographers, and marine sedimentologists is required. 

 

 

Coccolithophores off central Portugal  

The first study on the coccolithophores off Portugal was based on the coccoliths 

sedimentary record from shelf-to-slope transects in the Portuguese margin, performed by 

Cachão (1993), revealing a general increase of coccolith species diversity further south. 

Highlights from this study refer to the tendency of Calcidiscus leptoporus and Rhabdosphaera 

spp. to decrease their relative abundance towards the coast, whereas Gephyrocapsa spp. was 

more generally abundant in neritic-coastal regions, and Helicosphaera carteri was more 

abundant north of the Nazaré Canyon. The increase of H. carteri further north was later 

supported by both sediment and water column studies: an extremely high percentage of this 

species (~85 %) was found in sediments from the mouth of the Douro river by Guerreiro et al. 

(2005), interpreted as reflecting an opportunistic behaviour possibly related with locally 

confined nutrient-rich conditions, whereas Moita et al. (2010) observed H. carteri being more 

abundant in the photic layer west of this river, during winter. 

Abrantes and Moita (1999) and Moita (2001) were the first to study the annual (summer-

fall of 1985 to winter-spring of 1986) composition and seasonal spatial variation of 

phytoplankton in the Portuguese continental margin. According to these authors, diatoms were 

the major phytoplankton group during upwelling conditions, whereas coccolithophores were 

dominant (&gt;90 %) during winter, associated with warmer and nutrient-depleted subtropical 

waters flowing onto the Portuguese shelf. Living coccolithophores revealed a broad distribution, 

but more abundant south of the Nazaré Canyon in both summer and winter sampling periods. 

North of Nazaré, this group occurred mainly on the mid- and outer-shelf. The sediment record 

reflected not only the general north-south difference observed in the water column for both 

upwelling and non-upwelling situations, but also the summer water distribution (Abrantes and 

Moita, 1999). According to these authors, the sediment distribution pattern preserved most of 

the original biological spatial variability independent of the sediment lithology and/or 

sedimentary processes acting on the Portuguese shelf, particularly concerning the record of 

coccolithophores produced during blooms.  

More detailed analysis of the coccolithophores communities thriving off Portugal during 

winter was later performed by Cachão et al. (2000). The entrainment of subtropical water 

masses, originating from south of the Azores Front into the Iberian Poleward Current during this 

period, was reflected in coccolithophore assemblages by the occurrence of subtropical species 

like Algirosphaera quadricornu, Alveosphaera bimurata, Cyclolithus annulus, Florisphaera 

profunda, Michaelsarsia elegans, Syracosphaeara lamina and Turrilithus latericioides, along 

with temperate species like Gephyrocapsa muellerae, Gephyrocapsa ericsonii and Emiliania 

huxleyi.

Cachão and Moita (2000) brought new insights on the ecological preferences of C. 

pelagicus, a formerly considered typical sub-arctic coccolithophore species. These authors 

observed living C. pelagicus consistently associated to riverine plumes and shelf-break fronts 

off Portugal, and an increase of its coccolith abundances in surface sediment assemblages off 

Douro, Ave and Cávado rivers (NW Portugal). This was interpreted as reflecting a relation 

between C. pelagicus and moderate turbulence conditions combined with nutrient availability, 

proposing this species as a tracer of the periphery of areas of enhanced productivity. 

Morphometric analysis later performed by Parente et al. (2004) revealed the existence of three 

morphotypes of C. pelagicus (s.l.), each revealing specific ecological features: the smaller-sized, 

related to C. pelagicus subsp. pelagicus, interpreted as a proxy of the influence of subpolar 

Atlantic water masses west of Portugal; the intermediate-size, related to C. pelagicus subsp. 

braarudii, possibly related to coastal upwelling; and the larger, described as C. pelagicus subsp. 

azorinus, which seemed to indicate the influence of water masses driven directly from the 

Azores front.  

More recently, during a four years weekly survey, Silva et al. (2008) performed the first 

systematic investigation of the coccolitophore assemblages from offshore Portugal. This study 

confirmed the general preference of the group for non-upwelling conditions, although certain 

species appeared capable of withstanding coastal turbulence and well-adapted to the nutrient-

rich coastal environment. A recurrent and distinct seasonal succession and interannual 

differences were observed, related with intensity and length of upwelling-downwelling seasons 

(and related temperature variations) and precipitation (and related salinity variations). 

According to these authors, Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa spp. revealed to be good 

proxies for coastal surface productivity waters as they responded quickly to a decrease in 

turbulence during upwelling events, in particular during spring and summer; G. muellerae and 

G. ericsonii were more abundant in colder waters associated with the beginning of the 

upwelling season, whereas Gephyrocapsa oceanica was more productive during summer; C. 

pelagicus was also related to upwelling, possibly responding to shifts in the position of the Cape 

Roca filament relatively to Cascais position; Coronospheara mediterranea, Syracosphaera 

pulchra, H. carteri and Rhabdosphaera clavigera revealed to be tracers of the onflow of 

subtropical warmer and saltier waters over the shelf during the transition from upwelling to 

downwelling season (e.g. Moita et al., 2010); finally, the oceanic preference of C. leptoporus 

was confirmed, revealing to be a good tracer for the convergence of oceanic waters during 

winter.  

In the Nazaré Canyon area, a general characterization of the calcareous nannoplankton 

assemblages preserved in surface sediment samples carried out by Guerreiro et al. (2009) 

suggested that the canyon’s hydro-sedimentary dynamic regime may prevent the deposition 

and/or preservation of the smaller and fragile species (e.g. E. huxleyi and G. ericsonii), while 

enhancing the record of the larger ones (e.g. G. oceanica). Evidences of local enhanced 

productivity are reported from near the canyon possibly related to persistent physical 

phenomena resultant from the canyon’s morphology and proximity to the coast (e.g. solitary 

internal waves; Quaresma et al., 2007), and/or upwelling enhancement in the canyon head .

These hypotheses were later corroborated by a phytoplankton pigments study performed by 

Mendes et al. (2011) in this region; maximum values of 19’ hexanoyloxyfucoxantine, the 

pigment used as a proxy for the coccolithophores, were found north of the canyon, and the 

maximum values of chlorophyll-a were recorded in the inner shelf north of the canyon’s head 

where the highest coccolith abundances were found.  

 

1.2. Submarine canyons 

Submarine canyons are prominent topographic features dissecting the seafloor of most of 

the world’s continental margins, cutting through all substrates, from unlithified sediment to 

crystalline rock. Canyons typically start off on the shelf and upper slope as deeply incised 

valleys generally with a V-shaped profile and with deep and steep, gullied slopes, gradually 

changing to shallower valleys with U-shaped profile as depth increases. At the base of the 

continental slope a great decrease in the canyon wall height occurs, and often the canyon passes 

into deep-sea channels bordered by natural levees (e.g. Shepard, 1964). Whereas some canyons 

cut across the shelf all the way to the coast, others may just indent the outer shelf. Coastal 

canyons typically exhibit sizes comparable to those of Grand Canyon, i.e. width of ~10-30 km 

and depth ~2 km (Hickey, 1995) (see Figure 1.6). 

The formation of submarine canyons results from a dynamic interplay of erosional and 

depositional processes controlled by tectonics, terrestrial sediment input, and regional 

oceanography (Shepard, 1981; Hickey, 1995; Lastras et al., 2009; Masson et al., 2011). Whereas 

canyons are nowadays thought to evolve from localized small furrows on the upper slope along 

which slope instability and sediment failure in the form of gravity-driven flows eventually leads 

to their retrogressive development and enlargement (Pratson and Coakley, 1996; Arzola, 2008; 

Lastras et al., 2009), a limited number of fundamental processes acting in different geological 

and geographic, climatological and oceanographic settings is likely to result on a wide range of 

different canyon morphologies. Geomorphological and sedimentary observations reveal that 

much of their present-day morphology resulted from enhanced sediment transport during 

periods of sea-level low stands, when the continental shelves were exposed and presented a 

better connectivity between fluvial systems and canyon heads (Normark and Piper, 1991).  

During sea-level high stands, submergence of the shelf drastically reduced the role of 

canyons as preferential pathways of coarse sediment towards to the deep-sea, resulting in 

predominant hemipelagic sedimentation (e.g. Weaver and Kuijpers, 1983; Canals et al., 2006; 

Palanques et al., 2008; Martin et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012), with much of the fine-grained and 

organic material transported being nowadays retained in the canyons’ upper and middle sections 

(Van Weering et al., 2002; De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011).  

Nevertheless, those canyons that are deeply incised into the continental shelf still preserve 

a certain degree of activity, as they continue to receive and transport fine-grained sediments 

supplied by coastal and shelf currents. Extreme river floods, strong storm events, dense water 

cascading and earthquakes are considered the most important triggers for the occurrence of 



Chapter 1 

 34 

episodic canyon-flushing events, able to carry sediments from the shelf down to the abyssal 

plain (e.g. Palanques et al., 2005; Canals et al., 2006; Palanques et al., 2005; De Stigter et al., 

2007; 2011; Martin et al., 2011; Masson et al., 2011).  

Closely related to their impressive morphology, submarine canyons are complex, 

heterogeneous and highly dynamic marine environments. While linking the land intimately with 

the deep ocean, canyons may act both as (1) temporary depositories of sediment particles and 

organic matter in transit along the coast and shelf, (2) preferential conduits through which the

transport of particles between the coastal domain and the deep-sea is intensified (e.g. dense-

water cascading and gravity-driven flow events; Schmidt et al., 2001; Van Weering et al., 2002; 

Oliveira et al., 2007; Canals et al., 2006; De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011), and (3) modifiers of 

coastal circulation, interrupting the along-slope geostrophic flow and thus leading to enhanced 

shelf-slope exchange of water and organic/inorganic matter (e.g. Hickey et al., 1986; Durrieu de 

Madron, 1994; Monaco et al., 1999; Puig et al., 2003). Canyons affecting water mass flow and 

sediment exchange between shallower and deeper regions have a strong impact on both pelagic 

and deep-sea benthic biological communities, often reflected in enhanced productivity and 



General Introduction 

 35 

species diversity (e.g. Hickey, 1995; Ryan et al., 2005; Tyler et al., 2009; Cunha et al., 2011; 

Contreras-Rosales et al., 2012; Morris et al., in press). 

Measurements in submarine canyons are among the most difficult in the ocean mostly 

due to their complex and heterogeneous topography and the extremely steep walls, and the 

presence of strong bottom currents (e.g. Hickey, 1997; Masson and Tyler, 2011). The 

introduction of new geophysical techniques has been crucial to allow more detailed 

geomorphological and bottom sedimentary descriptions of these systems, making the canyons 

more accessible to safely obtain sediments samples, CTD profiles and to deploy moored 

instruments. 

 

 

Impact on regional oceanography  

Submarine canyons are areas of increased exchange between oceanic and coastal water 

masses, exhibiting intensified flow and turbulence in comparison to the adjacent shelf and slope, 

potentially affecting coccolithophore communities in their vicinity. Both observations and 

numerical models demonstrate that canyons modify regional current patterns, changing 

magnitude and direction of currents. Pressure-driven, wind-driven and tidal flows dominate 

water motion within canyons (Hickey, 1995; Klinck, 1996; Allen and Durrieu de Madron, 

2009).  

Whereas shelf and slope currents usually follow the isobaths due to geostrophic 

constraints, once they are intersected by canyons, a new dynamic balance that is not geostrophic 

is produced; the along-flow will be focused by the canyon topography until it crosses the 

isobaths, resulting in enhanced cross-slope and cross-shelf exchange along the canyons. This 

cross-isobath flow tends to enhance wind-driven upwelling and downwelling currents, and 

cascading flows of dense water into the ocean. In addition, vertical water movements associated 

to wind-driven currents and internal tidal activity will be locally enhanced in the canyons and 

adjacent areas, due to topographic funneling of water (Hickey, 1997; Allen and Durrieu de 

Madron, 2009).  

Narrow canyons have a relatively strong effect on the oceanographic circulation, whereas 

wider canyons mainly distort the flow to occur along isobaths. Near the sea surface, the flow 

passes unhindered across the canyon, but closer to the canyon rim, the flow is redirected along 

the canyon axis with the occurrence of upwelling or downwelling occurrin depending on the 

direction of the winds (Klinck, 1996; Hickey, 1997; She and Klinck, 2000; Palanques et al., 

2005). The mean flow within a few hundred meters of the canyon floor is predominantly 

directed up- or down-canyon, constituting a very important mechanism for resuspension and 

transport of sediments from the shelf and slope to the deep-sea. Stratification of the water 

column reduces the canyon’s topographic effect on the coastal flow (Klinck, 1996; She and 

Klinck, 2000 and references therein). 

Under upwelling-favorable wind conditions in Eastern Boundary Systems like the 

Portuguese continental margin, downwelling of shelf water occurs along the northern canyon 



Chapter 1 

 36 

rim (upstream side) whereas upwelling occurs along the canyon axis and southern rim 

(downstream side) (Allen, 1996; Hickey, 1997, Klinck, 1996). Large volumes of water are 

pumped out of a canyon during upwelling events, which may result in an onshore flow up to 50 

times more than occurring over the adjacent shelf and slope (Allen, 1996). During strong wind 

events, intensification of upwelling in canyons may result in vertical velocities of up to 80 

m/day (Hickey, 1997), bringing nutrient-rich water from depths up to 300 m to the canyon rim 

and onto the adjacent shelf (She and Klinck, 2000). The up-canyon deflection of deeper offshore 

currents can induce a strong nutrient transport into the euphotic zone, in the continental shelf, 

stimulating primary production on the shelf and nearshore areas (in Skliris and Djenidi, 2006).  

Under downwelling-favorable wind events, the circulation generated within the canyon is 

largely opposite to that forced by upwelling winds, creating strong flow toward the shelf and 

coast resulting in downwelling (Klinck, 1996; She and Klinck, 2000). A 3-D numerical 

modeling study performed for the Calvi Canyon (NW Corsican coast) showed that convergence 

under downwelling-favorable winds is amplified along the canyon, such that the canyon is 

acting as a trap of shelf water (Skliris and Djenidi, 2006). 

In addition to pressure-driven and wind-driven circulation, tidal flows that usually run 

parallel to the shelf-break topography will be intersected by the presence of a narrow submarine 

canyon, resulting in regions of intensified and focused baroclinic tides and internal waves, 

leading to strong vertical mixing within and around the canyon (e.g. Hickey, 1995; Allen and 

Durrieu de Madron, 2009; De Stigter et al., 2007). This process may result in higher particulate 

and nutrient concentrations in the water column within the canyon (e.g. Bosley et al., 2004; 

Ryan et al., 2005). Where canyons cut across the entire width of a continental shelf, the 

interaction between tidal currents and the canyon rim may result in internal waves that 

propagate from the canyon across the adjacent shelf, increasing bottom turbulence and thereby 

favouring bottom sediment resuspension and transport (Huthnance et al., 2002; Quaresma et al., 

2007). 

 

 

Impact on marine ecosystems  

Whereas the majority of studies on submarine canyon ecology are focused on the benthic 

system, exhibiting enhanced productivity associated with the accumulation of labile organic 

matter, a strong response from plankton in the vicinity of canyons has also been reported from 

both in situ observations (e.g. Allen et al., 2001; Bosley et al., 2004; Palanques et al., 2005; 

Ryan et al., 2005; 2010) and numerical models (Skliris and Djenidi, 2006). This is partially 

explained by the enhancement of upwelling at and near the canyons, providing a nutrient source 

that increases phytoplankton and zooplankton productivity (Hickey, 1995; Allen, 1996; Klinck, 

1996). Funneling and trapping of plankton (e.g. Macquart-Moulin and Patriti, 1996; Skliris and 

Djenidi, 2006)) and resuspension phenomena driven by increased bottom turbulence in canyons 

(e.g. Bosley et al., 2004; Ryan et al., 2005) are additional factors leading to enhanced 



General Introduction 

 37 

productivity in these regions. Recirculation within canyons also favors a prolonged residence 

time of nutrients and biota in these areas (Hickey, 1995; 1997; Allen et al., 2001). 

There is strong evidence to suggest that submarine canyons have an important effect on 

the entire marine food chain, from phytoplankton to marine mammals. Some examples are 

given below: 

A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model used to investigate plankton dynamics in the 

Calvi Canyon (NW Corsica) showed maximum concentrations of phytoplankton occurring over 

the canyon and downstream of the canyon mouth, and trapping of phytoplankton biomass by the 

cyclonic circulation within the canyon (Skliris and Djenidi, 2006);  

In the vicinity of Astoria Canyon (west coast of North America), local primary 

production may have a dominant role on the canyon food web in comparison to other potential 

sources. Densities and biomasses of some micronekton species were higher in the canyon in 

comparison to nearby areas, suggesting that the distribution of these organisms was affected by 

currents modified by the canyon topography (Bosley et al., 2004);  

In the Palamós Canyon (NW Mediterranean) chlorophyll concentrations were found to be 

higher in its upper section (from the canyon head to about 1200 m) in comparison to its lower 

section (deeper than 1200 m), suggesting a direct biological input from the coastal productivity 

into the canyon system. Extremely high concentrations of cysts of a variety of planktonic 

organisms, including dinoflagellates, tintinnids and calanoida, were found in sediment traps 

from the Foix Canyon and Palamós Canyon, in comparison to much lower concentrations from 

the slope adjacent to the canyon, suggesting preferential accumulation driven by the 

hydrodynamics prevailing in the canyons and neighboring areas (Della Tommasa et al., 2000; 

Palanques et al., 2005). Alvarez et al. (1996) reported high fish larval density on the rims of 

Palamós canyon, much larger than in the shelf area, whereas Macquart-Moulin and Patriti 

(1996) found accumulations of migratory micronekton crustaceans over submarine canyons on 

the NW Mediterranean. David and Di-Méglio (2012) reported that these canyons are 

preferential sites for gathering of marine mammals, apparently related to food availability; 

In the Barkley Canyon (SW off Canada), superficial zooplankton species were found to 

be carried across the canyon with little deflection from their normal cross-shelf position, 

whereas the deeper species were observed to be displaced in shoreward direction by the currents 

flowing through the canyon (Allen et al., 2001); 

In the Monterey Canyon, interaction between currents and bottom topography was 

reported to have a strong impact on the spatial distribution of phytoplankton. Internal tidal 

pumping of nutrients and resting stages of phytoplankton (i.e. cysts) from the deep shelf and/or 

canyon to the shallow euphotic zone resulted in local phytoplankton production at the surface. 

The upsurge of a wedge-shaped tongue of cold, dense water from the canyon was also reported 

to occur in this canyon, flowing up onto the continental shelf. The intruding water mass was 

observed to entrain a plume of nutrient-rich turbid water from the seafloor up to the surface, 

above which high concentrations of phytoplankton were observed (Ryan et al., 2005; 2010). 

The topographic complexity of canyons, the time-varying nature of currents, and the 

difficulty in sampling dynamic biological populations in such dynamic environments, makes it 



Chapter 1 

 38 

difficult to fully understand the trophic relationships within canyons (Bosley et al., 2004). More 

direct, interdisciplinary and temporal measurements are necessary to understand the nature of 

such interactions (Hickey, 1995; Jordi et al., 2008).   

 

 

1.3. The study area  

Central Portuguese margin  

In comparison to the larger part of the European Margin, the central Portuguese margin 

has a relatively narrow shelf (20–50 km wide and a gradient of&amp;lt;1°), passing into a steep 

irregular slope (6–7°) below the shelf-break which is located at 160-200 m depth. The margin is 

dissected by a number of long submarine canyons, of which the Nazaré and Setúbal–Lisbon 

canyons are the most remarkable (e.g. Vanney and Mougenot, 1981; Mougenot, 1989; Alves et 

al., 2003). The complex morphology and geology of the margin results from a strong structural 

heritage from deep variscan structures, later affected by Mesozoic extensional tectonics related 

to the opening of the North Atlantic, and by Cenozoic compression resulting from the collision 

of the European and African plates. Since the Miocene, the northern margin has experienced 

major subsidence, which allowed the build-up of thick prograding sedimentary series, 

particularly on the shelf and slope. The shelf is composed of thick Cenozoic carbonate and 

detritic formations, filling structural basins formed during earlier rifting phases (e.g. Vanney 

and Mougenot, 1981; Rodrigues, 2004; Alves et al., 2003).  

Surface sediments on the shelf are generally very coarse and sand-dominated, and include 

old littoral deposits formed during the Holocene transgression preserved at shallow water 

depths. Finer-grained sediments generally increase with depth on the shelf, but also occur in 

muddy deposits located off the estuaries, in structural depressions at the middle shelf and in the 

canyons upper reaches. At present, terrigenous sediment supply to the margin is relatively 

limited, especially since the major rivers Tejo, Douro and Minho have been extensively 

dammed over the past decades (Dias et al., 2002). Still, it is subjected to the discharge of the 

more important Portuguese rivers, as well as to a seasonally highly energetic regime (waves and 

tides). Cliff and beach erosion, reworking of shelf deposits and biogenic production constitute 

additional sources of sediment (Dias, 1987; Van Weering et al., 2002; Oliveira et al., 2002; 

2007). Further down in the continental slope, sediments change from slightly coarser and 

compositionally variable on the upper slope towards more uniform fine-grained and carbonate-

richer hemipelagic muds on the deeper slope (De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011). 

Surface water circulation along the Portuguese margin is directly dependent on two major 

current systems that transport surface water masses from west to east across the Atlantic: the 

North Atlantic Current and the Azores Current south of Iberia (Saunders, 1982; Pollard and Pu, 

1985; Barton, 2001; Peliz et al., 2005), both smoothly feeding into the near-surface equatorward 

flow of the Portugal and Canary currents (Saunders, 1982; Barton, 2001). Underneath, the 

Iberian Poleward Current (IPC) can be recognized traveling poleward, counter to the general 



General Introduction 

 39 

circulation and closely bound to the continental slope. This current is mostly restricted to the 

subsurface layers along most of the eastern subtropical gyre, but it surfaces whenever the Trade 

Winds weaken or turn northward (Barton, 2001) (see Figure 1.7). 

Circulation over the Portuguese shelf and upper slope displays a marked seasonal 

variation: during summer, the Azores high pressure system migrates towards the central 

Atlantic, typically inducing Trade Winds to become northerly, inducing the upwelling of colder, 

less salty and nutrient enriched subsurface water to rise to the surface along the Portuguese 

coast (e.g. Fiúza, 1983; Haynes et al. 1993; Barton, 2001; Relvas et al., 2007; Alvarez et al., 

2011); during winter, the Iceland low pressure system intensifies and the dominant wind regime 

becomes southerly along the western Portuguese margin, inducing the IPC to rise over the upper 

slope and shelf and resulting in downwelling conditions over the shelf (Fiúza, 1983; Vitorino et 

al., 2002). Typical winter wave conditions are swells from NW and SW with significant wave 

heights of 3–4 m, often exceeding 5 m during stormy periods, whereas during summer, a low 

energy wave regime occurs, reaching mean significant wave heights&amp;lt;2 m (Vitorino et al., 

2002). River runoff is an important feature of the winter circulation over the western Portuguese 

margin. Significant discharge particularly from the NW Portuguese rivers (Mondego, Douro, 

Minho, Lima, Vouga) results in the formation of low salinity water lenses in the coastal ocean 

(Peliz et al., 2005). 

The upper 500 m of water column off Portugal is mostly constituted by the Eastern North 

Atlantic Central Water (ENACW), which is the main source of the nutrient-rich upwelled 

waters on the Portuguese coast, and reveals two main components of different origin, 

converging to this region (Fiúza, 1984; McCave and Hall, 2002): a lighter, relatively warm and 

salty subtropical branch (ENACWst) formed along the Azores Front, which gradually loses its 

characteristics as it travels further northwards along the Iberian margin; a less saline colder 

water mass of subpolar origin (ENACWsp) slowly flowing southwards below the poleward 

subtropical branch (Fiúza et al., 1998). Underneath the ENACW a strong salinity gradient is 

noticed down to the core of the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) lying at ~800–1400 m 

depths (see Figure 1.7). The deeper water masses below the MOW comprise the Northeast 

Atlantic Deep Water (NEADW) below 2000 m, and the Lower Deep Water (LDW) at levels &amp;lt;

4000 m (Van Aken 2000ab).  

 

 

Nazaré and Lisbon-Setúbal Canyons 

The Nazaré and Lisbon-Setúbal canyons are the largest submarine canyons of the central 

Portuguese margin, extending from near the shore to abyssal depth (Figure 1.7), and acting as 

preferential dispersal pathways of particulate matter and attached pollutants from the coast to 

the deep sea (De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011; Richter et al., 2009; Jesus et al., 2010; Martin et al., 

2011). Their morphology, sedimentary processes and impact on the biological communities 

have been described in recent literature (e.g. Van Weering et al., 2002; De Stigter et al., 2007; 

2011; Oliveira et al., 2007; Arzola et al., 2008; Lastras et al., 2009; Garcia et al., 2007; 2010; 



Chapter 1 

 40 

Martin et al., 2011; Masson et al., 2011; Koho et al., 2007; 2008; Tyler et al., 2009; Cunha et 

al., 2011; Mendes et al., 2011), following extensive research performed in the framework of 

several scientific projects, both Portuguese (i.e. SEPLAT, 1974-2005; DEEPCO, 2006-2009) 

and European (OMEX II, 1997-2000; EUROSTRATAFORM, 2002-2005; HERMES, 2005-

2009; HERMIONE, 2009-2012). 

The present morphology of the Nazaré and Lisbon-Setúbal canyons results from erosive 

processes occurring at least since the middle Miocene. Their location appears to be, at least in 

part, controlled by the geological structure of the Portuguese Margin. The NE-SW general 

orientation of the canyons is roughly parallel to pre-existing faults of late-Variscan age, both 

onshore and offshore (see Vanney and Mougenot, 1990; Alves et al., 2003; Lastras et al., 2009). 

Such faults represent areas of relative weakness on the slope, thus susceptible to be eroded by

gravity flows, and leading to the progressive headward erosion of the canyons (Pratson and 

Coackley, 1996; Arzola, 2008).  

The presence of large sedimentary levees along the lower course of the Nazaré and 

Setúbal canyons indicates that the two canyons acted as conduits for large-scale sediment

transport to the deep-sea, contributing turbiditic sediments to the Tagus and Iberia Abyssal 

Plains, at least since the Miocene. Sediment core analysis indicates that highest sedimentation 

rates in this area mostly occurred during sea-level low stands of glacial times (Arzola et al., 

2008). Turbidity currents were the dominant processes of sediment erosion, transport and 

deposition in the two canyons during glacial times. Closely-spaced stacks of thin turbidite layers 

that are commonly observed in late-glacial deposits from the lower canyon are thought to be 

generated by fluvial processes directly affecting the upper canyons. Larger-volume canyon-

flushing events triggered by earthquakes were relatively less common during glacial periods. 

During the Holocene, little sediment appears to have reached the abyssal plain through 

the canyons with their upper and middle sections acting as sediment morphological traps, as 

revealed by exceptionally high sedimentation rates recorded in these regions (De Stigter et al., 

2007; 2011; Masson et al., 2011; Martin et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the Nazaré and Lisbon- 

Setúbal canyon still exhibit a certain degree of activity, mostly controlled by internal tidal 

dynamics and sediment gravity flows triggered by meteorological forcing (Oliveira et al., 2007; 

De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011; Martin et al., 2011). The present-day activity appears different for 

the two canyons, probably related to their different geographical setting and morphology.  

The Nazaré Canyon is one of the largest and deepest submarine canyons of the European 

Margin, cutting across the full width of the central Portuguese margin, with its head located at 

~50 m water depth and less than 1 km from the shore. Although it is presently not connected to 

a major modern drainage system, it is recognized as a major sediment pathway among European 

canyons, obtaining its sediment input by capture of particles transported by littoral drift (Duarte 

et al., 2000) and along the shelf (Oliveira et al., 2007; De Stigter et al., 2007).  

In the upper and middle parts of the Nazaré Canyon, sediments are continuously 

resuspended and transported by strong internal tidal currents, as reflected by high turbidity 

values in bottom waters (up to 300 m above the bottom), high horizontal and vertical sediment 

fluxes in the bottom water layer. The diminishing strength of tidal currents down-canyon results 

in focused sediment deposition in the middle canyon, as revealed by high sediment 

accumulation rates observed in sediment traps and sediment cores in that area (De Stigter et al., 

2007; Masson et al., 2011) (Figure 1.8). Transport of fine-grained sediments further down to the 

lower canyon occurs through the action of intermittent gravity-driven flows triggered by 

resuspension of shelf sediments by winter storms and enhanced input of sediments by the 

flooding of rivers north of the canyon and around the canyon head. The deep indentation of the 

canyon into the coastline and high exposure to incoming westerly storms certainly contributes to 

enhanced sediment input (Oliveira et al., 2007; De Stigter et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2011; 

Masson et al., 2011). Transport of coarser sand-sized material to the lower canyon only occurs 

in centennial or longer time scales, with the most recent turbidite layer found in this region 

interpreted as representing a canyon-flushing event triggered by the 1755 AD Lisbon 

Earthquake (Figure 1.9) (De Stigter et al., 2007). Despite of the apparently less energetic 

environment in the lowermost part of the canyon at the present, coarse gravel exposed in the 

canyon walls indicates a much more active dynamics in the past, with catastrophic processes 

capable of transporting boulders up to 1 m across (Tyler et al., 2009). 



Chapter 1 

 42 

Although connected with two major river systems, i.e. Tagus and Sado rivers, the Lisbon-

Setúbal Canyon appears to be much less dynamic than Nazaré Canyon, and presently inactive in 

terms of down-canyon mass sediment transport (De Stigter et al., 2011). Unlike the Nazaré 

Canyon, gravity-driven sediment flows appear rare at present in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon. In 

addition, an overall up-canyon flow was observed to produce a net transport of suspended 

sediment toward the canyon head rather than disperse sediment down-canyon. In the middle and 

lower parts of the canyon, the sediment is essentially hemipelagic, similar to the sediment found 

on the adjacent continental slope (De Stigter et al., 2011). The location of the heads of the 

Lisbon and Setúbal canyon branches at somewhat deeper water a few km off the coast, and the 

relatively sheltered position of the upper canyon behind prominent coastal capes, probably 

contribute to its low present-day sedimentary activity. During sea-level low-stands, however, 

the heads of the Lisbon and Setúbal canyon branches were probably indenting the estuaries of 

the Tagus and Sado rivers (Dias et al., 2000), thereby funneling large amounts of sediments to 

the deep-sea through high-energy and erosive turbidity currents similar to those reported from 

the Nazaré Canyon (Arzola et al., 2008; Lastras et al., 2009).

Little is known yet about the influence of the central Portuguese canyons on the 

productivity and distribution of phytoplankton assemblages. The focus of biological research in 

these canyons has been directed at understanding the functioning of benthic ecosystems, related 

to the fact that the canyons are recognized as major temporary depocenters and conduits of 

organic-rich particles to the deep-sea (Garcia and Thomsen, 2008; Masson et al., 2010; Garcia 

et al., 2010), and sites of high heterogeneity in terms of substrate and physical processes. The 

Portuguese canyons appear to have an important role in modifying abundance and diversity 

patterns that are normally observed in continental slope environments (Cunha et al., 2011). A 

large variety of faunal species was observed in the Nazaré Canyon by Tyler et al. (2009), 

suggesting the canyon represents a biodiversity hotspot. However, lower abundance of 

meiobenthos observed along the axis of the upper Nazaré Canyon by Koho et al. (2007, 2008)

and Garcia et al. (2007) was interpreted to result from the prevailing strong bottom currents and 

unstable sedimentary conditions, whereas higher abundances on the sediment-draped terraces 

and further downslope on the flat-floored middle and lower canyon sections (3000–5000-m 

water depth) suggest that benthic organisms actively profit from fresh organic matter that is 

episodically flushed from the upper canyon and deposited there (Koho et al., 2007; Garcia et al., 

2007). High abundance coupled with low biodiversity was also observed in macrofauna from 

the upper part of Nazaré and Lisbon-Setúbal canyons in comparison to the adjacent slope 

regions (Cunha et al., 2011).  

Mendes et al. (2011) performed the first investigation on the distribution and composition 

of phytoplankton assemblages in the Nazaré Canyon, during an upwelling event, on the basis of 

phytoplankton pigments. According to these authors coccolithophores appeared most common 

outside the upwelling areas, in stratified and nutrient-poor waters. Maximum values of 19’ 

hexanoyloxyfucoxantine, a pigment that represents a proxy for coccolithophores, were noticed 

north of the canyon and the maximum concentrations of phytoplankton biomass (i.e. Chl-a  

were found in the inner shelf north of the canyon’s head. The other two dominant 

phytoplanktonic groups – diatoms and dinoflagellates – were more abundant in nutrient-rich 

upwelled waters along the coast. Contrasting nutrient conditions north and south of the canyon 

were interpreted as resulting from the interaction between the canyon topography and upwelling 

currents, in particular the intensification of upwelling in the canyon head and southern canyon 

rim and nearby shelf.

1.4. Framework and Objectives of the Thesis 

The central Portuguese Margin and the Nazaré and Lisbon-Setúbal canyons have been the 

subject of studies carried out in the framework of several scientific projects over the past 

decades. The SEPLAT
1
 national program (1974-2005) was designed and developed by the 

Portuguese Hydrographic Institute with the purpose of identifying the nature and extension of 

the sedimentary deposits offshore Portugal and to produce the cartographic map of the 

superficial sediments from the Portuguese Continental Shelf, at 1:150,000. Over 12600 

sediment samples were collected in the course of around 30 hydrographical cruises, providing 

the fundamental basis of several research studies and training in the course of the last decades 

(Bizarro, 2010). The OMEX-I
1
 (1993-1996) (Wollast and Chou, 1996) and OMEX-II

1
 (1997–

2000) (Van Weering and McCave, 2002) projects, investigated the exchange of particulate and 

dissolved matter, with special focus on the exchange of organic carbon across the continental 

margin of, respectively, the northern Bay of Biscay and NW Iberia. Some work was dedicated 

to the Lisbon Canyon (Jouanneau et al., 1998) and Nazaré Canyon (Van Weering et al., 2002). 

The EUROSTRATAFORM project
1
 (2002-2005) (Weaver et al., 2006) was more directly 

focused on exploring the role of canyons as preferential conduits of sediment transport to the 

deep ocean, using among others the Nazaré and Lisbon-Setúbal canyons as examples of 

contrasting sedimentary systems (Weaver, 2006). The DEEPCO
1
 national project (2006-2009) 

aimed to investigate the geomorphological, geophysical, sedimentary features of the submarine 

canyons dissecting the NW Portuguese continental shelf, notably the Porto, Aveiro and Nazaré 

canyons (Guerreiro et al., 2005-2006). More recently, the projects HERMES
1
 (2005-2009) 

(Weaver and Gunn, 2009) and HERMIONE
1
 (2009-2012) (Weaver et al., 2009) had a broader 

multidisciplinary approach, covering geology, oceanography and biology. The main purpose of 

these projects was the mapping and understanding of the marine ecosystems on the European 

continental slope, including man’s influence on these ecosystems. A very significant amount of 

oceanographical, geological and biological data was acquired from the two canyon systems 

during these projects, much of which has been published in recent literature.  

As the Portuguese canyons were found to constitute major temporary traps of organic-

rich sediment (see Van Weering et al., 2002; De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011), most biological 

studies were directed at the benthic ecosystems profiting of organic matter enrichment (e.g. 

Koho et al., 2007; 2008; Garcia et al., 2007; Amaro et al., 2009; Tyler et al., 2009; Cunha et al., 

2011). Little attention was given to the phytoplankton communities thriving in these regions. 

The main purpose of this thesis consists in filling this gap, focusing on the coccolithophores.  

The central hypothesis of this thesis, supported by field observations and results from

General Introduction

numerical models, is that enhanced coast-shelf-slope exchange within submarine canyons is 

capable of affecting the dynamics of plankton ecosystems (see Hickey, 1995; Kampf, 2006; 

Skliris et al., 2002; Bosley et al., 2004; Skliris and Djenidi, 2006; Ryan et al., 2005; 2010). The 

present dissertation aims to (a) investigate the effects of the central Portuguese canyons on the 

ecology of recent coccolithophores, along coast-ocean transects, along and outside the canyons, 

(b) explore the potential of coccoliths as tracers of oceanographic processes occurring at the 

central Portuguese margin, namely those related to the submarine canyons. In order to achieve 

this, water column and surface sediment samples were analysed to study the coccolithophore 

living communities (i.e. biocoenosis) and sub-fossil coccolith assemblages (i.e. 

thanatocoenosis), respectively. Data obtained from the water column and surface sediment are 

compared and integrated within a multidisciplinary and multi-proxy approach. Particular focus 

is attributed to the Nazaré Canyon.  

 

In more specific terms, the present study aims to address: 

 

(1) the coccolithophore assemblages currently thriving in the Nazaré Canyon region, and the 

ecological preferences and spatial (lateral and vertical) distribution of individual taxa;  

(2) the relationship between the ecology of coccolithophores and the environmental 

(meteorological and hydrographical) settings off central Portugal; 

(3) the potential role of the Nazaré Canyon topography on the distribution, productivity and 

ecology of living coccolithophores; 

(4) the (paleo)ecological and (paleo)oceanographical differences between the Nazaré and the 

Lisbon-Setúbal canyons, and between the canyons and their adjacent shelf-slope regions; 

(5) the extraction of  the (paleo)ecological signal within the coccolith sediment assemblages, 

independent from the intensified taphonomical effects in submarine canyons and coastal 

settings; 

(6) the introduction of Compositional Data Analysis (i.e. the isometric log-ratio approach) as a 

new procedure to validate and obtain consistent (paleo)ecological interpretations. 

 

 

1.5. Outline of the Thesis 

This study presents data on living coccolithophore concentrations (cells per litre) from 

surface waters of the Nazaré Canyon region, collected during a late winter period, and coccolith 

species concentrations (nanno per gram of sediment) obtained from surface sediments collected 

over a wider area in the central Portuguese margin, including the Nazaré, Lisbon-Setúbal and 

Cascais canyons, and their adjacent shelf-slope areas off Cape Mondego, Estremadura spur and 

off Cape Sines. The complete list of samples, respective positions, depth and analysed proxies is 

presented in Appendix D. Results are integrated and discussed within a significant and 



Chapter 1 

 46 

multidisciplinary data set concerning the ecological and hydrological late-winter characteristics 

off central Portugal, and topographic and sedimentological features of the seabed. 

In Chapter 2, a general characterization of the late winter coccolithophore communities 

thriving in the Nazaré Canyon region is presented. Hydrographic and meteorological variability 

during the winter-spring transition are taken into consideration while interpreting the ecological 

preferences of coccolithophores. The impact of short-term environmental changes on the 

productivity and ecology of this group, and the rapid response of certain species to nutrient 

input, are investigated and discussed.  

In Chapter 3, the impact of the Nazaré Canyon topography on the spatial distribution and 

ecological preferences of the late winter coccolithophore assemblage is investigated, whereas 

the potential of certain species as tracers of oceanographic phenomena occurring in the canyon 

during this time of the year is explored. Results presented here are part of the ongoing 

investigation by the Portuguese Hydrographic Institute of the complex dynamics of the Nazaré 

Canyon (biological, physical and sedimentary), in relation with the seasonal circulation pattern 

prevailing west of central Portugal.  

Chapter 4 deals with the coccoliths preserved in surface sediment samples from the 

central Portuguese margin. North-South and onshore-offshore trends in coccolith concentrations 

and species percentages were analysed in relationship with sediment characteristics (i.e. 

sediment bulk composition, particle size, accumulation rate) to investigate to what extent these 

assemblages reflect a primary ecological signal related to surface water oceanography, and to 

what extent they are modified by taphonomical processes including reworking by bottom water 

currents. A comparison is made between the ecological and sedimentary dynamics of Nazaré 

Canyon and the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, and between the canyons and adjacent shelf-slope 

areas. 

Chapter 5 is of a more methodological nature; a review of the factors controlling the 

sedimentation of coccoliths in coastal settings is presented, and the Compositional Data 

Analysis (CoDA) is introduced as a new statistical tool to study the coccolith assemblages, and 

to confirm the effect of submarine canyons on the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores. Results 

from using CoDA are compared to those obtained from classical analytical methods, (i.e. 

coccolith concentrations - nanno/g; coccolith fluxes - nanno/cm
2
/yr; and percentages), and 

further discussed.  

Chapter 6 synthesises the results presented in the previous chapters, with the aim of 

conceiving a general conceptual model for the role of the canyons in the (paleo)ecology and 

taphonomy of coccolithophores. It includes a qualitative comparison between the living 

communities and the recent coccolith assemblages preserved on the seafloor. The potential of 

coccoliths as (paleo)ecological and (paleo)oceanographic proxies in coastal settings and tracers 

of oceanographic processes prevailing within and around submarine canyons is discussed. 

Finally, proposals for future research are presented. 

 

 



General Introduction

1.6. Material and Methods 

 A total of 219 samples were analysed for the study of coccolithophores and coccoliths 

(see Appendix D). A detailed description of the sampling, laboratory work and microscope 

analysis used in this study - including the analysis of nutrients, Chl-a concentrations and 

acquisition of satellite imagery, which were performed by other researchers -  is included in 

each chapter of the thesis, and hence only a brief overview is presented below.  

 

 

Sampling  

127 Water samples were collected at discrete depth levels (between 5 and 110 m depth) 

from 39 CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) casts around the Nazaré Canyon region. 

Sampling was conducted between 9 and 19 of March 2010, on board of NRP “Almirante Gago 

Coutinho” during the 2
nd

 HERMIONE scientific cruise. CTD profiling and water column 

samples were collected using a combined Neil Brown MKIIIC CTD profiler equipped with an 

Aquatracka nephelometer, a Seapoint fluorometer and a rosette sampler (12 Niskin bottles of 8 

l) (Figure 1.10). Additional samples were collected to analyse nutrients and chlorophyll-a. 

92 Surface sediment samples were taken from the top 0.5 or 1 cm of box- and multicores, 

collected along six transects crossing the central Portuguese margin in an approximately E-W 

direction, along the Nazaré and Lisbon-Setúbal canyons and along adjacent shelf and slope 

areas. Sediment coring was performed during several cruises with RV Pelagia of Royal NIOZ 

between 2002 and 2011, in the framework of the European projects EUROSTRATAFORM and 

HERMES, and the Dutch scientific projects ‘‘Lead in Canyons’’ and “Pacemaker” (Figure 

1.10).  

 

 

Laboratory and Microscope Analysis 

For the study of coccolithophores, seawater samples of around 2 l were filtered over 

cellulose acetate filters (47 mm diameter and 0.45 ?m pore size) using a low pressure vacuum 

system. Coccospheres (cells) were identified and counted from a randomly chosen section of 

each filter, cut and permanently mounted on a glass slidewith a synthetical resin (Entellan), 

using polarized light microscope (PLM) (Olympus BX-40) at 1250× magnification. The number 

of cells per liter (cells/l) was estimated according to Cros (2001). To refine the taxonomic 

differentiation of certain groups, 18 samples were investigated using Scanning Electron 

Microscope (SEM Hitachi S-3500N, at 5 kV). 

For the study of sediment coccolith assemblages, a minimum of 300 individual coccoliths 

were counted and identified from slides previously prepared according to the random settling 

procedure (Flores and Sierro, 1997), using PLM. To minimize possible bias by differential 

dissolution, only coccolithophore species producing relatively large and more robust coccoliths 

(? 3 µm) were considered for the (paleo)ecological analysis.

General Introduction 

 49 

Taxonomic identification of coccolithophores from both seawater and sediment samples 

was performed according to Jordan et al. (2004). 

As most of the sedimentological data presented in this thesis have been previously 

presented and discussed by De Stigter et al. (2007, 2011), Jesus et al. (2010) and Costa et al. 

(2011), the reader is referred to these authors for a complete description of the analytical 

methodology used to determine the sediment bulk composition, particle size and sediment 

accumulation rates. 

 

 

Statistical analysis 

Statistical multivariate analysis (r-mode Factor Analysis, by Statistica 10) and Spearman 

correlation were used to investigate the relationship between coccolithophore taxa and the 

environmental conditions. The analyses were performed upon data matrices with 

coccolithophore data and the associated environmental proxies as columns (variables) Chapters 

2, 3 and 4).  

The isometric log-ratio (ilr) approach of Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) (Egozcue 

et al., 2003) was used to test and validate the results obtained from the coccolith percentages 

(Chapter 5). Six compositional balances were determined by applying a sequential binary 

partition to seven taxonomic groups, based on our pre-knowledge of their ecological preferences 

from the scientific literature (e.g. Winter et al., 1994; Cachão and Moita, 2000; Cachão et al., 

2000; Silva et al., 2008), and from the species percentages (Chapters 4 and 5). A balance-

dendrogram representing the six isometric log-ratios was automatically obtained using 

CODAPACK software (Version 2.01.13).

Abstract 

Coccolithophore communities collected during late winter (9–19 March of 2010) over the 

central Portuguese margin showed a major change in species abundance and composition within 

a few days’ time, closely related to the highly transient meteorological and oceanographic 

conditions.  

Particularly favourable conditions for coccolithophore growth resulted from late winter 

continental runoff combined with northerly winds prevailing over the shelf, under clear sky 

conditions. A nutrient-rich Buoyant Plume (BP) resulting from intense river water runoff prior 

to and during the start of the cruise, was observed to spread out over the denser winter mixed 

layer water beneath, and extend equatorwards and offshore under influence of Ekman 

superficial dynamics. Stabilization of buoyancy, settling of suspended sediment from the BP 

and the prevailing clear sky conditions in the transition to the 2
nd

 leg of the cruise resulted in 

optimum conditions for coccolithophores to develop, at the expense of nutrient availability in 

the superficial sunlit layer. Within a few days, coccolithophore cell densities and associated 

phytoplankton biomass more than tripled, reaching maximum values of 145,000 cells/l and ~13 

mg/l Chl-a, respectively.  

Often considered as a uniform functional group of calcifying phytoplankton thriving in 

low-turbulence, low-nutrients and high-light environments, results presented in this study 

clearly show that coccolithophore life strategies are much more diverse than expected. The 

increase of cell densities was mainly due to the bloom of Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa 

oceanica in the coastal region west off Cape Carvoeiro, together with other opportunistic 

phytoplankton genera (Chaetoceros s.l., Thalassiosira s.l and Skeletonema s.l.). This confirms 

their role as early succession r-selected taxa, capable of rapid growth within nutrient-rich 

environments. On the contrary, Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. displayed the 

characteristics of K-selected species, being consistently more abundant in more oceanic and less 

eutrophic waters, away from the influence of the BP, during both low- and high-productive 

periods.  

 



Chapter 2

A general description of coccolithophore communities as well as the environmental 

conditions during this period is presented in this study (i.e. hydrography and nutrient 

availability). Multivariate analysis was used to investigate the impact of short-term 

environmental changes on the productivity and ecology of this group. In view of the observed 

dominance of coccolithophores off Portugal during winter, this transitional period appears 

particularly favourable for coccolithophores to develop. The results highlight the importance of 

taking short-term hydrographic and meteorological variability into account when interpreting 

the ecological preferences of coccolithophores from coastal-neritic-oceanic transitional settings.

2.1. Introduction 

Coccolithophores are a major group of unicellular marine phytoplankton, representing the 

main component of extant calcareous nannoplankton. Their ability to produce delicate calcite 

platelets, the coccoliths, combined with their ocean-wide distribution, makes them the most 

productive calcifying organisms on Earth, with remarkable potential as paleoenvironmental 

markers (e.g. Winter et al., 1994; Ziveri et al., 2004; Silva et al., 2008). In addition to their 

unique role in the marine carbon cycle, forming part of both the biological and carbonate pumps 

(Rost and Riebesell, 2004), they are likely to produce additional feedback to climate due to their 

physical (albedo increase resulting from the highly reflective masses of detached coccoliths) and 

biochemical (production of dimethylsulphonium propionate - DMSP) characteristics 

(Westbroek et al., 1993; Malin and Steinke, 2004). 

The general biogeography and habitat characteristics of coccolithophores are known from 

plankton and bottom sediment surveys (McIntyre and Bé, 1967; Brand, 1994; Roth, 1994; 

Winter et al., 1994; Young, 1994; Ziveri et al., 2004). The group is usually associated with 

oligotrophic conditions in warm and stratified waters from low and middle latitude regions (e.g. 

McIntyre and Bé, 1967; Winter et al., 1994; Ziveri et al., 2004). However, local phenomena 

such as coastal currents, gyres, eddies, upwelling, river runoff, are known to regionally affect 

their productivity (Cachão and Moita, 2000; Ziveri et al., 2004). Studies of modern 

coccolithophores suggest that their ecology is mostly controlled by light and nutrient 

availability rather than by temperature and water stratification alone. This is indicated by their 

occurrence in blooms (e.g. Knappertsbusch and Brummer, 1995; Souza et al., 2011) in the 

context of subtropical oligotrophic gyres or within turbulent coastal and mature upwelled waters 

(e.g. Ziveri et al., 1995; Baumann et al., 1999; 2000; Cachão and Moita, 2000; Moita, 2001; 

Moita et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2008). More regional studies on living coccolithophores are 

required to calibrate their specific local ecological tolerances and to assess their potential for 

local paleoceanographic reconstructions (e.g. Andruleit et al., 2003). 



Late winter coccolithophore bloom 

55 

The central Portuguese margin (Figure 2.1) is part of the North Atlantic Upwelling 

Region (see Relvas et al., 2007), and located on the boundary between the transitional and the 

subtropical coccolithophore biogeographical zones (McIntyre and Bé, 1967). In a number of 

important studies on the coccolithophore assemblages living off Portugal, the group generally 

appears to be dominant over diatoms during winter, when warmer and nutrient-depleted 

subtropical waters flow onto the Portuguese shelf (Abrantes and Moita, 1999; Cachão and 

Moita, 2000; Cachão et al., 2000; Cachão and Oliveira, 2000; Silva et al., 2008, 2009; Moita et 

al., 2010). The entrainment of subtropical water masses, originating from south of the Azores 

Front into the Iberian Poleward Current during winter, is reflected in coccolithophore 

assemblages by the occurrence of subtropical species like Algirosphaera quadricornu, 

Alveosphaera bimurata, Cyclolithus annulus, Florisphaera profunda, Michaelsarsia elegans, 

Syracosphaeara lamina and Turrilithus latericioides, along with temperate species like 

Gephyrocapsa muellerae, Gephyrocapsa ericsonii and Emiliania huxleyi (Cachão et al., 2000). 

More recently, during a four years weekly survey, Silva et al. (2008) performed the first 

systematic investigation of the coccolithophore assemblages from offshore Portugal. This study 

confirmed the preference of the group for non-upwelling conditions, although certain species 

appeared capable of withstanding coastal turbulence and well-adapted to the nutrient-rich 

coastal environment (i.e. E. huxleyi, Gephyrocapsa oceanica). Later, Moita et al. (2010) 

identified the assemblage composed by Helicosphaera carteri, Syracosphaera pulchra and 

Coronosphaera mediterranea as a summer tracer of subtropical waters upwelled along the 

southwestern and southern coast of Portugal. 

Here we report on coccolithophore assemblages collected during a two-leg hydrographic 

and plankton survey west off Portugal, during a late winter period (9–19 March 2010) at the end 

of an exceptionally negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation. A detailed characterization 

of the living assemblages is presented, as well as a general description of the meteorological and 

oceanographic conditions during the cruise (i.e. wind, hydrography, chlorophyll-a and nutrient 

availability). Our aim is to investigate the impact of the transient environmental settings on the 

ecology and productivity of this group in the central Portuguese margin. 

 

 

2.2. Regional setting 

The central Portuguese margin has a relatively narrow shelf (20–50 km wide and a 

gradient&amp;lt;1º), which at 100–200 m depth passes into a steep irregular slope (6º–7º). The shelf is 

composed of thick (&gt;1000 m) Cenozoic sediments covering a Mesozoic substrate (Jouanneau et 

al., 1998) and dissected by a number of long submarine canyons, namely the Nazaré, Cascais 

and Setúbal–Lisbon canyons (e.g. Vanney and Mougenot, 1981; Alves et al., 2003; Lastras et 

al., 2009).  

Surface water circulation along the Portuguese margin is directly dependent on two major 

current systems that transport surface water masses from west to east across the Atlantic: the 

North Atlantic Current extending to the north of the Iberian Peninsula, and the Azores Current 



Chapter 2 

56 

south of Iberia (Saunders, 1982; Pollard and Pu, 1985; Barton, 2001; Peliz et al., 2005). As the 

Azores Current flows eastwards, branches of this current smoothly loop northward into the 

Portugal Current and southward into the Canary Current (Saunders, 1982; Barton, 2001) (Figure 

2.1a).  

The upper 500 m of water column off Portugal, including the surface mixed layer and the 

first thermocline, are constituted by Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW) which is 

the main source of the nutrient-rich upwelled waters along the Portuguese coast. The ENACW 

has two main components of different origin, converging to this region: a lighter, relatively 

warm and salty subtropical branch (ENACWst) formed along the Azores Front, which gradually 

loses its characteristics as it travels further northwards along the Iberian margin; a less saline 

colder water mass of subpolar origin (ENACWsp), related to the Subpolar Mode Water formed 

in the eastern North Atlantic by winter cooling and deep convection (Fiúza et al., 1998), slowly 

flowing southwards below the poleward subtropical branch (Figure 2.1a).  

Beneath the near-surface equatorward flow of the Portugal and Canary currents, the 

Iberian Poleward Current (IPC) can be recognized travelling poleward, counter to the general 

circulation and closely bound to the continental slope, its core extending about 300–400 m 

vertically (Figure 1a). This current is mostly restricted to the subsurface layers along most of the 

eastern subtropical gyre, but it surfaces whenever the Trade Winds weaken or turn northward 

(Barton, 2001).  

Circulation over the Portuguese shelf and upper slope displays a marked seasonal 

variation associated with seasonal shifts in the position of the Azores high and Iceland low 

pressure systems (e.g. Haynes et al., 1993; Barton, 2001; Relvas et al., 2007). During summer, 

the Azores high migrates towards the central Atlantic, typically inducing Trade Winds to 

become northerly, inducing an equatorward circulation over the upper 150–200 m of the water 

column off Portugal. A surface layer of about 30 m thick of relatively warmer and lighter water 

is swept offshore by Ekman transport, allowing colder, less salty and nutrient enriched 

subsurface water to rise to the surface along the coast (e.g. Fiúza, 1983; Haynes et al., 1993; 

Barton, 2001; Relvas et al., 2007; Alvarez et al., 2011). During winter, when the Azores high is 

located further south and the Iceland low intensifies, the dominant wind regime becomes 

southerly along the western Portuguese margin. This induces the IPC to rise over the upper 

slope and shelf, where the poleward flow produces an onshore Ekman transport, in turn 

resulting in downwelling conditions over the shelf (Fiúza, 1983; Vitorino et al., 2002). 

Discharge of fresh water from rivers and streams, leading to the formation of coastal low 

salinity water lenses, is another important feature of the winter circulation over the western 

Portuguese margin. The Buoyant Plumes (BP’s) that are thus formed either develop into inshore 

currents (Relvas et al., 2007; Otero et al., 2008) or spread further offshore, depending on the 

wind forcing conditions over the shelf (Otero et al., 2008). Under typical winter conditions, the 

onshore Ekman transport driven by prevailing southerly winds induces the saline front to move 

toward the coast, thus forcing the BP to develop into a narrow coastal current with strong 

poleward velocities (e.g. Marta-Almeida et al., 2002; Oliveira et al., 2002; Relvas et al., 2007). 

When the southerly winds weaken or turn northerly, offshore spreading of the plume occurs,

even when wind variation is of short (1–3 h) duration (Otero et al., 2008) (Figure 1a). The 

Western Iberian Buoyant Plume is mostly fed by outflow from the northern Portuguese rivers 

(Mondego, Douro, Minho, Lima, Vouga), and is characterized by low salinities (&lt;35.8) and 

lower temperature than the ambient shelf waters (Peliz et al., 2005).  

The seasonally variable circulation on the Portuguese shelf and slope is also subject to 

interannual variation associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the latter resulting 

from fluctuations in the difference of atmospheric pressure between the Azores high and the 

Iceland low. Under NAO high index conditions, Trade Winds increase and bring moist air to 

Europe, leading to cool summers and mild and wet winters in central Europe and its Atlantic 

facade. On the contrary, NAO low index conditions are characterized by atmospheric 

temperature extremes with heat-waves and cold spells, and an increase of storm activity and 

rainfall in southern Europe and North Africa. Several studies indicate that in more recent years 

upwelling events off Portugal have decreased in intensity but increased in frequency, occurring 

even during the winter period (e.g. Barton, 2001; Vitorino et al., 2002; Santos et al., 2004; 

Ribeiro et al., 2005; Silva et al., 2008; Alvarez et al., 2009), apparently linked with the trend 

toward the “high index” polarity of the NAO observed over the last decades, (Barton, 2001; 

Wallace, 2002). 

 

 

2.3. Material and methods 

2.3.1. Sample collection 

Sampling was conducted between 9 and 19 of March 2010, on board of NRP “Almirante 

Gago Coutinho” during the 2
nd

 HERMIONE (Hotspot Ecosystem Research and Man’s Impact 

on European Seas) scientific cruise. Coccolithophore communities were investigated in 127 

water column samples collected and analyzed from 39 CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) 

casts from the Nazaré Canyon region (Figure 2.1b, Appendix D). Samples were collected at 

discrete water depth levels between 5 and 110 m depth to assess the distribution of 

coccolithophores along the shelf and oceanic water column in relation with hydrographic and 

biological characteristics.  

During the 1
st
 leg (9–12 March) CTD profiling and water sampling was conducted along 

a transect in the upper and middle part of Nazaré Canyon following the canyon axis, as well as 

along transects across the upper canyon and surrounding shelf. During the 2
nd

 leg (15–19 

March) profiling and sampling was conducted along a transect crossing the Nazaré Canyon near 

the upper-middle canyon transition (stations 174, 176 and 258), and two transects across the 

adjacent shelf and slope, one along the northern valley, a minor incision of the shelf break north 

of Nazaré Canyon (stations 146, 142 and 251), and the other west off Cape Carvoeiro, south of 

the canyon. 

Physical oceanographic, biological and chemical data (i.e. temperature, salinity, turbidity, 

fluorometry and nutrients) and water column samples were collected using a combined Neil 



Late winter coccolithophore bloom 

59 

Brown MKIIIC CTD profiler equipped with an Aquatracka nephelometer, a Seapoint 

fluorometer and a rosette sampler (12 Niskin bottles of 8 l). Around 192 samples of suspended 

matter were collected from surface, intermediate and bottom nepheloid layers in order to define 

the particulate matter concentration and to calibrate the nephelometer response (turbidity). 

Calibration of turbidity was carried out following the manufacturer's recommendations. The 

used nephelometer has a pulsed Xenon flash light source with high ultra violet content (440 

nm), and measures light scattered back from suspended particles using a solar-blind photodiode 

detector. It has a very high sensitivity to low values of turbidity, and to small particles (&lt;4 mm), 

with a precision of 4 % of the measured value. Measurements are not affected by Chl-a (680 

nm). The particulate matter concentration (PCM, g/m
3
) was compared to a laboratory calibration 

of the instrument with a standard formazine solution (FTU). The turbidity calibration for March 

2010 was FTU=0.112×PMC with r=0.88. CTD data are represented as contour plots constructed 

with the inverse distance to power gridding method of Surfer Version 8. 

 

 

2.3.2. Meteorological and hydrographic data 

Wind data were collected with an Aanderaa AWS 2700 coastal weather station located at 

Ferrel and maintained by the Portuguese Hydrographic Institute (IH) (position: 39º 23.3’N; 09º 

17.5’W, WGS84). Sea wave conditions were obtained from the MONICAN multiparametric 

buoy (IH) located offshore in the Nazaré Canyon axis (position: 39º 28’N; ?9º 40’W) 

(http://monican.hidrografico.pt/). Average daily river discharge data (m
3
/s) of the Douro River, 

measured at the hydrometric station at Crestuma (EDP) (position: 41º 04’N; 8º29’W) were 

obtained from the Sistema Nacional de Informação de Recursos Hídricos, SNIRH, from 

Instituto da Água (http://snirh.pt). Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) and monthly 

averaged chlorophyll-a data (Chl-a) for the area and time interval involved in this study were 

downloaded from the Ocean Colour Website (http://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov). These data 

were acquired by the Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s 

Aqua satellite and processed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Daily images 

covering the region of interest were averaged for PAR. Cloud coverage was also estimated from 

MODIS data, as the percentage of pixels in the image flagged with “probable cloud or ice 

contamination”. 

 

 

2.3.3. Laboratory and microscope analysis 

2.3.3.1. Phytoplankton pigments and nutrients 

Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations were used as an indicator for phytoplankton 

biomass. Water samples of 2 l were filtered over Whatman GF/F filters (0.7 ?m pore size, 25 

mm diameter), and the filters were immediately deep-frozen and stored at ?80 ºC. 

Phytoplankton pigments were extracted with 2–3 ml of 95 % cold buffered methanol (2 %

ammonium acetate) and analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 

Chromatographic separation was carried out following Zapata et al. (2000). Chl-a 

concentrations obtained from 38 HPLC samples were then used to calibrate fluorometry 

measurements obtained from CTD casts (r
2
=0.7 and r

2
=0.6, with p&amp;lt;0.01, for the 1

st
 and 2

nd
 leg, 

respectively). Further details on the HPLC method used can be found in Mendes et al. (2007). 

Water samples for nutrient analysis were filtered on board ship by vacuum with 

polycarbonate filters of 0.45 mm pore size and kept frozen below ?20 ºC until analysis. Nutrient 

concentrations (NOx: nitrate/nitrite, ammonium, PO4: phosphate, and SiO2: dissolved silica) 

were determined using a Skalar SAN plus Segmented Flow Auto Analyzer specially designed 

for the analysis of saline waters. N–NOx and N–NO2 were determined according to Strickland 

and Parsons (1972), with N–NO3 being estimated by the difference between the previous two; 

N–NH4 and Si–SiO2 were determined according to Koroleff (1976); P–PO4 was determined 

according to Murphy and Riley (1962). All methods were adapted to the methodology of 

segmented flow analysis and uncertainties were determined following Mendes et al. (2011). 

Limits of quantification and detection (=1/3 LQ) were, respectively, the following: 0.50 and 

0.17 for nitrate+nitrite, 0.1 and 0.033 for nitrite, 1.0 and 0.33 for ammonia, 0.2 and 0.067 for 

phosphate, and 0.3 and 0.1 for silica. 

 

 

2.3.3.2. Coccolithophores 

For the study of coccolithophores, seawater samples of around 2 l were filtered over 

cellulose acetate filters (0.45 ?m pore size, 47 mm diameter) using a low pressure vacuum 

system. The filters were then rinsed with tap water to remove salt and oven-dried at 40 ºC for 24 

h. A randomly chosen section (approx. 30º–45º) of each filter (radius of ~24 mm) was cut and 

permanently mounted on a glass slide. Coccospheres (cells) were identified and counted under 

polarized light microscope (PLM) (Olympus BX-40) at 1250× magnification. The examined 

area per filter varied between 3.0×10
5 

and 3.4×10
6
 mm

2
, depending on the general cell density. 

The number of cells per liter (cells/l) was estimated from the number of counted coccospheres 

in the examined area multiplied with the ratio of total filter area to examined area and divided 

by the volume of filtered water (Cros, 2001).  

Taxonomy of coccolithophores was performed according to Jordan et al. (2004). To 

refine the taxonomic differentiation of Syracosphaera spp., Gephyrocapsa spp., Algirosphaera 

robusta and Ophiaster spp., 18 samples were investigated using the Scanning Electron 

Microscope (SEM Hitachi S-3500N, at 5 kV). Samples were selected for containing relatively 

higher cell densities and species diversity. A randomly chosen section of the selected filters was 

fixed with colloidal Ag on a SEM stub and sputtered with an Au–Pd coating of maximum 20 

nm thick. A minimum of 100 vision fields (VF) were then examined and coccospheres counted 

using magnifications between 1000× (observation area of each VF: 1.2×10
4
 ?m

2
) and 2000× 

(observation area of each VF: 3.0×10
4
 µm).

2.3.4. Statistical analysis 

In order to investigate the relationship between coccolithophore taxa and environmental 

conditions during the cruise, a statistical multivariate analysis (r-mode Factor Analysis, by 

Statistica 10) was performed upon data matrices with coccolithophore cell densities, nutrient 

concentrations (NOx, PO4 and SiO2), Chl-a and physical parameters (temperature, salinity and 

turbidity) as columns (variables). In view of the very different conditions encountered during 

the 1
st
 and 2

nd
 leg (see Section 2.4.1) the two legs of the cruise were analyzed separately from 

two distinct data matrices. Only the more abundant coccolithophore species were considered 

(&gt;2000 cells/l). Results from the original data matrices were optimized through Varimax Raw 

rotation. 

 

 

2.4. Results 

2.4.1. Environmental conditions during the cruise 

Hydrographic profiling and plankton sampling took place at the end of what for 

southwest European standards was an unusually cold winter (2009–2010), associated with an 

exceptionally negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (Cattiaux et al., 2010; 

Troupin and Machin, 2012), as indicated by data from the NOAA-AVHRR data centre 

(http://www.knmi.nl/datacentrum/satellite_earth_observations/NOAA/2010). Whereas the 

winter mixed layer still comprised the upper 150–200 m of the water column over the shelf and 

upper slope, the period of sample collection was marked by transient meteorological and 

hydrographic conditions. During the 1
st
 leg of the cruise, the general circulation on the shelf was 

under the influence of intense river runoff, and intensified onshore oceanic convergence induced 

by the southerly wind regime prevailing prior to the cruise (Figure 2.2). Hydrometric stations 

along the Douro River measured a peak discharge two weeks prior to the cruise. 

A shift to northerly winds occurred on the 9
th

 of March 2010, coinciding with the start of 

the cruise. Initially alternating in northerly and southeasterly direction during most of the 1
st
 leg, 

the wind increased in strength (max. ~15 m/s) and became persistently northerly in the interval 

between the two legs, turning back to southerlies on the 15
th
 of March at the start of the 2

nd
 leg 

(Figure 2.2). Sea wave conditions were mostly moderate, dominated by significant wave heights 

(Hs) between 1.4 and 2.3 m, mainly coming from W to NW. Ocean colour satellite images 

indicate a cloud coverage &gt;50 % during most of the cruise except at the end of the 1
st
 leg and 

the two following days when skies were generally clear. The clear skies resulted in a relative 

increase of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) in this short period (Figure 2.2). 

During both legs of the cruise a well-established surface layer of less dense water was 

observed, with markedly lower temperature and salinity than that of the underlying winter 

mixed layer. The layer, interpreted as a buoyant plume (BP) resulting from the recent high river 

discharge, extended from near the coast to more than 50 km offshore (see water density profiles 

in Figure 2.3a,b). During the 1
st
 leg, while there was still important river discharge to the shelf,

Northerly winds dominated from 9 to 15 of March, later changing to southerlies from 16 to 19 of March 

of 2010. Grey shaded areas mark the periods of the two legs of the cruise. 

 

T and S values in the BP were conspicuously low (min. 14.2 ºC and 33.8, respectively), slightly 

increasing during the 2
nd

 leg (min. 14.4 ºC and 34.8, respectively), following three days of 

persistent northerly wind.  

Significant variability in thickness of the BP and in the steepness of the TS gradient at its 

base was noticed during both legs of the cruise. During the 1
st
 leg, closer to the coast, the BP 

was 40–50 m thick and gradually increasing in TS from the surface down to the winter mixed 

layer below, suggesting significant vertical mixing between the two water masses; further 

offshore, the BP decreased to 15–20 m thick with a relatively steep TS gradient at its base. 

During the 2
nd

 leg, the BP appeared to have increased in thickness relative to what was observed 

during the 1
st
 leg, with the TS gradient at its lower boundary extending in some cases to more 

than 100 m depth, closer to the shelf-break. The BP decreased in thickness and at the same time 

became more sharply defined in offshore direction, with the thinnest BP occurring at the more 

distal stations off Cape Carvoeiro.  

The warmer and saltier winter mixed layer underneath the BP was present in the entire 

investigated region, at depths generally between 15 and 20 m, and 200 m. Higher TS values 

close to the shelf-break, at the upper-middle Nazaré Canyon transition, and further offshore 

along the southern flank of the Nazaré Canyon, trace out the core of the IPC along the upper 

slope. Further north along the slope around 39.5 ºN, lower TS values indicate mixing of the IPC 

with colder water masses from north.

nd

 leg. Location of the transects is 

indicated on Figure 2.1b. CTD station positions are indicated by tick marks along the top of the graph. 

Number labels refer to CTD stations where coccolithophore samples were collected. 

 

 

The boundary with the colder and less saline superficial layer was particularly well-

defined during the 1
st
 leg, when the core of the IPC was centred less than 10 km off the coast. 

The TS gradient marking the boundary between the BP and the winter mixed water layer 

appeared less acute in CTD profiles measured during the 2
nd

 leg, suggesting mixing of the two 

water masses had taken place. 

Whereas turbidity was generally low during the cruise, some near-shore stations 

monitored during the 1
st
 leg showed higher turbidity at the surface. Enhanced turbidity was 

clearly associated with the BP, as the highest FTU values corresponded to the lowest salinity. 

High turbidity values recorded around 200–300 m water depth in the upper canyon, however, 

appear to reflect bottom sediment resuspension caused by the canyon's internal tide. 

 

 



Chapter 2 

64 

2.4.2. Nutrients 

During the 1
st
 leg, highest nutrient concentrations were recorded in the relatively cool and 

low-saline surface water of the BP, decreasing to lower concentrations in the winter mixed 

water layer below the surface (Figure 2.4). The decrease with depth was particularly noticeable 

in the case of SiO2. During the 2
nd

 leg, nutrient concentrations in the superficial water layer 

appeared to have significantly decreased, becoming lower than in the underlying water mass. In 

the deeper water layer nutrients had also decreased but much less than near the surface. The 

rapid depletion of nutrients from the superficial water layer, and slower decrease in nutrient 

concentrations below the surface is likely reflecting higher rates of nutrient consumptions by 

phytoplankton at the surface during this time of the cruise. This is particularly apparent for NOx, 

but to a lesser degree for PO4 and SiO2. Median+/- standard deviation of NOx/PO4 ratio in 

superficial water layer was 16.1+/- 2.1 and 3.8+/-3.8 during the 1
st
 and 2

nd
 leg, respectively, 

close to the 16:1 Redfield Ratio typical for marine waters (Redfield et al., 1963). Lower ratio's 

occurring in samples from the 2
nd

 leg suggests that NOx was becoming the limiting nutrient for 

phytoplankton growth at that time. 

 

 

2.4.3. Phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) and coccolithophore cell densities 

Phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) and coccolithophore cell densities (cells/l) drastically 

increased from the 1
st
 leg (max.&amp;lt;1 mg/l and 4.2×10

4
 cells/l) to the 2

nd
 leg (max. ~13 mg/l 

and15×10
4
 cells/l). Both were generally higher at the upper part of the water column, associated 

with the relatively cool and low saline superficial layer, and gradually decreasing with depth 

(Figure 2.5). The highest Chl-a concentrations and cell densities were found off Cape Carvoeiro 

and further NW, where the northern valley cuts the shelf-break north of the Nazaré Canyon. 

Whereas coccolithophore cell densities displayed only a weak positive correlation with 

phytoplankton biomass and no correlation with nutrients during the 1
st
 leg (Figure 2.6), a strong 

positive correlation with phytoplankton biomass and a negative correlation with NOx and PO4 

was observed during the 2
nd

 leg, reflecting the growth of coccolithophores at the expense of 

nutrients in the surface water layer (Figure 2.7). 

Additional pigment data (C. Sá personal communication, data not presented in this study) 

revealed that coccolithophores and diatoms, constituting the two dominant phytoplankton 

groups, contributed equally to total Chl-a concentration during the 1
st
 leg, with diatoms being 

generally more abundant at the surface and coccolithophores in deeper subsurface waters. 

During the 2
nd

 leg, diatoms were clearly the dominant phytoplankton group and the main 

contributor to Chl-a production, except further offshore where other groups recorded an increase 

of their relative abundances (station 251).

2.4.4. Coccolithophore species diversity and ecological preferences 

A total of 35 distinct taxa of coccolithophores (coccospheres) were recognized. 19 species 

and four genera were identified using PLM whereas an additional Scanning Electron 

Microscope analysis revealed 14 species belonging to the genera Syracosphaera, Ophiaster, 

Alisphaera and Acanthoica, and one species of holococcolithophore (for the complete list of 

taxa, see Appendix A). Of the 35 identified coccolithophore taxa, only 10 reached cell densities 

of more than 2000 cells/l which we considered as significant for subsequent analysis. Mean and 

maximum abundances of different taxa during the two legs, as determined from PLM 

observations, are indicated in Table 2.1. The 10 more significant taxa were (in order of 

maximum abundance): E. huxleyi, G. ericsonii, G. oceanica, G. muellerae, Syracosphaera spp. 

(dominated by S. marginoporata), C. mediterranea, Ophiaster spp. (dominated by O. 

hydroideus), Helicosphaera carteri, Syracolithus dalmaticus and A. robusta. Other plankton 

groups observed on filters collected during the 2
nd

 leg include diatoms (Chaetoceros sp., 

Rhizosolenia sp., Skeletonema costatum, Thalassionema sp., Thalassiosira sp.), silicoflagellates 

(Dictyocha fibula), siliceous Chromista as Meringosphaera sp. and Prymnesium neolepis; and 

dinoflagellates (Ceratium sp., Protoperidinium sp.), calcareous dinoflagellates (Thoracosphaera 

s.l.), radiolarians (Sticholonche zanclea), choanoflagellates, tintinnids and foraminifera. 

The strong increase in coccolithophore abundance observed during the 2
nd

 leg of the 

cruise was mostly due to a strong increase of E. huxleyi, and to a lesser extent of G. oceanica 

and C. mediterranea (Figure 2.8). All three species can be characterized as surface dwellers, 

being consistently more abundant at the surface and gradually decreasing with depth.  

G. ericsonii and S. dalmaticus had also increased during the 2
nd

 leg, although less 

strongly in comparison to the previous three species. G. ericsonii revealed a broad vertical 

distribution during both legs, whereas S. dalmaticus was preferably more abundant at the 

uppermost 5–25 m (Figure 2.8). 

G. muellerae, Ophiaster spp. and Syracosphaera spp. kept similar cell densities during 

both periods, although slightly decreasing their maxima during the 2
nd

 leg. Whereas all three 

revealed a broad vertical distribution, the latter two can be characterized as distinct subsurface 

dwellers.  

H. carteri and A. robusta were generally low abundant during the cruise without a 

specific water depth preference, although maxima of both were observed in the surface water 

layer. 

During both legs, coccolithophore assemblages from the bottom nepheloid layer (BNL) 

generally appeared to reflect those from the surface water layer, dominated by the more 

productive surface-dwelling species (E. huxleyi, G. ericsonii, G. oceanica and C. mediterranea) 

and, to a lesser extend from the subsurface dwelling taxa Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster 

spp. The maximum abundance of H. carteri during the cruise was observed in the BNL of 

station 93, collected during the 1
st
 leg.

During the 1
st
 leg, higher turbidity at the surface appeared to be caused by suspended 

sediment load supplied by runoff, whereas during the 2
nd

 leg, turbidity showed a good 

correlation with Chl-a, suggesting it was then related to enhanced phytoplankton productivity 

(see Figure A in Auxiliary Material).  

Coccolithophore assemblages showed considerable variation in abundance and taxonomic 

composition, not only in time (1
st
 and 2

nd
 leg) and water depth (surface and subsurface layer), 

but also laterally (near-shore and offshore). As illustrated by Figure 2.9, the large increase in 

coccolithophore abundance from the 1
st
 to the 2

nd
 leg (from less than 4.3×10

4
 cells/l to more 

than 14×10
4
 cells/l, respectively) was mostly accounted for by surface-dwelling taxa like E. 

huxleyi, particularly in stations on the shelf and upper slope where the BP was well developed. 

The boundary between the BP and the underlying winter mixed layer was marked by a distinct 

step in T and S, clearly visible in all the CTD profiles, except those from the most offshore 

stations, where the plume is absent and the winter mixed layer occupies the entire water column 

up to the surface (stations 132 and 251).

Late winter coccolithophore bloom 

69 

Highest cell densities of E. huxleyi occurred west of Cape Carvoeiro, where it appeared 

closely associated with the highest Chl-a concentrations and maxima of small-chain diatom 

species considered to be 1
st
 stage taxa in phytoplankton succession (Margalef, 1978) (e.g. 

Thalassiosira spp., Chaetoceros spp., Skeletonema spp.). The significant increase of G. 

oceanica and C. mediterranea during the 2
nd

 leg appeared also closely related with the 

superficial BP. Maxima of G. oceanica occurred close to the coast west off Cape Carvoeiro 

(station 238), whereas the maximum of C. mediterranea was reached further offshore at the 

northern valley (station 146). In the latter area, modest increases in some other species such as 

Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp., were observed, as well as a broader vertical distribution 

of coccolithophores and stronger correlation between coccolithophore cells and phytoplankton 

biomass (Chl-a). This makes the northern valley appear different from the area off Cape 

Carvoeiro.  

A similar increase in abundance was not noticed in the most oceanward stations where 

the BP was absent and the winter mixed layer occupied the entire water column up to the 

surface (stations 132 and 251, respectively Figure 2.9c,f). In those stations, E. huxleyi was 

subordinate to less prolific surface dwellers like G. ericsonii and subsurface dwellers like 

Ophiaster spp. and Syracosphaera spp. even during the 2
nd

 leg. The latter genera were observed 

displaying a broad vertical distribution along the entire 100 m at these distal locations. 

 

 

2.4.5. Multivariate analysis 

In order to explore and statistically demonstrate the rapid response of coccolithophore 

taxa (and phytoplankton s.l.) to the short-term environmental variations that occurred during the 

cruise, factor analysis was performed using the cell densities of the dominant coccolithophore 

taxa and the physical–biological proxies as variables in one single data matrix. In view of the 

very different environmental conditions and ecological responses encountered during the two 

legs of the cruise, factor analysis was performed on data from each of the two legs of the cruise 

separately. Only the samples for which nutrient data were available were considered as cases in 

the factor analysis. Since the lateral coast-to-ocean and vertical water column gradients appear 

as the most significant ecological gradients, factor scores were plotted against distance to coast 

and water depth (Figures 2.10–2.12).  

Four factors explained 55 % and 73 % of the total variance in the data from, respectively, 

the 1
st
 and 2

nd
 leg, of which Factor 1 (F1) and Factor 2 (F2) were considered the most 

statistically relevant for subsequent environmental analysis (Table 2.2).  

For the 1
st
 leg, F1 (28 %) is mostly represented by nutrients (positive loadings) in 

opposition to salinity, temperature and Syracosphaera spp. (negative loadings), whereas F2 (13 

%) is represented by Chl-a, Ophiaster spp. and Gephyrocapsa ericsonii (positive loadings). 

Samples influenced by the factor assemblage NOx, PO4 and SiO2 (F1 positive scores) are 

better represented at the surface water level close to the coast (Figure 2.10a). The lack of 

nutrient data at the surface of the more distal stations (i.e. 122 and 131) limits our perception

about its latitudinal distribution at surface level. Below the surface this assemblage is practically 

inexistent or weakly represented. Samples influenced by the factor assemblage salinity, 

temperature and Syracosphaera spp. (F1 negative scores) are mostly found at deeper levels 

below the surface and further offshore along the entire uppermost 100 m. Samples influenced by 

the factor assemblage Chl-a, Ophiaster spp. and G. ericsonii (F2 positive scores) are 

preferentially distributed further offshore, revealing a rather broad vertical distribution (Figure 

2.10b).  

For the 2
nd

 leg, F1 (38 %) is represented by temperature and salinity (positive loadings) in 

opposition to E. huxleyi, turbidity, Chl-a, G. oceanica, C. mediterranea, S. dalmaticus and H. 

carteri (negative loadings), whereas F2 (16%) is represented by G. muellerae, Syracosphaera 

spp. and G. ericsonii (positive loadings) in opposition to temperature (negative loadings). 

Samples influenced by the factor assemblage E. huxleyi, turbidity, Chl-a, G. oceanica, C. 

mediterranea, S. dalmaticus and H. carteri (F1 negative scores) are better represented at the 

surface water level in more neritic-coastal regions, i.e. off Cape Carvoeiro (Figure 2.11a) and at 

the northern valley (Figure 2.12a). Underneath the surface and further offshore along the entire 

water column, this assemblage appears nearly absent. Samples influenced by temperature and

salinity (F1 positive scores) are mostly related to a further offshore location (station 251), 

broadly distributed along the uppermost 50 m depth (Figure 2.12a).  

Samples influenced by the factor assemblage G. muellerae, Syracosphaera spp. and G. 

ericsonii (F2 positive scores) are mostly distributed further offshore, with the strongest signal 

recorded at the NW limit of the study area broadly distributed along the uppermost 50 m 

(station 251) and more weakly represented at the surface water layer of station 146, at the 

northern valley (station 146). Temperature (F2 negative scores) is weakly opposed to the former 

assemblage and generally better represented west of Cape Carvoeiro (Figure 2.11b). 

Results from factor analysis were generally statistically significant, particularly during the 

2
nd

 leg, when a clear response of phytoplankton in general, and coccolithophores in particular, to 

nutrient availability at the surface, was observed. The contrast between the two legs and the 

quick change of hydrographic conditions and related phytoplankton response is well represented 

by the lower versus higher statistical significance obtained for the 1
st
 and 2

nd
 legs, respectively. 

Lower percentage of explained variance obtained for the 1
st
 leg reflects the more steady-state 

and low-productive ecological conditions during this period, when phytoplankton was not yet 

significantly developing, neither taking advantage from the nutrient-rich BP. Most of the 

physical and biological variables, including the most abundant coccolithophore taxa, revealed a 

distribution quite near the normal. Only the less abundant species are the most deviant from 

normal because their frequent zero abundance appears overvalued within the overall distribution 

(i.e. H. carteri, S. dalmaticus and A. robusta).

2.5. Discussion 

2.5.1. Buoyant plume dynamics during a late winter upwelling event 

The reported hydrographic profiling and plankton sampling coincided with a period of 

transient oceanographic and meteorological conditions, characteristic for the late winter period. 

Relatively warm and saline oceanic waters fed by the IPC were present in the winter mixed 

layer which occupied the upper 100–200 m of the water column over the shelf and upper slope, 

as typical during winter (e.g. Oliveira et al., 2004). A superficial layer of relatively cool and low 

saline water capping the warmer and more saline winter mixed layer water was noticed during 

both legs of the cruise. This buoyant plume was presumably fed by runoff from intense rainfall 

that occurred prior to and at the beginning of the cruise. Fresh water was possibly originating 

from rivers north of the study area (e.g. Lis, Mondego, Douro rivers) as well as from small 

rivers flowing directly into the Nazaré Canyon head (e.g. Alcôa, Tornada and Arnoia rivers) 

(see Figure 2.1). Lowest salinities in the superficial layer, and strongest vertical gradients were 

recorded during the 1
st
 leg, along the upper Nazaré Canyon.  

Equatorward and offshore extension of the BP most probably occurred as a consequence 

of Ekman superficial dynamics driven by the prevailing northerly winds. As lighter waters were 

continuously being advected above the denser winter mixed layer, vertical stratification of the 

Ekman layer increased and the seaward side of the BP was stretched. Nearer to the coast, the 

greater thickness of the BP suggests that it was subject to mixing at its base with the underlying 

denser waters which were brought up from deeper levels by the Ekman circulation. Whilst 

mixing was levelling off the vertical density gradient at the base of the plume along its coastal 

side, the BP continued to move in offshore direction until it eventually got separated from the 

coast (see Fong and Geyer, 2001; Santos et al., 2004).  

Similar cases where local winds control the dynamics of river plumes and coastal 

upwelling have been described by several authors. Fong and Geyer (2001) argue that a 

moderate-amplitude upwelling wind lasting a few days induces significant mixing in the plume, 

advecting and spreading it far off the coast, whereas under sustained upwelling winds the plume 

is gradually spread out to nearly uniform thickness. Such has already been described from off 

the Portuguese coast during occasional winter upwelling events, when Ekman surface 

circulation was observed to advect the plume to more than 100 km offshore in a few days (Otero 

et al., 2008). Convergence of the BP with the IPC was reported to occur at the shelf break, 

leading to local thickening of the plume, favouring the retention of biological material in this 

area (Peliz and Fiúza, 1999; Santos et al., 2004; Ribeiro et al., 2005).  

Such a scenario appears to apply also to our cruise: whereas river runoff decreased, the 

northerly wind-driven Ekman circulation persisted, causing the BP to spread further offshore 

and become detached from the coast. Nevertheless, contrary to summer upwelling episodes, 

during which northerly winds are more intense and persistent over the Portuguese coast (e.g. 

Peliz et al., 2002; Alvarez-Salgado et al., 2003), the observed northerly wind event was 

probably not persistent enough to bring nutrients from below the deep (~150 m) seasonal 



Late winter coccolithophore bloom 

75 
 

pycnocline (e.g. Ribeiro et al., 2005). Moreover, vertical profiles along the uppermost 1000 m 

of stations from the 1
st
 leg (data not shown) revealed that nutrient concentrations significantly 

decreased from the surface down to 250 m depth and thus, no significant input would be 

expected from the levels immediately below the pycnocline. Therefore, the observed upwelling 

event should be viewed in terms of its capacity to spread a thin nutrient-rich BP from the coast 

towards offshore, rather than as a mechanism of nutrient replenishment from subsurface waters. 

That highest nutrient concentrations were measured within the BP indicates that nutrients were 

being sourced mainly by runoff discharged by rivers prior to and at the beginning of the cruise.  

In comparison to some other areas of the world’s oceans, nutrient concentrations during 

the cruise can be considered as generally low (Levitus et al., 1993), but enough to support the 

phytoplankton communities thriving in this area (see Section 2.4.2). N:P ratios falling below the 

typical 16:1 Redfield ratio in surface waters during the 2
nd

 leg point at nitrogen as the main 

limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth, in good agreement with several studies within 

coastal waters (Redfield, 1958; Redfield et al., 1963; Ryther and Dunstan, 1971; Fisher et al., 

1992; Labry et al., 2002; Mendes et al., 2011). 

 

 

2.5.2. Productivity variations on a weekly basis 

Results presented in this study strikingly illustrate the rapid response of phytoplankton to 

favourable environmental conditions. A brief period of northerly winds was enough to promote 

spreading of the nutrient-rich BP, favouring a massive increase in phytoplankton biomass and 

coccolithophore cell densities from the 1
st
 to the 2

nd
 leg of the cruise. 

Vertical stratification associated with the BP appears to have acted as a mechanism 

retaining both nutrients and cells within the sunlit surface layer, leading to a remarkable 

phytoplankton bloom in the otherwise relatively nutrient-poor oceanic conditions that prevail 

during winter on the central Portuguese margin (see Santos et al., 2004; Ribeiro et al., 2005). 

Cells and nutrients were clearly associated with the salinity minima of the BP and were 

probably advected along with it. This would explain why the highest concentrations of Chl-a 

and coccolithophore cells occurred preferentially at the surface of the more distal part of the 

transect west off Cape Carvoeiro, where the BP was thinner and more sharply defined at the 

surface. A map of Chl-a average concentration for March 2010 obtained from satellite data (see 

Figure B in Auxiliary Material) illustrates the broad spreading of this Chl-a enrichment, 

extending from the coast to the middle shelf region, and apparently originating from the north.  

Although nutrients were already available at the time of the 1
st
 leg of the cruise, and 

probably were still being replenished by runoff from land, a clear response in phytoplankton 

productivity was only observed during the 2
nd

 leg. Such delay may be explained partly by the 

higher advective mixing between the BP and shelf's ambient waters and significant cloud 

coverage during the 1
st
 leg (see Figure 2.2). When river runoff had decreased at the end of the 

1
st
 leg, the intensity of mixing between the BP and the denser water layer below probably 

weakened, leading to stabilization of the vertical stratification (see Ribeiro et al., 2005). The 



Chapter 2 

76 

retention of cells within the BP promoted exposure of phytoplankton to sunlight and allowed 

cell division to remain constant as long as the cells remained inside the BP (e.g. Smetacek and 

Passow, 1990; Ribeiro et al., 2005). With nutrient availability ensured within the BP, light 

seems logically the ultimate factor needed to set off the phytoplankton bloom. Clear skies and 

slight increase of PAR (see Figure 2.2) occurring in the interval between the two legs of the 

cruise may have provided the required favourable light conditions. 

Another factor that possibly contributed to the establishment of favourable conditions for 

phytoplankton to bloom within the surface layer was the relatively low suspended sediment load 

in the BP, therefore not significantly reducing light availability. River floods occurring in 

autumn and early winter, when river basins are still loaded with accumulated fine sediments, 

tend to discharge much more turbid waters onto the shelf, thereby inhibiting phytoplankton 

growth. Waters discharged as a result of the late winter flood prior to our cruise were probably 

relatively clear. The moderate sea wave conditions also contributed to the generally low 

turbidity values during the cruise, and to the persistence of the water stratification, long enough 

to allow the development of a phytoplankton bloom at the surface. Even so, settling of 

suspended sediment from the BP as it spread out in offshore direction may have played a role in 

improving light conditions near the surface as well as in deeper water. Change from a 

suspension-related turbidity during the 1
st
 leg, to phytoplankton-related turbidity during the 2

nd
 

leg supports this hypothesis (see Figure A in Auxiliary Material). 

Wind-driven turbulence, water stratification and mixed-layer depth were already 

demonstrated to be important factors controlling phytoplankton access to its basic requirements 

for growth: light and nutrients (Doyon et al., 2000; Kudela et al., 2005). The importance of river 

runoff in providing nutrients to phytoplankton communities, and stratification of the upper 

water column as a key-factor in the occurrence of phytoplankton blooms during winter and 

spring on the Portuguese continental shelf, have also been confirmed by several authors (Peliz 

and Fiúza, 1999; Moita, 2001; Varela et al., 2001; Ribeiro et al., 2005; De Castro et al., 2006). 

Moita (2001) found that Chl-a peaks during winter were associated with runoff-driven 

haline-stratification, particularly north of Cape Carvoeiro, and that phytoplankton growth during 

spring occurred at the expense of nutrients replenished during winter when thermal stratification 

was still weakly developed. During this transient period the relatively well-mixed water column 

showed a certain degree of stability at the uppermost water levels, where blooms occurred very 

close to the surface following calm and relatively warm days and in the presence of some 

haline-stratification. Peliz and Fiúza (1999), analysing Coastal Zone Colour Scanner images 

obtained between 1979 and 1985, concluded that the highest Chl-a concentrations occurred in 

winter over the shelf and slope, extending to large distances off the coast. They appeared 

associated with the offshore spreading of river plumes, eventually occupying the whole shelf 

and slope zone in about one week (e.g. Peliz and Fiúza, 1999; Santos et al., 2004). The role of 

Cape Carvoeiro in rapidly redirecting the nutrient-rich BP further offshore, following similar 

dynamics as associated with the generation of chlorophyll-rich upwelling filaments extending to 

the ocean during summer, should not be discarded (e.g. Fiúza, 1983; Haynes et al., 1993; Peliz 

et al., 2002). 



Late winter coccolithophore bloom 

77 
 

The late winter bloom here described occurred at the expense of nutrients within the BP, 

as indicated by the significant decrease of NOx, PO4 and SiO2 at the surface. A lesser decrease 

in nutrient concentrations at deeper levels is indicative of lower consumption rates below the 

surface (Figure 2.4). Chl-a concentrations reported in this study revealed to be much higher than 

so far reported from the Portuguese margin, with a maximum Chl-a of 13 mg/l off Cape 

Carvoeiro, compared to 4.3 mg/l in the Nazaré canyon region in June of 2006 (Mendes et al., 

2011), max. 4.6 mg/l off Cape S. Vicente and along the coastal region north of Cape Carvoeiro, 

during summer, and max. 6.3 mg/l off Faro, during spring (Moita, 2001), max. ~3.5 mg/l in the 

NW region of the Portuguese shelf, February of 2000 (Ribeiro et al., 2005), and max. 5.3 mg/l 

in Lisbon Bay, February 2005 (Silva et al., 2009). The winter–spring transition may thus lead to 

a stronger ecological response than occurring during the summer-upwelling season, when wind 

and sunlight conditions are usually more persistently favourable. 

Pigment data from this period indicate that diatoms were the dominant phytoplankton 

group and the main contributor for Chl-a production, particularly at the uppermost water layer 

(data not shown). The conspicuous depletion of SiO2 at the surface, observed especially off 

Cape Carvoeiro therefore likely reflects the bloom of small-chain diatoms (see Margalef, 1978). 

Rapid exhaustion of silica by diatoms apparently led coccolithophores to profit from NOx and 

PO4 still available at the surface, contributing to their unexpectedly rapid and significant bloom 

near the coast. 

 

 

2.5.3. Coccolithophore ecological preferences 

Often considered as a uniform functional group of calcifying phytoplankton thriving in 

low-turbulence, low-nutrients and high-light environments, results presented in this study 

clearly show that coccolithophore life strategies are much more diverse than expected. The most 

striking ecological variations occurred along the coastal-oceanic lateral gradient and vertically 

along the upper photic layer. It is clear that some taxa were favoured by the offshore spread of 

the BP, taking profit from nutrient and light availability at the surface, whereas others preferably 

developed below the surface and further offshore, away from the influence of river runoff (see 

Figures 2.9–2.12). Results from factor analysis clearly confirmed such short-term ecological 

changes. 

Factor analysis for the 1
st
 leg clearly illustrates the strongest contrast between the coastal-

neritic region affected by nutrient rich runoff waters in the BP and the oceanic mixed water 

mass further offshore observed in this period. Only few coccolithophore species displayed some 

direct relation with such lateral gradient: subsurface dweller Syracosphaera spp. preferably 

associated to more oceanic and oligotrophic water conditions below the surface and along the 

entire uppermost 100 m further offshore (F1, Figure 2.10a), whereas Ophiaster spp., G. 

ericsonii and, to a lesser extent, C. mediterranea, were more associated to (low) phytoplankton 

productivity (Biom Chl-a) occurring at the surface closer to the coast (F2, Figure 2.10b). 



Chapter 2 

78 

The observed coccolithophore bloom at the expense of nutrients within the BP is clearly 

showed by factor analysis performed for the 2
nd

 leg. E. huxleyi, G. oceanica and C. 

mediterranea were the more productive and contributor species for the remarkable increase of 

Chl-a observed in this period (F1, Figures 2.11 and 2.12a), whereas G. muellerae, 

Syracosphaera spp., G. ericsonii and Ophiaster spp. were more independent from the nutrient-

rich BP and preferentially developing offshore, outside the influence of runoff (F2, Figure 

2.12b). 

The observed dominance of E. huxleyi during both low- and high productivity periods 

during the cruise is in good agreement with its presumed cosmopolitan and opportunistic 

behaviour (Winter et al., 1994; Baumann et al., 2000; Andruleit, 2007; Boeckel and Baumann, 

2008). The remarkable occurrence of E. huxleyi together with small-chain diatoms and 

significantly contributing to phytoplankton biomass during the high productive period, supports 

earlier observations identifying it as an early succession r-selected species, capable of rapid 

growth within nutrient-rich, turbulent environments (e.g. Giraudeau and Bayley, 1995; 

Andruleit and Rogalla, 2002; Sprengel et al., 2002; Andruleit, 2007; Silva et al., 2008) and 

constituting the main bloom-forming coccolithophore (e.g. Okada and Honjo, 1973; 

Knappertsbusch and Brummer, 1995; Garcia et al., 2011; Souza et al. 2011). 

G. oceanica was apparently “dormant” during the low-productive period (1
st
 leg) but 

rapidly developed as soon as nutrient-light stratification conditions became favourable during 

the 2
nd

 leg. It manifests itself as one of the species better adapted to thrive within nutrient-rich, 

competitive conditions near the coast, although not reaching cell densities as high as those of E. 

huxleyi. Results agree with several authors referring to it as a typical coastal coccolithophore, 

well adapted to the nutrient-rich and productive environment off Portugal (Silva et al., 2008), 

and as maximum upwelling indicator, based on its quick response to nutrient input (Winter et 

al., 1994; Giraudeau and Bayley, 1995; Broerse et al., 2000; Andruleit and Rogalla, 2002; 

Sprengel et al., 2002; Andruleit et al., 2003). 

C. mediterranea was also able to profit from nutrient favourable conditions during the 

cruise and flourished in the 2
nd

 leg, although less prominently than the two latter, and more 

displaced towards the shelf-break region, at the northern valley. Silva et al. (2008) and Moita et 

al. (2010) also reported the presence of high cell densities of C. mediterranea off the Nazaré 

region during winter, referring to it as a good tracer for the convergence of subtropical waters 

(ENACWst) onto the Portuguese shelf during the upwelling-downwelling transition. 

Despite the generally low abundance of S. dalmaticus, correlation of this species with E. 

huxleyi, G. oceanica and C. mediterranea, closer to the coast off Cape Carvoeiro, suggest that it 

has some capacity to profit from nutrient availability, in the context of moderate-to-low 

turbulence within coastal regions. This contradicts previous studies which associate 

holococcolithophores with more oligotrophic and oceanic environments (i.e. Mediterranean Sea, 

NE Atlantic, Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, Kleijne, 1991). 

Observations on Syracosphaera spp. are consistent with Andruleit (2007) in terms of its 

broad depth range but contradict several studies reporting this genus as having affinity for 

nutrient availability in coastal regions (e.g. Andruleit and Rogalla, 2002; Andruleit, 2007). In

addition, little is known about S. marginoporata, the dominant species within this group (max. 

1.4×10
4
 cells/l counted with SEM). The same applies to Ophiaster spp. which, similarly to 

Syracosphaera spp., includes a variety of species which cannot be distinguished with PLM but 

which are expected to have distinct ecological preferences (Young, 1994). Lack of taxonomical 

differentiation and of a systematic quantification of typical nutrient levels in the above-

mentioned studies may partially explain discrepancies with the present study. 

G. ericsonii was the second most abundant species during the cruise, next to E. huxleyi, 

confirming its preference for nutrient enriched coastal/neritic regions inferred by several authors 

(e.g. California Current System, Winter et al., 1979; south of Benguela upwelling system, 

Giraudeau and Bayley, 1995; Lisbon Bay, Silva et al., 2008). Yet, its highest cell densities 

further offshore during the high productivity period, away from the influence of the BP and 

coastal turbulence, suggest that it is better adapted to compete with E. huxleyi in oceanic 

conditions than in coastal waters. Although with much lower abundances, G. muellerae 

displayed an ecological performance similar to G. ericsonii: higher abundances and coastal-

neritic distribution during the 1
st
 leg and better performance in more oceanic regions during the 

high-productive period, suggesting it has a more oligotrophic behaviour on the central 

Portuguese margin, in comparison to other placolith-bearing species (i.e. G. oceanica and E. 

huxleyi). The two species are apparently able to thrive and dominate the coccolithophore 

community under steady-state low-productive conditions over the shelf, but not when shelf and 

coastal waters become favourable for r-selected species like E. huxleyi and G. oceanica. 

The observed higher diversity of coccolithophore species, broader vertical distribution 

and stronger correlation between cells and phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) at the shelf-break 

region (northern valley), possibly reflect the dominance of this group within more distal regions. 

 

 

2.6. Conclusions 

Coccolithophores off central Portugal showed a rapid response to regional meteorological 

and hydrographic variations occurring in late winter between 9 and 19 March 2010, either 

taking profit of nutrient availability in coastal-neritic areas and competing with other r-selected 

phytoplankton groups (e.g. small-chain diatoms), or preferentially developing in more oceanic-

oligotrophic regions, where competition with r-selected taxa is expectedly lower. 

Over the relatively warm and saline winter mixed layer water occupying the upper 100–

200 m of the water column over the shelf and upper slope, a superficial nutrient-rich Buoyant 

Plume (BP) of relatively cool and low-saline water, presumably fed by runoff from intense 

rainfall that occurred prior to and at the beginning of the cruise, was spread out equatorwards 

and offshore, most probably as a consequence of Ekman superficial dynamics generated by the 

prevailing northerly winds. Whereas river runoff decreased, the Ekman circulation driven by the 

northerly wind made the BP to spread further offshore and become detached from the coast. 

Despite relatively high nutrient availability within the BP, cloud cover and initial relatively high 



Chapter 2 

80 

turbidity within the BP resulted in sub-optimal light conditions unfavourable for the growth of 

phytoplankton (Figure 2.13a). 

In the transition towards the 2
nd

 leg, stable density stratification, decreasing turbidity at 

the surface and prevailing clear skies finally allowed phytoplankton to take advantage of the 

nutrients retained in the BP. In the shelf and upper slope area covered by the BP, E. huxleyi and 

G. oceanica were the coccolithophore species that benefited the most from favourable nutrient 

conditions within the sunlit layer. C. mediterranea and S. dalmaticus also responded to the 

favourable conditions, although less notably than the first two species (Figure 2.13b). 

 

 

Figure 2.13 – Schematic representation of the environmental conditions that contributed to the late winter 

coccolithophore bloom observed during the cruise: (a) 1
st
 leg, low-productive pre-bloom period: the wind 

regime was shifting from southerlies to northerlies, and the vertical gradient between the BP and the 

winter mixed layer was strongest due to still significant river discharge; (b) period between legs: clear sky 

conditions were most favorable, runoff driven turbidity at the surface had decreased, and northerly wind 

forced Ekman circulation of the BP was strongest, all factors contributing to trigger the phytoplankton 

and coccolithophore bloom in the BP; (c) 2
nd

 leg, high-productive bloom period: significant Chl-a and 

cell concentrations were recording a bloom at the surface, at the expense of nutrient provided by the 

plume, with E. huxleyi, G. oceanica and C. mediterranea revealing a remarkable increase of abundance 

between the coast and the shelf-break. During this time, the BP was relatively more mixed with the 

underneath winter layer, the wind regime changed back to southerlies and an increase of cloud coverage 

was noticed (C. mediterranea – Cm; E. huxleyi – Eh; G. ericsonii – Ge; G. muellerae – Gm; G. oceanica 

– Go; Ophiaster spp. - Ophi; Syraco. dalmaticus – Sdalm; S. marginoporata – SM; Buoyant Plume – 

BP).  

 

 



Late winter coccolithophore bloom 

81 
 

Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. were the most consistently oligotrophic taxa, 

constituting an important component in offshore assemblages and displaying a broad vertical 

distribution extending well below the nutrient-rich surface layer in the more coastal-neritic 

regions. G. ericsonii and G. muellerae decreased in abundance in shelf and upper slope waters, 

but increased in the most offshore waters where E. huxleyi was not significantly developing 

(Figure 2.13a). 

The observed rapid response of coccolithophores to short-term meteorological and 

hydrographic variability presents a challenge to the application of coccoliths in paleoclimatic 

and paleoceanographic reconstructions, and demonstrates the need for improved knowledge of 

the ecological characteristics of this group.

Abstract 

This paper presents a first attempt to characterize coccolithophore assemblages occurring 

in the context of an active submarine canyon. Coccolithophores from the upper-middle sections 

of the Nazaré Canyon (central Portuguese margin) - one of the largest canyons of the European 

continental margin - were investigated during a late winter period (9 – 12 March 2010). Species 

distributions were analyzed in a multiparameter environmental context (temperature, salinity, 

turbidity, Chl-a and nutrient concentrations). Monthly averaged surface water Chl-a 

concentration between 2006 and 2011 assessed from satellite data is also presented, as a 

framework for interpreting spatial and temporal distribution of phytoplankton in the Nazaré 

Canyon. 

The Nazaré Canyon was observed to act as a conduit for advection of relatively nutrient-

poor oceanic waters of ENACWst origin into nearshore areas of the continental shelf (less than 

10 km off the coast), whilst at the surface a nutrient-rich buoyant plume resulting from intensive 

coastal runoff prior and during the beginning of the cruise was spreading in oceanward 

direction.  

Two distinct coccolithophore assemblages appear representative for the coast to open 

ocean gradient: (1) Emiliania huxleyi together with Gephyrocapsa ericsonii and Coronosphaera 

mediterranea dominated the more productive assemblage present within coastal-neritic surface 

waters; and (2) Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. displayed a higher affinity with open-

ocean conditions, and also generally a broader vertical distribution. Local “hotspots” of 

coccolithophore and phytoplankton biomass potentially associated with perturbations of surface 

water circulation by the canyon are discussed.

3.1. Introduction 

Submarine canyons incising the continental margins are prominent topographic features 

that modify the coastal circulation. By intensifying shelf-slope exchange of water and 

organic/inorganic matter they play a key-role in global biogeochemical cycling (e.g. Durrieu de 

Madron, 1994; Gardner, 1989; Hickey et al., 1986; Monaco et al., 1999; Puig et al., 2003). 

Narrow canyons tend to have a stronger effect on low-frequency circulation, whereas wider 

canyons mainly cause bottom flow adjustment along isobaths (Klinck, 1988). Stratification of 

the water column reduces the canyon’s topographic effect on the coastal flow (Hickey, 1997; 

She and Klinck, 2000).  

In the upper water layers (above 100 m), the influence of the canyon is only gentle, with 

the along-shelf flow turning slightly onshore upstream of the canyon and turning offshore 

downstream. Closer to the canyon rims (100-200 m) the along-shelf flow is more strongly 

deflected in onshore direction, turning back on the downstream side of the canyon, with 

upwelling or downwelling occurring above the rims, depending on the wind direction (She and 

Klinck, 2000). In the Northern Hemisphere right-bounded flows (i.e. coast to the right, looking 

downstream) induce downwelling conditions within the canyon, whereas left-bounded flows 

favor the occurrence of upwelling (Klinck, 1996; She and Klinck, 2000). Upwelling occurs 

mostly at the canyon head and downstream rim and adjacent shelf (Allen, 1996; Klinck, 1996; 

Mendes et al., 2011; She and Klinck, 2000). Under downwelling conditions, the canyon acts as 

a trap for converging shelf water (Skliris and Djenidi, 2006). 

The intensification of both coast to ocean and vertical water transport within submarine 

canyons is expected to affect the dynamics of plankton ecosystems in the vicinity of canyons 

(see Bosley et al., 2004; Hickey, 1995; Kampf, 2006; Ryan et al., 2005; 2010; Skliris et al., 

2002; Skliris and Djenidi, 2006). Indeed a strong response of phytoplankton production to 

canyon flows, and concentration of marine organisms by physical processes within and around 

canyons were reported from several studies (e.g. Bosley et al. 2004; Macquart-Moulin and 

Patriti, 1996; Skliris and Djenidi, 2006).  

The Nazaré Canyon, located at the central Portuguese margin and one of the largest 

submarine canyons of Europe, has been relatively intensely explored with regards to its 

geology, geomorphology, oceanography and benthic biology (e.g. Tyler et al., 2009). Little is 

known, however, about the plankton communities thriving in this region, and about the 

canyon’s effect on their ecology.  

Guerreiro et al. (submitted-b) (Chapter 4) observed a relatively higher diversity of 

coccolith species, including both oceanic and coastal-neritic taxa but with a relative dominance 

of the latter, in the Nazaré Canyon in comparison to the adjacent shelf/slope regions. This was 

interpreted as reflecting the exchange of water masses between coastal and oceanic regions 

through the canyon, as well as the dynamic and nutrient-rich conditions where the coastal 

species are better adapted to survive. Locally enhanced productivity in the surroundings of the 

canyon may be related to persistent physical phenomena associated with the canyon such as 

vertical mixing by solitary internal waves (Quaresma et al. 2007), and/or upwelling in the

87 

canyon head (Guerreiro et al., 2009). Evidence for local enhancement of phytoplankton 

productivity is also provided by observations on phytoplankton pigments reported by Mendes et 

al. (2011), with maximum values of Chl-a (indicative of phytoplankton in general) near the 

canyon head and maximum values of 19’ hexanoyloxyfucoxantine pigment (indicative of 

coccolithophores) found in the area north of the canyon.  

Here we report the results obtained from a plankton survey on living coccolithophores 

from the upper-middle Nazaré Canyon, during late winter (9 – 12 March 2010) (Figure 3.1). On 

the basis of a detailed characterization of the coccolithophore assemblages together with a 

general characterization of environmental conditions prevailing during the sampling period, the 

impact of this major submarine canyon on coccolithophores and phytoplankton biomass is 

discussed.  

 

 

3.2. Regional setting 

3.2.1. Oceanography  

The central Portuguese continental margin is characterized by a relatively narrow shelf of 

a few tens of km width, with a maximum of ~70 km where it projects oceanward in the 

Estremadura promontory, but cut back to very close to shore where it is incised by the Nazaré 

and Lisbon-Setúbal Canyons. The Douro and Tagus are the most important rivers debouching 

on the shelf, with relatively minor contribution of continental runoff from other rivers. From the 

shelf edge located at 160-200 m, a steep upper slope and more gently inclined lower slope 

incised by numerous gullies and canyons, lead down to the Iberia and Tagus abyssal plains. 

Surface water circulation along the Portuguese margin is directly dependent on two main 

current systems transporting water eastwards across the North Atlantic: the North Atlantic 

Current extending to the north of the Iberian Peninsula, and the Azores Current south of Iberia 

(Barton, 2001;  Peliz et al., 2005; Pollard and Pu, 1985; Saunders, 1982). As the Azores Current 

extends eastwards, branches of this current loop smoothly into the Portugal Current and further 

south into the Canary Current. The Portugal Current slowly flows southwards, west of Portugal, 

carrying about 2×10
6
 m

3
/s in the upper 200 m of the water column. It partially continues further 

south into the Canary Current, while another part apparently enters the Mediterranean within a 

shallow surface layer (Barton, 2001; Saunders, 1982). 

The upper 500 m of water column off Portugal, including the surface mixed layer and the 

first thermocline, is constituted by the Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW). This 

water mass, representing the main source of the nutrient-rich upwelled waters on the Portuguese 

coast, shows considerable variation in its hydrological features as it travels along the coast 

(Fiúza, 1984; McCave and Hall, 2002). The ENACW has two main components of different 

origin that converge to this region: a lighter, relatively warm and salty subtropical branch 

(ENACWst) formed along the Azores Front, which gradually loses its characteristics as it 

travels further northwards along the Iberian margin; a less saline colder water mass of subpolar 



Chapter 3 

88 

origin (ENACWsp) slowly flowing southwards below the poleward subtropical branch, related 

with the Subpolar Mode Water formed in the eastern North Atlantic by winter cooling and deep 

convection (Fiúza et al., 1998). 

Beneath the near-surface equatorward flow of the Portugal and Canary currents, the 

Iberian Poleward Current (IPC) can be recognized traveling poleward, counter to the general 

circulation and closely bound to the continental slope, its core extending about 300-400 m 

vertically. This current is mostly restricted to the subsurface layers along most of the eastern 

subtropical gyre, but surfaces whenever the Trade Winds weaken or turn northward (Barton, 

2001). 

Circulation along the Portuguese shelf and upper slope is markedly seasonal, associated 

to the annual cycle of two major atmospheric systems: the Azores high and Iceland low pressure 

system, respectively (e.g. Barton, 2001; Haynes et al., 1993; Relvas et al., 2007). During 

summer, the Azores high pressure system migrates towards the central Atlantic, typically 

inducing Trade Winds to become northerly, inducing an equatorward circulation over the upper 

150-200 m of the water column off Portugal. During winter, when the Azores high pressure 

system is located further south and the Iceland low pressure system intensifies, the dominant 

wind regime becomes southerly along the western Portuguese margin. This induces shoaling of 

the IPC over the upper slope and shelf, where the poleward flow produces an onshore Ekman 

transport, in turn resulting in downwelling conditions over the shelf (Fiúza, 1983; Vitorino et 

al., 2002).  

River runoff is an important feature of the winter circulation over the western Portuguese 

margin, through which a significant discharge of low salinity water occurs into the coastal 

ocean. This results in buoyant plumes that either develop into inshore currents (Relvas et al., 

2007; Otero et al., 2008) or expand further offshore, under the influence of, respectively, 

southerly or northerly-winds over the shelf and slope (Otero et al., 2008). The Western Iberian 

Buoyant Plume, characterized by low salinity (&lt;35.8) and low temperature compared to normal 

shelf waters, is mostly fed by outflow from rivers of northen Portugal (Mondego, Douro, 

Minho, Lima, Vouga). Besides these major rivers, other smaller rivers and lagoons contribute as 

well.  

Interannual variability of circulation along the Portuguese shelf and slope is influenced by 

the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), resulting from fluctuations in the difference of 

atmospheric pressure between the Azores high and the Iceland low. NAO high index conditions 

typically are associated with an increase of the trade winds that bring moist air into Europe, 

resulting in cool summers and mild and wet winters in Europe and its Atlantic forefront. On the 

contrary, NAO low index conditions leads to more extreme atmospheric temperatures, 

producing heat-waves and deep freezing, and an increase of storm activity and rainfall in 

southern Europe and North Africa. Several studies have indicated a decreasing intensity and 

increasing frequency in upwelling events, occurring even during the winter period (e.g. Alvarez 

et al., 2009; Barton, 2001; Ribeiro et al., 2005; Santos et al., 2004; Silva et al., 2008; Vitorino et 

al., 2002), apparently linked with a trend towards the “high index” mode of the NAO observed 

over the last decades, leading also to mild, wet winters over northern Europe and dry conditions

89 

over Portugal (Barton, 2001; Wallace, 2002).  

In addition to thermohaline and wind-driven circulation, tidal currents are also important 

in influencing the hydrodynamics of the Portuguese margin. Particularly where the M2 semi-

diurnal tidal current, the dominant tidal constituent over the Portuguese margin, forces stratified 

upper ocean water over the abrupt topography of the slope and shelf-break (e.g. Quaresma and 

Pichon, 2011), tidal energy is transferred into baroclinic motions in the form of internal waves 

and internal tides. These are very important in mixing the ocean water column, enhancing 

vertical nutrient transport and thus phytoplankton productivity (e.g. Guerreiro et al., 2009), as 

well as in increasing bottom turbulence over the continental shelf and slope, triggering bottom 

sediment resuspension and transport (Huthnance et al., 2002). “Hotspots” of internal tide 

generation on the Portuguese margin appear associated with submarine canyons cutting across 

the shelf and slope (e.g. Portimão canyon, Bruno et al., 2006; Nazaré Canyon, Quaresma et al., 

2007; Quaresma and Pichon, 2011) and with promontories of the continental shelf (e.g. 

Estremadura spur, Quaresma and Pichon, 2011). 

 

 

3.2.2. Nazaré Canyon  

The Nazaré Canyon, the largest submarine canyon of the Portuguese margin, cuts 

completely across the shelf and slope, from less than 1 km from the coastline off the village of 

Nazaré at a water depth of about 50 m to a distance of &gt;210 km from the coast and a water 

depth of 5000 m. An upper, middle and lower section can be distinguished on the basis of 

general morphology and characteristics of the hydrodynamic and sedimentary environment 

(Vanney and Mougenot, 1990; De Stigter et al., 2007; Lastras et al., 2009). The upper canyon 

section consists of a narrow and distinctly V-shaped meandering valley that lies deeply 

entrenched in the shelf. Beyond the shelf edge, it passes into the much broader and U-shaped 

middle section incised in the continental slope. The lower canyon section consists of a broad 

and flat-floored valley at the base of the slope, opening at 5000 m water depth into the Iberia 

Abyssal Plain. 

The physical oceanography of the Nazaré Canyon has been summarised by Tyler et al. 

(2009), largely on the basis of CTD and current meter data collected by the Portuguese 

Hydrographic Institute and Royal NIOZ (final reports of the EUROSTRATAFORM, HERMES 

and HERMIONE European projects). 

Inside the Nazaré Canyon, residual currents are generally aligned along the canyon axis 

as the result of strong topographical control. The current alignment extends well above the 

canyon edges (~150 m depth) implying substantial disturbance of the predominant north-south 

circulation parallel to the general trend of the shelf and slope.  

At depths shallower than 300 m, the residual currents inside the canyon show a distinct 

coupling to the wind-driven current regime over the continental shelf. During winter, the 

occurrence of downwelling conditions over the shelf results in a down-canyon residual flow 

near or just above the canyon edge. Under strong upwelling conditions and southward flow 



Chapter 3 

90 

across the shelf, onshore (up-canyon) flow is observed in the upper canyon, with intensification 

of upwelling near the canyon head. The enhancement of upwelling and associated bottom 

resuspension can be expected to provide a nutrient source supporting enhanced phytoplankton 

concentration south of the canyon (e.g. Hickey, 1995; Kampf, 2006). This seems to be 

confirmed by observations by Mendes et al. (2011) regarding phytopigment distribution patterns 

in surficial waters around the Nazaré Canyon, with maximum concentrations of diatoms 

occurring south of the canyon.  

The interaction of the external (barotropic) tide off the Portuguese coast with the canyon 

topography, in the presence of water stratification, leads to the generation of internal 

(baroclinic) tides (i.e. internal waves of tidal period), which radiate from the generation point 

and propagate the tidal energy vertically (Quaresma et al., 2007; Tyler et al., 2009). Strong 

semi-diurnal bottom currents occur in all parts of the canyon, particularly in its upper and 

middle sections (commonly exceeding 30 cm/s) which, along with the ample supply of fine-

grained sediments from the shelf, result in the permanent haze of suspended matter in the upper 

canyon (De Stigter et al., 2007).  

The generation of non-linear internal waves (NIW) at the canyon’s northern shelf break 

and their refraction towards NE was observed by Quaresma et al. (2007) mainly during summer, 

when stratification of the shelf waters supports the waves. Observations indicate that the NIW 

most likely result from the interaction of the semidiurnal M2 barotropic tide with the canyon 

rim, displaying horizontal and vertical velocities strong enough to resuspend bottom sediments 

along the wave propagation path from the middle to the inner shelf. The injection of nutrients 

from the lower toward the upper levels of the water column forced by the shoreward 

propagation of these NIW has been invoked to explain high concentrations of coccoliths found 

in the sedimentary cover in this near shore position (Guerreiro et al., 2009). Although this 

mechanism occurs mainly during spring and summer, it seems persistent enough to explain such 

anomaly in coccolith distribution.  

In autumn and winter, violent westerly storms generating waves with significant height 

up to 9 m cause widespread sediment resuspension on the shelf and downwelling of turbid 

waters towards the canyon. The location of the canyon head at less than 1 km from the shore 

makes it particularly prone to trap particulate matter transported as bedload and in suspension 

along the shelf (De Stigter et al., 2007; Oliveira et al., 2007).

3.3. Material and methods  

3.3.1. Sample collection  

Sampling was conducted between 9 and 12 of March 2010, on board of NRP “Almirante 

Gago Coutinho” during the 2
nd

 HERMIONE (Hotspot Ecosystem Research and Man’s Impact 

On European Seas) scientific cruise of the Portuguese Hydrographic Institute. Coccolithophore 

communities were investigated in 97 water column samples collected at discrete water depth 

levels between 5 and 110 m depth from 25 CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) casts in and 

around the Nazaré Canyon (Figure 3.1, Appendix D).  

Physical oceanographic, biological and chemical data (i.e. temperature, salinity, turbidity, 

fluorometry and nutrients) and water column samples were collected using a combined Neil 

Brown MKIIIC CTD profiler equipped with an Aquatracka nephelometer, a Seapoint 

fluorometer and a rosette sampler (12 Niskin bottles of 8 litres). 192 suspended matter samples 

were collected from surface, intermediate and bottom nepheloid layers in order to define the 

particulate matter concentration (PMC) and to calibrate the nephelometer response (turbidity). 

The PMC (g/m
3
) was compared to a laboratory calibration of the instrument with a standard 

formazine solution (FTU). The turbidity calibration for March 2010, was FTU = 0.112*PMC 

with r = 0.88.

software. A WSW-ENE oriented transect covering the entire length of the upper-middle Nazaré 

Canyon axis (23 CTD casts) was built to represent density, temperature, salinity and turbidity 

conditions during the sampling period (casts indicated in Figure 3.1; CTD profiles in Figures 

3.2a-d). For a more detailed description of the data referring to wind, sea wave, and river 

discharge and sky conditions, the reader is referred to Guerreiro et al. (2013). 

 

 

 3.3.3. Satellite data 

Monthly averaged surface water chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration between 2006 and 

2011 was assessed from satellite data as a framework for interpreting spatial and temporal 

distribution of phytoplankton in the Nazaré Canyon. Chl-a data acquired by the Moderate-

resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASAs Aqua satellite and processed by The 

Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) were downloaded from the Ocean Color Website 

(http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/). After quality checking and masking, valid data were 

interpolated from a grid of regular latitude-longitude intervals. For each image, with nominal 

resolution of 1 km, data corresponding to three defined transects (one transect along the canyon, 

two other crossing it) were extracted and averaged per month.

3.3.4.1. Coccolithophores 

For the study of coccolithophores, seawater samples of around 2 l were filtered over 

cellulose acetate filters (47 mm diameter and 0.45 ?m pore size) using a low pressure vacuum 

system. The filters were then rinsed with tap water to remove salt and oven-dried at 40 ºC for 24 

hours. A randomly chosen section (approx. 30–45º) of each filter was cut and permanently 

mounted on a glass slide. Coccospheres (cells) were identified and counted under polarized light 

microscope (PLM) (Olympus BX-40) at 1250× magnification. The scanned area per filter varied 

between 0.1 and 3.5 mm
2
, depending on the general cell density. The number of cells per liter of 

seawater was estimated from the number of counted coccospheres multiplied with the ratio of 

filled filter area to observed area and divided by the volume of filtered water (Cros, 2001).  

For the study of the living assemblages (cells) only the water column between 5 and 110 

m water depth was considered. To refine the taxonomic differentiation of Alisphaera spp., 

Algirosphaera robusta, Gephyrocapsa spp., Ophiaster spp., Syracolithus dalmaticus and 

Syracosphaera spp., 13 samples were investigated using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM 

Hitachi S-3500N, at 5 kV). Samples were selected for containing relatively higher cell densities 

and species diversity. A randomly chosen section of the selected filters was fixed with colloidal 

Ag on a SEM stub and sputtered with an Au-Pd coating of maximum 20 nm thick; then, a 

minimum number of 100 vision fields (VF) were observed and counted using magnifications 

between 1000× (observation area of each VF: 126.52 × 94.84 ?m) and 2000× (observation area 

of each VF: 63.26 × 47.42 µm).  

Identification of coccolithophore species followed Jordan et al. (2004) and Young et al. 

(2003), whilst the new website on nannoplankton taxonomy http://nannotax.org (Young et al., 

2011) and specific literature on light microscopy (Frada et al. 2009), Mediterranean 

coccolithophores (Cros and Fortuño 2002) and Syracosphaera genus (Kleijne and Cros, 2009) 

provided useful additional guidance for classification. 

 

 

3.3.4.2. Phytoplankton pigments (Chl-a) and nutrients  

Chl-a concentrations were used as an indicator for phytoplankton biomass. Water samples 

of 2 l were filtered over Whatman GF/F filters (0.7 ?m pore size, 25 mm diameter), and the 

filters were immediately deep-frozen and stored at ?80 °C. Phytoplankton pigments were 

extracted with 2-3 ml of 95 % cold-buffered methanol (2 % ammonium acetate) and analysed 

with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Chromatographic separation was 

carried out following Zapata et al. (2000). Chl-a concentrations obtained from 25 HPLC 

samples were then used to calibrate fluorometry measurements obtained from CTD casts (r
2 

=0.7, with p&amp;lt;0.01). 

Nutrient concentrations (nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, phosphate and silicate) were 

determined using a Skalar SANplus Segmented Flow AutoAnalyzer specially developed for the 

http://nannotax.org/

analysis of saline waters. N–NOx and N–NO2 were determined according to Strickland and 

Parsons (1972), with N–NO3 being estimated by the difference between the previous two; N–

NH4 and Si–SiO2 were determined according to Koroleff (1976); P–PO4 was determined 

according to Murphy and Riley (1962). All methods were adapted to the methodology of 

segmented flow analysis and uncertainties were determined following Mendes et al. (2011). 

 

 

3.3.5. Statistical analysis 

A statistical multivariate analysis (r-mode Factor Analysis by Statistica 10) was 

performed upon the data matrix with coccolithophore cell densities, nutrient concentrations 

(NOx, PO4, SiO2), biomass (fluorometry calibrated with Chl-a concentrations measured by 

HPLC) and physical parameters (temperature, salinity, turbidity) as columns (variables). Results 

from the original data matrices were optimized through Varimax Raw rotation. 

 

 

3.4. Results  

3.4.1. Environmental conditions during the cruise 

The plankton cruise took place under transient environmental conditions in late winter 

2010, as discussed in detail in Guerreiro et al. (2013) (Chapter 2). Sampling was performed at 

the end of an unusually cold winter in Europe (2009–2010) under an exceptionally negative 

phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (Cattiaux et al., 2010; Troupin and Machin, 

2012). Whilst a northerly wind regime began to settle around the start of the cruise, the winter 

mixed layer was still occupying most of the water column over the shelf and upper slope 

(uppermost ~150–200 m water depth), as normally the case during winter off Portugal (Oliveira 

et al., 2004). However, intense river runoff that occurred prior to and continued during the 

cruise had produced a well-established colder and less saline surface layer extending from near 

the coast to more than 50 km offshore, overlying the warmer and saltier winter mixed layer 

waters (Figures 3.2a,b,c). The lowest TS values within this buoyant plume fed by runoff water 

were measured at the surface, approximately between 16 and 30 km off the coast (stations 79 

and 122, respectively). 

The warmer and saltier winter mixed layer associated with the flow of the IPC along the 

Portuguese margin was noticeable below the surface buoyant plume in the entire investigated 

region, generally below 15-20 m water depth, appearing continuous in north-south direction 

close to the shelf-break, at the upper-middle Nazaré Canyon transition. Further offshore it was 

mostly noticed along the southern flank of the middle canyon but weakening northwards where 

significant mixing apparently occurred with colder water masses from north. The TS contrast 

between the superficial BP and the winter mixed layer below was particularly pronounced in the 

upper Nazaré Canyon where the core of the IPC penetrated up-canyon to less than 10 km off the 

coast. TS profiles along the canyon axis show evidence of strong vertical oscillation around

Belatina Valley (station 120) possibly driven by internal tides in this part of the canyon 

(Quaresma et al., 2007) (Figures 3.2a,b,c). 

Turbidity was generally low, with relatively higher FTU values noticed in the surficial 

water layer, as well as at the bottom layer of the upper canyon (i.e. in the canyon head and close 

to the intersection with Vitória tributary). Highest turbidity values recorded around 200–300 m 

water depth appear to reflect bottom sediment resuspension caused by the canyon’s internal tide 

(Figure 3.2d). 

Highest nutrient concentrations were recorded in the relatively cool and low-saline 

surface water of the BP, decreasing to lower concentrations in the winter mixed layer water 

underneath. The vertical decreasing trend was particularly noticeable in the case of SiO2 (Figure 

3.3). NOx/PO4 ratio was generally close to the 16:1 Redfield Ratio typical for marine waters 

(Redfield et al., 1963). A slight deviation toward lower NOx concentrations relative to PO4 in 

most samples suggests that NOx was the major limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth at 

that time.  

Phytoplankton biomass inferred from Chl-a concentrations (max.&amp;lt;0.7 µg/l) was 

generally low during the cruise, with the highest values reached at the uppermost part of the 

water column (above 50 m depth) (Figure 3.4). Highest Chl-a and nutrient concentrations (NOx 

and SiO2) and the lowest salinities were measured at the surface (5 m) near Belatina Valley 

(stations 118 and 120) and north of the upper canyon (stations 112 and 111).

3.4.2. Coccolithophores  

4.4.2.1. Species diversity, cell density and distribution 

A total of 35 distinct taxa of coccolithophores (coccospheres) were recognized. 19 species 

and 4 genera were identified using polarizing light microscopy (PLM) whereas additional 

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis revealed an additional 16 species belonging to 

the genera Syracosphaera, Ophiaster, Alisphaera and Acanthoica, and one holococcolithophore, 

Syracolithus dalmaticus (see Table 3.1). The list of observed species is presented in Appendix 

A.  

Coccolithophore cells occurred within the BP and the upper layers of the winter mixed 

layer as indicated in Figure 3.5. Total cell densities ranged between 4.0×10
3
 and 6.0×10

5
 cells/l 

(Table 3.1). The highest cell densities along a transect covering the upper-middle Nazaré 

Canyon axis were noticed close to Belatina Valley, associated to minimum TS values within the 

BP (stations 118 and 120) (Figure 3.6). High cell densities were also noticed closer to the coast, 

at the canyon’s head (station 87), less than 2 km off the coast, and above the southern canyon 

rim (station 89) (Figure 3.7a). Further offshore toward the open ocean (station 132) lower cell 

densities were observed, distributed more homogeneously over the water column (Figure 3.7b-

c).  

Of the 35 identified taxa, only ten reached significant cell densities of more than 2000 

coccospheres per litre: Emiliania huxleyi, Syracosphaera spp., Gephyrocapsa ericsonii, G. 

oceanica, G. muellerae, Coronosphaera mediterranea, Ophiaster spp., Helicosphaera carteri, 

Syracolithus dalmaticus and Algirosphaera robusta. E. huxleyi was the dominant species during 

the cruise, particularly at the surface close to the shelf-coastal region (Figure 3.8, Table 3.1). 

Below the surface and further offshore, other species gained in relative importance within the 

total assemblage, generally displaying a broader vertical distribution (Figure 3.9; Guerreiro al., 

2013) (Chapter 2). G. ericsonii, A. robusta, Acanthoica spp., Syracosphaera pulchra, S.

854 m and 3478 m water depths, respectively. 

 

 

dalmaticus, Coccolithus pelagicus, Michaelsarsia elegans and, to a lesser extent G. oceanica, 

displayed a downward decreasing trend in cell density, similar to that of E. huxleyi. Other 

groups of species such as Syracosphaera spp, Ophiaster spp. and Gephyrocapsa muellerae 

revealed a more uniform vertical distribution. The remaining taxa did not reveal a specific 

vertical distribution pattern (Figure 3.8). 

A coast to open ocean ecological and hydrological dichotomy is well illustrated in Figure 

3.9: E. huxleyi dominated at the surface in coastal waters (stations 87 and 120, Figures 3.9c,b), 

whereas Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. were dominant further offshore in more open-

ocean conditions, and showing a broader vertical distribution (station 132, Figure 3.9a). Closer 

to Belatina Valley, the three taxa co-existed, with E. huxleyi largely dominating at the surface, 

and the latter taxa relatively increasing in the subsurface water mass (Figure 3.9b). G. 

muellerae, G. oceanica and S. dalmaticus were also more abundant near the coast, whereas G. 

ericsonii and C. mediterranea revealed a broader lateral distribution.

4.2.2. Multivariate analysis 

Results from factor analysis revealed four distinct factor assemblages explaining 46 % of 

the total variance in the data (Table 3.2, Figure 3.10). Factor 1 (F1) explains 22 % of total 

variability, with NOx, SiO2, Acan and Eh recording the highest (positive) factor loadings, in 

opposition to S, T (and Syraco and Ophi) (negative loadings). Factor 2 (F2) explains 10 % of 

total variance, being represented by Ge, Biom and Cm (and Eh) (positive loadings). Factor 3 

(F3) explains 8 % of total variability and is represented by Dtub, Alisph (and PO4) (negative 

loadings). Factor 4 (F4) explains 7 % of total variability and it is represented by Go (and Turb) 

(positive loadings) in opposition to Meleg (negative loadings).  

Samples influenced by factor assemblage NOx, SiO2, Acanthoica spp. and E. huxleyi (F1 

positive scores) were better represented at the surface, particularly close to Belatina Valley 

(stations 118 and 120) but also around the uppermost reaches of the Nazaré Canyon (stations 

112, 111, 102) and the canyon head (stations 85, 87) (Figure 3.10a). Below the surface this 

assemblage was practically inexistent or weakly represented. Samples influenced by salinity, 

temperature, Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. (F1 negative scores) were preferentially 

represented further offshore and showed a relatively broader lateral distribution, and at Belatina 

Valley region below the surface (Figure 3.10a).  

Samples influenced by G. ericsonii, phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a), C. mediterranea 

(and to a lesser extent, E. huxleyi) (F2 positive scores) revealed a rather broad lateral

distribution, preferentially at the uppermost 25 m in the Nazaré Canyon head and at Belatina 

Valley, whereas further offshore a broader vertical distribution is noticed (Figure 3.10b).  

Samples influenced by Discosphaera tubifera, Alisphaera spp. and PO4 (F3 negative 

scores) recorded their strongest signal at 50 m water depth, at the Nazaré Canyon head (station 

87) (Figure 3.10c).  

Samples influenced by G. oceanica and turbidity (F4 positive scores) were consistently 

distributed in more neritic-coastal regions, particularly at the canyon head and surroundings 

(stations 87, 93), at all water depths. In the intersection between the canyon axis and Vitória 

tributary (station 80) and at Belatina Valley, this assemblage was well represented at the 

uppermost 25 m (Figure 3.10d).  

The relatively low percentage of variance explained by F1-F4 (&amp;lt;50%) reflects the highly 

transient meteorological and hydrological conditions during the cruise, where water masses 

(both oceanic and continental) were still adjusting to the circulation imposed by the shifting 

wind regime (see Guerreiro et al., 2013). Nevertheless, factor analysis helped to reveal and 

understand the most important ecological signals during the cruise:   

(a) coccolithophore cell density and diversity “hotspot” at the Nazaré Canyon head, 

despite of abundant detritic material (i.e. terrigenous particles, reworked coccoliths). Significant 

amounts of perfectly preserved cells, particularly of E. huxleyi, together with several other 

species, testify of the high diversity found in this part of the canyon (see Appendix B). 

Gephyrocapsa muellerae, Syracolithus dalmaticus, Acanthoica spp. and Michaelsarsia elegans 

had their maxima in this area (Table 3.1). Additional SEM observations confirmed the relative 

increase of Calcidiscus leptoporus, Coccolithus pelagicus and Helicosphaera carteri in the 

canyon head, together with the single occurrence of Syracosphaera amoena (formerly S. 

bannockii, see Dimiza et al 2008), Syracosphaera molischii, Palusphaera vandelii and 

Syracosphaera anthos. G. oceanica was also systematically better represented in the canyon 

head at all water depths, associated to turbidity;  

(b) Stations close to Belatina Valley seemed to represent a nutrient, Chl-a and 

coccolithophore “hotspot”, with E. huxleyi, G. ericsonii, C. mediterranea (and G. oceanica) 

dominating the assemblages at the uppermost 25 m water depth, and Syracosphaera spp. and 

Ophiaster spp. dominating underneath;  

(c) E. huxleyi was clearly displaced towards the neritic/coastal zone, and G. ericsonii and 

C. mediterranea more towards the neritic-oceanic zone. Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. 

were consistently better represented below the surface and further offshore.

3.4.3. Monthly averaged Chl-a from satellite imagery 

Time-series of monthly averaged Chl-a between 2006 and 2011 calculated from satellite 

data are shown for three transects: transect A, WSW–ENE oriented, covering the whole upper-

middle canyon axis (Figure 3.11a); transect B, N–S oriented, cutting across the canyon axis at 

Belatina Valley (station 120) (Figure 3.11b); and transect C oriented at a low angle to the 

coastline and cutting across the canyon head (station 87). 

The along-canyon time series (Figure 3.11a) illustrates the recurrent maximum of Chl-a 

in offshore waters occurring around March and April of all years, and a more persistent 

presence of high Chl-a concentrations in the coastal zone during spring and summer months. 

There is no evidence of persistent or particularly high Chl-a at Belatina Valley, although the 

transition zone between Chl-a enriched waters extending from the coast and Chl-a poorer 

offshore waters is often located approximately in this region. A map of average Chl-a 

concentration for March 2010 (see Figure B in Auxiliary Material, Chapter 2) illustrates the 

broad spatial spread of this Chl-a enrichment, occupying a significant portion of the continental 

shelf and extending approximately up to the middle shelf region, apparently coming from north. 

Slightly higher Chl-a concentrations are noticed along the canyon axis in comparison to the 

shelf immediately north of it, particularly at Belatina Valley, where the highest coccolithophore 

cell densities and Chl-a were recorded in situ during the cruise. Similar offshore outbreaks of 

Chl-a enrichment were also observed in March 2006 and 2009, extending almost to the shelf-

break in 2006, and even beyond in 2009 (data not shown).

The Chl-a time series for the transect across the canyon at Belatina Valley (Figure 3.11b) 

shows higher concentrations in the canyon meander and adjacent northern and southern shelf in 

March of 2006, 2009 and 2010, reflecting the seasonal offshore spread of Chl-a enrichment. 

Chl-a concentrations are consistently higher south of 39.4 N where the transect is located in the 

more productive near shore area, whereas concentration is much lower along the northern part 

of the transect located in the less productive offshore area. 

Persistently high Chl-a concentration is observed close to the coast, particularly in spring 

and summer months (between March and October), reaching the highest concentrations in 

August-October 2007, and June-September 2010. The time series for the NNE-SSW near-shore 

transect cutting across the canyon head (Figure 3.11c) shows maximum Chl-a concentrations in 

the canyon head and immediate vicinity in these time-intervals, exceeding concentrations on the 

surrounding shelf. The timing of Chl-a peaks in the canyon head, between mid-August and mid-

September 2007; between mid-May and mid-June 2009; in March and between mid-June and 

mid-August 2010, is conspicuously different from that of the widespread Chl-a enrichment in 

early spring extending across the shelf.  

 

 

3.5. Discussion 

3.5.1. Late winter coccolithophore assemblages off Portugal 

Moderately low coccolithophore cell densities (between 3.6×10
3
 and 6×10

5
 cells/l) and 

low phytoplankton biomass (Chl-a) (max.&amp;lt;0.7 µg/l) were observed during the sampling period, 

which is in good agreement with observations by Moita (2001) and Silva et al. (2009) regarding 

wintertime phytoplankton production off Portugal. The lack of a clear correlation between Chl-a 

and nutrients (Figure 3.4) suggests that phytoplankton production was generally low and not 

limited by nutrient availability within the BP. In comparison, previous studies reporting a much 

stronger relationship with nutrient concentration attributed a decisive role to haline-stratification 

in promoting phytoplankton blooms during late winter upwelling events off Portugal (Peliz and 

Fiúza, 1999; Ribeiro et al., 2005; Santos et al., 2004). The subdued phytoplankton growth here 

observed is interpreted as resulting from important advective mixing promoted by the BP during 

this period of intense runoff, sub-optimal light conditions due to cloud cover and initial 

relatively high turbidity within the superficial BP (discussed in Guerreiro et al., 2013) (Chapter 

2). 

Four distinct ecological signatures (factors) were extracted from multivariate statistical 

analysis applied to the present dataset, explaining 46 % of the variability within the data and 

revealing the most important environmental and ecological signals during the cruise (Figure 

3.10, Table 3.2).  

Factor 1 (positive loadings) is interpreted as representing the gradient between the runoff-

influenced coastal-neritic zone, where relatively high nutrient concentrations were retained in 

the superficial BP, and the oceanic mixed water that characterizes the Portuguese margin during 



Chapter 3 

112 

winter, present below the BP closer to the coast and surfacing further offshore. Acanthoica spp. 

and Emiliania huxleyi appear positively correlated with nutrients at the surface within more 

coastal-neritic conditions. F1 was strongly expressed close to Belatina Valley and around the 

Nazaré Canyon head and surroundings, but nearly absent below the surface, highlighting the 

strong vertical density gradient of the BP and the clear preference of these taxa to develop at the 

sunlit nutrient-rich surface water layer (Figure 3.9b,c and 3.10a).  

The large dominance of E. huxleyi at the less saline sunlit surface layer and its preference 

for more coastal/neritic conditions is in good agreement with several authors describing this 

species as having a highly cosmopolitan distribution independent of sea surface temperature, 

and attaining high cell densities in both oligotrophic and eutrophic environments (Andruleit, 

2007; Baumann et al., 2000; Winter et al., 1994). This species was considered to be a possible 

indicator for more stable regions regarding with nutrient availability (Andruleit and Rogalla, 

2002), and is often found associated with nutrient-rich and productive coastal regions (e.g. 

Andruleit, 2007; Giraudeau and Bailey, 1995; Sprengel et al., 2002; Silva et al., 2008). From 

various locations it has been reported as responsible for major blooms (e.g. Garcia et al., 2011; 

Knappertsbush and Brummer, 1995).  

E. huxleyi was also weakly positively correlated to Gephyrocapsa ericsonii, 

Coronosphaera mediterranea and Chl-a in Factor 2 (positive loadings), particularly in what 

revealed to be the most productive station monitored during the cruise, located around Belatina 

Valley (Figure 3.10b). Further offshore where E. huxleyi was not dominating the 

coccolithophore community, the two taxa were also important. G. ericsonii was the second most 

abundant species during the cruise, next to E. huxleyi, which is in good agreement with several 

studies indicating its preference for nutrient-enriched coastal-neritic regions (Giraudeau and 

Bailey, 1995; Silva et al., 2009; Winter et al., 1979). C. mediterranea was also significantly 

present during the cruise, supporting previous observations reporting high cell densities of this 

species off the Nazaré region (Moita et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2008), and fast response to 

nutrient availability in this area during winter (Guerreiro et al., 2013) (Chapter 2).  

On the contrary, Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. (negative loadings of Factor 1) 

showed a higher affinity for warmer and saltier open ocean waters, and these species appeared 

more broadly distributed along the water column (Figures 3.9a and 3.10a). Closer to the coast, 

these species were generally less frequent, although higher cell densities were observed below 

the surface, where they were apparently able to compete with E. huxleyi. This suggests that the 

lower light and nutrient level within neritic subsurface waters were less limiting for these taxa 

than for E. huxleyi. Results are consistent with Andruleit (2007) in terms of the broad depth 

range of Syracosphaera spp. but not concerning the affinity of this group for nutrient 

availability in coastal regions as reported in earlier studies (e.g. Andruleit, 2007; Andruleit and 

Rogalla, 2002; Giraudeau and Bailey, 1995). Whereas SEM observations indicated that 

Syracosphaera marginoporata was the dominant species within the group (max.1.4×10
5
 cells/l), 

the low level of taxonomical differentiation of Syracosphaera spp. from the above mentioned 

studies  may explain the discrepancy between its reportedly association with relatively eutrophic 

conditions and its preferential distribution in the relatively oligotrophic oceanic waters of the

Nazaré Canyon region. 

The same applies to Ophiaster spp. of which little is known yet in terms of both 

ecological preferences and biogeographic distribution. Whereas our late winter observations 

seem to indicate an association of this genus with oceanic-oligotrophic conditions, other studies 

describe it as associated to nutrient-rich environments such as subtropical frontal zones and 

upwelling areas (e.g. Boeckel and Baumann, 2008; Kleijne, 1993). 

Discosphaera tubifera and Alisphaera spp. were not abundant during the cruise (&lt;2000 

cells/l), and found weakly correlated to PO4 (negative loadings of Factor 3), very close to the 

coast at the Nazaré Canyon head (station 87, 50 m water depth) (Figure 3.10c). In the recent 

literature, D. tubifera is typically associated with subtropical gyres (Boeckel and Baumann, 

2008) and oligotrophic waters, always outside the upwelling area (e.g. Andruleit et al., 2003; 

Kleijne, 1992). Ecological preferences of Alisphaera spp. are still poorly known, whereas 

Kleijne (1993) found it associated with G. oceanica in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean and 

Sourthern Red Sea, both increasing towards the central upwelling zone. In addition to these 

taxa, the sporadic occurrence of other species of subtropical affinity in the upper Nazaré 

Canyon, i.e. Rhabdosphaera clavigera, Palusphaera vandelii, Umbellosphaera irregularis, 

Scyphosphaera apsteinii and Umbilicosphaera hulburtiana, and the local relative increase of 

species that exhibited an oceanic affinity during the cruise, i.e. Calcidiscus leptoporus, 

Coccolithus pelagicus, Syracosphaera amoena, and Syracosphaera molischii were also noticed. 

The relatively oligotrophic signature of coccolithophore assemblages observed in subsurface 

waters along the Nazaré Canyon axis seems in favour of the hypothesis that the canyon acts as a 

preferential pathway for advection of oceanic waters derived from ENACWst from offshore 

onto more nearshore areas during winter (see section 3.5.2).  

Gephyrocapsa oceanica appears to be related to turbidity, although the correlation is 

somewhat weak (positive loadings of Factor 4). This species was consistently distributed closer 

to the coast (&amp;lt;10 km) at all water depths, particularly at the canyon head and adjacent shelf 

(Figure 3.10d). The broad depth range of G. oceanica was also recognized by Andruleit (2007) 

and Houghton and Guptha (1991), as well as its tolerance for lithogenic particles, which would 

be in accordance with the occurrence of G. oceanica in the dynamic canyon head area; water 

samples collected from this area displayed a highly content in terrigenous particles and 

reworked coccoliths; see Appendix B, Figures 45 and 46). The coastal preference of G. 

oceanica is also in good agreement with Silva et al. (2008) and Guerreiro et al. (2013; 

submitted-b) (Chapters 2 and 4), who described this species as a typical coastal coccolithophore, 

well adapted to the nutrient-rich and productive environment off Portugal. The species seems 

able to quickly respond to nutrient input (Andruleit and Rogalla, 2002; Andruleit et al., 2003; 

Broerse et al., 2000; Giraudeau and Bailey, 1995; Sprengel et al., 2002; Winter et al., 1994). 

The relatively low cell densities of this species confirm the generally low-productive conditions 

during the cruise.

3.5.2. Influence of the submarine canyon and hydrological conditions 

Although phytoplankton production apparently had not yet responded to higher nutrient 

availability provided by runoff, as revealed by generally low coccolithophore cell and Chl-a 

concentrations (see section 2.5.1 in Chapter 2, Guerreiro et al., 2013), local abundance and 

diversity “hotspots” were noticed in the upper Nazaré Canyon axis close to Belatina Valley 

(stations 120 and 118) and in the canyon head (station 87).  

Of particular interest for the canyon head dynamics are the sporadic occurrences of 

typical subtropical-oligotrophic species, such as Discosphaera tubifera and Palusphaera 

vandelii. These species were only observed in this proximal part of the canyon and may be 

interpreted as tracers for the preferential onflow of ENACWst through the upper canyon during 

winter, as revealed by TS profiles along the Nazaré Canyon axis (Figures 3.2a,b). Shoreward 

deflection of circulation in the upper water column is expected to be stronger when the water 

column above the shelf and upper slope is relatively unstratified (see Allen, 1996; She and 

Klinck, 2000), as typically the case off Portugal during this time of the year (Oliveira et al., 

2004).  

Along with these subtropical species, a diverse assemblage dominated by the productive 

Emiliania huxleyi, Gephyrocapsa ericsonii and Coronosphaera mediterranea was observed in 

the canyon head. Maxima of other species, both neritic-coastal (i.e. Gephyrocapsa oceanica, 

Acanthoica spp.) and neritic-oceanic (i.e. Gephyrocapsa muellerae, Syracolithus dalmaticus and 

Alisphaera spp.) were also observed in this area. Whereas during the low productive winter 

season the shoreward advection of oceanic waters through the canyon can be traced by 

relatively diverse coccolithophore assemblages with oligotrophic subtropical affinity, satellite 

data clearly show a maximum in Chl-a concentration at the canyon head between March and 

October suggesting that upwelling of oceanic waters in the canyon head enhances 

phytoplankton productivity making the canyon head the most persistently productive part of the 

inner shelf zone (Figures 3.11a,c). Also during the years of lower productivity a relative 

increase of Chl-a is noticed at the canyon head. Previous observations from Mendes et al. 

(2011) had already indicated that the highest Chl-a concentrations during an upwelling event 

occurred at the canyon head (&gt; 4 ?g/l).  

Enhanced Chl-a concentrations observed in satellite imagery south of the Nazaré Canyon 

and close to Cape Carvoeiro supports previous observations of Mendes et al. (2011) of 

persistently high concentrations of diatoms in this area, interpreted as reflecting the occurrence 

of intensified upwelling along the southern canyon rim extending its influence over the southern 

shelf, and persisting even during relaxation of upwelling-favourable winds. Enhancement of 

upwelling in the canyon head and nearby shelf is in accordance with studies of Bosley et al. 

(2004), Hickey (1995) and Skliris and Djenidi (2006). However, the recurrent generation of 

upwelling filaments off Cape Carvoeiro during spring-summer should also be considered when 

explaining high production of phytoplankton in this area (e.g. Fiúza, 1983; Haynes et al., 1993; 

Peliz et al., 2002). 

The region close to Belatina Valley, where the upper canyon axis makes a tight turn 



Influence of the Nazaré Canyon 

 
115 

 

(stations 120 and 118), also stood out for particular hydrological and ecological characteristics. 

The highest phytoplankton biomass and coccolithophore cell densities during the cruise were 

observed in this area, with E. huxleyi, G. ericsonii and C. mediterranea dominating the 

assemblage in the uppermost 25 m of the water column. The lowest TS values and the highest 

nutrient concentrations within the superficial BP were also measured here, whereas indications 

of enhanced vertical baroclinic oscillation were noticed underneath the BP (Figures 3.2a,b), 

interpreted as resulting from the interaction of internal waves with the canyon topography. The 

conversion of barotropic to baroclinic tidal motion occurs in the presence of water stratification 

and leads to the generation of internal (baroclinic) tides (i.e. internal waves of tidal period), 

which radiate from the generation point and propagate the tidal energy vertically (Quaresma et 

al., 2007; Tyler et al., 2009). The vertical density gradient existing between the BP (above) and 

the ENACWst (below) within the confined topography of the upper canyon will likely promote 

the baroclinic oscillation of the water masses involved. In addition, the presence of a meander in 

this part of the canyon axis appears to block the flow of the internal wave, leading to local 

amplification of the vertical oscillation. One could speculate that this represents a typical 

hydrological feature of the canyon during wintertime, given that it is during this time of the year 

that the IPC usually surfaces and reaches particularly nearshore areas within the canyon. During 

summer, when the IPC retreats down to slope water depths, baroclinic activity near the surface 

is mainly associated to water column thermo-haline stratification typical of this season (e.g. 

Quaresma et al., 2007). 

The highest cell and Chl-a concentrations measured in situ close to Belatina Valley may 

be interpreted to merely represent a local expression of shelf-wide high phytoplankton 

production recurrently occurring during the month of March (Figures 3.11a and Figure B in 

Auxiliary Material, Chapter 2). Although slightly higher monthly Chl-a concentrations appear to 

be roughly aligned with the canyon axis in comparison to the northern shelf, in particular close 

to the meander (Figure B-b in Auxiliary Material, Chapter 2), it is very hard to decipher whether 

this reflects a recurrent physical phenomenon related to the canyon or merely an artefact 

produced by the satellite acquisition. Given that the regional Chl-a outbreak observed in satellite 

imagery consistently occurs in late winter/early spring of most years, occasionally also in early 

autumn, but never in full winter or full summer time, it is likely representing the early spring 

and autumn phytoplankton bloom, controlled primarily by the increase in light availability in 

spring and replenishment of nutrients in autumn. The more intense offshore blooms recorded in 

March of 2006, 2009 and 2010 may result from late-winter and early-spring runoff in 

combination with short-term northerly winds over the shelf, a condition described by several 

authors (i.e. Guerreiro et al., 2013; Peliz and Fiúza., 1999; Ribeiro et al., 2005; Santos et al., 

2004; Chapter 2). 

In situ measurements indicating enhanced productivity in the surroundings of Belatina 

Valley should, therefore, primarily reveal the presence of a front generated between the BP and 

the shelf-slope waters during a hydrologically and meteorologically highly transient period in 

this region (Guerreiro et al., 2013 – Chapter 2). Nevertheless, in view of the particular location, 



Chapter 3 

116 

other phenomena could be invoked to explain the local phytoplankton increase, which may be 

too short-lived and localized to be identified within monthly averaged Chl-a distribution maps. 

As suggested above, the abrupt seabed topography of the Nazaré Canyon is likely to 

induce perturbations in the flow of water masses on the shelf. Fronts between relatively 

productive coastal water masses and less-productive open ocean water masses will tend to 

meander across the canyon, adding complexity to spatial distribution of particulate matter in the 

surface water. Since the sampling cruise took place during the winter-spring transition when the 

water masses were still adjusting, the canyon topography might be expected to have a noticable 

influence on the circulation. In contrast, during typical summer-conditions, wind forcing will 

play a more prominent role in determining surface water circulation.  

Belatina Valley appears to be a region of significant topographic effect on the front of the 

low salinity BP, as indicated by the occurrence of the strongest vertical density gradients in this 

area. Quaresma (2012) reported on the existence of a barotropic water mass flux of convergent-

divergent periodic motion between the interior of the canyon and the shelf close to Belatina 

Valley, driven by the barotropic onshore-offshore water flow. According to this author, the 

canyon axis acts as drain for shelf water at this location during every low tide. This water 

exchange may result in the concentration of nutrients within the surface water layer, whose 

time-integrated effect would result in a local nutrient-enrichment favorable for phytoplankton 

growth. Several modeling studies revealed the importance of ocean currents interacting with 

submarine canyons, enhancing productivity and influencing phytoplankton distribution by 

funneling and trapping plankton within the canyons. These studies highlight the predominant 

effect of local primary production on the canyon food web, in comparison to other potential 

sources (Bosley et al., 2004; Macquart-Moulin and Patriti, 1996; Skliris and Djenidi, 2006). 

In addition, one could speculate that internal tidal pumping driven by intensified vertical 

baroclinic oscillation around Belatina Valley could contribute to phytoplankton growth in this 

area, similar to what has recently been described from Monterey Canyon (California, USA) by 

Ryan et al. ( 2005; 2010). These authors described the upsurge of a wedge-shaped tongue of 

cold, dense water from the canyon, flowing up onto the continental shelf. The intruding water 

mass was observed to entrain a plume of nutrient-rich turbid water from the seafloor up to the 

surface, above which high concentrations of phytoplankton were observed. In the Nazaré 

Canyon, during a cruise performed in November 2002, a vertical turbid plume was observed at 

the Belatina Valley area, extending upward from a level of intense intermediate nepheloid layers 

at 800-900 m water depths to about 300 m. This plume was interpreted as reflecting 

resuspension by the canyon’s internal tide, enhanced by the strong density gradient between the 

ENACW (above) and the denser Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) (below) (Oliveira et al., 

2007). Such baroclinic vertical oscillation, amplified in the canyon meander, may be responsible 

for bringing nutrients from below the canyon rim during winter, promoting phytoplankton 

growth in the upper part of the water column. However, our water column turbidity profiles and 

vertical distribution of coccolithophores and nutrients show no evidence of the occurrence of 

this process during the investigated late winter period, where enhanced nutrient concentrations 

appeared predominantly associated with the BP (see Guerreiro et al., 2013). Baroclinic activity

is more likely to gain in importance during stratified summer conditions. 

 

3.5.3. Satellite data versus in situ measurements 

Our observations, both long-term Chl-a concentrations obtained from satellite data and in 

situ quantification, suggest that the Nazaré Canyon may locally favor, at least indirectly, the 

development of phytoplankton, including coccolithophores. This is the case for the canyon 

head, which appears to be the stage of recurrent higher productivity in comparison to the 

adjacent shelf. However, in the case of Belatina Valley, where in situ observations revealed 

local Chl-a and coccolithophore cell enhancement, monthly averaged productivity obtained 

from satellite suggest that enhanced Chl-a production was not confined to that specific area but 

occurred over a much wider area including most of the shelf (transect B, Figure 11b).  

On the one hand, lacking in situ observations from outside the canyon, we cannot 

ascertain whether higher Chl-a and cell densities obtained from this area are actually confined to 

the canyon axis, or are part of a larger pattern not necessarily related to the canyon. On the other 

hand, it cannot be expected that monthly Chl-a averages obtained from satellite data will match 

exactly the coccolithophore and Chl-a peaks measured in situ and only representing one instant 

of the annual productivity. Different spatial and temporal scales are involved: whereas the 

satellite data reveal patterns of phytoplankton distribution at the surface at relatively high 

resolution, insight of phytoplankton productivity at deeper levels in the water column can only 

be obtained from in situ measurements. Differences between the two will expectedly be largest 

under the highly transient meteorological and oceanographic conditions characteristic of the late 

winter period, as prevailing during the cruise.  

Intensified baroclinic activity at Belatina Valley might well promote biological 

production events that are too deep and short-lived to be detected by monthly Chl-a averages 

obtained by satellite. The rapid response of certain species of coccolithophores to regional 

meteorological and hydrological variations off central Portugal was recently demonstrated by 

Guerreiro et al. (2013) (Chapter 2). Satellite imagery has a tremendous potential to describe 

larger-scale phenomena prevailing on the Portuguese margin, but it may not be the best 

approach to investigate smaller-scale processes, for which higher temporal and spatial resolution 

are probably required.  

Validation of hypotheses presented here requires additional sampling surveys integrated 

with meteorological and hydrological monitoring in order to address the seasonal and 

interannual variability of phytoplankton (in general) and coccolithophores (in particular), in 

relation with physical processes in the Nazaré Canyon.

3.6. Conclusions  

This study is the first attempt to characterize coccolithophore assemblages occurring in 

the context of an active submarine canyon. A late winter low-productive period was investigated 

in the Nazaré Canyon (off central Portugal) during which warm and saline waters fed by the IPC 

were still strongly influencing the hydrology of the shelf and slope, and the winter mixed layer 

occupied the entire water column of the shelf-upper slope. The canyon was clearly acting as a 

conduit for the onshore advection of relatively nutrient-poor oceanic waters to very nearshore 

areas (less than 10 km off the coast).  

Runoff prior and during the cruise was an important source of nutrients into the system, 

as indicated by high nutrient concentrations that were measured in the relatively low saline 

buoyant plume overlying the winter mixed layer in the coastal zone. Nevertheless, the weak 

correlation of nutrients with biomass suggests that phytoplankton production had not yet 

responded to higher nutrient availability, probably resulting from important advective mixing 

promoted by the BP during this period of intense runoff, sub-optimal light conditions due to 

cloud cover and initial relatively high suspended sediment load within the surface water layer 

(discussed in Guerreiro et al., 2013 – Chapter 2). 

Two main coccolithophore assemblages were distinguished, representing the gradient 

between the runoff-influenced coastal-neritic zone and the oceanic mixed water conditions that 

characterize the Portuguese margin during winter: (1) Emiliania huxleyi was the dominant taxon 

at the surface within more coastal-neritic conditions and, together with Gephyrocapsa ericsonii 

and Coronosphaera mediterranea, represent the more productive assemblage during the 

sampling period. (2) Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. showed a clearly higher affinity for 

open-ocean conditions, displaying a generally broader vertical distribution. Closer to the coast, 

these taxa were able to compete well with E. huxleyi in the subsurface layer, suggesting that 

lower light and nutrient level within more neritic conditions were less limiting for 

Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. as it was for E. huxleyi. 

Chl-a time series obtained from satellite data suggest that the Nazaré Canyon head is 

often the stage of high productivity between March and October, which makes the canyon head 

the most persistently productive part of the upper-middle canyon. In situ observations also 

revealed a coccolithophore diversity “hotspot” in this area, including both oligotrophic-oceanic 

and opportunistic-coastal taxa. The single occurrence of typically subtropical-oligotrophic 

species (i.e. Discosphaera tubifera, Palusphaera vandelii, Calcidiscus leptoporus) is interpreted 

as indicative for the shoreward flow of ENACWst intensified along the upper canyon during 

winter. In addition to these species, a diversified assemblage dominated by the productive E. 

huxleyi, G. ericsonii and C. mediterranea, together with other species which have their 

maximum occurrence in the canyon head area including both neritic/coastal (i.e. Gephyrocapsa 

oceanica, Acanthoica spp.) and neritic/oceanic species (i.e. Gephyrocapsa muellerae, 

Syracolithus dalmaticus, Alisphaera spp. and Michaelsarsia elegans) may also reflect exchange 

of water masses between neritic-coastal and oceanic regions through the canyon during winter. 

Local enhancement of nutrient concentration and coccolithophore cell concentration was

observed near the Belatina Valley, with E. huxleyi, G. ericsonii and C. mediterranea dominating 

the assemblage at the uppermost 25 m of the water column. In addition, monthly averaged 

satellite data reveal slightly higher Chl-a concentrations apparently roughly aligned with the 

canyon axis, close to Belatina Valley. We hypothesize that this imprint may be tracing the time-

integrated effect of barotropic water mass flux into Belatina Valley and the meandering of the 

low-salinity front into this location. Based on our in situ observations and on recent studies 

identifying this narrower part of the canyon axis as an area of intensified vertical water 

movement, we suggest that Belatina Valley may potentially be a favourable region for 

phytoplankton local enhancement.   

Results presented here provide some valuable indications with regards to the important 

and persistet influence of the Nazaré Canyon on the ecology and distribution of 

coccolithophores and phytoplankton biomass at the central Portuguese margin. The results 

highlight the need of long-term multi-proxy investigations in order to address the seasonal and 

interannual variability in phytoplankton in relation with the seasonal- and/or topographically 

driven physical phenomena associated with the Nazaré Canyon.

Abstract 

In this study we describe recent coccolith assemblages from surface sediments of the 

central Portuguese continental margin. Assemblages from the Nazaré and Lisbon-Setúbal 

submarine canyons are compared with those from adjacent shelf and slope regions. By 

investigating North-South and onshore-offshore trends in coccolith concentrations and species 

percentages, and by correlation with sediment characteristics (sediment bulk composition and 

particle-size, Corg/Ntot and sediment accumulation rate), (paleo)ecological information can be 

distinguished from taphonomical effects (dissolution, lateral transport and dilution with 

terrigenous material). Multivariate analysis was used to statistically reveal and summarize the 

most important signals preserved on the sedimentary record. 

Coronosphaera mediterranea, Helicosphaera carteri and Gephyrocapsa oceanica 

displayed a markedly coastal distribution, revealing to be good (paleo)ecological proxies for 

enhanced productivity in the upper Nazaré Canyon and Estremadura spur, whereas Calcidiscus 

leptoporus and the taxonomic group composed by Umbilicosphaera sibogae, Umbellosphaera 

irregularis and Rhabdosphaera spp. appeared to be a good proxy for production occurring 

further offshore and for onflow of ENACWst towards the southern part of the Portuguese shelf. 

Increase of Gephyrocapsa muellerae in the upper reaches of the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon may be 

tracing the preferential onflow of oceanic temperate water masses (ENACWsp) through the 

canyon toward coastal regions, and/or indicating up-canyon transport of resuspended coccoliths 

in the benthic boundary layer. 

The mix of coccoliths from both coastal-neritic and oceanic species in the canyons appear 

to reflect their capacity to promote the exchange of water masses between more coastal and 

oceanic regions, in comparison to the adjacent shelf and slope regions, as well as the role of 

internal tides in disturbing and homogenizing the sedimentary record. Sediments from the 

Nazaré Canyon are clearly enriched in coccoliths from coastal-neritic species, suggesting a 

more dynamical and nutrient-rich environment favourable for r-selected species to develop, 

although some down-canyon displacement of coastal-neritic coccoliths should also be 

considered. On the contrary, relatively higher proportions of coccoliths from oceanic taxa in the 



Chapter 4

Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon suggests more oceanic and stable conditions, probably in relation with 

its greater distance to the coastal dynamics and limited down-canyon transport. 

This study highlights the impact of sea bottom topography and related oceanographic 

circulation on both taphonomy and ecology of coccolithophores, and provides new insights in 

the role of submarine canyons in influencing the coccolithophore assemblages closer to the 

coast.

4.1. Introduction 

Calcareous nannoplankton, predominantly represented by coccolithophores, has the best 

fossil record of all marine phytoplankton, with the exception of polar regions (Ziveri et al., 

2004). Their calcitic cell-covers (coccoliths or nannoliths sensu lato), are produced by 

biomineralization of tiny calcite crystals arranged according preferential orientations, and 

represent morphological elements with taxonomic and phylogenetic meaning (Pienaar, 1994; 

Young, 1994). By becoming preserved in the geological archive, the coccoliths store valuable 

information on palaeoenvironmental conditions from the photic zone (McIntyre and Bé, 1967; 

Roth, 1994; Baumann et al., 2000; Boeckel et al., 2008). As such they can be used as markers of 

paleoceanographic processes, sea surface water masses, productivity and climate change (e.g. 

Beaufort et al., 2001; 2011; Flores et al., 2000; Ziveri et al., 2004; Silva et al., 2008). 

The correspondence between the coccolith species assemblages preserved in the seabed 

and the living communities thriving in the adjacent photic layer is, however, complex, 

particularly within shallower marine environments such as continental shelves. Complexity 

further increases in heterogeneous and dynamic regions such as submarine canyons, often acting 

as morphological traps of sediment particles and organic matter from the continent and shelf, 

and simultaneously, as preferential conduits through which the transport of sediments between 

the coast and the deep sea is intensified (e.g. dense-water cascading and gravity-driven flow 

events) (e.g. Schmidt et al., 2001; Van Weering et al., 2002; Canals et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 

2007; De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011).  

Apart from their role in channeling water mass exchange and sediment transport between 

the shelf and slope, increased phytoplankton density has been reported to be associated to 

submarine canyons, resulting from upwelling and bottom sediment resuspension in the upper 

canyon reaches (e.g. Hickey, 1995; Kampf, 2006). The potential of physical processes within 

canyons to concentrate marine organisms in and around the canyons, also related to local 

enhancement of primary production, has been reported in several studies (e.g. Macquart-Moulin 

and Patriti, 1996; Bosley et al., 2004; Skliris and Djenidi, 2006). Whether any of this is reflected 

in recent fossil assemblages in canyon sediments is problematic, since high terrigenous 



Coccoliths from recent sediments

sediment input and strong bottom dynamics typical of submarine canyons are expected to dilute 

and disturb the paleoecological signal.  

Here we report the results from a study of recent coccolith assemblages obtained from 92 

surface sediment samples collected from the central Portuguese margin, where two major 

submarine canyons are located: the Nazaré Canyon and Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon. Little is known 

about the effect of physical processes operating in these canyons on the ecology of 

phytoplankton communities in the overlying water masses. Mendes et al. (2011) investigated 

the distribution and composition of phytoplankton assemblages in the Nazaré Canyon during an 

upwelling event, reporting the highest Chl-a concentrations occurring at the canyon head. 

According to these authors, persistently high concentrations of diatoms observed south of the 

canyon apparently reflect the occurrence of intensified upwelling along the southern rim of the 

canyon, extending its influence to the southern shelf, and persisting even during the period of 

relaxation of upwelling winds. The late-winter coccolithophore assemblage thriving in the 

Nazaré Canyon region was recently discussed by Guerreiro et al. (sumitted-a), who 

hypothesized the presence of local diversity and productivity “hotspots” related to the canyon’s 

topography. Emiliania huxleyi, Gephyrocapsa ericsonii, Coronosphaera mediterranea and 

Gephyrocapsa muellerae were the dominant species within the coccolithophore community. 

Gephyrocapsa oceanica was relatively more abundant at the canyon’s head and southern 

adjacent shelf, whereas Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. were consistently thriving 

further offshore at the middle Nazaré Canyon. 

To reveal the (paleo)ecological information contained in calcareous nannoplankton 

assemblages from such a heterogeneous region as the central Portuguese margin, we applied 

multivariate analysis in this study, focusing on the larger and taphonomic-resistant 

coccolithophore species, and including data on sediment characteristics. Our aim is to contribute 

to the knowledge of this phytoplankton group, its distribution offshore central Portugal, and its 

potential as (paleo)ecological and (paleo)oceanographic proxy in the context of submarine 

canyons. 

 

 

4.2. Regional setting 

4.2.1. Central Portuguese margin  

The central Portuguese margin has a relatively narrow shelf (20–50 km wide and a 

gradient of&amp;lt;1°), passing into a steep irregular slope (6–7°) below the shelf-break which is 

located at 160-200 m depth (Figure 4.1). The shelf is composed of thick Cenozoic detritical 

formations, filling structural basins formed during earlier rifting phases. The margin is dissected 

by a number of long submarine canyons, of which the Nazaré and Lisbon-Setúbal canyons are 

the most remarkable (e.g. Vanney and Mougenot, 1981; Mougenot, 1989; Alves et al., 2003). 

Surface sediments on the shelf are generally very coarse and sand-dominated, and include 

old littoral deposits formed during the Holocene transgression preserved at shallow water 



Chapter 4

depths. Finer-grained sediments generally increase with depth on the shelf, but also occur in 

muddy deposits located off the estuaries, in structural depressions at the middle shelf and in the 

canyons upper reaches. Fluvial discharge, coastal erosion and biogenic production are the main 

present day fine sediment sources (Dias, 1987; Van Weering et al., 2002; Oliveira et al., 2002). 

Further down in the continental slope, sediments change from slightly coarser and 

compositionally variable on the upper slope towards more uniform fine-grained and carbonate-

richer hemipelagic muds on the deeper slope (De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011). 

Surface water circulation along the Portuguese margin is directly dependent on two major 

current systems that transport surface water masses from west to east across the Atlantic: the 

North Atlantic Current extending to the north of the Iberian Peninsula, and the Azores Current 

south of Iberia (Saunders, 1982; Pollard and Pu, 1985; Barton, 2001; Peliz et al., 2005). As the 

Azores Current flows eastwards, branches of this current smoothly loop northward into the 

Portugal Current and southward into the Canary Current (Saunders, 1982; Barton, 2001). 

Beneath the near-surface equatorward flow of the Portugal and Canary currents, the Iberian 

Poleward Current (IPC) can be recognized traveling poleward, counter to the general circulation 

and closely bound to the continental slope, its core extending about 300-400 m vertically. This 

current is mostly restricted to the subsurface layers along most of the eastern subtropical gyre, 

but it surfaces whenever the Trade Winds weaken or turn northward (Barton, 2001). 

Circulation over the Portuguese shelf and upper slope displays a marked seasonal 

variation associated with seasonal shifts in the position of the Azores high and Iceland low 

pressure systems (e.g. Haynes et al., 1993; Barton, 2001; Relvas et al., 2007). During summer, 

the Azores high migrates towards the central Atlantic, typically inducing Trade Winds to 

become northerly, inducing an equatorward circulation over the upper 150-200 m of the water 

column off Portugal. Under such conditions, the surface layer of about 30 m thick of relatively 

warmer and lighter water is swept offshore by Ekman transport, allowing colder, less salty and 

nutrient enriched subsurface water to rise to the surface along the coast (e.g. Fiúza, 1983; 

Haynes et al. 1993; Barton, 2001; Relvas et al., 2007; Alvarez et al., 2011). During winter, the 

Iceland low intensifies and the dominant wind regime becomes southerly along the western 

Portuguese margin. This induces the IPC to rise over the upper slope and shelf, where the 

poleward flow produces an onshore Ekman transport, in turn resulting in downwelling 

conditions over the shelf (Fiúza, 1983; Vitorino et al., 2002). River runoff is an important 

feature of the winter circulation over the western Portuguese margin. Important discharge 

particularly from the NW Portuguese rivers (Mondego, Douro, Minho, Lima, Vouga) results in 

the formation of low salinity water lenses in the coastal ocean (Peliz et al., 2005). 

The upper 500 m of water column off Portugal, including the surface mixed layer and the 

first thermocline, is constituted by the Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW). This 

water mass, representing the main source of the nutrient-rich upwelled waters on the Portuguese 

coast, shows considerable variation in its hydrological features as it travels along the coast 

(Fiúza, 1984; McCave and Hall, 2002). The ENACW has two main components of different 

origin, converging to this region: a lighter, relatively warm and salty subtropical branch 

(ENACWst) formed along the Azores Front, which gradually loses its characteristics as it

travels further northwards along the Iberian margin; a less saline colder water mass of subpolar 

origin (ENACWsp) slowly flowing southwards below the poleward subtropical branch, related 

with the Subpolar Mode Water formed in the eastern North Atlantic by winter cooling and deep 

convection (Fiúza et al., 1998). 

Underneath the ENACW a strong salinity gradient is noticed down to the core of the 

Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) lying at ~800–1400 m depths. The warmer and more 

saline MOW was observed interacting intermittently with the slope to acquire a weak turbidity 

of &amp;lt;50 mg/m
3
 due to local resuspension caused by internal wave and slope current activity, 

contributing to load the overlying ENACW at 500–800 m (mixing zone between ENACW and 

MW) (McCave and Hall, 2002). The deeper water masses below the MOW comprise the 

Northeast Atlantic Deep Water (NEADW) below 2000 m, and the Lower Deep Water (LDW) at 

levels&amp;lt;4000 m (Van Aken 2000ab).  

 

 

4.2.2. Submarine canyons 

The Nazaré and Lisbon-Setúbal canyons are the largest submarine canyons of the central 

Portuguese margin, extending from near the shore to abyssal depth, and acting as preferential 

dispersal pathways of particulate matter and attached pollutants from the coast to the deep sea 

(De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011; Richter et al., 2009; Jesus et al., 2010; Martin et al., 2011) (Figure 

4.1).  

The 211 km long Nazaré Canyon cuts across the full width of the Portuguese central 

margin, with its head located at ~50 m water depth and less than 1 km from the shore, and its 

mouth at almost 5 km water depth opening to the Iberian Abyssal plain. Its upper, middle and 

lower courses extend onto ~2000 m, ~4050 m and ~4970 m water depths, respectively (Lastras 

et al., 2009). 

The Nazaré Canyon is presently not connected to a major modern drainage system, and 

obtains its sediment input by capture of particles transported by littoral drift (Duarte et al., 2000) 

and along the shelf (Oliveira et al., 2007; De Stigter et al., 2007). Internal tidal currents actively 

resuspend and transport sediment in the upper and middle canyon, as reflected by high 

concentration of suspended particles in bottom waters, high horizontal and vertical sediment 

fluxes in the bottom water layer, and high sediment accumulation rates on the seabed (De 

Stigter et al., 2007). Intermittent sediment gravity flows transport fine-grained sediment further 

down to the lower canyon, but mass transport of coarser material by high-energy turbidity 

currents, dominant in shaping seabed morphology and sediment deposits of the lower canyon 

reaches (Arzola et al., 2008; Lastras et al., 2009) is rare at present. Resuspension of shelf 

sediments by winter storms and enhanced input of sediments by the flooding of rivers north and 

around the canyon head apparently contribute to trigger sediment gravity flows to the middle 

canyon (Oliveira et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2011; Masson et al., 2011). 

Residual currents above 300 m inside the canyon are well related with the wind regimes 

current in the western Portuguese margin: upwelling-favourable northerly winds over the shelf 



Coccoliths from recent sediments

generate an onshore up-canyon flow, with upwelling occurring near the canyon head, whereas 

downwelling-favourable southerly winds lead the residual flow near or just above the canyon 

rim to become down-canyon. Below 300 m depth, the flow inside the canyon is mostly affected 

by the interaction of the northward flowing MOW with the canyon walls (Tyler et al., 2009). 

The Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon has a more complex morphology, fed by two main branches: 

the E-W oriented Setúbal branch and the N-S trending Lisbon branch. Like the Nazaré Canyon, 

the latter is deeply incised into the continental shelf and slope, and extends down to the abyssal 

plain at depths &gt;4800 m. Different from the Nazaré Canyon, however, the Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon heads, located in somewhat deeper water a few km off the coast, are connected with 

two major river systems, i.e. Tagus and Sado rivers. The Lisbon and Setúbal branches merge at 

2010 m depth, from there the middle course is measured down to the canyon mouth at 4170 m 

water depth, and the lower course extends down to the edge of the Tagus abyssal plain, at ~4860 

m depth (Lastras et al., 2009).  

Recent findings of De Stigter et al. (2011) indicate that the Lisbon Setúbal-Canyon is 

presently nearly inactive in terms of down-canyon sediment transport, probably due to the 

presence of an overall up-canyon direction of net water transport, leading the particles to settle 

in the upper canyon towards the canyon head rather than disperse them down-canyon, and the 

apparent rareness of sediment gravity flows, which in other canyon systems (e.g. Nazaré 

Canyon) are the dominant mechanism of down-canyon dispersal. Fine-grained predominantly 

lithogenic particles from the adjacent shelf areas accumulate in their upper reaches, whereas the 

sediment deposited further down in the middle and lower canyon reaches is essentially 

hemipelagic, similar to the sediment found on the adjacent continental slope.  

 

 

4.3. Material and methods 

4.3.1. Cruises and surface sediment sampling 

Surface sediment cores used in this study were recovered during several cruises with RV 

Pelagia of Royal NIOZ, held in November 2002, October 2003, April/May 2004, May 2005, 

September 2006 and March 2011 in the central Portuguese margin (cruises 64PE204, 64PE218, 

64PE225, 64PE236, 64PE252 and 64PE332, respectively). Coring equipment and methodology 

are described in De Stigter et al. (2007, 2011). Sediment coring was concentrated on six 

transects crossing the central Portuguese margin in an approximately E-W direction: (1) three 

transects covering the Nazaré, Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais canyons; (2) three transects across 

the shelf and open slope off Cape Mondego, Estremadura spur and off Cape Sines. Coring 

positions are shown in Figure 4.1 and listed in the Appendix D.

4.3.2. Laboratory and microscope analysis 

4.3.2.1. Sedimentological analysis  

Sedimentological data presented in this paper have been previously presented and 

discussed by De Stigter et al. (2007, 2011), Jesus et al. (2010) and Costa et al. (2011), with the 

exception of material from Stations PE252-01 to -07 on the shelf and slope region west of Cape 

Mondego, and Stations PE252-40, PE252-43 to -46 and PE252-49 in the Nazaré Canyon and on 

the adjacent middle shelf. Analytical methodology for determining lithogenic material, 

carbonate and organic matter content, particle-size, and sediment accumulation rates, also used 

for analysis of additional cores from stations mentioned above, is described in De Stigter et al. 

(2007, 2011).  

 

 

4.3.2.2. Calcareous nannoplankton 

Calcareous nannoplankton was studied from freeze-dried sediment samples from the top 

0.5 or 1 cm of the collected box- and multicores. Slides were prepared following the random 

settling procedure (Flores and Sierro, 1997) and observed under optical polarizing microscope 

(Olympus BX-40), at 1250× magnification. For coccolith species ? 3µm, a minimum of 300 

individual coccoliths, or nannoliths s.l. (here abbreviated to “nanno”) was counted and 

identified in each slide to determine the species abundances (nanno/g). Florisphaera profunda 

and small placolith taxa Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa ericsonii were counted separately, 

for which approximately ten vision fields were counted to estimate the coccolith concentrations 

of these species. Concentrations were determined according to the following equation: 

 

(1)  
W

1

Oa

Pa

Vp

V
nN ????  

 

Where, N = nanno/g, n = number of counted coccoliths, V = volume within the glass 

bottle (10000 µl), Vp = volume pipetted and injected into the Petri dish, Pa = Petri dish area, Oa 

= observed area (obtained by the number of vision fields, VF, at the microscope, multiplied by 

the unit area correspondent to the microscope; 1 VF Olympus BX-40 = 0.02 mm
2
), and W = 

weight of the sediment sample. The number of coccoliths per gram of sediment will be 

generally termed as “coccolith concentration” throughout the text, to distinguish from the 

“relative abundances” calculated as % relative to total coccoliths. 

To magnify the more robust and larger sized coccolith species and minimize possible bias 

by differential dissolution, small placolith taxa Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa ericsonii 

were ruled out from the (paleo)ecological analysis, and used as a general qualitative indicator 

for the degree of preservation of the observed coccolith assemblages. F. profunda was also 

excluded from the analysis due to difficulties in its identification within highly terrigenous 

sediment samples as those collected from the studied shelf-slope region. 



Coccoliths from recent sediments 

 
131 

 

Nine taxa of coccolithophores were selected for this (paleo)ecological study: Calcidiscus 

leptoporus (Cl), Coccolithus pelagicus s.l. (Cp), Coronosphaera mediterranea (Cm), 

Gephyrocapsa muellerae (Gm), Gephyrocapsa oceanica (Go), Helicosphaera carteri (Hc), 

Umbilicosphaera sibogae, Umbellosphaera irregularis and Rhabdosphaera spp. Due to their 

scarcity and the fact that all the three latter taxa are considered as tracers for the onflow of 

oceanic warmer currents driven along the Azores current onto the Portuguese shelf (Cachão et 

al., 2000) they were grouped into one single taxonomic variable (UUR). Relative abundances 

(%) were determined relative to the sum of the seven taxonomic groups (? 3 µm).  

 

 

4.3.3. Statistical analysis 

A Spearman correlation coefficient matrix was built upon a data matrix with the coccolith 

taxa percentages and depth, distance to coast, total coccoliths per gram, percentage of CaCO3, 

lithogenic material and organic matter, sediment accumulation rate (SAR), median particle-size, 

and percentage of coccoliths with sizes &gt;6 µm, between 5 and 6 µm , and between 5 and 3 µm 

(52 cases). A default p-level of 0.05 was considered. Coccolith size classes were defined on the 

basis of coccolith morphometric measurements earlier performed by Cros (2001) and Narciso et 

al. (2006), such that: size class &gt;6 µm includes the coccolith concentrations of Calcidiscus 

leptoporus, Coccolithus pelagicus and Helicosphaera carteri; size class between 5 and 6 µm 

includes the coccolith concentrations of Gephyrocapsa oceanica and Umbilicosphaera sibogae; 

and finally, size class between 3 and 5 µm includes the coccolith concentrations of 

Coronosphaera mediterranea and Gephyrocapsa muellerae. 

A statistical multivariate analysis (r-mode Factor Analysis by Statistica 10) was 

performed upon a data matrix with the coccolith taxa percentages and the above-mentioned 

environmental variables, and in addition modal sediment particle-size (µm) and molar Corg/Ntot 

ratio, but excluding total coccoliths per gram, SAR and the three size classes of coccoliths (63 

cases). Results from the original data matrix were optimized through Varimax Raw rotation.  

 

 

4.4. Results 

4.4.1. Sedimentary cover in the submarine canyons and adjacent shelf and slope 

Characteristics of superficial sediments from the submarine canyons and adjacent shelf 

and slopes of Estremadura spur and west of Cape Sines were previously presented by De Stigter 

et al. (2007, 2011), Jesus et al. (2010) and Costa et al. (2011), revealing that sediments from the 

canyons significantly differ from those of their adjacent continental margins.  

The most striking sedimentological features evidenced in Figure 4.2 concern the 

differences between the canyons upper reaches and their adjacent coastal regions. Much finer-

grained sediments and higher percentages of lithogenic material and organic matter are recorded 

from the canyons, whereas a relatively more uniform distribution of particle-size is also 



Chapter 4 

132 

 

recorded along their axis, particularly in the Nazaré Canyon. The canyon seabed and lower 

walls were observed to be covered by a superficial layer of mud predominantly composed of 

lithogenic material which, in the case of Nazaré Canyon, extends downwards to its lower 

section (De Stigter et al., 2007). Adjacent to the canyons, the sedimentary cover is much coarser 

near the coast, particularly off Cape Mondego, and abruptly changing into fine-grained 

sediments in the shelf-slope transition. Higher percentages of carbonates and lower percentages 

of organic matter are also noticed in coastal areas adjacent to the canyons (Figure 4.2a-e and 

Table 4.1). Higher molar Corg/Ntot ratios in the canyons indicate a markedly terrestrial origin of 

the organic matter in these regions (Middelburg and Nieuwenhuize, 1998; Alt-Epping et al., 

2007) (Figure 4.2e). Highest SAR’s in the upper and middle canyon reaches (Figure 4.2f) reflect 

their role as morphological traps and temporary depositories of particles in transit along the 

shelf (De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011). The highest SAR’s, molar Corg/Ntot ratios and percentage of 

lithogenic and organic material, were found in the upper reaches of the Nazaré Canyon.  

On the contrary, lower SAR’s were determined for the canyon edges and adjacent margin 

areas. The lowest SAR’s obtained from offshore areas, in the lower canyon reaches and adjacent 

slope areas are most likely overestimated as bioturbation was not taken into account in 

calculation of SAR’s from down-core radio-isotope profiles (De Stigter et al., 2007, 2011). For 

this reason, higher SAR’s from the open slope of Estremadura spur should be carefully 

considered. Low terrigenous input arriving to this region, as testified by the extensive areas of 

rock outcrops, is possibly due to relatively large distance from continent and bypassing of 

lithogenic sediment through canyons north and south of Estremadura Spur (Jesus, 2011).  

The Estremadura spur and region west of Cape Sines reveal slightly coarser sediment 

particle-size and variable composition on the upper slope, changing towards more uniform fine-

grained hemipelagic muds on the deeper slope. Towards the coast sediments off Sines become 

coarser. In terms of bulk composition, sediments off Sines are remarkably uniform with water 

depth and similar to those from the Setúbal and Cascais canyons, whereas the Estremadura 

slope reveals distinctively lower lithogenic and higher carbonate content (De Stigter et al., 2011; 

Jesus, 2011). 

The coarsest sediments of the entire study area were recorded on the shelf and upper 

slope west of Cape Mondego. On the shelf, sediments have slightly higher lithogenic and lower 

carbonate and organic matter content than at comparable depths off Sines. At slope depths, 

sediments off Mondego have similar Corg/Ntot, particle-size and compositional features as those 

from the other slope regions, with lithogenic and carbonate percentages somewhat in between 

those of the Estremadura and Sines slopes. The shelf-slope transition is characterized by a 

noticeable change of the seabed sedimentological features, with the slope recording relatively 

higher percentages of carbonates and organic matter. 

Lower molar Corg/Ntot ratios outside the canyons indicate a generally more marine 

signature of the sediment organic matter in these regions.

4.4.2. Calcareous nannoplankton  

A total of 18 distinct coccolith taxa were recognized using polarizing light microscopy, of 

which only 9 taxa (= 7 taxonomic groups) were selected for this (paleo)ecological study, based 

on their relatively higher coccolith concentrations and coccolith dimension (?3 µm) and 

robustness (see section 3.3.2). Small placolith taxa Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa 

ericsonii were ruled out of the species percentage determinations, whereas their estimated 

coccolith concentrations are here presented as a general indicator of the degree of preservation 

of the coccolith assemblage. The complete list of the observed taxa is presented in Appendix A. 

 

 

4.4.2.1. Coccolith concentrations  

Total coccolith concentrations of species ?3 µm varied between 3×10

nanno/g at the 

shelf of Estremadura Spur and 3×10

 nanno/g at the lower slope off Cape Mondego, with an 

average abundance of 9×10

 nanno/g. Gephyrocapsa muellerae was the most abundant species, 

followed by Calcidiscus leptoporus, Gephyrocapsa oceanica, the taxonomic group composed 

by Umbilicosphaera sibogae, Umbellosphaera irregularis and Rhabdosphaera spp. (UUR), 

Coronosphaera mediterranea, Coccolithus pelagicus and Helicosphaera carteri. Mean and 

maximum coccolith concentrations of each species at the five sectors are indicated in Table 4.1.  

Coccolith concentrations generally decrease towards the coast, except in the upper 

reaches of the canyons where important values are noticed (Figure 4.3a). High concentrations 

were clearly more associated to finer-grained and carbonate-richer sediments further offshore, 

as indicated by the strong negative correlation with sediment particle-size (r
2
 = -0.83) (Figure 

4.3b and Table 4.2) and positive correlation with percentage of CaCO3  (r
2
 = 0.50) bottom depth 

(r
2
 = 0.64) and distance off the coast (r

2
 = 0.56) (see Table 4.2). 

All the taxonomical groups show this distribution trend, particularly clear in the case of 

C. pelagicus, G. muellerae, G. oceanica and UUR. C. mediterranea and H. carteri reveal a 

more irregular W-E distribution, with higher abundances found at intermediate distances to the 

coast (~ between 90-110 and 50 km off the coast), and recording high abundances in the Nazaré 

Canyon. C. leptoporus has a more consistently oceanic distribution, even within the canyons 

(data not shown; Guerreiro et al., submitted-c; Chapter 5). 

Total coccolith concentrations of small placolith species ranged between 2×10

 and 2×10

nanno/g (average 4×10

coccolith concentrations of the two species at the five sectors are indicated in Table 4.1. In 

terms of concentrations, these two species showed a distribution pattern similar to that of larger 

coccolith species (data not shown).

In addition to the coccoliths, 25 intact coccosheres were also observed in the investigated 

sediment samples. The more common species were G. oceanica and G. muellerae, but also G. 

ericsonii, C. pelagicus, Braarudosphaera bigelowi and Rhabdosphaera spp. Most of the 

coccospheres were found in samples from the submarine canyons, particularly the Lisbon-

Setúbal Canyon, at water depths between 179 and 3914 m.

distance to coast and median particle size. 

 

 

4.4.2.2. Coccolith species percentages   

In terms of relative abundance within the group of common larger coccoliths (i.e. 

excluding small placolith species Emilinia huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa ericsonii), G. muellerae 

largely dominates the assemblage in all the studied sectors, at all depths, showing percentages 

between 60 % and 80 % further offshore. Nearer to shore, where relative abundances are lower 

overall except in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyons, the lowest percentages dropping below 40 % 

occur on the Estremadura shelf. Whereas in the upper reaches of the Nazaré Canyon G. 

muellerae recorded relatively lower percentages similar as in the adjacent coastal regions, this 

species revealed distinctly higher abundances in the upper reaches of the Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon, similar to those from further offshore. No correlation was obtained between this 

species percentages and sediment particle-size in the study area, except off Cape Sines where a 

negative correlation is noticed (r
2
 = 0.46) (Figure 4.4d).  

Gephyrocapsa oceanica, the second most abundant species, shows a clearly coastal 

preference in its distribution, with highest relative abundance around 60 % on the Estremadura 

shelf (see the plot on the left side of Figure 4.4e). G. oceanica clearly decreases in offshore 

direction to abundances around 10 %. A basically similar distribution pattern is observed in the 

canyons, whereas the lowest percentages close to the coast were recorded in the Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon. Low correlation was obtained between this species percentages and sediment particle-

size in the canyons and Estremadura open slope (r
2
 &amp;lt;0.15), whereas a positive correlation is 

noticed off Cape Mondego and Cape Sines (r
2
 = 0.73 and r

2 
= 0.45, respectively) (Figure 4.4e).  

Coronosphaera mediterranea and Helicosphaera carteri are also generally more 

abundant closer to shore, the first species reaching particularly high abundances up to 20-25 % 

in the upper Nazaré Canyon. Further offshore, the abundance of both species decreases to less 

than 5 %. Although with considerable variation, abundance of H. carteri in the Nazaré Canyon 

follows a pattern more similar to that from the adjacent shelf and slope. Abundances in the 

Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon are consistently lower, however. No significant correlation was found 

between C. mediterranea and sediment particle-size (r
2
 &amp;lt;0.2), whereas H. carteri reveals a 



Coccoliths from recent sediments 

 
137 

 

clearly positive correlation off Cape Mondego (r
2
 = 0.65) and Cape Sines (r

2
 = 0.75) (Figures 

4.4b and f). 

Calcidiscus leptoporus is consistently more abundant further offshore, particularly on the 

Estremadura spur and west of Cape Mondego (Figure 4.4a). Closer to shore, relative 

abundances are less than 5 %, except in the southern part of the study area in the Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon and Sines shelf where higher abundances are found. Relative abundances in the canyons 

tend to be higher, but show a similar increase in offshore direction. C. leptoporus reveals no 

correlation with sediment particle-size in the study area, except off Cape Mondego where a 

negative correlation is noticed (r
2
 = 0.55).  

UUR are consistently better represented at intermediate distance to shore, generally 

coinciding with upper slope depths. A similar pattern is visible in the canyons. This taxonomic 

group reveals a weak negative correlation with particle-size at the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon (r
2
 = 

0.28) and off Cape Sines (r
2
 = 0.39) (Figure 4.4g).  

C. pelagicus, the least abundant species of those considered, with abundances generally 

below 5%, revealed the weakest coast-ocean gradient in the study area, although this species is 

generally better represented nearer to shore, in the upper canyon reaches and the adjacent shelf 

areas. No significant correlation was obtained between this species percentages and sediment 

particle-size, although a positive correlation is noticed off Cape Sines (r
2
 = 0.86) (Figure 4.4c).  

All the taxa revealed a higher variability of relative abundances in the Nazaré Canyon, i.e. 

both low and high percentages were determined at both shorter and greater distances of the 

coast, particularly from sediments with median particle-sizes between 7 and 20 µm. 

Whereas G. oceanica and C. leptoporus display a rather clear oceanic-coastal gradient at 

both submarine canyons and adjacent regions (increasing and decreasing gradients, 

respectively), other species such as C. mediterranea, H. carteri and G. muellerae display 

different tendencies in and outside the upper canyon reaches. G. muellerae generally decreases 

towards the coast outside the canyons, whereas important percentage values of this species are 

recorded in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon. C. mediterranea stands out for recording much higher 

values in the upper canyon sections, particularly in the Nazaré Canyon, in comparison to the 

adjacent shelf for comparable distances to the coast. Likewise, H. carteri recorded its highest 

percentages in the Nazaré Canyon whereas the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon and Estremadura spur 

recorded its lowest percentage values close to the coast. 

Spearman correlation coefficients generally confirm the distributions described above. 

Significant positive correlations are found between individual coastal-neritic taxa as well as 

between individual oceanic taxa, and negative correlations between coastal and oceanic taxa. 

Each group is clearly associated to a specific environmental setting: the oceanic group is often 

positively correlated with “oceanic factors” such as bottom depth, distance to coast, total 

coccoliths per gram and carbonates, whereas the coastal-neritic group is often positively 

correlated with “continental factors” such as coarser sediment particle-size, lithogenic material 

and high Corg/Ntot ratio (Table 4.2).

which sedimentological data are available were considered in these plots (i.e. stations from the shelf at

Three size classes of coccoliths, i.e. liths 3-5µm, 5-6 µm and &gt; 6 µm, were also included 

in the correlation matrix, to assess possible selective transport according to size. No significant 

correlation was found between different coccolith size classes and sediment particle-size (Table 

4.2).

4.4.3. Multivariate statistical analysis  

Results from factor analysis revealed four distinct factor assemblages explaining 70 % of 

the total variance in the data (Table 4.3). Factor 1 (F1) explains 38 % of total variability, with C. 

leptoporus (Cl), water depth and distance to coast recording the highest (negative) factor 

loadings, in opposition to C. mediterranea (Cm) and G. oceanica (Go) (positive loadings). 

Factor 2 (F2) explains 16 % of total variance and it is represented by sediment particle-size 

(positive loadings) in opposition to organic matter (OM) (negative loadings). Factor 3 (F3) 

explains 9 % of total variance and it is represented by H. carteri (Hc), Cm, Go (C. pelagicus – 

Cp, and OM) (positive loadings) in opposition to G. muellerae (Gm) (negative loadings). Factor 

4 (F4) explains 7 % of total variability and it is represented by CaCO3 and UUR (positive 

loadings) in opposition to Litho, OM and molar Corg/Ntot ratios (negative loadings). 

Samples with F1 positive scores (influenced by the variable cluster Cm and Go) are better 

represented closer to the coastline in all the investigated sectors, particularly in the upper 

reaches of the submarine canyons. Samples with F1 negative scores (influenced by the variable 

cluster Cl, depth and distance to coast) are clearly better represented further offshore. The two 

samples from the lowermost Nazaré Canyon show conspicuously diverging scores on F1 

(Figure 4.5a).  

Samples with F2 positive scores (represented by coarser sediment particle-size) are better 

represented closer to the coastline, on the shelves off Cape Mondego and Cape Sines. Lack of 

sedimentological data from the shelf at Estremadura spur does not allow a comparison for this 

area. Samples with F2 negative scores (represented by OM) are generally better represented 

further offshore on the open slope areas, whereas the canyons and especially Nazaré Canyon 

typically show negative scores on F2 along their entire length (Figure 4.5b). 

Samples with the highest F3 positive scores (represented by the variable cluster Hc, Cm, 

Go, Cp and OM) appear concentrated relatively close to the coast in the upper Nazaré Canyon, 

whereas lower scores without a clear longitudinal or latitudinal separation of positive and 

negative scores is observed in the remaining areas. Samples with F3 negative scores 

(represented by Gm) are preferentially distributed further offshore, except in the upper canyon 

reaches, where this factor becomes more important close to the shore, particularly in the Lisbon-

Setúbal Canyon (Figure 4.5c).  

The distribution of F4 seems to be dominated by the contrast between carbonate-rich 

pelagic sediments characterized by low OM content of marine signature, versus more 

lithogenic-rich sediments characterized by relatively higher OM content with a terrigenous 

signature. Samples with F4 positive scores (represented by the variable cluster CaCO3 and 

UUR) prevail on the Estremadura slope. Samples with F4 negative scores (represented by Litho, 

OM and molar Corg/Ntot) are better represented along the canyons (Figure 4.5d).

4.5. Discussion 

4.5.1. General bottom conditions of the study area 

The central Portuguese margin is a highly heterogeneous region, both topographically and 

in terms of sedimentary cover. The most striking expression of this heterogeneity are the two 

major submarine canyons, Nazaré and Lisbon-Setúbal canyons, which by cutting across the 

continental shelf and slope disturb the prevailing pattern of sediment distribution parallel to the 

isobaths on the shelf and slope.  

Highest sediment accumulation rate, lithogenic and organic matter content and molar 

Corg/Ntot ratios in the upper Nazaré Canyon clearly indicate that this area is presently acting as a 

sediment depocenter within the central Portuguese margin, actively capturing material of 

continental origin (Epping et al., 2002; Oliveira et al., 2007; De Stigter et al., 2007) (Figure 

4.2). The massive occurrence of nepheloid layers in the upper part of the Nazaré Canyon, and 

the very high sediment fluxes to the canyon floor as recorded in sediment traps and in seabed 

deposits, are clear evidence of the present-day activity of this canyon (De Stigter et al., 2007;

Oliveira et al., 2007). Although the Nazaré Canyon head is not presently connected to a major 

drainage system, it is located very close to the coastline (i.e. ~50m water depth; Lastras et al., 

2009) favouring sediment input by capture of particles transported by littoral drift (Duarte et al., 

2000) and along the shelf (De Stigter et al., 2007; Oliveira et al., 2007). Relative homogeneity 

in composition and texture of bottom sediments along the Nazaré Canyon axis reflects the 

active transport of particulate matter along this canyon system (De Stigter et al., 2007). 

Intermittent down-canyon sediment gravity flows were observed redistributing sediments along 

the entire length of the Nazaré Canyon axis (De Stigter et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2011).  

Relatively lower sediment accumulation rate, organic matter content and molar Corg/Ntot 

ratios in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon suggest a lesser sedimentary contribution from the 

continent in comparison to the Nazaré Canyon (Figure 4.2). Although the Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon is connected with two major river basins (i.e. Tagus and Sado rivers), the more distant 

position of the canyon heads relative to the coastline results in a sedimentary regime that is less 

affected by dynamic coastal processes. Although this canyon is effectively trapping sediment in 

its upper reaches, the sediment appears to be mostly derived from vertical flux (De Stigter et al., 

2011).  

A markedly different and more heterogeneous sedimentary signature was recorded in the 

regions adjacent to the canyons. Coarse sediment prevailing on the inner shelf reflects the effect 

of present-day winnowing by waves and currents in the coastal zone, whereas coarse deposits 

further offshore were formed during stages of lower sea level in the past. Finer grained 



Chapter 4

sediments are progressively sorted as they are transported from shallower towards deeper areas. 

Much lower sediment accumulation rates and lack of fine particles closer to the coast most 

likely result from resuspension and remobilization of fines from the shelf during winter storms 

(e.g. Oliveira et al., 2002; Vitorino et al., 2002) (Figure 4.2).  

The shelf west of Cape Mondego has the coarsest bottom sediments of the investigated 

shelf area, reflecting stronger bottom dynamics over this region in comparison to the area west 

of Cape Sines, at comparable distances of the coast. Indeed, the continental margin west of Cape 

Sines reveals a smoother slope gradient, with the 200 m isobath at only ~20 km off the coast, 

leading to a more gradual dissipation of tide and wave energy in this region. On the contrary, 

the much broader and flatter shelf off Cape Mondego changes abruptly into a rather steep slope 

at 150-200 m water depth, less than 65 km of the coast, resulting in a more abrupt transition 

between a shallower coarse-grained sediment domain and a deeper fine-grained sediment 

domain (see Figure 4.1). Lack of sedimentological data from the Estremadura shelf does not 

allow comparing this region with those above. 

Highest percentages of CaCO3 and the lowest molar Corg/Ntot ratios in sediments from the 

slope of Estremadura spur are in good agreement with previous studies reporting the presence of 

a coarse and biogenic shelf sediment cover, with calcite content in the silt-clay fraction reaching 

up to 80 % in the deeper parts of the shelf (Balsinha, 2008). These high carbonate contents 

suggest bypassing of terrigenous sediment entering via the shelf and through the Cascais and 

Nazaré canyons, south and north of the spur (Jesus, 2011). Moreover, the low gradient of the 

shelf and slope at Estremadura spur and great depth of the shelf-break at 330-400 m depth 

apparently cause a build-up of wave energy as waves approach the coast, sweeping an area of 

almost 30 km width and preventing fine sediments to deposit (Balsinha et al., 2012). 

Estremadura spur has also been reported as a hotspot for internal tide generation on the 

Portuguese margin (Quaresma and Pichon, 2011).  

 

 

4.5.2. (Paleo)ecology versus taphonomy  

In the investigated sediment samples, the smaller coccolith species Emiliania huxleyi and 

Gephyrocapsa ericsonii displayed concentration values similar or even higher than those of 

larger coccolith species (?3 µm), providing a general and qualitative indicator that the 

assemblages were not significantly affected by dissolution. The occasional presence of intact 

coccospheres at both shallower and deeper regions (up to 3914 m), even in the context of 

hydrodynamically active systems as the submarine canyons, is an additional indication of the 

good preservation of the sediment coccolith assemblages.  

All the species (both smaller and larger) were more abundant at greater distances off the 

coast and revealing a negative correlation with sediment particle-size and lithogenic material, 

mostly reflecting the important bottom water hydrodynamic control on coccolith accumulation 

in the sediment (data not shown, Guerreiro et al., submitted-c; Chapter 5). Whereas winnowing 

by waves and currents hampers the accumulation of coccoliths in coarse-grained deposits of the 



Coccoliths from recent sediments 

 
145 

 

shelf and upper slope, coccoliths will preferentially accumulate in fine-grained hemipelagic 

deposits that accumulate in more quiescent environments of the middle and lower slope, and the 

canyons (Figure 4.3).  

In the upper slope and shelf regions the highest coccolith concentrations were recorded in 

the southern part of the study area, west of Sines, whereas further offshore, on the open slope, 

highest coccolith concentrations are recorded further north, west of Mondego. 

Highest coccolith concentrations in the southernmost sector of the study area, west of 

Cape Sines, most likely reflect the smoother bottom morphology of this area, leading to a more 

gradual dissipation of tide and wave energy and favouring the settling of coccoliths and their 

integration in the sedimentary record. In turn, lower abundances on the upper-slope and shelf off 

Cape Mondego and Estremadura spur probably reflect strongest bottom hydrodynamics 

prevailing in these regions, already illustrated by their coarser sedimentary cover (see section 

4.5.1). In their earlier study, Abrantes and Moita (1999) also observed higher coccolith 

abundances along the southern and southwestern Portuguese shelf, and lower abundances on the 

northern Portuguese shelf, reflecting distinct bottom morphologies, hydrodynamics and 

depositional conditions prevailing in the two regions. Nevertheless, the presence of more 

persistently productive conditions off Sines, due to its proximity to the upwelling centre of Cape 

S. Vicente, should not be discarded.  

Higher coccolith concentrations of all taxa in the upper canyon reaches, in comparison to 

adjacent coastal regions (data not shown, Guerreiro et al., submitted-c; Chapter 5), reflect the 

role of the canyons as preferential depocenters of suspended fine-grained particles, not only 

terrigenous (e.g. Oliveira et al, 2007; De Stigter et al., 2007), but also biogenic; in this case, 

both derived from coccolithophore productivity in the overlaying photic layer (vertical flux), 

and from lateral transport of resuspended coccoliths. Relatively higher abundances in the upper 

Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon vs. slightly more homogeneous distribution of coccolith abundance 

values along the Nazaré Canyon axis may be related with differences in the sedimentary settings 

between the two canyons as discussed in section 4.5.1: trapping of particles derived from 

vertical flux in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon vs. down-canyon transport by tidal currents and 

sediment gravity flows in the Nazaré Canyon (De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011).  

Dilution of coccoliths with lithogenic material seems less important than the 

hydrodynamic control on the coccoliths deposition, in view of the lack of significant negative 

correlation between coccolith abundance and lithogenic content. Rather, it appears that 

coccoliths are deposited along with the fine sediment fraction, irrespective of whether that is 

derived from land or of marine origin. Results strongly suggest that preferential deposition in 

fine-grained sediments is affecting all the studied taxa equally, and thus coccolith abundances 

relative to dry sediment weight appears unsuitable for investigating species’ ecological inter-

relationships. Species relative abundance (%) within the total of common larger coccoliths will 

be used hereinafter to infer the species’ ecological inter-relationships independently of bottom 

sediment dynamics.

4.5.3. (Paleo)ecological, (paleo)oceanographical and environmental conditions 

The observed coccolith species assemblages generally agree with previous studies 

performed in the Portuguese margin, reflecting the prevailing surface oceanographic circulation 

and the convergence of water masses from both subtropical and temperate regions (e.g. Cachão, 

1993; Guerreiro et al., 2005; 2009). Differences between coastal and oceanic regions, and 

between the submarine canyons and their adjacent margins reflect the important heterogeneity 

of the central Portuguese margin, in terms of coccolithophore ecology, oceanographic and 

sedimentary processes, seabed and coastal topography.  

Results from factor analysis revealed to be statistically significant (i.e. 70 % of explained 

variance) and able to summarize the most striking environmental and (paleo)ecological signals 

preserved in the sedimentary record of the study area (Figure 4.5, Table 4.2).  

The most distinctive (paleo)ecological assemblages recorded in the sedimentary record 

are represented in F1 and F3. F1 represents the coast-to-ocean ecological gradient, with C. 

mediterranea and G. oceanica clearly more abundant closer to the coast, and C. leptoporus 

further offshore (Figure 4.5a). F3 is represented by two distinct coccolith species assemblages; a 

coastal assemblage composed by H. carteri, C. mediterranea, G. oceanica particularly 

important in the Nazaré Canyon, in contrast with G. muellerae which is most common in 

oceanic waters outside the canyons.  

G. muellerae is by far the most abundant coccolith species, dominating the assemblages 

of both coastal and offshore areas in all transects, except on the Estremadura shelf where G. 

oceanica was more abundant. This broad distribution suggests that this species is optimally 

adapted for the environmental conditions of the Portuguese margin. The dominance of G. 

muellerae in sediments from the Portuguese continental shelf has been previously reported by 

Guerreiro et al. (2005, 2009). Outside the canyons G. muellerae is generally found in highest 

relative abundance in more open oceanic environments, whereas lower abundances are found 

closer to the coast (Figures 4.4d and 4.5c). High relative abundances of G. muellerae equal to 

abundances more typically found in the offshore areas are observed in the upper reaches of the 

Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon. Since abundances on the adjacent Sines and Estremadura shelves are 

distinctly lower than in the canyon, the high abundances in this canyon may be interpreted to 

reflect up-canyon displacement of coccoliths derived from the deeper canyon and slope, along 

with the overall up-canyon suspended sediment transport that seems to occur in this canyon (De 

Stigter et al., 2011). Being by far the most abundant species in open slope sediments, any 

resuspension and up-canyon transport of open slope material will result in an increase of G. 

muellerae percentages in the upper canyon. This will, at least partially, mask the “real” 

ecological relationships in this region. On the other hand, given that G. muellerae is the most 

abundant oceanic species, its increase in the middle Nazaré Canyon and upper Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon in comparison to the adjacent regions, could be tracing the preferential onflow of more 

oceanic water masses throughout the canyons, as it has been reported to occur in canyon 

systems (e.g. Skliris and Djenidi, 2006; Guerreiro et al, submitted-a – Chapter 3).  



Coccoliths from recent sediments 

 
147 

 

Consistently higher percentages of coccoliths from C. leptoporus further offshore are 

indicative of its stronger affinity for more oceanic-oligotrophic environments (Figures 4.4a and 

4.5a). Previously, Silva et al. (2008) recognized C. leptoporus as a winter-species in Lisbon bay, 

tracing the advection of subtropical oceanic waters to this region. Guerreiro et al. (submitted-a) 

(see Chapter 3) observed it thriving further offshore in the Nazaré Canyon, during late-winter. 

Also with regards to its larger-scale distribution, C. leptoporus is generally more associated to 

oceanic-oligotrophic environments, preferentially occurring within oceanic gyre centers (Ziveri 

et al., 2004) and revealing an optimal growth under oligotrophic conditions (Sprengel et al., 

2002). That percentages of C. leptoporus are higher on the Sines shelf than on the Estremadura 

and Mondego shelf may reflect a stronger influence of water masses of subtropical origin in the 

southern part of the study area.  

Among the coccoliths showing a preferential near-shore distribution, i.e. G. oceanica, C. 

mediterranea and H. carteri, high percentages of C. mediterranea in the Nazaré Canyon are 

particularly interesting because these are in good agreement with a recent study describing the 

late-winter coccolithophores thriving in this region, where this species was observed to be more 

abundant in the upper canyon and canyon head (Guerreiro et al., submitted-a; Chapter 3) 

(Figures 4.4b and 4.5c). The rapid response of C. mediterranea to nutrient availability was 

recently observed at the shelf-break off Nazaré by Guerreiro et al. (2013) (Chapter 2). Enhanced 

percentages of C. mediterranea in the canyon head, in comparison to the adjacent coastal areas 

seems to genuinely reflect its live distribution in this area, possibly reflecting favourable local 

conditions provided by the canyon near coast.  

Highest percentages of H. carteri recorded in the northern part of the study area agree to 

some extent with previous studies performed on the Portuguese margin, reporting an increase of 

coccoliths from this species in the NW Portuguese shelf (Cachão, 1993; Guerreiro et al., 2005; 

2009). An extremely high percentage of H. carteri (~85 %) was found by Guerreiro et al. (2005) 

in sediments from the mouth of the Douro estuary, interpreted as reflecting an opportunistic 

behaviour possibly related with locally confined nutrient-rich conditions. Moita et al. (2010) 

also observed H. carteri to be more abundant in winter west of the Douro River. The important 

record of H. carteri in the Nazaré Canyon may reflect its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich coastal 

environments. It may also reflect the good preservation of its large-sized and robust coccoliths 

in the dynamic bottom environment of the upper Nazaré Canyon.  

The coastal distribution of coccoliths from G. oceanica in all the five sectors clearly 

confirms its coastal ecological preference off central Portugal. Our results are in agreement with 

earlier studies which identified G. oceanica as a typical coastal coccolithophore, well adapted to 

the nutrient-rich and productive environment found in Portuguese coastal waters (Silva et al., 

2008). It is seen as an indicator for maximum upwelling conditions, showing a quick response 

to nutrient input (Winter et al., 1994; Giraudeau and Bailey, 1995; Broerse et al., 2000; 

Andruleit and Rogalla, 2002; Sprengel et al., 2002; Andruleit et al., 2003; Guerreiro et al., 

2013). The rapid response of this species to favourable nutrient and light conditions was 

recently observed during a late winter coccolith bloom in the Nazaré Canyon area, where G. 



Chapter 4 

148 

oceanica occurred in association with the opportunistic Emiliania huxleyi and small-chain 

diatoms (i.e. Chaetoceros s.l. and Thalassiosira s.l.) which are indicators of the first stage of 

upwelling (Guerreiro et al., 2013 – Chapter 2). Highest percentages of G. oceanica observed on 

the Estremadura shelf are in good agreement with previously reported high coccolith 

concentrations and relative abundances of this species in surface sediments from the shelf south 

of the Nazaré Canyon (Guerreiro et al., 2009). Results agree with previous studies which 

identified the spur as potentially favourable for marine productivity (i.e. Jesus, 2011; Quaresma 

and Pichon, 2011).  

Coccolithus pelagicus and the taxonomical group UUR show weaker coast-ocean trends 

and a weaker signal obtained from factor analysis (Figure 4.4c), possibly reflecting a relatively 

broader range of ecological preferences in comparison to other coccolithophore species clearly 

revealing an oceanic (i.e. C. leptoporus) or coastal affinity (G. oceanica, C. mediterranea, H. 

carteri). For both C. pelagicus and the UUR group there are no noteworthy differences between 

the submarine canyons and the adjacent shelf and slope. C. pelagicus appears weakly correlated 

to the coastal-neritic assemblage from F3 reflecting the preferential coastal distribution of this 

species (Figure 4.5c), which somewhat supports previous studies describing its close relation 

with the Portuguese upwelling system (Cachão and Moita, 2000; Parente et al., 2004; Narciso et 

al., 2006; Silva et al., 2008). On the contrary, UUR are notably more abundant at greater 

distances of the coast, particularly in the southern part of the study area, possibly reflecting the 

stronger influence of ENACWst water masses in this region (Fiúza et al., 1998).  

Differences in the coccolith assemblages between the two upper canyons could reflect 

differences in their environmental settings: (1) a more coastal ecological signature (i.e. C. 

mediterranea, H. carteri, and somewhat G. oceanica) in the Nazaré Canyon head indicating 

higher nutrient availability in this area, resulting from the proximity of the canyon head to the 

coast and the associated intensification of upwelling, and stronger internal tidal activity in the 

upper canyon. This is supported by Chl-a time series recently obtained from satellite data 

revealing that the Nazaré Canyon head is the stage of high productivity throughout the year and 

particularly from March to October, (Guerreiro et al., submitted-a; Chapter 3); and (2) a more 

oceanic ecological signature in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon reflecting more stable and 

oligotrophic conditions in this area resulting from the more distant position of the canyon heads 

relative to coastal dynamics. In addition, as mentioned before, influence from ENACWst is also 

expected to be stronger in the southern part of the study area, and thus, leaving a clearer 

“oceanic ecological imprint” (i.e. C. leptoporus and UUR) in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon. 

F2 and F4 are mostly reflecting the differences in the sedimentary dynamics between the 

submarine canyons and the adjacent shelf and slope regions, already discussed in sections 4.4.1 

and 4.5.1 (Figures 5b,d).  

 

 

 



Coccoliths from recent sediments

4.5.4. Coccoliths as (paleo)ecological proxies in coastal regions  

Linking living coccolithophore communities to the corresponding coccolith assemblages 

preserved in seabed sediments is complex, particularly in dynamic coastal areas and in places 

where the continental margin is dissected by submarine canyons, promoting the interplay of 

continental and marine factors (e.g. Steinmetz, 1994; Roth, 1994). Sediments in such areas 

always contain a cumulative averaged signal composed of the sub-signals from all intervening 

factors, of which only the stronger leave a recognizable “imprint” in the sediment. Our 

challenge consists in finding the best clues that may lead us to a better understanding of the 

more important phenomena. 

Results presented in this study indicate that it is more difficult to make ecological 

inferences based on coccoliths from the sedimentary record of canyons, in comparison to 

adjacent margins. The more mixed assemblages of coccoliths in the canyons, including both 

coastal-neritic and oceanic species, reflects the enhanced exchange of water masses between 

coastal and oceanic regions through the canyons. However, this exchange may on the one hand 

involve the advection of living coccolithophores from oceanic to more coastal areas in the upper 

water masses, whereas on the other hand coccoliths produced by coastal-neritic species in the 

upper canyon reaches may be transported down-canyon by internal tides and turbidity currents 

acting along the bottom of the canyon. In the end, we can only interpret the general 

trends/signals along the canyon by reference to the signal from the surrounding areas (i.e. 

“background”). 

Whereas coccoliths appear to be preferentially included in finer-grained sediments, no 

consistent evidence for selective transport or preservation of individual taxa was found. C. 

leptoporus and H. carteri, two taxa of comparable sizes and comparable degrees of resistance to 

dissolution and physical breakage, revealed clearly distinctive distribution patterns unrelated to 

trends in sediment particle-size. G. oceanica and C. mediterranea, two smaller and more fragile 

coccolith species, are preferably found closer to the coast despite the stronger winnowing and 

destructive mechanical forces in that area.  

Apparent correlations of certain species (e.g. C. leptoporus, H. carteri, G. oceanica and 

C. mediterranea) with particle-size to our understanding are more likely due to parallel trends in 

the distribution of these species and particle-size, than representing a causal relationship. 

Although somewhat diluted, these coast-ocean gradients were also observed in the 

canyons, even in the Nazaré Canyon, where down-canyon transport of suspended particles 

continuously occurs, forced by the canyon internal tide. Moreover, the canyons revealed 

specific features, which are most likely related with the intensified interplay of both sedimentary 

and ecological factors in these areas (i.e. enhanced percentages of G. muellerae in the Lisbon-

Setúbal Canyon head indicating up-canyon transport of resuspended coccoliths and/or 

preferential onflow of oceanic water masses throughout the canyon; and enhanced percentages 

of H. carteri and C. mediterranea in the Nazaré Canyon head indicating dissolution and 

breakage resistance and/or ecological preference for nutrient-rich local conditions in this sector).

4.6. Conclusions 

This study provides new insights into the impact of sea bottom topography and related 

oceanographic circulation on both taphonomy and ecology of coccolithophores, and the role of 

submarine canyons as preferential conduits for the onflow of oceanic water masses into more 

coastal regions, and the down-canyon transport of suspended particles near the bottom.  

The central Portuguese margin represents a highly heterogeneous region, strongly marked 

by the presence of two major submarine canyons, the Nazaré and Lisbon-Setúbal canyons, 

which leave a very distinctive sedimentary and (paleo)ecological signature in seabed sediments 

from this region. 

Remarkably high SAR’s and a predominantly lithogenic, organic-rich and fine-grained 

sedimentary cover clearly distinguishes the canyon’s upper reaches from their adjacent margins. 

Greater longitudinal homogeneity in sediment composition and texture along the canyons, as 

compared to the adjacent shelf and slope areas, reflects their function as preferential conduits 

for the transport of particles towards the oceanic basin.  

Coccoliths produced by calcareous nannoplankton were found to be useful tracers to 

investigate (paleo)ecological and (paleo)oceanographic trends prevailing in the central 

Portuguese margin, supporting previous studies focused on the sedimentary dynamics prevailing 

in the canyons. The increase of coccolith concentrations further offshore is interpreted as 

reflecting the oceanic nature of coccolithophores, coupled with physical sorting resulting in 

preferential accumulation of coccoliths with the finer-grained hemipelagic sediments. Relatively 

higher coccolith abundances of all taxa in the upper canyons, in comparison to their adjacent 

coastal regions, reflect the role of the canyons as preferential depocenters of fine-grained 

sediments, not only terrigenous but also biogenic and including coccoliths derived from local 

production as well as from lateral transport. 

Coccoliths from Coronosphaera mediterranea, Helicosphaera carteri and Gephyrocapsa 

oceanica showed a markedly coastal distribution, revealing to be good (paleo)ecological proxies 

for enhanced productivity in the upper Nazaré Canyon and Estremadura spur. Calcidiscus 

leptoporus was consistently better represented further offshore and appeared to be a good proxy 

for coccolithophore production occurring further offshore. Together with Umbilicosphaera 

sibogae, Umbellosphera irregularis and Rhabdosphaera spp., this species appears to be tracing 

the preferential onflow of ENACWst into the southern part of the central Portuguese shelf. 

Gephyrocapsa muellerae was by far the most abundant species, showing the broadest ecological 

tolerance, but generally more oceanic, particularly outside the canyons. Enhanced percentages 

of this species in the upper Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon may be indicating up-canyon transport of 

resuspended coccoliths from the bottom benthic layer and/or preferential onflow of oceanic 

water masses through the canyon. 

The mix of coccoliths from both coastal-neritic and oceanic species in the canyons 

appears to reflect the enhanced exchange of water masses between more coastal and oceanic 

regions through the canyons, in comparison to the adjacent shelf and slope regions. Highest 

percentages of H. carteri and C. mediterranea in the upper Nazaré Canyon, in comparison to 



Coccoliths from recent sediments 

 
151 

 

the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, may be indicative of differences in the environmental conditions 

between the two canyon systems: greater proximity of the Nazaré Canyon head to the coastline 

results in a stronger influence of coastal dynamics, characterized by more dynamic and nutrient-

rich conditions to which r-selected coccolithophore species are better adapted; on the contrary, 

higher percentages of coccoliths from G. muellerae, C. leptoporus and UUR in the Lisbon-

Setúbal Canyon suggests that a generally more oceanic-pelagic environment prevails in this 

canyon, explained by its greater distance from the coast and present-day lack of down-canyon 

sediment transport.

Abstract  

Submarine canyons are a common feature of most continental margins, and associated 

with them physical forcing mechanisms exist that may provide a nutrient source for local 

phytoplankton development. Phytoplankton assemblages characteristic of the canyon setting 

may be preserved in sediments accumulating within and adjacent to the canyon, but high 

terrigenous sediment input and strong bottom dynamics are expected to significantly dilute and 

disturb the (paleo)ecological signal. The main challenge for paleoenvironmental reconstructions 

consists in extracting the ecological signal from taphonomical distortions, particularly 

intensified in these contexts. 

Coccolith assemblages preserved in 89 superficial sediment samples from the Nazaré and 

Lisbon-Setúbal canyons and adjacent shelf and slope regions off central Portugal were 

investigated. Results from using classical analytical methods, (i.e. coccolith concentrations - 

nanno/g; coccolith fluxes - nanno/cm
2
/yr; and percentages) are compared to results from using 

Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) and further discussed.  

Both coccolith concentrations and fluxes showed spatial trends in which the species’ 

ecological inter-relationships appear to be masked by taphonomical phenomena, especially 

towards the coast and in the canyons. Calculation of species percentages relative to the sum of 

common taxa, eliminating the common sedimentological factors that affect all the taxa equally, 

revealed distinct ecological signals among the studied taxa. In particular the existence of an 

assemblage of coastal-neritic affinity, and another of oceanic affinity. Nevertheless, given the 

spurious correlations and biased statistical analysis associated to percentage determinations, the 

coastal-neritic and oceanic assemblages and their spatial distribution were validated and 

confirmed using CoDA, specifically the isometric log-ratio approach (ilr).  

Providing scale invariance and subcompositional coherence between the components (i.e. 

taxa), CoDA appears to be a robust statistical tool to study the (paleo)ecology of 

coccolithophores, corroborating in the present case results derived from percentage 

determinations. Results clearly confirmed the coastal-neritic distribution of coccoliths from

canyons, reflect their distinct environmental settings. More pronounced mixing of coccoliths 

from both assemblages in the canyons reflect the capacity of these structures in promoting the 

exchange between coastal and oceanic water masses (ecological signal), as well as the role of 

internal tides and sediment gravity flows in disturbing and homogenizing the sedimentary 

record (taphonomical signal). Higher “weight” of the coastal-neritic assemblage in the Nazaré 

Canyon suggests a more dynamic and nutrient-rich environment favourable for coastal 

opportunistic species to develop, whereas the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon appears to exhibit more 

oceanic and stable conditions, probably due to the greater distance of its two canyon heads to 

the dynamic coastal zone.  

Results suggest that the (paleo)ecological signal preserved in the studied sediment 

samples is robust enough to be revealed by the two methods, even within a bottom environment 

as heterogeneous and dynamic as present on the central Portuguese margin. This study 

illustrates the potential of percentages in providing a first indication of the most important 

ecological signals preserved in the sediment and the pointers in which the sequential binary 

partition will be based on, whereas the ilr is fundamental to test and validate such signals, 

assuring that all the available information is extracted from the data and that (paleo)ecological 

interpretations are correctly performed.

5.1. Introduction 

Coccolithophores are the predominant phytoplankton group within calcareous 

nannoplankton, commonly used as (paleo)environmental proxies and markers of oceanographic 

processes (e.g. Ziveri et al., 2004; Silva et al., 2008) due to their exceptional fossil record in 

both open ocean (e.g. Ziveri et al., 2004) and continental shelf/slope sediments (e.g. Cachão and 

Moita, 2000; Guerreiro et al., 2005; submitted-b; Chapter 4). Although affected by various post-

mortem (biostratonomical) mechanisms, studies indicate that coccolith thanatocoenoses 

preserved in surface sediments can be closely related to the coccolithophore communities 

dwelling in the overlaying photic layer (e.g. Abrantes and Moita, 1999; Baumann et al., 2000; 

Kinkel et al., 2000; Sprengel et al., 2002; Boeckel and Bauman, 2008) due to rapid transfer 

mechanisms mediated by zooplankton grazing (Steinmetz, 1994; Balch, 2004). Thereby, 

coccoliths provide a particularly useful calibration link with oceanographic conditions since 

they reflect the physical and ecological patterns that are strong and persistent enough to be 

preserved in the fossil record (Ziveri et al., 2004).  Nevertheless, the correspondence between

157 

the coccolithophore living communities and the coccolith species assemblages preserved in the 

seabed is complex, particularly close to the coast and in the context of a continental margin 

dissected by submarine canyons, where both continental and marine factors interplay. Factors 

that control the sedimentation of coccolithophores and the distribution of coccoliths in recent 

(oceanic) sediments have been earlier discussed by Steinmetz (1994) and Roth (1994).  

Productivity of coccolithophores (P) is primarily a function of light and nutrients, 

modulated by hydrological parameters like temperature, salinity, turbulence and turbidity (see 

Margalef, 1978). Seasonal variability in controlling parameters results in successions of 

seasonally distinct coccolithophore biocoenoses. The coccolith fossil record (FR) preserved in 

the seafloor sediment results from this primary signal, further affected by several processes here 

categorized in necrolysis (N), biostratonomy (B), variations in the sediment accumulation rate 

(SAR), sediment mixing mostly driven from bioturbation (M) and diagenesis (D), all 

taphonomical phenomena that act upon the coccospheres/coccoliths (Figure 5.1). In other 

words, whereas a certain P represents the cumulative coccolithophore production of a certain 

region of the ocean, FR is the cumulative average over several months, years, decades, centuries 

or even thousands of years of continuous productivity, more or less distorted by taphonomy. For 

each sampling point, FR can be conceptually represented as follows (equation 1): 

 

    ?    (  )
 
        (  )   (  )   (  )                                                    (1) 

 

where ti = 1, 2,…, n is time, and PE = (paleo)ecological record, referring to the most recent 

coccoliths deposited on the seafloorbut prior to burial, i.e. coccolith thanatocoenosis. PE can be 

considered as the summation of three major components: one here called “weak” ecological 

signal (PEw), a “strong” ecological signal (PEs) and a third component of biostratonomical 

nature (PE’) (equation 2): 

 

PE = PEw + PEs + PE’                                                                                     (2) 

 

PEw represents the ecological component that derives from continuous production of 

coccolithophores (P1) and results from isolated cell lysis (N1) and/or coccolith dispersion and 

sinking (B1) through the water column (equation 3).  

 

PEw = P1 × N1 × B1                                                                                         (3) 

 

Due to their minute dimensions, isolated coccospheres/coccoliths can stay suspended in 

the water column over extended periods of time, eventually becoming dispersed or even 

dissolved before reaching the bottom (Roth, 1994; Steinmetz, 1994). For this reason, PEw is 

considered negligible in terms of contribution to the (paleo)ecological record and thus will not 

be further considered. 

PEs is the stronger ecological signal i.e. able to introduce changes in species inter-

relationships in the sedimentary record, controlled by coccolithophore blooms (P2) triggering 



Chapter 5 

 

158 

zooplankton grazing (N2), in turn resulting in the incorporation of large amounts of 

coccospheres in faecal pellets, which are rapidly transported towards the bottom (B2) (equation 

4): 

PEs = P2 × N2 × B2                                                                                         (4) 

 

Vertical transport inside faecal pellets is considered the most efficient mechanism for 

coccoliths to be transferred to the bottom (Steinmetz, 1994). Assuming that zooplankton and 

nekton are not selective for minute coccolithophore cells, grazing provides a mechanism to 

efficiently sample coccolithophore assemblages from the upper part of the water column, and 

packaged in faecal pellets rapidly transferring them to the seafloor, thus contributing to 

formation of the sedimentary record. Given that biological breakage and dissolution due to 

grazing probably represent an important alteration factor (Harris, 1994), only the 

coccolithophores which were incorporated without total destruction into fast sinking faecal 

pellets or marine snow aggregates are likely to be preserved (Honjo, 1976; 1980). 

Finally, PE’ represents allochtonous coccolithophore productivity, i.e. advected from 

adjacent water masses. According to Ziveri et al. (2004), a sediment sample may include 

coccoliths produced within a geographical area of at least 100 km
2
, with lateral transport leading 

to the eventual loss of the smaller and most delicate species. PE’ can also incorporate reworked 

fossil or subfossil specimens resuspended from the bottom of continental shelf and slope 

regions. PE’ is particularly important where the continental margin is dissected by submarine 

canyons, given that these are regions of intensified sedimentary dynamics (i.e. coastal 

dynamics, internal tides, gravity flows; Arzola et al., 2008; De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011). 

In equation 2, SAR represents the effect of dilution of the coccolith thanatocoenosis with 

other sedimentary material (including reworked coccoliths) whereas M represents mixing by 

organisms living in the benthic sediment layer, both occurring at the seafloor, the latter of which 

resulting in more or less homogenised coccolith taphocoenoses. After burial, the latter 

association will be further subjected to diagenesis (D) occurring on longer time scales (i.e. 

centuries, thousands or millions of years). Processes such as dissolution and recrystallization 

will tend to preferentially eliminate the smaller and more delicate forms while favouring the 

preservation of the larger and more robust ones, resulting in an orictocoenosis only partially 

representing the original assemblage. 

In conclusion, all these phenomena are represented, for each sampling point, as follows 

(equation 5): 

 

    ? (        (  )     (  ))     (  )   (  )                                            (5) 

 

PEs is the ecological term that should be extracted from the fossil record, in order to make 

ecological and subsequent oceanographic inferences. To extract PEs from FR, the effects of 

advection and reworking (PE’), variations in sedimentation (SAR) and diagenesis (D) must be 

removed.  



(CoDA) as a tool to study the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores 

 

159 

Distortions induced by D can be significantly reduced by: (1) studying Upper Holocene 

sediment records for which diagenesis can be assumed to be negligible; or (2) selecting species 

with a similar degree of resistance to dissolution/recrystallization. The (paleo)ecological signal 

within the thus reconstructed taphocoenosis is now only affected by the biostratonomical 

advective and reworked components (PE’) and variations on SAR.  

 

Figure 5.1 - Schematic representation of the principal factors that affect the coccolithophore assemblage 

from the moment of its production (biocoenosis) on the oceanic photic layer towards the moment of its 

burial (thanatocoenosis -&gt; taphocoenosis-&gt; orictocoenosis). P2 = productivity resulting from 

coccolithophore blooms, N2 = necrolysis mediated by zooplankton grazing, B2 = rapid vertical transfer of 

coccospheres within fecal pellets produced by zooplankton, PEs = Strong ecological signal, PE’ = 

advected and resuspended coccoliths by oceanic currents and bottom resuspension within the bottom 

nepheloid layer (BNL), SAR = sediment accumulation rate, and D = diagenetic phenomena (e.g. 

dissolution, recrystallization). The conical shape is meant to schematically represent the area of 

production (P2) and transport (B2 and PE’) from which a coccolith assemblage preserved in a seafloor 

sediment sample may be derived. 

 

In the context of a continental margin, the species concentrations (i.e. number of 

coccoliths per gram of sediment) computed from the taphocoenosis is highly dependent on 

SAR, which will distort the original thanatocoenosis. Determining the coccolith fluxes 

(nanno/cm
2
/yr) from a constant sedimentation rate may eliminate this problem. However, 

current radiometric methods commonly used for determining sediment accumulation rates in 



Chapter 5 

 

160 

continental margin settings provide only averages over decadal to centennial periods of time, 

lacking desired finer resolution. In addition to that, effects of bioturbation can often not be 

accounted for in the calculation of sediment accumulation rate, leading to considerable errors 

especially in slowly-accumulating sediments from open continental slopes (see Carpenter et al., 

1982; Fuller et al., 1999; Boer et al., 2006). 

On the other hand, in regions of high SAR’s such as submarine canyons (De Stigter et al., 

2007; 2011) coccolith fluxes derived from present day productivity (i.e. PEs) end up mixed with 

resuspended/reworked coccoliths (PE’), due to the fact that these major submarine valleys often 

act as morphological traps for fine particles in transit along the shelf. 

Determining species relative abundance in percentage relative to the sum of total or 

selected common coccoliths is a standard analytical procedure to eliminate the effect of the 

(common) factors that indiscriminately act upon P, thus allowing to infer species’ ecological 

inter-relationships independently of sediment dilution effects and/or effects of bottom dynamics. 

It is thereby assumed that all taphonomical processes affect all coccolithophore species of 

similar size (? 3µm) equally. This way, only the original PEs and PE’ signals will remain.  

Nevertheless, the closure problem and the inconsistency of determining percentages may 

lead to spurious correlations and biased statistical analysis; according to Pawlowsky-Glahn and 

Egozcue (2006), using percentage values leads to inconsistent and spurious relations between 

the parts and, thus, to potentially unrealistic interpretations (i.e. changing the number of 

components leads to different relationships among them). There are cases where it is possible to 

obtain similar results, especially when the sub-compositions are nearly constant/homogeneous, 

although one cannot assure that it will be so in advance.  

Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) (Buccianti and Esposito, 2004; Pawlowsky-Glahn 

and Egozcue, 2006) was designed to provide robust results, since the inferences made on the 

coccoliths assemblage is based on a theoretical approach that provides tools that allow to extract 

relative information while satisfying scale invariance, subcompositional coherence and 

permutation invariance. By implementing the use of isometric log-ratios, CoDA makes the 

treatment of two variables, or groups of variables, symmetric, given that Log (x/y) = - Log 

(y/x). Such symmetry is essential to avoid spurious correlations by giving them 

subcompositional coherence, and thus leading to more reliable comparisons and interpretations.  

Here, CoDA is applied to study the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores from the central 

Portuguese margin. The isometric log-ratio (ilr) approach was applied to previously reported 

coccolith assemblage data from superficial sediments collected along the Nazaré and Lisbon-

Setúbal canyons and adjacent shelf and slope regions (Guerreiro et al., submitted-b; Chapter 4), 

to validate the robustness of ecological inferences based on percentages. The goals of the 

present work are: (1) to confirm the effect of submarine canyons on the (paleo)ecology of 

coccolithophores, (2) to extract the ecological signal, independent from the intensified 

taphonomical effects in these regions (i.e. PE’ and SAR), and (3) to introduce the isometric log-

ratio as a procedure to validate and obtain consistent (paleo)ecological interpretations. Results 

obtained from both compositional (CODA) and classical approaches are compared and 

discussed.

5.2. General principles behind Compositional Data Analysis 

Compositional data are data in which the components represent “parts of a whole”. They 

carry only relative information between parts, and are usually represented as percentages or 

ppm; in this case, their sum corresponds to a constant, typically 100% or 10
6
 (Parent et al., 

2012). Because of this, compositional data are an easy target of spurious correlations and 

subcompositional incoherence that typically affect all data that measures parts of the same 

whole. An example: considering an ecological subsystem composed of a few selected species 

(sp1, sp2, sp3,…) the behaviour of any two components will randomly change their signs and 

meanings depending on the other components involved, leading to the so-called “spurious 

correlation problem” or subcompositional incoherence (Pearson, 1897; Tolosana-Delgado, 

2012; Buccianti, 2013). Ideally, results should not depend on whether we take one, some, or all 

of our components or species, neither on whether we scale them up and down by arbitrary 

numbers, nor even whether we choose our samples to sum up to 100% or leave them untouched 

(Aitchison, 1997). To avoid these problems, a “scale or scaling invariance” property should be 

inherent to the methods applied when studying compositional data. Such property is assured by 

using the ratios between the components instead of their individual variation, based on the 

premise that one cannot assess absolute increase or decrease of the components, but only 

relative changes (Aitchison et al., 2000). 

Despite these facts, most of the quantitative analyses performed by geoscientists all over 

the world do not take into account the particular features of compositional data. Although 

similar results may be achieved from both classical and compositional approaches, depending 

on where the data are located within the sample space or simplex (i.e. if they are close to the 

centre or to the borders), it is up to now not possible to know the weight of this effect a priori, 

or how to measure it. Therefore, part of the information about compositional natural systems 

may become completely lost or misunderstood (Buccianti, 2013). 

Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) is a set of statistical tools and geometric concepts 

built with the purpose of allowing results to satisfy scale invariance and subcompositional 

coherence, based on the idea that we can only assess relative changes between components 

(Aitchison, 1997). It requires transformation of compositional data located in the constrained 

space (the simplex) before performing statistical analysis, in order to move them into real space, 

thus allowing the inference about the sample features, from which the data are drawn, to be 

consistently performed from a theoretical point of view (Aitchison, 1982; Buccianti and 

Esposito, 2004). By avoiding spurious correlations and negative bias, the log-ratio approach 

permits obtaining an exhaustive understanding on how natural phenomena work, and to extract 

all the information contained in data variability (Buccianti, 2013). 

Given the Euclidean space nature of the simplex (Pawlowsky-Glahn and Egozcue, 2001), 

representing compositions by their coordinates in the simplex has an enormous potential.  A 

suitable orthonormal basis for this purpose is obtained through an isometric log-ratio 

transformation (Egozcue et al., 2003). The advantage of such a transformation is that, as a result 



Chapter 5 

 

162 

of orthogonality, the original information is preserved (Parent et al., 2012), i.e. the distance 

between two observations before and after the transformation is the same. 

To obtain an interpretable isometric transformation and provide the geometry required to 

analyse data in Euclidean space, Egozcue et al. (2003) and Egozcue and Pawlowsky-Glahn 

(2005a) arranged the D parts of a composition in a D-1 sequential binary partition (SBP), which 

leads to an orthonormal basis. A SBP is a hierarchical grouping of parts of the original 

compositional vector, starting with the whole composition as a group and ending with each part 

in a single group (Egozcue and Pawlowsky-Glahn, 2005a). This partition can be selected by the 

user in order to enable the best interpretation of the results when some kind of relation between 

parts is a priori known or preferred (Thió-Henestrosa et al., 2008). The D-1 isometric log-ratio 

(ilr) coordinates are data transformations mapped according to the SBP and computed as 

contrasts/balances between two groups (tagged with + and – signals) (Parent et al., 2012). Such 

balances reflect the relative variation of two groups of parts, i.e. the isometric log-ratios of 

geometric means of groups of parts (see Egozcue and Pawlowsky-Glahn, 2005a). 

The balance-dendrogram is a new methodology within CoDA aimed to explore and 

describe compositional data in a coherent geometry, particularly useful to summarize and to 

graphically describe a composition of many parts. It allows the visualization of the partition 

used and, for each balance, the sample mean or centre, the proportion of the sample total 

variance corresponding to it, and summary statistics represented by the boxplot of percentiles 5, 

25, 50, 75 and 95 (see Thió-Henestrosa et al., 2008). A more complete description of the 

elements of the balance-dendrogram is presented by Egozcue and Pawlowsky-Glahn (2005b) 

and Thió-Henestrosa et al. (2008). 

 

 

5.3. Regional setting 

The central Portuguese margin has a relatively narrow shelf (20–50 km wide and a 

gradient of&amp;lt;1°), passing into a steep irregular slope (6–7°) below the shelf-break which is 

located at 160-200 m depth. The shelf is composed of thick Cenozoic carbonate and detritic 

formations, filling structural basins formed during earlier rifting phases. The margin is dissected 

by a number of long submarine canyons, of which the Nazaré and Setúbal–Lisbon canyons are 

the most remarkable (e.g. Vanney and Mougenot, 1981; Mougenot, 1989; Alves et al., 2003) 

(Figure 5.2). 

The Nazaré Canyon stands out for being one of the largest and steepest canyons of the 

European margin, cutting across the full width of the Portuguese central margin almost to the 

coastline. The canyon starts at ~50 m water depth and within 1 km from Nazaré Bay, and 

extends to the Iberian Abyssal plain, 211 km off the canyon head. This canyon is presently not 

connected to a major modern drainage system, and obtains its sediment input by capture of 

particles transported by littoral drift (Duarte et al., 2000) and along the shelf (Oliveira et al., 

2007; De Stigter et al., 2007). Tidal currents actively resuspend and transport sediment in the 

upper-middle canyon, as reflected by high concentrations of suspended particles in bottom 



(CoDA) as a tool to study the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores 

 

163 

waters, high horizontal and vertical sediment fluxes in the bottom water layer, and high 

sediment accumulation rates on the seabed (De Stigter et al., 2007). Sediment accumulated in 

the canyon head and upper section is remobilized and flushed to its lower section and adjacent 

abyssal plain by intermittent sediment gravity flows occurring mostly during autumn and winter 

months (De Stigter et al., 2007; Martín et al., 2011; Masson et al., 2011).  

The Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon has a more complex morphology, fed by two main branches: 

the E-W oriented Setúbal branch and the N-S trending Lisbon branch. Like the Nazaré Canyon, 

the latter is deeply incised into the continental shelf and slope, and extends down to the abyssal 

plain at depths &gt; 4800 m. Different from the Nazaré Canyon, however, the Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon heads, located in somewhat deeper water  a few km off the coast, are connected with 

two major river systems, i.e. Tagus and Sado rivers (at 120 and 90 m depth, and at 20 and 13 

km off the river mouths, for the Lisbon and Setúbal branches, respectively (see Lastras et al., 

2009). Recent findings of De Stigter et al. (2011) indicate that the Lisbon Setúbal-Canyon is 

presently nearly inactive in terms of down-canyon sediment transport, probably due to the 

presence of an overall up-canyon direction of net water transport, leading the particles to settle 

in the upper canyon towards the canyon head rather than disperse them down-canyon, and the 

apparent rareness of sediment gravity flows, which in other canyon systems (e.g. Nazaré 

Canyon) are the dominant mechanism of down-canyon dispersal. Fine-grained predominantly 

lithogenic particles from the adjacent shelf areas accumulate in their upper reaches, whereas the 

sediment deposited further down in the middle and lower canyon reaches is essentially 

hemipelagic, similar to the sediment found on the adjacent continental slope.  

Circulation over the Portuguese shelf and upper slope displays a marked seasonal 

variation associated with seasonal shifts in the position of the Azores high and Iceland low 

pressure systems (e.g. Haynes et al., 1993; Barton, 2001; Relvas et al., 2007). During summer, 

the Azores high migrates towards the central Atlantic, typically inducing Trade Winds to 

become northerly, inducing an equatorward circulation over the upper 150-200 m of the water 

column off Portugal. Under such conditions, the surface layer of about 30 m thick of relatively 

warmer and lighter water is swept offshore by Ekman transport, allowing colder, less salty and 

nutrient enriched subsurface water to rise to the surface along the coast (e.g. Fiúza, 1983; 

Haynes et al. 1993; Barton, 2001; Relvas et al., 2007; Alvarez et al., 2011). During winter, the 

Iceland low intensifies and the dominant wind regime becomes southerly along the western 

Portuguese margin. This induces the IPC to rise over the upper slope and shelf, where the 

poleward flow produces an onshore Ekman transport, in turn resulting in downwelling 

conditions over the shelf (Fiúza, 1983; Vitorino et al., 2002).  

The upper 500 m of water column off Portugal, including the surface mixed layer and the 

first thermocline, is constituted by the Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW). This 

water mass, representing the main source of nutrient-rich waters upwelling along the Portuguese 

coast, shows considerable variation in its hydrological features as it travels along the coast 

(Fiúza, 1984; McCave and Hall, 2002). The ENACW has two main components of different 

origin, converging to this region: a lighter, relatively warm and salty subtropical branch 

(ENACWst) formed along the Azores Front, which gradually loses its characteristics as it 



Chapter 5 

 

164 

travels further northwards along the Iberian margin; a less saline colder water mass of subpolar 

origin (ENACWsp) slowly flowing southwards below the poleward subtropical branch, related 

with the Subpolar Mode Water formed in the eastern North Atlantic by winter cooling and deep 

convection (Fiúza et al., 1998).

5.4. Material and Methodology 

5.4.1. Cruises and surface sediment sampling 

The sediment samples used in this study were recovered during several cruises with RV 

Pelagia of Royal NIOZ, held in November 2002, October 2003, April/May 2004, May 2005, 

September 2006 and March 2011 in the central Portuguese margin (cruises 64PE204, 64PE218, 

64PE225, 64PE236, 64PE252 and 64PE332, respectively). 

Surface samples were collected with equipment and methodology as described in De 

Stigter et al. (2007, 2011). Samples corresponding to the top 0.5 or 1 cm of box- and multicores 

were sub-sampled and analysed to determine the recent coccolith assemblages. Sediment coring 

was concentrated on six transects crossing the central Portuguese margin in an approximately E-

W direction, aiming to represent the gradients coast versus ocean and canyons versus adjacent 

shelf and slope: (1) three transects along the axis of the Nazaré, Lisbon-Setúbal and Cascais 

canyons; (2) three transects covering the shelf and open continental slope off Cape Mondego, 

Estremadura spur and off Cape Sines. Coring positions are shown in Figure 5.2 and listed in 

Appendix D. 

 

 

5.4.2. Laboratory and microscope analysis 

For the study of the fossil record of coccolithophores, 89 surface sediment samples were 

analysed. Slides were prepared following the random settling procedure (Flores and Sierro, 

1997) and observed under optical polarizing microscope (Olympus BX-40), at 1250× 

magnification. A minimum of 300 individual coccoliths (i.e. “nanno” for short) was counted 

and identified in each slide to determine their concentration (nanno/g), according to the 

following equation:

where, N = nanno/g, n = number of counted coccoliths, V = volume within the glass bottle 

(10000 µl), Vp = volume pipetted and injected into the Petri dish, Pa = Petri dish area, Oa = 

observed area (obtained by the number of vision fields, VF, at the microscope, multiplied by the 

unit area corresponding to the microscope; 1 VF Olympus BX-40 = 0.02 mm

), and W = weight 

of the sediment sample. The numbers of coccoliths per gram of sediment will be generally 

referred to as “coccolith concentrations” throughout the text, to distinguish them from the 

“relative abundances” calculated relative to the sum of common coccoliths. 

At each sampling point, coccolith fluxes (nanno/cm
2
/yr) were determined by multiplying 

the coccolith concentrations by sediment accumulation rates (SAR), previously calculated from 

sediment profiles of

Pb (22.2 years half-life (De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011; Guerreiro et al.,

To minimize effects of differential dissolution, only the larger and more robust taxa (? 3 

µm) were considered. Nine coccolithophore taxa were selected for this study: Calcidiscus 

leptoporus (Cl), Coronosphaera mediterranea (Cm), Coccolithus pelagicus s.l. (Cp), 

Gephyrocapsa muellerae (Gm), Gephyrocapsa oceanica (Go), Helicosphaera carteri (Hc), 

Umbilicosphaera sibogae, Umbellosphaera irregularis and Rhabdosphaera spp. Due to their 

scarcity and the fact that all the three latter taxa are considered as tracers for the onflow of 

oceanic warmer currents driven along the Azores current onto the Portuguese shelf (Cachão et 

al., 2000) they were grouped into one single taxonomic variable (UUR). Relative abundances 

(%) were determined relative to the sum of the seven taxonomic groups (? 3 µm). 

 

 

5.4.3. Statistical analysis: compositional and classical approaches 

The isometric log-ratios (ilr) (Egozcue et al., 2003) were determined from the coccolith 

concentrations (nanno/g) and made by taking rigorously into account the sample space of 

compositional data (i.e. data matrices whose rows sum to 100%). Six compositional balances 

(?) were determined by applying a sequential binary partition (SBP) to the seven taxonomic 

groups, based on our pre-acquired knowledge of their ecological preferences and on the results 

from percentages (e.g. Winter et al., 1994; Cachão and Moita, 2000; Cachão et al., 2000; Silva 

et al., 2008; Guerreiro et al., submitted-b, Chapter 4), determined according to: ? 7 taxa (%) = 

Cl (%) + Cm (%) + Cp (%) + Gm (%) + Go (%) + Hc (%) + UUR (%) = 100 %. The SBP was 

performed by taking the whole group (7 taxa) and dividing it into two groups (here 4 neritic-

coastal taxa vs. 3 oceanic taxa). The resulting balance (?1) reflects the (geometric) mean 

behaviour of the first group vs. the (geometric) mean behaviour of the second group. Each 

group was subsequently divided again until each group was represented by one single species 

(see Table 5.1).

The balance-dendrogram representing the six isometric log-ratios was automatically 

obtained using CoDAPACK software (Version 2.01.13) and calculated according to the 

following equations, where ln stands for the natural logarithm, or logarithm to the base e:   

A priori it is assumed that the largest compositional changes occur along a coast to ocean 

gradient, and thus, the coccolith concentrations, fluxes and percentages of each taxonomic 

group, and the ilr’s of each compositional balance, were plotted against distance to the coastline 

(expressed in km) and compared. Boxplots representing the distribution of the isometric log-

ratios (ilr) in water depth (m) were also built for the five studied sectors. 

 

5.5. Results  

5.5.1. Classical approaches: nanno/g, coccolith fluxes and percentages  

Data of coccolith total counts, concentrations (nanno/g), fluxes (nanno/cm
2
/yr) and 

relative abundances (%) determined from the studied sediment samples are listed in the 

Appendix D. With the exception of the coccolith fluxes, results presented in this section have 

been previously discussed in Guerreiro et al. (submitted-b) (see Chapter 4) and, therefore, only a 

general overview of the coast to ocean distribution of coccolith species is shown.  

A general decrease of coccolith concentrations (nanno/g) towards the coastline is visible 

from the plots of the seven taxonomic groups, especially in the case of Cl. Such W–E 

decreasing gradient is particularly evident along the ocean-coast transects adjacent to the 

submarine canyons, whereas all taxa display higher nanno/g values in the upper sections of the 

canyons in comparison to the adjacent coastal regions, particularly in the upper Lisbon-Setúbal 

Canyon (Figure 5.3).  

Coccolith fluxes (nanno/cm
2
/yr) determined from SAR’s were highest at the central part 

of the investigated region, with a maximum value in the Nazaré Canyon head, where several 

coccolith species recorded a peak in flux. Indeed, a clear distinction between the submarine 

canyons and the adjacent coastal regions is noticed close to coast: higher coccolith fluxes are 

recorded in the upper reaches of the canyons, particularly in the Nazaré Canyon, whereas rather 

low fluxes are noticed in the adjacent regions, for comparable distances to the coast. Cp, Gm, 

Go and Hc recorded their highest coccolith fluxes in the upper reaches of the canyons, 

particularly in the Nazaré Canyon (Figures 5.3c-f). Cl and UUR recorded similar values of 

coccolith fluxes in both studied canyons (Figure 5.3a, g). Further offshore, generally low 

coccolith fluxes were obtained, except on the open slope of Estremadura spur. Most of the 

species recorded an increase of coccolith flux in this region, but it was most pronounced for the 

oceanic taxa Cl, Gm and UUR (Figures 5.3a, d, g). 

Species relative abundances also show a clear W-E gradient, in this case revealing 

differences among the taxa. An increase in percentage of the neritic-coastal species Cm, Go and 

Hc towards the coast is clearly recorded, with Cm and Hc clearly more abundant in Nazaré

 whereas Go is more abundant on the Estremadura shelf. Cp also reveals this general trend 

although weaker than the previously mentioned species. Cl displays the opposite spatial 

distribution, clearly increasing further offshore. Relatively higher percentages of this species are 

noticed at Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon. Gm and UUR display the same general decreasing trend 

towards the coast, although less distinctive than in Cl. Gm has markedly higher relative 

abundances in the upper reaches of the canyons in comparison to the adjacent shelf and coast, 

particularly in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon. Higher proportions of coccoliths from oceanic taxa 

are noticed at the upper Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, whereas the coccoliths from coastal-neritic 

species are better represented at the upper Nazaré Canyon (Figure 5.3). 

 

 

5.5.2. CoDA: isometric log-ratios (ilr)  

The dendrogram represented in Figure 5.4 gives information about the relative 

importance of each (paleo)ecological assemblage (oceanic vs. coastal-neritic) within the 

investigated sectors. Each balance (?) is represented by a black vertical "arm", the length of 

which is proportional to the variance explained by the balance, if all the samples are considered 

together, i.e. as one unique sample. The relative weight of each (paleo)ecological signature in 

the different sub-groups of samples (i.e. investigated sectors) is given by the horizontal distance 

between the box plot and the black vertical "arm" corresponding to the centre of the balance, i.e. 

the shorter it is towards the centre of the balance, the heavier is its geometric mean in the data 

set. It means that the geometric mean weighs more in that specific group of samples.  

Each sector (assumed to be well represented by a group of samples) is illustrated by a box 

plot and a "vertical arm" with the same colour, the length of both giving information about the 

compositional variability (i.e. &gt; length = &gt; variability). The position of the vertical "arm" in the 

box plot indicates the mean of the balance in that specific sector. The performed SBP, the mean 

and variance of each extracted isometric log-ratio (i.e. balance) is represented in Table 5.1. The 

ilr’s obtained for each sediment sample are listed in the Appendix D. 

The most striking differences between the five sectors shown in the dendrogram are given 

by ?1, which discriminates the coastal-neritic from the oceanic taxa, i.e. ?1 represents the 

(geometric) mean behaviour of the neritic-coastal group (Cm, Hc, Go and Cp) vs. the 

(geometric) mean behaviour of the oceanic group (Gm, UUR and Cl). This first balance 

indicates that the oceanic taxa have a higher weight on the studied dataset, as revealed by the 

relatively shorter “horizontal left arm” compared to the corresponding horizontal right arm, i.e. 

the vertical arms are globally positioned closer to the oceanic group.  

When comparing the five sectors, the graph clearly shows the relatively stronger relation 

of the canyons with the coastal-neritic species, as indicated by the median of their boxplots 

which is relatively displaced towards the right side of the dendrogram, particularly in the case of 

Nazaré Canyon. On the contrary, for the shelf and slope regions the median coccolith abundance 

is displaced toward the left side of the dendrogram, meaning that in these sectors the oceanic 

assemblage has a higher weight. The region west of Cape Sines appears as the most strongly

related with the oceanic coccolith assemblage, whereas the shelf and slope regions west of Cape 

Mondego and Estremadura spur reveal stronger mixing of coccoliths from both oceanic and 

coastal-neritic taxa. 

When comparing among coastal-neritic species (?2, ?3 and ?4) and among oceanic taxa 

(?5 and ?6), no significant differences between the investigated sectors are noticed. The Nazaré 

Canyon and the region west of Cape Sines reveal a slightly higher “weight” of coccoliths from 

Cm and Hc, whereas the regions west of Cape Mondego, Estremadura spur and the Lisbon-

Setúbal Canyon reveal a slightly higher “weight” of coccoliths from Go and Cp. ?5 shows the 

greater importance of Gm in comparison to UUR and Cl, as indicated by the shorter “arm” that 

separates Gm from the centre of ?5. Gm is more important in the Mondego transect and in the 

canyons in comparison to the Estremadura and Sines transects. 

In order to complement the information given by the balance-dendrogram and to achieve 

a clearer perception about the spatial distribution of the (paleo)ecological ratios along the five 

studied sections, the ilr’s obtained from the SBP were plotted against distance to coast (Figure 

5.5). In analogy to factor scores in classical factor analysis (see Guerreiro et al., submitted-b; 

Chapter 4), the distribution of ilr’s towards the positive and negative part of the yy axis 

indicates the relative importance of the species in the numerator and denominator of each 

isometric log-ratio (i.e. balance), respectively, within the studied samples (cases).  

The balance ?1 clearly reveals a relatively higher importance of oceanic species further 

offshore (negative values), whereas the coastal species become more important closer to the 

coast (positive values). A larger number of samples recording ilr values &amp;lt;0 reflects the higher 

“weight” of the oceanic assemblage within the study area, most probably due to the remarkable 

dominance and broad distribution of Gm. Balance ?1 is more stable further offshore than closer 

to the coast (&amp;lt;80 km), i.e. a very stable proportion between coastal and oceanic taxa is noticed 

within and among the studied sectors offshore (except in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, due to 

lack of data for this offshore region), whereas a higher variability is visible towards the coast. 

The positive trend of ?1 towards the coast is more distinct outside the canyons, whereas a higher 

variability of both assemblages is noticed in the upper reaches of the canyons (Figure 5.5a).  

At comparable (proximal) distances off the coast, a larger number of samples with 

negative ilr’s in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon suggests a higher “weight” of the oceanic group in 

ILR binary partition:

this canyon, whereas the larger number of samples with positive ilr’s in the Nazaré Canyon 

indicates a higher “weight” of the coastal-neritic. When comparing the shelf and slope regions 

adjacent to the canyons, samples collected off Cape Sines stand out for having ilr’s ? 0 along 

the entire W-E transect, suggesting a more oceanic environment in comparison to the regions 

off Cape Mondego and Estremadura spur where a higher “weight” of the coastal-neritic 

assemblage is noticed near the coast.  

The remaining balances (ilr’s) reveal a more uniform lateral distribution in comparison to 

?1, although here too a higher stability further offshore is observed, in comparison to increasing 

variability towards the coast. The distribution of ilr’s indicates that among the coastal-neritic 

group, Go represents the higher weight within the dataset, followed by Cm, Hc and Cp. (Figures 

5.5b-d). Outside the canyons, ?2 tends to increase towards the coast revealing a higher “weight” 

of Cp and Go in these proximal regions. In contrast, the Nazaré Canyon reveals a generally 

decreasing trend along its entire W-E section, with the strongest signal of Hc and Cm recorded 

close to the coast (~20 km). At the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, ?2 stands out for recording a rather 

uniform lateral distribution (Figure 5.5b). 

Among the oceanic taxa, Gm displays by far the highest weight in the studied samples, followed 

by Cl and UUR. Balance ?5 reveals a strikingly uniform W-E distribution trend in the shelf and 

slope regions west of Cape Sines and Estremadura spur, whereas the submarine canyons and the 

region off Cape Mondego reveal a clearly decreasing trend from 60-40 km to the coast (Figure 

5.5e). Balance ?6 reveals a quite uniform lateral distribution, although a certain decreasing 

tendency is noticed towards the coast, suggesting that Cl is more important further offshore in 

comparison to UUR (Figure 5.5f). 

In Figure 5.6, the box-plots representing the distribution of the six balances with water 

depth (deeper or shallower than 500 m) revealed similar spatial distributions to those from 

Figure 5.5. The most striking aspects refer to the distribution of ?1 and ?5, whereas the 

remaining balances revealed a quite uniform distribution among the five sectors, at both shallow 

and deeper water regions (Figures 5.6a and 5.6e). Higher variability is often noticed for water 

depths lower than 500 m, whereas the deeper regions reveal a more uniform N-S distribution. 

?1 reveals a conspicuous mix of both coastal and oceanic taxa at both shallower and 

deeper areas along the canyons, whereas a clear separation between coastal and oceanic taxa is 

noticed on the adjacent shelf and slope regions, at shallower and deeper areas, respectively.  The 

Nazaré Canyon shows the stronger mixing between the two assemblages and the highest weight 

of coastal coccoliths at both water depth ranges (particularly at &amp;lt;500 m), whereas the Lisbon-

Setúbal Canyon has a higher weight of oceanic taxa at both water depth ranges. The coastal 

coccolith assemblage reveals a general N-S decrease of weight at &amp;lt;500 m, whereas the canyons 

have a higher weight of the coastal assemblage at &gt; 500 m, in comparison to the adjacent shelf 

and slope regions (Figure 5.6a). 

?5 illustrates a general N-S decreasing importance of Gm in the shallower areas, except 

in the upper reaches of the canyons where it was more strongly recorded in comparison to the 

adjacent shelf and slope regions at comparable water depths. Towards greater depths, an 

increase in importance of Cl and UUR is noticed in all the sectors. ?6 shows almost no

5.6. Discussion 

5.6.1. (Paleo)ecology of coccolithophores based on isometric log-ratios 

Results presented in this study are in good agreement with distribution trends previously 

reported by Guerreiro et al. (submitted-b) (see Chapter 4) for this dataset, using factor analysis 

with the taxa percentages: distinct (paleo)ecological N-S and W-E trends were observed 

between the seven taxonomic groups, and differences were also observed between the 

submarine canyons and the adjacent shelf and slope regions. 

The relatively higher “weight” of the oceanic assemblage in the studied dataset reflects 

the significant dominance and broad distribution of Gm (Figure 5.4). Of the three oceanic 

species, Gm seems to be better adapted to more turbulent and nutrient-rich coastal regions. 

Although this species has been associated to more temperate ecological conditions (Ziveri et al., 

2004) and to colder water masses at the onset of upwelling west off Portugal (Silva et al., 2008), 

its high abundance and wide distribution in the sedimentary record suggests it has a broad 

ecological tolerance in the central Portuguese margin. The relative enrichment of coccoliths 

from Gm in the upper reaches of the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon may result from up-canyon 

transport of resuspended coccoliths within the benthic boundary layer toward the canyon head 

(De Stigter et al., 2011) and/or the preferential onflow of more oceanic water masses through 

the canyons, as has been reported to occur in canyon systems (e.g. Skliris and Djenidi, 2006; 

Guerreiro et al, submitted-a; Chapter 3) (Figure 5.4 and 5.5e).  

On the contrary, Cl and UUR were more persistently associated to more oceanic regions 

and therefore may be used as proxies for coccolithophore productivity (P) occurring offshore 

(Figures 5.5a and f). The relatively higher weight of Cl and UUR at the southernmost part of the  

study area (i.e. west of Cape Sines) and the N–S decreasing importance of the coastal-neritic 

assemblage in the shallower areas possibly reflects a stronger influence from ENACW of 

subtropical origin (ENACWst) in this region (Fiúza et al., 1998; Guerreiro et al., submitted-b; 

Chapter 4). Such subtropical influence will expectedly be stronger during winter when the 

Iberian Poleward Current advects NEACWst towards the Portuguese coast under downwelling 

conditions prevailing during this season (Vitorino et al., 2002). 

Whereas the coastal-neritic taxa were preferentially distributed closer to the coast in all 

the five sectors, distinct (paleo)ecological signatures were observed in the canyons and the 

adjacent shelf and slope regions at greater water depths, most probably reflecting differences in 

terms of oceanographic and bottom sedimentary dynamics. In the canyons, particularly at 

Nazaré Canyon, higher “weight” of coccoliths from coastal-neritic species, higher mixing 

between the two assemblages (dispersion) (Figures 5.4, 5.5a, 5.6a) may reflect the capacity of 

the canyons to create nutrient-rich conditions favouring growth of opportunistic species, and to 

promote the exchange of water masses from neritic-coastal and oceanic regions (i.e. ecological 

signal). It may also reflect the effect of permanent internal tidal activity resuspending and 

remobilizing fine sediments from the canyon seafloor, producing a relatively more 



Chapter 5 

178 

homogeneous sedimentary cover (taphonomical signal, PE’) (De Stigter et al., 2007; 2011; 

Guerreiro et al., submitted-b; Chapter 4).  

Of the five sectors, the Nazaré Canyon reveals the highest dispersion and the highest 

weight of coastal-neritic coccoliths at &gt;500 m depth, in comparison to the other sectors for the 

same depth range, including the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon (Figure 5.6a). On the one hand, given 

the proximity of the Nazaré Canyon head to the coastline, this major valley is likely able to 

advect living coccolithophores from oceanic to more coastal areas and, at the same time, 

influencing oceanographic circulation near the coast (i.e. upwelling intensification, internal tidal 

activity), favouring the input of nutrients and thus promoting the development of r-selected 

species. Chl-a data recently obtained from satellite imagery (2006-2011) suggest that the Nazaré 

Canyon head is the most persistently productive part of the upper-middle canyon (Guerreiro et 

al., submitted-a; Chapter 3), supporting this hypothesis. On the other hand, internal tidal activity 

and intermittent down-canyon sediment gravity flows in this canyon were observed 

redistributing sediments along its entire length (De Stigter et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2011), 

which probably leads to resuspension and transport of coastal-neritic coccolith species from the 

upper canyon reaches toward the middle and lower reaches (Guerreiro et al., submitted-b; 

Chapter 4). 

On the contrary, the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon head is located further offshore, where it is 

apparently less affected by coastal dynamics. Representing a calmer environment, this canyon 

system seems to be mainly trapping particles from vertical flux. The result of this is a relatively 

more pelagic sedimentation (De Stigter et al., 2011) and a (paleo)ecological signature 

dominated by coccoliths from oceanic species (Cl, UUR; see Figures 5.3a and 5.3e). A stronger 

influence of subtropical waters flowing onto this southern part of the central Portuguese margin 

(see Fiúza et al., 1998) should be considered to explain these coccolith assemblages. 

All the balances produced by CoDA revealed higher stability further offshore, i.e. the 

taxa within each log ratio displayed very stable proportions along that part of the W-E sections, 

possibly reflecting more stable depositional conditions in these deeper regions, away from 

littoral dynamics. Coccoliths will preferentially accumulate in fine-grained hemipelagic deposits 

that accumulate in more quiescent environments of the middle and lower slope, including also 

the lower reaches of the canyons. The resulting (paleo)ecological record expectedly appears 

“cleaner” offshore, i.e. less disturbed, mostly derived from vertical coccolith fluxes. On the 

contrary, the increasing variability of the balances towards the coast reflects the increasing 

effect of taphonomical processes associated to coastal dynamics, which in the case of the central 

Portuguese margin are mostly related to coccolith resuspension and winnowing by waves and 

currents, rather than dilution with other sedimentary material (Guerreiro et al., submitted-b; 

Chapter 4).

5.6.2 Compositional vs. classical approaches 

Results obtained with CoDA are in good agreement with those from conventional 

analysis of species percentages, despite potentially spurious correlations and biased statistical 

analysis associated to the latter. While avoiding the major statistical problems related to the use 

of percentages, by providing subcompositional coherence to our dataset, CoDA allowed to 

validate the existence of two main coccolithophore assemblages – one of coastal-neritic affinity,  

represented by Cm, Hc, Go (and to a lesser extent Cp), and another of oceanic affinity 

represented by Cl, UUR and Gm. Likewise, the most striking (paleo)ecological differences 

among the five studied sectors, i.e. canyons vs. adjacent margins, and Nazaré Canyon vs. 

Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, were revealed by both compositional and classical approaches. The 

obtained balance-dendrograms revealed to be particularly efficient, not only in providing 

symmetry between the coccolithophore taxa, and thus leading to more reliable interpretations, 

but also in representing the most important statistical features and relationships between the 

taxa, their degree of dispersion and relative importance within the dataset, and their spatial 

distribution in the study area (Figure 5.4). 

This study suggests that the coccolith (paleo)ecological signal preserved in sediments of 

the central Portuguese margin is robust, despite the strong bottom dynamics prevailing in this 

region, particularly around the submarine canyons. Although similar results as obtained with 

ilr’s may in some cases also be found by just using percentages, which seems to be the case 

when the data are located close to the centre of the simplex, i.e. away from the borders, one 

cannot be sure of this in advance; in particular, one cannot tell when they “are close enough to 

the centre” and, therefore, calibration with CoDA should be a basic requirement. Results 

suggest that combining the two approaches might be the best option in order to take full 

advantage of the data set: determining the species percentages may serve as a “preview” of the 

data and the species relative abundances, and providing leads for the SBP, whereas using CoDA 

is fundamental to validate and confirm the results in a consistent framework, and to assure that 

all the information contained in the data set is being extracted and correctly interpreted. 

Despite the robust spatial trends revealed by the percentages, and confirmed by CoDA, 

results from regression tests revealed that there is only a weak or no linear dependence at all 

between the balances and the distance to the coast. This suggests that the current data set, or the 

study region itself, contains greater ecological and taphonomical complexity than can be 

resolved by basic statistical models. Further exploration of this matter is beyond the scope of the 

present paper, and is left as an open line for future research. 

Distribution patterns observed in coccolith concentrations (nanno/g) and fluxes 

(nanno/cm
2
/yr) appear to be dominated by taphonomical effects, masking the (paleo)ecological 

signal from the fossil record; a general decrease of nanno/g of all taxa towards the coast is 

mostly reflecting the increase of near-bottom sedimentary dynamics towards the coast; 

enhanced coccolith concentrations and fluxes in the upper canyon reaches may result from 

enhanced coccolithophore production in the overlying photic layer (e.g. intensification of 

upwelling) (ecological signal - vertical flux; Mendes et al., 2011; Guerreiro et al., submitted-a; 



Chapter 5 

180 

Chapter 3) and/or from lateral transport of coccoliths and deposition in fine-grained canyon 

sediments (biostratonomical signal – lateral flux) (e.g. Oliveira et al., 2007; De Stigter et al., 

2007). Given that all the taxa revealed this trend more or less equally, the second hypothesis 

may be the most feasible.  

As previously mentioned, fluxes should be carefully considered since they only take into 

account the effect of dilution with other particles (i.e. variations in SAR), but not the effect of 

other taphonomical processes, such as lateral transport, resuspension and diagenesis. This is 

particularly true for the upper Nazaré Canyon, which has been reported to act as a 

morphological trap for fine sediments in transit along the coast and shelf, and the stage of 

recurrent resuspension phenomena driven from intensified internal tidal activity (De Stigter et 

al., 2007, 2011; Oliveira et al., 2007). Likewise, one cannot be sure that enhanced coccolith 

fluxes of all taxa on the open slope of Estremadura spur reflect favourable conditions for 

phytoplankton production in this region or just overestimation of SAR due to bioturbation not 

accounted for in the calculation of SAR. 

Results suggest that sedimentary/taphonomic factors equally affect all the seven 

taxonomic groups, masking their ecological inter-relationship. Therefore, using coccolith 

species concentrations and fluxes determined from SAR appears to enhance the taphonomic 

effects over the ecological signal and, thus, might not be the best approach when investigating 

the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores from coastal-neritic-oceanic sections, particularly in the 

context of submarine canyons (Guerreiro et al., submitted-b; Chapter 4)  Nevertheless, the two 

measures might be a useful indicator for coccolithophore productivity and/or terrigenous 

sediment starvation, and for hydrodynamic conditions over a continental margin.  

 

 

5.7. Conclusions 

While avoiding the major statistical problems of dealing with percentages, CoDA allowed 

to validate the existence of a coastal-neritic (Hc, Go and Cp) and an oceanic assemblage (Gm, 

Cl, UUR), with the latter revealing a relatively higher “weight” in the studied dataset. This 

reflects the remarkable dominance and broad distribution of Gm in the entire investigated 

region, suggesting this species is better adapted to more turbulent and nutrient-rich coastal 

regions in comparison to other oceanic taxa such as Cl and UUR.  

Relatively stronger mixing of the two coccolithophore assemblages in the canyons, in 

comparison to the adjacent shelf and slope regions, is interpreted as reflecting the role of these 

major submarine valleys in exchanging water masses between coastal and oceanic regions 

and/or the important role of internal tides and sediment gravity flows in 

resuspending/transporting particles from the upper canyon reaches down to their middle and 

lower reaches, leading to a more homogenised sedimentary and (paleo)ecological record. The 

Nazaré Canyon revealed the broadest range in (paleo)ecological signature and the highest 

“weight” of coastal-neritic coccoliths, both in shallower and deeper regions. This seems to 

indicate, on the one hand, higher nutrient availability in this area resulting from the proximity of 



(CoDA) as a tool to study the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores 

 
181 

 

the canyon head to the coast and the associated intensification of upwelling, and stronger 

internal tidal activity in the upper canyon; on the other hand, it may be reflecting enhanced 

exchange of water masses between coastal and oceanic regions occurrung along this major 

submarine canyon, involving the advection of living coccolithophores from oceanic to more 

coastal areas in the upper water masses, whereas coccoliths produced by coastal-neritic species 

in the upper canyon reaches may be transported down-canyon by internal tides and turbidity 

currents acting along the bottom of the canyon. 

On the contrary, the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon reveals a (paleo)ecological signature richer 

in coccoliths from oceanic species (Cl, UUR), probably reflecting the more offshore position of 

the canyon heads, and thus representing a more stable environment mainly trapping particles 

from vertical flux. Higher weight of Gm in the upper reaches of the canyons, in comparison to 

the adjacent coastal areas, suggests this species is tracing the up-canyon flow of resuspended 

coccoliths from the benthic layer to the canyon head and/or the preferential onflow of more 

oceanic water masses through the canyons. Higher weight of the oceanic assemblage in the 

southern part of the study area appears to be tracing a stronger influence of ENACWst, whereas 

a higher weight of Gm in the northern part may be tracing a stronger influence of ENACWsp in 

this area. 

Using the species concentrations and the coccolith fluxes determined from SAR appears 

to enhance the taphonomic effects over the ecological signal, and therefore, might not be the 

best approach when investigating the (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores along coast to ocean 

sections, particularly in the context of a continental margin dissected by submarine canyons. 

Enhanced coccolith concentrations and fluxes of all taxa in the upper canyon reaches appears to 

result mostly from lateral transport of coccoliths and deposition within these morphological 

traps along with fine–grained sediment in transit along the shelf. 

Results obtained with isometric log ratio coordinates are in good agreement with results 

obtained using species percentages, despite potentially spurious correlations and biased 

statistical analysis associated to percentage determinations. This suggests that the coccolith 

(paleo)ecological signal preserved in sediments of the central Portuguese margin is robust, even 

in the context of the highly dynamic submarine canyons. Nevertheless, calibration with ilr’s 

should be a basic requirement since it cannot be sure in advance that use of percentage data will 

produce reliable results. Combining the two approaches should be the best compromise to take 

the best of our data set: determining the species percentages provides a “preview” of the data 

and provides the basis for the SBP, whereas CoDA appears as a fundamental tool to validate 

and corroborate the obtained ecological signals, and to assure that all the information contained 

in the data set is being extracted and correctly understood.

Synthesis and Future Work 

6.1. Synthesis 

The central Portuguese margin represents a complex and diversified region in terms of 

oceanography, bottom topography and sedimentary dynamics. Currents and water masses of 

distinct origins, with different hydrological and ecological characteristics, converge into this 

area and seasonal variation in shelf-slope circulation is modulated by seasonal shifts in the 

position of the Azores high and Iceland low pressure systems, resulting in alternating upwelling 

and downwelling along the coast. The two major submarine canyons extending from near the 

shore to abyssal depth, focusing geostrophical currents and oceanic water masses, and 

amplifying tidal and wind-forced currents, are expected to enhance vertical water transport and 

exchange between coastal and oceanic regions, potentially providing a nutrient source for local 

phytoplankton development. Phytoplankton assemblages characteristic of the canyon setting 

may be preserved in sediments accumulating within the canyons and adjacentshelf and slope, 

but high terrigenous sediment input and strong bottom water dynamics are expected to 

significantly dilute and disturb the (paleo)ecological signal. Extracting the ecological signal 

from the sedimentary record, which particularly in the context of submarine canyons is prone to 

taphonomical bias, represents a major challenge for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. The 

present thesis presents a first attempt to address this challenge, on the basis of coccolithophores 

and recent coccoliths collected from the central Portuguese margin. Relevant issues discussed in 

the various chapters of the thesis include the present day ecology and distribution of 

coccolithophores in the central Portuguese margin (Chapters 2 and 4), effects of the central 

Portuguese canyons on the ecology of coccolithophores living in the overlying surface waters, 

and the potential of this group as tracer for canyon processes (Chapters 3 and 4), the dichotomy 

between taphonomy and ecology of coccolithophores from coastal settings (Chapters 4 and 5) 

and statistical approaches to perform more consistent (paleo)ecological interpretations while 

avoiding the statistical problems associated with the use of percentages (Chapter 5). 

 

 

Ecology and distribution of coccolithophores offshore Portugal 

Whereas the general biogeography and habitat characteristics of coccolithophores are 

relatively well-described from plankton and bottom sediment surveys, the effects of local 

phenomena such as coastal currents, gyres, eddies, upwelling and river runoff are often less 

well-known. More regional studies are required to calibrate the specific local ecological 

tolerances of this group, and to evaluate their potential for local paleoceanographic 

reconstructions. Results presented in this thesis contribute to fill this gap, using the living

coccolithophores and sediment coccolith assemblages recorded from the central Portuguese 

margin.  

Whereas coccolithophores are often considered as a typical open ocean phytoplankton 

group, due to their greater species diversity and numerical contribution to open ocean 

phytoplankton communities  (e.g. McIntyre and Bé, 1967; Winter et al., 1994; Brand, 1994; 

Ziveri et al., 2004), coccolithophores were found in high concentrations in coastal waters of the 

central Portuguese margin, exhibiting an ecological gradient from K-selected species prevailing 

further offshore to r-selected species occurring in higher numbers in more coastal-neritic areas. 

Results from the cruise in late winter 2010 reported in Chapter 2 provide a remarkable snap-shot 

view on the capacity of phytoplankton to rapidly respond to favourable nutrient and light 

conditions resulting from short-term regional meteorological and hydrographic variability 

Whereas surface water phytopigment data collected during this event indicate that diatoms were 

the dominant phytoplankton group and the main contributor of Chl-a production (data not 

shown), rapid exhaustion of silica by diatoms apparently worked in favour of coccolithophores 

which could profit from nitrates and phosphorus still available at the surface (Figures 2.6-2.7). 

In fact, whereas nutrient depletion from coastal waters is usually attributed to diatoms and some 

opportunistic dinoflagellate species (Moita, 2001; Mendes et al., 2011), the significant increase 

of coccolithophore cell densities observed off central Portugal in March 2010 indicates that this 

group can also take advantage of intermittent nutrient replenishment (Figure 2.5). Emiliania 

huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica were the key players of the coccolithophore bloom 

observed during the high-productive period of the cruise, showing a particularly rapid response 

to nutrient input and improved light conditions.  These two species were able to compete with 

opportunistic small-chain diatoms, as revealed by their drastic increase of cell densities in the 

coastal region off Cape Carvoeiro, together with Chaetoceros s.l., Thalassiosira s.l, 

Skeletonema s.l., clearly confirming their role as early succession r-selected taxa, capable of 

rapid growth within nutrient-rich environments (Margalef, 1978). 

Whereas E. huxleyi did not reveal any clear distribution trend in the sediment, most likely 

reflecting the effects of early-diagenesis on its small-sized coccoliths closer to the coast, the 

coastal affinity of G. oceanica was distinctly reflected in sediments from the central Portuguese 

margin, particularly south of the Nazaré Canyon, where this species dominated the coccolith 

assemblage (Figures 4.4e and 6.1). Given its rapid response to nutrient input observed off Cape 

Carvoeiro, its dominance in sediments from around this area suggests that the Estremadura Spur 

shelf is the stage of more or less persistent high productivity. Interpretation of G. oceanica as a 

good (paleo)ecological proxy for enhanced productivity near the coast is in agreement with 

previous studies reporting the coastal ecological preference of this species (Silva et al., 2008) 

and its ability to quickly respond to nutrient input (Winter et al., 1994; Giraudeau and Bailey, 

1995; Broerse et al., 2000; Andruleit and Rogalla, 2002; Sprengel et al., 2002; Andruleit et al., 

2003). 

Coronosphaera mediterranea was also able to profit from favourable nutrient conditions, 

although less prominently than E. huxleyi and G. oceanica, and more displaced towards the 

shelf-break region (Figures 2.8-2.11). High cell densities in the upper water masses of the 



Synthesis and Future Work 

 

187 

Nazaré Canyon head correspond well with highest coccolith percentages in the 

underlying sediments, suggesting persistently favourable conditions for C. mediterranea in this 

proximal part of the canyon (Figure 4.4b). Results confirm previous observations from Moita et 

al. (2010) reporting the significant occurrence of this species close to the coast off Nazaré 

during winter.  

Helicosphaera carteri also exhibited a preference for more coastal environments, 

correlating positively with the afore-mentioned high-productivity species during the 2
nd

 leg of 

the cruise, and displaying a markedly coastal distribution within the sediment (Figures 2.11a 

and 4.4f). Results are in agreement with an earlier study from Guerreiro et al. (2005) reporting 

an extremely high percentage of H. carteri (~85 %) in sediments from the mouth of the Douro 

estuary, interpreted as reflecting an opportunistic behaviour possibly related with locally 

confined nutrient-rich conditions.  

On the oceanic side, Syracosphaera spp. (dominated by S. marginoporata) and Ophiaster 

spp. (with slightly higher densities of O. hydroideus) were the most consistently oligotrophic 

taxa observed in the upper photic layer during both low- and high-productive periods. Closer to 

the coast, the two taxa displayed a broad vertical distribution extending well below the nutrient-

rich surface layer, revealing their ability to compete with E. huxleyi in the subsurface layer in 

these near-shore areas (Figures 2.9-2.11). This suggests that lower light and nutrient levels 

present in subsurface shelf waters were less limiting for these taxa than for E. huxleyi.  

The near absence of coccoliths from Syracosphaera spp. and Ophiaster spp. in the 

sediment, even in the most offshore stations, most likely reflects the lower resistance of their 

smaller sized-coccoliths to the effects of both biostratonomy and early-diagenesis. Instead, 

larger and more robust coccoliths from Calcidiscus leptoporus were consistently better 

represented further offshore, indicating the stronger affinity of this species for more oceanic-

oligotrophic environments and its greater resistance to dissolution and breakage in comparison 

to the two former groups (Figure 4.4a and 6.1). C. leptoporus may therefore be considered a 

good proxy for coccolithophore production occurring further offshore, which is in good 

agreement with earlier studies reporting this species as a winter-species in Lisbon bay, tracing 

the advection of subtropical oceanic waters to this region (Silva et al., 2008) and, in a larger 

scale, associated to oceanic-oligotrophic environments, preferentially occurring within oceanic 

gyre centers (Ziveri et al., 2004).  

Gephyrocapsa ericsonii and Gephyrocapsa muellerae revealed apparently similar 

ecological preferences during the plankton cruise, decreasing in cell densities in shelf and upper 

slope waters during the high-productive period, but increasing in the most offshore waters 

where E. huxleyi was not significantly developing (Figure 2.11). G. muellerae was one of the 

most abundant placolith-bearing taxa (?3 µm) during the low-productive period, next to E. 

huxleyi and G. ericsonii, with cell densities three times higher than those of G. oceanica, even at 

the coastal stations (Table 2.2). During the high-productive period, however, the ratio between 

the two species was reversed, with G. oceanica dominating over G. muellerae near the coast 

(see Figure 6.2a,b). In the sediment, though, G. muellerae was by far the most abundant 

coccolith species  (?3µm) in surface sediments, with concentrations often higher than those of 



Chapter 6 

 

188 

E. huxleyi and G. ericsonii, and dominating the assemblages of both coastal and more offshore 

areas (except on the Estremadura shelf) (Figure 4.4d and 6.1c). Higher percentages of coccoliths 

from G. muellerae in sediments of oceanic areas outside the canyons are in good agreement 

with the relatively higher abundance of this species in more oligotrophic surface waters off 

central Portugal, in comparison to other placolith-bearing species such as G. oceanica, E. 

huxleyi). 

The overwhelming dominance of G. muellerae over G. oceanica in the sediment suggests 

that, whereas the latter may be faster and more efficient in its response to intermittent “bursts” 

of nutrient input, G. muellerae may maintain a more regular production on the longer run. 

Although phytoplankton blooms often result in higher production of zooplankton faecal pellets 

and therefore a more efficient transfer of coccoliths from the upper water layers to the seafloor 

than during non-bloom conditions (see Roth, 1994; Steinmetz, 1994; Balch, 2004), results 

presented here give rise to new questions about the real importance of bloom events in the 

generation of the sedimentary record.  

 

 

Coccolithophores in the central Portuguese submarine canyons: the Nazaré and 

Lisbon-Setúbal canyons 

Compared to the effort made over the last 15 years to characterize and understand the 

geology and geomorphology of the central Portuguese canyons, little was known until recently 

about how these canyons affect the circulation over the shelf and upper slope and the production 

and distribution of phytoplankton. The present thesis was specifically addressing these 

questions, providing some indications about the influence of the canyons on the present day 

ecology and distribution of coccolithophores on the central Portuguese margin. 

The Nazaré Canyon head appeared to be the stage of different processes converging in 

the near-shore area. On the one hand, this area seemed to constitute a local “pool” of oceanic 

water masses near the coast during winter, contrasting to nutrient-richer water masses from the 

surrounding shelf and coast. This was revealed by CTD sections along the upper canyon axis 

showing that the core of the IPC reached very near-shore areas less than 10 km off the coast via 

the canyon, and by the single occurrence of typical subtropical-oligotrophic species 

Discosphaera tubifera, Palusphaera vandelii and Calcidiscus leptoporus associated with water 

of southerly origin advected by the IPC (Figures 3.10d and 3.2). This observation agrees with 

earlier studies indicating that narrow submarine canyons may significantly deflect shelf 

circulation when stratification is absent (Klinck, 1988; Hickey, 1997), thereby intensifying 

water mass exchange between the ocean and the coast. High relative abundances of coccoliths 

produced by G. muellerae in sediments from the upper reaches of the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, 

and in the middle Nazaré Canyon, equivalent to abundances more typically found in the 

offshore areas (Figure 4.4d), could be tracing the preferential onflow of more oceanic water 

masses through these canyons. 

 



Synthesis and Future Work 

 

189 

At the same time, several observations seem to support the hypothesis of enhanced 

phytoplankton production  in the canyon head: the presence of a diverse coccolithophore 

assemblage dominated by the productive E. huxleyi, G. ericsonii and C. mediterranea, together 

with maxima of both neritic-coastal taxa (i.e. G. oceanica, Acanthoica spp.) and neritic-oceanic 

taxa (i.e. G. muellerae, S. dalmaticus, Alisphaera spp., Michaelsarsia elegans), and the 

observation of a Chl-a peak at the canyon head obtained in March 2010 (Figure 3.11c). Surface 

water Chl-a distribution determined from satellite data, indicate the Nazaré Canyon head as an 

area of persistent high phytoplankton production particularly between March and October) 

(Figure 3.11a). This agrees well with enhanced percentages of coastal-neritic coccolith species 

(C. mediterranea and H. carteri) in sediment of the canyon head in comparison to the adjacent 

coastal areas (Fig. 4.4b,f). Enhanced Chl-a concentrations often found south of the canyon and 

close to Cape Carvoeiro support previous observations by Mendes et al. (2011) of persistently 

high diatom concentrations south of the canyon, apparently related to intensification of 

upwelling along the southern canyon rim and extending its influence to the shelf south of the 

canyon, persisting even during relaxation of upwelling-favourable winds.  

The relatively higher diversity of coccolithophores found in the canyon head may be 

considered as representative for late-winter conditions in the upper Nazaré Canyon, involving 

locally enhanced production of more opportunistic phytoplankton species by upwelling 

intensification and internal tidal pumping, and introduction of oceanic species along with the 

shoreward advection of oceanic and oligotrophic water masses through the narrow upper canyon 

(see Figure 6.1). The more pronounced mixing of coccoliths from both coastal-neritic and 

oceanic species in sediments from the Nazaré Canyon, compared to the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, 

confirms the enhanced exchange of water masses between coastal and oceanic regions in the 

Nazaré Canyon system. This seems not only to apply to the advection of living coccolithophores 

from oceanic to more coastal areas in the upper water masses ((paleo)ecological record), but 

also to the down-canyon transport of coccoliths produced by coastal-neritic species in the upper 

canyon reaches, by internal tides and turbidity currents acting along the bottom of the canyon 

(taphonomical record).  

In the vicinity of Belatina Valley, in the upper Nazaré Canyon, indications for interaction 

of the canyon with surface water circulation and phytoplankton production consist in local 

maxima in surface water concentrations of nutrients, Chl-a, and coccolithophore cell densities. 

Maximum density gradients between the superficial buoyant plume existing during the time of 

the cruise and the winter mixed layer underneath, appear to reflect a significant topographic 

effect induced by this narrow part of the canyon on the surface circulation, generating a front 

between the buoyant plume and the shelf-slope waters (Figure 3.7). This agrees with previous 

observations from Quaresma (2012) who found that this part of the canyon acts as a water drain 

for the surrounding area during every low tide, potentially resulting in the concentration of 

particles in the surface water layer, which over time would result in local nutrient-enrichment 

favorable for phytoplankton growth. Earlier studies also referred to the important role of ocean 

currents within and above submarine canyons in funneling and trapping plankton (Macquart-

Moulin and Patriti, 1996; Bosley et al., 2004; Skliris and Djenidi, 2006). 



Chapter 6 

 

190 

Below the surface, the vertical density gradient existing between the surficial buoyant 

plume and the ENACW may have promoted the baroclinic oscillation of the water masses 

within the narrow canyon topography. The presence of a meander in this part of the canyon axis,  

blocking the flow of the internal wave, seemed to enhance the vertical oscillation (Figure 3.2). 

Previous observations also suggested that Belatina Valley may be a site of enhanced 

phytoplankton productivity, through the action of internal tidal pumping of nutrients from below 

the canyon rim up to the photic layer, particularly under stratified conditions prevailing during 

summer (e.g. Oliveira et al., 2007) Similar processes have also been reported to occur in the 

Monterey Canyon, California (Ryan et al., 2005; 2010).  

When comparing the Nazaré and the Lisbon-Setúbal canyons, differences in the coccolith 

assemblages between the upper reaches of the two canyons seem to reflect differences in their 

environmental settings and dynamics; a more coastal ecological signature (i.e. dominance of C. 

mediterranea, H. carteri, and to some extent also G. oceanica) in the Nazaré Canyon probably 

reflects the greater proximity of this canyon head to the coastline and the associated 

intensification of upwelling and stronger influence of coastal dynamics (see Figure 6.1). On the 

contrary, a more oceanic ecological signature in the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon (i.e. dominance of 

G. muellerae, C. leptoporus and UUR) suggests that a generally more oceanic-pelagic 

environment characterised by more oligotrophic nutrient conditions is prevailing in this canyon, 

which may be explained by its greater distance from coastal dynamics. In addition, a stronger 

influence of ENACWst in the southern part of the study area will expectedly leave a clearer 

“oceanic ecological imprint” (i.e. C. leptoporus and UUR) in this canyon.  

Apart from distinct ecological conditions prevailing in the surface waters overlying the 

Nazaré and Lisbon-Setúbal canyons, differences in their bottom sedimentary dynamics should 

also be considered when interpreting differences in the coccolith assemblages; i.e. stronger 

effects of intermittent down-canyon gravity flows and bottom resuspension by internal tidal 

currents in the Nazaré Canyon, in comparison to calmer sedimentary conditions prevailing in 

the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon (see Figure 6.1).  

 

 

Taphonomy vs. (paleo)ecology of coccolithophores in coastal settings  

Although coccolith thanatocoenoses preserved in seabed sediments may be expected to 

show a general correspondence with the living communities dwelling in the overlying photic 

layer, the correspondence is generally complicated (see Steinmetz, 1994; Roth, 1994) due to 

modification of the primary ecological signal by a variety of taphonomical processes integrated 

over several months, years, decades, centuries or even thousands of years (Figure 5.1). 

Complexity further increases in shallower marine environments such as continental 

shelves, particularly in areas where submarine canyons are deeply incising the shelf and coast, 

and where continental and oceanic processes interplay. Sediments in such dynamic areas will 

always contain an averaged paleoenvironmental signal composed of the cumulative of  

 



 

 
 

 

 
Figure 6.1– Schematic representation of the most striking environmental differences between coastal submarine canyons and adjacent coast-shelf areas, using the Nazaré 

Canyon as example: (a) outside the canyons the coast-ocean gradient represented by r-selected taxa near the coast, and K-selected taxa further offshore, is more distinctive in 

comparison to the canyon (b) where a mixture of K- and r-selected taxa is noticed in the upper canyon; focusing of oceanic water masses via the canyon results in advection of 

subtropical taxa towards the coast and, concurrently, enhanced nutrient pumping driven by intensified upwelling and focusing of internal tidal activity in the canyon head 

results in enhanced production of r-selected taxa in this area. The mixing of ecologically diverse taxa is also recorded on the seabed of the canyon and extends from the upper 

to the middle canyon axis, with additional contribution of coccoliths resuspended and transported down-canyon by internal tides. Green colors represent the injection of 

nutrients by coastal upwelling and internal tidal pumping and r-selected coccolithophores (e.g. C. mediterranea – Cm; E. huxleyi – Eh; G. oceanica – Go). Thicker green 

arrow in the canyon illustrates the intensification of these phenomena in the upper canyon reaches. Blue colors represent onshore advection of oceanic water masses via the 

canyon and entrained oceanic-oligotrophic taxa (e.g. Syracosphaera spp. – Syraco; Calcidiscus leptoporus – Cl; Discosphaera tubifera – Dtub). Coccoliths represented in the 

figure belong to taphonomically-resistant taxa C. leptoporus, G. oceanica, C. mediterranea. 



Chapter 6 

 

ecological and sedimentary signals, of which only the stronger leave a recognisable “imprint” in the 

sediment. 

In the studied data set from the central Portuguese margin, diversity of coccolithophores in the 

surface water layer appeared much higher (35 species) than that of coccoliths preserved in the sediment 

(18 species), illustrating the significant loss of information occurring between the moment of 

coccolithophore production in the photic layer and the incorporation of the coccoliths within the seafloor 

sediment. Post-mortem loss of information (i.e. due to biostratonomy) was particularly important for 

smaller and more delicate taxa such as Syracosphaera spp., Ophiaster spp., S. dalmaticus which, despite 

their significant concentrations in the photic layer, were found to be rare or absent in the sediment.  

Large placolith- (Gephyrocapsa spp., C. pelagicus, C. leptoporus), helicolith- (H. carteri), and 

some robust caneolith-bearing taxa (C. mediterranea and Syracosphaera pulchra) appeared less affected 

by early diagenesis and most likely to become part of the sediment assemblage, which agrees with earlier 

studies reporting these species as being the most dissolution-resistant (e.g. Steinmetz, 1994; Roth, 1994; 

Andruleit et al., 2003; Andruleit and Rogalla, 2002; Baumann et al., 2005). In contrast, smaller placolith-

bearing taxa like E. huxleyi and G. ericsonii have been recognized as more easily affected by dissolution, 

reason for which their coccolith concentrations are here used as qualitative indicators for the degree of 

preservation of the coccolith assemblages in the sediment. 

Indeed, in the studied assemblages from the central Portuguese margin, the most striking difference 

concerns the drastic relative decrease of E. huxleyi and the important relative increase of G. muellerae. 

Whereas E. huxleyi showed an overwhelming dominance in the living communities from both low- and 

high-productive periods, other species significantly increased in the sediment, even those which showed 

only low concentrations in the upper photic layer. Such is the case for larger species like H. carteri, C. 

leptoporus and C. pelagicus (Figure 6.2). 

Despite of its observed ability to rapidly respond to nutrient input, and relative robustness of its 

coccoliths, G. oceanica appeared to be less abundant in the sediment in comparison to G. muellerae, 

whilst in the living assemblages observed during the cruise G. oceanica was generally the more abundant 

of the two species. This suggests that G. muellerae may be more productive in the long run and over a 

broader area off Portugal, whereas G. oceanica is mostly abundant in particularly productive areas such 

as the upper Nazaré canyon region and adjacent southern continental shelf. This finding raises new 

questions on whether coccolith assemblages preserved in the sediment are mostly formed by steady 

production of less conspicuous “slow” coccolithophores, or by bursts of bloom species such as G. 

oceanica and E. huxleyi. At the same time, given the apparently broader ecological tolerance of G. 

muellerae, this study suggest that this species may have lower potential as paleoenvironmental proxy in 

comparison to G. oceanica, which appears to be particularly well adapted to high-productive coastal 

environments.  

In addition to the effects of biostratonomy and early diagenesis, winnowing by waves and currents 

in more near-shore areas are additional factors adding complexity to the transformation of coccolith 

assemblages from coastal settings. Due to their tiny size, coccoliths are less prone to accumulate in 

coarse-grained deposits of the shelf and upper slope, but more likely accumulate in fine-grained 

hemipelagic deposits of the middle and lower slope and the canyons.

This process appears to affect all taxa, as shown by a general decrease of coccolith concentrations 

towards the coast particularly evident along transects across the open shelf and slope, and a general 

increase of coccolith concentrations and fluxes in the upper canyon reaches in comparison to the adjacent 

shelf areas (Figures 4.3 and 5.3). The concentration of coccoliths along with other fine-grained material in 

upper canyon sediment depocenters, includes both coccoliths produced in the overlying photic layer 

(ecological signal – vertical flux), as well as resuspended coccoliths arriving by lateral transport 

(biostratonomical signal – lateral flux). 

Despite of all these complicating factors, two distinct coccolith assemblages could be 

distinguished, which seem to reflect the ecological trends from the overlying photic layer off central 

Portugal: a coccolith assemblage of coastal affinity primarily represented by C. mediterranea, H. carteri 

and G. oceanica, and another assemblage of oceanic affinity, composed of C. leptoporus, G.muellerae 

and UUR (Figures 4.4. and 5.3). No consistent evidence for selective transport or preservation of 

individual taxa was found when considering the taphonomically more resistant taxa: C. leptoporus and H. 

carteri, two species of comparable size and expectedly comparable degree of resistance to dissolution and 

physical breakage, exhibited distinct and opposite distribution patterns, unrelated to trends in sediment 

particle size. C. leptoporus was more abundant offshore in fine-grained sediments, whereas H. carteri 

was more abundant close to the shore in coarser grained sediment. Similarly, G. oceanica and C. 

mediterranea, two smaller and more fragile coccolith species were preferably found closer to the coast 

despite the stronger winnowing and destructive mechanical forces in that area. 

In the submarine canyons, similar trends were also recorded although somewhat levelled-out, 

probably reflecting interference of the ecological-oceanographic signal resulting from enhanced 

ecological and oceanographic processes in the surface water and the taphonomical signal resulting from 

the intense bottom water dynamics in the canyons. Especially in the Nazaré Canyon onshore advection of 

oceanic coccolithophore species through the canyon and down-canyon transport of coastal-neritic 

coccoliths appears to result in mixing of oceanic and coastal-neritic assemblages. Even so, locally 

enhanced productivity in the canyon head appears to be persistent enough to be reflected in the 

(paleo)ecological record preserved in the sediment (see Figure 6.1).  

In the Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon the (paleo)ecological record may be expected to be less disturbed 

and determined mostly by the vertical flux of coccoliths produced in the overlying water, due to the fact 

that this canyon seems to represents a less dynamic sedimentary environment in comparison to the Nazaré 

Canyon (De Stigter et al., 2011). Nevertheless, whereas the relative increase of coccoliths of G. muellerae 

observed in the upper reaches of this canyon may reflect shoreward advection of oceanic water masses 

through the canyon, concentration of this species by taphonomical processes should not be excluded; 

since abundances of G. muellerae on the adjacent Sines and Estremadura shelves are distinctly lower than 

in the Lisbon-Setúbal canyon, and this species was by far the most abundant (? 3µm) in open slope 

sediments, the high relative abundance in upper canyon sediments may partially reflect up-canyon 

displacement of coccoliths from the deeper canyon and slope, along with the overall up-canyon 

suspended sediment transport that seems to occur in this canyon (De Stigter et al., 2011).  

In conclusion, results of this study seem to indicate that despite of all the factors intervening with 

the deposition and preservation of coccoliths in sediments of coastal-neritic areas, leading to significant 

loss of the initial species diversity of the live coccolithophore assemblage, the taphonomically resistant

Synthesis and Future Work 

 

 

coccolith taxa may be useful tracers of ecological and oceanographical processes occurring on the central 

Portuguese margin. It appears generally more difficult to make ecological inferences based on coccoliths 

preserved in the sedimentary record of canyons, due to the more complex surface circulation and stronger 

bottom water dynamics prevailing in these areas. Knowledge of the oceanographic processes occurring in 

these areas appears crucial prerequisite for the correct interpretation of the ecological signals preserved in 

sediments from submarine canyons. 

 

 

Compositional Data Analysis: the isometric log-ratio approach  

Determining species relative abundance in percentage relative to the sum of total or selected 

common coccoliths is a standard analytical procedure in paleoecological studies, by which ecological 

inter-relationships between species can be inferred independently of sediment dilution effects. However, 

determining percentages entails inconsistencies mostly related to the closure problem, often leading to 

spurious correlations between the taxa and biased statistical analysis, and thus to potentially unrealistic 

interpretations (Pawlowsky-Glahn and Egozcue, 2006). The Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) 

approach applied in this study has the advantage that scale-invariance and subcompositional coherence 

are satisfied, which is essential to avoid spurious correlations. By implementing the use of isometric log-

ratios, CoDA allows extracting all the information contained in data variability, thus leading to more 

reliable comparisons and interpretations (Buccianti, 2013). 

In the present study, CoDA allowed to validate the existence of two main coccolithophore 

assemblages, initially inferred from percentage data: one of coastal-neritic affinity, and another of oceanic 

affinity. The most striking (paleo)ecological differences among the five studied transects, i.e. canyons vs. 

adjacent margins, and Nazaré Canyon vs. Lisbon-Setúbal Canyon, were also revealed by both 

compositional and classical approaches. CoDa balances revealed higher stability further offshore, 

possibly reflecting more uniform depositional conditions away from shelf and upper canyon dynamics, 

where the (paleo)ecological record is less disturbed and mostly derived from vertical coccolith fluxes 

(Figure 5.5). In contrast, the increasing variability of the balances towards the coast reflects the increasing 

effect of taphonomical processes associated to coastal dynamics, mostly related to coccolith resuspension 

and transport by waves and currents (see Chapter 4 – Table 4.2). 

The higher weight of the oceanic assemblage in the studied dataset reflects the significant 

dominance and broad distribution of G. muellerae in the study area (Figure 5.4; see section I). CoDA also 

confirmed the mixing of coastal and oceanic taxa along the canyons, contrasting with the clear separation 

between coastal and oceanic taxa on the adjacent shelf and slope areas (Figure 5.6), reflecting the 

different oceanographic and sedimentary dynamics of the canyons and the open shelf and slope. 

The good agreement between trends observed in percentage data and trends revealed by CoDA 

confirms the robustness of the coccolith (paleo)ecological signal preserved in sediments of the central 

Portuguese margin. Nevertheless, calibration with isometric log-ratio is recommended as a basic 

requirement in (paleo)ecological studies, since it cannot be assured in advance that use of percentage data 

will produce reliable results (Pawlowsky-Glahn and Egozcue, 2006). Combining the two approaches 

might be the best option in order to take full advantage of the data set: the species percentages serve as a 

195

“preview” of the data and the species relative abundances, and providing leads for the SBP, whereas 

using CoDA allows validating and confirming the results in a consistent framework.  

 

6.2. Future Work 

Results presented in this thesis show that coccolithophores are valuable tracers for oceanograpic, 

ecological and sedimentary processes occurring on the central Portuguese margin. It was demonstrated 

that short-term hydrographic-meteorological variability should be taken into account when interpreting 

coccolith assemblages preserved in the sedimentary record of continental margin settings. In addition, 

new insights are provided with regards to the impact of sea bottom topography and oceanographic 

circulation on both ecology and taphonomy of coccolithophores, and notably the role of submarine 

canyons as preferential conduits for advection of oceanic water masses into more coastal areas and the 

down-canyon transport of suspended particles near the bottom.  

In the case of Belatina Valley, however, where enhanced local productivity of coccolithophores 

inferred from in situ measurements could not be corroborated by satellite data nor by coccoliths in the 

sedimentary record, validation by means of additional sampling surveys may be required, addressing the 

seasonal and interannual variability of phytoplankton (in general) and coccolithophores (in particular), 

integrated with meteorological and hydrological monitoring. Enhanced productivity at Belativa Valley 

may be too deep and short-lived to be detected in monthly averages of surface water Chl-a obtained by 

satellite. Long-term in situ observations within and outside the canyon axis should therefore be performed 

in future studies, in order to evaluate the spatial and temporal persistency of ecological hotspots occurring 

in this area; i.e. how long they exist, at the surface or deeper in the water column, and if they are actually 

confined to the canyon axis and its immediate vicinity, or part of a larger pattern not necessarily related to 

the canyon.  

A more complete and time-integrated understanding of the influence of the central Portuguese 

canyons on the seasonal production and spatial distribution of coccolithophores could be obtained by 

means of sediment trap moorings deployed at specific locations along the canyon (i.e. canyon head, 

upper-middle and middle-lower canyon transition), and at different depths along the water column (i.e. 

just below the photic zone but above the canyon rim, at intermediate depth, and near the bottom). 

Although earlier studies referred to the overprinting of the productivity signal in sediment traps by 

resuspended or advected particles in shallower regions (i.e. Broerse, 2000; Sprengel et al., 2002), results 

of the present study give confidence that ecological phenomena off central Portugal are strong and 

persistent enough to leave their imprint in the sediment. In fact, sediment traps would allow addressing 

several questions concerning the transport and sedimentation of coccoliths in the canyons. By evaluating 

actual fluxes of coccoliths towards the canyon seafloor, it can be assessed to what extent this flux 

represents export production (i.e. reflecting changes in productivity in the overlying surface waters) or 

has a significant component determined by lateral advection and bottom resuspension of coccoliths. 

Finally, for testing the application of coccoliths as proxies of paleoceanographic and 

paleoenvironmental changes in the Nazaré Canyon region, two long sediment cores previously collected 

from the north and south bank of the lower Nazaré Canyon (Koho, 2008) might offer interesting 

196

opportunities. Analysis of coccolith assemblages from these cores may give insight in millennial scale 

variations in NAO during the Holocene, its frequency and impact on the sedimentary and ecological 

dynamics off central Portugal. Periods characterized by a negative NAO index will expectedly be marked 

by increased terrigenous sediment supply to the lower canyon due to intensified canyon flushing events 

triggered by enhanced storm and river flooding frequency; in coccolith assemblages marked by greater 

diversity of oceanic species and higher percentages of reworked coastal-neritic species. Periods 

characterized by a positive NAO index will most likely be marked by hemipelagic sedimentation, with 

relatively higher proportions of oceanic coccoliths. In addition, comparing coccolith assemblages from 

the two contrasting sedimentary environments, the north bank being affected by spill-over of sediment 

gravity flows going down the canyon, and the south bank apparently only affected by continuous 

hemipelagic deposition, may contribute to better distinction of transport in fossil coccolith assemblages.

APPENDIX C - Glossary and Abbreviations 

 
Biocoenosis (bios = life, cenosis = community) – community of organisms living in a certain region or 

habitat.  

Biostratonomy – refers to the set of processes that are responsible for the transport of the organism’s 

remains from the moment of its death until the moment of its “permanent” deposition.  

Bioturbation – reworking of the sediment by benthic organisms, causing horizontal and vertical 

displacement of sediment particles, and leading to the increase of the sediment-water interface and 

consequent increase of particle exchange between the sediment and the water column.  

Coastal upwelling – Upward and onshore movement of cooler and denser water from deeper levels of the 

water column, induced by the offshore movement of the Ekman surface layer in response to longshore 

wind stress. Its ecological importance lies in the replenishment of surface waters with nutrients stimulating 

primary production. 

Coastal downwelling – Downward and offshore movement of water from superficial levels of the water 

column, induced by the onshore movement of the Ekman surface layer in response to longshore wind 

stress.  

Coriolis force – force apparently experienced by any object moving through a rotating reference frame, 

causing deflection relative to the reference frame. Winds and currents moving across the rotating Earth’s 

surface experience Coriolis force acting at right angles to the direction of motion, causing deflection to the 

right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left on the southern Hemisphere. The Coriolis force has 

maximum magnitude at the poles and zero at the Equator. 

Continental margin – submersed region of a continent, linking the continental landmass with the oceanic 

basins. It is constituted by a low-gradient and narrow continental shelf passing into a steep continental 

slope and rise below the shelf-break which is often located at ~150-200 m depth. Intensified exchange of 

water masses and organic/inorganic matter occurs between the continent and the deep-sea where submarine 

canyons are deeply carving the continental margin edges. 

Dense water cascading – near-bottom gravity current resulting from density difference between water 

masses on the shelf and adjacent slope, or from denser shelf water being forced over the shelf-break by 

external forcing (e.g. downwelling favourable-wind), and contributing to the ventilation of intermediate 

and deep oceanic waters.  

Diagenesis – Physical and chemical processes that lead to the alteration of the organism remains and 

associated mineral sedimentary component that occurs within the sedimentary matrix since after its burial. 

Eastern Boundary Current – broad and shallow diffuse currents along the eastern side of oceanic basins, 

adjacent to the western coasts of continents (e.g. Portugal, Canary and Benguela currents on the eastern 

side of the Atlantic Ocean; California Current on the eastern side of Pacific Ocean). Coastal upwelling is a 

recurrent feature of these current systems and hence, they are highly productive.  

Ekman circulation – movement of water resulting from the action of wind forcing on the ocean surface, 

balanced by the Coriolis force. On the Northern Hemisphere, it results in an averaged net transport of water 

90º to the right of the prevailing wind direction, causing divergence (upwelling) or convergence 

(downwelling) of water, depending on the prevailing wind forcing direction.  

Geostrophic currents – currents resulting from the balance between the Coriolis force and horizontal 

pressure gradients, i.e. water tends to flow from high to low pressure, as moving water tends towards a state 

of equilibrium, resulting in the tendency of slope and shelf currents to follow isobaths.

Sediment gravity flow – general term for sediment transport driven by gravity, including turbidity currents 

and debris flows. It results from a mixture of water and sediment particles, where the gravity acting on the 

sediment particles moves the fluid and not the contrary (as in land rivers), being the predominant and most 

efficient process by which particles are transported down a continental slope, and the prevailing transport 

mechanism within many submarine canyons.  

Internal wave – gravity wave that oscillate within any stratified fluid medium (e.g. the atmosphere and the 

ocean), being commonly generated over continental margins, where stratified water flows over irregular 

topography. They can propagate over large distances, causing turbulence and mixing, often strong enough 

to resuspend bottom sediments from the shelf and slope regions and thus, contributing to the generation of 

bottom nepheloid layers.  

Internal tide – internal waves that propagate at a tidal frequency, i.e. at diurnal and semidiurnal periods. 

Necrocoenosis (necros = death; cenosis = community) – accumulation of dead organisms (dead bodies 

with organic matter). 

Orictocoenosis (orictos = fossil; cenosis = community) – Association of fossil elements preserved in the 

sediment that have been subjected to diagenesis during a significant period of (geological) time.  

(Paleo)biocoenosis or (paleo)ecological assemblage (paleo = old; bios = life) - community of organisms 

that lived in a certain biotope during a certain recent time period (i.e. not fossilized). 

r-selected species – species able to reproduce quickly in unstable or unpredictable, often characterized for 

presenting small body size and high maximum growth rates (e.g. diatoms, which are known as being 

opportunistic species well adapted to survive and flourish within nutrient-rich and turbulent coastal 

environments). As opposed to K-selected species which are better adapted to compete successfully for 

limited nutrient availability in more stable or predictable environments, presenting larger body size and 

lower maximum growth rates, resulting in very constant populations that are in equilibrium with the 

environmental resources (e.g. coccolithophores thriving in the subtropical oceanic gyres).  

Taphocoenosis (tafos = grave; cenosis = community) – Buried association of skeletal remains within a 

certain sedimentation area. 

Taphonomy – refers to the set of processes that rule the transition of organic remains from the biosphere 

towards the lithosphere, from the moment of the organism death until it is recovered as a fossil. 

Thanatocoenosis (tanatos = death; cenosis = community) – Post-mortem association of skeletal remains 

(without organic matter) deposited on the water/sediment or subaereal/soil interfaces.
