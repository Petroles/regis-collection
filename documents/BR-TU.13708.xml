Tunellite is a strontium borate mineral with formula: SrB6O9(OH)2?3(H2O) and occurs as colorless crystals
in the monoclinic pyramidal crystal system. An intense Raman band at 994 cm?1 was assigned to the BO
stretching vibration of the B2O3 units. Raman bands at 1043, 1063, 1082 and 1113 cm

?1 are attributed to
the in-plane bending vibrations of trigonal boron. Sharp Raman bands observed at 464, 480, 523, 568 and
639 cm?1 are simply defined as trigonal and tetrahedral borate bending modes. The Raman spectrum
clearly shows intense Raman bands at 3567 and 3614 cm?1, attributed to OH units. The molecular
structure of a natural tunellite has been assessed by using vibrational spectroscopy.

1. Introduction

The mineral tunellite [1,2] is hydrated hydroxy borate of stron-
tium of formula SrB6O9(OH)2?3H2O. The mineral is a rare mineral
formed in borate deposits. The mineral is named after George
Gerard Tunell, Jr. (1900–1996), Professor of Geology, University
of California, Los Angeles, California, USA. The mineral is known
from a significant number of deposits worldwide [1,3–6].

Tunellite is one member of a series of borate compounds of the
borate series M2+O.3B2O3?xH2O [7]. Other borate minerals include
veatchite (Sr), p-veatchite (Sr) with x = 2, nobleite (Ca), with
x = 4, aksaite (Mg) and gowerite (Ca) with x = 5 [7]. Many synthetic
borates with this fundamental formula have been forthcoming. The
chemistry of tunellite including its thermal decomposition has
been studied by Gulensoy and Teberdar [8]. The effect of heat
treatment on the structural properties of the tunellite has been
studied [9]. Hydrogen bonding in tunellite has been elucidated
[10]. Boron NMR spectroscopy has proven useful for the study of
the polyanions in tunellite [11].

Tunellite is monoclinic with point group 2/m [2,7]. The cell
characteristics are P21/a with a = 14.415(3), b = 8.213(1),
c = 9.951(2), b = 114.05(1)_ and Z = 4. Tunellite occurs in prismatic
crystals up to 10 cm long or compact fine-grained nodules. The
crystal structure contains infinite sheets composed of polymerized
borate polyanions, with Sr2+ cations and water molecules filling
available spaces in and near the sheets [7]. Adjacent sheets are held
together solely by bonds to water molecules [7]. The polymerized
borate polyanions are composed of individual borate groups, each
group containing three B–O tetrahedra and three B–O triangles.

Vibrational spectroscopy has been applied to borate glasses
[12–15]. There have been a number of studies of borate glasses
doped with a wide range of radioactive atoms [16,17]. Borate
glasses are used as a means of containment of radioactive materi-
als. There have been a number of studies looking at the effect of
radiation on borate glasses [18,19]. If there is to be an understand-
ing of borate glasses and their role in radioactive element contain-
ment, then an understanding of the vibrational spectroscopy of
borate minerals needs to be undertaken. The number of vibrational

spectroscopic studies of borate minerals is quite few and far be-
tween [20–23]. The number of Raman studies of borate minerals
is also very limited [24,25]. There have been a number of infrared
studies of some natural borates [26–29]. Most of these references
are not new and there have been no recent studies on the vibra-
tional spectroscopy of natural borates. Ross in Farmer’s treatise re-
ported the infrared spectra of several borate minerals [30].

The use of infrared spectroscopy is limited by the spatial reso-
lution of the technique which is around 25 lm. In comparison,
the spatial resolution using Raman spectroscopy is 1 lm. Thus,
when studying a mineral using spectroscopic techniques it is
advantageous to use Raman spectroscopy. The selection of the tar-
get mineral is more easily made. With infrared spectroscopy, any
impurities will be measured as well as the target mineral. Raman
spectroscopy has proven most useful for the study of secondary
minerals [25,31–36].

To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there have been very few
infrared spectroscopic studies of tunellite type structure [29,37]
and no Raman studies of this natural mineral have been forthcom-
ing. The objective of this paper is to report the vibrational spectro-
scopic study of a natural tunellite mineral and relate the spectra to
the molecular chemistry and the crystal chemistry of this borate
mineral. We have characterised tunellite using a combination of
Raman and infrared spectroscopy.

2. Experimental

2.1. Mineral

Details of the mineral have been published (page 80, vol. 5)
[38].

2.2. Raman spectroscopy

Crystals of tunellite were placed on a polished metal surface on
the stage of an Olympus BHSM microscope, which is equipped with
10?, 20?, and 50? objectives. The microscope is part of a Reni-
shaw 1000 Raman microscope system, which also includes a
monochromator, a filter system and a CCD detector (1024 pixels).
The Raman spectra were excited by a Spectra-Physics model 127
He–Ne laser producing highly polarised light at 633 nm and col-
lected at a nominal resolution of 2 cm?1 and a precision of
±1 cm?1 in the range between 200 and 4000 cm?1. Repeated acqui-
sitions on the crystals using the highest magnification (50?) were
accumulated to improve the signal to noise ratio of the spectra. The
spectra were collected over night. Raman Spectra were calibrated
using the 520.5 cm?1 line of a silicon wafer. The Raman spectrum
of at least 10 crystals was collected to ensure the consistency of
the spectra.

2.3. Infrared spectroscopy

Infrared spectra were obtained using a Nicolet Nexus 870 FTIR
spectrometer with a smart endurance single bounce diamond
ATR cell. Spectra over the 4000–525 cm?1 range were obtained
by the co-addition of 128 scans with a resolution of 4 cm?1 and a
mirror velocity of 0.6329 cm/s. Spectra were co-added to improve
the signal to noise ratio. The infrared spectra are given in the sup-
plementary information.

Spectral manipulation such as baseline correction/adjustment
and smoothing were performed using the Spectracalc software
package GRAMS (Galactic Industries Corporation, NH, USA). Band
component analysis was undertaken using the Jandel ‘Peakfit’ soft-
ware package that enabled the type of fitting function to be
selected and allows specific parameters to be fixed or varied
accordingly. Band fitting was done using a Lorentzian–Gaussian
cross-product function with the minimum number of component
bands used for the fitting process. The Lorentzian–Gaussian ratio
was maintained at values greater than 0.7 and fitting was
undertaken until reproducible results were obtained with squared
correlations of r2 greater than 0.995.

3. Results and discussion

The Raman spectrum of tunellite in the 4000–100 cm?1 region
is displayed in Fig. 1a. This figure reports the position of the Raman
bands and their relative intensity. It is noted that there are parts of
the spectrum where no intensity is observed. Therefore, the spec-
trum is subdivided into sections in subsequent figures so that more
detailed assessment of the spectrum can be made. In a similar way,
the infrared spectrum of tunellite in the 4000–500 cm?1 region is
reported in Fig. 1b. The spectrum is not shown below 500 cm?1.
The reason for this is that we are using a reflectance technique
and the ATR cell absorbs all incident radiation. In a similar fashion
to the Raman spectrum, the infrared spectrum is divided into sec-
tions depending upon the types of vibrations being observed.

The Raman spectrum of tunellite in the 1200–700 cm?1 spectral
range is reported in Fig. 2a. The infrared spectrum of tunellite in
the 1200–700 cm?1 spectral range is reported in Fig. 2b. The Ra-
man spectrum in this spectral region is dominated by a sharp
intense band at 994 cm?1. Bands of significantly lesser intensity
are observed at 1043, 1063, 1082 and 1113 cm?1. The Raman band
at 994 cm?1 is assigned to the BO stretching vibration of the B6O9
units. The Raman bands at 1043, 1063, 1082 and 1113 cm?1 are
attributed to the BOH in-plane bending modes. Iliev et al. deter-
mined the Raman spectrum of a synthetic cobalt tunellite [39].

The symmetry species of some vibrational modes were deter-
mined. Iliev et al. [40] used Raman imaging to show the ferroelec-
tric properties of tunellite type compounds. These workers [40]
showed that tunellites exhibit a sequence of transitions from the
high temperature paraelectric cubic phase to ferroelectric ortho-
rhombic, monoclinic, trigonal phases, and finally to a monoclinic
phase at low temperatures where both ferroelectric and magnetic
orders coexist. Kim and Somoano determined the improper ferro-
electric transition using Raman spectroscopy [41].

In contrast, the infrared spectrum of tunellite (Fig. 2b) shows
complexity with many overlapping bands, making the assignment
of the infrared bands very difficult. The intense infrared band at



R.L. Frost et al. / Journal of Molecular Structure 1059 (2014) 40–43 43
960 cm?1 with shoulders at 929, 947 and 985 cm?1 is assigned to
the trigonal borate stretching modes. The overlapping infrared
bands at 784, 809, 844, 863 and 877 cm?1 are attributed to the
infrared tetrahedral borate stretching and bending vibrations.
The series of bands from 669 through to 737 cm?1 are related to
trigonal borate bending modes.

The Raman spectra in the 700–400 cm?1 and in the 300–100 cm?1

spectral range are illustrated in Fig. 3a and b. Sharp Raman bands are
observed at 464, 480, 523, 568 and 639 cm?1. These bands are simply
defined as trigonal and tetrahedral borate bending modes. A series of
infrared bands at 669, 679, 699, 708, 728 and 737 cm?1 (Fig. 2b) are
due to these bending modes. Strong Raman bands are found in the
far wavenumber region at 150, 332 and 371 cm?1 (Fig. 3b). These
bands may be simply described as lattice vibrations.

Raman spectrum of tunellite in the 3800–2700 cm?1 spectral
range and the infrared spectrum of tunellite in the 3700–
2500 cm?1 spectral range are reported in Fig. 4a and b. According
to the commonly accepted formula of tunellite SrB6O9(OH)2?3(H2O),
both water or OH groups are found in the formula of the mineral.
The Raman spectrum clearly shows intense Raman bands at 3567
and 3614 cm?1. These bands are assigned to the stretching
vibrations of the OH units. Two OH-stretching bands in the Raman
spectra of the mineral, at 3405 and 3494 cm–1, respectively, are
indicative of two distinct hydrogen positions in the structure. Other
strong intensity bands at 3243, 3282, 3324, 3369, 3383 and
3430 cm?1 are found. These broader bands are assigned to water
stretching vibrations.

The infrared spectrum in the 1800–1300 cm?1 region is reported
in Fig. 5. An infrared band centred upon 1677 cm?1 is observed
which may be band component analysed into several components
at 1631, 1660 and 1727 cm?1. These bands are attributed to water
bending vibrations. The intensity as observed in the infrared spec-
trum is quite strong with a broad band at 1631 cm?1 found.

The development of these type of compounds such as tunellite
rests with their ferromagnetic and pyro-electric properties [42].
The development of piezoelectric properties is time continuous
[43,44]. Also a hydroxy compound has been synthesised [45],
although the vibrational spectroscopy of this compound was not
reported. In the infrared spectrum (Fig. 2b) a series of low intensity
bands are observed.

4. Conclusions

There are many borate minerals which have yet to have their
vibrational spectrum determined and the molecular structure as-
sessed in terms of their vibrational spectrum. In this work we have
measured the Raman and infrared spectrum of tunellite, a
hydrated hydroxy borate mineral of calcium with formula:
SrB6O9(OH)2?3(H2O). The importance of the mineral tunellite rests
with the chemistry of the compound and the range of isomorphic
substitutions which can be made in order to produce specially
selected ferroelectric, pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties.

The Raman spectrum in this spectral region is dominated by a
sharp intense band at 994 cm?1. Bands of significantly lesser inten-
sity are observed at 1043, 1063, 1082 and 1113 cm?1. The Raman
band at 994 cm?1 is assigned to the BO stretching vibration of
the B6O9 units.
